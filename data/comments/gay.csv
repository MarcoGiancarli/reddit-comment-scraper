gay,3e26x4,igorzets,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:54:46 2015 UTC,"I suffer with the same kind of anxiety problem. What I have come to realize is that the world couldn't care less about your feelings, and what really matters is the things you do. Now, on a more helpful note I'd try to just go with the flow and try not to think to much. If someone asks you out, say you'll go and go. No thinking. It also helps in the conversation question. If the conversation isn't going anywhere and you feel it's more dreadful than delightful than you guys just aren't alike enough, so move on. Try not to try not to sound dumb. It destroys your self-sense of awareness and makes conversation even harder.  To sum up, go with the flow. I know it's not easy, and I myself don't get to exercise it very successfully, but try."
gay,3e26x4,lancaric,3,Tue Jul 21 18:47:42 2015 UTC,"I don't want to put the blame on smartphones/social media, but I think the art of conversation has taken a hit in these 'modern times'. It's important when you're talking to someone over dinner or a coffee to truly listen to what they're talking about. I know that seems like a simple concept, but it's the basic nature of conversation.  Ask questions. Listen to their answers. Ask new questions that involve a part of their answer and expand on something that perks your ears. If you're truly interested in someone, you will want to know more about them - work, family, life, interests, travel stories. Keep the conversation flowing - and hopefully they'll do the same. You both should get a chance at expounding on your life if you're both genuinely into getting to know each other.  Good luck! I can't imagine what you're going through. I get super excited when I'm about to meet someone new -- and if it's a train wreck, it makes for a good 'dating horror story' with the next guy (and friends).  And lastly, please, please, please try not to use drugs or alcohol as a crutch for being open to meeting people. It's a slippery slope and you'll eventually convince yourself you won't be able to go out/meet people unless you're drunk and high."
gay,3e26x4,lancaric,2,Tue Jul 21 15:24:41 2015 UTC,"That doesn't sound like bad advice. But what kind of topics are okay to bring up meeting someone new? I get worried I'll inadvertently bring up a sensitive topic so I prefer avoiding things like family and personal life when I'm just getting to know them.   And yeah, I don't want to use drugs and alcohol like that. I think I got lucky because I don't really have an addictive personality. I hate the taste of all alcohol and I don't have any urge to go out and take more drugs."

That's always safe and can sometimes lead organically into conversations about their family/etc or other topics some might consider personal.  I'm not a very private person, so when it comes to 'sensitive topics' I don't really have any when it comes to one-on-one conversations. I only proceed cautiously when I'm in a group setting as things can get awkward if religion/politics/etc get brought up. But one-on-one? I feel nothing is off the table - especially if it comes up organically and isn't some wild tangent out of nowhere (i.e. 'So, what are your thoughts on Catholicism?').  Glad to hear re: drugs/alcohol! You seem to realize this already from your original post, I've just been extra attentive about it as I've seen some friends slip down the path of not being able to socialize until they're buzzing on something."

For the time being I go to work, come home and browse through tinder only to find myself swiping left at nearly every profile, the ones I swipe right only match 50 percent of the time and then trying to get a conversation going is like talking to a brick wall 90% of the time.

It is totally not weird to be a gay man and not like anal sex. Many many gay men do not like anal sex. There are plenty of other fun things for two men to do in bed. The idea ""gay sex = anal sex"" causes so much unhappiness.  It's also not at all strange to have never found somebody you were into at 22. Sometimes it takes a little while. Life is not necessarily going to be especially hard for you--it may just be hard for a while, and in a few years you'll be amazed you were ever in a hole this dark. I felt that way about my sexuality as well, even though I didn't have the exact same straight-guy-related problem you're describing. People say life is short but that's not really true; the short parts are when you don't pay attention to it as it happens.  Lots of gay guys are ambivalent about or hostile toward the standard presentations of gay life or ""the community"" in the media/online. If you don't feel trans, you are probably not. You just haven't found the right ""niche"" for you in the gay world yet, and that's fine, you have time. It may be hard to explore different gay circles if you live in a very homophobic place---are there gay sports clubs or hobby groups where you live? The type of guys who hang out there are often very different from the club scene.   You sound like you're going through a really hard time. I hope things take a turn for the better for you. If it's possible, you might want to consider talking this stuff out with a professional (i.e. a therapist/counselor) --- I did something similar when I was around your age and it really really helped me."
gay,3e14c0,Gargamelody,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:03:52 2015 UTC,"Hey :) I really appreciate your comment. I do see that you do understand me.   It's just... I know that not liking anal sex is common but I am very sexual and I need sex. I think about it everyday. I want sex man. I make me so sad when I know that my best, young years are gone and I am still waiting for my first pleasurable sex. And to think that I will probably never have that is so depressing. I am good looking, young and healthy, I should be enjoying my youth.  It is very strange when you there is nothing appealing to you about the stuff that you can have. Every guy that I ever liked was str8. It's like I'm living the wrong life. I want to be happy, have boyfriend, hold hands, enjoy sex, kiss, fall in love madly, have future to think about.  And in my country (Serbia) there are no real pride parades let alone ""gay sports clubs or hobby groups"" . No Parades, just weak attempts with thousands of people protesting it and wrecking the city because of that. All my friends were homophobic before I came out.  I meet guys online sometimes, they claim to be nice but they are always fucked up one way or another. And I am afraid that I became one of them now - angry, sad gay that hates his life. Who wants that...  It really is hard. And I am really thinking of talking about this stuff with some kinda therapist/counselor (even thou most of them are homophobic in this country also).   I just can't take it anymore."
gay,3e14c0,Horuslv6,2,Tue Jul 21 18:54:44 2015 UTC,"I don't know how much this helps you, but I for my part am lucky to live in a country where it's accepted to a degree as you can hold hands in public. Also, I don't have the loneliness problem, because I seem to be pretty demisexual (tumblr word, haha, basically I fall in love with people, that I'm good friends with, rather than needing ""physical attraction""), so I can just go on webpages, chat with people that I find sweet, and dunno, 'fall in love' to some degree, I guess.  What I can agree with you though, is that I'm not a big fan of gay life. I hate how people ""divide the spheres"", meaning they create websites for gay people, apps for gay people, media in general, straight people see themselves as a group in opposition of gay people and also talk about them in that manner and vice-versa, the divisions go on, as I'm sure you know. Also, even though I respect those people and things, I don't at all enjoy gay bars, gay nightlife in general, not interested in hookups, don't like drag queen shows, and honestly, people who 'act gay' (gay lisp etc.) even annoy me to some degree.  I can agree so, that to some degree i feel like I don't have a sphere of my own in this world, because people won't let me be part of mainstream ""straight culture"" (I always end up being the one gay guy in my social circles, and I don't particularly like that role), meaning they treat me differently, like trying to avoid gay jokes, even though I mostly wouldn't mind, and so on, while on the other hand I'm not interested in interacting with the typical gay culture."

And it's sad that even most gay men can't understand you and brand you as ""auto-homophobic"" just because they can't understand your situation. They enjoy they lives and are blind to the problems of other gay people. We are all different.

gay,3dvzue,qqqqq_qqqq,6,Mon Jul 20 03:45:53 2015 UTC,Ok first of all why is your trainer giving you testosterone?

The app should not display users as ""online"" for more than five seconds after they've already,  for whatever reason, closed the app and put the phone away.

It's just rude and immaturity (the excuse in the article) is a lame excuse.  The slow fade is immature too, but a lot less abrupt and bizarre."

A simple way for us to achieve this goal is simply not acknowledging social gender roles.  I adore how you're comfortable being the ""girlfriend""/soft-one/feminine but I guess you must also possess qualities like Bravery, Courage, Loyalty, Confidence, etc. that are normally seen as ""Alpha Male Traits"". You should also embrace these qualities, having a soft-side/softer spoken doesn't make you less of a man that you need to identify as a ""girlfriend"".

Yup, great idea, let's drive some more people to suicide with therapies that evidently do not work.   examples such as “Christine” Jorgenson, “Jan” Morris, and “Renee” Richards   Whatever you think about gender identity, it is rude to put somebody's name in scare quotes. Those are those people's names. Names are man-made things and obviously can be changed.   The champions of this meme, encouraged by their alliance with the broader LGBT movement, claim that whether you are a man or a woman, a boy or a girl, is more of a disposition or feeling about yourself than a fact of nature.   On the contrary, most trans people absolutely consider it to be in their nature. The brain is a natural thing, and it's responsible for everything we think and feel. So why should the genitals have priority over that? They are not any more natural.   Based on the photographic evidence one might guess Bruce Jenner falls into the group of men who come to their disordered assumption through being sexually aroused by the image of themselves as women.   Must be a truly prodigious psychiatrist to diagnose someone he never met based on one single photo, real professional.  There is a good reason conversion therapy for children should be banned. It does not work, and has been proven again and again to do them immense psychological harm. Ideologically motivated doctors like him are condemning those children to what is essentially psychological torture, an attempt at brainwashing, often leading to depression and suicide.   I don't believe for a second that this doctor cares about science on this issue. The way he writes this shows clearly that he is ideologically motivated. Trans people don't fit into his worldview, and he'll make them suffer for that."

To entertain the possibility this reduction to fetishism is correct, you make it sound as if you already question the label umbrella.   I haven't read anything about it yet, but I would assume that we conceive of trangenderism as essentially an intersex condition of the mind. Gender identity may be a social construct especially its superficial aspects, but it is also essential and must involve the physical nature of parts of the brain. It seems like Johns Hopkins faculty* are still denying the essential fundamental aspect of gender.  There is a separate issue buried in this about the value of surgery in all cases. Maybe they have a valid criticism about the concept of promoting surgery when body acceptance might possibly have better long term results for dysphoria. I don't know though.

The comparison to the emperor with no clothes is a critique of culture, which is then automatically shifted onto the individuals. This isn't something a respectable scholar would do with any other mental condition (I'm not agreeing with him that transgenderism is a ""fetish"" or whatever -- just pointing out that his own argument hints at the idea that the transgendered are ruining culture, which is not how these arguments are usually made).  And his critique of the COVER PHOTO for Vanity Fair reeks of judgment, as he makes it sound like the sexualization in that photoshoot was somehow an intrinsic component of the subject's personality. By that logic, all models are whores -- which is just a stupid, stupid way of thinking. The article is full of examples like this.

They had much the same problems with relationships, work, and emotions as before. The hope that they would emerge now from their emotional difficulties to flourish psychologically had not been fulfilled"".[26] Second, they expressed little interest in and seemed indifferent to babies or children (typically female interests).[27] Third, they came off as caricatures of the opposite sex. -https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_R._McHugh  I don't think he's saying transgender doesn't exist. More that there needs to be more research done. He is saying however that there does exist a fetish to be transgender and there's a psychological problem where people want to become transgender because they believe it'll solve their problems. These same people also have a very high suicide rate after they change their sexual orientation. That doesn't mean transgenderism doesn't exist. He's not saying that.  I don't think he's talking about men who like men and have female caricatures.  If you notice these same transgender that Paul McHugh is talking about also still like women after changing their gender to be a woman and then claim to be lesbian."

gay,3dfn97,FateJace,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:15:14 2015 UTC,"It's basically discrimination coming out in a different manner. Christian bakeries are seen as ""us"" and so held to the same moral standard as we hold ourselves. Muslim bakeries are seen as ""them"" to many and so no held to the same moral standard. Essentially it highlights how those in out groups, those stigmatised, are actually in some ways given less scrutiny. The downside is that these out groups then get stereotyped and judged as a group rather than as an individual.   We see the same effect when the straight majority considers gay subculture. Overt sex and drugs are tolerated in the out group gay subculture in a way that doesn't happen in the accepted straight culture. In a way their mainstream brains are telling them that ""they"" (the gays) can't do any better anyway. The mainstreaming of gay subcultures is already having effects on what is tolerated as it becomes beholden to mainstream mores.   So you can see that in many ways tolerating Muslim bakeries discrimination is itself discrimination, which shows up people's islamophobia. Well done for noting the absurdity of holding them to different standards to anyone else. Some day we will consider everyone ""us"" with common rights and obligations.   [please note I am using bakeries as an example to highlight a point rather than referring to any specific case or jurisdiction]"

To say that it should be avoided at all costs is way too harsh though. I have earned excellent experiences from scouting, and you may do more harm than good by steering people away from it.

gay,3d8t5c,cliffholly,8,Tue Jul 14 12:00:20 2015 UTC,"first, ""marriage"" in the bible is not ""one man, one woman."" marriage as used in the bible is a man passing possession of property (in this case the father of a girl/woman) to another man (the husband) usually in exchange for other goods (cattle, sheep, land.) this is the historical context of marriage in those days. additionally, a man could have many wives. however, a woman could only ever have one husband. if she had sex a man other than her husband, she was to be killed (what about the man? he could make restitution to the woman's ""owner"" - the father or husband.) you see this as well where it says that if a man raped a virgin, he was required to marry her and pay restitution to her father. women were property. if someone suggested that you marry for love, they would laugh you out of the city.  second, if you really study the bible in context you will see that the verses in the OT that most people quote are written to the Levites, who were the priests of Israel. they were not written to the common people of Israel. however, that said, it doesn't say that homosexuality is a sin, it calls it an ""abomination"" which means that it is ""outside"" of the acceptable practice of the nation of Israel. abomination literally means ""away from human"" or something that an animal would practice.  now, turning to the NT, there are verses which point to the idea that what is sinful is not homosexuality but being promiscuous. and this applies not only to gays but heterosexuals as well. the bible basically says, if you are have multiple sexual partners, you are sinning. one thing to note: in ancient Roman days, there was no word for homosexuality. nor one for heterosexuality. sex was sex. what was condemned was (1) prostitution - selling your body for pleasure, and (2) adultery - having more than 1 partner.  finally, in case you haven't noticed (or read the bible) you should realize that Jesus never once said anything about two men or two women having sex. he never once condemned these acts, even though from historical records we know that the practice was very common even in this time. instead he singled out the priests for having sex, adulterers, and prostitutes. if you look at Paul's writings, he writes again about male prostitution and promiscuity, not about gay men in a committed relationship.  all that aside, remember that god created you the way you are. he created you as a gay man with the desire to have relationships with other men. if you feel it is wrong to have sex outside of marriage, then don't. save yourself until you find the right man, then enjoy the hell (or heaven) out of it."
gay,3d8t5c,PirateCodingMonkey,2,Tue Jul 14 16:17:09 2015 UTC,"It's worth knowing that, even though people think some Bible verses refer to gay sex, none actually do. NONE OF THEM.  These are all the Bible verses that people (wrongly) think refer to gay sex.   You shall not lie with a male as with a woman; it is an abomination (Leviticus 18).   This refers to rape.   If a man lies with a male as with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination; they shall surely be put to death; their blood is upon them (Leviticus 20).   This also refers to rape.   For this reason [idolatry] God gave them up to passions of dishonor; for even their females exchanged the natural use for that which is contrary to nature, and likewise also the males, having left the natural use of the female, were inflamed by their lust for one another, males with males, committing what is shameful, and receiving in themselves the recompense which was fitting for their error (Romans 1: 26-27).   This refers to prostitution.   Whether ye know not, that wicked men shall not wield the kingdom of God? Do not ye err; neither lechers, neither men that serve maumets [neither men serving to idols], neither adulterers, neither lechers against kind, neither they that do lechery with men (1 Corinthians 6: 9-10).   This most likely refers to prostitution or promiscuity. This is from the fourteenth-century Wycliffe Bible, and the word ""lechery"" is archaic and difficult to approximate in contemporary English. In other words, this verse is usually mistranslated.   Knowing this, that the law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and for sinners, for unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers, For whoremongers, for them that defile themselves with mankind, for menstealers, for liars, for perjured persons, and if there be any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine. (1 Timothy 1: 9-10).   This refers to adultery/promiscuity.   Even as Sodom and Gomorrha, and the cities about them in like manner, giving themselves over to fornication, and going after strange flesh, are set forth for an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal fire (Jude 1: 7).   This refers to the failure to be hospitable to guests (People in Sodom and Gomorrah frequently raped their house-guests, and that's why the cities were destroyed, contrary to popular belief.).  These are all the Bible verses that Wiki says might pertain to homosexuality, but these all either refer to rape, prostitution, promiscuity/adultery, or failure to be hospitable to guests. The Bible never mentions gay sex directly and certainly never mentions same-sex marriage.  Source: Too many years of Catholic school.    Also, the Romans didn't have a concept of gay sex or straight sex. They identified themselves based on whether they ""gave"" or ""received"" (for lack of a perfect word) sex, not the gender that they had sex with. That is, straight men and gay tops ""gave"" sex and shared an identity, and women and gay bottoms ""received"" sex and shared another identity. Notions of homosexuality and heterosexuality as identities didn't really develop until the late Middle Ages.  It appalls me that some politicians make policies influenced by their own misinterpretations of the Bible (or, worse yet, shared misconceptions about the Bible). Know your shit. I went to Catholic school, and the amount of people I've called out for not knowing their shit is higher than it should be.  TL;DR: People will misinterpret the Bible. Educate yourself. If you're going to read the Bible, read the King James version, not that awful New American version.  Also, I don't know why more people haven't considered that religions -- like everything else -- are wrong sometimes. There is no reason why consenting adults shouldn't be able to have sex if each adult has no conflicting commitments and if the sex can't/won't harm society (And, yes, that statement includes incest, but not inbreeding.)."

There have also been numerous translations and translations of translations which make it hard to know exactly what to do. I'd say the book is not supposed to be followed a 100% but more of a helpful guide about being a decent human being with stories about morality. But I'm saying that as an agnost since I'm not Christian. Anyway I think the best thing you can do is look at the big things (like how Jesus loved everyone and never discriminated against people for their social status or gender or sexuality).

Are the Catholics correct in that both faith and works are required to enter heaven or is the Protestant view that faith alone is enough?  What about baptism?  Are the infants baptized by some sects truly baptized or maybe the Amish have it right in that only adult baptism is right?    There any number of things you have been told are THE TRUTH but in fact almost anything you have been told is one interpretation of the scriptures.  There is no such thing as ""Christianity,"" there are any number of Christianties.   My best advice is for you to seriously ask yourself exactly why you are a certain kind of Christian, and exactly why you are a Christian at all. Contemplate on that, please. Of course I don't mean here, I mean in some quiet moments when you can peacefully collect your thoughts, do that tough introspection."
gay,3d8t5c,Al-Shamar2,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:34:59 2015 UTC,"As an atheist, I speak as someone from the outside, looking in, but it seems there that yes, there are Christians who do cherry-pick the Bible like that. I also see so many different views (some anti-lgbt, some perfectly fine with lgbt) among those who identify as Christian, and even some Christians who accuse other Christians of being false Christians, that I have given up on trying to figure out what a True Christian is. I can tell you that there are going to be Christians out there who will say that you are not a True Christian simply because you are gay.  Do what you need to do to live your life. You indicate in another comment that your Christianity is important to you. If it works for you, then I have no inclination to try to change that, but if I feel that you are engaged in a particular version of Christianity that is not going to be good for your long-term mental health, then I cannot in good conscience encourage you to stick with it. If you have to go out of your way to find another denomination of Christianity that works for you, then do it. Or if you find another spirituality outside of Christianity that ends up working for you, don’t be afraid of it. Heck, my niece, who I once thought was going to be a lifelong Christian, recently told me she no longer considers herself Christian, but still believes a god exists.  Just do what is best for you. But do realize that what is best might not be what is comfortable for you this very moment. Learning happens outside the comfort zone.  You are in the middle of becoming an adult, and one of the most adult things you can do is to be able to do what is the best thing to do, even if it is far from being comfortable.  Addendum: And also, do realize that the empirical evidence is out there: it is easier for someone to change his or her religious beliefs than sexual orientation, even if changing the religious beliefs is already very hard, and sometimes religious beliefs do change, and you might not realize it until much later."

The original Christian Church wanted nothing to do with the whole marriage business and until the middle ages only offered a blessing and even on occasion blessed the 'brotherhood' of 2 non related men. The bible gives the punishment for wearing different types of cloth at the same time, how much you're allowed to beat your slaves and from which nations you can take slaves. All of these laws we ignore but gays are bad? Bullshit!  You choose to be religious and follow a specific makeup god, you don't choose to be gay... Which do you think is more natural? When we are observing homosexual behaviour in more species of animals every year and only daydreaming humanity has religion... Which practice sounds more in keeping with our design?  You're young, don't worry about this sort of thing till you're a lot older have fun, enjoy life and let this be a problem for when you're wiser and by then religious organisations will have changed their views on the subject (like they have so many times on other subjects) and it'll be fine."
gay,3d8t5c,Al-Shamar2,2,Wed Jul 15 15:06:16 2015 UTC,"I went through the same dilemma at around the same age as you. I felt like my feelings were at odds with what I had learned at church and that I couldn’t have a relationship with God if I wanted to have sex and relationships with men. In the end (17 y/o), I decided to abandon religion and I became ambivalent towards the existence of god(s) and what they thought about how I lived my life. It took a couple of years to deprogram myself, but 13 years later I’m in a great place.  For gay Christians who want to remain a part of the church, there are apologists who have actually analyzed the passages in the Bible that supposedly speak against homosexuality and have found that the Bible doesn’t necessarily state that homosexual relations are sinful (a quick Google search will bring up a couple of books). Furthermore, there are denominations (e.g. United, Episcopal) that embrace members of the LGBT community and, in some cases, have done so for decades. If you’re serious about reconciling your faith with homosexuality then you might consider speaking to a counsellor at one of those churches.  Good luck."

I had went through a phase where I began questioning a lot of what I ""believed"" .. I put that in quotes because my beliefs were told to me, I hadn't actually found them myself. So, I read the bible.  Multiple times trying to understand it.. and looking at it from an academic standpoint.  Here's what I decided and maybe it will help you:  1: Nowhere in the bible does it say anything about two men getting married.  Nowhere.  2: Leviticus says something along the lines of a man shouldn't lie with man as he does a woman.  I decided this is misinterpreted by homophobes and what it probably means is that it's disrespectful to treat another man like property (women were considered property) and declares it a sin to do so.  3: Despite what I think Leviticus means, it doesn't matter... Jesus said so.  Literally.  The purpose of Jesus was to cleanse us of our sins (by sacrificing himself) and declaring that the old laws were to no longer be followed and set forth new laws.  This is why the New Testament is considered the book of the Christian religion.  The reason Christians still read the old testament is so that they can understand what life was like before Jesus and what he died for.  Jesus never says anything regarding homosexuality and therefore, I do not understand how homosexuality is even a problem with Christians.  I'm typing this on my phone so forgive me for any grammatical or spelling errors and please correct me if you feel like I am mistaken somewhere.  I think I should also say that the more I learned of the religion the more I thought it to be childish in nature.  I am an atheist now and couldn't be happier.

I was raised Catholic and have absolutely zero intention of ever following anything in the bible for a plethora of reasons.  /u/confused_nobody is just saying that it's pointless to live and die by what the bible says, but rather take good life lessons from it and build from there.  Never base who you are on a stupid book.  Form your own opinions and stop worrying about what a book or your parish will think.  The Bible is riddled with inaccuracies so if you are going to follow it to the ""T"" then there are more things you should be worried about than sex before marriage.  When you get older you will be allowed to make your own decisions and I fear that what happened to you happened to me, where you never had a say in what religion to join and now it is ingrained into your life by your parents.

Ultimately it comes down to:   following your current faith; or choosing to be happy and embracing your sexual orientation.   I tried to follow my faith for a long time. It led to misery, rejection, and depression. When I accepted that I like guys and that I needed to find happiness, it led to acceptance and happiness (though it was not always easy or fun). I look back now and deeply regret that I tried to hold on to my faith as long as I did.  As others have said, it is possible to find an LGBT-affirming Christian organization if that is part of your choice to be happy. Don't lie to yourself and think you can have your current faith and be happy in the long run.  After re-reading my reply, it seems pretty serious.

gay,3d5xyc,bgotch,19,Mon Jul 13 19:55:53 2015 UTC,"Too little too late IMHO.   The BSA has disenfranchised a whole generation (or more) of gay former Scouts who have moved on to other things in life. I would have loved to volunteer after getting Eagle and graduating high school, but I wasn't welcome. In fact, I was treated like a threat to children. My time and talents were respected, appreciated, even recruited by other organizations, and now several years later I'm well established in these new groups. Why would I want to go back to a group that has so begrudgingly ""allowed"" me to volunteer?"
gay,3d5xyc,abstrusey,3,Mon Jul 13 22:21:42 2015 UTC,Too little too late IMHO.  The BSA has disenfranchised a whole generation (or more) of gay former Scouts who have moved on to other things in life.    I don't think that matters to them at all.  The Boy Scouts are essentially an arm of the Mormon church at this point and they don't want gay people involved.  All they want is to avoid future controversy about being bigoted.  I'd even wager that the situation you describe -- where they approve of gay scout leaders but no gay leaders get involved because they were ignored for a 'generation' -- is basically their ideal.
gay,3d5xyc,ParanoydAndroid,2,Tue Jul 14 13:27:47 2015 UTC,"Their ideal might be all of that AND to remain relevant in modern times, but I don't think they can have both. 10 years ago, if I told someone I earned my Eagle Scout, they respected it and me just slightly more because of what it represents. Now that's much less so the case.   Any organization that wants to thrive has to demonstrate that it provides value to its membership. The BSA has struggled in achieving this. When they disenfranchise as many people as they have, it seriously hurts their ability to recruit and keep new members. Am I going to put my kids in scouts? I'm not totally sure, but probably not. They would be the first in a line of 5 generations of Eagles. If you're losing people like me from your organization, you're gonna have a bad time."

I was actually attending byu when I came outside lived in Provo at the time. I like to call it porem, but most people refer to it as happy valley lol. The gay community is actually very big in salt lake and we have one of the best prides in the country. Provo/Orem would be about my last choice to live, mostly because it's filled with old Mormon families and a bunch of barely twenty something's playing house. Salt lake is different than a lot of cities because it's really just the downtown area that is Salt Lake City. Then it's just a bunch of cities that run together and line the mountains. But, it's all the salt lake valley. You can hop on I-15 and be in provo in twenty minutes no prob. But it's a great place to live and the mountains are beautiful. You can dm me if you want more info or whatever. I actually love the opposite direction, 15 minutes north of salt lake in Davis county. But I lived in the salt lake valley for over ten years. Hope this helps."

As far as gay fiction featuring adults, books by Andrew Grey (Love Means No Shame is the first one in a series), Marie Sexton's Coda series (Promises is the first installment), and Sean Kennedy's Tigers and Devils series (the third one just came out after a few years hiatus!) appear to be pretty popular.   A few of my other favorites are (in no particular order):    Caught Running by Madeleine Urban and Abigail Roux (two high school teachers/baseball coaches with a bit of an unrequited past find each other. This one might be my favorite of all for reasons I can't quite explain). Then the Stars Fell by Brandon Witt (this one has an interesting plot due to the protagonists' escaping a FLDS compound in search of a new life on the outside).  Hot Head by Damon Suede (hot firefighters with a lot of heart) Offside by Ryan Loveless (gay professional soccer players navigate a relationship) Outing the Quarterback by Tara Lain (wealthy college quarterback's secret ambition to become an artist leads to a run in with a young man struggling to make ends meet)   Continuing the sports theme, Teegan Loy's books are pretty good as well.   None of these will be winning a Pulitzer Prize, but if you're like me and just looking for some easy, entertaining fiction involving gay men's relationships, I think you'll find something to enjoy here."

If you live near a bigger city, take a road trip and hook up there but again, be careful... Lots of nuts out there!"

My aunt is gay, and no one ever told me.  I realized when I was 12 or so that the woman she lived with was probably her wife.  Everyone was too uncomfortable to explain it to me.  Despite what they said, I understood that they would prefer if I was straight.  I understood that if I married a man I wouldn't really be married in my parents' eyes because they never treated her like family.    So I'd say the most important thing is not telling him how you'd feel if he was gay, but showing him how you'd act.  It sounds like you're doing that already."

I was closeted because people at school always called everyone faggot. Wore the wrong color? What a fag. Someone punched you because you play with dolls? What a pussy faggot.     At home my brother used these words. My parents told him to stop beating me up and making me cry. They never told me it was ok to be gay.     We went to a catholic church. The priest taught a lot about homosexuality being a sin. My parents never sat me down and said he was wrong.    If you want your son to be comfortable coming out to you, my advice is to be vocal about gay rights before you are ""forced"" to by having a gay child. Silence is taken as either ambivalence or agreement to antigay rhetoric."

gay,3cxl9d,Dumrauf28,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:20:51 2015 UTC,"Okay, so you said you were in love with a girl. Does the thought of a woman's body arouse you? If so, how does that compare to your thought of a man's body? Do you also get aroused by that?   Now for a little more complexity. Does the idea of spending your life with a woman seem like an attractive idea to you? How about a man?   The reason I say it doesn't matter is that you are you. Things that you naturally want aren't going to change so worrying about them does nothing but cause undue stress. If you're afraid of physical violence against yourself then I would suggest keeping your personal views on your sexuality to yourself or a small group of trust-worthy people.   Only you can answer the question ""Am I gay?"" You may find the answer is that you like both, or even that your sexuality transcends the choice itself."

Don't feel like you need to rush yourself, and don't feel like you can never change your mind. Only you get to say what kind of person you are. :)  Also, not knowing is a perfectly valid answer. You can love and be attracted to whoever you want and not have to put a word to it if you want. A lot of people might think that you have to choose a label that describes your sexuality and live with it forever, but you really don't need to. Just focus on being you, the rest will come soon enough."
gay,3cxl9d,Wearethefoxes,3,Sat Jul 11 20:29:33 2015 UTC,"When I was 6 I thought I was gay because I always liked the men in sex scenes more than women. When I was 13 I thought I was straight because I always found my eye caught by beautiful women. When I was 18 I thought I was bisexual because I exclusively watched gay porn but still had thoughts about women. Now I'm 21 and even though I'm a virgin still I'm fairly certain I'm gay. These things change over time especially between 13 and 25. Some people go into their 50s thinking their straight and come out later. Some people think they're gay until they're 30 and settle down with a woman. Some people are bi. Some people are asexual.       Sexuality is much more complicated than people paint it to be.  Only you can tell what your sexuality is because you're the only one with a pure understanding of those feelings and where they come from. Don't get caught up in labels for now, just do what feels right to you, because if you feel comfortable with yourself even getting hit by stones or beaten is better than hating yourself for something you can't change. This is a quote from Sense8 that really helps explain it:       The only unforgivable violence in the world is the kind you inflict on yourself for not allowing you to be who you are.     It's a little cheesy but it's absolutely true. Forgiving others is easy. It's much harder to forgive yourself for trying to kill something beautiful inside you."

gay,3cwckt,ActuallyDavid_,20,Sat Jul 11 09:25:45 2015 UTC,"The reason the lgbt community is so vocal is due to the unfair nature of inherited sexuality. What I mean is that you are much much more likely to have a gay kid born to straight parents. In other minority groups, for example Black or Asian people, the kids of the parents will be able to confide in their parents and receive support in their identity. For LGBT+ kids parents will probably be straight, will only sometimes accept it and in some cases will hate that child no matter what the child tries to be. It is up to the community to inform people that its OK for people to be themselves and to be the surrogate parents to those not fortunate enough to have accepting parents.   I know it seems like we make a big deal of it but in reality we are making no more a deal of it than straight people. You may say ""oh look the token gay character on that show, so obviously a message about gay rights"", but you don't realise that for a gay person we notice the straight people and see that we may not be represented. If we "" toned it down"" then it may just be that gay people never get recognised there for the common understanding will always be that we are a minority.  Either way I'm rambling, we aren't trying to impose on anyone, just making sure there isn't anyone ashamed of themselves.  Msg me if you wanna chat about it"
gay,3cwckt,Confused_Nobody,25,Sat Jul 11 11:49:00 2015 UTC,"Why don't we just let them blend into society like everyone else?   The idea is not to somehow become invisible within society, but to achieve acceptance despite potential differences.   It's the same deal with African-Americans!

I just feel it's almost kind of offensive to gay people that when they tell someone that person is all surprised and starts treating them much nicer and stuff. I know that it's good that they treat them well, but it kind of makes them realize that they're ""different"", and may make them even sadder in the end result, knowing they're only being this nice BECAUSE they're LGBTQ. I just think it would be better for them if people treated them just the same, because that would no longer make them ""different"". My friend is Bi, and I know he'd feel the same way. Then again, that's just what I think."

gay,3cwckt,mispronounced,3,Sat Jul 11 16:31:05 2015 UTC,"It seems like whenever someone qualifies their post beforehand with ""I FULLY SUPPORT THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY"", they tend to go on to say something that comes off as not very well thought out, however good the intentions may be.  The fact of the matter is that while LGBTQ people are, in fact, normal people, many people don't get it, and just telling them to think about it is not going to help. While it is true that many of these people who need to ""think about it"" are religious, I have also seen a great number of people who do not claim affiliation with any religion, but who are also homophobic or anti-equality. It's really not such a simple thing to just think about.  The way society in general functions today privileges heterosexual people more often than not. The fight for LGBTQ equality aims to reset this and make it such that it doesn't matter what your sexual orientation is, you will be treated equally. This is what you get, but not what most people even remotely understand. So your message is good and all, but it's really not a simple thing to just think about. Besides, you're just preaching to the choir here. Are you even a member of the LGBTQ community? Because if you're not, your comments might even come off as offensive.  There's a whole lot of work to do before I will even consider the fight halfway won, and the SCOTUS ruling does not even come close. Even then, this is a very US-centric view of the world; this is really a universal issue. It's in the everyday, it's in the minute details, it's in the personal interactions and behaviour."

I go out in public with a guy im with if we hold hands we get might get the occasional ""aww"" from some girls but there is also they people who will stare and give nasty faces or say mean things or laugh. Even though we might not say anything is still hurts inside to be laughed at or ridiculed for being who you are. maybe there will be a time in the future when people won't care who anyone is with but the reality is that people still judge the lgbt community and we need to make it known that we are normal and not any different from anyone else."
gay,3cwckt,Bamihap,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:00:15 2015 UTC,"Not accepting people creates sub- and anti-cultures. Some of theses cultures express themselves extremely by oftentimes re-enforcing Clichés. 'Being gay' has become a lifestyle for some. I think this will fade away when popular culture and these subcultures merge, when people are accepted more.  I guess you can find the roots of these anti-cultures in the early gay movements. Back when being gay was a crime/mental illness, and later when AIDS broke out and gays had to be extra careful with their sexuality. Overcoming these sigma's and gaining more acceptance made the gay sub cultures more visible and more flamboyant.   I've been to the Amsterdam gay pride once. I don't think extravagant displays like that will help much. It's over the top and re-enforces a lot of the (negative) stereotypes people have against LGBTQ people. I'm gay and I do not see it as a lifestyle for me. I don't identify myself as a gay person. Where I live (The Netherlands) it's just not a big deal. I didn't even come out of the closet. I feel that being gay is normal, why would I need a special announcement to let everyone know I'm normal?  Again I think it's a reaction to the past. It has become a lifestyle for some. The fact that this is a thing is good news. But I think you'll see less and less of it. Just like with other anti/subcultures from the past (hippies)."

You should not abandon nor cling to values because they are values, you should abandon nor cling to values because of their inherent truths.    Humans work like this 99% of the time -- we have a flash of intuitive judgement, then we rationalize in support of that judgement.   We use our knowledge, our religion, our parents, our friends' norms to support our intuition.    Only about 1% of the time, we examine our intuition in a vacuum -- and open it to reshape it, adjusting to fit our current thoughts and emotions.      The 99%/1% aren't real numbers, they're just for illustration -- we spend most of our time judging quickly and then rationalizing (thinking that we're thoughtful but we're really not).

What really helped me come to a common ground with my Religion and my sexual orientation was the realization that The Bible is NOT the word of God. The Bible is a collection of stories and parables collected by supposed prophets of God. Also, I've always been taught that The Bible is meant to be interpreted- not to be taken literally. That being said, I'd like to ask you where God himself has directly said anything about homosexuals? Everyone has said that ""Sodom and Gomorra"" were destroyed by God because they were the cities of gays; The Bible says nothing more than the people of the cities partaking in ""obscene acts"" that were to be sinful.   I wish that Christians in general could stop putting a scale on sin. A sin is a sin; no sin has more worth than the other. That being said, who are you to judge one's sin? One of my favorite Bible versus is from the Book of John where a woman was to be stoned for committing adultery (A sin, that i'm sure a good amount of people commit) before this mob of people are about to stone a woman, Jesus supposedly said, When they kept on questioning him, he straightened up and said to them, “Let any one of you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone at her."".   You are a sinner, you live your life of sin- as do I. As the Catholics say, repent your sin (ANY sin) and you shall be welcomed into the kingdom of heaven.   This is not meant to be a ""let's preach Jesus"" moment. I'm one of those ""my religion is not your business; don't shove it down my throat"" kind of guys.

The Catholic church doesn't like gays, and they support policies and beliefs that are in direct opposition to basic human equality.  If you support those policies and make support of same known, it would be reasonable to conclude that you're a bigot."

However, if your opinion on my life also includes legislative action against me, then you are an intolerant ideologue, and we most certainly are not friends."
gay,3cvupt,mjeffm,3,Sat Jul 11 08:32:36 2015 UTC,"Hmmm why would a gay person want to be your friend if you're anti-gay? Being gay is part of who someone is; it's not an opinion. It's the same thing as asking why a black person wouldn't want to be friends with someone who's racist. In short, you're entitled to your views, but you have to accept that your views are hurtful to many people."
gay,3cvupt,Thinks_Too_Logically,3,Mon Jul 13 13:58:07 2015 UTC,"I'm a gay Christian, so I went through a lot of self-hatred for a while thinking that I was sinning for being unable to like girls. It took a lot of introspection to figure out why I thought this way, why I thought that it was correct to think this way, why I had to think that way.  The conclusion I've come to is that I was born gay, God still loves me regardless, and it isn't a sin. I've also concluded that being anti-gay is either a bigoted choice or a delusion that comes from years of indoctrination.  The reason I say ""delusion"" instead of ""ignorance"" is because delusions are beliefs that people choose to hold onto regardless of logic or evidence while ignorance is just not knowing.  When you say ""I'm anti-gay"" and follow up with ""I don't hate people that are gay"" it is a logical contradiction that shows why I say ""delusion."" You say you're against gays even though you don't hate them? It's as illogical as if I were to say ""I'm against blacks"" then saying ""but I don't hate them."" It's pure delusion to hold onto contradictory beliefs.  Either you hate gay people, or you're not anti-gay, or you're delusional. You're not a bigot, because a bigot is someone who is intolerant of opinions. You're intolerant against a group you don't hate. That's delusional."

I've learned that being gay doesn't define someone it's just an area that we disagree on. Opinions clash all the time on all different subjects that doesn't mean we have to hate each other. In a short summary Your sexuality doesn't define a person there are a lot of Gay who are great people, and just because we don't agree on some points doesn't mean we are ""enemies""."
gay,3cvupt,Thinks_Too_Logically,8,Sat Jul 11 14:41:06 2015 UTC,"It's not an area that you can even have an opinion on. My analogy to black people still holds.

I've learned that being black doesn't define someone; it's just an area that we disagree on. Opinions clash all the time on all different subjects that doesn't mean we have to hate each other. In a short summary your skin color doesn't define a person. There are a lot of blacks who are great people, and just because we don't agree on some points doesn't mean we are ""enemies"".   Being gay is as much of an opinion as being black, white, straight, Lebanese, or American; you can't change how you were born. Being anti-gay is an opinion. It's a choice you've made."

gay,3cvupt,rloesser,5,Sat Jul 11 21:43:38 2015 UTC,"Why are you against gay marriage? If it's because you ""believe it's wrong for gays to get married"" then it seems pretty clear cut that you're against gays having equal rights. All arguments against gay marriage are not logical:   Marriage is for children!    Then why are 2 60 year olds allowed to get married? Does an infertile woman have no marriage rights? Furthermore, there are many straight marriages that end up adopting rather than having children of their own.   Marriage is sacred!   Good thing the government controls marriage and not religious authorities. Furthermore, religion has historically had very little control over marriage itself. The only place religion has really entered into marriage is the ceremony. Furthermore, if you are against gay marriage because of your religion then my earlier posts explain exactly why it's delusional to say this and still ""not hate gay people.""   But historically there hasn't been gay marriage!   Historically there wasn't interracial marriage either. Should we bring back old intolerances?"

Their life choices don't necessarily affect your life. If you believe that homosexuality is a sin then don't engage in homosexuality. It's that simple.  You can hang out with homosexuals, you can befriend homosexuals, you can live with homosexuals, hell you can even fight alongside homosexuals for equal rights if you so desire.

One of our wisest advisor (shakaspeare) advised you to break it off. This is not the first time that you're doubtful about this relationship.   I personally think you're here for a reassurance so that you have a reason to still stay with him instead of actually asking for an advice. However, please allow me to show you some red flags that I've noticed in the post that you've written above.   People working in medical fields are busy, but are they so busy that they can't spend sometime outside with their love ones? The time you do spend together are almost always just a dinner, some brief chat which then leads to sex.  He prefers an open relationship with a limitation but somehow I think you actually want a committed exclusive relationship if possible. He's almost reaching the middle-age stage, independent and has yet to come out to his family members. (or he just didn't want to let his parents know that you're his BF) You guys met through Grindr and are in an open relationship. I would just like to ask whether he's still using it.   Hey, I'm really sorry that I'm saying all this. I understand that it is harsh, it is your first time but that is also the exact reason why I think you should break this off right now, when it hasn't turn sour.  Ask yourself a few questions,    Are you really okay with an open relationship? Do you not want to be in an monogamous mutually exclusive relationship with a man that you love? Do you want a BF that actually matches your schedule, matches your time of life and can really spend time with you since you guys are a couple? Do you want your love life to be out and proud, do you want to be married?   Hun, I normally don't put people down like this but I guess it is actually better for you to let this go.

You both clearly have different expectations about how often you'd ideally go out, and the date-to-sex ratio. If it's only been two months, he might not have had the time or energy to go out on a date (like dancing and dinner and a movie or whatever it may be) more than a once or twice. Mind you that if his schedule is very busy with work, he might need more time to rest than you would think. This is especially true if his job is very stressful or he works odd hours (which is very common in the medical field). That being said, if he's taken you to meet his family and you've met his friends, and he's introducing you as his boyfriend, those are all very good signs for you. That's a lot of progress for two months, and those are signs that he's taking your relationship very seriously.  As for the brief chats into sex, it's possible that that's really all he has the time or energy for. And if he's making a point of keeping up communication with you, you at least know he cares about you enough to be courteous outside of the bedroom.  I sincerely believe that you two can make this relationship work if you can sit with him and talk through the feelings you're having. It's your first time, so it's totally normal that you'd be having doubts and feeling insecure. The key is conversation, introspection, and understanding. Just tell him how you're feeling, see if he'll work with you on being more active, or if he's willing to make the relationship more comfortable for you.  Don't break it off in search of a perfect boyfriend. They don't exist. Relationships are a lot of work. If you really care about each other, you need to talk it out and find ways to be more accommodating to each other.  I personally don't think he's using you for sex, but I also think your feelings are completely valid and reasonable. Just talk it out with him, explain how you're feeling and why, and see if he's willing to work with you. If not, then it's best to break it off."
gay,3ckrpb,owenburnett,2,Wed Jul 8 18:00:01 2015 UTC,Wow that story hits really close to home. I just came out in February even though I knew I was gay since I was 14 (I'm 24 now). I went through so many of the same stages. I said I was bisexual in high school. Then joined the military and had to be straight took that one so far as to even get married to a woman. After all of the denial and self-deception I finally came out and haven't looked back. I was so afraid of losing my friends and being disowned by my family. After I came out I realize nobody I cared about cared that I was gay. I feel like I wasted years of my life worrying about something that just doesn't matter.   TL;DR similar situation to my own. Wish I had his courage when I was younger.

gay,3cmu9r,User7k7k7k7k7k7k7k7k,8,Thu Jul 9 03:19:56 2015 UTC,"I've read your post and comments and I have to say you don't seem gay to me, but you do seem paranoid, obsessive, and neurotic. You're dwelling way too much on the possibility of having any homosexual feelings and then overanalyzing everything you think and feel about it.  Do you want to have sex with men? If not then that's the end of it.   I wake up in the morning and instantly start fearing that I'm gay.   This is really unhealthy. Maybe you should talk to a therapist.  I don't think you're subconsciously gay, but I think you might be subconsciously homophobic, which is fueling your obsession.   I don't want to be a judge of other human beings because I am one as well and I cannot be better than you or vice versa, but something like homosexuality just strikes an odd note with me. I understand this is perhaps due to my upbringing, my family, etc., but simply put, I don't believe humans were created (however that was) with the purpose of same sexes attracting. That is just my personal opinion and I guard it as what it is, not seeing anything wrong with that.   Are you sure you're not homophobic?"
gay,3cmu9r,TychoDog,3,Thu Jul 9 16:18:56 2015 UTC,"Probably not. It sounds like there's some emotional trauma from being made fun of as a youth, which can affect anyone regardless of their sexual orientation. From what it sounds like, you are not primarily or exclusively attracted to males—ergo, you're most likely not gay.  Keep in mind that orientations aren't so easy to compartmentalize. It's possible for someone who identifies as straight to have some degree of interest in people of the same sex without being 'gay' or 'bisexual'. Whether you sometimes enjoy anal stimulation of whatever kind is also irrelevant—many straight people enjoy that, even if it's often stigmatized and mistakenly attributed to homosexuality.  On the whole, keep in mind that not 'wanting' to be gay/bi isn't going to be helpful at all in figuring out who you are. That sort of homophobia (I don't say this as an accusation...many non-straight people experience this same phenomenon) sounds like it's causing you a good deal of distress, and I think the first step is to accept that not being entirely certain is common and entirely acceptable. My suggestion would be to seek out a therapist to help you manage what sound like pretty intrusive, anxiety-inducing thoughts. I have OCD, so I've dealt with pretty extreme examples of this and I know it can be very rough."
gay,3cmu9r,turtleeatingalderman,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:49:21 2015 UTC,"I keep being afraid of that ""Most likely straight"" cause it's got a little bit of uncertainty to it. I keep saying that I would be extremely anxious and afraid to experiment in any way at all. Dunno if it's truly necessary."
gay,3cmu9r,turtleeatingalderman,2,Thu Jul 9 05:49:04 2015 UTC,"There's uncertainty because I'm not you. Nobody else—here or anywhere—can definitively answer the question one way or the other, and I think drawing a definite conclusion about your sexual orientation isn't a very urgent matter that needs to be worked out quickly, even if it feels that way.  If you're not comfortable experimenting, don't. If you are, do.  Ultimately, it sounds to me like the more helpful and healthier course of action would be to tackle some of the anxiety that this issue is causing you by talking to a qualified therapist or medical professional, if that's an option that's available to you."
gay,3cmu9r,FateJace,2,Thu Jul 9 06:07:11 2015 UTC,"If you have been truthful to yourself the entire time you're typing this, chances are you're not gay at all/just a little gay.  You're straight and you're fine, nothing is wrong being a little on the soft side. Metrosexual Gentlemen have their fair share of market with the ladies nowadays.  A lot of guys nowadays are timid, shy and are introverts. That doesn't make you ""less of a guy"" and certainly doesn't make you gay.  Males have this thing called prostate and if you rub it, you WILL feel good. Having anal pleasure doesn't make you gay, in fact it is a thing that straight men should try too.    Women aren't the only ones with a powerful G-spot. A guy's prostate — the walnut-size gland under his bladder — is the ultimate magic button to push if you want to blow his mind in bed. To tantalize it, partway through oral sex or intercourse, rest two fingers against the swath of skin between his testicles and anus. ""His prostate is situated above your fingers, inside his body,""    Quote from Cosmopolitan  You've mentioned that you get turned on by big dicks and fit body. I don't know what did you mean by that, like a boner? Thing is it is very very normal to admire/idolize/appreciate male body beauty. That doesn't make you gay, it just says that you have taste. I too appreciate a good set of perky boobs and bootilicious girls, that doesn't mean I'm secretly straight.  Right now, you're constantly in fear that you're gonna ""turn gay"" or ""Be Bisexual"". The real way to solve this issue is only to face it and find a way to get a closure on it (mentally or physically).  Good luck figuring what you are but seriously, labels aren't that important nowadays."
gay,3cmu9r,FateJace,-4,Thu Jul 9 05:27:37 2015 UTC,"I suppose I'm a little afraid of the ""just a little gay."" I keep hearing that it's normal/common, but it is still unsettling.   By the way, no I didn't mean a boner. I've never had a boner from a guy. I meant more like a slight tingling in my groin, but never any blood rushed down there.   I'm afraid to experiment because I feel it is almost unnecessary and would cause me great anxiety and distress, more so then."
gay,3cmu9r,FateJace,2,Thu Jul 9 05:47:21 2015 UTC,"You are over thinking things.   Your problem doesn't resolve around yourself being gay, your main problem is you being very homophobic.  Perhaps it's the name calling, perhaps it's because how people tease you for being timid/shy/introvert but seriously, that doesn't give you any rights to feel like being gay is a bad/negative thing.   If you should do anything, you should fight the bullies but not quickly segregate yourself from being classified as one of us. The bullies are at fault here, not the homosexuals."

gay,3cmu9r,jaycatt7,4,Thu Jul 9 06:42:48 2015 UTC,"Now listen, I adore you for being polite throughout our conversation but really, admitting your fear towards homosexuality is the only way you're going to end this distress/ vicious cycle of you doubting your sexuality.  The root of your stress/HOCD is really just the fear that you have for homosexual. That is a thing that you really have to agree with me. You have to understand that being afraid of gay people doesn't make you a bad person unless you go out of your way to express hate & stop people from being gay; I'm sure you're not ""that kind"" of person.  Fear normally comes from a thing that you barely know/a thing that might potentially harm you. The easiest way to overcome your fear is to admit it, understand it and then get over it.  Eg, if one is afraid of heights, he/she can challenge themselves by trying out different activities. Take the risk and climb a tree, roller coasters, bungee jumping or even sky diving.  I'm not asking you to kiss a guy, cuddle with a guy or have sex with a guy. I'm not even asking you to watch gay porn or whatsoever. It would be great for you to be in touch with the gay community, open up yourself to hang out with some gay people. Once you know us, you'll realize that we're not that different from you and we're not that scary after all.   I find licking a vagina gross so it's only fair for you to think what I do is disgusting too  We are just different and that is okay."

I admit I do put a lot of care into what people think of me,  But even after understanding this, my opinion on the matter stands.

It may be a tad bit frustrating at your age and you may not understand yourself, but really its no big deal. You attracted to physically fit guys, larger dicks, so what.

Find a therapist who specializes in that kind of thing if you haven't already.  You say women turn you on but not men. You say you're into women romantically, but not men.   Feeling friendship for a guy doesn't cut it. Getting a little aroused at a cock doesn't cut it--you've got one of your own, presumably, and some people just get aroused by anything sexual. Likewise, your anal stimulation just proves you have an asshole (and, presumably, a prostate).  I can't read your mind, but you really, really don't sound gay to me. And it sounds like this is causing you a lot of needless distress.  I know telling somebody with anxiety to just relax is useless and insulting, but I really wish I could help you let go of this thing."

That doesn't mean I'm straight or that I'd ever want a relationship or sex with a woman, it just means I'm a little bit bi.

It seems a lot of Christians have their beliefs before they ""interpret"" the Bible. So far Jesus is a capitalist, a socialist, a homophobe, a LGBT rights activist, a misogynist, a gender egalitarian, a conservative, a progressive, so on.  I can't say I saw any of those things clearly in the Bible, Jesus was a fairly morally ambiguous character. He did some good things but some really awful things too. The story of Legion and the pigs story was the one that hit me most, it left my stomach churning."

Being black and gay, I would imagine, is a different experience than being white and gay.   Either way, I agree that the article wasn't well-written."
gay,3c7tnr,freshtopperz,1 point,Mon Jul 6 06:03:37 2015 UTC,"I can appreciate where you're coming from, but the difference is that the gay community used to exclude to literally create a safe space.  While certainly not the case in all cities, there are many areas where gay and straight bars have blurred their populations.  You wouldn't necessarily see a gay bar that had someone's sexual orientation be a determining factor for admittance.  That, imo, goes against the idea that everyone should be accepted as they are."

gay,3c97jb,Princeso_Bubblegum,1 point,Mon Jul 6 05:22:31 2015 UTC,"Personally, I think the one thing that identify gender (social norm) is the genitalia and nothing else. You're labelled as male if your doctor sees a penis and female when they don't; ever since you're born.  What is homosexuality exactly? I personally define it as a sexual attraction towards the same gender. I'm a male, I'm attracted to males (people with penis) and thus I'm gay.  Masculinity/Femininity is more of a preference and the acts that define either changes VERY QUICKLY with time. Example? Cooking.  Cooking used to be a very feminine thing, women were supposed to be in the kitchen, whipping up meals for the family. How about now? A lot of the top chefs are actually male, men that cooks nowadays are portrayed as gentleman, good men, husband material and even, sexy.  What I'm saying is, sexual orientation should not be confused with gender roles. Two very masculine men can be together as a couple, so can two very feminine men; A masculine + feminine men pair of gay couple doesn't mean one's the man and another is the woman. The general idea of being in a gay relationship is that it involves 2 men.  There are a lot more than just gay & straight than you see on TV. There are Bisexuals, Asexual, Pansexual, Hetero-romantic Homosexuals, ETC. We can never define ALL of them.  To put it into a simpler way for you to ponder on this, think about food. Most of us are carnivorous in general, but food preference is unique to everybody. Let just say I'm a vegetarian, me loving Vegan Bacon doesn't make me ""secretly a meat lover"".  I don't know what kind of gender bener, futa & trap that you like, but yeah You like what you like. You don't have to label yourself as gay/pans/asexual or anything, just do whatever you like as long as it doesn't harm anybody."

I'm sorry about your past but I am really glad that you came out and be truthful to yourself in the end. Virtual Hugs I love the paragraph of how you think the word ""gay"" couldn't be a more proper word to describe what we are.  Now onto your problem, coming out to your parents. By now, you should've seen a number of coming out to parents on YouTube. One thing that I have to highlight is, there are a mix of both sides shown on YouTube. We've seen a couple of successful come out stories, whereby their parents accept who they are, they hug, they cry, things are great.  However, a lot of people that got denied by their parents do not have the chance to film it and post it on internet, reason being    Things got violent They got kicked out of the house (VideoCam/Wifi Not Accessible) They felt ashamed of doing so.   I've came out to my parents and yeah they are the typical homophobes. They couldn't accept the fact that I'm gay, my mom actually said to me ""Why, Why are you so disgusting?"" All in all, I told them and they couldn't accept it but yeah they still love me; they thanked me for being honest with them though.  Now, a year past that incident, my parents are still trying to be ignorant and pretty much shoved me back into the closet. I'm currently still living with them, they still love me very much but yeah, they can never accept the gay part of me.  I guess my advice is do what you need to do, tell them. However, be prepared for the worst case scenario; learn to defend yourself. Take your stand, being gay is not a choice, eventually they will understand that accepting you for who you are is the only way to keep the family together."

Sometimes they turn out to be decent people and become Friends, but then No more sex with them. 2) Full communication and trust.  Open Communication channels at all times. No secrets, and Even when you dont understand your own feelings, talk about it... ""when x did x I felt strange"". I have absolute trust in my partner to be open and honest with me, and even if he Fucks the hottest ever I know he wants to spend the rest of his life with me, so I have no insecurities there. More likely he will tell me about Fucking the hot guy and try to arrange it again withe so I can enjoy him too.  We also both have a veto. If for some reason We dont want The other to meet a certain guy We have a veto.  And lastly be ready to justify yourself to others.

He's probably a nice person so he's not telling you that you are coming on too strong and that your relationship should be at a lower key level."

It doesn't matter what their sexual orientation or gender is: the larger your social network, the greater the chance that you'll meet other gay guys.  Aside from that, ""good"" places to meet people: on-campus gay parties or organizations, inter-college mixers, Grindr and OkCupid.  I've found the most success when I'm actually out and about (pun fully intended) meeting people in the physical world.

gay,3c4oxi,backwards_ninja,13,Sat Jul 4 19:25:28 2015 UTC,"Dude, actually saying ""I'm gay"" and coming to terms with that is scary as shit.  You've admitted you aren't bi, and that's always the start - that took me six or seven years to do.    You don't need a relationship quickly.  Take it from somebody else who dreaded telling people, it's better to have a slightly narrower focus to start.  Get used to hearing yourself say ""I'm gay"" out loud.  Then you can start telling people.    I can't really help on relationships - I've never been in one either, but when I get back to school I'm going to try OKCupid because I'm shy around people I don't know well.  If it helps, I waited until I noticed two things.  One, during my semester abroad I noticed that my self esteem issues were mostly gone.  Two, I started making gay jokes openly around friends and siblings.  Once you figure out what your big stumbling blocks are and start dealing with them, then it's time to think about a relationship.  And good luck.  If you can just keep grinding away at issues, eventually you'll make things better."
gay,3c4oxi,meatb4ll,7,Sat Jul 4 21:54:08 2015 UTC,"if you don't want to do anal then don't do anal.  You do the sex acts that you are comfortable with.  There are some gay men out there that don't like anal. most of your reasons why you don't want to be gay are because you are in a small town and are worried about how others will see you.  give it some time, look around on apps and lgbt groups and in large nearby cities. a life worth living is not easy."
gay,3c4oxi,zomboi,6,Sat Jul 4 21:46:28 2015 UTC,Why are you acting like getting a boyfriend or having sex is somehow compulsory? Be yourself and only do what makes you comfortable while also avoid denial or lying if you can.
gay,3c4oxi,TraverseTown,6,Sun Jul 5 00:09:57 2015 UTC,"The hardest part of being gay is coming to terms and saying ""I'm gay."" You don't hate the fact that you are gay, you hate the fact that you feel as though society will not accept you for being gay and you feel like it's a broken way of living. I felt the exact same way, but in reality, you will find a great boyfriend because he will find you and you'll see it; you'll see that you two belong together. And the sex won't be as bad as you think it is; sex is about the one you love in reality and if you love someone, then the sex is bound to be good. So don't be scared of being gay, and don't say you don't want to be it. You have to be proud with who you are! You've got this, no doubt!"

Being gay  does not automatically equate to ""getting a boyfriend and having copious amounts of anal sex"". It does to some, but not to all. When you date you can set rules about what you enjoy sexually, and what you don't. Also, tastes change as you get older and you may end up enjoying forms of anal sex, or, you might not. It's not a big deal at the end of the day.  Be gay. Be yourself. Be happy. Don't let a list of preconceived notions ruin the future for you."
gay,3c4oxi,starscream_nz,2,Mon Jul 6 07:00:11 2015 UTC,"We're all weird - we all worry about finding connection and being loved. Figuring out who you are is hard and can take a lifetime for some people. Congratulations on acknowledging an important part of yourself - many go through much of their lives without doing that.   Finding a boyfriend or connection will come in it's time - don't stress about it. As for sex, 20%-25% of gay men don't engage in anal sex - a minority, but not as uncommon as a lot of people think. When the time comes, you may say yes, this is something I want to explore, or no, this doesn't do anything erotic me. Give yourself some time. You are just beginning your journey, have some compassion for yourself."

I tried to lie myself through teenagehood, and it wasted a lot of my time and the time of the girls who were into me. It'll cause you and others unnecessary pain in the long run. Besides, having a boyfriend isn't a be all or end all. There are many people who haven't even had their first kiss yet, even at the age of 17+.   Just be patient. As for the anal, well... Experiment first, figure out what you're comfortable with. There are many gay guys who do not like anal at all, and some swear by it--it all depends on the person. Give it a shot yourself before thinking of trying it, too."

If I could go back and change anything (not that I am a white haired old goat), that would be the one thing I would change.  I got the lover, and then we made friendships.  It would have gone much better the other way around."
gay,3c4oxi,corathus59,1 point,Sun Jul 5 14:31:39 2015 UTC,"Don't rush or worry about sex.  Sex is a sweaty, vigorous exchange of bodily fluid.  It is gross...  unless you're doing it with someone who you like so much that grossness just doesn't apply to them.  Remember that straight kids had a lot of time to get used to the idea of vaginas and girls and all of that, but for a long time they thought kissing and all of that gross, too.  It doesn't have to be anal, or very often.  Straight people have anal too -- in fact, they have more anal than gay people (because there are more straight people out there).  Some gay guys are more fastidious about cleanliness than others.  A lot of guys who are really into the bottom role are careful about the diet, douche, keep a schedule, etc, and are clean as a whistle any time they're ready to go.  Still, people soak up a lot of anti-anal bias and it takes some experience and time with other perspectives to break free of that mindset, so be patient with yourself on that.  Being gay means you get way more head, probably.  You should read old episodes of Dan Savages Savage Love column at http://thestranger.com.  He's gay and especially in the older articles, takes lots of gay questions.  I think it's interesting to see what kind of problems other people are having and his take is always interesting and educational.  Yes, it can be hard to find a boyfriend, but if you're college, you probably have a really good body.  You're in the prime of your life.  Don't waste a bunch of time feeling defeated.  You're going to have to learn how to hit on guys (gently).  Spend time at places (gym, board game group, whatever) so that you're somewhat familiar to people.  Smile at guys you like.  Learn to pay some, innocent compliments.  Flirting happens when you put a tiny bit out, and they put a tiny bit out, and things keep going.  Ask guys about themselves.  Get them to talk about things they like and like to do.  If someone is interested in you, they're way more likely to respond and make excuses to hang out with you.  The odds are harder, but at about 5% of guys being gay, that's still 1:20.  I think gay guys are more respective to flirting and dating prospects in compensation for the longer odds.  It's way too easy to shoot people down or flake or be completely superficial on a dating app, and trying to talk to people on them leaves a lot of people feeling depressed, but they can be handy for trying to scope out who to talk to in real life.  When you start dating, take it slow.  Tell them where you're at.  Communication is key.  If you talk, then people have the right expectations.  If you can learn to pay small compliments (tell guys they're funny, or you like their shirt, or something they did was cool), you'll be fine.  Very, very few guys freak out even if you hit on them overtly.  Even more straight guys are happy to take a compliment.  Guys only freak out when they (rationally or irrationally) feel threatened.  Have fun, be safe!"
gay,3c4oxi,scrottie,1 point,Mon Jul 6 01:45:38 2015 UTC,"Plus I know when I do find a boyfriend the sex I'll have to have will be anal and I'm not sure I'll want to do that but I guess I will :/   Hey, listen, if you are attracted to guys, don’t sweat it. But don’t feel obligated to rush into whatever sex you feel is necessary. If you would rather pursue a romantic relationship before sex, that is your decision, and don’t let anybody tell you any different. If you are going to have sex, it should be the way both you and your partner want it, not the way everyone else wants it.  Don’t feel obligated to fulfill someone else’s expectations of a gay person."

gay,3c14w4,_Auron_,1 point,Tue Jul 7 08:29:47 2015 UTC,"When I was a teenager (I am now 26), the idea of coming out was frightening. Many gay people can say that but not fully explain why.  Society generally regards everyone by default to be straight (especially those who are tightly religious and holding onto beliefs from countless generations ago), so likely the persona everyone forms of you is that you are straight. Coming out can cause a shock to them and a betrayal to them as if you intentionally wanted to hide this from them or that you may be hiding other secrets. Coming out means you might lose friends, and early in life you are still trying to find comfort in who you are and create a foundation for yourself.  A huge part of your current life foundation and sense of security is your family because they are there every day of your life, have been since you were born, and that is a majority of your life. If this concept of betrayal emerges and you get backlash and rejection, suddenly the foundation under you crumbles or even vanishes and you go into a free-fall, mentally and socially. This is scary to anyone. Because family is in your life whether you want them to be or not, risking opposition and shattering your current life foundation is something you don't want, but want to be true to who you are, this causes conflict in yourself.  Friends who don't know may be more supportive because they chose to be a part of your life and enjoy you as a person. Friends also come and go (as you'll find out in adulthood) due to endless factors that come with life. It would probably be in your best interest to out yourself to close friends you trust most, first. This is where you will find out where your truest friends are. Today's society is far more accepting than in the past, but also you should remember the betrayal aspect I mentioned. This may be an initial shock to that friend at first, but they may calm down days/weeks later after they absorb this newfound fact about you. The best of friends will shrug it off and be happy that you're finding acceptance in yourself.  Out yourself to friends first to get a feel for reactions and to get a close support group, even if mild. This will help strengthen you from the inside, and feel more comfortable about outing yourself to your parents and family. Now, your parents (as many unfortunately do) may have a narrow idea of who you should be and what you should do with your life in THEIR vision, despite you being a sentient individual with your own rights and freedoms to be what you want to be and like what you want to like.  To prepare yourself in outing to them, write out or act out with a friend potential backlash they may have when you do out yourself, and how you may respond to to their backlash. Things to explain are that you are a person with your own life, your own visions, and you are who you are and like what you like. They may say it's just a phase or fad because of the grants in equality lately, they may say you're confused or that you're an atrocity and not worthy of their image or the family you live in. You want to be prepared to tell them that you're being true to yourself and others, and that you understand if they are confused or horrified if they didn't expect or want you to be gay, but remind them that you are an individual just like everyone else on this planet and that they can't make you be someone you're not.  In the worst case scenario if they disown you or summon the family to hate upon you, I would plan this outing ahead of time with those 'truest' friends I mentioned earlier and see if you may have a place to stay as a backup plan. It sucks to have to even think of that possibility but I just want to address every angle so you aren't bewildered by finding who you are doesn't match with their exact vision of the baby they raised. Having a backup 'foundation' on the side with friends can ease the stress that is coming to terms with oneself.   I wish you the best of luck and love, and remember that you can be strong and defend YOU better than anyone else could ever dream of."

There's a concept in psychology (I forget what the concept is called) that basically says that when a person performs an action, their feelings and opinions will change to align themselves with the action. For example, if a teacher makes you write an essay in support of an argument that you disagree with, your attitudes toward that subject will subconsciously begin to align themselves with whatever you wrote.  So basically, acting like you're accepting of gay people will cause you to actually become accepting of gay people. It may not happen immediately, but it will happen over time."

This question can be used on a lot a lot of things, you can simply change the XXX to any sort of thing that was not socially accepted in the past, for eg, Anti-Slavery, Racial Equality, Woman rights, interracial Marriage.  To answer your question, I think it's a mix of both. The young adults are starting to be more accepting and hence the next generation will be taught to think the same way.

gay,3bx1pk,FateJace,1 point,Fri Jul 3 07:23:05 2015 UTC,"When people grow up without security or safety or education their morals tend to be simple and rigid. Which makes sense given their environment. The allowed behaviours may mean that huge swathes of technically harmless or even positive behaviours are excluded. But that doesn't matter because their rigid simple rules mostly keep them safe without too much thought.   When people grow up in safety and well educated their morals allow for more flexibility, experimentation and complexity. It allows the behavioural constraints to more closely match underlying benefits and harms. No need to blindly follow blunt ancient rules, and greater overall prosperity can emerge.   Most of us live in places where the youth have lived in safer times with more access to education. Liberal acceptance of the truth of differences is inevitable in those circumstances."

gay,3bslv8,FateJace,3,Thu Jul 2 01:43:18 2015 UTC,"The debate happened in our Chamber of Deputies, where the main subject was a law project called ""the family statute"", which was made by christian deputies who claim to speak in the name of the ""traditional family"". But the main goal of such project is actually to consider a family only those where there's a male-female couple, being it a way to revoke the legality of gay marriage, since it's been legal for gay couples to get married in Brazil since 2013 by a decision of our Supreme Court.       In that picture, the pastor was claiming that nowadays in Brazil you can say anything about christians, about churches, about pastors but if you say anything about homo/trans people you're called an homophobe, so he talked about another law project, which he calls ""Christ-fobia"" (yeah, there is such law project in a country where more than 80% of the population is christian)    It's just a joke that such person is given the spotlight to express his hate speech disguised as opinions... To help you figure out the kind of person he is, whatch this perfume ad: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4b8BMnolDI It's a campaign made during Valentine's day in Brazil where there is a gay and a lesbian couple simply hugging each other.

While many people are accepting of LGBT+ people, they don't ever say so, because it isn't a fun conversation to have. As a result, something like the rainbow filter is an easy way for anyone to say something that they likely wouldn't make the effort to say.

I do realize a large portion joined in just for fun and didn't donate however we cannot overlook the public awareness that came together with the ALS challenge.  Same thing with the rainbow filter that's up on Facebook. It's main purpose is to give awareness to Not only Americans but people around the world to see that YES, Equality is celebrated widely across America. Yes, the CEO supports equality and yes, you can spread the joy too, by rainbow-fying your profile pictures.  You won't understand the kind of comfort when you see people around you all rainbowfied their Profile Pictures one by one. Living in Malaysia, I was in a conflict whether I should rainbowfied my Profile pic too.  When I saw my friends, even the straight ones rainbowfied there pictures to show support, you won't understand how much that means to me and how much I appreciate their action.

gay,3br99b,Computerme,1 point,Thu Jul 2 02:34:33 2015 UTC,"I think there is a difference between the ice bucket challenge or other fads, and this one. The main difference is that there are LGBT people out there, mostly kids, who live in fear and isolation. We LGBT folks have all been there (in the closet) and it is difficult and painful, and, sadly, some of us don't make it through that period in our lives. So, LGBT people have an obligation to be visible and out so that others who cannot yet be out or have a voice can see that it is possible to have a life filled with happiness and joy with loving support.  If we can get straight people to be allies in that cause, then that's good for everyone and may just prevent some kids from feeling like they're alone in this world. And, when you're in the closet and isolated, the slightest hint of support for LGBT causes can mean so much, while the slightest sentiment against gay people can be absolutely devastating. So, I think it's a great thing, particularly for those who may be questioning."

I'm 18, going to college in less than 2 months, I'm comfortable with my sexuality, and it's still been incredibly encouraging to see how many people here are supportive, so my thinking is that if it makes me feel that good, how great is it for that young middle school or high school student who's been told by everyone his whole life that people like him are going straight to hell?

I can certainly recommend some good starting points, though.      Michael Bronski's A Queer History of the United States would be a good place to start. It's US focused, but does a good job introducing concepts central to LGBTQ historiography. Another good entry level work, specifically on trans history is Susan Stryker's Transgender History. Lillian Faderman's Odd Girls and Twilight Lovers is a really great look at American lesbian history. I think those would be the ones I would recommend for entry-level reading on American LGBTQ history.

gay,3bka0r,macho_horse,2,Mon Jun 29 22:26:26 2015 UTC,"There are quite a few support organizations you can find. Somewhere you could easily get to quietly after school and talk to a counselor there. I think it would be a good thing for you to try and talk to someone who's in the flesh, and can give you valuable advice."
gay,3bka0r,AdenJames,2,Tue Jun 30 00:08:34 2015 UTC,"Hi hun, I'm very sorry that you feel this way but really the best way for you to be safe is to keep this a little secret until you're independent.  You can't trust any of your school friends, Yes. If it's a secret it's meant to be hidden. Don't tell anybody just yet, at your age just try to put your effort into studies and enjoying the part of life that you can (gaming/sleeping in/heading out with friends). I'm sorry but you have to put your relationship aspect on hold for now.  Don't fight back too much but you should know that there's nothing wrong with you despite all the hate that you get. Keep it all together. You will learn to be stronger, you will learn to be more independent and you will learn to be a better person and success one day by brewing positive energy within you.  Of course, you need a vent. You can make friends online. You can post on forums. Search for a vent to anonymous people that will bring you any sort of relieve. All in all, be strong, don't give up. :)"
gay,3bka0r,FateJace,2,Tue Jun 30 02:59:46 2015 UTC,"the only addition I have to this amazing advice is that a lot of parents say homophobic stuff without realizing it. Here in the US the 12-25 year old age bracket is forcing older generations to disbelieve everything they have thought for 40 years or more. Its a long process and it takes time. I know that my parents were not the most supportive when I first came out, but their love for me was so strong that they eventually left the church, because they felt it exclusive of anyone who believes in genuine equality. I am not saying your parents will do that, but you dont know until you give them the chance.  With that being said, I waited to come out until I was self supporting because I wanted them to know that although their input is important to me, they do not govern or control my life."

My mother would always stupidly say things like ""God I'm glad you're not gay"" when watching TV shows like Will and Grace... Eventually, the secret did come out, but only when I was a bit older and had some control in my life. I couldn't imagine telling her sooner and being completely stuck in the house with nowhere to go. Would not have been a good.   You already have some good advice here and just thought I'd add my two cents and echo it a bit. Wait a while. You're young. No need to rush things."

gay,3bk4w9,mikesmith13,2,Mon Jun 29 21:47:11 2015 UTC,"I don't do advice, I do opinion.  My opinion needs a bit of context. I came out to my parents when I was 17. It was before the summer vacations, around April maybe. They took it way better than I expected and they were basically OK with it. Then we all went away for the vacations, and as you described, I felt every interaction was awkward. I didn't do anything about it until I felt it was way too much and I ended up crying in the middle of a family reunion. Good thinking sjalfrander, good thinking.  My opinion is this: you should go talk to them. You should clear the air. Ask them if this is awkward. Ask them to be honest. Be ready to answer their questions and some of them might be offensive but they won't mean any offense. Don't be the same idiot I was.   Good luck. And if you feel the need to talk, or vent, or whatever, my inbox is open."
gay,3bk4w9,sjalsfrander,2,Mon Jun 29 21:57:18 2015 UTC,"I often make things awkward just by making a big deal of it. Simply moving on, showing them you're ok, you treat them as before will help straightening things up. You need their support for this, but they need yours as well."
gay,3bk4w9,tom-cz,2,Mon Jun 29 22:08:52 2015 UTC,"Hi, Mike. So you said,    So I came out to my parents, who surprisingly took it better than I thought they would   Since we do not know what you were expecting at first, we do not exactly know how good is the ""better"" that we're looking at. It would be better for us to give advice if you can be more specific with their response. Were they like   *Okay *We still love you *We love you no matter what Darling *Ok, but it's best we don't talk about it  You also mentioned that    Every interaction is awkward and I've been avoiding them. I keep thinking I did something wrong.   You did nothing wrong honey, you did something brave and you did something truthful. However, your parents need time to adjust to the abrupt changes that happened and so do you.  I too felt guilty after coming out to my parents, they were still loving but I felt very bad about myself. I shattered their dreams of having a daughter in law, I raped a sister-in-law from my sisters where they were eager to go shopping with and I also killed my parent's dream of having grandchildren.  None of those were done intentionally, those were ""their dreams"" what they expected/wanted from you. You did not promise that you can give those things to them, you did not owe them a Mrs. Smith or baby Mikes.  However, you can still give them loads and loads of love. Now that you are truthful to them, you are all open up, less secrets. Just be you and be happy. Happiness is contagious, I'm sure it will spread to your family members too."
gay,3bk4w9,FateJace,1 point,Tue Jun 30 06:51:15 2015 UTC,"There's already some really great advice in this thread, but I wanted to add one more thing.  Awkwardness in a two sided coin, is it them that's being awkward or is it you, or is it both?  Being emotionally attached to people, like parents and loved ones, we can often expect them to respond a certain way, when they don't respond the way we expect, we get thrown off and then we give off that sense of discomfort, which in turn causes them discomfort.  You know, that whole empathy thing.   Coming out to your parents is always be a bit... tumultuous, you never know how they're going to respond.  You say you're feeling a bit of regret about telling them, so it leads me to think that it's possible that the awkwardness is a personal thing, more then a them thing."

gay,3bgqpi,Davie_Doobie,2,Mon Jun 29 02:06:55 2015 UTC,"Yes! Coming out doesn't always bring instant relief. It's a big, stressful thing. Sometimes that takes a while to process, even if the reaction is good.  I don't know how to help, really, except to say that I've never talked to anybody for whom the feelings didn't settle back to normal with time. I suspect you'll be the same way."
gay,3bgqpi,jaycatt7,1 point,Mon Jun 29 02:10:07 2015 UTC,"It was very stressful, very hard to do. I've developed friendships with other gay people over the years and I think that helped me build confidence in myself, at least thats how I feel. Every time someone talked to me from their confident point of view, it rubbed off on my until I made it to this point. However one thing that made it hard was constantly hearing people talk about ""finding your real friends"". As much as I should have been embracing an opportunity like that, I didn't want to sacrifice friendships for something that was unrelated to them. I hope that makes sense, it can be so hard for me to word whats in my head sometimes. Anyway after I told him, I didn't feel like a huge burden had been removed or like I had been liberated. I was very vulnerable. However I can say that other things felt reaffirmed after I came out to him. It was like everything I am and everything I'm trying to achieve was strengthen and refreshed. It doesn't feel like I'm being sneaky anymore. Being in the closet alway felt like I was doing something wrong and I was going to get caught, I always hated that feeling. I don't feel so much like that anymore."

I remember looking the mirror when I was probably 10 years old and thinking ""I hope I'm not gay"". So for him to feel that its not a big deal, I can't fathom how its not. To me its the burden I've been carrying for 10 years. Carrying through every day, hiding through every discussion, every smile, every laugh, every tear, every night when I fall asleep and every waking moments that follows. And thank you buddy. You've already been so nice this far, the cake day mention was the icing on the....well, cake."

Coming out wasn't too big of a hurdle for you compared to a lot of others, you did it well, and it also thankfully turned out well.  However, this ""forbidden"" path of life suddenly opens up all so quickly! You are shock with the options that you now have, you are perhaps also a little shaken about what is next? Now that you're out, there's no going back in, it actually felt a little more ""dangerous"" than back then when the secret was in.  This is completely normal, don't get freaked out by it. All you need is time, love is not something that you want to rush. It comes naturally."

I just don't know. Even now that I told my friend about my secret, I still feel just as closeted as I did before. Which is why I think being in the closet may not have been my problem? I don't know. This is all so difficult. Even right now I could almost break down because I'm sitting here trying to describe what it is thats hurting me, but all I really know for certain is that my heart aches. I'm sorry if this doesn't make sense, I'm just trying to word my feelings as best I can. Thank you for taking the time to talk to me. Regardless of coming out to my buddy, having another gay man (I presume?) here to support me is so nice. Its like a shoulder to lean on."

gay,3bfrme,TavixVi,9,Sun Jun 28 20:54:03 2015 UTC,"Bullshit.  Half of this relates to promiscuity and AIDS. Use protection, get tested regularly, and be careful with your partners, and it shouldn't be a problem.   Being more susceptible to STIs is not caused by being gay - it's a side effect of society's intolerance of gays. Historically, gays have had to keep their relationships a secret, living in a shadow world that increased the likelihood of risky behavior. Not only that, but when people aren't willing to come out as gay, the dating pool available to gays is much smaller, decreasing the chance that someone will be able to find a dedicated partner as opposed to an easy hookup. As homosexuality becomes increasingly normalized, it's going to be easier to find reliable individuals who will use safe sex practices.  The other half seems to be trying to say that homosexuals have more mental problems, regardless of the tolerance in their society (US vs Netherlands). This infographic gives painfully little information on the practices used in the study.   Edit: The article that is used to cite this ""finding"" is Homosexuality and Mental Health: A Cross-Cultural Review. The article is only available on one site from what I can see, and behind a paywall. And it's from 1988!!!!! That's 27 years ago.   Do you think there's any chance that U.S. and Netherlands societies will have changed in 27 years? You better believe it. I call bullshit again.  Here's the website it cites, which includes a statement on the ""Right to Treatment"" i.e. people's right to ex-gay conversion therapy.

The APA cast it out of their big book of mental illnesses in the 70s.  A better question is, why is this guy you're talking to so invested in his anti-LGBT sentiments that he has a big ol' infographic at hand?  An even better question: what the hell are you doing on 4chan? And is /r/4chan anything like the actual 4chan?"

gay,3bfrme,sjalsfrander,1 point,Mon Jun 29 00:04:54 2015 UTC,"Enclosed are some of my opinions about the infographics.  On Promiscuity & Fidelity  About 1/4 of gays have over 1000 partners and about 50% have 500 partners. Have you ever wondered how they come out with these numbers? What sort of source did they based on? Is it reliable? How did these gay people find 500 different gay peple to have sex with? How do they even keep track of how many strangers they have been having sex with? It's illogical to have such statistics.  Please note the source that these facts are dated from 1978. They don't even have much access to internet/Grindr/Jackd/Tinder, how are they going to find 1000 gay men to fuck with, unless straight men were involved too.  Again, please check the sources on fidelity, how long past have those sources been outdated.  On Homosexual & Mental Health  I agree to these statements, we do suffer more mental stress compared to straight people. Why? Because of non-accpetance, because there are a lot of us good people try wanting to be good by not acting gay when there's actually nothing wrong with being gay.  What these mental stresses normally leads to? Depression, anger, emotions that will lead you to do wrong things that relieves you even a little; Hence, Alcohol, Drug abuse and worst, suicides.  Think again, about the root cause of these mental stresses, why do we stress about all these. Why can't gay people just be happy the way they are and carry out their lives normally?  On Homosexual and Physical Health  This has been covered by Sleep1804 below, I'm not going to add much to that.  I've saved my strongest evidence that counters all these at the end. Please click on this link and tell me what you think about it.  Jack Evans and George Harris's Gay Marriage dated 26th June 2016  Video Footage of the marriage  Seriously, look at how happy everybody is."

A huge different of these are gay love involve 2 adults that are able to think logically and are capable to make decisions then be responsible for it.  Allowing a man to marry a child, a horse or a microwave simply does not make sense as the other party does not understand the true meaning behind ""I DO"". A one-way-manipulated marriage does not equal to what we are fighting for.  As for polygamy, we can line this up with moral (which changes with the norm of society). As far as I know, the norm of the society now is promoting being loyal, being faithful and hence, one-to-one marriage.  Then again, if 3 (or more) people can be happy with each other, not get jealous about the tip of affection, clear about what to do to maintain a good mental, physical health of all 3 members, I don't see why not."

But I was an idiot with that example. For one (per the first reply) the gay pedophile argument isn't even on the slippery slope (given that consent can't be given due to age). And then to I can see (and remember) how any kind of gay pedophile crap is hurtful to gays given how off base it is. ... Again, I can only apologize for even mentioning it. ...

From a legal perspective, I strongly disagree. There are very strong legal distinctions to make between same sex marriage and polygamist marriages or other ""forms of marriage""."
gay,3betsj,guoshe,1 point,Tue Jul 7 03:03:50 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. My bullets were more my top of the head thinking on what's right/normal/acceptable. I was trying to get at the back of the head thinking that would lead someone to construct the legal argument. (But I see that I did indeed -- incorrectly -- refer to it as the legal reasoning).  At any rate, I think the bullets I gave DO make a good argument for society to agree to gay marriage.   But then the whole point of my posting was to say the same thinking can take you farther down a slippery slope. I think polygamy IS clearly on that slippery slope. And for what it matters I could indeed support legalizing polygamy for the same reasons given in my bullet points. But I find gay marriage much easier to go along with.  But my (really bad) mistake in my my posting was trying to go down even farther on the slippery slope into territory that was just wrong (the pedophilia territory). My invalid reasons was quickly pointed out.  And getting my posting down voted  (a mere 17 percent up vote) means a lot of people disliked what I said so much they went to the trouble to shoot me down. Fair enough. Cost me some karma points. But it was worth it. I learned something from it."

Things like if one dies the others family cannot come in and seize assets that are rightfully the surviving partner. We did not need marriage to stay together, but we needed marriage to be able to visit our loved ones in a hospital, to be able to have the same protections. So if you build together and one dies the one who has died would have all the assets taken from them by the family members. Without marriage they were not deemed family and were barred from seeing their spouse in a hospital or being able to sign documents for them. We did not need this for love, we needed this for legal protection of property and rights of a surviving partner/caretaker partner.   - a youtube comment.

I work for a big company with a nondiscrimination policy, but not everybody's that lucky.  ...and we're really not done on marriage. A handful of states are outright refusing to comply with the Supreme Court ruling, and we've already got states like North Carolina that allow their local officials to opt out of marrying anybody based on their religious beliefs.

Virginia, 388 U.S. 1 (1967),  is a landmark civil rights decision of the United States Supreme Court, which invalidated laws prohibiting interracial marriage.  The case was brought by Mildred Loving, a black woman, and Richard Loving, a white man, who had been sentenced to a year in prison in Virginia for marrying each other. Their marriage violated the state's anti-miscegenation statute, the Racial Integrity Act of 1924, which prohibited marriage between people classified as ""white"" and people classified as ""colored"". The Supreme Court's unanimous decision determined that this prohibition was unconstitutional, reversing Pace v. Alabama (1883) and ending all race-based legal restrictions on marriage in the United States.  The decision was followed by an increase in interracial marriages in the U.S., and is remembered annually on Loving Day, June 12. It has been the subject of two movies, as well as several songs. Beginning in 2013, it was cited as precedent in U.S. federal court decisions holding restrictions on same-sex marriage in the United States unconstitutional, including in the 2015 Supreme Court decision Obergefell v. Hodges.    Image i     Relevant: Jeff Nichols | Pace v. Alabama | List of United States Supreme Court cases, volume 388   Parent commenter can toggle NSFW or delete.

gay,3ba92x,autowikibot,2,Sun Jun 28 11:48:45 2015 UTC,"Employment Non-Discrimination Act:       The Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA) is legislation proposed in the United States Congress that would prohibit discrimination in hiring and employment on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity by employers with at least 15 employees.  ENDA has been introduced in every Congress since 1994 except the 109th. Similar legislation has been introduced without passage since 1974.  The bill gained its best chance at passing after the Democratic Party gained the majority after twelve years of Republican majorities in the 2006 midterm elections. In 2007, gender identity protections were added to the legislation for the first time. Some sponsors believed that even with a Democratic majority, ENDA did not have enough votes to pass the House of Representatives with transgender inclusion and dropped it from the bill, which passed the House and then died in the Senate. President George W. Bush threatened to veto the measure. LGBT advocacy organizations and the LGBT community were divided over support of the modified bill.  In 2009, following Democratic gains in the 2008 elections, and after the divisiveness of the 2007 debate, Rep. Barney Frank introduced a transgender-inclusive version of ENDA. He introduced it again in 2011, and Sen. Jeff Merkley introduced it in the Senate. On November 7, 2013, Merkley's bill passed the Senate with bipartisan support by a vote of 64–32. President Barack Obama supports the bill's passage.    Image i     Relevant: Human Rights Campaign | Equal opportunity employment | Anchorage Unitarian Universalist Fellowship | Bash Back!

I'm not even going to get into legalizing pot, because I don't have enough time, but to prostitution. First, I'd like to make it clear that I am completely against human trafficking, but prostitution is different. Anyways, by legalizing gay marriage we are moving towards becoming a country that does not oppress sexuality--which is a GOOD thing. By legalizing prostitution, we are only allowing women to be paid for having sex, which isn't the end of the world. As long as they are doing it of their own free will and making the money for themselves, what's the harm? Now we have outlawed prostitution and we have shady operations going on with pimps beating their ""girls"" and nobody reporting it because they're afraid of being arrested for 'illegal activity'. So, in a way, legalizing prostiution should be our next step so we can work on making the conditions a bit safer for these women (and men). And--though he said it in a COMPLETELY inappropriate way--we're coming to a point as a society where being gay isn't a big deal, isn't that what we gays and lesbians should want?

gay,3b36e1,IHaveAJarOfDirt,11,Thu Jun 25 18:08:50 2015 UTC,"I want to try and be as measured as possible with this response.  Yes, it is possible for someone to identify one way at one time, and to have that identity change and evolve.  We know sexuality can be fluid, we know that sometimes navigating the overlap between gender and sexual identity can be confusing, and we know that being 14 itself is confusing as hell.  THAT SAID, please don't go to your friend and say something like, ""are you sure you're gay, you don't seem gay to me"" or ""are you sure you're not just going through a phase, I went through a gay-phase myself.""  You might have the best intentions, nothing but sincere affection for your friend, but you have to realize that words like the one's I just described are weapons.  Weapons which are routinely used to assault the self-esteem and identity of queer people, especially young queer people, by denying them the ability to define themselves.    Your friend clearly put a lot of trust in you, by telling you he's gay, you should repay that trust by taking him at his word and letting him define for himself the things he's feeling."

Certainly I've heard of people's sexualities changing and I guess if it changes quickly enough, you might call it a phase. That said, my best guess would be that the OP's friend, Chris, is actually gay and OP maybe has some expectations about gay people that don't always hold true (e.g. some gay guys are more masculine than some straight guys)."
gay,3b36e1,seanspotatobusiness,1 point,Thu Jun 25 21:21:07 2015 UTC,"My point was basically that while sexuality is fluid, if one felt attracted to the same sex at any point, he or she is probably not straight, even if they are just a little bi. That said, how someone chooses to label themselves is 100% their choice and nobody else's business, which is basically what I was trying to say to OP."

Could it be that when you were younger you just hadn't discovered your sexuality/were still in the girls are icky stage?   Anyway, if you are truly his friend you will simply accept him as who he is. When I came out I had a really hard time convincing my friends and family I was actually gay. That being said, my parents mentioned to my siblings that they believe me being gay is a stage brought on by a new friend I made, a woman. This is incredibly hurtful if I'm honest and thoughtless on their part.  As a summary of my point because I think I got lost for a bit there, accept him for who he is. Most don't change their sexuality once they figure it out. Don't make it harder on him than it needs to be."

gay,3b1x2e,arandowithakeyboard,2,Thu Jun 25 08:35:12 2015 UTC,"I guess I am not completely understanding the premise of the rant.   Television shows are guided almost entirely by the viewing habits of straight people. The fact that there is a disparity in how LGBT people are portrayed on television has nothing to do with the LGBT community's view of itself or any kind of internal conflict. We don't get to tell the TV networks how we would like ourselves to be portrayed.   So, maybe you can clarify a little bit?  EDIT: I will say this. As people who have historically been subject to unwarranted discrimination: yes we should be more sensitive to the double standard and hold ourselves to a higher standard of equality within and without the LGBT community. We should know better. Has it ever worked out this way in practice for any minority group subject to discrimination? Rarely."
gay,3b1x2e,night-shark,2,Thu Jun 25 19:46:20 2015 UTC,"Some people say this doesn't exist. When that is far from the truth. I find it really hard to make gay friends because so many of them say who they won't talk to (ex: blacks, Asians, overweight, trans, etc.). I feel that we are not all treated equally, when we fight for it so much. Racism in the community is really bad, but once again people don't want to admit that it exists when it definitely does. I feel like I'm a double minority (gay and black).  The world needs to realize that there are all kinds of lgbt families that are not like the ones on TV. Until people realize this, the world will continue to think we are all stereotypical people when we're not."
gay,3b1x2e,patbarnett,2,Thu Jun 25 13:46:44 2015 UTC,"You took this a level deeper, and I agree 100%. I run into this problem in a couple of places: born gay vs. choice and being ""straight acting"".  I hate both equally. I dont care why anyone, including myself, beds with the same sex. I find the arguments tiring and pointless. Honestly if I were to fall in love tomorrow with a woman I have that right, and should not be judged for it. I get stereotyped a lot for being good looking and ""normal/straight acting"". Sometimes I feel like im not part of the community, because I can survive without it... Its hard to create a TV show that is inclusive of everyone, when we cant stop hating ourselves."
gay,3b1x2e,Col_Crunch,0,Fri Jun 26 05:14:58 2015 UTC,"I have never met someone that plain won't talk to a group of people. If you are talking about apps like grindr that is different, those apps are primarily used for hooking up. To be honest I think that it is both arrogant and ignorant to say that someone on one of those apps (mainly looking for sex) says something like ""no black people"" or ""no Asians"" etc. Is racist.   Just like in the straight world there are white woman only attracted to black men, and black men attracted only to white women, and any other combination you can think of, we in the gay world have preferences too. I for instance am not attracted to black men in general. I wouldn't say that on grindr, cause I do like to just talk with people sometimes, but if I was exclusively looking for sex I might. I would probably word it better than ""no blacks"" but I would still convey my preference.  To be honest I don't think the problem is racism, I think it is hyper-sexualization. In the gay world it seems that we automatically assume that a gay guy talking to us is looking for sex or something, when sometimes he just wants to talk."
gay,3b1x2e,guoshe,0,Thu Jun 25 15:47:52 2015 UTC,"I have never met anyone..    listen. stop. your individual experience as someone unaffected is not valid enough to erase everyone else. what you're saying is akin to a straight person saying ""oh I've never met straight people that won't talk to gay people. QED it doesn't exist!"" what YOU see isn't everything that exists in the world.   to be honest I think it is both arrogant and ignorant that you say that racism isn't the problem (or a big problem). Maybe you can dismiss claims of racism because you don't experience it yourself?   saying ""no blacks""  or ""no asians"" IS racist in the sense that it marginalizes and alienates people. What's so hard to understand about that? beyond just this grindr thing, racism is a very real issue and you are actively doing harm by dismissing the claims and experiences of marginalized people because you can't empathise - - which, by the way, is exactly what straight people are doing to us.   Although I do agree that the sexualization thing is a problem. but we bring it upon ourselves, unfortunately"
gay,3b1x2e,night-shark,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:27:20 2015 UTC,"Pump your brakes. /u/patbarnett's clear assertion was that ""Racism in the community is really bad"". The clear implication here is that somehow, gay people are more inclined to be racist than other subcultures. That's a pretty damn strong implication to make and guess what - he's making it based on his individual experience.   So, if I may be so bold to make the presumption, I think the core of what ColCrunch was getting at is that he has seen no evidence to indicate that racism is ANY MORE a problem with gay men than it is with other groups. Now, if you have evidence to support the opposite, since the person making the claim is typically the one who bears the burden of providing evidence; fair. But you can't just berate someone for using their own personal experience as a reference point... and then substitute your own personal experience as the valid one.  No one said ""racism is not a problem IN GENERAL"". This is a discussion about whether or not gay men have a particular problem with racism that goes beyond what other subcultures experience."
gay,3b1x2e,Col_Crunch,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:43:10 2015 UTC,"That would be an accurate summation of my point.   And to address /u/guoshe's comment on the ""no [insert race here]"" on apps like grindr... These apps are for hooking up, let's not kid ourselves. If you are looking to have sex with someone you are obviously going to look for someone that you are physically attracted to. If said hookup app user is not attracted to black men he will at some point have to make his preference known, whether it is in conversation or on his profile."
gay,3b1x2e,night-shark,2,Thu Jun 25 18:52:35 2015 UTC,"That's where the disconnect lies. Grindr, Scruff... these are HOOK UP apps. They were designed with a primary objective in mind and that was to allow guys to meet other guys for sex. It's totally superficial and it never claimed to be anything else.  Now we've got a new evolution of users in these apps that see them just as much apps for socializing as for hooking up. And the guys who just want to chat and socialize are forgetting that not everyone on Grindr is looking to chat with you."
gay,3b1x2e,night-shark,0,Thu Jun 25 19:37:06 2015 UTC,"I have to agree. Granted, I'm going off my personal observations which, take that for what you will (so are the other posters here) but the only place I've ever seen this kind of problem with any prominence was on hook up or dating apps and it had to do with sex and sexual attraction, not more insidious discrimination.  Forgive me for saying it but occasionally it seems to me that one problem we DO have is a tinge of narcissism. I am constantly reading these opinion pieces ""The Gay Community Has a Problem with XYZ!"" or ""Why are other gays always so ABC!?"". The reality is, we didn't invent racism, materialism or superficiality. These problems exist often with just as much vigor in other subcultures. I think we just have a tendency to not look beyond our own subculture(s) and recognize that.   I remember one fellow posting about how gay guys had a real problem with making unwanted sexual advances - touching other guys without permission etc. As if this isn't something women have been dealing with since Neanderthals learned how to grope."

However, I would really like you to think when you consider things like   Although I want to be open about being gay, I feel that most people automatically think that I'm flamboyant and theatrical and loud   I don't know what kind of friends you're trying to make online but if those people will jump to conclusions that you're gay hence Flamboyant/theatrical/loud, they are not such good people to be friends to start with.  Also, this    Might therefore be turned off by that, or simply expect me to be such.   You're one of the gay community and we should all at least try to embrace the concept of ""people are different"". If those people mind flamboyant/queeny/feminine boy trait, do you think that they are open minded enough to accept you, a gay person as a friend? Also, imagine you hanging out with these friends one day and a flamboyant gay person pops out; they started teasing, muttering rude comments about that person, what will you do in that sort of situation? Do you really want to be friends with these kind of judgemental people?  A lot of people struggle with stereotypes in this world but don't you think it's a little funny when people try hard to escape from said stereotypes?

If I were to give you an advice, it would be your sexual preference should not be the first thing that others should know.  You should make friends, know about each other's personality and traits. Sexual preference should be a thing that slides in unexpectedly like, ""gtg, Boyfriend's waiting for me."" Instead of ""Hi, I'm gay""."

gay,3asmtl,JackAndy,-3,Tue Jun 23 12:23:43 2015 UTC,"Face it. You ARE trying to act straight. You're trying to not be the ""typical gay guy"". Whatever. Stop trying to deny that fact just to make yourself look like not an ass because that's the reality of what you're making it out to be since you believe the gay stereotype is ""loud, a queen, and likes theatre""."
gay,3asmtl,MTmind561,4,Tue Jun 23 06:13:55 2015 UTC,"If acting straight or masculine is merely a fabrication of a social construct as you're implying, wouldn't the opposite, acting feminine be equally artificial? Could we say either is more ""real""?"
gay,3asmtl,Fukkthisgame,3,Tue Jun 23 06:46:37 2015 UTC,"The reality Is that femininity and masculinity IS socially constructed. Yes. I don't remember saying the femininity was ""real"" and masculinity was not. If I implied that, my bad.  OP is referencing how he's not the stereotype of gay people, however. In this case, the stereotypical feminine gay man."
gay,3asmtl,MTmind561,1 point,Tue Jun 23 14:47:02 2015 UTC,"Bullshit. Testosterone and estrogen absolutely have an effect on your personality, and testosterone can be attributed to several ""masculine"" behaviors. Even going back as far as ancient tribes and hunter-gatherers, men and women had very different roles. Sure, activities that are percieved as masculine or feminine (like gardening or hunting) are social constructs, but attitude and personality are just as much a natural part of your sex."
gay,3asmtl,Fukkthisgame,1 point,Thu Jun 25 00:42:17 2015 UTC,"But how or what we define as masculine or feminine is really up to society to decide. A century ago having long hair, leg stockings, wearing high heels was a rich male trend. We GIVE it that meaning.  I'm not denying that, biologically, hormones don't affect our personality and attitude. That's beside the point. The key point is that what we call masculine or feminine activity is not solely based on biological reasoning. How much we gauge a masculine or feminine activity depends on how much SOCIETY sees it. In essence, I mean context. That's not to say that biology should be ignored though (it shouldn't). But how much testosterone or estrogen influences our actions does not mean one activity will ALWAYS be labelled as feminine or ALWAYS be considered masculine.   Hunter-gatherers and caregivers had different roles because the women beared children, not because women had more estrogen and men had more testosterone. You CAN say testosterone accounted for men's aggression, which induced them to naturally become hunter-gatherers though. But it was highly unlikely for a male to raise the children and have the women to go hunting."
gay,3asmtl,MTmind561,2,Fri Jun 26 20:43:37 2015 UTC,"Yes, what activities and styles we percieve as masculine and feminine are cultural. Of course. There's no denying that. Men in scotland wear skirts, and you wouldnt say shit to any of them or probably get a black eye. Gordon ramsey the chef is a badass.  What never changes, all throughout history and across almost every single culture, is the attitudes that are considered masculine or feminine. Whether men wore skirts or cargo pants, or loved cooking or construction, men are and always have been expected to be strong, independant, protective, hard working, gruff, in control if their emotions, and (when it applies) warriors and hunters.   This has remained the case throughout all of human history, regardless of culture. Testosterone and estrogen (the primary difference between men and women) are what give the sexes their huge psychological snd physical differences.   This idea of gender role dissipation, I think, is becoming really confusing for a lot of guys raised on that idea (especially gay men and young guys without masculine fathers) because weve confused cultural constructs of masculinity (like wearing skirts, etc) with actual, inherent masculine attitudes. We're essentially telling men that they should and can ignore/disregard their inherent masculine traits. It's stupid and counterproductive to tell men to act more like women, or vice versa.   Plenty of people, particularly those in line with the feminist line of thought and a good amount of the gay community, would be loath to admit that there are ANY differences between men and women, because that could be counterintuitive to the idea of total equality and discounting gender roles. But just because something makes us uncomfortable to think about doesn't mean we get to ignore it or pretend it isn't reality."
gay,3asmtl,Fukkthisgame,1 point,Fri Jun 26 21:17:47 2015 UTC,"I like you.  That's very true. But when someone decides to only date/involve themselves with other masculine parties purely to seem attune with their ""normalness"" or ""straight actingness"", then the act becomes less of ""having similar interests and activities"" but more to ""please society standards and individual outlook"" for the fear of becoming a stereotype (which OP openly believed in, which was why I had a problem with him). OP believed the stereotype that typical gay men are ""loud, theatrical, and flamboyant."" Whether or not that's a masculine or femininity identity, still induces offense that is deemed ""okay and normal to say"" and that he shouldn't feel otherwise.   Or maybe I'm just too sensitive. :( I think I got off-track with the other reply though but I understand the stance you're taking and will definitely take it into consideration."
gay,3asmtl,varianlogic,2,Fri Jun 26 22:41:25 2015 UTC,"What a refreshingly level headed response :)  If I'd add anything else, it would be that I think that for men, testosterone-based (for lack of a better term) masculinity should be supported in all males, no matter who they are. I think every man can stand to gain from embracing his masculinity and exploiting everything it has to offer. I honestly believe it can make for a strong, confident, successful indiviual and that's why it shouldn't ever be stifled, discouraged or marginalized.   Happy gay marriage day, brotha."

gay,3aq17j,odinmedina,3,Mon Jun 22 16:15:25 2015 UTC,"I can second this. It's also my favorite. What's most appealing about it for me is that it's one of the few real coming of age stories where the actors are actually young and not 29 year olds trying to pass for 17 yo's, so the suspension of disbelief was there. Another plus is that it doesn't involve the stereotypical flamboyant boy whose interests span drama, musicals and penis."

Not all trans* narratives are answered surgically, or even medically, and many trans* people identify as both, or in between male or female, which is fascinating but none of my business, so rather than use a word that implies a prescribed narrative, the asterisk allows more ambiguity and freedom."

He ends up marrying his best friend for a visa,  while st the same time falling in love with a Spanish architect. Despite the aloof summary I just gave it was a very thoughtful movie.   I saw someone else mention it but Naked as We Came was a another great film about a mother whose dying, her two estranged children and her house keeper. Two of the characters just happen to be gay a bigger focus of the film is the mothers relationship with each of her children and hidden family truths.  I also really liked The Falls, it was a film about two Mormons who fall in love while on their mission. Its similar to Latter Days but with less aloofness and both  main characters are Mormons.

First, you are in love with who you think this person could (should) be, not the person he (really) is.  Second, you are in Love with Love.  Think about these a bit, and see if it makes sense.  You are a very handsome man and deserve better (in my opinion)."

gay,3at2wd,dkentmm,2,Tue Jun 23 08:41:40 2015 UTC,"Not trying to throw myself a pity party, but the idea of being in Love with Love is probably whats causing me some harm. As I said in my story, I've been taking care of myself since I was 13. I had no one. Divorced parents. So my dad was out of the picture and my mom was umm.. well concerned about her and hers. So I was forced to grow up incredibly fast and raise my younger sister. Because I've been solo since such a young age, I never really received any love. Like I said, my mom was too busy doing her own thing. Plus she moved us out to California, at the time, and my whole family is here in Arizona. Anyway, I didn't receive any love from anyone and so as an adult, I crave it. And I need it. I'm such a mess. Lol. :P"

It's part of who I am and other people can deal with that. Besides, when I mention my being gay, I'm not saying anything lewd or sexual (as some might believe). I'm simply taking about my potential relationships, and there's nothing inappropriate about that.   However, I don't open conversation with: ""hello, I'm gay! Nice to meet you.""

gay,3anfud,Leonine09,5,Mon Jun 22 01:40:07 2015 UTC,"Sit and observe your family members in their conversations and take note of how frequently their sexuality is mentioned or inferred. It's quite possible they just think anything sexual should be kept off the street and aren't intentionally being homosuppressive, however what they may not realise is when they say ""This is my husband/girlfriend/partner"" this counts as talking about your sexuality.  For a lot of queer people, wanting to talk abotu their sexuality is not so much about seeking approval to demonstrate rimming at the bridal table of cousin Jessica's wedding, but it's about feeling free to casually reference one's boyfriend, potential mate, ex-boyfriend etc without fear of reproach.  Personally, I think it's appropriate to tell someone when you are safe to do so, and either when you want to open up to them, or if the topic is relevant. Simple as that."

However, the big question is, is it time. I always feel like I sound like a dork when I say this but I always get this gut feeling that it's time for me to tell someone. Admittedly, this doesn't happen to often only because I only tell people who are close to me and feel that I have built a close enough relationship with them that goes beyond your average friend, they become a part of my selected family. It's something that's sacred to me and I don't just throw it out there. But there have been cases were I am out with friends and a conversation strikes, I have been asked and have opened up but I have also denied it. It's all circumstantial for me, if I feel comfortable enough by all means, I'm proud! But there have been situations where I did not think it was necessary or that it could have led to some issues. Again, I may sound contradictory, but this is my personal way of going about it. I think this remains true for everyone else, it all depends on how you see fit."

Who enjoys being put on the spot like that, it's really uncomfortable and forced. Personally, if I feel like I have to force myself to say it for the sake of saying it then I avoid it,  it's not a forced type of conversation. It always has to come from a good place for me and I've been fortunate to have had people who have been nothing but supportive including my mom and sisters.

I don't know what their true reason behind it, be it ashamed or just to protect me, I still think coming out is very important and necessary as a gay man. Why? Because it is okay.  That being said, only do it when it is okay. If you are going to be fired/harmed when you're out, conceal it until you have the self-sustainability.   Life is too short for love to be a shame.

gay,3anpg1,i_am_the_milk_man,11,Mon Jun 22 00:28:56 2015 UTC,"When i came out to two of my straight guy friends. They both were very cool about it. The thing that helped me feel the best about it was that they, like you, just continued to interact with me the same way they did before as if nothing was different. That's the best thing you can do. Some gay guys like myself who have a posse of straight guy friends; it's very important to us that we feel just like ""one of the guys"". Society teaches us that being gay automatically makes that not possible. So it's part of why we dread coming out to straight guy friends. So just remind him that he's still one of the guys and that being one of the guys doesn't mean you can't be gay.  If you and your bros sit around and talk about hot girls all the time or whatever, without being weird or obvious about it, include him in that conversation if he doesn't speak up about it on his own. If he's like me, he might be afraid to talk about guys around you out of fear that it would disgust you, even if he knows you are ok with him being gay. Many people have varying levels of acceptance with homosexuality. I've had friends in the past who were like ""I don't care if you are gay, that's fine and i'm for gay rights, but i don't want to hear anything about gay sex or what guys you find hot other than being introduced to your eventual boyfriend. It's just a little weird for me"".   So if he's anything like me, he won't want to ask you outright what is and isn't ok for him to talk about. Sometimes just saying ""Nothing is going to change"" isn't enough because we all know people sometimes tell each other little white lies to avoid hurt feelings and such. So you might have to show him that it's ok for him to be 100% himself and that he doesn't need to censor himself around you and your group of friends.  Also, when i came out to some of my straight guy friends, i felt like what ever rules of our friendship or boundaries we had were all erased and like i needed to start over and i didn't know where to start and i ended up just being really quiet all the time and not being physically playful like i used to be until they showed me that it was ok to go back to normal. So if you notice him acting differently and far more reserved than usual, he might need you to help him re-establish the rules of your friendship. Hopefully this helps!"
gay,3anpg1,Y6Y1Y9,5,Mon Jun 22 02:57:30 2015 UTC,"Absolutely! I'll find a way to let him know that our friendship will not be restructured. I mentioned to him very straight forward that this didn't change anything between us and that I was extremely happy that he told me so he wouldn't feel like he was hiding himself from me. I think I'll just have to get used to someone telling me about his new boyfriend and the new guy he's dating and such. It's different, and not in a bad way, just a new perspective on the human experience to encounter."
gay,3anpg1,Timmeh,2,Mon Jun 22 04:59:14 2015 UTC,"This absolutely. There are a whole bunch of boundaries with this when it comes to straight buddies. Prolly three layers of comfort.   I dont mind if your gay, but i dont want to hear about it.  I dont mind if your gay, and id like you to bring your boyfriend to hang out.  I dont mind if your gay, and lets swap crazy stories about exes and sexual conquests."
gay,3anpg1,luctadeusz,3,Mon Jun 22 12:14:56 2015 UTC,"When I came out to my friends, they kinda just said ""ok, cool""  That's all you gotta do. He's still the same person, now you just know him a little better. And you seem to be aware of that. So just treat him like you always did. Don't act weird if he talks about boys, and even if you don't personally relate to whatever he is talking about, talk about it with him anyways. Don't be afraid of asking him about his relationships or crushes or whatever, but don't be weird and constantly try to make allusions to his being gay or try to hook him up with people or any of that.   I don't know what his story is, but on a personal note, I went through a few years of questioning before I managed to come out/admit to myself that I'm gay. And those were some of the hardest years of my life. And sometimes I talk to my friends about it. Now, all my friends (pretty much all of them), are straight girls, so they get me when I rant about boys, but not so much when/if I rant about LGBTQ+ problems. I don't know if your friend ever does/ever will do this, but it's helpful just to listen. My friends may not understand, but they listen and they try their best to get it, which is all I could ever ask for. Same goes for anything your friend talks about that might be a little foreign to you. Best of luck :)   P.S: BTW you seem like a wonderful friend. Good on you for being so loving and caring :)  TL;DR: he's the same guy you've always known, so there's no need for anything in your friendship to change. Act the same and be invested in his life (just like you probably already were), and everything will be a-ok.    EDIT: you could also feel free to explicitly say: ""you know this doesn't change anything between us, right? I always have and always will love and accept you for who you are regardless of your sexuality""   Say something like that, and I'm sure he will appreciate it.   Am I helping at all?"
gay,3anpg1,luctadeusz,3,Mon Jun 22 02:26:55 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply! Your edit was basically my verbatim reaction. I guess at the time of me posting this I didn't really know how to phrase what I was asking, but you helped answer my true questions to all this. Like, how do I go about asking about his relationships and stuff? I supposes the most correct answer would be the way that I would if I was asking him about anything else like I have for the past several years and just treating him like he's still one of the guys. Ultimately, I just didn't want to step on any toes :)"
gay,3anpg1,HoodedGryphon,2,Mon Jun 22 04:53:29 2015 UTC,"He is still one of the guys! If you wanna ask about a relationship, just go for it just like you would if he was straight. And even though you don't crush on dudes, don't act awkward when talking about it. After all, a relationship is a relationship, and that's not something that sexuality can/will change. One of my best [straight male] friends does just this. He's asked me about relationships and crushes. Just the other day he asked me if I was dating someone from our school, and after I told him that I'm not, he asked if I like him, if he's a cool guy, etc. Just normal stuff. Nothing crazy.  Don't worry about it man, I think you're doing just fine :)  EDIT: Don't be afraid to ask him questions, so long as they aren't invasive. If he uses some gay slang (ex: twink or bear or something), and you don't know what it means, you can ask him. It'll show that you are interested in learning about gay culture and whatnot, which is always nice."

Familiarized themselves with some lingo (I came out way before the animal thing, but e.g. find out what a 'bear' or 'twink' are so you can throw them into conversation). Get the group to go to a gay bar or club one night (equally, you could watch a gay pride event, go to one, watch Ru Paul's Drag Race together etc).

I was really taking my time to get to the point (we talking about pauses, the 'ughs' and such things). She would stare at me and you could read her expression like: 'Just please tell me what you want to  tell me' and when I finally spat it out she was just like ' Oh, thats cool, Im bi too!' It never really hit her until like 5 minutes and then she said ' Just so you know this is not changing anything between us' and she apologized for her reaction aswell.  Needless to say, I felt really comfortable coming out to her, because I really needed to come out to someone who wouldnt reject me."

He believes in Christianity and I was actually very nervous when I came out to him.  I told him ""Hey, I really like you, I think I'm gay. I know you're a Christian, and you guys believe that I'm going to hell. Will you hate me?""  He said, ""People that matters won't care, people that care won't matter"".  I cried and hugged him."

Are you seeing anyone now? That kind of thing) but pretty quickly fell back into normal conversation. That I think helped me a lot, cause I had thought it was going to be a big deal, but it really felt like nothing had changed between us.  On a different side, when I told my group of best friends, we had a serious moment of ""Thanks for letting us know, that's awesome of you."" But afterwards they made jokes about it (to clarify- our group dynamic is all about us just giving each other shit; they weren't being offensive for the sake of offense, it was for humor.) And that surprisingly was the most comforting thing to me. Obviously, if it's not your type relationship or if it's a sensitive subject for him, don't make jokes.   The point is to just make everything seem normal, maybe mention it a few times in some way so he knows it's not a 'forbidden subject' to you guys."

Seems like you're clearly uncomfortable about it, and you're not out of bounds at all. While it's not the same as giving someone head, it's also not something I'd like my monogamous boyfriend to do, regardless of the distance. To me, it's definitely still cheating.  Talk to him about it, set actual boundaries. It's great that you're being honest and telling each other these things, it's extremely important in a long distance relationship (been in one for 5 years). Just because you're far apart doesn't lend him or you special privileges. You guys should be on the exact same line of the same page when it comes to this stuff. Kissing other guys is as much a temptation as anything else, and not saying it will but, can lead to other things quite quickly."
gay,3ao2qy,youyouyuyu,1 point,Mon Jun 22 11:28:25 2015 UTC,"I think the temptation to open up the relationship is different for my boyfriend than it is for me.  We're both still very young.  Marriage isn't in the picture yet and we both want to know that we're going to be as happy as we can be.  For me though, the temptation to explore doesn't outweigh the need for a monogamous relationship.  He's my first boyfriend.  On the other hand, my boyfriend has never been in a committed relationship, though he's had quite a few boyfriends in the past. He's told me several times that he's never wanted to stay with someone the way he wants to stay with me, and I believe him.    My boyfriend has two very close friends, a married gay couple that he consults with about everything.  While they're married, they still let each other sleep around as long as they talk about it.  They've been married for 2 years now and are both very happy, and I'm afraid my boyfriend draws too much from their relationship.    I guess what I'm saying is that kissing isn't a big deal to my boyfriend, and I'm afraid if I give him a hard ""no"" on kissing other guys, he'll just be afraid to tell me if it happens again.  At the same time, I have to tell him something because it does make me very uncomfortable."

Honestly while he and anyone else is entitled to feel whatever they want about open relationships and kissing other men, you're not comfortable with it and he should take that to heart.   Don't let today's casual hookup society bully you, if he wants to stay with you then he should value your feelings and not kiss other guys...it isn't like he's required to make out with everyone he's attracted to. You can always rethink on your stance of open relationships but he can never take back a kiss.  And honestly if he's doing stuff like that and keeping it a secret because you don't like it, I suggest you reevaluate why you're with him. A relationship isn't one way, and while compromises should happen, disagreements on these types of ideas aren't a great basis for a healthy partnership."

However that doesn't mean we don't check guys out and flirt with them from time to time. We always tell each other after and we've agreed that nothing will ever come out of it. Once, we considered opening our relationship but finally agreed that it wasn't worth it and that it would probably ruin our relationship.  It's important to have an agreement. If you don't have one, make one. Sometimes I find it helpful to write down a list of my concerns and address them one by one.  That way, you can keep the conversation focused and organized."

I was convinced that if I wasn't married before I turned 30, I would kill myself. (I went through a breakup at 28 and ended up in a mental hospital after a suicide attempt.) Point is that was a lie. The reason my relationships didn't work wasn't that other folks left me; it was that I was self-absorbed, depressed, emotionally unavailable, addicted, etc. For me, the answer was a lot of therapy and 12 step around sex and love addiction.    I'm not saying that you're in the same place. I'm now 36, and forty doesn't seem so old. Heck, 50 is starting to seem young to me.

Try getting involved in other activities in the gay community.  You might be surprised by what you find.  On a side note, as a person who has wrestled depression since I was a kid, I recognize how hopeless things can seem sometimes.  The thing is, depression lies to you and hides reality from you.  There are medications that can help.  Really.  Please, talk to your doctor."

Of course a lot of people go on about ""not going gentle into that goodnight"" but it won't change the outcome for us all. That said, I'm not sure this issue is confined to gays; I think it affects straight people too. I'd really like some statistics on how many people end up alone at how, if at all, it effects their well-being in comparison to people in relationships.  All of that said, supposing you were in a relationship, how long do you think it would take for you to return to your baseline mood? I'm not qualified in psychology but I'm lead to believe that after something good or bad happens, people tend to return to baseline as a kind of mood homoeostasis. You might be thinking that a relationship is the thing that will make you happy but then supposing you were in one, it would then be something else you need and then when you get that, something else ad infinitum."

A series of short term relationships is no way to learn to how to maintain a long term relationship. Now we are older and see old age as something likely to come we are without foundation to deal with the encumbant slower pace. I am 62, lonely beyond belief, starting each day thinking of suicide.  Fear of the lonely is keeping me lonely.  In Zen it would be known as the 'Gateless Gate'.  I end my day thinking while suicide is still an option I did somehow othewise enjoy the day and settle into another night fantasy and sleep.  The days repeat.  Getting old is getting old.  Missing lost youth is the theme of great literature.  The Bible is about finding a way to do it all over again.  Sheesh it was all bad right from the start.  There is a guy out there just as lonely as me, wanting to live together, retire, travel, drink coffee.  Sex brought is what brings us together, but there has to be something else to keep us together.  Love?  Security?  Even then the pain might not stop.  Discovering that we really are alone.

gay,3akn6i,dxburge,0,Mon Jun 22 00:02:21 2015 UTC,Hmmm... There should've been a line for met in a bar

gay,3aolhg,DylanFTL,41,Mon Jun 22 21:10:38 2015 UTC,Vote Bernie Sanders
gay,3aolhg,Modest_Baus,10,Mon Jun 22 12:39:27 2015 UTC,Vote for Bernie!!
gay,3aolhg,Rig_Daddy,3,Mon Jun 22 13:39:00 2015 UTC,Nice table!
gay,3aolhg,dukane,-9,Mon Jun 22 15:10:20 2015 UTC,"after Obama, I find it really hard to pull the lever for a guy with basically no experience outside of being a Senator... his own personal positions aren't going to matter nearly as much as the extent to which he can coral a hostile Congress into passing legislation.  it's not as if any Democratic candidate is going to roll back gay rights advances or appoint anti-gay Supreme Court justices."
gay,3aolhg,loki8481,1 point,Mon Jun 22 15:15:43 2015 UTC,But even the Republicans respect Bernie for being consistent and he often works with both sides of the aisle to reach a compromise
gay,3aolhg,lukefel,9,Mon Jun 29 12:47:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah, no.  I'm not entirely opposed to Hillary, but on the LGBT rights front, I'd much rather vote for someone with a long history of supporting the gay agenda."
gay,3aolhg,Aclopolipse,2,Mon Jun 22 15:58:29 2015 UTC,"is there a specific gay rights point you could see Hillary rolling the clock back on or failing to support?  I'm not really a big Hillary supporter myself, but I feel like we're kinda at the point where any Democratic POTUS is going to be about equal on the subject."
gay,3aolhg,loki8481,1 point,Mon Jun 22 17:16:12 2015 UTC,"She's ran for positions on anti-gay platform before as pointed out by multiple people in the comments pointed out including what /u/urinal-cake that it wasn't even on political ideas but deep seeded ""moral beliefs"". Meaning she didn't do it just for the vote but that she honestly didn't support it, makes me wonder what her sudden change of mind is."
gay,3aolhg,hello3pat,26,Wed Jun 24 17:28:21 2015 UTC,Hi! I know as LGBT we feel compelled to vote for a woman who has a great chance to when this upcoming presidential election but have you checked Hillary's voting record?  I don't think you should vote for an 'Ally' that has made no move for equality of marriage.  Check out Bernie Sanders before you start putting stickers on your car of someone who is trying to win on sensationalism and sexism only.
gay,3aolhg,AlmostAryan,15,Mon Jun 22 13:20:47 2015 UTC,Is this a joke or did she declare herself an ally?
gay,3aolhg,todj,-5,Mon Jun 22 10:27:15 2015 UTC,Not sure. The husband bought these from her website. Also as of right now see seems to be the only logical choice.
gay,3aolhg,urinal-cake,27,Mon Jun 22 12:00:19 2015 UTC,"The only logical choice?  ""Yet, she ran for president in 2008 as an opponent of gay marriage and recently insisted to NPR's Terry Gross that her former opposition to marriage equality came from deeply held moral beliefs rather than any kind of political calculation. During Clinton's tenure as first lady in the 1990s, her husband signed into law Don't Ask Don't Tell, the Defense of Marriage Act, and a bill prohibiting people who were HIV+ from entering the United States.""  http://www.dailydot.com/politics/clinton-sanders-2016-issues/  Compare with Bernie Sanders there, and on this infographic: http://imgur.com/gallery/vUVatUt"
gay,3aolhg,lunchbox_tragedy,10,Mon Jun 22 13:23:32 2015 UTC,"During the Fresh Air interview she actually flat out refuses to answer the question as to why she changed her position on gay marriage, or whether those were actually her beliefs.  She's a expert politician pandering to niche sectors of the population while trying to maintain broad based appeal.  Plain and simple."
gay,3aolhg,Royal_Robin,6,Mon Jun 22 15:12:47 2015 UTC,Hilary specifically opposed gay rights in that 2008 election

gay,3amfje,edgardjfc,3,Sun Jun 21 17:39:59 2015 UTC,most people have oral herpes.  cold sores (the sores people get on their lips) are a form of oral herpes.
gay,3amfje,zomboi,1 point,Sun Jun 21 19:08:58 2015 UTC,"Just don't give oral sex or kiss anyone when you have a breakout. But it's also ok to use protection. Either way it is just something we have to deal with. Herpes isn't a big deal overall, you just have to know the facts about the virus and perhaps get tested for it and see what your doctor can do to help. Symptoms don't happen very often and tend to reduce breakouts over the years."
gay,3amfje,Schippyluminal,1 point,Sun Jun 21 22:47:31 2015 UTC,"If its just HSV-1 something like 80%-90% of the world population has this it's not considered that big of a deal. That being said you should still avoid sexual contact, kissing, and sharing of food and drink during an outbreak. If you are having issues with a frequent outbreaks ask your doctor about it as there are medications to help treat it and reduce the frequency."
gay,3amfje,hello3pat,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:18:43 2015 UTC,"thank you, I don't know specifically which type I have, and as far as I remember I've only had 1 outbreak in my life. I'm definatly checking into it, I just want to be as safe as possible."
gay,3amfje,hello3pat,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:40:49 2015 UTC,"Its most likely 1 as an oral infection of 2 is not that common (still happens though). Also its common with either to have very few outbreaks or as in my case with HSV1 be completely asymptomatic. Remember no matter which one it is, a infection is in no way a reflection of you and dont let it affect any idea of self worth."
gay,3ako8b,mikesmith13,4,Sun Jun 21 03:30:00 2015 UTC,"I understand. I grew up in a very religious, conservative household in the rural Midwest. Church every Sunday, where the pastor would rant about homosexuality destroying the world. My father made comments all the time about how disgusting gays were, how it would probably make the world a better place if they went away. Suffice it to say that I suffered self-esteem issues, and still do, because of the self-hatred that I went through going up.  I'm 26 now, have been with my partner for four years, and am slowly coming out to my family. I've noticed that the vitriol is gone now--maybe because of the greater cultural acceptance of gays, maybe because it's so close to home? I'm not sure. Either way, all I can say is that I know how much this stuff hurts. It's rough, growing up and knowing that the people who are supposed to love you hate something that is essential to who you are. Just please don't give up hope that it'll get better. If you need to talk, I'm always here to lend an ear."
gay,3ako8b,bear_ringer,3,Sun Jun 21 06:43:03 2015 UTC,"My family isn't that religious. We have not been to church in years, and luckily I haven't heard anything there about homosexuality. I don't have a boyfriend yet, but I do have many supportive friends. I plan to, hopefully, come out to my Dad soon as he is a little more supportive. If he isn't, at least he can keep his opinions to himself."
gay,3ako8b,night-shark,3,Sun Jun 21 16:00:33 2015 UTC,"This sounds EXACTLY like the sort of thing I heard growing up.  I was 27 before my dad and I had our first real argument / ""vigorous discussion"" about my being gay.  Very few times has he been at a loss for words but when I asked him how he thought it felt to be 13 and in the closet while hearing your parents saying these awful things, he had nothing to say.  You are certainly not alone. Hang in there. My advice to you is to slowly and quietly begin surrounding yourself with people who will support you. There's a reason gay people often refer to other LGBT folks as ""family""."
gay,3ako8b,zomboi,3,Sun Jun 21 08:23:12 2015 UTC,Just about all of my friends know that I am gay and they have all been supportive. It is rough hearing your parents say these awful things. I know the (probably) would not say these things if they knew how close it was to them.
gay,3ahnb7,Vigamoxx,2,Sat Jun 20 07:03:07 2015 UTC,I bought a shirt.  $22 for a shirt shipped is great.  The bumper stickers are overpriced.   $5 to ship a sticker?
gay,3ahrz7,luctadeusz,3,Sat Jun 20 08:18:27 2015 UTC,Congrats Man. Being out is better in my opinion. Glad you were able to have a supportive group of friends..  Have a great life

gay,3ahrz7,buscoamigos,2,Sat Jun 20 16:32:26 2015 UTC,"Please stick your head in this sub now and again and talk with people.  So many people just need a little personal conversation, and there are so many posts that get downvoted to 0 and never seen.  Maybe not all of the time, but, you know, just now and then.  Thanks for the update.  I wasn't one of the original commenters, but whether things go well or terribly, it's nice to hear from people again.  I'm glad that they're going well =)  I think most people developed exaggerated fear of rejection, but then there are the kids whose families disown them, so not always."
gay,3ahrz7,buscoamigos,2,Sat Jun 20 10:39:31 2015 UTC,"Oh, I will. For sure. I've actually been spending a lot of time here recently, and I try to help people out where/whenever I can. Because, like you said, I've noticed a lot of post (especially questioning posts) that get near to no attention. I was actually really surprised by the amount of responses I got on the post I made.   And yeah, you know it's kind of funny, because I really didn't have a fear of rejection. I mean to a certain extent I did, but I already knew that my family and most of my friends would be ok with it. But it was still really hard for me. Probably because of all the shit people gave me for acting gay or whatever in middle school."
gay,3ahrz7,eric_benjamin22,2,Sat Jun 20 14:36:44 2015 UTC,"Sometimes we ask strangers something because we seek unbiased opinions, and other times we seek their opinion to confirm what we already know deep down inside. I'm so glad you're at a point where you feel comfortable with yourself and can stand tall having pride in all aspects of yourself. Even if you're not 100% there (and none of us are) you're well on your way.  It is SO nice to actually get follow up posts; it reminds us we are talking with fellow human beings with lives as intricate and complex as our own (look up ""sonder"").  So, the big question...do you have your eye on someone?"
gay,3ahrz7,FateJace,1 point,Sat Jun 20 12:02:19 2015 UTC,"Haha yeah, I think I already knew deep down. I mean I did have a dream about marrying a man once XD.   And thanks for the ""none of us are 100% there yet"" part. Sometimes I still wonder if I might be a little bit bi, but it doesn't really bother me enough to be a problem. Also, I don't think it am.   Do I have my eye on anyone? Well, I'm still in high school, and lord do I have a poor selection. There is this one guy that I have a little crush on. He's real cute, but he's also real straight. I think. You know I'm not actually sure what's up with him because I flirt with him all the time and I don't even know if he notices. It's actually really entertaining. I mean, even my very straight male friend asked if we were dating. Soo, yep. There's nobody to actually flirt with so I gotta take it out on the oblivious straight boy. 😒"
gay,3ahrz7,FateJace,1 point,Sat Jun 20 14:28:33 2015 UTC,"You were an original commenter too!!!  Sorry, I'm probably getting more excited than I should be haha.

I honestly can't express how much I appreciate it <3"
