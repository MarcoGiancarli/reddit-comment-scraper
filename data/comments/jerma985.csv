jerma985,3c4lm9,QuadrupleJMC,5,Sat Jul 4 18:56:00 2015 UTC,"I say kill ChannelBot, it's usually pretty late and I'm sure people would be able to post the videos to reddit within like a minute of the upload."
jerma985,3c4lm9,JavelinTF2,6,Sun Jul 5 02:18:25 2015 UTC,"It does make sense for the mod team to crack down on karma-farming while we have Channel Bot. We only need one source for the Jerma uploads.  Now, something I have no idea if Channel Bot can do or not, but may still be something for the rest to get their karma, is post STAR_ and other videos that contain Jerma from here on out. It makes sense for anybody on this sub who is using it to follow Jerma to be alerted of when he plays a role in someone else's videos. [EDIT] BUT only if Jerma is actually in them, followed by a time stamp if it's just a small cameo."
jerma985,3c4lm9,DrankeyKrang,5,Sat Jul 4 19:11:33 2015 UTC,I highly doubt ChannelBot can look into a video and see if Jerma is in it.  Channel bot is assigned to a channel and posts videos as they are uploaded
jerma985,3c4lm9,PixelLeaf,2,Sat Jul 4 19:16:25 2015 UTC,"If there is something that is posting a video, there's no reason to try and beat the system for some filthy, free karma"
jerma985,3c4lm9,ThePoopant,3,Sun Jul 5 00:24:36 2015 UTC,"This situation emerged because ChannelBot went down for a really long time, I would bring him back."
jerma985,3c4lm9,Catjaz63,4,Sun Jul 5 00:53:55 2015 UTC,I would think that we should kill ChannelBot. I get a notification to my phone/email when jerma uploads a video and quite a bit of the time channelbot is 5-10 minutes late.
jerma985,3c4lm9,blockguy,2,Sun Jul 5 15:11:45 2015 UTC,"I say that we kill ChannelBot. There's no reason for him to be around; he's slow, unreliable, and boring. Having people posting them encourages more community interaction."

jerma985,3c3cbf,Leyawynn,1 point,Sat Jul 4 11:23:58 2015 UTC,Really? because in my experience skypes audio quality is pretty bad with a lot of white noise in the bakground. And nearly everyone i actively chat with agrees that even steams voice chat sounds better.  Maybe star and jerma have mics that cancel white noise.
jerma985,3c3cbf,Blazik3n99,3,Sat Jul 4 11:38:09 2015 UTC,"In one of Jerma's old GTA IV videos star gets a robot voice, which happens with Skype occasionally. I have experienced it myself. They may have changed since then.  Also, in Jerma is Mad Part 2 Jerma says 'And Boo is in the call!', so I doubt they are using something like teamspeak or mumble if they are mentioning a 'call'. Star also mentions a call in 'Bring on the Thundah'  IIRC."
jerma985,3c3cbf,Helicuor,3,Sat Jul 4 14:12:31 2015 UTC,In a lot of stars streams you can hear the skype call tone before he starts talking to jerma

Using this program, users are able to place 3D characters into pre-made environments, add actions, sound effects, music, text, speech, and special effects then show these movies off to friends, family, and the world. These are saved in the 3D Movie formats: "".3mm"" and "".vmm"".  The program features two helper characters to guide users through the various features of the program. The character McZee (Voiced by Michael Shapiro) provides help throughout the studio while his assistant Melanie provides various tutorials. In Nickelodeon 3D Movie Maker, the user is guided by Stick Stickly.  3D Movie Maker is built on the BRender, a 3D graphics engine created by Argonaut Software. The models and prerendered backgrounds were created by Illumin8 Digital Pictures, a now defunct graphics studio, using Softimage modeling software. The cinematic introduction and help sequences were created by Productions Jarnigoine, a now inactive production company directed by Jean-Jacques Tremblay.

Both of the times David Bowie Sensei is in a video its always on a 100% crits server, so it is likely that jerma and star stayed in the same server while it changed maps and both recorded footage at different times.  With the other one you mentioned, both sawmill and nucleus are koth maps. I'm willing to get that they are both next to each other or close in map rotation; either that or someone started a vote.  Jerma and star used to share recording sessions when they did live tf2 videos, sometimes overlapping. For example, 3:30 on jermas 'Shpees, Singing, and STAR_ the Troll' is the same as 3:03 on stars 'Ruiner of Fun'."

jerma985,33zkdm,PixelLeaf,7,Mon Apr 27 03:25:14 2015 UTC,I love the tiny one at the end.

jerma985,33mlwg,ThePoopant,8,Thu Apr 23 19:20:28 2015 UTC,I honestly think the first was better. But hopefully he makes more and gets a show on Cartoon Network or Adult Swim (kind of the same thing) and it becomes the most known show on the planet.
jerma985,33mlwg,JavelinTF2,7,Thu Apr 23 20:27:33 2015 UTC,I could easily see Jerma getting a small show on either of those channels.
jerma985,33mlwg,PixelLeaf,5,Thu Apr 23 21:29:11 2015 UTC,That would be pretty cool.
jerma985,33mlwg,Linnarsson,3,Thu Apr 23 20:50:36 2015 UTC,"With the second Ratmovie Jerma played with the stereotype of a sequel itself.  As said, as long as they keep the suits happy, the movie could be about a blue toothbrush, which it was. With that I think it is very likely Jerma will want to end this in a trilogy. The movies are very flexible, they have that floating timeline, so it can't be that hard for  Jerma to come up with a great sequel (or possibly a prequel of sort) to The Movie."
jerma985,33jldx,Ommpansthe,3,Thu Apr 23 01:13:19 2015 UTC,I think those 2 originated from the Jerma Rumble. I don't think they came from other videos like The Egg.
jerma985,33jldx,jangoknight7,1 point,Thu Apr 23 01:43:48 2015 UTC,Are you sure? I always thought they had their own video...
jerma985,33jldx,jangoknight7,1 point,Thu Apr 23 01:50:40 2015 UTC,He doesn't mention where either of them come from when they're first introduced. So I think he probably made them just for the Rumble
jerma985,33jldx,CanadianBot,1 point,Thu Apr 23 02:32:36 2015 UTC,Actually the egg is from a very old video of his
jerma985,33jldx,MonkeyDDuffy,1 point,Thu Apr 23 05:45:56 2015 UTC,I think he means Batboy and Glueman.

jerma985,33f3h8,ChannelBot,14,Wed Apr 22 00:28:58 2015 UTC,I genuinely want a full length feature film of this with Jerma as every actor now.
jerma985,33f3h8,unit220,13,Wed Apr 22 02:48:56 2015 UTC,"I really like how it seems like Jerma is expanding his roster of channel characters. We've seen Vineyard guy in his past GTAV videos, but now he's getting more recognition. I like how he's developing new characters outside of Jerma Rumble, too."
jerma985,33f3h8,DrankeyKrang,10,Wed Apr 22 00:37:10 2015 UTC,I really think we need Vineyard guy for the next Jerma rumble
jerma985,33f3h8,Random_ass_pub,6,Wed Apr 22 02:51:41 2015 UTC,"I'm a little disappointed he didn't use the punch line ""Let's have some more wine!"""
jerma985,33f3h8,PixelLeaf,5,Wed Apr 22 08:02:40 2015 UTC,"The video editor in GTA V is astounding. Even people who don't really like the main story can spend hours upon hours in the video editor making anything they want. Fictional stories, stunt videos, action movies, staged heists with insane premises, the list is immense."
jerma985,33f3h8,Jax3636,3,Wed Apr 22 14:23:50 2015 UTC,"After watching this 27 times over, this is one of my favorite Jerma videos."
jerma985,33f3h8,blockguy,3,Wed Apr 22 22:37:36 2015 UTC,I love how he used all the stereotypical action movie trailer quotes. Made me laugh pretty hard.

jerma985,32apfv,SexCop,3,Sun Apr 12 05:53:43 2015 UTC,"Maybe Jerma wasn't satisfied with just a simple revamp of the old intro, so this one may be here to stay."
