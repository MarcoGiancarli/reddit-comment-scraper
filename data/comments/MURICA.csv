Calling that kind of person a coward is absolutely uncalled for, and that damn commie deserved every pound of force put into that punch."
MURICA,3dy98c,TheMstar55,12,Mon Jul 20 19:47:20 2015 UTC,"Saying Buzz Aldrin didn't walk on the moon is like saying George Washington didn't piss Jack Daniels. It doesn't matter what your conspiracy is, if you talk commie shit, you get eagle hit."

MURICA,3dy98c,TheDeltaLambda,6,Mon Jul 20 19:52:52 2015 UTC,What's the story behind this?
MURICA,3dy98c,CyriusBloodbane,9,Mon Jul 20 17:12:44 2015 UTC,"Buzz was going to do a speech on space exploration and progress iirc and this baboon starts yelling at him about how much of a ""coward"" he is. Cause testing brand new tech on a mission that you had no idea if you were coming back from is cowardly."

If the ghost of Stalin tempts your heart with doubt, shine a freaking laser at it and prove it to yourself."
MURICA,3dy98c,asmohov,3,Mon Jul 20 23:52:29 2015 UTC,The man conquers planetoids and eats commies for breakfast.  That conspiracy nut got off easy.
