coheedandcambria,3crm5l,rileymat,23,Fri Jul 10 05:27:20 2015 UTC,"I usually suggest iksse3.   That was my first Coheed album, and I still listen to it regularly.  Good Apollo Vol. 1 is also amazing, and probably my personal favorite.   You really can't go wrong with either album.  Each have plenty of variety and are wonderful in their own ways."
coheedandcambria,3crm5l,kamneggs,6,Fri Jul 10 05:47:00 2015 UTC,"Listen to this man, OP"
coheedandcambria,3crm5l,Kenny__Loggins,2,Fri Jul 10 13:49:21 2015 UTC,For a guy that likes the heavier stuff I would suggest Second Stage for the fact that it is the heaviest album imo. I still fall back to IKSSE but SSTB will always be my number 2.
coheedandcambria,3crm5l,seedlesssoul,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:52:25 2015 UTC,"I don't know about second stage being heavy, it's pretty pop punkish. Coheed hasn't done much in the way of heavy but I'd say welcome home is the heaviest thing they have written aside from maybe some of afterman."
coheedandcambria,3crm5l,DrMrCat,1 point,Sat Jul 11 03:44:35 2015 UTC,I'd say Al The Killer is their heaviest
coheedandcambria,3crm5l,DavidR525,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:11:19 2015 UTC,"Yes, this. After years, it is still my favorite"
coheedandcambria,3crm5l,linapina1,7,Sat Jul 11 05:23:19 2015 UTC,"The ""proggiest"" albums they have done so far are In Keeping Secrets and Good Apollo 1. All coheed albums are a mix of pop-rock, metal-ish, and softer songs, so you will find them mixed together.  From IKS I would say check out: In Keeping Secrets of Silent Earth: 3, The Crowing, The Light and the Glass, and 2113 for prog points; Blood Red Summer, Faint of Hearts, and Favor House Atlantic for pop-ish fare; and Cuts Marked in the March of Men and Al the Killer for metal-ish heaviness (but with a smidge less structural diversity).  From Good Apollo 1: Start at the first Willing Well and listen through to the end. The third one is a reprise of Good Apollo I: The Writing Writer from earlier on the album, so check that one out too if you want the full effect of the throwback. The Willing Well suite is what really turned me on to prog-rock and my undying love for it.  Hope this helps!"
coheedandcambria,3crm5l,Yoshwa,1 point,Fri Jul 10 05:53:40 2015 UTC,"I back up what this dudes says song choice wise on IKS. As far as the Willing Wells go, it took me a while to get into those so I dunno if that's a good place to start for a new fan. Maybe tho everyone's different.  Some of my personal favorites by the band that weren't already mentioned by the guy above me,  Devil in Jersey City Feathers Mother Superior Justice in Murder Here We Are Juggernaut Wake Up (Acoustic)  And I love everything off both Afterman albums, but I guess my favorites are:  Domino the Destitute Holly Wood the Cracked Vic the Butcher Sentry the Defiant The Hard Sell Gravity's Union Iron Fist  Jesus so many more. It's hard to give a list to someone starting fresh."
coheedandcambria,3crm5l,Xxmustafa51,8,Fri Jul 10 20:03:02 2015 UTC,"My usual tutorial is, if you're already sure you'll like the band, start with their second album In Keeping Secrets of Silent Earth: 3. To me it's the best mix of their sounds and is a great way to get to know them.  After you're comfortable enough with that, jump back to their first album The Second Stage Turbine Blade. This one is a bit less accessible than IKS, which is why I suggest getting into it later instead of right away. Still, gives you a great idea of how the band sounds and where they started.  After you feel comfortable with both of those, head on to their third album Good Apollo I'm Burning Star IV Vol. 1: From Fear Through The Eyes of Madness. This one is probably their proggiest (and imo, best) release yet. The reason why I say wait for this one is so you can appreciate the intricacies a bit more and you can really see how they've grown as a band. There's also a fair amount of call backs to older songs you might not pick up on if you don't know the other albums first.  From there, it's pretty much up to you. You can follow the rest chronologically or you can mix and match and see what you like. Happy listening!"
coheedandcambria,3crm5l,Rustash,2,Fri Jul 10 10:49:43 2015 UTC,Can't agree with this more!
coheedandcambria,3crm5l,Masterofunlocking1,5,Fri Jul 10 16:32:57 2015 UTC,"Just jump in with both feet!   YouTube> Coheed and Cambria   Pick the first mix that comes up.   After that, I recommend starting from the beginning: Second Stage Turbine Blade >  In Keeping Secrets of Silent Earth > Good Apollo volume 1 and 2 > Year of the Black Rainbow > Afterman 1 and 2.   This is exactly how I got into them and I just got into these guys this year, then went to a concert not even a month ago. Omg, they were awesome!   You won't regret it!   -One among the Fence!-"
coheedandcambria,3crm5l,MaddyJean,10,Fri Jul 10 05:52:09 2015 UTC,"First of all, this sub isn't as popular as it used to be. Try /r/TheFence for a better Coheed and Cambria subreddit.  The entire discography by order of release goes:  1.)Second Stage Turbine Blade  2.)In Keeping Secrets of Silent Earth: 3  3.)Good Apollo I'm Burning Star IV, Volume I: From Fear Through the Eyes of Madness  4.)Good Apollo I'm Burning Star IV, Volume II: No World For Tomorrow  5.)Year of the Black Rainbow  6.)Afterman: Ascension  7.)Afterman: Descension  8.)Color Before the Sun (Being Released on October 9th)  The albums tell the story of the Amory Wars, a fictional Universe created by Claudio Sanchez, the band's lead singer. In chronological order the story goes 6,7,5,1,2,3,4. You don't have to read the comic books to enjoy the songs, but they give you more meaning to each song, and I find them more enjoyable this way. The new album they're releasing was announced to be their first non- conceptual album, and I'm personally very excited to see how it ends up. I hope I helped a little bit!"

coheedandcambria,3crm5l,SexBobomb,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:50:15 2015 UTC,I heard IKSSE3 before SSTB and think SSTB is just overall more raw and exciting.  You can tell those songs were meant for live performance and to blast people away (mainly because it was all songs they were touring with before releasing their first album) which to me is what makes the album so fucking great.  Delirium Trigger is a top 10 song of mine easily.

coheedandcambria,31vfmv,Veyance,4,Wed Apr 8 13:50:10 2015 UTC,"The idea that the concept album has 'died' is absurd. Absolutely absurd. There are countless amounts of musicians who still make concept albums from The Mars Volta to Kendrick Lamar, and plenty of others in between. A lot of these are not only concept albums, but truly great concept albums with tons of depth and a lot of thought put into the overall themes. As a Coheed fan I obviously disagree because IMHO Coheed is at the top of the concept album game right now. Not only do their albums tell a great story, but their execution in telling the story from music to comics to novels is just unmatched by anyone else. My favorite way to get into the story is to lose myself in the music and see if I can figure out what's going on. Since some of the time that is a little difficult, the comics definitely help, and the Afterman book especially is just perfect. The Afterman book gives both sides of the story by telling you what each song means to Claudio and what it means for the overall story.  Coheed's albums are pretty Narrative I would say, you're often getting a fairly detailed account from a particular character's perspective. In fact I think that's almost always the case.    Good luck on your paper!"
coheedandcambria,31vfmv,mikethehuman,3,Wed Apr 8 15:34:48 2015 UTC,"Concept albums dying with vinyl?  That's just insane.  As mentioned, The Mars Volta and Kendrick Lamar have had concept albums in the CD era.  Hell, even American Idiot was a concept album.  Not to mention albums from artists like Lupe Fiasco and The Decemberists.  Concept albums are still very much alive. I actually have not gotten into reading the Armoy Wars yet, but listening to Coheed and Cambria has definitely made me want to.  My plan is to start buying the graphic novels this summer when I have more free time available.  But I would say that my desire to get into the story was definitely impacted by listening to the music.  Specifically, the song ""Time Consumer.""  It's a beautiful song, with mesmerizing lyrics that had me finding myself asking what it is even about. Their albums are definitely narrative concept albums."
coheedandcambria,31vfmv,BurnMeInTheStars,2,Wed Apr 8 17:43:21 2015 UTC,"1.) While there may be less concept albums today, they are still alive and well.  As /u/mikethehuman wrote, look at any of Kendrick's work.  All of it stems from a single concept.  Another example might be the work of The Dear Hunter (Casey Crescenzo) who wrote three albums detailing an entire story of one man from life to death (honestly check these out if you haven't already) and another giant compilaton album revolving around the Color Spectrum (as it is titled).  Relient K even did a concept album in the form of Forget and Not Slow Down.  There are plenty of bands out there still doing concept music, and this definitely includes C&C.    2.) I have never actually read the comics, but my favorite way to get into the Amory Wars is through listening to the music and looking up the song's meanings if I don't understand.  The concerts kill it, naturally, but that's more just a base musical and performance entertainment.  I treat Coheed's songs like literature.    3.) I would say narrative concept albums.  The Afterman albums are entirely narrative while the other albums tend to mix narrative and Thematic imo.  While they do follow a narrative storyline, there is much that is left cryptic without proper reference and is often not actually a story, but more the character's thoughts while taking part in the story itself.    Hope this helps"
coheedandcambria,31vfmv,dontworry_iknow_wfa,2,Wed Apr 8 20:46:22 2015 UTC,Armour for sleep is also a great concept band-- they have a record about a guy talking to people after he commits suicide.  Alesana is a great metal band who writes practically only concept albums.  They write around different authors styles like poe and dante.  They also have an overarching storyline over their last three records about a guy who kills his wife and then is tormented by her ghost.  Pretty sweet album (The emptiness for anyone wondering)

coheedandcambria,31vfmv,soggydave2113,1 point,Thu Apr 9 02:08:59 2015 UTC,"Concept albums may have died as a mainstream thing, but within rock, the concept of ""mainstream music"" itself is essentially dead. Very few contemporary bands manage to ascend into the consciousness of ""mainstream"" music into pop culture and general public awareness. Instead, musical genres have splintered off into niche subcategories and sub communities which are easier to find and more accessible due to online distribution than in decades past. I think there may have been a period of time where the concept album struggled because singles held more weight, but by now music is generally more accessible than before, even in album format.   As for the idea of concept albums necessarily being outside of the mainstream, that's not true. Look at Muse. They're huge, and a perfect counterexample to this. The Resistance was totally a concept album, where its sales were driven by its singles but the concept was front and center. I think many of their other works, including their upcoming album, are heavily conceptual as well.   Also, try posting this over to /r/TheFence, and you'll probably get more answers. The community is generally more active over there."

coheedandcambria,2u4mvk,birdman88945,19,Thu Jan 29 22:02:26 2015 UTC,"You're talking about two very different drumming styles. Chris' chops are insane, his skill with time signatures and rudiments are incredible. Josh is a groove drummer, his style supports the music and helps complement what the bass and guitar are doing. For Coheed: Josh is the better fit. As a drummer in general...Chris might be better technically speaking.  Also shout out to my man Taylor Hawkins!!"
coheedandcambria,2u4mvk,stingrayship,2,Thu Jan 29 22:13:46 2015 UTC,"I feel like Taylor is what would happen if Chris and Josh had their playing styles melded.

coheedandcambria,2u4mvk,SecretBox,4,Thu Jan 29 23:38:12 2015 UTC,That's probably the most I've ever seen someone talk up Taylor Hawkins.

coheedandcambria,2u4mvk,Pete_Worst,3,Thu Jan 29 22:37:11 2015 UTC,"I don't think so, his style had non of the flair or wierd quirks that made Josh's playing so ""COHEEDISH."" Chris' playing in Coheed was downright boring, even if that was due to Claudio or the band."

coheedandcambria,2u4mvk,michaelbritt23,2,Thu Jul 2 03:10:44 2015 UTC,"""Better"" is subjective. Chris contributed to some good grooves while Josh was battling his demons. However, like most drummers, their styles are completely different. While I would like to see Josh break out a double kick bass drum, I'm thoroughly impressed with how much more passion and expression goes into his playing.   The two times that I've seen Josh play with the group there's so much more feeling.  Chris there was more show and technicality and his chops are just crazy.   Both are fantastic drummers. But their hearts beat at much different tempos."

coheedandcambria,2hujlp,robiannelli,2,Tue Sep 30 11:49:20 2014 UTC,Not so much as rare as produced in small runs due to a limited demand. Pair that with a handful of people wanting one at each comic book store in the us and you have quick sellout but no reorder from the local shop  Best bet? Get a pull list going and you'll guarantee copies

Anyway, don't dive in with the Color Spectrum. That's kind of the Dear Hunter advanced course. Start with their Acts album's first. It's a six-part story of which three have been released: Acts I, II, and III. Much more coheed-like and closer to what the Dear Hunter's ""actual sound"" is, and probably a better place to start for someone just getting into them."

coheedandcambria,25ezsp,xoKayleigh,1 point,Tue May 13 21:42:59 2014 UTC,"You don't have to do anything.  It plays by itself.  The arches that you see are the possible routes the song can jump, and it will do them completely at random as it passes them.  All you need to do is load a song and click 'play' and it does all the rest.  In Keeping Secrets isn't really amazing with this.  It can be pretty jarring at points.  Other songs (such as Billie Jean as listed on their most played list) sounds completely natural."

coheedandcambria,25b1fy,eifersucht12a,2,Mon May 12 05:37:01 2014 UTC,I thought it was a pretty cool change of pace compared to one of their headliners for example. A more well rounded set is better most of the time but sometimes they're best when they're just throwing down and playing their heaviest.

coheedandcambria,25b1fy,ckillgannon,2,Mon May 12 15:25:47 2014 UTC,The Slipknot tour is probably the weird highlight of their supporting career. They've always been added to strange lineups but this is probably the most unusual that they made the best out of.

coheedandcambria,252y58,AaronVsMusic,4,Mon May 12 14:33:17 2014 UTC,"I have two guesses:  First is easy: Radio City Music Hall DVD.   Second comes with a story:  In 2010 I saw Coheed for the first time after being a fan since IKSSE:3 (shameful, I know). I went with my friend who is also a huge Coheed fan. We met the band before the show and I told Mic that I learned a lot of my bass technique and style from learning his bass lines, he appreciated it.   The next spring we saw them for the second time: on the Neverender: SSTB tour. Anyone who saw this tour knows how great that was.   In July of 2011, we saw them for the third time in under a year, opening for Soundgarden. Later that week, we both went out and got keywork tattoos.   Two days after we got the tattoos, and a week after the Soundgarden show, Mic Todd was arrested. On my birthday.   The following Friday we went to Warped Tour in Toronto, saw Josh perform both as Weerd Science with MC Lars and with Terrible Things. Then we got to talk with him at the Terrible Things merch tent when no one else was there. We'd met the last member of Coheed, and he was an incredibly nice guy.   We showed Josh our keywork tattoos, and he showed us his. Josh then told us that they had been planning a reuniting of the original Coheed lineup for a Neverender: In Keeping Secrets your, until Mic got himself arrested. He was obviously disappointed about it, and clearly felt bad for Mic still being in a really shitty place.   Needless to say, we were not surprised (though we were incredibly excited) when Josh rejoined Coheed. As much as we liked Coheed with Chris, it just never felt right without Josh. With Josh back, and Zach killing it on bass, the band feels as close to right as we're going to get anymore. I honestly love Zach's playing.

coheedandcambria,23e8bx,thedarkmercury,12,Fri Apr 18 22:57:46 2014 UTC,Well fuck me. I do like that. Is there an actual set story for NWFT somewhere?
coheedandcambria,23e8bx,tanithghost88,2,Sat Apr 19 00:05:55 2014 UTC,Not yet. Claudio has said in the past that NWFT will be the last aspect he will reveal of the story. Since it's the end and all.
coheedandcambria,23e8bx,TheCrowing2113,1 point,Sat Apr 19 00:50:42 2014 UTC,"He said in his fairly recent AMA that he is in the process of reworking Good Apollo I and that naturally, Good Apollo II is being worked on a bit as part of that because both are so linked. It definitely isn't a rumour, we will see a GA1 graphic novel re-do in the next few years."
coheedandcambria,23e8bx,MyGoodApollo,3,Sat Apr 19 01:33:14 2014 UTC,I like that this brings everything full circle. I'll just say that this is the way it is until we are told otherwise. God knows my interpretation has changed so much over the years.
coheedandcambria,23e8bx,NoNoNoNopeNoNoNo,3,Sat Apr 19 11:05:43 2014 UTC,"That theory holds interesting ramifications for Jesse. In PFI, I believe that the song 78 is the end of Jesse being on present day earth. It could be possible that when he died in Good Apollo, he went to his own version of the keywork, which happened to be that story, and when Claudio releases all of the souls, he is freed from that reality.  edit- And further more, maybe the reason that Jesse would experience that reality is that because he isn't a human mage or prise, he has a different afterlife in the Keywork."
coheedandcambria,23e8bx,AmeliaTorani,3,Sat Apr 19 01:51:32 2014 UTC,"Thought I'd post this over here too so I can get people's thoughts:  There are some things here that don't quite add up, but I do like a lot of the ideas here... I believe Claudio has stated at one point that the universe actually ends during The End Complete and the Road and the Damned and On The Brink take place after that. I think a lot of this probably still fits this though, I just think some of the events need to be shifted up a bit. For example, your idea of The End Complete fits well, but I think the ""overwhelmed by the sheer mass of souls surrounding him"" bit happens during the Road and the Damned. I believe he enters the keywork at the end of The End Complete... Which actually strengthens your idea that the Prise are split. Maybe the very last lines of The End Complete are sung by two opposing groups of Prise as Claudio and the Writer (more on that later) are entering the Keywork.  Militant Prise: ""Oh no. No no.""  Crowing Supporting Prise: ""Bye bye! Bye bye!""  MP: ""We're going to get you!""  CSP: ""My love!""  Anyway, during the Road and the Damned he sees all of the souls in the Keywork and sees their suffering, and rather than hesitating, he knows exactly what he must do. In that single second of time, he makes his peace with what he's to do, and he lets go of his past. The Road and the Damned is a more thematic piece in that way, rather than about specific events happening.  I also don't think the Writer has left at all, I think the Writer has stuck with Claudio through the whole thing to see that he carries out the deeds he's supposed to, so they're in the keywork together. In that way, maybe Claudio sings the verses of the song, and the Writer sings the choruses, believing that he's stuck there permanently (but really being okay with it, as it's probably the most important thing he'll ever do. In a way, he's found a sort of peace in the alternate universe, because the battlefield he sees in his day to day life has become his reality, and he fits in better that way).  To rewind a tad, I believe that at the end of The Afterman, Sirius Amory becomes something similar to Davey Jones and the Flying Dutchman. He takes on a sort of responsibility ferrying souls between the keywork and the Samaritaine. He spends the rest of his life - taking on a strange kind of half-alive half-dead immortality by immersing himself in the keywork for so long - performing this task, not knowing that his destiny, his ultimate purpose, is to ferry Claudio's soul to the Samaritaine.  Now to fast forward to On The Brink, I believe that Claudio has already used the power of the crowing to transcend all of the souls at once, just like you mentioned, and the only three left are Sirius, the Writer, and Claudio. They are standing in a great white void having a conversation with one another about what is to come, and to everyone's surprise... The winged guillotine awaits them. The Writer has developed a connection with Claudio and invites him to come to his world, but Claudio refuses, ""These worlds need now an ending as they did at the start,"" because the job isn't done if he doesn't go too. The Writer indicates that their journey together has been very therapeutic for him and has left him in an all together better place, ""I'm no longer haunting here, I'm not coming back,"" and that he doesn't feel the need to take out his feelings on these characters anymore. He knows the value of life now.   Claudio turns toward Sirius and the two begin their trek into the Samaritaine and spends his last seconds reminding the Writer, ""The world must know my story,"" and then invites Sirius to take the final journey with him, and the two ascend together. The last thing the Writer hears as he is transported back to his own world are the souls of the keywork celebrating Claudio's victory, ""Hail! Hail! Hail!"" ... And then the Writer is transported (The final cut reprise)... and then even their afterlife ceases to exist. (That last cymbal crash)"
coheedandcambria,23e8bx,okcodex,2,Sat Apr 19 02:06:11 2014 UTC,"Ooh, I like that one, too.  BTW, my rationale for the Prise being split:  ""Our mind divides, the past repeats, A war is brewing in the hearts of those we once bled""  EDIT: And I completely agree about the denouement with the two factions of Prise calling out to Claudio."
coheedandcambria,23e8bx,okcodex,1 point,Sat Apr 19 04:16:41 2014 UTC,"I like the idea of like a miniature civil war happening between the prise at the very end there. Always a fight, right to the bitter end."
coheedandcambria,23e8bx,okcodex,1 point,Sat Apr 19 04:31:03 2014 UTC,"The things that don't fit with your (very fine) theory for me are twofold:   We hear a Crowing scream in The End Complete, which means to me that Claudio is bringing all the guns to the fight with the Prise. The next time we hear the Crowing scream is in the middle of the ""Hail"" section of On the Brink, relaying to me the impression that Claudio's calling on all the power available to him to complete his task. At the beginning of On the Brink, the verse suggests to me that we're seeing Sirius receiving his award for his breakthrough on the Keywork, and instead of an acceptance speech, he drops the whole truth on them. ""The worlds now have learned of the worst yet to come"" and ""Mr. Man of the Year."""

coheedandcambria,23e8bx,123NNB,1 point,Sat Apr 19 13:16:45 2014 UTC,"I don't think so. Claudio seems to be taunting him before sticking the knife between his ribs in ""Justice in Murder"", telling him he's going to get what he wanted: immortality through the power of the Keywork, not as its God, but one of its prisoners. I don't think Claudio would take such pleasure in the notion that Ryan would soon be joining the damned souls if he thought that Ryan would be freed soon thereafter."
coheedandcambria,23e8bx,Kalima,1 point,Sat Apr 19 05:06:31 2014 UTC,"I don't think there is any coming to peace for some of these souls. The Crowing's power seems to be to force all of the souls from the keywork whether they're ready or not. And if the universe is ending anyway, what does it matter? The keywork and samaritaine are both being eliminated as well, so either way, Wilhelm Ryan's soul stops existing."

This could possibly be inspired by his dad's drug issues. I believe he even said his dad was his hero.   Although, Claudio did say that Chondra was doing the heavy lifting in this comic so maybe it is something else, but if Claudio came up with the names then maybe that's where he drew the inspiration from."
coheedandcambria,1vejbe,defiant_lion,2,Fri Jan 17 23:40:56 2014 UTC,His father was addicted to cocaine. Heroin was mic Tods drug of choice
coheedandcambria,1vejbe,Trevmiester,2,Mon Jan 20 12:13:52 2014 UTC,Well then perhaps he pulls his inspiration from Mic?
coheedandcambria,1vejbe,defiant_lion,2,Mon Jan 20 12:48:23 2014 UTC,That would be the logical conclusion ....

The only one I thought was tolerable was Good Apollo and that had more to do with Christopher Shy's artwork then the story. Its a shame, I wish Claudio's story telling abilities (in terms of the comics) were up to par with his song writing capabilities."

I knew the song represented some sort of showdown between Claudio and Wilhelm Ryan, but there were a lot of interpretational gaps I couldn't really make sense of, until I came across this. Including the interaction and part-narration of the souls of the Keywork filled in the gaps and completed the story for me. That scream, the souls of the Keywork being released and setting upon Wilhelm Ryan, the instrumentals representing the destabilization and collapse of the Keywork, etc. I think it's a great breakdown and, IMO, a spot-on explanation. Thought it deserved some recognition."

The thing is - your vision of how we should cover Coheed does not match our vision (clearly). I have nothing wrong with your comment because it's your opinion and you are entitled to it, I just hope you can understand that we do the covers the way we want to do them and while your opinion is indeed noted (this time around) it is not fact. Perhaps you'd like the cover to be slower but if it were that way I guarantee you that someone else would want it faster, there is no pleasing everyone and we know that - so we just do it our way. Some songs will be radically different and some will be very similar to the original. It all depends on what we feel works best for the cover.  I'm sorry if you don't like our vocalists but we do. There is nothing constructive behind just saying that they ruin the song for you.  Thanks for not just saying ""you guys suck"". Please do continue to give us your detailed opinions.  See you next time!"

coheedandcambria,1s76xn,Herculez,3,Fri Dec 6 00:07:28 2013 UTC,"The sign above the owl is the Keywork, a commonly used logo for Coheed and Cambria, symbolizes the energy stream between the planets in the band's fictional universe. The design underneath it are meant to be crystals. I want it to be touched up a little before having it and I hope it could be done by Mike Moses   On to the meaning: I want this to be done in my right shoulder since I'm right handed and I think of it as my ""strong"" side. I want the owl since it is usually used to represent knowledge and the crystals underneath represent my change towards life from being very introvert to a more extrovert guy. I wanted the keywork there since it's the logo of my favorite band but also because of it being a stream of energy conecting planets I use it as the symbol of me and my friends and the strong connection I made with them."
coheedandcambria,1s76xn,Herculez,2,Fri Dec 6 00:43:08 2013 UTC,"I couldn't have asked for a better response. I'm really feeling the meaning. I saw Coheed and Cambria a year and a half ago at River's Edge Festival in Minnesota, super sick shows. I've never seen Mike Moses's work before, and he is amazing. If he gets a hold of your pictures and tweaks it for a tattoo it would be epic. I googled crystal drawings and there is a lot of different ways your could do them. What would be cool is if the owl behind the crystals were bent at the right angles that the crystal would be reflecting them and some other adjustments I'm sure Mike would deliver on. Good luck on the tat man. Where is Mike based out of?"
coheedandcambria,1rvmk8,conconconconcon,6,Mon Dec 2 01:39:55 2013 UTC,"Start with Second Stage Turbine Blade. It was the first album they released, and you can get the whole series in an Ultimate Edition for a decent price.

I don't think your vocalist is singing in the best key for his voice, though; I got the feeling that he was stretching his voice the whole time (to varying levels of success). I don't think he's a bad singer, but he needs to find his range. Also, both of your guitars are out of tune. I hope my criticism comes across as more helpful than douchey! I think you've got something here; just keep working at it!"

Because he brought his dog on tour, and he gets kind of nervous sometimes. But Claudio wondered, what does the dog think happens when they all leave? All alone, and the loud noise happens, and then they come back, tired but victorious. Claudio determined that the dog must think they fought a terrible battle, as they do every night on tour, and returned triumphant.  And then they kept playing."

Everyone's gotta start somewhere, and they were indeed pretty awful back then. It's kind of ridiculous how good of a vocalist he is now. This is just proof that even the best had to work hard to get where they are. I think this video should be inspiring to anyone who plays an instrument out there.  Edit: To his credit though, the lower register was pretty spot-on. I actually thought everything up til his higher notes was great."

Actually this is still one of my fave YOUTUBE's of them. They rocked that concert. If I were in the crowd I would have been blown away.

coheedandcambria,1pt8gh,unstarter,4,Sun Nov 3 15:40:20 2013 UTC,"They still do it from time to time. It depends on what they were doing before the shows, what their plans are for after the shows, and what happened during the shows.  Keep in mind that these are real people who have real lives. Sometimes they play games of baseball before the shows. Can you imagine playing a game of baseball, and then playing a rock concert where you're jumping around and singing and screaming? You'd be pretty beat too."
coheedandcambria,1pt8gh,okcodex,5,Sun Nov 3 16:22:48 2013 UTC,"Of the 9 shows I've been to, the only time that I know of (usually because we had to leave due to travel time) that none of them came was this year, in Grand Rapids. Some asshat who was hollerin' claims to have seen Claudio taking his dog out to pee. But there were these two chicks who were being the biggest jerks. They were yelling at the people with the venue/band, being really rude to everyone else waiting, going around the barrier they set up. We were really bummed, since my fiancé and his best friend brought a picture of them and Claudio from when they were here in 2008, and it was his friend's fiancée's birthday. We waited for an hour and a half for some dummy to ruin it for everyone :(  I was chatting with someone else who was waiting patiently for the band (the rude chicks were ""only there for Claudio,"" even though last time they were in GR some crazy lady ran up and grabbed his junk while he was taking a picture with other people), I said to her that them coming for a meet and greet is like any other person working overtime on their job. It's not something they have to do - it's nice, and makes us (the fans) feel good, but what if they all have terrible diarrhea?! They just spent two hours rocking everyone's socks off, and that twosie just can't wait!  Also, as a dog owner, I would probably want to spend time with my pooch than some crazy ladies :/  Bonus: When me and my BFF saw them in Detroit in 2007, we brought cookies, and Mic came out first and totally ate one. Travis and Claudio totally ate some, too. They took the rest back to the bus."
coheedandcambria,1pt8gh,gnomes616,1 point,Sun Nov 3 22:43:06 2013 UTC,I was at the Grand Rapids show and there were some dumb annoying people so I totally understand what you are saying. It's a shame because I would have liked to meet the band or least see less annoying people there so they wouldn't ruin the show for others
coheedandcambria,1pt8gh,Unworthy_Unconscious,2,Mon Nov 4 03:15:37 2013 UTC,"A few bad apples, man :("
coheedandcambria,1pt8gh,gnomes616,4,Mon Nov 4 03:31:36 2013 UTC,"They all shower after the show, which would explain the time spent waiting. As others have pointed out, they're usually beat right after shows. Claudio's a rare sight after a show simply because he's working on so many things all the time. Keep in mind Good Apollo is being scripted, Slingerland is in the works, some other unannounced projects, etc. Usually, if he didn't get a chance to work on them earlier, he works on them after shows in the evening.  Basically, it's not that he doesn't want to come hang. He's just extremely busy.  EDIT: They're beat right after shows, not words. Sorry... it's still early."
coheedandcambria,1pt8gh,iKrownz,3,Tue Nov 5 18:01:14 2013 UTC,It seems its easier to find the guys before the show then after now.

coheedandcambria,1pt8gh,Onyxdeity,1 point,Mon Nov 4 18:15:33 2013 UTC,Same here. We were probably at the same show. I almost left before he came out but he was cool. Glad I stayed but I wish I could have seen the rest of the band. I was really bummed out when he left the band too.

coheedandcambria,1pr6e7,Al_The_Killer,4,Sat Nov 2 16:08:21 2013 UTC,You can see the talent is there even 12 years ago.   Claudio has cleaned up his vocal technique alot since then.
coheedandcambria,1pr6e7,stiick,2,Sat Nov 2 16:29:08 2013 UTC,My favorite thing about the early stuff is how raw it sounds.  I like it a little less polished because the emotion comes out in a very visceral way.

For me, no way. It's not.  I mean, compared side by side with the album version? Of course it doesn't sound as good. But put yourself in the shoes of someone at that show. Hear it for the first time, even take away Claudio's singing. The music is still there. I still hear something really special there that would make me want to hear more, and the energy that goes with it. This isn't just some garage band covering Time Consumer. These are the guys that created it, and this is part of its evolution. This will never be awful in my eyes (ears?) because of that."

The next night, we were surprised to find out he actually swapped it. The familiar riff started and we freaked, but as soon as it came to lyrics, Claudio started on the second verse. Then he caught where he fucked up, so he tried dropping into the second line of the first verse, but stumbled all over his words. He had to stop, apologize, and start over.  And that's why requests will never be taken again."

coheedandcambria,1pffe5,rzm61,1 point,Tue Oct 29 15:06:05 2013 UTC,Gravity's Union is the only thing you really need to worry about.   They should be playing Number City too. Just saw them recently at the Starland Ballroom. Hoping to head off to the November 9th show too. :D

I the mighty were sweet, though i think it was a combination of where i was standing and how loud the speakers were, but i couldn't really understand the lead singer about 70% of the time. Balance and composure didn't really do anything for me, some of the music was pretty good but vocals weren't anything special.   i saw the pikachu suits as i was walking out and complemented them on their awesome suits and told them i got a video of them crowd surfing. dude gave me a high five and we parted ways.   overall it was a great show, glad they finally started playing gravity's union live. the number city lead into it was perfect too, and i was just standing their crossing my fingers chanting ""please play gravity's union"" over and over. i wish they had done it during their original descension release tour because i saw them on my birthday when they were in chicago. still had a great time and thats all that matters in the end right?"

They're not poking fun at the bands themselves, they're poking fun at the people who listen to that music. Just because you don't identify Coheed as emo music doesn't mean that people in the 'emo' crowd don't listen to them. If they put up posters for bands that no one had heard of, it wouldn't be nearly as effective. It's not something I would consider an insult, just an observation from the writers and animators."

coheedandcambria,1p3k7l,HearshotAtomDisaster,-1,Thu Oct 24 17:36:40 2013 UTC,"I would argue that it takes more than just one or evn three components to label a genre of music. Emo lyrics are just super dramatic. Like I said, you could label a lot of stuff emo by your reasoning. It kinda sounds to me like you WANT them to be emo. If that's the case, then just say so. Considering I rarely listen to anything past IV, I generally regard them as some weird hybrid hardcore band."
coheedandcambria,1p3k7l,csnk,2,Thu Oct 24 17:41:39 2013 UTC,"Why do you think I want them to be emo? If you read my post correctly, you can clearly see that I don't believe them to be emo at all.

coheedandcambria,1p3k7l,csnk,2,Thu Oct 24 17:46:53 2013 UTC,"By your reasoning, anybody who sings in a high pitch and came out around the so called ""emo heyday"" could be considered emo. That's going by what you said in your original post."

Not sure what post you're talking about, tbh, but this conversation has exceeded my limits of caring. You can label them however you want. I don't really give 2 fucks. That's what makes coca cool, they're more than just one type of band.  If I wasn't on my mobile, I would of had this conversation more organized, but it's whatever because this all means zero, at the end of the day. But I'm still lost on where I backtracked.

coheedandcambria,1p3k7l,SquinterMan86,11,Fri Oct 25 13:08:43 2013 UTC,"I think it has to do with the attitude towards progressive rock nowadays. It used to be rock for ""nerds"" because it had lots of non-rock influence, literary themes, etc. Recently, however, a lot of progressive rock has gotten a little pretentious and hipster-ish (think Radiohead) and because both the emo and the hipster subcultures stress non-mainstream stuff, a lot of up and coming new progressive bands have been trying to please that crowd.  Coheed is not one of those bands. They're more like traditional progressive rock bands. However, because they're lumped into the progressive rock category, they are improperly attributed to the emo and hipster cultures. But that's my assessment. I'm sure there are other reasons I'm not aware of."

They've been changing things up since the early 90s and put on the most insane live show I've ever seen"
coheedandcambria,1p3k7l,SquinterMan86,3,Thu Oct 24 06:25:38 2013 UTC,"I was super excited to see Radiohead live at Coachella two years ago. Not being super familiar with their music, I've heard they put on a great live show and generally speaking, live shows get me more into bands that I am not familiar with.   That said...it was super boring. Like, really unfortunately boring. I fell asleep because the music just kind of droned and it didn't sound much different from song to song. Radiohead just might not be for me, and that's ok. I think it's great you can totally get down with it, but they don't do it for me.   Also, this makes me laugh so much."
coheedandcambria,1p3k7l,hardR,1 point,Thu Oct 24 14:32:30 2013 UTC,"Your opinion means nothing. Song length doesn't equate to how good a song is. You just have a really pretentious musical outlook. ""Some time and key changes""-- Thank you Johann Brahms, for that insightful descriptor.   Also, have you ever even heard a radiohead album? Seriously, if you're describing them as boring, quiet, and repetitive you either haven't or just don't have the attention span to let the album develop.   Eat shit."

And yes, I've listened to Kid A and OK Computer. I have yet to find a song I like.  Also, for the record, one reason I really hate that shitty excuse for a band is their fans. They all seem to think their music is the absolute best, and if you don't like it, you're a moron. To them, musical taste is objective, not subjective. It turns me off to their music even more, as if being quiet and boring isn't enough to make me hate them already."

coheedandcambria,1p3k7l,hardR,2,Fri Oct 25 05:45:06 2013 UTC,"You have such a closed-minded perception of music. The fact that you think a good song should be lengthy and have instrumentals is bleak. At least I can objectively look at a piece of music even though it may not be my thing, and still understand its merit without writing it off as something it's not. I don't call you out for not liking their music. At least give it the respect it deserves. You're a closed minded pretentious prick and that's all good, just wanted to let you know where you stand."
coheedandcambria,1p3k7l,hardR,1 point,Fri Oct 25 06:22:19 2013 UTC,"I actually used that as an example. In fact, my taste in rock music is pretty vast, including progressive, blues rock, metal, synth/space, new wave, alternative, and many other styles. I just find Radiohead to be boring as shit. Also, I believe taste in music to be entirely subjective. No one can look truly objectively at something like music because musical taste is 100% opinion. It's not like it's a math problem or a science experiment. So no, I'm not going to understand the ""merit"" of a band like Radiohead just because they have good critical reception and a lot of fans. I also don't like the Beatles either, despite them being everyone's wet dream. Unlike a lot of people, I get my taste in music from what I alone think, rather than liking what everyone says to like. I'm really into Dream Theater, Nightwish, Primus, Saga, Rush, Yes, and Blind Guardian. Most of my friends have never even heard but one song by any of them, if that. That doesn't mean I'm supposed to like them less than other bands. They're my favorites because I say so, and their music is the best according to me. That's all I need.  It's like a movie. Everyone says that there are movies that are ""the best"" like Citizen Kane, Gone With the Wind, The Godfather, etc. But I have way more fun watching movies like Back to the Future, Star Wars, or Ghostbusters. I watch what I have fun watching, not what got good reviews. Same goes with music. I just don't like Radiohead and I don't see how I could ever like them, but if you do, then go right ahead. Just don't try to convince me they're any good, because I just don't like them."

coheedandcambria,1p3k7l,elcalrissian,5,Thu Oct 24 04:57:00 2013 UTC,"When it comes to coheed, it really matters what record.   Yes.  If my first listen to them was Black Rainbow, i'd prolly not buy more.  Lucky I found them back in the SSTB days.  Good Apollo and Afterman are epic, historically significant, amazing peices of work.  ....I just cant bring myself to 'love' Black Rainbow the same way I love the rest of them."
coheedandcambria,1p3k7l,Burning_StarIV,2,Thu Oct 24 14:59:26 2013 UTC,"Black Rainbow is a fantastic album. The engineering is a little substandard, but the songwriting - and the execution - are great. I like to think of it like I think of the new album by The Sword, ""Apocryphon.""  I was so disappointed when it came out. Thought it was terrible. Then I listened to it again one day and realized it was a great album, and miles above anything else I'd heard since it was released. It just doesn't hold a candle to the other albums by The Sword. Every other album is a solid A+. ""Apocryphon"" is probably a B-; not on the same level as the others, but still fantastic.  That was almost exactly my experience with Black Rainbow, and all of my Coheed-listening friends felt the same. At reception, we were a little disappointed, ESPECIALLY with it following right after the Good Apollo albums, but it's really a good album. When Skeletons Live, In the Flame of Error, Pearl of the Stars, Guns of Summer - man, those songs are awesome. There's more skippable songs than usual, but I would totally advise giving it another honest listen. You're missing out, dude."

NWFT took me awhile to get into, but it's pretty solid. YOTBR has only a few tracks I might listen to now and again. Accession was pretty cool, and was a return to form, of sorts. But descension was total crap to me (aside from Number City, which I fucking love, and is maybe the most random coca song, ever). It just had too many cock rock guitar riffs and meh songs.  I'm sure they think its beneith them now, but I'd kill for them to make a hardcore record again."
coheedandcambria,1p3k7l,ElCrowing,-1,Thu Oct 24 17:31:23 2013 UTC,"Yeah, I agree with you, and honestly, after watching all of the new episode, I noticed that all of the other bands had silly versions of their actual names, and the Coheed poster hasn't really been made into a silly name. Either they couldn't think of something funny or they had it a hidden nod to the band, in a good way.   I could completely wrong though."
coheedandcambria,1p3k7l,emjayar08,3,Thu Oct 24 03:14:31 2013 UTC,"Look at the keywork. It's not actually the keywork logo.

coheedandcambria,1p3k7l,reffasj,1 point,Thu Oct 24 22:18:53 2013 UTC,Is there a way we could ask him to finish it? Maybe make a kick starter for it?
coheedandcambria,1p3k7l,Dalinsky,2,Thu Oct 24 22:32:03 2013 UTC,He's pretty much turned all his attention to adver-gaming so I dunno if he'd be up for it at this point. It's too bad kickstarter wasn't around when he was devoting time to it because that would have been a great way to make it happen.

coheedandcambria,1p3k7l,vettros,6,Thu Oct 24 12:34:47 2013 UTC,"The band was happy about it. Cool with them, cool with me. Favorite band gets a little exposure on one of my favorite shows, win win."
coheedandcambria,1p3k7l,dietervonhasselhoff,2,Thu Oct 24 05:56:09 2013 UTC,"Depends on what you mean by emo. A lot of people consider emo to be an inherently bad consideration. It's just a genre of music, and I think it's as broad of a genre as metal or electronic music; when I hear it mentioned, I can only ask ""what kind are you referring to?""  I think it's hard to say that Claudio's voice isn't in some ways emo because it is high pitch and emotional, which is why I really like it.  Not mention, a lot of SSTB and even IKSS3 has emo-like guitar parts, the octave chords between the intro riff and when he starts singing in delirium trigger is very characteristic of emo music of that time period.  In fact, it wasn't until Good Apollo 1 that they seemed to go full prog.  I'm not saything they're generic, but think if they got mentioned in a music history book or something.  I'd imagine they'd be a cross section of prog and emo.  but all that aside, I've seen people who look a lot like that girl at Coheed concerts :)"

coheedandcambria,1p3k7l,ReturnThroughAether,2,Thu Oct 24 22:50:29 2013 UTC,"I think it's more helpful to think of ""emo"" less like its very own genre and more like an element that runs through many genres.  This makes so much more sense to me, considering the definition of what is ""emo"" has consistently changed since the word was popularized - which was, like, 30 years ago?  Today, it seems like people use the word ""emo"" when what they really mean is ""I don't like this.""  It has become the go-to derogatory term for describing bands in all kinds of genres."
coheedandcambria,1p3k7l,Dalinsky,2,Thu Oct 24 13:28:35 2013 UTC,"Actually, when the C&C's first album was released, they were considered in a genre called Emo-core. Mainly because Claudio's voice was a lot high pitched, and...lighter. (example: Blood Red Summer, or The Light and The Glass) After they grew more into the progressive rock genre by expanding the style of music they tended to preform. (Example: The Willing well, or Ten Speed) I personally think this actually because of Claudio's story line, and how much his story grows darker as it progresses."

There's also an homage My Chemical Romance's ""Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge"" on the wall, ignoring the fact that the band released two subsequent albums and completely reinvented their image before breaking up. Not to mention that Fall Out Boy is going for a pure pop approach in the vein of Maroon 5 or Train nowadays (and were never really emo to begin with).   I find it rather ironic that the first episode of South Park to missed the deadline also happens to be about 5-6 years behind on the times.   EDIT: Grammar/Phrasing"

coheedandcambria,1ot559,Tomazim,2,Sun Oct 20 00:51:16 2013 UTC,"I believe that it is way better to see any artist on a more intimate level. While I haven't been able to see Coheed yet I have seen someone in a local club who usually plays in arenas. I have to say that it's way more awesome with maybe 500-1000 people there vs a 19,000 person arena. Maybe the artist isn't as nervous, more comfortable, what have you, but I feel like its awesome. Like when Coheed came to the Kentucky Theater here in Lexington they debuted the cover of ""Someone I used to know"" (I'm sorry if that's not the right song"". I don't think they would've done that at a festival or large arena. This theater definitely doesn't hold that much but it seems just better overall."
coheedandcambria,1ot559,NightRaider93,2,Sun Oct 20 00:59:51 2013 UTC,They're amazing live. I've seen them at least 4 times and I'm pretty damn jealous of you....

I noticed they made some additions to their set after Neverender (End complete III, Al The Killer, Three Evils, Time Consumer). I'm assuming these are songs that went over very well at the event and some of the other didn't get as much of a reaction.   As for the Willing Wells, they are very long songs.

coheedandcambria,1nwnys,Austin_OL,3,Mon Oct 7 13:36:15 2013 UTC,I can see why claudio wouldn't want to play anything from GA1 because most of those songs were written during a tough time between him and Chondra and I am sure they are not the times he wants to dwell too much on.

coheedandcambria,1nwnys,BloodyToothBrush,1 point,Tue Oct 8 15:41:49 2013 UTC,I agree here. It would almost be like a suicide for the band to not play certain songs so I am sure he just sucks it up

He said it was written about ""someone who was no longer in his life."" He gave in and played it anyway, but you could kind of tell his heart wasn't in it.  The others, like the Willing Wells, I personally guess it's because they are -in my opinion, at least- a little more heavily tied to the storyline of which a good chunk of the audience may not be very familiar, so they try to play more of their more easily-accepted songs. I don't know though, I saw them on their Neverender: SSTB tour and they didn't really hold back on any of them."

This tale makes Star Wars look like Jack and Jill. Claudio is a fucking genius."

The writer is dragged ""to the blade"" by zombies and when the guillotine falls on him, instead of dieing, he realises that Ten Speed is right and that Ambellina has to die. In short, the guillotine symbolises the moment in which the writer decides to kill his girlfriend in the story.  Do bear in mind however that Claudio has said that the graphic novel for GA:1 doesn't do what his vision for that fiction justice and that it was heavily cut down because of what he could afford at the time. Hopefully in a few years we'll have a better version of what that guy truly has in his head behind that album."

The ""Blessing the floor of the places you stepped in"" is an example of that. The next verse ( Will they ever measure up.. I'm the joke, I'm the bastard) is Claudio's rebuttal. Next verse, is Writer to Ambelina. Then, he kills her at The Final Cut.   Also, in the theory I have for the story of NWFT, it all ends at the Final Cut in ""On The Brink"""
coheedandcambria,1m3lp1,gojira80,2,Wed Sep 11 01:21:45 2013 UTC,"So it's weird. As the Writer is under the guillotine, the voice of erica is saying ""This is no beginning....this is the final cut.""   I really get the feeling that Good Apollo 1 was the first album that Claudio really wrote all his feelings at the time into over writing the story. It really does appear in my mind to be about what happened in his relationship with Chondra (his now wife) at the time of writing more than anything else. It seems the music and the song order and all that on the album doesn't match the story particularly well. That's certainly what I'd hazard a guess at saying anyway."

coheedandcambria,1m34gx,ElCrowing,1 point,Tue Sep 10 19:31:14 2013 UTC,"It's a lietmotif.  A leitmotif /ˌlaɪtmoʊˈtiːf/ is a ""short, constantly recurring musical phrase"" associated with a particular person, place, or idea. It is closely related to the musical concepts of idée fixe or 'motto-theme'.The term itself is an anglicization of the German Leitmotiv, literally meaning ""leading motif"", or perhaps more accurately, ""guiding motif."" A musical motif has been defined as a ""short musical idea...melodic, harmonic, or rhythmic, or all three"", a salient recurring figure, musical fragment or succession of notes that has some special importance in or is characteristic of a composition: ""the smallest structural unit possessing thematicidentity."" In particular, such a motif should be ""clearly identified so as to retain its identity if modified on subsequent appearances"" whether such modification be in terms of rhythm, harmony,orchestration or accompaniment. It may also be ""combined with other leitmotifs to suggest a new dramatic condition"" or development. The technique is notably associated with the operas ofRichard Wagner, although he was not its originator and did not employ the word in connection with his work.Although usually a short melody, it can also be achord progression or even a simple rhythm. Leitmotifs can help to bind a work together into a coherent whole, and also enable the composer to relate a story without the use of words, or to add an extra level to an already present story.  http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leitmotif"

I'll leave the reason out because that would be spoilers. Anyway after Claudio leaves the streets and starts to walk home through an ally, a priest drops down and attacks him. At the end of three evils, if you listen closely you can kind of here songs and celebrations fade away, you can also here solo footsteps (Claudio) and also some grunts of inquiry from someone (again, Claudio) (http://imgur.com/Op284nV).

coheedandcambria,1lvgvg,Mourningstar05,13,Fri Sep 6 20:09:51 2013 UTC,"This is my understanding/speculation my brother and I came up with:  In Number City we learn about a car accident, and in Gravity's Union we learn about the nature of it - Meri was telling Sirius should could no longer be with him, and in his cocktails of emotion he loses control and crashes the car. Sirius is saved but Meri and her baby are not. In Away We Go Meri begins to enter the Keywork. Iron Fist is about Siruis' anger. Angry at himself. He was selfish and gave up his wife for a flight of fancy. Dark Side of Me deals with his depression - Meri and her lover Colten were right, and he's going through the emotions. This is all his fault. In 2's My Favorite 1 he has finally decided to put others before himself (by deceiving the scientific community and getting funding for his own personal mission of all things) and feels the only way he can come to close to making things up is to help the one person he every truly loved get into ""Heaven"". He leaves to go back to the Keywork to help Meri move on.  The majority of the album deals with the accident and Sirius' coping with it.  My speculation is that Carol Ann is also about Sirius' guilt. We only hear the obvious side of the story - Sirius and his love for his wife, but in the accident there was another car/ten ton truck. This car/truck held Carol Ann. This song is Sirius dealing with fact that he slaughtered an innocent and completely otherwise unconnected woman with his negligence. It's not just emotional attachment that's making him feel guilty, here he's also a murderer in kind. He is a monster. I think it's about him coping with that, as well as trying to make it up to Carol Ann's family.  The other theory I have is that at the end Decension Sirius returns to the Keywork. As a bonus track, Carol Ann comes after 2's My Favorite 1. Carol Ann may be after Sirius has returned to the Keywork and she may be an Entity he encounters, and this is her story that he relives.  Either way, I haven't had a chance to read the comics. If anyone has a better answer or correct me where I am wrong, I would love to know! The story behind these albums is unreal and I'd love to know!  EDIT: /u/Sentry_the_Defiant 's speculation about Carol Ann being the unborn baby is fucking dark, and powerful, and the song in that context adds a LOT to Sirius' struggles and inner demons and him wanting to find Meri again."

Oh I'm afraid there's nothing left  No pieces to put back in place. I was a monster, the things that I did I regret, I dismiss.   More in lines with what you said. His regret for losing Meri.   Oh it's a shame about Carol Ann And all she could have been. She soared with such grace As her body sailed through the windshield From the passenger seat   Think in context of the crash and how Meri was a passenger and was pregnant.    Oh mother did you see him coming Did you see him? Mother did you see him sneaking Through the back door? Still in the time we wish we spent but lost it all Oh oh Oh oh the time we wish we spent but lost it all   This is Sirius asking the All Mother about Colton.

Basically the song seems to be, like Gravity's Union, a song about Claudio's fear of driving. For those who haven't seen, he talks in The Afterman Deluxe Edition about how he is scared of driving because he has a constant fear that he will make a mistake and it will cost the life of someone who he cares about, particularly his wife. So while Gravity's Union is more about the imagined car crash, Carol Ann is more about the imagined aftermath of said wreck, exploring the loss and guilt he would feel if his fears were realized."

I just wish we could have more than 2 VIP passes :( I'm going to sit outside while my husband and his buddy watch the acoustic show.   I'm guessing the civic center is nowhere around the French quarter. No idea what I'm going to do while they're in there.
coheedandcambria,1kqpaj,ksandifer138,1 point,Tue Aug 20 22:10:01 2013 UTC,"It's downtown in the cbd, so I'm sure there is something for you to do, but my experience is the VIP sets don't happen too long before the doors open. Your best bet would be to stay in line and meet them in their spot once the doors open."
coheedandcambria,1kqpaj,ksandifer138,1 point,Tue Aug 20 22:44:32 2013 UTC,Thanks for the advice! Had no clue
coheedandcambria,1kqpaj,ksandifer138,1 point,Tue Aug 20 23:45:04 2013 UTC,I'm just hoping I can get mine in advanced. How come you're not going to the acoustic show? And do you know how much VIP passes are?
coheedandcambria,1kqpaj,Scrittertastic,2,Wed Aug 21 03:49:02 2013 UTC,"The VIP pass came with the box set that we bought months ago. If you bought the box set you can buy one ""sticky pass"" which is another VIP pass to bring a friend in with you. I'm going with my husband and his best friend. They're more ""die hard"" fans than I am, so I'm giving my pass to his friend so they can watch it together."

In particular there was one guy next to me who did nothing but complain throughout the openers, who happened to be two bands I liked. As well as people moshing during The Dear Hunter's set, which was primarily made up of pretty chill, non-mosh songs. I watched most of coheed's set from the bar after being tossed around for the first three songs."
coheedandcambria,1kogix,Rustash,1 point,Sun Aug 25 21:39:15 2013 UTC,Yeah the end of September. I don't remember Deer Hunter being there. I was left of the stage and all the people around me were chill. I guess it depends on the people around you.

coheedandcambria,1kogix,Rustash,1 point,Sun Aug 25 21:55:49 2013 UTC,Oh yeah maybe that's why when I looked up some of their songs on youtube I was not impressed. Well I usually take the time before the main act to get a few drinks ;p.

coheedandcambria,1kp7wz,oceanic_815,2,Fri Aug 23 21:31:08 2013 UTC,Or even another instrument playing the vocal melodies. Piano possibly.
coheedandcambria,1knj9o,tobbleflower,12,Mon Aug 19 06:55:06 2013 UTC,"Yep. The story evolves over time, just like songs change. Best way to view it is to get the major plot points from the books and comics and fill in the rest yourself. Speaking of which the comics and books help a lot to decipher the plot, however for NWFT it gets difficult as there is no book or comic for it yet.  Coheed adds audience participation to their music, they set up a story (major plot points) and you get to fill in any gaps as well as make your own ending (as long as it sort of fits the songs in NWFT).   Your interpretation of it is just as valid as any of ours. Welcome to Heaven's Fence."
coheedandcambria,1knj9o,chreestmao,6,Mon Aug 19 07:40:24 2013 UTC,Been listening to Coheed for a little over ten years and I still get confused haha
coheedandcambria,1knj9o,BSet262,3,Mon Aug 19 10:57:16 2013 UTC,"Same, hehe. Although I follow the story within the comics and books, I tend not to think of specific parts of the story while listening to the music unless a familiar quote or name pops up.   What I do, however, is realize that I'm listening to chapters and events within a greater story and that always elevates my experience from just ""listening to music"" to ""experiencing Coheed"".   Regardless of whether or not I understand what is particularly being referenced, the band always ensures I feel what is going on."
coheedandcambria,1knj9o,chreestmao,1 point,Mon Aug 19 15:20:48 2013 UTC,"I also don't really think of specific parts except with like Gravity's Union and all of NWFT (because I have to wonder) but sometimes I'm like, wait what is going on..? Also, sometimes I wish I didn't try to  learn so much because knowing that Faint of Hearts is really about phone sex sort of ruined the song for me :/"

coheedandcambria,1knj9o,Rcp_43b,4,Thu Aug 29 11:19:46 2013 UTC,"Dude. I may get downvoted for saying this... I have been a fan of their music since, really about 2007-2008.  I didn't find out about the universe part until a couple years ago, maybe 2010?  I haven't even scratched the surface of the story.  Every post on here about the story confuses me.  I just haven't had the time to dig.    Still, I fucking love this band and everything about them, I won't say its normal to be confused or out of the loop, but you definitely aren't the only one, and this sub is definitely one of the best places for support and discussion.  Also /r/TheFence but this one was my first."
coheedandcambria,1knj9o,Rcp_43b,3,Mon Aug 19 16:24:18 2013 UTC,What did you think they're songs from SSTB were about before you knew there was a story? Just curious. :)
coheedandcambria,1knj9o,jordanb3387,2,Mon Aug 19 18:09:05 2013 UTC,"I thought they were just a weird, creative writing style.  But I really started, fan wise, with Good Apollo volumes I and II.  It was around the same time I started to listen to their old stuff that I watched an interview with Claudio where he mentioned the lyrics telling the whole story.  So I looked up a brief description of the story and had a whole new respect for the old stuff."
coheedandcambria,1knj9o,CaptainRadical,2,Mon Aug 19 18:14:46 2013 UTC,"I thought it was about a couple. Obviously coheed and cambria. And before the comics I believed it was a story about coheed falling deeply in love with cambria then by a horrible turn of events he ends up killing her or she was killed. He then couldn't live life without her, so he wrote a letter a suicide note and killed himself. But this was all before they even released in keeping secrets."

The best thing to do is start with Second Stage Turbine and the In Keeping Secrets Of Silent 3, this album is considered their very best musically and story writing. It's heavy, melodic, and very deep. Also, because its the split that they made out of the whole ""emo-core"" scene and said we're more than a scene, it's a whole story."

It's not a very well done stop-motion animation, and in a few sequences the scene is bland and there isn't much going on (the scene with the spinning crystal, and when the syringes are in a circle, are just visually boring).  I get how whoever made the video followed the concept of a major operation being done, but this video just seems so uninspired. Personally I wouldn't have chosen this song to do a video for; I would have gone for Gravity's Union, as it's more dynamic and they could do something big and actually follow the story and it would be emotionally impacting.  Coheed is my favorite band of all time, but this video is just sub-par."
