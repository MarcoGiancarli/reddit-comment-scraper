But that's a secret...    Subnautica's worst moment is under the crashed ship. It gets dark, with the creaking of metal above and hundreds of feet of water going down.    In Garry's Mod there is a map called 'Honourables_Rest' or something. The game's not known for underwater scares, but that map is at the bottom of the ocean, with murky brown water that makes looking at the rusted, sunken ship all the worse.    World of Diving can be bad too. It's okay in shallow tropical water, but there is a submarine level and IIRC, the Bismarck wreck. It's at the very bottom of the ocean, totally black and there are searchlights sweeping the wreck just to make it visible. Freaked me out.    There are more moments like those in gaming, but those are so memorable to me that I had to say them here."

Kroehl and Ariel Patterson in Brooklyn, New York for the Pacific Pearl Company. It was hand powered and had an interconnected system of a high-pressure air chamber or compartment, a pressurized working chamber for the crew, and water ballast tanks. Problems with decompression sickness and overfishing of the pearl beds led to the abandonment of Sub Marine Explorer in Panama in 1869 despite publicized plans to shift the craft to the pearl beds of Baja California.

submechanophobia,3bwohw,Dinklebop,4,Mon Jul 6 20:06:23 2015 UTC,"When you dive, regardless of how open on enclosed it is, you should keep all your gear as streamlined as possible. My friend always says ""No danglies!"" Beyond it being safer this way, being more streamlined means it takes less effort to swim around, therefore more bottom time. It's also easier to do a dive like this if you side mount instead of backmount (standard tank on your back config like in the OP). Side mount allows you to unmount your tanks mid-dive and push them through, so if you get to a small opening, you can still fit.  It's hard to say how open that wreck is, but theoretically, you should have technical wreck diving certification if you're going to penetrate any wreck. That being said, sometimes when a ship is intentionally sunk for divers, they'll strip it all out and open it up a ton, and as long as you constantly have an out, have a buddy with you, and you don't disturb anything, you'll probably be ok. I'd love to be able to do this some day, just gotta save up some money first."

Photo credit: Reinhard Dirscherl  http://www.blancpain-ocean-commitment.com/en-us#!/photographer/reinhard-dirscherl  More info on the USS Saratoga: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Saratoga_(CV-3)  In early 1945, Saratoga participated in the Battle of Iwo Jima as a dedicated night fighter carrier. Several days into the battle, she was badly damaged by kamikaze hits and was forced to return to the United States for repairs. While under repair, the ship, now increasingly obsolete, was permanently modified as a training carrier with some of her hangar deck converted into classrooms. Saratoga remained in this role for the rest of the war and was used to ferry troops back to the United States after the Japanese surrender in August. In mid-1946, the ship was a target for nuclear weapon tests during Operation Crossroads. She survived the first test with little damage, but was sunk by the second test."
submechanophobia,3b5evc,autowikibot,2,Fri Jun 26 03:00:36 2015 UTC,"USS Saratoga (CV-3):       USS Saratoga (CV-3) was a Lexington-class aircraft carrier built for the United States Navy during the 1920s. Originally designed as a battlecruiser, she was converted into one of the Navy's first aircraft carriers during construction to comply with the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922. The ship entered service in 1928 and was assigned to the Pacific Fleet for her entire career. Saratoga and her sister ship, Lexington, were used to develop and refine carrier tactics in a series of annual exercises before World War II. On more than one occasion these included successful surprise attacks on Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. She was one of three prewar US fleet aircraft carriers, along with Enterprise and Ranger, to serve throughout World War II.    Image i     Relevant: John H.

Only 1 A-90 was lost by the time the project was cancelled in the early 80s, but it looks like at least the A-90s were in service still till the early 90s (reserve fleet), and the Lun-Class' status is unknown (other than being on a plinth).   I can't find any record of what happened to S-23 (the A-90 that crashed in testing), but presumably it was scrapped as that was the norm.

submechanophobia,3b381u,profqwerty,11,Thu Jun 25 20:46:30 2015 UTC,"FWIW, ekranoplans were actually a legitimately brilliant idea. In the documentary linked below, there's a quote from Kruschev where he says the ""USSR has ships that can fly over bridges."" Everyone though he was just joking or boosting morale, but these things were actually for real.   They could travel at fantastic speeds at an extremely low altitude and could therefore move more equipment and men faster than other alternatives. The only major flaw in the design was the lack of flying height, so they were essentially restricted to calm waters.  But had the program not been cancelled, I've no doubt that China and Russia would be still using them to this day."
submechanophobia,3b381u,hankjmoody,4,Thu Jun 25 20:54:55 2015 UTC,"I guess the minimum s speed is the problem, hovercraft seems to be the way to go as it can maintain the high speed on calm but slow right down in rough. Although I guess the ekranoplan just goes waaaay over it all!"

submechanophobia,3b381u,hankjmoody,7,Thu Jun 25 21:20:34 2015 UTC,"yeah the point of GE is you get much more lift for a given power.. maybe unloaded it could fly to 24000, but they were talking about potential 500tonne vehicles with 1000-1500 tonnes load, which is ridiculous.. not sure if these were built, but even this one could be the heaviest flying object ever built, surely?  that's like 50x a 20t Hercules https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_transport_aircraft you could carry most of an army with one ship at 400mph haha no wonder the Russians were interested.  even the 1 built had capacity of 100t, only something like an Antonov could beat that? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonov_An-225_Mriya"
submechanophobia,3b381u,Smiff2,7,Thu Jun 25 21:28:32 2015 UTC,I'm amazed  both that this plane existed and that you knew what he was talking about! commenting to find this later.
submechanophobia,3b381u,Smiff2,9,Thu Jun 25 18:00:09 2015 UTC,"Haha. It's one of my most intense sources of fascination, these ekranoplans. They're just unlike anything else in the air or on the water."
submechanophobia,3b381u,hankjmoody,3,Thu Jun 25 18:06:51 2015 UTC,"really interesting. they aren't planes or hydrofoils, but technically boats? and massive, huge load carrying capacity.  found this doc on YouTube https://youtu.be/pFA9q6wHGNc  seems cut off though anyone have 2nd part?"
submechanophobia,3b381u,Smiff2,7,Thu Jun 25 20:11:54 2015 UTC,"They're actually technically neither. Closest cousin would be a flying boat (PBY Catalina), but even that isn't the same.   They're technically classified as Ground Effect Vehicles (GEVs). However, due to a rather small community and industry behind them, the only officially registered model (the one in Singapore) is listed as a ship, though that's merely due to a lack of anywhere else to put them.   Edit: Fantastic doc, as well."

submechanophobia,3b381u,OrginalCanadian,3,Fri Jun 26 03:11:27 2015 UTC,"already discussed below. if you want to get picky, it's closer to that than anything else, really a plane that uses ground effect, and apparently can fly to 24,000ft.. like a normal airplane. although not clear if this altitude is correct."

submechanophobia,3b381u,Jeemdee,10,Thu Jun 25 20:05:44 2015 UTC,"OP linked to a photo of the Lun-Class. The large 91 image album in my first comment shows the state of the only one they built.  It looks starkly different now, due to the fact that the poor old girl is basically falling apart (and I'd suspect was cannibalized for parts to keep the A-90s op-ready), but here are some photos of her in her prime. As well as a YouTube video of her moving at a good clip. (That YouTube clip is post-refit where she received a re-designed tail and the missile tubes)."
submechanophobia,3b381u,hankjmoody,3,Thu Jun 25 20:20:27 2015 UTC,Thanks for your reply ! Fascinating aircraft. Although you can't really call it that I suppose.

They're technically called Ground Effect Vehicles (GEVs), but they don't really fit into any sort of classification. Personally, I just refer to them as BUFFs (Big Ugly Fat Fuckers) just like I do with B-52s."
submechanophobia,3b381u,hankjmoody,2,Fri Jun 26 06:56:01 2015 UTC,"Sounds appropriate, hehe. Their max height is something like 4 meters, right?"
submechanophobia,3b381u,Jeemdee,1 point,Fri Jun 26 10:30:08 2015 UTC,"While using ground effect, yes. They could apparently fly to 24K feet as a normal plane, but I wouldn't believe it till I saw it."
submechanophobia,3b381u,hankjmoody,2,Fri Jun 26 16:03:49 2015 UTC,Oh no kidding? They were just regular planes altered to operate with ground effect on the water?
submechanophobia,3b381u,Jeemdee,1 point,Fri Jun 26 19:20:30 2015 UTC,"No, they were purpose-built to be GEVs. I think the sheer power they put out though was enough to lift them even with those stubby wings. I don't think they could fly very high with anything other than an empty load, though."
submechanophobia,3b381u,hankjmoody,4,Fri Jun 26 19:27:04 2015 UTC,Ah okay. According to the wiki it was crashed and never recovered. That's why I was curious
submechanophobia,3b381u,hankjmoody,10,Thu Jun 25 17:35:14 2015 UTC,"Reading the wiki page, it looks like it crashed once as S-21 and then was repaired and rechristened S-23...which then crashed again due to build quality.   I'm just going off of how pathological the Ruskies were about secrecy in those days that they wouldn't have left their Caspian Sea Monster around for someone to find. Plus, since the cause of the crash is listed as 'known', they must've at least examined the wreckage.   Edit: Don't mind me though. I love ekranoplans and this is an awesome photo you posted of a Lun-Class, but it was an A-90 that crashed (prop-driven)."
submechanophobia,3b381u,hankjmoody,4,Thu Jun 25 17:38:26 2015 UTC,I appreciate your input! I just discovered this rusky spruce goose and I've been fascinated about their dynamics. I want to see one in reality
submechanophobia,3b381u,hankjmoody,3,Thu Jun 25 17:44:28 2015 UTC,"AFAIK, Iran is the only country operating (at least openly) their own ekranoplans. However, you can buy them privately, but they're much more rinky-dink than the big Soviet models."
submechanophobia,3b381u,hankjmoody,3,Thu Jun 25 17:47:43 2015 UTC,I know Singapore has some small single passenger colorful ones. Looks like a great way to travel
submechanophobia,3b381u,OrginalCanadian,4,Thu Jun 25 17:55:08 2015 UTC,"Yep. There's quite a few smaller variations that have been built. The X-111/112/114 prototypes were some of the first. Then there was the SAAF's 'Skimmerfoil'. Then there was the Tupolev A-3. Then there was this bugger that I can't find the name of. All of which were for primarily built for military purposes. Also, here's a photo of the aforementioned squadron of GEVs operated by Iran.   The one in Singapore was actually a prototype from an now defunct Dutch company. This is it. However, they are still researching the technology, so I suspect there is more than one variation buzzing about.   The problem with researching and finding reliable picture of these machines is that there's a lot of vaporware floating around, so I don't trust a lot of photos I find. That said, there have been several US-made 1-seaters made for the domestic markets. But they're the equivalent of kit-cars, so designs vary."
submechanophobia,3b381u,joeflan91,3,Thu Jun 25 18:21:07 2015 UTC,The little bugger example is very similar to the one I saw except it had a single fan on the top behind the cabin.
submechanophobia,3b381u,radii314,2,Thu Jun 25 18:34:33 2015 UTC,Yeah. The majority of the home-built or cheaper ones are essentially little hovercrafts with small wings bolted on.

submechanophobia,3a0z3k,blakespot,30,Tue Jun 16 11:11:06 2015 UTC,In the song 'Highwayman' one verse talks about being buried alive in concrete while building a dam on the Colorado river. That always creeped me out; enshrined forever with all that concrete and surrounded by water. It's like a claustrophobia/submechanophobia double whammy.
submechanophobia,3a0z3k,jeteaway,15,Tue Jun 16 15:04:20 2015 UTC,"I was a dam builder... across the river deep and wide. Where steel and water did collide.

submechanophobia,3a0z3k,mohavewolfpup,17,Tue Jun 16 23:23:38 2015 UTC,That particular area actually had a scuba diver go into the no zone. Think a rope setup like what you put into a pool to seperate the shallow/deep in.  He went past it and got sucked in. They wouldn't shut the turbines down so he remains (probably all dust now) to this day.  There is a B-29 and a PBY Catalina float plane that crashed in the lake. And boats of course

submechanophobia,3a0z3k,disgustipated,10,Tue Jun 30 07:37:28 2015 UTC,"I found this info:    What are the intake towers?  They are four reinforced-concrete structures located above the dam, two on each side of the canyon. The diameter of these towers is 82 feet at the base, 63 feet 3 inches at the top, and 29 feet 8 inches inside. Each tower is 395 feet high and each controls one-fourth the supply of water for the powerplant turbines. The four towers contain 93,674 cubic yards of concrete and 15,299,604 pounds of steel. How are these towers connected to the powerplant and outlet valves?  By 30-foot-diameter penstocks installed in 37- and 50-foot diameter concrete-lined tunnels. The upstream intake towers are connected to the inner diversion tunnels by 37-foot-diameter inclined tunnels; 37-foot-diameter tunnels also connect the downstream towers to penstocks and outlet works. How do the intake towers control water flow?  Through two cylindrical gates, each 32 feet in diameter and 11 feet high. One gate is near the bottom and the other near the middle of each tower. The gates are protected by trashracks. Total weight of the gates is 5,892,000 pounds; the trashracks weigh 7,024,000 pounds.

submechanophobia,3a0z3k,xxbzrk99,9,Tue Jun 16 20:34:46 2015 UTC,There is enough concrete in the hoover dam to make a 4ft wide sidewalk go around the Earth's equator!

submechanophobia,3a0z3k,biowumbology,4,Wed Jun 17 02:22:10 2015 UTC,I did go inside. Went through the entire tour. That place is fuckin insane.

submechanophobia,3a0z3k,Catness_NeverClean,3,Tue Jun 16 17:57:55 2015 UTC,"Mother of god.   My family used to take me boating on Lake Mead, and one of their favorite places to stop and swim was right up behind the Hoover Dam. My dad loved to drive the boat as close as he possibly could to the back of the dam, so these intake towers were only ~50 feet away, if that. It would always scare the ever-loving shit out of me, and it baffled me that anyone would swim there with these things deep below the water, sucking in the lake and everything in it.  Thanks for striking that particular funny bone."
submechanophobia,3a0z3k,user0126,2,Wed Jun 17 09:54:07 2015 UTC,"Can anyone explain how these work or what their purpose is?  Does the water flow through them and then out the bottom of the dam, pushing turbines?"

submechanophobia,39vvuz,KGBspy,17,Mon Jun 15 12:22:06 2015 UTC,Yeah this picture was confusing me.  The RMS Queen Mary is a retired ship that had all but 1 of her propellers removed.

submechanophobia,39vvuz,yepyep1243,5,Mon Jun 15 12:49:18 2015 UTC,Can you also see the bottom of the harbor? Is the light actually green or just looks that way?
submechanophobia,39vvuz,KGBspy,4,Mon Jun 15 15:26:14 2015 UTC,"The room completely encloses it I think, the light is white, but the room is still green like that, I think the water (even though it is really clear) is tinged green. Maybe a reaction with the bronze of the propeller? But yea, it is that green and creepy without green lighting."

So, the room encloses the prop but is it a glass bottom or totally enclosed room with a prop in the middle that (apparently you walk around but can't touch) but yet I read where coins are tossed. I'm sorry, just very curious. It looks like from some pics that it's a glass bottomed room looking at the prop in the water. Thanks for answering."
submechanophobia,39vvuz,Munnin42,2,Mon Jun 15 21:16:02 2015 UTC,"There is a balcony about 8 ft above the water and the prop is like 10 ft under that, it has a solid bottom, its a totally enclosed room built onto the side of the ship so you can see the prop which is below the waterline of the ship. :) if you jumped off the balcony in the room you could swim down and touch the propeller/keel of the ship."
