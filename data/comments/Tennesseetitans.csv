Tennesseetitans,3cvxan,tipacow,15,Sat Jul 11 05:40:43 2015 UTC,"This revisionist bullshit has to stop.  No offense to you, OP, because I understand that you are trying to look at things positively; I can't blame you for that.  But there isn't a PFF article on the face of the Earth that is going to convince me that Bishop Sankey was even remotely good last year.  My eyes told me all I needed to know, and no matter how much more (admittedly) PFF knows about the game of football than I do, they aren't right about Sankey being ""better than we thought"".  And that's because he was terrible.  It's like PFF starts to shit on Brian Schwenke, and all of the sudden, a massive amount of Titans fans have started to ""call for his head,"" so to speak.  He's the best long-term center we've had since Mawae.  Do we not remember Eugene Amano?  Or fucking Rob Turner?  I'd take Schwenke over half the centers in the league, and that's sure as shit not homerism talking because…  What the fuck is this new fangled revisionist bullshit about Andy Levitre?  All of the sudden, we have high hopes for this human pile of dog turds?  It wasn't even PFF necessarily, but at some point after the end of the season, someone on all the boards had the gall to pretend that Levitre was a top guard towards the end of last year.  And Titans fans are starting to buy it!  That dude is, was, and has always been awful ever since he stepped foot in Nashville.  He may have been better towards the end of the season, but that offensive line was in shambles, and if he looks good compared to Jamon Meredith, Will Svitek, and Michael Oher, that still doesn't make him good; that makes him less bad than the worst starting offensive linemen in the league.  Levitre has a 0% chance of improvement this year because why would he?  His offensive coaching staff is the same.  His surrounding cast on the line is largely the same.  And his offensive line coach is the same.  I just think we need to let our eyes do the thinking instead of taking some random website's word for it.  I mean, we watched most, if not all, of the Titans games last year.  Why should any fake stats website tell us how to feel when we watched it ourselves?"
Tennesseetitans,3cvxan,innnikki,3,Sat Jul 11 17:36:22 2015 UTC,I try not to think about Amano. It brings back the night terrors.
Tennesseetitans,3cvxan,steve_millers_joker,2,Sun Jul 12 05:57:52 2015 UTC,"don't roll with Sankey when he starts rollin then bruh, the PFF article should confirm what was obvious all season, Sankey was great at making something from nothing"
Tennesseetitans,3cvxan,jnm21,4,Sun Jul 12 03:00:33 2015 UTC,"Well my retort to that is, those stats I linked show that he was a good runner vision wise. Vision is the most important trait for them so I have faith with a better line and more coherent team he's gonna do way better.   Almost 85% or his run went for more than two (with that line, that's a miracle.) I'd be interested to see how many went for 4 or more but I don't have that data.   Also, none of us know the particulars of the blocking schemes used. So judging him as terrible, personally, I think is ridiculous."
Tennesseetitans,3cvxan,canibalxombie,3,Sat Jul 11 19:56:53 2015 UTC,"Almost 85% or his run went for more than two.   The PFF article you posted shows that of Sankey's 152 carries, 60 of them went for 2 or less yards.It also states that this is 39.5% of his carries.So if you add 85% and 39.5% you get 124.5%...Doesn't seem possible"
Tennesseetitans,3cvxan,canibalxombie,1 point,Sat Jul 11 22:28:49 2015 UTC,"Whoops my bad. Lowest percentage or runs for no gain or loss. I misread that. Strike it.   85% went for a gain. Which is a positive for me. He wasn't great, but he also wasn't bad either as he didn't surrender yards on runs most of the time.  I credit that to vision. I could be totally wrong, but I bet he puts it together this year if the line doesn't get wrecked again, for like the 3rd year."
Tennesseetitans,3cvxan,Typrestige98,2,Sat Jul 11 22:40:13 2015 UTC,It's all about how you see it. I always try to stay positive ..but I don't see how a 3.7 Ypc is better than we thought.
Tennesseetitans,3cvxan,Typrestige98,2,Sat Jul 11 22:56:37 2015 UTC,No where to go but up. He wasn't given snaps when the line was healthy really. Can't wait to see what he looks like when they're at 100%.
Tennesseetitans,3cvxan,jnm21,2,Sat Jul 11 23:03:42 2015 UTC,He was also taken out any time he was starting to get into a rhythm.

Tennesseetitans,3cvxan,OldSchoolMewtwo,3,Sun Jul 12 01:25:07 2015 UTC,"man, you guys piss me off, football is the ultimate team game, Bishop's underwhelming season was only because of his terrible offensive line.  If you watched every single game last season (hard i know) it's clear as day Sankey was out performing his numbers.  He would make shifty moves on defenders he was meeting in the back field (which clearly isn't his fault) and turn the play a small gain, not a big play though as the defense had time to pursue him as he was always being impeded in the backfield.  Sankey would've needed to pull a beastmode and break 9 tackles if he wanted to make the ""big play"" because nobody was blocking shit last year.  To make it worse, when he would bust a big gainer, it was probably called back on a holding call on Levitre's skunt ass.  To see the statistics backing up the fact that he was great at making something out of nothing actually makes me quite happy.  He'll be great next season and then all of you will be on his dick."
Tennesseetitans,3cvxan,jnm21,5,Sun Jul 12 02:33:18 2015 UTC,"Dude, I should've explained better, I like the guy. I want him to win and think he can.   He just had limited snaps for some reason and was reliant on a really unproductive Oline. I agree that this article shows his vision was better than his YPC shows.   Blocking schemes and execution matter way more than most people realize. If there's always a LB free then the run isn't going for much."
Tennesseetitans,3cvxan,OldSchoolMewtwo,4,Sun Jul 12 02:39:17 2015 UTC,"yeah i aint mad at you OP, i actually really appreciate you posting the article!  that tirade was more aimed at the Sankey haters n the Bishop's ball busters anyways fam"

Tennesseetitans,3cppat,batman0615,1 point,Fri Jul 10 04:17:53 2015 UTC,"A decent pick would be a high third round for him. But that's it both him and DGB perform at a very high level. If DGB looks like he is the real deal, then Hunter is expendable and we should at least get something out of him. But it Hunter isn't amounting to anything this next season, then the ceiling for a trade would be a low 4th at best for a team needing receivers, and 5th or 6ths are the realistic trades I see for him. But if DGB doesn't do good, then we shouldn't trade Hunter. Hunter's status depends on DGB."
