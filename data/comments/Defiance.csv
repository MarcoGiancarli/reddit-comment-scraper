Defiance,3dxj6k,Obidom,2,Mon Jul 20 10:31:08 2015 UTC,"I've heard that this happens sometimes. Try logging into the game one more time and see if that forces your character to load. Also make sure that you have the right server selected in the top right-hand corner of the Defiance page in Glyph. (It'll have NA, EU, and PTS as your options.)  If that doesn't work, you can try logging completely out of Glyph, and then back in to see if that fixes it. If not, you might have to open a ticket and ask them to recover your character. Here's the website just in case:  support.trionworlds.com"
Defiance,3dxj6k,outbound_flight,2,Mon Jul 20 10:47:24 2015 UTC,"Cheers, fingers crossed its still there, I know he is crap but he is my crap toon :)"
Defiance,3dxj6k,outbound_flight,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:51:17 2015 UTC,"Fingers crossed here, too! I've read about this every now and then, and most of the time a login/logout is enough to fix it. But if something weird does happen and the character got deleted, Trion have the ability to restore characters. It would be a bummer to wait, though. =/"
Defiance,3dxj6k,KudagFirefist,2,Mon Jul 20 10:58:00 2015 UTC,Also make sure that you have the right server selected in the top right-hand corner of the Defiance page in Glyph.   This was the cause when it's happened to me in the past.

Defiance,3dp8i4,Gomcha,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:29:22 2015 UTC,Anyway you could give me a complete answer? I am getting conflicting reports about this
Defiance,3dp8i4,outbound_flight,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:48:00 2015 UTC,"There's no official way to transfer your character, unfortunately, but it might be worth opening up a ticket. I remember when the game went F2P. some devs were saying they will transfer characters over if you were going to be transferring platforms permanently. It was a one time deal, and there was no going back if you changed your mind.  I'd say definitely open a ticket and see if they'll help you out. Just mention that you'll be playing on PC permanently and don't want to lose your items/purchases/progress and see if they'll still honor it. Not 100% though. =S"
Defiance,3dp8i4,outbound_flight,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:48:39 2015 UTC,"Hmmmm i might try that, Do you got a link for me because i know if i google Trion defiance Ticket it's going to come up with the Paid currency or something"

Defiance,3dfvsg,dat_joke,2,Thu Jul 16 08:25:00 2015 UTC,"You can always try running it on off-peak times.   This is really the ""best"" solution (the actual best solution being Trion fixing the lag that has been killing gameplay since the game went F2P). Go to bed early, get up early. Do some time trials over morning coffee."
Defiance,3dfvsg,KudagFirefist,1 point,Thu Jul 16 10:50:55 2015 UTC,"I can't even play because the latest patch downloads at less than 1-3 Mbps, and the installer won't let my Xbox download it in the background like it would anything else. I truly regret having bought a season pass for a game which makes me spend more time waiting for updates than it does letting me play the damn thing.  Time remaining: three hours and forty-five...ahhh fuck it, looks like I'll be playing something else instead.  So yeah OP, the server problems are real.  edit - just ran network statistics, my console shows a download speed of 30 Mbps while the patch is coming in at single digits. Been doing this all night. grrrr  edit 2 - finally got it done after the download got up to 7-8 Mbps...still took two hours. Wouldn't have bothered if I hadn't already been sitting next to my Xbox, working from my computer while I listened to the TV. Great game but gawd the patches are horrific. Easily the worst I've seen on this system. And that's not even mentioning the other server issues like everyone appearing as a default male, etc."
Defiance,3dfvsg,swagcrusader,1 point,Thu Jul 16 11:55:11 2015 UTC,"And that's not even mentioning the other server issues like everyone appearing as a default male, etc.   That's because of console limitations.

Defiance,3dfvsg,sliverbaer,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:43:30 2015 UTC,"Nope, wired. Like I said my console showed a download speed of 30 Mbps while the highest the actual download got was about 8."

Defiance,3daqy3,MagnusRune,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:43:07 2015 UTC,"We didn't sync the audio quite right. :( Don't think it's fixable now. Using headphones for now on, so in-game audio recording doesn't have to sync exactly with our camera audio (used for our voices)."
Defiance,3d47nr,Xiomo,1 point,Mon Jul 13 11:41:33 2015 UTC,"seeing similar posts on r/trove  and as Trove just came out of beta, and is trendin today on reddit, and in steams top 10 currently played games.... i recon the servers are dead."
Defiance,3d47nr,MagnusRune,2,Mon Jul 13 11:57:33 2015 UTC,My kid is playing Trove and the servers are definitely not handling the popularity.  The login queue is sometimes over 1 hour and the servers are down a lot.
Defiance,3d47nr,Stutturdreki,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:16:27 2015 UTC,"It's been shocking to see how popular Trove became in such a short time after launching. I assumed that since it'd been in beta for so long, the launch would be relatively smooth but Steam turned out to be a flood gate."
Defiance,3d47nr,outbound_flight,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:35:30 2015 UTC,"I'm not seeing any post any where about this,there is this post and a russian post on the steam forums.  i haven't been able to log in since tuesday morning,this all started after i downloaded and try to play trove. here is the glyph error [happens for defiance and trove] http://i.imgur.com/5mKNPd0.jpg  and here is what happens when i try to log into the website http://i.imgur.com/sQ4ET4Y.jpg  Trions main site works,but anytime i try to go to a page that uses https regardless of what pc or browser i use i get a ""secure connection failed"" error. they mentioned something on one of the twitters to go and check the server status and those links where doing the same thing. cant even go to forums-'insertgamenamehere'-com to try to find a solution,same security error.  Shouldnt be my router or setup as nothing has changed on my end."
Defiance,3d47nr,dt0980,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:36:01 2015 UTC,Have you tried to clone the MAC? Its easy enough to give it a go.
Defiance,3d232o,tekdev69,2,Sun Jul 12 22:13:45 2015 UTC,"Seems like he still holds down a role as an executive producer, which generally means he has some creative input as far as how the show progresses. But as for writing, it doesn't look like he's written anything since the pilot."
Defiance,3d232o,outbound_flight,2,Tue Jul 14 01:31:19 2015 UTC,That's weird because season 3 is the only one that really gives me a Farscape vibe.
Defiance,3d232o,squidgod2000,2,Wed Jul 15 23:05:45 2015 UTC,Similar question: Is Bear McCreary still doing music for the show? Or are they just recycling old stuff?
Defiance,3d232o,V2Blast,2,Wed Jul 15 19:26:14 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure Bear McCreary is still composing for the show, though I don't know how many new pieces he's composed for the season."
Defiance,3cyr0b,chrismichaels3000,5,Sun Jul 12 00:16:22 2015 UTC,"So, we don't actually know much about the VC from the show, besides the occasional mentioning from the characters, but at least from the last episode from what Rahm's wife described, it seemed that the VC are at the least reasonable and seem to have some sense for cooperation with humans. If this is accurate, it might not be that bad to have defiance run by the VC. For all we know they may be less selfish than the E-rep lol"
Defiance,3cyr0b,simpleisreal,3,Sun Jul 12 12:40:35 2015 UTC,"I can't see the V.C. running Defiance. The town has too much history with governing-bodies trying to force themselves into power no matter who suffers as a result. No one liked E-Rep, but the V.C. could be seen as the same beast with a different name to some people.   There are V.C. sympathizers in town but IIRC there were also a smaller minority of E-Rep sympathizers before the E-Rep came in. Your prediction isn't bad, I'd just wait an episode or two longer before putting my money on anything- so to speak.     This isn't a prediction, but I wouldn't mind seeing Defiance catch a break. A sudden influx of resources to help them build more protection and research new or more efficient technologies. I could see Yewll being interested in that.  What i'd like to see is Defiance becoming a greater force in that world. A bit of optimism to go with the desolation."
Defiance,3cyr0b,SanityDzn,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:39:16 2015 UTC,"You're forgetting the ship full of Omec in orbit. That invasion will be the season finale and primary plot for season 4.  It'd be nice to see the town destroyed so the characters could spend some time elsewhere, but obviously sets are expensive (which is why they shoot scenes in the same alleyway over and over and over)."
Defiance,3cyr0b,squidgod2000,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:30:33 2015 UTC,"I actually haven't forgotten them. If the Omec are indeed as deadly and aggressive as has been implied so far, then there is no way that the entire crew will be released upon Defiance or Earth. There will likely be some confrontation this season resulting in the destruction of the ship and the Omec within."
Defiance,3cyr0b,TheFishSeattle,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:36:43 2015 UTC,"Possible, hope not though, it would just recycle the same villian for next season."

Defiance,3cupbw,outbound_flight,17,Fri Jul 10 22:47:06 2015 UTC,"Alak: Stone cold. Or mommy/daddy issues. Either way, that opening scene was great."
Defiance,3cupbw,Bitrayahl,7,Sat Jul 11 00:14:25 2015 UTC,That's been brewing for about two and a half seasons.
Defiance,3cupbw,Hemingway81,3,Sat Jul 11 00:33:37 2015 UTC,"I think it just shows that he may have a little more ""earthling"" in him than thought."
Defiance,3cupbw,hobowithashotgun2990,10,Sat Jul 11 04:49:46 2015 UTC,honestly he's basically just a human with some influence from his Casti parents. Pretty much exactly the same as second generation kids in the US.
Defiance,3cupbw,simpleisreal,12,Sat Jul 11 09:30:44 2015 UTC,Well watching this show with my dad just took a sour turn
Defiance,3cupbw,Cortisolid,9,Sat Jul 11 00:36:01 2015 UTC,"Annnd, it got weird"
Defiance,3cupbw,RatsBeforeSwine,10,Sat Jul 11 00:38:28 2015 UTC,"After five years of Game of Thrones, the thought of incest doesn't bother me like it probably should. I'm not sure what that says about me."
Defiance,3cupbw,Hemingway81,6,Sat Jul 11 00:49:48 2015 UTC,"I'm an avid Thrones watcher, but this one made me say ""Nope!"" So what does that say about me?"

Defiance,3cupbw,hobowithashotgun2990,12,Sat Jul 11 04:48:48 2015 UTC,"So, weird question: Does anyone else get a drow vibe off of the Omec?"
Defiance,3cupbw,Voduar,4,Sat Jul 11 02:05:15 2015 UTC,I paused the show while watching it earlier today just to tell my girlfriend that they obviously took design inspiration from them.
Defiance,3cupbw,Drapetomania,2,Sat Jul 11 06:48:56 2015 UTC,I am glad I am not the only one. I mean I know they are technically space vampires for the most part but the daughter especially seems like a filmable drow. I say it like that because making up someone to be pitch black is neither camera nor actor friendly.
Defiance,3cupbw,Voduar,5,Sat Jul 11 16:37:25 2015 UTC,It was looking at the daughter when I concluded that too.
Defiance,3cupbw,Drapetomania,3,Sat Jul 11 17:26:54 2015 UTC,Someone last week pointed out that T'evgin looks a bit like a Namek as well but those boots she wears are pure Underdark gold.
Defiance,3cupbw,Voduar,3,Sat Jul 11 19:08:01 2015 UTC,I have seen and read plenty of versions of drow where they are dark purple and not pitch black
Defiance,3cupbw,PantheraLupus,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:22:07 2015 UTC,I am aware though I believe it is not canon.
Defiance,3cupbw,Voduar,2,Sat Jul 18 01:00:10 2015 UTC,A what?
Defiance,3cupbw,Riekopo,4,Sat Jul 11 10:47:51 2015 UTC,"This is a drow, a species in D&D."
Defiance,3cupbw,Voduar,5,Sat Jul 11 16:50:06 2015 UTC,Dark elves basically.
Defiance,3cupbw,RetroCorn,12,Sun Jul 12 22:26:55 2015 UTC,"Anyone else noticing that nolan has gotten, well, darker? I mean his character, before the whole brain scrambling, was at least a little compassionate. Nolan is starting to look and sound a lot like ramtac. Which I guess is the point in this arc."
Defiance,3cupbw,Allaun,16,Sat Jul 11 04:05:16 2015 UTC,"I see two possibilities: One, and the one I hope for, is that we find out the brain scrambling in the pod shifted a concerning amount of Nolan and Irissa between each other. Two, unfortunately, is the writers got slightly lazy and just wanted to switch the protagonist up a bit because angst."
Defiance,3cupbw,Voduar,9,Sat Jul 11 04:11:46 2015 UTC,Yeah let's go with one.
Defiance,3cupbw,Voduar,6,Sat Jul 11 04:21:17 2015 UTC,"It is the one I hope for it is just that this season is a bit Game of Thronesy for me to feel comfortable. Still, Irissa with maternal instincts really needs a scifi explanation,"
Defiance,3cupbw,Voduar,5,Sat Jul 11 04:34:04 2015 UTC,"Makes sense. I knew they were both acting out of character but didn't notice they were acting like each other until you pointed it out. It explains a lot, really. Like when Nolan skinned the doc? He seemed way too eager to do that.  And then you think about how aggressive Irisa used to be with those knives. It fits."
Defiance,3cupbw,Drapetomania,3,Sat Jul 11 04:46:05 2015 UTC,Agreed. And I do hope the season has an overall theme like this because otherwise this might be the last one.
Defiance,3cupbw,Voduar,3,Sat Jul 11 06:16:55 2015 UTC,"switch the protagonist up a bit because angst.   almost everyone acts off, it's like they not only killed off most of the crew but fired the old writers"
Defiance,3cupbw,nonliteral,5,Sat Jul 11 06:50:45 2015 UTC,I have been wondering about that last possibility. Berlin is even being a bitch a bit differently.
Defiance,3cupbw,Voduar,3,Sat Jul 11 16:38:23 2015 UTC,"One seems awfully likely, since Irissa got ""lighter"" to about the same degree that Nolan got ""darker""."
Defiance,3cupbw,i_bite_right,3,Sat Jul 11 15:16:56 2015 UTC,I do still hold hope.
Defiance,3cupbw,Voduar,3,Sat Jul 11 16:50:31 2015 UTC,Possibility one has now become my personal headcanon. Let's hope it's confirmed in the future.
Defiance,3cupbw,tso,2,Mon Jul 13 04:33:44 2015 UTC,"It is not unreasonable, either, it is just with all the GoT references I get concerned at what is being done well and what is being done to keep the audience off balance."
Defiance,3cupbw,hobowithashotgun2990,6,Mon Jul 13 05:42:11 2015 UTC,"There is an army at the gates, and shit is hitting the fan in town, the guy is possibly dropping back into old habits developed during the war."
Defiance,3cupbw,brian_acalderon,14,Sun Jul 12 20:30:15 2015 UTC,"Well, I think Alak and Irisa May get it on before the season is over.  Seeing Irisa around the baby makes me think she is going to go through a reproduction phase or something."
Defiance,3cupbw,HecticEpic,5,Sat Jul 11 05:13:58 2015 UTC,I was thinking the same during the scene with them in the Tarr house; especially now that Alak is grieving.
Defiance,3cupbw,nonliteral,11,Sat Jul 11 17:46:28 2015 UTC,"Is it just me, or is Amanda the coolest person on the show?  Also it's super obvious that Luke is going to be the one who leads them back into space if we get a season 4."
Defiance,3cupbw,TheCavis,12,Sat Jul 11 03:12:00 2015 UTC,"She's okay, but I have to admit to being a big fan of Doc Yewll myself -- she seems to get the best snarky lines."
Defiance,3cupbw,nonliteral,7,Sat Jul 11 15:18:19 2015 UTC,"First one, and then the other."
Defiance,3cupbw,RetroCorn,8,Sat Jul 11 19:07:20 2015 UTC,"I think my favorite line from her this season has been ""What this town needs is a sensitively-worded obituary."""
Defiance,3cupbw,Eternal_Density,7,Mon Jul 13 02:45:57 2015 UTC,Yewll is the best. And apparently she likes Amanda.

Defiance,3cupbw,HecticEpic,6,Mon Jul 13 22:55:51 2015 UTC,"She seems to be the one character who hasn't fallen off the deep end yet.  Even after her sister's fate, she seems to be fairly level headed.  I personally think the show has gotten so much better!  Ratings are climbing again too!  I think a season 4 is definitely likely!"
Defiance,3cupbw,DurdensWrath,3,Sat Jul 11 05:00:17 2015 UTC,"Agree on the point about how much better the show is now. I don't think it ever was a bad show, but the first couple seasons the main reasons I watched were because it takes place in my hometown and I love sci-fi.  I watched the pilot live and have always enjoyed the show, but this season has taken it to another level.  I would love to see a season 4."
Defiance,3cupbw,hobowithashotgun2990,3,Sat Jul 11 12:22:14 2015 UTC,"You mean except for how she blew up humanity's second chance for petty revenge?  Seeds, records, dna of extinct animals?  It'd have been one thing if she'd killed him before Nolan said not to, but she deliberately shot him."
Defiance,3cupbw,prism1234,3,Mon Jul 13 03:29:40 2015 UTC,I totally forgot about that...
Defiance,3cupbw,DurdensWrath,3,Mon Jul 13 03:32:18 2015 UTC,Nolan said not to shoot him.  He didn't have time to explain that killing him would blow up the building so she probably had no idea and just thought Nolan wanted to interrogate him.
Defiance,3cupbw,Draakon0,3,Mon Jul 13 07:12:05 2015 UTC,"Nolan usually has a good reason for things.  Basically, because of Amanda, humanity will never recover back to where it was."

Defiance,3cupbw,SpectralEntity,6,Mon Jul 13 19:06:15 2015 UTC,Does it change the fact that the only known refuge was blown up out of sheer revenge?  Amanda kept a cool head when it came to her sister's killers.  Humanity at stake?  Gun the guy down
Defiance,3cupbw,DurdensWrath,3,Mon Jul 13 20:29:15 2015 UTC,"To be fair, she did just learn he was a creepy stalker who raped her and basically terrorized her indirectly for a portion of her life.  On the other hand, surely there's some human who still remembers about the seed bank in Iceland and the other places dotted around the globe. Getting there is hard part."
Defiance,3cupbw,SpectralEntity,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:51:26 2015 UTC,"Seed bank.  But that had extinct DNA, art, history, vids... Basically a time capsule.  And all she had to do was not shoot when Nolan said don't."
Defiance,3cupbw,i_bite_right,2,Tue Jul 14 18:17:10 2015 UTC,"There's a deeply psychological aspect that I think you may be missing (do forgive if I'm mistaken), which is Amanda's actions was basically a crime of passion when confronted with her rapist.  Pottinger had essentially been fucking with Amanda for what was likely a decade or so, without her direct knowledge.  However, I can see your pov regarding Arrowhead, and the writers were successful with its introduction because it elicited the response from you that they were going for: Exasperation over the implications Amanda's actions have over mankind."
Defiance,3cupbw,Riekopo,2,Tue Jul 14 19:21:36 2015 UTC,To say nothing of the weapons Defiance so desperately needed. :\
Defiance,3cupbw,nonliteral,8,Mon Jul 13 04:20:16 2015 UTC,I liked that episode. I think this season is definitely better than last season.
Defiance,3cupbw,Bitrayahl,6,Sat Jul 11 10:48:47 2015 UTC,Absolutely.  This is starting to look like some classic Rockne S. O'Bannon writing.
Defiance,3cupbw,Abyssalstar,8,Sat Jul 11 15:19:10 2015 UTC,"Wasn't able to watch the episode when it first premiered, just catching up.  Loved this exchange, though:   ""Why are you dragging me along?""  ""In case your parents try and kill you.""  ""...Oh."""

Defiance,3cupbw,V2Blast,3,Sat Jul 11 00:42:38 2015 UTC,Can confirm xD
Defiance,3cupbw,TotesMessenger,5,Sat Jul 11 00:44:08 2015 UTC,"Wow, these rewards are getting lamer each week."
Defiance,3cve55,L1ghtningx,2,Sat Jul 11 02:24:59 2015 UTC,I've gotten blues and purples from doing incursions as well as 3 or 4 oranges in about maybe 5 incursions
Defiance,3cve55,felixtarlon,2,Sat Jul 11 03:33:14 2015 UTC,"Incursions and Arkfall rewards are about the same, in my experience. Mostly blues, the occasional purple.  I don't think score has a very great effect on your reward. I'm sure the theoretical chance of getting an OJ is increased, (and under a certain threshold, the chance of OJ is probably 0%) but I have literally dozens of 1st and 2nd place finishes in Major Arkfalls this week and not a single OJ to show for it.  Just play whatever events you enjoy, or whatever you need for contracts."
Defiance,3cve55,KudagFirefist,2,Sat Jul 11 19:48:18 2015 UTC,What are contracts? So far I've leveled up to around 1450 EGO doing just arkfalls and Episodes. Is there a huge newbie megathread that can explain stuff?
Defiance,3cve55,KudagFirefist,2,Sat Jul 11 23:10:03 2015 UTC,"Contracts are a set of weekly and daily objectives you can complete that will earn you reputation and currency with the various vendor factions. A lot of them are simple things like ""Complete a Major Arkfall"" ""Complete an Incursion"" etc. Some of them are more complex, requiring completion of specific co-op maps, expeditions and the like.   Most of them also give you a few keycodes you can use to buy equipment crates from vendors.  Hit J to open the pursuits menu and then click the contracts tab at the top to go to the contracts page and view what contracts you have available. Daily contracts reset each day. Weekly ones each week.  I'm not aware of any ""intro to Defiance"" thread that could run you through all the ins and outs of the game, but browsing around www.defiancedata.com is a good way to learn things."
Defiance,3cve55,MagnusRune,2,Sat Jul 11 23:17:45 2015 UTC,"if you have the DLC, incursions get you the 7th legion rep, with which you can buy lock boxes from the vendor."
Defiance,3cv56l,outbound_flight,3,Sat Jul 11 01:02:36 2015 UTC,"Are changes coming for BMGs? They’re abused for gaining the highest scores in events.   Maybe they are currently valued too high... but there's a point where they become not worth using at all. Having 1 out of every 10 or so people running about with a BMG in Incursions and certain arkfalls sure makes things go a lot smoother than scrambling to revive people every 10 seconds instead.  Incentivizing people to help their fellow players with heals needs to be at least as rewarding to that individual as dealing damage and making kills of their own, or nobody will do it outside of their mandatory 20 skillups.  Also, define ""abuse""? People running around using BMGs full time aren't topping events, that i've seen. People who are getting kills, dealing good damage, laying out important debuffs (BIO TO REMOVE PLATES FFS!) AND using their secondary BMG to save their and their teammates asses when things go south are. I really don't see this as abusive. I really can't see the issue with people actually making contributions to the outcome of the arkfall being rewarded while those complaining are probably those running around shooting dark matter troops with fire or failing to crit Bulwarks while they pepper them with infectors. The sniper on the hill that takes 2 clips of headshots on a Threat Level 10 fully plated enemy isn't getting first place? Big surprise.  Further, in my experience, score and scoreboard placing seems to have very little impact on actual rewards any more. A lot of 1st and 2nd place finishes at Majors are met with a blue reward. Most of my purple rewards lately have been from 4-6th place finishes, or minors."
Defiance,3cv56l,KudagFirefist,2,Sat Jul 11 11:04:58 2015 UTC,"You're correct in that scoring has very little effect on rewards.  I've jumped into a major event arkfall finale near the end and received OJ drops without even scoring on the top 20, but I disagree on your BMG assessment.  During the Midsummer Mutiny major arkfalls, the playing field was always an incessant glowing blue spiderweb from BMG healing, and there's absolutely nothing altruistic in players using them in this manner: they're simply after the MVP spot.  They're not very useful as weapons, so if players got no points from healing, they wouldn't use them at all.  There's a few things that would reduce the sting: 1) let players turn off the BMG effects client-side so players that don't use them can see what they're shooting, especially at night, plus it would reduce lag (could apply to CrimeFighters as well).  2) If healing actually did something worth the ridiculously massive amount of points it grants users like rapidly restoring other players' self-revives or repairing armor plates, hell, I'd beg people to use them (Area: Guys! We need moar BMGs on the field, stat!). The fact that the question of BMG abuse was addressed indicates Trion acknowleges players use BMGs solely for XP farming in major arkfalls.  And yes, they most certainly are topping events.  An example that stood out was a ~5200 EGO player that got the MVP spot with 78K points and only 1 kill... I was dumbfounded.  I was a distant second with 72K points and 68 kills.  Sure enough, the image of his character holding his spinning BMG popped up.  Other MVPs using BMGs weren't that blatant, but 3 out of 4 times I played sequential major MM arkfalls, the top player was always armed with a BMG.  I don't care about points; I don't earn XP anymore and, as you and I have both observed, rewards are not dependant on scoring.  What bugs is that BMG healers are parasitic: they rely on people that actually play for their XP while making events more difficult for other players by obscuring visibility.  The benefits of BMG healing on other players is negligible, it just annoys them, but the cumulative score for its user is significant. I wouldn't mind if BMGs were nerfed out of existance by removing the healing function or at least removing the healing score.  Level up to 20 in BMGs, vendor them, and move on.  As more players have discovered BMGs as a source of stupidly high amounts of easy XP, by the time the next major event rolls around the only way to bypass them will be to enter the arkfall cluster from the opposite end of the closest fast travel point and work backwards instead of playing it sequentially.  That way if the player is lucky and works quickly with a powerful detonator, he can have 2 or 3 satellite arkfalls to himself and get a 30-35K head start before hitting the finale infested with BMG healers.  But good advice on Bio weapons.  Bio detonators melt shields like chocolate on a dashboard.  Boom."
Defiance,3cv56l,DeadCanDerp,2,Tue Jul 14 21:48:45 2015 UTC,"I did at least 30 MM majors over the event, and placed top 2 in around 20 of those, top 4 in the remainder. There was a single instance of an individual taking 1st spamming nothing but BMG in all of those. The majority of the time, the BMGers were middle of the field.  In the one instance where the BMG user took #1 spot, I came in 2nd place with like 45k, after having arrived at least halfway through the final event and doing none of the minors, so I have little confidence the remaining players were the cream of the crop.  You say BMG users add nothing, but as someone who oftentimes has half the mobs (one major I had the entire final wave, just a massive blob of red dots on my minimap) chasing me out for blood because Bio nano seems to draw aggro like nothing else, the number of times they saved my ass in MM majors begs to differ.  Break them out in WM, Scrapper or Monolith major and I'll be the first to say put the damn flashlight away. But they have their place in other events."
Defiance,3cv56l,KudagFirefist,2,Tue Jul 14 22:16:11 2015 UTC,"I'm just hoping Trion will follow through and nerf the BMG healing, discouraging its already rampant overuse.  We'll never see eye to eye on BMGs, but we can agree the bio nano pisses off shielded enemies: they hate me too."
Defiance,3cv56l,DeadCanDerp,2,Wed Jul 15 00:24:42 2015 UTC,"The reason why I'm using BMG's During major arks falls, MM, etc is for the simple reason that I as a 1K ego rating in a 5k ego rating major ark fall do no dmg at all.. So why waste my time on bullets that do no dmg if I can heal teammates that actually do dmg and also get hurt by the enemies? The same goes for other events where I end up in a 5k ego rating. I'd rather support with healing then do minimal to no dmg at all."
Defiance,3cv56l,Teirakie,3,Thu Jul 16 14:56:39 2015 UTC,"Fair enough.  I used BMGs in events too, but only to rapidly max out my skill, and I hated them chiefly because they felt so lame.  But you'll eventually reach a point where you're on par with Formidable/Ark difficulty enemies at threat level 11, around 5500 EGO, where your assault rifle and grenade launcher will effectively strip plates away and frag hostiles relatively easily.  My beef is with players at 5000+ EGO that still use BMGs, particularly for healing, in major events.  They're there only for the notoriety of MVP; there's no need for that nonsense.  But if you're using BMGs because you genuinely believe you're helping the team, then that's great.  More power to you."
Defiance,3cv56l,DeadCanDerp,2,Thu Jul 16 15:57:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah exactly, that's the exact reason why I'm using it haha. As soon as I'm high enough I'll use guns, I'ts just that it feels pointless at the moment."

Defiance,3crj1o,outbound_flight,1 point,Fri Jul 10 04:54:14 2015 UTC,"During the Midsummer Mutiny event, T4 infector mods were wrongly added to the event's loot table. As a result, some players may have come away with purple infector mods with the Sol's Prominence synergy, either through the Defiance Store lockbox, as loot through the event itself, or through the daily/weekly contracts.  As of now, everyone who pulled one of those mods will be rewarded with a Sol's Prominence Crate in their claims tab for every mod they looted. Regardless of whether or not they were vendored.  From CM_Kiwibird -   Ark hunters,  We have tracked down all the Epic Sol's Prominence Infector Mods in Defiance! As always, we do appreciate your patience. We are in the process of awarding players with a The Emancipator: Sol's Prominence Crate for each Epic Sol's Prominence Infector mod acquired during the Midsummer Mutiny event. This grant has already begun, and this process will continue until tomorrow evening.   Happy hunting,  The Defiance Team   And from Destromathe -   This is for any Sol's Prominence T4 Infector mods obtained in any way from the Midsummer Mutiny event, whether it be loot drops or the Crates from the store."
Defiance,3cpnig,TheMissusK,10,Thu Jul 9 19:43:48 2015 UTC,"i think they must not be that white, and use something to make them selfs whiter. as earth bright sun is giving them a tan? so maybe they just cant be bothered looked perfect now."
Defiance,3cpnig,MagnusRune,2,Thu Jul 9 19:51:27 2015 UTC,That's a cool explanation!
Defiance,3cpnig,rain_wizard,3,Thu Jul 9 20:39:54 2015 UTC,just personal head cannon
Defiance,3cpnig,MagnusRune,6,Thu Jul 9 20:41:29 2015 UTC,"Well I think it works nicely. Their society seems to value whiteness and cleanliness - to them white is clean, pure. Look at the Tarr's house in the town of Defiance. They bathe constantly. It would make sense that they would also whiten their skin and hair beyond a normal level as a cultural beauty thing, similar to how women in the West use fake tan, or women in many Eastern countries use whitening products on their skin."
Defiance,3cpnig,rain_wizard,5,Thu Jul 9 20:48:33 2015 UTC,"The whole tan thing is quite recent, historically speaking. Somewhere around 1900 national pride got connected with athletics, and tan skin was part of that. Before then, fair skin was priced, especially with ladies, as it was a sign of a privileged background. If you had a tan it was seen as a sign that you worked the land for a living."

Defiance,3cpnig,myliobatis,1 point,Fri Jul 10 06:13:32 2015 UTC,"I think they're normally super pale, but maybe Stahma is looking more human to attract the purple guy or because she's so worried about Alak.  And Alak is darker because he's got the shit beat out of him."
