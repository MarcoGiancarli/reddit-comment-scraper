The guy who has never heard of short shifts, and has also never heard his teammates screaming for him to get his ass back to the bench because he's totally gassed and skating at quarter speed and there have been two line changes since his shift started. He's also the guy who plays the entire drop in time,  doesn't care he paid the same as the rest of the players, and is so tired he hasn't once crossed back into the defensive zone. That guy."

hockeyplayers,3e4upa,somethinggangster,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:15:57 2015 UTC,It sounds fishy to me. You use most of the blade on a pass. Sometimes you have funky angles and adapt to still make the pass. I can't imagine being 1.5mm off would mean much. Those stats come off as being made up knowing the average person watching won't know any different.
hockeyplayers,3e4upa,kr580,3,Wed Jul 22 00:31:12 2015 UTC,"I can see it being accurate. a 1.5mm change of angle on his side, may mean the pass is 1 foot to the left or right, however the other player would likely just make the adjustment and it would still look like a tape to tape pass."

hockeyplayers,3e4upa,GoSioux14,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:53:37 2015 UTC,"I don't think the stat is wrong. I think it's misleading the difficulty because contact with the puck on a pass isn't instantaneous. The puck is pushed along by the blade and you have a few milliseconds of ""pushing"" the puck off your stick to subconsciously fine tune the mechanics of the pass.  Oh and what Jeremy(?) said about the puck receiver."

hockeyplayers,3e141b,puckmeister,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:16:53 2015 UTC,"Really? I play in a Beer league and we have Men A, B, C and D for 18+ then we have Women 18+.  A and B leagues are full checking, C is light contact and D no contact.   Maybe in the US we separate men and women. All the Beer leagues I heard of in the states of New York, New Jersey, PA and Florida are done this way.  (some places they have less than A-D though but every place I know separates Men and Women).  I know in the US the only adult sport that is largely co-ed is softball but at the same time there is Men's only adult baseball."
hockeyplayers,3e141b,jayfred,4,Tue Jul 21 14:22:35 2015 UTC,"You might be in a larger market than most. I live in the burbs of Los Angeles and our beer league is coed at all levels. There's not enough female players in my town to separate them into their own league. That being said, I never chirp the women, only the men. It's not a conscious thing, that's just how it happens."
hockeyplayers,3e141b,NYRangers1313,2,Tue Jul 21 14:43:27 2015 UTC,Hell I'm in metro Detroit and the beer leagues near me are all coed (though there is one sheet that hosts a women's league in the summertime)

If there are enough women to form a full division with the right mix of skill levels rinks will probably do it, but that's not common outside of areas in the NE and MI/MN.  Every league I've played in in the NYC area as well as in MI was co-ed, although there were very few girls and most were former NCAA players."

One guy is from the Traverse City area, the other guy is from Grand Rapids and they were seperate too.  My cousin played in a league in NYC that seperated by skill level and men and women. I would ask him (he's currently in stationed in Korea) but I think this was he's league http://www.chelseapiers.com/sr/adult-hockey/division-classifications.cfm  There was a league in the Atlantic City area too, that had full checking at the A level division that most of our Dads in Ocean County would drive down to and play in."
hockeyplayers,3e141b,NYRangers1313,2,Tue Jul 21 15:17:19 2015 UTC,"If there are enough girls they'll do separate leagues, but that's not often the case. Michigan, Minnesota, Mass, and maybe a few other areas with large numbers of female players.  I play in the NYC league you linked to and have for a while, there's no women's division and there are a few teams that have women. It's the same at City Ice in Queens."
hockeyplayers,3e141b,awildnoob,-1,Tue Jul 21 15:45:02 2015 UTC,"It seems crazy to me to make hockey co-ed compared to any other sport. Basketball seems the easiest to do. Is there contact in that league? All I remember seeing my cousin play as a kid, there was checking but no fighting (same as my current league) and a cage on the helmet is required for all skaters. I have nothing against any women who plays in a men's league, as long as they don't act like a ""mom"" and make everything super PC and friendly.  I played one season of Co-ed Softball, all the women complained when the men cursed, or told dirty jokes. Playing men's NABA baseball is much better environment. Plus I get to throw over hand, steal and hit with a wood bat."

She can skate, shoot, stickhandle with the rest of us (including her sand-bagging brother). Anyways, one of our guys decided to give her board her in the corner and her brother was on the ice so he wasn't having it. Half of our benches cleared. It was kind of humiliating and awkward to be the captain of the team who's player delivered the hit. After the dust settled, I didn't want to keep playing because all these old guys just want to hit in a non-checking BEGINNER LEAGUE. They really took out the fun of hockey.

Having them line up breaks their concentration.   Also, you need to instill some discipline. If a kid is misbehaving or not skating hard then I would just bench them and they can watch the other kids skate. If they become better players then they will love the game more. I would try to find 5 or 10 minutes at the end of practices to play tag or soccer or something where they can goof off."
hockeyplayers,3e33l9,dangerfang,5,Tue Jul 21 17:42:56 2015 UTC,I like to have a shootout at the end. Keep going till the goalie has stopped everyone in a round. Player lasting longest gets some type of reward.

The good players helmets by the end of the year looked like Ohio States football helmets-just a fun little perk. Also, he gave everyone nicknames and put them on the back of our helmets in stickers as well.   If the coach sounds knowledgeable, I would focus more on making it fun for the kids, while not overstepping the coach. The stickers would be fun, and encouraging."

I love hockey as much as anyone, but when there's pain to the point of making you unable to play, you have to get it fixed before it gets worse. If you have to miss time because of it, it'll suck but it's worth it in the long run. You'll be back at 100% (assuming you have to miss time to fix your injuries) and be able to play much better"

hockeyplayers,3e37o9,badseedjr,2,Tue Jul 21 17:26:35 2015 UTC,Based on your description it does indeed sound like a herniated disk - check your big toes by flexing them into the air and pushing down on each with your thumb one at a time. If one is weaker then the other then you have a herniated disk.  Its due to poor flexibility and using your back too much to bend over/lift. Really concentrate on bending your knees when you skate.  The best stretch to help relieve this is the yoga stretch thing whatever it's called  that will help but it won't fully go away untill you get more flexible  Hope that helps!
hockeyplayers,3e37o9,goofygrin,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:13:40 2015 UTC,"For me its hard to tell with the toes. It kind of feels like having an arm wrestling contest with yourself, where mental control has an effect on it.  I felt like i was fairly flexible, however i am going to stretch more.   Would be nice to get this fixed because i was hoping on joining up kickboxing with my brother for added strength + flexibility"
hockeyplayers,3e37o9,Sal79,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:31:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah thats a good point. Its Prbly best to have somebody else help you with the toe test to make sure  As for flexibility that could be true - maybe you weren't bending your knees enough skating? or bending at the waist too much?  Just be more conscious of it, and keep doing the stretch/back stretch and you'll get it correctly pretty quickly"
hockeyplayers,3e37o9,carsonogin,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:51:51 2015 UTC,"It should be noted to absolutely do NOT do that stretch until after you have it looked at.  if you have a bad disc or pinched nerve, the compression from that could hurt like pure Satan."

Im 23 and a few years ago I ended up getting diagnosed with spinal stenosis and a herniated disc that was pinching a nerve. After a few months I went to physical therapy and it felt a little better but I still had the pins and needles feeling in my left foot and leg. I then got a cortisone shot that helped for a few weeks. The pain and numbness came back. I finally got a discectomy to fix the herniated disc. I ended up going to physical therapy after the surgery to strengthen my core. I haven't had any problems since. You should probably try to see an orthopedist. Once I got a referral to the orthopedist, he realized it was a back problem and I got an MRI that showed the problems with my back. I think that physical therapy can work for some people, it just didn't help me any."

Yes, your typical rec-leaguer is going to like feeling a few shots, so while you're skating around unorganized, a few easy shots are great.  But this isn't true for competitive play.  When I prepare for a competitive game, I'm coming mentally focused to the other team's best scoring attempts, and I want to warm up against my team's best scoring attempts.  Purposefully trying to take my head off is going to be a problem, but in competitive play I'm going to know if the high shot was just a failed attempt to go up high or if it was aimed at my head.  All I'm getting at is these tips are great, but in my experience as a goalie these haven't been the problems, it's lack of giving me 'game-like' warm up. (Other than a shot in the back, that one's universally true...)"

hockeyplayers,3e42xp,TehRhawb,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:33:10 2015 UTC,"155lbs, use a 65 flex. My shot has improved a lot since dropping in flex and now I'm not actually afraid of shooting."
hockeyplayers,3e42xp,absoludicrous,2,Tue Jul 21 20:34:57 2015 UTC,Are you using an intermediate stick or does someone actually sell a 65 flex senior stick? I'm short and light so I'd love to find a stick with such low flex but when I tried going down to intermediate sticks they would snap within a day or two.
hockeyplayers,3e42xp,TehRhawb,2,Tue Jul 21 20:49:54 2015 UTC,Graf sells 65 flex seniors. But you may still be better off with an intermediate depending on how much you have to cut.
hockeyplayers,3e42xp,absoludicrous,2,Tue Jul 21 21:23:13 2015 UTC,"I'll probably go with a 75-77 flex senior for my next stick, I think I'd go broke if I switched exclusively to intermediate sticks."

I liked how they felt, but I would've had to cut it quite a bit and that would've messed with the flex. I'm still experimenting with different lengths, flexes, and brands to see what I prefer. I may end up picking a Graf up once they go on sale to see how it feels.  http://www.hockeymonkey.com/graf-hockey-stick-g95-revolt-sr.html  http://www.hockeymonkey.com/graf-hockey-stick-ultra-g75-lite-sr.html"

I can rip hard slapshots with minimal effort and my wristers float off my sticks with ease.  With my 100 flex stick (DT1ST), I have trouble with all of my shots and they require more effort. It could also be the pattern on the stick that I am not a fan of, but shots seem to come off soft as well."

Just found a 100 Flex DT2 on Amazon for $40....it's in my pattern as well. Figured I could see if the flex was the issue or the curve. I might also toss a plug in it as well, to make it a little bit more flexy."
hockeyplayers,3e2xd8,ohno21212,2,Tue Jul 21 15:30:55 2015 UTC,"Hey Ohno:   Am in the exact same boat as you, and as per other comments, there is no better solution than going in to the shop to be fitted. I wear a size 15 shoe/sneaker, pretty consistently a 15.  I'm also 260lbs, so I'm definitely piling the pressure on my skates.  This in my case maps to a size 13 skate in Bauer Vapors, and they only make 13's in certain models:  old model X80 and new model X700. Watch out for those American Athletic skates, there are a couple of manufacturers that make big skates that are cheap in a really bad way, and will cause you heartache (and foot-ache, and ankle-ache), and you'll either quit or have to buy better skates later.  Personally, went for the X80s two years ago as my very first skates, and they are still going strong as my backup skates after skating between 2 and 7x per week.  Just got into a new pair of X700's and absolutely love them from the first time I put them on, very little break-in needed.  So TL;DR:  Don't cheap out on skates, you could regret it.  Good skates make a good start."
hockeyplayers,3e2xd8,RugbySk8tr,2,Tue Jul 21 20:07:08 2015 UTC,"Go to the shop and get yourself correctly sized/fitted. Trust me. I was one that bought off the internet initially when I learned to skate and just had to buy new ones because they didn't fit right.   Also, I'd recommend, especially for bigger players like us, looking to get a boot with a bit more support. Your highest expense when just start should be your skates and helmet. Look for the year old models that are at a bit more discount."
hockeyplayers,3e2xd8,mc3022,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:40:03 2015 UTC,"Get to your local hockey shop and get a proper fitting.   I just replaced my skates again once I got a proper fitting. And found out that I had spent a year skating on skates a size too big. And that was my local hockey shop's fault. They didn't fit me properly.   You should have your toe barely touching he cap and your heel firmly seated. When you flex forward you should feel your toes pull back off the toe cap. If you can't feel the toe cap when seated, hey are probably too big."
hockeyplayers,3e2xd8,knightofargh,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:50:35 2015 UTC,"re: sizing.  I'm a 12.5 (euro 46 typically).  I am currently in Bauer x50 10.5EE and I bet I would be fine in 10EE.  My first pair were CCM RBZ80's 11EE and they were too big (long, more narrow).  Depending on how wide and/or ""fat"" your foot is, you might have to do odd things to make them fit better.  My forefoot is laced loose enough that you can pull the laces tighter when they're tied.  I tried going tighter last night and I had more control (marginally) but I couldn't stand the pain.  ... I'd be wary of buying off the internet (I did, even after trying stuff on locally) then had to hunt for stuff locally (ended up buying used).  For those of us with special needs, the store might need to special order something..."

The ribcore line for ccm, and possibly Graf skates."

hockeyplayers,3dyskt,CowardlyDodge,2,Tue Jul 21 01:45:15 2015 UTC,"don't use the toe to bring the puck in,   when your on the ice handle the puck on the very heel of the stick, as close to the back end of the blade as possible and spin it as fast as you can along all of the blade.

hockeyplayers,3dyskt,TehRhawb,2,Tue Jul 21 23:30:49 2015 UTC,I don't think it will. It's much easier to get under a roller hockey puck because of the runners on the top and bottom that help reduce friction. Tilting your stick back is like a shortcut to lift in roller hockey - you can easily slide your stick under the puck like a spatula to pick it up. Coming from 10+ years of roller hockey it actually took me a while to consistently get lift on the puck after I switched to ice hockey since I can't get under an ice puck as easily.
hockeyplayers,3dyskt,the5thLight,3,Wed Jul 22 02:16:47 2015 UTC,"A little, I guess.  I always tell people to pass with their eyes. Lots of people mess up passing because they get overly technical about it. At some point, you have to let your instinct make the pass for you.  Whenever I want to saucer, I just saucer. I don't think about it; it just happens.  The key is getting the muscle memory down to the point where your brain says, ""I pass here now."" and your body just does it.  A lot of pros have the same thing -- watch the all star passing competition. A lot of guys struggle with it, but I guarantee they can hit those targets on the fly in a real game."

hockeyplayers,3e0l8q,orecticx,5,Tue Jul 21 01:05:50 2015 UTC,"Skates is obviously the most important item, if you buy really cheap ones you are going to want to change them after a few momths, at best.  Almost every in my beginner league play with the same helmet. It's $45.  If you're brand new, a high quality stick won't make much of a difference. Buy something relatively light but lower end of the range. Mine was $40 on sale.  I would get decent gloves since they feel nicer.  Elbow, shoulder, and pants you can definitely go for the cheapest option, since you probably won't be playing full contact for a long time."
hockeyplayers,3e0l8q,captainhook77,4,Tue Jul 21 01:13:11 2015 UTC,"First thing to make sure is, ""will I like this and stick with it?"" If you're just starting, try to borrow gear from the rink or some friends to make sure you like playing.  Now if you know you're gonna stay with it and wanting to put some $ into some real gear, then yes, skates are #1 priority. Go to a good skate shop and get fitted for the brand/model that fits your foot best. Don't go high end necessarily as they can be too stiff for a beginner to handle. Go solid mid-level and you'll be able to make good use of them for awhile.  Helmet is next, get what feels best on your head, that's #1, if you want, go pricey, it's your head after all.  Gloves could be worth putting some money on, what feels comfortable on your hands and holding a stick and protective. Never know when another beginner might accidentally give your hands a good whack.  Rest of gear you can get by with basic stuff til your skills and competition require better."
hockeyplayers,3e0l8q,Vuronov,3,Tue Jul 21 01:33:09 2015 UTC,"Budget $250 on skates that you actually try on in the store, budget ~$50 for every additional piece of padding. This will be lower end beginner stuff but there's no point in spending a ton of money on something you have no idea if you'll like. It's better to spend a small amount of money, find out what you hate, and spend good money on a replacement in a year or two.  I recommend a Sher-Wood 5030 wood stick as your first stick. It's cheap, there's no reason to spend money on a composite right out the door because you won't be able to use it to its full capability. Worry about composites once you can stick handle a little bit without staring at the floor and have some kind of a shot.  Also, don't forget the bag and jock."
hockeyplayers,3e0l8q,xzzy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:55:48 2015 UTC,Solid advice right there! And the best part about having extra beginner gear after you upgrade is loaning it to your friends who want to try hockey!
hockeyplayers,3e0l8q,trapasaurusnex,3,Tue Jul 21 03:46:52 2015 UTC,"Don't go cheap on gloves and skates.  They're longer term investments that are your primary way you ""interact"" with your game.  For the rest of your gear, I'd spend time choosing and money on (in descending order)  Elbow pads - Uncomfortable pads can interfere with your stick handling and shooting.  Also, if they don't fit right they could slide to the side - there is almost nothing worse than falling on an elbow without padding.  Helmet - A high-end helmet won't necessarily increase/decrease your protection, since pretty much all helmets are bad at preventing concussions, but cheap helmets are uncomfortable and heavy.  Mask? - If you're going half-shield, spend a little extra coin on a decent visor, cheap visors fog up and are a pain to deal with.  If you're going cage, skip this and move on.  Pants/Shin Pads - You can make do with about any decent set of pads here.  High end pants/shin-pads are really only going to be a difference maker if you're block a lot of shots, or playing in a full-contact game.  Your stick - A lot of people want to go out and get an expensive stick, it's supposed to be a hallmark of a good player.  But I've said it before in this sub: early on - go cheap and try a couple styles (heel curve/mid curve, low-kick/mid-kick, etc...) to find out what you like.    Then when you settle in on your favorite style, move up to something that you will be more performance oriented.  There's no reason to drop $130 on a high-end heel-curve only to find out a year later you really like a toe-curve.  Edit: Clarity"
hockeyplayers,3e0l8q,hkycoach,2,Tue Jul 21 04:56:41 2015 UTC,"As I just did this, I'll go against the flow. Buy cheap or used skates. You'll likely buy the wrong size and when you go back in 1-3 months you'll have a better idea of what you want/how things should feel.   I bought all my gear except my helmet used. Saved a ton of money."
hockeyplayers,3e0l8q,goofygrin,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:51:02 2015 UTC,"Spend the money on some good, upper-entry or midline skates. If you're just starting out, high-end skates might feel too stiff for you. (Mine were a pair of Bauer Nexus 400s for $160, though I kind of wish I went with nicer ones) and a comfortable, well-fitting helmet (preferably not the cheapest one.)  I bought gear while I was learning to ice skate for the first time, so I invested in quality shins with good knee protection, basic elbow pads with hard plastic caps, and nice pants with ample padding in back. Of course, this is after buying the cheapest least-protective version of all those and getting hurt.  I cheaped out on gloves and a stick too, but treated myself to nicer gear after I got better at the sport. (But to be honest, I still love my bargain bin sherwood.)"

I've heard of other Play It Again stores in other areas offering the same thing. You would have to buy the rest of the equipment, but the rental is a great way to get gear on a low budget or make sure you at least want to stick with the sport before you make a huge money investment"
hockeyplayers,3e0l8q,VolsAndPreds,0,Tue Jul 21 04:15:09 2015 UTC,I would personally never go cheap on skates. Good skates will give you a high ceiling for improvement in your skating and confort.
hockeyplayers,3e0l8q,elemental92,0,Tue Jul 21 15:15:11 2015 UTC,"Good skates fitted by a competent pro shop. Expect to spend $150 or so. I can't over emphasize good fit. Your skates are how you interact with the ice, they are incredibly important.   Good mix range helmet. This keeps your brain where you want it. All helmets suck at preventing concussion, find one which is comfortable. The more you spend, the lighter it will be. $50-70  Here is where I go against the consensus. Buy good quality shins. A puck into a bone offends greatly. You also fall on these a lot. You want decent mid grade shin guards. $75 or so. Make sure it has a removable liner so you can dry that separately, your shins will stink otherwise.   Gloves: cheapest you can find that fit right. You should have enough flexibility to give a thumbs up to your team and a jaunty finger to the ref. $25-70 is what I would expect.   Elbows: same with gloves. Wear both at the same time to check range of motion. Prices are all over the place. $20 will probably get you a decent pair.   Pants and shoulders: go cheap, but make sure they are designed for ice. $30-50 each probably.   Overall hit up used sports places if you can handle used tear. Really helmet, skates and base layers are the only things you want to always buy new. Because... Well... Hockey gear is disgusting and those touch you. I also would never buy gloves used, but I'm fastidious."

hockeyplayers,3dzj88,cgibsong002,3,Mon Jul 20 20:16:40 2015 UTC,"No offense but the reason you aren't getting a consistent flex is because of your stick. Those cheap sticks really don't flex all that well. That could also be combined with your beginner status and stiff stick. If you cut the stick 2 inches it may be more like a 90 flex as well. Also a 2 piece stick can effect the flex. So theres a lot of things counting against you  That being said, I would be cautious switching to a 75 flex. If you can get a good flex with the 85 you may not want to go too low. You definitely want to be comfortable with your stick. If you feel that you cant flex it at all then by all means switch to the 75.   Sherwood does offer a flex free zone which is really nice. I just picked up a Rekker EK15 over the weekend. Loving it so far!"
hockeyplayers,3dzj88,kingofthediamond,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:36:31 2015 UTC,"Not really sure why you're saying my cheap stick is at fault? It's a $100 tapered shaft with a bauer 1x blade. Not the best there is but I don't see this holding me back?  That said, I see what you're saying, but still unsure. I can get good flex with my current stick but only on slapshots and I really have to put all my weight into it. If I don't hit it perfectly I get nothing. I can't feel any flex on other types of shots.  I could maybe take a slow-mo and see what's going on."
hockeyplayers,3dzj88,kingofthediamond,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:57:52 2015 UTC,I must have misread. I thought you were using a cheap knock off 2 piece. My mistake!  In that case your stick is most definitely too stiff. You should be able to get at least a little flex on your wrist shots.
hockeyplayers,3dzj88,kingofthediamond,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:12:47 2015 UTC,"Oh, yes I understand. No I was saying I never learned to use flex because I had always USED to use cheap sticks. I now have a decent setup but had already learned to shoot without the use of loading up a stick."
hockeyplayers,3dzj88,TeamMATH,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:32:30 2015 UTC,"I get what you mean. The lower flex may help that. Luckily for you, you have a 2 piece. so you only have to replace the shaft"
hockeyplayers,3dzj88,TeamMATH,0,Tue Jul 21 20:06:36 2015 UTC,"Not being able to feel the flex is often a result of having a low kickpoint on the stick. I have a hard time feeling the flex and getting accurate and consistent flex, on wrist shots especially, unless I'm using a mid kick or variable kick stick. Then the shaft is flexing between your hands instead of below your bottom hand. Definitely check one out.  If your slap shots with all your weight into it are the only way to get flex currently then you'd enjoy a 77 flex, IMHO."
hockeyplayers,3dzj88,kingofthediamond,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:13:56 2015 UTC,"I thought low kickpoint was supposed to be a really good feature, not a bad one? Or you're saying it's good, but it's just harder to feel since it's not really bending in your hand but more below it instead.."
hockeyplayers,3dzj88,the5thLight,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:33:31 2015 UTC,"It's good, just harder to feel. I like feeling the flex, you may not! Try both and make up your own mind! There's no right or wrong answer; just what feels and works best for you!"
hockeyplayers,3dzj88,kingofthediamond,0,Wed Jul 22 01:12:36 2015 UTC,u/TeamMATH is wrong. lol he or she is the type of shooter who prefers to use a mid kick stick. and there's nothing wrong with that. He/she probably leans very heavily into his shot. You may loose some speed if you use a low kick stick though which is why Math said that.   The kick point is never good vs bad its more of which will aid your shot better. Low kick is good for shooters who want a quick release. Mid kick is for shooters who take their time on shots and lean in
hockeyplayers,3dzj88,the5thLight,2,Tue Jul 21 20:09:13 2015 UTC,"I do both.  I use a very high flex stick to practice weight transfer.  I use a low flex stick when I want to practice puck control.  Then I switch it up.  If you can, you should experiment with different flex profiles in different aspects of your game. There's no such thing as a perfect flex stick, just a stick that suits your style of play."

hockeyplayers,3dxukk,Knobdy1,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:01:45 2015 UTC,"There are forearm sleeve type guards for lacrosse that work pretty well for this. Basically like a padded shirt for your arm, enough to take the bite off a puck or hard slash. I know some people that use these, especially for inline, instead of wearing any elbow pads."
hockeyplayers,3dxukk,ICEYSports,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:33:32 2015 UTC,The new Warrior HD Pro elbows have a slash guard. Try them on though because they run really big. It's not 100% but pretty close.

Some of the stuff translated pretty well (I can Mohawk turn in one direction, I can crossover, even backwards crossover a bit, ave in confident skating forwards) but things like stopping, and really using my edges still feel weird.  I've been at it for a year, slowly getting better, but I don't know that I feel confident doing things outside of going forward and turning. But, at the same time, I find that really motivating.  It's something to fix. I want to know that I can play a game and not have to think about what my feet are doing. It'll be just as easy as running through an obstacle course. So, I guess I'm just checking in to say that a year in, and I feel alright, but not confident. Still having a blast though."

Ice time! - The fact that I now live in Southern Ontario, arguably the epicenter for hockey, means finding ice time isn't hard, especially in winter.

hockeyplayers,3dxr6d,TheFuckNameYouWant,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:29:15 2015 UTC,"I recommend getting some shin guards and hockey pants now. Especially if your end goal is to play hockey. This will break your fall. The greatest piece of advice I can give you is to not be afraid of falling. You probably keep your feet close together on turns because you know you won't fall that way. Spread out your feet and keep your inside foot in front of your outside foot. Point your head where you want to go. If you look where you want to go and turn your shoulders accordingly, your torso and legs will follow. Also, look up videos on YouTube of how to do it and then go to a public skate and practice in a corner. Best of luck to you!"
hockeyplayers,3dwz95,teachzim,5,Mon Jul 20 05:50:33 2015 UTC,"If you play men's league for long enough, you're going to find yourself in this situation a few times. I've played on teams that have won games with six skaters (including a 2-0 victory...thanks tendy!) and also games where we have been annihilated.  The key is to come out absolutely buzzing. Chances are if you don't score early on when you're fresh, you've really got no shot whatsoever.  In fact, our opponents last game only had six skaters and we had a delayed penalty and their goalie came to the bench. I said that if I was the guy sitting on the bench, I would've looked at the goalie and said, ""Get out of here, I'm not going out...this is my blow!"""
hockeyplayers,3dwz95,bthompson04,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:51:41 2015 UTC,"This is how I play these games. Try to get ahead in the early part of the first period, and then focus on playing solid D. You're not going to beat a fully manned bench at trying to go end to end on them.   I'm a fast skater, and I'm well conditioned. But when I'm play 35 minutes of a 45 minute game, I don't stand a chance against 2 full lines."

Literally every time I felt absolutely gassed and couldn't go on I'd look over at our bench and someone else would already be changing, so I can't switch with the guy who just sat down for a breather! So tiring, probably a really good cardio workout! Also, I don't usually have a gigantic appetite, but oh my god the amount of food I can eat after games like this is horrifying."

hockeyplayers,3dwz95,el_karacho,2,Mon Jul 20 06:51:41 2015 UTC,"This has happened on my teams more often than I'd like to admit.  While it is one hell of a workout, you tend to get pretty useless by the end of the game.    Excellent defensive positioning is really the only way you have a chance at keeping the game close, or winning."

hockeyplayers,3dwz95,i_yac,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:46:24 2015 UTC,"Did the same thing last week, just with 7 skaters.  Although 2 of us (myself included) are fat enough to only count as 1/2 a skater when it comes to conditioning.  I love playing those games, you really just work on your fundamentals, slow the game down, and try to keep control.  Our opponents had 7 subs and were visibly annoyed when we finished the 1st up 2-0, even though they beat us 5-2.  It was on conditioning alone, but still a great game."
hockeyplayers,3dwz95,GoodOleCanadianBoy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:43:27 2015 UTC,Happened last night but we had 8 guys and they had a full bench. It looked like they had at least 3 full offensive lines and 2 defensive lines. We ended up winning 6-0 haha

The only sticks with the Crosby curve is the ribcor line and the ultra tacks but they are yellow and black. So ribcor. If I had a guess its the lowest model. Probably the 26K or 28K
hockeyplayers,3dwoaj,leaningfern,6,Mon Jul 20 03:54:25 2015 UTC,"It's all just time on the ice man.  When I first started playing beer league after many years away from the game I would always size up the other guys, whether they were on the other team or on my team.  I'd think, well at least I'm better than them... Now I'm like, fuck it, I can skate with any of these guys.  Give me the puck, either I make something happen or I don't.  Even the best players cough up the puck most of the time.  At this point, I just make sure I don't make any shitty passes and play my position.  I even put it in the net every now and then."
hockeyplayers,3dwoaj,Badmathteacher,2,Mon Jul 20 04:47:27 2015 UTC,Always be in your position paying attention to the play with your head up. When you do have the puck don't panic with it and always have an idea where your opponents are and where all of your teammates are so that if you're being checked you can give the puck to one of your teammates instead of giving it away. The rest comes naturally.
hockeyplayers,3dwoaj,PAJAMASAM17,2,Mon Jul 20 06:18:04 2015 UTC,"Don't be afraid to make mistakes. Seriously, that's about all you need from what it sounds like. Guys in the NHL screw up constantly, so do the rest of us. You're going to screw up, but use it as a learning experience. Did you not soften the receipt of the pass enough when it came to you? Did you not pick your head up to scan the ice before deciding what to do with the puck? Once you get confidence, you'll just start making plays without really thinking about it."
hockeyplayers,3dwoaj,bthompson04,2,Mon Jul 20 11:55:29 2015 UTC,"Don't be afraid to fall down.  That was my biggest issue starting out.  I was always worried about staying up on my feet and because of that I wouldn't skate hard enough to corners, get to the front of the net fast enough, win battles for pucks ect.  I was also worried about hitting other guys on accident (kinda stupid thing to worry about looking back on it)   The most important part of hockey (in my humble opinion) is being able to move effectively out there.  Once I stopped caring about falling or wiping out, I started to push myself to do more creative and harder skating.  Getting over that mental hurdle about skating was a big issue for me, and it has helped a ton in my game."

I'm starting up in a novice league in mid August, so hopefully they'll have some pure training days. I've realized I can do a lot of stuff with my right food, that my brain just can't figure out in the left (Mohawk turns, kind of backwards crossovers, stopping) so it will be nice to get in game and almost be forced to get good at doing things out of my comfort zone, like crashing, crossing over to the left, and stopping without just going around in a NASCAR oval."

I would tell them... ""Do you guys know what my favorite part of ice skating is? FALLING!""  You would see their little faces light up and smile.  They all of a sudden are no longer afraid of falling.  Then I would go through the steps to help them up.  Within a class or two, they're falling and getting up by themselves, without thinking twice.  It really helps them learn to skate a hell of a lot better without the constant fear of falling. Its pretty cool how it that works.  Everything Rammer said in this post is 100% accurate. Good post."

Maybe make sure your child has good elbow protection, and gloves on for when he/she falls. Also maybe pad the butt a little too.   It might be a little discouraging at first, but make sure they stick with it. Kids learn quickly, especially if the instructors are good."

hockeyplayers,3dvp0m,TreeBeard___,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:38:15 2015 UTC,"I'm glad to hear that you want to join our great sport. First, the gear. I'd recommend www.totalhockey.com , www.discounthockey.com , or www.dickssportinggoods.com because dicks is having a great sale on clearance hockey items right now. Since you're 5'11"" you're definitely in senior equipment, so it'll be expensive. Also, there is a thread (Gear Swap) at the top of the subreddit ( /r/hockeyplayers )to buy gear off of other players that have upgraded to new equipment. You can get lower level equipment to make it less expensive, such as skates, sticks, and gloves, which aren't the most important in terms of keeping you safe. However, DO NOT GET A CHEAP HELMET! You want to go top of the line or the model under for helmets because you'll be falling on your butt a lot and bump the back of your head too, and you want to keep your head protected. If you're good at skating than that's a great start. You should watch YouTube videos and try to emulate what they do in a Public Skating session at your local rink to take your skating to the next level. If all else fails, taking a clinic and having your own skating instructor can't hurt. Best of luck!"
hockeyplayers,3dvp0m,AllThingsHockey,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:54:03 2015 UTC,Thank you very much! I'll definetly check out those sites and the subreddit. I do have another question. Are there any specifics when getting a stick?
hockeyplayers,3dvp0m,AllThingsHockey,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:51:23 2015 UTC,"As a general rule, hold it parallel to your body on skates and it should be between your chin and nose. Also the flex should be about 1/2 of your body weight, but since you're starting out, you should go with a small flex to build strength and form. In the store, stand with the stick to your side and the blade should be parallel to the ground. As far as a blade, that's personal preference. But as I said before, don't go out and buy a $270 stick because if you're just starting out, you don't need it."

hockeyplayers,3duysf,Jag94,2,Mon Jul 20 15:15:17 2015 UTC,"I have a decent sized closet in the hallway of the apt. I hang everything on hangers and leave the door open after a game. I use odor eliminating air freshners in the closet as well. When you open the closet doors, it smells like air freshners, not nasty hockey gear.   But the real way to eliminate the smell is to wear good moisture wicking under garments. Under armor, nike, bauer, etc... All make good stuff. I wear head to toe thin base layers. I even wear gloves under my hockey gloves. And i only wear it once, then i wash it. I have about 5 or 6 pairs so i never have to play in dirty base layers.   My gear never smells."

hockeyplayers,3duysf,OzziePao13,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:39:05 2015 UTC,"I was dealing with the apartment situation for a while. Depending on how much room you have available try to find a room with a window and hang it there. If a room with a window is not available, then go with the bathroom. Better to let it air out in a windowless room than leaving it stuffed in your bag. If the smell gets too bad then keep some air freshener spray handy. Any chance your apartment has a balcony then maybe make a little stand to set your gear on out there."

You have a few options, and size of the apartment does matter. I think the best would be a proper drying rack/ stand. You can fit every piece of equipment on it, and all you really need is like a 2'x2' space. Your stuff will dry out in under 24 hours, and can go back into your bag at that point. I have seen guys take fairly large cardboard boxes (say the size a stove would come in. Make it so it seals up, and put one of those window fans(the kind with 2 fans, 1 blowing out, and 1 blowing in). Load your equipment in, and let it run. It completely dries your stuff. Might sound crazy, but it really does work, is easy to build, cheap, and can be collapsed when not in use."

But before my center could get to it, the ref blew the whistle.   Without thinking about what I was saying or who I was chirping, I shout to the ref ""Steve, are you that quick in bed too? No wonder nobody sleeps with you twice!"" Which I really didn't think was that funny, I was just frustrated.   The other ref must have known something the rest of it didn't though because he looked like he was about to die laughing.

You may be pushing back with your skates as well, ideally you want to push them to the sides, this generates more power and improves your speed.  You could also push your arms back and forth instead of side to side.  Doing leg exercises helps a lot, leg presses and squats help with leg power a lot. Mainly speed squats, where you use about 50% of the weight you normally do and you go down slowly but you explode on the way up."

Couldn't stop myself from coming out of the locker room with my phone to grab a picture after the game, even though the sunset had faded quite a bit.  Strange but beautiful place to play hockey.

hockeyplayers,3dtyl5,BrummieRed,6,Sun Jul 19 13:06:35 2015 UTC,"What's the point of a hit, Brummie? To get the puck. It's a lot easier to take the puck from someone who is on their ass, but generally you're using your momentum to get between someone and the puck. If you hit him, and only you fall down... but your team gets the puck, you have completed a successful hit. If you throw a monster hit, and all the chicks panties drop, but he completes the pass to someone who scores... you've failed and your coach's semi-chub has turned to sitting on the bench.  How do you improve the odds, with each body check, to get the puck off the man? The mantra goes (for almost any style of check): ""Stick on stick, body on body"". When you see a guy with the puck, you have to figure out how to line your body up with his body and disrupt his stick while you hit him. He can't make a play and you've disrupted his momentum, slowing the game down (a positive for any defenseme) while possibly removing the puck.   When is the best time to check a player? Right when he gets the puck, whether he just received a pass or he's trying to get to a puck before someone else. His head is down and he has NO choice but to play it. Therefore, you have to learn to read the play to throw hits.   Don't get caught up with throwing big hits, they will present themselves at opportune times. My favourite was the open ice hip check on a suicide pass, but I rarely tried to go for it. It was suicide pass that I read 2 seconds before it happened and my body followed my read. His head was down, my defense partner had me backed up and I (almost casually) lined them up and didn't do anything crazy. A great hit feels easy because they're not ready to take a hit.   Finally, you can use checking to disrupt plays. Another phrase commonly repeated by coaches is ""First man takes the man, second man takes the puck."" If you're the first guy to check a player, just take the man. Don't worry about stripping the puck off him, take his body and pin him to the boards. The second player on the puck from your team on the puck takes it. Don't be one of those guys that runs over a tied up player, because now you've probably lost the puck and their team is shooting on your net with a 4 on 3."
hockeyplayers,3dtyl5,LaughingTrees,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:46:22 2015 UTC,Great reply. Thanks. I guess an issue is that I play D and usually play pretty conservatively (being new at it and quite slow) and am for a lot of my game either skating backwards towards our zone keeping their F out wide or protecting the house and containing rather than making contact. It's rare I feel even an opportunity to get the body.
hockeyplayers,3dtyl5,coneillcodes,4,Sun Jul 19 16:05:27 2015 UTC,If you're a fairly new player at 51 playing in a check league you're insane. Hitting is only half the battle. Learning to take a hit effectively and without injury is a far more valuable skill that takes time to learn at lower levels of hockey. Im surprised someone hasn't been killed at your league.
hockeyplayers,3dtyl5,aaronwhite1786,2,Sun Jul 19 17:13:10 2015 UTC,"I would never want to play in a checking league.  Even at 6'2"", I don't want to be on the other end of some guy's bad day at the office...I gotta work tomorrow."
hockeyplayers,3dtyl5,coneillcodes,2,Mon Jul 20 13:46:01 2015 UTC,Exactly. Or how about some dude that has no idea what he's doing and thinks hitting is just bowling around trying to inflict as much damage as possible. Next thing you know you getting blindsided standing three feet from the boards. Hello separated shoulder.
hockeyplayers,3dtyl5,bthompson04,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:42:51 2015 UTC,"Depends on the quality of the players. My summer league is checking, but it's comprised of guys that play college, prep school, junior, and pro during the rest of the season. The puck moves fast enough that you don't really have much of a chance to hit anybody. It's essentially more physical along the boards and playing 1-on-1s is a bit easier as a defenseman, since you can ride a guy off the puck and not get hit with a body checking/holding/interference call.  Although from the OP's information, I wouldn't want to play in a checking league either since it seems to be guys that don't have as much experience."
hockeyplayers,3dtyl5,aaronwhite1786,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:43:57 2015 UTC,"That's fair. I guess I just assumed of one guy in the league was asking about it, there might likely be more who don't know how to hit, but are trying."

Unless you're looking to buy two pairs, stick with an ice hockey glove (most gloves on the market) instead of a roller hockey glove. I know mission, and I think alkali, make roller hockey gloves, and at first glance they may look similar to ice hockey gloves, but they don't offer the same protection. They're designed to protect your hands from a 4oz. Plastic disc at 50-60mph. They will not provide adequate protection against a 6oz piece of vulcanized rubber at 80mph."

hockeyplayers,3drfmc,LoonWhisperer,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:03:44 2015 UTC,"Personal preference I guess. Mid kicks to me are associated with slap shots and defensemen. The snap shot is pretty much the only shot I use from the slot and beyond. I've played for 20 years and prefer a lower kick point as it gives my snap shot a quicker release. I use a lower flex than the average player though because I prefer a ""looser/whippy"" feel of you could imagine, but I get sticks for free so I'm not worried about breaking them."
hockeyplayers,3drfmc,bene37,3,Sun Jul 19 01:39:09 2015 UTC,"Try having the puck in the toe, lifting the heel an inch off the ice, leaning on the stick with all your weight and releasing. And of course keep your hands away from your body. It's easier to do with a shorter stick IMO."

Outside edges: if you can do crossovers, try holding the outside leg off the ice for a ""delayed crossover"". This should put you on the outside edge of your inside skate when done correctly. Simply step over and put the outside foot back down when you're about to fall. Make sure you have a deep knee bend"
hockeyplayers,3drzjr,austenzo,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:54:10 2015 UTC,"I can mainly do the /\ stop. When I try to stop I naturally do an L plow. I usually take my right foot and drag it along the ice to slow down. When I feel I can stop, I turn my left skate to stop after slowing down enough. I usually end up turning around and start moving backwards so that isn't really my way of stopping now.   Also I tried doing the l\ stops but my leg feels really uncomfortable in that position/ my skates catch the ice and start skipping.  With the delayed crossovers, I tried doing those around the faceoff circles and I usually just started sliding/scraping like I said in my original post. I'm not sure if my blades are dull because I haven't skated for more than 10 sessions since sharpening them. And when I do start skating on outside, I usually slip.

While going straight, I keep one foot going straight and turn the other one out to be pretty much perpendicular to the straight foot.  You'll have to angle your skate so that you catch just the outside edge and essentially slide/brake."

While we all learn the snow plow, single foot plow, etc progression, I found when I was learning I was trying to stop without enough forward speed. When you stop you're carrying enough speed to slide a bit, otherwise you can just end up in a strange unbalanced turn.   If you were to travel forward at a speed where it would be easy to glide on a single skate, if you put that other foot down, how is your single foot plowing? You should be carrying enough speed that you could lightly shave the top of the ice blue line to blue line.   If you're finding that you end up doing 360s at higher speed, your fundamentals are outta whack.   In regards to common mistakes, few ppl bend their knees enough, whether going forwards, backwards, turning or stopping, so that's something to always work on. When I was learning to stop, and when I watch others, I'll notice they kind of stand up after rotating when trying to stop. You need to kind of sit down into the stop, not stand up straighter. The harder you sit down, the faster you stop. You want to end up stopping with a wide base as well, not with your feet on top of each other. That wide base helps with confidence.   It took me months of skating to figure out how to stop effectively. Now looking back I realize it's 99% mental. You've gotta carry a little bit of speed and just commit to it. I also went to a more shallow hollow which helped me learn that initial rotation, without too much edge bite, which would either make me fall or hurt my confidence to commit to the stop. I've now started making my way back down to a more narrow hallow."
hockeyplayers,3drse9,glid3r,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:38:17 2015 UTC,"Keep your head up, knees bent and back straight. If bending your knees is difficult try leaving the top eyelet on your skates untied. You need to have your weight in the middle of the blades for stopping. Check youtube channels how to hockey, hockey movement and hockey tutorial for more tips. Remember to practice both sides equally."
hockeyplayers,3drse9,bene37,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:38:37 2015 UTC,"A What Not To Do:  Don't stand up. Don't focus on your feet.  If you think you're low, get lower. A lot of people stiffen up and rise out of their hockey-ready position when they go to stop. Keep your head up, don't focus on your feet (focus on a point ahead of you) and don't let your shoulders dip.  Edit: Remember when you were young and learning to ride a bike? When you stopped looking down at your pedals or the front wheel and started looking out ahead of you 10 or 20 feet, a lot of the wobbly balance issues started to smooth out. Try it with stopping. Focus on the boards in front of you and not on your skates."

hockeyplayers,3drse9,goofygrin,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:12:28 2015 UTC,"In addition to changing the edge on your skates, something that helps me get the right feel (works for skiing too) is to feel like you're pressing a quarter under your big toe.

My haul was:   Two game jerseys for $40 ($20 a pop) Bauer 9900 Helmet used for $5 (could have gotten a new one for $10, but it was mission a foam piece. In hindsight I should have grabbed a used and the new one and just swapped the foam piece out) 2 sets of game socks ($1 a set. Unfortunately I was too excited and got two mismatching whites but oh well.) Bauer APX brand new for $30 Bauer RX10 Goal Stick new for $30   They had a lot of this years model sticks for $100. A lot of what was there was from the Women's National team so a lot of the sticks were intermediates and super whippy which is nice for a smaller guy like me.  The sale was for only 2 days, and ended today.

hockeyplayers,3dpp39,stevegcook,1 point,Sat Jul 18 06:36:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that chart is completely out of whack in a few areas.  Seems to be mashing together skates from different eras somehow."
hockeyplayers,3dpp39,StevenWongo,2,Sat Jul 18 07:12:01 2015 UTC,I believe the straight comparison to Bauers are as follows.   Tacks - Nexus (widest)  Ribcor - Vapor (tightest)  Jetspeed - Supreme (bit more snug but loose?)  Can't exactly remember at this moment since I'm too tired. But I believe this is how they are at this moment.
hockeyplayers,3dpp39,combustion_assaulter,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:22:50 2015 UTC,Just swap the Vapors for the Supremes and you are good to go.  Jetspeeds- Vapor ( tight around the ankle and looser in the toe box)  Ribcor- Supreme (Tightest skates)
hockeyplayers,3dpbmf,Jag94,3,Sat Jul 18 03:49:55 2015 UTC,"it comes down to a few factors. What fits right? what feels best on your particular foot? how much do you play? When trying them on, you want to have:no heel lift, good wrap around fit, NO pain (maybe some break in stiffness in higher models mentioned) and enough room for your toes and front width of the foot without feeling compressed, cramped, or squeezed. Take your time, and try a few on. sit in them for at least 5 minutes and take a stroll around the store. bring a proper hockey sock (tight fitting, thin, and tall enough to clear the tendon guard) to make sure the fit is correct. If you play 3-4 times a week I could see justifying an x90 or up. less than that, the x80/x70 is plenty of skate.  I've worn a lot of pro and non-pro models, and it does make a difference. Currently I am in (brand new old stock) 6 model old Nike-Bauer one95s. they were top end, and my particular foot profile works well with them (albeit with a slight stretch in the instep). That being said, the current gen MX3 hurts my foot like a b*tch. same size and claimed same fit profile. I wore a nexus 6000, but the 8000 hurt my feet. I wore a 20k, but an 18k hurt. I also play goal and wear a different fit and ize. 10.5d Bauer player, 10EE Graf goal skate (was in a 9.5ee bauer as well). Do yourself a favor and get fitted properly. different models fit differently (obviously) and you may/will size differently. try a ton of models on even if you have no interest in them (I HIGHLY reccomend the new ccm jetspeed 300's, feel amazing!!!). Just experiment with sizes and models until you are comfortable. The higher end you go, the more carbon based the boot is. stiffer boot= better energy transfer, or a more power and control of your stride. You also get better quality steel, tendon guard, and other features.   Personally, the x100 is the best value of last years vapor lineup. the only difference between that and an APX2 is: no fusion steel on the x100 (which was shit honestly, broke faster than uncooked spaghetti) and no ridiculous one piece eyelet system from the apx2 (again, i disliked it very much). Most guys wearing vapor boots in the NHL are wearing the x100 and x90 for a reason.  I hope I was of some help. If you need any more info, feel free to drop me a PM. I fit skates for a living lol"

I have small feet.  When at a shop today, I put my foot on the Bauer sizing plate.  It said size 6 for one foot, and 5.5 for the other.  The way I understand it, Junior sizes go up to 5.5, and senior start at 6.  My question, is the difference between ""Junior"" and ""Senior"" skates SPECIFICALLY related to the sizing? Or are there actual material differences between the skate?  For example, the APX2 in a junior skate, vs the APX2 in a senior skate... is it the exact same skate? Or are the junior sizes not made with the same durability in mind?    Does this make any sense?"

A $700 pair and a $350 often have the same steel configuration. From that point on all that matters is how well they are sharpened.

hockeyplayers,3dmhhf,Terrrrm66,8,Fri Jul 17 13:50:46 2015 UTC,"Hey man, glad to see you came over,  Look on the side bar for some basic guides, dealing with equipment, playing and everything inbetween.  If you never set foot on ice, i would say go to public skate, rent skate and go for it. If finding a rink is going to be a problem, you might need to settle for inline if you're not up to making the trip.  Your not going to start off in a high level physical league, look for learn to play, intro to hockey classes. You are taught how to skate, forward, backward, proper stances and techniques, and usually they have scrimmages at the end.  Two most important pieces of equipment are skates and helmets. Don't go cheap on these as they protect your noggin and feet. Both i think i dont need to tell you are important in life not just hockey :P  Purehockey.com is having a sale so you could pick up some nice sticks on the cheap  For skates find a shop with knowledgeable staff. Trust me, took me 4 places to find a place i was comfortable with buying skates. I have weak ankles and am flatfooted. no pain on the ice for me(at least not the feet)  The rest will come as you learn. Dont be discouraged and just have fun. Theres a bunch of little stuff as well that can be useful as well to help you off the ice as well, such as buying a green biscuit or some golfballs for off ice stick handling."
hockeyplayers,3dmhhf,Nicholasagn,2,Fri Jul 17 14:07:17 2015 UTC,"To add to this, going off of what you said about fear of massive failure, allow me to say this. You will fail initially, a fucking lot. You're gonna go to a public skate and your first time on the ice you will slip and fall and it will hurt a lot. You will keep falling every time you step out on the ice and it will keep hurting (until you get elbow and sin guards) and be frustrating (even after you get elbow and shinguards) but you'll continue to do it. But just remember that cliche Rocky quote 'it's not about how hard you hit, it's about how hard you get hit and keep hitting back'. It isn't about how many times you fall, it's about how many times you keep getting back up, literally. Unlike so many things in life, falling is progress in hockey. If you're not falling you're not trying hard enough.   TL;DR Don't be afraid to fail because it's inevitable, just get up, dust yourself off, and do it again."
hockeyplayers,3dmhhf,Lndbrghwrstlr,2,Fri Jul 17 20:29:51 2015 UTC,"Skate fit is extremely important.  Check to see if the rink you're close to has a pro shop.  If they do, tell them you're new and are looking for skates.  Skates should not be loose, but also shouldn't make your feet go numb.    There are a bunch of rules for fit like toes brushing the front of the skate, the pencil test.  There should be some really in depth guides on the right hand side of the sub.  They should give you pretty much everything you need to know about getting started.  One thing I didn't mention in your other thread was the lie of your stick.  That's pretty important.  The higher the lie number, the higher the angle from the shaft to the blade.  If you stick handle close to your body, you want a higher lie so the full length of the blade bottom stays in contact with the ice.  If you stick handle farther from your body, you want a lower lie for the same reason.  Otherwise you may end up missing passes or whiffing on shots if only part of your blade is in contact with the ice."
hockeyplayers,3dmhhf,mytummyaches,2,Fri Jul 17 14:04:03 2015 UTC,"Oh also, if your height is discouraging you, focus on your strengths. No use worrying over things you cannot change.

Look at Martin St.Louis or Mats Zuccarello, and how they play when fairing against taller players."
hockeyplayers,3dmhhf,Nicholasagn,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:37:54 2015 UTC,"My height does discourage me but i'm broad for my height, broader than some players i've seen being 6ft and above.

hockeyplayers,3dmhhf,cdnmute,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:48:27 2015 UTC,"You will likely playing in non-contact leagues for the majority of your life, do not let your height/weight dictate your position. You can absolutely play D if that's what you're interested in. In Rec leagues being a good D means skating well backwards, angling guys to the boards (with positioning, not strength) and making a great first pass. If I were you I would try wing, centre and D. Give each one a fair effort and see what you prefer."
hockeyplayers,3dmhhf,shotgoto,2,Fri Jul 17 19:40:15 2015 UTC,"I started skating a year ago and as a fellow 5'7"", and with short limbs, I get the ""wide"" fit pads in intermediate sizes. Everything comes out cheaper than getting senior sizes!  You want to get the right skates for your feet, or else you will be in pain that keeps you off the ice. It's even worse if your feet are of abnormal shape - flat sole, tall and wide like mine. I skate in a Bauer supreme 160 with superfeet yellow insoles.  For sticks, I think you should wait out on getting them until you can skate forward and stop confidently on at least one side. When you do get a stick though, I recommend an intermediate stick with low flex around 50-70. If you must cut it, even lower. I use a 55 flex.  Also, don't count out defense! I'm in a beginner league and I get away with a lot of pushing and shoving because I'm a midget compared to others. Sure I never get a breakaway - I didn't when I was a forward starting out either - but it feels good helping my goalie and being able to see the whole play on the point in the offensive zone.  Good luck!"
hockeyplayers,3dmhhf,chamclouder,2,Fri Jul 17 15:59:35 2015 UTC,"Being big as a defender might be something a pro team would scout for but you can play D at 5'7''. Pro teams want bigger D to protect the front of the net. Playing beer league D, which is generally no-check/ limited contact, does not require a specific height or weight. It is true that bigger D do put harder shots on net but at beer league level it doesnt matter much. Just make sure the shot is on target and low. Wing is not a bad choice but what side? Are you a right shot or left? Would you like to shoot more or pass? A lefty on the left side will more often be feeding passes to the center or right wing as they dont have the best angle for a quality shot. A lefty on the right side will have a better angle for shots and rebounds."
hockeyplayers,3dmhhf,TehRhawb,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:16:27 2015 UTC,"Like others have said, try to find a pro shop so you can get properly fitted for skates. This is going to have the biggest impact on your enjoyment of the sport - improperly fitted skates can make your feet and ankles hurt plus they make skating more difficult. Invest in a good helmet too - you WILL fall, so make sure you're protected.  As for sticks, don't worry too much at first, you will need to develop your shot before you notice much of a difference. The rule of thumb is that flex should be about half your weight, otherwise experiment with different blades each time you get a new stick and see what feels best to you.  Other than that, just get out and skate then work your way up through stick and puck sessions, skills clinics, then eventually join a rookie league. Good luck and have fun!"
hockeyplayers,3dmhhf,themaincop,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:25:44 2015 UTC,"Find a learn to skate class, then a learn to play class.  Hockey is all about skating and at the lower levels if you are a better skater than your peers you will be a better player.  Go to every public skate you can get to and always be pushing your skating skills to the next level (eg. forward stride, crossovers, crossovers on your bad side, tight turns, tight turns on your bad side, snow plough stop, one foot stop, hockey stop, one foot stop on your bad side, hockey stop on your bad side, backwards skating, backwards crossovers, backwards crossovers on your bad side should keep you busy for a couple of years).    In the meantime, you can buy a cheapie hockey stick and a green biscuit or stick handling ball to work on your stick handling at home.  Try to stick handle every day if you can.    Prepare to get obsessed.  I don't think there's anything in the world more fun than playing hockey.  Going from 0 to competent feels like a bit of a long road but in a few months when you're making big plays in beginner league you'll be happy you put the work in."

Went to rink and practiced skating only first. check all technics and tips from internet, then try it over and over again during public skating. If you're an aging dude like me, consider wearing knees, elbows pads and wrist guards. You will not look dumb, you will look like someone who will not break a wrist on the first day :P Falling on ice at 30 is much more painful than when you're 9 or 10...  When you're confident skating forward, backward and most important : When you know how to stop properly, then you can get the rest of hockey equipment and start playing... Play.  I don't know how it is in the UK, but in Switzerland, we have few hours of ""free hockey"" where people just gather and play just for fun (no physical play at all, no penalties etc..) that'll help you learn and just enjoy...

Armor: you can go cheap on everything EXCEPT your helmet  Skates: finding the perfect fit is important, I would go to a store and have a professional help you with that  Stick: at your level I don't think it is crucial to find the ""perfect"" stick.  I would focus on finding the right length for now.  Best way to find that out is wear your skates or go on tippy toes and start playing around with different lengths.  Go with whichever is most ""natural"".  Do you plan on taking skating lessons?  You may be able to learn simply by going to an open skate (wear your gear, especially your helmet) after watching some clips on youtube.  If you can skate forward, turn, and stop.  I think you are ready to play some beginner hockey.  All players who are starting out should play forward.  That is because playing defense requires you to skate backwards and be a strong skater overall."

hockeyplayers,3dn6jn,nick92675,2,Fri Jul 17 17:08:17 2015 UTC,"In my experience it really is a hip flexibility issue. When my hips are flexible, it's a fairly natural thing to get into, and when they're not(after an injury or time off) I don't even consider trying it. Because not only do your hips need to open to do this, they need to be raising and lowering while opened up to make the mini strides that you see the guy doing in the video to get through this type of turn. I'm a big proponent of yoga to help with hockey performance, so jump on the Mark Messier bandwagon and Google 'hip opening yoga' or 'yoga for hockey' and see if you can find some poses that will help you out."
hockeyplayers,3dn6jn,evanstravers,2,Fri Jul 17 18:35:13 2015 UTC,"What really helped me was a lot of forcing myself to work on each edge. This meant a ton of one foot glides using the inside and outside edges. Like this (but you don't need the cones):  https://youtu.be/HV5v8-Na8vI?t=16  Most of us can do that skating forwards. The tricky one is to work on backwards one foot glides. But it really, really helps because it forces you to develop the ability to control your weight on a single edge. Backwards one foot glides on the outside edge are the most awkward thing you can do but don't skip those either, they're just as important.  Basically the reason mohawks are tough is because you currently lack the confidence to flip a skate 180 degrees and put your weight on it. Develop trust in your edges and you'll find this slowly getting easier.  Hip mobility can be a factor but usually not why beginner skaters have trouble on transitions. It's all about confidence."

The RBZ's were REALLY roomy, maybe the roomiest of any skate on the market. The Jetspeeds have a more contoured fit in the ankle, similar to the Bauer Vapor line I think. Here's a pic of the 2 interiors side by side: https://i.imgur.com/3dI6l0k.jpg  In the end, fit matters more than quality, so just make sure whatever model you get is the one that fits your foot the best."

hockeyplayers,3dncit,Ebspatch,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:52:12 2015 UTC,Seems to me like you should go for the warranty repair.   See if you on find some cheap replacements or try and borrow someone's pants in the meantime.
hockeyplayers,3dncit,evanstravers,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:22:40 2015 UTC,"If avoid trying to replace and restitch yourself, it'll probably fall apart if you don't have experience and the right materials.

hockeyplayers,3dncit,funkyb,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:45:52 2015 UTC,"Id probably take out the belt entirely and replace it with skate lace or something. The warranty return doesn't seem worth it for pants that cheap, especially when you should be able to MacGyver something that'll work just as well as the stock buckle. Although, there is the chance that easton would send you newer pants back.... It's kinda always a gamble with this kinda stuff, and I have lost before with easton, but that's life."

The length is perfect and they protect well enough but the belt system is horribly designed and will usually result in the piece of padding that protects your lower stomach sticking out horizontally and not sitting flat against body. Looks like you're skating around with a hard on. I had to do some serious rigging to fix the problem.

hockeyplayers,3dmm8v,CPerryG,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:06:37 2015 UTC,"I like the Chara curve on Warrior sticks. Short blade, mostly closed toe. Looking for something longer than the average warrior stick with a lie of 6 if possible. Something I can keep on the ice even if I am standing up more straight and flex 85-90."
hockeyplayers,3dmm8v,Subject2Change,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:13:18 2015 UTC,"Wow, you know what you want.  I just see a blade curve and if it is close I just go for it lol.  I did some research and I don't know if this helps at all but the Chara curve looks a lot like the Toews curve in Bauer (P14).  Maybe you can find some of these stick in 66""?    Side note:  Don't you think a Chara stick would automatically come in like 80 inches?  Second side note:  Ever thought about just putting a 6"" wood extension on the end of the sticks you like?"
hockeyplayers,3dmm8v,CPerryG,2,Fri Jul 17 17:49:35 2015 UTC,"Chara is just a blade pattern, however I've heard about his actual sticks being huge and super stiff, like 130 flex or something insane.   I've put a plug in sticks before, 6"" is too much; warrior sticks are usually 63"" so i'd want maybe 2 inches at most. However adding length makes the flex rating lower and screws up the kickpoint if you add too much length. Plus length doesn't change the lie of the stick, length is great but adding too much length gives you no control. I just need to find the perfect stick with a 6.0 lie, similar to chara pattern and be long enough for me....I'm so picky haha."
hockeyplayers,3dmm8v,Subject2Change,2,Fri Jul 17 18:12:29 2015 UTC,"Ya, you're right... 6"" at top would throw everything off.  And damn you are picky!  Not a bad thing though.  Maybe just bend your knees more :)"

I was using a different pattern previously and kept having issues with the puck rolling off the end of my stick and shots/passes being utter trash.  So I've sort of learned what I like now and just want to find the ideal stick lol."
hockeyplayers,3dmm8v,Subject2Change,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:29:21 2015 UTC,"I know a few CCM models come in 63"", but that's all I know. You could opt for a higher flex and put an extension in the stick."

It's always one or two guys barely keeping the thing together mixed with a handful of dudes who take it too seriously and then a sea of half interested sometimes-shows.  With ice leagues, it's generally the shit I mentioned.  A handful of try hards, but usually slightly better organization and attendance.  But only slightly.  Fuckin years of puck and the same god damn problems I have no earthly clue why.  It's bad enough that I have half a mind to buy my own god damn rink one day after loans are all paid off and just run the shit.

Realistically I'd not be in it either but I got roped into it a few years ago.  Upper and lower C are much better balanced.  B is pretty damn intense.  Kettler isn't bad, their organization is pretty good, the schedule is always released in full, rosters are relatively enforced, and refs are ok and USAHockey so it's better than some leagues. I moved to there from other rinks because their scheduling is consistent.  You play the same night of the week every night, just with rotating time slots.  It's much easier to plan around that shit.  Plus, the rink isn't falling apart, which is somewhat rare in VA.  They also do drop in pickups.

I do have what seems to be much more hockey experience than you (judging by your flair) but the trick to things like this is working your ass off and doing everything possible to succeed. I would suggest an exercise program if you aren't already on one and trying to find ice to play on whenever possible. Good luck on making the team."
hockeyplayers,3dkq9z,furfule,2,Fri Jul 17 02:48:33 2015 UTC,"The key is to control what you can control, and not sweat what you can't.  Make sure you get enough sleep and eat right leading up to the try-out.  Sure you're beyond serious about making the team, but if your friends want you to go to a can't-miss party a couple days before the try-out, will you go, or will you pass because of the try-out?    Make sure you and your gear are ready to go, so you can walk into the try-out like you've been there before, not trying to cut down a new stick and tape it at the last minute, or asking around for a stone because your skates are dull.    Once you get out there, there's no way to control your talent level, it will be what it will be, but you can control your effort level and your 'moxie'.  Even if you aren't the fastest, work the hardest - the coaches will notice and will project in their minds about how great of a player you can become under their tutelage.  Trust me, a coach would much rather invest time into teaching someone who works hard, than trying to babysit somebody more naturally gifted who has an attitude problem.    As for the moxie: when somebody tries to push you off the puck, push them back!  Use your hips and your butt to box them out, especially along the boards.  When you're forechecking or back checking, work your buns off to win every battle.  It's not a substitute for raw talent level, but it will absolutely make you stand out to the coaches compared to somebody of the same talent level who doesn't try as hard.    Lastly, don't let the mistakes or let downs get you down.  You won't win every battle, you won't win every race, heck you may lose the majority depending on where you fall in the pool of players, but you will get their and the coaches' respect if you don't give up and keep going hard each shift.  Try-outs absolutely are intimidating, but everyone else who's trying-out is in the same boat as you.  Be the one who doesn't fade under the pressure, and you will succeed!  Good luck!"
hockeyplayers,3dkq9z,deadlyernest,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:51:00 2015 UTC,"This is outstanding advice. Listen to this guy!  The only thing id add, is start eating healthier, working out, and making sure youre getting yourself on a good sleep schedule all summer long. Dont just wait for the day before the tryouts. Start training your body and mind NOW.   If you want this, its yours for the taking, but you have to put the work in.   There are several great hockey workout programs. Some are free. Some cost money. The ones that cost money go into greater detail, hook you up with a real life trainer who you can talk with and tweak your regimen, and focus a lot on nutrition (which is highly over looked and extremely important)!"

hockeyplayers,3dkq9z,mootland,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:46:36 2015 UTC,Hey I started in January and I tried out for my local JV team on Tuesday. Ya I was really nervous because I can't stop with my left side. But everyone there was trying to play the game they love and get better at it. Just go out there and play your game. At my practice I knew I was the slowest person there but I gave it my all and tried hard and the coach noticed it and told me to come back next week. Good luck and relax. Play your game!
hockeyplayers,3dkq9z,orionthefisherman,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:51:50 2015 UTC,"Sounds to me that you're putting too much pressure on yourself about  this. I can understand the tryouts are important and that alone puts pressure on you, but I think these things should be taken day by day, get your mind off the tryouts and back into the practice. You have quite some time left before the tryouts so you can focus your practice on the things you or your coach feel that needs the most to be worked on."
hockeyplayers,3dkq9z,acholon,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:21:19 2015 UTC,"As someone who went through a similar situation  (in a different sport, football, went from n Not knowing how to put gear on as a hs freshman to playing 4 years in college) at the same age (seems so long ago now!) I can tell you the answer is WORK. Every day you should do something to get better. Literally every single day. It doesn't always have to be in the gym or on the ice, because you do need time to recover from hard training. Get a street hockey puck and stick and shoot in the drivewayway. Take 100 shots on your non ice days. Watch anything you can find on YouTube about hockey. Training, strategy, highlights, everything (something I wish I had when I was working to become a good football player). Take half an hour and do a complete stretch routine.  The biggest thing is, since you have what sounds like the perfect goal: difficult but not impossible, if you work hard enough when the time comes for tryouts you will have put in so much effort you cannot allow yourself to fail."
hockeyplayers,3dkq9z,Jwhits22,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:50:35 2015 UTC,"Since you have got a lot of good overall advice I will give you a couple smaller things to keep in mind that could just be the little things that evaluaters will notice. They are some of the smaller things that I note when evaluating that do make a difference especially when choosing some of the last players. If it's close between a player who may have more natural talent and a player who is working their butt off to get better and has room to grow these things can make the choice for me:  Pay attention: When I am evaluating I notice a lot of players not paying attention when the coaches/on-ice are explaining the drill that we will be evaluating. Then when the drill starts they do something wrong, show that you are coachable and serious about being there pay attention.  Don't give up: You fall down during a drill or you get beat during a drill, don't give up hustle all the way back, this effort doesn't go unnoticed and can give you a leg up over a more ""talented"" player to show you have effort.  Battle hard: Most tryouts will have a lot of 1on1 battle drills to show your play against others and not just skills, no matter how big the player you are going against or small give it everything and show you can play with them.  Talk to the coaches: show your interest, ask questions, be involved, ask for tips before or after. This could be another small thing they notice that could gain you bonus points.  Attitude: keep a good attitude and have fun, it's hockey"

hockeyplayers,3diygl,OzziePao13,3,Thu Jul 16 18:18:26 2015 UTC,Not too bad! If you buy the Jetspeed Skates you get a free CCM hat or at least at my Pure Hockey.  P.S. Gotta use those sticks!
hockeyplayers,3diygl,kingofthediamond,3,Thu Jul 16 19:21:47 2015 UTC,"Our whole team actually got the CCM hats last night at our game. One of my teammates is the manager at one of the stores here in MA.  According to him, the hats are free to anyone who tries on the skates, and posts a photo and hashtag to instagram, twitter, or something.  You don't have to buy them. Although the Jetspeeds are on my short list of skates to try out.  As for the sticks, I have a distibutor hookup, so I'm constantly getting sticks, and/or saving them, using them, or giving them to teammates. I'm very picky, so I don't actually vary too much in preferences nowadays."

hockeyplayers,3diygl,OzziePao13,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:42:02 2015 UTC,It'll be worth $130 in a few months when the next top of the line stick is released. You can look at last year/season's $260 stick for around the same price if you can find the right curve.

hockeyplayers,3djm78,WhiskyTango3,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:14:26 2015 UTC,7.0D. One of the most common sizes I believe. I know most stores local to where I am have them priced around $300. I'd be happy with $150-$200.
hockeyplayers,3djm78,WhiskyTango3,2,Fri Jul 17 03:35:56 2015 UTC,"I think your price is where your going wrong. What people usually do these days is go to the store, try them on, then order them online.   You can get those same skates, new for $200."

hockeyplayers,3dj87z,ostie,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:18:49 2015 UTC,"11:30 is the last game. Last season it felt like we got that slot more often than not.   You know, ive thought about this a lot lately. If you look at other recreational sports like softball/baseball, soccer, volleyball... Peoples family and friends often come out to watch. The tailgates are fun, and the bbq's after. Hell, i remember going to my dads softball games when i was a kid. They were full on events! There was usually a guy who was a friend of the team who catered the party in the parking lot! It was awesome!  But when it comes to hockey, at least in the places ive played... The experience is shared by the players, and them alone.   Now, while i 100% appreciate the love that is had in the locker room, it is something different to have that shared on a bigger level with friends and family.   One thing that k think hinders this, is the fact that beer league games start late, and end into the wee hours of the next day! I get home at 1:45/2:00 in the morning on those late game nights. Its crazy!  I understand a baseball/softball field is a lot easier/cheaper and less land occupying than an ice rink. But still, theres got to be a better way. Maybe we dont need 3 hour blocks of figure skating? I mean really, is that even a thing still?  Sorry for the rant. I drank too much at lunch today."

hockeyplayers,3dj87z,douggoblue,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:48:48 2015 UTC,It's one thing to have a game at 10pm and be 15 min away from the rink... but I do feel for the guys that have to travel to get to far away rinks. That's the only thing that sucks- be home at 11:30 isn't that big of a deal- but adding that extra hour or longer to get to/from a rink is tough.
hockeyplayers,3dkf5c,Captain_Murica91,5,Fri Jul 17 00:00:15 2015 UTC,Those should be fine to get you started.  Don't spend too much on your first set of equipment.  It took me a bit of playing to figure out my preferences so I've replaced nearly everything I originally bought except for my helmet and shoulder pads.

hockeyplayers,3dkf5c,DicNavis,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:54:19 2015 UTC,When I lived outside St Louis there was tons. I moved to Springfield MO a month ago (I want to play hockey to get in shape and make new friends) And they have a huge Play it Again here with literally ZERO hockey merch. My only local options are Johnny Macs or the Rinks pro shop and the rinks pro shop selection is VERY limited!
hockeyplayers,3dkf5c,DicNavis,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:25:18 2015 UTC,"That's a shame.  You'll probably be okay buying near the base level of gear.  If you try to buy secondhand online, you have to spend quite a bit of money and high quality gear or you won't save any money with shipping costs compared to buying locally.  I spent freely on my helmet because as long as it's comfortable and not made of concrete, you won't be bothered by it, and I don't find it wise to sacrifice anything when it comes to protecting my dome.  DO NOT BUY TOP OF THE LINE STICKS AS A BEGINNER!  You could go through a number of different blade patterns before you find one you like best and then flexes, lies, lengths, and kick points come into play.  Learn to play with a heavier stick and switching to a light one will finally be worth the money.  Best of luck starting out! I'm so glad I did and it has been a blast and I've made tons of friends who share my biggest interest.  Be patient with learning and remember that hockey is hard!  Don't get discouraged with the things you can't do. Set realistic goals and don't stop working on your game."
hockeyplayers,3dkf5c,shining_,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:41:36 2015 UTC,Only real problem I've run into is that I'm a REALLY big guy so find stuff that fits in my price range is really hard I've tried on helmets already and while I'm not going to buy a really expensive one I'm also not buying the intro line model either.

hockeyplayers,3dipnf,kingofthediamond,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:57:39 2015 UTC,For a beer league this might be ok but if you're playing in a more competitive league the protection is necessary because the piece of fabric protects from side-to-side movement too.
hockeyplayers,3dipnf,bene37,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:19:33 2015 UTC,"Well, yes. It sacrifices safety for mobility. That should be an understood trade-off before you modify your gloves like this. That said, this is a modification professionals are making, doesn't get much more competitive than that."
hockeyplayers,3dipnf,JonnyBox,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:09:19 2015 UTC,"Bauer gloves have the best thumb movement in my opinion so I'd stick with them.  Anything that says ""Free Flex"" on the thumb will be good, which is about mid tier and up.  Then as for which line, try them all on and see what you prefer.  Supreme will be the tightest, Nexus is loosest, and Vapor is kind of in between with slimmer fingers but a flared out palm and cuff."

hockeyplayers,3dhdzq,el_karacho,2,Thu Jul 16 19:34:50 2015 UTC,"Ditto the other responses.  Your first line of defense against odor is letting your gear air dry after you've used it.  You can make this process as cheap or as expensive as you want.  Some people just lay their gear out and that's that, others use a clothes line system, some build drying racks, some buy drying racks, some use fans, some use actual super fancy hockey equipment dryers, etc.    Another thing to add to his list is to wash your gear every now and then.  I was mine about two times a year I guess.  I just use warm water in the bath tub (you could also use a large clean trashcan) and like a cup or two of Tide.  Agitate the water and gear every now and then to let the Tide get into all areas, and then let the gear soak for a few hours, possibly even overnight.

hockeyplayers,3dgp5d,nocsyn,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:18:39 2015 UTC,It could be that your stick is too stiff regardless of your weight. The Dynasty is also a mid kick stick. So you have to lean into your shots to get speed.
hockeyplayers,3dgp5d,kingofthediamond,1 point,Thu Jul 16 11:38:27 2015 UTC,Yea I'm wondering if I need a low kick stick. I'm new to the full composite world. Used a two piece and before that all wood. I know ccm rbz or vapor have dual kick points.  Has anyone had any good experience with the dual kick points?
hockeyplayers,3dgp5d,kingofthediamond,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:49:16 2015 UTC,welcome to the composite world! Personally I love the RBZ and did not like the vapor. Had the original APX and it stiffened up quicker than I would have liked. That's just my experience but many people like both sticks. I would be careful with an RBZ because the blades have a lot of pop to them. Great for shooting but can make stick handling and catching passes difficult. You may like the added consistency in your shots from the variable kick points  I would check out variable and low kick sticks
hockeyplayers,3dgp5d,TeamMATH,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:57:43 2015 UTC,"In the original post you said:   my wrist shot is so weak with this stick. I'm not sure if the stick flexs too much or not enough.   A low-flex stick will bend at, or below, your lowest hand. In my experience, having a stick with a kickpoint between your hands helps me ""feel"" the stick flex.   Low-kick sticks aren't for me. Yes, they can produce great shots, but I can't feel the stick working and helping me when I load it up even though, intellectually, I know it does. Low-kick sticks surprise me while mid-kick sticks don't. It's hard to explain but this diagram helped me.  It says the following under the ""Very Low Kickpoint"" header:   Sticks with very low kickpoints aim to allow the quickest shot release, but this comes at an expense of feel and shot power.   tl;dr: stick with a mid-kick stick if you want to ""feel"" your stick flex."
hockeyplayers,3dgp5d,kingofthediamond,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:50:43 2015 UTC,"So after reading everyone's responses and doing some of my own research what I think is happening is when I cut the stick (prolly 1.5 inch) the mid kick point is higher thus my lower hand wants to be higher. This combined with a flatter curve definitely doesn't help my wrist shot. I'm adaptable with my slap shot and I can feel the stick ""doing work"" when I have the lower hand up higher.   I can be totally wrong but...yeaaaa"
hockeyplayers,3dgp5d,kingofthediamond,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:23:13 2015 UTC,It is a mid kick so when you use the stick to its potential it will feel the best. A slap shot where you use the most out of you stick will feel the best.
hockeyplayers,3dgp5d,cappymats,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:50:18 2015 UTC,"That's true but only if you lean into shots. For players who use their arms wont ""feel"" what you mean. I completely agree with you though. You definitely feel the stick flex with the mid kick if you do it right.   And youre right, you may lose power on a quick wrist shot with a low kick."
hockeyplayers,3dgp5d,cappymats,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:49:21 2015 UTC,"Being of a similar size and using a similar stick, I can tell you that it isn't so much about the stick. I use a DTpro Burrows 100 flex, but my previous one was a Widow Burrows 85 flex. I moved up because I had a teammate tell me as a general rule the flex should be half of your weight. That said, the flex, curve, lie, and even the brand of stick pretty much comes down to personal preference. The bottom line on a wrist shot is a ton of practice. There's a few components that go into it and practicing even on pavement (street hockey) helps."
hockeyplayers,3dgp5d,kingofthediamond,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:44:55 2015 UTC,I never had a problem with my wrist shot until I switched to a full composite stick which makes me think it has to do with the kick point. I just can't wrap my head around it and might switch back to the two piece.
hockeyplayers,3dgp5d,TeamMATH,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:10:18 2015 UTC,"That's always an option. If you're more comfortable with a two piece, then I wouldn't hesitate to try it again at an open ice or something. The guy who owns my local shop says ""it's not the tools, it's the carpenter."" While the numbers on the stick do mean different things, it all boils down to having something you can use effectively. What position you are, likelihood to shoot or pass will play into this decision as well."
hockeyplayers,3dgp5d,RichieCski,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:44:22 2015 UTC,Yea I totally agree. It's obviously operator error. But the kick point on the stick is higher up (mid I believe) I don't shoot that way and it feels unnatural. I notice the difference obviously where I put my lower hand (which is the point). I think I need a lower kick point or a dual.
hockeyplayers,3dgp5d,kingofthediamond,2,Thu Jul 16 14:16:36 2015 UTC,"""A carpenter with power tools can be more precise and faster than without"""
hockeyplayers,3dgp5d,TeamMATH,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:06:13 2015 UTC,"I'm the same size as you and my opinion is that you should get a stick that'll help you with the things you're struggling in at the cost of making the other aspects that you find easier a little harder to do.  For example, I'd recommend a 100 flex CCM Stage 2 or Superfast with a giant banana curve like the Landeskog/H46.  The CCM is the fastest shooting stick I've ever owned; everything about it is designed from the ground up to produce the best shots possible. The big curve will help with the wrist-shots, the flex is whippy enough that you'll have no problem loading the shaft for slap-shots. Your stick handling will get a tiny bit worse but you may not notice it at all.  There's two guys on my hockey team that use the CCM but in different fashions. One guy cuts it way down, to his collarbone, and he has the best hands on the team. The other guy has an extension in it and his shots are monstrous. I often don't see the puck fly into the net because he just has so much power!  tl:dr; let the stick do some of the work"
hockeyplayers,3dgp5d,kingofthediamond,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:27:26 2015 UTC,I've always been nervous about using the banana curves bc of my stick handling but I'm sure with some practice why not. Im looking at P Kane's curve as a happy medium.
hockeyplayers,3dgp5d,TeamMATH,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:43:53 2015 UTC,"I use the Kane curve for a supreme 160 @ an 87 flex and I feel like it's a happy medium for everything. Nothing crazy banana type stuff, just a good all around mid-kick stick  I'm 6' 5"" 220 but still beginner/intermediate so I haven't decided if I want to jump up to something stiffer"
hockeyplayers,3dgp5d,kingofthediamond,0,Thu Jul 16 19:51:12 2015 UTC,The kane curve is really nice. Definitely dont get a 100 flex though
hockeyplayers,3dgp5d,kingofthediamond,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:59:52 2015 UTC,"The Kane curve has a closed face and won't help the OP with his wrist shot the way an H46 or a P46 can. Plus, he's 220 pounds, if he can't lean into and bend a 100 flex nobody can."
hockeyplayers,3dgp5d,kingofthediamond,2,Thu Jul 16 18:40:29 2015 UTC,sigh. I hate having this argument. Just because you weigh a certain amount does not mean that you must use a certain flex. It is a guideline not a rule. Maybe OP is very weak (no offense OP) and cant flex the 85. Not every player leans into shots. Nothing wrong with that at all.   And the Kane curve is the second most popular curve for a reason. You get incredible accuracy and easy stick handling. Its actually designed for wrist shots. The P46 is a big toe curve that may be very hard to handle especially when OP is coming from a heel curve.
hockeyplayers,3dgp5d,deadlyernest,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:19:50 2015 UTC,"I don't disagree with any of your points. As an example, I'm the same size and weight as OP and one of my favorite sticks is 77 flex. Then again, my all-time favorite stick is 120-flex, super long, with a toe-kink.  OP describes his wrist-shot as ""so weak"". I'm trying to say that a longer stick, with a deeper curve, and a stiffer flex profile might be exactly what he needs. In my opinion.  Then again, OP might find that a short stick with a whippy flex and a more neutral curve is the best option for him. I'm just trying to give him options he may not have thought of."
hockeyplayers,3dgp5d,kingofthediamond,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:39:03 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I use a stick that is technically too stiff for me. I really lean into my shots especially my slapper which is why I use it.   But in all seriousness if your stick is too whippy you'd know it. You would get way to much flex. Its easier to tell than if your stick is too stiff. Making it slightly easier to flex may help while OP learns proper technique.   You're right about the Kane curve though, it was based off the coffey which is a super deep curve. It makes for a very fast accurate shot if you know how to use it. I use a curve that is in between a Kane and a Sakic. or a slightly open, flatter kane curve. I get what you're saying though. The Burrows is a nice gentle curve."
hockeyplayers,3dgp5d,teethblock,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:43:40 2015 UTC,My two piece always had a Coffey. I loved it and the only reason I switched to the burrows was I saw a deal online. I think the burrows is too subtle and I need more of a toe curve but not obnoxious.
hockeyplayers,3dgp5d,kingofthediamond,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:47:03 2015 UTC,Why didnt you say that lol The coffey is a sick curve!
hockeyplayers,3dgp5d,teethblock,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:51:30 2015 UTC,Right!  So the Kane is the Coffey now. Amazing.
hockeyplayers,3dgp5d,kingofthediamond,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:58:02 2015 UTC,"HEY BRO I LIFT.   When I say weak I base it off of these young college shits with their ridiculous shots.  My slap shot is up there but my wrist shot took a decline once I started using composite. This is when I started learning about the technology and letting the stick do the ""work"" for you."
hockeyplayers,3dgp5d,teethblock,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:44:21 2015 UTC,"Exactly, So we want you to get the perfect stick so all your shots are on point"
hockeyplayers,3dgp5d,kingofthediamond,2,Thu Jul 16 20:47:00 2015 UTC,Haha you guys are awesome and definitely helping.
hockeyplayers,3dgp5d,teethblock,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:48:07 2015 UTC,"This actually sounds like it may be because of a lie change, not a flex change.  I'm guessing that your new stick has a steeper lie than your old one (which would help your stick handling) so you're tending not to get bent over the stick enough to make use the flex of your stick in your wrist shot.  No flex change should really create the issue you're describing, unless one goes to a stick so stiff that you can't flex it properly, but at 220, you shouldn't have a problem.  That said though, if you've always used cheaper sticks, this might be the stiffest stick you've experienced, even though the rated flex is lower than others you've used.  I guess I'm not much help, but that's a tough one to diagnose without seeing you shoot. - Post a video maybe?"
hockeyplayers,3dgp5d,kingofthediamond,1 point,Fri Jul 17 07:06:06 2015 UTC,"Yea I was actually thinking about testing three sticks (Tavares ccm, burrows warrior or a winwell ps119) and film it. When I get the results I'll post it here."

That being said, it's not a major inconvenience and you can still learn the most important basics of skating from roller hockey."

hockeyplayers,3dere0,LvingLone,3,Wed Jul 15 18:57:29 2015 UTC,"Your best bet is to get out there during open hockey or something like that and see where you like playing. Don't decide on a position before you get on the ice.   As far as a stick, look for something close to the $100 range. You don't need anything crazy, but the $40-50 sticks are usually pretty crappy. A rule of thumb is Flex=BodyWeight/2, so a 95-105 flex would probably be good for you. Go to the store, play around with a few and pick one that feels good to you."
hockeyplayers,3dere0,maradonuts,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:00:35 2015 UTC,105 or even 95 is most likely too much for a new player if he's not very strong. I would recommend going to a local hockey store (if you can) and trying out a SR 75-80 flex stick. A stick with too low flex rating is usually better than a stick that is too stiff. And it will be easier to practice shooting with a lower flex stick.
hockeyplayers,3dere0,bene37,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:01:00 2015 UTC,I always kind laugh at the rule of thumb about flex. I'm a 155lb player using a 105.

hockeyplayers,3dere0,Nicholasagn,3,Thu Jul 16 12:07:54 2015 UTC,"Beginners should start on wing. Positioning is WAY easier for every play on the ice. You pretty much can stay in one lane between your blue line and their goal line.  Centre is the play maker and is the most likely player to be covering for another position so must know them all. Defence is the hardest to learn due to knowing when to stay or go, gap control etc.   (And you must be crazy to be goalie).  A lot of people like to play the off-wing (left handed play on right side and vice-versa). IMHO this is more difficult for a beginner.   On the off wing you generally have to pick up passes on the back-hand and trying to go forwards off the boards you are on the backhand. If you are angled to the outside, a pass must also be made on the backhand.   The advantage is that if you turn to the centre inside the opponents blue line you have a better shot at the net. Beginners rarely make this work however."
hockeyplayers,3dere0,somewhat_random,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:09:52 2015 UTC,"I tried the off wing on my last scrim, much harder than it looks to take passes on the back hand, but when i did, it felt great plus positioning felt so much better"
hockeyplayers,3dere0,Nicholasagn,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:10:25 2015 UTC,"I just got moved to wing from forward on my team (first time playing organized hockey).  I consider myself a pretty strong positional player for a beginner and I understand my defensive zone responsibilities pretty well but I'm a little unclear about the neutral zone and the offensive zone.    If I gain possession on the breakout I'm not necessarily expected to stay on my side, am I?  If I have a lane to the offensive zone that requires me to move through center and even to the other side is there anything wrong with that?  Conversely, when doing zone entries I've always seen it played as the order that you go into the zone, not the position (first man with the puck drives wide, second man goes hard to the net, third man finds a wider passing lane or assists down low).  So last night I played that way and then hustled back into my position when we were on defense... is that how you do it or should I be more cognizant of ""I am right wing therefore I must be on the right side of the ice"" at all times?"
hockeyplayers,3dere0,themaincop,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:15:16 2015 UTC,"The simplest way would be stay in your lane. The 1-2-3 entry is more complicated but takes advantage of a quick transition.   Rec league generally involves a bit of chaos in positioning (especially on offence) due to varying skill levels. If you have an open lane, I would definitely take it.   Also remember your voice (totally underused in rec hockey). In a quick transition or whatever, if you end up on the opposite side, yell to your team-mate (e.g. ""I got right side point"", Ok to switch back now etc). As long as you know who is where it all works out.  Most important imho is on the back check, the first guy back must cover the middle (centre position)."
hockeyplayers,3dere0,somewhat_random,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:10:17 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I didn't know about the first guy back thing.  My team is a lot of new players and we're really quiet out there.  I think I'm going to start talking more and hopefully others pick up on it."
hockeyplayers,3dere0,themaincop,2,Sat Jul 18 03:49:14 2015 UTC,"I think when you start out, you'll end up playing a little of everything. You'll find out what you like. Wing is the easiest to fall into.  As for sticks, if you have little to no experience with them, try to find a store locally that has a shooting room with fake ice and will let you try out some different sticks. Different curves, lies and flexes will feel and shoot differently. It's not much about what position you play but more what feels good to you."
hockeyplayers,3dere0,ShoePolice,3,Wed Jul 15 19:01:06 2015 UTC,"I find it funny that everyone says wing is the easiest to learn, but I was shoved in defense my first ever game and now when they try me at wing I just get confused."
hockeyplayers,3dere0,kiwirish,0,Wed Jul 15 19:56:55 2015 UTC,Same here. I'm mainly D or Center. When I get put on a wing I feel like I've never played hockey before. I can't seem to get the hang of it.
hockeyplayers,3dere0,kr580,2,Thu Jul 16 08:43:42 2015 UTC,"My first question is can you skate? If not then you will definitely want to get out to public skate and get as much ice time as you can stand. I'd also recommend lessons but there is a ton of great skating resources on the side bar.  After that it's really just about getting your gear and getting out there. Once you're ready to jump on the ice (and have gear) I recommend going to a few stick times to get used to moving in full kit. After that you could look for a ""Learn to Play"" league in your area as these usually cover the basics while learning positions and such.  As for which position well I'd say try everything you can and see what you like. I've messed around a bit and I'd say forward is easiest to start although I somehow always end up playing defense. If Defense is something that in any way interests you then make sure you spend a good amount of time learning to skate backwards.  That is all I have right now. There are way more experienced players that can probably give you better advice."
hockeyplayers,3dere0,EinsamWulf,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:55:16 2015 UTC,"Position wise most brand new adult players are forwards, because if your backwards skating isn't great, being a d-man isn't going to work out too well. Some guys will eventually build enough skill to play D. Really in a lot of Rec leagues the forwards sort of play a hybrid style, mingling spots on the fly. Just depends on the level and your team. As for you, with your size they are probably going to want in front of the net, if you can skate well enough to cover both ends of the ice."

I am 27 yrs old, 6' 1"" 185 lbs (I weighed 230- 4 months ago) I started playing hockey a week ago, I signed up for lessons at my local rink. If your local rink offers something like this, i'd check it out. The coaches in my class have the attitude of buying a cheap stick for your first one, then, once you decide your preffered position and that you actually want to keep playing, you make that stick your street hockey stick and buy a nicer one that fits your needs.  I bought a $25 CCM wood stick and it has been fine for me thus far."
hockeyplayers,3dere0,chuckabrick,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:57:31 2015 UTC,"start on the wing, it has the least responsibility and also you get to play offense which is arguably the most fun. you won't really know what type of player you are until you play on a team (grinder, playmaker, power forward, sniper etc).   for a stick you should get a flex of around 80-100. i recommend getting a simpler blade type thats flatter so you can get passes okay, yet has some curve so you don't have problems lifting the puck. if you go bauer i would recommend looking at the stamkos and the backstrom."

hockeyplayers,3dek69,Khue,11,Wed Jul 15 17:35:43 2015 UTC,"Welcome (back) to inline hockey!   Yes, 72A wheels are for indoor rinks and are easily chewed up playing outside. 82 or 84a should do you just fine. For reference, I have Rink Rat Hot Shot wheels on my outdoor skates.   Shin guards are the same product for ice and roller, as are gloves. There are large variations in shin guard protection however, ranging from lighter front-only pads to shin pads that wrap around the full calf. You'll have to decide what you're looking for, but for the most part cheaper, lighter, and less protective ones are the way to go for roller. If you find yourself blocking lots of shots in a league later on, or playing on ice as well, then maybe you'd want to switch to fuller shin pads.   For durability, I recommend a stick with an ABS blade for outdoor play. You should be able to find a wood stick with an ABS blade made by various brands for 30-ish bucks. If you want a lighter, more pro-style stick experience, you could buy a composite shaft and put in an ABS blade. ABS blades aren't the most ideal for indoor online or ice play, mostly because they're heavy, which is why you don't see them used often. When you eventually find yourself playing indoors, I'd just buy a nicer stick for indoor use only."
hockeyplayers,3dek69,evanstravers,2,Wed Jul 15 18:02:24 2015 UTC,"Everything he ^ just said is spot on.    The only thing I would add, is when I was playing on rinks with smooth concrete surfaces, I played with a 1-piece composite stick, but I put a thin strip of gorilla tape along the bottom of the blade.  This protected it pretty well.  I had to replace the strip every game... but it was great for allowing me to use a great stick, and not worry about destroying it after 1 or 2 games."

I'd add that you might be best off using cheaper Mylec or street hockey specific shin guards, the knees will be made of more durable plastic than an ice hockey shin guard.    Also, ditch the tennis ball and get an actual no bounce street hockey ball... the difference is huge and you'll have much more fun."

hockeyplayers,3dek69,SchwankaDank,2,Wed Jul 15 18:35:26 2015 UTC,"It depends on the surface... if you are on a super smooth, sealed concrete surface, a puck can work.   Many outdoor hockey rinks are okay for pucks.   Most concrete parking lots and most tennis courts aren't smooth enough.   Asphalt... no way, use a ball."

hockeyplayers,3ddv1r,modtrax,10,Wed Jul 15 14:31:11 2015 UTC,"The issue is not with how sharp or dull your skates are. The issue is your hollow. Hollow is basically the shape of your sharpening. 1/2"" is standard for skaters. If you feel your skates are too sharp, ask for a 9/16ths. If that is still too sharp, ask for a 5/8ths. If they're too sharp they will bite too much and you'll feel like you are digging a deep rut instead of gliding.  If you feel like they are not sharp enough, ask for a 7/16ths. If your skates are not sharp enough you will feel like you are sliding and not able to ""grab"" or ""bite"" on turns or stops.  Warm ice or cold ice shouldn't make a difference at any halfway decent rink. The ice should be consistent throughout the skate. Soft v. Hard ice is common. You'll want a shallower hollow for softer ice and a deeper hollow for especially hard ice."
hockeyplayers,3ddv1r,dsjunior1388,3,Wed Jul 15 14:47:29 2015 UTC,"I mean, colder ice will generally be harder, but yeah."
hockeyplayers,3ddv1r,stevegcook,3,Wed Jul 15 20:30:50 2015 UTC,"I understood ""warm or cold"" to refer to the timeframe after a zamboni had resurfaced. I may have read too much into it."
hockeyplayers,3ddv1r,dsjunior1388,3,Wed Jul 15 20:39:14 2015 UTC,"Ah.  I've always thought of it as simply the temperature of the ice overall.  It's one of the reasons I use a shallower hollow in the summer than in the winter, because the cooling system often doesn't completely make up for the higher ambient temperature."
hockeyplayers,3ddv1r,stevegcook,2,Wed Jul 15 20:45:03 2015 UTC,"Recently had this same problem. 95 degrees and high humidity in an old rink after getting my skates sharpened by my regular guys, it was a rough time. Never had trouble at that ice before but the ice was pretty wet and swampy.  The puck barely moved and everyone was having a bit of trouble skating."
hockeyplayers,3ddv1r,mnwildfan999,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:28:41 2015 UTC,With soft ice a wider hollow is generally preferred. However for me I prefer a 5/8 flat bottom v cut(a little wider than the average skater) no matter what ice I'm playing on. I don't like jumping around on cuts. I like to stick to the same one for consistency. Find the one you like and stick with it. You'll find out eventually that it doesn't matter what cut or how soft the ice is eventually.
hockeyplayers,3ddv1r,LoonWhisperer,2,Wed Jul 15 15:30:29 2015 UTC,What does a flat bottom V feel like in comparison to a normal hollow?
hockeyplayers,3ddv1r,TheGhostOfSagan,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:43:13 2015 UTC,"Well, it's a little different but i haven't skated on a normal cut for 7 years so i don't really remember how it ""feels"" per say, I just remember the transition to the FBV. It was really weird. I just remember feeling like I had no edges at first even though they were there. It took me a skate or two to really get the feeling down. I played AAA with regular hollow cut at 5/8 and switched to FBV in college and wish I had it back then. With the FBV you sit higher on the ice so you don't dig in as much. This allows you to glide/coast at a faster speed for a longer time with half the effort of a normal cut. I absolutely love it and don't ever plan on going back to a normal cut."
hockeyplayers,3ddv1r,LoonWhisperer,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:55:06 2015 UTC,"Intersting, I'm going to have to give that a shot. I'm skating a 9/16 regular hollow now, gonna try a 5/8 soon, then maybe that flat bottom V"
hockeyplayers,3ddv1r,TheGhostOfSagan,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:06:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, hollow size is mostly a personal preference. I prefer a wider cut because I hate the bite and the dig tight hollows give. I also prefer my skates to be a little more dull than most (a few of my teammates are the same way) so I only get mine sharpened 4 maybe 5 times a year while skating everyday, but I'm really confident with edges and weight transfer. It's all personal preference. I like my cut and don't think bouncing around on cuts to match the ice is necessary. That's just me though."
hockeyplayers,3ddv1r,LoonWhisperer,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:00:54 2015 UTC,Sharp skates on soft summer ice can really dig making quick stops entertaining. Probably not a bad sharpening but look at the hollow and make sure it's centered and there's no chatter. A good edge should shave a finger nail when you drag it perpendicular to the edge.
hockeyplayers,3ddv1r,booster1000,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:42:52 2015 UTC,I play in Arizona.  Hot as hell.  5/8 works best for me in ROH.  I use FBV 90/75 now though.  I glide and do not dig into the ice.  The edge control is very good too.

hockeyplayers,3ddv1r,CaliKingHockey,-1,Wed Jul 15 22:06:37 2015 UTC,Basically how skating works is that your blade melts a micro layer of ice. When the ice is warm there isn't much to grip on to
hockeyplayers,3ddv1r,kingofthediamond,2,Wed Jul 15 14:59:24 2015 UTC,"My understanding is that warm ice is softer, and because it is soft, edges dig in a lot easier (and too much) that you get too much grip, making it easier to turn and not blow out, but harder to shave the ice."
hockeyplayers,3ddv1r,shotgoto,2,Thu Jul 16 00:36:45 2015 UTC,"It makes it harder to turn because you dig in too much. The ability to 'float"" on the ice gives you cant turn as well"
hockeyplayers,3ddv1r,kingofthediamond,0,Thu Jul 16 00:44:30 2015 UTC,"There's no melting involved in skating. By that logic, if I stand on ice with shoes it's not slippery at all."

hockeyplayers,3dc12u,PhantomTongue,3,Wed Jul 15 02:28:51 2015 UTC,"That gear is pretty cheap.  I have never used it, but for the price I imagine that it isn't very protective.  You need to ask yourself how committed to playing hockey are you going to be?  Do you think this is going to be a hobby and you will lose interest after a couple of months, or are you going to push through those beginner months and play for the next 5 plus years.  If you plan on committing to playing hockey I suggest that you actually spend money on decent gear.  You don't need to buy the top of line equipment, but don't get cheap and buying the cheapest thing you can find.  Buy something that feels and fits you great, and that will last you for a long time.  I know that it isn't cheap to play hockey, but I am pretty sure that most people who decided to buy cheap equipment to get started, later spent more money to replace it with better quality equipment.  Also, don't buy a used helmet.  It is your head and it should be the best fitting piece of equipment and comfortable.    If you aren't sure how committed you are going to be you can get by with cheap equipment, but make sure it fits you correctly and is comfortable.  Entry level shin guards usually cost 30-40 dollars new.  Or you could look to buy used off of ebay or play it again sports."

hockeyplayers,3dc12u,ezeeetm,2,Wed Jul 15 04:00:33 2015 UTC,"Spend as much as you can afford on skates.  Buy your skates from a reputable local dealer, not online, so you can be fitted properly and pick from several pairs to get the best fit.  Get everything else you can from Craigslist/play it again sports, then fill in the gaps with clearance stuff from the store.  I recent got all my gear:  $150 skates $50 on CL: used helmet, shoulders, elbows, gloves, knees, pants, and stick. (I got lucky) $25 more from play it again:hockey socks, jersey  $20 from hockey store: mouth guard and thinees (inside socks)  I've since replaced my helmet and elbows for fit issues.  $70 total."

hockeyplayers,3dc12u,vitalemontea,1 point,Thu Jul 16 07:21:26 2015 UTC,"I agree with the previous users that your skates and your helmet should be the ones where you spend the most money. Uncomfortable skates is not going to be make the game very enjoyable: if guys are skating around you, at least your feet don't hurt. Helmet is a no brainer (pun fully intended). Its your head protect it.   I don't think an expensive stick is necessary yet. If you have a few extra dollars, buy some nicer gloves. Gloves stink up quite a bit so its one of the pieces of equipment I didn't buy used when I started.   For everything else, CL or a used sports equipment store. It might not be that protective but depending on the level you're playing at, you might be able to get away with it. I found $2 shin guards (literally $1/shin) and I used it for 2.5 years. Didn't even have a brand. Your biggest pain might be from falling so if it can cushion that, you're golden."

hockeyplayers,3d9zwa,Jag94,3,Wed Jul 15 17:28:50 2015 UTC,"I had tried several methods of carrying the sticks, but this one is by far the easiest and safest. A couple of times i had the sticks tied to the seat and hanging out behind me, but they stuck out like 2 feet. I was constantly worried that i was gonna hit someone with them. Plus, carrying multiple sticks was really difficult.   Im a drummer, so while looking around my studio for things to use to secure the sticks, a piece of gear caught my eye. A stick holder! Lol. The thing at the bottom is a drum stick holder, and it conveniently holds two sticks side by side. It also has a pretty sturdy clamp that i use to connect it to the frame of the bike. This is probably the most crucial piece of the set up, but i got pretty lucky that there is a piece of frame on the bike that allows it to connect to. Not all bikes have a frame like mine does. So it may be difficult for other bikes.   http://i82.photobucket.com/albums/j266/JAG94/Mobile%20Uploads/image_zpsksyow9aj.jpg  The next piece of the puzzle was making sure the sticks stood straight up, and didnt lean too much over the seat, or outwards towards traffic. I had a small cube of acoustic foam that i use in my recording studio. This was perfect for putting in between the seat and sticks. It keeps them perfectly straight up.   http://i82.photobucket.com/albums/j266/JAG94/Mobile%20Uploads/image_zps8kwjpac7.jpg  Then it just took 2 straps to hold it onto the seat/frame. The sticks stay put really well, but they do have a little give to them. This is important so that if i do hit something like a truck or suv with the sticks... A) the sticks wont brake, b) i likely wont damage the vehicle that gets hit, and c) it doesnt throw off my balance. So far, it has worked out really well. I also attach a bungee chord from the sticks to my bag. This is a fail safe in case the straps come loose for whatever reason. Its pretty loose, but its for emergencies only.   http://i82.photobucket.com/albums/j266/JAG94/Mobile%20Uploads/image_zpsuffgixcq.jpg  As for my bag, here it is with everything strapped to it.   http://i82.photobucket.com/albums/j266/JAG94/Mobile%20Uploads/image_zps6q18fs9b.jpg  http://i82.photobucket.com/albums/j266/JAG94/Mobile%20Uploads/image_zpsymdutjup.jpg  http://i82.photobucket.com/albums/j266/JAG94/Mobile%20Uploads/image_zpsqwryf1vx.jpg"

If you're looking at a new Z4 with the hardtop the sticks will fit, but you won't be getting a hockey bag in there. The trunk is super small because the roof takes up a ton of the trunk space."

Sticks aren't a problem since I can put my seats down and/or run them diagonally across the back seats.  As for one of the cars you're looking at, my parents have an NC Miata and I think you'd be hard pressed to get a hockey bag into that trunk. Even if you did, I don't know where your sticks would go unless you sat them in the passenger seat and drove to the game with the top down or the ends hanging out a window. It's a heck of a fun car to drive though! Maybe get a Miata and a beater Ford Ranger as a gear hauler."

hockeyplayers,3d9h6s,chenac,10,Tue Jul 14 15:27:23 2015 UTC,"You're about a million times lower than the pylons around you, but you can always get lower. I've said it here before: if your name isn't ""Jaromir Jagr"", you're not skating low enough. But, always focus on getting that bend from the knees, and keep your chest up. You look just a bit hunched over at times.  As /u/kr580 mentioned, you've definitely got the roller thing going on. You want to be pushing out and not back. It looks like you've got some Laura Stramm queued up, which is great, so pay attention to her bit about the ""toe flick"". Concentrate on pushin out to the sides, digging your inside edge into the ice, and finishing the stride by digging in the toe of your blade and ""flcking"" to get that last oomph of power.  Finally, try and focus on moving your arms forward and back. You look okay to start, but it seems like some side-to-side creeps in towards the end of the clip. That might just be the camera angle, though.  Overall, it looks pretty solid. If you work on the stuff above, it should help it all look a little less ""funny"". Bend your knees more, keep your chest and head up, push to the outside, finish with the ""toe flick"", and keep your arms from straying side-to-side.  Make sure to let us know if any of this helps!"

hockeyplayers,3d9h6s,0Psmom,3,Tue Jul 14 20:03:54 2015 UTC,I wanted to stress the second paragraph.  Your foot keeps slipping back instead of crunching the ice with your toe.  Op will jack up his top speed with that alone
hockeyplayers,3d9h6s,0Psmom,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:48:32 2015 UTC,"So basically focus on extending out to the side instead of back, making sure to keep my edge on the ice as long as possible?"
hockeyplayers,3d9h6s,kr580,2,Wed Jul 15 02:09:29 2015 UTC,"The goal isn't to keep you blade on the ice as long as possible, the goal is to push of the ice."
hockeyplayers,3d9h6s,glochnar,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:40:32 2015 UTC,"Wow, thanks for the detailed response! I'm definitely guilty of everything you've pointed out... I'm careless about swinging my arms, I've never really given much thought to what my toes do, and I think the shortened extension is from years of playing in a small roller rink without much instruction.    I watched some Laura Stamm videos on my lunch break, and pretty much all of the discrepancies between my form and the ideal stride had already been covered here. My detailed to-do list is now as follows:     Lower stance, like a squat Chest up, don't hunch over Deeper knee bend (90 degrees or less) Extend out to the side, not behind Point the toe to the side, not down Toe flick: dig the toe into the ice (inside edge) to propel Swing arms directly back, not to the side   I'm not sure when I'll have decent ice time next, but hopefully I'll be able to share a progress post down the road!"
hockeyplayers,3d9h6s,somethinggangster,2,Tue Jul 14 18:15:58 2015 UTC,I'd say that toe stuff is the most important.   Don't even worry about swinging your arms cause they should be busy with your stick
hockeyplayers,3d9h6s,hkycoach,3,Wed Jul 15 00:50:01 2015 UTC,"I'm the backchecker in the burgundy.      I've never had an issue with speed (I cover quite a bit of ground in this clip, for example), but I've always thought I looked funny while skating. Am I kicking my legs back too much and wasting power? Is it something else?    I've played roller, too, so that may have given me some bad habits."
hockeyplayers,3d9h6s,hkycoach,3,Tue Jul 14 15:31:09 2015 UTC,You definitely do the roller thing where you're kicking backwards rather than really digging in and using your edges to the side. Overall it looks really good. Maybe look up the Laura Stamm stride videos for some finer points on how to tighten up your stride.
hockeyplayers,3d9h6s,hkycoach,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:52:15 2015 UTC,"Hmm, so maybe make an effort to extend outward instead of back?    I've got this video queued up for my lunch break."
hockeyplayers,3d9h6s,kingofthediamond,3,Tue Jul 14 15:54:34 2015 UTC,I think you nailed it. It looks like you're kicking a little too far backwards instead of ~45 degrees. You also might be picking your feet up a little early instead of extending your stride and flicking your toe. Overall looks pretty good though IMO.
hockeyplayers,3d9h6s,GibsonLP86,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:57:49 2015 UTC,"That's a very good point, I think that's why it seems a little ""choppy"". I've honestly never given any thought into what I do with my toes, so hopefully working on the ""flick"" will help. Thanks!"

Drop your ass more like your about to sit on the john to add more power to your stride. If you bend your knees a bit more you won't have so much lost movement in your push off and try moving your arms north and south, they flail a bit to the sides. looks good though, you skate with your head up."
hockeyplayers,3d9h6s,deadlyernest,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:23:07 2015 UTC,"Yup, that's right! I was fortunate enough to be able to play a pick-up game there in February. The Avs have been my team since I was a kid, so it was a dream come true.    So almost like you're in the squat rack, right? I'll give that a try. My arm swings can get a little haphazard when I'm going all out, so that'll have to be reigned in a bit as well. Thanks for the help!"
hockeyplayers,3d9h6s,deadlyernest,3,Tue Jul 14 18:17:42 2015 UTC,"I think /u/bravochar and /u/kr580 both hit the big points.  I'll throw a few more things in.  1)  Right as you cross the first blue, you drop your head, and chest way down, then again as you cross the red (though not as drastically) - if you want to see what your feet are doing - what your video!  Dropping your head/chest will force your weight towards your toes, which will compound your issue kicking your heels up.  Try the ""Toe Scrape"" drill (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isxE1w_b-tY) can't find Laura's version, but it will help keep your heels down towards the end of your stride.  Focus on the flick of your toe, but keep it low all the way back until your heels touch.  2) You're bobbing a bit as well.  It's not too bad, but that might be part of what you feel makes you 'look funny'.  Try simple C-cuts, but skate next to the boards, and watch your reflection in the glass.  Get low, start your C-cuts, and try to keep your reflection from moving up and down.  3) Regarding your hands going side-to-side, keep the idea that you don't want your hands to cross the center-line of your body.  In reality, it's going to happen, particularly when you're going full-speed, but try to drill it out as much as possible. It looks like your stick hand is in pretty good position (thumb down to palm up), but it's pretty low and in front of your knees instead of extending forward.  Because of that it's back-swing ends up flaring out to the side instead of sticking closer to your body.  Your top hand, well it looks  a little lazy, but the same thing applies, it's coming in across your center line so it's swinging out wide as well."

hockeyplayers,3dbzgv,HockeyZombie36,8,Wed Jul 15 02:27:19 2015 UTC,Depends on how much you put into those hours.

There are no beginners out there. Your area of the country may differ."
hockeyplayers,3dbzgv,nealoc187,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:11:26 2015 UTC,"Depends on the club division and the club itself as well. ACHA DI is no joke. THe squad I was on every player had played at least a little AAA, and a lot of those dudes could have made NCAA DIII rosters no problem, a few eventually did. Someone starting out as a freshman will never play DI club hockey.  The step down to ACHA DII was really big, though. A player starting before their freshman year could be a decent to good DIII player by senior year, try really hard and they could be a serviceable DII player."
hockeyplayers,3dbzgv,JonnyBox,2,Wed Jul 15 15:56:41 2015 UTC,"I'd definitely say invest in skating lessons.

My skating improved exponentially when I started going for lessons, my stride was so much better."
hockeyplayers,3dbzgv,breadwinger,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:33:16 2015 UTC,"I agree with this, learn how to skate and then figure the rest out after that. Skating is easily the most important skill to being a good hockey player. So get half decent at skating then worry about working with a stick and puck (those skills will take a long time to develop). I've been playing hockey my entire life and still have stone hands."
hockeyplayers,3dbzgv,RhynoSorceress,2,Wed Jul 15 14:10:35 2015 UTC,"If you want to play club hockey, you need to start yesterday. Enroll in adult learn to skate at your nearest rink. Tell them the goal is hockey. THey probably have an adult learn to play hockey progression. Follow it, and hit open skate as much as possible. You need to treat club hockey as you would a varsity sport. Work out, run, eat right, and SKATE. Skate all the goddamn time. And don't just go wheel around the ice either. Smoke yourself every skate. Work hard on individual skills, then do sprints. Get the most out of every skate.  To answer your question: there is no good answer. Good is relative. A good D leaguer is an average at best C leaguer. I'm a high level beer league player, but throw me in with guys with ECHL experience and I'll look like hot garbage."
hockeyplayers,3dbzgv,JonnyBox,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:24:44 2015 UTC,"I did a rough tally of my hours played/practiced earlier this year and my estimate came to about 400 hours. Probably super inaccurate but since I don't actually log my time played that's the best I got.  I play at the absolute lowest division at my local rink and I'd say most skaters are better than me. The worst NHL player is a million times better than I, the worst college level player is better than I, and the worst high school varsity player is better than I.  So measure yourself accordingly."
hockeyplayers,3dbzgv,xzzy,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:31:33 2015 UTC,"I've probably put in over 500 hours in the past three years.

Unless I'm willing to make it a priority, I'll always be a marginal player at the lowest level at best. So decent would be a stretch for me. YMMV."

If his business is anything like himself, you are in good hands.  I trained with Maria back when I played jr b and have nothing bad to say about her. Over one summer I packed on 15 lbs (i am a lighter guy who had trouble gaining) of muscle while increasing my agility. She really understands the muscles you use in hockey, how to strengthen them, and then teach them how to react more quickly. I can only imagine her workout plan is similar to her as a personal trainer. Plus it didn't hurt the Tessa Virtue trained after me.   Between the two, I would give the edge to Maria but strictly on a bias of my personal experience. Hockeytraining.com has garnered a lot of growth though."

However, this will cost about $50 every couple years, so if you only spend that much on gloves anyway, might as well get fresh sets."
hockeyplayers,3d8u36,Zuvielify,2,Tue Jul 14 20:33:04 2015 UTC,"Pretty much the same exact for me, except I think my last two pairs only lasted about 2 years, give-or-take."
hockeyplayers,3d8u36,absoludicrous,3,Wed Jul 15 22:20:29 2015 UTC,"My last pair have lasted me in beer leagues and pickups since 2004. But I picked up another pair that i alternated with around 2009. They're both the same size but the ones from 2004 seem really loose compared to the newer ones. I was going to get them repalmed, but I ended up picking up a new pair that fit a lot tighter.   I use tacki mac grips on my sticks and my palms last a lot longer than most of my teammates. They eventually started to wear down after many years of use but. Other than the palms, I don't really see a reason to get new gloves except for smell or preference. You can always get the gloves repalmed if you like them. But theres nothing wrong with being a gear whore and picking up a few sets. Sometimes you just need a change in your game and picking up a new set of gear can help."
hockeyplayers,3d8u36,DeleriumTrigger,2,Tue Jul 14 20:02:15 2015 UTC,"I get about 18 months out of a pair usually. I replace them when they are so hard and crunchy that cleaning and soaking doesn't make them soft again,, usually."

I had bought one pair freshman year and the palms and outer parts of the glove started to tear by the end of sophomore year. So, I bought new gloves, but the same model at the beginning of junior year. About half way through the year, I had replaced my torn up ones from freshman year. Now I have two pairs of gloves."
hockeyplayers,3d8u36,kingofthediamond,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:35:50 2015 UTC,I usually get a new pair every year. I hate when the palms bead up or get ripped. I'm really picky. I don't bother re-palming them because I could just get a new pair. It would cost about $50 to repalm or $50-$100 for a new pair. Except for some freak of nature in which my current gloves (which i've had for a year and a half) still look brand new.

hockeyplayers,3d7a6k,kriskringle19,7,Tue Jul 14 01:59:51 2015 UTC,This helped me correct mistakes I was making. Be cognizant of how you're shooting and focus on forum before power.  Practice practice practice   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZqBSBpAsE0
hockeyplayers,3d7a6k,johnnyprimusjr,2,Tue Jul 14 02:06:08 2015 UTC,"This video is great - opening and closing the blade of the stick not only helps with lift but it also puts a ton of spin on the puck if you can get the timing right. Similar to how spin on bullets increases their accuracy, spin on the puck will help immensely with being able to accurately place your shots on the ice.   With regard to slapshots, I'm not sure if I shoot normally, but I tend to slightly angle the blade of my stick back to add height to my shots, plus it always helps to follow through high (up to about shoulder height as a maximum).       It's mostly about practice and getting to know the feeling of a good shot, so get out there and shoot as much as you can - the technique will develop with time."
hockeyplayers,3d7a6k,TehRhawb,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:10:59 2015 UTC,Consider hand position when you shoot. Hold your bottom hand lower on the shaft for more lift when you release.
hockeyplayers,3d7a6k,linedechoes,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:52:39 2015 UTC,"Head up , and you want to snap with the lower hand , sometimes you can cheat on a wrist shot by shuffling the puck up , don't let yourself get used to it . Keep practicing ! It will come with time   I still can't take a great slap shot and I have played for over 20 years lol but my backhand is a thing of beauty :) lol good luck !"
hockeyplayers,3d7a6k,Dandry420,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:05:21 2015 UTC,"Are your wrists closed or open when you're shooting? When I'm shooting low (on the ice to about 15""), I tend to keep my hands closed over the top of the stick, and let the blade point downwards through the shot.   With corners, I tend to open my wrists a bit following through the shot, and use the heel to point where I want the puck to go rather than the toe.   Try that it might help. Form and technique make up more to these type of shots than power does so remember that. If you can shoot it fast, but not accurate, it doesn't matter."

hockeyplayers,3d7k0q,Sjamsjon,4,Tue Jul 14 09:04:19 2015 UTC,"There is no valid reason not to play it you enjoy it.  I live in the Netherlands, hockey is fairly unknown and not at all popular.   I fell in love with the game at 15 years old and started playing with the local club (12 guys, one trainer who did everything pro bono and an empty shipping container as a locker room). Our rink was a third of regulation size and outside, so we couldn't compete in any of the competitions and rarely played any games and often practices were canceled because of our trademark Dutch rain. I loved every second there and even though I moved on to play for my University I still think of that place as the ultimate hockey-experience.  I am really happy with my development in my 7 years of playing. I can keep up with and outskate most of my peers in the league. Our college-league has players of every level, there's guys who picked up a stick only last year and there's the Swedish/Russian/Canadian exchange students that could easily go pro in Germany but choose to play in our league.   Not a single time has anyone laughed at a beginner, because when all is said and done you share a passion for an amazing sport. And that should never be something to make fun of, and should always be something to applaud and motivate.   Might be because hockey players are rare in the Netherlands, but every single hockey player I know is my friend and everyone who wants to learn the game I will teach everything I know.  Go for it man. I'd hate for you to miss out on a lifetime of fun."

I'd say join the lowest level rec league you can find. It's the best way to get better (IMO) and it puts you around lots of other players who you can chat with/observe/ask for tips and advice.
hockeyplayers,3d7k0q,NiceGuyUncle,3,Tue Jul 14 04:31:54 2015 UTC,"I started skating at 38, played in my first adult league game at 39. Local recreational leagues are designed to be competitive regardless of skill level, so I feel like an NHL'er, even though I can barely skate."

hockeyplayers,3d7k0q,guitarguy12410,2,Tue Jul 14 06:01:08 2015 UTC,"I started when I was 7 or 8 (I'm 22 now). Just ignore feeling jealous. There's always going to be someone better than you on the ice whether you just started or have been playing for 10+ years so you'll have to get used to it.  Just try to stick with it. You'll improve over time without a doubt and it's never too late to start. If you're in your late teens, you are probably eligible for adult league or will be soon. Talk to your local rink and see if there are any beginner level leagues. The best way to learn the game and improve is to get yourself out on the ice and give it your all."

I've been playing since i was 6 (almost 21 now), I stopped playing for about 2 years due to school and other things and after I got back into it I realized how far I had fallen behind. I was playing open hockey a few months ago and there was always AT LEAST two people who could wipe the rink with me. Just keep on sticking to it, as long as you're having fun."

hockeyplayers,3d7k0q,kade_m,2,Tue Jul 14 14:37:14 2015 UTC,"I started at 19. I am still playing today, 25 years later.  My advice would be not to judge your abilities or progress against kids who have been playing since they were 6 or 7. The later you start, the harder it is to develop the right form and to get to a point where you feel really comfortable on skates. It will happen, but it takes time.  It's probably too late for you to start an NHL-bound career, but that doesn't mean you can't still get to be really good and have a lot of fun in the process.  I coach kids who skate and puck-handle better than I do all the time. I've been playing hockey longer than they've been walking, but I'll never skate as ""naturally"" as kids who started when they were 6. And that's totally OK with me. I play 2-3 times per week and I am starting to slow down now, but hockey is still the thing I most look forward to every week."

The parents thought I was an instructor. I put in a ton of effort because I loved the sport and I loved skating for the sport and I certainly got out what I put in. Even when I didn't have class I would find rinks that offered skating times and use those open ice times to repeat basic drills until I was sufficient at them. I would say my speed needs work and my balance on one foot needs attention but other than that I am fully capable of playing in a game (backwards skating, crossing over, stops on the inside and outside edges). Of course I'm not perfect out there either. When I hit the ice I alway critique myself on what I could be doing better. It drives me to be the best player out there."

I would just go to practice and focusing on improving small things day by day. This isn't going to be an overnight process and will take time. Your body has to get used to working with the muscles required for skating. It's basically like reteaching yourself to walk.  Just find some beginner classes and work on improving one aspect of your game a day. It doesn't matter if it's just skating while moving with the puck. Make short term goals that add up to get you to your final goal.
hockeyplayers,3d7k0q,kingofthediamond,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:26:23 2015 UTC,"I am 29 and started 2 months ago. I played shinny here and there in high school and roller hockey growing up, but never played in a league or had any formal instruction.  I felt the same way as you when I jumped back out on the ice a couple months ago, but you need to swallow that and realize that the only way to get better is keep working at it. I have been out on the ice at least twice a week practicing and have come leaps and bounds from where I started. Before you know it a year will go by and you will be skating circles around others.   Instead of watching those kids skate well and feel bad about yourself, watch and learn from them. I often play with kids 10-15 years younger than myself and I watch how they skate and play intently to learn how to be better.  You're gonna be fine, trust us. The only thing I have regretted about picking up hockey at 29 is that I didn't pick it up sooner. I wish I had learned in my teens."

One day, on a whim and out of boredom, a friend who's played for 11 years grabbed his extra sticks and we bought a cheap practice net so we could play in his driveway. Once I got a chance to play (Somewhat, since it was only in the driveway), I knew right away I wanted to play for real.  I think I maybe went skating once when I was like 4. When you're 4, you suck at everything, so I probably never wanted to skate again. So here I am, I just bought a pair of inline rollerblades so I can fuck around in my driveway and teach myself how to skate before I make the transition to skating on the ice. I plan on getting comfortable with the motions before winter because my friends and I are thinking about making our own outdoor rink since we have some space. They can already skate and I can't, so I figure I'll take the time now so I can spend the winter playing and not learning how to skate. We'll see how it goes but I'll argue that it's never too late.

hockeyplayers,3d4bpl,howtohockeydotcom,11,Mon Jul 13 12:26:01 2015 UTC,"For most people, the best way to improve power on your shot is to tweak your technique. Just shooting pucks and using a radar gun does wonders. I was trying to max out my slapshot and seemed to plateau at 75MPH no matter what I did.   I decided to see what effect having muscles would do, so I started a somewhat regular workout routine focusing on movements and muscles involved in shooting.   After a few months I was messing around and fired up the radar gun, without even warming up I was hitting 80MPH no problem.   Out of curiosity I brought the radar gun on the ice and maxed out at 88MPH  These numbers don't sound too spectacular, but from what I've seen most hockey players grossly overestimate the speed of their shot. Every time I've used the radar gun with friends they've told me how hard their shot is, tested it, and then have been dumbfounded by the result, claiming the radar gun is faulty, etc.   I've concluded that in order to top 100MPH it takes A LOT of hard work and dedication. (being naturally tall, heavy and strong also helps a lot)  Anyways, back on topic. This workout is a lot of fun, and has big results as it works all the muscles involved in shooting in a very similar way and a very similar movement. You will be building the muscles, but also training them to fire in quick succession to generate power. Legs, core, arms, all working together."

hockeyplayers,3d66uh,pleated_pants,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:03:21 2015 UTC,I went from the 7500 to an Easton e600 when the pads fell out of the Bauer and continue to use the true vision cage. I like the Easton much better.
hockeyplayers,3d66uh,modtrax,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:03:05 2015 UTC,"I have the 9 and love it. The 7 and even the 11 sat high on my head and just felt off.   At the end of the day, the 9 is a more traditional feel so it all comes down to your preference and comfort with current setup."
hockeyplayers,3d66uh,avanross,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:59:07 2015 UTC,"Ims9 doesn't have any gel pads, so you won't have that issue, it's also newer and has some of bauers top of the line poron foam, so it should be more protective. The big thing with bauer helmets is that they're all slightly different shaped, so the ims won't fit the exact same as the 7500, so make sure you're 100% comfortable in it and there's no pressure at all.  And yes, cages will fit up or down a size and virtually all brands are compatible. You might just have to slightly bend the cage wider or narrower to get that perfect fit into the J-clips. Should be easy to do by hand.  And if you're looking to buy from phl, they'll give you any cage 50% with the purchase of a helmet, so you can get a nicer one with slimmer bars that will greatly improve your visibility. I'm still sour that these cages didn't exist when I used one.. They're pretty sweet"
hockeyplayers,3d66uh,avanross,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:04:12 2015 UTC,"Interesting. I did notice that it fit a little snug on my forehead and a little wider in the sides. The 7500 fits me almost perfectly, no pressure points. Something to consider I guess. Whats phl? I was going to get it a pure hockey at the tent sale"
hockeyplayers,3d66uh,avanross,1 point,Tue Jul 14 05:03:16 2015 UTC,"Bauers 5500 and 4500 are a bit older, but don't have those gel pads and are both a bit cheaper then the ims9. I'd suggest you try on  those and pretty much any helmets you can find in your price range and base your decision solely on comfort. Phl/pro hockey life is the big hockey store in Canada. They don't have a ton of locations outside of the major cities though."
hockeyplayers,3d66uh,stevegcook,1 point,Tue Jul 14 05:15:39 2015 UTC,I definitely don't want the 4500 because the protection sucks. I really don't like the straight foam which is why I'm concerned with the IMS9 but I can't be spending $100 a year on a new lid when the gel pads fall out.
hockeyplayers,3d6t2b,IndyJonesy,3,Mon Jul 13 23:43:33 2015 UTC,"biggest thing is relax man. I've done tryouts from JV to minor leagues. They're all the same, and your attitude and personality off the ice means just as much as your abilities on the ice.   Be a positive force for your team, and you'll do just fine."

hockeyplayers,3d6t2b,JonnyBox,3,Tue Jul 14 04:39:38 2015 UTC,"Zone out, play hard.   After, try to talk to coach. Let him know that if you don't make the team, you'd still love to be a practice player, so you can get better, and ask for any points to improve on. Coaches love that shit."
hockeyplayers,3d6t2b,1966mopar,2,Tue Jul 14 18:07:59 2015 UTC,"I sort of know how you feel. I still get a bit nervous before I play, especially with new people. What I've been doing is telling myself just to take it easy out there but when I get out I push hard. I dunno, it works for me. I also only play pickup no leagues. Too old for that lol. Good luck."
hockeyplayers,3d6t2b,Dandry420,2,Tue Jul 14 02:28:58 2015 UTC,"Take a deep breath , don't grip your stick too tight , and play your game , don't let your mind race with too many thoughts.

hockeyplayers,3d65tc,Obeyryan,4,Mon Jul 13 20:49:58 2015 UTC,"Thrifty White Board is always my go-to for this. It's literally dry erase board in a large sheet. It has a melamine coating but the board itself is very thin and much lighter than traditional MDF melamine boards. A 4'x8' sheet will cost you about $13 and whichever store you buy it from can cut it to size for you if it's too big as-is.  Buy some B'laster Silicone Lube spray, spray on a little bit (it goes a long way), lightly smear it around with a rag until you have a nice thin layer of it on the board and then let it dry. When it's 'dry' it'll be as slick as ice.  You can shoot off it as well. Just be sure it's on a hard, flat surface. If it's on something soft it can bow and crack without proper support underneath since it's so thin. If you want to shoot on something like grass you could always get a matched size of plywood to put underneath as a base."
hockeyplayers,3d65tc,kr580,1 point,Tue Jul 14 07:43:33 2015 UTC,Thanks. So much help. Will check out my local home Depot this weekend.   Do you need to reapply that spray every so often? Or is it like a once off?
hockeyplayers,3d65tc,Hurricane_Viking,2,Tue Jul 14 13:55:13 2015 UTC,"The spray will last awhile. I've had mine for a few months and I only re-sprayed it once. It didn't really need it, I was just bored."
hockeyplayers,3d65tc,brttpckr,2,Tue Jul 14 15:03:10 2015 UTC,Go to home depot and get a piece of melamine board and a can of pledge. I work for a company that builds white boards . So i just use a 4x4 piece of scrap and some pledge

hockeyplayers,3d65tc,TheGhostOfSagan,3,Mon Jul 13 23:11:12 2015 UTC,"I got something called ""Panel Board"" i think it was. Essentially it was dry erase material. It was $15 for a 4'x8' panel, and with a little bit of pledge, normal pucks move pretty similarly to ice. It's best if you can get it home in one piece, but I had to cut mine down. Still worked pretty well, the edges just get a bit roughed up."
hockeyplayers,3d65tc,aaronwhite1786,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:21:49 2015 UTC,"I was thinking about putting a panel like this on my garage floor. Do you use it to shoot? If so, I'm wondering if the pad moves around on you or not?"
hockeyplayers,3d65tc,TheGhostOfSagan,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:37:04 2015 UTC,"I've had them on my smooth garage floor, and never had them slip. If you notice it slipping, you could probably put a moist towel, or silicone baking sheet under it to help it stick. Works for slick cutting boards on stainless steel, can't see why it wouldn't help with a shooting pad.  They've got enough weight though, I think you'll be okay.  If you want, I can try and get a video tomorrow. I'm not a good shot, but it might help."
hockeyplayers,3d65tc,aaronwhite1786,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:58:55 2015 UTC,"That's good to know, my garage surface is really rough so if you didn't have any trouble on a smooth surface,  then I'm thinking I'll probably be in good shape. Thanks for the info! Gonna go get one in the next week or two. Someone made the suggestion of going to a military surplus store and getting a big net to hang up and just put tape where the goal would be. Can't wait to finally get some practice in"
hockeyplayers,3d65tc,kingofthediamond,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:11:58 2015 UTC,The net idea sounds like a good one. I've just got some stacked cardboard from all of the new desks I put machines on at work. Thick and filled with smaller boxes.   An actual goal and net behind it would be way nicer
hockeyplayers,3d65tc,yacadelic,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:17:53 2015 UTC,I forgot what its called but you can use this essentially a white board. they come like 8 feet but 12 feet for like $12.
hockeyplayers,3d65tc,1966mopar,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:51:51 2015 UTC,Melamine. Its in the comment above :)
hockeyplayers,3d65tc,yacadelic,2,Tue Jul 14 02:08:59 2015 UTC,I bought a 4 by 8 sheet of hard board from home depot. Got some pledge and away I go. I also fabbed up my own rebounder with 2 by 4's and a black bungee cord.
hockeyplayers,3d65tc,kingofthediamond,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:32:45 2015 UTC,Ahh Yeah i also made my own puck passer it's awesome
hockeyplayers,3d65tc,yacadelic,1 point,Tue Jul 14 07:32:26 2015 UTC,"I dont think it was melamine though, it was very thin"
hockeyplayers,3d65tc,kr580,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:23:49 2015 UTC,Hmmm i think i know what you're talking about. It may just be a thin melamine in not too sure
hockeyplayers,3d65tc,nick92675,0,Tue Jul 14 07:33:08 2015 UTC,It's 'thrifty white board' which has a melamine coating. Boards advertised as 'melamine board' are usually thicker MDF boards which I'm guessing is what you're thinking of.
hockeyplayers,3d6zbu,buddhaplayshockey,7,Tue Jul 14 00:33:37 2015 UTC,Roll your wrists forward when you release the shot.
hockeyplayers,3d6zbu,kingofthediamond,2,Tue Jul 14 01:17:13 2015 UTC,This is true otherwise you're playing golf. If I don't roll those wrists the shot is even higher and flutters off the toe.
hockeyplayers,3d6zbu,THE_LOBATOMIZER,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:41:51 2015 UTC,"this will keep your shots down, also I;ve noticed that if I don't follow through all the way the puck dips mid flight. kind of like a 12-6 curve ball, really good for making goalies look silly."
hockeyplayers,3d6zbu,kingofthediamond,1 point,Tue Jul 14 06:20:25 2015 UTC,Yeah the follow through is just as important
hockeyplayers,3d6zbu,the5thLight,3,Tue Jul 14 13:08:22 2015 UTC,"Are you snapping off your back foot? Can you snap off your front foot?  Most people that have a solid wrist shot, but no slap shot, often shoot off their back foot. They're not using the stick in their shots, relying on their arms and hands to generate power.  Shooting off the back foot has a tendency to raise your hands in the follow through. That's great if you're in close trying to elevate, but not always the best thing to do.  Try taking shots, any shots, off your front foot only."
hockeyplayers,3d6zbu,yacadelic,3,Tue Jul 14 02:00:32 2015 UTC,"Yes, and to add to that, mske sure you are really transferring weight. Even on quick snapshots i really use energy from the ground to get maxium power and velocity"
hockeyplayers,3d6zbu,the5thLight,2,Tue Jul 14 02:16:36 2015 UTC,"Agreed.  In fact, snapshots are more about anticipation than anything else. Watch the pros when they take a snapshot. It's not like the were all of a sudden surprised by the puck and decided to shoot. They're already loading the stick/transferring weight before the puck gets to them.  You should know you're going to take a snapshot well before you actually do."
hockeyplayers,3d6zbu,willbreev4food,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:19:52 2015 UTC,Worth taking a look at. I'm pretty sure I take the snapper off the front foot or a bit past it. But... I don't watch myself taking shots. Maybe I need to film myself to get a better look at what I'm doing. I take the wrist shot from past the back foot and think I'm releasing off the front but once again I'm not watching myself. Getting tired of the flyers.
hockeyplayers,3d6zbu,DaaaBears91,4,Tue Jul 14 02:39:40 2015 UTC,"Shooting the puck low requires an outward wrist snap and longer extension of your bottom hand on the stick. The toe of your blade should be pointing towards the bottom of the net during your follow through.   In practice, take ten snapshots at the top corner, and take ten shots low, and compare the difference in your mechanics. If you're still having trouble, take your practice shots at 50% power. You make quick passes all the time, right? The motion isn't that different.   Developing a powerful low snapper is worth the effort, I promise. With years of practice, I've learned to place those pucks consistently and it's deadly. Goalscorers don't need to shoot pucks hard, they just need to shoot them accurately and release them quickly.  Probably doesn't have anything to do with your equipment. It's possible I'm biased (20 years experience, currently own three different sticks, all different patterns and lies, 65, 85, and 100 flexes, and I can pick corners easily with all three.) Players obsess over equipment and ignore fundamental mechanics when they encounter trouble.   Seen hundreds of players develop a top-corner tick. If they get rushed or pressured, their bodies just automatically shoot high and usually hit nothing but glass. Gotta change habits with practice."
hockeyplayers,3d6zbu,GibsonLP86,2,Tue Jul 14 03:08:04 2015 UTC,I had that problem with the P92 and the P88.  I now use a P106 and love it
hockeyplayers,3d6zbu,bene37,2,Tue Jul 14 01:10:54 2015 UTC,"close your wrists when you're shooting, and keep the toe pointed flat across the ice when you shoot. This should help bring the shot down."
hockeyplayers,3d6zbu,0Psmom,2,Tue Jul 14 04:08:05 2015 UTC,Try keeping your blade closed all the time by grabbing the stick differently. Not always necessary to open up the blade at all. I sometimes do that on all shots if I have to keep them low.
hockeyplayers,3d5tnf,domoarigatodrloboto,3,Mon Jul 13 19:26:14 2015 UTC,"Think of the physics here. With the sticks blade integrity intact, you're getting full leverage on your shot, with maximum potential energy transferred to the ice (and puck) for the maximum shaft torque. When there's a crack in this system, you're losing out on potential energy as well as accuracy. The crack is going to dissipate the energy rather than store it, so yes you'll lose power.   tl;dr   Yes you'll lose power from a broken/cracked stick."
hockeyplayers,3d5tnf,GibsonLP86,2,Mon Jul 13 19:41:11 2015 UTC,"I figured I'd lose power, but the change was just so drastic. I mean, I get that a crack is going to disrupt things, but it's like it went from 60 to 0."
hockeyplayers,3d5tnf,GibsonLP86,3,Mon Jul 13 19:44:46 2015 UTC,"Welcome to modern hockey. :)   The sticks are engineered now to give maximum whip and power for minimal weight. If you disrupt the closed system the stick is working in, then you will drastically affect its performance."
hockeyplayers,3d5tnf,GibsonLP86,2,Mon Jul 13 19:49:00 2015 UTC,fuckin' physics...
hockeyplayers,3d5tnf,lippyjose,2,Mon Jul 13 19:50:04 2015 UTC,Sports physics is fascinating. Knowing how the physics works actually can make you a better athlete as well.
hockeyplayers,3d5tnf,chenac,2,Mon Jul 13 19:51:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it'll change how you can load the blade.    IMO, the stiffer the blade the better.  I've taken a heat gun to sticks to change the pattern and gone too far, weakening the blade.  After that my shots have reduced power."
hockeyplayers,3d5tnf,kingofthediamond,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:45:33 2015 UTC,"Yup, toe cracks plague my sticks, too. I tend to notice the biggest impact on stickhandling, though... it feels like I'm trying to control the puck with a sponge. It was night-and-day when I picked up a new twig, and now I'm back to the crisp feel we all know and love."
hockeyplayers,3d5tnf,kingofthediamond,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:57:23 2015 UTC,Do you tape the toe of your stick?
hockeyplayers,3d6ta1,NoPucksGiven,3,Mon Jul 13 23:45:08 2015 UTC,"Well I suggest one of two things if you're losing your passion. If you're able to, try a new rink if there's another relatively close.  My other suggestion is to take a month or a season off. Just take a break and reevaluate on whether you want to keep playing."
hockeyplayers,3d6ta1,weev51,3,Tue Jul 14 07:29:19 2015 UTC,"Find a nice pick up group to play with instead of playing in a hack league. Less stress, more fun, just as much of a sweat if you want it to be."
hockeyplayers,3d6ta1,Ham_n_eggs,3,Tue Jul 14 14:58:09 2015 UTC,"This exactly.  I play pickup 3 mornings a week.  It's invite only, so if you get asked, you pay up front for the ""season"" (Fall, Winter, and Summer).  If you're a dangerous player, rarely show up, or just a jerk, you don't get asked back for the next session.  Weeds out most of the douchery."
hockeyplayers,3d6ta1,fiveholefrenchie,2,Tue Jul 14 20:22:14 2015 UTC,Sorry to hear about the shitty team you were on. Is there a Hockey North America league where you are? They're a lot more structured and organized.
hockeyplayers,3d6ta1,BleedBlueToDeath,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:24:18 2015 UTC,I will look into it but I think the rinks around me are all just run privately so your at the mercy of the hockey directors and rink staff.
hockeyplayers,3d6ta1,BleedBlueToDeath,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:54:22 2015 UTC,That really sucks. I'm sorry.
hockeyplayers,3d6ta1,buddhaplayshockey,2,Tue Jul 14 04:13:20 2015 UTC,"Well now that you've got that off your chest I hope that you're still playing. Are there any other leagues in the area that are better run? The two leagues in my area are pretty much the same as every where else I've read or heard about. The top three teams all beat the shit out of the bottom three or four, bring d-1 college ringers who ramp it up, hitting is often over looked. I guess it's just part of the game. I'd love to hear from others where their rinks are run differently.   Menstrual girls is pretty funny. Do they play for the Menstrual Cup?  Bad joke but do hope you find some serenity and keep playing."
hockeyplayers,3d5gy7,kingofthediamond,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:57:55 2015 UTC,"Are you referring to the ones in the contest?  If so, the specs are the same as the standard CXT. The custom winners choose hand, flex, curve, grip, and name plate."
hockeyplayers,3d5gy7,OzziePao13,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:45:49 2015 UTC,they have a white custom stick in their stores designed just for pure hockey. They usually have their own models with upgraded specs. I cant find it on their website
hockeyplayers,3d5gy7,OzziePao13,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:01:45 2015 UTC,"Almost all the SMU sticks made by Easton, Bauer, and Sherwood for PH are the same specs as the upper mid tier - to top of the line stick that they are modeled after. It's usually a special paint job, nothing else."
hockeyplayers,3d5gy7,OzziePao13,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:26:33 2015 UTC,"Its defintiely more than a paint job. I saw them in the store. Weight was different, texture, color. But I want specifics"
hockeyplayers,3d4bcm,bene37,2,Mon Jul 13 12:22:27 2015 UTC,"It could also be a ""pro stock"" stick that is designed for teams who do not get custom options such as Tier 2 Jr. A, CIS or D3 college teams. The often come reinforced in the breakage points and sometimes have different blade materials."
hockeyplayers,3d4bcm,crsmith,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:11:28 2015 UTC,"It's probably like that. It weighs 455 grams, 30 grams more than at another web store."
hockeyplayers,3d4bcm,jjdwjr,2,Mon Jul 13 15:16:38 2015 UTC,Not many NHL players are using such a low flex. Only ones I can think of are Briere and Kessel. Probably a Pro-stock for college teams or something.
hockeyplayers,3d4bcm,IMCDC5,2,Mon Jul 13 14:32:11 2015 UTC,"I heard that there are instances where players just get a certain stick in all flex configs (75, 80, 85, 90, 95, etc) to try them out; then they pick one they like and send the others back.   This could be an instance of that I guess..."
hockeyplayers,3d4bcm,kingofthediamond,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:29:05 2015 UTC,"It may not in fact be a pro stock but a ""cheaper alternative"". Where did you buy the stick?"
hockeyplayers,3d4bcm,kingofthediamond,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:23:13 2015 UTC,I bought it from a scandinavian sports store called XXL
hockeyplayers,3d4bcm,GibsonLP86,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:12:09 2015 UTC,What are the markings on the name plate? is it like the normal stick? or could you show a picture
hockeyplayers,3d4bcm,GibsonLP86,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:32:35 2015 UTC,"This could be a 'minor league' stick. One that has more strict design constraints (and some customization), but not a 'made in canada' one.   A lot of minor leagues like ECHL will have 'pro stock' sticks, but they're just generics that the players can pick.   Can you post pictures of the stick, the name plate, and the heel side of the shaft?"
hockeyplayers,3d4bcm,willdesignforfood,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:35:47 2015 UTC,"Right now I'm away from home but I can take a few pics later. The differences in graphics are 1. Empty nameplate, 2. No yellow stripe in the bottom of the blade and 3. No CCM logo on blade. Other interesting thing I found on the stick is that there is some rubbing marks in the point where the blade meets the shaft. They don't seem deep but still weird.  Markings on the nameplate only include P29 and 75 flex IIRC"
hockeyplayers,3d4bcm,GibsonLP86,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:19:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's a pro stock stick, it's just a 'patterned' stick (think default, classic, veteran controls in video games). What they'll do, is pick X number of stick/flex/flexpoint patterns and then send the teams those sticks. It's cheaper for minor league teams to do this, rather than have fully customized sticks for each player."
hockeyplayers,3d4bcm,willdesignforfood,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:36:30 2015 UTC,Don't the custom pro stock CCM's usually have an H-- versus the P--?
hockeyplayers,3d4bcm,GibsonLP86,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:24:56 2015 UTC,"It just depends. From what he's describing it sounds like it's a pro-stock, but the real indicator is if it has warranty information printed on the heel side of the shaft. If that's there then it's a consumer twig.  I'm just using anecdotal evidence with the H-P-D argument, as wehn I was using CCMs, they used the abovementioned letters to describe their twig curves."
hockeyplayers,3d4bcm,MF26,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:36:43 2015 UTC,Gotcha. I'm using a pro stock RBZ right now and it's got an H-- code on it. But you might be right about the P-- being patterned stock rather than a fully custom.

My dad was always my biggest supporter but also my most critical coach lol that was never a bad thing , but he was always on the bench and always gave me advice on how I was in game. Canadian and all I guess that's the way she goes.   My mom was a real star , she always gave me pb&j before a game, cheered loud for me on the ice and It seemed like I always played better with her there ! Best part was treating me to a post game Teen Burger from A&W lol   I just recall a game where I really took over. It was a tournament away, mom drove me out and gave me my pb&j before each game . I ended the tournament with 8 goals 13pts over 5 games including the Hatrick in the championship game . Granted I was younger playing in a Bantam Rep team. But those were some fond memories. Hockey Moms /Dads are amazing . It sucks to see some parents really lose there shit over their kids performance. I'm lucky I was never those kids !   Spoiler , my third goal was a breakaway ; shot it off the goalies chest, and batted it five hole out of the air . I don't think I'll ever play a game like That ever again lol thanks for reading and letting me reminisce."

The ones near me usually have a pretty decent selection of used hockey equipment that is pretty cheap.   I will warn you that its going to be hard to find a decent cheap pair of skates. There are a bunch of bauer skates on sale, but expect to pay ~$150 on sale for a decent pair of skates. The most important thing is going to be fit, so you really should go to a shop and try some on. I was lucky that I got a pair of barely used Bauer XVI skates for $60, but I wouldn't hold your breath for a deal like that.   You may also want to check out Tron Hockey for cheap, new gear."

Check out [Hockey Monkey](www.hockeymonkey.com). They have a decent clearance section which is where I got my first stick from. If you have the opportunity, check out a hockey store when you're out of town. My brother is going to college in Minnesota so I was able to swing by a store and try on some different gloves and skates to get an idea of what my fit was and then I've since ordered stuff online based on that experience."

You can get higher quality for your money, which is great.  For skates, other people are saying you need to spend extra to do it right. I got a pair of used $35 skates at Play It Again about 8 years ago, and am still using them today. I skate a lot (everyday in the fall-spring seasons), and skating is what I'm best at in hockey. If you are new to skating, you don't necessarily need an extremely expensive skate, but the fit is important. Make sure nothing hurts when you try them on. Spending +$100 would help, but I know plenty of newer players that start out on the cheapest Bauer skates."

Different brands fit differently, Bauer might fit me best, Easton or Graf or CCM might fit you best.  Don't buy a brand or model just because your friends like them.  Top of the line skates are probably too stiff for you, but you'll get better bang for your buck buying a previous model of mid-tier skates on closeout--check HockeyMonkey, HockeyGiant, HockeyWorld, PureHockey, TotalHockey, IceWarehouse, HockeyTron, etc.  Worst case, trace your foot and see if HockeyMonkey can help fit you."

When I was there, we'd sell AI-9s for like 75 just because we had so many, and they're 'old' now.  What were the prices on other things there, good?"

hockeyplayers,3cxfru,Skyline_BNR34,1 point,Sat Jul 11 23:01:16 2015 UTC,"Bauer and CCM/Reebok give the most info on the nameplate, pretty much identical nameplate identifications.  Easton only gives the flex without the white sticker.  Not too sure about Warrior, they give flex at least."
hockeyplayers,3cxfru,Ineedsomethingtodo,1 point,Sun Jul 12 05:59:54 2015 UTC,"Takea picture of the nameplate.  Bauer makes it very easy to identify the stick, as I can tell already from the weave it is not an actual MX3, but it is most likely a G3 stick which is a custom flex profile that is similar to the Nexus stick's construction.  But basically, the Bauer code goes as follows, the first line is going to be the 4 digit player code, if there is a dash the number after that is most likely changes in the curve, the second line will be the flex of the stick, the third line will be the stick code or what the stick construction is ie., G3, R32, A26, C, B, and so on.  Please take a picture of the nameplate and post in this thread and I or someone else can identify the stick for you."
hockeyplayers,3cz7vt,DicNavis,8,Sun Jul 12 03:06:04 2015 UTC,We're out of the game after 3 penalties. Maybe ask your rink management about implementing a rule like that?
hockeyplayers,3cz7vt,lostincbus,2,Sun Jul 12 03:59:29 2015 UTC,I thought USA Hockey rules were after 3 penalties you're out and a 1 game suspension. But if you're not playing in the U.S. Or not in a USA Hockey governed league I guess that wouldn't matter.
hockeyplayers,3cz7vt,willdesignforfood,2,Sun Jul 12 12:56:23 2015 UTC,"USA Hockey rules for adults are that you get tossed after five penalties, but with no subsequent discipline.

Of course, your rink can implement any rules it wants to, so this can obviously be tweaked."

hockeyplayers,3cz7vt,the_aarong,7,Sun Jul 12 23:24:28 2015 UTC,"I'll weigh in on this on the ref's side. I do mostly men's leagues in my area ranging from guys who just began playing to guys who played Jr. A to DI.   I definitely call games differently depending on the level I'm doing. The high level games I'll let guys get away with more, they've been playing at the level all their lives and can deal with it. If it gets out of hand, like a punch or a hard slash, yeah I'll step in. Penalties in the higher level leagues are definitely easier to call because the guys are obviously better skaters and it takes a lot for them to be thrown off balance.  The lower level leagues are some of the most boring games to do sometimes. A lot of the guys can't skate that well so a loose stick or a small bump going into the corners can knock them off balance causing them to look at me for a call, which they won't get. If guys start pushing in the corners like they're going to fight, I'll let it go for a little bit and just give them a yell, if they don't stop then I'll give them 2.   A lot of what you're describing isn't a ref problem, but a league problem. Yeah, maybe the ref will miss a call or let some stuff go but we can't kick someone out after a few penalties, that's a league rule."
hockeyplayers,3cz7vt,Edinto,1 point,Sun Jul 12 15:47:50 2015 UTC,"I think what pissed me off the most about being hit from behind was seeing the guy play, he was obviously a good enough skater that he wasn't going to accidentally run into me because he couldn't stop.  Do you find yourself assessing penalties and determining intent based on the quality of the player at times?"
hockeyplayers,3cz7vt,Edinto,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:16:37 2015 UTC,"The only thing I could think of happening is either the ref didn't think there was intent on the hit (For example, accidentally bumping a guy going into the corner) or him just being sick of the game and losing interest (We've all been there). We do take notice to guys that are playing as ringers but I'll never call someone for being too good or too bad."
hockeyplayers,3cz7vt,Jag94,3,Sun Jul 12 16:25:33 2015 UTC,"""It's 10:00pm beer league hockey""... is the response someone gives on the bench when we sit there watching guys ""being assholes"" on the ice, and the refs not calling it.    It happens all the damn time... and I agree, its frustrating.  I'm seriously considering setting up a couple of GoPro cameras before the game and recording the games.  It is amazing what people get away with during these games.  And the only thing we can assume is that its late, and the refs want to go home.  So the less whistles they blow, the faster the game ends.  Seriously.    In our last game, I had a guy on my team get taken down by the cage on his helmet... like a ""facemask"" play in football.  No call on the play.  The guys on the bench were so dumbfounded that we were speechless.  When we asked the ref why he didn't call anything, we couldn't get a straight answer.  I understand if he didn't see it (which from his positioning on the play would have been impossible unless he was staring at the clock and not actually watching the game), but it actually scares me if he did see it, and didn't think it was worthy of a call.    My entire life I have never been one to argue with refs.  Never.  In fact, I usually get pissed when guys start talking back and yelling at refs.  But recently, it almost seems like its not even worth them showing up for the games.  It's gotten that bad."
hockeyplayers,3cz7vt,Jag94,3,Sun Jul 12 08:22:27 2015 UTC,"I don't expect them to call hooking or tripping or even offsides and icing if it's close, but when they don't give a shit about dangerous plays, that's when it crosses the line.  When it comes to the guys being an asshole, I don't understand why they wouldn't just toss him so they wouldn't have to deal with him any longer."
hockeyplayers,3cz7vt,GibsonLP86,1 point,Sun Jul 12 13:18:31 2015 UTC,"My thoughts exactly.   I wonder if the refs are very lenient in hopes that we will police ourselves. You know? Like, ""hey, we arent gonna call a lot of the little stuff cause we think youre adults and have respect for each other"". If thats the case, fine, im all for it, but they are letting too much go, and its getting down right dangerous.   And the crazy thing is, i got called for interference when i lifted a guys stick who was in front of the net, and about to take a shot off a rebound, and he lost his balance and fell over. When the ref blew the whistle i was baffled that i was given the penalty. They are terribly inconsistent."
hockeyplayers,3cz7vt,rjmaggie,3,Sun Jul 12 15:19:10 2015 UTC,"It doesn't get any better. I played travel my whole life, in college, and some minor pro skirtings as well. Generally when I'm on the ice, I'm the best, if not one of the better players.   Refs will be refs. Any jersey I wear more than a season or two will have cuts on the arms and my gloves will have stress on them from hooks.   Best thing, is to make friends with the refs. Go chat with them a bit, and be their 'friend' so when things happen to you, they'll be more inclined to call penalties on them."
hockeyplayers,3cz7vt,xzzy,2,Sun Jul 12 17:28:12 2015 UTC,"Have your team manager write the league about problem players. In my experience this gets passed down to the refs who deal with it as they see fit, usually a chat with the player before the game and if their behaviour keeps up they get a lot less leeway."
hockeyplayers,3cz7vt,Gibson19,2,Sun Jul 12 03:42:01 2015 UTC,"It could just be your rink, the places I skate the refs generally call the game fairly and liberally hand out 5/10 minute penalties to people who get too far out of line. Your options are to let it go or ask your captain to bring it up with the league commissioner or the rink's head ref.  There's really no benefit to dwelling on it, you don't know what the ref did or didn't see, they did eventually make a call, so within the game itself there's not much you can do. Just try to fix it later."
hockeyplayers,3cz7vt,Skyline_BNR34,2,Sun Jul 12 03:45:19 2015 UTC,"I got boarded once and when politely asking the ref why it wasn't called he said ""The games almost over and I'm pitching a no hitter"".   So then I asked him ""Can I do the same thing then?"" and he said as long as I don't go too crazy.   I couldn't believe it. I do know the ref fairly well, so maybe he knew I wasn't actually gonna do anything, but still.   I have noticed a stark difference in playing at the higher levels vs lower. The refs have to put more effort into controlling the higher levels since a lot of those guys have played contact at one point and in general the game is more physical. Not to mention if they are just coasting on the ice they'll miss a lot of goal calls, offsides, etc.. In the lower leagues I find the refs just glide around thinking they can catch things. I remember one championship game when 3 times, a shot from my team trickled through the goalie and into the net, but each time the whistle was blown as soon as the goalie got a piece of it."
hockeyplayers,3cz7vt,nealoc187,1 point,Sun Jul 12 13:42:02 2015 UTC,You need to talk to your hockey director at the rink about the refs not doing their job.  We've had refs that called our games not be brought back because of the amount of complaints they got from teams.  Also have someone record the game so you have proof of the refs sucking.

hockeyplayers,3cy7j7,kingofthediamond,3,Sun Jul 12 02:26:20 2015 UTC,"If you're wanting a stick for off ice practice or ball hockey (I.e. on Concrete) make sure you get a stick with an ABS blade. Wood blades will chip and crack and become unusable in no time. You can get a one piece wood stick with an ABS blade or go for a composite shaft with an ABS blade. I'd recommend the second, which is what I use. Might be a little bit more expensive but worth it. Will feel more like your stick on ice (assuming you use composite) and when the blade breaks breaks down you can just buy a new one and pop it in."

Recently I've been shooting inside my garage with sponge pucks with my real sticks, taped up and water on the floor with the slick paint is pretty decent, but obviously not a lot of space to pass with a friend or anything like that."

hockeyplayers,3cy3ip,Chuckxpie,3,Sat Jul 11 20:42:15 2015 UTC,Just get some practice and don't feel embarrassed because you're a beginner. I think a lot of beginners are worried about going to stick and puck or doing certain maneuvers if there's advanced players around. As someone who's been playing for 20 years I can assure you that no one is judging you whatsoever. We all have to start somewhere and I always admire a beginner player who gets out there and tries his best to improve. Good luck and have fun! It's a hell of a fun sport.

hockeyplayers,3cvps0,IndyJonesy,9,Sat Jul 11 04:17:13 2015 UTC,"Just comes with practice is what I would say. But to be more helpful then that, go to open skates and just practice going on the weak foot. Try going every other, that is strong foot then weak foot over and over. Try to translate what you do on the strong side over to the weak side.  It just takes repetition and confidence in it to be able to do it as second nature in a game. It just takes time and patience and will consist of falling down many times. Don't worry about it and just keep practicing is basically the key and you will get the hang of it soon."

hockeyplayers,3cvps0,TwoMinuteMinor,10,Sat Jul 11 06:10:59 2015 UTC,"If you started playing hockey as a kid,  then probably not.  Coaches usually work to ensure you develop stopping and turning both ways evenly. I know I do.   But if you start playing as an adult, you end up playing games much more than practicing, and in games you will tend to use the most comfortable way far more often. Of course public skating sessions that always seem to go counter-clockwise around the rink don't help,  either. The result is usually a strong/dominant side and a weak side for crossovers and stopping."
hockeyplayers,3cvps0,kingofthediamond,3,Sat Jul 11 14:01:02 2015 UTC,Try to make every stop on your left side. If you are already comfortable with one side than you will be less likely to use your weaker side. The more you use the left side the more comfortable you will be and eventually it will even out and you will be great on both sides.
hockeyplayers,3cvps0,uberla92,3,Sat Jul 11 06:06:30 2015 UTC,Try slowly shaving off ice like you're about to snowplow stop with your weak foot. Find the sweet spot where you can stop then put your weight on it. The key is keeping the strong foot straight and turning the other foot. Once you master the snow plow just throw your hip. It'll take a while but practice makes perfect.
hockeyplayers,3cvps0,bspec,3,Sat Jul 11 15:33:59 2015 UTC,"The two biggest things I see with new skaters trying to learn to stop on their weak side is that 1) they don't take the time to start with the snow place and work their way up from there to a real stop. And 2) they're too flat footed on their weak side, with not enough of their weight on the ball of their foot, which of course leads to them eating ice a lot more often."
hockeyplayers,3cvps0,dat_meng,2,Sat Jul 11 15:59:51 2015 UTC,"It's more ankle strength than foot strength. You just have to keep practicing and force yourself to stop on your weak side.   My advice is to do suicides. Great drill for working on conditioning, explosiveness and of course stopping."
hockeyplayers,3cvps0,1966mopar,2,Sat Jul 11 17:19:24 2015 UTC,"best way I've found to this was to start when your blades aren't as sharp, and then tend to trust the blade more as it'll shave more than snow plow.  It'll help with confidence when going for the hard stop."
hockeyplayers,3cvps0,bravochar,2,Sat Jul 11 18:56:36 2015 UTC,I sort of have the same problem. I can stop on my weak side just not so good. What I've been doing is playing my off position. I feel comfortable on rw but force myself to play lw. I just tell myself when I go in the corner to slow down a bit so I can stop. If you force yourself to do it you have no choice but to get better.
hockeyplayers,3cvps0,DaaaBears91,1 point,Sat Jul 11 22:32:25 2015 UTC,"It really helped me to break stopping back into its component parts to bring my weak side up to snuff. Go to an open skate and work on stopping using the inside edge of your weak foot while gliding on the other skate, just turning your skate toe-in in front of you to stop. After a session of this, I'm now stronger stopping on my left, formerly weak, side because I'm better at bringing my right, strong side, skate in to help with its outside edge.  All of the suggestions so far have been great, so the most important thing is to practice it. If you're not purposefully working to make something better, you'll never improve. Even just a few minutes every game, practice, skate, or whatever will start to add up."
hockeyplayers,3cvps0,Dandry420,1 point,Sat Jul 11 12:55:19 2015 UTC,"Work on the edges of your weak foot as much as you can.  Once you are very comfortable crossing over on it and doing sharp turns on it, you are ready to stop on it."

hockeyplayers,3ctkpm,Crazytrain8,11,Fri Jul 10 17:44:31 2015 UTC,Will try to post a picture later. Hockey rink is at the bottom of a chinese and middle eastern resturant. It's literally in there basement. If you take the wrong door you end up in a rub and tug joing. You have to hang your bags before you play unless you want to take a mouse or rat home.  Couple weeks ago a pipe broke in a change room the mantiance guy came in said yea it's leaking and just left. We moved to our second change room which these change rooms are super small. After are pick up game the water had reached our change room. But luckly since everyone hangs up there bag no damage was done.   You are better to park across the street because the under ground garage's room crumbles often. The ice is like a pond after the zamboni and the bottom of the boards are all wavy and broken. Good luck taking a shower because the water is ice cold. Also if we play there in the winter you pretty much wear you jacket or a big sweater until you are completely changed because they don't believe in heat.  We only play here in the summer as it is closer for summer pick up. In the winter we play at a big beatiful arena for shinny. But we slum it for the summer shinny

hockeyplayers,3ctkpm,Fragninja,2,Fri Jul 10 21:29:27 2015 UTC,"I can't post a picture because the rink is closed for the summer, but holy shit is one of my rinks a piece of shit.   It's literally a rink that had a metal shed built around it. There's one, moveable metal bleacher with 3 rows to sit on behind the home net and that's it. There's maybe 2 feet along the sides of the rink, and you can't even access one side unless you're on the bench. And there's no locker rooms, just curtains on the ceiling (like a hospital)  The metal support beams drip rusty water from the ceiling which forms ~2 inch diameter/1 inch height bumps on the ice  The benches are missing rubber in spots, and you step on wood that is basically rotting to pieces.  There's even roped off corners when you come in, cause the rink itself is basically just a rectangle with boards built on top of the ice, so there's ice patches in the corners.   And the best part is if you try to wheel hard around the home net, good fucking luck cause the ice by the zamboni door is so bad even an NHLer would probably eat shit   It's a shithole, but I grew up playing there basically every weekend so it's aight. Luckily it's one of 3 rinks in my town of 20k, so it's not the only place I play at"

It's fucking dangerous to go on that side of the rink. The ice hardly ever freezes after a Zam in the summer and it is very small, but it is ice in this shitty town I'm currently in until I get back to the Raleigh area.  I'll try and get pics of the end board area on monday after some pickup hockey."

It's also got some of the worst zamboni doors that I've come across.  They don't fully close, have some ugly gaps in them, and there have been a couple nights were you don't even have ice against the boards, just concrete underneath.  All the regular guys know to never go hard in that area, or you'll either snap your stick, shred your blades, or end up outside the rink."

The way it sits makes you feel like a gladiator though. The rink is about 15 feet down from food court level with glass around the top so people look down to watch."

Every week i tell myself im gonna do it, and every week im pissed at myself for being lazy and not waking up for it.  As for your gear, there are two products that you can benefit from, and theyre both cheap.  #1. Air fresheners. Seriously. With your windows closed the whole day, you need something to kill the odor. Some are better than others. The ones with the little beads do a really good job of killing odor causing bacteria. Like these... http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B00RD982MO/ref=mp_s_a_1_1?qid=1436559447&sr=1-1&pi=AC_SX110_SY165_QL70  2. They make solar powered fans that clip onto the top of a slightly open car window. The sun powers it, so as long as it is daytime, that fan will be circulating. This will really help keep the hockey gear odor from setting in, plus in the summer, it helps keep the interior of your car a little cooler."

hockeyplayers,3ct4l5,Fisticuffs13,2,Fri Jul 10 16:40:13 2015 UTC,Exactly this. Bergeron is using Reebok 4-rolls rebranded/stitched over as CCMs and the palms have been stitched over tons of times. Lots of the Rangers guys have an added protective layer stitched onto the top of the hand too.
hockeyplayers,3ct4l5,TJSimpson10,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:09:06 2015 UTC,"Bergeron's (outer) Reebok equipment has been rebranded as CCM because Reebok/CCM (owned by Adidas) has phased Reebok out of hockey entirely, save their poster boy Crosby and their bargain bin Canadian Tire stuff. This is why ALL sticks, gloves, skates, and helmets are CCM-branded now, not just Bergeron."
hockeyplayers,3ct4l5,Fisticuffs13,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:48:57 2015 UTC,"Yep, same as Bauer did with Nike stuff a few years back. Bergeron was just the first guy I really noticed it on and I was surprised they'd rebrand his gloves like that rather than him just choosing a new CCM pair, but I guess he's picky when it comes to that."
hockeyplayers,3ct4l5,TJSimpson10,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:19:14 2015 UTC,"Well, Datsyuk and Kronwall and a lot of guys did the same thing. That style glove has a more modular/free cuff so I wouldn't be surprised if their equipment guys just swapped them out.  Because they switched in the middle of the season, some guys wouldn't wanna break in a new pair of gloves, regardless of the fact that they're the same exact gloves with different branding. I get it.  IIRC NikeBauer added the swoosh in the summer, so their next models got new branding rather than a mid-season shift. That made it much more noticeable unless you're a gear whore."
hockeyplayers,3ct4l5,Fisticuffs13,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:56:34 2015 UTC,"Yep, definitely makes sense. Same with rebranding the Reebok helmets like a lot of guys did.  Didn't know the timeline for when Nike did it exactly but yeah, would definitely stand out more that way."

Before I got into hockey I was a powerlifter and would sometimes take those but the effect would wear off after an hour or so.  At one point I was taking 3 scoops of DS Craze and benching 405 clean but I could never sleep.  It's been over a year I haven't taken anything like that or any caffeine.  On Wednesday, we had a substitute coach and he was a hardcore guy from Canada (as opposed to our surfer laid back coach we usually have) He was having us do this obstacle course for tight turns down the ice and forward swizzle back about 5 times then tight turns one legged and backward swizzle back 5 times then hockey stop at each cone and forward swizzle back for the rest of the class.    I was dead tired after that and could barely walk. I told the coach I've been on the ice since 11AM and he said ""yeah I wouldn't do that"" lol  I ended up sleeping almost 14 hours the next day from exhaustion."

I'm really trying as hard as possible to get better and better.  I know I'm already older but I want to do everything I can to turn this into a career, not just a hobby.  Also I'm not skating every single minute of that time, I do rest on the bench and drink water for a little while before going back out there.  I'm just trying to build enough stamina to be able to play a full 60 minutes without needing a rest."
hockeyplayers,3ctq7i,somethinggangster,3,Fri Jul 10 18:57:10 2015 UTC,Is there any way to space out the skating some more? More days of fewer hours on the ice would probably be ideal.   Being overly exhausted while trying to learn proper skating mechanics is probably not going to help you improve any faster.   What sort of career around hockey are you aiming for?
hockeyplayers,3ctq7i,goofygrin,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:34:24 2015 UTC,The rink does offer a lot of public skate and stick times. How many hours would be ideal to match what I'm doing now?    I am doing everything I can to get as good as possible to try out for the fhl and echl. If that doesn't work out coaching would be something I can fall back on.

For a team that was thrown together at the last second with a bunch of guys that have never played together before, and to factor in the we played teams that had much more class than we did, we came together awesomely. At first we looked like a bunch of dirtbags but after game 3 i was proud to play with those guys.   We took 4th overall and for the record, I posted an empty netter that would have sent the game into overtime in our last game, so this time we didnt get to blame it all on tendy.."

Not much of a hockey community that I'm aware of but I have been told that people from Tucson will drive up to this ice rink in Tempe or the Ice Den in Chandler. It's a good hour and a half drive at least to Chandler and a little further to Tempe. They are trying to build a rink in Marana but I haven't heard much about it lately. I don't think there's enough support behind it unfortunately."

I have a new, unused one ready on the side for when the first one finally goes, but it looks like it'll be collecting dust for a bit.  The brand new one I haven't registered yet, but I will before I use it and at that point there's a great warranty on it; none of this 30 days after purchase stuff from regular stores. It's 90 days or whatever after I register.  Larry, the guy who runs the show there, is a beauty as well. Great customer service and just a solid dude who has a passion for the game.

hockeyplayers,3ctdc9,BrunooSardine,3,Fri Jul 10 16:50:41 2015 UTC,"If your lead foot isn't straight then you're wasting energy because you aren't transferring the energy from the push in the direction you want to go.    As you get better having your lead foot pointing the wrong way will be a good way to lose your balance especially of you catch a rut in the ice.   While it may seem easier to keep your balance this way it will hurt you on the long run. When you're taking a stride make sure your chin, shoulders and knee are in a vertical line with each other to keep your core balanced. Then after you push off, bring your trailing foot back to center before you push off with the other foot.  Your feet will need to be shoulder width apart but facing forwards.  This way you can maximize your forward glide while giving you the balance and stability for your next push off."
hockeyplayers,3ctdc9,seckzy,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:13:23 2015 UTC,"Perhaps it's just an issue of balance at this point, but I just found it awkward to bring the pushing foot back and then try to turn the gliding foot over to then push off. Many times I found the blade / wheels would just catch and try to then roll diagonally and almost make my legs split."
hockeyplayers,3ctdc9,seckzy,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:18:46 2015 UTC,When you are bringing your pushing foot back straight you need to shift your weight to that foot before you push off with the other foot. If you end up not correctly balanced you'll end up trying to do the splits.   Basically you're shifting your weight back and forth over the leg that is facing forward. Also keep your knees bent as if you were trying to sit on a stool.  It sounds like you're standing too upright and its throwing your balance backwards and outwards.
hockeyplayers,3ctdc9,Jag94,2,Fri Jul 10 21:10:04 2015 UTC,"I've been playing ice and roller hockey for 15+ years. One thing I really wanted to chime in here and caution you on is that it is really easy to be lazy on roller hockey skates. Make sure you have a nice knee bend and power stance at all times, because if you develop that habit on roller hockey skates, it's a really hard habit to break once you et on ice.   I'd even argue that it's the number one thing besides stopping that people who want to transition from roller to ice end up struggling with."

I feel like there is somewhat more of a following than average as far as Texas cities go. Also a lot of people here who have moved from up north who play. It's a small community, but it feels pretty tight knit and non judgmental. Outside of the rink though, people usually think I'm strange for being into and playing hockey as I'm a native Texan. I absolutely hate football, I'm not very good at being Texan. Ice quality seems to vary throughout the year, especially when it gets really hot outside. I'd assume it's more expensive to play down here, $15 for a drop in game or stick and puck and $300-500 for a beer league season.

We have 3 divisions here for 18+'s, two non checking, one checking, and theres about 10 ish teams per division usually, and they usually fill up pretty well as far as i can tell. Ice time is pretty damn expensive, i mean even a public skate with your own skates is $17 at the rink i usually go to, playing in the leagues costs a lot too. I dont have my own car yet (licenses take ages to get in Aus, i only passed fairly recently and im 18!), so i take public transport there and back, 2 and a half hours each way, its pretty brutal haha. I dont really have anything to compare it to, but i always find the ice pretty good, no major problems, only sometimes lumps of ice build up over time on the surface because of condensation dripping from the roof! It costs a heap to get gear over here, because its such a niche market, it costs quite a lot, you can expect to pay $300 extra at least for top end skates. No difference in the rules as far as i can tell, and i think the culture is pretty good! Because the sport is quite small here a lot of people know each other, so i enjoy it. Only problem is outside of this niche basically no one has even heard of hockey (or ice hockey as most people would call it here), so theres that."
hockeyplayers,3cregw,frosty_biscuits,3,Fri Jul 10 12:35:03 2015 UTC,"I just moved from the Albany, NY area back to where I grew up near VA Beach. Ice time is about twice the cost in VA compared to NY. I pay $10 for basic stick and pucks which only last about an hour, $10 free skate, $12 pick ups. They can charge this because there are maybe three rinks within a 60 mile radius. It's really hard to find gear. Basically I have to go online or to Play It Again. The talent isn't as deep so I actually have more fun in VA as I can be much competitive with the average joe. Problem with that is that I developed really fast around the NY talent and in VA I won't be pushed to get better quite as quickly. There's not a huge hockey culture and you don't see other players around town much. BUT the guys who do play love it so much and it's like a small fraternity in the area.   One note on ice condition from just last night. I wish I had taken a picture but I usually don't bring my phone in with me. There was a cloud of fog over the entire rink that I went to. You could barely see from one end to the other. We ended up splitting the ice and putting nets on the half wall. It was terrible. The same building has another surface with much better air circulation, but there are drops from the ceiling so golf ball sized bumps grow rapidly on the ice surface and can really screw with you. I'll chop them down when I get to them but they grow back very quickly. It's downright dangerous."

hockeyplayers,3cregw,orionthefisherman,2,Fri Jul 10 13:34:51 2015 UTC,"Live in northwest Ohio, which is sort of a non traditional market. We have a Ncaa d1 team and a ECHL team and a few decent youth programs, but none of the smaller or mid sized towns have rinks. I have to drive any where from 30 min to an hour to play. Its definitely an oddity to be a adult hockey player here. Sticks and pucks/shinny is 5-10$, league games average 15-20per. Gear is kind of tough to find, only one good shop plus Dick's and Dunham's. Have to drive about an hour and a half to Ann Arbor for a really good store (I hate buying online)."
hockeyplayers,3cregw,VSK85,2,Fri Jul 10 13:41:40 2015 UTC,"-Where do you live?  Norfolk/VA Beach, VA  -How many people show up to games?  Depends on what time of day the game is. Afternoon games are usually 10-15 guys, whereas Friday and Saturday night games can range anywhere from 10-40.  -How expensive is ice time? $10-12 for pick up games $8-10 for stick and puck  -How far away are you from the closest rink? 15-20 minutes  -How is the ice quality? Pretty decent. Occasionally at one of the smaller rinks the ice will get pretty soft during the summer.  -How much does it cost do get gear? There aren't really any proshops in the area, so I usually end up getting my gear from Play It Again Sports or Online. Surprisingly new equipment at Play It Again is pretty close to the online retailers.  -Are there any differences in the rules? Not that I'm aware of.  -What is different about ""hockey culture"" in your area? I have played hockey here and in Maryland and there is no difference between them. As for the difference in those two places versus the rest of the country, i'm not so sure. That being said, this is a big military town (largest Naval base in the world) so we have transplants from all over the country, which is pretty cool."

We're at the same latitude as the hockey hotbeds in MN, WS, and the NE, but kids don't grow up playing hockey--it's all football and basketball around here.  We do have an adult league with 4 divisions.  The upper two tend to be transplants--people who moved here as adults but grew up playing hockey as kids in other areas.  The lower two divisions are people who have learned as adults.  Each division has 4-5 teams of 10-13 skaters.  We typically have 10-25 people show up for the more popular drop-ins.  A 2-month league session (Fall is Nov-Dec, spring is mid-Jan -Mar) is $140.  Drop-in and Stick/puck is $10.  Ice costs $120/hr at the outdoor rink (5mi from me), $150+ at the indoor one (18mi away) depending on time of day.  -Ice quality is quite good.  Outdoor one dependent on weather.  -One tiny local hockey store with part-time hours.  Nearest full-service LHS is 2h away.  3 PIA's 2h, 5h, and 8h away.  -Because of the number of transplants from the NE and Canada, no real difference in the rules.  -Hockey culture is intimate.  Everyone knows everybody else.  Very inclusive, and welcoming to new players at the lower levels.  People chirp only in fun, play isn't too chippy, people who play excessively physical are frowned upon, physical but friendly play is the norm."
hockeyplayers,3cregw,RDC123,2,Fri Jul 10 15:15:29 2015 UTC,"This isn't current, but I spent some time in Australia (a decade ago, which makes me feel so old) and played around the Sydney area. A lot of differences.  Crowds varied, usually nobody but our final series pulled in a couple hundred I'd guess.  Rinks were few and far between obviously, but not all that bad given that it's not a hockey country and back then really had next to no hockey culture. The ice was terrible at some rinks, not bad at others. I shipped my gear down, so didn't have to buy anything there but everything was expensive. I had family bring down tubes of tape rather than pay the insane prices.  The biggest difference, and this isn't the case in most rinks now AFAIK, was the lack of glass on the boards. Instead they used netting. Getting tight to the boards to receive a hit in my first game and getting bent over into the net did not feel good at all. Also didn't love the 'off the glass' clearance turning into 'off the net to the slot'. Hard to get used to that one. I did once dump a guy back into the net to the point that he got caught up like a tuna during a scrum after the whistle. That was entertaining.  One of the best times playing hockey I've ever had though. The people were awesome."

Public skate is $10  Stick time is $10 Pick up hockey is $15 10 week hockey class is $195  How far away are you from the closest rink?  There are four rinks that are close to me, I've been to only two, both about 20 minutes away.  How is the ice quality?  One of the rinks is really shitty, the other is a lot better maintained.  How much does it cost do get gear?  It cost me about $1,000 to get all my gear including skates.  Are there any differences in the rules?  I'm not sure if this is normal or not but it struck me as odd the first time I saw it.  The clock runs down during division games even during faceoffs.  The clock doesn't stop after it starts basically.  What is different about ""hockey culture"" in your area?  It has gotten a lot bigger for one thing since the kings won the cup back in 2012 and 2014. Our rinks don't have showers, just changing rooms with no lockers so not a lot of locker talk goes on. Most public skates consist of little kids who like to stop right in front of you when you're going 20 mph down the ice, but then again you probably shouldn't go that fast during a public skate."

Several Rinks in the downtown area and scattered throughout northern Utah.  Ice Quality is pretty good considering it is summer time.   Gear is about $1k all said and done.   Difference in Rules?

We've got a somewhat decent ice skating rink, owing to the fact that is the practice facility for the Greenville Road Warriors, but the ice got pretty shitty in the past few months. Currently the rink is down for maintenance until the middle of August so our summer league didn't run too long this season.  Cost wise it's about 8 bucks for public skate, 10 for stick time and 12 for pickup games. Goalies play for free of course. We've got a fairly decent pro shop near the rink which carries mid level gear. I think my full kit cost me about 600 to get started with everything.  Our league is no-check around here, which I guess is pretty standard for rec leagues. We run 17 minute periods with running clocks, which I wish was different, but I can understand since we only have 1 ice rink and 3 different skill divisions playing. Most of the players are from Northern states who have moved down for jobs in Greenville. I think I'm one of the few native Southerners that plays in the rec league. Everybody is pretty cool though, we all get together for a beer or two out in the parking lot outside of the rink after games."

I might as well answer my own question even though it isn't an untraditional market.  I live in Southern NY. The one thing that is strange here is the cost of ice time, it is VERY EXPENSIVE. Stick and puck costs $30, as do the open hockey sessions. I sometimes play at the Islanders former practice facility (as an NYR fan it's pretty tough) and the ice is surprisingly shitty. They use the old zams from the Coliseum, which are pretty worn out. I only started playing recently, so I'm still learning about the ""hockey culture"" around here, but it seems that hockey is pretty unpopular in my area. I'm a native New Yorker, but I lived in Michigan for a while, where hockey is massively popular. I wish I had stated playing there, but I'm still having a great time learning how to play here in NY. I'm about 4 months in now and I couldn't be happier with my experience so far."

Equipment I believe is the same price across the country largely. The quality is great. There's always those assholes on the ice but for the most part the people there are nice quality people."

That's a good foundation for plyo. Reps wise, do about 8-10 (or however many so the last 3 are straining ones), and do 3 sets.

I wasn't able to find skates or insoles that magically worked for me. You'll probably do what I did and end up getting wide skates, baking them, and having problem areas punched out. This will only help a little. People with normal feet will tell you that if your feet still hurt, then you need different skates.  False. Flat feet will hurt. For a month or two you will wonder how people stand still in skates for more than a minute or two.   However, the good news is they will break in nicely. Your foot muscles will start doing their job better. You will toughen up. You'll figure out that the laces don't need to be tight until you get to the ankle area. It will be worth it.   P.S.

hockeyplayers,3cq4p1,wiseaus_stunt_double,2,Thu Jul 9 21:45:17 2015 UTC,"LS3 is the same height as LS4, just a different grade of steel and slightly more rockered profile.  LS4 was semi-recalled because it was cracking too much, but should be back on the shelves in August."
hockeyplayers,3cq4p1,stevegcook,2,Thu Jul 9 21:48:27 2015 UTC,Bauer's website says that both are 10' radius profile.
hockeyplayers,3cq4p1,mthockeydad,3,Thu Jul 9 22:53:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you're right.  I was thinking of LS2/Fusion which are 9."
hockeyplayers,3cq4p1,stevegcook,2,Thu Jul 9 23:03:43 2015 UTC,That doesn't mean anything in terms of height of steel though.  That is the area for the blade to be on the ice.  Here is a website that has information on what radius profiles mean.
hockeyplayers,3cq4p1,Skyline_BNR34,2,Thu Jul 9 22:56:41 2015 UTC,"stevegcock noted that the ""LS3 is the same height as LS4"", just a different grade of steel.  I know what radius profile means.  I was commenting on his note that they had a more rockered profile.  Bauer's website shows them the same 10' radius.  He then struck-through ""slightly more rockered profile"" sometime after my post.  If LS3 and LS4 have the same height of steel, then they have the SAME HEIGHT OF STEEL! If they have the same radius and same height, the only possible difference in shape is in the toe/heel.  There is the minute possibility that they have a different pitch, but it is more likely that Bauer would leave that up to the end user and a hockey shop to modify."
hockeyplayers,3cq4p1,mthockeydad,2,Fri Jul 10 15:05:17 2015 UTC,I'm sorry. I thought you implied the radius was would make a height difference. Didn't realize you were responding to him about the radius.
hockeyplayers,3cq4p1,Skyline_BNR34,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:14:32 2015 UTC,"Okay, I thought the LS4 was 1/8"" taller than the LS3.  Maybe, that's in relation to LS2.  I'll pick up LS3 runners then; at least I'll be able to test out the rocker on the LS3s, and see if I prefer that profile.  Thanks."
hockeyplayers,3cq4p1,stevegcook,3,Thu Jul 9 21:56:04 2015 UTC,"I was actually wrong about the profile, just went back and checked.  Both LS3 and 4 are 10' while LS2 and Fusion are 9'.  And yeah, that's in relation to the standard height steel, while 3 and 4 are both taller by the same amount."
hockeyplayers,3cq4p1,mthockeydad,2,Thu Jul 9 23:05:18 2015 UTC,Bauer wouldn't license/allow Step to offer their runners in the Edge profile.    My guess is the LS4 is their effort to offer a Step-type higher quality steel in the taller LS3 shape.
hockeyplayers,3cq4p1,stevegcook,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:07:30 2015 UTC,"If the profile is the same, and LS4 steel will be available in August, I suppose I can wait until then.  Thanks for the help."
hockeyplayers,3cq4p1,Fisticuffs13,2,Thu Jul 9 23:14:06 2015 UTC,Hopefully august!  That's what Bauer told me when I emailed them about a replacement set for mine.
hockeyplayers,3cq4p1,Fisticuffs13,2,Fri Jul 10 02:45:02 2015 UTC,Might also be worth your time looking into Step steel. I've used their stuff on my APX2s pretty much since I've had them (when they were first released) and have had zero issues and haven't had to replace the steel. Solid product.
hockeyplayers,3cpja1,kedvaledrummer,2,Thu Jul 9 19:11:11 2015 UTC,Don't cheap out on skates trust me. I got the nexus 5000 because they were the cheapest to play in and I was too antsy in my pantsy to save for better skates. Now that I'm a competent skater I kind of wish I went for better skates because they're built to last and I'll be stuck with these for a while since I'm not flushed with cash.
hockeyplayers,3cpja1,fastest_sloth,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:45:24 2015 UTC,"That's why I was looking at slightly older skates, because then I can get higher quality for the same money."
hockeyplayers,3cpja1,fastest_sloth,2,Thu Jul 9 21:56:15 2015 UTC,"Right sorry, to answer your question: yes I think you should go with the x70."
hockeyplayers,3cpja1,Vuronov,2,Thu Jul 9 23:24:48 2015 UTC,"I'm bot an expert on Bauer skates, but just looking at hockey monkey, the X500's are $199 new. The X70's are currently $149 but were $319 when they were the current model. The X60 looks like it was $199 when it was new too.  Just going off of that, and what I know about how pricing between new and old models is like for the brands I actually do use, it seems like the X70 is a much better skate than either the X500 or X60.  Personally, if they all fit you well (which is the most important factor when buying skates), I'd go for the X70. Assuming you stick with hockey and keep improving, you may appreciate having better skates as you progress and might not need to upgrade as soon.  Just my 2 cents, others may have better advice then me about Bauers."
hockeyplayers,3cpja1,Vuronov,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:03:41 2015 UTC,"That's basically what I figured. I just wanted to be sure that I understood it correctly. It seems like I can actually get better skates that way, for slightly cheaper, which is fantastic."
hockeyplayers,3cpja1,somethinggangster,2,Thu Jul 9 22:05:56 2015 UTC,"That's how it works for all hockey equipment. I never buy the current model stuff, way too pricey for at best a minor improvement usually.  The real deals are in buying the slightly older model stuff.  You can get the top of the line stuff from the previous model (usually only a year or at most 2 years old) for the same as the mid-price current model stuff.  This is especially good when it comes to buying sticks. A current top of the line stick can run $250, meanwhile the same quality stick from the previous model might only be $150."
hockeyplayers,3cpja1,Vuronov,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:14:02 2015 UTC,I'm definitely used to that from snowboarding. I've never been one to care about having this year's stuff. I love getting quality stuff for cheap!
hockeyplayers,3cpja1,bthompson04,2,Fri Jul 10 02:28:38 2015 UTC,"Skates are probably the second most important piece of equipment you can get (first would be the helmet). If you are done growing, get the absolute best pair you can afford. The protection the higher up models offer is amazing and they should last you a fairly long time. Better to buy more expensive skate now then having to replace them in 2 or 3 years."
hockeyplayers,3cpja1,Hurricane_Viking,3,Thu Jul 9 22:40:20 2015 UTC,"I definitely agree with this with one caveat.   If you are totally new to hockey and not entirely sure you'll like it or be able to keep playing, it might be better to try to get a cheap pair of second hand skates if your local pro shop has any. Better to drop $50 (sometimes a lot less) to try out hockey than drop $250+ and later find out you didn't like it or can't continue to play.  That aside, if you're committed, then definitely get a quality pair of skates, but as a new player with beginner skating skills, don't go for the top of the line skate. They tend to be way too stiff for a new skater to be able to use effectively.  And as for helmets, get whatever fits your head best. Fit is #1."

hockeyplayers,3cow4a,camrivy17,2,Thu Jul 9 16:19:39 2015 UTC,"I learned I had flat feet after a few times on the ice, and I had the same issue. The pain was akin to standing on a steel rod for hours. I also tried the yellow Super Feet inserts which claimed to help the issue, but I found they had HARD arch support just like the rest. I went to a reputable skate shop and they recommended these red EASTON brand inserts for flat feet, they fit in my Bauer skates perfectly, and they instantly relieved the pain. If I were you I would visit a shop and see what they can do for you. This is a common problem."
hockeyplayers,3cow4a,smxfirehawk,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:20:05 2015 UTC,I have bauer nexus 6000 size 9.5 D and they're a perfect fit. You might have to cut them since you have a smaller size. I have the ccm low insoles
hockeyplayers,3cow4a,uberla92,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:24:31 2015 UTC,Great thanks! Would you definitely recommend them for flat feet?
hockeyplayers,3cow4a,uberla92,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:38:35 2015 UTC,They are definitely good but only if you're willing to shell out $50. I heard the superfeet brand are good as well but a lot cheaper.
hockeyplayers,3cow4a,Vuronov,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:23:04 2015 UTC,I wear Easton Mako skates and use the CCM insoles for flat feet and they work great. You may have to trim them some but overall if you get the right size it shouldn't be a huge issue.

hockeyplayers,3cor9d,mthockeydad,2,Thu Jul 9 16:10:02 2015 UTC,I'd suggest the CCM Ultra Tacks stuff right now for shins and elbow pads (I am not positive on how good the chest is yet as I haven't taken a puck there yet).  Here is my on-going review of them. I love them and the shins and the elbows are the best I have ever used.  http://modsquadhockey.com/forums/index.php/topic/68188-ccm-ultra-tacks-protective/
hockeyplayers,3cor9d,CanadianBobert,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:01:25 2015 UTC,"I just got a pair of Ultra Tacks elbow pads, they work great -- first elbows I've owned that actually stay in place.  Shins wouldn't fit around my fat calves though.  :(  I also bought the lower-end pants (4052) and they're... pretty mediocre.  Wish I would've went up to the 6052 for the inner belt, they don't stay in place all that well."
hockeyplayers,3cor9d,esdfowns,1 point,Fri Jul 10 07:44:16 2015 UTC,How big are you and what size shins did you get? For the first time ever the straps on my shins are actually a good length with these.
hockeyplayers,3cor9d,CanadianBobert,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:03:45 2015 UTC,"I am 5'7"" but I have short legs, and generally prefer to wear 13"" shins.  The straps did fit, but not super comfortably.  14"" would've been fine (but I would probably have to tuck my tongue, and ew.  :P)  Ended up getting the CCM RBZ 130 shins which work great for me; the cross-strap means I don't need to wrap anything around my calves, which I find to be pretty nice."
hockeyplayers,3cor9d,esdfowns,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:55:35 2015 UTC,"Get the Bauer nxg pads, they're the old top of the lines and you can get them for relatively cheap now."
hockeyplayers,3cor9d,Psychotic_Ninja,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:52:19 2015 UTC,"I've used the Bauer Supreme NXG shins, some high-end Easton stuff, and both brands for pants and can safely say that in terms of fit/comfort nothing beats the CCM RBZ line for shins and elbows. I use old-style Sherwood shoulder pads that do the trick, and am still sort of in search of a good pant and am currently checking out CCM stuff and deciding between the Tacks and RBZ....Tacks has a bit more protection, but it's 1 lbs. heavier. I typically play forward but I do block a lot of shots as well and muck it up, and the RBZ stuff has never failed me yet.  Either way, I'd say try some stuff on and see what fits you well since everyone is different, and maybe look into some skate fenders as well."
hockeyplayers,3cor9d,Fisticuffs13,2,Thu Jul 9 18:00:32 2015 UTC,"I just bought the CCM 6052 pants, and i love em. They have great padding in all the right areas, they fit really well, and i dont notice any restrictions or extra weight. For the price, i think theyre great."
hockeyplayers,3cor9d,Jag94,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:47:22 2015 UTC,"Good to hear. I figured a pound extra is negligible really for the legs, but was looking for mobility kinda. My only issue is sizing. I'm 6'3"" or so and 210 lbs. so I fit a Large alright on the waist, but the length is a bit short. Not sure if XL would be too much."
hockeyplayers,3cor9d,Fisticuffs13,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:22:30 2015 UTC,"Best thing to do is find a shop and try a bunch of pants on. Thats what i did.   When you put em on, run around the store. Seriously. This will give you an idea of what it will be like to skate with them on. Run with high knees.   Also, most, if not all pants now have zippers on the inside of the legs that will allow you to have a longer stride while you skate, and wont restrict you... But will keep the pants where they should be and provide ample protection."
hockeyplayers,3cor9d,Jag94,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:21:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I picked up a pair and tried them at home with my shinpads on to see how it all lined up and it seemed short, even with the 1"" extension zipper around the waist undone. Everything else felt fine. That was a size Large, so I had to try and track down an XL to see how those feel, which is a pain because literally only one store within a 100km radius has them in stock."
hockeyplayers,3cor9d,Fisticuffs13,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:17:03 2015 UTC,"That sucks.  Another option, which I've done before, is order from an online retailer, and get multiple sizes.  Then just return the ones that don't fit.  Most retailers offer free/easy returns."

hockeyplayers,3cmb4g,rjmaggie,6,Thu Jul 9 02:17:39 2015 UTC,"If there is organization, then it is completely doable.   Have different people organize different aspects. One person can reach out to hotels, one person can reach out to arenas.   Have locals organize any festivities outside of the gaming (like if there was a big party or bbq or get together or something  Have another person be in charge of confirming rosters and check ins for games, and schedule etc.  I realize it's a super ambitious idea, and likely very expensive. But if this is an annual thing, we can learn from the first year, and see how it works. But it is definitely doable."
hockeyplayers,3cmb4g,domoarigatodrloboto,5,Thu Jul 9 02:24:18 2015 UTC,"I think this would be a great idea, but only after we've been doing the Cup for a few years.  For the inaugural tournament, it's going to be hard enough just to nail down the very basics. We still need a confirmed venue and date, and even then we still need to get people to show up. As excited as some people seem about this idea, I'm thinking we're gonna have a hard time getting enough skaters to have more than 4 or 5 teams. Hosting a 30-team tournament would be a giant leap from what we have now and it's just way too complicated for the initial tournament, but once we do this a few times and get a system in place, it'll be much more realistic."
hockeyplayers,3cmb4g,domoarigatodrloboto,3,Thu Jul 9 13:09:29 2015 UTC,That's kind of why I thought using each teams subreddit would be a good way to get players rather than through /r/hockeyplayers
hockeyplayers,3cmb4g,domoarigatodrloboto,2,Thu Jul 9 13:46:37 2015 UTC,"I’m not disagreeing with your method, I’m more disagreeing with our own ability to handle the massive influx of new people. Your method of breaking things down by subreddit would definitely make things easier, but 30 teams is a LOT of people and even if each team takes care of their own travel and lodgings, I just think we’d be overwhelmed with handling registrations, scheduling, ice times, making sure teams are balanced, etc. Again, in a few years when we’re a little more experienced and have a better system in place, I’d be first in line to make this happen, but I think it would be far too difficult for a first go-round."
hockeyplayers,3cmb4g,RDC123,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:42:30 2015 UTC,"I agree it would be super difficult to organize, and I realize that. I definitely agree it would be easier to do one or two regular ways instead of doing it this way first time round. But if there is enough support, why not do it this way? Obviously there will be hiccups, and we can't expect everything to go smoothly.  I don't think its impossible, especially if we have enough preparation and think everything thoroughly."
hockeyplayers,3cmb4g,RDC123,3,Thu Jul 9 15:04:49 2015 UTC,"why not do it this way?   We're kind of stuck in a rut here: we shouldn't do it this way because we're not ready to handle it yet. I looked at some of your other comments and you mentioned bringing in sponsors and talking to NHL teams and TSN, and that's a great idea ONCE WE'VE BEEN DOING THIS FOR A FEW YEARS. Right now, we consist of a bunch of online beer leaguers saying ""hey we should meet up and put a tournament together."" We have little-to-no influence or power, and the odds of getting anyone to support us are slim. Bauer's not going to sponsor some random assortment of average Joes. However if we start hosting this tournament every year (as I really hope we can), then in a few years we can go to the major companies and say ""Hey, look, this is an annual tournament that's been around for a few years and draws in players from across the country (and even internationally). It's a great sponsorship opportunity and it'll even allow you to connect with your audience in-person."" That is a much more convincing argument.  So for like the zillionth time, I love your ideas, but they're just not ready yet."
hockeyplayers,3cmb4g,RDC123,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:34:24 2015 UTC,"Well I'd argue we have a lot more power than you think. We have one of the biggest online hockey communities out there in /r/hockey, that gives us a huge marketing tool. We have some of the best single team communities on the Internet with each individual subreddit. If you're able to use this type of power to your advantage then we will get support from some big companies.   I agree it's not going to be easier the first few years we do it, but nothing is ever easy. There are members in this community who I'm sure have the necessary skills to assist in this tournament, people with the required skills and experience who would want to help.  Not everything that is big has to start out small."

hockeyplayers,3cmb4g,wiseaus_stunt_double,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:49:03 2015 UTC,"I realize it will have problems, even an 8 team tournament is going to have problems.  But with enough community support and help, anything is possible. Preparation and thoroughness will help.  I'm not saying I have the experience, but I've been apart of hockey tournaments before, been involved and know the basics. I know how to promote hockey related stuff as this was my job at one point. I've played in enough tournaments in my life time that I know how they work.  Obviously I know this is a big task, but if the community gets behind it, it will be a lot easier than you think."
hockeyplayers,3cmb4g,wiseaus_stunt_double,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:54:23 2015 UTC,"The community will get behind it when you demonstrate that it's a real thing worth supporting. Rallying 30 teams from across the continent to a tournament with absolutely zero track record seems virtually impossible. Personally I'd never sign up for something like that. However, I'd probably consider a smaller tournament if it was nearby, or a large tournament that could point to a few well run previous tournaments. You're asking people to make an investment of time and money, you need to show them something that will make them want to do that.  It's a cool idea, it just needs to be approached realistically if you actually want to do it."
hockeyplayers,3cmb4g,wiseaus_stunt_double,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:57:37 2015 UTC,"I understand what you're saying. However big tournaments with teams from all over the continent happen all the time. A nearby tournament would obviously be preferable for everyone, no one wants to spend a lot of money or time on anything. However if we want this community to be able to play hockey together then the community is going to have to do this regardless.   We've already got a guy with USA Hockey connections, I've got someone at Hockey Canada who I'm going to talk to. This is within the realm of possibility.   Look, I'm willing to put in the time and effort to make this happen. Or at least rally for the support of the community. I completely understand if you have doubts, but I'm really confident in my abilities, and this idea."
hockeyplayers,3cmb4g,wiseaus_stunt_double,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:37:36 2015 UTC,"I have some experience with tourneys, and running leagues etc. As I'm sure many people in here do. I think someone mentioned getting some representatives from each team - to essentially play a captain role - would be a great start. And of course finding a city to play in. To aim for next summer would be doable - ice tends to be cheaper then to save on some costs. To start small would be a good idea too - even 4 teams in a cheap rink - three games a piece- your looking at a couple grand. Then ref fees on top of that."
hockeyplayers,3cmb4g,RichieCski,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:59:09 2015 UTC,"Three games really isn't that expensive. Here where I'm from you can rent a sheet of ice for an hour for between $80 and $120. I'd imagine we could get a bulk discount too for getting so much ice in the off season. Not to mention the cost doesn't stay too high when you consider the fact that it gets spread out over both teams.   Refs however I have no idea the cost of.   Yeah, the representative/captain idea is a great idea. I'd be willing to represent the habs. We have a decent community here on reddit, so I imagine that we wouldn't have a problem getting together a full team."
hockeyplayers,3cmb4g,funkyb,2,Thu Jul 9 18:03:55 2015 UTC,"I think this is a better idea.  I remember a while back, those of us on /r/losangeleskings and /r/AnaheimDucks were going to have games against each other's subs, and we had more than plenty to field three teams each side divided by skill level.  Maybe, we can schedule a regional tournament based on NHL divisions, and then have a frozen four in St. Louis or wherever."
hockeyplayers,3cmb4g,funkyb,2,Thu Jul 9 21:28:41 2015 UTC,"That's a fantastic idea, and I personally would love it.  Edit: The only problem I can see with that is how many teams would actually want to make two trips in a year for hockey. Unless we simply did the smaller tournaments within the same city."

I mentioned in my above comment that when our subs were planning this out, we had more than enough players for three teams, covering three different skill levels, and I would imagine every NHL sub could do the same."
hockeyplayers,3cmb4g,Nicholasagn,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:03:27 2015 UTC,"Well this tournament isn't garuanteed yet, the Reddit Cup was originally someone else's idea, and I don't want to high jack this tournament from him.  But I'd imagine having different skill level teams for this would be very difficult, my personal opinion is that we should limit the skill on each team. Only have a certain amount of high skilled and new players on each team.  If there was enough support for B teams, I'd be willing to try and make it work. But like I said, I don't know how we could make that work. Maybe have different tournaments too? We'd have to see how many players from each subreddit are willing to make the journey too."
hockeyplayers,3cmb4g,Nicholasagn,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:13:21 2015 UTC,"That's true -- it's a lot easier to commit to playing if the game's down the road as opposed to having to travel for it.  BTW, do you have a link to the original post about this?"

hockeyplayers,3cmb4g,RichieCski,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:22:09 2015 UTC,"Just saw the edit.  That's possible to have it some place with a ton of rinks, but we'll need to have someone organize getting the rink time.  The best place to have this is in Vancouver since they have 8 Rinks in Burnaby and then they have a bunch of smaller rinks peppered throughout the Vancouver Metro.  Ice rental is relatively cheap, too -- $125 CAD to rent ice time at 8 Rinks for an hour if I remember.  I don't know what ice rental time is other places, but it starts around $300 USD here in LA."
hockeyplayers,3cmb4g,doth_thou_even_hoist,2,Thu Jul 9 22:35:00 2015 UTC,"You mean 1 hour for one pad for 125 right? That's a pretty good price. I'd imagine we could get a bulk discount too. Ouch $300 is expensive as shit. Vancouver would be a great place to do it I think. Ottawa has a lot of ice pads too, not sure the cost though. Peterborough is a pretty small city, but has 5 ice pads locally that are all a decent price. As for other places I'm not sure, that would take a lot of consideration, and discussion amongst the community."
hockeyplayers,3cmb4g,e46fan,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:38:52 2015 UTC,"Right -- $125 for the entire sheet of ice for an hour.  On top of that, 8 Rinks is the perfect venue since they have 8 sheets and will have at least 5 available to rent out at one time.  CORRECTION: it looks like prices have gone up at 8 Rinks to $200-$250 CAD, although it was $125 when I was up in Vancouver during New Year's.  Maybe, the new prices are priced for summer.  Who knows..."
hockeyplayers,3cmb4g,golfer_1993,2,Thu Jul 9 22:50:42 2015 UTC,It would still be worth contacting them to see if there is a discount when booking so many ice times.   But best not to get ahead of ourselves. Let's make sure people are on board with this first.

hockeyplayers,3cl47p,somewhat_random,10,Wed Jul 8 19:37:39 2015 UTC,Any chance he knew your goalie? If I have friends on the other team I will go over to their side during warm-up to talk to them and if the goalie is a friend I could see taking a shot.

hockeyplayers,3cm594,mulvda,2,Wed Jul 8 23:57:09 2015 UTC,"I was in the same boat as you until recently. I think the general consensus is work up from a snowplough stop, although I had more luck with doing 'half'-snowplough (no idea if that's the correct name for it) to begin with. It's where you put your weight on the foot furthest back, and let the front blade shave the ice if that makes sense? Most people would recommend How to Hockey's videos, and I like Hockey Tutorial's videos on stopping also. Really though, the thing that helped me most was going for skating lessons rather than muddling around on my own, which might be something to consider :)."
hockeyplayers,3cm594,breadwinger,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:42:19 2015 UTC,"going for skating lessons   As with pretty much every sport this is so key.  having personal instruction from someone who knows what they're doing can not only let you progress more quickly, but will keep you from forming debilitating bad habits."
hockeyplayers,3cm594,funkyb,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:30:09 2015 UTC,"I would try and do a ton of edgework drills, both inside and outside edges. Ive been skating for about 6 months now, once or twice a week so we're fairly close there, and for me I saw by far the biggest improvement in just about everything when I started really starting to learn my edges. In terms of hockey stops, you need to have a good feel for both your inside and outside edges to get both feet to cooperate as you said. When i first launched into trying to learn to hockey stop, it was not pretty. I left it for a while to go work on other stuff (edges being a big focus), and when i came back, it was so much easier, even though id never actually worked on it specifically. Also, edges help in basically everything; quick starts, crossovers, stopping, so there's no reason not to work on them!  This is a really good video with a ton of different edges drills https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubJzSM5Iy2w , also check out howtohockey.com as im sure lots of other people will have recommended.  Im very much a beginner same as you I'm guessing, but if I was going to go for a rough progression I'd say work on,   Inside edges Shaving the ice with your inside edges (so you can stop properly with one foot) Outside edges Hockey Stops   Again, im very much a beginner still but I hope that helps!"

hockeyplayers,3cj03x,weeoohrescue,5,Wed Jul 8 07:50:07 2015 UTC,"If there's any way you can see sticks in person at a hockey shop, it is your best bet.   You want to know what handedness you should play as? First thing you need to know is your top hand will be doing all the work when stick handling. The bottom hand is just a stabilizer. Use whichever handedness forces you to use your top hand to stick handle.  Now on to stick material. Wood is being phased out, and it is completely unlike composite sticks in most aspects. It is heavier, has a different kickpoint, and you need to shoot differently. link link2 ABS is a very durable material that is generally used for outdoor uses. I would not suggest it for ice hockey.  Curve is all preference. I don't believe any curve will give you better stick handling or shooting, it has to work with how you play. For example, I use one of the flattest blades there is (Easton E4) and can't stick handle with a blade any more curved than that. I would suggest going for a basic mid-curve pattern so it's not extremely flat or wickedly curved.  Flex is a pretty preference based thing too. While you are 265 pounds, you also probably don't have shot mechanics down. I would suggest a stick in the 90 or 100 flex, but this is something I stress you should really see in person because I do not know how strong you are.  I understand you want to save money, but hockey isn't exactly a cheap sport. The cheaper the equipment is, the quicker you will be to wanting to replace it."
hockeyplayers,3cj03x,69dickmasterj,2,Wed Jul 8 08:59:44 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the input.  I understand hockey can get expensive and fast.  The reason I'd like to stay inexpensive is that if I find I don't like a particular aspect of the stick, I can replace it easily.  Would you still recommend starting with a composite stick?"
hockeyplayers,3cj03x,Nicholasagn,2,Wed Jul 8 10:34:16 2015 UTC,"http://www.hockeymonkey.com/blade-pattern-chart.html  You can use that as a rough guide. It doesnt have every curve. For instance my curve is a E36 on a V53 i got on the cheap.  http://www.hockeymonkey.com/blade-pattern-chart.html I think i got it a bit cheaper than that honestly.  I cant say for sure that this is the right stick for you. The curve was listed to be described in the average of everything, and i like it so far.   As long as you go for a stick with the right flex and doesnt have an insane curve i think you will be fine"
hockeyplayers,3cj03x,kingofthediamond,3,Wed Jul 8 14:59:07 2015 UTC,"First off hockey is not a cheap sport and even though you are a beginner, you have to make a commitment. I would highly recommend that you not use a wood stick. With your weight, if you lean on the stick too hard you're going to snap it. Composites can take much more punishment than wood can. You can still find some great composites for around $30 on clearance.   Will you be playing on ice or roller?  In terms of handedness, I would go with what your most comfortable. If you want to be a better stick handler go with that hand, and the power will come in time.  There is no right or wrong answer.  I also recommend that you check out my website where you can learn all about sticks, flex, curves, and much much more."
hockeyplayers,3cj03x,mc3022,2,Wed Jul 8 13:19:21 2015 UTC,"Welcome to one of the best decisions that you've ever made. Although I'm relatively new to the sport as well (playing for about 8 months) I can almost guarantee you that you'll have a blast  I'm 6'0 about 260 as well so we're right around the same boat. I don't have many recommendations for your price range as others below will prbly be more knowledgable. I went upper middle class (if there is such a thing) on my skates, helmet, and stick - most because I wanted to learn on the same skates and stick and not have to switch them once I got better.  I agree that going to the local hockey shop is your best move for a stick and skates especially. For a reference, I have a Warrior DT1LT stick that I found for about $100 on sale. I use a Zetterberg curve (or W88/Patty Kane curve) which is a good starting curve for most. As for the flex, I use an 85 which is a bit low for our weight but again, its all on preference.   for the handedness, I would put both feel together and fall backwards - whichever foot stops your fall is usually your dominant hand (right foot right hand, etc.) if your right foot stops your fall i'd try a lefty shot, but again its all going to be what feels most natural to you as well - the guys at the shop can help you out.  Hope this helps - however, i'd highly suggest you learn to skate first before you do anything hockey related."
hockeyplayers,3cj03x,funkyb,2,Wed Jul 8 18:35:48 2015 UTC,"So if this were still in stock I'd say it's perfect for you.  Maybe watch to see if it comes back in the future.  they'll often honor requests too (type of curve, grip v. no grip, etc.)  Anyway, let's address your points.   Low cost/wood: wood sticks may seem to be the cheaper option but they aren't necessarily.  They'll chip and break sooner than composites and as others have mentioned they feel different than composite sticks so you'd be relearning when you eventually got one.  They're also fucking heavy.  Just check hockey stores and online sites (hockey monkey, hockey giant, peranis hockey world, total hockey, pure hockey, etc.) for clearance sticks.  You can find them for $40-50 and they'll last ore than twice as long as wood sticks.  Getting two at some point is a good idea, though.  Always nice to have a backup.  Two-piece sticks, with a composite or aluminum shaft and replaceable blades used to be an often used alternative but within the past 10 years or so composite stick prices have come down so much two-piece sticks are pretty near obsolete.  I've only got one because it's my old one from college and I occasionally pop an ABS blade into it for street hockey. Generally in Canada righties shoot left and lefties shoot right.  In the US we do the opposite.  Go with the Canadian method if both ways feel good.  As others have said, having your dominant hand on top makes stick handling much easier.  You can learn either way so don't feel like there's a ""wrong"" choice.  Just go with what feels natural.  As a bonus if you go lefty: in US stores you'll have a lot more choice since everyone's buying the righty sticks. Curve: very much a personal preference thing.  I'd stay away from any extremes when starting out and go for some sort of mid curve.  as with many other things, Jeremy has a very good writeup on it Flex: some recommend starting off at lower flex of 75-85 but you're a bigger dude so you cna go higher.  Generally you go about 1/2 your weight but if you're stronger go stiffer (higher flex) and if you've got little girl arms like me then go softer (lower flex).  Pick something between 85-100 to start out. Length: yeah at 6'1"" you'll probably b alright with most uncut sticks.  If you need to cut them use a hacksaw or circular saw, nothing special there.  If you need a longer stick they do sell extensions"
hockeyplayers,3cj03x,goofygrin,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:57:30 2015 UTC,"Just started, but I have the same issues as you. I've bought three sticks. I weight 240 and am 5'11""  Buy used from the local community or resale shop. I've spent $80 on the three I've bought.   I first bought  right handed as I'm righty at everything else, with a lot of power (golf, 300+ drives, ended 18 with a GPS indicated 353 last weekend), but I couldn't handle the puck at all nor did I feel confident stick checking.   Bought an 87 flex, lefty stick and felt immediately better, but shooting still feels a bit weird.   Last weekend,  I bought a 65 flex, used reebok high end sick from a couple years ago. My shot speed has gone up and I feel more confident and its lighter.   All that said, the standard says I should be using a 100 flex, but until I get better form, the lighter flex is easier and gives my more confidence."
hockeyplayers,3cieib,JumbledPileOfPerson,3,Wed Jul 8 03:44:35 2015 UTC,They're probably a tad behind with the holiday weekend and the big sale. Give 'em another day then call them. Or shoot them an e-mail and ask! Don't fret to much either way. It'll all be worked out in the end.

Since long distance phone calls are costly via landline/cell (me coming from the Philippines and you coming from Australia), just tell them you're unable to call them and give them your number and they'll call you right away.  They'll be asking for proof of billing, credit card bills, electricity bills, billing of the phone you're using, identification and other shit then they'll process it right away.

I know they have that policy outlined on their website but I have a few friends that have ordered big brand stuff from Hockey Monkey without having to use a parcel forwarding company. They told me that they only say they won't ship here for legal reasons but they still do it. Now I'm worried. Maybe it depends on who packs the order and some people just get lucky?"

Im honestly surprised they'd do that, I bet they'd be in serious trouble if they got found out for that haha! It might depend on who processes it as you said, maybe it depends on the total price of your order if they stop it or not, who knows. Definitely check again to make sure absolutely all of your details are right, even down to stuff like putting international and area codes on your phone number, that may make a difference, because if its a 'high value order' as mine was, they'll likely stop it going through if there's the slightest problem."

It should be the primary focus of your individual progression for a while to come.  Not to say that things like stickwork aren't important too, but everything will be significantly easier if you can skate well.  Learn your edges, learn to stop on either foot, learn how to transition without losing speed, learn to generate speed in crossovers, etc..  And it can be a phenomenal workout (just as much core as legs.  If you want to round it out, you can drop and bust out some pushups between drills).  /u/howtohockeydotcom probably has some videos of drills that you can do for these things.  And the things you learn about your skating during the session will be fresh in your mind for the games."
hockeyplayers,3chded,Jag94,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:20:16 2015 UTC,This is outstanding advice.  I was going to say the same thing.  Being a good skater is priority number 1.  Everything else follows.

hockeyplayers,3chs9u,postpaintboyy,3,Wed Jul 8 00:35:27 2015 UTC,"When I broke my fibula right above the ankle, I was off my skates for about 6 months even though they put in a plate and screws to set the bone. I started back to the ice by just going to some public skate sessions and worked on getting a feel for being on skates again and to start building up my legs as well. Took me about five or six sessions to start feeling comfortable again, although a lot of it was overcoming the fear of snagging an edge and getting hurt again.   Fast forward three years and it was determined that the hardware in my leg is causing other problems and it has to come out. So, here we go again. I'm 55 days into another six month stint off the ice after they took the hardware out. This time the concern is that the bone is perforated from the s few holes and my surgeon wants to make certain that the holes fill in before he releases me back to games.   I'll probably go back via the same routine as last time when I get cleared. Public skate, skills/drills sessions, then games.   Sorry you have to deal with this man, it sucks."
hockeyplayers,3chs9u,LesDujoix,3,Wed Jul 8 03:52:10 2015 UTC,"Agh this bums me out! I broke my fibula too, but don't know if I'll need surgery yet. I just don't want have to deal with surgery and physical therapy again. I broke my elbow 3 years ago and I've never regained full range of motion.  Oh well, I did it once before I guess I can do it again!"
hockeyplayers,3chs9u,LesDujoix,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:57:27 2015 UTC,"Let's hope your news is better than mine was and you don't end up needing surgery. I will say this though regarding injuries to joints. After having two ankle surgeries and a rebuilt rotator cuff I have learned to just suck it up and do the physical therapy. Joints can permanently lose range of motion each day they aren't rehabbed while healing is what I was told when my shoulder was done. I did the PT and still lost 8% range of motion so who knows what it would have been if I hadn't done it. PT is boring, tedious, and painful but it's better than the alternative.   Best wishes to you on getting better news!  *edit, Spelling"
hockeyplayers,3chs9u,cdrwork,2,Wed Jul 8 04:04:35 2015 UTC,"Do your PT like a madman.  Yeah it sucks and is boring but it works.  I have broken my ankle twice.  The first time I slacked on the PT and had a really crappy recovery with limited range of motion.  I learned my lesson the 2nd time even though the break was worse (had 2 screws installed).  I did all my PT and then some and the recovery was much smoother.  Once you have recovered a bit start going to open skates just to get your ""ice legs"" back.  I was able to skate and play ahead of what my doctor said but I would play it safe.  It sucks not being able to play but just concentrate on doing what you can to help your recovery instead of getting too depressed."
hockeyplayers,3ci6is,sheadog,2,Wed Jul 8 02:34:31 2015 UTC,"Sounds like you've played enough hockey to know basic defense, but here are some of my tips I give to guys just starting out playing inline d. Whether it helps them, I have no idea.   Control the gap. ""Match"" your opponent's speed (going slightly slower so the gap between you and him slowly decreases). Keep your stick arm slightly bent in front of you. While entering the zone, the puck-carrier is assessing how much space and time they have before they make a move or shoot. As the gap decreases and the the puck comes within range, straighten your arm and poke the puck away. You can straighten your arm much faster than they can pull the puck away. The few inches of extra range can be quite deceiving. Make them commit to an action around the top of the faceoff circles. My take is if they take a shot, IMO most goalies (without traffic in front of them) should be able to stop most non-slapshots from above the circle. If they make a move, see next tip. Once entering the defensive zone, bait/give them the outside by cheating slightly to the middle. By going outside, they are limiting their shot chances to bad angles. With any speed, it is difficult to carry the puck hard around the outside and come back in front (where you'll be already because you're already going straight back). When entering the zone, if the puck-carrier cuts along the zone line, he often looking to find a shooting lane by getting some space between you and him. Try and cut across with him and get the blade of your stick up close to his blade. If he attempts the shot, you'll send it over the glass. I find following the puck-carrier when he makes the cut quite challenging, which is why it helps to have forwards that properly backcheck. Backchecking prevents them from cutting across the middle as the end up bringing the puck right to the backchecker. Watch and react to their hips. The hips will move depending on whatever action they are going to take. You really can't fake with your hips.   That's about all the  tips I have off the top of my head."
hockeyplayers,3ci6is,PizzaHockeyGolf,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:27:51 2015 UTC,Honestly roller hockey defense is awesome and sucks at the same time.  You gotta try and get the guy to go wide and take a bad shot.  If he goes inside you need a good poke check to knock the puck off.   What I do is just try to stay in front of the guy and if at all possible get him outside.  You could stop skating and let the guy skate into you. That shouldn't be called since he ran into you.  But in reality you are really handcuffed defensively in what you are allowed to do.  Its great because you get the vision of the whole rink and end to end rushes are fun.
hockeyplayers,3ci6is,PizzaHockeyGolf,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:28:52 2015 UTC,"It blows. I also play D for my roller team and half the time I'm thinking if this was ice that wouldn't have happened.  Quick poke check, good positioning, and quick feet. Thats all you can do. I like to poke check right as they shoot or right before they start their deke.  I tends to work pretty well."
hockeyplayers,3ci6is,FilmNerdasaurus,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:37:48 2015 UTC,Don't stop. I did that once guy carrying puck ran into me I got called for interference and got knocked on my ass. Most players don't wear full padding so it's also dangerous play
hockeyplayers,3ci6is,slorebath,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:46:29 2015 UTC,"Just have to be super good with your stick and feet. I've played at a high level and I've always felt better, since I can't play the body, presenting the player with the puck opportunities where I feel comfortable. I'd rather they try to walk me than let them just take a shot. The average roller player will go for the move over the smart play. Use that to your advantage, play them to your strengths then capitalize on them thinking they can beat you."
hockeyplayers,3ci6is,FilmNerdasaurus,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:28:49 2015 UTC,I play in a league with no offsides. It's a speedster and dangling. dream. Best I seen is to just stick with them and don't let them pass or get a clean shot

hockeyplayers,3cgzpy,Nicholasagn,3,Tue Jul 7 20:58:50 2015 UTC,"Make sure when you finally learn to stop, that you know how to stop facing both ways, because that will then be used for transitioning from forwards to backwards"
hockeyplayers,3cgzpy,master_swaggins,2,Wed Jul 8 03:31:46 2015 UTC,"Yea, i know its important. I can get to the rink about 45 mins early and get the ice to myself so i can get some extra time in for myself. My right leg is considerably more dominant so that will be something ill need to focus on."
hockeyplayers,3cgzpy,Ineedsomethingtodo,2,Wed Jul 8 12:15:25 2015 UTC,"Plus it's incredibly helpful in boards battles. How do I know? Cause I still can't do a full speed hockey stop to my left side. It's hurt me in boards battles a ton. Unfortunately I've never really gotten time to practice enough it because in the summer, the only ice time available in MD is my games."
hockeyplayers,3cgzpy,funkyb,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:53:00 2015 UTC,"I played roller hockey from 13-22 before I picked up ice and in roller I stop predominantly on my left side.  I'm 29 now, having played ice almost exclusively since 22, and I still can't stop well on my left side on ice skates.  I just seem totally unable to unlearn that unconscious motor function."
hockeyplayers,3cgzpy,hisroyalnastiness,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:31:48 2015 UTC,"I went to my first real practice last week and it went about the same.  I can go pretty good and stop both ways it's details like  backwards crossovers and fast transitions that I need to work on.  I was so excited to be doing proper drills that I went way too hard, by the time scrimmage came around I could barely move.  I was on with beginners and could outskate them but only for the first 20 seconds of every shift, after that I was manning our blue line sucking wind. :/"

hockeyplayers,3cgbll,nick92675,4,Tue Jul 7 18:12:34 2015 UTC,"Try to point your blade at your target on the follow through. For longer passes you'll have to put more oomph behind it, but never shoot the pass, just sail it to them harder, follow through, and point for a second. Anticipate where they will be in 2-3 strides and pass there, not to where they are currently - you'll end up passing it behind them or at their feet.   May be good or bad advice. It's how I was taught when I was younger and it helped me out a lot. I became pretty good at dishing out some nice passes."
hockeyplayers,3cgbll,TheFuckNameYouWant,3,Tue Jul 7 19:27:46 2015 UTC,"Point your stick where you want to pass, make sure your head is up and looking where you want to go with it.  Then, spend some time figuring out where your feet are in relationship to the puck. If the puck is out in front of you it's hard to pass well. You want it closer to your back foot so you can transfer your weight as you pass and release. You may need to draw the puck back before releasing."
hockeyplayers,3cgbll,ANGR1ST,2,Tue Jul 7 19:33:44 2015 UTC,"To piggy back, how about receiving passes? I'm terrible at that"
hockeyplayers,3cgbll,fastest_sloth,2,Tue Jul 7 22:43:54 2015 UTC,"One easy ""trick"" when receiving hard passes is to loosen or let go the lower hand from the stick. Of course you should try to learn cradling the puck properly, but I sometimes see pros receiving hard passes to backhand by holding their stick only with upper hand, even if they could reach it without letting go."
hockeyplayers,3cgbll,teethblock,2,Wed Jul 8 16:39:42 2015 UTC,Pretend the puck is an egg.  That part of Mighty Ducks was legit.  You catch fragile things that you don't want to break all the time; think about how you do that differently than catching a baseball.
hockeyplayers,3cgbll,deadlyernest,1 point,Fri Jul 10 07:08:36 2015 UTC,Cradle the puck. Move your stick back and turn the blade down toward the ice as you receive it.
hockeyplayers,3cgbll,ANGR1ST,2,Tue Jul 7 23:06:23 2015 UTC,"Lots and lots of repeat, as said here. My two points are more of ""making awful passes just bad"". Hear me out:   HARD passes. Always. If theres more than couple of meters to target, pass like you're trying to shoot low corners. Often when playing you can pretty much tell players level by the speed of their passes. With harder passes, you dont need to aim so much front, dont get intercepted and most of all, dont look so stupid if missed. Pass rather too ahead of the player, than behind. No one has ever caught too slow pass behind, but if you put the puck too far ahead, your teammate can chase it down, or it can take a bounce off boards and end up to be decent.   So try to avoid the beginner pass; slow puck miles behind a teammate. Pardon my english."
hockeyplayers,3cgbll,teethblock,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:36:09 2015 UTC,"Try to ""see"" your pass. Look at their stick blade just as you are releasing the pass and as /u/thefucknameyouwant said follow through after you let the pass go and try to lead them so the pass isn't behind them or in their feet."

hockeyplayers,3cgbll,Bengerm77,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:45:38 2015 UTC,"Ah, scaredy-passes.  In addition to scaredy-shooting, and all scaredy plays, this can really only be solved by doing more of it.  Whenever I play with new guys or feel I'm out of my league, I will always make poor passes, decisions, etc.  Really the only thing that can correct this is repetition and confidence in yourself.  You know that you already know how to pass, there isn't some special secret you aren't getting, you just need to do more of them until you know that the puck is going exactly where you want it to go 99% of the time."
hockeyplayers,3cgbll,hisroyalnastiness,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:12:40 2015 UTC,"Did a lot better last night - lot of strong, accurate passes.   I focused a lot about being in the zone heading to the rink and made sure to follow through/point as suggested.     I also tried to hold the puck a little longer than my instinct said to make sure I had a clear intended target and follow through.   A friend once told me, you have more time than you think you do - which seemed to be good advice.  That said, the Tues night bunch isn't as good as the Thurs night crew - we'll see if I can keep the same level up with the better players."

Maybe I need to get a stride or two in first?

hockeyplayers,3cgv2r,ilikeitneat,1 point,Wed Jul 8 04:08:49 2015 UTC,"I've been buying gear recently too as a new ice player. One thing to note is the more money you spend the more protection you'll be getting.   There are two different pants set-ups: you have the common hockey pants (breezers), where it's sort of an all in one deal. Looser fitting, padding woven into the shell etc. Then there's a hockey girdle which is another style of pant, closer fitting, more like a compression style pants that are just pads and require a separate outer shell but usually they are sold as a combo.   It comes down to preference, I'm switching over from roller so I went with the girdle style because I'm used to the feel of that type of pant and like a closer more form fit. Personally my philosophy in this process has been to spend the extra $20-$40 it costs to get more protective pants as a new ice player. I just figure feeling confident if I fall that I won't get hurt will help me improve faster."

hockeyplayers,3cb7o4,Hurricane_Viking,2,Mon Jul 6 15:58:53 2015 UTC,Depending on the number of people that sign up we could easily have 1 practice/pick-up game type session to get a feel for where everyone is at skill wise. Assign a player a rating 1-5 and then split people up based on that to keep the teams mostly even.

hockeyplayers,3cb7o4,shelvedtopcheese,2,Tue Jul 7 16:59:51 2015 UTC,"I like where your going with that.  As well as making it something like you can only have so many of X amount of ""skilled"" players out on the ice at once.  Kind of like in a lot of coed softball leagues and basketball leagues where so many have to be girls on the court or the field.    But then we are bound to have sandbaggers, but hopefully with the general thoughts I get from here most here hate them so hopefully they won't have many."

hockeyplayers,3cdcwg,Kev13,11,Tue Jul 7 01:02:26 2015 UTC,I was playing in a tournament and I went in to the corner to battle for the puck.

I still shook his hand and i would have offered him a beer afterwards.   Yes he was a dick but off the ice the game is over. I would have just accepted their apology.
hockeyplayers,3cdcwg,kingofthediamond,5,Tue Jul 7 01:42:20 2015 UTC,I agree with this. I had a guy slash me so i grabbed his stick and pretended like i was going to throw it and he got pissed and later in the shift took a run at me and called me a few names. (he ended up getting a penalty hehe) But at the end of the game I shook his hand. Gotta be able to separate the game from life. I have no hard feelings about it.
hockeyplayers,3cdcwg,atguy07,4,Tue Jul 7 02:23:26 2015 UTC,I always respect guys who can separate the ice from the locker room. In real life I sometimes hold grudges but I have to remember that hockey is just a game. Its not worth getting hurt or kicked out for a stupid mistake. If you do something mean to me I may give you a cross check but then its over. I'm over it.
hockeyplayers,3cdcwg,kingofthediamond,15,Tue Jul 7 02:50:33 2015 UTC,"If you(or anyone else) is going to get mad and start throwing checks just because an opposing player is playing down a level or so, you might as well just quit now. It's commonplace in beer league hockey. It sucks, but unless your league polices t, it happens often. I know this isn't what you want to hear, but as frustrating as it is to play against a guy(or team) that is ""slumming"" it, you can't just go around checking people in a no check league. Nobody gets hurt by the guy who dangles around everyone (other than maybe your ego), but throwing a check or hitting someone is a rubbish move in a no check. Run your mouth at the gut because he is a clown for playing down, make him know he is a total douche. However, don't go try and hit him. It's a dumb move, and if something were to go wrong, you'll regret losing your cool."
hockeyplayers,3cdcwg,OzziePao13,6,Tue Jul 7 04:14:39 2015 UTC,"The best way to one up guys like that is to win. What exactly did you think was going to happen when you ""took the body"" in a non check league? Grow up."
hockeyplayers,3cdcwg,orionthefisherman,10,Tue Jul 7 12:42:43 2015 UTC,"Being cocky and good is not against the rules but deciding to check a player is.  You both got heated and started playing more physically than the league permits.  He got tossed, you got in the box.  I probably would have called it a day on this grudge and made a mental note about the way this guy handles stress."
hockeyplayers,3cdcwg,johnamoose413,4,Tue Jul 7 01:24:28 2015 UTC,"If you meant to bodycheck him, then you fucked up.  Simple as that.  You broke the rules and he made you pay physically for it, although I would've just given you a good shot every time we battled in the corner and not cross-checked you in the head.  If you just positioned your body in his way and he ran into you, I can see why he would get frustrated but in that case he was wrong.  In either case, I would've at least let him apologize.  You could choose to turn the music in your head way up, but at least show the courtesy of letting him try to right his wrongs."
hockeyplayers,3cdcwg,russharv9,4,Tue Jul 7 13:54:29 2015 UTC,"I kept it clean for the most part   No you didn't. You threw a check in a non-check league.

My first reaction, along with everyone else, was to jump the boards and beat his ass. Then he scores game winning shootout goal. Afterwards, a bunch of our teammates talked to the opposing team's captain and said stuff like ""we like playing against you guys, but that was not cool"" as a civil way to voice our dissaproval. The captain said he didn't know that guy did that and said he would talk with him. Fast forward one week... during tryouts for the next season, he injures his tailbone.

hockeyplayers,3cdcwg,insignia200,0,Tue Jul 7 13:57:50 2015 UTC,Situation after a game I had a couple weeks ago. Played this real chippy team but the goalie must of been on his period. I got crossed checked hard from behind into him by his own player. He proceeds to try and punch me in the face with his blocker while I'm defenceless on my back. Ref gives 2 minutes for cross checking and 4 minutes to the goalie for roughing. The goalie later in the game deliberately buttends me in the nose while I'm skating by giving me a bloody nose. He gets a penalty ref didn't kick him out for some reason though. When we were shaking hands after the game he goes to shake my hand I tell him to fuck off and I don't shake his hand. A player who crosses that line of respect and playing hard and goes to dirty and cheap in a mens league game doesn't deserve your respect or anything after the game.

hockeyplayers,3caxhe,Unicorn_Ranger,2,Mon Jul 6 14:42:07 2015 UTC,"I'd just get an ice hockey helmet now.  You can get gently used, but make sure it's actually gently used and fairly new.  You don't want to fuck around with protecting kiddos head, especially when she's just learning and will fall over a lot.  A (let's be honest, probably loosely tightened and poorly fit) bike helmet is a great way to have your kid crack her head on the ice and either get very hurt or get scared enough to quit.  Being well and properly padded up makes falling a lot less scary, and you have to be willing to fall to learn how to skate.  She should also get used to skating with a cage on as she'll be wearing one for the next 13 years at least.  It doesn't have to be expensive.  The bottom of the line from CCM, Easton, etc. will run you $30-40 on clearance.  No need for a $200 fancy helmet.  Just find one that's certified and that fits.  Don't get one of those mylec street hockey helmets, those aren't for someone actually learning to play on ice.  If you have a local hockey store around they can help you pick a helmet.  If you don't know if you have a local hockey store, ask the rink where she's going to be taking classes to direct you to one."
hockeyplayers,3caxhe,funkyb,2,Mon Jul 6 15:54:58 2015 UTC,"My 5 year old started skate lessons about 6 months ago. He bas a hockey helmet with full cage. Other kids had bike helmets and more than a few busted their faces on the ice when they fell face first. My son went down face first a couple times but was fine since he had a cage.   He also wears his hockey gloves to class. Too many kids with no control over their skates. With as much as they fall and using hands to get up, I was worried another kid would stomp on his fingers when he was getting back up."

He probably doesn't need a cage at this level but it gets him used to having one. Have her try on multiple helmets from different manufacturers to get a good fit! Their heads are so big compared to the rest of their body! Also I would recommend a helmet that has a quick adjust feature. Not sure how your kid is but trying to get my kid to sit and look straight while messing with screws to adjust would be a disaster!

Only approved hockey helmets with full cages. If your little one is learning to play hockey an approved hockey helmet is a must. If she's learning to skate then a bike helmet is sufficient. My other daughter figure skates and wears a skateboard helmet during her lessons.
hockeyplayers,3c8o81,Splashy17,12,Sun Jul 5 22:59:20 2015 UTC,"I'm British and even I got into playing hockey, so I'd imagine it'd be quite a breeze doing it in Chicago!  First thing's first, can you skate? If not, get yourself a pair of comfy skates (my first set cost me £80); it's insane how much of a difference they make. Learn to skate; take lessons and practice. You should be able to skate forwards; backwards; stop and perform crossovers effectively. It doesn't need to be perfect, nor does it need to be quick, but that's the most important thing!  Secondly, the rinks I've been to always offer a ""learn to play"" session for ice hockey. Ring around the local rinks and see what they offer. However, it's also possible that your local college team might also run a ""learn to play"" session; my one did, and that's how I got into it. A lot of the time, they'll lend you kit.  After a few sessions and if the passion is there, you should start acquiring kit. The chances are that you'll be able to get some second hand kit pretty easily, especially as you're going to be in a major hockey city.   However!!! You should ALWAYS buy a new helmet. Your helmet is perhaps THE most important bit of ice hockey equipment you'll ever buy; do NOT skimp out on it; invest and make sure it's comfortable. Ask yourself ""does it move as I move my head?"" ""Is it too tight on my temples?""   Following that, IMO, I'd say stick, shorts and gloves are the most important bits of kit, followed by shoulders, shins and elbows.  When you walk into the hockey shop, don't be ashamed of asking questions, the people there are used to it; they'll help you in any way you can.  If you can afford to splash out, get a decent pair of base layers. These are better (IMO) than wearing a gym t-shirt, as they're generally skintight and effectively which sweat away. However, that's personal preference and isn't really a necessity.   I hope this helps, buddy! When you first start, try to be flexible on which position you play, and try to try everywhere; then stick with what you're most comfortable with.  Furthermore, if you want to practice puck control at home, you might want to buy a puck and a strip of linoleum.  Best of luck! And I hope it all goes well!"

Make sure it's the correct size, but get a cheap one to begin with.  Shelling out £80+ on a twig will do nothing to improve your game at your level.

hockeyplayers,3c8o81,dropkik24,5,Mon Jul 6 14:28:42 2015 UTC,"Johnny's Ice House in Chicago has an adult instructional classes if you've never played before. Or there are many rinks in the surrounding suburbs that offer instructional classes if you have a car.  Playing hockey is a relatively expensive hobby though so be prepared to pay. You can get cheaper elbow pads, shoulder pads, and shin pads at any hockey shop (+/- $50 ea.) but skates are relatively expensive if you buy new (+/- $200 for bottom shelf skates) and I wouldn't recommend buying a cheap helmet. Fortunately, the pads last for awhile (depending on how hard and often you play) so they make for a good investment if you want to keep playing. However, if you know somebody who can lend you their hand-me-downs I would suggest that before buying anything just in case you don't like it (which I highly doubt).  Leagues are also relatively expensive. The league I play in in the suburbs is like $500 a session and I know that's very high. I don't think you can find a league for less than $200 in or around Chicago but I could be wrong.  I hope some of this helps, best of luck to you!"

hockeyplayers,3c8o81,Vargatron,2,Mon Jul 6 02:21:45 2015 UTC,Stick and pucks and pick ups. You'll start seeing the same group and get a feel for the different skill levels while honing your skills.
hockeyplayers,3c8o81,orionthefisherman,2,Mon Jul 6 00:53:52 2015 UTC,"Also, check if your school has club hockey! It's a great way to practice and learn from others."
hockeyplayers,3c8o81,insignia200,2,Mon Jul 6 05:33:00 2015 UTC,"I would go out to a hockey shop and get fitted for a good pair of skates. Be prepared to spend at least $200 bucks on the skates alone. While that sounds like a high price, anything cheaper will lack the necessary padding and protection to do you any good while playing hockey. Also look to pick up a cheap pair of knee and elbow pads, along with gloves and a helmet. Also, get a cage for your helmet, unless you want to develop a habit of spitting teeth. Get a $40 wooden stick and you'll be set. All told, you'll probably spend between $300-400 getting your initial gear. Of course you can start out with just the skates and buy each piece incrementally to fit your budget.  If there is a learn to skate program available in your area, sign up for that. That will allow you to get a good foundation for skating technique and will help you in the long run. Don't be afraid to also start doing stick and pucks once you get the hang of basic skating. I started out doing basic exercises like skating between the blue lines with the puck and stopping. You'll fall down a lot starting out, but that's why you have pads :).  Public skates are also a really good way to work on technique without your hockey stick. I would still wear knee and elbow pads during the public skate just so that you don't bang yourself up too bad. Don't be self conscious about wearing gear to public skate; you're there to get better, not to impress anybody with your fashion sense.  For me, it took me about 2 months of skating and stick and puck before I started playing in beginner pickup games. Don't be afraid to jump in to play, just let people on your bench know that you're new and open to advice. Most guys are really supportive of new players out in pickup games and you'll learn rapidly while playing."
hockeyplayers,3c8o81,Skyline_BNR34,2,Mon Jul 6 13:24:12 2015 UTC,Roller blades and a street hockey stick are a great way to practice without laying out a ton of cash. All you need is a driveway or parking lot and your stuff. Don't have to spend a ton on the blades if its just for practice.  I started out with a cheap kids pop up goal which is great for solo practice and doesn't take up too much space.
hockeyplayers,3c8o81,inacatch22,2,Mon Jul 6 14:32:20 2015 UTC,"The first thing I'd say is don't even think about gear yet, just learn how to really skate well. Learn how to accelerate, decelerate, hockey stop from the left & right, skate backwards, stop backwards, etc. Your hockey game will only ever be as good as your skating allows it to be. You can know everything, have a great awareness, but if your skates can't get you to where you need to be then you'll never be good. So I'd really just concentrate on skating until you're just as comfortable on skates as you are off them. Once you are able go from full acceleration to a complete hockey stop on your weak side, you should be good to go.   Second, you might also want to consider inline hockey leagues, or even street hockey leagues (no skates) especially if you're new. Playing ice hockey is expensive, you have to pay for your ice time, and if it's not quality ice time it's no fun. Inline and street hockey are great ways to build up your skills for cheap. If you get a nice pair of inline skates, you can spend hours a day on your own time learning how to skate on a basketball court, tennis court or even the street. I know there's a roller hockey league that plays down by the beach in Chicago, I would check them out."

You only really need the rungs of lacing across the bend in your foot and up to be tight. You still want heal-lock but try loosening the laces on the fore-foot. Also, lacing outside-in helps to lock the laces and creates less pressure when you cinch them down, try that too if you have them laced inside-out."

I tried out and was offered a spot on a low level junior team shortly after the injury. I was never the same and had a major reconstructive spinal surgery my senior year in high school. I quite playing for a long, long time after that. I started playing again off and on really infrequently, but I always felt so much better when I did play. I am now living in Denver and I play as much as I can. Its a god send. I really only feel at home, content or at ease while I am playing. It was a very big part of my life growing up and after the injury, there was a very big part of my life that was gone. I take every chance I get to be on the ice. I take every chance I get to talk and read and watch hockey. If I could find a job in hockey, I would be living a dream. I can't speak for you, but losing the game I love so much was a serious blow to me in many aspects of my life. I live in constant pain and will for the rest of my life. Playing hockey is the only time I am able to block most the pain without the use of medicine. Maybe take some time off and get fully healthy and then make a decision. For me, I will play until my body physically does not allow it.  edit: grammar"

If you worry too much about getting injured, then you should hang up the skates. However, every time you step on the ice you should know that you run the risk of getting seriously injured. Weigh the risks and determine whether it is worth it."
hockeyplayers,3c4hmr,Jag94,4,Sat Jul 4 18:39:10 2015 UTC,"Nobody can tell you whether or not you should keep playing or not.  That's up to you and you alone. However, one thing you definitely need to pay attention to, is your recovery.  Don't half-ass it, and don't rush back into playing too soon.  Go to the rehab sessions, and do the rehab like the mobility and usage of your arm depends on it... ... ... because it does.    Once you're all healed up, then make the decision whether or not to get back into it.  Either way, good luck!"

I think it's possible I had some of those symptoms early on, but there was so much total pain I kinda lost the ability to discern where it was coming from.    Really felt like a car accident.

Ended up with an 8 inch spiral fracture in my fibula, went into surgery that night. I've only been on the ice a half a dozen times in the three years since. The only reason I haven't really gone back to playing twice a week is due to the plate interfering with how my skate fits on that leg...but there's definitely a mental factor at play. I do think that you can't just give it up entirely, hockey isn't something you can just walk away from. Watch lots of hockey, go to slower paced drop ins, gain some confidence, then decide what kind of 'quitting' you want to do. Maybe you don't play competitive hockey, but I know for me hockey is a release. If drop ins every couple months is all I can do, I'll take that over quitting entirely."

hockeyplayers,3c3y2m,Alley_runner101,5,Sat Jul 4 15:18:15 2015 UTC,"I would go big rather than small. You would rather have gear overlap a little bit than have gaps in protection. Also check other brands you may be surprised by how different they fit. For example, I just bought new elbow pads. I wear a Large in CCM, Medium is Reebok, Easton and Bauer and Small in Warrior. If you can get to a place to try on different brands?"
hockeyplayers,3c3y2m,kingofthediamond,3,Sat Jul 4 16:09:41 2015 UTC,"Also it's probably going to be easier to move in gear that's slightly bigger versus too small. For shoulderpads specifically, mine are a XXL and I'm 5'11 175 lbs and I love them like that."
hockeyplayers,3c3y2m,rjmaggie,3,Sat Jul 4 16:14:12 2015 UTC,"Are you planning on gaining/losing weight in the future? I was right in between bauer's small and medium sizes. I ended up going a bit larger and was happy I did. I discovered the gym to improve my game and ended up putting some size on my chest and bumped up from the low end of a medium in my shoulder pads to the high end. Some of my friends had the opposite problem and dropped weight after becoming more active and had to buy smaller gear. If you're not planning on any of that, maybe contact a bauer rep and explain your situation? I doubt anyone would know their own sizing better. For what it's worth, my personal opinion is that it's better to be on the smaller side of large gear than the larger side of small gear because I prefer my gear to fit a bit looser. Also, if i keep all the straps cinched tight, there's more overlap for better protection like in my shoulder pads. If you're really stretching the limits of a smaller size, it may not be as comfortable and you may have gaps in protection.  Are you buying your gear from a place with a good return policy? If you really can't decide and money isn't a big issue, buy both sizes and send back the one that doesn't fit. Ask your teammates. Maybe one of them has some gear they'd let you try on for size? Or maybe other people in this subreddit have similar measurements and can tell you their preferences?    I hope you find what you need!"

Unfortunately,  the best thing to do is wait until you can try stuff on.  I wouldn't plunk down a sizable amount of money for something unless I had a chance to try it on.  I would say that you should follow my example and get jr pants chest and maybe even shins.  If you have slender lady arms (like I do) then you could probably get away with jr elbows too.

Give me a soccer net and I'll still have a tough time.   I've been having fun, mostly playing D as I am fairly capable when it comes to getting in the way. Last night I went on at pickup as a winger. Got in front of the net. Actually caught a pass. Somehow, put it up top, glove side... blocked. Snagged the rebound and pushed the puck through the swarm of sticks towards five hole. Easy pad save. Snagged the rebound yet again and tucked between the post and the goalie's skate before falling backwards on my ass.

You will gain the strength back far quicker with a healed wrist, than with an injured one.    Also, if you really need to play, and you're not quite 100%, use a splint WHILE you play.  you may have limited motion, but you likely won't injury it further, and it keeps it protected from all sorts of minor injuries that hockey exposes us to.  Someone else mentioned it, but do PT exercises.  Sprains can take a while to recover from, but if you are diligent with your recovery, you can reduce the amount of time it takes to get better."

While she generally puts skaters through some skating drills, she'll have some assistant coaches working with goalies to get them additional reps so that they aren't standing around doing nothing.  Skill level-wise there are quite a few players who are decent but it's apparent that many of us haven't been playing for very long, or have just started learning."

hockeyplayers,3c246g,Itsafootlong,3,Sat Jul 4 02:39:48 2015 UTC,I ran cross country in high school to get ready for wrestling season.  Most of our workouts consisted of a mixture of interval trainings such as sprint the straights of a track and jog the turns and some long slow distance to get your leg muscles use to the amount of time you will be running.   Another good option is find your local gym and do spin classes.  If you have any further questions feel free to message me.

Time should be 15-16 secs for 100. 30-32 for 200 and 51-53 secs for 300. 45 sec break for 100.  A minute 50 break for 200 and 2:50 break for the 300's.
hockeyplayers,3c246g,ranatalus,2,Sun Jul 5 15:44:30 2015 UTC,"Sprint intervals are best as they kind of mimic actual play. Sprint 30 seconds, walk 30 seconds. Repeat until you can't.  Diet also plays a huge huge part. I personally carb load heavily about 5 hours before the game, and that works for me. Some guys like to eat energy chews or even gummy bears on the bench during intermissions. Try different things and see what helps."

hockeyplayers,3c246g,nealoc187,1 point,Sat Jul 4 01:50:23 2015 UTC,"i have found that my diet the day of a game has more to do with how much endurance i have than anything else, though to be fair I'm coming from a place of playing twice a week for years and years and just adjusting my diet, rather than not doing anything active to suddenly becoming active.  i've tried running steady and intervals, biking steady and intervals, etc.  i started keeping a spreadsheet of workouts and diet every day and then correlating that with how i felt during games, and i discovered the diet was the one thing that had a direct correlation with how i felt during games.  like i said thought i was already active a few times a week, so this may not apply to you."

hockeyplayers,3c07dq,camrivy17,4,Fri Jul 3 16:07:55 2015 UTC,"I do this all the time. Get two different colours of stick tape. Rip a piece, the length of your blade, off of the first one, then rip that into two thinner strips, put both, one at a time, onto the bottom of your blade. Now do the same with the other colour, but 3 or 4 times. So now you should have 8-10 layers of tape along the bottom of your stick, which should last a few hours on asphalt, and the different coloured tape will serve to tell you when you need to re tape. As soon as you can see it, rip the whole thing off and do it again."
hockeyplayers,3c07dq,avanross,3,Fri Jul 3 19:29:48 2015 UTC,"I saw a clip here about a year ago that showed how to cut up an aluminum can into little rectangle pieces that you wrap under your blade, like little c-clips then tape over and around.

Ebay does work but a better system imo is to buy from hockeymonkey.com and use Aust Posts reshipping service or shipito.com.  I've used shipito to ship a whole kit and have had no issues.  However skaters network in Sydney is only slightly more expensive then US prices in general and gives you a warranty under Oz law so is probably worth the extra $20 in most cases."

hockeyplayers,3bx7dv,Firsmith,16,Thu Jul 2 22:07:05 2015 UTC,"As a girl, thought I could chime in here. Girls who sign up for coed teams know what they're getting themselves into and will already know what they're comfortable with when it comes to locker room etiquette.   Obviously a locker room is a place where everyone should feel comfortable, but when there's only one room available, concessions have to be made. When I played with boys anyone who was uncomfortable with the arrangements would either show up with their base layers already on under their track suit or would go to the bathroom to change. If they're the ones that are bothered by someone who's not overstepping their bounds, they're the ones who need to find a solution."
hockeyplayers,3bx7dv,_janada,10,Fri Jul 3 01:55:57 2015 UTC,"I've had a couple women on the various teams I've been on and its never been an issue.   As far as the person threatening to quit because of it, that's a pretty petty reason to quit so fuck'em."
hockeyplayers,3bx7dv,4dotgov,29,Thu Jul 2 22:19:57 2015 UTC,"They're a member of the team, just like anyone else.  If a guy isn't comfortable changing with other teammates, he can change somewhere else.  If a girl isn't comfortable with changing with other teammates, she can change somewhere else.   Neither of these things should be looked down on or judged.  I've played on teams with girls before, and it's never been a problem.  Sometimes they change with us, sometimes they change separately if they feel like it.   But threatening to quit?  That sounds like immature entitlement to me.   The guy on the team doesn't get to just make the entire locker room a girl-free zone at the expense of someone else.   If he has a problem, he should deal with it on his end, not everyone else's.  And if he can't do that, then it's probably best that he's not on the team because that's a pretty toxic attitude to have."
hockeyplayers,3bx7dv,stevegcook,11,Thu Jul 2 22:20:28 2015 UTC,"yeah - I mean, if someone wants to go change in the bathroom, go ahead. But I don't think anyone should feel obligated to do so.   Agreed on the toxic attitude."

hockeyplayers,3bx7dv,dez04,5,Thu Jul 2 23:02:18 2015 UTC,"In the league that I'm in, each team gets a change room and then there's a shared women's change room and it seems to work out well. When I've organized pick up, the girls usually request a change room so I try to get the rink to accommodate us and can get something worked out.   Personally? I have no issue with co-ed change rooms. It'd be nice if we could get the girls in the change room for the post game beer and make them feel more like part of the team, but I understand why they would prefer a separate room. Along those lines, it's not out of the question that guys would want a separate room, I suppose."
hockeyplayers,3bx7dv,Vargatron,4,Thu Jul 2 23:20:13 2015 UTC,I play in an all men's beer league. I'm the only female player in the league. I change in a separate change room. Years before I was given a change room I changed in a bathroom stall that wasn't attached to the guys dressing room. I never had an issue with nudity being myself or them. But I always had a feeling their wives/girlfriends would.
hockeyplayers,3bx7dv,RustyDarkstar76,5,Fri Jul 3 12:00:47 2015 UTC,"My view is if she has signed up for the team and she's fine with a co-ed locker room, there shouldn't be an issue. The team captain's wife on my beer league team changed in the dressing room with us and there wasn't any objection by her or any of the others guys. If any of the guys get completely naked, they always either turn around or use a towel. Then again, this is adult league, so a lot of people are kind of past the whole nudity thing I think.  I would just make it known that the team you're assembling is co-ed and all players will have equal access to the facilities. If anybody isn't cool with a female in the locker room then they just won't sign up. It's their loss, not yours. I wouldn't phrase it in a way that calls out the female that signed up, but I would just say ""team open to men and women""."

But that's my/her issue and not the team's so I'd just put on my cup and shorts in the bathroom and take a separate shift in the shower.  Most rinks I play at have a women's locker room.

It's amazing that a stick this light is as durable as it is. I have 2, and can't destroy the first one (although the heel is beginning to chip) If the stick was branded as a Bauer, it would be the end all be all of high end sticks.

hockeyplayers,3bvkb6,TeamMATH,9,Thu Jul 2 14:35:48 2015 UTC,"I've been playing beer-league hockey in Ottawa for almost a decade and I've never been more frustrated with the administration in a hockey league. The OSAHL conveners make zero effort to balance any of the divisions even after repeated phone calls, e-mails, tweets. Our team is halfway through the season and we haven't won a single game. We've done everything within reason to make the league act upon this.  Every single division has at least one team that is dominating and one team that is getting crushed every game. Blowouts are common. These are simple fixes to make from an administration standpoint; just bump a team up and bump a team down and swap their schedules.  Don't give this league your money. The administration does not care once they have it. Play in the Traveller's league, for example, and enjoy the free game at the Canadian Tire Centre. Go anywhere else, really."
hockeyplayers,3bvkb6,aradil,4,Thu Jul 2 14:39:39 2015 UTC,"Are all of those games blowouts?  I've played on teams before that lost most of the games in a season but most were only by a few goals. Sure it's frustrating, but not as bad as other leagues I played in where we were regularly blown out."
hockeyplayers,3bvkb6,aradil,6,Thu Jul 2 14:41:36 2015 UTC,"Yep, all blowouts.  I completely agree, losing a game by a goal really isn't that bad. Feeling competitive and coming up short doesn't destroy morale. Spending $350 to have ex-OHL players skate around you like a pylon does."
hockeyplayers,3bvkb6,RDC123,5,Thu Jul 2 14:45:27 2015 UTC,"Yup, that looks pretty bad. I've played with and against a few ex-Q players, and a few of which were drafted. But rarely more than one on a team."
hockeyplayers,3bvkb6,AlexTheGreat,2,Thu Jul 2 15:23:47 2015 UTC,"Most of the time these high-level guys aren't jerks. They know they can beat most players on speed and skill alone and they often do. I don't even have a problem with a team that is completely carried by 1 player, I just want to go into a game knowing we have a chance to win.  No player can improve when the other team absolutely dominates the play the entire game.  League administration should be looking at every game, recognizing blowouts along with winning patterns, and acting on balancing once a month or so. It's not hard work, either, and can even be interesting if you like looking at stats (like goal differentials, etc). Balancing is one of the most important things a league can do to let you know they're paying attention and that they care about how much fun their player-base has in their league. Business 101."
hockeyplayers,3bvkb6,RDC123,5,Thu Jul 2 15:34:48 2015 UTC,"How do you rebalance every month? You can't just bump a team that's 5-0 in October into a higher division come November without totally screwing with the standings for both divisions, especially if you're going to do it again come December."
hockeyplayers,3bvkb6,AlexTheGreat,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:10:27 2015 UTC,"Either you swap them with the lowest rank team and swap their records, or you just give them a .500 record.  If they complain it's their fault for not choosing the correct division."
hockeyplayers,3bvkb6,aradil,5,Thu Jul 2 16:38:09 2015 UTC,"If you swap records you hand one team 5 wins they didn't earn and hand another team 5 losses they don't deserve. Hardly seems fair to them or the other teams in the divisions. A .500 record could work, but it still completely screws with the standings. On top of that mid-season re balancing impacts the other teams by resulting in only some having to play the good/bad team in the division.  I don't see where it's their fault unless they scouted out the league and picked a division they could walk all over, which seems like a hell of a lot of effort, or lied about their skill level. The league is responsible for placing teams in divisions."
hockeyplayers,3bvkb6,RDC123,4,Thu Jul 2 17:03:37 2015 UTC,"This is beer league, having good games is far more important than the final standings.  They earned those wins n losses by either playing in a division that was too high or one that was too low.    Yes it does mess with the schedule a little but hopefully the divisions are not so far out of whack that there is a huge difference between the two teams swapped."
hockeyplayers,3bvkb6,RDC123,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:06:37 2015 UTC,I completely agree. Many leagues in Ottawa also use the following rule:   Point Carryovers: No team may move from one division to another (either up or down) with more points than the totals of the highest team or less points than the lowest team. A team’s record will be adjusted if necessary.
hockeyplayers,3bvkb6,MK667,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:23:46 2015 UTC,"While that's true, the leagues I play in have playoffs, and those playoffs are basically free games for the teams that make it.  Of course this means that balance is important, but so are the standings.  Where I play it's hard because most leagues only have one big division."
hockeyplayers,3bvkb6,smeddy95,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:44:04 2015 UTC,"Good games are important but I know pretty much every beer league team I've played on would flip its shit if the divisions were shuffled around every month. Guys care about the standings, it may be beer league but it's still competitive."
hockeyplayers,3bvkb6,roffleburger,3,Thu Jul 2 18:57:29 2015 UTC,"Standings mean nothing in the OSAHL because every team makes the playoffs. It doesn't matter if you're in first or last because you still go into a round robin before the elimination games start. There's no advantage to winning all the season games in this scenario, which I think is a good thing.  The league, in this case, should make every effort to reorganize and rebalance each division before the round robin starts. Everyone is happy then."
hockeyplayers,3bvkb6,Avatar_ZW,3,Thu Jul 2 17:10:29 2015 UTC,"Well that changes things, never heard of that sort of setup before."
hockeyplayers,3bvkb6,smeddy95,2,Thu Jul 2 18:56:21 2015 UTC,So this doesn't just happen at my league. We had a similar thing happen this season at my rookie league. The top team finished the season off with one loss. Almost every game of theirs was 8 or higher to 0 or 1.
hockeyplayers,3bvkb6,skaughtx0r,1 point,Sat Jul 4 19:23:50 2015 UTC,"It's not fair and it's not fun for every other team. I'm sorry to hear that, man."
hockeyplayers,3bvkb6,orionthefisherman,5,Mon Jul 6 13:44:19 2015 UTC,"I agree this league is really frustrating. It takes them forever to release the entire schedule, divisions are unbalanced, and the rules are downright stupid. No changes on puck covers, offsides, or when the puck goes out of play, but you can change on icing. Every year I've played there's been at least one team in my division who does nothing but hit, slash, fight,  and chirp - to the point where the games get legitimately dangerous - yet the refs do almost nothing about it. Any suggestions for other men's leagues in Ottawa/Kanata area?"
hockeyplayers,3bvkb6,JimmyD2,3,Thu Jul 2 16:37:37 2015 UTC,"I play in Travellers and I've really had no issues, so I've kept my team in it for a few years now. With that being said, all of the refs in the Ottawa leagues are the same, they all ref different leagues but it's one large pool of refs that typically ref the sameish divisions, so you can't do anything about the refereeing."
hockeyplayers,3bvkb6,JimmyD2,3,Fri Jul 3 03:35:57 2015 UTC,No changes allowed except on icing? I can't even
hockeyplayers,3bvkb6,Kato91CRX,2,Sun Jul 5 05:10:42 2015 UTC,Icing goals and penalties...
hockeyplayers,3bvkb6,manygrams,2,Mon Jul 6 00:11:35 2015 UTC,"I feel the same way. There's nothing less fun than a game wherein the refs make no calls and they happen often in this league.  I can't, in good conscience, recommend the CRHL (used to be the OSMHL). They used to be top dog in Ottawa for a long time but they're really geared towards top-end hockey. If you want a n00b-friendly league don't try this one. Even the bottom division is quite competitive.  I mention Traveller's in my first comment because I play for a second team registered for it. Frankly, it's been a wonderful experience. The refs seem to call everything which means the goons see the box more and clean hockey is rewarded. Also, it has more teams registered which means more divisions to group them in and less blowouts."
hockeyplayers,3bvkb6,PawneeRaccoon,2,Thu Jul 2 17:17:35 2015 UTC,"That sucks, I'm glad my rink has it's own division for 2 teams because we're so much worse than the next division. Most of us are really new, haven't even been playing for a year. They've had us play a few exhibition games against the next divison up and it's been really lopsided like 14 - 2, haha."
hockeyplayers,3bvkb6,PawneeRaccoon,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:28:16 2015 UTC,It really does.  If I was just learning to play I can't imagine how much more frustrated I'd be. Some guys on our team don't touch the puck once all night long.
hockeyplayers,3bvkb6,Kitten_Hammer,2,Thu Jul 2 15:43:09 2015 UTC,"Pretty tough sledding there. Does the league rate players? I know a lot of leagues don't want to because it leads to endless disputes about ratings, but at least taking previous stats in account is pretty reasonable, especially for goalies. Good goaltender can make a huge difference"
hockeyplayers,3bvkb6,somethinggangster,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:18:56 2015 UTC,"A good goaltender can make or break a game, it's true!  No ratings here. The league keeps track of goals scored, assists, etc, but most teams are pre-formed when they register for the league so there aren't many teams of strangers getting paired up by skill-level. I think it's a great idea it's just not in practice here."
hockeyplayers,3bvkb6,jswan28,2,Thu Jul 2 18:33:50 2015 UTC,"My league does the same crap. It's just laziness by the guy running things. He split our C division into C ""North"" and C ""South"" seemingly arbitrarily and it took us a year and a half to get him to finally bump us up to C ""North"" after we were winning every game in C South like 7-1.  Good luck to you"
hockeyplayers,3bvkb6,roffleburger,2,Thu Jul 2 18:38:16 2015 UTC,Thanks!  It's hard not to be cynical and chalk it up to either incompetence or laziness on the convener's behalf. My team isn't the only team affected either. Every single one of the divisions has a team that can't be beat and another that loses almost every game.  You can bet I'm super excited to play this game.
hockeyplayers,3bvkb6,whatthefrickenfrack,2,Thu Jul 2 18:48:48 2015 UTC,"Does it bother the other teams? I mean, I can speak from experience on both sides, and blowing teams out every game isn't any more fun than getting blown out every game. It kind of sucks either way. Maybe if you get some of the other captains involved the administration will be more responsive"

hockeyplayers,3bwj1d,DeuceBigalowMyNigalo,3,Thu Jul 2 19:00:46 2015 UTC,"The vapor line is designed for lightness over protection, which makes it great for speed and agility, but not so good for blocking shots (especially the shoulder pads). The supreme line will be more protective, but more designed for mobility and therefor very thin and tight to the body, so not great for shot blocking but not horrible. The nexus line is bauers most protective line, and will be wider and fuller fitting.  It shouldn't matter too much for gloves and elbows(comfort is the most important thing there), but I'd keep this in mind when you're picking out shoulders, pants and shins."
hockeyplayers,3bwj1d,avanross,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:21:52 2015 UTC,"Thank you. I wasn't aware of all that. With that in mind I have another question for you. Would you recommend the Nexus 8000 line then, or would you recommend the 6000. i apologize for all the questions. :D"
hockeyplayers,3bwj1d,Psychotic_Ninja,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:44:26 2015 UTC,"Acctually, the Supreme line is going to give the best protection. They're packed with so much impact absorbing foam and plastics like poron xrd foam. The nexus line is more of a traditional fitting line of pads, it wasn't built around protection like the Supremes."
hockeyplayers,3bwj1d,Psychotic_Ninja,1 point,Fri Jul 3 02:16:24 2015 UTC,man this is confusing. It annoys me how there's like4 versions of the supreme line so now I have to ask what version your specifying haha.
hockeyplayers,3bwj1d,Psychotic_Ninja,1 point,Fri Jul 3 02:21:38 2015 UTC,"All of the Supreme line in general, however, the nxg line is last year's top of the line model, right now the price has dropped substantially. It's a great steal to get them."

I'd recommend trying both on and seeing which features are worth the price jump. If you ask to see the official bauer catalogue at your local hockey store it'll tell you the exact differences between them.

hockeyplayers,3bwucc,Skyline_BNR34,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:45:44 2015 UTC,"Titanium is more brittle than steel, so if you ever do take a really hard shot, it'd be more likely to crack rather than bending.

They have made the bars of the cage differently in a way thats hard to explain but you can see better because even though theyre the same width, theyre turned to the side so the profile is slimmer without losing strength. I would absolutely recommend them"
hockeyplayers,3bwucc,Vuronov,1 point,Fri Jul 3 20:10:15 2015 UTC,"I went with the 7500. I had my LHS put a re-akt on my helmet to try it out. It was marginally smaller in the same size so my chin wasn't as well aligned with the cup and it didn't have the WOW factor to say this is so much better than the 7500. It was nice, but with the cage secured it was hard to notice the weight difference. I only really noticed when the cage was unsecured. I tried the CCM 580, but it wasn't for me. Bauer's flat bars were thinner and the fit was just different enough that I didn't like it. Thanks for all the responses."

The answer to both is no. I don't notice any difference when playing. I have the big ones that cover the laces and go all the way down the skate.   After taking a slapshot to the laces, I bought these and I don't play without them.   edit: I play forward and D so backwards crossovers too are unaffected."
hockeyplayers,3bw4wj,ultimate_jack,2,Thu Jul 2 18:38:26 2015 UTC,"Yep, I have had a pair of the regular (non-pro) version for a couple years and I love em. I was worried they would be clunky and would get tangled in crossovers but they don't at all.  Once I put them on I barely notice them.  After my 3rd ankle surgery I decided I needed a bit more protection and I have taken some pretty good clappers directly on the guard and I didn't feel a thing.    If you block a lot of shots you NEED these.  Only a matter of time until you do some damage that can't be limped off and these would help prevent that."

hockeyplayers,3bt0ru,Zednix,2,Wed Jul 1 22:20:54 2015 UTC,"It sounds like you've got similar stick preferences to myself. I picked up a two-pack of the Easton Stealth RS2s with Heatley blades and the elliptical taper for cheap on eBay after my S19 with the same configuration was nearing the end of its service life, and I've been pretty happy so far. Since actual stick technology doesn't change too much year-to-year (just the marketing) buying top-of-the-line equipment a year or two after its debut is my favorite way to get good value. I'm also a fan of buying sticks in packs of 2 or 3 if you know what you're getting, so you don't have to learn a new stick all the damn time."
hockeyplayers,3bt0ru,evanstravers,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:33:43 2015 UTC,Elliptical taper? Autocorrected?
hockeyplayers,3bt0ru,evanstravers,2,Wed Jul 1 22:51:42 2015 UTC,"Nope, It's a standard feature on the upper end Easton Stealth line of sticks - the 'taper' from the shaft to the blade has an elliptical profile instead of a square one the whole way down.  It makes the kick point a bit lower and the stick a bit more whippy. Give it a Google to see what I mean."
hockeyplayers,3bt0ru,Kitten_Hammer,1 point,Wed Jul 1 23:05:22 2015 UTC,Taper between the blade throat and the main shaft of the stick is ovular instead of the common rectangular.
hockeyplayers,3bt0ru,yol_oreos,2,Thu Jul 2 02:45:04 2015 UTC,"I like shallow curves that are relatively closed to keep my slapshot down. Here are a few that I like:   Warrior: Burrows/W01 Easton: Iginla/P7 Bauer: Stamkos/PM9   My preference usually is Bauer>Warrior>Easton>Other for any stick in a given price range.   I would go to a pro show and hold a few sticks before you make a purchase, though."
hockeyplayers,3bt0ru,avanross,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:58:17 2015 UTC,"Easton's E4 would be equivalent to the pm9 and burrows. The iginla is a lot closer to the the curve op is using now tho but smaller, less open and shallower. That could be right up his alley."
hockeyplayers,3bt0ru,el_karacho,1 point,Thu Jul 2 07:26:29 2015 UTC,"I friggin love the Iginla/P7, recently transitioned to Easton's new E36 curve and it's very similar.  I think OP would like E36 curve."
hockeyplayers,3bt0ru,kingofthediamond,2,Thu Jul 2 18:07:16 2015 UTC,You rang? what kind where you looking for? other than a less agressive curve?   I highly recommend Warrior over the others. Sherwoods are okay and Eastons have durability issues

hockeyplayers,3bt0ru,_ThatGuyWithTheFace_,2,Thu Jul 2 02:11:43 2015 UTC,P88 is probably the best decision then. It's got more of a curve than a PM9 and less of a toe curve than the P92.

I've played with them for 5 years 2-3 times a week, up to a B level in rec hockey and have had no issues.   Each brand sizes differently so read the sizing charts how they compare to shoe sizes.   I suggest spending whatever you feel comfortable spending. If you feel like you are going to stick with it and play for a while, spend more. But if you are unsure, there are some decent skates at a cheaper price. Check out hockeygiant.com you can search skates by size which is helpful."

hockeyplayers,3brnxa,Skyline_BNR34,2,Wed Jul 1 18:21:43 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say it's the sole cause, but that seems reasonable that it wouldn't help one's skating form. I would chalk it up mostly to technique though.   Edit:  Seeing the pic now, that does look like a lot of extra space - maybe even 1-2 sizes too big?"
hockeyplayers,3brnxa,Skyline_BNR34,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:28:58 2015 UTC,"That's probably close to twice as much space as I have, and fwiw, I felt like I was falling over my toes in my 7.5, don't feel that way in the 8.5. So kinda the reverse of dragging the skates in stride.  From the wear, I would think those skates are a full size too large.  Does your heel lift? Thanks for sharing the pic, I'm gonna compare after I get home from work."
hockeyplayers,3brnxa,Inconspicuous_User,2,Wed Jul 1 19:06:41 2015 UTC,"You might be able to go down a half size and be fine if you have that much space, after the boot broke in and the ankles got locked in your toe probably wouldn't be rubbing the toe cap anymore, but if you are fine with what you have and aren't stumbling, I wouldn't change it just to change.  When I went to try on skates I tried on a 7.5D and I tapped the toecap against something. I could feel my toes hitting the inside of the toe cap on 7.5D skates. So when I went to a 8.0D I did the same test but felt nothing in the toe cap. The guy that was at the shop said to go with those skates as my first skates were a 7.0D and were way too small.  EDIT: Here is my footbed of my skates to give you an idea of my fitment."

hockeyplayers,3bnlqc,BaggySpandex,2,Tue Jun 30 22:28:55 2015 UTC,I'm having trouble with this :(  I feel like when I try to get a really deep knee bend I'm fighting against my ankle in the boot. I feel like I should have my skates pitched forward more because I get so much resistance to my ankles. Any thoughts?   If I try to keep the uppers of my boot a little more loosely laced I lose a lot of side-to-side stability I feel.
hockeyplayers,3bnlqc,BaggySpandex,2,Wed Jul 1 01:57:42 2015 UTC,"Do you lace your skates all the way up? Do you put the shin guard over top of the skate tongue? Once I dropped down and eyelit and switched to flopping the tongue, my ankle mobility improved.   If that's not the case for you, I would look into some ankle stretches. Check /r/fitness Ankle mobility is a huge part of good squatting form, so there's plenty of discussion about it there."

Grab pants that have a strap tightener/belt and laces on them. CCM is good for that but Reebok has a few models like that as well and since they no longer exist their gear is all super cheap now. Helmet is all your head shape, no matter what your height or weight is. You need to try those on in person most definitely so they fit the size and shape of your head."
hockeyplayers,3bpzm6,69dickmasterj,2,Wed Jul 1 20:12:36 2015 UTC,"Also, Warrior has intermediate fit of their equipment lines. It'll be senior sizes with less volume for teenaged-sized players. Maybe worth checking out too."

hockeyplayers,3bpzm6,Fireonahill,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:32:14 2015 UTC,Yeah I believe it is. Every piece of NXG protective gear I've tried on has been very snug. Vapor gear is usually tighter in one spot and tapers out. the gloves for example; tight in the fingers and loose in the wrist.

If I could do it over I might choose Jr. large shoulders because mine aren't tight enough around the mid section and ride up to my neck during games. It really just depends on your build and its best to try stuff out before you buy it."

hockeyplayers,3bl3c3,CSGustav,2,Tue Jun 30 02:46:08 2015 UTC,"I know I'm late to the game, but I wanted to give you some scoring advice.   I think my problem is I keep looking right at the goalie when I shoot and not what's open.   I get this a lot from new players.  I can tell you that looking at the goalie is a good thing.  If you are looking at the goalie, they have to expect shot and if your eyes are on them, they have to hope you hit them, because at that point its a guessing game.  If I'm staring at an open corner, chances are the goalie is staring at me and able to cheat a bit towards my body language.    What I would suggest is practice shooting where you're not looking.  A good way to start is to set up in the high slot with a couple of pucks during warm ups.  Square up to the net and focus dead middle of the crossbar.  Now alternate shooting top right then top left without adjusting your hips or eyes.  This will help you start to 'disconnect' your eyes with your shot.  Another great warm up shot that will get you used to shooting counter-intuitively is to start out the face off dot opposite of your shooting hand.  So if your a right handed shot start at the left dot.  Skate parallel to the net with some speed toward the opposite face off dot.  You should have your shoulders square to the other dot.  Once you cross center ice shoot for the corner of the net that you just skated past.  This one is also great for learning how to generate power in your shot when you aren't in a natural shooting position.  Like this."
hockeyplayers,3bl3c3,luckytwosix,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:13:02 2015 UTC,"congrats! cheap goal or not, you got a goal :) before your game, visualize every aspect of what could possibly happen. this helps me with little things in the game, or things like scoring big goals.  I used to shoot at the chest when I first started, but the more I practice shooting and stick handling, the more I was able to aim where I wanted to score. hope this helps!"

How was this possible?  A large majority of goals were teammate shots that redirected off of me.  I'd say literally my ass had a good season, scoring more goals in the second half of that year than I do each season of beer league now.  They all count.  Even the ass-shots."
hockeyplayers,3bl3c3,bobovski,1 point,Tue Jun 30 12:24:03 2015 UTC,They all count. Even the ass-shots.   Yup. I had a teammate shoot a puck straight at my thigh which then rebounded into the goal. It was the only goal I got that season and I'm damn proud of it!

But either way, just go try out, money spent playing hockey is never wasted, and your size will certainly get you a second look by any coach."
hockeyplayers,3blymw,Badmathteacher,2,Tue Jun 30 12:14:32 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure that most of the teams tryouts are over, I had mine in the spring. But, if you really want to play, try to contact the coaches and ask about roster spots that are left. They'll usually want to evaluate you at a stick and puck or something. make sure the you can stop and crossover on both sides, a lot of coaches look for that."
hockeyplayers,3blymw,Psychotic_Ninja,1 point,Tue Jun 30 12:37:11 2015 UTC,It depends where you are. Growing up in Western Canada nothing happened until the late summer/fall and the house leagues were at the end of that time frame.
hockeyplayers,3blymw,RDC123,2,Tue Jun 30 14:38:10 2015 UTC,"Op, email the coach and explain you'd like to join the team.  If the coach needs players, then he might let you skate in on some practices to asses your skill before letting you play games  Edit: and join a summer league.  High School Summer leagues are more relaxed and a great way to improve skills.  Also it's easy to join a team halfway through the season, but you might get placed on the worst team."
hockeyplayers,3blymw,0Psmom,1 point,Tue Jun 30 14:38:14 2015 UTC,"I don't have any experience with organized hockey leagues, other than my friends who play, but maybe you could contact the coach and talk to him about your skill. That's where I would start.  Or maybe he could introduce you to some of the players and you could skate together, play a pick up game, etc.. Are there tryouts? Anyways, good luck, I hope you get to play! I am just starting to learn so I wish I could play organized hockey. Hit them with your best shot. Heh."
hockeyplayers,3blymw,awildnoob,1 point,Tue Jun 30 09:05:55 2015 UTC,Being a first year player at Major Midget trying to make a rep team is going to be very difficult.  Not to mention just about all rep teams conduct tryouts and choose their teams in the spring.    Joining a house league team will still be competitive hockey.   You will have a regular season and playoff and most likely attend a tournament or two.     My advice is to find a minor hockey program in your area and jump on it.   It's very common for leagues to use July 1st as a cutoff for early registration which usually saves you $$.
hockeyplayers,3blymw,pokaro,1 point,Tue Jun 30 12:17:06 2015 UTC,I don't see why it would be an issue if you're a competent skater and there are teams at lower skill levels.

Dont second guess, dont worry about what you cant do, or why its difficult. If you want to do it, work your ass off and go for it! Because in a few years, you wont have the opportunity.   Dont give any creddence to the people who say you cant do it, or its not possible, or youre too old. F*ck them. If you want it. Go get it.

Had always been athletic, but made a return at 22 after not playing since middle school. Obviously, any on-ice open skating opportunities are important, but don't discount rollerblades when you don't have access. As for the weight room, focus on the muscles that you don't use as much in other sports. Lower back strength, for example, is critical for speed when skating. Hip abductors and adductors will be important for stability during your stride. Make a note of what all is sore after you skate and make an effort to improve those areas.    Let me know if you have any questions, whether it's with regards to gear, training, etc.!"
hockeyplayers,3bld2l,chenac,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:17:43 2015 UTC,Much appreciated. I'm going to start going to stick & puck at my local rink and was wondering if you could recommend anything that I should be doing so I can shake the rust off.
hockeyplayers,3bknfk,te45,14,Tue Jun 30 00:19:20 2015 UTC,"I'll try and stick to playing terms vs. culture terms.   ""Point/s"" - Where the Defensemen tend to hover around during an offense push. It's the area right by the blueline, but still onside. Can be used as an exclamation to call a forward to cycle the puck back to the point for a defensemen to take a clapper.   ""Cycle"" - To move the puck around, typically in the offensive zone. Cycling the puck is what you see on a powerplay, lots of passing between teammates.   ""Clapper"" - Slapshot  ""Cover the point"" - Typically meant for wingers, but the act of making sure you are putting pressure on the defensemen so they can't get an easy slapshot off from the point. This means either blocking the shot, or making them dump the puck back in deep.   ""Deep"" - This means getting the puck further into the offensive zone. This is done to mitigate the risk of the puck being stolen at the blueline and possibly leading to a breakaway. It can also be used to give your teammates time to change lines. Say you need a change, you send the puck as far towards the opposition goalie as you can, so you can then go for a change without the opposition being super close to your goalie.   ""Wheel"" - Skate hard with the puck. If someone is yelling this at you, it means you've got a good opportunity to progress the puck forward, or perhaps they need to change, so you taking the puck deep will help the team.   ""Apple"" or ""Helper"" - Assist   ""Slot"" - the middle section of the ice between the offensive zone circles. Close to the goalie is ""Low Slot"" and neared to the blueline is ""High Slot"". It's a high scoring area of the rink and you should do you best to not let shots get off from that area.   ""Backcheck"" - Backchecking is rushing back to the defensive zone to defend an offensive rush from the opposition. Typically done by the forwards (as the defensemen are usually the first back).   ""Forecheck"" - Forechecking is working to maintain possession in the offensive zone. A good forecheck steals the puck from the defending team.   ""Breakaway"" - Getting the puck and going against the goalie with no defenders in front of you (but they will be chasing you down ie ""backchecking"")  ""Drop Pass"" - When you are rushing in and pass the puck backwards or just leave it there because you have a teammate trailing you. It is intended to draw a defensemen away from the puck. Don't drop pass unless you have really good chemistry with your teammates. In rec league hockey it often becomes a turnover, giving the opposition a good offensive chance.   ""Turnover"" - When you lose posession of the puck and the other team gets it.   ""PK"" or ""Penalty Kill"" - When you are down a man due to penalty. It matters because you have to play more defensively. You can ice the puck at will during a penalty kill.   ""Powerplay"" - When the other team is penalty killing and you have the advantage.   ""Even"" - Usually yelled when a player is coming out of the penalty box to indicate that you are playing 5 on 5 hockey again.   ""Twig"" or ""Lumber"" - Your stick   ""5-hole"" - The space between the goalies leg pads.   ""Snipe"" - Well place shot  ""Saucer Pass"" or ""Sauce"" - Passing the puck, but off the ice so that it is harder to intercept. The key to good sauce is to pass it so that the puck lands flat and doesn't bounce around.   ""Grenade"" - Puck that bounces a lot. Warm pucks are more likely to grenade on you. Which is why the NHL freezes them before games.   ""Top Shelf"" - The upper part of the goal.   ""Wheelhouse"" - The optimal puck placement for a good shot  ""Wrap Around"" - Scoring a goal by skating behind the net and sliding the puck in. Just watch the video - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmIg4EEdJyM  ""Stripes"" or ""Zebra"" - The ref  ""Tendy"" - Goaltender  That's all I've got for now"
hockeyplayers,3bknfk,Gibson19,5,Tue Jun 30 02:59:42 2015 UTC,"""Cycle"" - To move the puck around, typically in the offensive zone. Cycling the puck is what you see on a powerplay, lots of passing between teammates.   Cycling specifically refers to an offensive zone play where the puck is continuously played into the corner by 2-3 offensive zone players skating in a circle. Like this. Player A puts the puck in the corner and moves to B. Player C gets the puck and goes to A. Player B moves to C."
hockeyplayers,3bknfk,dazosan,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:10:36 2015 UTC,True. By beer league standards we'll call any sort of offensive passing a cycle.  Especially if the puch reaches the point

hockeyplayers,3bknfk,Bluearmy69,2,Tue Jun 30 05:10:22 2015 UTC,"Along with what has already been said, a ""bender"" is someone who is terrible at skating.

hockeyplayers,3bknfk,dazosan,2,Tue Jun 30 23:24:30 2015 UTC,Grocery stick - player that does not get a lot of ice time. Usually positioned between the forward and d-men on the bench so the other players can more easily get to the bench door.

hockeyplayers,3blc3x,puckoffman,5,Tue Jun 30 03:49:58 2015 UTC,"High Intensity Interval Training is great for hockey. Either while running or on a bike you take it easy for say 1 minute, then for 30 seconds try and reach about 90% percent of your max heart rate. So you're essentially sprinting and giving it your all for 30 seconds then recovering with a brisk walk or slow pedal.   Works you're endurance, builds muscle and helps you recover from anaerobic bursts of energy. Consistently training this way will help prevent the build up of lactic acid, which fatigues your muscles and leaves you sore afterwards.   Strength training is always a good idea too. I tend to lean towards more compound exercises. Squats, deadlifts, OHP, etc.. As they tend to activate your core more than isolated exercises. I try and mix in box jumps as well to practice explosiveness."
hockeyplayers,3blc3x,Gibson19,1 point,Tue Jun 30 13:12:17 2015 UTC,Insanity is a good program for this. It also works your legs/core more than your arms which is probably where you want to focus at first.
hockeyplayers,3blc3x,Hurricane_Viking,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:18:18 2015 UTC,"Yup, this is outstanding advice.   I work for Flywheel, an indoor cycling club, and the workouts are PERFECT for hockey. Basically you go balls to the wall for 30-40 seconds, then take a 15 second break. And you do this (with different variations of resistence and speed) for 45 minutes. Like i said, perfect for hockey.   Then i do ""the program"" on days that im not taking the bike classes."

hockeyplayers,3bjppl,CapitalsHockey,3,Mon Jun 29 19:55:37 2015 UTC,"I've been battling patellar dislocations for 4 or 5 years. My best advise is see a physical therapist. I tried to self medicate with different braces and wraps, and continued to have problems. Two years ago I talked to my doctor about it, and had 8 weeks of PT with a sport specific therapist. They gave me a good regiment of stretches and exercises that have helped tremendously. Lots of leg presses, stretches, wall sits, and resistance training. Almost all of the exercises can be done at home. I was also put into a don joy tru-pull light and haven't had a dislocation since."
hockeyplayers,3bjppl,chopperinthetrunk,2,Tue Jun 30 13:09:55 2015 UTC,"Hey, that's me exactly! I've done it twice in the past 2 years playing hockey, but have a history of subluxation going back probably 8 years or so. Did your incidents happen while playing hockey, or doing other activities?       I wear a DonJoy Tru-Pull Lite brace whenever I'm on the ice and size up on my shin pads in order to accommodate them. I'm not sure if they actually help or not, but I hardly notice them once the game begins and they give me peace of mind/confidence when I'm out there skating.    With that being said, skating is actually not too bad on your kneecaps compared to other sports. I'd make an effort to strengthen your quads and ensure you have ample flexibility in your hamstrings and hips so that your kneecap is tracking correctly. Are you hoping to get back into league play come the fall/winter? I could definitely pass along the rehab exercises I've done each time, though everybody's situation is different.    [edit] The other response reminded me, I also ice my knees after physical activity, but I use a Cryo/Cuff. If you're experiencing pain or swelling of any kind, it can't hurt to try this!"
hockeyplayers,3bjppl,chenac,2,Mon Jun 29 20:39:14 2015 UTC,"My last dislocation was a few months ago, so fall when I want to return. As for exercises, passing some along would be amazing! Thank you so much!"
hockeyplayers,3bjppl,chenac,2,Mon Jun 29 20:45:34 2015 UTC,I'd start with some of these! The physical therapist will probably pick 3-6 of these for you to do daily. The ones that helped me the most were quad sets and straight leg raises. These will be critical to improve your range of motion and get you started on the right path towards restrengthening your quads.
hockeyplayers,3bjppl,Gibson19,2,Tue Jun 30 13:30:04 2015 UTC,I use a Breg's PTO brace for my patellar tendon issues as recommended by my doctor. So far it's been great.   General strength in the legs helps with this. In particular strengthening your VMO. There are quite a few exercises that really target that muscle. It helps in stability of the knee.
hockeyplayers,3bjppl,OGDavidBond,1 point,Mon Jun 29 22:05:41 2015 UTC,"I run XC to prepare endurance wise for hockey season. While running I dislocated my knee cap when I got grazed by a car. Get a knee brace with a platella opening on it. After you return use that while you play. Also, ice baths work miracles. Try to not put it through too much stress, but stretch lightly. Some stretches to do are 45 degree squats and bringing your knee to your chest. If you feel pain stop. Don't try to push it because you'll only make it worse. I wish you a speedy recovery and good luck getting back to hockey."

Both rinks are very close to most guys homes. So I tend to think they (like me) just shower once you get home. Personally (as weird and unesacary as it sounds) I would shower again when I got home even if I showered after the game.

Whether or not that rink has a working shower and/or warm water is another matter. Our home games are 50-60 minutes away from the city we play out of...so most people shower at home games too.

hockeyplayers,3bjjki,buddhaplayshockey,3,Mon Jun 29 19:12:29 2015 UTC,"Figure out which part of the game you feel like you're hitting a wall with, then do things to help you improve in that area.  Not as fast as the other players? Work on improving your stride and increasing leg strength. Feel really tired after a couple shifts? Improve your endurance and look at ways to make your stride more efficient. Easily lose the puck or feel like you're not seeing open players? Puck handle while watching TV (especially if you have a carpal tunnel prone job, it's way too easy to lose feel). Shooting the puck into the goalie? Take lots of shots to improve the accuracy of your write shot, have someone help you see what the puck ""sees"". Goalies easily stopping your shots? Work on improving your shot form and shooting while skating.  About all the advice I can give you without either seeing footage or more specifics on your ""wall"". Time is hard to find, so focus on a single area at a time until you see it improve. Hard to improve everything at once."
hockeyplayers,3bjjki,dbcfd,2,Tue Jun 30 02:28:11 2015 UTC,"Have someone film you play, guarantee you'll instantly spot ten million things you need to fix. Sometimes that's all you need to find some motivation and get over the hump.  Off ice training will definitely help too. As you get older you  need to work out just to maintain conditioning, which means if you want to get stronger you have to work even harder."
hockeyplayers,3bjjki,xzzy,2,Mon Jun 29 21:57:13 2015 UTC,"Practice more. Try to sneak in puck times to get better at skating with your head up, shooting, passing (pick a spot on the boards and aim for it from different angles and distances, different heights for saucer passes, etc.). If you're into fitness, do dry land agility drills and sprints, set up some cones or something in your yard and do shuffles, fast feet, sprints, high knees, etc. Do drills while keeping your eyes/face focused on an object and just move your body around (similar to defense)."
hockeyplayers,3bjjki,Bloodgiver,2,Mon Jun 29 23:06:35 2015 UTC,"The easiest way to become a better player imo is to work on thinking the game better.  I try to always be super observant and make mental notes through out the game of who I'm playing against.  A simple example would be identifying which member of a defensive pair is the weaker skater.  Then you can improve your probability of sucess by simply attacking that player when deciding how to enter the offensive zone with the puck.  I tell people I play with that, playing without the puck is 90% of your game and so work on the little things with positioning.  If your in the offensive zone (or anywhere really) and your looking to get a pass, imagine there is a straight line between you and the puck carrier and so you want to focus on keeping that passing lane to you open by continually moving arround to open space.  Always make the defender covering you work harder then you, sooner or late he's gonna get caught staring down the puck and lose track of you."
hockeyplayers,3bjjki,yugtahtmi,3,Mon Jul 6 02:37:12 2015 UTC,"It sounds to me like you really love this sport. That's good. Let that motivation carry you. There's always off ice training if you don't do that already. Buy a net for the driveway and a shooting pad. They're relatively cheap and will help your game tremendously. I've found that distance running helps a lot. I started running 5-10 miles 5 days a week and now my endurance on the ice has tripled, if not, more. Let your passion for the game carry you. Best of luck! Hope you break through your wall!"
hockeyplayers,3bjjki,OGDavidBond,3,Mon Jun 29 19:23:23 2015 UTC,"I agree with the endurance training. For me personally, when I examine my first shift compared to my last, I'm way better when fresh. It's amazing how much your skill and technique deteriorate when you get tired."
hockeyplayers,3bjjki,EchoTango77,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:51:27 2015 UTC,"All great advice! I reflect alot and I was getting beat by faster players my last few games. . So speed will be the first thing I work on. After a couple of rushes, I was gassed. So endurance will be the next step. I'm not in horrible shape but could always get better in that department. I'm pretty strong and its hard to move me off the puck, at least that's what I've been told.  I don't really think when I'm playing, I just play. Film is a great idea but... I don't really want to see the ugly. Maybe I'll give film a try and have another player film me. All good ideas."
hockeyplayers,3bjjki,dbcfd,2,Tue Jun 30 02:44:20 2015 UTC,"If it's losing rushes to a loose puck, make sure you're going down and forward rather than forward or up/forward. You lose a lot in your push that way, and most likely you've come out of your stance by that point as the play is occurring.  Strengthening your legs will help both open ice and rushes to a loose puck."
hockeyplayers,3bjj4q,modtrax,2,Mon Jun 29 19:09:28 2015 UTC,"Head up, don't be afraid to skate with the puck, make hard passes but be careful not to sauce them too much, when receiving a pass, put some pressure down on the stick because it's coming harder than you think, try to get at least 1 shot off during the game, and most importantly enjoy yourself."
hockeyplayers,3bjj4q,Lndbrghwrstlr,1 point,Mon Jun 29 23:59:51 2015 UTC,Get to the front of the net. Even the least skilled players can bang a rebound into an open net.
hockeyplayers,3bjj4q,Hurricane_Viking,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:20:14 2015 UTC,Best way to minimize turnovers if you are still building skill is real simple. Pass. And make it snappy. Especially once you join a league. Its OK to practice moving with the puck during pickup but once you get to a league passing will win games and make your teamates like you
hockeyplayers,3bjj4q,orionthefisherman,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:05:28 2015 UTC,"Defensive zone:   Don't just throw the puck down the ice. If you have room skate with it. Look for a outlet pass to someone cutting up the middle near the blue line. If you have nowhere to go, chip the puck out and off the boards at an angle as not to ice it.   Offensive zone:   If you have the puck near the net, shoot. If you have no shot, then look to see if anyone is open. If not throw it towards the net, it could bounce in. If it's pickup the guys u play with should be nice enough to give u a little extra time with th puck."
hockeyplayers,3bjj4q,jking1285,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:37:04 2015 UTC,"If you're being told to play the corners then the coach wants you to rough up some guys and get the puck. To minimize turnovers keep the puck in close to your body. Don't be afraid to dump the puck into the corner and chase it. And don't be afraid to sacrifice your body to get the puck to the point. Keep your head up in the corner. Don't look down at all times for the puck, somebody will undoubtedly come from behind and hit you face first so always be aware. Aside from that, stick on the ice to block all passes on the ice and remember basics like that. Best of luck!"
hockeyplayers,3bj3fs,el_karacho,12,Mon Jun 29 17:17:43 2015 UTC,"The first advice you received is solid. No need to chase guys in the corner as they literally can't hurt you there or behind the net. However if you were to chase them, it sets up all sorts of scenarios, none of which usually end well. Stay within the dots. -Work opposing forwards outside.  - Talk with your goalie prior to the game to establish some communication between you two. Find out when he wants you to take the guy with the shot or pass (most of the time he should want the shot), or let him have it. Tell him to yell if you are screening him.  - pay attention to other forwards from hips to shoulders. Don't watch the puck on their stick the whole time, and don't necessarily watch their head movements. - don't give away your entire reach and poke to an opposing forward right away. Let him think he has more space and room, then use your added reach and poke to your advantage. -never clear the pick through the middle. Always go high and off the glass. - never pass in front of your goalie, or really up through the middle. Use the boards, and yell your forwards to always keep their feet moving. - don't pinch on offense unless you are 100% sure you can get back, or a forward has you covered. Even then, it I'll advised for newer defenseman. - always make good hard passes. No softies.  - give and go's with your d partner are an easy and great way to create space and start the rush. - make guys uneasy in front of the net. I'm not saying goon it up, or take a bad penalty. However you can ""drape"" yourself over the defender and sonewhat get tangled up to the point where its not an interference penalty, but he doesn't have free roam. Pitchfork him around with your stick. Anything to not just let him camp in front . - stick on ice at all times."

If the pucks already past you, just worry about the body. He can't get to the puck if you're in front of him. It's not interference as long as your not tying him up for a long time. Just stand your ground and don't let him past you."

That was one thing about baseball I enjoyed, some teams just had guys that liked fucking around. I remember there would always be a guy at first who would shoot the shit as we all stood around waiting for something to happen in baseball. And I can remember my fair share of times watching guys on other teams stand in the box with our self-deprecating catcher, trying to pay attention as he kindly asked them to either strike out, or hit a home run, because he's too fat to do any real running for a ball.   I can't wait to start playing some hockey."
hockeyplayers,3bj3fs,OGDavidBond,2,Tue Jun 30 03:34:45 2015 UTC,"When playing a 1 on 1, if he's coming down on you, the first advice comes into play here. Don't go past the dots, as it gives him an option to go in the middle. You want to force him wide. Make him either skate behind the net, take a very bad angle shot, or you can then put him into the boards.  Now 1 on 1 battles on the boards, stay low, use your legs to keep him pinned and wait for help from your center.   Don't always focus on hitting. If you can poke the puck off his stick, do it. It usually takes less time and you can go the other direction to start a rush."

Skate hard, but be extra attentive to how long your shifts are. A lot of guys get caught out there a lot longer than they should. Keep it short and hard and you'll feel a lot better and be more  effective.  The times when you ""conserve"" are at whistles. Couple of strides and glide back for an icing, or over to the bench for a change. If you're going to dog it during the play, keep it slower when leaving your own end, not when backchecking.  I don't really do too much for warmups between games. You should be pretty loose and ready to rock and roll. Stretch out your legs a little bit if you've been sitting 10-15 mins, but otherwise focus on warming up your goalie instead of dicking around like normal."

In my second game, because I was tired, I took shorter shifts.... this is actually what you're supposed to do. I ended up getting in a really good rhythm and I think my second game was better than my first! So my advice is short shifts, get off the ice when you're gassed and you'll be ready.  Also, water is good, but if you drink too much too fast you might get cramps, so I prefer to just take a few sips as soon as I get back on the bench."

hockeyplayers,3bisw8,itanitarek10,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:00:36 2015 UTC,"We had to play a double header for our league championship this last session. The game to get into the championship our team was up 3-2 with about 4 minutes left. The refs called a bad penalty and said our defender covered the puck in the crease and gave the other team a penalty shot. The guy coverts and it's tied 3-3. With 7 seconds left in the game our captain took an outlet pass and snuck one past a goalie to give us the win and prevent overtime.   The championship the other team was fresh and we were going into our second game. I would suggest trying to jump on the other team early and play solid defensively. We were down 2-0 after the first period. We were tired and they weren't. We knew the next goal would be huge so we were gonna push hard in the second. We scored early in the 2nd. A minute later the same guy on the same shift scored a second and we tied it 2-2. A few minutes later I met the third and we were up 3-2. We scored the 4th and were up 4-2 after the second but then gave up 3 in the 3rd and had nothing left and lost 5-4.   I would suggest playing both games as hard as you can and to win. If you are blowing the other team out or are getting blown out ease up, but you will go into the second game with that mentality as well. The best suggestion is to keep shifts at around 45-1 minute. Skate up, skate down and then get off. It'll help save energy."
hockeyplayers,3bisw8,F0rdo,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:35:00 2015 UTC,one thing I haven't seen mentioned is passing. how well your team passes can help alleviate fatigue by making the puck skate for you. also try and eat oranges in between games and stay hydrated
hockeyplayers,3bisw8,hypnocomment,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:02:49 2015 UTC,"I usually play 2-3 games Sunday nights (my normal league game, along with sparing for two other teams) I find I usually play best during my second game. A couple beers when the Zamboni is on the ice works magic."
hockeyplayers,3bisw8,digifxplus,1 point,Mon Jun 29 22:02:28 2015 UTC,"I do them all the time. You just have to be smart about how you play. Don't chase a low percentage puck. Don't try and make all the moves yourself, pass and use your teammates.   I wouldn't drink two bottles of water. That'll probably slow you down. At least I know it would slow me down.   Make sure you eat well before the game. Lots of carbs."

hockeyplayers,3bisw8,tehReno,1 point,Wed Jul 1 05:43:58 2015 UTC,I've done acouple from tournaments. Do you have a game inbetween yours and the next one you play or is it a straight play 2 games in a row. I would bring some gatoraide and a bag a skittles or a couple energy bars.
hockeyplayers,3bisw8,whatthefrickenfrack,0,Wed Jul 1 20:56:25 2015 UTC,Definitely don't go easy. That's not fair to yourself or your teammates. Find some extra energy to get you through both games and as always leave it all out on the ice. Your coaches will be more fond of you and it's always good to make sure your coaches like you. I have played a few double headers and you'll definitely need a nice ice bath after. Good luck in your games!
hockeyplayers,3bh4pd,dylanvansandt,2,Mon Jun 29 04:24:03 2015 UTC,"New to the sport as well, if you look on the right you will see tabs for beginners guides and equipment guides that can give you the baseline for everything you will need, as well as the advice being your best bet to try everything on. If not there are sizing charts, and totalhockey.com is great for exchanges. Only tried my skates on in person, got them baked and its been going good so far!"
hockeyplayers,3bh4pd,Nicholasagn,1 point,Mon Jun 29 12:36:20 2015 UTC,"Sorry for the noobie-ness, but what does getting skates baked mean?"
hockeyplayers,3bh4pd,boxcutter3005,2,Mon Jun 29 13:58:02 2015 UTC,"Modern skates have a heat moldable foam built in to the skates. While they will eventually conform to the shape of your foot overtime during normal break in, they are designed to be baked in a special oven at skate shops at time of purchase, then you put them on and lace them up immediately out of the ovenn and keep em on for 30ish minutes. Once the process is done, its like skipping most of the break in period."
hockeyplayers,3bh4pd,Skyline_BNR34,1 point,Mon Jun 29 14:32:42 2015 UTC,"Higher end slates do, not all models in a skate line are actually heat moldable.  Would need to look at the box to see if they are when purchasing new skates."
hockeyplayers,3bh4pd,Nicholasagn,2,Thu Jul 2 06:26:22 2015 UTC,"As the other two said, its essentially heating the skate. The material the skate is made of is more flexible when heated up ( My place heated my skates at 200F for about 5-7 minutes) They pop out of the oven and you strap them on your feet as tight as they can go. This helps form the skate more to your foot, and decreases the break in time. Helps since not everyones feet are the same, giving a more personal touch."
hockeyplayers,3bh4pd,OGDavidBond,1 point,Mon Jun 29 15:03:26 2015 UTC,"They put skates into an oven so they heat up and mold to your foot. It's not required by any means but it gives you a nice customization and feel. They will mold to your feet over time, however it's better to get them baked when you get them. You can do it at the pro shop at your local rink."
hockeyplayers,3bh4pd,OGDavidBond,2,Mon Jun 29 14:34:14 2015 UTC,"Totalhockey.com and discounthockey.com have great deals on hockey equipment if you shop for them. Since you'll be joining a b league, I wouldn't go for high end, expensive equipment, but you don't want crappy gear. You will need a helmet, shoulder pads, elbow pads, gloves, pants, shin guards, sticks (a few, as they will break unexpectedly), and of course skates. Don't go with lesser known brands because they may be cheaper. Stick with Bauer, CCM, Easton, Reebok, Warrior, ect. You probably want to go to your local rink's pro shop to get fitted since you're relatively new. Most of all, stick with it. You will have rough patches and droughts, but don't give up and you'll be happy with you're progress. As always, best of luck to you!"

hockeyplayers,3bf7o5,modtrax,13,Sun Jun 28 18:08:28 2015 UTC,"Sigh.   This type of thing drives me nuts too.  As believer that Stick & Puck should be just that, and that alone.... No pick-up games should be going on when there's an obscene amount of people on the ice. Just hazardous as all hell, double for beginners of any age. When there's maybe like 10-15 guys out there, that's cool, I'm all for that. Half ice using the neutral zone as a buffer zone for stick-handling, and the other end for shooting. But after years of playing in various cities (in the US), it appears to be normal. Particularly cities with a limited number of rinks.  Get off my lawn."
hockeyplayers,3bf7o5,ImosPizza,2,Sun Jun 28 18:25:27 2015 UTC,my first and only stick & puck there was a high school team using the neutral zone (lengthwise) to play a pick up game. got knocked on my ass by one of them.  haven't been to a stick & puck since :\
hockeyplayers,3bf7o5,VAEQBkBrf3jyf4,2,Sun Jun 28 20:02:00 2015 UTC,"Sounds like a two part failure by the rink: they should've limited the number of skaters and they should have and enforce a ""no pickup during stick and puck"" rule."

They just became part of the game (sort of like a water hazard in golf) that you had to avoid. I was sure we would have some major collisions but it never happened.   Everyone just accepted things and it worked. If you were ready to score but the kid was too close to the net, your bad luck - throw the puck in the corner and try next time.  35 seems awfully busy tho"
hockeyplayers,3bf7o5,Zednix,1 point,Sun Jun 28 19:31:18 2015 UTC,Quite a lot of the outdoor rinks in Edmonton have a secondary ice surface that is more akin to a pond so people can take their young children on there safely away from the hockey being played. Everyone wins that way.
hockeyplayers,3bf7o5,_mph11,1 point,Sun Jun 28 20:09:14 2015 UTC,I actually enjoyed dangling around the young kids. Good practice. I was way more concerned about them skating in front of shots. Kids like that just aren't that aware yet.
hockeyplayers,3bf7o5,Grumpypickles,1 point,Sun Jun 28 20:42:48 2015 UTC,"I went to a stick and puck on Saturday that ended up being really frustrating. At the start were probably 6 kids and 4 adults. Seems like a good number of people.  Kids got one half, adults got one half.   About 10mins into it, a group of 4 women came on the ice. And being a female myself I don't have anything against them. But they just stood in front of the net talking/behind the net/rolling on the ground and not really doing anything to get out of the way for the rest of us to shoot around. Almost hit them a few times too. Then they started running horseshoe drills taking up the entire half of the ice but not allowing the rest of us to take-part.  All of us just ended up wandering over to the kids side, and center ice. Just frustrating that they had no awareness of anything going around them. Sorry vent over."

It can be scary, some guy started working on his slapshot from the blue line and almost tagged a six year old in the head.  He was doing this with close to 40 skaters on the ice.  Sheesh.

If you still don't want a cage just take the screws out at the top, but be sure to put them right back in after you take the cage out because if you don't then the padding in the helmet can move around and wearing a helmet wouldn't be practical at that point."

A general rule is that the flex should be about 1/2 of your body weight for a nice bend in your shot. I wouldn't go with intermediate because they're typically for the middle school into high school type players that are between sizes and don't want to spend a ton of money on senior gear that they will quickly outgrow."

hockeyplayers,3be4wc,perkiezombie,1 point,Sun Jun 28 13:54:06 2015 UTC,Where are you based? Your local rink will have instructors you can have private lessons with.
hockeyplayers,3be4wc,spintheiryarns,2,Sun Jun 28 18:42:12 2015 UTC,"I found that I progress a LOT faster even in a generic group skating lesson versus working on my own. Hockey skills clinics are great and I will probably join one as well, but I prefer to have some time devoted purely to skating--there are so many things for me to focus on already without bringing gameplay into it."
hockeyplayers,3be4wc,OzziePao13,2,Sun Jun 28 13:11:26 2015 UTC,"This. While you essentially want to do both. Skating is the fundamental building block. You won't get near the instruction on proper technique, and how to maximize everything in a learn to play hockey class.  Learn to skate properly. Get comfortable with it. Then take a hockey fundamentals class."
hockeyplayers,3be4wc,rfinger1337,1 point,Sun Jun 28 13:28:45 2015 UTC,"For hockey, take a hockey skills class. It will have a lot of skating (everything is really a skating class), but also shooting, passing, positioning, etc..."
hockeyplayers,3be4wc,mjspaz,1 point,Sun Jun 28 12:21:07 2015 UTC,"Definitely the class man!  So I've been skating most of my life, but I was never great at it. When I finally hunkered down earlier this year and decided I wanted to play, I was an OK skater. After about two months of lessons once a week? I'm one of the best skaters on my team, and it's just the rest of my game that needs to catch up.  The way I see it, the better you become at skating, the less you think about moving around, and the more mental processes you have to focus on actual gameplay."
hockeyplayers,3be4wc,uberla92,1 point,Sun Jun 28 13:37:54 2015 UTC,Definitely take a class. Nothing will motivate you more than improving to impress your coach and hear that praise.

hockeyplayers,3be4wc,TheFuckNameYouWant,1 point,Sun Jun 28 19:07:29 2015 UTC,"Definitely a class. I learned to skate very young, and got pretty good my first 3 years.

You'll learn proper technique, how to stop, etc.   It will be worth far more than you'll ever pay for. Do it!!"

hockeyplayers,3bh08p,RDC123,2,Mon Jun 29 03:55:30 2015 UTC,"Not sure what you're noticing as different then. Hockey players have always been cliche machines with very little 'personality' in interviews. I'd say it comes from the team over individual mindset the sport requires. I can't think of anyone who was a big media personality 10-15 years ago, I'd say there's way more personality in the game than there has ever been."

hockeyplayers,3bh08p,Psychotic_Ninja,2,Mon Jun 29 06:05:10 2015 UTC,"Because with the way things are going, you never know:  A) who you will play with next month, or the near future.  B) there are internal rules, both written (contractual or team rules) and unwritten that you shouldn't cross. These often include how you portray yourselves to the media and how you interact with them. Some people are characters for sure, but most people rather keep quiet and focus on playing. Its a damn long season, and it passes much quicker when you are not under tons of scrutiny for some comment you make in the heat of the moment.   The last thing teams want is you running your mouth and providing a huge distraction for the rest of the  team. This is often why the interview about character pre-draft or even pre-signing plays a significant part in the evaluation of players."
hockeyplayers,3bh08p,OGDavidBond,2,Mon Jun 29 23:11:41 2015 UTC,"Hockey players talk more trash, and talk it better, than any other sport. The difference is, our culture, much like Rugby's, is very much in house, and very much for the boys.  We don't talk shit in the media, or for non-pros, on social media or behind backs. We're all fighting in the same ice for the same puck, and that fight, and all it's accompaniments, stay on that ice, as do our accomplishments. Everything in this game is a team effort, even if it isn't.  There is nothing to miss. Hockey players have always been stoic and robotic with the media. Boastfulness, and brash, cocky attitudes get adjusted in this sport, and the sheer amount of work it takes for the average player to make the show pretty much guarantee humble players.   ALL OF WHICH IS A GOOD THING. NFL, NBA, and soccer players should shut the fuck up and play their games. Let their deeds to the talking, and pump up the boys more. One of the best parts of this game is that all of the expression is on the ice."
hockeyplayers,3bcqxb,go_bolts,7,Sat Jun 27 23:58:19 2015 UTC,"Man, it varies so much. Just check out their website or email the club director. There's no taboo in saying, ""hey, I'm interested in joining, but I'm wondering what the registration fees are."""

hockeyplayers,3bcqxb,SlimmerThanYourShady,3,Sun Jun 28 00:58:02 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately being totally realistic, if you just started playing, most likely the level of play would be too advanced for you. I've been playing hockey since I was 5. Although I never played at a super high level, I would consider myself an advanced player, however I would not stand a chance making my university team. Everyone plays at least some form of high level junior hockey. However that's my own experience with a Canadian university, it may be different depending on the division your college plays in. Also skating is only one component of hockey. You need puck handling skills, proper technique, and probably most importantly you need good hockey sense and awareness with and without the puck. Im just letting you know from what I've seen of college level hockey, but don't let my own experience totally sway you. If you're serious about playing for your college, try and get as much practice in (on and off ice) and go for it. It can never hurt to at least try out I suppose."

If it's 2 or 3 you should be fine, although the top teams in Division 2 play very good hockey. Div 1 you might have to pass on. Some teams are so desperate for players though that they'll take somebody who isn't as good in hopes that they will improve and fill a roster spot."

hockeyplayers,3bcqxb,spintheiryarns,1 point,Sun Jun 28 02:20:58 2015 UTC,Thanks! Ill update this post in a couple months with how it goes
hockeyplayers,3bcqxb,kingofthediamond,2,Sun Jun 28 02:23:00 2015 UTC,"I played college club hockey at a very small liberal arts college in central Ohio. The league had 8 teams from Ohio and West Virginia schools (most also small liberal arts). The skill level both between teams and between players on teams varied greatly. The size of the schools really had a lot to do with that because the clubs didn't really have enough players interested to cut anybody.  It was a lot of fun, though it definitely should not have been full contact because of that skill variation. It basically should have been a no check beer league for college kids. The cost of playing for the season was relatively inexpensive going by beer league standards. I think I remember paying $150 for 16 or so games. That also varied widely between schools, depending on how good the team was at getting money from the school.  I'd try to contact the captain of your club team (you can call the school's athletic department or try to find contact info on the school's website) to get more information."
hockeyplayers,3bcqxb,kingofthediamond,2,Sun Jun 28 00:09:01 2015 UTC,"I played D2 at a small private school. Absolutely loved it. Got to play competitive hockey and travel to play other schools. Made so many great friends. Skill level wasn't crazy high but our top players were either junior players or D3 transfers. The rest of us just played A/AA growing up. It can get much more competitive than that, just not our region.   As for cost, it really depended on the year. We got funding from our school's student organization and alumni donations. I think the most I paid was $750 and the least $250 for a year. Which was awesome considering travel hockey was usually anywhere from $3-5K.   In the end, it can't hurt to try out. Hell, our team didn't even have try outs since we were so short for players some years. Hopefully you can make it man. I miss every second of my college hockey days. Enjoy college."

Outside of dues we're funded by the college, but we mostly play within a women's rec league--not against other college teams."

hockeyplayers,3bcqxb,SeanP21,3,Sun Jun 28 01:22:43 2015 UTC,"Our regular scheduled goalie ""forgot to tell us"" that he left his pads 300 miles away at home until about 20 minutes before the game. We called our backup who never showed up because if he wasn't playing he didn't want to show up. We called him and he said he couldn't play because he was drunk at a party. We couldn't afford to forfeit the game so we insisted on him showing up.  His girlfriend (sober) drove him. He was fairly hammered and stumbling. The other team took 15 shots and our tendy made 3 saves. literally only 3! Two of the three he was just in the way and 1 was actually a decent save. One of the goals, the guy shoots high glove and about 10 seconds after the puck is in the net and the ref signaled the goal the goalie did the ""windmill save"". I was on the ice and he says to me ""damn that shot came in so fast"". We lost 9-1... The ref gave us pity not making the score 12-1"

Was on a very good team in a competitive league, and even scrimmaged a D3 school once in preseason. Skill and commitment levels vary pretty drastically, as well as fees, but if you have the means definitely join the squad. There's nothing like the friendships built in a locker room, and those are even more fun during college."
hockeyplayers,3bcqxb,rohlinxeg,2,Sun Jun 28 01:52:58 2015 UTC,"Depends on the schools, but there probably are some standards for what level players should be at (if you're in the US at least).  I played club hockey for my run of the mill Community College, and most of the guys grew up playing.  I'd compare it to AA or A level Bantam, or pretty high beer league.  Other University club teams are much more competitive, and could probably hang with some D3 varsity programs.  Though outside of major hockey states, I could see it being more of a recreational thing."
hockeyplayers,3bcqxb,SoBeefy,2,Sun Jun 28 02:05:14 2015 UTC,"Its miles between teams so without knowing the school you can't really say. some teams are small and take anyone and would be an average beer league team and you have some teams with over 100 kids trying out and they're good enough to beat some NCAA teams. Id say find out who runs the club, maybe send an email and bring your gear to school. Tryouts are probably like the 2nd or 3rd week of school and just go for it"

hockeyplayers,3bcqxb,pixleight,2,Sun Jun 28 02:33:26 2015 UTC,"Id say get on the ice at least once or twice a week and try to hit some weights. 70% of the kids who try out haven't played more than a few times since the end of their high school and spent the last 6 months drinking. take advantage, good luck"
hockeyplayers,3bcqxb,pixleight,2,Sun Jun 28 03:16:20 2015 UTC,"Just go try out and find out if they'll accept you or not.  They'll cut you if you're not up to par. Which it might suck, but it also can be a good motivating goal to improve.  For example, I've played since I was 4, but I stopped when I was 14. Then I re-started 6-7 years later. The first time I tried out, flat-out no. The next year, I made the team but then played in the first series and after putting me in a game situation realized it might be too dangerous for myself.  That said, they let me practice with them this past year and it has helped my skills improve a lot.  Maybe this year I'll be able to play in all the games too, but if I'm only practicing (red-shirting) I'm fine with that too, you can red-shirt as many years as you want in the ACHA provided you're still in school and since you can play well into grad-school it might not be a bad idea provided you're going to grad school."

hockeyplayers,3bcy7v,shelvedtopcheese,3,Mon Jun 29 07:04:28 2015 UTC,"Maybe this is the wrong thing to say, but honestly even with my immense love for the game I can get burnt out. I think sometimes it can be good to cut back on the number of skates you're going to in order to rediscover some passion.   Maybe if you drop one or two of your pickup games you find yourself wanting to get on the ice for the power skate. Alternatively, the power skate is grinding you out, so try to get a partial refund and go mainly to pickups for a few weeks.   The worst thing you can do is push through and make yourself even less enthusiastic. Maybe it also would help if you told yourself going in, ""Hey I'm going to skate for as long as I'm feeling it, and when I start to find this tedious I'm just going to pack it in and that will be OK.""   It sounds like you're putting in some serious work, so cutting back an hour or two a week won't likely impact your game tremendously. After spending this past winter coaching and watching a lot of kids play, it's the quality of your ice time that is more important than the quantity. When you lose the fire, the quality and focus always goes down."

Next season is my senior year and I really want to win the championship and go to states. This past season we lost in the first round of playoffs and it was extremely saddening to realize that you'll never get to play with most of the guys on the same team again because the seniors graduate. I want to try and make this upcoming season last as long as possible. I recently started seriously working out off-ice in order to be the in the best shape possible by the time the season comes around. I'd say that my role is going to be pretty important this season as I'll be the lone senior defenseman. I started working out mostly because other people were. People that I would be competing against. These people are working on getting bigger, faster, and stronger while I'm sitting on my couch. So I decided to join them and not only work like them, but work harder. When you're not trying to become better at something, other people are. So I decided I'm going to be the best next year. I told myself that I'll make the first team in the county. I know it sounds corny, but the only person that could deter me from my goal is myself.

We were a D-pair when I learned that his cancer was getting really bad. We played out the travel season and some post and once that was over I came home from work, checked facebook, and saw the news that he had passed. It knocked me down pretty hard hearing someone who has played with you for so long and then in his last season you were his partner. I wound up taking some time off to come back from some injuries and when cleared I wasn't motivated. I was able to still play the game but something was missing you know? I had no drive really. I only got really motivated again after moving away to college in a small town with one rink. A few of our friends heard that my roomate and I play and they wanted to watch. We took them to a pick up game and after they were surprised at us saying that we looked like we were in our natural habitat. This got me motivated again just knowing that some people thought it was really cool that I played and was psyched to let them come watch us play. They started going to the beer league games and cheering which was pretty funny. I still keep my buddy's NEGU and in memory sticker on my helmet so I always have a little something."

You can buy some special sports cleaning soaps or just use normal detergent. If you want a more thorough clean, before you put them to wash you can try to scrub out some of the sweat stains mannually. The reason I don't put my gloves in is because the last time I did, the palms seemed to harden up every time they were dried. They didn't go back to a soft state and they always felt rough. I can only assume that it happen after I washed them. To deal with my gloves, I put baking powder in them, you can also do this for your skates too. As for my helmet, I don't do anything, I just air it out."

I just threw my stuff in the washing machine for the first time since I got most of it (so about 9 months or so) and it killed most of the stink. Everything except my helmet and skates. Just used normal detergent.

Air drying is fine (and should happen after every wear), but I've never had good luck with air drying in the sun (always smells worse). I always wonder if this promotes bacteria growth."

hockeyplayers,3bd1mr,EricJ17,1 point,Sun Jun 28 01:47:40 2015 UTC,"you haven't provided enough information to really diagnose your problem.   the nose-chin height range is largely a matter of preference and a rough guide. the height your hands are off the ground isn't a good way to measure stick height because you bend at the knees and waist significantly when you're in a skating position.   you may have created a weird lie by adding a plug, but it's hard to say without seeing you holding it first hand.   finally, any time you make changes to the size or specs of your equipment you're going to have an adjustment period."

hockeyplayers,3bcxcd,TehRhawb,3,Sun Jun 28 01:02:41 2015 UTC,"In my LTP classes they separated the skill levels- beginner, Intermediate, Advanced. Some of the advanced skaters were similar to you. Returning former players. Just as you said, they use it as a ""practice"" and, for where I do it at least, it's relatively cheap ice time.  I like that you get coaches putting you through drills and you can focus on skills you may not think about just going to S&P by yourself. I say it's worth it, if not too expensive.  Typical segments of each class: Skating, Passing, Shooting, ""team"" full ice drill... and then 30 min Pick-up. Each one had a coach running you through drills. Worth it for me.

After a year of playing intramurals and beer league, I went to a week-long hockey camp meant for pewees/bantams (Planet Hockey).  As far as skill development went, that was absolutely perfect for what I needed at the time. That said, the age gap was kind of awkward, thankfully the coaches let me share their locker room with them to alleviate that problem.  I'd talk to the camp instructors to see if they're willing to accommodate you before signing up to any of these types of camps.  That said there are definitely times where you need to be careful not to overwhelm people with your size when it's relevant."

hockeyplayers,3bbvs1,Skibz,12,Sat Jun 27 19:08:56 2015 UTC,"You just need to keep practicing your footwork. Some players have their sticks cut so short they could puck handle in a phone booth, but there's still no better way to get a puck out from your feet than kicking it.   Try skating around the rink with the puck and let it just slow down until it's in between your feet and kick it out with the inside of one of your skates. Keep working on that and just skating in general and you'll get the hang of those loose pucks."
hockeyplayers,3bbvs1,Psomatic,2,Sat Jun 27 19:13:23 2015 UTC,"Also when it comes to actually doing the kicking, make sure all your weight is over on your other leg, and bend that knee. Helps you shift over quick and stay on that leg as long as necessary"
hockeyplayers,3bbvs1,Lndbrghwrstlr,4,Sun Jun 28 00:51:02 2015 UTC,"here's what I teach beginners. you rarely see the pros lose the puck at their feat because they are always moving! keep those feat moving and it'll keep you out of that spot :-)  that being said, the easiest way to find is to realize if you can't see it then it probably is at your feat (or behind you). easiest way to solve that is to move your body rather than the puck. taking in the direction step away from the puck that will leave the puck on your forehand and slightly in front of you. chances are you've found the puck and are in a position to pass it."
hockeyplayers,3bbvs1,enkafan,2,Sat Jun 27 21:26:10 2015 UTC,"A drill I did when I was just starting was to skate around the rink while stick handling, then let the puck fall off my stick and kick it back up to my stick.

hockeyplayers,3bbvs1,morgantheron,1 point,Sun Jun 28 10:03:19 2015 UTC,"Look at Crosby, I think he has the best feet in the nhl. Very deep knee bend, uses a very short stick and is often in the ""heel to heel"" position which gives more options."

hockeyplayers,3bbvs1,the5thLight,2,Sat Jun 27 23:38:14 2015 UTC,"Also known as the ""10-and-2"" position, it allows the skater options with which foot to accelerate. Think figure skating, but with accelerative power.  As others have implied, puck control begins with your feet, not your hands or your stick. Nobody says you have to control the puck in the direction you're facing. Work on your balance and your leg strength, and the puck control will follow."
hockeyplayers,3bbvs1,lernington,1 point,Sat Jun 27 23:45:04 2015 UTC,"This is something that develops with your skating.  As your footwork gets better, you'll become more comfortable kicking it up to your twig.  Eventually, you'll even be able to angle your skate when the puck impacts it so that it deflects right to where you want it.  You can practice kicking deflections and what not at stick and puck sessions, and these scenarios are the reason why I like to warm up with a soccer ball."
hockeyplayers,3bbvs1,Hurricane_Viking,1 point,Sun Jun 28 02:10:34 2015 UTC,If you have a green biscuit/golf ball then you can practice at home kicking the puck up to your stick while walking around. If you need to control the puck in close make sure you slide your bottom hand down on the stick and get your top hand away from your body.
hockeyplayers,3bbvs1,OGDavidBond,0,Mon Jun 29 19:09:02 2015 UTC,"The way you hold the stick can affect it too. Try not to have your top hand anchored on your hip. That's a mistake many new players make. Also make sure you move your bottom hand down low when picking a puck out of your skates. If balance is an issue you can always resort to stepping on top of it and pushing it out. Very unorthodox, but hey, whatever works right?"

I will, at least twice a season, wash all my gear in the machine. Except for helmet and skates, all hockey gear can be washed in a front-loaded machine.  I don't use detergent, but I do use either Borax or Oxyclean, with hot water. Be sure to also wash your bag.  When I was younger, I had skin issues from my gear.

hockeyplayers,3b81ea,_ThatGuyWithTheFace_,3,Fri Jun 26 18:55:51 2015 UTC,"Great so far. I used them for the past whole winter season and two tournaments this spring. The only problem I've ever had is the laces they come with breaking too easily. I think they snapped after two weeks. I'm just nitpicking here, but the boot is great. They have the perfect amount of stiffness and are really light. I would highly recommend."
hockeyplayers,3b81ea,Squrmander123,3,Fri Jun 26 19:00:33 2015 UTC,"I was actually thinking of getting these tomorrow, and you've just convinced me! Thanks!"
hockeyplayers,3b81ea,_ThatGuyWithTheFace_,2,Fri Jun 26 20:20:16 2015 UTC,No problem. Let me know how you like them after you use them.
hockeyplayers,3b81ea,DicNavis,1 point,Fri Jun 26 21:06:20 2015 UTC,"Can confirm.  I love my 180's.  Durability is great.  I have a full year in them and other than a few rub marks on the inside wear my ankles rub, they're in great shape.  If you're buying a skate with replaceable steel, it is made to hold up for longer than the life of the steel... So that's a good place to start for durability."
hockeyplayers,3b81ea,stevegcook,5,Sat Jun 27 23:16:49 2015 UTC,"I'd go with the 190s.  They're practically identical except for a couple of ""high-tech"" features which barely do anything."
hockeyplayers,3b81ea,Fireonahill,1 point,Fri Jun 26 20:28:57 2015 UTC,agreed. plus the felt tongue feels nicer and the ls3 is better steel than the fusion
hockeyplayers,3b81ea,i_m_a_g_i_n_e,2,Mon Jun 29 00:32:14 2015 UTC,"Get the 190's. I really don't think the extra $150 translates into a better performing skate. You still get the main features from the mx3. The tongue on the 190 (same as apx2) is more traditional than the mx3 tongue which I never found too comfortable. At the end of the day, the biggest difference is the tongue and the liner on the inside. Enjoy your skates!!  :)"
hockeyplayers,3b81ea,i_m_a_g_i_n_e,1 point,Sat Jun 27 03:00:45 2015 UTC,Thanks for the advice. I'm going to my LHS tomorrow to try both skates on. I'll make the decision then. Have you skated with the MX3s?
hockeyplayers,3b81ea,Jthedude17,2,Sat Jun 27 03:23:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I've tried both the 190's and MX3's and I didn't notice much of a difference. The liner on the MX3's was a little more comfortable but I was definitely a big fan of the tongue on the 190. That being said, I'm a little biased because I used to have APX2's so the tongue felt a little more familiar for me.  I ended up choosing the 1X's over the MX3's though cause I liked the fit a little bit more, but that's cause I have a pretty narrow foot."

hockeyplayers,3b8ba6,shelvedtopcheese,2,Sun Jun 28 13:54:31 2015 UTC,Shin guard protection really stops at the top of the knee. There's a little flap to minimize pucks finding the shin/pant gap but it's not going to be substantial thigh protection in any shin guards.  Get more protective pants.
hockeyplayers,3b8ba6,kr580,2,Fri Jun 26 20:06:58 2015 UTC,"I don't think your problem is that your shin guards are too small, but rather they might be too loose. The Pro Series generally don't have a ton of straps on them so they might be banging around on the area above your knee more than some of the other shin guards out there. I'm of course assuming you are talking about that area and not all the way up on your thighs.   Really it sounds like you almost have to hit up a proshop and try some on and talk to them there about sizing. Each brand will be different from each other, and hell each model within the brand differ significantly."

hockeyplayers,3b7aki,yacadelic,4,Sat Jun 27 01:36:59 2015 UTC,"Goalies look at the puck. Always. The whole game.  (Yes, you need to know where the pass may go, but it's a very fast glance). Talk to the D.  Don't let them screen you, point out the open man (""get your man"" usually works), tell them if there is someone near them (""one on""). Challenge.  A good rule of thumb is that your skates should be on the outside line of the crease for anything that isn't directly to the side of the net. If it is, hug the post. Don't get lazy.  Keep your glove up (shooters love to see a hole where the glove should be, don't show it if you aren't prepared to catch it).  Stay down in your stance the whole time the puck is in the zone. you cant' do anything from a standing position - yes it's tiring, but it's mandatory. Draw an imaginary line through the puck and center post of the net.  The center of your chest should be right in that line. Square up to the puck, don't cheat and turn or leave early expecting the pass. Playing the puck is hard, avoid it if you are struggling (you may duff it and have to stop the breakaway you just created) it's OK to make your D come back for it. Don't do too much.  It doesn't matter what you use to stop the puck or where the rebound goes, the first priority is the save. If you can control the rebound that's great, but don't miss the puck because you were trying something fancy. Control the rebound! In order of importance:  Catch, freeze, deflect out of play, corner, to the D.    The only save that matters is the next one.  Don't worry about letting in soft goals, getting stunned by a showoff move, screwed because the D didn't get the guy on the back door... make the next save."

hockeyplayers,3b6sbg,MF26,1 point,Fri Jun 26 21:44:15 2015 UTC,"I have the same problem with that cage. I should have bought a size larger helmet and adjusted the front to back shorter on the helmet. My head is apparently too wide and so the helmet hurts near my temples.  Your league might not allow it, but I have found some relief by taking the ear hole protectors out of the helmet.  If I remember right, it's just 3 screws on each side to take them out and it will give you an extra ~.5cm on each side at the exact spot you're hurting.   This has helped me a lot. It's not perfect, but is better/more comfortable.  Obviously, if this isn't allowed in your league, you'll have to find another solution."

hockeyplayers,3b5hco,modtrax,6,Fri Jun 26 03:17:38 2015 UTC,At that size I'd definitely try a 75 or 77. If you start to get comfortable with your mechanics and feel that's too soft then you should flex up.
hockeyplayers,3b5hco,rhenze,2,Fri Jun 26 04:23:19 2015 UTC,Yep
hockeyplayers,3b5hco,thetylertheking,6,Fri Jun 26 06:21:06 2015 UTC,"The problem is that, at 5'7, you'll probably have to cut your stick down which would increase the flex beyond the stated rating. Buying at intermediate stick, say in the 65-67 range (or in Warrior's case even 70), and cutting it will bring it up to the mid 70's, which will be a lot more workable for you.  It made a huge difference in my shot, 5'6 @ 140 lbs."
hockeyplayers,3b5hco,nolovedeepmeta,2,Fri Jun 26 04:30:54 2015 UTC,"Same height as OP and same weight as you, I picked up a Warrior AX4 last month, 70 flex, thinking the same but it's right at my chin on skates and I can't cut it.  It measures 57"".  If this breaks I'll look towards Bauer, they have sticks with a mid 70s flex."
hockeyplayers,3b5hco,SenorV,4,Fri Jun 26 05:29:55 2015 UTC,"Looks perfect, might pull the trigger on this one."
hockeyplayers,3b5hco,SenorV,2,Fri Jun 26 06:02:59 2015 UTC,It's a good stick but after 6 games there are a lot of chip marks on the blade and shaft. Got it on sale for a good discount but I'm fairly concerned about its durability. Just figured to mention.
hockeyplayers,3b5hco,PizzaHockeyGolf,3,Fri Jun 26 12:21:38 2015 UTC,"CCM also sells normal length sticks(60"") at 75 flex. I'm also 5'7 but 170 and don't cut my sticks."
hockeyplayers,3b5hco,DicNavis,3,Fri Jun 26 05:31:54 2015 UTC,"No harm in trying a 75 flex.  I myself just ordered an 80 which is the lightest I'll have used after mostly playing with 90's.  I'm 175 lbs and 6'2""."
hockeyplayers,3b5hco,Nicholasagn,2,Fri Jun 26 03:58:15 2015 UTC,"I was confused at first as well. Any guide that I saw said I should get a stick with a flex of at least 100 due to me being 6'1"" Before ordering a stick I asked some people I knew who have been playing their entire lives that I should start lower as I will have a hard time maximizing the flex properly. I am new so take what I say with a grain of salt but no use using a stick that's not efficient for you. The flex becomes useless if you can't use it"
hockeyplayers,3b5hco,Skyline_BNR34,1 point,Fri Jun 26 03:25:18 2015 UTC,"Everyone starting out, regardless of weight needs a lower flex stick in order to first learn how to load a stick and to shoot properly first.  As more time moves on, you can go up in flex."
hockeyplayers,3b5hco,Trepanated,2,Fri Jun 26 20:11:20 2015 UTC,"It sure won't hurt to bulk up the wrists, but I'm about 5'8 or so and when I switched to intermediate sticks a few years ago, I never looked back.  Importantly, they are the perfect length for me which means I don't have to cut them at all.  Cutting a stick will make it stiffer, so if you had to cut your senior stick down, then in practice you have a higher (stiffer) flex than the rated value.  I'd try an intermediate around 75 and hope you can use it without cutting it down.  I have no trouble getting pretty good bend on the stick that way."
hockeyplayers,3b5hco,stevegcook,1 point,Fri Jun 26 04:31:33 2015 UTC,Any particular model that you know of with those specs? I've had trouble finding an int stick higher than 65. I'd prefer not to cut it down.

hockeyplayers,3b5hco,kingofthediamond,1 point,Fri Jun 26 15:00:23 2015 UTC,"Bulking up your wrists isn't going to do much for flexing a stick, using flex is mostly about applying weight to the stick, not snapping your wrists. If your shooting mechanics are good and you still aren't getting the flex you want go for a lower flex. You might find you like a stiffer stick though, there's a lot of variation based on position and play style. I'm 6'3"" 195 and have played with anything from a 105 to a 77 over the years."
hockeyplayers,3b5hco,boingmydoing,1 point,Fri Jun 26 13:25:30 2015 UTC,"Dont trust anything pure hockey has to say. They cant know what flex you like just by looking at you. And FYI no one makes an 88 flex.   Anyway, I would start with a 75 flex cut down and go from there. If you want it with a lighter flex go with an intermediate. The reason I say to try the 75 first is that you most likely wont cut the intermediate  stick so you will get all of that 65 flex. Unless you are very week I think the 65 is too whippy for you.   also check out my article on [flex](www.thestickguru.com/flex)"

hockeyplayers,3b5hco,Bacon_Cheeseburger,1 point,Fri Jun 26 13:55:42 2015 UTC,I'm the same height and weight as you and I use a 75 flex.  I used an 85 flex before and I had a hard time flexing it.  The 75 should be perfect for you.
hockeyplayers,3b5hco,thirdmanin,1 point,Fri Jun 26 16:02:24 2015 UTC,"I'm actually pretty much exactly your size, 5'7"" 165. I used to use 85 and 88 flexes and always wondered why I couldn't get good pop on my shots. Finally went down to 75/77 and it got a bit better but I would have to cut sticks down so much that they became too stiff. I finally found that Warrior 70 flex intermediates work perfect for me. I cut a few inches off there still and I'm at about 75 flex. It's made a huge difference in my game.  I also happen to love Warrior sticks so this has worked out very well for me."

hockeyplayers,3b5hco,tfwnowaffles,1 point,Fri Jun 26 20:24:12 2015 UTC,"Eh, I think it depends on you. I've actually had the QR4, the thing snapped on me due to a pretty nasty slash. Loved it while I had it though. Did the warranty and Warrior overnighted me a QR3 70 flex W3 curve which is my current stick. I also have a QR3 75 flex W28 that I ordered just to try it.   I would go with the low kick if you like taking quicker shots and go with the mid if you take one timers or some heavier shots. I love the low kick but sometimes I feel like I may be losing velocity on my one-timers.   For almost half the price I would go with the AX4 personally. I don't think the 25 gram or so weight reduction from the QR4 would be worth it for the extra money."
hockeyplayers,3b4zhk,Bloodgiver,2,Fri Jun 26 00:40:27 2015 UTC,"Do you pull on the tendon guards when taking off your skates?  That's generally the cause of this, and will happen on pretty much any skate."
hockeyplayers,3b4zhk,stevegcook,2,Fri Jun 26 00:45:07 2015 UTC,"No actually, and I don't tie my laces around the back either. Someone thought it could be from another skate but I would've noticed a skate slicing my tendon guard (it surely would've cut me, right?)."
hockeyplayers,3b4zhk,ludo_kressh,2,Fri Jun 26 02:58:06 2015 UTC,"Can you call them?  If you can get a hold of a rep, try and get in touch with a supervisor.  Talk to them and let them know that you've sunk money into return shipping costs and CCM has not held up their end of the bargain.  They shipped you the wrong product essentially twice and the second skate they sent is defective (in addition to the 16k's you originally purchased).  I would insist they pay for return shipping and expedited shipping on a new pair of skates if they are interested in retaining you as a customer.  E-mails are easy to dismiss, a phone call puts them on the spot.  It's the least they can do and if they don't want to play ball then take your money elsewhere.    Not sure if this is an option but can your LHS reinforce/repair the tendon guard (make alterations as a last ditch effort since this would likely void a warranty claim)?    You could also look into Craig's list/eBay to see if you could find your original 16ks for cheap.    If you become entirely fed up with CCM, Bauer does accommodate wider feet.  The Nexus line in particular is for wide feet (wider than the Reebok line)."

hockeyplayers,3b4t4h,philthethrill9,3,Thu Jun 25 23:44:42 2015 UTC,"I had this exact same problem with my Vapors. I eventually realized it was because my feet were fairly flat and the arch on the Vapors is a bit pronounced. Just try to not tie your laces too tight at the middle of your foot and then tie them nice and tight around your ankles. I found I just needed to give my arch some room. Another thing to try is just removing the sole or replacing it. I eventually replaced the sole in my skate, again to give my feet some more room. Also, consider the possibility that you might just need a bigger skate.  You might want to look into some other skate brands. I recently tried on the Bauer Supremes and the fit feels magical. I'm very very close to pulling the trigger on a new pair."
hockeyplayers,3b4t4h,delarhi,1 point,Thu Jun 25 23:51:46 2015 UTC,This. Try loosening the laces along the top of your foot. Tight laces cause your foot to be forced down against the arch support in your skate and can lead to the kind of pain you're experiencing. I get the same thing if I go around 2 weeks without skating.
hockeyplayers,3b4t4h,glochnar,3,Fri Jun 26 15:59:57 2015 UTC,"If it's not the arch causing  you problems, it could be the skate wrapped too tightly around the sides of your foot. Try lacing more loosely.. take the slack out of the laces and not much more. Once you get to the last few eyelets where the skate curves up your ankle then you can pull as tight as you want.  If that helps, you can experiment with how much tension to put in the laces and find a spot that works for you.  My guess is the reason you feel better after 20-30 minutes is because the laces tend to stretch out a bit as you skate and this could be taking enough pressure off your feet that the pain stops.  Skating more frequently can help too, your foot gets acclimated to being constricted and it won't hurt as much."
hockeyplayers,3b4t4h,xzzy,1 point,Fri Jun 26 00:30:55 2015 UTC,"I had this same problem, pain in the middle of my foot, for almost a year. I was in the habit of tightening my boot as much as I could. I loosened my lower laces a lot and I haven't had pain since then. It was 100% my problem. I only tighten the last 3-4 laces now. All of the others are left fairly loose. Definitely try this OP, it worked for me!"
hockeyplayers,3b4t4h,Erasmus354,3,Fri Jun 26 13:02:58 2015 UTC,"I'll echo what a few others have mentioned. I think you're probably tying your skates too tight in the middle. Next skate try tightening the bottom 2-3 eyelets, just pull the next 4-5 eyelets so they are not loose, and then tighten up the last 3. That is how I tighten mine as I used to have the same problem, and this cured it."
hockeyplayers,3b4t4h,Zinc68,2,Fri Jun 26 22:37:46 2015 UTC,"For everyone who mentioned tying the lower eyelets looser, that did it! Went for a skate this morning and left everything except the last 3 considerably looser and it solved the issue almost completely. I'll keep playing around with the tightness, but it seemed to do the trick."
hockeyplayers,3b4t4h,freq019,1 point,Sat Jun 27 18:41:36 2015 UTC,I was going to say insoles but you tried that my next recommendation I'd to try and relax your feet.  I remember when I started skating I had a similar pain and I realized I was clenching my feet when I skated.  Once I learned to relax my feet the pain went away.  If that doesn't work I'd try some new skates if you can.
hockeyplayers,3b4t4h,Lndbrghwrstlr,1 point,Fri Jun 26 00:31:01 2015 UTC,How do you get a push off of your toes if you relax your feet though?
hockeyplayers,3b4t4h,freq019,1 point,Fri Jun 26 03:40:07 2015 UTC,Try to relax past totally crunching up your feet.  My issue was I'd almost ball my toes up new I'm able to keep them flatter.

hockeyplayers,3b4t4h,ludo_kressh,1 point,Fri Jun 26 18:49:40 2015 UTC,Your skates are likely not wide enough... I had to deal with this for like 2 years.  You should be able to tie your skates tightly (not too tight) from the bottom up (getting tighter as you go up the last 3-4 eyelets for that heel/ankle lock) so that it feels snug and your foot isn't moving around in the boot.  Experiment with levels of tightness... If you have to go too loose to get it not to hurt the skates aren't wide enough.    The skates feel better later in the game because the laces loosen over time and give you more room in the boot (at the expense of stability).    What skate are you wearing now?
hockeyplayers,3b4t4h,_mph11,1 point,Fri Jun 26 14:47:55 2015 UTC,Yellow Superfeet. I have the Bauer Supreme's and a combination of these Yellow Superfeet and getting my skates punched out made my flatish feet problems go away.

hockeyplayers,3b4qzl,mikepat92,3,Fri Jun 26 01:04:13 2015 UTC,"I started recently too, and around your age  I don't know how much experience you have skating but for a first timer this is what I recommend.  Don't be afraid to fall, if it's your first time skating it will probably happen a lot, it's part of the process of learning how to skate. Just laugh it off and keep skating. Standing on ice with two small blades will feel very strange at first, but you WILL get used to it. It took me about 5 skating sessions before I could get a decent stride down. As you progress, I would get more equipment and try learning more advanced stuff like hockey stopping and crossovers.   Don't get discouraged, up until I started playing hockey I hadn't played a sport for YEARS, so the idea of learning a new sport was pretty foreign to me, it sounds like you won't have that problem. Remember that a ton of people start learning how to play this sport when they're older and you're not alone.  Keep your head up, even if there are only a few people there you don't want to crash into anybody. Also, I would try stickhandling at home while keeping your head up, it's a great way to practice for game situations.   Bend your knees. This is the biggest problem for beginners, myself included. Make sure to keep your knees bent, it helps you maintain your balance.  EDIT: I didn't really know if you meant open hockey or open skating, so I just wrote something up if it is your first time skating. I know it probably isn't, but it's just what I've learned in the past few months."

Hockey skates aren't like shoes. They're pretty unforgiving with fit. That being said, go to a hockey shop. Ask them.

There are different approaches. You could walk in and be a boss, don't take shit, act like you know everything, etc. There is also the honesty approach which I'm more prone to, don't try to be something your not, tell them where you're coming from, what you want to achieve and your philosophies."
hockeyplayers,3b2fpq,howtohockeydotcom,2,Thu Jun 25 18:38:27 2015 UTC,"The intimidation thing is pretty normal, I know a lot of coaches who stick to younger/lower levels because they're worried about being able to control players that are better than they are.  The key is to make sure you know what you want to achieve with each drill. Even if you have the greatest drills, if you're not 100% sure about the few key things that you're looking for, then they'll sniff it out pretty quick, and just start going through the motions.  I'd recommend looking at Daryl Belfry's videos: https://www.youtube.com/user/PlaymakersHockey or finding some other twitter accounts that do some quick and dirty breakdowns of video clips @StrideEnvy (https://twitter.com/strideenvy) will throw up some links on occasion, briefly looking at a 6 second NHL clip.  There are a lot of things that you can pick up from those videos, from systems, to things that they look for in specific situations.  The other thing I'd suggest is to try to find a few higher-level players, older and better than your current team, and have them come demo your drills.   Talk with them extensively before practice about the drills - even to the point of going to a stick and puck session with them, make sure they know what the drill is, what to expect, etc...  You want them to feel comfortable with you.  You're asking for their help, and they'll likely be happy to give you the help you're looking for; good players love to show off.  Plus they can give you some feedback on the drills.  Once they're up to speed, have them come out and demo your drill at a their higher-speed.  It will help your guys see what the drill should really look like.  Bonus: have the 'demo-players' run the drills a few times and beat the crap out of your players.  Experience: 15 years coaching youth and HS Varsity, played 12 years through DIII college."

hockeyplayers,3b1d41,kingofthediamond,1 point,Thu Jun 25 04:47:35 2015 UTC,My prostock sticks have lasted as long as retail versions.  All of my sticks have tended to break 1.25 years of heavy use with them.
hockeyplayers,3b1d41,throatsplooshers,1 point,Fri Jun 26 20:16:00 2015 UTC,I've had some pro stock last years and I only had one that broke after about 6 months. It's weird though how the one that broke before the others was my favorite stick ever that I've played with.
hockeyplayers,3b1d41,kingofthediamond,2,Sat Jun 27 00:50:44 2015 UTC,"If you need an extra stick, you can't go wrong with that pro stock Superfast for $100. I'd much rather get a top of line stick for $100 than a bottom line stick for $100, even if the durability on the pro stock was poor."
hockeyplayers,3b1d41,throatsplooshers,2,Thu Jun 25 06:52:08 2015 UTC,Its pretty hit or miss. Some sticks are actually built with special sports reinforced for durability. It will be labeled on the stick in code. Personally I love pro stocks because the curve I like isn't offered in retail sticks.   Have you read my article on pro stocks?
hockeyplayers,3b1d41,kingofthediamond,2,Thu Jun 25 13:23:20 2015 UTC,I just did. I'll take a look at other sticks he has to see their codes and make a decision. Thank you

hockeyplayers,3b0ssz,DicNavis,1 point,Thu Jun 25 13:24:39 2015 UTC,"Portland, Maine has a Play It Again on Marginal Way, not far from downtown.  They sell new and used equipment and just got a big addition to their new stock.  Expect to find a pretty decent spectrum of used gear.  Gloves for example will probably range from $20 lower quality/old/very worn gloves to $150 moderately used pro stock.  The staff is normally pretty good, and your accents (if you have them) will probably attract some extra attention.  Have a great trip and good luck!"

hockeyplayers,3b0ssz,somewhat_random,1 point,Thu Jun 25 22:56:53 2015 UTC,Most of those are hockey towns so they should have good shops. I live on the west coast so can't name any there but my advice is use the shop to get a good pair of properly fitted skates.   Skates are something that make a huge difference to performance and comfort and they must fit properly. People that usually fit shoes will not help yogurt the right skates.  All other gear you can tell whether it fits yourself.  Second on my list is help fitting a good helmet although with all the stuff going on with VT etc that may be difficult just now.

hockeyplayers,3azdgx,Doc_Steve_Brule,11,Wed Jun 24 18:47:51 2015 UTC,Just don't fire a puck at the net when someone is about to be skating behind it and you'll be fine.
hockeyplayers,3azdgx,BlueMoonRising89,8,Wed Jun 24 18:59:19 2015 UTC,"Also, don't skate behind the net if people are shooting. If you are anywhere near the goal line keep your head up for pucks flying off the glass/posts."

hockeyplayers,3azdgx,Psychotic_Ninja,3,Thu Jun 25 21:20:28 2015 UTC,"Depending on the rink, they may or may not provide pucks. I always bring one or two just in case. As for skating laps, everyone is a beginner at one point, I would just try to stay in an area away from the more advanced people practicing shots and doing drills. This way you stay safe and they can continue to practice. I usually stay in the middle of the rink since I am just starting as well and don't want to get in the way. Anyways, welcome to the sport and just remember to have fun! You can always ask players at the stick and pucks for advice too, most people are more than willing to help out the noobs."
hockeyplayers,3azdgx,awildnoob,3,Wed Jun 24 18:56:53 2015 UTC,"Based on personal experience I also offer the opposite advice to u/bluemoonrising89 : don't skate behind the net when people are shooting at it. Got told off for this the first time I went to stick and puck, which sort of killed my own ""just do laps with a puck"" plan. I went up and down one side of the rink instead."
hockeyplayers,3azdgx,spintheiryarns,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:32:05 2015 UTC,Up and down the side also lets you pass to yourself off the boards. There is usually someone shooting against the boards and using a mark on one of the ads as a target so be sure to go around him/her.
hockeyplayers,3azdgx,somewhat_random,2,Thu Jun 25 07:30:24 2015 UTC,"There are two rinks I've been to many times.  There may be times where you are alone or with just one or two others - In that case, you can do whatever the hell you want.  However, if there are a few people on both sides of the ice, I would avoid doing laps with the puck.  Skaters may get annoyed when they see you glide across the back or the front of the net.  If you want to practice skating with the puck, do it in the neutral zone.  Pucks are never provided in my rinks, but if you somehow forget to bring a puck, skaters are normally cool with you using one of theirs.  Also, if you are retrieving your puck from the net, look out! You don't want to get in someone's way.  And lastly, if you are retrieving your puck, it's always nice to fish out the remaining pucks inside the net.  Hope that helps!"
hockeyplayers,3azdgx,charcharcharmander,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:53:33 2015 UTC,"I'd say try not to do laps too close to the nets.   Last stick time I went to, this guy was working on his turns/stops near the net. He was only wearing visor and kept slipping out/falling which resulted in him sliding in front or near the net multiple times.  Definitely almost hit his face a couple times due to the puck hitting the post. It was a pretty dangerous situation.  Granted we were doing this in the middle section. One end was closed for lesson, and there were guys scrimmaging on the other end."
hockeyplayers,3azdgx,_mph11,1 point,Fri Jun 26 19:39:34 2015 UTC,"Unbelievable, but last week there were about 45 guys at our Stick & Puck time - normally we're happy to have 15-16, and then we'll go 4 on 4.  We usually go White - Colors, and at one point, there were 22 guys on the colors bench + 5 on the ice, until about 5-6 guys changed to white.      Part of it, is some of the other rinks have shutdown for the summer, so there were guys from as far as 100+ miles away, just to get some ice time.    I would bring my own puck - we usually have 6-9 pucks for our 16 people, but some nights, we have 2....   just remember at the end of the night to take it with you.

hockeyplayers,3ayf1v,_ThatGuyWithTheFace_,2,Wed Jun 24 20:31:14 2015 UTC,"Wow, I can't believe I've never even thought about that. I never really think about burning calories when I'm skating because I don't view it as working out. One of my friends is trying to put on weight, but I think he has the same mindset as me. He's on the ice everyday and working out every other day and he's looked the same for 3 months."
hockeyplayers,3ayf1v,SlimmerThanYourShady,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:24:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah I guarantee that's a big part of it. You want to give your muscles a rest to rebuild the muscle tissue and ultimately grow. If you're on the ice everyday, you're not resting the muscles enough. Not to mention you don't get as productive an off ice workout as you could if your expelling a lot of your energy on the ice. Overall your muscles will be too tired. Not to mention if you're looking to gain weight you need that surplus of calories and playing hockey will burn a lot. If you look at the pros, after the season ends they start their weight training. That's where the junior players/NHL rookies who are really trying to put on weight will have that opportunity to do so. The NHL players will still get on the ice here and there to practice of course but definitely not as much. During the season there's no heavy weight training, only maintenance to keep the muscle they have built in the summer. Otherwise they would be too tired on the ice."

Bauer Vapors: Your best bet is to the go with the APX2 due to the fact that they are reduce due to the 1Xs being out.  Just as a reference, Hockeymonkey has them on for 423$ which is a great price for a top end skate  Reebok Ribcore: These are Reeboks top end skate off as season or 2 ago ( I believe one year ago) which is on at monkey for 330$ CCM RBZ: A 2 year old model which is being replaced by the ""CCM Jetspeeds"" (somewhat), is being sold at monkey for 243$   Honestly, the best option is to go to your LHS and try on some older model skates and pick the best fit and go from there.

Go down to a hockey shop and try everything on though, this is just a starting point.  Or if you want to put down another $300 you can get 100% fully custom skates from VH that blow everything else out of the water."
hockeyplayers,3b08t7,stevegcook,-1,Thu Jun 25 01:54:00 2015 UTC,"Generally, Bauer skates are more known for their narrow skates. I have narrow feet and I love my bauers. I've had a pair of Reebok skates for about 7 months before I got rid of them. It's not that I didn't like them I just wanted to go back to the Bauer brand. CCM is pretty well known for being able to fit any kind of foot, particularly feet that don't fit well in other brands. I've never owned a pair a grafs but I've always been curious about them. Anyway, you should definitely go to your hockey shop and try some on before you drop $600.  Edit: whoever downvoted this clearly knows nothing about hockey skates. Ask anybody who knows anything about hockey skates and they will tell you the same thing."
hockeyplayers,3b08t7,LoonWhisperer,5,Thu Jun 25 00:11:52 2015 UTC,"Hi there, I didn't downvote you, but I do know about skates.  You're describing how the skate market used to be about 15 years ago, rather than how it is now. Bauer makes three different lines of skates now, one of which (Nexus) is one of the widest skates available on the market, while Supremes fit narrow in the heel but fairly wide in the toe.  CCM also has three lines, which don't fit ""any kind of foot,"" but rather three different kinds of foot, which any given player may or may not have."
hockeyplayers,3b08t7,stevegcook,3,Thu Jun 25 04:45:16 2015 UTC,"I understand what you're saying, I totally do. But at the beginning I said ""generally"" to try and give a better idea and avoid technicalities. But15 years ago? I would guess maybe the last 4 -maybe 5 years especially because the bauer nexus line came out within the last 2ish years give or take a year. I've only played for 21 years (I'm 25 now) It was the same ideology when I bought the Bauer x60s (2009 I believe) the year they came out, trust me I considered several options. I can understand how things may be different now but up until then they were different. When I played in college you could tell who had narrow feet purely by their Bauer preference. Same with ccm. Maybe it's brand loyalty but skates have progressed more in the last 5 years than the last 15 combined.  Edit: have an upvote for informing me on the current practices of other companies. I've been all over the place and Bauer will always be my preference for skates."
hockeyplayers,3b08t7,LoonWhisperer,2,Thu Jun 25 05:29:53 2015 UTC,"You're right, 15 years is probably a stretch.  But yeah, the market has changed pretty drastically so the old sayings about Bauer being narrow, or other things like that, aren't as accurate anymore.  And even back then there were a few exceptions to the general rules, like the first U+ skate, or the Nike Quest (which led to the Flexlite and later the Nexus), but they were just exceptions for the most part, until more recently."
hockeyplayers,3b08t7,stevegcook,-2,Thu Jun 25 06:24:34 2015 UTC,"For starters you don't need to spend $600 for skates if you're not playing in a high-tier (Junior A, D1 Club , etc.). You can get a really good pair for ~$300 that will last you 2 years depending on your weight.   As for sizing just go to your local pro shop and just try on some pairs in that $280-$340 range and find something that fits well, then hop online and you can order a pair from an online retailer for about $50 cheaper than you could've gotten them in person."

hockeyplayers,3azxhf,kingofthediamond,1 point,Thu Jun 25 03:49:34 2015 UTC,"I've always like the feel of easton sticks, especially the stealth line. Also, I've tested out the ek15 and it just felt amazing to use."

hockeyplayers,3azxhf,Zinc68,1 point,Thu Jun 25 13:17:11 2015 UTC,"I got the v9e just because it's summer right now and I'm on the ice 5 days out of 7 for 5 hours, I don't want to get a stick that's double the price and risk it breaking."
hockeyplayers,3azxhf,bspec,1 point,Thu Jun 25 21:19:41 2015 UTC,"Just curious if you've had an EK? I've never really heard of them being a stick that snaps easily, in fact, more so the opposite."
hockeyplayers,3azxhf,OzziePao13,1 point,Thu Jun 25 11:45:04 2015 UTC,I can attest to that. I've been using my EK15 for the last 6 months playing 3-4 times a week and it's held up amazingly well compared to the previous top tier sticks I've gone through. Can't recommend it enough.
hockeyplayers,3azxhf,Zinc68,1 point,Thu Jun 25 14:53:06 2015 UTC,Agree. The EK15 is an extremely durable stick. Check the reviews on modsquad and the such. Zero durability issues.
hockeyplayers,3azxhf,kingofthediamond,1 point,Thu Jun 25 16:32:25 2015 UTC,"Same. Bought mine back in December, I play 3 times a week in a pretty high level league here in MN and the EK is still in mint condition. I've NEVER had an Easton (I've used almost every single one of their top end sticks) blade last longer than 3-4 months."

hockeyplayers,3azs5m,DarkPanda329,5,Wed Jun 24 21:27:04 2015 UTC,I would absolutely chirp the shit out of you.
hockeyplayers,3azs5m,Jeembo,4,Wed Jun 24 22:22:15 2015 UTC,"Artistic merit or breaking ""the code"" aside, sharpie on plastic will look like shit.   To put down good color, sharpie ink needs to be able to soak into tiny holes. Plastic doesn't have these holes so it goes down streaky and doesn't do solid color very well. It also rubs off with relatively little effort.  So think of some other solution if you really want to do it."

hockeyplayers,3azs5m,ironman454,2,Thu Jun 25 12:14:05 2015 UTC,"First of all, I see that you're a beginner, so welcome to the game and this sub.  Second, do NOT put any designs on your helmet. Even if you showed up with a professionally painted job, you'd still get a few chirps. Showing up with a sharpie work done by a friend? That's just asking for trouble. You're certainly free to do what you want, but you'll be inviting a LOT of attention, and very little of it positive."

hockeyplayers,3axi2b,stevetehpirate,8,Wed Jun 24 08:03:54 2015 UTC,"I'm in the same boat in terms of being hot all the time. For a while, I was using the Bauer hybrid shield. I really enjoyed the extra vision coming from a full cage. The only time I had fogging issues was when I was sitting on the bench and there was no air movement. As long as I was moving, it was fine. I started using some anti fog, which helped but didn't completely alleviate it. The best way I found to fight it was to unsnap the shield while I was sitting, and use a towel to try to keep my face dry.   After a couple months, I ended up back with a full cage for other reasons- mainly I felt like I couldn't hear or talk as well with the hybrid, and it definitely felt warmer. But I kinda miss it, it was nice having both visibility and protection. And nobody chirped me for it, if you're worried about that."
hockeyplayers,3axi2b,Hambone76,1 point,Wed Jun 24 08:57:45 2015 UTC,"I use a towel whenever I hit the bench, I can only handle so much sweat in the eyes. I might stick with the cage if the bowl/combo noticeably limits sound. Definitely not worried about people chirping, I have no delusions about not being a bender and if a piece of gear helps me out I'm ditching it over a little chatter. Thanks for the breakdown!"
hockeyplayers,3axi2b,EvilGopher,4,Wed Jun 24 16:25:24 2015 UTC,One thing to do to stop any type of fogging up is to rub some dish soap onto the inner and outer surface of your visor before every ice time.
hockeyplayers,3axi2b,LoonWhisperer,3,Wed Jun 24 11:51:13 2015 UTC,Same here. Works great. I've also heard of people using shampoo although I've never tried it.
hockeyplayers,3axi2b,EvilGopher,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:55:54 2015 UTC,"Same thing really, as long as it provides a clear ""film"" on the visor/fish bowl to prevent moisture build up"
hockeyplayers,3axi2b,hello_nathan,5,Wed Jun 24 18:32:19 2015 UTC,"I have a fishbowl, and I like it well enough.  It is hotter than a cage, but I think the added vision is worth it.  I have some fogging issues- generally after the game has been going for a while and being on the bench with no air movement.  I use an anti-fog, but peldge/dish soap/shaving cream all work the same way.  I need to try the face towel technique of /u/Hambone76 and see if that helps also.  I have also noticed it is a little harder to hear/be heard in the fishbowl, but again, I feel like it's worth it for the vision"
hockeyplayers,3axi2b,Mirf9,4,Wed Jun 24 15:19:51 2015 UTC,I'm an old school cage man myself. You get used to the bars after a few times and little heat stays in the cage. I've tried both and I'm still sold on cage.
hockeyplayers,3axi2b,LoonWhisperer,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:47:44 2015 UTC,"I've been going at it for a couple months with the cage, played as a youngin with the cage, definitely giving me more problems than it should. My issues may be fixable with a proper cage. We'll see! Thanks for the tip!"
hockeyplayers,3axi2b,LoonWhisperer,2,Wed Jun 24 16:45:16 2015 UTC,"Tl;dr 1st paragraph is about cage color. 2nd is about cage style. The last paragraph is about shields and anti-fog instructions.  What kind/color of cage are you using? I've tried several cages/colors growing up. Black, white, gray, silver, Bauer, itech, Reebok, jofa etc. Hell I even had a fishbowl back in squirts but my teammates were jealous and would always touch it (a few weeks after I got it I think about half team had one lol). Anyway, as far as colors go, silver and white are the least distracting with white being the best in my opinion.  I played AAA with a silver jofa and absolutely loved it. When I played in college I switched to a white jofa (it looked better with our team colors/jerseys) and loved it even more.   As far as styles, I would go with either a ccm (because jofa no longer makes cages, also link below) or itech as these have some of the biggest spaces between the bars however, pretty much every company makes styles similar to other companies so it's just personal preference.  This is identical to jofa I used, minus the color. http://www.hockeymonkey.com/ccm-hockey-facecage-fm580.html  But, if you're set on a fishbowl that's perfectly okay too. I use an Oakley pro straight small visor now and put a single drop of dawn dish soap onto a very soft and damp dish towel. Be sure to use water that is just less than lukewarm; not hot, not cold, not in the middle. Otherwise it could ruin the anti fog clear coat layer that already comes on the shield."
hockeyplayers,3axi2b,LoonWhisperer,2,Wed Jun 24 18:45:48 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the tips! I'm using a Bauer 5100 in silver (I think, it's old and hard to tell). It has a bunch of rust spots and it doesn't really fit my CCM helmet. Both were free so not a big deal, but it's time for an upgrade and figured this was what needed it most.  Not set on the fishbowl, just wanted to see what the pros and cons were. Thanks again for the help!"
hockeyplayers,3axi2b,LoonWhisperer,2,Wed Jun 24 20:42:06 2015 UTC,"Ahh I got ya. Yeah, silver is like a chrome. No problem"
hockeyplayers,3axi2b,pizzathehuttt,2,Wed Jun 24 23:58:52 2015 UTC,Nah. I got the matte finish. Which is probably better than chrome. Still thinking I'm going white if I get a cage.
hockeyplayers,3axi2b,pizzathehuttt,2,Thu Jun 25 02:43:10 2015 UTC,"Ahh yeah I got ya. White is my personal preference. Plus cages are easy, just throw it in your bag. With shields and  visors you have to be careful. I bought a helmet bag to protect my visor plus my helmet is the last thing I put in my bag before I leave (remember, your helmet is the first thing you take off too). I'm not trying to dissuade you from anything I'm just trying to introduce you to things you may not have thought of. Either way, I'm sure you'll be glad with your decision. Best of luck to you"
hockeyplayers,3axi2b,mynameisaugustwest,2,Thu Jun 25 03:08:18 2015 UTC,"Always better to be more informed. And while I had wondered about scratching, but hadn't really thought about having to pack it last or get a bag. Honestly, I'd hate to pick up a fishbowl only to scratch it to hell in the first couple weeks."
hockeyplayers,3axi2b,OzziePao13,2,Thu Jun 25 04:41:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah exactly. I've played hockey for 20 years at every level except paid professional, apparently I'm not that good lol ( I started at age 4 and I'm 25 now.. Hockey is a lifestyle in the way North) over this time I've learned how to take care of and handle equipment mostly through trial and error haha I ruined a lot of my gear growing up. If you have any questions about anything seriously feel free to ask or pm me. If I don't know it, I know someone who does. Good luck with your hockey experience and stick with it! There is nothing that compares to the game of hockey!"
hockeyplayers,3axi2b,OzziePao13,1 point,Thu Jun 25 05:05:47 2015 UTC,"Jealous. So jealous. I've lived most my life in areas where hockey is a second hand sport. Where highschool handegg gets a front page over the Sharks making the playoffs. Ugh!   Finally making it on my own and pushed to get back into the sport. Played blacktop (inline) hockey when I was 14 and loved it. So glad to be back, so glad to be playing on the ice. Definitely had to make some cuts on the budget. Using all second-hand or shared books for my classes. But it's so worth it. Nothing compares!  So I did have a question. When I'm taking a shot while moving forward, or just taking a shot, a lot of times the puck will roll of the tip of my stick just a moment too early. I lose a lot of momentum and end up wide more often than not. I've been thinking a bit more curve would do me a world of good (gotta blame the gear when ya can).  I'm pretty limited in my practice space (small apartment, crowded parking lot), so I'm trying to figure out what I can do and if the curve will fix anything."
hockeyplayers,3axi2b,Subject2Change,3,Thu Jun 25 09:41:54 2015 UTC,"I use a Bauer Concept 3. It will fog a little bit on the bench, but as soon as I'm on the ice it clears up. Sometimes when I'm on the bench I'll flip it up because it starts to get hot. But as soon as I get on the ice it feels fine. Before every time I go out on the ice I use pledge on the inside and outside of the shield. I also sweat profusely after warmups and am probably more prone to the fog than others. My teamates with fishbowls dont have any problems. I would recommend the Concept 3."
hockeyplayers,3axi2b,Subject2Change,2,Wed Jun 24 13:34:59 2015 UTC,"I was looking at the Bauer Concepts, they seem to have the most visual area of any bubble.

hockeyplayers,3axi2b,thetylertheking,2,Wed Jun 24 16:54:52 2015 UTC,"I really like it. I was a goalie for several years, mites to bantam. I recently started skating out in a beer league and chose a full shield because I didn't like the feeling of the air hitting my eyes while skating, my contacts are already dry enough. I have heard good things about avision too. I think they have even more of that visual area you were talking about."
hockeyplayers,3axi2b,TheGhost-of-Abbazaba,1 point,Thu Jun 25 00:14:43 2015 UTC,Hopefully the LHS has a couple.
hockeyplayers,3axi2b,SlimmerThanYourShady,2,Thu Jun 25 02:43:39 2015 UTC,"I use a Bauer Concept 2 (the new concept 3 is mentioned in another comment here) and the vision is great with very little fogging. I do treat it with dish soap or johnsons baby soap about every other game as an anti-fog solution which seems to help but as others said it will get a little foggy from time to time, especially when you are on the bench.  one final note, i always bring a towel to the bench with me because if it fogs up at all or gets splattered with a little snow from the ice or some overspray from getting water on the bench you will want something to be able to wipe it down with."
hockeyplayers,3axi2b,ElUno,2,Wed Jun 24 15:44:34 2015 UTC,"I get a lot of perspiration on my head/face when I play hockey. I gave a Bauer fishbowl and hybrid each a solid month and came away realizing that they were more of a hassle than anything they did. Playing in certain rinks at certain times of the year seems like a total crap shoot with them. Everyone has differing takes I guess. Personally, I went back to a cage (after an accident with an Avision Ahead visor left me with 3 less teeth, and a huge chip in my 4th). You need to bring your lid to a shop and test out the bar design and sight lines on a bunch of different cages. All are different, and there is one out there that will work for you. I literally don't even notice I am wearing a cage just a few games into it."
hockeyplayers,3axi2b,ElUno,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:51:22 2015 UTC,"Damn, bad crash or bad mask? Both? I'll try some different bar patterns to see if that helps.  Definitely planning a trip to the LHS, part of why I posted was to get an idea of what to look for before I make the trip down. It's a solid 2 hour drive to the shop in Oakland, so I try and do some research before I go.   Thanks for the input."

Price (obviously)  wood, composite, one piece or shaft/blade  Blade shape (curve, angle..)  Flex  Kick point  Once you have figured out what you like for all of those, you may also have a preference for manufacturer but seriously, it is the last thing on the list.  Most people prefer a specific manufacturer because only one makes the combination of all the above stuff they like best."
hockeyplayers,3b0wut,kingofthediamond,1 point,Thu Jun 25 04:42:44 2015 UTC,"I feel that for beginners (assuming OP is a beginner), the price and flex are most important. When I first started, it mattered more if I could start to shoot with good form more than what types of shots I would be taking more and what kind of player I would be. So I'd say find a cheaper composite stick with a flex that fits your weight/strength and practice shooting/playing a lot more before you go into more details."

IMO its better balanced than any of the previous Stealth series sticks I've ever owned.   60-day warranty is special too, the first of its kind(?).

hockeyplayers,3atyqh,howtohockeydotcom,9,Tue Jun 23 14:16:20 2015 UTC,"Yes! This was the most valuable tip that I got from my power skating class, and it applies to both tight turns and crossovers. Keeping that inside shoulder high was like flipping a switch.  My skates stopped ""slipping out"" from underneath me. I was maintaining more speed through my turns. I felt more balanced and more in control. It was easier to stickhandle when my shoulders were level, too. And, as a benefit to my whole game, I was keeping my head and chest up so that I could see everything on the ice better.  It's something a lot of good players do unconsciously, so it isn't talked about much. If this is the first you're hearing of it, make sure to try it the next time you're out on the ice. Thanks for positing this!"
hockeyplayers,3atyqh,bravochar,5,Tue Jun 23 15:43:33 2015 UTC,"What is the weight distribution between front and back feet? I've heard 50/50, favor the back foot, favor the front foot. Which is correct? I've been working on it at public skate and am getting frustrated.   I find that my leading foot will kinda bounce off the ice unless I make an effort to over exaggerate my knee bend. When I do that, my legs seem to end up spreading apart, and dont stay in a tight line. I know I can improve the outside edge work, so I'm doing drills for that. I'm just confused if my weight should be 50/50, or ... as I get the best results putting my weight thru my trailing heel"
hockeyplayers,3atyqh,glid3r,2,Tue Jun 23 20:57:55 2015 UTC,"The answer is basically as much weight as you can get on the front foot will mean the faster you get around the turn. The front foot does the intense cutting while the trailing foot is support.  Think of it like this; which foot does the smaller distance? It's clearly the front foot that does a sharper and smaller radius turn than the outside foot, which means the more weight you have on the front foot the sharper your turn. Outside edges play a huge role and you simply cannot do tight turns without mastering your outside edges."
hockeyplayers,3atyqh,jesaku,1 point,Wed Jun 24 00:02:06 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I'm gonna have to do some un-learning as I'd suspected and keep improving on the outside edges. I'm not putting much weight at all on that leading foot, which I didn't think was correct"
hockeyplayers,3atyqh,glid3r,3,Wed Jun 24 00:18:29 2015 UTC,"Good video.  He addressed some key points.  To learn even more, watch this video.  It goes into a little bit more detail.  Both of these videos will significantly help anyone trying to improve their skating.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxqZm5Ah6sw"
hockeyplayers,3avk4l,DizneyDux,5,Tue Jun 23 21:10:54 2015 UTC,"I have traveled a lot with hockey gear and with speed skates. You do not have to check skates - they are allowed through security (in the US).  Also, most airlines count hockey gear as ""special equipment"" which means you pay a luggage fee for the bag, but the sticks fly free.  Not all ticket agents know this, so do your research ahead of time and don't let them charge you unfairly."
hockeyplayers,3avk4l,Leenewyork,3,Wed Jun 24 03:38:23 2015 UTC,"Sticks can be bundled in cellophane together then wrapped a few times with shipping tape.  As for your hockey bag, you will have to check your skates in. Your gear bag can be treated just like any other luggage. You check it in, and they will stow it for you. I would suggest purchasing a small lock for your stuff just to be safe. Have fun and safe travels."
hockeyplayers,3avk4l,OzziePao13,2,Tue Jun 23 22:22:41 2015 UTC,"Just FYI, luggage locks are pretty useless unless you're standing right next to it.  Certainly won't keep shady TSA or baggage handler employees out.  https://youtu.be/qDgr9zD4ZU0"
hockeyplayers,3avk4l,funkyb,3,Wed Jun 24 00:47:53 2015 UTC,"I agree. However, they keep the zippers tighter together so if the bag gets caught on something and/or is opened your stuff is less prone to spilling out. Nothing like showing up to a tourney with one glove.  It also does somewhat deter someone from just blatantly opening it and possibly swiping something. Small investment that actually does a lot of good."
hockeyplayers,3avk4l,OzziePao13,2,Wed Jun 24 01:04:02 2015 UTC,"I've went on several trips and just taped the sticks together securely then checked them and the hockey bag in. Or if you can, getting a stick bag would make it significantly easier"
hockeyplayers,3avk4l,Griffin23,2,Tue Jun 23 23:52:43 2015 UTC,"If you've got a cheap, single-compartment bag (like me!) I'd recommend making sure the blade guards on your skates are securely fastened -- either tape or tie them on or something.  Mine came off during transit and the blades picked up a couple pretty good nicks, I think from my helmet cage.  Maybe not a big deal if you have skate pockets in your bag, though!  Otherwise, flying with gear was no big deal, I just checked my gear bag with everything in it and that was that."
hockeyplayers,3avk4l,esdfowns,3,Wed Jun 24 01:10:25 2015 UTC,An easy way to prevent that is putting an older hockey sock over the blade

I've seen plenty of players go over the tongue, so I'm thinking about trying that.    Sorry I didn't really answer your question."

Like the second or third week I started playing hockey I took a wrister right into the front of my ankle and it hurt like hell.   Decided at that point I wanted shin guards that were a little longer so they could cover more of my foot and the only way to do that was to go over the tongue. Never looked back."
hockeyplayers,3aud41,Lndbrghwrstlr,7,Tue Jun 23 18:58:30 2015 UTC,"Over! You get a nice snug fit on your upper ankle, and you don't have to worry about your shinguard digging into your ankle if it slips down a bit."

hockeyplayers,3aud41,stevegcook,2,Tue Jun 23 17:17:35 2015 UTC,"Shin guards over allows you to go slightly longer and have more protection, under can sometimes give you better mobility.   All comes down to personal preference, I've done both with different sizes/brands of shins.  So with my old 16"" Vapors I put them under, but lately have switched to 17"" Tacks (which are bulkier in addition to being longer) and they're going over."
hockeyplayers,3aud41,absoludicrous,4,Tue Jun 23 19:06:43 2015 UTC,"Personal preference. I used to do under with my old Graf's with the thicker tongue. With the newer and thinner tongues, I don't like going under and prefer going over for more protection."

hockeyplayers,3aud41,snipeftw,2,Wed Jun 24 02:32:07 2015 UTC,"Under. My current shinguards slide down and towards the inside if I put them over--- and that's even with a fuckton of tape. I've tried extra tape and special gripping knee socks to help keep the shinguards in place, but really, putting them inside the tongue lets the bottom of the guard sit just a smidge higher, and it puts the cup of the shinguard properly over my kneecap, and the whole deal just shifts around less even with less tape."

I took about 5 years off, and just started again about two years ago and that was my biggest problem. If I put my shin guard under the tongue I couldn't get my skate tight enough, but it also felt weird over the tongue. But that's what I ended up settling with."

hockeyplayers,3avaoo,Nicholasagn,1 point,Thu Jun 25 02:07:28 2015 UTC,"Go find a LHS and talk to some of the workers. Have a price range in mind, but if you're not growing any more don't be afraid of putting in a few extra bucks for support. Im 6'1'' and 200 lb with flat feet so it took a few tries to find a boot i liked. Ended with Graf 5035 premiers on a test fit that ended up working great. Final price was 249, but throw in the blade guard and sharpening and it ended at 300. Love them so far, still breaking them in!"
hockeyplayers,3avaoo,maniacalwalrus,1 point,Wed Jun 24 12:35:53 2015 UTC,"I'm 6'1"" 235lbs, and I wear an 11.5 in Nike shoes. Skates typically run a size and a half smaller than street shoes. I use the Bauer X500's (they just came out a few months ago), they're pretty sturdy for my build.   They're a step up from your beginner level pair of skates, so I'd recommend looking for an equivalent pair of older models. I was looking into the Bauer X60's when I was first researching my gear.  $200 and under is a fine place to start if you're only doing skate and shoots, and not playing more than 1-2 times a week."
hockeyplayers,3av9ax,aaronwhite1786,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:54:53 2015 UTC,"I fought a pair for 5 months and finally gave in and got another pair from a different line. After baking and 5 or so hrs of break in, I can now skate for hrs without foot pain. My leg muscles will fatigue, but there is zero foot pain. It is possible to find a pair of skates which will be pain-free off the shelf. After skating 2-3x a wk for 5 months, I had different expectations of how a skate should fit when I went back to the store. I selected a pair which I wouldn't have picked when I was first starting out.  I'd just sell them if you can and get something that feels good in the store. If you keep customizing them, they'll become difficult to sell."
hockeyplayers,3av9ax,glid3r,1 point,Tue Jun 23 21:21:12 2015 UTC,"That's what I'm nervous about. The frustrating part to me about skating is how good things feel, but then how it can change on ice, after you've already committed to the skates by sharpening and baking.  I wore them around the house for 2 weeks before I could make it to St. Louis to get them baked, and I had no discomfort. I baked them and got them sharpened, and they felt great. First day out on the ice, I started to notice they hurt a bit. I loosened them up, and then they were a bit too wobbly on my feet to feel comfortable skating, but they hurt a bit less.  Now when they're tied up the way they fit right without wiggling, I can skate for about 10 minutes before it feels like my foot is in a vice.  I'm hoping if they can punch out the sides, and think it might help, that it'll be worth the small price to pay, over getting new skates while hoping these sell for even 3/4 of what I had to pay for them, since the Stealth line and Reeboks have gone on sale. Here's hoping something works."
hockeyplayers,3av9ax,buffalawl,1 point,Wed Jun 24 02:08:10 2015 UTC,"You should try to have the sides stretched. This doesn't really change the shape of the boot itself so if you end up selling it, it won't drop the price too much. Also, I feel like if the boot itself fits well but there is one spot bothering you while skating, that is when you punch the skate.   It seems like the boot may simply be too narrow for you, so you should probably head to the shop and have them stretched and try on new skates while you're there."
hockeyplayers,3av9ax,goofygrin,1 point,Thu Jun 25 12:29:12 2015 UTC,"That is what I was thinking about. I'm not sure if the pressure from the right side is just adding to the pressure on the arch, but if a bit of punching out helps, I will be thrilled.  I'm signing up for a novice league in St Louis that starts in August, so I'll want the skates to fit well, so my feet still work for the two hour drive home afterwards. Thanks!"

I've still got my old Reeboks that fit that I can wear, but with the Novice skate group coming up that i signed up for, I'm really hoping I can find a way to make these things work.

I fell down at full speed right on the goal line and in to the end boards I go legs first with no time at all to fix myself for the collision and the end result is a knee injury (torn ligament) and a broken ankle, I thank the hockey gods that both happened to my left leg.

You can also lie face-down with a lacrosse ball between your hip and the floor and shift around on that to get some work on whatever spots in there feel tightest. I recommend doing this at home, because if people at the rink/gym don't know what you're doing it's DEEPLY sketchy-looking."

Everyone is out there to have fun and try to improve their game and most people understand that first.   Assuming there are enough players for subs, you can always just go to check it out. If you feel you aren't in good enough shape, you can always let the next guy in line take your shift (they'd be happy to) to catch your breath. In the case that you are doing fine condition-wise, just take your regular shifts and have fun!"
hockeyplayers,3ao6o0,hodson19,2,Mon Jun 22 14:25:31 2015 UTC,"This was my exact experience last night at my first drop in.  Everyone was there just to have fun and get a sweat.  There were a couple really good players (well to me) that never took a shift off... and I was decidedly the worst one out there, but they still included me even if it was just for the opportunity to laugh at me when I looked like a training dummy set on the ice :D"
hockeyplayers,3ao6o0,goofygrin,1 point,Mon Jun 22 18:32:51 2015 UTC,"it's a huge peeve of mine when showboats stay on the whole time and don't rotate other players out. everyone paid the same amount to get out there and play. actually now that i think about it, it's normally the junior players doing this and im pretty sure pickup is free for them"

hockeyplayers,3ao6o0,goofygrin,1 point,Mon Jun 22 21:47:16 2015 UTC,We have an agreement at my pickup that we simply hit these guys until they go switch from exhaustion. It's actually rather effective as them hogging the puck gives us an good excuse to keep the hits going.
hockeyplayers,3ao6o0,mootland,1 point,Tue Jun 23 12:18:15 2015 UTC,"I did mean pickup! I think. (We do call non-game skill time stick and puck, though.)  This is super reassuring, anyway, thank you! I'm not super worried about my endurance, since I know I can get through a 3x12min game just fine so a rat session will be harder but probs won't kill me--more about a more physical style of play than I'm used to."
hockeyplayers,3ao6o0,xzzy,2,Tue Jun 23 15:17:39 2015 UTC,"In my experience skaters (whether man or woman) are pretty good about deferring to people with a size disadvantage. I mean there will be some contact because hockey always has contact, but no one is going to steamroll a 90lb skater just because they can.  So basically, don't worry about it. Just keep your head on a swivel because 90% of the time when there's a collision it's because people weren't watching where they're going and slam into each other."
hockeyplayers,3ao6o0,coppish,1 point,Mon Jun 22 16:58:49 2015 UTC,"90% of the time when there's a collision it's because people weren't watching where they're going   Don't worry, I learned this the hard way from my D-woman captain who's been skating about 20 years longer than me and likes to back out of the offensive zone at top speed without looking behind her. I think we've all fallen victim to her at some point."
hockeyplayers,3ao6o0,Vargatron,1 point,Tue Jun 23 15:09:46 2015 UTC,"The league I play in has 2-3 girls on every team. Hell, just a few months ago an all girl team called the Flying V's formed for tournaments. It took them 2 tournaments to win a game, but they've gotten much better since they first formed."
hockeyplayers,3ao6o0,Vargatron,1 point,Mon Jun 22 11:33:25 2015 UTC,"If you're physically smaller I'd focus on speed and agility and not worry too much about checking. I wouldn't think that a Co-ed team would allow full body checking, so you may not even have to worry about it. I'm a smaller guy (5' 8"", 145 lbs) and I focus on agility play since my size doesn't allow to much physicality.  If you're new, just get out there and play. If there's a beginner league, go ahead an jump into that to get ice time. Don't worry about people commenting on your skill level, everybody has to start out somewhere. Just make sure to keep your head up and try and avoid skating into people if you can. It sounds like you have decent skating experience and skating is really the biggest thing when playing hockey. You should be fine.  Besides, on rec leagues most people take it easy because everybody has to work in the morning. I mean you're gonna get bumped every once in a while, but that's the nature of the game. We've got several women in our rec league here in SC and the game really doesn't change when they're on the ice. They get treated like the other guys."

hockeyplayers,3ao6o0,Grumpypickles,1 point,Tue Jun 23 15:34:00 2015 UTC,"Hey, if you can stop and go forward, you can skate well enough to do pickup :)  Sucks about the train though. Have you considered getting something like a shooting pad and a net for home use? You can practice on basically all hockey skills except for skating at home. Work on stickhandling and shooting at home and then go to public skates to get your skating in order. That's what I do."

I will play more physical against the better skaters and larger guys, and I will tone it down for the less experienced and smaller players (male/female, no matter); I am not looking to hurt anyone out there and I would hope people aren't looking to hurt me.  Most leagues are NON-CHECKING, that doesn't mean Non-Contact (battling in corners, the accidental hit) but I feel many people would have a similar mindset as to mine when playing in very low level leagues."

While you are shorter, go low, your center of gravity is also lower.  It is just the way women are built.   Use this to your advantage, if you go up against a bigger guy, his center of gravity is higher, if you stay low you might be able to take him.  Especially if he is not centered, and he has to much of his weight toward the front or back of his skates, or if he is not bending in his knees.  Also I think it is pretty cool that you play B level.  I had to play up once against a combined B,C,D team.  I felt like I was standing still.  No joke a woman playing with ONE ARM stole the puck from me and went coast to coast stick handling and put it in the net like nothing.  Her shot was amazing."

hockeyplayers,3aoots,CanadianBobert,2,Mon Jun 22 06:35:16 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the review.  I'm in the market for all new protective gear (as my stuff is about 15 years old).  I just picked up a pair of CCM 6052 pants, and am on the prowl for shin guards, elbows, and shoulder pads.    How would you say this gear fits?  I mean in terms of it being bulky? Form fitting? Does it restrict movement?  Is it heavy?    I want really protective equipment, but I'm a small dude, so I try to stay away from bulky, heavy, and restrictive equipment.  Unfortunately that means spending money on top of the line equipment, but if it works, I don't mind."
hockeyplayers,3aoots,Jag94,2,Tue Jun 23 18:06:22 2015 UTC,Here is a quick break down of everything so far:  Shins: Are wide and pretty big looking shins. These are not a tapered fit at all and I play with all my shins over my tongues. I don't feel these restrict movement at all and notice them less than other pairs I have worn in the past. Protection on these is really good including the back of the calf wrap.  Elbows: Again look big but at size large (previous were medium and they were falling off all the time) these barely move at all. The padded areas are strong and I am confident in blocking shots with them on. But their 2 piece design stops you from completely straightening your arm out. When I first put them on I noticed it but never noticed it at all while playing. But these definitely aren't the most mobile elbows around.  Shoulders: These are the best fitting shoulder pads I have worn to date. I noticed when I raise both arms above my head the upper forearm protection gets stuck up on the shoulder cups but I believe this is just a fit issue and I have to adjust some straps. The shoulders and the arm protection on these is absolutely ridiculously protective. But I noticed the actual chest (not including the spine bar and the front chest bar) is thinner and softer than my previous shoulders. I have yet to block a puck with this area so I can't comment on the protection on that area yet. But based on the rest of equipment I don't doubt it will be adequate.   Every time I do an update I make a post in the thread that is linked in the description. Videos won't come every time either. But I will be consistently updating that thread with my experiences and how I like everything so far.
hockeyplayers,3aoots,moutonbleu,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:54:33 2015 UTC,I figured I'd post this here in case anyone is looking at this line. I'd recommend reading the link in the video description as well as words can be more informative.   So far I REALLY like this line and would recommend it to people who are looking for very protective equipment. I am not sure how great the shoulders are for stopping pucks yet but that test will come in the future.

Just about any tape sold for use in ice hockey games will last fine for at least one game, and once you're out playing, the brand of tape of your stick (or pads or whatever) is going to be the last thing on your mind.  Recently I got dressed for work and didn't remember I was going straight to a game after work until I saw my bag at my front door that I left the night before. I had ankle socks, a wife beater and some shitty boxers on under my work clothes and I didnt have time to change into the stuff i usually play in. I thought it was going to be terribly uncomfortable and restricting. I think it was no longer than 30 seconds into warm ups that I completely forgot about it all and went on to have a blast as usual.   Don't sweat it"

As for stick tape, I'm also pretty loyal to Howies.  I've found that it has the best adhesion properties, and the right amount of softness.  Can't stand renfrew, because it's never sticky enough, and the material just feels cheap.  If it's convenient, I'm also pretty okay with Total Hockey tape.  The adhesion isn't great, but the material always feels nice and supple.  I might even like it the best for grips.  Howies can be a bit sticky for that."

It was extremely light.  The grip finish is much grippier imo than the Warrior grip.  I had trouble with slapshots but wristers would rip off the stick with bad intentions.  The shaft broke right above the blade on a pretty hard slash.  I think the DT1 would have been fine in the same situation.

hockeyplayers,3akx8c,Tavisss,2,Mon Jun 22 04:34:16 2015 UTC,I well measure my one in the next 20 minutes when I am upstairs. Think it's around 57 inches though?  I'm 6 ft it's a perfect height for me when I'm not on skates.
hockeyplayers,3akx8c,Tavisss,1 point,Mon Jun 22 04:41:45 2015 UTC,"Thanks,  I'd really appreciate that. I like my stick is around 54"" long (up to my chin on skates) so knowing how much I'll have to cut the stick down (and the resulting loss of flex) is pretty important to me when deciding what stick to buy."
hockeyplayers,3akx8c,nolovedeepmeta,2,Mon Jun 22 04:53:18 2015 UTC,"60 inches. I think the ones listing it as less are wrong or confusing it with a junior size. It's 60 inches exactly along the shaft portion. You know cutting it increases the flex right, EG your 70 flex would be more like 80 once you cut it that much."

hockeyplayers,3akx8c,CanadianBobert,2,Mon Jun 22 05:13:23 2015 UTC,"I got a Covert DT1, for the price and the kind of shooter you are you will really like the stick. It's not light but no, it is not heavy either. Those people are being stick prima-donnas.   I wish it took better slappers but it's got a low kickpoint so that was kind of expected.  You could buy two and I don't think you'd regret it. Personally. 120 flat is a solid price."
hockeyplayers,3akx8c,NoClue22,1 point,Sun Jun 21 22:00:52 2015 UTC,"I have the DT4, 70 flex, with the Zetterberg curve and love it. But, I'm also interested in upgrading/more whip. Where did you find the 55 flex for $120?  Edit: Just saw it on HockeyMonkey."
hockeyplayers,3akx8c,kingofthediamond,1 point,Sun Jun 21 12:50:12 2015 UTC,I had a DT1 LT and I absolutely loved it. I did get the wrong curve though but the stick felt absolutely amazing. If I had the proper curve it probably would have been my #1 stick
hockeyplayers,3akx8c,kingofthediamond,1 point,Mon Jun 22 02:54:27 2015 UTC,"Hey, I did a review on this. I suggest you check it out. My LT1 has lasted but the kick isn't as crazy as it was when I first got it.

hockeyplayers,3akx8c,MalkoDrefoy,1 point,Mon Jun 22 03:58:19 2015 UTC,I got it on sale for a similar price. I snapped it within a month of light shinny time. Buddy of mine works for a sports store nand told me it has something to do with different flex between the blade and shaft or something like that.   But I loved it until it snapped. It had a great feel.
hockeyplayers,3akx8c,Tavisss,1 point,Mon Jun 22 22:46:22 2015 UTC,I absolutely love the DT1LT. It is #2 on my all time favorite sticks. The feel is phenomenal and it is a super comfortable stick. Shoots great for wrist and snap shots.   The DT1LT is like the prototype for the QR1. Not much difference.   I love this stick. AMA or pm me
hockeyplayers,3akx8c,MalkoDrefoy,1 point,Sun Jun 21 05:41:32 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your reply. How long have you had the stick for? Also, just curious, what's your #1 all time favorite stick?"
hockeyplayers,3akx8c,Tavisss,1 point,Sun Jun 21 05:52:40 2015 UTC,I've had it less than a year. I also have the DT1 and other warriors.   number 1 is the RBZ stage 2. My shots are far better with it. number 3 is the Warrior Dolomite Blue Dragon

hockeyplayers,3akzws,LordQuagga,3,Sun Jun 21 05:53:42 2015 UTC,Go to free skate first.   When I was learning to skate I spent about 3-4 months on just skating before I ever picked up a hockey stick.  Learning to skate and shoot/stickhandle at the same time can be very difficult and your attention won't be focused enough on one element.  Get your skating down to were you don't have to think about it as much before you start going to stick and pucks.  And a beginner hockey class will focus on some skating early on. The class I took I felt like it was a waste just because the first 5 weeks were mostly skating and not enough puck work to me as I could already skate fairly well at that time.
hockeyplayers,3akzws,Skyline_BNR34,4,Sun Jun 21 06:33:28 2015 UTC,"Congrats on taking the leap and skating! Like you, I absolutely love skating (maybe even more than the actual game aspect). I played roller for a few years, but recently got into ice hockey in March and went all in with the skating.  To answer your questions, free skates have been where I have done the most work. As everyone else has been saying, take advantage of the slower times. That's where you can put in most of your work.   Now, on to the fun stuff...Since your class is over, a helpful next step for you is to visit iTrain Hockey's YouTube page and watch some of his videos on edges, transitions, forward strides, etc. Also, turn up the volume and put on some good headphones so you can listen to the sweet sound of those skates ripping into the ice. This guys skating ability is incredible. You will be mesmerized.   For inspiration, check out the transitions video first.   The transitions video is for super advanced work, but the edges video is what I have been concentrating on for the past 3 months. It has become apparent to me through these videos that mastering edges is how you become a better skater. For example, I will work on some of the outside-edge c-cut drills he recommends for an entire hour at free skate. Then, after a couple of days practicing those drills, I will play in a game and I will FEEL the improvement: crossovers become a little easier, tight turns are more in control.   Hope all this helps and have a blast out there."

hockeyplayers,3akzws,maksull,2,Tue Jun 23 18:59:08 2015 UTC,"Stick and pucks not as much, but definitely look into free skates as a time to practice. Best bet is to go to some at various times and find the one that is the least crowded and use that one to practice. No use going to practice when there are 100 other people on the ice just skating in circles."
hockeyplayers,3akzws,spartanKid,2,Sun Jun 21 05:59:43 2015 UTC,"Lots of free skates. As someone else said, find slower times. I went one Saturday  night and had the rink to myself, so I just played around.   I'm in a hockey class now and after an hour I'm  soaked in sweat but I'm having a great time."

hockeyplayers,3al3zj,valentulum,2,Sun Jun 21 06:53:35 2015 UTC,"How do you feel on them?  Is there enough bite for you? Do you want more glide?  Typically someone as light as you would be using a more aggressive hollow compared to bigger players as you don't have the weight to really bite down with really shallow hollows.  If you're not getting enough bite, go with a 3/8's cut. IF you feel you want more speed, move up to a 1/2 cut and try it out for more glide, but slightly less bite. Typically, players move up to a shallower hollow as they get better with edge control as they won't need huge biting hollows anymore.  Or try out a Flat-Bottom V cut if they offer it in your LHS, it gives you great bite without sacrificing speed and you can fine tune it to your liking also."
hockeyplayers,3al3zj,Skyline_BNR34,2,Sun Jun 21 07:06:42 2015 UTC,Good chart for skate hollows: speaks to skill level & weight
hockeyplayers,3al3zj,aikidoka,1 point,Mon Jun 22 02:20:42 2015 UTC,Someone as small as you could definitely go more aggressive on hollow -- you could go 3/8 and give it a try.

hockeyplayers,3al3zj,Subject2Change,0,Mon Jun 22 19:41:18 2015 UTC,So are you gonna suggest a good hollow or keep telling me things I already know?
hockeyplayers,3al3zj,WheelchairRobert,1 point,Mon Jun 22 20:16:58 2015 UTC,"Do you have enough bite? If not move to 3/8. Too much bite? Try 1/2""."
hockeyplayers,3al3zj,HughMirinBrah,0,Mon Jun 22 21:59:54 2015 UTC,"If I was you, I would stay at 1/2''(assuming thats ""standard"") till you get your skating basics down(stopping, crossovers, tight turns with both sides). Once you get that stuff down pat, then you could experiment with the hollow and probably move to a 3/8'' since you are apparently 2D."

Eventhough hou're very light, if you skate aggressively I don't think you'll lose much bite but you'll gaine so much more in glide that you won't have to work as hard.  Might take some getting used to though but do it gradually.  Summer's a great time to experiment.  For comparison, I'm 5'6"" 165 lbs and skate on fbv's equivalent to 3/4 - 1 inch."

Honestly, the guys I skate with (albeit, we're no longer highschoolers) would be far more interested in how you look on ice than trying to sneak a peek.  But if it makes you uncomfortable: throw on your base layer someplace private (shirt shorts cup whatever) I usually arrive in mine and put on the gear with your team.

I cant imagine they would allow you to change in the same locker room. Even if youre comfortable with it, not all the guys might be, plus it opens up a whole world of sexual harrassment problems.

hockeyplayers,3aiyfp,Jag94,3,Sat Jun 20 19:44:26 2015 UTC,"Playing in adult leagues it is usually a mixture of being chill and not making a big deal out of a quick flash or changing into your ""inside"" gear in the toilet cubical or before you get to the room so you are never truly naked in the room. It depends on the comfort level of you or the rest of the team (remember some guys may not be comfortable either seeing you or you seeing them).  In high school tho, I expect some parents to be overly sensitive about it or (worse) some of other people trying to make something out of it (shaming?)  Talk to your coach.   Standard rules for minor hockey where I am from is that the girls must be given a separate room to get ready and shower and ALL players must be ready in full gear 10 minutes before going on the ice so the coach and players can talk about the game etc.   If some guy is not ready, he leaves the room when the girls come in and finishes getting dressed outside. Also there is usually a period after the game when everyone is back in the room before anyone gets undressed.  It is REALLY important that you are with the team in the dressing room before and after the game. This is what really makes you part of the team, when all the heckling, planning jokes etc happen.   Do not accept always being the other room until you are on the ice."

You're welcome in there, but it is what it is, and you will see dicks.  You can disrobe to whatever extent you're comfortable with, and everybody has the responsibility to deal with it as a mature adult who realizes that this is part of the process of people getting dressed.  On my team, if anybody did anything lewd towards our female members, they would immediately be kicked off the team.

hockeyplayers,3aiyfp,crust_and_crumb,1 point,Sun Jun 21 06:24:34 2015 UTC,"Really late to the party here, but as I was the only girl on my high school team, I wanted to take a moment to respond.  I changed in a different locker room, and while I did sit with the team for a bit before games and when they cut the ice (on those rare occasions we were somewhere where they cut the ice between periods, usually only between the second and the third), I never really felt part of the locker room environment, but that was okay with me--I've always been rather quiet in the locker room preferring to think about the upcoming game or what I wanted to work on in practice. (I often don't feel part of the environment even when I am using the same locker room--and this goes for both women's and co-ed/men's teams I've played for.)  I developed very strong friendships with the guys on the ice, on the bench, during dry-land practices, long bus rides, pick-up pond hockey, and team functions. I quickly had twenty new brothers who I knew would look out for me--and did. While most of the teams we played were fine, every now and then we would come across a team that would have a few players that would be gunning for me. I could hold my own (my defensive partners always gave my checks high scores--I once got a nine for getting a guy over the boards into his own bench; apparently a ten would have been putting him into our bench), but there were several times I was really clocked and my teammates never let anyone get away with it.  I'm going off-topic here, sorry. I think all I mean to say is that while I had issues with feeling like a part of society changing in another room (someone moving my bag, them not having an extra room and trying to get mostly changed in a bathroom stall, etc.), I never had an issue with feeling like a part of my team. (Some of the girls I played with, I also played on a girls' travel team, did have issues, but they were often much bigger and this wouldn't have resolved the issue.)  Talk with your coach, teammates, and parents; find what's comfortable and permissible for you.  (And while I am not always on here frequently, you are always welcome to PM me if there is anything I can possibly help you with.)"

After reading this, I feel a little better about the chances of friendships and such, because it's a huge aspect of being part of a team.

Stick was awesome, I tend to go with warrior because of the extra three inches they add to their stick which helps considering I am a tall guy. However the stick broke recently, which was very depressing. I am currently using a prostock brendan dillon easton v9e. Its a standard heel curve, but got a big sweet spot for clappers. Im waiting for my new Base NastyR to arrive, cant wait to try out this stick because I've wanted to try out base for awhile, and was able to get into the special ops program.

Having grown up with wood sticks for roller hockey, switching to a composite was great.  I love the curve and I take a lot of wrist shots and usually play forward so this stick is perfect for me.

hockeyplayers,3ajadk,PavelMatsyuk,1 point,Tue Jun 23 14:30:54 2015 UTC,"TotalOne, Stamkos curve, 87 flex.   After six months, I'm really starting to like it. It's very light and I haven't noticed any wear along the heel, toe, or bottom of the blade.  Some of the paint has chipped off after countless face-offs, but nothing structural  Puck handling - excellent.  The blade doesn't look as open as it does in the graphic I linked to.  Since there isn't a huge curve, the feel is pretty consistent backhand to forehand when puck handling.  Shooting - It took me awhile to get everything dialed in, but I blame that more on my form than anything.  I used to have a pro stock TotalOne I bought at a Caps equipment sale.  My slapshot was blistering and I didn't have any problem elevating.  I really had to work on my form (slowed my swing, stopped trying to muscle through it) to get my clapper back.    Compared to other sticks - I have an All Black Hockey Stick as a backup and the TotalOne is hands down a much better stick.  The TO cost $160 (on clearance) and the ABHS was $90 or so... The extra money was well worth it.  The ABHS has a lower flex rating, but doesn't make up for it with more kick.  It just doesn't have the same puck feel.  I feel like the stick is torquing around when I shoot, reducing effectiveness.  The TotalOne is rigid while puck handling, but still flexes when shooting.  The TO is just a tad lighter than the ABHS, just enough to be perceptible.  tl;dr - TotalOne is a pricier option but they are durable, quality sticks and worth the premium IMO.  Unless you run into a Game 7 beer league slasher, this stick should last a year or better."
hockeyplayers,3ajadk,Skyline_BNR34,1 point,Sun Jun 21 04:43:44 2015 UTC,Stick looks open on the graphic because of the angle of the pictures.  I had the PM9 curve and it was a neutral face. Slight open face.

hockeyplayers,3ajadk,Skyline_BNR34,1 point,Sun Jun 21 05:03:42 2015 UTC,"Current stick I'm using is an SE16 85 flex repaint from Jack Hillen. Has a fairly neutral face with a relatively flat blade. I wish the blade was lighter, but it's great, also wish it were about 5 extra flex points as I feel a 90-95 flex stick would be best for me now.  The stick I had before was a Dwight King Nexus 1000 that was 102 flex and had a pretty open mid curve that really opened up at the toe. Broke this stick unfortunately. This stick was very light, especially in the blade and was very very balanced. Really improved my shot, even though it was stiffer than I had used previously. Really learned to lean into shots to get the stick to flex.  http://i168.photobucket.com/albums/u197/SkylineBNR35/B4ED2932-CC74-48AB-9291-4EF6F3435940.jpg  There is a picture of both of them next to each other, but it's hard to see just how open the King stick was in this picture as it isn't perfectly straight down.  I had a Bauer X:60 with the PM9 curve and 87 before it broke.  And an SE16 75 flex with Sakic curve on it, was my first really good stick before it broke."

It seems to be wearing down after a season, but it hasn't broken yet which is good I guess. The curve is really flat and shoots low, which is good to generate rebounds or just generally shoot just above the goalie's pad."
hockeyplayers,3ajadk,nolovedeepmeta,1 point,Sun Jun 21 07:02:37 2015 UTC,"I keep rotating between a Bauer Nexus 2000 (PM9), Easton Stealth 65S II (E3 Hall) and Warrior DT4 (W88 Zetterberg). Flexes are 60, 65 and 70 respectively. Each time I use one, I find something I like about it more than the others.   Positives:   The Nexus takes incredible slapshots and backhands, probably due to the midkick and neutral curve.  The Stealth is really light and can really elevate the puck close to the net, cradles it well too.  DT4 has wicked shot speed, both backhand and forehand.   The negatives:   Nexus has the slowest shot and is the heaviest. I find the Stealth incredibly hard to flex, only cut a few inches. The E3 curve is a bit ridiculous for my overall game, would prefer something more like the 88. DT is also tough to flex, especially with Warrior's sticks being longer and a higher int. flex. It's also on the heavy side. I think the best of the bunch would be a DT1 in the 55 flex, light and flexible.   All this in consideration, some days I just feel like I should quit bitching and just play hockey."

Been using it now for two seasons. Really enjoy it. Wish I ended up getting a 45 flex as I'm not super strong and would prefer a really whippy stick, but I might be able to fix this issue if I correct my shooting. Easton EQ50. 60 Flex. Hall Curve (Sakic) with a Lie of 6.0 I believe. Primarily a back up, but it's light and I enjoyed my little time using it. CCM RBZ Stage 2. 65 Flex, Nugent-Hopkins Curve (Sakic) with a Lie of 6.0 I believe. Recently picked this up for like $160 new. Used in just in a shinny scenario and notice I was pushing a little more power behind the shots. So far I've liked it the best out of the 3 sticks.   Future sticks:  Hopefully another Base model. Maybe the Nasty but I'll have to see. Ideally my next stick will be a Bauer MX3 or the Bauer 1X. That 1X is so light it's crazy."

Of these 3 I liked the APX2 the most by far. Think I just prefer the higher flex despite not being hte biggest guy (5'9"" 160lbs, forward).  Broke the APX2 recently and sold the other two a couple days before (cmon seriously?!).  Luckily I was accepted into the Warrior VIP program so I got a Warrior Dynasty HD1 a week or so later. W03 Henrique curve (P92 equivalent) and 85 flex.  Only used it once but I liked it. Wristers/Snaps were a little strange as the stick felt a lot stiffer than I was used to, but slap shots were amazing with it. The hyper drive zone is extremely noticeable. Can't wait to try it out again to work on the non-slap shots.  Also just picked up a Sherwood Rekker EK15 in 85 flex with the PP26 curve. Insanely light stick."

Honestly, I'm impressed. I had a Warrior QR1 before this and the weight, feel, and performance are all very similar. I'm curious to see what the durability is like, but as far as I can tell, I just scored a top-of-the-line stick for well under a hundred bucks.

hockeyplayers,3ajwc3,SouthPawByaah,5,Sat Jun 20 22:35:57 2015 UTC,"I personally couldn't imagine wearing skates with a brace like that. I'd bet that a properly fitted and baked skate on its own would probably be the best solution, maybe with some light taping of your ankle instead of a brace.   Developing ankle strength takes some time so don't give up the first time you get the wobbles, keep at it and you'll likely see results."
hockeyplayers,3ajwc3,thomasj222444,3,Sat Jun 20 23:06:02 2015 UTC,"I wore a brace very similar and I very much regret it looking back. For me it caused a lot of blood flow issues and my foot would go numb no matter what. I decided to take it off one game and haven't looked back   One thing to remember is the major complaint about the new age of skates is they are so stiff. I feel there is plenty of support and you should be fine without the brace. Make sure you get fitted correctly as ankle bends would only hurt your situation!  One thing to add is if you have wide/flat feet like me your foot will feel very uncomfortable in a narrow skate with the brace on. My x40s(D size) downright hurt. My missions (D size), x80s(EE size) and Supreme 180s(D size) all fit fine."

It hurt a lot, but I had a pair of good Bauer Vapor skates with an extremely hard boot that gave me more than enough support to play the whole game.   Try on a few different types of skates and see what gives you the most support. As long as you tie your skates tight up at the top of your ankle you should be fine without a brace at all."

hockeyplayers,3ahire,PAJAMASAM17,1 point,Sat Jun 20 15:53:02 2015 UTC,My team was using firststar and they had a nice snug feel. They're a smaller company I believe only located in Canada. Check them out

hockeyplayers,3ahire,buddhaplayshockey,1 point,Sat Jun 20 21:59:31 2015 UTC,"Knit for me.  I don't like the look of the mesh socks and I have never felt like my legs were hot so the cooling is a non factor.  I usually let my socks just dry after a game/clinic, but after a couple of times they start to get a little loose.  One wash/dry cycle later and they are good as new.  I have been playing for five years and I'm only on my third pair of knit socks."
hockeyplayers,3ahire,Hurricane_Viking,1 point,Sun Jun 21 04:52:49 2015 UTC,I prefer the old fashioned knit socks over the nylon mesh socks. I find the nylon mesh is really slippery on the ice if I fall on my knees while the knit socks give me more control during a slip and slide.

hockeyplayers,3afoev,mrpopenfresh,2,Fri Jun 19 19:56:50 2015 UTC,More clearance on turns. Gets the boot a little higher off the ice so you don't boot out.

For the most part they stick around to shoot the shit with the goalie, or say ""nice save"" or whatever.   Every once and a while you get a ""game 7"" player that thinks it's best to crash the net hard on every stop. Those guys get shoved away from my goalie, usually with me chirping them, or telling them to move along. As a bonus, if you just push them away, they sometimes get chippy and you can draw a penalty when they crosscheck you or whatever.

hockeyplayers,3ahhj9,motorboatz,2,Mon Jun 22 16:35:34 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the reply! I think you're exactly right, I must just pull back the stick fast and not put and weight into it. That would give me a fast but not powerful shot.  I noticed that I really flex my forearms when I shoot but i dont use my weight"

hockeyplayers,3ahhj9,the5thLight,2,Sat Jun 20 23:24:27 2015 UTC,"get your hands away from your body and have a push pull motion almost. I would also look into your flex and make sure your actually using it, should hear the stick flexing and snapping into the puck when you shoot. also try gripping the stick a little harder or moving your botom-hand up or down a little bit.   For me it was a lot of shooting and changing little things to see what i thought worked better"

I broke it Feb. 27th and I hit the ice full contact the 13th. And I was skating (roller blading) June 1st to ease back into things.  I went to a public skate the day before I played drop in hockey, and I was really cautious at first, and skated poorly for a good half hour. After that, it slowly all came back, and the fear evaporated.  It sucks to hear you go through worse than me. Sorry that happened. But you'll most likely be back in time for winter season. My orthopedic surgeon (he worked for the Blues until this year) said bones take about 10 weeks to heal up. So take it easy, and don't do anything too soon. Also, with my injury, I could skate no problem way before walking was normal again. But that's just me.  Good luck! :)"

I don't wear anything extra in terms of protection but I also had a wicked good physical therapist who helped me out, and it doesn't hurt that my dad is an ankle surgeon, so I had a lot of help along the way.

I'd shy away from actually putting a ankle brace in a hockey boot, because if it fits correctly a hockey boot should be more supportive on its own, and a brace inside may actually result in less support."

There are a lot of bad things that can happen if you rush back (trust me). Not only will your ankle be weak, but that whole leg will be. You'll need time to get that strength back. Go to the PT early and often, as much as you (or your insurance) can afford to. It's just not worth it to chance injuring yourself again soon after coming back."

(Long story) But, I  started playing ice a couple months ago, once a week in a women's league. I was immediately thrown into a game that first night, with a bunch of women I didn't know and really not having a clue. I have only ever been on ice skates once in my life, but surprisingly I stayed on my feet the whole time and wasn't horrible. I fell in love.   The days that were the worst for me, where I felt like I probably shouldn't show up and just quit or would be useless to my team, were the two days that I scored my goals. The first one on my 4th game and then this past Monday night, my 7th time on the ice. I show up, get dressed, still feeling like shit, but the moment I step onto the ice it all ""melts"" away (sorry about that one, I had to). I can almost see it now. The first step onto the ice, almost in slow motion, and once that happens everything else is left behind, at least for the game time. I usually get a high right after the game and then the ride home things come back down, it sucks. But I am grateful for that time. I am in between seasons now and struggling pretty bad. Luckily it starts up again July 2nd and that is not so far away."
hockeyplayers,3adxve,LivingInFearPTSDgirl,3,Fri Jun 19 14:04:59 2015 UTC,The only thing that can take that feeling away of bliss when you first step onto the ice is still having your skate guards on and busting your ass. At least that's what I've heard..

It's been rare that I have regretted playing hockey and it's only ever been for physical reasons (fatigue from too many sessions, back sore from lifting...)  Exercise in general is great for your mood, but there is something that is very cathartic about shooting the puck.  Feeling the release, watching it fly, hearing it hit the post/boards.  Great job on the first point!  Keep on working on your game, there is always something to learn or improve on."

hockeyplayers,3adhrb,lernington,5,Fri Jun 19 22:42:33 2015 UTC,"I feel ya. Though I'm a tall but smaller guy overall; I'm still able to play a physical game because of positioning. Think this way, ""I have/need the puck and I do not want the other team to get/have it"". If the puck is on your stick, the only way for them to get it should be going through you, and you won't make that easy for them. If they have the puck, your goal is to move into such a position that it breaks their contact with the puck. It's important to remember that you aren't playing in the NHL, outright body checking will probably end in penalties in most rec leagues. But just using your body to position yourself better on the puck and moving others out of the way in the process is perfectly fine."
hockeyplayers,3adhrb,HaNiceOne,2,Fri Jun 19 14:38:18 2015 UTC,"These are good thoughts here. If you are in possession in tight, it's wise to keep your body between the puck and the defender. If you are defending, it's your job to keep the other guy from doing that -- get in there!  When you are talking about covering a man in front of your own net, I always think about getting my goaltender a clear read on any play. You don't have to smash him from behind Chris Progner style. Just lean in and try to clear him out of the way."

hockeyplayers,3adhrb,HaNiceOne,5,Fri Jun 19 19:26:54 2015 UTC,"I would suggest playing like someone you would HATE playing against. Not necessarily dirty, but be a pest.

Also, winning the battles on 50/50 pucks can go a long way, I feel like that separates good players and great players."
hockeyplayers,3adhrb,Ben_Shanklin,2,Fri Jun 19 09:35:24 2015 UTC,"This is the ultimate answer here. What kind of players are the worst to play against?

hockeyplayers,3adhrb,throatsplooshers,3,Fri Jun 19 20:23:09 2015 UTC,"As a 5'5"" small-build female center/defenseman, I had to learn to become more physical. I played Rugby in the past, so it helped quite a bit, but here are some tips that helped me:  Make sure you keep yourself low and balanced at all times. When you are chasing that puck and expect to be challenged, get balanced. When you are trying to block someone from being an open pass, get balanced. When you are making contact with someone to attempt to get them off balance, get balanced. Master control of your weight shifting. It doesn't help you much to become aggressive or physical if you fall over too.   Make yourself big. Even if you're as small as I am, broaden your shoulders, extend your arms and stick when blocking/chasing, make your presence more impactful, even if you don't actually touch anyone.   Learn your positioning. Don't necessarily play where the puck is, but where it will be. Challenge people. Skate toward whoever you're covering. Make them nervous. Force them to make mistakes. This is mostly confidence - if you look like you're about to release the Kracken, people will think you will."
hockeyplayers,3adhrb,NuclearSky,2,Fri Jun 19 23:03:07 2015 UTC,"I feel as though a lot of people are advising on how to be physical, but that your question is more how to get into the correct mindset to be physical.  Watch the play from the bench, where opposing players are on the ice and think about what you would need to do to remove them from the play.  Then tell yourself before the game, 'I am going to (action) X# of times this game'   After a while shorten the timeframe to period, then shift."
hockeyplayers,3adhrb,tehReno,1 point,Sat Jun 20 18:18:30 2015 UTC,"Having started later in life, I had the same issue as you with that mental barrier of not playing too physical.  I would say get into a couple physical battles and it will start to feel natural.  Don't drop the gloves or start open ice hitting guys, but go hard for the puck into the boards with someone on your shoulder, keep lifting a guys stick in the crease, lightly push someone out of the way when they get too close to your goalie.  It will start to feel natural.    The other thing to remember is that you don't have to be some big goon to be an effective defenseman.  Stick checks and poke checks are the most irritating thing in the world to me.  If you can get in there and lift a guys stick right as he's about to shoot, you're likely to strip the puck from him.  Watch some Pavel Datsyuk hilights and see how he stick lifts.  It's awesome."
hockeyplayers,3adhrb,Marquette429,1 point,Fri Jun 19 13:24:17 2015 UTC,"Go HARD in the corners, that doesn’t mean you have to board the guy but put your shoulder into the guy when battling for the puck.  Another trick I use is I will put my leg between theirs when we’re battling for the puck on the boards, that pretty much locks them where they're at.  If you are playing defense and you got a guy coming at you, watch his waist not his shoulders and play the body.  Like someone else commented don’t open ice hit the guy but if you keep your hands down you can play pretty physical without taking a penalty.  Ive reffed for four years and I can tell you hands are a big thing they teach you about, hands up likely gonna get a penalty, hands down its typically clean.  As a guy who is the cliché big d man I can tell you I love physical hockey, it’s just always how I’ve played.  Go in with the mindset of no one is gonna mess with you, don’t be a goon but stand your ground too, protect your goalie from the extra hack guys.  When someone whacks at my goalie I typically look them dead in the eyes and say “ok that’s your one” they typically don’t fuck with my goalie after that."

hockeyplayers,3adhrb,7sage7,1 point,Fri Jun 19 19:38:13 2015 UTC,"There's a difference between being aggressive and being dirty, and it's a thin line. In order to be more aggressive responsibly, in my experience you need to internalize your frustration and competitiveness. Challenge yourself to get to the bench after a shift and know that you couldn't have skated any harder. If someone beat you to the puck it's because they were faster or had a better position, but they sure as hell didn't skate harder than you. If you start challenging aggressive players on the other team, you turn into one of ""those"" guys... and quickly. Be careful, don't turn into one of ""those"" guys.  Last week I was playing a 11:00pm game and the refs wanted to go home BADLY! They didn't call a single icing and the borderline guys on each team realized that the refs weren't calling anything and had at it. The game got way out of hand at the end. I got checked into the boards hard without a call and, in retaliation, I grabbed the guy's stick and held on for a solid 10 seconds. He responded by cross checking me and so on and so forth. I got caught in a very poor exercise in aggression and my game suffered because of it. Games stop being fun at that point. Don't be one of those people that ruins the game for everyone else."
hockeyplayers,3adhrb,lernington,1 point,Fri Jun 19 18:49:43 2015 UTC,"You'll find yourself in situations on the ice where you have the option to either engage, or back off and get into a safer position.  My guess is that you instinctively go the safe route in these spots.  When you find yourself in those judgement call situations, try to tell yourself 'no,' and just skate straight into the play, with the objective of taking the puck and making a play.  You may make some mistakes at first, but it will help you get over that mental block."

It is not about the skill but the understanding of the person asking the question.  Of course some beer leaguers or coaches are the last person to take advice from too.

hockeyplayers,3aaoab,YoMikeyiPhone,2,Fri Jun 19 22:54:17 2015 UTC,Was thinking of picking these up before summer was over. I've had my pants for about 8 years now and they are super bulky and annoying. Seeing as I don't wear bulky stuff don't even wear shoulder pads. I got these pants when I played contact hockey. So I guess my question are these pants really bulky.
hockeyplayers,3aaoab,FreakAss,1 point,Thu Jun 18 20:44:12 2015 UTC,"Compared to my minimalist Easton S3 pants, yes, these pants are kind of bulky.  Might not be too annoying with the right size, but if you're not wearing shoulder pads then you may want a set with less pads.  I noticed the biggest difference in the butt and hip area.  My last set of pants had very thin layers of foam through out the hips and back, with nothing on the butt/tailbone.  The Nexus 800s have rigid foam throughout those areas.  I still haven't skated with them, so it's hard to tell."

hockeyplayers,3aarnc,NoClue22,2,Mon Jun 22 23:04:41 2015 UTC,A bunch of people take slappers during scrimmage. The goalies are usually awesome and always glove or stick them away. The only weakness I've noticed on goalies is five hole or above shoulders.
hockeyplayers,3aarnc,Knobdy1,9,Thu Jun 18 18:45:46 2015 UTC,"You're there to play hockey so play hockey in my opinion.  That being said there are some caveats:   It's just stick and puck time so don't go laying out and getting yourself killed. Ask the goalie to confirm but most goalies I've played with prefer to have the D move out of the way so that they can see the shot.  Sucks having it deflect and go in or deflect and hit them in the neck/nuts.  Before we start playing I usually ask the goalie what they want me to do.  Move out of the way on shots, try to block them, take the pass on breakaways... that kind of stuff"
hockeyplayers,3aarnc,PavelMatsyuk,3,Thu Jun 18 16:19:49 2015 UTC,"Really depends on where the potential shotblocker is in relation to the shooter. If the shooter is at the blue line and the shot blocker is above the circle, the shot blocker has a better angle on the puck. If the shotblocker is down low, like between the crease and the hash marks, then I say GTFO of the way and try and give the goalie a clear line of sight.   As a bonus, blocking shots on the blue line can lead to great breakaways. Usually the shooter is the only person between you and the opposing goalie."

Good tip though, I'll make sure to be closer when someone's taking a shot from the blue line. It was the first time I was asked to play scrimmage so I'm learning as I go."
hockeyplayers,3aarnc,PavelMatsyuk,2,Thu Jun 18 18:48:58 2015 UTC,"Most goalies I know would rather see the shot and not have to deal with you deflecting it. But if you can get it above the tops of the circles, then block away."
hockeyplayers,3aarnc,dasherboard,1 point,Fri Jun 19 00:12:04 2015 UTC,Good tip. I'll definitely ask the goalie next time.
hockeyplayers,3aarnc,biffenbob,6,Thu Jun 18 18:46:16 2015 UTC,"If it was a scrimmage, then you're good to go. Shot blocking is part of the game.   Guy seems like a douche for launching a slapper the with someone in the shooting lane at a pickup game, bonus points for doing it with the zam doors open."
hockeyplayers,3aarnc,biffenbob,1 point,Thu Jun 18 18:02:05 2015 UTC,The thing is I feel like a douche for blocking since the goalie probably could have sticked it away. Thinking about it again I realize he's the only guy who didn't say good game to me.
hockeyplayers,3aarnc,stevetehpirate,3,Thu Jun 18 18:40:40 2015 UTC,"Did he shoot in the direction of the open Zamboni doors? If he did, thank you for blocking it on behalf of Zamboni drivers everywhere."

hockeyplayers,3aarnc,barbiejet,2,Thu Jun 18 18:38:39 2015 UTC,"I feel like you are over thinking it, the simplest way to boil it down.  Are you comfortable blocking the shot?  Some of the people I play with I am fine with stepping in front of them, others I will dive out of the way if I see them winding up.    As for stopping it with my stick I will always take a swipe at it, tipping it in be damned.  It is pickup and that is the best place to practice hand eye coordination even when you do screw up."
hockeyplayers,3aarnc,bthompson04,1 point,Thu Jun 18 17:53:59 2015 UTC,I'm definitely comfortable blocking shots. I want to be a defenseman so shot blocking is something I'm working on. I'm not afraid of the puck and I personally feel I should do everything I can to make sure the puck doesn't go through the house especially the net.
hockeyplayers,3aarnc,woopig86,1 point,Thu Jun 18 18:43:28 2015 UTC,"Then I would not worry about it, basically as long as you are not playing in a way that is dangerous to yourself or others I'd say go for it."

hockeyplayers,3ab31o,Malarowski,1 point,Thu Jun 18 21:48:46 2015 UTC,"Yep. I am doing the offseason program right now in the middle of our season while losing weight and running at a caloric deficit.

hockeyplayers,3ab31o,chenac,1 point,Fri Jun 19 02:16:09 2015 UTC,"Any specific areas of strength you're trying to improve? For example, if you want to get better at winning board battles, you'll probably want to focus on stability and maybe some upper-body strength to hold off opponents."
hockeyplayers,3ab31o,chenac,2,Thu Jun 18 20:56:58 2015 UTC,"I want to try to be better at out-muscling people in the corner. For example, I play defense and I'm not a big guy at 5'9 150 and my coach says I need to get under the guy's stick first and then take the body. Would this be forearm strength? I already have pretty good balance and am strong on my skates. What should I do for some upper body training?"
hockeyplayers,3ab31o,chenac,2,Fri Jun 19 02:19:15 2015 UTC,"I'd probably recommend starting out with chest and triceps exercises – really focus on increasing your weight on bench press or alternatively do pushups if you don't have access to a bench. Pec flys and dumbbell flys would be good to supplement for chest. For triceps, do any two of the following: tricep extensions, tricep pulldowns, skullcrushers, and dips. If you have any specific questions regarding what one of these exercises is, just let me know!    As I mentioned, core strength is key, too. It's what allows you to absorb a hit or maintain your balance when your stick gets lifted. Start with basic crunches and planks, then graduate to harder core exercises such as leg raises.  You can always make planks harder by doing them with your arms on a BOSU ball or exercise ball.  FWIW, I'm about your height (5'10"") but 10 pounds heavier and have been weightlifting for about two years now. Even though I'm smaller than a lot of the guys in my league, I tend to win most of my puck battles because they underestimate my strength!    Also, regarding speed, you'll want to choose exercises that focus on agility, explosiveness, and quick changes of direction. Unfortunately, suicides are really one of the most effective exercises for this. They're never fun, but they sure as hell will pay off. For agility, you can run some simple speed ladder drills or do plyometrics (aka jump training) to work on your foot speed and coordination. Plyos are really easy to do as you don't need any equipment, let me know if you need specific examples."

It wasn't a protection issue, but the skates became too loose. I cut mostly from the upper part of the tongue and so my ankles would get super sore and cramp after about 40 minutes of skating, when previously I was fine to skate for a couple hours.   You'll probably be fine to remove small pieces to get a better bend though."

I love being on the ice and just started so not ready to give it up yet lol. I go back monday night for my first game back and plan on taking it easy. I'm just going to work on core exercises for now and see how it goes. I thought a back brace may help my posture as well in hockey.
hockeyplayers,3aav42,somethinggangster,1 point,Fri Jun 19 21:57:24 2015 UTC,"I herniated a disc about 2 years ago, had surgery for it, and have been playing hockey without issue for the last year.  If you can play without a brace, I'd go for it.  Skating has been great for me, because it simultaneously works your lower back muscles and encourages flexibility.  Just be mindful to maintain good posture while you're skating.  That'll go further than any back brace.  I don't know exactly how severe your current situation is, but even with the issues that you're having, I'd tend to agree with /u/londoncameraman."

As long as people are completely honest about there abilities and don't play down just for the sake of winning.    Make the teams random by having a ""draft party"" where captains draw names out of a hat or something.  We could even go as far as having the preselected captains compete for there draft order with a beer chug victory lap or something."
hockeyplayers,3a78ip,BleedBlueToDeath,8,Wed Jun 17 20:24:24 2015 UTC,Absolutely - the primary focus here would be for fun.  There will be no major prizes - perhaps a trophy/cup of our own cobbling.  There will be more focus on having fun and camaraderie.  Maybe we could even sprinkle some clinics in or something too.  I'm down for whatever.

I'm meeting next week with a guy that I hope can help me out, but I know in order to keep the costs reasonable we will probably have to take on a few sponsors.  My goal with this is not to make a dime, but just to offset any costs and keep the costs down as low as possible so that people can travel to get here.  Does 20Skaters have any mechanism for supporting tournament organization?"

hockeyplayers,3a922e,Jeffweg16,2,Thu Jun 18 04:51:08 2015 UTC,I got these at my local hockey shop for $140(orginally >$300) baked and sharpened.  Look around for clearance deals.  Seems to be a lot especially for Bauer right now.
hockeyplayers,3a922e,justalilguy86,2,Thu Jun 18 13:15:56 2015 UTC,"I started out with a pair of Bauer X60s for around $200 at the skate shop and the guys there advised me that a $200 buy is minimum because cheaper skates won't have enough ankle or foot protection to keep you from snapping an ankle from an errant slapper.  I would go in and get fitted at your local skate shop so you can at least get your foot size and a general feel for the fit of different skates. You can sometimes get better deals online, but it's ALWAYS better to try on the skates before you buy them."
hockeyplayers,3a922e,Vargatron,1 point,Thu Jun 18 14:33:00 2015 UTC,I second this. The X60s are a great beginner skate(if it fits your foot). Although I think now the X70s are about $200 since the X60s are getting older.
hockeyplayers,3a922e,Hurricane_Viking,1 point,Thu Jun 18 15:13:27 2015 UTC,You can get the vapor x60's for $100 on some sites now
hockeyplayers,3a922e,coppish,1 point,Fri Jun 19 02:49:23 2015 UTC,"Don't go cheap. skates are the single most defining piece of equipment you will have.  That and a helmet will get you started. Sub-$200 new skates can mess up your whole day.  You do have a couple of options, though, depending on where you live and what size skate/feet you got. Option 1:  last year/2 years ago clearance skates.  Option 2:  good used skates from a reputable shop.  I can steer you right if you are from the Vancouver/Victoria BC area."
hockeyplayers,3a922e,RugbySk8tr,1 point,Thu Jun 18 05:10:43 2015 UTC,Thanks for the advice!
hockeyplayers,3a922e,OzziePao13,1 point,Thu Jun 18 05:28:39 2015 UTC,"The best skates for a beginner are the ones that fit you best and are in your price range. Plain and simple.  Don't purchase blindly. Go to a reputable shop and explain your budget, what you are looking for, and have them fit you. Trust me, they want to sell you skates, and will help you find the right pair.  Do not buy used skates as they were molded to someone else's foot, and while you can eyeball the wear and tear, you never know.  There are plenty of skate models and clearance skates that should hopefully fit your needs and budget."
hockeyplayers,3a922e,RugbySk8tr,1 point,Thu Jun 18 05:23:39 2015 UTC,I'll have to go to a shop sometime soon
hockeyplayers,3a922e,OzziePao13,1 point,Thu Jun 18 05:28:59 2015 UTC,"I disagree with steering clear of used skates -- if you go to a good shop like Sports Traders or North Shore Sports Swap.  You will want to rebake them, and some good shops will throw in the baking/fitting for free.  'Course this is only good if you're into popular sizes  8 to 10, where the law of numbers works in your favour.  Pro tip, see if an experienced player will come along with you, they will have a pretty good idea of which models/which quality are on offer. Finally, everything I said above goes double when it comes to kids' skates, loads of bargains on good skates."
hockeyplayers,3a922e,hockey3187,2,Thu Jun 18 11:30:47 2015 UTC,"Re-baking a skate isn't going to unmold it from the prior persons foot profile. All its going to do is possibly create a couple more pockets for a different foot profile, and possibly provide a better wrap for the new foot. However, the previous owners foot stamp will still be entrenched in the boots properties. I highly advise staying away from used skates. To each their own though."
hockeyplayers,3a922e,MK667,1 point,Thu Jun 18 12:25:21 2015 UTC,I went to Dunhams and got 80$ Bauer Vapors. Lasted me three years and still going. I'm getting ready to upgrade now because I now know I want to keep playing. I never had any issues with them. I know you are supposed to spend a lot for good skates but when you are just starting - everything hurts the bank.
hockeyplayers,3a922e,carlsomething,1 point,Thu Jun 18 14:53:23 2015 UTC,I started out with $80 dollar Bauer Nexus 200's. I've played 2 seasons in them and they are still going strong.

hockeyplayers,3a6yz1,NitroDevo,3,Wed Jun 17 19:53:11 2015 UTC,"My high school coach wore braces, but they weren't nearly as big. Maybe there's a smaller brace? If not, I have Easton Stealths too, and they're really roomy at the knee, far looser than anything i've ever used, so you may be out of luck :/"
hockeyplayers,3a6yz1,go_sens,3,Wed Jun 17 19:57:32 2015 UTC,Have you tried bigger pads?
hockeyplayers,3a6yz1,Fragninja,3,Wed Jun 17 20:36:52 2015 UTC,"Maybe you have to change fits, i.e. I think the 75s are a taper fit, and traditional fit ones tend to be wider. Perhaps going up one inch and getting some wider fitting ones will help."
hockeyplayers,3a6yz1,spartanKid,3,Wed Jun 17 20:38:30 2015 UTC,Have the exact same brace and I wear it under my pads as well. It took some time to get used to it and for everything to loosen up. It got better though and now I'm used to it and hardly even notice it.
hockeyplayers,3a6yz1,Bmill03,2,Wed Jun 17 23:29:19 2015 UTC,"Have you tried simply going a size up? Based on measurements, I should be wearing 14"" shins, but I went up to 15"" instead to accommodate my knee braces (although they're not as big as yours).       May I ask what exactly you're wearing your brace for? Perhaps if you explained the situation to your doctor, he'd be able to recommend an alternative brace that's more suitable for hockey."
hockeyplayers,3a6yz1,chenac,2,Wed Jun 17 20:43:57 2015 UTC,"PCL is gone and scarring on the MCL. As he explained it, my options are to wear this plus strengthening exercises or surgery. Surgery on PCL tears apparently have a mere 50% success rate. I agreed with him that this is my best option before jumping to a surgery."
hockeyplayers,3a6yz1,RegisteredSock,2,Wed Jun 17 21:03:16 2015 UTC,"Jeff Carter wears a similar brace while playing. He uses jofa/rbk shin pads where the entire liner is removable, so his are just cut and hemmed to fit the brace. You could look to do something similar, shouldn't be too difficult"
hockeyplayers,3a6yz1,PB032,2,Wed Jun 17 21:00:53 2015 UTC,"I too wear knee brace.  First, take razor and remove padding from shinny to the size of brace.  Put on brace, heat knee cap of shinny w hair dryer, jam on over brace. Done.  After a bit, will feel natural."

hockeyplayers,3a6yz1,sb22284,2,Thu Jun 18 00:54:42 2015 UTC,"If there is a shop around you that sells used gear, I'd suggest buying a cheap used pair of shin pads and cutting the padding to fit the brace."
hockeyplayers,3a6yz1,crsmith,2,Wed Jun 17 22:51:39 2015 UTC,Look for a Shock Doctor 870. I have been using one for a year now under my Bauers and it fits perfectly. The only downside is they will stretch out the knee area of the pad so it won't fit right if you ever take the brace off. They also only last about one season if you are on the ice 5 times a week like me

hockeyplayers,3a8amx,FragsturBait,3,Thu Jun 18 07:00:18 2015 UTC,"Like others have said, if you plan to stick with it a good pair of skates that FIT you are essential.   Your ankles hurt because you likely kept them bent inwards.  People who are just starting to skate tend to underestimate how many muscles in your feet and ankles/lower legs you use to keep yourself balanced on your blades while you skate. It will take a little bit of time to develop good form, you just have to keep up with it. Be conscious of your form as the rest of your skating maneuvers will come easier if you establish good form from the start.  Also, get lower."
hockeyplayers,3a8amx,1966mopar,2,Thu Jun 18 14:42:03 2015 UTC,Nose knees toes is how I was taught. You should be able to draw a line between the 3 perpendicular to the ice.  Also get lower.
hockeyplayers,3a8amx,FragsturBait,1 point,Thu Jun 18 16:10:29 2015 UTC,"As far as being able to do something on one foot as opposed to the other, everyone has a dominant side. Best thing to do is work on both. If you plan on sticking with it get your own skates. I bought a used pair of missions and still have them today, i bought them from a good local hockey store so they fit good. I've been using them for about three years and were good for learning and hockey. I suggest the same.  I would also suggest skating lessons. You need someone to watch what you are doing so you can be corrected. Don't be afraid to fall,that's how you learn. just make sure you have your helmet on.  and have fun."

I think the rink I went too has a pro shop that advertised their willingness to match prices for most of the retailers, I might take advantage of that"
hockeyplayers,3a8amx,FragsturBait,1 point,Thu Jun 18 01:35:43 2015 UTC,Worth the drive for quality gear IMO
hockeyplayers,3a8amx,tehReno,1 point,Thu Jun 18 16:15:35 2015 UTC,"It all feels weird at first. You difference on each side will lessen as you get used to it. As far as skates, buy a pair ASAP. Unfortunately you really do need to go to a shop to get a pair. Your other gear you can get close to size online for cheap, but you really have to try on since every brand and model fits differently. Sounds like total hockey is a pretty far drive, but their stores are usually pretty great, would be a good place to get fitted"
hockeyplayers,3a8amx,Vargatron,1 point,Thu Jun 18 03:22:41 2015 UTC,"Also a helmet. Buy a new helmet. You never know what a used helmet has gone through, and it might not be under warranty or certification any more. Even a cheap new helmet is better than a used one."
hockeyplayers,3a8amx,Vargatron,1 point,Thu Jun 18 16:14:57 2015 UTC,"In regards to your ankles hurting - that happens with the ankles bent inward.  Stand up, essentially, use your ankles to move with, but not to support your weight.  The boot and blade will do that.  You might find that this helps with the blade bite as well...  There are 2 edges to each blade, and forward momentum will be easier to achieve and maintain when as many as possible of the four are in contact with the ice.  It takes a bit of training to get your ankles straight, and only bend them as needed for movement."
hockeyplayers,3a8amx,Aurion1,1 point,Thu Jun 18 08:16:23 2015 UTC,"For the skate push, try and center your weight distribution on your skate blade to the middle of the skate. You'll also want to angle your skate so that you are digging the inside edge into the ice. One thing to be aware of is that skate sharpness is hit and miss on rental skates. If you need to, ask for a different pair of skates and see if that helps. Your balance issue is probably caused by ankle weakness since this is the first time you are skating. Don't worry, it will go away with time. Also, everybody has a strong foot and a weak foot. You'll develop skating balance as you continue.  For ankle support, I would try to wrap the laces around the back of the boot and keep them tight. You don't want them so tight that you are losing circulation to your foot, but you want to keep the boot snug. You'll stop bending your ankles the more you develop the muscles in your lower legs.  In terms of skates, I would definitely buy your own pair if you've got the money. You'll have consistency in between skates and you'll be able to know that your skates are properly sharpened whenever your go out and skate."
hockeyplayers,3a8amx,AlexTheGreat,1 point,Thu Jun 18 14:59:29 2015 UTC,"As for the direction of the push, am I pushing perpendicular to the angle the blade is at?  I know it's not straight back, my friend told me 45 degrees, it just seemed like sometimes instead of the edges digging and allowing me to push, they would instead grab and try to slide instead. Either this is due to the sharpness of rental skates, or some other factor, I'm not sure. Hell, I could have been doing it wrong"

Just go out there, and enjoy the smell of the ice, and cool breeze on your face when you skate.    I go to stick and puck sessions with small goals.  I look up drills on youtube before I go, so that I don't just waste an hour of my time skating in circles and not accomplishing anything.  However, that is me... and I go to stick and puck sessions for the explicit reason of improving my game.  Being as this is your first time, you probably don't have the same goal in mind.  Like I said, just go out there, and try to get comfortable on your skates.    If you watch hockey, specifically NHL, AHL, OHL, etc... (elite players), ice skating/playing hockey LOOKS really easy.  But when you step out on that ice, you quickly realize how fucking hard it is to do.    Don't overwhelm yourself.  Go onto youtube and look up some beginner skating tips, and try to work on those. Good skating is the foundation of good hockey.  Try to understand the concepts, and apply them on the ice.    And again, have fun.  As far as how to carry your gear... its going to be pretty tough without a bag, but i guess if you have a big enough backpack, you can figure it out.    ETA - where are you located?"

hockeyplayers,3a3r4l,pbs094,-1,Wed Jun 17 20:20:30 2015 UTC,"Did you have them sharpened and moulded in the same day? You need to be careful with that, its a lot of heat and then for a plastic holder to withstand. My staff and I have decided to do them in seperate days, there's a chance you can warp the holder. Not the best way to break in the skate.  You should be fine, as long as you give them the 24 hour cool-off period."
hockeyplayers,3a3r4l,RegisteredSock,3,Wed Jun 17 01:02:53 2015 UTC,"Never heard of skates getting hot from sharpening...obviously the steel gets hot, but it's cool to the touch seconds after...  I agree that you shouldn't bake then sharpen tho."
hockeyplayers,3a3r4l,OzziePao13,2,Wed Jun 17 03:43:17 2015 UTC,"If the holder is going to warp, wouldn't it warp from just the heat of getting it baked?"
hockeyplayers,3a3r4l,MalkoDrefoy,3,Wed Jun 17 05:17:57 2015 UTC,"You always bake, then have them sharpened prior to leaving the store.  Nothing bad can happen. The boot, holder, and steel are all built to withstand it. The heat of either isn't actually enough to degrade any of the parts.  I would never make a customer come back again for something like that.  Obviously you wait 24 hours prior to skating on a newly baked skate, but doing the baking, then sharpening is not a problem in the least."
hockeyplayers,3a3r4l,OzziePao13,-1,Wed Jun 17 10:36:50 2015 UTC,"No, a skate oven typically heats to ~190 degres F.  Meanwhile, a cross grind on steel is estimated to be around 440 degrees, while applying pressure too."

hockeyplayers,3a7omu,Stirling1716,1 point,Wed Jun 17 23:39:24 2015 UTC,Have you noticed a feeling difference between Easton and Bauer Vapor sticks? Such as puck feel on the blade. Ive never tried Bauer sticks.
hockeyplayers,3a7omu,Stirling1716,1 point,Wed Jun 17 23:53:12 2015 UTC,"From my experience, puck feel on my Bauer's (X40, X50, X60) was crisp but not too pingey - if that makes sense.

The last Easton stick I used was a Mako II, which played fairly similar in terms of puck feel for 2 weeks then the blade fell apart. Hope that makes sense"

I think the Vapor line has the best puck feel among most brands, but I don't like the rigidity in the shaft.   I recently got some Ribcore sticks that I like because it's got a more solid feeling shaft with similar puck feel to the vapor."

hockeyplayers,3a2fya,redditjerkbestjerk,2,Thu Jun 18 00:07:14 2015 UTC,"Since you're wearing layers, the only thing you can really do is try to make each one as breathable as possible. Get an athletic moisture wicking base layer like Nike Dri-FIT/Under Armour. If you're just practicing or skating a drop-ins, get a mesh jersey.    But honestly, the best thing to do? In between shifts, take your water bottle and squirt a nice, cold stream down your back, at your neck, and on your face. You'll cool down instantly and feel re-energized, too. Hell, that's why you see NHL goalies doing this during stoppages of play."

There are about 6 within a 20-45 minute drive of Seattle though.  The main league is the Greater Seattle Hockey League http://www.gshockey.com/site/3333/page.asp?Site=9941&LeagueID=9941&page=news_league  Your post sounds like you were just picking up the sport.  The GSHL teams up with HES clinics http://heshockey.info/ and the beginner classes usually form a beginner team in the league.  There is also a bunch more info here http://www.reddit.com/r/hockeyplayers/comments/39iyog/rinks_and_leagues_in_seattle/  Welcome to the NW!  See you on the ice.
hockeyplayers,3a2mi5,cdrwork,2,Tue Jun 16 20:12:32 2015 UTC,"Hoo Boy.  There are a bunch of different leagues. I don't know what the Tacoma league is called but there is one that far south. Besides Tacoma League, there's the GSHL and the Cascade League --- GSHL is the bigger of the two, and operates out of the Kent Valley Ice Arena, occasionally the Showare (Thunderbird's home ice), Castle Ice in Renton, Kingsgate Ice, Lynnwood Ice Center, Olympicview Ice Center, and Xfinity Arena in Everett (Silvertips home ice.  The Cascade League only operates out of... Everett, Lynnwood, and Olympicview? Not sure on that.  There are also a slew of small leagues or clubs all over. BEHL used to be the Boeing league, but no longer is, still in operation though), as well as a women's league. Olympicview has it's own small club/league also. There's EAHL out of Everett, consists of 4-6 teams, and a 45+yo up league out of Highland Ice, but I have no freaking idea how you join those last 2 clubs. You have to know a guy.   If you're just starting out, I'd say look into the GSHL. They offer an adult beginner learn to play class, and that class once it's over is entered into the lowest division as a team."

hockeyplayers,3a3ows,Bluuuurr,3,Tue Jun 16 23:56:25 2015 UTC,"There are certain differences you'll be unable to fix, namely those that affect the shape of the boot.  Vapors have more forward lean as you say, and this partly comes from the heel/tendon area being angled more forward relative to the insole.  This can't be changed, but you can add shims into the heel, in the space between the outsole and holder.  Profiling can help too, but would be more permanent (changing shims is as easy as re-riveting) and would reduce your blade's life a bit.  The blade itself will not be any different otherwise, so unless you got your Vapor blades profiled or they rounded out over time, that won't help."
hockeyplayers,3a3ows,stevegcook,1 point,Wed Jun 17 00:41:04 2015 UTC,"Ummmm....heel lift is permanent, profiling the skate isn't.   Op, add 3mm heel lifts and you'll be set."
hockeyplayers,3a3ows,about22pandas,3,Wed Jun 17 01:44:38 2015 UTC,"By ""permanent"" I mean you can reverse heel-lifting if you want.  For profiling you would have to take off even more steel to re-profile."
hockeyplayers,3a3ows,stevegcook,2,Wed Jun 17 01:46:39 2015 UTC,"Not an expert at skate fit in the slightest, but I had a similar problem switching from Graf skates to Supremes. What ended up working for me was skipping the top eyelet when lacing up and just learning to deal with a different pitch, but I have friends who say getting a more aggressive profile done can also help.  Also, I have a feeling switching steel might not work considering the two models have different holders (lightspeed/ lightspeed edge)"

hockeyplayers,39zvly,Lndbrghwrstlr,2,Wed Jun 17 04:16:03 2015 UTC,"That's good, means you'll be able to get better faster. Yeah I'm sure your muscles just weren't used to it haha"
hockeyplayers,39zvly,PizzaHockeyGolf,1 point,Wed Jun 17 05:03:32 2015 UTC,So did you get up on time? Also morning skates are the best.
hockeyplayers,39zvly,jgoods77,1 point,Tue Jun 16 13:15:01 2015 UTC,I assume you've never been the first person on a fresh sheet when there is still fog in the rink and the lights are just warming up and the only sound in the rink is you. It's fucking magical.

hockeyplayers,3a05y0,CanadianBobert,3,Tue Jun 16 04:52:54 2015 UTC,Sorry it is long. But I wanted to be really detailed since people have been talking about them.  Here is a link to the images and when it is approved I will post a link to the review thread where I have done a long write up of them.  Here are some pictures: http://imgur.com/a/iE1zC  The review thread (might not be approved yet): http://modsquadhockey.com/forums/index.php/topic/68196-verbero-dextra-pro/  Also I did a ministick protection test with these gloves and others that I have. That can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDarL2DhHY4  tl;dr: Don't buy these.
hockeyplayers,3a05y0,Malarowski,3,Tue Jun 16 04:53:57 2015 UTC,The sparkles gave the tl;dr away already. ;)
hockeyplayers,3a05y0,IMCDC5,3,Tue Jun 16 16:16:08 2015 UTC,"Really thorough review! Awesome that you spent 3 months with them before the review.   I was actually going to get these as my next set - disappointing that they didn't perform better, but thanks a lot for the review (probably won't be buying these anymore).  Hopefully Verbero sees this and is able to iterate and improve on a second version in the future"
hockeyplayers,3a05y0,Kitten_Hammer,3,Tue Jun 16 09:01:54 2015 UTC,"Really unfortunate to hear about the lack in protection. I hear good things about their sticks, so I'm hoping they can make changes and up the durability on their gloves. Thanks for the incredibly thorough review."
hockeyplayers,3a05y0,maradonuts,2,Tue Jun 16 16:23:59 2015 UTC,"A stick review is coming in the future. The short, it isn't bad but the top of the line sticks I have used from other manufacturers are better... all of which I bought on clearance and paid significantly less than the Vara retail price of $180.  It is a super light stick, decent for passing and shooting. But I never got an explosive feel off of it like I did when my RS was brand new and my DT1LT was new."
hockeyplayers,3a05y0,Whatsalodi,2,Tue Jun 16 16:26:38 2015 UTC,"Love the commitment with mini-stick test. Thanks for taking the time to make a really thorough review. You should send this to Verbero, I think they'd really appreciate the feedback. If they're really trying to break into the market, this is the kind of stuff they should be looking at and improving on for the next model."

The Bauers were a bit more snug, and I found the CCM's to be a little wider, even though they were both fit D.  I went with the Bauer X500's 'cause I wanted a more stable fit and a little higher quality than entry level skates."

Exercise is a natural antihistamine.   Are you under stress? The stress release could be good for you.  I've had this same thing happen for the above reasons and no reason at all. Hockey does in fact rock! BUT if it's one of those other things, there are other things you should take care of and/or be aware of."

hockeyplayers,39xtjs,kade_m,1 point,Mon Jun 15 21:14:50 2015 UTC,I had my first year last season and went in with a team full of rookies - you'll love it. We ended up making playoff finals but lost our final game 3-2. Hoping to go one better with a year under our belt this time!
hockeyplayers,39xled,teachzim,23,Mon Jun 15 16:59:00 2015 UTC,"If your goalie is struggling, check your D.  How do you make a goalie a hero?   Get the pass.  Always. If I have to focus on the pass and the shot, then I will cheat and get caught every time.  If I trust the D to get their stick on the pass, I can focus on the shot 100% and I can stop that. Don't touch the puck on the way to our net.  If you want to practice deflections, do it in their zone.  Beer league goalies, even the exceptional ones, can't handle deflections well. Don't stand between the puck and the net.  I need to see the puck all of the time, and be realistic, you aren't going to take a slap shot in the cup to make sure the puck doesn't get through.  So when you jump out of the way at the last second I get ""Oh, here comes the puck, aaaand too late."" When you give up an odd man rush, get back in time to clear the rebound. I'll be busy rolling around on the ice using an ""oh shit save"" and it helps me a LOT if you just ice it. Don't listen to the goalie (except for when he says ""one on!"" or ""he's there!""), when he bitches about the defense. It's not about you, we play better when we are are angry and you get to be the reason.  Don't take it personal just laugh it off.  Face it goalie's are weird (all of us. every single one.)  Make it easy on your goalie and he will win games, which makes it easy on you.  It's a team sport."
hockeyplayers,39xled,rfinger1337,6,Mon Jun 15 17:10:37 2015 UTC,"We always tell new players that our goalie isn't yelling at you, he's yelling at you."

hockeyplayers,39xled,rfinger1337,4,Mon Jun 15 20:13:56 2015 UTC,"Our Goalie is a typical C league player. If that means anything- I don't expect him to stand on his head and know we need to support him better. For sure. The opposing G was just REALLY GOOD!! They had a couple rebounds and ""THAT GUY"" forward who scored 3 times who probably should be playing B... Now that you mention it I know one goal was a deflection off a skate."
hockeyplayers,39xled,rfinger1337,5,Mon Jun 15 18:18:02 2015 UTC,"Yep, those go in (Brett Hull wins Game 7 of the Stanley cup finals against Hasek, anyone?), don't worry about those.  Do everything you can to give your goalie a fighting chance and whatever happens happens.  You can't do anything about the other team having a great goalie (every team I play against has to face a great goalie ...superman pose... /s)."

I want my goalie to feel like an all-star. You're there to promote confidence and motivation in your little weirdo.   While you may be disinclined to put your body in front of a slapshot, you can sure as hell put it in front of a pass. Make that extra effort. Make your goalie's time worthwhile.  I don't know much. But what I do know is that you want your goalie to feel like giving 100%, and like showing up next time to give it 100% again."
hockeyplayers,39xled,rfinger1337,2,Tue Jun 16 09:43:44 2015 UTC,"You. I like you.  That's what I mean when I say ""Don't deflect the shot, asshole!""  :-D"

hockeyplayers,39xled,rfinger1337,14,Mon Jun 15 18:00:27 2015 UTC,"Maybe but it sure beats chasing some fool all around the rink to try to get the puck.  If I just stand here in the blue paint, they'll BRING the puck to me.  :-D"

hockeyplayers,39xled,Joe9692,2,Mon Jun 15 20:14:48 2015 UTC,"Seriously this is one of the reasons I pay goalie. I've got a medical condition and it wouldn't be safe to go out there with ankles, lower thigh, stomach, etc exposed.   We're no longer in the 80s. Padding has improved greatly, especially in top of the line gear. And buying used (shout out to GGSU!) certainly helps."
hockeyplayers,39xled,blarknob,5,Mon Jun 15 21:19:47 2015 UTC,"A bad goalie is going to stand out a lot more than a bad skater.  Every time he makes a mistake it's a goal, and everyone sees it. I think the real problem you are having is the good goalies playing down. That is like having an A league pitcher play down, he is going to make your guy look bad."
hockeyplayers,39xled,orionthefisherman,3,Mon Jun 15 17:22:11 2015 UTC,"Pretty typical. Same thing in our league. One goalie wayyyy better than the others, totally covered for how bad his team is. Every time we played them we out shot them by 20 or 30 shots and were lucky to win by one goal."

He's a newer goalie and he's done better with stronger defensive players in front of him.  Also, a lot of our regular goalies have taken the summer off, so it's kind of screwy.  There's a few B goalies slumming it in C.  Like ours.  :-D  Edit:  Welcome to the league!  It's a pretty cool little community."
hockeyplayers,39xled,ShivasIrons983E,3,Mon Jun 15 19:33:52 2015 UTC,"Yep... It's been a great experience so far, everyone has been really cool. I know I still have a lot to learn. Glad I found this league/game."
hockeyplayers,39xled,puckhead,2,Mon Jun 15 22:42:03 2015 UTC,"First of all,.... You guys gotta play better defensive hockey/smart hockey.  As well,..when you are on offence,....start taking shots instead of always going for the 4 pass play setting up a guy on the backdoor,.......quit ass raping the goalies because their teammates don't bother to play defence.  For defenders,.....eliminate backdoor plays! This is the #1 PRIORITY! Do anything else you want to,.....but eliminate that backdoor scoring chance.  2 on 1......eliminate the OPEN  skater,....let the goalie take the puck carrier.  That's all you have to do with great effectiveness,anything more is just gravy.  Learn to take shorter shifts,so you can play both ways,and give support to your goalie.  Trust me,....good goalies will be getting chased away, as it's not fun to face endless 3 on 0's and endless breakaways. You put up with it for a while,then it wears thin.  The less experienced goalies,...well...they have to go through trial by fire,.....sometimes taking undeserved heat for a loss or performance ""deemed wanting"".  Seriously,...play some smart defence to cover the two points I mentioned,.....and shooters,.....take the shot more often,....be kind to the goalies whose defenders have deserted him. At least let him die in battle with honour,......shoot!  Any of you who read this and agree,....follow through,talk to your fellow players and explain the reasoning."
hockeyplayers,39xled,ShivasIrons983E,2,Mon Jun 15 20:27:26 2015 UTC,"So true... played in a C league with a C level goalie and everyone expected him to play like an A level goalie.    Meanwhile, these C level superstars knew nothing about hockey and didn't play any defense.  Very glad to be gone from that team now."
hockeyplayers,39xled,Skyline_BNR34,2,Tue Jun 16 02:10:10 2015 UTC,"Exactly.  The A level goalies figure out that it's usually poor quality hockey and that there is more risk of injury from trying to make impossible saves. Just not worth it after a very short while. If you're lucky you might get the odd decent game,....but usually it's a cluster fuck."
hockeyplayers,39xled,greenlion22,1 point,Tue Jun 16 02:52:25 2015 UTC,"I've had issues in any leagues I play in getting goalies in their respectable division.  Sometimes an upper level goalie will play down, but very rarely."

I was watching an instructional video not long ago that advocated holding the stick with your top hand wrist slightly curled to help the curve lie flatter to the ice.  Might be as well to experiment with a shorter stick and see how you like it, and then go for a different lie if a longer stick feels better to you."

Last night, I was packing my bag to go play when my dog walked up to me and stuck his nose into the bag to see what is in there.

If you have a really old Ovechkin that is CCM then it was pretty identical as well. Coffey in Sherwood is a bit more of a curve than those two, and Statsny with Sherwood is the same as the backstrom/ovechkin in Bauer.  PM9 is like the exact opposite of all of those. If you want to try something that is in between them, go with a P88 clone. So Bauer is p88, warrior is w88, sherwood is pp88, ccm is p40 and easton is e36."

hockeyplayers,39wl6u,morla74,2,Tue Jun 16 15:40:46 2015 UTC,"The next step, in Bauer at least, would be the P88. It's a great medium between the PM9 and P92. Then you can work your way through the progressions and see which one you like. PM9>P88>P92>P28."
hockeyplayers,39wl6u,spartanKid,2,Mon Jun 15 15:08:58 2015 UTC,"You might consider trying something a bit more heel-wedge-ish, like the Bauer P91a, the Easton E6, or the Sherwood PP09. They all curve about in the same spot as the PM9, but have an open, wedge like shape after the curve. This will help lift the puck in close and sauce the puck easier."
hockeyplayers,39wl6u,Hurricane_Viking,1 point,Mon Jun 15 16:00:51 2015 UTC,I'm a big fan of the P91a curve. The little extra lift is nice to have.
hockeyplayers,39wl6u,kingofthediamond,1 point,Mon Jun 15 18:57:47 2015 UTC,Thats a huge heel wedge though
hockeyplayers,39wl6u,avanross,1 point,Mon Jun 15 21:11:11 2015 UTC,"I'd stick with the pm9. If you want to trade a bit of your passing and backhand for some more shot power, you could try the p02 in bauer, Li in Sherwood, phaneuf in reebok, galchenyuk in ccm, or e5 or 9 in easton."
hockeyplayers,39wl6u,dangerfang,1 point,Mon Jun 15 13:35:09 2015 UTC,I used to use the pm9 but now I'm on the ccm Hossa curve. It's got a little more zip and it cradles  the puck nicely

hockeyplayers,39uxw8,fastest_sloth,9,Mon Jun 15 00:26:01 2015 UTC,"Not a shootout, but something similar. About 5 years ago, my Peewee team wen to the Can/Am tournament in Lake Placid. We were playing for the Gold Medal and regulation had ended in a tie. One of the rules of the tournament is that there are no shootouts, so there are unlimited overtimes until someone scores. The first OT is 4 on 4, the next is 3 on 3, the next 2 on 2, and then the rest of the OT's are 1 on 1. I actually have a video of the game. We are the team in white and the goal happens around 7:10 in the video. We ended up going to 13 overtimes."
hockeyplayers,39uxw8,_ThatGuyWithTheFace_,4,Mon Jun 15 02:11:07 2015 UTC,Hahaha very entertaining video but that's the dumbest rule ever

hockeyplayers,39uxw8,Hurricane_Viking,1 point,Mon Jun 15 21:28:06 2015 UTC,That's a better way to handle it than shootouts I think

hockeyplayers,39uxw8,bthompson04,1 point,Mon Jun 15 15:18:38 2015 UTC,"I've played in a few tourneys that do that. When we won our district playoffs to go to nationals during one year of Midget, the OTs were 4-on-4 for ten minutes. We ended up scoring in the fourth OT.  I did feel bad for all of the little kids that were scheduled to skate after us and just had to stand around watching."
hockeyplayers,39uxw8,Fer6y,3,Wed Jun 17 15:37:31 2015 UTC,I was score keeping a game (getting paid $11 per game) so when OT and shootouts came along it was always annoying because it was unpaid. It was much worse when neither team could score on their first 23 shots. Every single player shot twice before one team finally won. Never seen anything like it.
hockeyplayers,39uxw8,boxcutter3005,2,Mon Jun 15 00:32:17 2015 UTC,"I was in such a game, beginner league, only a handful of people could even lift the puck and rules said we had to go through the entire the roster... went 15 rounds"
hockeyplayers,39uxw8,von_neumann,2,Mon Jun 15 01:14:13 2015 UTC,Sounds like the goalie was way out of his league.
hockeyplayers,39uxw8,ANGR1ST,1 point,Mon Jun 15 03:39:07 2015 UTC,Yeah I could feel the pain of the refs and I felt bad for holding up the game
hockeyplayers,39uxw8,ANGR1ST,2,Mon Jun 15 05:51:03 2015 UTC,"Something close to what you mention. Both teams almost shot twice. Shootouts in beer league are stupid. They take too long because most of us suck too hard, and it's not a good way to play a team game.  If you're trying to win you send out your 3 best skaters, and the other guys don't get to contribute. If you just do a rotation and let everybody get a chance now and then you'll lose a lot. I much prefer a quick 4 on 4 overtime, then call it a night."
hockeyplayers,39uxw8,ANGR1ST,1 point,Mon Jun 15 14:44:52 2015 UTC,Yeah it just sucked that we HAD to decide a winner
hockeyplayers,39uxw8,bthompson04,1 point,Mon Jun 15 20:32:01 2015 UTC,"Except that it's only beer league. Who really cares who ""wins"" the season?"
hockeyplayers,39uxw8,FinePieceOfAss,1 point,Mon Jun 15 20:44:49 2015 UTC,It was to decide who moved on to the next round of the playoffs one of the refs wanted to just do another ot but the other was strict about the rules
hockeyplayers,39uxw8,kr580,1 point,Mon Jun 15 20:48:46 2015 UTC,"Everyone is paying the same money, everyone should get the same number of games. This is why I don't like elimination playoffs in beer league. One of my leagues used to have consolation games for all the teams, then that was it. Now they have a best 2/3 for the ""championship"" and no other games those 3 nights. So the rest of us sit around for 2 extra weeks between seasons.  It provides an incentive to stack your team with ringers to ""win"". I don't like it."
hockeyplayers,39uxw8,buttery_shame_cave,1 point,Mon Jun 15 23:32:30 2015 UTC,I feel you. Our league tries to keep it level by bumping up the best team a division after the season. Still though there was a team that only lost once and blew out every other team and I kind of feel like they're going to be around next season too
hockeyplayers,39uxw8,flashbang217,1 point,Tue Jun 16 00:04:33 2015 UTC,"During regular season in ours, it's just a 3-round shootout and then the game ends in a tie if there's no winner determined. It's a fast and easy way of doing it. Playoffs add a 5-minute, 4-on-4 session before the shootout."
hockeyplayers,39vc21,Whatsalodi,2,Mon Jun 15 02:40:06 2015 UTC,Wear your pants a bit lower or get tighter socks
hockeyplayers,39vc21,spartanKid,1 point,Mon Jun 15 04:44:17 2015 UTC,I would put them as low as the can get and I'm leaning towards the socks. There are rreelally big on me but the pads are also old I think. They only have one strap and the newer ones I'm seeing seen to not have the same little piece of foam in the same style as mine does
hockeyplayers,39vc21,spartanKid,1 point,Mon Jun 15 04:56:25 2015 UTC,See if your pants have zippers on the insides to widen the opening a bit. That will also help
hockeyplayers,39vc21,kman418,1 point,Mon Jun 15 04:57:42 2015 UTC,They do not!
hockeyplayers,39vc21,stevegcook,1 point,Tue Jun 16 01:55:21 2015 UTC,I'm slightly confused reading this. Does the shin pad come up to high (like your knee isn't sitting in the cup) or the pants to long? Overhanging your knees?
hockeyplayers,39vc21,PizzaHockeyGolf,1 point,Mon Jun 15 03:03:29 2015 UTC,"Neither! My knee is in the cup, but the little foam thing that covers a little above it is catching my pants which sit about 3 inches above my knee cap or at my knee cap if I want it to."
hockeyplayers,39vc21,kman418,3,Mon Jun 15 03:35:07 2015 UTC,Do you have a picture?  Usually this means your pants are a bit too short.

hockeyplayers,39vc21,avanross,1 point,Mon Jun 15 04:54:50 2015 UTC,OK here's what's going on. It's a little exaggerated because there's no tape but its still happening when I tape around my ankle and my knee. And tape the little foam piece down but it just comes undone or hurts the back of my leg.  http://imgur.com/a/JTkgz
hockeyplayers,39vc21,avanross,1 point,Tue Jun 16 01:59:11 2015 UTC,I used a garter belt to hold my socks tight. I also folded the top flap down on my JOFAs because I had the same problem.
hockeyplayers,39vc21,chenac,1 point,Tue Jun 16 04:00:16 2015 UTC,"Maybe try smaller socks? I changed socks to whatever a friend gave me and only wore them for an hour, everything felt off and I couldn't get a full stride in that felt ""normal"" I would try some tape or tighter socks   But also, superstitious"
hockeyplayers,39vc21,chenac,1 point,Mon Jun 15 03:44:22 2015 UTC,I tried taping the foam part down but I think it's the socks. There huugge on me
hockeyplayers,39vc21,boingmydoing,1 point,Mon Jun 15 04:54:31 2015 UTC,Option 1: Cut that stupid foam piece off or trim it I know a lot of guys who do this or Option 2: New socks  and a garter to hold that shit tight.
hockeyplayers,39vc21,teethblock,1 point,Tue Jun 16 16:34:55 2015 UTC,"I think you may need new shin pads. I've had this issue and seen a few others have it at random times and it seems to just be a fluke having to do with how the shin pads and pants sit and line up. I think your shins and pants just aren't compatible with each other and changing either should fix the issue. I'd say to try and borrow a pair of shin pads in the same size, try them on the ice and see if that solves it."
hockeyplayers,39vc21,throatsplooshers,1 point,Mon Jun 15 05:30:06 2015 UTC,Yea that's what I was planning to hope save a little money before diving in. I'm new and I'm cutting corners wherever possible and the closest place to that's worth going to for gear is in Oakland which is about an hour drive. Is it not normal for some to bring their own pants in and where them when trying on shin pads?
hockeyplayers,39vc21,PawneeRaccoon,1 point,Mon Jun 15 05:41:15 2015 UTC,"Damn that's pretty far. And no, I wouldn't say that's normal, but I've done similar before so I'd say do it. Finding well fitting shins is definitely more important than looking normal"
hockeyplayers,39te3n,Coach__Mcguirk,12,Sun Jun 14 16:21:13 2015 UTC,"Have a positive attitude. Both towards yourself, and teammates. Usually you are never as bad as you think you are (or as good). So keep an even temperament. Don't take long shifts. Usually you have more time with the puck than you think you do. Although, remember that you don't have infinite time. Stick on ice at all times. Don't try to be a one man show. Look for the open guy. Always attempt to at least put the puck on net, and low at that. That's how a majority of beer league goals will be scored off of dirty goals. ALWAYS clear the puck high off the glass. Never make a pass in your own zone through center. Pass the puck like you mean it. A hard pass that doesn't meet its target is usually 100% better than a soft pass that misses.  If you drink, bringing a few beers won't hurt for post game. Enjoy it and have fun!"
hockeyplayers,39te3n,OzziePao13,2,Sun Jun 14 16:58:51 2015 UTC,Thanks for the list. I have to work on clearing the zone for sure.
hockeyplayers,39te3n,Lndbrghwrstlr,2,Sun Jun 14 17:02:17 2015 UTC,"To add to this, don't forget to skate with the puck when you get it. The biggest thing for me starting out was realizing I need to keep my feet moving when I get the puck, and it really helps give you more time and confidence on where you'll be able to place the puck.  No reason to be nervous, don't go in full of pride or anything, everyone is there just for fun. Go in expecting to fall and make a fool of yourself and just have a blast doing it"

hockeyplayers,39rpky,MUCKSTERa,6,Mon Jun 15 04:45:30 2015 UTC,"Well I'm shorter and a pretty decent skater, so I knew I'd play forward... Then we realized that I'm great at faceoffs, so I became a center.  I'll still play any position though... It's good to be well rounded."
hockeyplayers,39rpky,sonicwonder,5,Sun Jun 14 21:32:45 2015 UTC,"Well, my coaches growing up stuck me on forward, but then I became really tall, so it became advantageous to have me in a position where I could take up a bunch of space, so now I play D."
hockeyplayers,39rpky,lernington,2,Sun Jun 14 03:08:47 2015 UTC,"Same story as you but with an extra switch. I started at forward (wing), but I was really tall and got moved to D to play club in Bantam. Played D until Junior, where I made the team as a D but got moved to wing halfway through the year. The next year I moved again to center. At this point I'm done with Junior and I'm essentially the ultimate Beer league utility player (just need to learn goalie haha)."
hockeyplayers,39rpky,glochnar,2,Sun Jun 14 03:06:02 2015 UTC,My first team was a mish mash of pickup and stick time players. When our team was created the manager gave us the chance to choose to play D before he started assigning defensemen since we were all forwards. I raised my hand since I don't really care and figured I could save someone from being forced to play D. It worked out okay.
hockeyplayers,39rpky,kr580,2,Fri Jun 19 22:38:29 2015 UTC,I just want to play defense. I never have played organized hockey.  I just think playing defense looks fun
hockeyplayers,39rpky,aaronwhite1786,2,Sun Jun 14 04:58:52 2015 UTC,"For me, it was the extra ice time at a young age. Every kid when you're young wants to score goals and be the hero. I knew I couldn't and wanted more ice. Typically we had 4 D and 10 forwards."
hockeyplayers,39rpky,PM_ME_YOUR_PANINIS,1 point,Sun Jun 14 05:56:39 2015 UTC,Love the icetime if your team runs 3 lines of forwards and only two D lines.
hockeyplayers,39rpky,Skyline_BNR34,2,Sun Jun 14 12:20:43 2015 UTC,I think it's pretty normal to put your newer players on the wing and stronger skaters on D. I just started a year ago so I've been left wing on three teams. It's grown on me.
hockeyplayers,39rpky,p00psicle,1 point,Mon Jun 15 04:46:32 2015 UTC,My team is going to be throwing me on the wing for that same reason.
hockeyplayers,39rpky,State0fChaos,2,Sun Jun 14 05:59:43 2015 UTC,"My coaches said ""Play D"" so I did.  And I wasn't half bad at it.  It helped that I was a larger kid than 90% of the kids in my age group.  Admittedly, I started playing / skating when I was like 3 or 4 so I don't remember a whole lot.  I was never an aggressive puck-chaser either, so that probably factored into it."
hockeyplayers,39rpky,Wetmelon,2,Sun Jun 14 13:29:51 2015 UTC,"Got assigned to a beer league team where the best skaters play D and I was definitely not one of the better skaters, so I ended up as a wing. Usually 5 guys rotate 2 pairs to a period. Honestly for beer league it works out best that way. Given the number of breakaways and overeager guys wanting to pinch, it pays to have your most experienced guys back there, even at the expense of a little scoring. Worked out well for me as a new guy, especially since I always back check hard and cover for our dmen if they want to rush. Made it easier to fit in with more experienced players who appreciate that kind of thing."
hockeyplayers,39rpky,orionthefisherman,2,Sun Jun 14 06:09:52 2015 UTC,Growing up I had bricks for hands but was a pretty good Skater and a little bit bigger so my coach put me on D. As I got older and faster and got some moves I moved to wing in high school. I wanted to play center and worked on faceoffs a ton and now play center on my beer league team and feel really comfortable there.
hockeyplayers,39rpky,LazerMcBlazer,1 point,Sun Jun 14 06:22:47 2015 UTC,"I went the opposite way. Started as RW when I was young. Got to middle school and could skate well and I was 5'7"" (still am). So the best skaters got put on D.  Then I was told I had stone hands during varsity call ups.  Later I was told D is the best way to Varsity. Now I love it."
hockeyplayers,39rpky,PizzaHockeyGolf,2,Sun Jun 14 06:25:37 2015 UTC,"If I ever play D I always end up leading or joining the rush with no regard for human life.

hockeyplayers,39rpky,Pen2Paper,2,Tue Jun 16 04:11:17 2015 UTC,"Nothing but D men in this thread.  Well, here's one more.  I had (have) stone hands and lackluster stickhandling but I've always been a good skater and I can read the play well.  So I just sort of gravitated to D.  In the past year or so I've been forced to play forward a lot more often and I'm discovering my abilities translate there pretty well since I've been working on my shooting.  I can occasionally finish opportunities I create with my speed now.  Mentally though I have a long way to go.  I get lost a lot and find myself out of position and gravitating back toward the defense."
hockeyplayers,39rpky,funkyb,2,Sun Jun 14 06:32:00 2015 UTC,"I kind of always just wanted to be a goalie, so when I started playing I tried other positions, mostly defense, but nothing felt as fun as being in net."

hockeyplayers,39rpky,coneillcodes,2,Sun Jun 14 14:55:48 2015 UTC,When I first started I wasn't so good (duh) so they put me as forward. Then as I got better I still played forward and led the league in goals (or at least that's what my coach told me). In HS I played D and now as an adult I am always available to play D but my team puts me up as forward and taking a majority of the faceoffs.
hockeyplayers,39rpky,Coat_of_aRMZ,3,Sun Jun 14 15:12:51 2015 UTC,"I play right wing because Cam Neely played right wing and Cam Neely is the best hockey player who ever lived.  For a while, I played D even though I was tiny. Now, I'm back to mainly playing wing. Sometimes, my beer league team will try to make me center, but that's because they don't understand that I'm way better at wing, and having good wings in beer league can tilt the ice more than anything. It's all about them breakouts."
hockeyplayers,39rpky,the5thLight,1 point,Sun Jun 14 15:29:45 2015 UTC,I picked right wing because it felt the most natural to me.  I was asked to play center later on and I decided to try it.   Depending on what my team needs I can either play all three forward positions or goalie.
hockeyplayers,39rpky,Libertas_,1 point,Sun Jun 14 13:35:06 2015 UTC,"I started out as goalie cause no other kid would play it. But I wanted to score so I moved out. I score a lot now, so I stayed up front. My defensive coverage is a bit dodgy, so I play wing instead of center.  Oddly enough, I'm a great penalty killer though, and look forward to the shifts. I guess it's just because it's a bit more flowing defense with more space."
hockeyplayers,39rpky,DeleriumTrigger,1 point,Sun Jun 14 15:55:02 2015 UTC,"When I first started playing as a kid, I always ended up coming back on D, even when I was supposed to be playing up. So I just took it from there. Now, it's just because there's always a shortage of good defensemen"
hockeyplayers,39rpky,GoodOleCanadianBoy,1 point,Sun Jun 14 15:59:40 2015 UTC,I was fast and a good shooter so I was put on forward. I never really had interest in D anyway. Then for some reason I became a really good two-way player so I was moved to center.  Now when I play I either play center or D. I play D in the lower leagues I play in as I then am the strongest skater and if I played forward I would score too many goals to play in the lower leagues.

hockeyplayers,39rpky,AviateAndNavigate,1 point,Sun Jun 14 18:40:30 2015 UTC,"I've always been comfortable playing forward or defence. Played forward most of the time, played D when I was in juniors.

hockeyplayers,39rpky,misel71,1 point,Sun Jun 14 18:43:32 2015 UTC,"I've played all 3. Kinda went like this:   When I first started playing, I was a goalie, because my dad was a goalie. Played for about 7-8 years. Was never very good, though. Was the coach of my friends' roller team, and wanted to play for years, but was nowhere near as good as the goalie we had. So I opted to play D, since I wasn't fast and couldn't really shoot. I'm an excellent passer, though. Now I'm a forward because since I'm not fast, I'm less of a defensive liability. It's one thing if I get burned while backchecking as a forward, it's another thing to get burned while playing D. On the plus side, I'm faster and a much better skater now, and I can shoot a little better. I'd say I'm a defensive-minded forward. That's been my journey.   Note: roller, not ice."
hockeyplayers,39rpky,AnthonySytko,1 point,Sun Jun 14 18:52:14 2015 UTC,"As a little kid I wasn't the best skater so winger was the obvious position for me. I've gotten pretty good at wing and that's where I still play, but any pickup games I join I usually play defense because I have more fun playing something I'm not used to. I'm good at getting the puck on the boards and feeding my center, so winger is just where I'm comfortable now."

I just sorta stuck with it throughout youth hockey. I stopped playing when I was maybe 14 and was a right winger up until my last game.  I started playing again last year- now I'm 6'3, 270 lbs, despite my size can skate like a motherfucker, and really, really regret not playing D instead when I was younger."

hockeyplayers,39rpky,SpacemanSpiff28,1 point,Sun Jun 14 20:04:04 2015 UTC,"Wasn't the best skater when I was a kid, so they stuck me at wing. Told me to stay near the net and tap in some goals. I was good at that, so I played drop in as a teenager, worked at the ice rink for 6 days a week. Worked on my skating skills 4 hours a day, and eventually my first female team I played on, decided that i'd be a defensemen since I could at least skate backwards.  I kept getting moved up to play wing, so I stayed there. I still am a way more defensive forward than offense, but also dubbed the playmaker because I could get my teammates the puck a lot easier."

hockeyplayers,39rpky,kman418,1 point,Sun Jun 14 23:30:28 2015 UTC,"Funny story.  Well my very first game I was playing winger. At the time I was out of shape and skating very hard and was getting very tired. After a few shifts I asked if I could play D so I wouldn't have to skate as much.  For some reason I liked it and it seemed like I didn't have to skate as much, probably didn't get as tired because I didn't have to dig into the corners as much, plus my hands were made of stone and I still think they are. Mainly because I either shoot into the chest of the goalie or high and wide.  But I was never an offensive player when I played soccer, I've always liked playing Defense and have become quite good at it, in pick-ups and lower leagues though I'll play offense as it's easy now."

Right now I play RW because I'm a righty and it complemented the other guy I was paired with."
hockeyplayers,39rpky,Vargatron,1 point,Mon Jun 15 04:44:40 2015 UTC,Couldn't skate backwards that well when I started and I'm a decent passer so I chose forward.   EDIT: I find it funny because when I was a kid I played defense and I wear 27 because my favorite player was Scott Neidermayer.

I was ready to quit when one of the coaches had me try goalie.  I loved it and my size was an asset instead of a liability.  I never played out when I was in checking leagues so I might have been a decent skater, but I love the friggin net."
hockeyplayers,39rpky,blarknob,1 point,Mon Jun 15 17:17:44 2015 UTC,"In other sports I've always been defensive-minded more than offensive.  Even as a kid I would play goalie for street hockey all the time (and into my 20s).  When I took up ice hockey I just kind of tried different spots and found that I really like playing forward, but since I'm still good on the defensive side, Center seemed to make the most sense.  Also I seem to always be faster and in better shape than many of my teammates, so having to cover the extra ground to cover the slot on D but also make a rush offensively wasn't a huge burden on me.  And over time, I've also become quite good at winning face-offs, so Center it is.  I'll occasionally cover on D if we need someone back there, too."

I've gone with Bauer gloves since I started playing, but I'm of the belief that go with what feels good. I WILL, however vouch for gloves being one of the things that you should spend money on. When it comes to equipment I always see new people asking what they should get for cheap and what they should actually spend some money on. My last pair of gloves were Bauer One.80's back when those were the top of the line (2011 I think). They lasted me about 4 years, and they were $110 when I purchased them. I got my Totalone NXG's on sale for $97 (clearanced from $134). Spend money on gloves, get something that is protective, durable, and will give you a good feel for the puck."

hockeyplayers,39rq4i,OzziePao13,2,Sun Jun 14 04:23:55 2015 UTC,"I'm currently using a pair of Talon 100s and owned a pair of the Talon 60s before that. The 60s were the most comfortable gloves I had owned up to that point in time. Loved the contoured fit, the overall protection, the comfort of the glove. I decided to stick with Eagle for my next pair and upgraded to the 100s once those came out. Honestly felt a little let down by them, but not for comfort or performance reasons. The 100s are a tapered fit, which was a bit of a surprise because the product page on Ice Warehouse listed them as contoured. I actually liked that more than I thought I would, and the gloves themselves feel really comfortable and have done a great job protecting my hands. Only disappointed because I bought the pair around six months ago and one of the exterior seams on the right index finger has already started to fall apart. Obviously anecdotal and likely not indicative of Eagle products as a whole since their reputation as a glove manufacturer is nothing short of pristine.  I think the reason why Eagle doesn't get as much love anymore is that they used to be leaps and bounds ahead of everyone in the game. That's definitely a harder case to argue now as Bauer, CCM, Warrior have all caught up and offer products that are just as impressive.  In any case, for anyone using this post as a purchasing reference, whatever pair you end up buying, make sure it's got a thumb lock and plastic inserts. It might cost you a little extra cash now, but it's a hell of a lot less expensive than fracturing your hand(s)."

After a few years I decided to replace them with something nicer.  The palms had just eroded away and I decided I wanted to get something that would last longer, so I bought a nice $200 pair of Eastons.  They felt AWESOME.  Definitely a way better glove performance-wise, not that I can really explain it... but yeah.  Buuuuuut they still fell apart... and in about the same time frame as the cheap $30 pair... so I got the re-palmed.  I figured, I'd spent some money on these and the rest of the glove was fine, so why not put some care into them.  Well, repalming cost something like $70.  Well, now it's been about the same amount of time.  I'm starting to think I should just find a good $50-75 pair of gloves, buy 3 or 4 pairs, and rotate them every game I play or something.  I figure because I play so often, sometimes they would still be damp the next game, despite me specifically airing those expensive ones out.  But if I buy multiple pairs, then maybe that just extends the period of time until I have to buy 3 or 4 more in 6 years or so...  Or, I suppose I could keep getting my current gloves repalmed.  I mean, it's about the same as a new pair of gloves, but at least I get to keep the rest of the glove... do I care about that though?  I don't know...  Or I don't know, maybe $200 is still not a very good glove?  Do I need to spend $400?  Now I'm just ramblin'.... this glove situation has been on my mind lately."

hockeyplayers,39rq4i,PAJAMASAM17,1 point,Mon Jun 15 04:57:32 2015 UTC,"Wearing Bauer LTX PRO's, just got them on sale %40 off. Great fit and feel. I couldn't justify spending $200 full price on gloves when there's $140 ones on sale."
hockeyplayers,39rq4i,7sage7,1 point,Mon Jun 15 15:39:12 2015 UTC,CCM 4-Roll Pro... basically the cheapest gloves I could find. I had just started out and couldn't justify spending more than $40 on gloves. The leather in the palms is completely torn up and it's not a snug fit. Don't know if it's CCM quality or the quality of their cheaper products. Looking forward to an upgrade.
hockeyplayers,39rq4i,PizzaHockeyGolf,1 point,Mon Jun 15 16:55:07 2015 UTC,I just bought the CCM 4-Roll pro but the top of the line model. I absolutely love them.   All 4-Roll gloves will have a roomier fit and not a snug fit.  My old pair which where Bauer Supremes one.8 were a snug fit and I liked them I just like the roomier wrists.
hockeyplayers,39rq4i,7sage7,1 point,Tue Jun 16 04:16:06 2015 UTC,"I think you and I have complete opposite glove-fit preferences. That said, I do wonder why the leather in my palm degraded as quickly as it did."
hockeyplayers,39rq4i,PizzaHockeyGolf,1 point,Fri Jun 19 19:30:06 2015 UTC,What kind of tape did you use to tape the top of the stick?
hockeyplayers,39rq4i,7sage7,1 point,Fri Jun 19 22:26:01 2015 UTC,"Plain, white tape (I hear colored tape messes up the gloves quicker). It's one of the major brands, Howies sometimes, sometimes the other one..."
hockeyplayers,39rq4i,PizzaHockeyGolf,1 point,Mon Jun 22 16:20:00 2015 UTC,Try this there is no adhesive so it doesn't tear apart gloves as quickly

The protection is great, and definitely worth putting some money towards.  I've recommended this glove to many others and they've all loved it.  I've had mine for a year and the palms are in fair shape, with one small hole where the butt of my stick rubs a lot.  My next pair will almost definitely be the exact same thing."
hockeyplayers,39rq4i,PizzaHockeyGolf,1 point,Mon Jun 15 21:52:35 2015 UTC,These are great gloves. I however switched to CCM 4-Roll Pro.  Like them just as much possibly more because of the roomy wrists.
hockeyplayers,39rq4i,DicNavis,1 point,Tue Jun 16 04:17:01 2015 UTC,I've got a pair of white and red Bauer 4-rolls that are great for pond hockey.  They allow for a thin pair of gloves underneath for warmth.
hockeyplayers,39rq4i,PizzaHockeyGolf,1 point,Tue Jun 16 04:32:42 2015 UTC,Had a pair of those in High School.  Also good gloves. Let a friend borrow them and never got them back. Didn't bother me because I wasn't going to use them again most likely and now he can play hockey with us.
hockeyplayers,39rq4i,4dotgov,1 point,Tue Jun 16 13:13:44 2015 UTC,I ended picking up a cheap pair of Graf 45 gloves at first. Found a good deal on the Warrior Surge gloves I couldn't pass up.
hockeyplayers,39rq4i,PawneeRaccoon,1 point,Tue Jun 16 18:59:14 2015 UTC,"I've bought a lot of gear on the cheap, and I've learned not to cheap out on gloves. They're the piece of equipment you'll notice the most, so it's worth buying a higher-end model. I personally like more ""tapered"" gloves but that might be because I'm a lady with smallish hands.   I started off with a pair of cheap Bauer gloves, literally the lowest model (X20 or whatever) and while they held up for the season, they really don't feel that great. I really like the Easton HSX Synergy gloves, super comfortable with a nice tight fit."
hockeyplayers,39qx8t,atguy07,8,Sat Jun 13 21:57:22 2015 UTC,"I've only ever ""broken"" one stick in the sense of it snapping. However, without fail my sticks either wear out on the toe (causing the blade to eventually split) or the material inside the blade itself weakens over time (which weakens your passes/shots and makes pretty much everything more difficult)."
hockeyplayers,39qx8t,Hurricane043,3,Sat Jun 13 22:20:28 2015 UTC,"I broke my first stick the last game I played. It was a Warrior Diablo. Lasted for about two years. That's with heavy use, 2-3 games a week and I play defence. Fatigue occurs, the materials weaken over time."
hockeyplayers,39qx8t,Kato91CRX,1 point,Sat Jun 13 22:21:41 2015 UTC,Can confirm. No idea why that stick is so durable but I've used that stick almost a year and it's a horse. Very solid feeling stick.
hockeyplayers,39qx8t,ouah,2,Tue Jun 16 04:13:02 2015 UTC,"I rarely break(as in ""snap"") sticks. I have sticks wear out on the toe and chip. Same with the heel. I'm 6'2"", 220, and get pretty decent flex on a 95 flex stick. I've only broken a couple over the years. This could also be due to the fact I buy new sticks a lot, so I'm not putting a ton of wear and tear on them.  Come to think of it, I don't see a lot of sticks break in general, and I play 2-3x every week."
hockeyplayers,39qx8t,OzziePao13,2,Sat Jun 13 22:48:13 2015 UTC,"I've played since I was 7 and only broke one stick off of a stick stuck in the boards. That was when I was 12. Recently broke my first stick with a shot during a stick and puck session, I'm 20 now."
hockeyplayers,39qx8t,Bleafer,1 point,Sun Jun 14 03:43:18 2015 UTC,I broke my first stick less than a year ago when it got stuck in a crack between board panels. That was a really dumb way to break a stick. Also my 5030 started to crack right down the shaft so I stopped using. I never take slapshots with wood sticks now.
hockeyplayers,39qx8t,YLXV,1 point,Sun Jun 14 00:15:16 2015 UTC,"I'll be coming up on my 5th league soon and I ""broke"" a stick in my 2nd. Not snapped in half broke, but there's a big crack down the blade and I don't think it would survive a slapshot. It's covered in tape and I still use it from time to time (it's a pro stock, the finest stick I've ever had) however I bought a Sherwood T100 to replace it.  I think it's pretty rare to snap a stick like the pros do."
hockeyplayers,39qx8t,oddspellingofPhreid,1 point,Sun Jun 14 00:16:25 2015 UTC,"So many factors... I break a stick about every 8 months, actually snapping them. Generally clappers in warmups of sticks that have been through too many faceoffs, too many slashes, etc.  If I don't snap it in that time its because the flex has gotten to an unusable state from wear and I replace it before it breaks. Entirely depends on the level and intensity of play. I was breaking a wooden stick a month when I was playing contact hockey in midget. Of course, I was using wooden intermediate sticks with very narrow shafts. Those I broke as often during collisions (ie, borderline crosschecks) as they did during shots. I won't lie - a few of those were broken intentionally out of frustration.  But I snapped my golden Easton aluminum that I thought was invincible with a slapshot after two years in Bantam when I weighed 115 pounds. Likely weakened by taking draws.  Faceoffs are stick killers."
hockeyplayers,39qx8t,aradil,1 point,Sun Jun 14 01:05:31 2015 UTC,"Touche. I play C league so I'm bet very few guys have the strength and technique to really put wear on my stick that way.  Then again, I wrapped the lower shaft of my stick with tape precisely because of faceoffs and slashes."
hockeyplayers,39qx8t,oddspellingofPhreid,1 point,Sun Jun 14 01:30:12 2015 UTC,"Ya, I couldn't play with a stick taped like that."
hockeyplayers,39qx8t,aradil,1 point,Sun Jun 14 11:19:01 2015 UTC,"Haha funny you ask this. Ive been playing for 11 years and i have yet to brake a stick during play. I have to admit ive broken a couple after the whistle (over the post) but other than that ive never snapped it from a shot. I come in a 6'1 260 lbs (i know right) with a 102 flex stick, i get good flex...just never broke."
hockeyplayers,39qx8t,yacadelic,1 point,Sun Jun 14 06:40:31 2015 UTC,I would snap about a stick a month when I played bantams at about 130 pounds.  Haven't snapped one in a few years now that there is no checking/slap shots.
hockeyplayers,39qx8t,Nodak651,1 point,Sun Jun 14 06:41:55 2015 UTC,"I usually go through 5 sticks in a season (8 months). Most of them just wear out, usually at the blade but sometimes the shaft gets too flexy after time as well. I literally have my room full of sticks that are just worn out and I usually just turn them into outdoor sticks, since it doesnt matter if the bottom of the blade gets damaged at that point."
hockeyplayers,39qx8t,mootland,1 point,Sun Jun 14 12:55:48 2015 UTC,"I've snapped 3 and had another disintegrate.   All from slapshots, two were damaged from faceoffs and slashes and I knew they were on their last legs. One snapped on a slapshot after I cross checked the post (so I didn't run into it with my chest), and the other one the blade got cracked over time and was about as useful as using a pool noodle for a blade.   For me my sticks are lasting longer the more I play defense vs playing center. Average stick lasts about 2 or 3 seasons, with 3 games a week or so.   Oh and I broke one on purpose after I got tripped up going to the net and literally ridden into the boards and getting injured. I was just pissed off and slammed it against the boards and it broke. Oops."
hockeyplayers,39qx8t,Gibson19,1 point,Sun Jun 14 14:45:59 2015 UTC,I usually break 1/year of men's league hockey. I know lots of guys who go through more. Centers and guys who have the puck a lot tend to go through more than me.
hockeyplayers,39qx8t,crsmith,1 point,Sun Jun 14 15:38:20 2015 UTC,"I don't think I've ever broken a stick from roller hockey.  Just not nearly as much force from a street hockey puck to an ice one in comparison.  When I play frequently, I'll probably make a decent stick last nearly a year at a time.  My most memorable break was on a one-timer.  The blade went into the net, the puck didn't.  Oh yeah, it was a one-piece."
hockeyplayers,39qx8t,Brzostek,1 point,Sun Jun 14 21:19:15 2015 UTC,"I've broken a stick about once every year on average.  I've never broke one from a shot though. My first stick didn't really break, but the blade had a huge crack in it, and I only have it to mess around on pavement right now. I think this is a 75 flex stick, but I haven't used it in years as it sits in my garage.  My first real stick that broke completely was my SE16, I flexed it in the locker room after about a year of playing and the shaft snapped. Wish I would have taken a slapper with it to break it, but it was going to break on my next shot regardless, probably got too many slashes on it. This stick was used when I was learning to play so I'm surprised it lasted as long as it did because of terrible technique on slapshots and other items, but it was a 75 flex.  My Vapor X:60 had a very bad crack in the shaft and I knew it was going to break soon, I tried to make it last but I took a shot in warmups and the stick just bent and failed at the crack. Probably took a few good slashes on it too. This was an 87 flex.  My Nexus 1000 broke after a year of playing after a guy around 200 pounds got tripped up and fell right on it while I was holding it. Snapped at the shaft which sucked because it was a great stick. This stick was a 102 flex."
hockeyplayers,39qx8t,Skyline_BNR34,1 point,Mon Jun 15 04:37:36 2015 UTC,"I've never snapped my stick myself, a kid sat on my stick in Peewee that's it.

hockeyplayers,39qx8t,PAJAMASAM17,1 point,Mon Jun 15 15:44:36 2015 UTC,"I have played with composites for over 10 years now.  I never broke any aside from just chipped toes and heels from normal game play.  In the last 2 weeks, I have broken three sticks.  1 blade in half on a face off, one shaft from a blocked slapper, and one literally just leaning into the flex on my carpet at home.  Apparently they come in threes."
hockeyplayers,39qx8t,badseedjr,-8,Mon Jun 22 17:13:42 2015 UTC,You're clearly not playing hard enough if your sticks last that long.  I break a lot of sticks just above the blade. They snap forward. Probably from taking most of my teams faceoffs.
hockeyplayers,39qc6s,drbenwayy,2,Sat Jun 13 18:48:57 2015 UTC,"Took advantage of this last week. Got the low kick point versions of each stick in 95 flex, Ryan curves. It's a fantastic deal. I had 10.00 in their ""rebound rewards"". So it cost me 120.00 total shipped.  I like the T100 I had prior that I paid 170.00 for, so this is a literal steal for these two sticks.  Great puck feel, and durability with both models."
hockeyplayers,39qc6s,OzziePao13,2,Sat Jun 13 21:37:25 2015 UTC,"As a person that only buys Sherwood due to the Ryan curve being pretty unique I've never had good luck with SW mid kickpoint sticks. I buy their top of the line stuff(T90/100 1st gen, these are 2nd gen) and the blade seems to crack a lot. The low kickpoint, the N12(used it til it ran out of pop) and EK 15(doing well for 6 months) have lasted me a long time though."

Every Saturday and Sunday at around 1pm guys start showing up. There's always a decent turnout and it's really competitive. Sometimes there's goalies sometimes not but it's always fun. The rink itself has seen better days and there are a few cracks on the surface but you don't even notice them once you start playing. I play there all the time. There are plans to tear down the rink next year and replace it with more playground equipment so get some skates in while you can. There is a Facebook group called Brooklyn Roller Hockey where on the weekends people  confirm if they're playing or not but honestly if it's not raining out there will always be hockey happening

hockeyplayers,39ord0,PizzaHockeyGolf,12,Sat Jun 13 08:30:22 2015 UTC,"It's probably not hockey, it's physical activity. Did you work out during that time frame?  For me, if I go a few days without working out/playing hockey/doing something physical I get grumpy. I feel lazy and lethargic and frustration sets in with a vengence. The only exceptions are when I do a vacation or something along those lines.  The reason? Stress release. Working out/intense physical activity is great for helping you releave stress. You get a literal high from it. Getting into that rythm, then taking it away without replacing it with another form of stress relief (or removing yourself from the stresses of every day life a la vacation) is a sure fire way to find yourself in a bad mood.  That's my guess, you took away your hobby and your main source of stress relief all at once. Why wouldn't you get grumpier?"

I've also talked to people on my team who have said the exact same thing going from skates like the old 70s to the 160s... If you swap the sole, it's almost the same skate. I would think especially if you are just starting, you won't notice the difference. I was in CCM for years before switching to Bauer... The 160s are very lightweight and supportive, I'm a huge fan. I've probably played almost 150 games in them so far and they have very little wear. I've never regretted not spending the extra money on the 170s."
hockeyplayers,39qct9,BryzllyBear,2,Sat Jun 13 19:33:51 2015 UTC,"I bought some 170s a few months ago and love them. The supreme fit is the best for my foot, too. The reason I went with the 170 over the 160 was due to stiffness. I had been skating for a few months in boots that were too big, but I liked the stiffness they offered. So, When I tried the 160s on at the store, my ankles felt like they had absolutely no support. It was personal preference for me that led to the 170 purchase,  because those had the support I needed. I wasn't too concerned with what the boots were made out of so much as the feel and level of stiffness. I would say try them both on and whichever stiffness feels more what you're accustomed to, go with that one. I have absolutely loved the 170s so far.   Edit: Should have probably asked you this, but how much skating experience have you had? Is there a store you can go to try some of these on?"
hockeyplayers,39qct9,TheGhostOfSagan,1 point,Sat Jun 13 20:29:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I tried on vapor skates, ccm, reebok, nexus, and supreme, and the supreme felt the best, it had good ankle support, as well as it felt like it held my heel the best in the boot, and with some of the other skates, they were shallower, so they were too tight across the top of my foot.  When I go back, ill try on the 160 as well, and if it feels as good as the 170s in those respects, ill buy them and get a pair of insoles to go with them. Hopefully that will really help me to jumpstart my skating ability! (bought $50 size 9 skates from canadian tire in march, didn't know about skate size being smaller because I wear a 6 skate)"

After shipping, the ABHS cost me $100. I just got a clearance Easton V9E for $140. SO SO SO SO worth the few extra dollars."

I tried 5/8 which helped with my stopping on my weak side but couldnt dig in on my turns. The problem with used skates is you dont know what skating style the previous owner preferred. I had my skates profiled and it made a huge difference. They shop said i had a high spot in the middle. Your problem may be different but profiling helped me big time."
hockeyplayers,39pjpq,willdesignforfood,1 point,Sat Jun 13 20:29:35 2015 UTC,They're brand new.  What does profiling do?
hockeyplayers,39pjpq,Skyline_BNR34,4,Sat Jun 13 16:41:56 2015 UTC,You don't need your skates profiled. I think you just need to learn how to stop properly if every time you try to stop you turn. If it was the blades not digging in you'd slide out and fall rather than turn.
hockeyplayers,39pjpq,thehappyfalcon10,1 point,Sat Jun 13 17:06:59 2015 UTC,"I agree that you have to learn how to stop if your just turning but I think having them profiled will still help. Profiling is the curve of your blade from front to back. Imagine a 10 foot round hoop, if you had your skates profiled to 10 foot the the radius of your blade will be the same as that hoop. Hope that makes sense. The reason I think profiling is good is because the higher the number the harder it will be for agility, but you will gain in speed and turns, the smaller the number the better agility but you will loose speed. You have to find the right radius that works for you. I started 9 1/2-10 foot radius. Huge improvement."
hockeyplayers,39n4lf,g1f2k3j4,8,Fri Jun 12 22:42:51 2015 UTC,"So I just did that and I had my right hand on top, does that mean that I shoot left?"
hockeyplayers,39n4lf,kr580,8,Fri Jun 12 22:49:16 2015 UTC,"Correct. Generally the way you hold a push broom or shovel translates into your natural handedness with a hockey stick as well. Really, it doesn't make a whole lot of difference when you're starting out anyway so pick the side that feels more natural and you're off to the races."

hockeyplayers,39n4lf,go_sens,2,Sat Jun 13 19:56:10 2015 UTC,"This is the right answer. If you had your left hand on TOP of the shovel, then you need a RIGHT handed stick"
hockeyplayers,39n4lf,Firsmith,8,Sat Jun 13 13:52:50 2015 UTC,"Learned this today (I'm Canadian and dominant hand is at the top)   If you scroll down the roster of any National Hockey League (NHL) team, you will likely notice the prevalence of players who shoot left-handed. This is odd considering that 70 to 90 percent of people are right-handed. As it turns out, most American-born players grip the stick with their dominant hand lower. This means American-born righties use right-curved blades, and lefties use left-curved blades. The opposite is true for most Canadian and European players, who usually grip the stick with their dominant hand at the top.  The reasons for this geographic discrepancy aren’t exactly known, though there are a few theories floating around the hockey world as to whether a player’s dominant hand should be at the top or bottom of the stick. This guide discusses the theorized pros and cons of where to place your dominant hand.   Read more at: http://icehockey.isport.com/icehockey-guides/determining-your-dominant-hand-in-hockey"
hockeyplayers,39n4lf,BleedBlueToDeath,4,Fri Jun 12 23:01:14 2015 UTC,"I suspect it's due to baseball, where the non-dominant hand is at the end of the bat. That's made it hard for me to go dominant hand on top as I've learned to play, I played baseball as a kid."
hockeyplayers,39n4lf,Firsmith,4,Fri Jun 12 23:10:15 2015 UTC,Yep - that was something the article mention. A lot of Americans learn baseball first and the hand position carries over

hockeyplayers,39n4lf,lernington,2,Sat Jun 13 02:09:58 2015 UTC,"handedness: how do you hold a broom?  that's your hockey stick orientation.  I go dominant hand on top, but it's really just a matter of personal orientation.  Many people go dominant hand low.  It's not really a choice so much as what you're naturally geared towards.  Also, I personally believe that everybody should learn to play with a wood stick.  Once you can stick handle and shoot effectively, you can switch to composite, but the sticks nowadays allow you to get powerful shots without proper form, and being forced to learn to shoot properly will help you maximize the potential of whatever stick you use."
hockeyplayers,39n4lf,GoodOleCanadianBoy,1 point,Sat Jun 13 04:26:04 2015 UTC,"It's not a stupid question at all, don't worry about it. As you can tell, everyone is different. The absolute best thing you can do is go into a store and just try a left handed stick and right handed stick and see which one feels more natural. IMO, while the shovel example is really good in general, tons of people do different tasks with one handedness and play hockey with the other."
hockeyplayers,39n4lf,the_aarong,-1,Sat Jun 13 04:23:19 2015 UTC,"If you're right handed, you want your right hand on the bottom of the stick. You can go into a shop and ask to see the right handed sticks and they will show you. It is also distinguished online. In my opinion, finding the right flex is probably most important for your first stick. I remember getting a stick that was way too high of a flex my first time and it made it really difficult to put solid shots on goal. You can find good deals on eBay sometimes and it can save you some money if you know what you're looking for."

Most rinks have a summer in-house league, I usually play at the Canterbury summer In-house.   Currently, that i know of, the only winter In-house league is at Sydney ice arena, which I'm currently also playing and we're actually looking for more players, so it's not too late to join.   Info here for SIA sunday league: http://sydneyicearena.com.au/in-house-hockey-leagues  as you can see half the games still remain.   This league is very suitable for beginners as the average skill level is development league/division 4 and some guys may actually be able to play division 3. But overall if you're looking to start getting some game experience this is great place to start.   Once this one finishes you can join the summer in-house league and keep practicing.   Other options include scrimmages which are some what similar to games. I currently attend the Canterbury scrimmage on Friday nights at 10:45. If interested get there at 10:10-10:20. It cost only $14 and we finish at 12:00.    Hope that helps and hopefully see you around."

Because scrimmages are open to every one, the skill level is very broad. It ranges from development skills all the way east coast and AIHL skills level. The usual crowd is quite mixed, around 4-6 east coast players, 5-7 development and the rest are anywhere from division 4 to division 1. So very mixed level.  But don't be afraid to come to the session though, as you wont be alone in terms of being a beginner, plenty of us there.

I was even more disheartened when I learned how crazy hard and painful on the ankles skating was, so I gave up very quickly. Not saying all kids are like that, but maybe think about introducing them to ball/floor hockey first where they can immediately jump into the fun parts and experience the rewards ice hockey can eventually bring them.

Try to go to a mid week early skate, so it's not as crowded. It's not fun trying to keep your little one up while you have tons of people skating all around. Plus the ice doesn't get as chewed up and make it even harder to skate.

Its a fun exercise and the kids love it, but most importantly you start to see which one they are better with."
hockeyplayers,39liry,dangerfang,1 point,Fri Jun 12 19:38:50 2015 UTC,Does your hockey shop not have the flat wooden youth stick?  I know mine has it so you can buy that stick and whatever way the kid picks the stick up and uses it you can then buy a curved stick later.

hockeyplayers,39liry,ZapfBrannigan,1 point,Fri Jun 12 20:38:50 2015 UTC,"I disagree with the stick thing, you get them a flat blade stick and you tell them to hold it the way THEY feel comfortable with.  My LHS always have the Youth sticks with flat blades on them for that exact reason.  But then again, that young of an age you can make a kid learn to shoot both ways fairly quickly.  Don't ever force something onto a kid."
hockeyplayers,39liry,londongarbageman,1 point,Sat Jun 13 02:08:39 2015 UTC,Ditto on flat sticks. I coached mites this past year for the first time and was surprised when two of the kids switched hands a couple weeks into the season.

hockeyplayers,39n8a9,the_aarong,1 point,Sat Jun 13 00:18:01 2015 UTC,Got mine replaced midway through my season this past winter.

hockeyplayers,39n8a9,Knobdy1,1 point,Sat Jun 13 02:48:07 2015 UTC,A place about an hour away that I had heard of by some friends.
hockeyplayers,39mkuy,celt1299,3,Fri Jun 12 20:17:51 2015 UTC,"Practice, unfortunately. It's very hard to transition from puck handling in your living room to puck handling when an opponent is dead set on taking it away from you. Confidence helps so the more you practice at home the better you can do, but nothing is a perfect substitute for actual game practice.  Try looking for smaller games.. hunt around for 3v3 cross ice games or check your area for ""mini rink"" facilities. This may be cheaper or more common than full ice games and these sessions will generate a lot of experience holding a puck under pressure.   Another option can be can teaming up with one or more skaters at stick-n-puck sessions. 1v1 keep-away in a faceoff circle can work, take turns with a partner to give both of you a workout. A third skater will be even better because you're gonna run out of breath fast and breaks help.  Less focused is just play at drop-ins or play more games. In general the further you keep the puck from an opponent the harder it is to take away from you, so next time you're skating make that your goal."
hockeyplayers,39mkuy,xzzy,2,Fri Jun 12 20:42:11 2015 UTC,"If you're sprinting with the puck and you don't have to protect it, just push it.  Don't bother stickhandling.  Just push it in front of you and sprint.  The coach where I do adult learn to play lessons is always telling people to quit stickhandling when they're alone through the neutral zone. Now that I've been playing a while I see why.  Beginners, and even some pros, tend to lose it with too much unneeded stickhandling ."
hockeyplayers,39mkuy,greenlion22,2,Fri Jun 12 21:43:32 2015 UTC,"I played almost my whole childhood and teens and was never very good at it, always was playing lower tier skill levels.  When I was 18 or 19 me and a couple friends played ball hockey on rollerblades for fun for like an entire summer almost every day.. and my hands improved SIGNIFICANTLY.. I'm talking going from only being able to skate 3 strides with it and losing it to walking around defenseman and I still have those skills 10 years later.  Moral is, practice pratice practice and repetition and a lot of it. Everyone in my adult teams think I played varsity and I was god awful back then."
hockeyplayers,39mkuy,Aurion1,2,Fri Jun 12 21:45:35 2015 UTC,What happened to me was I was ok when I was stickhandling in warm-up and stuff but I would lose it when I was going fast. What was happening was that I would get down low when I was going fast and the toe of my stick would come off the ice (too much heel) I got a lower lie and cut my stick shorter and I have improved soo much.
hockeyplayers,39mkuy,morgantheron,2,Fri Jun 12 22:32:37 2015 UTC,"Are you certain you have the right stick lie and a reasonable curve? Is most or all of the blade on the ice when you are in your typical skating stance? I see a lot of guys with the wrong lie. And when I started, I struggled to keep the puck too. Eventually I switched from a 6 to a 5 and it made.a.huge difference."
hockeyplayers,39mkuy,orionthefisherman,2,Sat Jun 13 04:31:02 2015 UTC,"As a goalie, the best way is to cut the blade completely off your stick, and tie your skate laces together.  (oh, wait, would you be on my team or the other team?)"
hockeyplayers,39mkuy,rfinger1337,1 point,Mon Jun 15 17:19:08 2015 UTC,"Been playing for 5 years now and finally feel that I can keep my head up under pressure without loosing the puck. Getting confident with the puck while skating will take time, practice and patience. For me, I found I improved in leaps after a couple major changes. I started playing back to back nights which meant repetition in training. Stability in my skating meant I spent less time worried about falling and more time working on handling with my head up. I started using a p46 Bergeron curve which cups the puck a little more than most blades on the forehand  Because of this I am finding that I spend more time with my head up accelerating, watching plays and space develop and less time staring at the puck. I've also made it part of my warm up to work on my stick handling in motion. Skate around head up with the puck working on control and lateral movement. You'll likely spend more time in warmup with the puck then you will the entire game so make use of this time wisely.  Finally be ok with getting the puck taken away from you from time to time. In the offensive end with no support? Try to stick handle your way out of trouble :)   Good luck!"
hockeyplayers,39mkuy,mediahaze_,1 point,Sat Jun 13 00:31:56 2015 UTC,"A tip I've learned is to do the move you want to do earlier than you think necessary.  That will help you pull off moves. If that is not your problem, get one of those balls that weighs the same as a puck and just practice at home."
hockeyplayers,39mkuy,PizzaHockeyGolf,1 point,Sat Jun 13 07:59:15 2015 UTC,Make sure that your stick is the right length.  I shortened my stick by 1.5 inches and it made all the difference.
hockeyplayers,39mkuy,i_yac,1 point,Sun Jun 14 23:41:39 2015 UTC,"Sometimes if you're not confident in your hands, you can overthink things or get flustered under pressure. The best and most long-term-beneficial solution is to develop sick hands - get a Smart Hockey ball and play with it as much as humanly possible.  Until then, work on turning your wrists over and cupping the puck with your blade, forehand and backhand. If you're strong on your skates you can learn defensive positioning to keep stray pokechecks and stick lifts away as well."

Most of the time I actually play better in my second game since I'm warmed up. Best advice I can give is to stay warmed up after your first game; keep those muscles loose. Do your best to hydrate during your first game. I bring a protein shake and throw some carb powder in it for quick energy after game 1 (mix half water and half almond milk about 8-10 oz)...gives me some sustained energy for the next game."

I also have  EE/left and D/right skates.    Be warned though, my doc was pretty adamant that it's unnecessary to have the hardware taken out unless it's causing considerable pain, so he wouldn't perform the surgery.  It's also likely that your insurance will fight paying for it.  I do want it out, but I'm also hesitant to go through that nerve block shit and crutches for a few more weeks."

It doesn't have the same physics as a puck, but to be honest there is almost nothing that perfectly emulates puck on ice. The biscuit, as others have mentioned, is good for shooting and stuff as shooting with a ball is a hell of a lot easier than with a puck (in terms of putting it where you want, not in terms of velocity etc.).

hockeyplayers,39jj14,DrRopata,2,Fri Jun 12 06:35:17 2015 UTC,"Serious question: when you say winter, does it ever freeze there?"
hockeyplayers,39jj14,cgvandam,3,Fri Jun 12 16:16:06 2015 UTC,"Not in most places. In the central South Island there are a few small lakes/ponds that occasionally freeze right over, enough for a curling tournament. But that is rare. We always get snow down to sea level in my town Dunedin at least once, the central regions more often. And we get icy frosts most winter whenever it's a clear night. We get temps below freezing over night regularly. But most day temps are above that."

hockeyplayers,39iyog,PointXIV,3,Fri Jun 12 01:21:42 2015 UTC,"Check out Greater Seattle Hockey League.  It is a pretty competative, well run league that plays their games at about six different rinks around the city.    They just started their summer season, which finishes up around mid-august.  There will then be another tryout / rating period in September and the fall/winter season will run October to April.    There is another league that plays on Sundays.  This league is smaller and a bit less competative.  There are others around but I primarily play in GSHL and BEHL while subbing on other games as well.  Good Luck!"
hockeyplayers,39iyog,goalieguy930,1 point,Fri Jun 12 01:30:10 2015 UTC,"Seconded on the GSHL. Pretty competitive league with tiers ranging from 1-8, some with A/B/C levels throughout."
hockeyplayers,39iyog,digupthedead73,3,Fri Jun 12 18:44:51 2015 UTC,"Adding on to what /u/goalieguy930 said, there's pickup hockey Saturday nights in Kirkland and sometimes Shoreline.  There's also a 3 on 3 ""pond hockey"" that's played on a small rink down in Renton: http://snokingpondhockey.com/#/home/page/3 The summer season is about to start in July.  There's also the OVHL(plays at Olympicview in Mountlake Terrace) and Cascade Hockey Leage(that plays mostly in Lynnwood and Everett) but I've never played in either of them.  All in all quite a bit of leagues to choose from and all rinks are within 30 - 40 mins of Seattle proper.  The rinks around the area:   Kingsgate in Kirkland Highland in Shoreline Olympicview in Mountlake Terrace Xfinity Arena in Everett (where the Silvertips play. There is also a community rink in the same building) Lynnwood Ice Center in Lynnwood Castle Ice in Renton Kent Valley Ice in Kent   And here is a map of all the rinks in the area to give you an idea of where they are."
hockeyplayers,39idth,NapoleonBlownapart87,9,Thu Jun 11 22:43:51 2015 UTC,"Wait them out. They're waiting for you to make the first move. If you make any move one way they can go the other. Wait for them to make the first move and when you react you'll be going the same way to be able to defend better. Also, watch their hips. They can't go anywhere without their hips going that way too.  Also, don't be afraid to hold your ground and bump them a bit. It depends on how the refs call it but if you close the gap so much that you 'gently' put your body into them they probably aren't going to call checking. That'll throw off any toe drag ideas they had. Match their speed and just get closer until your in their grill. Defend the body, not the puck.  Work on closing your feet too, that's usually what gets me."
hockeyplayers,39idth,kr580,3,Thu Jun 11 23:06:24 2015 UTC,"Just to add on to what was said here, I normally watch their body to keep myself at the appropriate speed to stay between them and the net. If they try to go by you, just stay with them, no need to check them, but if you play it right they might try some lean/hit move and just hold your ground. However, most of the time if you do this right, experienced players may try to shoot through you using you as a screen, with that in mind, I try to keep my gap in a place where I can reach a stick check out to stop the shot."
hockeyplayers,39idth,brian_2008,3,Thu Jun 11 23:34:44 2015 UTC,"Like Shakira said, ""Hips don't lie""."
hockeyplayers,39idth,ImosPizza,3,Fri Jun 12 14:51:55 2015 UTC,"I can't emphasize enough to almost never make the first move.  Like pinching, you have to be over 100% sure that you're going to knock the puck away when you poke check.   Good players are looking for you to make that move so they can do something flashy and zip right by you.  Frequently you can wait them out and as long as you stay between them and the net, they'll work themselves to the outside and do your work for you.  Don't present them with any holes or opportunities to get by you."
hockeyplayers,39idth,Bengerm77,1 point,Fri Jun 12 16:13:57 2015 UTC,Can't agree more. NEVER make the first move. Play you outside shoulder to their inside shoulder and just wait them out.
hockeyplayers,39idth,PizzaHockeyGolf,3,Sat Jun 13 08:37:23 2015 UTC,"Success on the toe-drag happens because the defender slows down, stop up, or flies by the opponent, so you are probably slowing up more to stick check than you think.  I agree with the other posters, wait them out and watch the body. You can probably close up the gap more than you are. Try to maintain speed and look aggressive, in my experience the best result comes from playing the opponent as if you are going to take the body. Take the angle so that you keep them to the outside, and when you angle in to try and take the puck, go hard and fast as if you are going to hit them. :) One advantage to this approach is that  if you miss, you can crosscut back the other way and pick them up again, hopefully."
hockeyplayers,39idth,mikepick,3,Fri Jun 12 02:15:20 2015 UTC,"I had a lot of trouble with this as well. Eventually I just did what others mentioned. I look at their hips, put stick on puck as best as I can with my peripheral vision and follow their body. Most of the time they end up running into me and the puck goes out of their reach, or directly under me but we are tied up at that point."
hockeyplayers,39idth,mattfki5g,2,Fri Jun 12 16:03:23 2015 UTC,"A lot of good advice in other comments here, so I'll just add on that when you go for the poke check you don't have to hit the puck. Make your ""poke"" more of a ""sweep"" and even if you miss the puck you can hit their stick. A lot of time it can disrupt them enough to let you catch up and get back in position."
hockeyplayers,39idth,Hurricane_Viking,1 point,Fri Jun 12 16:25:13 2015 UTC,I just stay in front of there body. Make them literally go through you instead of around.
hockeyplayers,39idth,NoClue22,1 point,Fri Jun 12 22:36:10 2015 UTC,"They can't get by you if you don't pinch on them, If your playing defense, give them the shot instead of trying to break up their possession. If you'r going the same speed as them they can't drag around you. And if they pull it back to protect it, don't go for the poke because they can pull it back to the front just as fast."

hockeyplayers,39j6na,OzziePao13,3,Fri Jun 12 03:28:52 2015 UTC,"You are moving to the right place in terms of always having the opportunity out there to play. I play on 2 NESHL teams and do Stinky Socks a couple times a month. Overall the expierience in both has been very positive. Stinky Socks does a better job of keeping the skill levels where they should be. Also, the games are never really that late in the evening, and it's pretty much pay as you go (no  commitment). NESHL is more organized. Stats are kept. Rosters are checked. However, there are definitely more ringers playing down a level or 2. It's not too bad, and overall is a lot of fun. They have draft player teams, as well as full teams in each division. If you were to join a draft team and like it, chances are that team would probably decide to go forward as a team in the upcoming seasons (which brings the price down a bit, as they seem to really whack draft payers for $$ per season as far as I can tell.). Both are great though. As I said, no real bad experiences in either."

Worth it for the people though. I love playing there.  If you're west or south west, try KCIC.  My kids both play there.  I can't speak to the adult leagues, but I'm going to get into summer league there this week.  If you're East / Southeast try Independence Events Center.  I've played pickup there once and the ice is great, facility is awesome.  My kids love playing there.  In the winter The Ice at Burlington Creek has evening and weekend morning pond hockey.

You can cut off about four inches without affecting it.  If you're set on Warrior, they made the DT series in 55 flex, also the new QR series is avaialble in 55 flex as well. At least it'll have a bit more give once you cut it."
hockeyplayers,39g3j4,nolovedeepmeta,1 point,Thu Jun 11 14:32:55 2015 UTC,I have a Reebok RibCor (a cheaper one) that I cut down.  I'm 5'6/5'7.  I cut it down from 60 flex to 65.  I can flex it still.
hockeyplayers,39g3j4,Ruff_Dog,2,Fri Jun 12 16:24:46 2015 UTC,I got a 60 flex Easton RS II and the length was significantly shorter than the 65 flex version. I didn't need to cut it at all and I usually cut 2 to 3 inches off normal INT sticks. I don't know if that's a standard for all sticks or if it was just something Easton did with the RS II.
hockeyplayers,39g3j4,sinnet,2,Thu Jun 11 19:25:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah I was pretty close to buying a an Easton V9e (they're on sale at the moment for only $90). The 60 flex version is only 55"" which is the perfect size for me so I wouldn't have to cut it down at all. Looks like an amazing stick too,  exactly what I want.   I decided against it after reading about Easton's durability issues (particularly with that stick). I don't want something that's going to break within a couple of months."
hockeyplayers,39g3j4,sinnet,1 point,Fri Jun 12 04:46:11 2015 UTC,"I was slightly worried about that but it's been a year and a half and mine is fine still. I only play once a week though. Anyway, if it breaks now it was worth it since I got a stick that actually fit me instead of a $100 stick that I don't like at all."
hockeyplayers,39g3j4,spartanKid,2,Fri Jun 12 13:19:13 2015 UTC,"I personally think that the ""flex-free"" zones are all gimmicks. Simple physics says that by cutting a stick to a shorter length, you're shortening the lever arm and making it harder to flex.  That being said, I think the flex free zones probably mean that the uncut stick is actually a lower flex than stated, and if you cut the full flex free zone, it's probably higher than stated, so they just assume most people cut 2ish inches off and get the stated flex.  I am not sure what you're using now, but I believe graf makes some 65 flex sticks in INT sizes."
hockeyplayers,39g3j4,BlazePenguin,1 point,Thu Jun 11 15:04:35 2015 UTC,"What is the flex on the One.4?  Is it a jr or int?  How is that stick working out for you length/flex-wise?  What is your weight?  Someone help me out but doesn't warrior have that ""flex free zone""? I haven't been in the market for sticks in a while but I know they used to at least have a few inches.  55 is the lightest INT flex I've seen? Best plan IMO is to buy the cheapest sticks you can in the flex you want until you find that perfect flex for you."
hockeyplayers,39g3j4,BlazePenguin,1 point,Thu Jun 11 17:39:50 2015 UTC,I weigh about 150 pounds. The One.4 is an intermediate stick with a stock flex of 67 and a mid kick point. The flex is 70-something now that it's been cut down a couple of inches. I had a lot of trouble flexing it when it was 67 and now it's almost impossible.   I'm hoping to find 55-60 flex intermediate stick that can be cut down a couple of inches without losing flex.  I've seen a few people mention Warrior sticks having free flex zones in forum posts and stuff but can't find any official info on it. Wish I could get a straight answer. I'd love to get a 55 Flex QR1 or something and be able to cut it down a few inches and maintain the same flex.
hockeyplayers,39g3j4,ArrogantOwl,1 point,Fri Jun 12 04:29:39 2015 UTC,"Awesome thanks for all the details! That's not fun having a stick like that. Yeah I swear I've read it somewhere about the Warrior's but now can't find anything on it, so the urban legend continues...  I think either way, 55 is as low as you're going to find for an intermediate stick. I think you'll be really happy with it even if there is no flex zone and it gets bumped up to ~60!"
hockeyplayers,39g3j4,Skyline_BNR34,1 point,Fri Jun 12 17:58:48 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure a BASE stick would be your best option, can customize a good bit on them."
hockeyplayers,39g3j4,lernington,1 point,Thu Jun 11 22:13:11 2015 UTC,"I see you got the standard INT flex, you'll need to see about finding an INT in the 60 flex range or lower if they have it.  You're going to have to get used to the flex and learn to lean into your shots a bit more with the stiffer stick if you can't find anything lower than a 60 and you say 67 was a bit much. You'll learn to use the stick and flex it in time. I was able to learn how to use my 102 flex stick after I was using an 85 for awhile.  And I just looked, it looks like in the current crop of sticks, Warrior is the only one that offers a 55 flex INT stick, all others only go down to 60."

hockeyplayers,39g3j4,RegisteredSock,1 point,Fri Jun 12 15:12:15 2015 UTC,"Sherwood's have them, I believe Warriors do as well but the intermediates are larger than normal.

hockeyplayers,39g3j4,kingofthediamond,2,Thu Jun 11 14:38:21 2015 UTC,"Weird, I've always had an easier time flexing mid kicks"
hockeyplayers,39g3j4,kingofthediamond,2,Thu Jun 11 18:16:20 2015 UTC,Well thats personal preference. You may tend to lean into shots more instead of your upper body.

hockeyplayers,39g3j4,kr580,1 point,Fri Jun 12 04:38:22 2015 UTC,I don't think Warrior advertises this. I only found out by randomly speaking with I think it was a rep who confirmed it.

hockeyplayers,39g3j4,Skyline_BNR34,1 point,Thu Jun 11 18:31:09 2015 UTC,"I could be wrong but I think it depends on what kind of shots you take. Low-kick sticks are supposed to feel whippy for wrist shots and snap shots,  while mid-kick sticks are easier to flex when taking slap shots. Apparently it also depends on how much you lean into your shots."

hockeyplayers,39g3j4,Vargatron,1 point,Thu Jun 11 16:15:33 2015 UTC,"Try and find a stick with a low kick point, you can get them as low as 60 flex in intermediate.  If that's still too stiff for you, you can buy plugs for junior size sticks that will increase their length. It's just a matter of heating up the glue and sticking them in, then cutting them to the right length. Take five minutes and only costs a few dollars. Here's an example. Just keep in mind that you might need a stiffer flex then before if you plug your stick."
hockeyplayers,39e3pl,NYDevilsFan,4,Thu Jun 11 03:18:03 2015 UTC,I got an Easton V9 stick. Originally $260.00 down to only $100.00! Use the code USAGOLD for breakaway membership and an additional 10% off! I just ordered mine for only $90. Almost a 1/3 of the price.
hockeyplayers,39e3pl,Floyeah339,1 point,Thu Jun 11 03:18:18 2015 UTC,Guess I should have waited the extra 5 days. Just picked up a V9E for 142 thinking that was a great deal.
hockeyplayers,39e3pl,tl790,1 point,Thu Jun 11 11:26:27 2015 UTC,I don't need a stick at the moment but pretty hard to pass up $90 for a high end stick originally $260. Nice stick to have around if/when my others break.

hockeyplayers,39e3pl,funkyb,1 point,Thu Jun 11 05:46:53 2015 UTC,I mean Easton is a popular brand and getting a stick which was 260$ for almost 1/3 of the price is too hard to pass up. That code though I think also gets you a 30$ e-gift certificate for TotalHockey about 2 weeks after your purchase. I think it also gets you a gold membership for TotalHockey.

hockeyplayers,39e3pl,Skyline_BNR34,1 point,Thu Jun 11 15:44:38 2015 UTC,I've had a stick shipped straight from China for $32. It should not cost that much to ship from the U.S. To Canada.

hockeyplayers,39e3pl,about22pandas,1 point,Thu Jun 11 17:07:09 2015 UTC,If anything they usually have all the deals first and some really low priced items.

hockeyplayers,39e3pl,morla74,1 point,Thu Jun 11 19:28:18 2015 UTC,"FYI your proshop will probably match, or match after shipping. We do for clearance items and regular priced items we're the same or lower.   Also if you went into a Total Hockey store, the entry level priced items they have on the internet they markup instore. For instance socks are $41.99 instead of $39.99, so if your LHS is doing the same thing on anything under $50 give them some slack.  As for the whole email list thing, its pretty crummy personally. They bought it from USAHockey and send it out to everyone, so they have a huge audience for their ads even if they are unwarranted. Its great business practice for them, but shitty for everyone else."
hockeyplayers,39e3pl,jmar31,1 point,Thu Jun 11 18:50:59 2015 UTC,A handful of dollars like that I don't mind but when it comes to some bigger ticket items like sticks and skates and you are able to save $50+ then it's a bigger deal.
hockeyplayers,39e3pl,morla74,1 point,Thu Jun 11 19:29:35 2015 UTC,"Lol I got downvoted.  In fairness, I've never seen a proshop be $50 more on an item. Hell, I have a hard time believing it - must be a very greedy owner. I'd be in the same boat, I wouldn't pay $50 more for an item. I'd have a hard time paying more than $20 for an item. At the same time, I've never seen a store, for instance, have the Bauer MX3 skates at $899 instead of $849. We have them for $699 and I know several other places that are at that price as well or at $749. Same deal with sticks, MX3 is at $269, I haven't seen a store above that, and I've seen plenty the the $229 to $249 range.   Sounds like you just live in a shitty hockey area if the prices are that expensive for gear."

hockeyplayers,39epvx,OzziePao13,1 point,Thu Jun 11 22:42:20 2015 UTC,Depends on what you're getting. I think they had some sticks for 100 and less but they were left handed.
hockeyplayers,39epvx,OzziePao13,1 point,Fri Jun 12 02:42:29 2015 UTC,"I don't man, 99.00 or less seems to be the max I've ever had to pay for a pro stock at Pure Hockey, Hockey Monkey, Prostockhockey.com , or the Boston and Providence Bruins equipment sales. 150.00 seems steep. At that price point, you are better off buying a closeout top model, getting the exact curve and flex you want, and getting the warranty it comes with."
hockeyplayers,39drp2,ezeeetm,7,Thu Jun 11 02:04:09 2015 UTC,Can you share a video of all the different shots you practice off the ice? I will take a look and make some suggestions.   If you could also include an on-ice shooting video that would be amazing. I'll do a side by side comparison for you with mark-up and voiceover.
hockeyplayers,39drp2,howtohockeydotcom,1 point,Thu Jun 11 03:53:13 2015 UTC,Out of curiosity is there much difference in techniques and mechanics of shooting on ice vs shooting on roller?  I have a roller rink a mile down the road where as my ice rink is an hour drive away.  Am I hurting my ice shots?
hockeyplayers,39drp2,Itsafootlong,1 point,Thu Jun 11 21:19:31 2015 UTC,"In my opinion up until the elite level, almost anything you do related to shooting is better than doing nothing. You might pick up one small bad habit, but all the other things that crossover will trump it, and that small bad habit (if one is even developed) can be worked out on the ice"
hockeyplayers,39drp2,howtohockeydotcom,1 point,Fri Jun 12 03:57:24 2015 UTC,"What bad habit might that be?  Or in your opinion would it be better I not know as it not ""self induce it""?  One thing I have noticed is my roller balance is terrible compared to my on ice balance when it comes to shooting.    Edit: obviously an ice pick isn't going to move on a sport court surface as well but would shooting them while on roller skates help more than a roller puck?"
hockeyplayers,39drp2,Itsafootlong,1 point,Fri Jun 12 12:47:22 2015 UTC,"No bad habit in particular, there is just a chance some adjustments may need to be made. Typically on inline players are more upright, so force yourself to get lower. Also there are no edges like on skates, so dragging the toe is common."
hockeyplayers,39drp2,howtohockeydotcom,1 point,Thu Jun 18 16:53:40 2015 UTC,"Yes I would love to do this.  However, before I devote the time to making the video, and take you up on your offer...do you have any fundamental bullet points (eg. top down) for shooting on ice that will firm up my base.  Like, orientation of feet, hips, shoulders to direction of shot, should I try to bite with the edge of my front foot (kind of like the ""pushback"" I do with front foot on land) or should I point my skate in direction of shot and skate off with shot?  honestly, any fundamental top down tips you can give me now might make me so much better before I make the video if that makes sense.  I know for a fact that I'm doing nothing right at the moment...my upper body is just way stronger and more confident than my skates can counter at the moment, and I know its mostly technique/placement/orientation, because when I'm not shooting I my skating is rock solid.  when I shoot, insta-toddler."
hockeyplayers,39drp2,howtohockeydotcom,2,Fri Jun 12 02:26:11 2015 UTC,"I'm really interested in seeing what you look like now, as having a strong shot off the ice, and weak shot on the ice is a common problem, so I kind of don't want to taint the data. Shoot a few quick videos and I'll give you some guidance shortly after.   Also, after I see the video my advice will be a lot more targeted and will help more than any general advice i can give you now."
hockeyplayers,39drp2,trf84,2,Fri Jun 12 03:59:09 2015 UTC,"I'm still a total novice myself, but I've discovered a few things that you might find useful.   First, pads are bulky, so make sure you're cocking your top-hand arm out to maximize its range of motion when shooting.   Second, and this might just be personal experience, but if you have the opportunity to do so and not get hit by a stray puck, try taking some shots with your gloves off. I find it gives me a much better feel for how I'm using my stick, and in doing so makes it easier for me to focus on my weight transfer and follow-through when taking a shot.   A third tip I might throw in is that you should work on your balance. Skating only on your front foot, dropping your back knee towards the ice as close as you can without touching it and then standing back up gets you used to balancing on that foot through a range of motions. Alternate legs, too, since you'll need to balance on the other leg for snapshots.  As a final note, I would make sure that you're bending your knees enough. Seems trivial, but getting even a little bit lower can give you much better control of your weight as you go through the shot."
hockeyplayers,39drp2,GeneralKrunch,1 point,Thu Jun 11 02:19:06 2015 UTC,"When I first started, I always wore roller blades when practicing on dry land. It helped me carry the shooting ethics better onto the ice. Also, don't just practice shots without gloves. My little brother had trouble adjusting to shooting with gloves because of less grip.   Hope this helps!"
hockeyplayers,39drp2,ohcrocsle,1 point,Thu Jun 11 19:34:56 2015 UTC,"how do you place your feet when shooting?  do you follow through with the front skate pointed in the direction of the shot and skate off to get rebound?  do you dig in the edge to get that good push back counter force that you'd get shooting on land?  what I'm missing is ""what to do with my waist/hips/knees/feet when shooting so I can shoot hard and have my base stay solid"""
hockeyplayers,39drp2,apbenoit,1 point,Fri Jun 12 02:33:35 2015 UTC,"The problem is that shooting on ice is not skating. You may feel comfortable gliding around, striding, etc., but you probably feel uncomfortable shooting or if a puck comes to you and you need to change direction, stop, or move around. Stickhandling is probably uncomfortable as well as dealing with a puck that gets in and around your skates.  The key to being comfortable with the puck (and shooting) is to be comfortable standing still and making small movements. To get used to this, just stand still on the ice and be comfortable with staying in one spot, then pretend a puck is coming one way or the other and make a quick step and then stop and go the other way. You can even get a puck and just bounce it off the boards 5-10 feet away and move back and forth to pick it up cleanly. Being comfortable making those small movements will make you more comfortable with the puck and definitely help you learn to be solid and have better weight transfer when shooting.  Also bendyourknees"
hockeyplayers,39drp2,apbenoit,1 point,Fri Jun 12 01:40:16 2015 UTC,"You may feel comfortable gliding around, striding, etc., but you probably feel uncomfortable shooting or if a puck comes to you and you need to change direction, stop, or move around.   Yes, this is definatley part of the problem.  However, even if I grab a pile of pucks and just hang out on the faceoff spot and shoot one afte the other from a stationary position, or just coast and shoot against the boards and grab the rebound, i cant shoot anywhere near as hard and coordinated as I can on land without skates.  my follow through sort of throws my skates out from under me.  Im missing something important (or some things) technique wise, I think it might be foot position, hip/shoulder orientation, or something.  I understand I'll never shoot on ice like I can on land just because of physics but the disparity right now is vast, and its all about the lack of a stable base to shoot ""against"" if that makes any sense at all...."
hockeyplayers,39begq,tobyrich,18,Wed Jun 10 16:50:20 2015 UTC,"Well... 2 things- A.

Seems you might be in the wrong division, unless I am totally missing something(which I probably am)."
hockeyplayers,39begq,OzziePao13,27,Wed Jun 10 17:20:11 2015 UTC,I now live in the desert. There isn't a lot of old guy hockey to choose from out here.

I think the thing you'll have to just understand is that there will be guys that welcome your advice, as well as guys that scoff at it. Chances are you are going to be more knowledgeable and skilled than a good majority of your teammates and opponents. Just keep doing what you are doing, help the guys that want the help."
hockeyplayers,39begq,Lndbrghwrstlr,3,Wed Jun 10 19:39:42 2015 UTC,"Also make sure you are fully aware of how you are dishing out your criticism. Guys who don't actually know where to go are always open to advice, but people are going to defend their beliefs if your advice sounds even a little bit like you're attacking them for being out of position. As a new player myself, my buddy always is telling me what I could have done better that shift, but he is also always telling me what I did well too. Typically, just preface it with a ""good hustle"" or ""almost had one there"" kind of thing, and word what you're trying to say carefully enough."
hockeyplayers,39begq,ludo_kressh,2,Wed Jun 10 17:32:20 2015 UTC,Completely agree here.  One thing I have learned when trying to help someone improve (by giving constructive criticism) is to start off by telling them what they are doing right and then move in to where they can improve.
hockeyplayers,39begq,mccarseat,8,Thu Jun 11 15:18:00 2015 UTC,"I'm on the flipside of that. I WANT help about where I need to be and when.   If I'm playing with a new group of people I'll usually make sure I let them know I'm still learning my ""hockey sense"" and would love any and all constructive criticism. Some I listen to, some I don't, but I love the feedback.  Otherwise I found people would clam up and just be pissed and not pass it to me."
hockeyplayers,39begq,von_neumann,2,Wed Jun 10 17:34:40 2015 UTC,"I'm with you, I'd love it if someone on my team would give me constructive advice/criticism. There was one guy who always said the same unhelpful things like ""Take a look around! I was wide open and yelling for the puck!"". Unfortunately he was consistently behind me, and I haven't developed a pair of eyes in the back of my head, and god knows who is yelling what, that is every dirty hockey player's first trick is to call for the puck when the newb on the other team has it. I did have one D-Man explain to me to hug the half-boards if he had the puck down low so he could pass it safely to me. Now he does so all the time and I generally can catch my center streaking or at least bounce it up the boards and out.  I'd love to get some of the guys together and work on set plays sometime, but with my current team that seems like a pipe dream."
hockeyplayers,39begq,Skyline_BNR34,1 point,Wed Jun 10 20:05:47 2015 UTC,Watch a lot of hockey to try and see where those guys are going. It really does help out to know where and how plays can develop.   It won't be the same but seeing the pros do it will help.
hockeyplayers,39begq,MrMilano12,3,Thu Jun 11 14:19:18 2015 UTC,"I've always prefaced criticism with a ""I'm not trying to be a dick, but I think if you took this tip it would improve your game"" kinda message. I've been playing in a intramural league this season and two of the guys are very clearly new. Last night I told the one guy his skating would benefit from a deeper knee bend and he thanked me for the tip and said that he always listens to me because the things I say work/are true. I actually played on the opposing team last night (since they were down players) and still talked to the other guy about how to angle out a player defensively on my ""new"" team.  I think part of it is the ego of the player you are talking to (i.e. there's one guy on this team I call ""Sid"" who thinks hes an all-star who I wouldn't even try and talk to).  Keep doing you man, the people who want to get better will listen."

hockeyplayers,39begq,squeebie23,6,Wed Jun 10 21:15:17 2015 UTC,"Well, I guess he's just going to have to learn by not getting any passes.  Also, consider taking his daughter's anal virginity. It may humble him some."

You are not paying me nor giving me handies, so shut your yapper. (I don't actually believe this, but I understand people who do)  I've been playing with the same group of skaters for 3 years and there are still skaters that I will not even consider talking to on the bench for various reasons.   I have found that some of those skaters just prefer to not have their flaws put out in front of other people and so I make it a point to come to them after the game and speak 1 on 1.   Others don't like me personally (I'm kind of a blow hard) and so I give pointers to my captain about them and he passes it on. Another couple of my skaters simply don't remember specifics of their shifts and just nod their heads even when I know they have no idea what I'm talking about.  These skaters get drawings on Keno slips, or salt and pepper demos at the bar.   You have to know your team to be a good teammate.  Simply applying a ""well this works for me, so it should work for him/her"" discredits the complexity of team politics.  You are an asset to your team. You get hockey and want your teammates to understand/play the game to the best of their potential.  All you need is a little finesse and understanding."

hockeyplayers,39begq,Hurricane_Viking,1 point,Wed Jun 10 23:05:37 2015 UTC,"This is a huge one. I'm always telling my teammates (on the bench, with a lot of pointing) things like ""hey, on that faceoff, cut right in front of the net and I'll hit you with a pass"" or ""when we get a 2 on 1 like that and I'm behind you, I'm cutting to the center once we cross the line, so fire it low an on goal, don't try to drop it behind you"".  It really helps when you both know why you're trying to do something, and then it works and gets you a good scoring chance or saves a goal in your own end."

It's when you treat me like a peewee player that I have a hard time. Don't fuckin' cuss at me or yell at me.   When I get back on the bench say ""Hey, I think you might be better off if you do this instead of that.""  Too many beer leaguers think they're Herb Brooks and yell at people. Fuck that."

It was/has been open and then you can do Z."" If you phrase it as a suggestion to make a better play for you and them, then I don't think as many people would be getting upset about it.    So for example on a breakout, if your wingers aren't coming low enough, instead of just saying ""Get down lower on the breakout"", try to phrase it as ""When we are breaking out come down lower and turn so I can see your blade. I can make a better pass and then we can get out of the zone."""
hockeyplayers,39begq,Belsekar,1 point,Wed Jun 10 20:19:04 2015 UTC,I try to dish out like 5 compliments for every 1 piece of criticism.

hockeyplayers,39begq,eigenman,1 point,Wed Jun 10 20:26:47 2015 UTC,"I've found that giving advice to a group rather than singling out one guy tends to help people deal with receiving criticisms better. As in, when you get back to the bench maybe talk to the whole line or the whole bench and say something along the lines of ""hey guys, whoever is on the right side of the rush, try to stay a little closer to the guy carrying the puck because they're leaving big holes there."" Even if they aren't necessarily leaving big holes, trying to make it sound like you noticed something and everyone could benefit from it rather than just outright telling the right winger he needs to keep up seems to work a lot better. Some guys are just really bad at handling criticisms and if you make it seem like less of a personal criticism, it seems like guys actually listen to the advice rather than just immediately trying to come up with why they aren't in the wrong and ignoring everything you said."
hockeyplayers,39begq,thecanadianswede,1 point,Wed Jun 10 21:18:29 2015 UTC,"It's human nature in a competitive environment to resent individual criticism from an ""equal"".    In my experience captaining teams or just trying to fix something; just address the entire team.  Don't call out individuals.  So instead of ""Steve you need to get on the d man point on this faceoff"", it's ""Hey wingers, let's see if we can get out to those D points faster off the d-zone draw"".  Believe me, the chances of anyone actually changing their game mid-stride is slim.  But occasionally guys will say in their heads, ""yeah other winger who sucks over there, get on your point"" when they are the actual suck-bag.  In turn they tend to pick up their game and do what they are supposed to do.  The worst is being a captain and having a majority of your team come complain to you about a specific player's style of play or habits.  It's a tricky thing to handle."

Like you I have been playing for over 20 years, but I certainly didn't play elite hockey or even at the college level. I would welcome any kind of advice because I am always trying to improve. However, I have seen the guys who are at a same or similar skill level as I try to be the team's coach. That's a little annoying, and while I'm not saying that is what you're doing, it might be kind of lame if you're having everyone huddle around you to give the team a speech.

I never played college, but I had a lot of years in youth hockey at competitive levels and now coach.   So back at the bench if a guy is like, ""Hey man, you got caught low on the break out and should have been streaking up the side but you cut to the center."" I'll give the ""I know, I know,"" response, which probably sometimes comes off as impatient or defensive, but in my head I'm actually taking your criticism as totally valid.   It's not quite what you're talking about, but I mean, I guess what I'm saying is just keep checking in with those guys in a way that's totally non-aggressive. I think it's always good to preface criticism with something like, ""Hey man, I'm saying this as much for me as for you, but next time try to look for me here."" or like ""Yo, I'm used to looking up for a guy coming across the ice like this... if you could do that when we're leaving/entering the zone we could be connecting there 100percent of the time.""

I always try to tell the guys who are constantly out where they should head or even that a forecheck doesn't need 3 forwards in the offensive zone.   Just be calm. Eventually they will see you and the other players doing it the proper way and they will adjust. Hopefully. I'm still waiting on my guys to lol.

We have a pretty big talent gap between our floor and our ceiling, and are trying to split into 2 teams, but for now it is what it is.  Being the captain and manager helps for obvious reasons, but I've found a few strategies that work pretty well.  Number 1, make it very clear to the entire team that you won't hesitate to give constructive criticism, and that when you do, it's for the betterment of the team, as well as the individual players.  Number 2, make it very clear to the entire team that even though this is supposed to be fun, and that it's casual hockey, everybody on the team is expected to be committed to improving as a hockey player and striving to be the best that they can be.  If it's obvious that a person is not doing this, they will be ostracized, and eventually told that they aren't welcome on the team anymore.  Number 3 is to try to address issues to the team as a whole.  Don't name names, but specify what things that you see as an issue.  Most of the time, the individuals know when they're guilty of the cited action, and furthermore, it gives the rest of the team examples of things not to do.  I don't know if these steps will be helpful to you, but they've worked for me.  Hope this reply helps, I know how frustrating this problem can be.  And for somebody with a competitive background, all you want to do is skate them until they learn some goddamn respect, but you have to treat them with respect and dignity, simply because of the nature of the league.  It's a fine line, but there are ways to get your point across."
hockeyplayers,39begq,howtohockeydotcom,2,Thu Jun 11 04:53:15 2015 UTC,"Good advice here. That is exactly what our captain does: addresses everyone as a team during intermissions and between shifts, as well as before and after games. He always starts with praise, both for the team and for individual players, even after we lose, and then provides constructive advice. I can remember only one time, after a first period, we were being outshot, like 12-3 or something, but the score was still 0:0, he said to all of us we had been playing like ""s@#$."" We ended up winning that game 1:0."

You can of course do that and there are probably situations where it's preferred, but in most cases, you have to move your stick back to cradle the puck.   I actually move my stick a little towards the puck before it gets to me and then try to move backwards with the puck as it comes. Imagine trying to ""meet"" the puck, but a split second before it comes, you start to pull away and cup the puck.  The reason I do that is to make sure I possess the puck where I want it, usually right in front of me, instead of almost a foot to either side. So, to allow me more space to ""cradle"" or ""cushion"" the puck and still have it stop where I want it, I move towards the puck to create the extra space.

Think about catching a baseball, your glove always gives a little when the ball hits your mitt. I had the same problem (I've been playing for 18 months, in a league for about a year), and it will just take time and practice to get the hang of it.  The best thing I can suggest is that, when warming up, instead of shooting it at the goalie (fun, and useful for the goalie, but useless for someone who can't even collect a pass), find someone on your team and just pass the puck back and forth. Start close, and slowly move further apart. Same thing with power, start soft and get progressively more aggressive with your passing."
hockeyplayers,39c39o,7sage7,1 point,Wed Jun 10 19:42:38 2015 UTC,"Try this: make your arms a bit straighter, open up your bottom hand, and hold your stick more parallel to your shoulders (but of course, blade on the ice). Your top hand shouldn't be tucked in at your waist, but a bit farther off your body. This will give you some more room to let the puck absorb into your stick and receive it softer.   But mainly, practice, practice, practice. Find someone to pass a tennis or hockey ball with (or just shoot it off a wall to yourself and receive it). Practice during warmups, when you can."

Don't slash at people or crosscheck or anything like that (some contact is OK, but think ""I'm going to push him out of the way of my goalie"" not ""I'm going to break my stick across his back""). Everybody has to go to work in the morning. And next season you might be on a team with the guy you're battling with.  3) Play hard. When you're out there keep your feet moving, keep your head up, and face the play/puck. Then get the fuck off. Short shifts.  4) Know your limits. This is related to playing safe, but if you bowl over another player because you can't stop or turn, you're a hazard (to others and yourself) and you're not helping your team.  5) Chirp a bit, but realize that you also suck pretty hard and keep it light hearted.

hockeyplayers,39avug,stevetehpirate,1 point,Fri Jun 12 12:53:06 2015 UTC,I am very sore.
hockeyplayers,39avug,rfinger1337,2,Fri Jun 12 20:13:27 2015 UTC,"If I have anything going for me, I'm in really good shape...so the only sore spot I have is on my left inner thigh, a bruise from being too short and trying to hop the boards the way my taller teammates did. Definitely learned that lesson.  We got crushed (12-6) but it was a blast, and we definitely switched up some things for next week. We're playing 4v4 and 2 halves as opposed to periods, our second half was much better than the first after we made some adjustments. I expect we'll be pretty good in the coming weeks!"
hockeyplayers,39avug,HughMirinBrah,2,Fri Jun 12 21:14:17 2015 UTC,"Same here. I don't mind getting my ass kicked. I love hockey. We had to make some serious adjustments, we had three first timers on our side and we were only had three people on the bench. Definitely had some long shifts. Finally they moved a guy over to our side and we made an effort... sorta. Either way, it was amazing and I can't wait to play again."
hockeyplayers,39avug,Jeembo,2,Sun Jun 14 05:30:34 2015 UTC,"1) you are never going to make the nhl so you don't need to check or punch anyone.  2) take short shifts, twice up and down the ice and get off.  3) pass to the open man.  And if you find yourself in the other team's zone and don't know what to do, put the puck in their net, it's always a good play."
hockeyplayers,39avug,Mitcheli1,1 point,Wed Jun 10 16:16:57 2015 UTC,"I still get excited for every game. This sometimes leads to me rushing passes or shots.

hockeyplayers,39avug,trf84,1 point,Wed Jun 10 17:16:20 2015 UTC,You can drain 60 minutes of energy in one shift. If you over work too hard on one shift you risk killing your legs and lungs for the rest of the game. Make your shifts about seeing how quickly you can completely drain your tank. Go 100% on the ice and then get off. A hard 1 minute shift can accomplish way more than a loafty 2 minute one.
hockeyplayers,39avug,trf84,1 point,Wed Jun 10 23:47:16 2015 UTC,"Make sure your gear fits and is in order.  This is cliche- but go out and just have fun.

hockeyplayers,39cuvu,1966mopar,1 point,Thu Jun 11 01:18:36 2015 UTC,Agreed. I had this happen to me months ago from just clutching my stick tightly when making a play. I felt it immediately. It still hurts sometimes and has taken a while to heal.
hockeyplayers,39cuvu,EchoTango77,1 point,Thu Jun 11 22:22:15 2015 UTC,"I won't rule it out but pretty sure it's not. It's very external, almost like the skin is trying to callus but so as long as I don't take slap shots the pain is almost nonexistent even if I'm pressing down the area."
hockeyplayers,39cuvu,nudave2005,1 point,Mon Jul 6 05:05:28 2015 UTC,Which finger and/or fingers? If it's only one finger its probably not nerve pain.
hockeyplayers,39cuvu,nudave2005,1 point,Fri Jun 12 15:14:13 2015 UTC,The index finger. Imagine the first section where it makes contact with the stick. The tension from slap shots are causing pain.

hockeyplayers,39a71t,whosjellisnow,3,Wed Jun 10 14:13:25 2015 UTC,"I said this on a different thread as well, but unless one of those signatures comes with a check with 7 zeros I don't see how this would happen. PSU made the jump because Pegula paid for it to happen. A hockey program is about as expensive as it gets, and it's doubtful it would ever make money. Without donors shelling out big cash I can't see a school taking that on."
hockeyplayers,39a71t,RDC123,1 point,Wed Jun 10 19:19:37 2015 UTC,"I don't think they need anything near the money that PSU got, provided they can negotiate use of the Prudential center.  PSU needed the cash because they had to build an ice rink from the ground up, because they're in central PA and there was literally nothing else there aside from their own small rink.  Rutgers is a 15 minute walk from the prudential center, which means they could look at playing there, or perhaps find another suitable venue nearby since they're in the whole NYC/NJ area.  ASU is playing at a rink that's a car ride away from campus so it's not without precedent that the school could just find somewhere nearby to play even if it's not on campus.  That would bring the cost of the program down into a much more manageable range."
hockeyplayers,39a71t,funkyb,2,Thu Jun 11 15:41:10 2015 UTC,"""Rutgers is a 15 minute walk from the prudential center""  The Newark campus is, the actual campus is about an 8 hour walk from the Prudential Center.

hockeyplayers,39a71t,dsatrbs,0,Thu Jun 11 16:56:17 2015 UTC,"40 minutes is a long trip when you're relying in part on support from the student body and university community. Non-campus venues tend to be a struggle, Miami football has terrible attendance at SunLife stadium, which is a 45 minute free shuttle ride from campus.  The Newark campus is 11,000 students. Main campus is 40,000. An arena needs to be accessible to the actual campus, not a satellite."
hockeyplayers,39a71t,RDC123,0,Thu Jun 11 17:10:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I won't be signing the petition then.  There's 40,000 students that can be bused over, and 11,000 students down the street.  I certainly wouldn't support building a new ice hockey arena.  edit: I say the above as a current Rutgers student. Tuition increase for more facilities? No thanks. I'd very much like to see us with a D1 hockey team, but unless they can figure out an off-campus arena, I'd rather they stay D3 or wherever they are now."
hockeyplayers,39a71t,dsatrbs,1 point,Thu Jun 11 17:33:52 2015 UTC,"You wouldn't see tuition increase as a result of this. Most NCAA D-1 teams are self supporting and you'd need some (a million or 2) startup cash to get it going from private backers. Plus, the school is already planning to upgrade the RAC, might as well add an ice rink while they're at it."
hockeyplayers,39a71t,dsatrbs,1 point,Fri Jun 12 10:56:38 2015 UTC,"Most NCAA D-1 teams are self supporting    That's not true.

It needs to stop."
hockeyplayers,39a71t,RDC123,0,Fri Jun 12 13:11:31 2015 UTC,"Enrollment =/= down the street. Newark is an urban campus, odds are most people enrolled are not living on campus. The main campus is your typical college campus with dorms etc., for a team to have any chance of being succesful an arena would need to be local to that campus. As I pointed out, 40+ minutes is killing attendance for college football in Miami, and that's 1 day a week. Expecting student support when they'd have to travel 40+ minutes in the winter is totally unrealistic."

Used gear can be found at Play it Again in Plano or McKinney, and there's Replay Sports in McKinney too. In Tarrant County, the pickins are slimmer - the NYTEX shop just moved a little ways offsite, and I think that's it.  (EDIT: The NYTEX shop was officially called Blades by Todd. They're still in North Richland Hills, but they apparently also have another location in Farmers Branch.)

hockeyplayers,39cbpa,pavlovs_monkey,3,Wed Jun 10 20:38:09 2015 UTC,"Rather than spamming multiple subs, this is what I typed up for your ""how to buy"" question in /r/hockey, before I realized it was the same OP.....  Echoing what /u/nablock says. I'm in Lewisville, and you actually have several options for trying on skates. True, the brick-and-mortars tend to sell the newer, pricier stuff, but go in and learn about sizing. (The guys behind the counter are friendly everywhere I've been, and won't try to pressure you into a sale.) Then, knowing your size, and what kind of fit you like, go out and look for skates that came out in 2013 or 2014, or maybe even 2012. They're new, but they're taking up space, so the prices are more reasonable.  Also, some people will tell you not to buy used. Skates are thermoformable, meaning they can be ""baked"" to fit more securely around your ankle and foot. So, used skates are shaped like someone else's feet, and might not work out for you. I bought a pair of Easton EQ30s when I started out a couple years ago, brand new, for about $130."
hockeyplayers,39cbpa,pavlovs_monkey,2,Wed Jun 10 20:48:57 2015 UTC,"Another note on the baking and sharpening of skates: both are included when you buy brick and mortar. You would have to pay separately for those services if you bought online.  Don't get me wrong, there are amazing deals to be had online at places like Hockey Monkey in the clearance section. It just isn't a good idea to buy random skates online if you have no idea how they will fit your feet."

hockeyplayers,39amt7,kingofthediamond,3,Thu Jun 11 12:37:14 2015 UTC,"Honesty you wont find a ""decent"" stick for under $50. Must sub $50 sticks are the low end models. Even older models wont go that low. For your money I would say the lowest you could spend is $80"
hockeyplayers,39amt7,dazosan,2,Wed Jun 10 13:40:47 2015 UTC,"You can get perfectly respectable composite sticks for $60 (I have a Vapor X70 that I love to pieces), or you can get a perfectly good wooden stick for less than that."
hockeyplayers,39amt7,kingofthediamond,1 point,Thu Jun 11 04:36:40 2015 UTC,"you can get a stick for under $50. But decent or respectable is pushing it. Well actually it depends on your definition of ""decent"". I assumed the OP wanted something not basic. Correct me if I'm wrong. I was thinking a mid-low level stick which the price point is $80-$100  And you could definitely get wood if thats your thing. OP wanted a composite."
hockeyplayers,39amt7,dazosan,1 point,Thu Jun 11 05:08:12 2015 UTC,"What's not decent or respectable about $50-60 sticks?  Does OP need to spend extra for extra performance? The only thing I've ever heard that's different about mid and high-tier sticks is the weight -- they have all the same construction, features, and builds. If you can deal with 100g or whatever of extra weight, OP, you'll be fine."
hockeyplayers,39amt7,kingofthediamond,1 point,Thu Jun 11 13:29:20 2015 UTC,"Pretty much performance and weight. Just like high end sticks are all the same, the low ends are generally the same as well. I have had such bad experiences with the lowest end models that I don't like recommending them. He doesn't have to spend extra money but generally that price point I'm suggesting, lasts the longest, has a decent level of performance, and weight is good. For a little extra cash you can get a much better stick. However you mentioned mid and high end sticks. High end sticks are drastically different. They are built for performance, so weight is a huge factor. The mid levels are built to last. So performance is usually decent and because they use sturdier materials they last longer. The low levels are built to be basic and not offer too much performance wise or weight. They are built to be cheap. For beginners or guys who dont know the difference.   Its like adding bacon to a cheese burger, you dont need the bacon but it makes it just a little bit better."
hockeyplayers,39amt7,kingofthediamond,1 point,Thu Jun 11 14:48:37 2015 UTC,"We're just going to have to agree to disagree on this one. I've owned top level sticks, top of the line, fresh on the market (including a memorable incident in high school where I got a Mission M1 and broke the blade in my second game), and I have never noticed a difference in my own performance between them and the $60 sticks I use now (if my PointStreak stats are any indication I've actually been playing better without them).   And aside from all that, for beer leaguers it really just does not matter. Paying for performance is great but at some point you're wasting your money on marginal to no improvement."

They can make up for the flaws in the instrument better than a novice can.""    Just because you didn't notice a difference does not mean its not there. I am in no means telling OP to buy a high end stick. I'm just saying that for a ""decent"" stick (which in my opinion is one up from the basic) he may have to pay a bit more. I would say $80. Just consider science for a second: 100 grams less can cause an increase in speed in a shot. Even if its marginal its still an increase. It could be the difference between a goal and the goalie stopping it"
hockeyplayers,39amt7,kingofthediamond,1 point,Thu Jun 11 17:44:18 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I figured as much.  I see there are a ton of good options around $80. Any recommendations on good sites?

hockeyplayers,3994wf,ciabattabing16,1 point,Wed Jun 10 04:59:43 2015 UTC,I'm sort of in the same situation. My league doesn't keep score or stats but the level of play is very fast and they call it low level. I'm not going back in the fall. What I would do if I was in your shoes iis when the idiot hotdogs get the puck just move over and don't even skate and tell your goalie just to move out of the net and let him score. It's not fair that you should miss out on ice time because of those idiots.
hockeyplayers,3994wf,1966mopar,3,Wed Jun 10 10:20:43 2015 UTC,"I've been on the receiving end of many beat downs, it sucks. It happens at all levels.    lifting sticks, taking away the puck from anyone he could and taking shot after shot   So... they were playing hockey?  As long as they weren't whooping and celebrating every goal after about the first five or being dicks about it, I don't see why they shouldn't keep playing hard. Nobody is taught to play hockey gently once you get a lead.   Sounds like you need to take this up with the league, not be upset at a team that is more skilled than yours."
hockeyplayers,3994wf,throatsplooshers,2,Wed Jun 10 17:24:50 2015 UTC,"so you think its fair that an elite level player is in a c+ league?

hockeyplayers,3994wf,1966mopar,2,Wed Jun 10 21:13:46 2015 UTC,"No, it's not fair.  OP can take it up with the rink, or opt to not play. Sounds like they got that issue sorted out.   My issue is complaining about a team that plays hard hockey. Maybe there's more examples, but the ones provided - taking the puck from opponents, lifting sticks, and shooting the puck (over and over!) is how the game is played.  I don't understand why playing the game that way equates 'lack of respect'.    What would be preferred? Every time the crappier team fumbles the puck, the good team just flips it out of the zone and allows them to regroup? Bring the puck into the offensive zone and instead of shooting, dump it in the corner?  I'd be more offended if a team played me like that instead of working for goals, no matter how lopsided the score."
hockeyplayers,3994wf,throatsplooshers,1 point,Wed Jun 10 21:57:59 2015 UTC,"The post is more about the league not taking action on something than it is about their play. I read back through my post and realized I left quite a bit of context out for the example I provided but to be honest, you're right, they played hard hockey and that's what we do. The lack of respect is that, yes, they were celebrating goals after they were up 5 to 0; they celebrated the thirteenth goal too- at least most of them, there were some guys on their team who didn't take part in that. The one player I was describing was doing those things in the last 2 minutes of the game- when it was beyond clearly over- and it felt like he was just rubbing it in at that point, but that's my perspective of it.  I also think you're right about which would be more preferred, playing down three or four levels or rolling over the other team? It's not an easy question to answer and while you may find it more offensive to play down others may not. There's no easy solution but the league should be trying to balance out the skill levels better. The post title is very clear, I needed to vent, but that doesn't mean I'm right about it; it's how I felt at the time and I needed to get it off my chest."
hockeyplayers,3994wf,throatsplooshers,1 point,Wed Jun 10 22:46:31 2015 UTC,"Ok, your frustration with their play in addition to the league/rink makes a lot more sense now.    I agree though, it's shitty of a league to not enforce skill levels for the sake of making money. Hopefully teams make more of a stir by quitting, since it sounds like money will be the only motivating factor for them to change."

hockeyplayers,3994wf,stevetehpirate,1 point,Thu Jun 11 16:55:23 2015 UTC,"The rink I play at is the only one for 50+ miles, it's small, and heavily mixed use (figure skating, shows, public skate, and all levels of hockey).   So with league and pickup play there pretty regular disparity. High level players can only make low level days, broad definitions for league brackets, etc. What I see happening is better players and teams will play down to the average. I was told that one team is recruiting newcomers to water down their talent as they couldn't make the next level's game schedule.  They want find ways to balance the game. I'm not sure if the league would step in if they didn't, but the point is that the players care. A big reason I love hockey is because of that atmosphere of sportsmanship. Especially with club hockey, the fun must be always."
hockeyplayers,3994wf,Firsmith,1 point,Thu Jun 11 19:19:56 2015 UTC,"I don't mind losing games (in context of the discussion), but when it's so lopsided we can't get it out of our zone, have no scoring changes, can't move the puck etc, that's when it's no fun. Losing 7-2 can be ok if we're getting changes and puck possession is reasonably shared. I know the pain brother, we dropped out of one league because of this and moved somewhere else. A good league manager knows this hurts his long term business and will work to address. You're in a shitty league - but not sure if your city has more options - there's about 12 leagues within a 45min drive where I am"

hockeyplayers,39666v,Alley_runner101,13,Tue Jun 9 15:18:12 2015 UTC,"This isnt about having my stick on the ice to receive a pass or when to poke check or whatever, i literally mean when im skating, what should my stick be doing?   My first thought is safety.  I keep my stick low with the toe pointed down.  Beginners usually forget they have a stick in their hands and tend to raise it high and clip faces.  Try not to do this and ppl will like you more."
hockeyplayers,39666v,eigenman,5,Tue Jun 9 15:49:53 2015 UTC,This should be higher up in the thread. Keep the blade down.   I try to keep both hands on the stick and the stick on the ice unless I'm skating backwards playing defense or sprinting.  It's hard to force myself to do it but I find that I get a lot more bounces coming my way and break up passes more often just because the stick is on the ice.
hockeyplayers,39666v,greenlion22,1 point,Tue Jun 9 17:32:44 2015 UTC,"Yes, good point, ill definetely keep that in mind."
hockeyplayers,39666v,spartanKid,8,Wed Jun 10 05:59:41 2015 UTC,"Pointing your stick towards where you want to go. You don't have to fully point your stick towards the inside of the turn you're making, but on your backhand crossovers, don't let your stick just hang out to the side."
hockeyplayers,39666v,xzzy,3,Tue Jun 9 15:42:22 2015 UTC,"There's a tactical element to this advice: it protects the puck. If you imagine that you're being pursued by an opponent, putting the stick in front of your intended path it means the defender has to go through you to get to the puck. If you drag the puck behind you all they have to do is swat their stick and you're not the puck carrier anymore.  So yes when turning towards your backhand this does make things a little more awkward, you have to get your hands away from your body and roll those wrists. Just like everything else on the ice you have to force yourself to practice it until it gets comfortable."
hockeyplayers,39666v,kingofthediamond,3,Tue Jun 9 20:18:35 2015 UTC,"When I was taking power skate lessons my coach taught me a cool trick with crossovers. If you are using the circles you should actually stare towards the middle of the circle with your stick in between the dot and the circle. This helps you keep your head up and actually puts your stick in the perfect position to receive a pass while crossing over.   Im always getting yelled at for not having my stick on the ice but I generally like to keep my stick hovering over the ice about 2 inches while I skate. This may be the wrong way to do it though.   Keep 2 hands on the stick at all times except when you are trying to get a burst of speed, reaching for a pass, blocking the lane or poke checking."

hockeyplayers,39666v,thegamerdug,2,Tue Jun 9 16:13:56 2015 UTC,"Best advice is just to keep your stick where you can receive a pass or interfere with an opponent. Crossing over on your backhand, probably just keep the stick straight ahead of you, that way you can react to any situation."
hockeyplayers,39666v,rfinger1337,2,Tue Jun 9 15:20:29 2015 UTC,"first: on the ice.  Always. You will be shocked at how many times the puck just lands on your stick if you let it.  second: as a D, the stick should be in the passing lanes. If you can touch the puck at all, it will prevent the 1-timer and make your goalie a hero.  third: close enough to the guy you are covering to make him feel pressure. If you just back up, he will never feel pressure and patently wait for a good pass or shot and it's in the net.  Make him change his plan.  Summary: take away the pass, take away their time and space, keep the stick down and your head up.  Good luck!"
hockeyplayers,39666v,lernington,1 point,Thu Jun 11 16:58:47 2015 UTC,"Honestly, while you're learning to play, I'd just get in the habit of keeping both hands on your stick at all times.  As you become a better skater, your body will give you more cues as to how it wants to hold the stick for different maneuvers.  Be mindful not to let your blade come up high though, that shit can be dangerous.  I almost lost an eye because a bender at a shinny game was holding his stick too high and I skated into it.  I definitely am partially responsible, because I wasn't wearing any eye protection (since that incident, I always wear a visor), but there was no reason for him to have his stick where he did."
hockeyplayers,39666v,brian2686,1 point,Wed Jun 10 03:01:36 2015 UTC,"Just as a general rule of thumb, always have two hands on your stick and keep it down on the ice. It's a hockey 101 thing, so obviously there are exceptions, but it's the standard position. You never know when you are gonna find a loose puck, breakup a pass or have a sneaky pass sent your way. Also safety and penalties. Don't wanna be high sticking guys and taking accidental tripping penalties.  As a defender playing defense (skating backwards with puckhandler coming at you) try to hide your poke check. Essentially, keep the stick closer to your body. Don't have your arm fully extended and waving it around, it's too easy to gauge the distance. Picture yourself with only your top hand on the stick and that hand against your hip. The idea is to disguise the length of your reach so you can catch the guy off guard. Otherwise, two hands on stick for those strong stick-lifts and checks.   On offense, when looking to receive a pass, try to ""present"" your stick blade to your teammate. And I mean the face of the blade. Do you want to catch the puck on your backhand or forehand? Then put your stick there. It will help you naturally have the positioning and posture to catch it and do what you want. It also helps the passer lead you properly. Sometimes I will very deliberately and exaggeratedly present my stick where I want the puck. The idea is to try to have the blade be perpendicular to the passer. Doesn't matter if you are skating backwards, forwards, away from passer, towards him, etc, place your blade where you want to receive the pass.   The rest of the stuff was good advice too. Point the blade in the general direction you're skating. Practice crossovers around the faceoff circle with your stick always on the middle dot. Practice ""cupping"" the puck on the backhand or forehand.  Watch the NHL. You'll be danglin and tossin sauce in no time."
hockeyplayers,39666v,aiden_sullivan,1 point,Wed Jun 10 03:12:24 2015 UTC,always keep your off hand on the very ass end of your stick lest you want to be called for a jab or end poke.
hockeyplayers,39666v,somewhat_random,1 point,Wed Jun 10 03:24:35 2015 UTC,"My pet peeve is the ""rule"" of 2 hands on the stick. So many people say this to beginners and there is a lot of time when you should use your reach with one hand on the knob.  You need 2 hands on the stick to shoot or receive a pass.   sprinting (without the puck) is faster with one hand on the stick. on a breakaway, when you are trying to get down the ice as fast as possible and before you are ready to shoot - one hand on the stick. defending can be either depending on whether it is a stick battle - poke check etc. if you have the puck and a check on you, a good option is to keep one hand on the stick to keep the puck outside and use your lower hand/arm to protect you from the defender's stick.   So keep two hands on the stick at least some of the time but not always.  BUT KEEP YOUR STICK DOWN ALL THE TIME"
hockeyplayers,39666v,Fragninja,1 point,Wed Jun 10 07:40:36 2015 UTC,"'Two hands on the stick, stick on the ice' is almost always the right thing to do. If you are skating fast down the ice, and you need to pump your arms, sure, take a hand off. But whenever you want to be involved in play, you should have both hands on.   Also, receiving passes is a bit easier if you have your stick held out parallel to your shoulders, with your arms a bit straighter and your bottom hand a bit more open than if you hold it in 'hockey stance'."
hockeyplayers,39666v,Tylemaker,0,Wed Jun 10 20:36:10 2015 UTC,"For when you don't have the puck, 2 hands on your stick when receiving a pass and when your battling someone or trying to steal the puck. But if you feel comfortable, 1 hand is often better for defending/pokechecking/sprinting."

My first one last me just under a year for playing 2-3x per week. The toe of the blade started to chip and I still use it as a reliable backup/drop in stick from time to time, just not games. If you can find one for a reasonable price then pull the trigger. It's a low kickpoint stick, which makes my wristers and snappers fly with ease. The weight and the balance of this stick is perfect.

If it looks good play with it for now but make sure you have a backup. Worst comes to worst you can always saw off and replace the blade, but keep in mind the flex point will change and the core they use to hold the blade is usually heavier than a normal stick body.

Get a mix of regular black ones and the heavier orange ones. I also have some stickhandling balls I use, one that's normal and one that's heavier. I like using heavier balls and pucks because when I'm out on the ice with a real puck it feels way lighter."
hockeyplayers,396sk0,boogiemen,1 point,Tue Jun 9 21:34:51 2015 UTC,I like the orange pucks. Especially if you have the tile to slide it around on as OP does. Makes regular pucks feel much lighter and easier to handle after using that thing for a while.
hockeyplayers,396sk0,jonoc4,1 point,Wed Jun 10 13:41:04 2015 UTC,Thanks for all the input everyone! I'm excited to give these tiles a try!
hockeyplayers,396sk0,jonoc4,1 point,Wed Jun 10 10:26:11 2015 UTC,"I see people saying Green Biscuit, but if you are going to get a green biscuit get the Snipe version because it is closer to the real weight of a puck than the original, but still not as heavy. What I use is a Smart Hockey Training Ball It is about training your muscle memory. it feels very similar to a puck when stick handling, because it has the same weight and touches your blade at the same height as a puck, etc."
hockeyplayers,397dpa,SuperStealthOTL,5,Tue Jun 9 20:03:30 2015 UTC,"The Bauer x800 is only 129 bucks and is almost the same as the apx2. Great low kick point for fast snaps and wristers. If you can afford a little bump up, the x900 from Bauer or the QR Pro from Warrior are both 199. They come in all kinds of blade patterns and flexes."

I made the switch for about a season until my composite snapped, and in my first game back to wood, I scored 4 goals.  If you really want to make the switch, I've found that Sher-Woods tend to feel the most like a woody (go figure)."
hockeyplayers,397dpa,buckemall,3,Wed Jun 10 03:09:51 2015 UTC,"I know an older guy, that's a great player and he swears by his Sher-Woods.  I used to love the old Montreal sticks."

hockeyplayers,397dpa,lernington,2,Wed Jun 10 19:19:57 2015 UTC,Hah that's actually the exact stick that I play with just with the stastny curve.  I'll take it over an mx3 any day of the week.

hockeyplayers,397dpa,lernington,1 point,Thu Jun 11 12:24:33 2015 UTC,"yeah, the snappers are probably the one area of my game that I think would improve if I switched to composite, but as a defenseman, I almost never take those anyways.  I can shoot clappers harder with a composite, but I have more control over them with wood.  Ultimately though, it just comes down to puck feel, and in that regard, every composite that I've tried just feels insufferably weird."
hockeyplayers,397dpa,kingofthediamond,2,Fri Jun 12 02:17:45 2015 UTC,"My favourite stick ever is a plain old Sher-Wood fibreglass laminated unpainted wood stick. Those fibreglass slivers were absolutely awful, but that stick was solid."
hockeyplayers,397dpa,kingofthediamond,2,Wed Jun 10 12:48:50 2015 UTC,"What kind of shots do you like to take? Do you lean into shots?   Coming from wood to a composite is a huge difference. You may actually want to start on the lower end of the composites otherwise weight may have a factor. Even though you are not a beginner, high end composites are 200+ grams less than wood and you will really feel it.  However, composites give you a much more consistant feel with shooting and stick handling over wood.   I recommend going with a stick around 500 grams, or a low to mid level stick until you are comfortable with the feel of a composite then you can drop big money on one that you will really like."
hockeyplayers,397dpa,kingofthediamond,1 point,Tue Jun 9 20:27:54 2015 UTC,"I usually take wristers in pickup when playing forward. Possibly some slappers if they're allowed and I'm on the point.  I pull the shot back and lean on the stick for flex and snap my wrists as it comes ahead of my body. I've had some issue leaning with my wooden stick because it's cut too short, but if I get a composite that's the right length I'll have no problem getting some flex into my shot.  I definitely am not going to drop $200+ on my first one. But I've been relying on sub-$40 wooden sticks, and they aren't doing it for me."
hockeyplayers,397dpa,Zemiakovy,2,Tue Jun 9 21:10:33 2015 UTC,fair enough. So you really lean into shots or you like to? I think you may prefer a mid kick stick. If you get the right flex and stick it will do wonders for you
hockeyplayers,397dpa,Zemiakovy,1 point,Wed Jun 10 02:00:10 2015 UTC,"I like to, but I have been having trouble getting a satisfactory shot off. It's mostly just wrist and upper body strength, but I know I can work the flex into it. I suspect it's the length of my stick combined with all the time I was away from playing.  I'm not really knowledgeable in flex patterns, but mid-kick looks like it would be a good fit. My shot isn't particularly quick, but I have enough weight/power to lean into the shaft and get some power. I'll test some out."
hockeyplayers,397dpa,EASHL,2,Wed Jun 10 12:45:25 2015 UTC,I think it could also be the stick. Composite sticks are far better at transferring your power into the shot. For ease of shots low kick is the way to go however if you are the type of person to more of your weight into it you will feel much more comfortable with a mid kick.   Just something to consider.  I can help you out with learning about flex patterns. check out my website
hockeyplayers,397dpa,kingofthediamond,2,Wed Jun 10 13:44:05 2015 UTC,Try BASE's supernatural. Composite but with a wooden feel.
hockeyplayers,397dpa,EASHL,2,Tue Jun 9 20:30:47 2015 UTC,It might be nice to ease into the lack of weight. My biggest issue was that the lack of heft makes it feel wrong. I'm sure it won't take me long to get used to it.

The composite sticks are just so much nicer, if you buy a decent stick.  I have a couple Warrior Covert DT2s that are great, and a CCM RBZ 60, that's a piece of shit.  The Warriors are higher level models for the brand, and have great puck feel (like a good wood stick.)  The CCM has no puck feel, and feels like your playing with a fake stick.  The higher level models of all the brands are going to be really decent sticks. You can always save money by buying closeout sticks of high quality."
hockeyplayers,397dpa,thetylertheking,2,Wed Jun 10 02:27:21 2015 UTC,", and a CCM RBZ 60, that's a piece of shit.   Well it's a low-end stick so yeah. You make CCM sound bad with that. Otherwise a good comment."

hockeyplayers,394vlf,WhiskyTango3,3,Tue Jun 9 17:22:19 2015 UTC,"I broke my elbow a few years back and now have a limited range of motion in it. I broke my right elbow, and I shoot left so luckily it doesn't effect shooting too much, but sometimes I have trouble reaching for pucks, stick checking. Be sure you do all the physical therapy and don't be lazy about any exercises they tell you to do at home for it. I was very lazy about it and I'm sure it had an effect on my range of motion. I'm assuming you're getting surgery on your elbow? If you do, even after your doctor gives you a clean bill of health, your elbow is going to feel kind of weak and painful. You might have a bit of muscle atrophy from not using one arm so much during healing too. It takes awhile, but you can still play after an injury like this!"

hockeyplayers,394sl9,BrunooSardine,2,Tue Jun 9 06:52:27 2015 UTC,"You more than likely get circles skated around you, but that does not mean you should not go out and give it a shot.  Every open hockey, or rat is made up of all skill levels.  I have found that if it does not have a beginner label on it the skill level tends to be around C level with some B & D guys mixed in.  The true beginners are usually too apprehensive to go and High level A guys don't want to play with guys too far below them.  Obviously this is just what I have experienced.  As long as you can skate decently and stop then going to open hockey is fine.  I have been playing for 5 years in Chicagoland and consider myself a low C player, and that is playing 2 times a week for about 5 years, year round.  When I show up to rat I can hold my own, but I'm usually still on the lower end of the skill spectrum.   My personal recommendation is try to find an Adult Beginner Clinic.  They are all over the place in Chicago and the surrounding burbs.  Not sure where you are from but they seem to be popping up all over the country.  This will help you build a base while playing with people around the same skill level.   Hit up a second hand shop to get the basics.  I ordered all my initial stuff online when I started but I was just lucky that most of it fit.  You really need to try things on to see if they fit.  There are usually guidelines online for fit, but all the manufacturers vary in size and many of them have different fits depending on the line you chose under their brand.  Skates must be purchased in store after trying on.  There is no way to do this online. Don't cheap out on skates.  Get a good mid-level skate in the 200-300 dollar range.  This will provide decent protection, stability, and durability.  These should last you the first couple of years and then when you are a better skater you can upgrade to something a little stiffer if you decide to stick with the game.  If you go real cheap the boot is often very soft and they wont last very long.   Also don't skimp on the helmet and don't buy a used one.  Get that brand new.  A good mid range model should be fine.  A get a cage.  Beginners sticks, more than anyone else's, seem to come up at your face at an alarming rate.  Good luck and have fun!  This is by far and away the best team sport you will ever play.  And you will become addicted."

I'm guessing it might have had more to do with stick length, flex, lie, curve, and the fact the Koho probably was on its last leg(even it had just been sitting around for years) . I'm not saying the composite didn't help your shot. I'm just saying your theory on wood sticks vs composites isn't really that accurate.  Get your hands on a closeout mid to high end composite and you will be really impresssed. Always remember- its not the wand, it's the magician."

hockeyplayers,3984vi,stevegcook,2,Wed Jun 10 00:22:53 2015 UTC,"While I agree to an extent, I will still say a beginner should go for a decent wood stick over cheap composite based solely on the puck feel you get with wood. New players need to learn the feel of a puck, how to handle it, how to control it, as well as the feel of properly giving and receiving passes.  Those things are what you will be doing with the puck 95% of the time, and essential building blocks to becoming a better player. You get zero puck feel on a 60.00 composite. You can still learn proper shot mechanics with a woody as well.  In the end, it's best just to splurge the 90-100.00 on a decent closeout stick."

The way sticks are ""supposed to"" flex, if anything, is the way it was done for 110+ years beforehand with lumber.  Complaining about not getting shot power because it's too hard to learn how is like lowering a basketball net 3 feet and saying that's the way it's ""supposed"" to be played because it's easier to score."

I used a woodie for many years because people were constantly telling me that you have to learn on a wooden stick before you'll see any benefit from a composite stick. My shot was always super shitty despite practicing the hell out of it. So one day I went and bought a lower end Bauer composite stick on a whim and took it to the outdoor rink. First wrister was a laser right up into the corner, harder than any shot I'd done with a wooden stick. I was converted, and felt kinda silly for dicking around all those years unable to shoot well with a variety of different wooden sticks.

hockeyplayers,392ugc,1966mopar,1 point,Mon Jun 8 21:16:44 2015 UTC,I'm sorry to hear that man I've been dealing with back pain for about 4 years caused by CrossFit. also bulging disc for me. I'm not a doctor but I've been through a lot of treatments and the two treatments that have helped me the most have been decompression therapy and lumbar injections every 6 months or so. I just started playing hockey about 2 months ago and it seems to make my back better loosen things up a bit. If you want to do spinal decompression at home check out a device called the nubax.  I use it once a day before bedtime so that I get a full 8 to 10 hours of decompressed spine while I sleep.  If you truly have a bulging disc its most likely caused by compression of the vertebrae.  so the most effective way to treat it for me has been to just reverse the compression and give that nerve a rest from the disc pressing on it. for me none of the other stuff worked. I hope this is helpful.
hockeyplayers,392ugc,ezeeetm,1 point,Mon Jun 8 23:31:53 2015 UTC,"I just started using an inversion table. I will look into that nubax also. I'm only doing a few minutes twice a day to start, last time I used one I went right upside down for to long and made things worse."
hockeyplayers,392ugc,ezeeetm,1 point,Tue Jun 9 00:04:05 2015 UTC,"I tried inversion and got nothing.  The nubax actually pulls your vertebrae apart using leverage...way more ""pull"" than just hanging.  When it pops the first time your eyes will roll back in your skull and you'll praise whatever god you believe in.  Its like magic, instant relief.  YMMV, but one point about the nubax for me is to not overuse it.  The constant expand / contract seems to sort of bruise and irritate the affected disc.  Use it once before bed, good long stretch/pop session, and hop directly into bed afterwards to sleep with the disc decompressed.    But everybody's injury is a little different.  You may be able to use it several times a day with no issues.    Regardless, serious decompression (not the weak clinical ones or even hanging) is the only thing that keeps me from surgery.  Couldn't live without it.  I even travel with it"

hockeyplayers,392ugc,lernington,1 point,Tue Jun 9 01:36:51 2015 UTC,"So I herniated a disc about 2 years ago, and had to have surgery for it.  I still do my pt regimen on a daily basis, and have changed just about every facet of my day to day rituals, posturing, and movements.  Be wary of yoga.  Forward bending puts a lot of strain on your discs, and could very possibly make it worse.  I'd recommend seeing a physical therapist.  I maintain that that did as much to help me as the surgery (before the surgery, my left leg was virtually useless).  I'm a big believer in core stability exercises.  The objective is to make good posture easy for yourself, so that the discs are encouraged to sit in their proper positions.  Be careful of how you bend, stand, etc..  Constant midfulness.  Also, eating well will go further than you think.  Also, your doctor probably should have prescribed you a round of prednisone.  If they didn't, find out why.  If you want to go into much more detail, pm me."
hockeyplayers,392ugc,pandorasrose,1 point,Tue Jun 9 01:45:06 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the help guys, I really appreciate it. I didn't think yoga would hurt but yoga poses where you have to bend forward would make sense not to do, your natural arch is back not forward. I'll remember that. I do the back arches twice a day and other stretches. I don't really want medication yet, that's last resort. I hoping to get back to normal soon then go to physio. I think thats my best route."

Getting a strong core is the best thing you can do - I wish I had access to all those cool pilates machines & stuff at the physical therapy clinic again (and the time and initiative to go use them!), but when your core is strong and supportive, it will take the load off your back.

All 3 times were caused by mundane things like taking a shot just a little awkwardly in warmups, one time just skating through center ice hard and caught a rut and went off balance a little bit, can't remember what caused the other time.  2 of them caused me to miss hockey for 2 or 3 weeks, one of them caused me to miss a week.  The first one I couldn't even go to class, tried to walk across campus and couldn't do it, had to stop every 50 feet or so and rest.  had to sleep in the oddest positions to get even remotely comfortable, etc.  It was pretty bad.  Sounds like what you're describing (lower back pain just to the side of my spine).    Lots of aleve and a few muscle relaxers when I could find them.  Not fun."
hockeyplayers,392ugc,von_neumann,1 point,Tue Jun 9 03:36:56 2015 UTC,"I fractured my back (L5 vertebrae) in 7th grade AND had several very serious bulging disks where my vertebrae were basically rubbing against each other.  It took years to finally start feeling better because I would try to play sports and it would just get worse and worse. Honestly, it made me really bitter about life, seeing all my friends play games like football without me and knowing that I couldn't wakeboard or tube because it would result in debilitating pain and leave me nearly unable to move. Finally as a freshman in college, I've only felt serious back pain once over the last year and honestly I think it's mostly from hockey. I noticed that the first few times I played hockey, my back would be real stiff the day after and occasionally it would really hurt. As I started to play more consistently and worked on my form, I noticed my back and core getting stronger and stronger. Now I'm playing 3 times a week and my back hasn't felt this good in years.   On a side note, bulging disks did feel a lot like a pulled muscle in my lower back, like you said.   Ninja edit; if you learn one thing from my story, PLEASE DONT PUSH IT. LET IT HEAL AND DO NOT PLAY SPORTS UNTIL YOURE COMPLETELY SURE YOURE READY. it's not worth creating a lifelong issue just to play in one game or season. I learned that the hard way"

hockeyplayers,392s4j,honestbleeps,3,Mon Jun 8 21:00:43 2015 UTC,Honestly your probably better off staying as is. A lot of people are left handed and shoot right and right handed and shoot left. This way your dominant hand is  your top hand (left) making it easier to control the stick. I'm also a lefty but shoot lefty just because that's how I learned as a kid. I can shoot righty as well but skating with a right handed stick throws my balance way off.  To add to this have your strong hand on bottom helps with getting harder shots.
hockeyplayers,392s4j,Knobdy1,1 point,Tue Jun 9 00:57:59 2015 UTC,"appreciate the reply, thanks!"
hockeyplayers,392s4j,Knobdy1,1 point,Tue Jun 9 05:46:57 2015 UTC,"No problem.  Just to be clear, you're shooting righty now? as in your Left hand is on top and your bottom hand is your right?"
hockeyplayers,392s4j,Knobdy1,1 point,Tue Jun 9 17:49:02 2015 UTC,"yep. I shoot righty, so my left hand is on top, yes.  my right hand is stronger, despite the fact that I'm ""left handed"" (I write left handed), which is why I'm considering the switch."
hockeyplayers,392s4j,teachzim,1 point,Tue Jun 9 19:27:28 2015 UTC,"Think about it this way, controlling the puck doesn't take strength necessarily, it takes fine motor skills. I'd stay with the left hand on top as that it is your writing hand. Having your stronger arm on bottom will help generate torque and your shots will be harder."
hockeyplayers,392s4j,von_neumann,1 point,Tue Jun 9 20:10:41 2015 UTC,"yeah, that's a good point, maybe I should stick to sucking right handed instead of trying to suck left handed :-p"
hockeyplayers,392s4j,namegoeswhere,2,Tue Jun 9 20:30:41 2015 UTC,I did too... worked for me. RT hand dominate switched to lefty shot. Makes stick handling and poke checks much better. still working on weight transfer. If you're more ambidextrous shouldn't be a problem. Borrow a lefty stick and give it a chance during a S&P. Worth a shot.
hockeyplayers,391cz2,ezeeetm,3,Mon Jun 8 15:17:10 2015 UTC,"Go to open skates/public skates and just work on the whole progression of stopping to your weak side. Try to spend an hour or so where you only snowplow/hockey stop to your weak side.   Also try getting comfortable sliding on your weak side skate, i.e. facing the boards with your feet perpendicular to the boards, push off with your strong skate and and slide in the direction perpendicular to your edges on your weak side foot. Your edges shouldn't be biting but you should be sliding/scraping while balancing on the flat of your weak side skate. This is a good (but challenging) drill to work on being comfortable putting most or all of your weight on your weak leg, which is a key component to stopping on your weak side."
hockeyplayers,391cz2,spartanKid,1 point,Mon Jun 8 15:59:03 2015 UTC,I'm having the same problem and will do this in my pregame warmup tonight.  Thanks!
hockeyplayers,391cz2,el_karacho,1 point,Mon Jun 8 16:09:58 2015 UTC,"I'm a newer skater than you, so I have no input, but I have the exact same issue.  Left foot (stronger) feels like it's sliding out from under me, and when I skate on one foot on the left, I can skid/shave at will.  Right foot, always has an edge.  Shaving (even in a plow to stop) is nearly impossible.  It does shave when I'm gliding straight a bit on the back inside though.  That might be an indicator for me.  Newly sharpened, dull, 1/2"" radius, 5/8"" radius. Same thing."
hockeyplayers,391cz2,goofygrin,1 point,Mon Jun 8 15:56:18 2015 UTC,"Newly sharpened, dull, 1/2"" radius, 5/8"" radius. Same thing.   So (watching pro players) I think this might just be how it is when your lower leg muscles get strong enough.  As it becomes easier to shave, it also becomes harder not to shave, and we have to find a balance?  I dunno...but i think this for the same reason you might.  It doesn't matter how fresh my sharpen job is, the moment I step on the ice, my strong foot is always just a nudge away from shaving (even in a fwd stride!)"
hockeyplayers,391cz2,Vargatron,2,Mon Jun 8 16:10:46 2015 UTC,"I think one of the keys for me was learning the correct positioning of my weight in relation to the skate blades. If I focused my weight toward the toe of my blade, I could cause the skate to shave ice when needed. Conversely if I focus the weight more toward my heel, I dig in the ice and can do turns and generate power.  I think you have to learn how to control the weigh distribution on your skates to know where your ""breakpoint"" lies where you start shaving the ice.  I'm still practicing my right side stops, but it's getting consistently better the more I practice and focus on my weight distribution.  Edit:  Also, another thing to muse on is the angle of your skate blades in relation to the ice. A more acute angle will make you dig in more and possibly cause you to turn. A perpendicular angle will cause you to slide and possibly lose balance. Try and find the sweet spot where you can slide, but dig in enough to stop."
hockeyplayers,391cz2,Vargatron,1 point,Mon Jun 8 17:31:12 2015 UTC,"A more acute angle will make you dig in more and possibly cause you to turn.   Ah, this may be part of my problem.  I assumed that more acute up to a point would be easier to turn, but then past that point was shaving (as well as perpendicular, like you do when you are shaving on the boards)     so like:  0-15 degrees = shaving zone  15 - 40 degrees = turning/bite  40+ degrees = shaving zone again     You are saying this is not the case, right?  I'll work on this and weight distribution.  Thanks!"
hockeyplayers,391cz2,goofygrin,1 point,Mon Jun 8 21:55:40 2015 UTC,"Basically the more vertical your skate is, the more you have a tendency to slide on the ice. At least that's how it's been for me. If you lean too far into a turn, you'll lose your edge again and slide.  Think about the amount of ice that is in your blade hollow while skating. There will be a point in which you have maximum cut into the ice. Above or below that point, you'll lose bite. So there's kind a sweet spot to hit.  I may be overthinking stuff a bit, but I had to visualize this stuff to get it to click while I was skating."
hockeyplayers,391cz2,tmw82,1 point,Tue Jun 9 01:21:31 2015 UTC,"I think what /u/Vargatron is saying is likely more the case (although my calves are very strong).  The more I skate, the more I can feel where I am on the length of the blade (front/mid/rear), especially with my strong foot. My weak foot I don't have that sense yet.  When I first started skating, I remember watching a video on turning, and they talked about your weight being on the back side of the skate.  That sounded so unintuitive I wrote it off. About 90 minutes into a 2 hour skating session saturday, I was just doing figure 8's to work on crossovers (face off circle radius, had the ice to myself) and it finally ""clicked.""  Of course yesterday when I went out it had unclicked, but I felt it that one time and it's addicting.  (also my feet stop hurting when I stop thinking about them... weird, I know)."
hockeyplayers,391cz2,glid3r,1 point,Mon Jun 8 18:43:06 2015 UTC,"i think what might help (for me) is to start over again, but just use the weak foot this time.  My breakthrough was when I could snowplow, then it was only 1-2 sessions before I was transitioning from snowplow to full stop on strong foot.  I think I just need to go back to snowplow, but transition out of it on the weak foot instead of the strong foot, just like I did the first time."
hockeyplayers,391cz2,7sage7,1 point,Mon Jun 8 21:59:03 2015 UTC,"It really just takes time and practice, which will lead to confidence.  I remember when I first started not being able to stop on either side.  Then I got good on my one side and struggled with the other.  This is a very common issue with new skaters.  After a while of practicing and playing I could stop on both sides.  Once you get the feeling down and are confident enough to stop on that side regularly you wont even think about stopping. It will just happen.  I know that seems impossible at this point but it will happen."
hockeyplayers,391cz2,ballerstatus89,1 point,Mon Jun 8 17:19:45 2015 UTC,"Can you do fwd/back transitions both directions, or only to the strong side?"
hockeyplayers,391cz2,goofygrin,1 point,Mon Jun 8 19:45:05 2015 UTC,"i can do them easily and consistently on strong side, and awkwardly on weak side, with about 80% success rate.  And by success (on the weak side) I mean ""any outcome other than ending up on my ass"".  I've yet to get one to be anywhere near as solid as my strong side, not even close.  strong side I can do them at will."
hockeyplayers,392wre,1966mopar,5,Mon Jun 8 21:32:28 2015 UTC,I had some issues. Biggest thing I did to help it was lose some weight... Bout 45lbs. I also found a fantastic chiropractor
hockeyplayers,392wre,sb22284,3,Mon Jun 8 23:35:31 2015 UTC,"Shedding weight is tough but it helps so much with everything, not just sports."

hockeyplayers,392wre,Ditchingworkagain2,1 point,Thu Jun 18 02:09:55 2015 UTC,"Try stretching out your hamstrings, glutes and hips. A lot of back pain, particularly where you are describing, stems from the bottom up! Stretch out your hamstrings then attack your glutes and hips with basic stretches.  I'm a heavier guy with poor posture - that I'm working on - that is experiencing an ache in my lower left back. Stretching it out and a lacrosse ball is working wonders!"
hockeyplayers,392wre,1979_Honda_Accord,0,Wed Jun 10 05:46:24 2015 UTC,the only two treatments I know that work are muscle relaxers or spinal fusion. watched my mom go through it all.
hockeyplayers,391xbr,trk1985,1 point,Mon Jun 8 17:35:50 2015 UTC,"I don't rate wall sits. There's no balance aspect to them. If you want glutes and hams worked any squat with weight to the rear or conscious effort to put the weight thru your heels is the way to go, IMO. One leg squats are my fave."
hockeyplayers,391xbr,BrummieRed,1 point,Mon Jun 8 19:15:35 2015 UTC,"Ok, thanks for the input. I do appreciate it.  Given the fact that the article is written by an ex-NHLer and he said that ""training this way improved my speed and stability on the ice,"" I'd still like to get answers to that initial question.  Do you have any input in general on how to activate your hamstrings/glutes more instead of quads?"
hockeyplayers,391xbr,tomg27,1 point,Mon Jun 8 21:00:09 2015 UTC,"cook hip lift:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WvRjYbhWnc  sh. elevated bb hip lift:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOnbakeElAQ  sb hamstring curl:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3fXZLb-jgI  (this one is often done incorrectly, make sure the hip never bends during the movement, as the young lady does in the video)  hope this helps."
hockeyplayers,391xbr,BrummieRed,1 point,Mon Jun 8 23:23:56 2015 UTC,"I think there's two aspects to it 1) activating and using squats - glute bridges/glute bridges with one leg raised to activate the glutes/hams, and then simply making sure you're more aware of them and consciously using them when you walk, run, skate etc 2) strengthening those muscles by doing squats (any weight to the rear and pushing thru the heels)."
hockeyplayers,391xbr,londonpa,1 point,Tue Jun 9 08:29:39 2015 UTC,I'd imagine at the recreation level technique is everything.  If you want to improve your speed working on your skating is the way to go IMO.   If you like lifting then I guess any squats and dead lifts would be good cross over to hockey.
hockeyplayers,391d2y,NitroDevo,3,Mon Jun 8 15:17:50 2015 UTC,"You don't always have to be right up with the rush. Sometimes being behind your linemates can set you up with a nice rebound or a 2nd or 3rd chance. Also make sure to play your strengths! If you are not fast, play smart. Make sure you are always in a good position.   For me, Im not the best stick handler but I am a sniper, great deflector and play tough in front of the net. I dont always follow the initial rush but I wait for passes or get in front if we start to cycle."
hockeyplayers,391d2y,kingofthediamond,2,Mon Jun 8 15:49:34 2015 UTC,But remember this changes you to F3 or the more defensive forward (usually) so if there's a quick turnover you're the hustle back guy to prevent a 3 on 2. :)
hockeyplayers,391d2y,lostincbus,2,Mon Jun 8 16:20:44 2015 UTC,One thing for you to consider if you are a slower guy is to put yourself into positions to enable your teammates to use you for things like give and goes and high support coming late into the zone. Your teammates will expect you to pull your weight but you don't always have to be as fast as them. Just try your best to play smart and be in a position to help breakouts and enable quick passes.
hockeyplayers,391d2y,Zednix,2,Tue Jun 9 01:19:38 2015 UTC,On my line we myself and the other guy who are really fast and the 3rd guy is a pretty big drop off in skill and speed wise. Yet despite this he is generally last one into the offensive zone and just crashes the net and guess what he has more goals then either of us do.
hockeyplayers,391d2y,whatthefrickenfrack,1 point,Tue Jun 9 02:46:15 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the feedback guys!  I talked with my captains last night after the game, they said I'm doing the right things and going to the proper areas and that some of the guys could learn from me.

I saw myself on video and realized just how bad my form was. After seeing that and spending a game or two working on fixing some of the stupid things I was doing I probably ended up being 15% faster and a lot more nimble. I'm not even joking. Almost overnight my skating improved so much, just from knowing."
hockeyplayers,38xms5,Gibson19,2,Mon Jun 8 01:43:12 2015 UTC,"Such great tips - both getting lower AND the suggestion to video yourself.  All aspects of your game can benefit from watching yourself back on video for bad form, habits, or general improvements.  Congrats on your turnaround!"

hockeyplayers,38xms5,lostincbus,1 point,Tue Jun 9 01:22:10 2015 UTC,Keeping both hands on the stick and your stick on the ground will reinforce this behavior.  Also at warm ups I'll squat very low a few times which helps me get comfortable with holding a lower center of gravity.
hockeyplayers,38xms5,Eddie-Spaghetti,1 point,Sun Jun 7 21:28:24 2015 UTC,"Same thing happened to me, I shortened my stick (almost a foot now!) and started using a lower lie and the change has been dramatic"

hockeyplayers,38xms5,IBleedTeal,2,Wed Jun 10 03:10:06 2015 UTC,How should I tie my skates?  I can do this.
hockeyplayers,38xms5,ezeeetm,1 point,Thu Jun 11 02:19:26 2015 UTC,"I would read this just as a personal story and not really as advice because I'm still figuring out the best way for me:  I'm not sure what works best for different people at different stages of learning, but my issue was that I started wrapping my laces around the back. That worked really well for my first season, but I think it was just a crutch that made me feel more secure, which then led to me skating harder. When I stopped doing that, I noticed an increase in maneuverability and speed now that I was stronger and more confident. But that might just be for me since I know some crazy strong skaters who wrap.   The other thing was that I tied my laces too tight bottom to top. That just helped me with sore/cramping feet though."

I went straight to the assist man on my (and teams) first goal, and said, GREAT Pass! The second got a tiny fist pump with a ""What is Happening??!"" & shoulder shrug to the bench.

hockeyplayers,38zd2y,Letsplayhawkey,2,Mon Jun 8 02:57:45 2015 UTC,"For starters: you need to find out if your college ""club"" is really a hockey club where guys just play for fun, or if it is an ACHA club team. If it's ACHA its going to be way over your head, as those teams mostly consist of guys who've been playing competitive their whole lives.  As for gear cost, when I started as an adult my total cost was 700-800. That's for new, midrange gear. If you get some used stuff or cheapos of course it will be less. My advice: spend the most on skates helmet and gloves."

hockeyplayers,38xcsk,tman1510,12,Sun Jun 7 17:56:35 2015 UTC,You also don't see pros with the three point visors used in major junior leagues. There's a sense of graduating; taking the training wheels off and wearing what you want when you've earned the right to play at the highest strata. It's cultural.  I'm not saying I think that attitude is justified but I'm just a dude on the internet who skates once a month so what do I know. I imagine the edge of a puck can easily tear an ear in half so personally I keep them in.

The quality on every model is great, maybe the first generation is a bit outdated. The quality of the hero 2 is great, having all the modes needed, at least for me. I do think some of the newer models have 1080p at 120 fps for high quality slowmotion which is always cool. The only thing i regret that the HD hero 2 doesnt have is the bluetooth/wifi capability. Ill tell you, i bought the extension to be able to see what im filming, but if its mounted its nearly impossible and extremely impractical to use. The later models can sync up to your phone and you can activate, control, and view from it. Also if you want to save your battery i also think they sell remotes.  As for audio, the HD hero 2 is pretty decent, but what case you use will muffle what you hear. When i fish, i use a waterproof case with float on the back, and as you would expect from a water proof case, the noises are quite muffled. Same when i snowboard. The cases do have there uses though when it comes to audio. When your cruising on a jetski, boarding down a hill, or as i will expect skating on ice (i start next week) the cases can help mute some of the wind that you will hear, while allowing you to hear louder noises."

Also try them on if you can, sometimes people prefer going an extra size up and then trimming down the excess.  All depends on how the arch support lines up with your foot."
hockeyplayers,38y10y,ShootrMgavn,2,Mon Jun 8 00:12:16 2015 UTC,"So I've been asking around and doing a lot of reading on the Superfeet yellows...  I had noticed the arch on the Superfeet insole would never match up with my arch despite the various sizes I tried.  I chalked it up to the insole just being the wrong fit for me.    Apparently, that insole is specifically designed that way.  The arch is supposed to hit on the back of your arch, in front of the heel.  The way they explain it on their website is that the insole is actually a rear-foot support as opposed to an arch support.    http://www.superfeet.com/en-us/help/#faqs/why-does-the-arch-hit-so-far-back"
hockeyplayers,38y10y,ArrogantOwl,1 point,Mon Jun 8 05:35:54 2015 UTC,"I can't imagine them being comfortable, almost like your feel would be sitting in heels. More pressure on the balls of your feet"
hockeyplayers,38y10y,el_karacho,1 point,Mon Jun 8 11:13:32 2015 UTC,"I've used them for a long time and have noticed an improvement in comfort.  I can see where your concern comes from but note a couple of things:    The heel is only raised a few mm, you'd adjust very quickly.    Many skates are profiled to have you leaning forward anyways independent of the type of insole you use.    Superfeet has a 60-day guarantee... If they don't work for you it's risk free."
hockeyplayers,38y10y,spetsnazcats,1 point,Mon Jun 8 14:59:23 2015 UTC,"Yea ive tried a bunch of insoles when i ran track, never had much success with them. I was good up to 800ish meters, anything over that and it would just kill the arch"
hockeyplayers,38y10y,spetsnazcats,2,Mon Jun 8 02:12:12 2015 UTC,"Yellow superfeet are not designed for people with flat feet. In fact, it's quite the opposite...  You will definitely need some sort of footbed - whether it's the one that comes in the skate or something else. It depends on how it feels to you. There are quite a few different footbed options. I went through a few and ended up with the Black Superfeet - the ones designed for low arches."

hockeyplayers,38uuv2,RegisteredSock,0,Mon Jun 8 11:57:06 2015 UTC,"Reebok 20k I got 2nd hand. Best skates I've ever used but not a fan of the whole pump thing. They're pretty comfortable and I felt like I was skating faster when I switched over from my old skates, maybe just in my head though."
hockeyplayers,38uuv2,Psychotic_Ninja,0,Sun Jun 7 18:38:34 2015 UTC,"Easton makos, hands down, the best skates I've ever used. They have a nice tight wrap on my foot, but aren't restrictive. I love the natural movement that I get with them. It was a little weird getting used to the forward pitch, but after 10 minutes it felt great."
hockeyplayers,38uuv2,valentulum,0,Mon Jun 8 03:55:43 2015 UTC,"Bauer Supreme 160s with the LE graphics and black Tuuks. One thing I have to say is get them baked before getting on the ice. Your feet will thank you. I unfortunately learned that the hard way. The stiffness is great for a mid-low priced boot (150 USD or so) and its the cheapest Supreme with the new LSE holder, if the whole switching steels hype is your jam. I personally don't see the ice that often (1-2 times a week), so the quick steel switch feature isn't of much use to me. I'd definitely reccomend these skates for any guys starting out or intermediate players."
hockeyplayers,38uuv2,Tom_s3rv0,0,Mon Jun 8 05:51:48 2015 UTC,"Bauer APX2s I bought them on clearance this year, I added the new LS4 steel to them and I have never had better skates. The boot construction is superb, I feel quick on my feet and just more confident in my skates in general"
hockeyplayers,38uuv2,mccarseat,0,Mon Jun 8 16:17:30 2015 UTC,"Started with Bauer Supreme One.8's. Had nothing but issues with build quality, got to keep them plus got my money back, tried Graf G35S Ultras and LOVED the forward pitch but the boots just never broke in right to my feet.  Now I'm using Graf G9035's 85 Flex size 9.5 Stock insoles, best skate I've ever used... Fit perfect right away, and even better after a bake. Only issue is the typical problem of the skate steel retention bolt coming loose, some loctite fixed that.  Edit: I do realize the build quality issues I had weren't typical but my experience did scare me away from Bauer skates unfortunately. Those boots are now Rollerblades (Installed Marsblade chassis setup) instead and will do just fine for that.  And i really started playing again with a pair of CCM Storm skates or something like that, then a pair of used Easton Synergy something or other from a friend heh."

hockeyplayers,38trlk,doth_thou_even_hoist,1 point,Sat Jun 6 19:19:24 2015 UTC,"Get low, very low. Make sure you are leaning in to your turn. Pay attention. Cross over on your good side and notice where your feet are at different parts in the turn and how much weight is on each foot, where your weight is on each skate (front/back) , the angle of your edges, your hips etc. Cross over on your bad side. Figure out what your are doing differently. Then fix it.   Also, I took skating lessons with an awesome skate instructor. She'd know if my weight was wrong, I was favoring a side etc. She also showed me some drills I can do in open skate (or stick and puck) to help. They look silly (nothing you'd do in a game), but it never bothered me. They basically force you to learn your edges and all the transitions you need for hockey. I don't have a video or I'd share it."
hockeyplayers,38thim,FLRangerFan,2,Sat Jun 6 18:00:24 2015 UTC,I suggest you use it til it breaks. If you bought it with warranty use it off the bat.

hockeyplayers,38thim,PostSneezeMist,1 point,Sun Jun 7 01:13:24 2015 UTC,Its a huge upgrade from the 65S II but same style of stick and yes Easton's do have the reputation of durability issues
hockeyplayers,38thim,kingofthediamond,1 point,Sun Jun 7 03:22:54 2015 UTC,"It's good choice for you. V9e and 65S are low-kick sticks. But V9e is top one. Despite of this, V9e is not true OPS. It's fused OPS like your 65S. I think it's not so good because true OPS sticks have better balance as usual. Moreover, V9e is heavy a bit. And I can say it is very soft stick  that creates more force with the same load.  If you like your 65S, I think v9e is good for you."
hockeyplayers,38thim,TojatMalaron,1 point,Sun Jun 7 06:32:34 2015 UTC,"V9E is essentually and RS Stealth II which is the top model of the 65S II. You'll probably like it if you like the 65S II, but yeah, durability isn't the best , that entire line. In terms of quick release and weight its great"

If there's one in driving distance I'd REALLY recommend going and trying some on. If you'll only be skating a few times a month you can go pretty cheap with your first pair just to see how you like it.  Personally, I'd go ice. I find it better competition and better play, and the rinks seem about equal between roller and ice as far as distance from you.  Laces you can use what came with the skates."

hockeyplayers,38qyvi,lostincbus,2,Sat Jun 6 02:26:51 2015 UTC,"They do! It might be worth a shot even though they don't have a good fitting system or high end skates. They should have a range of Bauers at least so you can see what fits your foot best.  Look up online for fitting your foot properly. Unlace all the way, foot all the way to the front, you should have minimal space behind your heel. Now kick your foot back in to the heel, your foot should not be sticking out above the skate. If you roll a pencil down the eyelets it should not touch your foot."

Dick's will have very little selection, and won't be able to bake them.  Real help from a knowledgeable sales person is worth is weight in good.  Tell them it's your first pair and they'll be more than happy to explain everything about how to lace them up properly and answer any other questions you might have."

hockeyplayers,38qyvi,squeebie23,1 point,Sat Jun 6 03:43:35 2015 UTC,"Agreed, although when you consider how much time you'll be in these skates (years), and how uncomfortable poorly fitting skates are, I'd easily up that travel time to 2 -3 hours."

hockeyplayers,38rab4,spam_and_eggs,3,Sat Jun 6 03:31:40 2015 UTC,"On your leg kick wrister it's basically all arms. What you really want to do is transfer all your weight straight down on to the stick using the stick's flex. And for your little habit of glancing down before shooting, try closing your eyes when practicing. It's essentially the same principal as keeping your head up."
hockeyplayers,38rab4,dontchoke,2,Sat Jun 6 05:01:17 2015 UTC,top hand looks a little close to the body. move it out from your body a bit more
hockeyplayers,38rab4,SeanP21,2,Sat Jun 6 03:57:56 2015 UTC,"Top hand further away from body, lean more in to your stick. Since your shot is more of a snapshot than a wrister, a follow through is something you'll develope with time. The looking at puck before release is a problem I've seen many people develope when they practice shooting without aiming."
hockeyplayers,38rab4,mootland,1 point,Sat Jun 6 10:50:56 2015 UTC,"A couple things:   I'm 28 years old, 5'1 and 170lbs. Been playing ice hockey for 4 years now. Consider myself a C/D player.   I'm using a new Warrior Covert DT2 (55 flex, originally 63"" cut down about 8"", W88 curve). This is the 3rd time I'm using the stick. First time I've ever really tried a low kick stick. Mostly used a TotalOne and Dolo Spyne before. I never take slap shots.   I noticed my release point is in front of my front foot. Bringing it back a little will probably help keep my shots lower.  I tend to take a quick glance at the puck before I release. Something I've been trying to work on for a while, but bad habits are hard to shake."
hockeyplayers,38rab4,hawkeepuck26,3,Sat Jun 6 03:35:37 2015 UTC,"For 4 years, you've got a pretty damn good shot. I would've thought you've been in the game a lot longer. Here's what I saw: As you mentioned, your release point seems a bit far forward, and as /u/seanp21 mentioned, your bottom hand may be a bit high. The one other thing I would suggest is the follow-through of your shot - notice how the puck ""flutters"" a bit? You might be able to flatten that out by making sure your follow through is complete - rotate your wrist through the entire motion even after the puck leaves your stick. Point the toe of your stick at the target!"
hockeyplayers,38rab4,lostincbus,2,Sat Jun 6 04:29:34 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the tips. I do need to get a stronger, more defined follow through. And hopefully dropping my bottom hand will give me even more flex on the stick"
hockeyplayers,38rab4,stevegcook,1 point,Sat Jun 6 04:54:20 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I don't see a whole lot wrong other than what you've pointed out. With that flex you could maybe press a bit harder but it looks pretty good from here!"
hockeyplayers,38rab4,meatman13,1 point,Sat Jun 6 03:41:18 2015 UTC,Thanks! I also noticed that. Seems like I'm putting pressure more forward than down into the stick. That may also help keep my release point closer to my body
hockeyplayers,38rab4,nolovedeepmeta,1 point,Sat Jun 6 03:48:28 2015 UTC,Maybe also try with your bottom hand a bit lower on the stick.  This'll allow you to load it up more.
hockeyplayers,38rab4,Gibson19,1 point,Sat Jun 6 05:52:40 2015 UTC,"I was gonna say the stick looks super short. Does it come to your chin on skates? Having a little extra length might allow you to cock the puck back farther behind yourself to give a longer windup and hopefully more speed. Work on stickhandling and getting a better feel and you'll be able to take shots without looking at the puck and it'll just flow easier.   Also, that weird little kick/step you take in some of your shots looks weird. I can't tell if that's me for not noticing people do that before or you're taking an extra step just to get on your inside foot.  The shot at 1:20 is what I'm talking about."
hockeyplayers,38rab4,MetropolisPt31,1 point,Sat Jun 6 04:14:56 2015 UTC,"In bare feet the stick comes up exactly eye level with me, so in skates it's somewhere around my mouth. And that little kick thing is a weight transfer practice for when I'm shooting in stride. It does look a little weird when I'm doing it standing still tho"
hockeyplayers,38ok5t,goofygrin,2,Fri Jun 5 15:45:35 2015 UTC,"5/8"" is a huge difference over 1/2"" and it will help you significantly I think. I actually get mine done to 5/8"" despite being small because as a defenceman I like to glide as much as possible.  When turning your weight should be on your leading foot, since that's really the only way you can cross over into your turn. Yes, you'll get used to the weight distribution, all it takes is practice! As for the feet hitting each other, they should be spread pretty far apart when turning, so you're standing too upright like you suspect. Keep your knees bent, stay low and turn your shoulders, the rest of your body should follow naturally.  For what it's worth, we get lots of new guys in our spring league in their 30s and even 40s. You'll have a blast, so don't worry about your performance, just focus on having fun!"
hockeyplayers,38ok5t,cosalich,2,Fri Jun 5 15:59:42 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the info on turning!  It's a bit unnatural (weight on inside/leading foot), but I understand why it needs to happen.  I'm going to work on the knee bend slowly and focused.  I also just had them sharpened to 5/8"". Now I'm super excited to get back out there :)"
hockeyplayers,38ok5t,glid3r,2,Fri Jun 5 16:40:01 2015 UTC,"I found it much easier to shave ice after I moved from 1/2"" to 3/4"", it really helped me learn to stop. Since you're a heavy guy on soft ice, 1/2"" is probably too much bite. I'm 6'1"" 190lb. Also, what series/model are your skates? You may benefit from the rigidity of a higher end skate due to your weight.  This is a great series of videos: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4c2AB6d-p9b-aGt4mCQRMRr9JnoYpewi  This is also a great channel: https://youtu.be/0QYfKcWosp0  I think its safe to assume you aren't bending your knees enough, both for crossovers and in your overall skating. There are probably only a few of us older, casual players who wouldn't benefit from more knee bend.  I was working on faster crossovers at public skate last night, and ya know what helped? Bending my knees more! Haha. I'm in my 30s and picking up the game has changed my life. Have fun out there with your son and good luck!"

I'm going to practice more knee bend.  That should be my #1 focus I think.  I always have to remind myself when I ski or play golf to be in that athletic position."
hockeyplayers,38ok5t,lostincbus,2,Fri Jun 5 16:38:41 2015 UTC,"Everyone has a strong side and a weak side.  Most people because of public skates can crossover to the left easily, but struggle on the right side, I was that when I first started skating.  It will come to you in time. The more you force yourself to do something the more it will come to you. Make sure you know what you need to do and try to do it on the ice slowly."
hockeyplayers,38ok5t,lostincbus,1 point,Fri Jun 5 16:28:28 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I think the nascar, only turning left during public skates has made me stronger that way, now I need to force myself to go the other way.  I can hockey stop turning right, but can't left.  Just more practice... and my right leg is technically stronger (muscle wise), but has weaker joints (knee specifically)."

Getting ski boots was interesting and required a great bootfitter... Step one, buy the biggest shell.  Step two, stretch the forefoot of the boot multiple times.  Step three, test the boot and then repeat step two a couple times.  What's worse is I was in a motorcycle accident when I was in high school and my right foot was crushed, so it's wider than the left and has a neuroma, so any extended squeezing puts me on crutches for a week or two (hence the minimalist shoes for day to day wear)."

hockeyplayers,38o1gf,brttpckr,6,Fri Jun 5 13:36:32 2015 UTC,"Honestly, the stick is terrific. A lot of people will complain about a lack of ""puck-feel"". I've played a long time and all I notice about this stick is how much better it makes my shots. The pucks explode off the blade.  I got a Landeskog curve which does almost everything well. I'd use the stick all the time if I liked the graphics a bit more. The red is gorgeous and players on your team that might normally miss you in their peripheral vision suddenly can see you. You'll get more passes and more attention all around but I think that's a good thing. I just can't get past the graphic design.  If the aesthetics don't bother you I'm sure you'll love it."
hockeyplayers,38o1gf,TeamMATH,6,Fri Jun 5 13:44:25 2015 UTC,I use the RBZ Stage 2 with the Landeskog and I can confirm everything you've said. I like that the flex point is variable to where your hands are and you can feel it.
hockeyplayers,38o1gf,willdesignforfood,1 point,Fri Jun 5 15:08:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the variable flex is really satisfying. I need to be able to ""feel"" the flex in the stick to be confident when I'm releasing a shot. I own a couple Bauer sticks (apx, apx2, 1x) and they have the low kickpoint only. Bauer sticks will shoot the puck just fine but I don't get that same confidence in loading up a shot as I do with the CCM line simply because I can't ""feel"" the flex the same way. I have a 100 flex CCM and an 87 flex 1x and I really feel like the CCM loads more, and easier.  Maybe I need to try the MX3 or the Nexus line from Bauer next time."
hockeyplayers,38o1gf,TeamMATH,1 point,Fri Jun 5 15:22:29 2015 UTC,My back-up stick is a Nexus 1000 and it does some things better than the RBZ (the blade has amazing feel) and you're right it shoots the puck just fine but with the RBZ I can really really feel the flex but with the Nexus I don't as much. I've even taken the GoPro and looked at my shot and the stick still flexes the same but I just don't feel it for some reason.
hockeyplayers,38o1gf,willdesignforfood,1 point,Fri Jun 5 15:37:33 2015 UTC,"I can only guess as to why that is. The paint? The sidewall construction of the shaft? The blade stiffness? Either way, the CCM has some magic in it. They're the closest, in terms of feel, to shooting a top-end pro-stock Easton S19/Mako/HTX, in my opinion."
hockeyplayers,38o1gf,TeamMATH,1 point,Fri Jun 5 17:17:00 2015 UTC,I'm not sure either...but I completely agree with you that the CCM has this really really satisfying flex profile that I haven't felt in another stick.
hockeyplayers,38o1gf,willdesignforfood,1 point,Fri Jun 5 20:47:14 2015 UTC,The 1x is the only bauer there with a low kick point. Until this year they all had a similar custom kick point to the ccms
hockeyplayers,38o1gf,avanross,1 point,Fri Jun 5 16:14:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I understand that. I just don't feel my Bauer sticks flex the same way. It's not something I can explain beyond ""feel"".

I also moved from 75 flex to 95 with it (as in my last stick was 75 and this one is 95). It's given me sooo much more power on my shots.

hockeyplayers,38pfzw,StarkResilient,1 point,Sat Jun 6 01:10:57 2015 UTC,The chassis will say which size wheels should be used. Running larger wheels where smaller ones are intended will lead to the wheels binding up and in the case of your hi lo's it will throw off the balance of the skate.

I use it to remind myself that I don't need to spend X number of more dollars to do something better.  I should, instead, focus on making myself better able to handle adversities.    I'm cheap, though, so there's that.  That isn't to say the list isn't interesting, though.  thanks :)"

hockeyplayers,38j1t6,chenac,5,Fri Jun 5 15:14:07 2015 UTC,Always surprised more pros don't skate Grafs.
hockeyplayers,38j1t6,owenstumor,5,Thu Jun 4 17:02:20 2015 UTC,"Graf got left in the dust. Back when every skate was made of leather, they ruled the day with better craftsmanship, varied fits, and increidble customer service. This came from their Swiss HQ. Graf canada is nowhere near as renowned, which is why Graf is still big in Europe but not so much in North America.   And when the Bauer one90 turned the industry on it's head with a composite based skate, Graf took 8 years to make something similar, and it was not even close to what Bauer and CCM were offering. They didn't advance with the industry."
hockeyplayers,38j1t6,dsjunior1388,3,Thu Jun 4 17:29:11 2015 UTC,"This is exactly what I tell everyone when they are surprised I don't carry Graf skates. They fell way behind and never caught up. They don't look good, they are lacking in technology and the kids coming up now, don't even know too much about Graf. To them, Bauer and CCM have always been the only two main options."
hockeyplayers,38j1t6,morla74,1 point,Thu Jun 4 19:19:22 2015 UTC,They aren't as stiff as the other brands and they aren't marketed as heavily. I figure most of these guys are wearing custom skates so the brand doesnt matter all that much.
hockeyplayers,38j1t6,dangerfang,1 point,Thu Jun 4 17:11:04 2015 UTC,"A custom skate is very similar to what you see at retail. Typically the customization is mostly just building it to a mold of the foot, and altering the stiffness. There are small tweaks the player may request like a certain liner, or for example Marian Hossa still wants his toecap to be covered in cloth.   A custom skate is not uniquely built from the ground up, it's still the skate it appears to be."
hockeyplayers,38j1t6,dsjunior1388,2,Thu Jun 4 17:26:59 2015 UTC,"Marian Hossa also has a heel riser, a guy I know had his old pair of skates when he played for Ottawa. A lot of guys will swap out the runners and blades as well."
hockeyplayers,38j1t6,mrpopenfresh,1 point,Fri Jun 5 01:07:17 2015 UTC,Right but the fit is the biggest difference between skate models so if they are getting it made to a certain ballast it changes the skates fit. Usually people choose their skate brand/model based on foot shape.
hockeyplayers,38j1t6,dangerfang,1 point,Thu Jun 4 17:31:31 2015 UTC,"At retail, yes. But in the pros, where they are built to your specific last, you go with how the skate itself feels. A CCM RBZ and a Bauer X1 are each going to fit Duncan Keith the same, but they are not going to skate or feel the same, and players at that level can feel the slightest difference."
hockeyplayers,38j1t6,dsjunior1388,1 point,Thu Jun 4 17:35:13 2015 UTC,"You yourself can feel the difference in different skates also.  Just because your gear isn't made for you, you'll still be able to tell the difference in a CCM skate and a Bauer skate, because they skate differently."
hockeyplayers,38j1t6,Skyline_BNR34,1 point,Thu Jun 4 23:15:35 2015 UTC,Does Graf even sponsor the athletes like Bauer or CCM does?
hockeyplayers,38j1t6,shotgoto,2,Thu Jun 4 17:13:31 2015 UTC,"Yes. In a lot of cases, the player is going to choose the skate he likes rather than the skate he is paid for. Many players have an endorsement with a company but do not wear their skates. Taylor Hall had a deal with Easton, but always wore skates from Bauer. After he became frustrated with Easton's reps, he switched to Bauers gloves and helmet too.   PK Subban broke in wearing Reebok and CCM from his AHL days. He was signed by Easton last year but has never worn Easton skates, sticking to the Reebok skates he has become accustomed to. Easton pays up anyway because he sells their gloves, sticks and helmets.   The rule of thumb is a player will use the skate and stick they want to use, and they'll use whatever gloves, pants, helmet they can get paid for."
hockeyplayers,38j1t6,dsjunior1388,1 point,Thu Jun 4 17:23:41 2015 UTC,"Warrior sponsored Kovalchuk. He was wearing only the gloves and stick but not the helmet. (Don't blame him, the Krown looks dusty as fuck but he was still sponsored.)"
hockeyplayers,38j1t6,NYDevilsFan,1 point,Fri Jun 5 00:17:06 2015 UTC,I don't think Graf pays athletes who wear their equipment. I heard this a couple years ago from an authorized Graf retailer.
hockeyplayers,38j1t6,NYDevilsFan,1 point,Fri Jun 5 00:20:00 2015 UTC,Probably has to do with them being able to get custom fitted skates so easily.

hockeyplayers,38j1t6,justacanuck88,3,Thu Jun 4 20:46:47 2015 UTC,Wasn't Reebok rebranded as CCM?
hockeyplayers,38j1t6,riverine17,1 point,Thu Jun 4 22:19:35 2015 UTC,"Yes, but a lot of players still used older style Reebok protective.  The Old Reebox 8k shin pads from like 8 years ago were just rebranded Jofa versions, or so I heard."
hockeyplayers,38j1t6,Skyline_BNR34,2,Thu Jun 4 23:18:44 2015 UTC,"Yup, Jofas are tanks."
hockeyplayers,38j1t6,ArrogantOwl,1 point,Fri Jun 5 00:39:28 2015 UTC,"That's because you can't see what they're wearing under their jerseys and socks. I can't remember the source, but something like 80% of shoulder, elbow and shin pads used in the NHL are Reebok"
hockeyplayers,38j1t6,RegisteredSock,2,Thu Jun 4 21:53:27 2015 UTC,"Not really odd at all. It would be weird if they had some people, actually.  Easton skates are dead at retail and they are dead in the pros. I'm honestly a little surprised they keep going for it (they really aren't too much anymore, they have 3 skates available...total).  Look at the online retailers and you wont see many Bauer skates on clearance. You'll see a decent amount of CCM and Graf, and a shit ton of Easton models.   We stopped carrying their skates 4 years ago and it was the best decision we had. The sad truth is they fucked up a decade ago and were never able to recover. People don't really like it when their $500 pair of skates can't even make half a season. They went for the lightest thing imaginable and came out with exactly that, but durability was shit. Then compound the fact that the EQ5 was a failed launch and they missed a year of releasing skates, its easy to see why they went from where they were a player somewhat in the skate game to completely irrelevant. The only good thing they have going for them is the fact that they still have a faithful (albeit shrinking) percentage of customers who buy their sticks, and plenty of people who eat up their marketing. They also allow literally anyone to be a dealer, so pretty much every single store has Easton available when they might not have Bauer available, or CCM, or Warrior, so if they don't have competition they automatically get bought. Almost all box stores have Easton hockey because they do so much with them on the baseball/softball side of the business."
hockeyplayers,38j1t6,about22pandas,1 point,Thu Jun 4 19:07:39 2015 UTC,"That's unfortunate to hear. Having wide, flat feet, no other brand really seemed to fit me as well as Easton. I've heard rumors that they're releasing the successor to the Mako next year and I'll probably wait until then to make my next purchase."
hockeyplayers,38j1t6,chenac,1 point,Fri Jun 5 15:15:48 2015 UTC,Not exactly true seeing as tons of pros use rebranded gear. Would be more interesting to the see non-rebrand numbers

hockeyplayers,38mngo,OzziePao13,1 point,Fri Jun 5 05:44:03 2015 UTC,"That was the top end Sherwood a few years back, and a personally favorite of mine. Great stick. Light, well balanced, good puck feel, and very durable. Get out there and use it. I know the higher flex Sherwoods (85-95) play a bit more stiff than other companies at the same flex.  You might like it. I'm sure it would be fun to zip some wristers with it at the very least, and keep it as a backup if it's not ideal for you."
hockeyplayers,38mngo,kingofthediamond,1 point,Fri Jun 5 12:38:31 2015 UTC,if it was 75 flex id give you $40. The N12 is a high end stick! What flex do you normally use?

I have a 65 flex (old model Graf something or other I got on clearance) that I use as a back-up. I can pass and stick-handle like a boss with it, since it's so light and responsive, but every time I shoot with it I feel like I'm whiffing."

hockeyplayers,38mbya,glid3r,2,Sat Jun 6 05:18:07 2015 UTC,"Sounds like you may need a boot with a more anatomical fit. I spent 5 months in Bauer Nexus, my feet would hurt badly for the first 30 mins or so. Tried waxed laces, tying different ways. I got slight improvement from tying differently, didn't like waxed laces. I went back to the LHS and got a pair of Supremes. The extra ankle/heel support/locking has given me better control and no more foot pain (I also went up a size, as I was wearing 3-4 sizes below my shoes in the Nexus).   I think I may not have realized initially how a skate should fit, how tightly it should wrap the foot, when I started. I think this may be common, as I see a lot of new players in wide fit/traditional models. They're always cranking the laces down or using waxed. Some then complain about pain/lack of feel or control"

I have had three major deaths (my grandma, my boyfriend and then my dog) in the past nine months and each time I was so thankful to have hockey to surround myself with. Watching old games on the vault, improving my own game/skating, hockey related subreddits... Not to mention all the people who I have met at the rink. It always offers something positive to look forward to, balancing out the less than positives going on in my life. I hate to sound cheesy, but ""hockey therapy"" is literally the best thing to ever happen to me."
hockeyplayers,38gcw6,lostdestinations,2,Thu Jun 4 07:05:53 2015 UTC,Felt the same way when I lost my dad and still think about him every time I play. Sorry for your losses!  Very glad to hear your hockey therapy is going well. :)

Work up a sweat, fall down ten or twenty times. Then skate up to the prettiest girl at the rink (assuming there is one of course. She's usually figure skating). No thinking about it, no hesitating, just skate up and say ""hey you're pretty good at that, how long have you been skating?"" and boom you've got an easy conversation flowing. I've found the falling and sweating made me initially think I had no chance to begin with so when I went up to the girls, I gave 0 fucks. Which resulted in me getting their numbers. 100% success rate so far."

hockeyplayers,38ex4e,cac,14,Wed Jun 3 19:34:10 2015 UTC,"The quickest way to get respect on any team is to visibly work your ass off.  Half the time your team doesn't have the puck, so they can't deliberately exclude you anyway.  Skate like a madman to get back when the other team is breaking, no matter how far behind the play you are.  Crash the net on every shot.  Make the puck carriers nervous with a hard forecheck.  With persistence you'll earn a reputation as a hard worker and your team will respect the hell out of you for it."
hockeyplayers,38ex4e,sqrlaway,4,Wed Jun 3 20:19:59 2015 UTC,Yeah I like this idea. Just be a lot more aggressive on the puck. Thanks!
hockeyplayers,38ex4e,von_neumann,3,Wed Jun 3 20:24:57 2015 UTC,"Another thing is too really focus on your play in your own zone. Even if you don't contribute much offensively, not being a defensive liability will help them build trust in you. Cover that point, and stay in position. If the D-man on your side gets the puck down low, you should be at the half-boards to give him an out.  He passes it to you then you either dump it up the boards, or catch the center/opposite winger streaking through the middle if you can safely do so. Once they see you doing the right thing over and over in your zone, they will be much more likely to take a chance on you on the other end."
hockeyplayers,38ex4e,wasdking1,9,Wed Jun 3 21:35:18 2015 UTC,"As bad as this may sound, they are partially in the right. I usually play center, and whenever I play with newer players, they are visibly nervous and perform poorly. Every now and again I do pass to them, and it usually turns into a turnover.  I don't know if you are small, big, skinny, or fat, but what I do know is that people don't pass to players who look as if they are going to cough up the puck if they look at it funny.  My advice is to keep playing with that team, make friendships with your linemates, and especially the defense. The defensemen will love you if you give them the puck even once. Always try your absolute hardest to go after the loose pucks, stand in front of the net when you are in the offensive zone. If you ever do get the puck, don't be afraid to skate for a little bit with it. My first year ever playing I fell down every time I touched the puck, and still managed to be friends with my teammates and have a good time.  If you aren't having fun after a while, just join another team. Remember, it is a fame after all.  Edit: game"
hockeyplayers,38ex4e,shotgoto,7,Wed Jun 3 19:59:30 2015 UTC,"Also back check! If you can't show your skills with the puck, or even get to the puck, show your effort by back checking!  I'm a beginner too, and I go all out when I'm on the ice. I try to be the first forward back in our defensive zone, get down low to the hash marks asap for our breakouts, and get off the ice fairly quick. You'll be able to get some respect from them by doing those little things without the puck."
hockeyplayers,38ex4e,von_neumann,5,Wed Jun 3 20:18:39 2015 UTC,"This is huge IMHO.  Everybody coughs up the puck now and then, but if you can't handle the puck and are too lazy to even skate hard, that is the double kiss of death. I love having guys on my team who are going all out and having fun, even if they aren't terribly good.  But if you take long shifts, barely skate while you are out there, then change on the back-check, you are not going to be on my team."
hockeyplayers,38ex4e,SpacemanSpiff28,5,Wed Jun 3 21:27:06 2015 UTC,"The defensemen will love you if you give them the puck even once.   Can confirm, I want to buy my forwards a pony every time they send the puck out to the point."

hockeyplayers,38ex4e,WhiskyTango3,1 point,Fri Jun 5 00:20:04 2015 UTC,"This. It's obviously for a reason if the whole team feels the same way.

hockeyplayers,38ex4e,WhiskyTango3,1 point,Wed Jun 3 20:12:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah this is what I figured. I know I'm not great. I do practice skating a lot, few times a week. But I get it.

hockeyplayers,38ex4e,Skyline_BNR34,0,Wed Jun 3 20:23:24 2015 UTC,The only other thing I would recommend is talking to the team captain about switching lines or your line mates and call them out on it also. Go to pick up as much as you can to work on skills there without having to worry about messing up.
hockeyplayers,38ex4e,WhiskyTango3,1 point,Wed Jun 3 20:38:15 2015 UTC,He'd be better off going to stick times because going to a pick up game is mostly useless unless you're trying to get into a game situation.  If you want to work on skating with a puck you need to be able to have as much time with it as possible.
hockeyplayers,38ex4e,Skyline_BNR34,0,Fri Jun 5 16:23:49 2015 UTC,"I thought he was already comfortable with skating and stick handling by his first post. If he can't already do that, which I assumed he did because he's already on a team.   Puck play is more for practicing stuff you're not comfortable doing. If he's not getting that game experience like pick up, it's going to be hard to get better playing in a team oriented situation. You can't really get too many people to pass around at puck play like you can during pick up."
hockeyplayers,38ex4e,WhiskyTango3,1 point,Fri Jun 5 18:12:20 2015 UTC,"True, but then again, depending on the skill level at the pickup it can hurt you more than anything.  I know a lot of guys don't care in pickup and pass the puck to anyone, but there are people out there that don't and try their hardest."
hockeyplayers,38ex4e,wasdking1,0,Fri Jun 5 19:05:46 2015 UTC,Yeah that can be the issue. Hopefully he has some friends or maybe teammates that can go to puck play and help him out.

You and your teammates sound like you all want to have fun and play hockey well, but the way they are approaching it (or how you're hearing it) seems to be the problem. Not everyone is the best at communication, especially when they are competing.   Just try to be nice and ask questions on how to improve your game. Generally speaking, if someone is looking to improve their game, people will give tips, and be more understanding. Generally speaking, it's better to listen first, then provide input, instead of just trying to wedge your 2 cents. Also, it's better to go in suggestive in a soft manner (ex. ""feel free to ignore this, but we could try doing XYZ"", instead of ""we should try XYZ"", the soft lead in make people more open, and generally means that you've put some thought into it, instead of just blurting something out).   Hope that helps!"

I always try and give the newer guys tips and answer any questions they have. I won't lie and say I always pass the puck to them like I would anyone else (mainly when we are down a couple of goals), but I still think it's a lot more fun and challenging to set up the new guys than a player who can cope with a bad pass.   If you are putting yourself out there to get better and asking questions and people ignore you, they just think they are hot shit. I don't really have any advice on how to deal with it other than use all the resources you have available to you online and maybe they will quit being assholes someday."

hockeyplayers,38h7ci,jollygreen311,5,Thu Jun 4 04:42:20 2015 UTC,Don't worry.  It feels weird for about five minutes - probably because you're a little higher off the ice than you're used to.  It's a quick adjustment.
hockeyplayers,38h7ci,Nodak651,3,Thu Jun 4 04:47:20 2015 UTC,"I've switched between steel several times, and not noticed the difference in height, at least as far as awkwardness is concerned.

hockeyplayers,38h7ci,jgoods77,2,Thu Jun 4 19:13:54 2015 UTC,"the height change doesn't affect me at all except in a positive way (no longer catching my outsole on the ice when turning hard) but the different blade shape (irrespective of height) does though since my blades are usually worn to a fairly significantly different shape by the time they wear out.  last time i went from worn out LS2 to step steel, i tried it for 4 or 5 games and couldn't quite get used to the drastically different heel shape, it felt fine when just cruising around and not going hard, but trying to turn at maximum effort still wasn't working, so i ended up grinding the heel down a bit to be more like what i'm used to.     i think it'll really depend on the shape of your old blades compared to the new LS3s you got."

hockeyplayers,38egzo,teachzim,10,Wed Jun 3 18:00:45 2015 UTC,If you're a winger you cover the opposing teams defenceman on your side of the ice.  If you're a centre you should cover the opposing forward that is in the high slot. If there's no forward in the high slot find the forward that isn't covered by anyone and take him.   There are of course other things you should do with respect to transitioning to offence/supporting puck battles but if you stick to those basics then you'll be defensively sound in your own end.
hockeyplayers,38egzo,Captain_Save_the_Day,9,Wed Jun 3 18:22:30 2015 UTC,Another couple of tips:  If you are covering their d-men you always want to be in between the d-man and the net so if they get the puck you're going to be in the shooting lane. Also if you are the winger in the middle of the ice for a face off in your own end you want to get to your opposing d-man fast. Ignore everything else and skate at them. You'll be surprised at how many turn overs you'll create by either intercepting a bad pass from the other d-man or by pressuring your d-man.  If you're covering a forward down low it's very important to keep a very close gap. Like touching them. You'll want to keep light/moderate contact and try to stay between them and the net. No need to Chris Pronger anyone but frustrate them.
hockeyplayers,38egzo,Captain_Save_the_Day,4,Wed Jun 3 18:34:12 2015 UTC,"Check this link  for some easy to digest information on positioning. Explains well what we should be doing. If you remember one thing (for the love of God) don't stray past your face-off dots. That's your border. I'm constantly pushing the wingers out of my defensive zones so that they can go cover the other team's defender. When the D clears the puck hard along the boards, not having the winger to challenge their defender from keeping it in is what makes the difference. Hard to do that if you're way out of position or standing in front of me.   A winger's main job on the defensive is to get that puck past the blue line. Stay near the boards, stay about one stick length from your person to cover, get ready to chip the puck over the blue line."

hockeyplayers,38egzo,Captain_Save_the_Day,1 point,Wed Jun 3 18:24:21 2015 UTC,perfect! Thanks
hockeyplayers,38egzo,von_neumann,2,Wed Jun 3 18:32:22 2015 UTC,My understanding (tell me if I'm missing something) as a winger... position near/inside the circle on your side- so you can see the  opposing dman at the blue line and the forward of the other team in the corner- Be available to intercept passes in front of the net & come out to cover the blue line/defender.  Breakout: Skate toward the goaline when your dman has the puck behind the net- open up moving toward the boards to accept a pass and start a break out.
hockeyplayers,38egzo,Zinc68,3,Wed Jun 3 18:27:32 2015 UTC,Yes. But your main responsibility is the d-man. Depending on your ability level I'd say that intercepting passes in front of the net should be a secondary responsibility.
hockeyplayers,38egzo,spartanKid,1 point,Wed Jun 3 18:52:35 2015 UTC,"Stay between the opposing D-Man and the net if the other team has the puck. If one of your D-men has the puck down low on your side of the net and has a winger pressuring him, then hug the half boards so you can be his out.  That way all he has to do is bounce the puck up the boards to you. Then you can either skate it up, catch your center/opposite winger streaking through the middle, or just bang it up the boards if there is no room for anything else. Not covering the point, and not being in position to give your D-man an out are the two most common mistakes I see newer wingers make."
hockeyplayers,38eft8,Cwillyz,5,Wed Jun 3 17:54:07 2015 UTC,"I'd advise against going that deep. I was just talking with the team's equipment manager at our rink, and he suggests that skaters go as shallow as they can on their hollow. He has all of his players skates sharpened as shallow as they can control. Obviously we're talking about a different caliber here (I'd assume) but he was saying that it can really reduce the wear and tear on your body. Just something to consider."
hockeyplayers,38eft8,MF26,1 point,Wed Jun 3 19:01:01 2015 UTC,"Well, at that point you're trading speed for control on your edges. A lot of it is personal preference, but I like the deeper cuts. I'm heavier than OP and regularly get 7/16 and even down to 3/8. I skated on a 1/2 cut and felt the diminished edge control want worth the better glide. It all depends on preference and skating style."
hockeyplayers,38eft8,PavelMatsyuk,1 point,Thu Jun 4 04:30:11 2015 UTC,"Of course it is preference, but the recommendation is to go as shallow as you can control. If you have good edge control you don't need to augment that with a deeper cut. At that point you're just putting more strain on your groin, hips, knees etc, and working harder to get around than you need to."
hockeyplayers,38eft8,MF26,2,Thu Jun 4 20:22:50 2015 UTC,"Definitely get ice time on any hollow change if you can. You really don't want to hop into a game on unfamiliar blades.  As for the change, maybe try 7/16"" first. It's in between 1/2 and 3/8. Ease into it and see if you like it or not before jumping all the way to 3/8"
hockeyplayers,38eft8,kr580,2,Wed Jun 3 18:31:03 2015 UTC,I took the jump and went from 3/4ths to 3/8ths and then went to drop in... Was a big eye opener...
hockeyplayers,38eft8,pegupine,2,Wed Jun 3 20:04:36 2015 UTC,For sure get in some ice time.  It would suck if you're not used to the extra bite and end up hitting the boards on a failed quick stop :(
hockeyplayers,38eft8,charcharcharmander,2,Wed Jun 3 20:09:50 2015 UTC,"You will get more bite, but a smaller hollow will slow you down noticeably (because more friction), so you should weigh the pros and cons. Do you like making tight turns, or would you rather win a race to the puck? Odds are, if you're a beginner, you're not going to puck handle well enough to make a tight escape on someone anyways.    If you do change it, I recommend practicing your stops before your game. Stopping is a little harder with a deeper hollow because it bites harder."
hockeyplayers,38eft8,Zuvielify,1 point,Wed Jun 3 21:20:42 2015 UTC,"My friend who is around your weight, but significantly shorter, just switched from 1/2 to 3/8 and is liking the extra bite. He's said it does make stopping more difficult and took some sessions to get used to, but is better at carving turns. He hasn't said that his glide has been reduced much. We're both beginner league players as well.  I never like to blame my shortcomings with skating on equipment though. Still, try a 3/8, if you dont like it, u can always go back.   Does your ice surface get softer in the summer? That'd be something to consider when going down to 3/8 from 1/2 as well."
hockeyplayers,38eft8,glid3r,2,Wed Jun 3 18:33:56 2015 UTC,Totally agree with the last sentence here. The temp of your rink in the summer is HUGE for your hollow right now.

hockeyplayers,38dc5x,chenac,6,Wed Jun 3 14:06:30 2015 UTC,"A few years ago, I was cut off on my bike and flipped over the handlebars. When I landed, I overextended my shoulder causing a labral tear. My shoulder felt fine at first. It didn't bother me but then I noticed little things would annoy me. The big one was when I went to push up out of bed with my arm I could feel a strain. I would recommend not doing anything for two weeks. No hockey, no weights, no disc golf, no nothing and then take a look. If it is still there, you will want to see a Dr. who will suggest an MRI and they will be able to tell you what is up. Hockey is great, but for your safety I would take a break."
hockeyplayers,38dc5x,lovedetroit,2,Wed Jun 3 14:26:12 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I think I'll take your advice and resort to doing more cardio instead! Did your shoulder end up healing okay?"
hockeyplayers,38dc5x,lovedetroit,2,Wed Jun 3 19:17:04 2015 UTC,"If I gave you a %, it would be 98%. Dr. did the repair and made it really tight so my arm was essentially locked in to one position. I can't find the last athlete that had it but they managed to be a full recovery at three months. Average me took about 4 months to get to 85 and then another year to get to 98%. I have a 2% because I do need to stretch it out every once and awhile. Otherwise, all good."
hockeyplayers,38dc5x,kingofthediamond,3,Wed Jun 3 19:33:35 2015 UTC,I would definitely rest as much as possible. I also recommend picking up some KT tape or another brand of Kinesiology tape. This stuff works really well making you mobile with less pain
hockeyplayers,38dc5x,mrtheman28,2,Wed Jun 3 14:25:46 2015 UTC,"This stuff was amazing when I had slap shot arm about a year ago.  It's not a long term solution but it helped me not reinjure while still letting me get some practice in.  Mine was below the elbow on my upper shooting arm but you should be able to apply it higher too.  Instead of buying one, go to your local bike shop where they'll have a mountain of old punctured tubes that are gonna get thrown out because nobody patches bike tubes.    If you're nice they'll give you a few for free, just cut the valve stem out and then cut down the middle lengthwise and wash out all the talc powder with some soap."

hockeyplayers,38dc5x,mrtheman28,2,Wed Jun 3 19:28:44 2015 UTC,"Not the tire, the tube that goes inside the tire.  It's a much different rubber than the actual contact with the ground tire rubber, basically exactly the same as those bands.  E: I didn't look closely enough at your link, I was thinking of something else :/"
hockeyplayers,38dc5x,kingofthediamond,1 point,Wed Jun 3 19:31:50 2015 UTC,How does one apply the tape? I've heard lots about it but have no idea what to do with it.
hockeyplayers,38dc5x,I_am_Bear_Claw,2,Wed Jun 3 19:15:57 2015 UTC,Basically you just stretch it a bit and apply to your body. theres instructions in the package. Its super easy
hockeyplayers,38dc5x,Coat_of_aRMZ,3,Wed Jun 3 19:28:34 2015 UTC,"I strained my left shoulder years ago at the gym, hurt really bad but figured I would play through it.  Ended up hurting more and more so I went to the doc and they said I had a minor tear in my shoulder and that I was an idiot for trying to play before seeing the doctor.  Moral of the story is I would go see a doctor first if the pain is bad enough for you to be asking if you should or shouldnt be shooting.  Hope you get better though and get back to putting pucks in the net."
hockeyplayers,38dc5x,mojotooth,3,Wed Jun 3 14:52:30 2015 UTC,"Always see a M.D. for medical advice. That recommendation comes from past mistakes...   Even if you are 25 and heal fast, you still might need to take a season off to recuperate. I've had to take off whole seasons to recoup from elbow, knee, and back strains.   Are you normally right or left handed? With things like handwriting."
hockeyplayers,38dc5x,mojotooth,2,Wed Jun 3 22:47:09 2015 UTC,This past weekend after my beloved Ducks were eliminated I went to the driving range. Since then my shoulder has been killing me maybe I had bad form idk? I had a game last night and got a hat trick. So I would definitely rest it since you don't want to hurt yourself worse. But maybe play a game you might get a hatty.
hockeyplayers,38dc5x,spartanKid,2,Wed Jun 3 14:40:14 2015 UTC,"If it hurts to do a motion, you should stop doing it until you do something to address the issue. Maybe that something is just anti-inflammatories and rest.  When I tore my supraspinatus tendon on my right shoulder (I shoot right-handed), I could still shoot but taking faceoffs was excruciating. I had to get rotator cuff surgery to repair that tendon."

hockeyplayers,38csew,nashinga,4,Wed Jun 3 11:30:21 2015 UTC,"Everyone is doing their jobs if they're knocking the puck away from you. Work on tight stickhandling, keep the puck moving. keep your body between your defender and the puck - make them reach around to knock the puck off your stick."
hockeyplayers,38csew,ErnDizzy,2,Wed Jun 3 11:55:27 2015 UTC,"Yea, and to add to this: get your own stick off the puck when you anticipate a poke incoming. Too many beginner/novice/intermediate players keep the puck glued to their stick which results in them losing control easily when there's stick on stick contact.  This can't happen if the puck isn't on your stick -at that moment-.  Truly, learning to keep the puck in safe spots and maintaining full possession without needing your stick on the puck 100% of the time are important skills, especially for play along the boards."
hockeyplayers,38csew,the_anj,3,Wed Jun 3 14:08:50 2015 UTC,Best advice in this thread.  It took me a long time to realize this on my own.
hockeyplayers,38csew,Nodak651,2,Thu Jun 4 00:23:10 2015 UTC,Protect the puck with your body and get used to the reach that a defender has to know your positioning.
hockeyplayers,38csew,acholon,2,Wed Jun 3 13:33:57 2015 UTC,"Try shooting early or late. What I mean is shoot before you get close enough for the goalie to poke it. If you shoot in stride you could possibly throw the goalie off guard. Also you can throw in a huge fake, like you're going to shoot and freeze the goalie then come in close so he cant react fast enough"
hockeyplayers,38csew,kingofthediamond,2,Wed Jun 3 14:22:50 2015 UTC,"Keep the puck closer to your body.  It will also help you have a harder, more accurate shot."
hockeyplayers,38csew,jackwoww,1 point,Wed Jun 3 17:27:43 2015 UTC,"Don't be right on top of the goalie, unless you are trying to screen him. Try and find the open spaces and always have your stick on the ice.  Don't think that you need to hurry to the net. If you are open, linger around the high slot and be ready to shoot."
hockeyplayers,38csew,queefkicker,2,Wed Jun 3 12:45:45 2015 UTC,"I was referring to carrying the puck in across the blue line, mostly 1 on 1 fast break scenarios."
hockeyplayers,38csew,queefkicker,2,Wed Jun 3 13:14:09 2015 UTC,"1 on 1 vs a defender- Practice your stickhandling, and don't be predictable. Speed around flat footed defenders. Use your body and legs to defend the puck. Try to beat the defenders on your strong side to create more space.   You don't always have to beat the defender. Use him as a screen, shoot and drive to the net for a rebound. I like to get the goalie moving one way and shooting the other."
hockeyplayers,38csew,Mission2287,2,Wed Jun 3 13:51:12 2015 UTC,"Have you thought of not trying to go around the defender? Use the defenseman as a screen instead and then head to the net and look for a rebound. Sometimes, you gotta take what they give you. I like to try to keep the defense guessing. One time I'll shoot, another I'll try to make a move, the next time I might slow the play down to try to make a pass."
hockeyplayers,38csew,jesusisaslut,1 point,Wed Jun 3 16:31:49 2015 UTC,"The only time you should be in poke checking range of a goalie is when you're screening him. If you have the puck in the area I circled you need to get a shot off, unless you have speed coming in on an odd man break, but then you're trusting your deking skills. If you don't have the puck you should be at the hashmarks-ish area. Without the puck you're jostling with your defender for the position closer to the puck. A mistake I used to make a lot was always trying to be back door, but even if you're open behind the defender the defensemen are smart enough to get in the passing lane. It's your job to try and be a threat with his stick down in front of the net. Shots that close don't need to be very hard or accurate to go in. Tl;dr: If you have the puck in the circled area, SHOOT. If you don't have the puck get between the defense and the puck. http://i.imgur.com/YBLF1Df.jpg"

I bought a cheap easton synergy shaft and the blades are usually easton ABS. I usually just go for cheapest abs since the blade curve and all that doesnt really matter when youre shooting a ball i think
hockeyplayers,38a4gi,onombd,1 point,Tue Jun 2 22:03:03 2015 UTC,"I think this is the only way to go. Get as decent of a tapered shaft you can afford, and just be ready to keep buying new blades. I don't see why the curve wouldn't matter, but the material certainly won't be very important hitting a ball. Get a cheap blade in the curve you want and that's about it. Getting a decent shaft in the right flex is pretty much the only important thing here."

The thing is the blades might not fight into newer OPS's as they are more narrow on the blade end. What many people do is stick the blade into the butt end. Although you might argue that this messes with the kickpoint, in my experience it works quite well for most sticks (some really suck when you do this). Just try it out before you throw it away."

hockeyplayers,3892q3,_TheDude-Abides,7,Tue Jun 2 18:21:31 2015 UTC,It's really more about when the marketing cycles happen. Bauer CCM Easton all do about an 18 month cycle next up for bauer is the Nexus line of Skates and Sticks so last generation will wind up being about 30-40% cheaper what kind of gear did you use and what are you hoping to have now? I can put together a comprehensive assortment within a given budget if you like and post it here for additional feedback from the community.
hockeyplayers,3892q3,Tom_s3rv0,1 point,Tue Jun 2 18:27:39 2015 UTC,"I was planning on sort of piecing it together as I go. I haven't been on ice in a good 12 years so I have to start over. I never had anything high level. I need to get skates first and get my legs under me again. So for this round I was going to grab skates, stick, gloves, and a helmet, since that's required for local Stick and Puck sessions. Then I'll hopefully fill out when Winter leagues roll around. I'm trying to keep my budget low but not locked. Maybe $250 - 300 for the essentials then I'll fill out as I go."
hockeyplayers,3892q3,Tom_s3rv0,4,Tue Jun 2 18:43:03 2015 UTC,"The only thing I might suggest and this is debatable, would be to devote more money to skates, just so when you do play you have something that is safer for on ice use a mid-level bauer skate (style depending on foot shape) will serve you well for a quite a while and will hold up while skating. As a fellow Chicagoan I'd say go check out your local shop or Total Hockey if it's not too far to drive. Try on literally every skate in the store. Bauer Nexus is traditional wide fit, CCM RBZ is fairly similar, Vapor and Ribcor are tapered more narrow fitting, while Supreme and Tacks are built to wrap the foot for a minimal negative space fit. Whatever is the most comfortable is what you should buy, ignore what players wear, ignore what is the ""best deal"" if the skates don't fit as you may well know, they're not much use to you.  for the type of build you are trying to do in entry level gear just to get back into things here's what I recommend:  Skates:Vapor x70  This is really as low as I would recommend going these are the first skates in the vapor line that uses tech mesh instead of full composite, the full composites are incredibly stiff, but aren't necessary for getting started, but if you are going to be playing in stick and puck or drop in at all I'd recommend at least having a well constructed techmesh boot, I think bauer really has their skates at an amazing place in the market at most price points I use vapor because they fit me, find a skate in the Bauer line that fits you there very likely will be one. Bear in mind these are great skates and you don't NEED more than this $160  Gloves: Eagle PPF X705 Eagle has something special with what they put out there, the palms are truly a marvel in the range of what is out there these days, size 14 should be a good fit unless you have very small hands then drop to a 13 these are a traditional 4 roll glove volume fit plenty of room for your wrists to roll while you stickhandle, an absolute steal at $65  Helmet Bauer IMS 5.0 With a cage a helmet that will do its job, I'd recommend spending more but for the budget it will keep your head from cracking if you fall, I can't stress trying things on enough on this one helmets only work when they fit properly I went from a large to a medium when I bought a new bucket so just try things on first, even if it means getting a size then ordering online. $50  Stick- Grab yourself a good ol' wooden twig, they worked for almost a century and while the new sticks are a blessing, there's no reason to go for broke right out of the gate, save your money for a year or two then get either a clearance stick or one step down from top end, $40 max.  Total :$315"

Pick a workout you like and then replace the movements with equal movements on the bowflex.    I.E. Barbell Bench  Press = Bowflex Bench..
hockeyplayers,389c8n,superjew1492,3,Tue Jun 2 19:11:52 2015 UTC,"I've only ever seen one guy skate with them, and man did they sound weird. You'd never mistake him for anyone else, even if you didn't see him. Was kinda nice when he was behind me and called for the drop."

hockeyplayers,389c8n,MachReverb,2,Tue Jun 2 21:11:15 2015 UTC,"I had them for a bit, they felt okay to skate on. They were loud as hell skating around, it almost sounded like I was running the crushed ice machine with them. The cool thing about them was, I was really able to figure out what I liked to skate on because it was so easy to change lie/rocker/radius (They were $14.99 on hockeymonkey back then).  I'm not sure that I'd buy another pair, just because it almost always requires you to have a spare set of the blades on hand, as many pro shops don't carry them. They typically lasted around 15 skates, though (sharpenings are around 5)."
hockeyplayers,389c8n,EnsErmac,2,Tue Jun 2 22:31:18 2015 UTC,"I had a pair when they were ""The next big thing"" much like the flat bottom V sharpening is now. I really liked being able to change the rocker and radius in a minute without having to experiment. If you want to change your radius on traditional runners it would require a lot of work. T-Blades it takes about 2 minutes.  I did like that I could try basically whatever sharpening configuration I wanted to and be able to immediately revert back. However, now that I have ""traditional"" runners, I haven't thought about them at all. I wont go back, but I was glad I tried it because I wouldn't have tried changing rockers. Turns out I like the ""medium"" rocker, or the one your skates come with out of the box, the best."

He says they last forever, like an entire year (which is probably 60-75 games for him, not sure if he skates with his kids in practices or anything like that.)  I've been wanting to throw them on and see how they do at some point."
hockeyplayers,3874u9,Seaplusplus,9,Tue Jun 2 09:31:45 2015 UTC,"Incorporate more knee bend. You're hunched over at the waist, not bending enough at the knees. It'll give you a clearer view of the ice and will force you to make a more complete, powerful stride.   Stop swinging your arms like a speed skater. Once you get a stick in your hands you'll end up pitchforking the other guys in men's league and get your ass kicked."
hockeyplayers,3874u9,bubbachet,3,Tue Jun 2 14:37:59 2015 UTC,"Also OP, the arm swinging tends to sway your body side to side, throwing off your balance. Nothing good about the side to side swing. Front to back arm swing works though."
hockeyplayers,3874u9,kr580,4,Tue Jun 2 17:45:41 2015 UTC,"Looks good so far  Forwards: longer strides, would help to get your knees bent a bit more and chest up, work on keeping your arms going forward this will also help keep your upper body more stationary.  Backwards: Crossovers are pretty good, start working on crossing over the other direction and feel your edges pull you through. When starting backwards the big C cut should use more of the blade and finish at the toe more.  Keep it up bud"
hockeyplayers,3874u9,acholon,2,Tue Jun 2 14:39:35 2015 UTC,"Agree with the C cut.  You should not really be completing the C as you then are turning your skate inwards and losing speed. This whole video has some good tips, and about half way through describes how to do this a bit better as acholon described. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRSqqWyM74Y  This video also has some good technique for getting more speed and power backwards https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2MhA5XJ0Us.  Incorporating starting with crossovers, and possibly alternating crossovers instead of straight Cs/swizzles will be even quicker once you get more comfortable."

hockeyplayers,3874u9,acholon,1 point,Tue Jun 2 18:52:33 2015 UTC,"When you are starting from a stop you get very little power, fix this by getting more knee bend and having a more powerful ""c cut"" into the ice. This c cut should slice the ice using as much blade as you can and finishing with a small snap at your toes."

hockeyplayers,3874u9,lostincbus,2,Wed Jun 3 00:42:17 2015 UTC,If you want to get lower practice dragging each knee on the ice and see how low you can get your ass when gliding. If you practice those you'll get more knee bend and more stability.
hockeyplayers,3874u9,ArrogantOwl,2,Tue Jun 2 15:47:15 2015 UTC,Just keep skating and you'll get better and better.  You're looking good for a beginner.
hockeyplayers,3874u9,ciabattabing16,2,Tue Jun 2 16:46:09 2015 UTC,"Also, skate the other way. I know sometimes they don't let you at open skates, but often times you can skate the opposite direction in the middle if there aren't figure skaters. Work both directions, turns, stops, etc... so you aren't single leg dominant."
hockeyplayers,3874u9,buffalawl,2,Tue Jun 2 19:23:20 2015 UTC,Couple of things I noticed that haven't been mentioned yet:   Pick up your damn head when skating backwards. It also seems like your head is bobbing a lot which means you're wasting energy. Bring your feet in closer on the backwards C cuts. Your feet should pretty much end up touching. This will give you a more powerful stride. Bigger C cuts on the backwards crossovers as well. Try to get more push under on the forward and backward crossovers.
hockeyplayers,3874u9,ciabattabing16,2,Tue Jun 2 21:36:12 2015 UTC,"My take:   When skating backwards, don't go in a straight line.  Zig zag, and cross over, like when you're turning at the end.  If you watch guys skating, you get more power out of cutting into the ice, and accelerating. Forwards - same deal, cross over more, less side-to-side skating and more crossing over.  Surprisingly, your lean is good.  A big mistake people make when trying to skate, particularly when starting, is they put motion into going UP, taller, and not out, forward.  Lean forward like you do, swing your arms less (although that's not really an issue when you have a stick and gear on most likely), and after your first few accelerations, cross over a bit.  It's all about getting those cuts into the ice.  You'll hear that crunching sound as you push, vs. a glide if your just coasting and not getting acceleration   All in all, you're a significantly better skater than most new people, and you'll improve as time goes on.  If you can get to the ice 2 days a week, for pickup hockey, stick and shoot, etc, within two months you'll see a massive improvement.  The more ice time the better."
hockeyplayers,3874u9,bubbachet,4,Tue Jun 2 13:59:18 2015 UTC,"I understand this while going backwards, as i feel like the crossovers give you more power than normal backwards skating. But why when going forward? Wouldn't zigzagging going forward slow you down?"
hockeyplayers,3874u9,BrummieRed,1 point,Tue Jun 2 16:18:17 2015 UTC,"Depends on your goal.  So launching, like speed skaters, will start standing sideways and cross over leg over leg the first few strides.  Why?  Because you can angle the blades and dig into the ice (that crunch sound).  But then straight skating, yes, you don't cross over, however you also don't want to do...I guess sort of like the ""wobble"" you can see OP doing in his stride, leaning side to side almost.  Shortest distance between two points on the ice is indeed a straight line, that principle still persists.  However, starting from a standstill you'd want to be sideways, or even starting from a turn, is usually better because those first few strides can be crossovers.  I suppose I worded it funny."
hockeyplayers,3874u9,geauxtigers55,3,Tue Jun 2 16:39:53 2015 UTC,None of this makes any sense from a power skating perspective.

Just be aware that could happen, but hopefully it doesn't.  My sister plays men's hockey with me in the summers and does fine, but she is 5'11 looks like any guy out there.

I can't imagine they would not play aggressively around you, but big hits would be avoided, except by Dickbag's older brother, since there are usually people watching and no one wants to be known as the one thag hits girls.

I'm only concerned because I don't want them to play any different or treat me any different because I'm a girl."
hockeyplayers,384xyb,Fireonahill,1 point,Tue Jun 2 11:04:45 2015 UTC,"well... yeah they're going to treat you different. The guys on you're team will be pretty protective of you. If you ever get laid out there is going be a scrum. At least there always was when there was a girl on my team. As for them being awkward wont you already know most of them, I mean you go to school with them, they shouldn't be any more awkward than normal"
hockeyplayers,384xyb,Fireonahill,1 point,Wed Jun 3 00:30:35 2015 UTC,"To be honest they will treat you differently. there's always going to be that ""girl on the boys team"" mentality no matter how much you become friends with them. It's going to be much more awkward for them than it will for you (i would think, anyways). Just make sure to be friendly and not prolong the awkward stage. They should be protective of you if you develop a quick friendship.  have you played contact hockey before?  and sorry for the late reply."
hockeyplayers,384xyb,Fireonahill,1 point,Wed Jun 3 04:08:50 2015 UTC,"Not contact, unless you consider battling for the puck along the boards. I'm going to be training with my coach all summer to prep me for the high school season. From what I heard, it's pretty easy to make the team, as there's not a big competition to compete with. Shit, I could even make varsity if I tried a little harder, that's how easy it is to get on the team. There's not even a freshman team, not that I would be on it anyway, too old.

It was about that time when the dudes really hit puberty and the girls stopped playing on the male teams. Up until that point it was never a big deal. Sometimes the chicks would lay dudes out, and sometimes a dude would lay the chicks out. Some dudes play a little easy against girls, some dudes play harder.  Only thing that is for certain is that if a chick on your team gets hit you are out for some heads."
hockeyplayers,384xyb,Vargatron,1 point,Tue Jun 2 05:57:26 2015 UTC,"Depends on the league and level in my opinion.   If it is a beer league that allows physical play but no direct checking, you definitely rub them on the boards a little lighter than you would guys. I don't have any experience with leagues that allow checking, so you'll have to resort to other's comments."
hockeyplayers,384xyb,TwoMinuteMinor,1 point,Tue Jun 2 11:30:17 2015 UTC,If it's just a casual league I wouldn't expect much hitting. The most you'll get is some aggressive board play.   Although- my personal opinion about girls and men's mixed teams is you re all out there and playing the game knowing the risks and all elements involved. Most of the girls I play with level guys twice their size and get it back in return.
hockeyplayers,384xyb,Etcetera-Etc-Etc,1 point,Tue Jun 2 12:12:33 2015 UTC,"I'll admit at first, I would be worried about hitting a girl, but the second I step out on the ice and a girl start playing the body on me, you stop seeing it in terms of man vs woman and just see another hockey player.  Just keep your head up.  Doubt you'll have to worry about too many open ice hits, especially if you're just playing beer league.  Protect yourself on the boards, and don't expect to be seen as anything other than another hockey player."

hockeyplayers,384xyb,somewhat_random,1 point,Tue Jun 2 13:31:42 2015 UTC,"In my experience as coach, the fact that you're a girl is not really the issue. It's all about size.  If you are too small to take a hit from the biggest guys on the ice safely, then you should carefully consider the level at which you are playing. If you're constantly in fear of getting lit up, then you are not going to be an effective player.  Most of the time, the bigger guys will not try to crush the smaller players, but there are always the few who will take out their frustrations on an easy target. Boy or girl - it doesn't matter. If a player with an 80-pound advantage on you hits you, and you're not prepared to take that hit, then you are going to get hurt (not necessarily injured, but it won't feel good).   In the US, full checking hockey starts at the 14U level now. My 14 year old kid is about 190 lbs and 5'11"" and very strong. I've never seen him throw a big check on a much smaller kid, but I can tell you that if he decided to check the smallest kids in his league last year (probably closer to 4'10"" and 110 lbs), he could have done some real damage.   My point is that you have to remember that there is no rule protecting the smaller players. So you better be able to protect yourself (even if just with speed and awareness)."
hockeyplayers,384xyb,ArrogantOwl,1 point,Tue Jun 2 15:10:17 2015 UTC,"I had a girl on my varsity HS team. She was somewhat small, but not much smaller than the more skilled 9th/10th graders that made the team. I hate to write this as I am all of gender equality, but I think we were all a bit extra defensive of her. Meaning that if someone got rough with her, we might have come to her defense a bit more quickly than for anyone else. One of the bigger guys on that team (6'2/230 or so) had a bit of a crush on her. If he was on the ice and someone was a bit rough, he would mark and flatten the guy. The opposing team learned pretty quickly to be mindful.  Regardless, good luck on the team!"
hockeyplayers,384xyb,ArrogantOwl,1 point,Tue Jun 2 16:15:58 2015 UTC,"Thanks! Yeah I wouldn't have a problem with being protected by my teammates, that's a good thing and I'd do the same for them! I'm just afraid of being treated like a delicate friggin flower out there on the ice, that's all."
hockeyplayers,384xyb,Rohcky00,1 point,Tue Jun 2 18:30:58 2015 UTC,"The high school league I played in had probably about 1.5 girls per team if you averaged it all out. Generally the girls didn't really get hit, I guess just because, except for this one girl. This girl in particular would play defense and then take it coast to coast with her head down because she knew no one would hit her. So one time I did.  So just don't take advantage of the fact no one is hitting you."
hockeyplayers,384xyb,wingsarchitect,1 point,Tue Jun 2 18:39:11 2015 UTC,I play in a co-ed non-checking leagues that doesn't have enough women so some teams have all guys and most teams have only one maybe two girls.  Most guys are willing to play the body a bit against each other with no problem but some guys get really put out if a girl plays them the same way and then they get nasty and vengeful.  Most people will be fine but some will be stupid. Some guys will make a point of hitting you harder to show that they are real men in a man's sport - sorry but the good news is that the rest of your team will usually take care him. Targeting the girl is usually licence for the entire team to target him back.

For the first few months of my first season I never got hit. After the guys started realizing I gave as good as I got, they played me like any other player. It was fun!  Every once in a while I'd be against a guy player who didn't want to check me though. I was on a breakaway one game with a defenseman trailing me. His coach was screaming ""hit her! hit her!"" and he goes ""I can't! She's a girl!"""

Never gets called and drives me nuts! Could be a guy doing this and i'd be just as annoyed."
hockeyplayers,384xyb,puckinright,1 point,Wed Jun 3 20:49:37 2015 UTC,"Keep you head up. Throwing nasty hits is a major rush for HS boys. If you're head-down and a girl, you're going to get mashed. Learn to counter-check. TJ Oshie was the master of this in his college days. Ask one of the more tankish seniors to teach you. You're going to get hit. So the best thing to do is start initiating contact. If you get out there, and establish that you play the hitting game like the rest, everyone will settle in and just play hockey. You're going to targeted sometimes, especially if you're small. In HS, we knew that the one team in our league with girls would do something REALLY dumb if you could run one of their girls, so we would. Your teammates will protect you, more than they regularly do for other teammates (which is already a LOT compared to other sports), but you need to let people know you can handle you and take no shit. This will go a ways in keeping your team out of trouble, and keeping you safe.   Understand the world you're stepping into, embrace the physicality."

They are pant lowers, right?  Do they have the thigh boards in them?  Obviously your best bet is to find the matching uppers if so.  520ECHL = CCM/Rbk HP30/35 also.  Tackla uppers have lots of buttons so your chances of aligning with the holes in your lowers are greater.  I would look for a pro stock 9k girdle.  It is very comfy and the legs are detachable so you can use them with full pant lowers (thigh boards in) or a shell, as long as it has a belt."

Here's a tip: I find that when the legs of the girdle are wrapped around the legs they interfere with my shin pads, so I just attached the tip of the velcro instead of the whole strap and they flow freely like a regular pant.

If someone runs into you because they're not looking and goes down it's usually not a penalty, although it's also kind of expected that you'll slow down and make sure the person is okay no matter whose fault it was.  It's a pretty beginner league."
hockeyplayers,383np4,themaincop,1 point,Mon Jun 1 19:40:15 2015 UTC,"So our league it's the same rule,  and refs have explained this to me (after I've gotten a few checking penalties) that if they think you had enough time to stop,  that's a check.   If they feel both guys had no chance to stop,  they'll let it go,  as long as you don't extend out your arms/elbows.

hockeyplayers,383fav,Gibson19,6,Mon Jun 1 16:01:22 2015 UTC,"I'm a physician, for what its worth. Unless you are sitting in wet gear, have open wounds, and/or have some sort of immune system deficiency there is little to worry about. If you have an open wound, do your best to keep it clean, dry, and protected from further injury,  but you don't not necessarily need to avoid playing. Certainly if the wound is in an area that may continue to be aggravated by playing (say for example, a cut on your achilles may be worsened by skating) you should wait until it has healed sufficiently. Really, its mostly common sense. If you sit around in wet gear for hours and hours and don't shower for days, certainly your risk of developing an infection may rise. I really don't think there is much to worry about.  In terms of when to seek medical advice when you think you have an infection, I would suggest that any wound or potential skin infection that has developed pus, has redness that is spreading, has become increasingly painful, has developed significant swelling, become very red or ""angry"" looking, presence of fevers/chills would warrant further medical attention.   Hope that helps."

Buy a bottle of Tea Tree Oil and if you do get an open cut or sore, wash the wound with soap and water and then swab a few drops of oil onto the area. Tea Tree Oil doesn't sting and kills MRSA in roughly 6 hours.   My son got a pretty decent cut on his elbow (his pads are way too small) at the beginning of practice and I was concerned since the wound was sitting there in a warm, wet environment for the next hour. After practice he showered and then a couple of drops of Tea Tree Oil on a cotton pad, wipe the area... next day no sign of infection.   Here's the science for Tea Tree Oil. Just make sure to ""spot-test"" on yourself so you know you are not allergic to the oil.  Any skin infection will produce redness and swelling. It will also feel warm to the touch. If you have a similar condition, use the Tea Tree Oil, but go see a doctor the next day if there isn't visible improvement (less redness and swelling)."

hockeyplayers,3805rc,BleedBlueToDeath,3,Sun May 31 23:02:40 2015 UTC,"Skate, pass, and shoot with your head up. Seriously. I'm no expert, and I'm definitely guilty of it at times, too, but the biggest mistake I see guys making in beer league is skating, passing, and shooting with their heads down. You need to know where you are on the ice, and where the net is in relation to you when you're shooting. You need to know where your teammates are when you're thinking of passing. And you will inevitably get knocked on your ass when you're skating with the puck if your head is down.  I still look at the puck sometimes, but just a quick glance to make sure it's there."
hockeyplayers,3805rc,creaturefear,3,Mon Jun 1 01:20:01 2015 UTC,If you're defense.  Clear the zone is your number one job.  Fancy passes out of the zone or skating it out come second. Have fun.
hockeyplayers,3805rc,eigenman,3,Mon Jun 1 01:33:26 2015 UTC,Off the glass out of the zone
hockeyplayers,3805rc,nhlgoalie20,2,Mon Jun 1 01:39:04 2015 UTC,Thanks for the feedback everybody!  We won 5-4. I had an assist and almost roofed a backhander right off the bat at the beginning of the game. Looking forward to how my season unfolds!
hockeyplayers,380joi,Awesomelord10,9,Sun May 31 23:25:40 2015 UTC,"Get out there without your stick and just skate. Really try to utilize our inner and outer edges (a lot of beginners just use their insides) and make sure that your knees are always bent!!!! I cannot stress this enough, when I started I saw my skating dramatically get better after I put in a little more knee bend.   But as for fluidity and general skating ability overall that takes time. Most of the people I play with have been playing for their entire lives and are quite a bit better at skating than I am, but the important thing is to not get discouraged. Get out there every chance you can and practice skating drills. Jeremy from /u/howtohockeydotcom has some amazing videos on Youtube and his website; they helped me exponentially and they've helped loads of others on this site too. I hope this wasn't too vague and that it helps a little bit!"
hockeyplayers,380joi,apbenoit,2,Mon Jun 1 00:02:29 2015 UTC,Second checking out Jeremy's videos
hockeyplayers,380joi,Firsmith,3,Mon Jun 1 04:50:51 2015 UTC,Have you ever seen yourself skate on video? I saw myself at a pretty young age and it was a HUGE eye opener for me- I'll never forget it. I started studying good skaters obsessively and drilling out my bad habits. It took time but now I genuinely consider myself a solid skater.
hockeyplayers,380joi,Private_Stock,1 point,Mon Jun 1 00:13:51 2015 UTC,I noticed this too! Not on video but when I saw myself in the glass I realized how little I was actually bending my knees. I could skate fast but still felt wobbly and never knew why until I saw that.
hockeyplayers,380joi,Lndbrghwrstlr,3,Mon Jun 1 13:29:04 2015 UTC,"Go to public skates and just skate. It's OK to look like that weirdo who is doing figure 8s, turns, crossovers, stops, mohawks, etc. Link them together too. Do things forwards and backwards. Transition between forwards and backwards.   If you can, consider signing up for a skate class or two. Even if it is with figure skaters, it will help you learn to skate and use edges.   Repetition is key."
hockeyplayers,380joi,spartanKid,3,Mon Jun 1 05:23:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah, public skates are a great way to focus specifically on your skating. I'd look up a few drills online and pick a spot on the ice and just work on them.  If you feel better in them, wear elbow and knee pads during the public skate. If you're trying to push your limits, you're going to fall so the added protection is worth it."
hockeyplayers,380joi,Vargatron,2,Mon Jun 1 12:07:42 2015 UTC,"Yup, it doesn't matter what your skill level is for that either. I was easily the best skater at the public session yesterday (not saying much considering it was all children) and I was still the most padded up. Wear em every time expecting to fall and if I don't I wasn't trying hard enough."

hockeyplayers,380joi,AviateAndNavigate,1 point,Mon Jun 1 01:47:53 2015 UTC,"Take a group drill class, if they are available in your area. Get out and skate. Ice skating takes time. You'll get really good at the easy stuff, but the challenging things will take longer.    Also, when you're practicing, force yourself to do things that make you feel uncomfortable. Most people are better at stopping on one edge than the other when first starting out(e.g. left foot first). I was. Force yourself to practice the other direction. Force yourself to do crossovers in the direction you feel less comfortable with. Start working on backwards cross-unders. I doubt you can do those yet; they take the longest, in my experience.   But don't be too hard on yourself. Sometimes it takes perseverance, but other times, you just really need a break."
hockeyplayers,380joi,Zuvielify,1 point,Mon Jun 1 06:09:53 2015 UTC,"Really focusing on my dexterity helped me when I was younger. Starting and stopping, back and forth as fast as I could helped me build speed and explosiveness. I focused getting as much out of each stride when I had built good enough speed."
hockeyplayers,380joi,treetraffick,1 point,Mon Jun 1 11:54:44 2015 UTC,"Biggest thing that helped me was actually playing games and pickup. When I started playing I forgot to be self conscious about skating and just did it. Also, that's how you figure out exactly what it takes to play, how tight you have to turn, speed, etc. Also, it takes a lot longer than a month to get good. It took me about a year of regularly skating, inline, and playing before I really felt comfortable."
hockeyplayers,380joi,orionthefisherman,1 point,Mon Jun 1 11:55:27 2015 UTC,When you see hockey players skating all smooth and effortlessly...it's generally because they've been doing it for years and years so it's become natural to them.  You can't just learn proper form and get a bunch of tips and then all of a sudden become as good as them.  It's one of those things that just take repetitive practice.
hockeyplayers,38181z,WrathfulNarwhal,6,Mon Jun 1 02:45:55 2015 UTC,"I'm not a nutritionist by any means, but I'm quite sure that if you want to have an optimal outcome, you need to revamp your whole diet, not just the gameday.  Changed mine completely (to a super casual version of paleo) and the improvement in power and stamina has been remarkable. I don't eat anything special or different on a gameday. Lost some extra weight too which is nice."
hockeyplayers,38181z,kroopster,2,Mon Jun 1 07:04:11 2015 UTC,"Another big piece that goes into the broader adjustment of diet is hydration. It's not as simple as just chugging a bunch of water in the hours before a game (in fact that probably could make you feel bloated and like you have to pee). Drinking water throughout the day, everyday, will improve hydration levels and performance.  For me - I try to do ritualize it. I have .5 L bottle, and I aim to have 3-4 of those at work each day, through out the day, and then 2-3 more when I get home.  NOTE: size does play a role in this, and I weigh 225 lbs so a smaller person might want less."
hockeyplayers,38181z,NapoleonBlownapart87,4,Mon Jun 1 15:46:05 2015 UTC,I eat different things before games but I always try to eat healthy and never within 3-4hrs of a game. Granted this doesn't happen every game but I do my best to stick to that. And s pregame poop is never a bad idea.
hockeyplayers,38181z,PizzaHockeyGolf,3,Mon Jun 1 03:05:52 2015 UTC,Pregame poop is almost always helpful for sure.
hockeyplayers,38181z,PizzaHockeyGolf,2,Mon Jun 1 03:11:52 2015 UTC,It's pretty much a must do before a game

hockeyplayers,38181z,JonnyBox,2,Mon Jun 1 04:19:11 2015 UTC,Sometimes I think that works! I had Taco Bell 30 minutes before a game once and and got a hat trick and 2 assists.

Personally, I either eat a big bowl of oatmeal or some pasta and meat no later than 2 hours before puck drop. If I eat anything closer to game time it's usually a small piece of fruit or candy, something with sugar in it.  I also hydrate to the point that my pee is just slightly tinted yellow."
hockeyplayers,38181z,Knobdy1,1 point,Mon Jun 1 03:08:47 2015 UTC,"I've tried a lot of different stuff to help, today it was a big plate of spaghetti and meatballs 3 hours before puck drop, but nothing afterwards. Last time it was a small amount of chicken and rice about an hour and a half before and neither worked. I only go into a game at 100% if I'm at a tournament really, and I can't see much difference in my eating when I'm there."

hockeyplayers,38181z,PCsuperiority,3,Mon Jun 1 03:59:54 2015 UTC,"Well then! How's your conditioning? It sounds more of a conditioning issue opposed to what food or how well you are hydrated.

hockeyplayers,38181z,throwmemars,1 point,Mon Jun 1 06:27:35 2015 UTC,"Dude before my lacrosse games I would carbo load on pancakes with very little sryup. A decent stack, nothing too crazy but maybe 3-5 good size pancakes (know your limit) and drink a shit ton of water the day/night before and the day of too. But I would always make sure to eat at least 4-5 hours before a game and then nothing from that point on. I cramp pretty easily too so I'll drink a lot of water the day of but probably nothing an hour or two hours before warm ups. I would also top off the pancakes with a banana.    Also, I just want to let you know about an unintended experince. I got my hands on some soylent and had it the day of a pick up game and drank it for breakfast. I also had a turkey sanwhich for lunch about 4-5 hours prior to my game and nothing else to eat that day. I felt fantastic. I don't know if it was the soylent or what but it felt grea.t the only issue is that I haven't  had anymore soylent to drink to see if it really helps or its all just in my head. Anyways, just want to point that out.    Either way, can't go wrong with carboloading, just make sure you give yourself enough of a gap to digest the food. EVeryone is different, I need at least four or five hours, some guys can eat and go play in an hour."
hockeyplayers,38181z,mootland,1 point,Tue Jun 2 01:45:03 2015 UTC,I usually have some fast food 1.5-2 hrs before game time
hockeyplayers,38181z,ranatalus,1 point,Mon Jun 1 14:50:46 2015 UTC,I eat the same thing I did before lacrosse chicken and pasta usually a light cream or white wine sauce on it and of course loads of water that day

hockeyplayers,38181z,Stisann,1 point,Mon Jun 1 04:50:02 2015 UTC,"I did ball hockey this last winter. Lucked out that most of my games were at 1pm on saturday afternoons so I ended up just sleeping in till 11, not eating and then going to play. Drank about half a liter - a liter of water about an hour before the game and just played hungry. For later games, nothing 2-4 hours before. If I did eat anything, it was something small and light like toast.   Gatorade is also nice to have. Just don't be a fool and guzzle it all down super fast. High intensity moving while bloated ain't fun either. I always have one of those containers of gatorade powder in my gym bag, just for those days when you feel your blood sugar is low or you need something sweet."

hockeyplayers,38181z,lernington,1 point,Mon Jun 1 04:56:12 2015 UTC,"Usually 2-3 hours before the game, high carb stuff and since I love my pasta, usually just pasta with different meats.

hockeyplayers,38181z,lernington,1 point,Mon Jun 1 08:18:12 2015 UTC,"I heavily carb load 4-5 hours before puck drop. When playing as a skater, it's a peanut butter, jelly, and banana sandwich + a glass of skim milk. Double that if I'm playing goal. I used to have issues with running out of gas halfway through the third but not anymore."
hockeyplayers,3801t6,lordyahyahyah,6,Sun May 31 21:10:31 2015 UTC,You could finish the wall and then put a shooting tarp up a foot or so in front of it. That way you can roil it up when you're not using it!
hockeyplayers,3801t6,Knobdy1,1 point,Sun May 31 21:26:38 2015 UTC,"That's what I'm thinking, just worried about taking out a light going bar up (like a boss)"
hockeyplayers,3801t6,Knobdy1,3,Mon Jun 1 14:21:39 2015 UTC,"Maybe throw some metal light cages over your lights for some added security?  I've been shooting in my garage for a while (against a concrete wall... rebounds are fun) and haven't broken any lights yet.  Holes in drywall...yeah, but don't tell my wife...."
hockeyplayers,3801t6,spartanKid,6,Mon Jun 1 15:02:57 2015 UTC,"Throw up a wall of old clothes dryers!   But seriously like other people have said, a tensioned tarp or canvas sheet or net a few feet away from the wall would probably do it."
hockeyplayers,3801t6,TwoMinuteMinor,5,Sun May 31 22:00:06 2015 UTC,"Just an engineering note: I don't think you would want the tarp or canvas to be under tension.  The tension would actually make it easier for a puck to go right through it. A tarp that is hanging loosely ""absorbs"" the energy of the puck/ball/projectile and spreads it out over a large area. That's why the recommendation is to have the tarp hanging a couple of feet in front of the wall it protects. It will give some with impact, but the weight of the fabric will keep it from going too far. The heavier the fabric, the less it will give."
hockeyplayers,3801t6,spartanKid,2,Mon Jun 1 13:51:26 2015 UTC,"The reason I suggested some tension (not a crazy amount) is to stop the bottom from flapping and allowing pucks to sneak through. Perhaps ""tension"" isn't the right word, but having some method of securing the tarp on all sides (with some give) would stop pucks trickling back to the wall on the sides/bottom when hanging it from the ceiling."
hockeyplayers,3801t6,TwoMinuteMinor,2,Mon Jun 1 15:03:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I see what you're saying.  I've been trying to come up with the best solution for this myself. In my case, the bottom 6"" of the wall in my garage is actually concrete, so I wasn't too worried about the bottom edge.  As long as there is some give to it, I think it would be fine. And now that I think more about it, as long as the material is substantially strong, it would be pretty hard to get a puck to puncture it. I imagine a thick canvas would be pretty effective. And I doubt I could shoot a slap shot through a moving blanket even if it were under tension.  Shooter-tutors are made of canvas, I think, and they use a bar along the bottom to stop the low shots. Not super effective for shots on the ice, but a heavier bar would improve that.  I'm glad I saw this thread. I need to get on this so my kids can practice shooting without destroying my house. This has motivated me to devise a solution now."
hockeyplayers,3801t6,Hurricane_Viking,2,Mon Jun 1 16:10:50 2015 UTC,"You could get a normal tarp, then fold the bottom few inches up and put a piece of PVC through the sleeve that is created. Get some small clamps on either side and then maybe make some small holes for a few zip ties through the middle. The pipe at the bottom can drag on the ground and hold the bottom in place, so no pucks get under it. It would be easy enough to move with a hard shot so nothing punctures the tarp."
hockeyplayers,3801t6,spartanKid,1 point,Mon Jun 1 19:39:15 2015 UTC,"Money being no obstacle, I imagine a Kevlar sheet or an old racing sail would be perfect."
hockeyplayers,3801t6,archaic_entity,2,Mon Jun 1 17:38:07 2015 UTC,"Seems like the simple solution would be to just have the tarp roll out to be about a foot or so longer than the height necessary and drop some weights to pin it to the ground.  Virtually no tension, but nothing will slide under since it'll get tangled in the tarp."
hockeyplayers,3801t6,DizneyDux,3,Tue Jun 2 18:47:09 2015 UTC,"I use a heavy moving blanket in my garage.  I hang it using big spring clamps, take it down when I'm done.  It easily absorbs shots with no rebound and even has a satisfying ""thwump"""
hockeyplayers,3801t6,stevegcook,2,Mon Jun 1 04:20:02 2015 UTC,"What do you want the finished wall to look like?  I mean, there are lots of things that can take slapshots, but many of them don't look super nice.  And metal is a bit crazy, I think you're underestimating how much you'd need for it to never dent - and how much it would weigh."

hockeyplayers,38136d,NYBurns,2,Mon Jun 1 02:03:54 2015 UTC,"If your feet are physically slow, trying doing grapevines, agility ladders, and jump ropes.  Edge work is also important, but you don't need ice to work on the above."
hockeyplayers,38136d,ArrogantOwl,1 point,Tue Jun 2 07:43:00 2015 UTC,"I think I get what you're saying. I've been working on these myself the last couple weeks and found that what was really screwing up me was my inside foot. Make sure you have all of your weight on it, evenly distributed and not too much forward or backward, and as you're crossing over make sure you are sliding it behind your front foot as well.   As for not turning sharply into the crossovers, just consciously be thinking about the direction your blades are facing as you're placing them down on the ice. Keep working at it, it'll come!"
hockeyplayers,38136d,Lndbrghwrstlr,1 point,Mon Jun 1 13:35:45 2015 UTC,Looks like it might be an outside edge issue. If that isn't strong (and most of the time it isn't) you won't get the inside push and your quick crossovers won't have the stability you need. Take a look at this video. I've been skating a while and still practice the outside edge turns frequently.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FN7q90TkeuE
hockeyplayers,37ytip,Bustcratch,7,Sun May 31 15:38:27 2015 UTC,"I've always wished that I had picked up figure skating when I was a kid.  I don't know how the commitments would balance out, but if he's already a skilled skater, he has a big leg up in hockey.  Figure skating does a great job teaching you to use your edges, and generally skate well and efficiently, if for completely different ends.  In figure skating, you're taught to skate aesthetically, which means minimizing unnecessary movements, and using your body weight to generate momentum.  This is especially valuable for defensive skating, as well as keeping your feet under you in tight spaces.  Not to mention that elaborate footwork is certainly present in figure skating, which translates to a laundry list of advantages in hockey.  If you can work both of them into his/your schedule, I'd certainly encourage it.  /u/howtohockeydotcom has a good article about the importance of cross training, which I'm a big believer in, and kind of relates to this.  http://howtohockey.com/why-you-should-play-sports-other-than-hockey  Edit: it should be noted that at first, he'll likely experience some tribulations transferring from figure skates to hockey skates, and back again.  The skates themselves are very different.  However, this is nothing more than an adjustment period, and once he has them both logged in his muscle memory bank, it shouldn't be an issue."
hockeyplayers,37ytip,lernington,3,Sun May 31 16:00:11 2015 UTC,Also I find skating in hockey is more about explosiveness and power. Figure skating is more symmetry and grace
hockeyplayers,37ytip,howtohockeydotcom,2,Sun May 31 16:58:32 2015 UTC,Totally.  I figure having the foundation of symmetry and grace (which basically boils down to stability) will make it that much easier to develop the explosiveness and power.
hockeyplayers,37ytip,lernington,3,Sun May 31 17:30:16 2015 UTC,"true, one caveat though is it seems hockey players get much lower knee bend, just something to be aware of. any time on the ice should help"
hockeyplayers,37ytip,howtohockeydotcom,1 point,Sun May 31 21:23:18 2015 UTC,"true, and furthermore, I'd assert that that's an area where hockey could help him with his figure skating.  If he becomes accustomed to absorbing impact in his legs, it could be the difference between salvaging a bad landing and eating shit."

hockeyplayers,37ytip,JonnyBox,2,Sun May 31 16:24:51 2015 UTC,"He'll be a good skater. Get him a green biscuit, and pass and stick handle the puck with him for 5-10 minutes before games. Start him out in a house league if you are worried about him. At that level being able to skate makes you a good player. And he won't be the only player figuring out off sides and when to pass the puck.   Has he ever skated in hockey skates? Because it its a bit different. But a lot of the figure skating will transfer over."

That being said, he might get a hard time from some of the boys. When I was growing up we would rip on anybody for anything.

hockeyplayers,3800qe,yacadelic,1 point,Sun May 31 21:38:41 2015 UTC,"Pretty much every hockey retailer will stock some sticks from a year or two ago, but any longer than that and most become very hard to find. Even the bauer apx2 sticks, which have only been obsolete for a few months now are almost sold out everywhere I've seen because it was a popular stick. Usually when a new stick is released, the older version will go on sale everywhere, and depending on how popular it is their numbers will gradually decline until they become virtually impossible to find. (Good examples would be an Easton stealth S19, or a ccm rbz stage 2)"
hockeyplayers,37y9kd,DicNavis,7,Sun May 31 12:21:24 2015 UTC,I think you figured out your own question. You are using a 90 flex and its too stiff. You should go with a lighter flex. I wouldn't automatically just to a 75 flex from 90 but try 80 or 85 and go from there. If you want to learn about flexes check out my website
hockeyplayers,37y9kd,kingofthediamond,2,Sun May 31 13:29:01 2015 UTC,"Awesome write-up!  Thank you.  I think the fact that I've been switching between wing and defense complicates it, but I will probably look to go back down to 80-87... I've never used lower than an 87."

hockeyplayers,37y9kd,JRBK,2,Sun May 31 14:48:42 2015 UTC,"Finding the perfect stick is tricky. I know you said you've been playing for ~18 months, so some of this may already be in your brain bank, and some people may have different opinions, but here goes.   Stuff you may want to look at to help you determine what the best stick is for you:  Stick Flex Flex Point (Kick Point) Stick Lie Curve  I won't go over stick flex, that's gotta be pretty much common knowledge for all who visit this sub, I'm sure.  Now, flex points:  https://www.bauer.com/player-ice-hockey-sticks  The link above shows the three Bauer flex points. You need to find the right combination of hand position and shooting technique (flex point) and shooting strength (stick flex) to get the best results out of your twig.   I didn't even know about stick lie until I started playing high-school hockey. A low stick lie is for players who skate in a deep crouch and/or who like to skate with the puck far away from their bodies. A high lie is for the guys who keep the puck close to them and/or skate with very little knee bend.   I won't dive into curves much. Again, pretty common knowledge for all hockey players. But I will say it makes sense to look at yourself and the type of game you play and pick something that you think lines up with you as a player.  There's a perfect stick for everyone out there, and you'll find yours."
hockeyplayers,37y9kd,JRBK,1 point,Sun May 31 13:20:37 2015 UTC,Is there any tricks to finding the right kick point other than just trying them out?
hockeyplayers,37y9kd,kingofthediamond,1 point,Sun May 31 13:43:11 2015 UTC,Nothing that I really know about or swear by. Hand positioning should give you a general idea though. Someone out there may have a better resource.
hockeyplayers,37y9kd,avanross,1 point,Sun May 31 13:48:51 2015 UTC,there are basically only 2. and its all about how you shoot
hockeyplayers,37y9kd,Gamite,2,Sun May 31 13:53:18 2015 UTC,"Typically, a stiffer stick will help with slapshot power and accuracy, one timers, wristshot and snapshot accuracy, receiving hard passes and quicker stick handling. A lighter flex will help with pop and power on snapshots. So look into which areas you're specifically trying to improve and go from there."
hockeyplayers,37y9kd,creaturefear,1 point,Sun May 31 23:07:34 2015 UTC,"I would think at your size you should adequately be able to flex a 90.  a lot of your shot has to do with technique.  It might be helpful to take a video and have some of the guys here analyze your shot.  Trying different sticks and flex points can help determine what kinda stick you like, but it can be costly, I started out buying used sticks on kijiji to figure out what I liked."
hockeyplayers,37y9kd,creaturefear,1 point,Sun May 31 16:58:04 2015 UTC,"Could be it... I feel fine in warmups but in games where I have less time, I'm getting nothing but muffins."
hockeyplayers,37y9kd,Btrash,1 point,Sun May 31 17:08:27 2015 UTC,"One thing that helps me take harder shots when I'm playing in my league (as opposed to shooting in warm-ups or pickup hockey) is remembering to put my weight into the shot. As you said, when you have less time to prepare for a shot, you don't necessarily get off the best shot you possibly can.   I try to remember to transfer my weight down and forward when I'm shooting. You don't want to be shooting off-balance (if you can avoid it), so I (often) try to shoot mid-stride while skating. This helps because I'm already in the process of transferring weight down and forward by taking a stride, and it can also catch the goalie off guard, as he might be expecting you to ""set up"" to shoot. Having a quick release mid-stride can make for some really hard shots, if you time it properly. You just have to develop a feel for it."
hockeyplayers,37y9kd,creaturefear,1 point,Sun May 31 20:16:14 2015 UTC,"I'm 6'1'', 200ish, and I use a Warrior stick with an 85 flex. I've also used Bauers that had an 87 flex. Keep in mind that if you cut your stick, that increases the flex. So if you're buying a 90 flex and cutting it, it might be more like a 95 flex, or even stiffer.  Either way, I'd try out different flexes and see what works. My buddy is about the same size as me (maybe an inch taller), and refuses to use anything except for a 100 flex. So it's really all about your preferences and what feels right."
hockeyplayers,37y9kd,Squrmander123,1 point,Sun May 31 20:08:01 2015 UTC,Cutting decreases the flex (higher number = lower flex)

hockeyplayers,37wjtd,Firsmith,3,Sun May 31 15:12:12 2015 UTC,"There are different types of curves for different puck areas while shooting. Toe curves will want the puck up on the toe to get the easy lift in close and quickly.

Try out different things."
hockeyplayers,37wjtd,conrad_bastard,2,Sun May 31 02:22:09 2015 UTC,"Depending on your skill level you can shoot from anywhere. Generally the further on the toe the more power and speed. For me, I like to take slapshots off the heel, wristers off the middle and snap shots off the toe"

hockeyplayers,37xbrr,shining_,2,Sun May 31 04:43:41 2015 UTC,"just keep doing it, the form of shooting will help you when you get to be a better skater and can balance on your edges better and throw your weight around without any instability. just make sure your working on lots of different shots, stick handling and remember it takes time."

I've been trying to get about 4 or 5 pucks at the rink and just practicing stationary shot at the boards while I'm on ice. I think one of the hardest things for me in terms of weight transfer is getting used to the feel of the skates biting as opposed to being on solid ground.  How are you pointing your lead foot when you shoot? From what I've seen, you should try and push forward and angle your front skate toward the net so that your energy goes toward it."

hockeyplayers,37whoe,spartanKid,2,Sun May 31 02:48:13 2015 UTC,"A trick I learned is to curl your toes. Tighten them up tight and keep going through the entire skate.  Your heel will be locked in firmly, and with your toes curled, it will leave enough room in the forefoot where it isn't too tight, but still enough.  Honestly, the last 5 eyelets or so should be quite tight to lock that heel in, the rest of them can be snug or loose depending on how you like it."

Yes, a lot of new players buy skates that are too big and/or don't tie them tight enough. So their ankles wobble from left to right. That's bad. You only need a little.  But you want to be able to move your foot up and down, to point your toe. That's where you get some of the power out of your stride.  I wear Vapors with waxed laces. I leave the bottom few laces around the toe loose. The ones in the middle around my foot are tighter, probably too tight as I like that part firmly attached. I don't use the very top eyelet but the next 3 down are as tight as I can get them."

hockeyplayers,37vpkd,iRageWin,6,Sat May 30 20:33:00 2015 UTC,In my experience the pucks at stick and puck get pretty mixed up. I leave with the same number I came with (usually one) but its never the same puck(s).
hockeyplayers,37vpkd,The_Loud_Guy,1 point,Sat May 30 20:30:19 2015 UTC,"Taking a pass from behind is very difficult for a few reasons: you can't skate full speed while looking back, so you are kind of hoping to look at the right moment , the puck has to be gong faster than you and you must slow it down enough but not too much to skate with it.  Way easier is to break out on an angle and get the pass (at least partially from the side).  As to pucks, where I play, the standard rule is leave with the same number you arrive with and ignore which are ""yours"".  I guess you could spray paint the whole puck."
hockeyplayers,37vpkd,somewhat_random,1 point,Sat May 30 21:08:57 2015 UTC,"No idea what to do with the puck-losing situation, but for receiving passes I have two things:   Get used to having your hands farther away from your body. I'm having a hard time thinking about how to explain this via text without using my super gesticulations but if you can get used to it you'll have way more mobility with your stick. Learn mohawk turns/open your hips up.

hockeyplayers,37vur4,avanross,3,Sat May 30 21:08:26 2015 UTC,"The foam in a one piece stick usually goes decently high up into the shaft. Typically when turning a one piece into a two piece you're going to lose a few inches of length from the stick, so you'll likely need a new extension.  I'd say purchase the new blade (make sure it's tapered if your stick is tapered, or vice versa) and just cut the blade off your current stick, see if the blade will fit (you'll kinda have to estimate because the new blade will have glue on the top) and if it won't fit, cut another inch or so off the shaft and try again, and so on."

Like was already mentioned, your best bet would be to contact all the different hockey schools/academies in the GTA that offer classes and see if they'll let you step into the oldest age bracket they offer.    NTR might accept you/her, and they do offer some adult classes.  You could also try just calling all the arenas nearby ( There are a lot in the GTA) and asking what camps/classes are run out of them.  I know the Canlan rinks have a good amount of classes run out of them.   Also, while it's great to really step up your game, going from C/D to A league doesn't seem that realistic.  I don't know what leagues you're using as a benchmark, but A division players in pretty much all Southern Ontario leagues are former pros or semi-pros.  Elevating ones game from C/D (high school) to semi-pro in half a year seems overly ambitious.  But regardless, good luck and hope she finds something.

hockeyplayers,37u6bw,trk1985,1 point,Sat May 30 12:48:31 2015 UTC,You mean you just slid it on without tape and it holds fine? Or you used a different tape to keep it in place?
hockeyplayers,37u6bw,spartanKid,2,Sat May 30 13:01:17 2015 UTC,"You can use hairspray instead of the tape.  If you're REALLY patient and slow, you can reuse the tape. If you really soak the tape as you roll off the old one, the tape might be in decent condition if you take it slow.  Then take an exacto knife or scalpel like knife and slice the tape along the length of the stick so you can reverse the the way you originally stuck it on there.

hockeyplayers,37u6bw,absoludicrous,1 point,Sat May 30 17:23:17 2015 UTC,I use aquanet hairspray. I get the mega hold or whatever and it's super cheap. I spray on a little and give it a little time to get tacky and then roll it on. Just make sure it dries well because I've had it fly off in a game once.   I used to reuse hairspray all the time but the tape holds well and is more convenient to apply. I couldn't find any at my local shop so I had to take out the hair spray again last week. I added some tape at the bottom of the grip in case it decides to fly off again.
hockeyplayers,37u6bw,steved1987,3,Sat May 30 17:47:23 2015 UTC,I just use my tape and do the same thing. I pull out about a foot of tape and spin it so it gets tight in a small string like and wrap it after I make the knob on top. Then I just tape over it

He said some of the bauer skates he's see had it so bar that he had to pull out the rivets on the holder and readjust it. Is that something to look out for?

For the warping issue, I had the same issue with my MX3s when I first got them, and yep, took some rivets out and re-aligned the holder.  It's definitely worth looking over your skates for alignment when you first get them, because sometimes manufacturing defects do happen.  As for thin steel, I've never come across it on any modern skate.  Micron did it for a while, but that was pretty much it as far as I'm aware.  All other player steel should be 3mm thick, and goalie is generally 4mm, with 3 starting to gain popularity as well, primarily on Bauer's high end skates."

The stick reviews aren't really reviews so much as advertisements (I don't really mind ads as long as they're upfront about what they are), and a lot of the other posts (eg. NHL ticket prices or stanley cup predictions) would be better suited to /r/hockey.   I think /r/hockeyplayers is best looked at as a community that exists for content/discussion relating to its own members playing hockey, and those kinds of posts don't really do that."

But it's up on their website, about a product they're selling, and it's just.. bad feeling.  I don't like it.  And the ticket prices?  Why do we care in this sub?  That should be for /r/hockey.

hockeyplayers,37re8r,bigvinnysd,1 point,Fri May 29 21:34:12 2015 UTC,Bingo. If you are more than 200 lbs go with the 180. If you play at a decent level definitely go with the 180

I would say that the extra money you spend now will last you longer, but to be fair not too long ago that tech mesh was top end material, the composite boot is a relatively new thing. I just picked up a pair of APX2s because I needed the full composite as a bigger guy. The extra money now should translate to extra use out of the skate   You're also getting a slightly different tongue on the 180 three piece instead of two piece but both are 48 oz felt and a slightly lighter skate in the 180  My opinion of skates is buy what is most comfortable but also spend the money if you can, by rights the step up from techmesh to curv composite should be worth it in the end"

Basically they make PP ""tape-thread,"" mix it with a second, softer type of PP, weave it into sheets, and heat-press the sheets together in a boot mold to make the quarter package."
hockeyplayers,37re8r,stevegcook,1 point,Sat May 30 03:01:18 2015 UTC,"I always just assumed it was Carbon, mainly because of the footbed being a full carbon composite piece on my skates.

And here's a video of the same material being used in Samsonite suitcases.  Bauer's high end outsoles have generally been carbon, but I noticed on the 1X insole they've switched to what appears to be a variant of Curv as well.  Carbon actually can be heat molded if you use the right resin when forming it. A good example of this is Graf's G9035 skate, which has a quarter package made of a single slab of carbon fibre on each side of the foot, yet has excellent heat moldability - so much so, that you can actually heat it up and then squeeze the heel area inwards with your fingers before stepping into it, and then let your foot push it back out and have it cool down wherever it stops."

Like some kind of strange wannabe dominance thing.  You should see if the rink has any rules regarding attendance and scrimmaging.

hockeyplayers,37omx5,karkelo99,1 point,Fri May 29 17:26:09 2015 UTC,I'd complain but I'd complain about the lesson part. I am honestly laid back when it comes to pick up games and such at stick and puck because mostly people are pretty respectful if you don't want to play you get 2/3 the ice to shoot around and they skirmish on the other end.   I do hate when rinks allow teams to take over half the ice for a practice. Allocate some time for your teams this is bad ice time management. The I'm stuck in center ice if I don't want to play pickup or if the abundance of kids etc turned me off playing a game with them. I paid the same amount why should I be confined to a little corner?

I now realize how much speed I was missing out on before that was just being lost into the ice.  Especially during the summer when the ice is so warm and soft to begin with.  This is a pretty big jump from 9/16"" though, so maybe try easing into it by doing 5/8, 3/4, 7/8 to get there.     Also as someone who sharpens skates, I'm not a big fan of x/16"" cuts, because it's a bit harder to make them consistent.  Most sharpening machines have notches at every eighth of an inch, and going in between them requires a bit of guesswork."

It's odd because I skate at 2 different rinks and one of the rinks has glass windows which causes softer ice and the other rink is super hard. So i'm looking for a good middle ground.

I'm thinking about going back down to 5/8"" to see if I get more bite; moving up to 3/4"" definitely helped me learn to stop. The ice where I skate is typically on the softer side, so I may just stay at 3/4"" if I'm going to lose a bunch of glide.

Also worth mentioning, you need a good sharpening guy to use shallower hollows, because they're easier to fuck up.

I play on tennis court, and the biscuit is ok for standing still and puck handing, but to handle it while skating is weird because your always just carrying it - too much drag to be like ice.  I usually use a wooden ball - it rolls the best and allows me to play most like ice.  And do you have any specific drills that you do?  I would actually like to take somewhat of a gym approach - so I have a goal rather than just go and practice.  For example I know im gonna take 60-100 shots from my shooting pad with real pucks, and I can also do 10 sets of xxxx.  idk I just mess around when I go out there and would like to get organized about how I train."

If I havent played on ice in a while, I hate playing on fresh ice because its too fast - no drag at all.  Once it gets chopped up it makes it easier to puck handle for me.  It should probably be the other way around, but my muscle memory is so set on handling balls (lol) that ice screws me up unless I only play on ice for a while and stop playing roller.  :("
hockeyplayers,37nb35,trk1985,3,Fri May 29 00:38:21 2015 UTC,"A solution to the little drag or the green biscuit could be something like a verbero roller hockey puck. They have little resistance so they slide very well, but they might roll more because they're a one piece puck. However, gear can't fix everything. When you're off ice, keep in mind to apply more force to your dekes so the puck slides more. When you return to the ice, remind yourself that you can ease up."

hockeyplayers,37obf3,modtrax,3,Fri May 29 02:53:32 2015 UTC,"I'd say get a 70 flex but you aren't too tall, so you could buy intermediates and even a 65 flex might suit you.  Go to a store and try out every companies flexes in that range. Each company has a different idea what ""75 flex"" is. You want the stick to bend with ease using your upper body. I see alot of what I call ""dudes"" show up at a Hockey shop and they basically lean on the stick to make it flex. Don't make that mistake, it is not the right flex for you.  If you have to cut it down it's going to add flex. This is why I'm highly suggesting a lower flex so much. Don't feel like a wimp for using a low flex, and do not worry about breaking your stick at the shaft, trust me.  I also agree with the commenter who said it's good to have a whippy stick because you will learn how the stick feels when it ""pops"" and you are taking a proper shot as a result."
hockeyplayers,37obf3,Tavisss,2,Fri May 29 04:26:53 2015 UTC,"I use a 55 flex intermediate warrior at 5' 7"". I had to cut down probably 6 inches though? I use a shorter stick and the stick was pretty long for an intermediate.  I think for a beginner, a whippier stick may be better. For learning a slapshot, I think it's easier to find the ""feel"" the stick bend with a whippy stick.  Also, unless you're like 250lbs at 5'7"", you probably won't break the shaft of your stick for the first year. However, the blade may break, but that's for every stick."
hockeyplayers,37obf3,shotgoto,1 point,Fri May 29 04:23:16 2015 UTC,"75 sounds fine. But at your height, you may want to get an intermediate since you'll have to cut off several inches.

hockeyplayers,37obf3,ethan_prime,1 point,Fri May 29 02:59:23 2015 UTC,"75 flex should work, however if you're 5'7"" you will most likely want to take a few inches off the stick which would end up making it feel like an 80 flex.

hockeyplayers,37obf3,Tavisss,1 point,Fri May 29 03:09:26 2015 UTC,a 75 senior is going to start feeling pretty stiff. Even moreso once you cut it. I'd consider a 75 flex maybe in a year when you have wrist shots down.

hockeyplayers,37obf3,kingofthediamond,1 point,Fri May 29 04:13:09 2015 UTC,"75 flex is fine. like many people have already said, just because it is a lower flex doesn't mean it will snap. You can go well under your preferred rating and still not snap the stick. Thats the beauty of composites. Since you are only 5'7 you may be able to get away with an intermediate. Generally the shafts are the same (sometimes thinner) but you can get a 65 or 70 flex which will give you the right amount of flex for you and you wont need to cut it. The 75 flex may end up around 80-85 when you cut it.   Go to the LHS give the sticks a good flex. make sure you do it in your hockey stance or the stick may feel stiffer. Try choking up on the stick if you plan to cut it.   I think you would be fine with the 75 flex."

But when I switch back to my easton in the same day, I feel more power and control with it. So I would say start of with an 85 flex just to kind of get stronger and help you really whip the wristers and get that top shelf"
hockeyplayers,37obf3,Skyline_BNR34,1 point,Fri May 29 15:14:25 2015 UTC,"As a new player, you're better off starting with something lower in flex so you can get used to how a stick bends on shots.  When your technique is bad, which it will be in the beginning, a stiffer flex stick will only hurt you more. You'll be trying too hard to flex a stick you can't flex yet because the technique is wrong and you're not trained to do it yet."

hockeyplayers,37obf3,Zinc68,1 point,Sat May 30 23:42:57 2015 UTC,"One thing that is missed in the discussion is that if you go with a Sr 75 flex stick with a low/very low kick point you can chop quite a bit off the stick before the flex changes at all, so that may be a moot point depending on how short you like your sticks."

And all companies use basically the same curves (some a little different) they are all under different names so the Kane curve is the same as the Perron curve. Every now and then Bauer and other companies will release new curves but curves like the P92 (Ovechkin) have been around forever, just under different names (Sakic). The pros grew up with these and would modify them once they became pro and they all use different curves and lies. I do believe that they tend to name curves after players who use similar curves (Kane for example) but the Crosby curve P87 is the same as the Ovechkin yet Crosby uses a almost straight curve similar to the Stamkos PM9. Most recently Ovechkin had a curve labeled P08 which is very similar to his but they dumped that curve and replaced it with a new one (P28 Giroux) and labelled the P92 as Ovechkin after Backstrom left to Warrior. So no, usually curves are labelled after the most popular players under contract for that company and pros all use different modified curves. Hope this answered your question!"

hockeyplayers,37lxzw,spartanKid,1 point,Thu May 28 16:55:44 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily. Some guys like weird curves that would be unmarketable. For example Crosby uses (used?) a nearly flat blade but ""his"" curve on the shelf was a pretty standard one.   Usually the curve will be somewhat suitable to the kind of game the sponsored player plays. Forwards do tend to have more kick, steeper angles (the lie of the blade is the correct term, I think?), and defencemen tend to have flatter blades, but it's not necessarily true in all cases. You can't really look at a stick and say ""that's a D stick"" but there are some common elements.   I've also heard of various curves being renamed once the guy retires. One curve -maybe the Shanahan? - was very popular and got rebranded (Datsyuk?) when he retired."
hockeyplayers,37lxzw,Tavisss,1 point,Thu May 28 18:39:42 2015 UTC,"Shanahan was Easton p10, Datsyuk is CCM/Reebok P40...they've both got square ends and are sort of mid, but the P10 is a lot longer and has a different profile."
hockeyplayers,37lxzw,Fireonahill,1 point,Thu May 28 20:39:42 2015 UTC,Crosby made the curve on his stick a bit deeper. It's not as flat as it used to be iirc. Basically when he started to become more of a goalscorer a few years back is when he made the switch from his flatblade to a deeper curve.  This is how I know the story. I could be wrong.

hockeyplayers,37kvdp,nolovedeepmeta,11,Thu May 28 11:04:11 2015 UTC,"I play in a 3v3 league too. Strategy is kind of simple, if only because there's so much randomness and such small ice that there's not much point in trying to set things up perfectly. The gist of it is that there's such little room for error that you want to force them to get sloppy for a second and be prepared to punish them when they do. Similarly on defense you need to recognize there's no such thing as a player who isn't a threat no matter where on the ice you are and even who has the puck.  Defensive coverage in your end is man to man. Yell SWITCH or COVER THE POINT or whatever if you think you're better off switching coverage. Never leave your guy alone, because even if he's in the corner and the puck is at the far point he's still one stride and a quick pass away from a backdoor play. Similarly never let go of your guy at the point. People glide by as the point lets a shot go or something and the next thing you know the forwards give it back to him and he's in the high slot. Zone coverage is pointless because if you aren't on your guy he will get the puck and he will be in a good place to score within 2 strides.  Offensive zone strategy is, not surprisingly, basically trying to break the man to man coverage. Lots of cycling along the boards, lots of passing to whoever's open before you get into trouble, and as soon as you have more than one guy on you that's a scoring chance if you can find the open guy. The defenseman at the point has to move around a lot, not just stay on the safe far side. Make the guy covering you work for it and they'll tire before you do, and as soon as their coverage breaks down you can set up cross-ice passes or have the D step up into the high slot. Goals basically happen on odd-man rushes, when coverage breaks down and a guy walks in alone or gets a pass for the backdoor play.  There are a few miscellaneous points that people find hard to adjust to. These will be a little disorganized but they're critical:    back checking is even more important than 5 on 5. A 2 on 1 is worse than a 3 on 2. You're going to get tired in the offensive zone, suck it up and make sure at least one guy back checks hard because you're never more than about 5 seconds from a chance against your own net.  there isn't much point having a set breakout system, but typically if your forwards aren't too far up ice either one of them will be free or the defenseman can rush it. If your forwards aren't too far and they still aren't free but you still can't rush the puck, it means their D is pinching and one of your forwards should take off for a breakaway pass. Feel free to bank it off the boards into open ice if you really have nothing, but make sure you're putting the puck somewhere your forwards can win the footrace.  you're always in a good place to shoot. Seriously, the ice is so small that sometimes you'll be at the blue line and not realize you're basically in the high slot on full-sized ice. Rip it if you have nothing. Practically every goal I've scored this year (as a defenseman) has been a result of rushing it until I have nowhere to go and picking a corner through the defenseman's legs.  keep in mind how short the amount of time between a chance one way and a chance at the other net is. You don't have time to admire your shot if their goalie isn't freezing it. Miss the net on the far side from a bad angle and you basically just gave them a breakaway pass because it's going to wrap around the boards and be waiting for their winger. Forecheck too hard and get sidestepped by their defenseman behind his net and it's a dangerous 3 on 2 in 5 seconds. Stop and start, don't take a wide gliding scenic route when you need to change directions. You simply don't have time to get caught with your pants down. Things you can get away with on full sized ice turn into odd-man rushes before you can get back into it."

hockeyplayers,37mjf4,kr580,2,Thu May 28 19:06:07 2015 UTC,"Does your washing machine have the agitator tower in the center of the tub? If so, I'd not use that. I've heard the agitator can cause damage.  I just fill my tub half way with water, add regular laundry detergent, throw gear in and slosh it around for 5 minutes. After the water is thoroughly brown you can drain the tub and then do a rinse with running water. Do it on a warm day so you can hang or lay out your gear in the sun for a quick dry time."

hockeyplayers,37mjf4,kimchee411,1 point,Thu May 28 19:06:07 2015 UTC,I've been using a laundrymat machine that has that tower in the center and can attest that you do see some wear and tear... but would say thats for washing machines in general. Just gotta decide if it's worth it. My laziness wins.
hockeyplayers,37mjf4,kr580,1 point,Thu May 28 19:33:15 2015 UTC,"When you say you use your tub, do you mean your bath tub or the tub of the washing machine?  I too have a top loading washer and just fill it up and stop it to hand wash/soak with laundry detergent as you described.  Then turn the knob to the spin cycle to drain and spin dry.  Fill up again with clean water and slosh the gear around to rinse, and put it on the spin cycle again.  I also have an ""air dry"" setting on my dryer that uses no heat.  One or two cycles with that helps a lot with drying in addition to the spinning in the washer.  I've washed my skates too and it works well.  I figured all your hockey gear gets when everytime you play so why would washing ruin it?  Of course with the skates I don't put them in the dryer.  I hang them on doorknobs upside down by the blade holders (lever type doorknobs, not round ones).  Also, unlace the skates before washing and throw them in the wash as well."
hockeyplayers,37mjf4,stevetehpirate,1 point,Fri May 29 00:20:16 2015 UTC,"Bathtub. I don't wash my skates as adding water will make the rivets rust out that much faster.  As for drying, I have a drying rack I use with two 20"" floor fans that dry the gear out in an hour in the sun, two out of the sun.   I use my drying rack after every skate so my gear doesn't really get funky."
hockeyplayers,37mjf4,Psychotic_Ninja,1 point,Fri May 29 00:32:00 2015 UTC,"After every skate I prop my skates in front of the fan, and every time I go in full gear I do a disinfectant spray down (febreze sport, supposedly safe for gear). Then dry.  This process means I do the full soak less often, and overall less wear, tear, and funk in my gear."

To wash your gloves, I would say run them under water in the bath tub with some soap that isn't too aggressive. Baking powder also helps kill the stench."

hockeyplayers,37m2eh,frosty_biscuits,1 point,Sat Jun 6 00:34:28 2015 UTC,"I haven't but I'm sure you could. Certainly if it props your heel up higher it'll change the fit a little, but mine are fine."

But otherwise, most people do just fine with cheapy factory insole that comes with the skate. I personally use an old cheap insole from an old bauer skate that just feels good. On my last new pair of skate the factory insole was annoying my underfoot (kinda cramping it). The old bauer insole worked like a charm."
hockeyplayers,37m2eh,OzziePao13,2,Thu May 28 18:11:42 2015 UTC,"I've found the Elite Hockey ones to be the best for me. They are 19.99, which puts them at a lower price point than Superfeet, Shock Doctor, or CCM.  They aren't as ""squishy"" as I've found the Superfeet to be. They aren't as rigid, or drastic a change to your foot as the Shock Doctors or CCM. I totally get that some people need that, and that's why they need upgraded insoles. However, the Elites are a huge improvement over the stock footbeds in almost all retail skates. I really like the product a lot. Good quality too. I've had them in each pair of my skates for over a year(I play 2-3 games a week year round), and see no real signs of wear."
hockeyplayers,37m2eh,stevegcook,1 point,Fri May 29 03:47:45 2015 UTC,"With superfeet, have you tried moving up a size and trimming down the toe more?   That's what I did and it was wY more comfortable on my arches."

hockeyplayers,37m2eh,Fireonahill,2,Thu May 28 19:10:37 2015 UTC,superfeet aren't an arch support. you need to fit them using the heel cup.
hockeyplayers,37m2eh,VSK85,1 point,Sat May 30 20:07:18 2015 UTC,"Ok, I'll try and say it a different way.  The area that tapers up to fit under your arch doesn't line up with my arch.  It's putting pressure on an area that it shouldn't."

The heat gear heatgear shirt actually does a good job wicking the moisture away. I always thought that stuff was just marketing hype, but it seems to work. After I sweat for a while and the pads get soaked and it doesn't work as well. The liner on the pad just absorbs the moisture and holds it against my skin."

hockeyplayers,37ii0y,ProdigyHockey,4,Wed May 27 21:49:29 2015 UTC,"Didn't even know this existed, but now I'm using it:   HOMEWORK: Go to the http://video.nhl.com/videocenter/ and pick a player, watch 20 of their goals, take notes on how they score.   Watching Parise, all he does is either bury it from the crease or find the soft spots between the tops of the circles, get a good shot, and crash the net for rebounds."
hockeyplayers,37ii0y,Jeembo,3,Wed May 27 23:23:37 2015 UTC,Parise is a great guy to watch. He'll have a few pretty goals here and there but for the most part he grinds it out and gets to spots around the crease like you mentioned.
hockeyplayers,37ii0y,Jeembo,2,Wed May 27 23:36:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah, as a newer player, I feel like it's best to watch a guy who doesn't necessarily do anything fancy - just gets to the right places and buries the puck.  It's amazing how efficient he is at getting to those soft spots."

I made the mistake of only skating for a few weeks before playing. I always feel like I am missing some crucial. I'm fairly new myself (2 months of playing) so I'm still learning the basics, but if you learn how to skate really well before you play, you'll have a great advantage."

hockeyplayers,37jka4,sterlingarcher0069,3,Thu May 28 06:56:05 2015 UTC,"Indeed, everything else will fall into place in their own time but skating is the foundation block for it all, you should never quit skating practices."
hockeyplayers,37jka4,mootland,3,Thu May 28 08:19:53 2015 UTC,"You still pick up some stuff from actually playing though. I went into my league only being able to stop on one side and came out of it with a little bit of backwards skating skills, crossovers, tight turns, and a hard stop. So I wouldn't say hold off on joining a league or anything necessarily, but make sure you're putting the time in outside of the league to still learn the basics, like stopping on your weak side."
hockeyplayers,37jka4,Lndbrghwrstlr,2,Thu May 28 13:30:27 2015 UTC,"That's the plan. Obviously I don't know how well it's going to go yet, but I'm thinking I'll take a few skating classes to build a foundation this summer, then see how I'm feeling come actual hockey time this fall."
hockeyplayers,37jka4,themaincop,2,Thu May 28 13:49:45 2015 UTC,"If you can find a learn to play class that might be your best bet.  Any good class will have a huge focus on skating but also develop some other skills.  There's quite a few people in my beginner league who are pretty decent skaters but can't stickhandle, pass, lift the puck, etc.  You want to develop all your skills, and ideally in a way that you can use them all at once.  Get on the ice as often as possible, get some at-home stickhandling practice gear, go out to stick & puck/drop-in hockey as soon as you're stable on your skates.  If you put the work in you can be a decent player in a beginner league pretty quickly."

Don't know where you are, but in the US northeast that's a pretty average age for getting started. Also, it's popular enough that there are always lots of beginners leagues all year round. I got started a little over a year ago, same situation, same age - learn to skate & hockey at the same time - and pretty much just threw myself into pickup games, before switching into a league team. I took a few single day lessons on basics, but haven't had time to take a full season of lessons.   Long story short: go for it! It's gonna be fun. Just get ice time however much you can!"

hockeyplayers,37jka4,ibanez-guy,3,Fri May 29 11:33:55 2015 UTC,My advise is to learn positioning. Pick a position you want to play and learn the basics of where you should be in certain situations on the ice. You're going to suck at skating and puck handling for a while but that will come the more you play. I've played my whole life but my good friend just started 2 years ago at age 22. He could barley skate at first but he knew the game well from watching nhl games and I think that helped out a lot. If you're in position you will get the puck more often and have the chance to make plays and get more comfortable handling the puck.   Also don't be afraid to play with people who have been playing their entire lives. Most people want to set up the kid who's just starting out and it can really help you with learning the game to play with more experienced players.  But at the same time it would also benefit you to join a league based on skill level. This way you would most likely have more time with the puck on your stick.  If you stick with it you'd be surprised how fast you can improve. My buddy is on his 3rd summer and it almost looks like he's been playing for years. People that don't know him are very surprised when he tells them he just started
hockeyplayers,37jka4,Marquette429,1 point,Thu May 28 03:02:21 2015 UTC,"Thanks, RP. I think the fear of playing with people who have been playing a long time is something I'll have to get over, but obviously that should be okay.  Any advice on learning positioning? I don't even know where to start in terms of picking a position. Obviously I watch hockey, but that's about the extent of it. Would it help to just watch lots of games and look at how certain positions move in each one?"
hockeyplayers,37jka4,NitroDevo,2,Thu May 28 13:51:08 2015 UTC,When you're watching games pick a player and watch them rather than watching the puck.  howtohockey.com has a few good videos and articles about different positions and their responsibilities during different on-ice situations.
hockeyplayers,37jka4,maradonuts,3,Thu May 28 19:02:34 2015 UTC,"Stretch after you play your first game!  I'm having flashbacks to my first game after not having played for 12 years.

hockeyplayers,37jka4,maradonuts,1 point,Thu May 28 04:32:29 2015 UTC,"Ha, good advice. I run fairly regularly and still kick myself when I was too lazy to stretch after a run the day before..."
hockeyplayers,37jka4,frosty_biscuits,2,Thu May 28 13:51:44 2015 UTC,"Just a note along those same lines.  Expect to be sore in areas you wouldn't expect.  Also, prepare to be gassed.  I was a decent runner when I started playing, and after first period my chest would be heaving.  It's just a different kind of cardio.  If you want to try and prepare for it, run some interval sprints.  One workout that I really like is pyramid sprints on a track."
hockeyplayers,37jka4,von_neumann,1 point,Thu May 28 14:45:56 2015 UTC,Running intervals isn't a bad idea. I'm a pretty slow runner anyways so it probably wouldn't hurt to build a little more quick speed.
hockeyplayers,37jka4,von_neumann,3,Thu May 28 15:44:05 2015 UTC,"Try on as much gear as you can before you buy it.  Measure yourself to get an idea before hand, but definitely try stuff on first.  While you're learning to skate, if you're going to fall, just fall.  Don't try to catch yourself, just go down slowly as possible.  BEND YOUR KNEES!  Don't worry about taking slap shots right now.  It's going to be pretty rare that you'll even get the chance to in a beginners league anyhow.  Work on your wrist shot and the rest will follow.  Being a new player, unless you get paired up with all new players, you'll likely be starting out as a winger.  Have fun!  And... bend your knees."
hockeyplayers,37jka4,von_neumann,3,Thu May 28 14:39:33 2015 UTC,"Don't skimp or rush your skate purchase. Getting a good pair of skates ($300-500) will give you extra support as your learning to skate and will last for years. Take the time to try on as many different makes and models as possible and pick whichever feels/fits best. If your skates don't fit you well, it's going to be harder to learn and you're not going to enjoy it."
hockeyplayers,37jka4,sagemaster,1 point,Thu May 28 15:03:22 2015 UTC,I've been told that I don't necessarily need a high-end ($600+) pair but also to avoid a cheap $100 pair. Can I expect to find a good pair between $2-300?
hockeyplayers,37jka4,Replacables,3,Thu May 28 15:45:06 2015 UTC,Above $200 should be good. A good litmus test is to look for replaceable runners (blades). That's a good sign that this is a good hockey skate. The sweet spot in my experience is one model above the lowest with replaceable runners. Right now I have the CCM Tacks 4052's that ran me $320 and I love them.
hockeyplayers,37jka4,getstonewalled,3,Thu May 28 15:57:44 2015 UTC,I started a year ago at 27. Took a learn to skate class and was older than most but also not the oldest. Doesn't matter. Everyone is there to have fun and NO ONE thinks they are great. It's just a rink full of humility and ambition. There's no pressure. Tell your instructor to kick your ass. It should be apparent through your skates but let them know you're in it to play hockey. They'll approach a few things a little differently than figure skaters.   HAVE FUN! You just started an addictive lifestyle that you are going to love. Enjoy it for what it is.   Go to stick and pucks whenever you can. Just get the feel of your skates under you and the puck on your stick.  You have to accept that there will be 10 year olds dangling circles around you but minus a small collection of people the hockey community is very welcoming and encouraging. Ask questions. Get feedback. Skate often. It's the only way you'll improve.

hockeyplayers,37hhez,Spade490,2,Fri May 29 01:07:08 2015 UTC,"Yup, you could probably save 20 bucks here and there on some of your other stuff like gloves and such. Shave off a couple on one of those 80 buck sticks and get one really nice on you like, and then you can get a 60 or 80 dollar one as a backup later. You very likely won't be breaking your stick your first season or two so I would just get the one really nice one first so you can feel comfortable with its weight without having to change it up a couple months later."
hockeyplayers,37hhez,Lndbrghwrstlr,2,Wed May 27 19:04:59 2015 UTC,Thanks for the tip! That definitely sounds like a better plan
hockeyplayers,37hhez,lD34TlH,1 point,Wed May 27 20:08:49 2015 UTC,"Check out some of your local shops, some will have used pro sticks for fairly cheap (one shop by me usually has them for around $60/stick). Always ask if they have a clearance section too, or just talk to some of the guys who work/own the place. They may be willing to shave some money off the stick/gear if you're friendly enough."
hockeyplayers,37hhez,funkyb,1 point,Wed May 27 22:45:41 2015 UTC,"Also since you're just starting out for a great candidate to buy the hockey monkey mystery stick packs.  They sell two sticks for half price, but you won't know exactly what stick/curve/flex you're getting.  Though they do seem to meet requests in the special instructions box as well as possible."

hockeyplayers,37hhez,kr580,5,Thu May 28 00:46:52 2015 UTC,"The bare setup would be:   Helmet + Cage + Mouthguard (Optional, but recommended) Shoulder pads Elbow pads Gloves Pants Jock Shin Pads Skates Jersey + Hockey Socks 2 Sticks (You'll always want a backup on hand.) Stick Tape + Shin Tape Bag   I'd go to your local hockey shop, try on everything you'll need and then start working around that budget once you have some actual items in mind.  We could recommend best bang for your buck items all day but what happens when you buy them and they don't fit correctly? Each piece of gear fits differently from the rest and it's pretty important that you go on and try things on. For the most part protective gear isn't much different from the rest, it's just all different fits and only your preference can choose the best one. You really need to try the stuff on and go with what fits well and feels comfortable.  As for prices, here's my take:  Helmet + Cage: $150. While it's good to spend more on a helmet you have to be sure it fits the best. A $250 helmet is worthless if it doesn't fit well and won't protect you when you have a head impact. Try on everything. If a $75 helmet fits best, go with that. If a $100-$150 helmet fits best, even better.  Shoulder pads, Elbow Pads and Shin Pads: $40 each. These don't need to be terribly expensive. They should all fit well first and foremost but I think you could find decent options at $30-$40 each. Just make sure your elbow pads have the hard plastic cups and not just the foam padding. You don't want to chip or bruise your elbows.  Gloves: $100. If you can fit it into the budget, I'd look more in the $75-$100 range. Better gloves really make a difference. Cheap gloves wear out a lot faster and they tend to be more stiff and rigid. $100 price point gloves are softer and easier to move around in. $50 are definitely usable to start out though.  Pants: $75. $50 isn't a bad point to look at but the more expensive, the more padding the pants will have. Whatever you get, make sure it has good tailbone protection.  Jock: $25. You can get a traditional jock, loose jock shorts or compression jock shorts/pants. It's all personal preference here.  Skates: $250. Too expensive and they'll be too stiff, too cheap and they'll fall apart quickly. $200-$300 is a good starting point. Make sure you take your time fitting skates with a shop employee. Skates and helmets are the most important to get the right fit. Try on every brand, every model, every possible option. Buy the pair that fits the best.  Sticks: $75 each. Either you'll love your first sticks because you don't know any better or you'll find you don't really like them. Good to spend less on sticks while starting out as you really have no idea what you like. Get whatever and see how you like it. You can grow your preferences from there. I'd recommend getting a very mild curve to start, like the Bauer PM9 or Warrior W01 (Lupul/Burrows). Look for clearance deals too. There's nothing wrong with past years' top end sticks on heavy discount. I'll never buy a new, full priced stick.  Bag: $60. I really can only recommend getting a tarpaulin bag. The large majority of bags have a ton of zippers which all break eventually and my bag got shredded even though I took care of it. Tarpaulin is tough and easy to clean out. They generally have one big zipper on the top and that's it. Less zippers to break, no material to rip. Bags like this or this or this  Adding $15 each for mouthguard, jersey and socks, plus $10 for tape, it's about $985 before tax. Now you could easily skimp down and get closer to $600 or so but that's up to you.  Good luck and have fun!"

hockeyplayers,37hhez,brttpckr,0,Sun May 31 21:01:56 2015 UTC,"Not necessary but definitely a good idea. Most people won't wear them but if you can put up with the feeling, it's always a good idea. The chances that a skate will hit your neck are very minute but you'll be glad if you have one on when you do get hit."
hockeyplayers,37hhez,cheddarbob619,1 point,Sun May 31 21:05:15 2015 UTC,Thanks! Are they only for skates or do they offer any protection against errant pucks or blocking shots the hard way?
hockeyplayers,37hhez,CatmanIndustries,0,Sun May 31 21:07:44 2015 UTC,As far as I know it's mostly for skate blades. To minimize the Clint Malarchuk's and Richard Zednik's of the world. I can't imagine the impact of a puck is going to be affected much by a throat guard.
hockeyplayers,37hhez,CatmanIndustries,3,Sun May 31 21:48:40 2015 UTC,"Skates... go to a hockey or sports store and try them on. 300 should  be fine.

hockeyplayers,37hhez,funkyb,3,Wed May 27 20:41:13 2015 UTC,"When I first got my pads, I found a bundle deal on Hockey Monkey. It was the full Reebok 12k set (shoulders, pants, elbows, shins) for $125 with free shipping. I don't remember if it was a special sale or if that was the regular price, but it wouldn't hurt to browse online for a package like that.   Also, I just recently splurged on my first pair of new skates. Don't skimp and get a cheap set, and definitely pay to get them professionally baked and fitted. Worth every penny."
hockeyplayers,37hhez,VOldis,1 point,Wed May 27 19:45:48 2015 UTC,"What do you think a $500 vs $300 skate buys you?  From what I read online, the more you pay, the stiffer/lighter a skate gets.  How about durability?  I don't mind dropping more $ on a skate if it means I can get more life out of them."
hockeyplayers,37hhez,freq019,2,Wed May 27 20:17:45 2015 UTC,"I spent $210 for brand new Bauer Vapor x500s. They seem really well made so far and are miles ahead of my original entry level pair. I'm not a very good skater yet, so I can't attest to how the x500s stand up to higher-end skates, but they feel great compared to anything I've ever skated on.  EDIT: I've only had them for a few weeks, so I can't speak to the durability yet."
hockeyplayers,37hhez,e46fan,2,Wed May 27 20:24:50 2015 UTC,"Higher price on skates will last longer, but a stiffer skate for a new player might hurt you more than help.  It will last longer, but you may be trying too hard to get flex out of the skate and hurt your skating. If you have strong legs already I'd say go for the higher end skate. If you are chicken legs and have never skated before get some cheaper skates and once you're comfortable skating in them, get something more expensive.  To me, the best things to spend money on are Shin pads and pants. Taking a shot to the shin with cheap shin pads hurt, cheap pants hurt when you fall, especially where there isn't much padding."

hockeyplayers,37hhez,Skyline_BNR34,1 point,Wed May 27 20:15:53 2015 UTC,Definitely check out the shoulder/elbow/shin combos they have on Hockey Monkey. That will save you some money you can put towards a better stick or skates. Your best bet for a stick at that price level would be the All Black Hockey Stick.
hockeyplayers,37hhez,aiden_sullivan,1 point,Wed May 27 19:53:48 2015 UTC,The All Black Hockey Stick's look pretty sweet.  I will probably get a pad combo from Hockey Monkey--just need to go to my local Total Hockey to get a feel for sizing first
hockeyplayers,37hhez,Psychotic_Ninja,1 point,Wed May 27 20:15:21 2015 UTC,"I have one and I really like it. It's comparable to most sticks in the $150-175 area.   When you get sized for pads, try on different product lines to see what you like. Just like skates, different models have different fits (ie. Bauer Vapor vs Supreme vs Nexus). Then try and find that line on Hockey Monkey and you'll be all set."
hockeyplayers,37hhez,chumchum1840,1 point,Wed May 27 20:33:33 2015 UTC,"Always check to see what end of model year stuff is on sale.

hockeyplayers,37hhez,funkyb,1 point,Wed May 27 20:14:05 2015 UTC,"I highly recommend you go to hockeymonkey.com and go into the clearance section. These are the best things with the widest variety of sizes (idk what you are), but id suggest going through yourself as there are amazing things in there.  skates  helmet, cage  shoulders  shins  elbows  gloves  sticks x2  You can get ALL this for $617(NOT $671 its $911). Yes $617(no, $911). So that means you have an extra 383($89 bucks to buy a bag, jock, mouthgaurd, and any other accessories you want. Or upgrade one of the various peices above.  Edit: oops i forgot pants  Edit 2: goddammit its not $617 its 911. but i still highly recommend all this gear. i use the shins, elbows, and used to use the sticks and skates(now upgraded)."
hockeyplayers,37hhez,Skyline_BNR34,1 point,Thu May 28 00:01:32 2015 UTC,"good picks for the most part, but people don't want maroon or green gloves and there are no pants available in any sizes except large/xl.  I agree with sticking to the clearance section though."
hockeyplayers,37hhez,funkyb,1 point,Thu May 28 01:33:38 2015 UTC,"Those were ultimately just examples. I know no one wants a xs green helmet hahaha but i was just trying to show op that he can ge high end gear for cheap.   The elbows, chest, shins amd stick i know for a fact are SUPER good for the price. I use all thwm except the shoulders ( i use good ol' sher woods)."
hockeyplayers,37hhez,chumchum1840,1 point,Thu May 28 01:53:26 2015 UTC,"Best thing to buy are Good shin pads because taking a hard shot with cheap shin pads will hurt. $100 bucks max and you can get high end shin pads from last year.  $100 bucks can get you some good mid level pants that would be perfect for beer league. I still use X:40 pants, they are one level below the old X:60 and are great and were round 100 bucks.  A good helmet and cage would run around $200 and be about the best you can buy.  Skates, I wouldn't go lower than $300 skates. If you're heavier than average >200 pounds you'll need stiffer skates because they will wear out before you know it.  If you're budgeting a grand out, you'll be able to get some damn fine equipment.  Basically, what I did was just went to hckeymonkey and used your budget. I'm slightly above the $1000 price point but it would be more than enough for anyone.  Keep in mind I used Bauer equipment here, which I'm a huge fan of:  Bauer Supreme 190 Gloves  Bauer Supreme 190 Protective equipment which includes:  Shoulders  Elbows  Shins  Bauer 9900 Helmet combo, On clearance, but a great helmet if you can get one.  Bauer supreme 170 Skates  And 2 Bauer Supreme 170 sticks  The grand total was $1,079.91  The 190 equipment is second from the top in protection, the 170 skates are great as they are in the $300 pricepoint and will last for a beginner, and the helmet is top end on clearance. The 2 sticks are 100 each, good for a composite stick, but cheaper sticks can be had that are better, ABHS as a prime example.  If that is too much, I would downgrade the protective to the 170 as it is 50 cheaper, and possibly the gloves too. Also keep in mind this does not include practice jerseys, hockey socks, skate socks, jocks, or under shirts.  2 Bauer Supreme 170 Sticks."

Good power and it can take a beating, probably blocked over 20 slapshots with it and it still isn't cracked. Although only go for a Sherwood if you like a heavy stick, my team mates call it the branch because it is close to 2X the weight of any stick owned by my counterparts on the ice.

Ccm rbz - http://www.hockeymonkey.com/ccm-hockey-skates-rbz-sr.html  These are a top of the line skate for only $240. They are great quality, especially for the price. One thing about ccm is that they fit better for bigger feet  Bauer ims 7.0 - http://www.hockeymonkey.com/bauer-hockey-helmet-ims-7.html  Protective Helmet for a good price, a tiny bit over $100 though.

This one is $100, but was once their top of the line stick. As for my recommendation for buying sticks in the future. Usually anything in a new lineup that's $80 or under will be crap.   Ccm rbz 110 protective - http://www.hockeymonkey.com/ccm-hockey-equipment-combo-rbz-110-le-sr.html  I love the fit of ccm protective gear, these are just the cheaper versions of the top of the line pads.

All of this without a discount code on the website costs $930. This leaves you with some room to upgrade. However, hockey monkey always has discount codes you can use to make things even cheaper.

I don't think it's anything to get worked up about. I mean this is also a very new business and he's got ridiculously small distribution right now. I also bet at the scale his business is his margins aren't great either.  If I was going to critique something from the information I have (I went to the site) would be the design of those sticks is pretty gaudy.
hockeyplayers,37hnq9,willdesignforfood,7,Wed May 27 18:48:15 2015 UTC,"I think my issue comes from the comparison against a $300 stick. If you compare most products that are in use against the most expensive one you can find they will seem cheap.  The vast majority of sticks on the market are in this price range already, but it's being pitched as a ""help out the little guy with quality budget sticks"" thing, which bothers me. I could very well be over-reacting due to being a bit grumpy over neither eating breakfast or drinking any coffee yet, but it grinds my gears a bit.  Edit Okay, actually this is what bothers me most after a moment of thinking about it. He says in the article:   ""I hit two markets: the parents who don’t want to pay for a stick that’s too expensive and the beer league player who wants a high-performance stick.""   What rattles me about this is growing up I wasn't allowed to play hockey. I wanted to so bad, but my parents just couldn't afford it. I'm now 25 and have bought myself all my gear and have started going out to pickup games because I realized just because I didn't start playing when I was 5 doesn't mean I can't start now. I'm still broke as hell, so I have all entry level gear and bought nearly everything second hand, but I've been loving every minute of it. When I saw the article I thought ""This is great! An NHL player wanting to help out the little guys!"" Then I went to the site, saw the price and it put a bad taste in my mouth."
hockeyplayers,37hnq9,willdesignforfood,3,Wed May 27 18:51:57 2015 UTC,"I can understand that. I do think he's being honest when he says that's his goal though. He said it himself, he went to buy a stick for beer league and was shocked at how expensive a good stick was even though money wasn't an issue for him. I'd just give him time. More publicity and distribution will help him get the price down eventually. It may be more of a business problem than not being genuine about his mission."

Maybe that's not everybody's MO but it seems like a safer bet than going after stuff that is a bit more untested and smaller production simply for the sake of a cheaper price point"

hockeyplayers,37hnq9,halodoze,2,Wed May 27 21:33:52 2015 UTC,What are people's opinion of All Black Hockey Sticks? Was looking at them and thinking to just buy there in the future.
hockeyplayers,37hnq9,projectbeastmode,3,Thu May 28 00:01:03 2015 UTC,"I haven't tried them personally, but I have only heard good things. When I look to upgrade my stick I'll most likely be going with them, unless I find a killer deal on something in town"
hockeyplayers,37hnq9,kduffball,2,Thu May 28 00:24:17 2015 UTC,"You're not weird. There are good things to spend money on, and it's everyone's preference.  I prefer wooden sticks to $100+ sticks because I know all sticks break easy, and I'm not interested in focusing on the hot new fad, just in playing hockey."

hockeyplayers,37hnq9,BlazePenguin,1 point,Wed May 27 19:27:38 2015 UTC,Seems to be better and less expensive sticks at prostockhockey.com
hockeyplayers,37hnq9,Skyline_BNR34,1 point,Wed May 27 21:16:52 2015 UTC,He isn't running a charity. My guess is it'll be a decent value for the price but it's not going to be a true top of the line stick.   To be honest I'm more interested in durability than performance. A current midrange one piece stick is pretty good. Make it last twice as long and I'll pay just as much.
hockeyplayers,37hnq9,projectbeastmode,1 point,Thu May 28 18:35:38 2015 UTC,My opinion- At the end of the day it's another line of generic commodity sticks. Wouldn't even think about buying one.
hockeyplayers,37hnq9,projectbeastmode,-1,Wed May 27 19:22:14 2015 UTC,"The problem with sticks is how little they cost to make and the ridiculous prices they offer up.  Yea you could say R+D is the culprit, but the actual materials used in a hockey stick cost less than 10 bucks to purchase and they sell for $270."
hockeyplayers,37hnq9,Subject2Change,1 point,Thu May 28 02:08:53 2015 UTC,"There's more to getting a product to market than materials, unfortunately.   You need to (in addition to R&D):   Assemble people and tools to create those products Ship those products to all the appropriate destinations Recoup your marketing/sales dollars (and even this ""word of mouth"" stuff costs money) Get a return on all that cash tied up in inventory (and buffer for the risk of not selling it) Allow every party along the way to make a profit (or else there's no point in being in business...why risk all that money and spend all that effort)   You can really only talk about a gap like that if you can do all the work to bring the materials to a finished product on your own. Even then, can you do in less time than you value your time at?"
hockeyplayers,37hnq9,projectbeastmode,1 point,Thu May 28 03:50:28 2015 UTC,I talked to a sales rep from one of the big brands about this once. It's roughly $60 US to get to top-end sticks off the line in China.  Mid-range sticks are $30-40 and lower-end composites are $15-20.
hockeyplayers,37hnq9,Subject2Change,1 point,Thu May 28 03:54:10 2015 UTC,AliExpress sells sticks...
hockeyplayers,37hnq9,projectbeastmode,1 point,Thu May 28 14:03:36 2015 UTC,"I'd guess many of those are counterfeit (i.e. if it says Bauer on it, I'm sure, even if it's the exact same stick, it's not a Bauer stick) and although you may get a perfectly good stick, you've got no one to go back to in the event you get a completely crap lot.  That and there's quite the lead time.  Sorry - I've worked with retailers in the past and it irks me when it's suggested that retailers add no value and just ""mark things up."" Yes, you can get the same product directly from a factory for less, but there are a lot of things you're losing."
hockeyplayers,37hnq9,Subject2Change,1 point,Thu May 28 15:39:16 2015 UTC,"Oh absolutely, I'm guessing they are factory rejects or something.  However I am unsure of what sticks are made in the USA/Canada vs overseas. It'd be a cool test to buy one from Ali and one from a reputable store to compare the two. Perhaps when I am in need of a new stick I might come to that."
hockeyplayers,37hnq9,Skyline_BNR34,1 point,Thu May 28 16:15:34 2015 UTC,"I'm sure there are lots of good sticks on there...it's just hard to tell. I know a few people around that have sold counterfeit sticks out of their garage after finding an Ali deal...their issue with that is inventory though as all the curve, hand, flex, grip, etc. options add up.  As far as I know almost all of them are made in China. The exceptions I'm aware of are:   Some of the top-end Easton sticks made in Mexico for a quicker turnaround time Colt I think makes their sticks in China, then brings them to Canada to have their coating process done   I think Combat used to make their sticks in Canada, but cannot confirm that. Many wood sticks are still made in Canada as well as a large portion of the wood/foam core goalie stuff.   I don't know of any US production...maybe those Carbon Sports Airblades that were on Kickstarter awhile ago?"
hockeyplayers,37hnq9,Skyline_BNR34,1 point,Thu May 28 16:19:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the top end Bauers seem to sell on Ali mostly. Lots of NXGs on there. I'm generally a Warrior guy (I need the extra length) so I might investigate a bit."
hockeyplayers,37hnq9,projectbeastmode,1 point,Thu May 28 16:21:42 2015 UTC,"I think most sticks tend to come from overseas.  I know for a fact my prostock Easton said made in Mexico.  If I still had the broken shaft of my Bauer Prostock I would look at it, but IIRC it actually did come from Canada, if not Canada it was made in Thailand just like the rest of the gear outside of the MX3, APX2, and Nexus 8000 gear.  I know my One.9 skates are made in Thailand."
hockeyplayers,37irsj,ZachB10,7,Wed May 27 22:54:24 2015 UTC,"In the offensive zone, your primary role is keeping the puck in the zone.  When you pinch, it generally should be for the purpose of achieving this.  As far as shooting/passing goes, it's pretty much a judgement call, but if you choose to pass, be sure that you're not passing into an area where they could turn it over for a breakaway.  When you shoot, more often than not, it should be for the purpose of creating chaos in front of the net to give your forwards a shot at a garbage goal, rather than you scoring yourself.  Try to aim for the goalies far leg pad or blocker (if you're shooting from his/her glove side), as this tend to create rebounds that result in easy tap-in goals.  In the defensive zone, first man back takes the puck carrier, second man back takes the pass.  Stay as tight with your man as you can without being overly vulnerable.  In general, your position relative to the attacker should be 'just a little bit uncomfortable.'  Try to play them into the corners, then block passing lanes.  If they're in the corner, you can give them the shot.  Your goalie should be able to handle a hard angle shot.  Once the opposing team is set in the offensive zone, one defenseman should be guarding the net, while the other is playing more to the farther ends of the house.  When you get the puck, your top priority is to clear the zone, ideally in the form of a successful breakout pass, but if that's not possible, anything that doesn't result in icing is good.  Or if you're confident enough, just skate that shit out.  NEVER PASS THE FUCKING PUCK IN FRONT OF YOUR OWN FUCKING NET.  Neutral zone d is mainly the forwards responsibility, as you need to be positioning yourself to handle their breakout if an attempted turnover is unsuccessful.  Obviously there's a lot more to it, but I think that should be a good starting point.  Also, the most fundamentally perfect defenseman ever was Lidstrom.  Study his film, you'll learn a lot, especially about positioning.  Edit: minor additions"
hockeyplayers,37irsj,lernington,7,Wed May 27 23:45:28 2015 UTC,NEVER PASS THE FUCKING PUCK IN FRONT OF YOUR OWN FUCKING NET.   This. No matter how good the pass looks. Something terrible will happen and it will be all your fault.
hockeyplayers,37irsj,digifxplus,2,Thu May 28 21:42:01 2015 UTC,"If it's a beginner league, judging from my experience, just get the puck on net or down the boards if it comes up to you.  Trying to make a cute pass will probably result in a turnover.  Don't pinch if you can't get to it.  Make sure you don't let any cherry pickers sit behind you.  Be alright with never getting the puck passed to you at the point.  Stay disciplined in your own end - don't go chasing a guy around, stay between him and the net.  And most importantly, don't ever blindly throw the puck across the middle."
hockeyplayers,37irsj,Jeembo,2,Thu May 28 00:01:16 2015 UTC,Gap control. Breakouts. Smart stick.
hockeyplayers,37irsj,sterlingarcher0069,2,Thu May 28 07:03:05 2015 UTC,"If you can't skate backwards well, get practicing. Make sure you can do backwards crossovers because it's really tough to play good defense without them. Try to always remember that your job isn't to take the puck away from the guy skating at you, it's just to always be in his way. He can do all sorts of fancy things with the puck, but if you can stay in front of him you'll give him a hard time.   When you're learning, it's important to not be afraid to communicate. Even if you don't know the ""right"" move, saying what you're doing or telling your teammate what to do while a play is developing is always better than silently trying to figure out what he or she is going to do. It has the added plus of encouraging your teammate to talk with you after the play and figure out what the right play was so that you can learn."
hockeyplayers,37irsj,ohcrocsle,1 point,Fri May 29 16:36:28 2015 UTC,"if you're in a footrace to get back on D, dont skate at the player your in a race with, skate as hard as you can straight at your goalie, you will naturally cut the angle off. then once you recover, try and force them to the outside."
hockeyplayers,37irsj,Notorious253,1 point,Thu May 28 00:03:07 2015 UTC,"I just started playing D lately and I came up with a thing to help decision making in our zone.  If the puck's in our zone (and my responsibility) I have to: Move it! (ie pass or clear it) Carry it! (ie skate with it) or  Eat it! (ie hold it up on the boards if I can't do either of the above)  It's become a little mantra in my head while I go through the process of making it a habit - Move it, carry it, eat it!"

The extra money I'd spend on a better stick is not going to provide me with extra enjoyment."
hockeyplayers,37idcf,Lndbrghwrstlr,1 point,Thu May 28 16:01:27 2015 UTC,"The only really noticeable difference between this and a higher end one is going to be the weight. You'll feel the weight is far lighter and doing some 1 handed things becomes much simpler with it, but if you get it too early (like I did) you may start to pick up some bad habits, like constantly using one hand when the puck comes to the backhand. It's a lot easier to suffer through using a heavy stick where you can't really do that much and are forced to use 2 hands."

Well I would highly recommend seeing if you can find a store with sticks you can feel in your hands, or at least something in that line. $100 is alot for a beginner to spend on a stick you have never seen before.   I would look for a stick with a low kick point for wrist shots in close. I would try a heel or mid curve for close in lift depending on your comfort level. Possibly the Bauer PM9, or P88. Look for a stick that offers a quick release, like the Bauer Vapor, Ribcores (like you said) or Warriors (if you are okay with a super whippy stick)"

hockeyplayers,37jgbj,Holioportfolioateyou,4,Thu May 28 01:51:44 2015 UTC,Ovechkin and Owen Nolan started late at age 8 or 9.  I started when I was 9 and was at a tremendous disadvantage because most players had been playing since they were 5 or earlier.  I hate to be blunt but the ship has sailed.  If you have passion and work hard you may be able to play decent high school hockey (JV or maybe varsity by your senior year).
hockeyplayers,37jgbj,CantThinkOfOriginal,2,Thu May 28 01:58:43 2015 UTC,"Ed jovanovski is the oldest I can think of, and he started at 11. I'd have to agree that unless you are an athletic freak who would excel in any sport (JJ Watt or Lebron etc.) then it's too late to think of starting an NHL career at 14.   But, no reason not to pick up the game just for fun :)"
hockeyplayers,37jgbj,solid_vegas,1 point,Thu May 28 02:02:32 2015 UTC,"Mackenze Stewart started at 12 and can hear only something like 80% of his hearing after many surgeries. He's not in the NHL yet, but is drafted by the Canucks."
hockeyplayers,37jgbj,StevenWongo,5,Thu May 28 14:51:04 2015 UTC,"Nothing is impossible. But to be an elite hockey player, you are severely behind. If youre serious, start practicing. Now. Find a private teacher and take skating lessons. If youre not on the ice, you need to be in the gym, doing off ice workouts, or studying hockey plays.   You have the gift of the internet. Pretty much anything you beed to know you can find on the world wide web. Good luck."
hockeyplayers,37jgbj,Jag94,2,Thu May 28 01:56:11 2015 UTC,"It's definitely not too late to start. I started last year and hockey has brought a new joy to my life. But don't get your hopes up. The NHL isn't just the players who practiced the most. They are all naturally good, something about them that can't be taught. There are approximately 1000 players in the NHL, and there are millions who play hockey competitively, so a minuscule  percentage makes it (about 0.06% after a little math). Don't let this steer you away, hockey is the best sport on the planet and is a blast. Give it a shot."

hockeyplayers,37jgbj,animalsciences,-2,Thu May 28 02:10:09 2015 UTC,"The comments have been mixed but I believe you could still make he NHL. Look at guys like Jagr, he is naturally gifted as well as having a crazy work ethic. If you get into it full time and put all your time into hockey you could make the NHL. I think you would need to become a student of the game and watch players movements and the way they play. Once you develop the eye for spotting things it will be easier. Not going to sugar coat it, you are behind in getting started to play at an elite level. You are going to need to put extra time in but it is a reachable goal."
hockeyplayers,37jgbj,Bluearmy69,2,Thu May 28 04:00:20 2015 UTC,"It is too late. I don't know why everyone else is giving you this false hope. probably less than .01% of youth hockey players make it to the NHL. To be on track to be a part of that .01% you should already be a confident skater and have basic puck skills. At your age NHL guys are playing AA/AAA hockey and already have a foot in the door to juniors.   A realistic goal for you should be to make your high schools varsity team in you senior year or maybe one of those weird U18AA teams. Who knows, maybe you can play Club in college. But do NOT let people on here convince you that you'll make the NHL or even D1 college, it's ridiculous and is just going to crush you when you don't.   All that being said hockey is the best game on the planet and just because you can't make a living off of it is no reason not to play. Get some skates and go to public skate or something to build your skating base, then gradually work up to a stick and puck.  Good luck."
hockeyplayers,37jgbj,Skyline_BNR34,1 point,Thu May 28 14:46:29 2015 UTC,"If you're starting now, you would need to be on the ice everyday for hours in order to make it.  It's not impossible, but very unlikely.  Tyler Myers started at age 10, that's about the latest I know of."

hockeyplayers,37f55n,dangler7,2,Wed May 27 19:11:23 2015 UTC,"I've had that issue before. It's just bad luck, the length and model of your pants and shins are perfect to allow this to happen. Changing up your pants or shins, going shorter or longer should fix the issue. Or potentially removing the flap on the top of your shins if you don't feel like spending more money and you don't mind having a small gap in protection."

hockeyplayers,37f55n,down_to_puck,2,Fri May 29 03:57:45 2015 UTC,I had the same problem as you after I switched to new shin pads.  What I did to fix is to unzip your pants at the bottom of each leg.  Most pants have a zipper you can unzip to make the pant leg bigger.  This should make the pant leg wide enough so that the shin pad doesn't fold over the top of your hockey pants.
hockeyplayers,37f55n,boingmydoing,3,Wed May 27 06:18:46 2015 UTC,I did this as well!
hockeyplayers,37f55n,Knobdy1,1 point,Wed May 27 17:24:39 2015 UTC,"I'm guessing your pants are getting caught under the flap padding on top. You can cut this flap off if need be. If you look at some used prostock shin pads on eBay, you will see this done by the trainers every once in a while."

As you enter the turn, bend your knees and bring your waist down towards the ice (this will lower your center of gravity and push your weight down into your skates). You should feel like 95% of your weight in your heels. Its also important that your upper body is facing in the direction you want to go, with your stick leading the way.   Do it slow at first. Dont try full speed right away. There is a good video to watch that explains all that, ill see if i can find it."

Methinks these guys are just idiots.  Or maybe, they think you're an idiot and want to see if you'll throw your gear in a pool.  Just dry it out and spray it with some athletic gear spray from amazon for like $12.  Or put your shit on and jump in the pool.  But please god post a photo doing this."

hockeyplayers,37c07q,Zednix,3,Wed May 27 04:27:12 2015 UTC,Just throw it into the bathtub with a little bleach and soap. Same thing but you'd keep the funk out of your pool.
hockeyplayers,37c07q,crowber,3,Tue May 26 16:20:29 2015 UTC,It's probably fine but the UV radiation from the sunshine will drastically reduce the life of the pads.

hockeyplayers,37c07q,superdelux86,5,Tue May 26 18:18:31 2015 UTC,Shocking a pool or tub does not remove all the sweat and bleh that comes off your gear. It only kills the bugs that come from it.   Do it a few times and I bet you'd be wondering why your pool tastes so salty. Because it's your ball sweat. Gross.
hockeyplayers,37c07q,MNEvenflow,2,Tue May 26 19:38:50 2015 UTC,"18,000 gallons of water just doesn't get too affected by a little hockey gear.   Oh, it wasn't the pool I was worried about.   I'm no germaphobe, but pools/hot tubs are basically ponds with a little more filtering and chlorine. I don't see why anyone would prefer using a pool or hot tub to just throwing your gear in your bathtub with some soap, which I guarantee is a lot cleaner.  Ask yourself this: would you throw your clothes in the pool and consider them cleaned?"
hockeyplayers,37c07q,IndependentBoof,2,Tue May 26 20:50:07 2015 UTC,Used to do it all the time. The AZ sun really helps them dry faster too
hockeyplayers,37c07q,nhlgoalie20,2,Tue May 26 18:18:14 2015 UTC,Why clean the gear at all?
hockeyplayers,37c07q,WhiskyTango3,1 point,Tue May 26 20:02:19 2015 UTC,"I wear stuff under my pads and shorts, etc.. (like an under armour spandexy stuff) so my stuff usually doesn't smell, I just wash the spandexy stuff and socks   my wife sprays the other stuff I think, from time to time"

hockeyplayers,37c07q,kr580,1 point,Tue May 26 20:45:43 2015 UTC,I never knew you could get staph from wearing dirty pads. I think my elbow pads are the only pad that actually touches my skin.
hockeyplayers,37c07q,WhiskyTango3,1 point,Tue May 26 20:48:30 2015 UTC,You can get really bad mold on gear and that could in turn give you staph or MRSA infections which are nasty. Plus cleaning your gear will kill some of the smell and extend the gear life.
hockeyplayers,37c07q,Zednix,2,Wed May 27 04:28:17 2015 UTC,"I used to do this when I was a teen. My Dad would take our gear(2 kids worth) and dip it into the pool and throw it on the lawn in sun. Hose it off right away and let the sun do the rest.   If you don't hose it off the chlorine will sit on your gear and itch the shit out of you when you wear it again. Also, do not let your gear soak in the pool, that will make the pool nasty and isn't good for the velcro bits."
hockeyplayers,37c07q,Zednix,1 point,Wed May 27 04:24:51 2015 UTC,One thing i have heard is that the UV light from the sun will help kill bacteria in your gear while helping it dry.

hockeyplayers,37e6bp,crsmith,2,Tue May 26 23:44:22 2015 UTC,I think you're mostly on the right track -- only thing I can think of off the top of my head is tennis balls to practice blocking shots with. We'd get in line and practice our form while a coach hucked them at us.
hockeyplayers,37e6bp,dazosan,2,Wed May 27 00:32:31 2015 UTC,"Soccer balls and a few Frisbees, lots of cones, go cart tires, tennis balls.pinnies, and a couple of play boards, small nets, regulation nets."
hockeyplayers,37e6bp,buddhaplayshockey,1 point,Wed May 27 10:52:39 2015 UTC,Growing up my coaches had two things. Pylons and whistles.  Occasionally we broke out the rink shooter tutor because one of our goalies couldn't make it.  Instead of parachutes we did relay races pushing nets or pulling each other.
hockeyplayers,37e6bp,aradil,2,Tue May 26 23:55:46 2015 UTC,Instead of parachutes we did relay races pushing nets   My butthole clenched at the memories this sentence brought up.
hockeyplayers,37e6bp,dazosan,1 point,Wed May 27 00:31:27 2015 UTC,"I actually use go-kart tires instead of pylons. They are heavier and don't go flying when pucks hit them. We usually keep things basic but try to add a couple of new pieces every year to stimulate our creativity in drills. ""How can I use this tool?"" has been a good question for me making new drills."
hockeyplayers,37d7el,Azphael,2,Tue May 26 19:42:43 2015 UTC,I would suggest trying the second to highest model. Like the Vapor X100. You will not loose much performance and the second to highest usually has the greatest durability.
hockeyplayers,37d7el,kingofthediamond,1 point,Tue May 26 20:26:06 2015 UTC,"I just got a Bauer Vapor x600 --$55 for low kick point, though it is 85 flex instead of 75. Had it for two weeks and it's great. If you're not going for high end performance I don't see much point in spending triple digits on sticks."
hockeyplayers,37d7el,dazosan,3,Tue May 26 20:06:31 2015 UTC,The only problem with going from an APX 2 to a X600 is a huge drop in performance and a large increase in weight.
hockeyplayers,37d7el,kingofthediamond,3,Tue May 26 20:14:10 2015 UTC,"That's true but, like I said before, if you're not a high end player I don't see much point in paying for high end equipment, especially considering that mid-range stuff is still really, really good, if a bit heavier."
hockeyplayers,37d7el,dazosan,3,Tue May 26 20:18:26 2015 UTC,Absolutely! I completely agree. I personally like the high end because of the weight plus the performance is much better. but I never pay more than $120 for a stick.
hockeyplayers,37d7el,kingofthediamond,2,Tue May 26 20:32:03 2015 UTC,"And at any rate you can get an X700 for $99, 77 flex, OP."
hockeyplayers,37d7el,dazosan,2,Tue May 26 20:22:19 2015 UTC,yeah
hockeyplayers,37d7el,kingofthediamond,1 point,Tue May 26 20:30:58 2015 UTC,"Not a low kick point but the Bauer Nexus 4000 is the best, lightest, most durable cheapest stick I've ever owned. Might want to try to find the equivalent in the new or older Vapor line."
hockeyplayers,37d7el,Knobdy1,1 point,Tue May 26 21:29:53 2015 UTC,"It could still be too whippy for you, but I find going up a flex level on the Warrior DT series is a recipe for success.  I typically play with a 100 flex but when I want something with a bit more flex I use my 100 flex DT2. I sold a friend my 100 flex DT4 and he loves it, having typically used 85 flex sticks in the past.  TL; DR maybe try an 85 flex DT series stick if you can find it RH, they're great value IMO."

hockeyplayers,37d42r,captainhook77,2,Tue May 26 19:21:34 2015 UTC,"There are some good threads here if you search, but the main thing is killing the bacteria. So make sure to dry your gear every time you play! Just washing won't help as that doesn't kill the bacteria. What I do is:  Fill tub with warm water  Soak gear (inners for shins, gloves, jerseys, shoulders, elbows, socks, jock, pants)  Drain tub, soak again  Drain tub, soak w/ water and white vinegar  Drain, lay out to dry  This removes a lot of the funk and can keep it not so smelly for most of a season as long as I dry it after every game."

hockeyplayers,37d42r,lostincbus,1 point,Tue May 26 20:05:40 2015 UTC,"Like cheddarbob619 posted too, it's just getting a bacteria killer (like bleach) in with the water. So you can wash your gear regularly in the washer, but heat will reactivate the bacteria if it's still there."
hockeyplayers,37d42r,lostincbus,1 point,Tue May 26 20:33:49 2015 UTC,Gotcha. But won't bleach turn everything white?
hockeyplayers,37d42r,cheddarbob619,1 point,Tue May 26 21:00:23 2015 UTC,"I don't personally use bleach, I use white vinegar, so I don't know how it works on hockey gear. The vinegar smell comes out usually during the drying process, and I use soap with the vinegar too."
hockeyplayers,37d42r,von_neumann,2,Tue May 26 21:03:31 2015 UTC,"My method is a bathtub of cool water, mix in some laundry detergent and a bit of bleach, fill the the tub with the gear and soak for a good hour or two, then I rinse it thoroughly both by filling the tub with fresh water, and by rinsing it from above with the shower head. If the gear still has some stank, I do another soak and rinse.  I then hang the gear to let it drip out and dry, make sure to put some towels down if you're doing it indoors, the gear holds a lot of water. I also use a hair dryer to get some of the inner parts of some of the gear.  The only things you shouldn't put in the water are the helmet and your skates. For those I use some disinfectant and wipe it down with a clean cloth"

hockeyplayers,37dz1n,kingofthediamond,1 point,Wed May 27 01:29:17 2015 UTC,How do you find the durability of the AX1? I have the AX2 and its a tank.

hockeyplayers,37dz1n,kingofthediamond,1 point,Wed May 27 04:16:57 2015 UTC,"Thats awesome. Mine is also 85 flex but since I'm short, I cut like 8 inches off so it was too stiff. I tried to break it but I literally couldn't. It is the most durable thing ever."

The DT1LT is also one of, if not the best top of the line stick on the market. The original Dynasty was absolutely awful. The widow is decent but compared to the others, I think the DT1 is the way to go, second by dolomite.   Could you get me some dolomites? I have been dying to find more."
hockeyplayers,37dz1n,kingofthediamond,1 point,Wed May 27 03:26:56 2015 UTC,"What an enigmatic stick, I've never seen so many people love a stick that breaks so much.  I think there is one dolomite left and it's a low flex, I might get it for me though. Are you from Canada? PM me."
hockeyplayers,37dz1n,kingofthediamond,2,Wed May 27 05:04:06 2015 UTC,"it was just a stick that at the time was far better than any other on the market. Like the supreme 190 or originally Vapor X60.   I'm from New York. I need a Righty, Draper curve, 75 or 85 flex."
hockeyplayers,37dz1n,WTFvancouver,1 point,Wed May 27 12:00:16 2015 UTC,"One more thing about the dolomites. They were a 2 piece molded together which slightly decreased its durability in the shaft. Warrior blades back then were not built well at all so they used to break a lot. Although puck feel and shooting with the dolomite was amazing. It was a well balanced, well designed, sexy looking stick. Plus if you had the privilege to use a blue dragon or the Spyne.... How sick was that design?"
hockeyplayers,37dz1n,kingofthediamond,1 point,Wed May 27 03:34:51 2015 UTC,i have used the widow and covert dt1. DT1 has a better feel and control. Widow is lighter and great for shots.

hockeyplayers,37bxnh,1966mopar,2,Tue May 26 14:28:15 2015 UTC,"My league I played this past year never really did positions, we kind of just did forward or D. I always ended up on different wings as a forward and never really thought much of it. I naturally wanted to be on the right wing at first since I'm right handed but after a while I started to notice I felt more comfortable with the puck and receiving passes over on the left. And now the summer league I'm in has more structure and I'd going to be specifying positions so I have to lock in which I should go with for the summer and I'm still not sure."
hockeyplayers,37bxnh,Lndbrghwrstlr,2,Tue May 26 14:53:39 2015 UTC,As a righty I've scored a lot more goals from the left side in beer league than the right side.  Cutting to the inside puts me on my forehand to shoot.  Weak side rebounds are on my forehand.  It has downsides.  You pass off the backhand more or you telegraphy passes by pulling the puck back to your forehand.   I've heard arguments that clearing your own zone is worse when you're off-hand but I don't buy it.  As a wing pucks that come up the wall are received on your forehand and you immediately are on your strong passing forehand for breakouts through the middle when needed.
hockeyplayers,37bxnh,Belsekar,1 point,Tue May 26 15:32:02 2015 UTC,"I'm a lefty but I like the right wing, the only problem I find is receiving the puck from the d. I usually have turn around to receive it then turn around again and start moving. If I'm on the left side I don't have that problem. But I here what your saying, I like to go up the right side and then cut over and be on my forehand. It would be the opposite on the other side. We don't play position either, I just stayed on the left wing because that's what I need work on."
hockeyplayers,37bxnh,AviateAndNavigate,1 point,Tue May 26 16:23:00 2015 UTC,"I did something similar last week. I went from left defense to left wing.

hockeyplayers,37daul,RustyDarkstar76,10,Tue May 26 20:05:21 2015 UTC,"If you have any ""issues"", I highly doubt it's because you skate too fast.  Are you in control?

hockeyplayers,37c2aw,wafflecakee,1 point,Tue May 26 16:08:33 2015 UTC,"I would contact the manufacturer directly. If it is faulty they should replace it.   When you skate, your foot is rotating outward ay least 30 degrees to push and then back straight to glide so a few degree misallignment should make no real difference once your body gets used to it.   Having said that, the forces transferred from the blade though the boot can be quite high and a misaligned outsole may make the boot less strong. It may be a small difference but it may also affect the life of the boot."
hockeyplayers,37c2aw,somewhat_random,1 point,Tue May 26 17:23:03 2015 UTC,"So your LHS won't let you exchange them with the outsole being misaligned? Hit Bauer up directly and tell them the whole story (you're supposed to deal with your LHS the first 90 days, but this looks to be an exception if they are giving you shit).

Playing against better people is how you get better yourself. I moved up what I felt like was too early, and then again before I felt I even belonged in the division I'm in now, and I still feel that way, but playing people better than me is a lot more challenging and has definitely helped me improve."
hockeyplayers,378n9c,TheBlueEagle,4,Mon May 25 20:02:47 2015 UTC,Best piece of advice I can give to anybody. I have guys that say all the time they are thinking about moving down to get more puck time and work on their skills etc. It wont help you as much as playing against better people and listening to better people.
hockeyplayers,378n9c,nocookie4u,1 point,Tue May 26 00:14:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I mean I'm lower-middle tier in my league/team, and we haven't won a game yet this season, but we've come close, and I can say for a matter of fact I could school the old me from 6 months ago."
hockeyplayers,378n9c,TheBlueEagle,1 point,Tue May 26 01:16:05 2015 UTC,I used to play daily with a friend who was a fantastically talented player.  I attribute my strong defense and development to constantly playing him.  Since then my most noticeable progressions have occurred when playing with and against more skilled players.  For the past two years or so I've been essentially playing down a level because that's the only ice time I can make and my play has really stagnated.
hockeyplayers,378n9c,funkyb,1 point,Tue May 26 13:07:03 2015 UTC,"I've played my whole life and pretty competitively, and I'm in lower-C now. I have to travel an hour away which limits my ability to go to a higher division, but car pooling is worth it.  I'm the goalie, so I don't make that big of a difference. Guys all the time keep saying they want to move down for more ice time, to handle the puck, to work on dangles, whatever. What's the point if you move up a league and cant do it on that guy? Now you start right back where you are at. Plus if you get a guy like me on the team who is more than willing to give pointers, it helps out. You might not have that in the lower league."

The trick around this is to heat up the stickers with a blow dryer then taking them off and putting them on the inside. This way, if the ref notices anything, you could just take off your Helmet and show them the inside."

I bought them for $250 at the blackfriday sale last year and i absolutely love them. They are extremely light and very agile. Imo, skates (and stick) are the most important peices of equipment for a hockey player. These are high quality skates and you wont have any problems with them.  As for something along the lines of a quality, cheap skate, id go with nexus 600, or the vapor x80.   Before the makos, i had the x80's and loved them.   Good luck!"

Right now I'm considering lowering my goals and getting the RBZ 80 or Ribcor 26k, both are $113 on HockeyMonkey (normally $350) and the saved money would go nicely for some gloves which I also desperately need."

I would go to as many public ice sessions as possible even without a stick and get very comfortable on your skates. Focus on starting, stopping, and changing directions forward and backward.  While you're working on that, study the decisions the pros make, a lot of the time a ""bad"" player can be better than anyone else because they make the right decisions with the puck. Once you are comfortable on your skates you can play and focus on the game instead of the task of skating itself. Skate hard, have fun. :)"

hockeyplayers,379cq3,Scuddie,1 point,Tue May 26 16:46:21 2015 UTC,"I'm 28, bought my first skates in December. Got my Hockey gear in February and play just about every week. If I could somehow go back and make myself start at 14 I would.  As for tips, get a good well fitted (seek help at a store for this) pair of skates. You'll want to spend a fair bit of cash on these so that may be tough since you're 14. Once you get your skates you should look at taking lessons, I'd also recommend getting as much ice time as you can. Be prepared to fall and to struggle, all of us have this happen so don't be put off, its part of the process. Lessons will help you learn proper technique but YouTube has some truly great videos on the subject of skating (check out the side bar).  Once you've got skating down to a point where you can skate in a controlled manner then its time to get your gear. Check out things like Play it Again Sports for used gear (or whatever the equivalent in Canada is), Craigslist can be hit or miss. Once you have your gear I'd say start going to stick time, stick and puck or whatever its called at your local rink. Basically it's just time for your to skate in full gear and practice your stickhandling, shooting etc. It will also help get you acquainted with skating in full kit. After a few sessions then try jumping into a pickup that says its for beginners or see if your local rink is still accepting players.  The worst thing you can do is hold yourself back by thinking you can't do it, that you're too old or not good enough. If you want it then go for it. Most Hockey players all understand that its tough starting out but if you're willing to try most players will respect you for it and help you out along the way.  Best of luck!"

Whatever you get though, I strenuously recommend getting a pair with some kind of hard plastic shell. I say this because for half a season when I was a teenager I wore a pair of I think JOFAs that were all foam padding with no shell. Falling on your elbow with flimsy protection like that is among the more painful things I've ever experienced on ice."

The newer models (QR1) will have a flexible thumb, last years will have a standard pro lock thumb  CCM makes the new Tacks glove which I believe (somebody correct me if I'm mistaken) will be the new tapered fit glove for them, the also are continuing with the 30k KFS glove which will be the anatomical snug fit the cuff is a bit short for my liking but it's personal preference.  Bauer NXG's have been notorious for having that rubber palm piece fall off just a bit of warning so I would spring for this years model  If you can find a pair of the Eagle Talon 90 Pro's (retail name) they are fantastic and they have dropped in price a lot, anatomical fit tremendous palms, really soft feel on the ice even after months of use http://www.hockeymonkey.com/eagle-hockey-gloves-talon90-pro.html"
hockeyplayers,376zld,stevegcook,1 point,Mon May 25 18:10:46 2015 UTC,A tight fitting pair of Warrior gloves will be the QR/DT (covert) line. A tight fitting pair of CCMs will be the CL (crazylite) line. Both are very comfortable in my opinion

hockeyplayers,374wks,4dotgov,2,Sun May 24 22:37:46 2015 UTC,"My first time in drop in, I didn't fall at all but kept coming close and regaining my balance. The next week, what a relief to just land on my butt and get back up. I've been getting a lot better since I started."
hockeyplayers,374wks,moorese7en,1 point,Mon May 25 13:53:23 2015 UTC,"Agree with this statement!   If you aren't pushing yourself to do stops, turns, staking backwards, etc., and causing yourself to fall, your  not trying anything new, and not learning a new skill. Try and push harder.  Even learning to get up faster is a great skill, you actually get pretty good after about 3 or 4000 times."
hockeyplayers,374wks,Tools4toys,7,Tue May 26 13:37:52 2015 UTC,"As an absolute beginner, a good way to practice is with roller blades. You can do it anywhere you can find an empty parking lot. You'll build up your stabilizing muscles and work on your balance.  Public skate times are a tough time to practice. I also experienced being the only adult man by himself at the rink , and it can be awkward. The good news is, I guarantee it'll be much freindlier when you get to the point of drop in hockey and sticks and pucks time."

People usually seem a little apprehensive to chat. But usually once I start talking and joking with a big smile on my face they open right up. You'll tend to notice that older hockey players are actually the ones who open up fastest and offer some good advice here and there. A lot of the younger fellers just look down at anyone who doesnt skate like a pro. Keep your head up.

hockeyplayers,374wks,brttpckr,2,Mon May 25 08:05:01 2015 UTC,"Haha don't be afraid about it man! It's gonna happen sooner or later, you pretty much have to lose all sense of shame when learning to skate as an adult. I knocked over about 3 different 6 year old kids last year and two of the times their parents came over and yelled at me for being reckless haha."
hockeyplayers,374wks,brttpckr,4,Mon May 25 13:50:46 2015 UTC,"Congrats! Now your first one is out of the way! Each skate from here on will be slightly better. Note: If you're wearing rental skates they are likely pretty soft and can be really difficult to skate in- (bending at your ankles) while cheap hockey skates aren't ideal- they are worlds better then rentals. Keep practicing. Awesome! Don't worry about the beard, or weird people. Hockey people are awesome!"
hockeyplayers,374wks,skaughtx0r,2,Sun May 24 23:36:27 2015 UTC,"I would second this.  I am also learning to skate, and buying the cheapest skates at Dick's Sports for $40 has been worth it in rental fees and just having skates that are not falling apart.  When the time comes to really play (or if I notice the skates holding me back, which they are definitely not at this point), I figure I can always upgrade then.  Also, I would suggest some elbow pads and possibly shin guards/knee pads to save some bruises and make it easier to go to work the next day."
hockeyplayers,374wks,howtohockeydotcom,1 point,Sun May 24 23:58:00 2015 UTC,"Dude yeah I was having this issue I think. My left skate would more bend to the right than I was expecting. I just thought it was some sort of design for skating appropriately lol  And I'm considering getting skates of my own. Just not sure if I can pay for both skates and lessons unfortunately. Might just get some $40 like Snorlaxsnooz did  Word, yeah I'm not letting it get to myself. Thank you!"
hockeyplayers,374wks,1979_Honda_Accord,5,Mon May 25 07:57:23 2015 UTC,If your local rink offers skating lessons i would highly recommend taking a lesson. But just keep plugging away at it.
hockeyplayers,374wks,Wetmelon,2,Sun May 24 23:37:25 2015 UTC,Yeah I thought maybe I could teach myself using the internet as a resource but I'm starting to see that it'll be better shelling the $150 7 week class.   I talked to the guy at the pro shop and he said after the 7 week program I can sign up for a Rookie Adult league which alternates on practice and game days. So I think it'll work well for me

I started taking lessons in January, mainly to learn how to skate backwards and stop (I could already skate forward pretty well from roller blading when I was a kid). I've already got my 4th game coming up this week in the adult beginner league at my rink. I'm so happy I decided to finally take the plunge and sign up, it was well worth it."

hockeyplayers,373p20,howtohockeydotcom,1 point,Sun May 24 16:13:05 2015 UTC,"Canada dominated the tournament and had a lot of talented players. You can use these extended highlights to analyze positioning and tactics that players use to create scoring chances. Sitting down and watching stuff like this over and over can really help your development.   It's the small things you pick out and notice that you can apply to your own game at the moment. Maybe it's a subtle fake, or the way a player protects the puck.   Dive in and enjoy!"
hockeyplayers,374sj3,FLRangerFan,3,Sun May 24 21:46:42 2015 UTC,Someone from an older post I remember emailed ABHS directly with the same question- They replied that ABHS splits the difference and is between a mid and a low kick point.

hockeyplayers,374sj3,trk1985,2,Mon May 25 01:32:40 2015 UTC,"I have 2 of them, and I'd say the other comment is correct in that its in-between. It feels more like a traditional mid-kick than a fast low-kick. Maybe on par with the Bauer Nexus."
hockeyplayers,374sj3,Hambone76,-4,Mon May 25 01:37:54 2015 UTC,What size are you that you are going with an Int 65flex?
hockeyplayers,374sj3,acholon,2,Sun May 24 22:14:56 2015 UTC,5'4 140lb
hockeyplayers,374sj3,acholon,-1,Mon May 25 05:17:37 2015 UTC,Ok well should be fine in an Int cause you will have to cut it down and raise the flex.
hockeyplayers,374sj3,kingofthediamond,-1,Mon May 25 05:24:01 2015 UTC,second this question.
hockeyplayers,374sj3,Eckolaker,-2,Mon May 25 04:45:39 2015 UTC,65 flex int stick is likely low kick
hockeyplayers,374sj3,kingofthediamond,2,Mon May 25 00:18:41 2015 UTC,The kick point does not refer to the flex of a stick. A mid kick stick you can load up more for a shot. A low kick point works better for a player who uses mostly quick release shots. It's the way the stick is constructed
hockeyplayers,374sj3,Eckolaker,1 point,Mon May 25 01:05:28 2015 UTC,"As FLRangerfan said, the kick point is the position, not the degree of flex. make sure you aren't getting too much flex on a 65 flex before making that decision. Depending on your height as well"
hockeyplayers,374sj3,acholon,-1,Mon May 25 04:47:12 2015 UTC,Very well aware of the difference.  Thanks.  I also own several ABHS sticks and have a fairly decent understanding of their construction..  I suppose I should have included that in my first reply.
hockeyplayers,374sj3,BlazePenguin,-3,Mon May 25 19:55:53 2015 UTC,If you are an adult male who isn't worried about breaking an Int 65 flex I don't think you should worry about kick point.
hockeyplayers,374sj3,acholon,1 point,Mon May 25 04:00:08 2015 UTC,"""adult male"" isn't a size. OP is 140 lbs, 65 flex will be fine."
hockeyplayers,374sj3,NSskier90,-1,Tue May 26 17:28:31 2015 UTC,"My opinion: if you can use a 65flex stick at that size and it doesn't feel whippy and you lose control, you have more to work on than picking the perfect kickpoint."

hockeyplayers,376j22,spartanKid,0,Mon May 25 19:26:11 2015 UTC,"General rule of thumb is when you are sitting down, you measure from the center of knee cap to the top of the skate boot.  I believe there is room for variation in terms of personal preference/feel. As well as how certain shin guards fit in regards to if you tuck your skate tongue or leave it out.  Like anything else in terms of equipment, certain brands are going to fit you personally better than others. I'm 6'2"" and find most Reebok shins in 15"" are perfect. I don't tuck either."

You can definitely change in the fall but if you've already paid for the season take advantage of the better competition as a chance to improve.

hockeyplayers,373sv8,beamseyeview,4,Sun May 24 17:11:52 2015 UTC,"Waxing the stick helps keep your tape a bit longer. Hockey players are lazy fucks too man. If I can do things to do less things, in going to do those things. This is also likely why some of your team dropped off. Every beer league I've played in has like 25 dudes game one. By game 8 we're down to half, and there's usually an iron man or two by the end of the season. Tis the life.  You want good guys on your team. You'll find your game improves significantly season over season playing with guys above your level. You may not see it outright, but play pickup or fill in on a lower level team and you'll notice a difference for sure.  Especially if you wax your stick. /s"
hockeyplayers,373sv8,ciabattabing16,3,Sun May 24 18:04:27 2015 UTC,"This is a common occurrence in about every ""Learn to play"" or ""Low level"" hockey.  I am in a low level hockey league that recently expanded by two teams (6 total teams). At first our league was built on learning the game, drinking beer, and having a few laughs.  We kept score but we didn't want to keep stats.  Our league had a strict ""no ringers rules"".   After the expansion, the league turned very competitive.  The two new teams were made of former higher level players that preferred our time slot. When the other teams saw the level of competition, the teams dropped players that didn't play well and found players that had a higher skill level.  In one season, we had a player break his back after a check from behind, another player break his femur after a hip check, and many many concussions.    When one of the teams went to speak the league commissioner about the level of play, the league commissioner shrugged and said ""I don't care as long as they pay."""
hockeyplayers,373sv8,iambeaker,1 point,Sun May 24 17:39:38 2015 UTC,"I dont plan on quiting...yet. I'm just a little frustrated. Theres no beginner leagues around here, and no beginner classes so the only option i have is this low level game. There are beer leagues here that these guys would fit into, dont know why they chose low level. Nobody helps me out, actually nobody seems to talk to anybody,even in the dressing room. I played a pickup game with a bunch of strangers and tried to make conversation and they didnt respond. oh well. I may try to organize my own game in the fall as well as some pickup."
hockeyplayers,373sv8,Nikolaoss,2,Sun May 24 17:50:04 2015 UTC,"Sounds like it's not about the level, but more you have an issue with the people not being social.. I've played in lower level and now play div3 in a 10 div league.. People always talked.. I've never heard of people just not talking to each other.   Also, as much as its frustrating, even in lower level leagues there will be people way better than you. The skill gap in beginner leagues is insane, because, for example in Ottawa, most beginners who never touched a puck could skate fast since we have the canal. I skated circles around people in my beginner pickup league, but I didn't know what to do when I touched the puck, or positioning, or rules, etc. You'll always get better when you play with better people, also."
hockeyplayers,373sv8,howtohockeydotcom,2,Sun May 24 20:20:14 2015 UTC,Just embrace the suck for now. Work on your own stuff during warm up and make the most of it. You'll get better
hockeyplayers,373sv8,Walbeb24,2,Sun May 24 18:26:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah I've found the beginner leagues are the worst. The bad teams can't go any further down and the better teams in the lowest level leagues are too bad to move up but way too good for the worst teams.(if that makes any sense)  I would try to make as many stick puck times and get some pick up games in to develop. Or find an over 40 league, they may be better but I'd imagine it's not as competitive."
hockeyplayers,373sv8,Leftwithnocookies,2,Sun May 24 19:24:44 2015 UTC,are these experienced players helping you or hindering. By that i mean do they provide advice or do they get mad when you mess up. If they are helping you out then i would say stay unless you can find a better option for learning. You can learn alot from these guys and with time you can improve. If you work on your skating on your own and use the games to improve your technical skills then you could easily improve within a year or two. If they are being assholes then maybe look for somewhere else.
hockeyplayers,373sv8,i_yac,1 point,Sun May 24 20:38:14 2015 UTC,"I wouldnt say they are assholes,well mabey they are in the fact that they are much better than this league is all about.  they just skate circles around me. They dont offer much help. I should clarify that this league im in is more like a pickup game with a ref. they dont keep score or stats. the reason is that way the game doesnt get too competitive. i also think the ref is there to keep an eye on things as far as skill level goes also. i dont see them telling the guys to play down or leave as we only have mabey 1 or 2 guys sitting on the bench during a game. theres a guy that may be in his 60's and he takes a little more time on the bench and i seen a guy mabey in his 20's get upset that he had to stay out because he was tired.its too bad i dont have more options,not much in this town. i think im going to try to start my own game in the fall and keep it LOW LEVEL lol."

I think the key is that the lowest level is small (3 teams of about 9 to 10 players each) and there are two levels above mine.  There is definitely no one in the league that I am in who I would consider fast, although some are definitely more proficient than others.

hockeyplayers,373sv8,AviateAndNavigate,1 point,Mon May 25 01:05:19 2015 UTC,"I would say keep at it. I am 47 and just started playing last year. I broke my leg in a game on December 7th and started skating again in February. I have been playing ""drop-in"" hockey since then and just signed up for the summer league. I am ready to go, but I have to admit it has been a humbling journey.   This time a year ago I put on hockey gear for the first time every and went out to stick time. Holy smokes did I suck. They guys were not exactly welcoming, but they didn't run me off either. I kept at it and played our local league last year. Southern Oregon is not a hotbed for hockey so we only have four teams. There are definitely some guys with skill, though, as some of them played Junior or College Hockey. The guys quickly recognized that I did not exactly have any skill at all. But my team-mates were all positive and kept encouraging me. By some fluke I even scored a goal. My season ended early due to the broken leg (I fell badly after a collision), so I watched a lot of videos on positioning, etc. Now that I have been playing again for a couple of months I feel like I am getting better. I still can't shoot to save my life, but my positioning is better and my skating is a lot better. Heck I even won a puck battle the other night and set up another guy for a score. To even think that I would win a puck battle six months ago would have been out of the question. Usually I just fell on my butt.   I guess I am saying all of this to say that this has been a really hard and humbling year, but I don't think there is any other way. Hockey is not an easy sport to learn, let alone master. But if you love it you should keep doing it and just focus on your own progress. I just try to get a little better every time. In reality it has been 2 steps forward 1 step back, but sometimes it feels like 1 step forward and 2 back. I know I am a better player today than I was a year ago and I bet I will be better a year from now. Most of the more experienced players are friendly and encouraging to me now. Maybe you just have to show them that you are going to stick around. I have seen other new guys step on the ice and I have seen them disappear. I think they are really missing out. It is hard, humbling and sometimes humiliating, but through it all I just absolutely love it. My only regret is that I did not start at three years old.  If you love it then keep playing."

hockeyplayers,373wg5,teachzim,2,Sun May 24 17:16:00 2015 UTC,Easton is about to release their new CX line of sticks. Prices have already gone down on the current velocity series and some synergy sticks. Keep an eye out and more sales on the older models will probably come once CX drops.
hockeyplayers,373wg5,FLRangerFan,1 point,Sun May 24 18:14:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah I always buy last year's models in July/August before the season starts. I've purchased sticks that were top of the line for $140 this way. If I shop at total hockey, I bring in a broken stick and get $10-20 off depending on if they have a promo"
hockeyplayers,373wg5,RydogMcNastypants,2,Sun May 24 21:24:46 2015 UTC,"August/September is when the new models come out, the pro shop at the rink I used to  work out would get 2 huge shipments around that time and that is when the previous models would go on sale."
hockeyplayers,373wg5,plumpilicious,1 point,Sun May 24 23:24:37 2015 UTC,"You just have to be diligent. Sometimes you will find a huge clearance, like the amazon fire sale. Usually around april is when they release new sticks so you can get the older ones on sale. Look at other sporting good stores which usually dont follow MAP (even though they are supposed to) so you can use extra coupons. Look in your LHS for much older models you can get for cheap  I know a guy at hockey monkey and they usually give you like a mako and a warrior diablo or those types of sticks. the curves may be different than what youre used to but the sticks are decent."
hockeyplayers,373wg5,kingofthediamond,1 point,Sun May 24 17:35:05 2015 UTC,"I picked up a few sticks from the Anaheim Ducks team store. Pro stock for $25, unbelievable. Usually they have signed sticks for $100+ but these appeared to be some kind of surplus. That was pure luck though, and they only had lefties. Might be worth a try."
hockeyplayers,373wg5,delarhi,1 point,Sun May 24 22:12:25 2015 UTC,"The closest pro team here has an annual 'garage sale', and clear out anything left over, including sticks, a family member picked up some new gloves from a player who was traded, and 2 sticks from a very well know player for $100 each - not they have to decide if they want to use them or just keep them.   The local NAHL team just had their sale, and sold 1 and 2 piece sticks for $30-$40, and they used decent sticks - the rest of the equipment, not really that high of quality.    The best part, is I'm a leftie, and for some reason, there aren't many US lefties, so I had a good selection of sticks."

hockeyplayers,373wg5,JAOOB,1 point,Mon May 25 07:59:09 2015 UTC,Are you near an NHL team? I know the Canucks have a used equipment sale and picking up pro-stock sticks is fairly (not always) affordable. Wouldn't be surprised if other teams do this too.
hockeyplayers,373wg5,WiFiForeheadWrinkles,1 point,Thu May 28 23:45:14 2015 UTC,Well... they are still playing!! So I doubt they will be selling any equipment anytime soon (hopefully another 2 weeks or so...Lol)  Go Blackhawks!! I'll check after the parade...but I'm sure Cup winning teams gear might be a little higher $... #NoJinks!! Lol.
hockeyplayers,373wg5,Djarum,1 point,Fri May 29 02:39:41 2015 UTC,Sadly the Blackhawks don't have a equipment sale anymore. They sell stuff at the convention but it is all jacked way up in price and sold as collector stuff.   I know that Rockford still has equipment sales but it was about 2 weeks ago. Also occasionally stuff leaks out via equipment managers to local beer league teams but that is ever dying up. The curse of being successful.

hockeyplayers,36zz7y,aradil,3,Sat May 23 16:55:34 2015 UTC,"I've had nets with mesh like that ended up basically dangling threads it had so many holes. And that was when I was still in high school over a decade ago.  My parents were pissed because pucks were going through the net and destroying the latticework under their deck.  I also had a wooden home made net for a while that had good high quality mesh... I'll never forget snapping a board off bar down.  In any case, the first time you do anything like that is a milestone you normally don't forget. A buddy of mine exploded a puck with a clapper a few months back. I'd never even heard of that happening."

The learning curve is steep.  It's crazy how the smallest changes will throw off the aim significantly.   I have a stack of 15 pucks, and I'm lucky if 3 of them hit their mark.   But I'm seeing improvement, and enjoying the challenge!"

hockeyplayers,371a5s,plumpilicious,1 point,Sun May 24 00:27:55 2015 UTC,Definitely check out the GSHL. It's a surprisingly big league with multiple divisions and skill levels. They have a day at the beginning of the season where they scrimmage and place you in one of the divisions based on your skill level.
hockeyplayers,371gjg,ludo_kressh,9,Sat May 23 23:50:03 2015 UTC,It took me a while to piece together what was wrong in the photos: that the blade holder isn't centered properly on the skates. I checked the pictures against my own skates (Bauer nexus 400s) and mine are perfectly centered. I'd try to exchange them for a new pair.
hockeyplayers,371gjg,trapasaurusnex,4,Sun May 24 00:21:29 2015 UTC,"Yes. Exchange them. I don't skate in Bauers, so I'm not sure if you make a direct warranty claim with them, or if your LHS will handle the leg work. Take them back and see what they say. Either way, you have a warranty claim that will get you new skates."
hockeyplayers,371gjg,OzziePao13,1 point,Sun May 24 01:32:00 2015 UTC,100% that's a defect. Swap them for a new pair (and if they're not apologetic or give you a hard time I would give your LHS shit for not checking them for you - that's part of the reason you shop bricks and mortar and not online!)

hockeyplayers,370ylp,chenac,2,Tue May 26 15:41:47 2015 UTC,"I'm assuming you're referring to a half-Bosu, like this? I would definitely try incorporating it into your stability exercises. Try doing squats on the flat portion (Bosu-side down) while holding a medicine ball. Or, if you have a workout partner, have them throw a medicine ball at/around you (up high, down low, to the side, etc.) for you to catch, stay stable, and throw back. Makes it pretty fun, too.    You might also try strengthening your hips, since they're important for stability. Simple abductor and adductor exercises can be done with cables."
hockeyplayers,370xax,1966mopar,3,Sat May 23 20:57:49 2015 UTC,"The lower levels of hockey are the hardest to ref, as you really need to understand if something is a penalty. This is the age that kids will cry if you call the penalty on them. The referee at this age can also be someone who is a coach to both teams, helping the kids understand the rules. I'd honestly advise you to leave it to people who are familiar with the game and have more to give. It will be a better experience for all involved.   Also, enjoy being a hockey parent, these years will fly behind you before you even know it."
hockeyplayers,370xax,EnsErmac,1 point,Sat May 23 23:06:53 2015 UTC,Ya it's still up in the air. I know in my son's tyke league they don't call penalties. If they see something they don't like they talk to the coach. If it still goes on then I guess a penalty. Honestly in his league it hasn't happened. But mabey your right. Mabey I'll just focus on my son
hockeyplayers,370xax,unusedusername3,1 point,Sun May 24 00:48:03 2015 UTC,What's a tyke? Is that a different term for mini mite (4-5 year olds)? I reff'ed that age. They played the short way across the rink 2 or 3 games at a time. Mostly I just dropped the puck and encouraged the kids. I needed to be certified to do this. I wore the same uniform as the older kid games.
hockeyplayers,370xax,shelvedtopcheese,1 point,Sun May 24 22:58:01 2015 UTC,"I disagree with the other guy about the lower levels of hockey being the hardest to ref, but I also advise against it for a different reason.  A year of hockey experience is probably not enough skating experience. You have to be a very controlled skater because falling on kids that age is very dangerous for both of you.   It ultimately depends on the rink's programming and whatever training is offered though."
hockeyplayers,370a49,Top_rattata,2,Sat May 23 17:44:26 2015 UTC,"No, they'll be gone after you get them sharpened. Those happen to everyone, you shouldn't be too worried unless there's actually a chunk missing from your blade."

Sharpening will fix it though, and it doesn't look too deep.   Your skates are low-end and the steel is too, so this kind of thing will happen pretty often if you use them a lot."

I've been a team captain in other sports and I always approached struggling players with ""how do you think you've been doing recently?"" That frames the conversation better than ""hey you're not playing good, you should drop down"". Ask him if there's anything the team can do to help improve his play.  You could always ask him to drop down a league and I know it will be a hard thing to ask, but you also have to remember that you've got an entire team to consider. It sucks, but you may have to make a decision that is best for the group but may hurt your goalie. Being in a leadership role really sucks somtimes :(."

hockeyplayers,36vyy4,jjdwjr,7,Sun May 24 23:01:59 2015 UTC,"That is the job of a captain. He probably knows he shouldn't be on the team anymore, but until someone reinforces that he will stick around. Just be straight with the guy and tell him that a few of the players have been hinting about getting a new goalie and that you tend to agree. Maybe help the guy find a  new squad first so he isn't left out to dry with no team to play for. It is sad but even though Adult leagues aren't very competitive, it still sucks to never have a fighting chance due to one player. It's not fair for the rest of the team who paid and shows up every week just to lose."
hockeyplayers,36vyy4,-warmblood,1 point,Fri May 22 20:10:12 2015 UTC,Yeah. Your last point is totally legit. I'll suck it up.
hockeyplayers,36vyy4,Invictavis,3,Fri May 22 21:11:28 2015 UTC,"Depends on whether or not you agree with your team about this goalie they don't like. Answer that for yourself first.  Leadership is all about having a gut feeling or educated guess about what's good for everyone and motivating people to join you in achieving that. If you believe the goalie needs a chance but your team does not, the good captain thing to do is to make your case by motivating everyone to start backchecking better instead of pointing fingers at the netty."
hockeyplayers,36vyy4,redslate,2,Fri May 22 20:06:53 2015 UTC,Oh he's terrible. No doubt. But super nice and lives to play. I know he doesn't have a whole helluva lot going on in the rest of his life. This is going to suck.
hockeyplayers,36vyy4,Zednix,4,Fri May 22 21:10:01 2015 UTC,"It's absolutely your job. I've been a captain (albeit in varsity soccer and football) and I can tell you firsthand that the decision has to come from you.   Generally, people think that wearing the 'C' is to enjoy its many perks without any negative aspects whatsoever. This isn't true, as you've been designated the captain because you've been deemed responsible enough to make the hard and often ""dickish"" decisions. If you think he can't keep up and that he would be better off in a lower league, then talk to him one-on-one and break it to him. If you think it's unwarranted, then talk to the people complaining and explain to them why its a workable situation.  Important thing to remember is that you're going to have to confront people and make a choice that won't please everyone."
hockeyplayers,36vyy4,redslate,4,Fri May 22 19:09:06 2015 UTC,"The only perk of being captain has been harassing grown men to pay their rink bill before the office manager calls in a collection agency. That, and now being asked to fire the goalie. But yeah, point taken. I'll do what needs to be done."
hockeyplayers,36vyy4,Skyline_BNR34,2,Fri May 22 21:07:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah it's a pretty thankless job in adult league. I've had almost no perks except that everyone looks to me for organizing shit and leadership, if you consider those perks. I got one guy complaining about paying to sub because someone else already paid for that spot and he's just filling in. The thing is, that sub money doesn't just go to a black box. It goes toward covering the two spots I paid for (to fill our team fee without needing to roster 16 people) and any extra will be put towards team party or team fees next season. It blows having to manage all this shit and  deal with player complaints, but hey, without us, there'd be no team, right?"
hockeyplayers,36vyy4,dazosan,2,Sat May 23 03:15:05 2015 UTC,"I think if you guys are getting bombed for 5+ goals that it might be time to move the entire team down a div unless its one of those situations where the goalie just can't buy a save.  The people who are voicing their complaints want to win, because that is way more fun then getting destroyed constantly, I understand that point of view. I complained about a pair of players we picked up new this year that were way out of their element and should be looking at bottom div or adult learning leagues. Nothing was done during the season, but how can you just kick a guy who paid for full time status on the team right?   Well, I understand that shit costs money and its hard to kick a guy off the team. I told my cap, also the guy who runs the team, that I wouldn't return next season if the two guys were around. I played 80% of the season on a line with one of them and it was awful. I didn't like going to games because of how bad it was getting. If the other team didn't score on a shift it was a good shift, pretty low standards for fun.   We do a summer BBQ get together and figure out who is leaving or is retiring and figure out what we need to fill spots. I hope things will be sorted after that. I don't envy the Captain's job, telling people they aren't good enough is a hard thing to do."

hockeyplayers,36sufe,forsbergisgod,7,Thu May 21 21:06:10 2015 UTC,"Yes, absolutely. Go on r/fitness and read the faq, get on a basic strength program and take it from there."
hockeyplayers,36sufe,thirdmanin,3,Thu May 21 21:10:16 2015 UTC,"Definitely. 5 months is over 20 weeks, you could make some measurable gains during that time. Focus on lower body and core strength. Lifting weights will make you stronger, agility training will make you more explosive. I recommend doing some of both."

hockeyplayers,36sufe,shelvedtopcheese,2,Thu May 21 22:58:17 2015 UTC,"Box jumps, lateral footwork, inclined sprints, one footed step ups, etc.   Any kind of dry land work where the focus is on short bursts of speed and quickness. It helps you to build those fast twitch muscles you need to accelerate and change direction quickly. It can also be beneficial for your balance because you strengthen those smaller muscles that maybe don't get used very often otherwise."
hockeyplayers,36sufe,nolovedeepmeta,2,Fri May 22 00:52:37 2015 UTC,Here's a hockey workout to help with explosive/agility training as well. Try it on your off days.
hockeyplayers,36sufe,cgibsong002,2,Fri May 22 13:06:21 2015 UTC,"Depends on exactly what your goals are. 99% of people who train really have no goal, no plan, and get limited results. Simply going to the gym and lifting will NOT do much for you. If you want to gain significant strength, you must bulk. If you're trying to get lighter and stronger, ain't gonna happen. That said you can still get stronger while also improving your endurance and getting in better shape.  Especially for a sport though, your nutrition is going to have to be on point. You're going to need a precise bulk to minimize fat gain to stay in as good of shape as possible. Aim for half a pound per week over about 3 months. Do it right, stick to your dietary goals.. you should easily put on 5 pounds of muscle with minimal fat gain. Take those remaining 2 months to cut back down a few pounds and shift to working on your cardio and agility while retaining your muscle.  As recommended by others, get on a legit workout program. Starting Strength (Rippetoe) is a good one for you as it will incorporate squats 3x per week. Will be the biggest shortcut to strength. It's not a routine designed for bodybuilding, but purely for strength gains."

hockeyplayers,36sufe,orionthefisherman,1 point,Thu May 21 21:43:25 2015 UTC,"You can absolutely improve your game in that time. Get a hockey specific workout though. Also, for just a rec player there are some exercises you might avoid. If you don't have a good trainer then any type of clean probably isnt a good idea. It takes a long time to learn that exercise, which isn't hockey specific, and carries a higher probability of injury for a beginner. Also, keep in mind that upper body strength is of limited use, unless (to badly misquote Sean prongers book journeyman) your job on the ice is to punch people in the face, which I doubt. Personally I do lots of core work and single leg movements. Latteral and crossover agility drills are good too."

hockeyplayers,36riy1,Turbosandslipangles,6,Thu May 21 19:36:01 2015 UTC,Check the discussion on r/rollerblading.  The biggest point brought up in the thread is what happens when load is applied.
hockeyplayers,36riy1,russharv9,4,Thu May 21 16:05:50 2015 UTC,"Exactly. I did this once with my skateboard bearings. Washed them out with kerosene and used dry graphite to lubricate them. I never tried it again.  Without a load they spin forever and it's very impressive. On a skateboard with me riding, they'd roll like any other bearing except for the fact that they'd wear out extremely quickly due to metal on metal contact in the bearing race. Without oil to seal the shields, large sand particles easily make their way inside the bearing case, pitting and ruining the finish of the balls and races. The friction heat that was generated in these bearings (which oil usually helps to manage) broke down the shields and cages and the balls would just fall out. It literally destroyed my bearings after a few hard skates.  This is pretty common knowledge for skaters of all varieties. I was young and discovered it for myself. That article is not helpful and it's puzzling that someone found it novel enough to publish. Not sure if you can trust them on any engineering information if this is the kind of thing that makes it in print."
hockeyplayers,36riy1,-warmblood,1 point,Thu May 21 19:16:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the guys over there raise good points.  Still, this is something I want to try out myself once this becomes a commercial product."
hockeyplayers,36riy1,scotttech1,3,Thu May 21 16:16:30 2015 UTC,"wait, would I just fall all the time in a friction free environment? or is ""friction free"" a marketing term for low friction?"
hockeyplayers,36riy1,scotttech1,2,Thu May 21 15:59:04 2015 UTC,"I guess you can think of friction free in discrete terms where there's still friction, but it's so low, it's well below some epsilon.  Besides, even if the ball bearings were truly frictionless, you're still going to have friction from the rubber of the wheels contacting the floor."
hockeyplayers,36riy1,scotttech1,2,Thu May 21 16:11:13 2015 UTC,"but they are allegedly going to roll 10x more, it seems like going from conventional to low friction bearings would be like walking on a rubber mat with skates to stepping on fresh ice, or worse no?"
hockeyplayers,36riy1,RegisteredSock,1 point,Thu May 21 17:16:20 2015 UTC,"If you're rolling, there will be less friction, but, as we learned from Mitch Hedberg, polyurethane wheels grip.  We'll be moving closer to ice, but I don't think we'll get there fully until we change the materials used to make the wheels themselves."
hockeyplayers,36riy1,RegisteredSock,2,Thu May 21 18:31:00 2015 UTC,hmmm

hockeyplayers,36siou,Zinjifrah,7,Thu May 21 19:42:29 2015 UTC,"Speaking as a relative noob: The one move that has consistently worked for me while I try to get more comfortable out there is to move a little laterally as I get to the defender and pull the puck to either side, but to the extreme end of that side. Get it away from the defender and shield it with your body. If it's to my backhand I'll pull my bottom hand off the stick and use it to help shield. You may not be able to blow past him but you can at least buy some time to curl back, look for a pass, whatever. Usually my best option out of that is to curl out and hit a trailing player. But if you find yourself with a step on him use that body position and start pumping your feet and get to the net.  EDIT: /u/dazosan and I are saying the same thing. He just did so much more eloquently. Nice to see a noob and a vet are on the same page here. Do what he's saying."
hockeyplayers,36siou,frosty_biscuits,3,Thu May 21 19:51:33 2015 UTC,Pro tip! Take your top hand off the stick on your forehand and control the puck with just your bottom hand.
hockeyplayers,36siou,pbs094,4,Fri May 22 09:43:21 2015 UTC,"It's the simplest move in the world but it's also the most effective: pull the puck to the outside and just turn on the jets coming across the blue line. Guard the puck with your body and you've got a really good chance of getting down towards the circles with either an option to pass, come down behind the net, or if you're lucky you can find a lane to cut to the middle.   Edit: And don't forget you can always look back to the points! Your d-man will love you."
hockeyplayers,36siou,dazosan,3,Thu May 21 19:51:24 2015 UTC,To add to this it is the change of speed that makes the difference.  Don't come up to the defender at full speed.  Once you are closer protect the puck and accelerate to full speed.  He probably can't maintain speed in the transition and you have a bit of room once you are around him.
hockeyplayers,36siou,JackEsq,1 point,Thu May 21 20:55:39 2015 UTC,So cross the blue line at 60% and then crank it when you see him slow down?
hockeyplayers,36siou,Lndbrghwrstlr,2,Fri May 22 14:21:03 2015 UTC,"His speed doesn't really matter, the point is he is trying to match your speed and then you suddenly go faster. He will be caught flat footed and probably try to go from backward skating to forward. By that time you will be a step or two ahead giving you space."
hockeyplayers,36siou,JackEsq,1 point,Fri May 22 14:33:30 2015 UTC,"Sweet, thanks!"
hockeyplayers,36siou,Lndbrghwrstlr,3,Fri May 22 14:37:52 2015 UTC,I was going to say exactly this. You don't need super speed to go around the outside. It is all about strength and body position.  This move will also draw a lot of penalties. As the D-man turns there is a good chance you will have position on him and he will try to hook or hold you so no scoring chance but drawing a penalty is also good.
hockeyplayers,36siou,somewhat_random,1 point,Thu May 21 20:47:11 2015 UTC,"this. This shit right here. Literally my go to everytime i hit the offensive zone. Slide down to the corner, hit the Dman, behind the net,throw it out front."
hockeyplayers,36siou,NoClue22,2,Fri May 22 02:21:45 2015 UTC,"Instead of coming up the middle, come up the side and soft chip the puck around the defender. If you are big enough, blow through him by squeezing between him and the boards, or go around him to the outside.   You do not have to worry about handling the puck around him, just have to pick it up on the other side."
hockeyplayers,36siou,tehReno,2,Thu May 21 21:09:11 2015 UTC,"A simple pass to yourself off the boards. It is situational, if you overuse it everyone will know it is coming...but if there is decent open ice in front of you and an anxious forward trying to pressure you, a simple pass to yourself off the boards can make the guy look stupid in a hurry.   If he hasn't learned, do it again. After that you bought yourself some space the next time you carry out because he'll have to back off a little."
hockeyplayers,36siou,ICEYSports,2,Thu May 21 21:39:43 2015 UTC,"Thanks, lots of good thoughts here. I'll definitely try using the boards/outside more.  In stick and puck last night I did manage a self pass off the boards and then a little chip over the defender stick. Not sure if those would have worked in the league game.  I'll give the outside thing a shot!"
hockeyplayers,36siou,IndependentBoof,2,Thu May 21 22:35:12 2015 UTC,"I'm a similarly (lack of)-skilled guy. I'm a defenseman but creating turnovers is my specialty so I lead a lot of counterattacks. I don't have very good puck handling skills but I manage to get past a fair number of players with one simple trick:   pay attention to the defender's direction of motion and body position... and then go in the opposite direction. Sometimes fake the direction he's going first and then sweep it across to the other side.    That's it. That's 75% of my moves (the rest is just playing it off the boards or the sneakiest move of all: forgetting the puck behind you while you continue to go on the attack without it).  Just practice making wide movements (moving from your furthest reach on the backhand to the furthest reach forehand, and back). If you can do that under control, you can get past most C-league players."
hockeyplayers,36siou,el_karacho,1 point,Thu May 21 23:10:46 2015 UTC,"Gonna continue the sentiment of move the puck to the outside and protect with your body.  I'm not a particularly skilled stickhandler (working on it though) but I am somewhat of an immovable object.  All of my points come from taking the puck towards the circles from the blue line and either shooting, or using the net to pick my defender and then finding my center's stick (or drawing the opposing winger down to dump it to my point man) as I loop around the net.  I don't draw many penalties because I'm a big guy and diving is for sissies, but smaller people would draw a lot in my position."
hockeyplayers,36siou,themaincop,1 point,Thu May 21 20:59:43 2015 UTC,"Just wanted to add that a lot of guys will tell you not to try anything fancy until you're OVER the blue line, the chance of a bad turnover really cranks if you try to get too cute in the neutral zone.  Unless you're certain that you outskill the opponent it's probably better to make the safe play.  That being said, howtohockey.com had a sweet deke of the week video series a while back, and Pavel Barber has some great deke tutorials as well."
hockeyplayers,36tbrn,summoz,4,Thu May 21 23:17:35 2015 UTC,"I'll go against the grain and say the ""soft hands"" idea of receiving a pass is outdated now with all the composite sticks now. (Another thing on my hockey list of bullshit) Just use firm grip on the stick and catch/cup the puck. Don't try to cushion it, just stop the puck, the stick will ""cushion"" it for you. Just get your stick blade perpendicular to the path of the puck. Have you ever tried receiving a pass with one hand? Easiest way to receive a pass.   If you watch an NHL game, all you'll hear is the loud THWAP, THWAP, THWAP after every pass because they don't cushion the puck, they just stop the puck and continue stickhandling."
hockeyplayers,36tbrn,sterlingarcher0069,2,Fri May 22 03:39:09 2015 UTC,"I've started to notice this myself, if you have your blade at the right angle you can use the ""rebound"" to your advantage and have it bounce just a little ahead of you and take it from there."
hockeyplayers,36tbrn,Lndbrghwrstlr,1 point,Fri May 22 14:23:16 2015 UTC,Just curious what else do you consider on your list of Hockey BS?
hockeyplayers,36tbrn,Tavisss,1 point,Fri May 29 06:18:17 2015 UTC,"Take the pass on a 2 on 1.  Then what? The shooter knows you're going to take the pass, he's going to have all the time in the world to do whatever he wants. Instead of a 2 on 1, you're giving up a breakaway. Instead, be aggressive with the shooter. Make the shooter make the perfect pass, under pressure, around you on to the stick of his teammate before his teammate reaches the net and runs out of room for a one-timer that your goalie is going to see and make a read on a mile away. Sounds a lot harder than taking the pass and giving him a breakaway. You're being aggressive for the same reason football teams blitz the QB. Force a mistake or a shit play from the offence. If the shooter shoots a weak shot, that's a win.  Always have 2 hands on the stick.  Unless you're playing defensively, or skating without the puck. Which will end up being 95% of the time. You only really need two hands on your stick: receiving a pass, making a pass, stickhandling, shooting/dump-ins.  Never up the middle  I kinda agree with this one but if the other team sends 2 to forecheck, they're going to be on you and the strong side forward which leaves no one open and a pointman holding the line if you try to put it off the glass. If the C knows what he's doing and comes down low and patient like he's supposed to on a breakout, then sending an easy pass to him up the middle is sometimes the best option on a breakout."
hockeyplayers,36tbrn,sterlingarcher0069,1 point,Fri May 29 07:28:01 2015 UTC,"Take the pass on a 2 on 1.   Depends. I pretend to pressure the shooter but drift over to the open man. I do this to make the shooter choose a shooting option in tight and trust that my goalie prepares for this with me.   Always have 2 hands on the stick.   I kind of follow this rule but a different reason. I'd rather identify when to use one hand. I take advantage of alot of bounces by having two hands on my stick more often. I hate when coaches make the rule gospel though   Never up the middle   Right with you on this rule. Never up the middle is a bad thing to teach because like you said the pass can be there, and I'd want my defensemen to learn how to make that play, even if they turn it over a couple times whilst learning it."
hockeyplayers,36tbrn,Tavisss,3,Fri May 29 20:48:40 2015 UTC,"You need to absorb the energy of the puck and cradle it so it doesn't bounce. Think of it like taking a soccer ball to the chest. If you are too rigid, the ball will bounce far away. To take the pass, you need to absorb the energy so it rests where you want it to."
hockeyplayers,36tbrn,iRageWin,2,Thu May 21 23:42:18 2015 UTC,"I kind of understand that but watch countless hours of NHL daily and i don't know if i'm missing something but i see them have a rigid stick.. In other words, i don't see them ""absorb"" the energy so to speak."
hockeyplayers,36tbrn,funkyb,3,Thu May 21 23:48:25 2015 UTC,"They absorb it, but they do it much, much quicker than you or I.  Like everything else in the pro game, it's hard to see the intricacies in real time.  iRageWin is absolutely correct that you need to absorb some of the energy by slowing the puck more gradually."
hockeyplayers,36tbrn,funkyb,2,Fri May 22 00:10:03 2015 UTC,"Ok great, well at least i know to work on absorption now.  Would it just be a simple case of quickly pulling your blade back, just enough so the puck isn't going to hit just a solid wall (blade)?"

hockeyplayers,36tbrn,apbenoit,2,Fri May 22 00:43:19 2015 UTC,"Are you sure the length/lie of your stick is right for you? If your blade isn't resting flat on the ice (it can be tough to tell), then it's hard to catch a pass.   I also agree with what the other guy said about absorbing the energy of the puck. That doesn't necessarily mean you have to slide your stick 3 feet, trying to slow the puck gently to a full stop (a lot of times coaches or tutorials will exaggerate the movement for illustrative purposes). A quick flick of your wrists is the most effective way to do this."

Intermediate because it wasn't as tall as the seniors, 3) it felt good in my hands (the shapes of shafts was another thing--some are just too square), 4) curve.    Curve didn't really matter to me, hence the reason it was last and I was just starting.  I ended up with a Datsyuk because I once borrowed a friends and it simply felt right.

hockeyplayers,36qv77,ciabattabing16,2,Thu May 21 13:46:09 2015 UTC,No damage to the plastic and to protect the blade the best thing you could do for it is dry it immediately when it comes out of the mix and spray it down with WD-40. This will keep it from rusting till you use them again. I've never had problems with vinegar before as long as it's diluted.
hockeyplayers,36qv77,ciabattabing16,3,Thu May 21 16:56:01 2015 UTC,"Step 1: Freeze the skates.  Overnight or for a weekend should do it.  Step 2: Thaw and dry.  If they're still a bit funky, try some white vinegar.  It's step 2 because you may smell like vinegar for a bit.  The stink is from either bacteria or mold.  Both of these things will kill it with no permanent effect on the skate.  I'd pop the soles out and check the base rivets though, just to see if anything is rusted through.  You can usually lose a few without issue, but if the right sequence of rivets slams loose, you're going down."

I actually think you turn your skates a little past perpendicular and they'll start moving ""backward"" in relation to the toe. At that point they start cutting back toward your body and you've just looped the direction from forward to backward and pivoted. Finish with a solid stepover and you're in business."

I've been crossing over on the weak side around the face off circles for as long as I can and that's helped. Honestly, you just have to practice but you'll get them soon enough.

hockeyplayers,36nooj,JGreenberg11,1 point,Fri May 22 03:27:21 2015 UTC,"When I started 3 and a half years ago, I could only turn, stop, crossover and pivot on one side. Now that I'm pretty much good with all areas my best tip would be go around the circles in your weak direction for a long time just doing crossover after crossover. My personal coach would have me do this forever. (Personal coach was former Winnipeg Jet, Minnesota North Star and St. Louis Blue, John Markell.)"
hockeyplayers,36nooj,ezeeetm,1 point,Sun May 24 06:23:06 2015 UTC,"I had the same problem.  Do outside edge drills (youtube).  Also I found the under foot needs to be actively pushing.  Its not just coasting while the other foot crosses over...then it has no bite and you collapse.  When you actively push just a little with the under foot on that outside edge, it will start to break through for you."
hockeyplayers,36nzhq,bockey1,5,Wed May 20 19:46:15 2015 UTC,"Just as a teacher myself (Physical Education) These things are key: Always plan more then you think you need. Some things/drills will go quicker then you think, others won't- if you over plan you'll be able to switch gears quickly and move on to something else.  Plan for multiple skill levels... Something you might think is easy, might need a little more work/time for these kids or vice versa.  Break stuff down before you try and teach it. So you know how to answer questions or to show them a simple reminder... less steps for younger kids, more clear steps for older kids. (use ""descriptive reminder"" words or key words- ""rip"" the ice is better then ""skate"" or ""push"" they will listen for that sound and remember it. When doing a C cut you should hear a ""RIP""...""Did you hear the RIP in the ice?"" Show fun. Be loud. Be energetic. Smile.  Not sure how long this camp is- but a good rule of thumb for discipline is to be kinda tough at first and have set expectations- Be ON time, Don't talk when coach is talking, no grabass...etc. To try and be their buddy right off the bat will be tough to reign in later.  (for a summer camp I wouldn't expect too many problems like that, but good to think ahead...what would your penalty be if they screwed up? those kind of things.  Good luck man! I would love to teach a hockey summer camp!"

hockeyplayers,36nzhq,ZapfBrannigan,2,Thu May 21 00:40:00 2015 UTC,"I coached Mites (~8 under) for the first time this past year and had a blast. A couple take-away points that I have for moving into next year:  - Set up drills so there is active competition. If there is a winner at the end of the drill, the kids worked a lot harder and didn't just go through the motions.  - Chaos drills are fun. One that worked well was to give each kid a puck in the faceoff circle and say the winner is the last one whose puck doesn't leave the circle. While keeping their puck safe, they still needed to do everything they can to knock the other kids' pucks out.  - Sharks and Minnows is a necessity even probably up to the 10 year old range. Make sure they don't dive into the boards and try to mix it up. We did some games where they could only skate backwards, only turn to the right, etc.  - Relay races worked great for working on specific skating/handling skills as well as being able to group kids versus ability.  I also recommend smiling and being energetic. The kids feed off of the enthusiasm. Be loud, enthusiastic, and encouraging. Also, those blue pucks are a lot easier to lift and bounce a lot!"

hockeyplayers,36ogh9,kriskringle19,7,Wed May 20 21:41:43 2015 UTC,"It USUALLY means you need more knee bend for that leg that's using the outside edge. See the image below.

hockeyplayers,36ogh9,lostincbus,3,Wed May 20 22:42:25 2015 UTC,"I'm going to echo more knee bend, but also recommend that you lean out of the turn a little bit to keep your center of gravity more over top of your edges. If you don't have any weight over your edges, they won't have any force pushing them down into the ice, so they'll just slip. Very counter intuitive, so it's a very common mistake among beginners. Experiment keeping your inside shoulder high and see if you can feel your skate get more bite."
hockeyplayers,36ogh9,bravochar,2,Thu May 21 03:39:13 2015 UTC,This is great advice too. The lean and trust for your outside edges is super important too. There are some great tutorials on improving outside edge work on here if you search.

hockeyplayers,36mjro,stevetehpirate,2,Wed May 20 23:15:23 2015 UTC,"I've heard Graf footbeds are amazing, but I have not tried them.  I have yellow superfeet and I love them. They're a very firm insole with moderate support. No extra cushion anywhere (although why do you want that in skates?). Some people complain that the ""arch"" support doesn't line up with their arches in the recommended sizes, but I think they're actually designed to have the support further back by the cuneiforms and not in the middle of the arch.   There are the CCM ones that I've felt/seen in stores but not used. The CCM ones are nice because they come in s,m,l arch, but also weird because they have a soft, cushiony heel pad, which has garnered complaints.   I think a few other companies out there have them, but these are the three  brands I've heard the most about."

hockeyplayers,36mjro,BrummieRed,3,Wed May 20 22:33:00 2015 UTC,"!!!!!! I had the same problem. I got some new skates, and while they fit decently well, there were a few parts that were pressing into my feet in some awful places. Anytime I was on my outside right edge, my full weight would be concentrated into a single small ridge that pushed into the side of my foot. After one hard skate I took it off and seriously thought it was broken. Try to identify any pressure points, and have your pro shop punch them out, or cut them out. I've taken mine in four times so far, after noticing a pressure point. Little by little they are feeling better, and the restrictions on what I can do are gone. I would definitely go get them baked as well, it helps!  As for lacing, I found that leaving the bottom laces completely loose works wonders. I tighten the everliving shit out of the center and the next two up,  which lock my heel in (mostly). The top eye I leave unlaced.   I had heard five different opinions from five different people on loose vs tight lacing, and what I've learned is that a tight skate isn't as important as I thought. Tightening all the top laces both dug into the tops of my ankle bones, causing super painful internal bruises and ridges, and I couldn't have nearly as much control. Leaving the top loose forces you to develop those small muscles around your ankle, and will allow you to really use those edges like crazy. Or so I'm told (still having problems). It will leave your ankles sore, but will be better off in the long run as your ankles strengthen up. I was concerned that my heel was coming out of the pocket a little when they were that loose, but he waved it off and said his ankles come out a bit too. Loose means more control of your skates, and your edges. Tight means restricted ankles. Too loose and they'll fall off. Keep in mind that if you do end up changing your lacing style, bake your skates again so they aren't formed for your previous lacing style."
hockeyplayers,36mjro,BrummieRed,2,Wed May 20 22:04:59 2015 UTC,"I'll definitely look for pressure points tomorrow. However I actually like cranking my skates as tight as I can, it feels like I have better control. And honestly besides the numb toes on my left foot they felt fine. No pain or anything (besides general soreness the first few days). I'm going to go ahead and mold them and see if that helps. Thanks for the advice and input!"

hockeyplayers,36mjro,RegisteredSock,1 point,Wed May 20 16:09:22 2015 UTC,I have had this happen sometime when my skates were either A. too small or B. to tight. I would recommend when you tighten the laces you don't pull as hard as you can on them until the top two eyelets. Those are the two main ones that stabilize your ankles and keep them from going all over the place. I used to do every single eyelet as tight as possible and I would get pain/numbness from my arches on and I read to loosen it up and it worked! I also have had to small of a skate in the toe box area and it made my feet go numb and hurt so that could be an issue as well. Go to a skate shop and talk to someone and see if they can help you out.
hockeyplayers,36mjro,mrpopenfresh,1 point,Wed May 20 15:31:08 2015 UTC,"I did that at first, just really crank every single one. Yesterday i still tightened my bottom ones but i tried to do it a bit more loose to see if it helped. I can probably try to get there early and do it even looser."
hockeyplayers,36mjro,Tjmorgan303,2,Wed May 20 16:09:19 2015 UTC,"Ya i do the very bottom two tight, then all the ones that are across the top of your foot, above your arch not tight at all and then top 2 as tight as possible around your ankles."
hockeyplayers,36mjro,Tjmorgan303,1 point,Wed May 20 16:23:00 2015 UTC,I have had this problem and here's my solution: Tie them less tightly on the 2-3 eyes where your foot makes the turn upward and becomes your ankle. You can still tie them tightly up at the top of your ankle for support. There must be a vein or something right there.

The regular aviator seems to have a deeper groove under the center part of the visor but I honestly can't tell which Pav's wearing.

hockeyplayers,36ma2o,YoMikeyiPhone,0,Wed May 20 16:49:29 2015 UTC,"That's a good point. these are much better than Tacki-macs. They feel less rubber-y and you can use it again and again. With a Tacki Mac you have to replace the paper everytime. These, all you have to do is spray it again."

hockeyplayers,36k7zt,keeperguy64,7,Wed May 20 00:13:29 2015 UTC,"Poke checks shouldn't be used as your primary means of defense for exactly that reason.  Instead, work on playing the body first, stick second, and puck last (or if you're really confident in a particular poke check).  You can practice poke checks all day long, but if the other guy is a bit quicker than you, you'll still be left standing there looking like an idiot while he gets a breakaway.  Focus on matching their speed and playing the body, and you won't have that problem.   And when I say to play the body I'm not talking about hitting the other guy, but rather making sure you're always positioned so that he can't get by you, and forcing him to the outside lane and away from the net."
hockeyplayers,36k7zt,stevegcook,1 point,Wed May 20 00:49:58 2015 UTC,"keep your arm in close so the puck carrier has to guess how far your reach is and move in to poke. go to separate the puck from the stick. even if you miss the puck, make contact with the stick. you dont have to do a straight poke you can do like a sweeping motion. once you get better with that work on keeping your stick moving."
hockeyplayers,36k7zt,SeanP21,1 point,Wed May 20 00:44:27 2015 UTC,"Always try to match the speed of your opponent while skating backwards. If you're new this might take some time but it will stop you being burned if you miss the check. Secondly, your opponent's body is what you need to watch. Look at the puck with your peripherals only, watch the chest or stomach. Try to angle him to the boards by putting your body between him and the center lane. From here he can try to drive around you (shut him down on the boards) or pull a move back inside (make the poke check or hit him)"
hockeyplayers,36k7zt,swineanddine,1 point,Wed May 20 09:04:08 2015 UTC,"Poke checks aren't really meant to hit the puck with your stick.  You should really am on hitting the other players blade to separate it from the puck, if that makes sense.  Also, like others have said, keep your hands and stick close to your body until the last second, it draws in the opposing player as they can't tell how far you can reach.  Also, a common mistake is to lean forward when poke checking... don't do that.  Stay on your heals and in front of the player, don't lunge forward.  You lunge and miss, you SOL, you sit back and miss you can keep up with them."

hockeyplayers,36i3dd,bitchesandsake,1 point,Thu May 21 18:50:59 2015 UTC,Sprained ankles are the worst. I sprained mine BADLY about 8-10 years ago. Torn and stuff. Went to the doctor they just put me in a brace and sent me away. Ankle never did heal properly I don't think and for the next 2-3 I would sprain it constantly sometimes even just walking down stairs. Nowadays it's so loose and shitty I don't think I can even Sprain it anymore I just kinda roll over in it all the time. Has really effected how well I can turn to one direction and stopping facing a certain direction.   So make sure you get that shit healed up properly so it doesn't get worse and worse.

hockeyplayers,36i3dd,jrad151,1 point,Tue May 19 20:33:04 2015 UTC,Yes. The first one was bad enough I couldn't do anything. Second bad one happened while playing hockey so I kept my boot on and taped it tight and finished the game in pain before the swelling came. I got rushed back from that one since it was playoffs which was a mistake I was useless. I roll mine bad enough I limp for a day or two about ever couple weeks so make sure you rehab good so it isn't a lingering problem. I was like 16 at the time so I didn't really care that much at the time.

It helps kill the bacteria that cause your pads to stink. Don't soak it, but put it in a spray bottle and spray it when you set it out to dry.  Second tip, a few ounces of vinegar added to the wash water when you wash smelly shirts and undergarments helps get rid of the smell too. It works well on those clothes that smell bad, then you wash them and they smell OK until the first time you sweat in them and they reek again."

hockeyplayers,36fkvv,Skyline_BNR34,3,Tue May 19 14:00:56 2015 UTC,You can wash it all by hand In a tub.   Your skates are pretty much unwashable. Only way to keep the odor down on them is to just spray them with a disinfectant.   Helmets can be washed. I'd do it by hand of course with either a hose or in the tub with some.

Start with your left knee down, right knee up, chest high and core engaged. Basically a good lunge position. Push off with your right foot and drive through opening your hips to get square for your next stride. You can do it the opposite way too, working on getting that outside edge style push and driving the outside leg around to get your hips square."

hockeyplayers,36hvj5,iProgoalie,1 point,Tue May 19 14:35:47 2015 UTC,I would say you are at higher risk than a skater based on number o times you get hit in the head. I take at least two shots per game to the cage. Two things have prevented a concussion so far (1) I take the shots square to the cage for best absorption of the shot and (2) I wear a good fiberglass layered helmet. In a shitty helmet I would have had multiple concussions by now.
hockeyplayers,36hvj5,NoPucksGiven,1 point,Tue May 19 16:13:41 2015 UTC,I am also a baseball umpire and I have had one concussion from a ball off the top of the head and when you get one you will know it!
hockeyplayers,36hvj5,Captain_Murica91,1 point,Tue May 19 16:19:10 2015 UTC,"Disclaimer: I am not a doctor.  Medically speaking a concussion happens when your brain experiences such a force, usually via sudden deceleration, that it comes in contact with the inside of your skull.  There's a layer of cerebrospinal fluid around the brain that absorbs a lot of force to prevent this from happening, but it can't always stop it.  The laws of physics tell us that Force = mass * acceleration, and that the momentum of an object is its mass times its velocity.  A puck, relative to your head, is a small amount of mass but it can achieve some pretty scary velocity.  The force generated on your head is measured basically by how quickly your head makes that puck decelerate.  Goalie helmets help by deflecting that momentum at an angle, thus reducing the amount of force absorbed by your face and allowing the puck to retain more of its momentum.  What does that mean for your brain?  It means that generally speaking, you're less likely to get concussed by a puck off the head than you are an opponent skating hard into your face.  It'd take a direct hit on a flat surface of your helmet (like the side) to cause your head to move in such a way that'd cause your brain to hit the inside of your skull."
hockeyplayers,36hvj5,el_karacho,1 point,Wed May 20 18:51:36 2015 UTC,The same as anyone else. Concussions don't discriminate based on your position.
hockeyplayers,36hvj5,RDC123,1 point,Tue May 19 14:57:53 2015 UTC,Well I know I guess the better question is whether or not it is more or less likely to get one as a goalie.
hockeyplayers,36hvj5,RIPphonebattery,3,Tue May 19 15:19:04 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, not much more likely. I am not a medical professional. Protect your head. Spend more money on a qualified bucket.   I had a concussion from rugby at the start of the season. If felt like I was trying to think but I couldn't concentrate. For days. If you suspect you have sustained a concussion, get out immediately. Go to a doc and do not play until they clear you.   Its an inexact science, but its better safe than sorry."
hockeyplayers,36hvj5,RDC123,2,Tue May 19 15:26:40 2015 UTC,There's no answer to that. You face different issues then a player but likelihood is a matter of a ton of factors. In a non-contact league I wouldn't expect a goalie to be at any markedly higher or lower risk than anyone else.
hockeyplayers,36hvj5,Tavisss,1 point,Tue May 19 15:26:16 2015 UTC,Having played both positions extensively I have strong reason to believe goaltending is safer from concussions than skater positions. That's just my opinion though.

Pushing and shoving is fun, except when people try to injure other people.

hockeyplayers,36gzpe,Lndbrghwrstlr,8,Tue May 19 14:27:48 2015 UTC,"If the D man is stronger and can move you like a football sled, you need to stay moving.  Don't be stationary.  Spin off blocks, move low crease to high crease, time your entry and exit from net-front based on when you will disrupt the goalie's vision for a shot and give you best chance at a rebound.  If the D engages you aggressively, sometimes willingly give up the net front to lure him 3 ft to the left or right of the crease, opening the space for a teammate.  Even if you have the size or strength advantage and he can't move you, he can tie up your stick if you are stationary.  While you can still block the goalies vision, you are crippled as an offensive weapon with your stick tied up.  You still need to move a bit.  Use your ass as leverage, spin around and keep him away from your stick.  In either scenario the hardest part is keeping your stick on the ice the whole time when you're doing this space jockeying.  Can't score with your stick in the air."

hockeyplayers,36gzpe,lmg6841,2,Tue May 19 19:39:18 2015 UTC,My question is more like how much can I push? If I knock the guy over cuz I'm pushing too hard or he is a little weak on his skates or something will I get called?
hockeyplayers,36gzpe,Lndbrghwrstlr,3,Tue May 19 19:45:57 2015 UTC,"If he's hacking away at your goalie or causing general interference in front of your net, 9 out of 10 times you'll be allowed to completely dump him onto the ice.  If he's just standing there, causing a screen or whatever, you're going to be able to move him a few inches at best without getting a call. In this situation you want to be able to move him a bit from his ""good positioning,"" let your goalie have more visibility, and be in a position that you're in between him and the net."

hockeyplayers,36gzpe,Lndbrghwrstlr,4,Tue May 19 19:58:49 2015 UTC,"Well it's the same, you're bodying for position. Honestly, I'd only do this to set a screen or occupy one of the defenders with watching me, potentially moving them out of good positioning.   My main advice would never to be in one spot too long though. The idea of kind of rolling around defenders and hovering around the crease is the best way to get into good scoring spaces."
hockeyplayers,36gzpe,lmg6841,1 point,Tue May 19 20:02:46 2015 UTC,Awesome makes perfect sense! Thanks
hockeyplayers,36gzpe,Lndbrghwrstlr,1 point,Tue May 19 20:16:20 2015 UTC,"If you are being pushed around by a defender or he is tieing up your stick, I find its best to try to always be ready to snap yourself free enough to deflect or shoot the puck. If the defender thinks he has you locked down he will relax a bit and then when you jump a bit free he won't always be on the ball with the same reaction time, that gives you small windows to change your body direction or anything like that."
hockeyplayers,36gzpe,Zednix,5,Tue May 19 23:18:20 2015 UTC,"Way more than you would think. I always tell people they would be surprised  how much pushing and contact thy can actually do legally. I play rougher than most in my league but I don't get called for anything dirty.   Fun experiment, keep notching up the level until you get a penalty then back down slightly. I bet you it takes awhile to get one."
hockeyplayers,36gzpe,NoPucksGiven,6,Tue May 19 16:16:43 2015 UTC,"As much as you can get away with.   Shoves that border on cross checks are ok, try to disguise it by not winding up and not completely separating your hands.   Always try to leverage position by lifting the guys stick and getting lower than him.  Little smacks are ok asv long as you are subtle and not winding up too much.   but each league is different. Test your limit, see what the refs let you get away with and what they don't."
hockeyplayers,36gzpe,keytoitall,5,Tue May 19 10:34:57 2015 UTC,"""As much as you can get away with.""  Extremely accurate.    It will vary by league skill level and each ref's whims, but if you are under sustained pressure, as a defenseman you will be able to get away with a lot of contact.  At a minimum you will be allowed to ""football sled"" them out.  If the puck is anywhere around the crease area, in many medium to high level leagues will you can separate and hit with velocity without most refs batting an eye."
hockeyplayers,36gzpe,warox,3,Tue May 19 18:28:55 2015 UTC,"You can generally push and shove as much as you want.. keep your hands on your stick and the stick on the ice and you'll be fine. Knocking the guy down, cross checking, or slashing will get called.  But I don't bother unless my goalie is complaining about a screen because it tires you out for no good reason. Instead spend your energy keeping him from doing anything useful with his stick, he can't score if you keep lifting his stick off the ice. If you can't get an angle on his stick, then yeah, commence the shoving."
hockeyplayers,36gzpe,xzzy,3,Tue May 19 14:02:37 2015 UTC,"I play center so I'm not always above the crease, but I'm often in the low slot area; but my strategy is to push them out if the puck is between the half boards and the point or along the blue line. If the puck is below the half boards, in the corner I let the forward in front think he's left alone and time the pass to lift his stick. If the puck is behind the net I kind of do both, push the guy out of line of sight and also time a stick lift.  Of course, this is generally speaking. The game is pretty fluid so it just depends on where everyone is.  Also, as others have said, light shoving can be ok. Refs have never called it, but some opposing players have gotten pissy about it."

This would cause some slippage or bending of the skates, changing the angle of the blade and making it terribly difficult to skate.  My suggestion is check your fit with someone who works there, they should be able to ensure you're wearing a proper fitting rental. Furthermore, ask for hockey skates when you get your rental!

When you see pictures of players on one edge of the skate blade or another, that's because they're on that edge intentionally (the skate blade actually has two edges).   If your skates are too big in you, you're going to have a much harder time with your foot sitting correctly in the boot. I find the proper size to be about 1-1 1/2 shoe sizes smaller than my running shoes. Definitely get a proper sizing at a pro shop."

I would suggest wearing something on your shin.  Chances are you will get hit there.  I play roller hockey with a puck.

Right below the knee cap isn't very padded and they are a lot thinner than ice shin guards and if he gets hit with a puck it is usually leaving a bruise.    However, if you are using a ball and are on feet something like that can be great for you.  They are segmented in the knee which would help protect you through running motions since your knee will bend a lot different than if you were on skates."

I use the same soccer pair that I've had for like 10 years.   A decent set of hockey gloves because occasionally someone gets a little too ""friendly"" or just timing is weird and you get a nice whack. I blocked a slap shot off of mine.

If you're feeling really wild you can use both and the result is no snow on your stick + puck feels like it's on a string.   Both products will cause your blade to collect dust and hair off the ice so I recommend regular tape for dry land training. Wax is really only beneficial on the ice.

hockeyplayers,36e9yy,Captain_Murica91,5,Mon May 18 18:35:02 2015 UTC,"I would recommend away from buying skates by their stance. That is all easily corrected with blade profiling. Go with fit first and foremost. Try on everything you can possibly get your hands on in the store. Buy the pair that fits the best. Every model line of skate is going to fit quite a bit differently than every other model. Vapors are different than Supremes are different than RBZ are different than Tacks, etc. Try on Bauer, CCM, Easton, Graf and Reebok skates so you know which one is the best for you. Get a store employee to help you choose the best fit.  Edit: As far as ankle support, they are all going to be good but they have different fits. Some fit better to skinny ankles, some fit better to thicker ankles and everything in between. You have to try them on to know how it fits for you. I haven't personally used Reebok pump skates but most people like them. I have had quite a few friends who had their pump bladders pop and become useless. I'd try and find a good fit without relying on the pumps.  As far as price goes, generally the higher the price, the stiffer the skate which generally equals more support. I'd start your search around the $150-$200 price point and not lower. The bottom 2 or 3 models in each line will be too soft to last very long with hockey activities."
hockeyplayers,36e9yy,kr580,2,Mon May 18 19:02:06 2015 UTC,"make sure they fit (toe brushes the front when on)and wear as thin a sock as you can, if you are playing hockey you will need a stronger pair and of course if you are heavy than a strong pair is preferable. Make sure they are comfortable as foot shape is different and all models fit differently. Good luck"

The reason your coach tells you at all times is because you're new; you haven't built up that feel and ability to use both hands effectively.  Yes, you can't poke check with two hands, but here's what you can't do well with one hand: stickhandle, pass, and shoot."

Of course there's situations where 1 hand is necessary but there's way more situations where 2 is better, and by keeping 2 hands on the stick you're prepping yourself for the majority of situations that may occur. You can act instead of react. The only way to get better at skating with 2 hands on your stick is to keep practicing/playing like that. It'll be tough at first but it'll quickly become second nature.  There's a guy on my team who is in the same spot as you. It's frustrating because he's never able to accept a harder pass, and can't protect the puck very well when he does get it since it's so easy to knock the puck away from a guy with 1 hand on the stick. I've even spoken to him about it but he just says he can't skate as well with 2 hands and doesn't seem to want to improve that part."

As well as the off-hand is used to control the a rushing forward when you close with them (read man-handle them in tight). And I encourage defenseman to use the free hand to track the weak-side player, and to communicate with teammates (e.g., shout & point).  With two hands on the stick, you lose the ability to poke-check, your reach is limited, usually your stick end up on the forehand side (instead of out in the passing lane), and if you go to check an opponent you can't use your upper hand without involving your stick."

Even if the coach has their head literally up their ass I'd still listen to them.

hockeyplayers,36dbu0,Zednix,2,Tue May 19 08:16:40 2015 UTC,"You need to have 2 hands on your stick 95+% of the time to be able to play the puck in any useful way. The reason your coaches or parents are on you to ""always use two hands"" is because it builds an extremely important habit of being in a ready position.   I hate playing with guys who are one handers, they are useless most of the time to pass to because where they leave there stick is not where they can accept a pass."
hockeyplayers,36dbu0,bravochar,1 point,Tue May 19 23:38:38 2015 UTC,"Having one hand on your stick is okay as long as you can transition quickly to two hands to accept a hard pass or get a quick shot off. Just don't have two hands on your stick with the whole stick parallel to the ice at waist level - you're totally useless in that position.  The ideal situation is somewhere in the middle. One hand on your stick while playing D or for the 90% of the time that you don't have the puck, isn't going to hurt you. But, you need to keep your stick in a position so that you can nearly instantly get your second hand on it. This means you need to stay low with your knees bent, so that getting your second hand on the stick is a quick lateral movement of your hand. You also need to keep it in front of you or slightly across your body for the same reason, unless you're actively poke-checking or reaching to break up a pass.  The goal is to be able to play the puck quickly in the event that it comes to you. I'd argue that whether you've got one hand on your stick or two, you're equally useless if your knees aren't bent. When you're upright with one hand, you can't get your second hand on quickly enough, and if you're upright with two hands, your blade is going to be off the ice or your hands will be two close together.  Focus on staying low and being ready to play the puck immediately when it comes your way and, one hand or two, you'll be able to react more quickly and be a more effective player. But, listen to your coach for now. Talk to him off the ice when he has more time about your concerns, and if he's worth his salt, he'll give you a longer explanation similar to the above."
hockeyplayers,36dbu0,Subject2Change,1 point,Mon May 18 15:44:31 2015 UTC,"I'm a ""big"" d-man as well, and due to my height (i'm 6'4"" without skates on...) I find it difficult to keep 2 hands on my stick at all times, otherwise im super hunched over. I shoot lefty and am a natural lefty, but find my right hand always on my stick; I wave it around a lot on the ice to try to block passes, shots and to push people away.  Honestly, I don't think 2 hands is necessary all the time. I get most of my poke checks and can break up plays with the one hand."

hockeyplayers,36dbu0,kr580,1 point,Wed May 20 16:43:57 2015 UTC,"They're probably telling you two hands at all times just to get you in the habit of doing two hands first and switching to one hand as needed, not the other way around. I always see people that skate around with one hand on their stick and when they receive a pass they try and put both hands on the stick as it arrives but by then it's too late and the puck's past them or goes under their blade. You really need to have two hands be the norm and then adjust accordingly only when needed."

With summer league starting in less then 2 weeks- (I CAN'T WAIT!)  I'm wondering if the ice will be a little softer? Anyone notice a difference when playing summer league...logic tells me 85 degrees outside it's going to be tougher to keep the rink and ice colder- a couple degrees warmer inside the rink makes ice softer...thus a more shallow hollow will help?

hockeyplayers,36auoq,Mordraken,39,Sun May 17 21:34:39 2015 UTC,I started playing league hockey as a way to get in shape. Now I'm working out because I'm not in good enough shape to play league hockey.
hockeyplayers,36auoq,daytonm,17,Mon May 18 01:30:49 2015 UTC,I'm a middle aged player and here's my take. It's good exercise.  Games are my workout on games days but I also find playing to be a motivator for my other work outs. I'm working out to be a better hockey player.
hockeyplayers,36auoq,Badmathteacher,3,Sun May 17 21:49:49 2015 UTC,"Good call. I've always been an active guy, but now I've tailored my workouts for hockey specifically. Lots of focus on legs and core, as well as intervals on the bike."

hockeyplayers,36auoq,Ineedsomethingtodo,6,Mon May 18 15:48:35 2015 UTC,"I'd say a combo of your cardio workouts and hockey would be good. While hockey certainly takes a lot of conditioning to play, it shouldn't replace your cardio workouts, especially if you're trying to get down to a healthy BMI. You should definitely organize your workouts around playing hockey. Plus extra cardio workouts can help condition you more for hockey."
hockeyplayers,36auoq,ledbeatlewho95,6,Sun May 17 21:50:52 2015 UTC,"Depending on how this post is to be read.. I have to disagree. It sounds to me like the OP's goal is to get healthier, and is using hockey as a way to make it more fun. If you're playing a few days a week, hockey will replace your cardio. Any standard cardio activity, even HIIT training on your own, you're not going to be burning much more than a few hundred calories max. You can easily burn near 800+ calories playing hockey. You have a much greater mental capacity to push yourself further than you could doing a monotonous cardio activity.  Those cardio days you've currently still having, replace those with more weightlifting. 2 days a week is not going to cut it. 3 to 4 days per week should be ideal for you. Go to bodybuilding website or forum and pick a standard beginner's routine.   3-4 days of lifting plus 2 days per week of hockey and you'll be very happy with how you begin to transform your body. Throw out even the concept of BMI, it's total crap. Start tracking your body fat percentage."

Don't replace cardio nights, supplement them with hockey. You'll find that cardio (especially running) will help condition your legs and lungs for hockey. You might want to try High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) like tabata workout that is about running for short intervals (20s) and then getting a brief break (10s) before running again. It's scientifically studied to help your anaerobic fitness.  In hockey, when your legs get tired, you become a liability.   That said, rec hockey is fun, humbling, and good exercise. Absolutely go for it!"
hockeyplayers,36auoq,ledbeatlewho95,1 point,Mon May 18 07:48:28 2015 UTC,That actually would be a good plan. You can do some skating drills during stick and puck to do a cardio workout and working on your skating.

One thing about slimming down/lowering bmi, your lower body isn't gonna slim down.

I'm thinking of replacing my two cardio nights with stick&puck nights at the rink, and then joining the rec league once I feel like I can skate a full 20 minutes again.

hockeyplayers,36auoq,JagsLikeFapper,1 point,Mon May 18 04:07:04 2015 UTC,"Do it!!!! I've lost 15 pounds since early february, and have gotten some serious muscle tone and mass from joining an instructional league, and going to as many stick and puck sessions and drop in games as possible each week. Loving hockey and just starting is really exciting, because you get to go teach yourself the fundamentals, while getting a great workout. It's not a chore anymore, because like you, I hated running. I didn't enjoy it. And the involvement in the league assures (at a very minimum) a kickass workout once a week. How much else you practice/do is up to you  edit: 37 lbs lost so far, since last semester. The key factors:   -Swimming 1000 yards (3 times a week)    -Completely reversing the meal portions during the day (Biggest meal for breakfast, normal sized lunch, smallest meal for dinner.)  If you are like many, you skip breakfast lots of days, or just grab something small on your way out the door. That doesn't make sense, because you still have to have energy for the day. Eat the most for breakfast. You don't honestly need to have a huge meal at night that leaves you absolutely stuffed.you won't have very much activity before bed to burn any of that off. Then going to bed lowers the effectiveness of digestion. Your body doesn't need the energy, so it just turns it to fat. As results started to show, it was almost nice to be settling in for bed feeling hungry. All you have to do is close your eyes, and wake up to the biggest meal of the day.   Then hockey was added in, and it sped up the loss by quite a bit!"

So if you have a smaller waist-to-height ratio (than the average hockey player), you could get a ""smaller"" Vapor pants and then expand the length.  Also, personally I like my jeans to fit slightly loose on my waist, so I've found that for hockey pants I have to go an inch or two lower than my jeans.  tldr: if you're skinny, get the vapor that fits your waist and then increase the length by adjusting the zippers"

Keep things loose.  When you get out there, first game should really be first on, first off. No designated positions. This should be the norm for the first couple games. Also, reiterate that everyone is going to get the same amount of ice time if everyone is conciencious of their time our their. Get off the ice prior to getting tired, not when they get tired. Have fun. It also wouldn't hurt to bring some beer for after the 1st game. That will go a long way with some of the guys."
hockeyplayers,3683ek,MuscleMilkMike,3,Sun May 17 04:14:06 2015 UTC,Majority of us all met up for dinner a week or so ago to introduce ourselves so the first locker room visit won't be brutal.

hockeyplayers,368a8j,Ditchingworkagain2,6,Sun May 17 03:21:35 2015 UTC,"If youre gliding forward, turn your right foot on a slight angle. Your feet should look like this ... l \ ... This will start to slow you down. You should feel and hear the ""scrape"" of your blade on the ice. When you get comfortable with this, do it again, but once you angle your foot, start to push out. This will be a slightly more aggressive stop. When you get comfortable doing that, then you can start doing a full stop. Its all about getting comfortable on your edges."

The snowplow stop is the first step in learning how to do a hockey stop.  And to answer your question, yes, in this example left foot is straight and right is angled."
hockeyplayers,368a8j,PKPACHING,2,Sun May 17 05:08:26 2015 UTC,you should practice both

hockeyplayers,368a8j,FilthyMcnasty87,2,Sun May 17 04:13:39 2015 UTC,"As someone who taught themselves how to only stop with one side forward, this is so important. I can barely turn right, let alone stop with my left foot forward."

So, stopping left-foot forward and turning right are next to impossible for me."
hockeyplayers,368a8j,HowitzerIII,4,Sun May 17 18:23:05 2015 UTC,"I started skating about a year ago and remember being where you are. Do yourself a huge favor and get into a learn to skate class. They are extremely helpful and from my experience the instructors can tailor the work toward your skill level. I had to swallow my pride and get out there with a bunch of little kids but one of the instructors spent some time with me individually since I was already pretty comfortable with the basics having played inline as a teen. You certainly can learn through trial and error, online message boards, and YouTube videos, but a class will get you there a lot quicker and make sure you have the fundamentals down correctly. I told my instructor to kick my butt and really push me. She was more than happy to oblige."
hockeyplayers,368a8j,Lndbrghwrstlr,2,Sun May 17 14:19:11 2015 UTC,That's actually a great idea. I'll look into it. Thanks!
hockeyplayers,368a8j,Gumstead,2,Sun May 17 19:54:34 2015 UTC,"The only way seems to be lots of repetition. I've got a pretty good right side stop, but it still took me lots of practice to get even a mediocre left stop that I can use in games.   Make sure to lift your body weight off the skates when you pivot, otherwise you just end up turning. Also, lean back. Those two are the basics you need, but you need a lot of practice to get it down."
hockeyplayers,368a8j,frosty_biscuits,2,Sun May 17 03:40:30 2015 UTC,Thanks. Could you explain a little about lifting my weight off the skate? Thanks for the answer.
hockeyplayers,368a8j,Gumstead,2,Sun May 17 03:53:56 2015 UTC,"Like your instinct makes you want to almost lean into hit. Fight this urge and pop your hips to the left (or right) and it will click for you. For me it clicked when I was doing a billion snowplow and someone just told me ""try doing the snowplow one foot"". I went in, and lifted my left foot, and to snowplow on my right I was forced to pop my hips to the left. Perfect stop on the first try!"
hockeyplayers,368a8j,Lndbrghwrstlr,2,Sun May 17 04:51:19 2015 UTC,This is exactly how I figured it out. Trying to do it with just one foot forces you to pivot your hips properly. I always thought I was pivoting but it turns out I was barely moving. It feels really strange at first but you really do end up turning your hips a good 90 degrees.
hockeyplayers,368a8j,Lndbrghwrstlr,3,Sun May 17 06:52:14 2015 UTC,"""Hips"" is the key word in all of this. Focus on turning the hips rather than thinking about turning the feet. Lift the weight off the skates just enough so that you don't bite the edge into the ice and eat it. As long as the front foot gets that inside edge down you're good to go."
hockeyplayers,368a8j,DrRopata,2,Sun May 17 14:22:08 2015 UTC,Indeed. Watch the best pro skaters and they all have incredible hip movement.
hockeyplayers,368a8j,JMM123,1 point,Sun May 17 16:54:16 2015 UTC,"Exactly! It feels super weird initially, like you're gonna eat the ice, but it forces you to both pivot and distribute your weight properly, resulting in the right combination to do a stop."

I had guessed that it was just because the size of the holder changed over model years and since 272 to 280 is 8mm difference (I believe that's what the 272 and 280 refer to--the length in millimeters of the blade), it isn't a huge difference. Also, if your skates are different widths that could have some bearing on the holders.  It's possible Bauer decided longer runners translated to better speed (this is true in speed skating). Either way, just pay attention to what you buy when you're replacing and you'll be fine."

I don't think I ever hit your home page, I see updates on YouTube because I'm subscribed or I google specific hockey stuff and your site comes up.  If you're getting a lot of traffic for specific terms it can help you to double down on those terms, keep those articles up to date, and add internal linking from those articles into other articles.    It's probably a good idea to think about some user profiling, eg someone who comes to the homepage because they've googled ""how to play hockey"" vs someone who lands on a specific page because they've googled ""defensive responsibility of left winger in hockey.""  What does the first person want to see vs the second person.  What keeps them engaged, and what specific actions do you want them to take?  Eg sign up for a newsletter, click an ad, check out your social media?  You're in a great position because content is king and you have awesome content.  People WANT what you've got and that puts you in a better position than a lot of other sites.  I'm on my phone right now but I'll try to give you a better design critique when I'm on my laptop.

There are a lot of ways to shoot the puck, the method you describe is useful if cutting across the ice, or after a quick turn / shift.   The method you are using is better if you are skating towards the net. If you'd like to see pro examples of your style of shot look up Tarasenko goals, he is a great example of how to shoot that way.   You can get power the way you shoot if you really push with that back leg and drop your weight a bit, watch Tarasenko, he goes into a bit of a split stance to really load up the stick."
hockeyplayers,366fpi,howtohockeydotcom,1 point,Sat May 16 17:00:53 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I won't worry too much about ""fixing"" this right now then. I do need to fix my pathetic slapshot, however. Just can't get any lift/power. I try to drop my bottom hand, hit the ice first - just goes nowhere. At 6'5 you'd think I could rip a slapshot but the whole sequence is just awkward right now."

hockeyplayers,364nso,ChefOfTheWasteland,4,Sat May 16 02:38:33 2015 UTC,"I'd say protective gear would be ok to get there. Shins, helmet, gloves, shoulders and pants if you can try them on at all. Skates are a bit different, I'd grab those from a store who will spend time with you finding the perfect fit.  Also, just note that sometimes pro and semi pro gear is over or under protective depending on the person. I've seen some REALLY tiny shoulder pads on NHL players just because that's what they like."
hockeyplayers,364nso,lostincbus,3,Sat May 16 16:20:13 2015 UTC,"I find that pro team equipment sales are perfect for new skaters as they sell quality gear at a low price. I just went to the San Jose sharks sale a couple weeks ago and new equipment was half of more off retail price. I would bring a full wallet, and see if there's anything you like.  Edit: unless its new, you wont want to buy every thing there ie: jock, helmet, mouthgaurd(?) etc...  Also if you decide to not buy at the sale, a great website is hockeymonkey.com :) good luck"

hockeyplayers,36573q,rjmaggie,1 point,Sat May 16 06:58:19 2015 UTC,"Zinc68 already said what candy caning is (just youtube Kessel's tape job), but most people consider it dusty as shit because it's pretty unnecessary. We aren't elite players, people just do it because it looks cool/they like Kessel but they'll argue that it gives them a WAY BETTER GRIP. Personally I don't actually care what someone does with their equipment but I'll chirp about it all game. Same goes for tinted visors (sup OVI) etc etc."
hockeyplayers,36573q,Zinc68,1 point,Sun May 17 00:24:16 2015 UTC,"Yea that makes sense. But from what little I know so far when it comes to poser looking stuff candy caning seems very dusty... I guess you could argue it has grip but I mean,at what cost.... All I know is I'm not a bender and not one to turn down criticism but I could never do that to my stick"
hockeyplayers,36573q,stevegcook,0,Sun May 17 03:06:27 2015 UTC,"almost (or fully) all the way down. See Kessel's tape job for a prime example. I wouldn't use it for that though, it would make your shaft WAY too sticky"

And not giving us enough time to let the guy we pranked know what we did.

This was the worst prank that ever happened to me. I call it ""The Blue Puck Surprise"" (really I just made it up and I shudder when I think of it)  Basically during one of our last practices the coach said he was going to get off the ice early and let us fuck around. The guys wanted to practice crossing the blue line and firing slapshots and I figured it was going to be a great opportunity to work on my movement from the post  I see one of our strongest shooting defensemen lining up for the chance, I go to the post and slide out as he's winding up.  It was around this time that I notice he doesn't have a normal puck, but one of those blue pucks that little kids shoot. I dive out of the way as he rifles it at would have been my head level and the thing smashes into the glass behind us breaking it.  God only knows what would have happened if it hit me."
hockeyplayers,362h0j,BiscuitMiscuit,7,Fri May 15 17:05:41 2015 UTC,"Had a similar thing, but I was on the defenseman's side of the story: I'd been helping out a Squirt team as a student coach and one of them, the goalie, was a real shit.  Never had I ever wanted to beat up a 12 year old until I met him.  Anyway, he sneaks a blue puck on the ice and is firing it at teammates, so I take it away before it becomes a problem.  He then proceeds to slash me for the rest of practice whenever he could get away with it until the end, when they do they just go 1v1 on the goalie.  I pull out the blue puck, snap a wrist shot off his forehead, which surprised him so much he fell on his ass.  He was pretty docile after that little incident.  TL;DR: 12 year old is being a douche with blue puck, I take it away.  He tries to slash me all practice because he was mad, so I snapped a shot into his face that knocks him down, embarrassing him."

Instead of hanging it up, he stuffs as much of the towel in the crack of his ass as he could, turns and faces the wall where the towels hang waiting on the guy to get out. As he gets out he turns and says ""I was just hanging on to it for ya!""     Before bags with wheels came along, our coach would hide a 45 pound weight plate in our bags after some skating practices. We would almost make it to our cars before most of us realized it was in there.

hockeyplayers,362vec,PavelMatsyuk,5,Fri May 15 21:39:10 2015 UTC,"Practice off ice puck handling.  I suspect that your fear is over losing the puck.  If you are more confident with the puck (stationary or moving) you will feel things slow down around you.  One of the worst things you can do is randomly knock the puck away from you, but it's something that a lot of people do early on.    I prefer a Swedish ball on laminate flooring.  Back and forth in front of you, keeping the ball inside your shoulders.  Try that a 10 minutes a day (or more) a couple times a week.  Practice rolling your wrists and cupping the puck(ball).  After that, practice handling at your sides and as far behind you as you can reach.  While puck handling, move the puck in an arc around your body.  Practice going wide with it.    All of these drills will help increase your confidence with the puck and allow you to spend less time focusing on where the puck is and more attention to where the puck NEEDS to go."

I've been playing hockey for 20 years and it still feels like that when I play at a higher level. My best advice would be to spend some time playing with people where you are one of the better players so you have the time to analyze the play when you have the puck.

I also don't think it's as big of a deal as you're making it out to be. If you know he's going to dump it in just anticipate it better and try to win it back. It's also better that he turns it over in their zone than at center ice. I'd kill to have some of the guys on my team dump the puck in more than they carry it. Neutral zone turnovers will kill games. You could be playing a team 3x worse than you and they could win off of a couple bad neutral zone turnovers.  All that being said, talk to the guy in as friendly a way possible (it's beer league) about keeping his head up and looking for his line mates on the rush. If you tell him about the areas you're going to be in he might have a better chance of finding you on the break. Also, make sure you're yelling your ass off for a pass if you want it. There should be no possibility that he's not aware you're ready to receive the puck.  Hope that helps!"
hockeyplayers,3655ku,Bluearmy69,-2,Sat May 16 07:03:47 2015 UTC,"Thats true. but I have zero time to react. He will grab the puck in our own circle and just fire it down. He acts like its always a power play.   I'm okay with dump ins from the neutral zone if there is no other option. Like you said you never want to give up a turn over there.

hockeyplayers,3655ku,somewhat_random,4,Sun May 17 04:20:06 2015 UTC,"I also don't see the big issue - sure he blew a possible 3 on 1 but how often can that happen? Otherwise, if he dumps it straight in the goalie you get an offensive zone face-off which is better than a neutral zone possession in a lot of cases. If it goes to the corner and you KNOW he is going to dump it, you get a jump on the D-man so have a good chance at a turnover in their end.  My peeve is the guy who always makes the low percentage pass at the red line (or worse, our blue line) and causes the turnover in a dangerous place"

hockeyplayers,3655ku,Skyline_BNR34,-1,Sat May 16 20:58:12 2015 UTC,"Dump and Chase technically works best with check hockey because of the pressure you can create from the forecheck and actual check. That's mostly eliminated in beer league as guys tend to play further away from you than checking hockey.  In a beer league game, you really have no need to dump it in unless you need a change and you're better off making a small quick pass at the blueline or beating them with speed.  I'm not saying it doesn't work because it can, but it shouldn't be the first strategy to use."
hockeyplayers,3655ku,RDC123,7,Sat May 16 21:14:05 2015 UTC,Not sure what kind of league you play in but dump and chase is a legit strategy in every beer league I've ever played in. You don't need to be able to throw a check to retrieve a puck. Hard pressure often results in a rushed pass which often leads to a turnover. We use it consistently and score off of it most nights.
hockeyplayers,3655ku,Skyline_BNR34,0,Sat May 16 21:34:17 2015 UTC,"Depends on what level you play in.  If you're in a higher level league it would wok better than in a lower level league.  I never said it doesn't work, it's just not the best thing to do in a non-checking league, and it's not very good to do if not everyone is going to commit to it on the ice also.  If the other team is stacking the blueline, dump it in and go around them, if they are hanging back, it's pointless because you'll never get it before them."
hockeyplayers,3655ku,OzziePao13,2,Sun May 17 00:02:53 2015 UTC,"Switch lines. If you and your other wing (or center) have a different mindset than this guy, just juggle the lines.  It's beer league, and you stated pickup beer league at that. You can't really expect much of anything from anyone. Once you accept that, you'll have a lot more fun.  Personally, lower level hockey, I love dump and chase. It can create a lot of chaos and goal scoring opportunities because more often than not you can beat the other teams D back to the puck at lower levels.  ""When in doubt, dump it out""."
hockeyplayers,3655ku,Jag94,1 point,Sat May 16 17:14:57 2015 UTC,"You can't really get too upset with him.  If its a ""beer league scrimmage"", you know the talent level is not very high.  As you well know, hockey is not an easy sport to play.  It requires a lot of very quick decisions with a lot of pressure.  Is the guy in question a forward or a D man?    Maybe work on breakouts with him?  Show him a breakout video, or use a whiteboard to explain what he should be doing?    Also, if he has a hard shot, that can be a good thing.  In the example you gave, if you instruct him to rip the puck all the way down the boards (not at the goalie), the puck should whip around the boards and end up at about the hash-marks on the other side.  If you and your other linemate were already at the blue line, it would take you no time at all to get that puck in the offensive zone.  That would actually be a pretty good heads-up play (barring the goaltender stopping the puck behind the net, which if he's good, he'll do).  So maybe tell him to dump it hard along the boards instead of AT the goalie?"
hockeyplayers,3655ku,ludo_kressh,1 point,Sat May 16 15:40:18 2015 UTC,Ok... It depends on your team I guess... I'm on a pretty quick team.. We dump the puck and recover behind the net quite a bit.  If the guy needed to make a pass to an open player that's one thing but if the blue line is clogged you either dump or reset... Nothing wrong with either scenario.
hockeyplayers,3655ku,FLRangerFan,1 point,Sun May 17 04:17:18 2015 UTC,It sounds like this guy doesn't have the skill or confidence to walk it in. You need to talk to him and give him tips on how to solve that then just telling him not to dump it in. Tell him when he gets the puck to take 2-3 big strides with it and look up. If he can garner some time with the puck then he might see his line mates open instead of dumping it in
hockeyplayers,3655ku,Walbeb24,0,Sun May 17 18:35:36 2015 UTC,"God I hate the dump and chase.   I'm a really fast skater usually the fastest guy on the ice, so my line mates think chucking the puck and making me skate for it is an OK thing to do.  It doesn't, I get there 3-4 seconds before my line mates and then get boned in the corner. Besides, I'm way too lazy to be chasing for more than my required 2 shifts of effort."
hockeyplayers,362dju,mccarseat,1 point,Fri May 15 14:50:41 2015 UTC,Is it easy to switch the frames? Or would I have to go to a pro shop?

hockeyplayers,362dju,RegisteredSock,1 point,Fri May 15 23:49:45 2015 UTC,Yeah I removed the old ones myself but will be having the Marsblades installed by a pro shop. It's not expensive to have done but make sure it's somewhere you trust knows what they are doing.

(Original Equipment Manufacturer) A site like www.jerseysstoreaaa.ru may seem a bit sketchy at first, but the jerseys they sell are top notch. They have Gerrard, a few different kits. It's not fake, just not official. Made in the same factories as the official. I think some people call them ""Grey Market"". If you have questions PM me, I've ordered from there before, they're legit."

hockeyplayers,362k3f,chenac,1 point,Fri May 15 17:42:31 2015 UTC,"Something else I'd recommend is just getting a plain jersey online. When you receive it, take it to your local screen printing shop or sporting goods store, and they should be able to iron-on a name and number for you for pretty cheap."

hockeyplayers,362k3f,Felipe22375,2,Fri May 15 19:10:39 2015 UTC,"I love roller, so much so, that I work in the industry as the art director at Labeda. Ironically, I do all of the custom jerseys, which are pretty out there, as usual for roller."
hockeyplayers,362k3f,mlwduersoj,1 point,Fri May 15 19:13:42 2015 UTC,"Are you  looking to use like a NHL color scheme template or one completely on your own? I ask because one option is to simply buy a jersey from like a replica jersey place in china and ask them to not attatch any branding. This gets you a custom jersey for like $20! For example, here."
hockeyplayers,360ii2,buffalawl,13,Fri May 15 01:44:17 2015 UTC,Don't forget your gear. Just last game we had one of the more experienced guys in my beginner league forget his pants. Take advice Play smart. Aka play your position. Have fun
hockeyplayers,360ii2,gqgk,2,Fri May 15 01:51:40 2015 UTC,"Point one is always groan worthy, but at least entertaining.  I've seen guys forget about every piece of equipment.  Though my two favorites were a friend in high school who forgot just one of his skates, and my buddy who showed up to ice pickup last night with roller blades."
hockeyplayers,360ii2,funkyb,1 point,Fri May 15 16:22:24 2015 UTC,I forgot my skates once. I took skates to get sharpened in the morning. My local hockey shop is right next to my gym. I tell the guy going for a work out will be back in an hour. Tired from the gym I go straight home and guess who forgot there skates at the hockey shop and didn't realize it till he was getting dressed for the game.
hockeyplayers,360ii2,whatthefrickenfrack,1 point,Fri May 15 20:55:19 2015 UTC,"Over the years, I've forgotten so many things. And yes, once I showed up with my roller hockey gear to an ice hockey game. I played in rental skates."
hockeyplayers,360ii2,unusedusername3,2,Sat May 16 02:38:39 2015 UTC,I find the best way to remember your gear is to never wash it or even air it out.

hockeyplayers,360ii2,gqgk,1 point,Sat May 16 01:34:36 2015 UTC,"Second this.  The number of times I've forgotten my jersey, socks, helmet, or any combination is too damn high."
hockeyplayers,360ii2,sumofparticles,6,Fri May 15 16:50:37 2015 UTC,"As a fellow rook I would say ask questions. Don't be insecure about it or annoying by asking vague questions but don't be afraid to ask about positioning, shooting, passing, etc. You're going to mess up and make mistakes, learn from them. Practice on your own time and your teammates will notice. Offer to buy the first round after the game. You are going to fall a lot, that's okay! Don't be the rookie who thinks he knows everything because he watches a lot of YouTube and NHL. Try not to take too long of shifts. Lastly hustle. Even if the game has a few minutes left, you're exhausted, and down by 3 goals still hustle."
hockeyplayers,360ii2,Tjmorgan303,4,Fri May 15 02:02:19 2015 UTC,"No reason to be nervous, man. You should be super excited to start playing some organized puck! As great as open hockey is, organized hockey - with a score keeper and refs - brings out another emotion. No matter what level you're playing, everybody there is paying their hard earned money to play just for the love of the game. At times, it will feel like game 7, and at times you'll simply not care... but no matter what you'll be playing the game that you love and that's more than most men can say. Good on ya man, and good luck!!"
hockeyplayers,360ii2,DavidACHE,2,Fri May 15 02:02:48 2015 UTC,"You'll have a great time. Watch the clock and take short shifts. It's easy to get stranded out there when you are getting used to the flow of play, but it can be a real bummer for your teammates. Keep it quick, and skate hard when you're on the ice. Have fun with it."
hockeyplayers,360ii2,thedarkginger,1 point,Fri May 15 02:05:46 2015 UTC,"Yep. You might be too excited to feel tired, and you'll stay out there way too long."
hockeyplayers,360ii2,sonnytlb,8,Fri May 15 11:56:40 2015 UTC,"Don't leave your skate guards on, haha. When I first started in an adult beginner league about 5 years ago I was so anxious and excited that I forgot to take my skate guards off. Instantly face planted the second I hit the ice.  To this day, 5 years later, I still check my skates one last time right before I step on the ice.... every single time."
hockeyplayers,360ii2,lmnopeee,1 point,Fri May 15 01:56:53 2015 UTC,I did this while coaching. My fellow coach came and snowed me. I too check every single time I step on the ice.
hockeyplayers,360ii2,unusedusername3,2,Sat May 16 02:39:52 2015 UTC,"Get there with enough time to get dressed and stretched before the game. If that means 1/2 hour for you, make it 1/2 hour.  Talk to your teammates, on the ice and on the bench. Listen to what they have to say. They'll help you with positioning and all kinds of things. Let them know that you've never played before and someone will make sure you know what's going on with line changes and who's playing which position(s).  Skate as hard as you can every shift (but try to remain in control of yourself, don't go so fast you can't stop or turn!), then get off the ice. Don't stay out for 5 minute shifts.  Most of all, don't take it too seriously. Don't get into a slashing match with the other team, don't yell at the refs, don't be ""that guy"". Have fun, drink beer."
hockeyplayers,360ii2,ANGR1ST,1 point,Fri May 15 02:05:54 2015 UTC,"This is all excellent advice. I'd also like to add to the line change part. Get to know who you're changing for. If you're a LW, find out who is playing LW the shift before yours and keep an eye out for them changing. That way you won't ever be caught off guard on a change."
hockeyplayers,360ii2,JOG_FORREST_JOG,1 point,Fri May 15 07:36:59 2015 UTC,"Your first game is gonna be shitshow, just suck it up and accept it. Everything's gonna seem too fast, you're gonna have butterflies because you don't want to screw up, and you're always going to wonder what you should be doing. The main upside is that everyone else will be going through the same thing.  Two most important things you can do in that first game is know your position and know who you're replacing on a line change. If you're a winger, do what wingers are supposed to do (youtube it). If you're defense play defense (youtube that too). If you're on the bench sort out ahead of time which body on the ice is yours to replace and watch them, not the game.   Everything else will kind of sort of itself out, once you get comfortable with those two things you can start to study the game."
hockeyplayers,360ii2,xzzy,1 point,Fri May 15 02:12:51 2015 UTC,"Don't be afraid of the puck. Be confident and chip the puck forward or make take-aways when you can.   One of the biggest things I see with beginners is positioning. If you haven't already, watch a few vids or look up a few articles on where to be on the ice.   You'll soon get your on-ice 'awareness'. Keeping your head up while skating and looking around to see where your teammates are.  It will be fun. Enjoy!"
hockeyplayers,360ii2,elementsix,1 point,Fri May 15 02:23:40 2015 UTC,"Follow the lead of your more experienced teammates. I guarantee they'll help with things your not totally sure about. I got all kinds of great help my first session, and I was playing with total strangers.  Also, don't be afraid to mess up. You are going to fall, crash into the boards, miss passes. It's OK, in a beginner level league everybody does. Pop back up and don't worry about it. You'll have a blast"
hockeyplayers,360ii2,orionthefisherman,1 point,Fri May 15 02:59:29 2015 UTC,"Make sure to listen to the advice your teammates give you. We have a few guys on our team who have barely skated before who get snippy when we try to give them advice, and are continually poor players and poor teammates because of it. Don't be those guys.   Obviously if your teammates are yelling at you instead of giving you constructive advice, that's different. But for the most part, listen to what your more experienced guys tell you."
hockeyplayers,360ii2,PointXIV,1 point,Fri May 15 03:46:59 2015 UTC,Don't take long shifts. I don't care if you pass it up the middle of the ice or have stupid give aways it's beginner it's expected you make dumb mistakes. What is the most annoying is your 3 minute shift that you wasted and messed up the lines while doing it.
hockeyplayers,360ii2,whatthefrickenfrack,1 point,Fri May 15 20:57:25 2015 UTC,Exactly I just joined myself and the other guy at my position stays on way to long.  So just to get ice time myself I stay a tad longer myself so I can actually play it's annoying.
hockeyplayers,360ii2,ChefOfTheWasteland,1 point,Sat May 16 02:33:35 2015 UTC,"Can you stop on skates?  If you can't then make sure you don't lose control of yourself.  Keep your head up when skating to make sure that you're not crashing into anyone and that no one is crashing into you.  Can you skate backwards decently well?  If so don't be afraid to volunteer to play defense.  Everyone is a beginner and everyone will be coming from different experiences.  In my beginner league there are a lot of people who are great skaters but have hands of stone or don't know the game well, people who know hockey really well but don't skate so good, people who are decent at everything but are in their 60s and 70s and don't have the speed anymore, it's all over the place.    If you're good at an aspect of the game don't be afraid to use it.  If you're fast then win foot races, if you have good hands then try some dekes, if you know the game then play your position like a pro.  If you're not good at any of those things then don't worry about it!  Above all just have fun.  Learn your teammates names and cheer them on, be friendly to everyone on the ice, joke around with your opponents, and give 100% on every shift."
hockeyplayers,35zxx4,whatthefrickenfrack,23,Thu May 14 22:41:08 2015 UTC,"I think it is stupid to wear a visor in any league with beginner or less experienced players. They are less mindful of their stick and don't have nearly as much control.   Playing in a high level league with people that have played juniors or very competitive hockey have much more care about what their doing, especially if they're wearing a visor themselves. However, it does only take one high shot or stick check and you could have a nice gash or lose a few teeth. At that point it's all personal preference to me."
hockeyplayers,35zxx4,OccupyDeezNutz,10,Thu May 14 23:39:44 2015 UTC,"This dude is right. I switched to a visor. It's like herpes. You can't go back. I want to. I like my teeth, but I can't. Not even once man."

hockeyplayers,35zxx4,Knobdy1,2,Sun May 17 12:54:11 2015 UTC,"Whenever the thought of switching to a visor starts to creep up on me, be it for perceived improved vision or to just look cooler on the ice, whatever the reason, I just watch world junior highlights to remind myself that visors have absolutely no impact on hockey skill. If Connor McDavid can lead the tourney in points alongside his cageless teammates, then I can probably stand to improve without resorting to using a visor.  And OP, enjoying a full dentition seems like a good enough reason for me!"
hockeyplayers,35zxx4,quantomicAnt,2,Fri May 15 00:13:59 2015 UTC,"I wear an Itech (Bauer? Whatever) Concept 2 full shield. Clear plastic up top, plastic ""bars"" at the bottom. Complete coverage with pretty good vision.  I wear glasses almost all the time so I don't like the feel of air rushing in my eyes when I'm wearing my contacts and moving quickly, so the shield is perfect.  Doesn't fog up as long as you keep it cleanish, I just wipe it down with water before the game. Never fogs when skating. Sometimes when sitting on the bench panting.  I've taken enough errant pucks and sticks off it to never play without one. Beer league players have a difficult time controlling their sticks and it's easy to get clipped, or take a deflection right in the grill. It hasn't gotten too scratched either, it's so close to your eyes that it takes a big scratch to be visible."
hockeyplayers,35zxx4,ANGR1ST,2,Fri May 15 01:52:10 2015 UTC,I have worn a visor for years and I will wear a visor again but in my current league I am switching to a cage. Five games in and one teammate is sidelined with a broken orbital from a puck and another has a gnarly gash above his eye from a stick. Foolishly I chaulked that up to bad luck until I took a stick to my nose/teeth last game. My face has taken its share of abuse with a visor and I was prepared for it because accidents happen. This season however the teams we are playing are not considerate nor do they play with regard for the safety of fellow players. Major penalties are up and sportsmanship has disappeared. I know its just a matter of time before it happens again this season and because of that I will wear a cage until I feel comfortable to switch back. If you are prepared for the occasional puck or stick to the mouth and your league isn't full of inconsiderate players then give it a shot otherwise stick to the cage.

Hockey is fun, but it's not worth losing my teeth at all. Once I accidentally chip someone's tooth during a game, he lifted my stick into his face while I was defending him. I feel bad for him when he confronted me, but what could I do?"
hockeyplayers,35zxx4,moutonbleu,2,Fri May 15 06:11:31 2015 UTC,My two fake front teeth always tell me to go with a cage.  I dont play in the NHL so there no need for me to risk getting hit in the face again.

hockeyplayers,35zxx4,BearintheWoods47,2,Fri May 15 16:59:49 2015 UTC,"Honestly, everyone here is going to tell you to wear a cage. Do what you want, just know that there will be a time where you have a facial injury. If that bothers you, then wear a cage. It's not an IF, it's a WHEN. You will definitely injure your face at some point, it's just when and how severe.  After college hockey ended, I took the cage off and haven't worn one since. I've broken my nose twice (only one required surgery), have had to have two teeth repaired and a few stitches over my left brow. Fairly minor for 12 years playing in intermediate and advanced leagues.   I enjoy the freedom I have playing without a cage, I can afford the medical costs associated with not wearing one, and when it comes down to it I truthfully don't care if I sustain an injury to my face."
hockeyplayers,35zxx4,austINfullEffect,3,Fri May 15 19:26:35 2015 UTC,"I haven't played much hockey, and its hard for me to get used to the cage over not having it. Although considering the helmet and cage will cost me under a hundred bucks, I consider it well spent over the pain and possible thousands on having to fix my teeth or face in the future.  I consider that the NHL players have the income and ability to get that work done on them if there is a problem, although I'm not one of them, and will take that cage over hurting my face any day."

hockeyplayers,35zxx4,RIPphonebattery,2,Fri May 15 01:51:49 2015 UTC,"Well i've got a good one. I was playing about a month ago in my league and was coming in down the left wing on a 2 on 1 as my buddy was going down the right carrying the puck. He sends a hard pass my way, the d man gets his stick blade on it, it was angled weird and the puck jumped up and hits me right in the chin. I wasn't in a bad place on the ice or blocking a shot or anything, just a freak accident. If it wasn't for my cage I would have lost teeth 100%. The weirdest thing is that I didn't even think about it until a couple shifts later the D man apologized for the shitty stick blade angle. My brain didn't even realize how close I'd been to losing teeth cuz the cage just stopped it and I kept playing.   Just think back to all the times where something has hit your cage. Now realize it only takes ONE of those times to lose teeth or vision or break your nose."
hockeyplayers,35zxx4,Lndbrghwrstlr,4,Thu May 14 23:51:53 2015 UTC,"I've been playing for a few years. People may call me stupid or lucky, but I used a cage for my first 3 weeks ever on ice. Then, I went straight to using a large visor with no fishbowl or cage component.  I've never once been scared about an opposing stick or skate around my area. Yeah, I know all it takes is one time to mess everything up for good. However, I play in a non-checking beer league and nobody is a try-hard in my area (Louisville, KY) so we're all pretty respectful of each other and know we just play for fun."

hockeyplayers,35zxx4,MadLibz,8,Thu May 14 23:39:07 2015 UTC,"Respect isn't the issue, especially for new players. You don't know how to control your stick when falling, and you probably fall a lot. Odds are there are guys like you in your league. Find yourself behind one of them when they fall and their stick goes flailing and say goodbye to your teeth.   I played for a 5 or so years with a visor and definitely enjoyed it, but as soon as I went from a competitive league with relatively talented and experienced players to a beer league with even the occasional guy who wasn't that experienced I put the cage back on. I've probably taken a dozen solid shots to the lower half of the cage this season alone from guys who just don't know how to control their stick."
hockeyplayers,35zxx4,RDC123,2,Thu May 14 23:43:15 2015 UTC,The league I play in this summer is about a B league. The guys so far 3 games we've played have been pretty good. Not so much the way ward stick I'm worried about more so just the puck getting deflected into my mouth.

Really, it all depends on the league you play in and the other teams. I've played in some chippy games, but everyone realizes we all have to get up and go to work the next day.   If you're curious about trying a visor, pick up a cheap one and give it a try. Worst case scenario is you don't like it, and you put your cage back on. Me, I love my visor and can't foresee myself putting a cage back on."

While playing I've taken so many sticks and pucks to the face that it's a non-issue for me on what's most important (my health).

hockeyplayers,35zxx4,OzziePao13,1 point,Fri May 15 07:20:28 2015 UTC,"Cages arent near as awful as they used to be. A lot of today's cages provide excellent vision, and will 100% protect your face. The key is finding the one that the bar levels are in line with your sight lines. Then taking the 1 game it takes to adjust.  People just try on any random cage, think it sucks, then dismiss it. I guess it boils down to this, I'm not going to miss one second of ice time due to an injury that could have been easily prevented. I've seem more than enough guys take errant pucks and sticks to the face that would have been a non factor if they had a cage. You are not getting paid to play or perform, and today's cages are pretty awesome at providing excellent vision. Fish bowls get way too hot btw."

I find them uncomfortable, limiting, and if I have to sweat wipe on the bench, I have to de-glove and fuck around with the snaps and what not...with the groups I play in, I am sometimes only getting 30 seconds or a minute on the bench, it is just not enough time.  That being said, cages do have benefits above protecting from pucks and errant sticks.  Additional cushioning space if you fall on your face, protection from punches, and an face protection when you headbutt the guy that just punched you.  It is going to come down to what you feel you need."
hockeyplayers,35zxx4,romple,1 point,Fri May 15 20:36:03 2015 UTC,"Lower levels, cage.   Higher levels of play a visor is a little easier to get away with.  Lower level guys don't pay attention to their sticks, don't have as much control on shots, and falling/flailing with skates and sticks flying through the air add to a greater chance of getting cracked in the face."

A majority of refs out there are going to suck. While there are some good ones, a majority are doing 2-5 games a night, and could care less if #13 assisted on a goal as opposed to #33. They aren't going to call every penalty, aren't going to get every stat right, and are going to miss a bunch of calls. It happens in every league."

hockeyplayers,363ino,Griffin23,2,Fri May 15 20:22:35 2015 UTC,"If the puck went in and it went on the scoreboard who cares about who gets the goal or the assist?

hockeyplayers,363ino,sachmet43,2,Fri May 15 20:33:26 2015 UTC,"My question is... Do you make sure the ref knows that you got the goal/assist. If you got a goal, point to your number so they see it and many times they will appreciate so they dont have to chase you down. For assists, many times a ref will give you assist if you tell them (sometimes even if you didnt even do anything). Many times when i saw a goal scored i had trouble keeping track of everyone involved from the play. Many times i knew who got the goal scored but forgot who got assists. Like i said before, after a goal is scored and you feel you got an assist/goal then tell them. They may already know, but many will appreciate you helping them out."
hockeyplayers,363ino,Leftwithnocookies,2,Fri May 15 21:36:52 2015 UTC,"Allow me to chime in as a ref whom I'm sure sometimes gets it wrong. I am trying my best to get the stats right, I also play and appreciate it when my stats are correct too. My suggestion is to mention to the refs when you score or get an assist; I know I appreciate it when someone does.  This is an example possible scenario - Player takes a shot, My thoughts ""Is it in?, yes it's in"" Signal the goal, ""Crap who took that shot?"" Players are already skating away... I'm first concerned with making sure I make the right call on whether it's a goal or not. Often times I will remember who took the shot, but trying to remember who assisted is a lot more challenging, sometimes I ask the player who scored and he's not even sure."

But I hardly ever walk with them on. I use them to protect the blade and my gear, that's all. Once I'm laced and ready to get up and get skating they come off. The rubber matting at the local rink isn't all that rough on blades to my knowledge.  If you have a different circumstance, like playing outdoors often, I'd think those plastic runners would be your best bet. They should hold up to more abuse than the cloth ones."

When I started playing ice it never made sense to switch. Kind of like reinventing the wheel. There are a lot of things that lefties - usually, I think - end up having to do with their right hands so there is actually a little more dexterity and fine motor control in the non-dominant hand (which is a theory based on my experience of course). Computer mouses, scissors, hand shakes, atm/running credit/debit cards in the readers, manual transmissions, hand shakes, etc all add up to lots of little ways that we build some extra dexterity in the right hand."
hockeyplayers,3606wj,MF26,2,Fri May 15 15:36:21 2015 UTC,"When I first started playing I didn't have my own gear or stick and had to borrow a friends stick (and rent gear). I'm right handed but when I played baseball I was a switch hitter so I figured I could work with whatever. Maybe it was because I was first playing and just sucked, but it didn't feel right. Got a lefty stick because they were easier to get for cheap and the internet said righties should use lefty sticks and it still didn't feel right until ~3 games later. Now it feels amazing. I didn't score a goal my first session. My second session I had a goal per game because I was getting flex on my wrist shots and what not.  Long story short. Try it a few games and see."

I think putting some honest hours into getting good muscle memory is probably a better bet than switching sides at this point.  If you really want to try ask for a buddy's stick at pickup or stick time and see if it feels even remotely natural then go from there.
hockeyplayers,3606wj,kr580,1 point,Fri May 15 00:25:11 2015 UTC,Switching hands isn't going to make you into Gretzky over night. You'll actually probably be worse at switching to lefty because you've at least got a little experience righty vs. zero lefty.

Even got off a decent slapper last Tuesday night. PING! hit the cross bar- but it felt really good.

Sometimes I think new people fuss about handedness too much.

hockeyplayers,3606wj,spartanKid,1 point,Fri May 15 04:07:54 2015 UTC,True. I bet most people end up shooting on the same side they naturally write with. I've just heard many times that you're supposed to go with the opposite because it's better when your dominant hand is at the top of the stick.

hockeyplayers,35ynpr,spartanKid,1 point,Fri May 15 02:46:27 2015 UTC,"I've never tried Howie's (haven't really seen it around here at all), but Renfrew is everywhere. Personally, I use a brand I find at Costco (can't really remember its name) since I find it to be the same quality as Renfrew, but cheaper since its in bulk. That being said, I usually have to retape due to my tape being cut up every game, not wearing off on the bottom, so I can't really speak about durability"
hockeyplayers,35ynpr,InsertUsrnameHere,1 point,Thu May 14 17:10:49 2015 UTC,I think you're thinking of R-brand.

hockeyplayers,35ynpr,somewhat_random,1 point,Tue May 19 13:41:33 2015 UTC,I started to use Blade Sharks instead of tape a few years ago.  Here is a link - http://www.bladesharksports.com/pages/hockey.  It is basically like sandpaper on your blade. Makes it a bit harder to receive a hard pass but your shot is quicker and harder. Lasts way longer than tape too.  After I tried them I just made my own by cutting out the shape from a roll of 3M peel and stick anti-slip floor tape.
hockeyplayers,35ynpr,AlexTheGreat,1 point,Thu May 14 19:10:06 2015 UTC,"Doesn't seem like it would protect the blade from absorbing water, or from the friction on the bottom of the blade."
hockeyplayers,35ynpr,somewhat_random,1 point,Fri May 15 16:00:43 2015 UTC,No it doesn't but I use a composite and I've never had trouble with delaminating or wear on the base of the blade. Perhaps because the shaft breaks long before that becomes an issue.
hockeyplayers,35ynpr,sterlingarcher0069,-8,Sat May 16 07:46:39 2015 UTC,"I know this sub has an equipment fetish, but it's just fucking tape. Get whatever is on sale, you're still going to miss the net."
hockeyplayers,35y9cx,SuperDave21,3,Thu May 14 14:53:27 2015 UTC,"You can always justify spending a little more on skates, especially considering they will last longer. IMO you should roll with the X90's but maybe specify the price too.   The liner will be much better at airing out the skate, which will go a long way. LS2 steel will make the skate lighter and hold an edge longer and if you're on the ice once a week you won't have to sharpen as frequently (more money in your wallet)."
hockeyplayers,35y9cx,MalkoDrefoy,1 point,Thu May 14 16:01:01 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply! I actually ended up going with the x90s for $340 shipped. The x70s were $205 shipped, and I figured that I should spend the little extra to get a more durable and performance driven skate."
hockeyplayers,35y9cx,owenstumor,2,Thu May 14 18:40:43 2015 UTC,"For what it's worth, I'm currently skating the x70's. I have beer league about twice a week and coach my kids team. They've held up great so far and I love them. I bought them when they first came out for $319, but if you can get the x90's for that much now, I'd get them, instead. They should be a great skate, especially at that price."
hockeyplayers,35y9cx,owenstumor,2,Thu May 14 20:46:23 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply! Yeah I ended up with the x90s, which should actually get here today. I'm glad I spent the extra money because it sounds like they'll hold up a bit longer. I play D so my skates take a pounding from shots and general grinding in the corner. I can only hope these last another 12 years like my XXs did haha."
hockeyplayers,35zjoo,Yewt,2,Thu May 14 20:49:32 2015 UTC,They are taking away the Reebok name. The new Tacks line is essentially a mix of the 20K and RBZ with their new foam technology
hockeyplayers,35zjoo,kingofthediamond,1 point,Thu May 14 21:04:30 2015 UTC,"The RBZ line is continuing actually, and the tacks don't have a huge amount of that foam in them.  They are more of a continuation of the reebok line renter than a combination of the RBZ with reebok.    The new foam is called D3o and it's different than what was in the RBZ."
hockeyplayers,35zjoo,stevegcook,1 point,Thu May 14 23:29:03 2015 UTC,I wasnt sure what to call the D3o lol But they put some RBZ characteristics in the Tacks line

hockeyplayers,35zjoo,stevegcook,1 point,Thu May 14 23:30:43 2015 UTC,Could you possibly post pictures and compare the feeling between the new line and the 20K? I really like the strap from the 20K compared to the elastic velcro on almost all top end models except the 20K (during a game my elbow pads velcro often loosen up and my elbow pads never stays in place) so I was thinking with the strap system on the 20K it could potentially fix my problem. (Also like the elbow cap on the 20k that isn't a huge spike that would kill anyone)

hockeyplayers,35ymwq,kr580,3,Thu May 14 18:28:22 2015 UTC,"I'll second this. It's a team game, so the people you play alongside make a huge difference to how much fun you'll have."
hockeyplayers,35ymwq,PixelCanuck,1 point,Thu May 14 20:33:14 2015 UTC,"My advice on this topic is always the same:  If you want to play for fun, then play for fun only. Play with the people you can have fun with, and if you're better than that standard, then play down and just have fun, because thats why you are there.  If you want to improve, then you play a mix. I am a firm believer you cannot realistically improve unless you play at least three times a week. You play up, down, and in the middle of your skill pool. Play up to challenge yourself and occasionally fail, down to try new things and build confidence, and in the middle to test yourself and measure progress."
hockeyplayers,35ymwq,ICEYSports,1 point,Thu May 14 21:32:10 2015 UTC,Go B or C. Its better to start low and even if you tear it up for a season then you have fun for a season and next one you move up
hockeyplayers,35ymwq,SeanP21,1 point,Fri May 15 02:20:28 2015 UTC,"Good advice everyone. I'm in it for the fun. I was just a bit concerned that at too low of a level I'll be doing more of watching guys learn how to play, than actually playing. But the leagues aren't that long so it probably is a good idea to just join up with the guys that invited me and then I can always move next session if I want to.   I don't really have a position as I've never played organized, but I've always enjoyed offense more and being able to score. But I suppose no matter how bad my team is, if I drop back on defense I'll always get good action coming at me."

hockeyplayers,35wt9i,bigvinnysd,12,Thu May 14 04:08:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah for the hard passes you crack them so they slow right down. The trick is to get the puck in front of you into an area you can control the it as soon as you can. It takes a bit of practice, but some weight on the stick and the right blade angle will do wonders."
hockeyplayers,35wt9i,howtohockeydotcom,3,Thu May 14 04:25:53 2015 UTC,"What J said, lean on that stick and angle it front of you, or use the skate to angle to the stick if you must."
hockeyplayers,35wt9i,von_neumann,3,Thu May 14 06:22:52 2015 UTC,"If you're all alone and receiving the pass (meaning there's no defender on you so you don't need to make an immediate move), then I would do what you said.  Leaving your stick and hands kind of loose as the puck hits your blade. The stick will wobble and rebound away, but the puck will stop where it contacts the blade.   If you need to make an immediate move after catching the pass, then you will need to have very quick, but soft hands to cradle the puck while slowing it as fast and gently as possible, and keeping it in the middle of your blade so you can make the next move.  This is very difficult to do, and a pretty high level ability.  See Kane do it in this video: https://youtu.be/SkRNN3xbRf0?t=149"
hockeyplayers,35wt9i,throatsplooshers,1 point,Thu May 14 16:56:56 2015 UTC,"Absolutely correct. If you just keep a soft grip and let the puck make contact, it shouldn't bounce more than a foot or two. You can angle the blade in a way that causes that bounce to be ahead of you. It's similar to tipping a shot off the ice, but you use a soft touch rather than a firm one and then chase down the bounce."
hockeyplayers,35wt9i,hockeyplaya9810,3,Thu May 14 20:00:33 2015 UTC,How are you catching a pass at all with 1 hand?
hockeyplayers,35wt9i,acholon,2,Thu May 14 17:33:59 2015 UTC,Are you saying the pass is too far in front of you to catch with both hands?
hockeyplayers,35wt9i,PavelDatsyuk1,1 point,Thu May 14 05:14:30 2015 UTC,"No, for some reason I feel like the best way to receive the pass is to loosely hold it with my top hand and let the stick flop and vibrate. As a result I end up kind of out of control and crash into a goalie who is just laughing at me."
hockeyplayers,35wt9i,shotgoto,2,Thu May 14 05:23:29 2015 UTC,That's how I've been doing it. I have a bad habit of stopping the puck too close to my skates where I sometimes skate over it :(
hockeyplayers,35wt9i,PCsuperiority,2,Thu May 14 05:38:16 2015 UTC,I do that regularly but I just angle the foot that off the ground inwards and kick it to my stick
hockeyplayers,35wt9i,Nikolaoss,2,Thu May 14 06:28:35 2015 UTC,I do that a ton actually. I take hard passes as I'm skating forward with one hand on the stick loosely. I find the puck reverbs off the stick and never goes more than a foot around the front of my stick.
hockeyplayers,35wt9i,SublaciniateCarboloy,2,Thu May 14 07:24:51 2015 UTC,Take the pass in stride and try to lead it ahead of you so you can start pushing it with some speed.
hockeyplayers,35wt9i,win_ton8,2,Thu May 14 17:15:36 2015 UTC,receive the pass... unless it is like 3 feet off the ground treat it like any other pass... if you just lean on your stick it will likely flip over your blade or slide off the heel of your blade. It is obviously not as easy to receive a harder pass but that's the way to do it..
hockeyplayers,35wt9i,jesusisaslut,1 point,Thu May 14 19:38:36 2015 UTC,You've got to really use soft hands and carry the puck across your body as you catch it. You will be susceptible to big hits because this takes longer and your head may be down more.
hockeyplayers,35wpgh,PlatinumPancake,8,Thu May 14 03:31:07 2015 UTC,"Steps to learning a skill are explanation, demonstration, imitation, correction, and repetition.   You've got the first two, you've likely imitated, now you need some correction and LOTS of repetition. Since you probably don't have a coach you will need to know the technique well enough to correct yourself. You could take a video and compare to some NHL clips, or practice with a friend who can do it.   I can't stress repetition enough No matter how well your brain knows what to do, it takes a while for your muscles to be able to do it."
hockeyplayers,35wpgh,howtohockeydotcom,1 point,Thu May 14 04:22:08 2015 UTC,"Right now I'm stuck on imitation. In theory, I know how the move is done, but I'm having trouble performing it on the ice. I'll try taking a look at some NHL vids. Thanks again man."
hockeyplayers,35wpgh,soonahn,3,Thu May 14 04:33:23 2015 UTC,"REPETITION  When I was learning to do these transitions, I'd go to public skate, and just do them up and down the ice. Slow speed, fast speed, left transition, right transition, etc. Off the ice, if I had to turn around, I'd make the same feet maneuvers I needed to on the ice.  Everytime I fell, I knew I was a little closer to getting them down, because each fall taught me something.  As I was getting up, I'd have to think about why I fell. Was I low enough? Were my feet wide enough a part? Did I just move my feet, or did I open my hips up too?  I'd play the fall over again in my head as I got up, tried to picture what I did wrong, and just go at it again, trying to correct the mistake.  I still have a hard time transitioning on my left side, and I still go to public skate and do the exact same thing.  Took me about a week until I had them down well enough to stop thinking about it in a game.  However, it took 3, 2 hour long public skate sessions of just falling and trying again."
hockeyplayers,35wpgh,glid3r,1 point,Thu May 14 05:59:18 2015 UTC,"Off the ice, if I had to turn around, I'd make the same feet maneuvers I needed to on the ice.   Doing this helped me a lot on my weak side. Getting used to and comfortable with the motion off ice, made for an easier transition during public skate.  I was surprised that I was more comfortable with transitions to my weak stopping side. I struggle more with transitioning to my strong stopping side"
hockeyplayers,35wpgh,howtohockeydotcom,2,Thu May 14 15:54:12 2015 UTC,You have to fail a lot before you get close to getting it. Every failure is one step closer to getting it
hockeyplayers,35wpgh,Vargatron,5,Thu May 14 15:00:47 2015 UTC,"One thing that really helped me was making sure that I was turning my upper body along with my feet as I did the transition, specifically my chest. Also, stay low in your stance to provide a stable base, that way if you mess up the transition you still have a chance to recover and stay up on your skates.  Another good exercise I like to do is pick an imaginary spot on the center of the rink and just focus on keeping that spot in your vision. If you're skating around in a circle, you'll have to do several transitions each circuit to keep everything in your vision."
hockeyplayers,35wpgh,xzzy,3,Thu May 14 15:27:39 2015 UTC,"One thing that unexpectedly helped my transitions was backwards one foot glides. We've all done these skating forwards.. stand on one foot, glide a 180 degree turn, then switch feet and do 180 degrees the other way. Now do that backwards. This helps a lot with building edge confidence, which is useful when it comes time to shift your weight in a transition.  Another thing to keep in mind is it's easier to transition when you're skating a circle than a straight line. So to start off skate around one of the faceoff circles and work on getting comfortable transitioning there. This will eventually help transitions on straight lines.  It's normal as a beginner for a transition to involve shaving a lot of ice. Everyone does it because transitions aren't a natural activity and it takes effort to train your body into accepting the reality of what's going on. Just keep in mind is that the end goal is to not scrape your blades on the ice when transitioning.. it's just gonna slow you down."
hockeyplayers,35wpgh,shelvedtopcheese,3,Thu May 14 15:38:51 2015 UTC,Try working on your groin flexibility and strength. Also try practicing mohawk turns.

hockeyplayers,35wpgh,traveler2014,3,Thu May 14 04:31:20 2015 UTC,"Knee bend lowers center of gravity, practice the transition as slow with as good of balance you can. Working the mechanics over and over. You should be stepping out and throwing your hips"
hockeyplayers,35wpgh,Skyline_BNR34,1 point,Thu May 14 04:42:42 2015 UTC,"I just learned this not too long ago, and the key I found was staying low. Knees bent as acholon said. Much easier to do it at higher speeds."
hockeyplayers,35wpgh,pavlovs_monkey,2,Thu May 14 12:22:50 2015 UTC,"Go to public skates and just skate and practice.  Best thing to do is go slow, put all your weight on the front foot, then turn that rear foot backwards while slowly skating and put all of your weight onto that foot.  And it's going to be one fluid motion of transitioning your weight from foot to foot.  If it helps kinda slightly jump up from your front foot to get that weight going to the rear foot."
hockeyplayers,35wpgh,von_neumann,2,Thu May 14 05:48:52 2015 UTC,"Hard to say what the secret is. After two years of play, I finally started getting these with any sort of confidence, and still need a lot of work. For myself, it was that I was trying to push off one foot, shifting my balance to the foot on the ice after I was already on one foot. I've only just started to get success by not launching, but simply lifting, the foot. Good luck!"

You will be racking up the points in no time I'm sure. Just keep skating as much as you can, preferably with a puck. Find a dropin/pickup game and make it like religion. Dropin hockey with the right group is probably the funnest game ever played."
hockeyplayers,35vtuw,von_neumann,1 point,Thu May 14 06:33:02 2015 UTC,I'll be hitting up the stick and puck tomorrow and if I feel good enough maybe drop in later that night.

hockeyplayers,35wx8y,Griffin23,8,Thu May 14 04:52:28 2015 UTC,It is usually better to not think about it and just act on instinct. The issue is developing the situational awareness to have the correct instinct. You might try visualization (almost meditation). Think back about the time you made the shitty cross ice pass...what should you have done...visualize yourself taking the correct action. Hopefully next time you will recognize the situation and your instinct will be right.
hockeyplayers,35wx8y,JackEsq,3,Thu May 14 05:40:47 2015 UTC,I suppose it essentially comes down to bad habits and conditioning yourself to get rid of them

If you really need to fix some bad habits, try to focus on them one or two at a time. Seriously, something small. Don't think today I'm going to work on my positioning. Think, today I'm going to be in the right position at the start of the break out in our defensive zone. Of course, right place has meant different things on different teams. On my team it's at the hash marks, butt on the boards, stick down and head up."
hockeyplayers,35wx8y,harry_h00d,6,Sat May 16 02:56:50 2015 UTC,"Do your thinking pre-game. This may sound nutty, but the day of a game, I take time here and there and visualize plays that might happen during the game. As a d-man, I usually envision various breakouts/situations in my own zone, and myself making the correct play. Getting myself mentally prepared this way enables me to act instinctually on the ice, as my mind is already conditioned to the various situations, and the correct play I need to make"
hockeyplayers,35wx8y,harry_h00d,2,Thu May 14 14:39:51 2015 UTC,"That sounds like it'd help, I'm also a defenceman as well so being able to see the play developing and predicting what will happen is crucial"
hockeyplayers,35wx8y,kriskringle19,2,Thu May 14 14:42:02 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Obviously, nothing teaches you the game like playing it, but visualization techniques have worked for me (and still do, even in beer league).   When in doubt, glass and out!"
hockeyplayers,35wx8y,somewhat_random,2,Thu May 14 14:59:51 2015 UTC,"I agree, this is somewhat relevant. Tonight at practice we had a bunch of stations for different drill setups. One was three cones making a triangle in the center ice circle.  We apparently had to do figure 8s on one side, going round the cones from the outside outside inside outside outside inside outside inside. Right. It was way too complicated, and made the drill not as effective IMO because we were all trying to remember the specific order, instead of focusing on skating, pivoting, crossovers, etc. Overthinking didn't seem to work"
hockeyplayers,35wx8y,gqgk,2,Thu May 14 05:14:54 2015 UTC,Practice at drop-in or with friends at a lower level so you are not panicked and have bit more time. Once you get used to taking the extra beat it comes naturally
hockeyplayers,35wx8y,ltdan123,1 point,Thu May 14 06:10:44 2015 UTC,"I really would agree with this one. My first big jump in ability came from thinking ahead of time, ""if the puck comes to me right now, what should I do with it?"" After doing that, I stopped a lot of bad habits I've seen in my beginner league. I try to make sure at any given time I know where everyone else on my team is too. That really helps me to not be the guy that just smacks the puck down ice and always gets icing called."

Going by ""instinct"" won't help you very much if your ""instinct"" is telling you to do the wrong things.  It's important to know what your job is in each of the zones.  If you're a winger, where should you be when the other team has the puck in your defensive zone?  Why should you be there?  What happens when your team now takes possession of the puck?  Where do you go? Why?  When your team is breaking the puck out of the zone, and the puck is on the other side, where do you go? Why?  What if the break out is on your side?  Where are you looking to pass? Why?   Does your team/linemates talk about what type of forecheck to do?  Do you know where you're supposed to go if you're the 2nd or 3rd man in on a rush?    If you can answer these questions correctly, then you will have to think less while on the ice, because you will already know what to do and where to go.    Also, talking to your linemates about situations helps, because it gives you guys an idea of where to expect each other.  Most people don't realize how much of this stuff is engrained into professional players brains.... it looks like they just make perfect decisions all the time.  In reality, its because they've done it, and have been doing it every day since they were 6 years old.  They talk to each other on the bench, on the ice, in the locker room, at practice.  There is a lot of planning and communication that goes on."
hockeyplayers,35wx8y,whenantelopesfly,2,Thu May 14 20:31:59 2015 UTC,"If you find that your instinct in certain situations is failing you, you need to re-train that instinct through practice.  Thinking about it in game isn't going to help because it's mostly muscle memory anyways, you'll end up destroying both your instinct and your mentality/confidence.  That's basically just what practice is for anyways."
hockeyplayers,35wx8y,lmnopeee,2,Thu May 14 21:14:57 2015 UTC,I spend my time on the ice focused on a single lyric from whatever song I listened to on the way there. I just dissect it and analyze it in my mind while my body takes over the whole hockey thing.
hockeyplayers,35wx8y,senor_fox,2,Fri May 15 02:59:41 2015 UTC,"I've been playing hockey for 20 years. After high school I didn't play for about 7 years, then I finally started back up. Up through high school everything came natural to me and I was very good at not making mistakes. Starting back up at 25 years old I realized I wasn't that kid anymore. LOTS of mental mistakes. LOTS of turn overs. My game was a mess.  This is what has helped me.  Be patient and keep your head up as much as you can. Instead of forcing a pass, don't be afraid to hold onto the puck too long. It's almost always better to let someone smother you in the boards than it is to literally pass the puck directly to the other team with a shitty cross ice pass. It also really helps to know where you SHOULD go with the puck in most situations. You can give that area a quick glance and make a decision. If your guy isn't there or you can't pull it off, eat the puck and wait for someone to come help you.  If you practice patience, I promise you'll realize that you have a lot more time than you think you have."

hockeyplayers,35tpu9,GoSioux14,3,Wed May 13 17:33:38 2015 UTC,"I've gone into the boards about every which way and I've found the most painless ways were either back first as it disperses the force over a larger area or feet first but using my legs as suspension to soften the impact rather than locking my legs out. The latter can be pretty nice because then you can launch yourself off the boards, twist and get up on your feet and you can get a free little boost."
hockeyplayers,35tpu9,littlejeets,2,Wed May 13 17:38:48 2015 UTC,"First and foremost: keep your head up.  This is something you learn as a kid in rec leagues that many beer leaguers might not know. If you're going into the boards head-first, keep your head up. Broken necks happen when you keep your head down. And while whiplash is no fun, it's a whole hell of a lot better than neck-down paralysis.  Otherwise, try to keep your body square. Injuries most often happen when limbs bend in ways they're not supposed to. This happens more often when your body impacts at an angle. If your body is twisted, then you're already putting stress on those joints. The impact will be even more stress.  Once you can get square, do what you can to absorb the impact. Let your pads take the blow if they can. Shinpads are designed to take your entire mass when you fall. It will still hurt, but you won't break anything. Otherwise, try to keep the impact to as broad an area as possible. If you're falling sideways into the boards, resist the urge to stick out your arm -- you're more likely to hyperextend an elbow or tear a shoulder ligament. Instead, let your broadside bear the impact, if you can."

hockeyplayers,35tpu9,maradonuts,1 point,Wed May 13 13:39:09 2015 UTC,"Feet up and I take it on the ass and if I can twist I take it on the hip and usually whiplash my shoulder in to the boards.  If you don't wear shoulders then I'd take it on the breezers but I wouldn't go in straight up on your tailbone.  That could lead to a back injury, that's why I always get my feet up and twist to take it on the hip if I can.  It's going to hurt no matter what.  My biggest fear is the head first stuff.  I did it last week and had no options.  I twisted my chin to the side and took it on the neck/shoulder.  Still sore."
hockeyplayers,35tpu9,Belsekar,1 point,Wed May 13 16:01:27 2015 UTC,"I tend to treat it more or less like a check, taking most of the impact with my hips and shoulders."
hockeyplayers,35tpu9,IndependentBoof,1 point,Wed May 13 19:53:54 2015 UTC,I try to get my legs away from the boards and go in with a less bent part of my body (I.e. my trunk) I usually ball up a little and get my knees and ankles as far away from trouble as possible.
hockeyplayers,35tpu9,the-garden-gnome,1 point,Wed May 13 13:42:02 2015 UTC,"If you're sliding in but have a second to think before impact, go feet first and use your legs like a spring. Soften the blow and it'll help a lot. If you're going in fast and have no choice I guess probably hitting with your back is the best of the worst. Avoid getting an ankle caught and you definitely don't want to hit your shoulders/head hard. A dislocated shoulder or concussion takes much longer to heal than a bruised back"
hockeyplayers,35tpu9,Jthedude17,1 point,Wed May 13 18:26:41 2015 UTC,"The best way is anyway you can control, I would guess. If you can get adjusted and brace for impact. At higher speeds or weird angles I would do what a lot of other people have recomenned and just try to spread the force out over as much of your body as possible. Protecting your head should be number 1 if all else fails."

If you're being forechecked close, embrace the contact and go in slow and sideways while staying puckside. Don't skate straight at the walls."

It's because of university I got into the sport 3 years ago, and I haven't looked back since; it's the first sport I've played that I'm truly passionate about.

hockeyplayers,35slgm,yacadelic,2,Wed May 13 05:33:13 2015 UTC,That's where I'm looking! Their selection is really impressive. The only problem for me is the flex is really high (I weigh next to nothing for my height) but other than that I can barely believe the prices.
hockeyplayers,35slgm,NotLawReview,1 point,Wed May 13 05:44:40 2015 UTC,Oh i see. I cannot relate as i am 6'2 260 hahaha.  What flex are you looking for?
hockeyplayers,35slgm,spartanKid,1 point,Wed May 13 14:14:49 2015 UTC,"This answer right here. I'm 6'5"" and have had this problem (tried extensions, don't waste your time as they destroy the performance of the stick) and I bought a 64"" stick from this site and it made such a huge difference in my game (and I think the next stick I get will be 66"" as I think I could use 2 more). I got an 85 flex which is about perfect for me as i'm like you in that I'm very lean at 185. Last I checked they had one or two in this flex at 64"""
hockeyplayers,35slgm,keytoitall,3,Wed May 13 22:50:40 2015 UTC,"Semi-off topic but why not put a plug in a stock stick? You could make a Chara-esque 65"" stick if you wanted. Bump the flex up 10 and get a plug for $5 (wood) or $20 (crabon), and they're re-useable."
hockeyplayers,35slgm,stevetehpirate,5,Wed May 13 06:05:38 2015 UTC,Extensions! No reason to get pro stocks simply because of height.

hockeyplayers,35slgm,Bluearmy69,2,Wed May 13 04:20:28 2015 UTC,"Great, thanks. Now I'm just curious about why more people don't buy them. One site I found lists the length of each stick, so that's no problem now. Only problem might be flex because it seems like it's typically a lot higher (which makes sense), and curve, which seems like a bit of a gamble."
hockeyplayers,35slgm,kr580,1 point,Wed May 13 04:23:51 2015 UTC,"I think a big reason many people don't buy them is that they just simply don't know about them. Also, many people would rather go into a store, see and try the stick out, than gamble with flex and curve online (I think if you spend enough time, you can find what you want, so it's not that big of a gamble). If you can find what you want, pro stock sticks are a great deal, only drawback being no warranty. However, some of the ones I've seen have thicker shafts than retail, so they're more durable."
hockeyplayers,35slgm,kr580,1 point,Wed May 13 16:29:05 2015 UTC,"Personally I don't always get them because I am very picky about flex and curve. Have been for 10 years. However anytime I see a pro stock with the right height, curve, and flex I buy it. I've got like a stash of 4 right now. That way if I ever break one I don't have to spend ~$200 for a high quality stick because I have a pro stock I've had for 2 years that I got for a hundred bucks."

hockeyplayers,35pgvk,lostincbus,2,Tue May 12 21:12:24 2015 UTC,you play on a tier 3 team that tracks stats online?

hockeyplayers,35rg6w,apbenoit,2,Tue May 12 22:07:19 2015 UTC,If you like the gloves to be real tight across the top of your hand and down to your finger tips they will be great. I like a bit more room for my hands so I will be getting some Supremes next.
hockeyplayers,35rg6w,conrad_bastard,3,Tue May 12 22:18:42 2015 UTC,I thought the Supreme's were tighter? Aren't Supreme's anatomical fitted?   I have vapor gloves and mine feel looser than Supreme's I've tried
hockeyplayers,35rg6w,Landartz,1 point,Wed May 13 01:22:32 2015 UTC,"I tried both gloves on last week at hockey giant. You can definitely feel the taper of the vapor line across the top of the hand down to the fingers. The supreme may be a bit tighter toward the wrist, but I didn't notice it."
hockeyplayers,35rg6w,conrad_bastard,2,Wed May 13 01:37:31 2015 UTC,"I own a pair of supremes and switched to vapors.  The supremes are just as tight as the vapors in the fingers, and they are tight in the cuff.  The vapor line are tight in the fingers and then get loose and have more room at the cuff, and then the nexus or 4-roll are loose in the fingers and cuff."
hockeyplayers,35rg6w,F0rdo,1 point,Wed May 13 02:31:28 2015 UTC,Supremes are definitely tighter all around. Vapors widen at the wrist
hockeyplayers,35rg6w,Fireonahill,1 point,Wed May 13 06:43:30 2015 UTC,Just going by what I felt. I will have to go back and try them again. Thanks for the heads up.
hockeyplayers,35rg6w,conrad_bastard,1 point,Wed May 13 06:46:33 2015 UTC,"You probably should've asked for comments before you bought them but...  I think it's a looser fitting glove. Compared to the warrior AX2's I have, Bauer x80s have shorter fingers and looser. They do not have plastic inserts though, but the cuffs don't really interfere with my wrist."
hockeyplayers,35rg6w,shotgoto,1 point,Tue May 12 23:42:04 2015 UTC,"Haven't bought them yet, I'm getting the money to buy them this week and buying them in a few, but thank you for your help!"
hockeyplayers,35rg6w,F0rdo,1 point,Tue May 12 23:46:52 2015 UTC,"I own a pair of Supreme one.8's and a vapor x80's.  I love my vapors.  They are really light weight and feel great when you first put them on.  There was virtually no break in period.  I have been playing twice a week with them since christmas and they have been holding up better than I thought.  I tape the top of my stick and my left hand is more wore down than my right (I'm righty) but that's expected.  The fit is tight in the fingers, but then it gets loose around the top of the hand and cuff.  It feels a lot less restrictive than the supremes that I own, but that is just my opinion."
hockeyplayers,35rg6w,shelvedtopcheese,1 point,Wed May 13 02:35:13 2015 UTC,You should try to find a leather patch from a shoe repair shop. I've heard that sewing one of those where the butt-end of your stick tends to rub will prevent wear entirely and not affect the glove.
hockeyplayers,35rg6w,besessen,1 point,Tue May 19 14:41:06 2015 UTC,I had the Vapor x80's and wore a hole in the thumb of my lower hand relatively quickly.  Could've just been a defective pair but I've since switched to Reebok.
hockeyplayers,35rg6w,mjspaz,1 point,Wed May 13 06:25:25 2015 UTC,I play with bauer vapor x20's. I personally love the fit. When I eventually replace them it will likely be for a higher end pair of vapors.

Choking up on the stick and getting low were the 2 most important factors in improving my numbers. Also looking at the ref's hand helped a lot too. As soon as that hand moves, swipe that stick!"
hockeyplayers,35obbj,skaughtx0r,3,Tue May 12 15:00:17 2015 UTC,"I'll have to check those out, I ended up taking my first ever faceoff during a penalty kill yesterday when I realized we didn't have a center on the ice."
hockeyplayers,35obbj,cgvandam,1 point,Tue May 12 17:47:41 2015 UTC,Yeah...I get stuck at the face off dot sometimes too. About half the time I lose the face off. The other half of the time I get my stick ripped out of my hands and I lose the face off.
hockeyplayers,35obbj,nashinga,8,Tue May 12 23:36:45 2015 UTC,Could you post some links? Curious to see what helped and what didnt.

hockeyplayers,35obbj,mikepick,3,Tue May 12 14:15:19 2015 UTC,"On a related note, I loved this exchange in the HBO series with Giroux and Ott. Giroux wins it easily with a clean insert and pull, makes it look easy. If you can make that first move to get your stick in and close off the other guy, you're golden.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dkHn3ciJxiY"
hockeyplayers,35obbj,xzzy,2,Thu May 14 23:26:27 2015 UTC,One resource you can tap for specific faceoff advice is your referees. They get the best view in the house and see thousands of faceoffs. They also tend to be players themselves so are going to be able to give excellent pointers.  Slide 'em a beer and start chatting. Youtube is helpful but nothing replaces on the spot critique.
hockeyplayers,35obbj,bananax182,2,Tue May 12 18:33:57 2015 UTC,Shittt I didn't win a single one in my last game. Thanks for bringing up the topic and sharing the vids.
hockeyplayers,35obbj,mikepick,2,Tue May 12 18:40:45 2015 UTC,"One thing that I try to do is be adaptable. Try to win clean, and if you can't, change up to jamming your stick in before you pull, or simply wacking the oppo center's stick as they try to draw, or tie up and kick or get your winger in to grab the puck. Forehand and backhand are also both useful in different situations, I can usually win forehand 9/10 when in the defensive zone with a forehand bank off the boards towards the low d-man."
hockeyplayers,35obbj,dazosan,1 point,Tue May 12 20:58:16 2015 UTC,I usually switch from forehand to backhand depending on what the side of the ice the faceoff is on -- I've been burned too many times winning a faceoff in the offensive zone towards the center of the ice only to have an opposing wing jump past everyone and grab it.
hockeyplayers,35obbj,tgoace,1 point,Wed May 13 14:08:26 2015 UTC,God I love Jeremy's videos and I've watched them all repeatedly. I can't improve though. I'm my own problem.

hockeyplayers,35qj6k,Captain_Murica91,6,Tue May 12 18:06:32 2015 UTC,"Go to drop in and get a feel for what position you want to play. You need to be very good at skating backwards if you want to play defense.  Plus you never know what you might like once you're doing it - I started out thinking I wanted to be LW, but switched to goalie after a month and never looked back.   Seriously, just get out there and play drop in for a while if you can. It's going to be really tough to take what you have read and translate it to playing yourself. You need to develop your ability to read a situation from ice-level, etc."
hockeyplayers,35qj6k,StephasaurusRexy,5,Tue May 12 18:25:27 2015 UTC,"I cannot second going to drop in enough, go into it expecting people around you to be considerably better, but it will give you a feel for the pace at which you are able to play"
hockeyplayers,35qj6k,Tom_s3rv0,2,Tue May 12 18:40:39 2015 UTC,"Exactly, find a few drop-in games, and make them like religion. Also, this is generally how you work your way onto a team."

Plus at drop-in no one wants to play D, so I can get more ice time and actually put effort towards that skill set."
hockeyplayers,35qj6k,YoMikeyiPhone,1 point,Tue May 12 19:31:40 2015 UTC,"It is very true that no one wants to play D in drop in, also, dude, midget is not the preferred nomenclature...

hockeyplayers,35qj6k,CSGustav,3,Tue May 12 22:36:40 2015 UTC,midget is not the preferred nomenclature   Not sure if this is a joke.

Players are classified by age, with each age group playing in its own league. The rules, especially as it relates to body contact, vary from class to class. In North America, the rules are governed by the national bodies, Hockey Canada and USA Hockey, while local hockey associations administer players and leagues for their region. Many provinces and states organize regional and provincial championship tournaments, and the highest age groups in Canada also participate in national championships.

hockeyplayers,35qj6k,Malarowski,2,Tue May 12 18:41:43 2015 UTC,"The main thing as a defender is to be extremely mobile to be able to react to the opponents. Size is a non-issue if you can move to where you need to be. Beyond the basics, that is really the key. You need to be able to move from forward to backward to forward and sideways as efficiently and smoothly as possible, otherwise the attacking Forward will just undress you and your size and knowledge is not good for anything. Also one important thing is to stay mentally involved. On defense at times there is seemingly nothing for you to do (if Forward cycle puck deep) until suddenly you have to defend a 1on1 at full speed, for me that was the biggest issue as I lost focus and wouldn't be in the right spot to defend."
hockeyplayers,35qj6k,CSGustav,1 point,Tue May 12 19:21:16 2015 UTC,Thanks!
hockeyplayers,35qj6k,Malarowski,2,Tue May 12 19:30:42 2015 UTC,"To add onto /u/Malarowski - The biggest thing that has helped me on D is telling myself ""you're not in the play - are all of their skaters in front of you - 1,2,3,4,5 - move your feet.""    Being flat footed is really easy to do and its a sure fire way to wear yourself out.  Going from a stop to a sprint is a huge energy sap, so keep some momentum in the direction you think the play is heading.  Also, good luck.  You're about to have a shit ton of fun."

Using your reach to poke check (keeping your arms close to you and using that quick extend will catch people offguard). I'm not the great backwards skater (can't crossover for shit, but years of inline skating helped.  Honestly, if you've never played in a league and never played competitively. Look into some learn to play classes, they'll focus on drills and will be the best thing to get you into hockey shape. If you are just looking to play hockey for fun, just got to drop in sessions. But if you are competitive, make sure you are comfortable before stepping into that sort of environment."
hockeyplayers,35qj6k,1966mopar,2,Tue May 12 21:42:35 2015 UTC,"Like everyone is saying, just go out and play to get a feel for what works best for you.   I play defense mostly for the few teams I play for. Being able to skate backwards faster than the attacking forward is a huge must, in my opinion. Also lateral movement while skating backwards.   From that, gap control is another big factor you will need to be able to do. That's skating backwards while the attacking forward is coming in on you and you decrease the amount of space between the two of you eliminating his ability to get around you. Watch their upper body, not the puck. Watch the great defenseman in the NHL do this.   The bigger guys on my team that are not the most mobile on the ice typically play wing. They work at screening the goalie, getting in his way in the crease. They'll cover the points in the defensive zone."
hockeyplayers,35qj6k,curtis7272,2,Tue May 12 20:49:51 2015 UTC,"I've played D for 17 years now. Started out playing d and I still do today. Communication is key and knowing what your d partner is capable of doing. Big part for D is reading and seeing plays before they develop, knowing when to pinch on the line and when to drop back. Patient is also key, when receiving the puck whether in your zone or their zone you want to control the puck and look before you pass or dump, obviously some situations you can't always do this. Seems straight forward but when you are on the ice I see so many guys get the puck and instantly dump it or turn it over. Also Don't always feel like you need to pass since you play D , skating the puck up a bit will open up the rest of the ice for a pass."

Don't expect to learn everything over night and playing with people with a higher skill level can get overwhelming at times but remember your new and trying to learn.

hockeyplayers,35qj6k,coppish,1 point,Wed May 13 00:04:39 2015 UTC,"You really need to have good communication with your goalie and other defenseman. You also need to be really good at reading plays because you want to balance staying in the play in the offensive zone while watching for breakaways so you can skate to the backcheck. Defense is really fun to play, you'll probably love it.  also, PRACTICE SKATING BACKWARDS!"

hockeyplayers,35nrmt,stevetehpirate,1 point,Tue May 12 19:34:51 2015 UTC,"I think it's part of the process. When you push your limits trying to stop, turn, shoot, or even just skate, you tend fall down, you can learn from that process (plus you learn how to get back up). A lot of people will dwell in their comfort zone so they don't fall, and it stops them from getting better.  Sounds like you're unhindered by this, so rock on. Took me awhile, and I'm still worried about pushing myself at open skate. I don't want to injure someone else and I make people nervous.  Most of the people there (ice dancers, figure skaters, small children, other non-hockey people) don't get that: I'm good with falling, it doesn't hurt (most times), and it's part of my learning process."

It was an older stick so it was slightly heavier than some of the modern sticks out there but that pole is so durable. I still play with it when I go out with friends. I think I bought it for like $100 bucks or something and I've been using it for 10 years. Everyone became really obsessed with buying lighter, cheaper metals but those sticks would break in a matter of months or on one nasty check from an opponent.

hockeyplayers,35lrwz,CanadianBobert,2,Mon May 11 18:51:06 2015 UTC,The palms are just like the old Mission Fuel 130s.

hockeyplayers,35lrwz,smackbone,2,Mon May 11 17:28:26 2015 UTC,"I'm kind of interested in the skates because they market it as having very good ankle protection, and having just broken my fibula/ankle via a hard roll, I'm kind of in the market for a stronger skate.   So I'm interested in finding out just how rigid the ankle area is, you said the skates are light, but how is the rigidness/likeliness of buckling (which my Reeboks did)."
hockeyplayers,35lrwz,cheddarbob619,2,Mon May 11 19:23:55 2015 UTC,So which giant sport gear company is gonna gobble these guys up in about a year? Can I have a pair of skates 50% off if I guess right? :)  I love the goofy plaid they use on the inside of the gloves and skates.
hockeyplayers,35lrwz,xzzy,2,Mon May 11 20:37:04 2015 UTC,Very interesting....Hopefully they can stay in business. Just done a bit of overhaul on my gear but once my stuff starts wearing out I'll definitely give them a look. Love supporting smaller companies.

hockeyplayers,35ni0s,1966mopar,3,Mon May 11 23:17:28 2015 UTC,"You say you're worried about (among other things) skating technique. I'd suggest hitting a few public skating sessions. Go out there in full gear, and practice the stuff your coach is showing you. Get confident at slow speed, then try doing it faster. I took lessons when I was starting, and for the six months before my first game, I found dodging the children's birthday parties, and the oblivious little 8 year old hotdog bastards, to be all the excitement I could stand.  Above all, be patient with yourself. There's a lot to learn, especially if you didn't grow up skating. Make sure to remember the progress you make, because it happens in bits and pieces."
hockeyplayers,35ni0s,pavlovs_monkey,4,Mon May 11 23:42:03 2015 UTC,"Totally depends on your skill level and the skill level of the guys at pickup. If you can't get enough time and space to work on specific skills, then it's not really doing much good. But then again, I find it's much more valuable to work on skills on ice rather than off ice, but that could just be me."
hockeyplayers,35ni0s,GoodOleCanadianBoy,3,Mon May 11 23:46:28 2015 UTC,Stick & Puck. Best place to practice... and what it's for. Just have a plan before you go. What are you going to work on. Recreate the drills you did in class. Try and do em faster. Bring a friend or ask someone to pass to you...etc. In pick-ups...try ONE thing each shift. (practice quick turns/crossovers/backwards...etc.) something that won't really slow you down or hurt your team as much. Just time.
hockeyplayers,35ni0s,teachzim,1 point,Tue May 12 01:34:09 2015 UTC,I would. Whats the point of playing if youre not enjoying it. Is there a puck play in your rink? Id recommend that also to work on stuff. Its hard to work on that stuff during a game because you dont want to mess up and cause your team to lose.   Ive noticed its hard to work on things in pick up because a lot of douchebags go there to show how good they are and how bad you are.
hockeyplayers,35ni0s,WhiskyTango3,1 point,Tue May 12 01:06:45 2015 UTC,"If you're asking 'what type of ice time makes me better?'  My answer is, all of it."
hockeyplayers,35ni0s,0Psmom,1 point,Tue May 12 01:56:37 2015 UTC,"This is my dilemma. I joined a league through the Internet that is called low level hockey. For people that are new to hockey or with skills that are ok.3\4 of the guys out there I would say can from competitive hockey, they're very good. I walked in the dressing room yesterday and there was a guy waxing his stick. I said to myself, why does anyone need to wax their stick at a low level game. It's pretty frustrating that these guys come to a low level game and literally push the weaker guys out because I've noticed attendance is getting weaker and some of the beginners don't come anymore. I know there's always going to be someone better than me on the ice and it's good to learn from those guys but this is ridiculous. So my question is would I be better off skipping a game and just do drills instead, I should add the drill time would be on rollerblades instead of ice as there is no stick and puck time around here."
hockeyplayers,35ni0s,nudave2005,1 point,Tue May 12 10:14:23 2015 UTC,"I'd stick to the games. As long as the more experienced players aren't skating circles around you and can hold your own with the other non experienced, there's always something to learn.  It'll just take time.    Don't get frustrated. Have fun and learn at the same time."
hockeyplayers,35ni0s,EinsamWulf,1 point,Thu May 14 17:43:55 2015 UTC,"Definitely try and add in a stick and puck (or whatever its called at your local rink). In addition something that has started to help me at pickup is forcing myself to play outside my comfort zone, pick something you don't/won't normally do and do it. Call for a pass and try a one timer, crash the net, battle in boards, get the puck and drive it like you stole it etc.  Most of the things I listed are things I watch more experienced players do but newbies like myself tend to hold back but I've found when I force myself into those situations I tend to feel like I'm contributing a little bit more every time I'm on the ice."
hockeyplayers,35ni0s,lostincbus,1 point,Tue May 12 16:24:38 2015 UTC,"I find it's closer to a math equation. In a game scenario, you're dividing the time between players as far as puck time, and then you're also dividing by the amount of shifts. So in a normal game with one sub each, you'd be at 60/5/2 for an hour game. If it's even (which it usually isn't) you're at 6 minutes of puck time max.  Switch up to practice time but try to do it at speed. Don't stand and stick handle, stand and shoot, etc... Skate and move and do all of those things."
hockeyplayers,35m49y,Bmill03,5,Mon May 11 17:06:14 2015 UTC,"I have had three repairs of my labrum. Two in 2003 when I was 18 then one in 2013. My shoulder gave out on me after abusing it playing baseball and hockey. I was told it never really healed correctly and it tore open again. I originally dislocated it in HS wrestling.  It took me a few years to be able to throw a ball at all again. This is one reason I picked up hockey. It kept my arm low which was much easier for me. Above the head things are difficult - especially throwing a ball.  To get to your question, it will probably be about 6 moths. Just, for the love of god, do your therapy. You are a hockey player so I trust you can handle some pain. It really isn't fun at first, but you HAVE to do everything they ask. Down to the stupid shit where you lean over and just dangle your arm and swing it in circles. It starts to feel really lame, but you need to keep it moving. It will grow scar tissue very quickly and lose mobility. It WILL hurt like a bitch when they stretch you out and all that, but bite the bullet and let them do their job. I babied mine after the first one and my shoulder froze up and required another surgery.  Now for the not so doom and gloom. It will get better and you will be strong again. I blew mine out again in baseball so I think you will be alright except if you fall on an outstretched hand again. Today I am playing ball well, with pain, but I can do it. I can do pushups and pullups just fine and play hockey. Just have a little nervousness of hurting it again.  If you or /u/DoctorChaos have any questions, please fire away. I have had a SLAP tear, a Bankart lesion, then 10 years later a full 360 degree labrum repair along with a Biceps Tenodesis to get the bicep load off of the labrum to help keep it from tearing again.  TL;DR: I'd guess 6 months. I have had a lot of work done on my shoulder. Anyone who is in this situation, AMA."
hockeyplayers,35m49y,Zurmakin,2,Mon May 11 17:42:44 2015 UTC,Hey I appreciate it. If I think of anything I'll def ask. Great info though and thanks!
hockeyplayers,35m49y,Zurmakin,3,Mon May 11 18:06:18 2015 UTC,"No problem. If my experiences can help someone else, I really hope I can lend that help.  I will say this, though. Get one of these: http://www.breg.com/products/cold-therapy/devices/kodiak-cold-therapy  My third surgery they suggested getting one. I swear if I could have sex with an inanimate object this would be it. Instead of trying to wrap ice packs on your shoulder, you use Velcro straps to wrap the cuff around your shoulder. Then you fill the ice chest with water and ice and it pumps water through it that just keeps cycling around like the way a radiator would work. It is the most amazing help for pain and recovery. More sleep was had with this thing. I would get the relief I needed without getting all soaked from ice packs and stuff. Plus it lasts a whole lot longer with better chilling effect. Couple it with a plug in timer and you can easily fall asleep and have it turn itself off. Your doc may suggest at some points to not keep ice on it longer than an hour or two, so I would try to sleep (which is hard enough sitting up) with that on to relieve the pain and have the timer set to turn off in an hour. Thus I would fall asleep with the cooling and it would just turn off all on its own. Then if I woke up 3 hours later in pain, I could set it for another hour. Rinse repeat. You'll use a lot of ice, though. So if you can have someone bring you bags of ice from 7-11, that is a good thing too.  It is an expensive little bastard of an ice chest but I can't express how helpful it is in recovery and even through therapy and even getting back to playing sports.  That brings me to something else. In you can borrow a recliner or have one, that is best for the first couple weeks. Laying down was really hard for me.  Ninja edit: Also you can use that timer to have it even turn on for an hour while you are sleeping so you can get extra ice on/off cycles."

If you go to your general practitioner, chances are they will send you to a specialist.  In my case they sent me to the local University's Sports Medicine dept.  Probably smart to start with your general practitioner if you have one.  Or maybe call and ask if they could give you a referral without an appointment.  In the end you will probably need Xrays and maybe an MRI for them to figure it out"
hockeyplayers,35m49y,Ichibani,1 point,Wed May 13 03:03:50 2015 UTC,"For me it was kind of gradual pain after going down on it funny and then the finally when down hard on it and could feel it dislocate, but the final straw was several times when putting on like a tshirt it completely had that separating or coming out of the socket feeling. So went and got an MRI and basically 50% of it from 12-6 is torn. I would say get it checked sooner than later if you can."

hockeyplayers,35oesv,TheGhostOfSagan,1 point,Tue May 12 14:13:45 2015 UTC,"Supposedly when you do this, it eventually can cause the skates to bend or something.  I still do it, instructor for my adult hockey class does it, I see some people do it in the locker room, etc.  Granted, my instructor and I don't do it to reduce the give at the top of our skates as you mentioned."
hockeyplayers,35oesv,KiR3,1 point,Tue May 12 05:24:15 2015 UTC,"It's not very good for your skate and looks kinda bad, try using waxed laces if you don't already and/or skate tightners"
hockeyplayers,35oesv,PAJAMASAM17,1 point,Tue May 12 08:09:23 2015 UTC,Its not good to do because not only can it ruin your skates (breaking off the tendon guard) but it can hinder your skating ability. You ankle needs the mobility
hockeyplayers,35oesv,kingofthediamond,1 point,Tue May 12 12:25:05 2015 UTC,Tying laces around the back can irritate the tendon on the back of your foot causing injury and will reduce your ability to make the skate blade properly contact the ice during turns (according to hockey canada) so is not recommended. It also will wear out your skates faster.
hockeyplayers,35oesv,somewhat_random,1 point,Tue May 12 14:15:46 2015 UTC,Something that I did when I had poorer fitting skates was use clear tape instead of wrapping laces. It wouldn't break down the boot as much and still allowed some flexibility while keeping lateral tightness.
hockeyplayers,35oesv,lostincbus,1 point,Tue May 12 22:07:15 2015 UTC,Piggybacking here-  Does anyone use the heel-lock when tying their laces?
hockeyplayers,35oesv,kr580,0,Wed May 13 23:19:38 2015 UTC,I wrap my laces around the boot to get them a little more snug on my ankle. The only negative I've heard of that makes sense is having the laces break your tendon guard on the back but I skip the top eyelet so the laces don't get near the guard. It works for me anyway. Personally I like all the ankle tightness I can achieve without cutting off circulation.

hockeyplayers,35mu6z,nablock,2,Mon May 11 20:17:25 2015 UTC,"I've been skating for a few months very frequently and just got some new Supreme 170s. I was looking at the 160s, but when I put them on in the store, they were waaaaayyyyyyy to flexible for me. I tried on the 170s, and those were perfect. Now, I'm 130 lbs, so I'm thinking if they were too flexible for me, then you're right in saying they are too flexible for you. The 170s were noticeably stiffer...  I did not try out the 180s, though. Hope this helps"
hockeyplayers,35mu6z,TheGhostOfSagan,1 point,Mon May 11 21:02:20 2015 UTC,"That's good to know. I wanted the 170s originally, but the rink I skate at had only 160s and 190s I think, so I just went with what I could get there to support them."
hockeyplayers,35mu6z,NitroDevo,2,Mon May 11 21:14:44 2015 UTC,"I have/had a similar issue with the same skates.  My issue is more with ankle strength than boot stiffness.  If you're not convinced you need new skates just yet, try working on your ankles a bit before shelling out the cash for them."
hockeyplayers,35mu6z,sb22284,-2,Tue May 12 12:39:46 2015 UTC,One thing to mention is Supremes are built to run loose in the ankles for skaters that like that style. That may be a reason why you get more bend. Personally I hated it so I switched to Vapors. The vapors have almost double the padding in the ankle and tend to lock in much better. You might want to give them a shot. The x60 is a good start or if you want a little more stiffness go with the x70. They also run narrow so if you have a flat foot go with a EE. Last year's models just went on sale and you can get some killer deals.
hockeyplayers,35mu6z,Skyline_BNR34,5,Mon May 11 22:45:45 2015 UTC,"That is not at all how the Supreme line is meant to fit at all.  The Supreme line does have a bit more fit in the ankle but not a huge difference, the huge difference is in the toe and forefoot where it is wider than the Vapor as the Supreme line is supposed to be a more anatomical fit.  When I put on vapors the heel is pretty close to what my Supremes are, but the rest of the skate is too tight, just like they are designed."
hockeyplayers,35m7ga,cgibsong002,2,Mon May 11 17:29:18 2015 UTC,"So am I to take it that with too stiff a shaft, you can actually gain velocity on your slapshot (still have enough strength to flex it), but you'll lose velocity on your wristers (not enough strength to flex it)?"
hockeyplayers,35m7ga,PuckTheBruins,0,Mon May 11 20:57:55 2015 UTC,Stronger flex means stronger and more accurate slapshots but you give up wrist shot strength and accuracy.   Lower flex means a stronger and more accurate wristshot but you give up slapshot strength and accuracy.

I tend to massively overpower 85 flex because of my weight and upper body strength, and as a result my shots aren't timed well or as accurate as I'd like.  I've used as high as 110 flex sticks which felt a little too stiff for my style.  If you like the stiffness of your 85, or if you feel like a more flexible stick would be appropriate, I'd just go that route instead of fiddling with a 100 flex."
hockeyplayers,35m7ga,VOldis,1 point,Mon May 11 17:58:35 2015 UTC,"For your weight 100 is probably too much. I use 100 and I fluctuate :) between 200-210 at 6'4.  A general starting point is half your weight.    At my weight I actually find it easier to shoot with 100 than 85 but that might be the different curves I have. I've tried 110 and I need to have perfect form to get a lot on the puck with slapshots.   The one advantage a stiffer stick confers is easier stick handling, though its probably not hard to get used to a lower flex in a reasonable time."
hockeyplayers,35m7ga,elrizzy,1 point,Mon May 11 18:03:53 2015 UTC,"I am exactly your size and I use a 100 flex stick, purely because I play defence and it gives me a much better slapshot. It definitely makes my wrist shot much worse though."

I actually cut it down a couple inches, so they say each inch cut adds 10 flex, so it was probably 140ish by the time I was done hacking at it...  Needless to say, slappers were sick. They felt good and powerful. I didn't get much juice on my wristers though. With that, I still potted enough goals in beer league to where it didn't matter. It was my favorite stick until I eventually wore it down. I've stuck with lower flexes since that, but I wouldn't think twice about playing with it if I was given the same stick from back then.  I guess it depends on your playing level and how skilled you are. For me - I could do everything I needed as a forward, my stick was just rock hard and light as a feather."
hockeyplayers,35m7ga,UpDawg2190,1 point,Mon May 11 20:54:13 2015 UTC,"The flex you use should on how you shoot. Weight matters a little bit, but not as much as you think. Obviously a 140lb guy isn't gonna want a 110 flex. If you really lean into your wristers and take a lot of slappers, you will probably want a higher flex (90+). I'm 6' 220lbs and I will buy pro stock sticks between 90-100 flex typically."
hockeyplayers,35m7ga,Nirvana-L,1 point,Mon May 11 21:21:38 2015 UTC,"I'm 6'4"" about 260 pounds and I use 110 flex. If I could get stiffer I would.  I find it really powers my slappers and helps with receiving passes.  Best advice is try one if you can and see how it goes"
hockeyplayers,35m7ga,Skyline_BNR34,1 point,Mon May 11 21:50:48 2015 UTC,"You just need to try it out. I used a 102 for awhile until it broke and learned how to use the stick with both slappers and wristshots.  Weight is important, but at 160 you can still lean into a stick, technique is more important while shooting."
hockeyplayers,35m7ga,thespank,1 point,Mon May 11 22:55:11 2015 UTC,Im about 6' even about 170 and right now  using a totalone nxg thats about 90 (87 cut down an inch or two) i find for guys our size this is a good mix of slapshot power without sacrificing the wrister. I used to use a 75 which gave me immaculate wristers but my slapdhot suffered. Anything more than about 95 sees a huge drop in them as well. Of course a lot of it is preference but thays what ive found.
hockeyplayers,35m7ga,kingofthediamond,0,Tue May 12 17:05:44 2015 UTC,It can actually bad to use a stick that is too stiff. Sticks are meant to bend a certain amount. When you use a stick that is too stiff. the stick will not bend correctly and you are at greater risk of snapping
hockeyplayers,35m7ga,F0rdo,1 point,Mon May 11 18:50:09 2015 UTC,"So if my stick is too stiff to bend, there might be a chance of me breaking it because I can't bend it?"
hockeyplayers,35m7ga,Skyline_BNR34,2,Mon May 11 22:46:46 2015 UTC,"No, you're just not going to get enough power behind your shot. if you can't flex the stick.  Starting out, most people really should use a whippy stick so they can learn techniques and once it feels like a wet noodle move up in flex.  If you can;t properly flex a stick, it is too stiff for you."
hockeyplayers,35m7ga,kingofthediamond,1 point,Mon May 11 22:52:03 2015 UTC,Amen to this.
hockeyplayers,35m7ga,kingofthediamond,-1,Tue May 12 00:49:11 2015 UTC,"Well no, but think of it this way. if its supposed to bend it wont mind bending. If its stiff it wont bend it may just break in half."
hockeyplayers,35m7ga,F0rdo,1 point,Tue May 12 00:49:42 2015 UTC,The flex rating on a stick is the amount of pounds of force it takes the bend the hockey stick one inch. Stiffer sticks just take way more to bend. Most hockey sticks when broke are more of a safety precaution to protect the player.
hockeyplayers,35m7ga,kingofthediamond,1 point,Tue May 12 03:57:57 2015 UTC,"I may not fully realize the advantages/disadvantages of an overly stiff stick, but I know this is just plain wrong, lol."

hockeyplayers,35m7ga,kingofthediamond,2,Tue May 12 13:38:01 2015 UTC,The stick is a spring. The fracture toughness of the material is not a function of the spring rate.
hockeyplayers,35m7ga,kingofthediamond,1 point,Wed May 13 00:16:23 2015 UTC,Thats correct. However an improper use of a spring will cause catastrophic failure
hockeyplayers,35m7ga,vkapustin_,1 point,Wed May 13 02:34:55 2015 UTC,"Improper knowledge will cause you to sound like you have no idea what you're talking about. Explain how in any way improper use of a stick too stiff can result in breakage? If it is too stiff, you will simply not be able to flex it.   Go grab a pair of car springs and try to flex them. They won't budge. They also won't explode in your hands."

hockeyplayers,35ldob,sumofparticles,2,Mon May 11 14:58:45 2015 UTC,"I had the exact same thing happen to my mission proto inline skates. My boot was still in great condition and I loved skating in then. I JB welded the tongue back to the cap, but over time the cap kept rotting and I kept having to re epoxy it back together. After fixing each boot three times I gave up on the skates. I wouldn't dare take an ice puck off of the toes in your skates, you don't know how much your cap has rotted."
hockeyplayers,35ldob,Bengerm77,2,Mon May 11 15:33:53 2015 UTC,"Even if they were, I wouldn't use them.  That's a broken foot or a deep cut waiting to happen."
hockeyplayers,35ldob,TheKyleBaxter,2,Mon May 11 15:46:23 2015 UTC,"You need new skates.   However, you can use them until you can get new skates..   On my Missions Flyweights (very old, very used, beat up, worn out, and awesome), both the right and left tongues broke off like yours. I just slide/place the tongues back into the skate before putting them and then tighten laces as normal. I am too cheap and lazy for new skates."
hockeyplayers,35ldob,MLG3199,2,Mon May 11 20:53:33 2015 UTC,"They are fixable, but it wouldn't be worth it honestly.  Everyone saying they are toast apparently doesn't know a good hockey shop. Because toe caps can be replaced and so can tongues."

hockeyplayers,35ldob,Zednix,1 point,Tue May 12 02:28:53 2015 UTC,"These are some old skates I had sitting unused for probably 10 years or so. I ended up skating on them for the first time in a long time and the plastic toe cap, which has become very brittle and discolored started cracking and the tongue ended up breaking from the boot. Are these in any way salvageable?   I have a feeling they aren't, but I figured I'd ask. They are so old they aren't worth anything--if there's a way to fix them relatively inexpensively I might try to give them another shot. Everything is still in pretty good condition aside from the toe cap."

hockeyplayers,35nfay,KiR3,2,Tue May 12 00:39:40 2015 UTC,"Sizing charts could be misleading as people are shaped differently and each brand has different fittings. Certain things you can get away with by doing that, but with something important like this, it's risky unless you are 100% sure."

If it is someone I know, I will talk all game because it usually ends up being a 2 way street - as in I get back as much as I give. If it isn't someone I know, I will say something in regards to their play if they did something bad or good worth mentioning.  If you don't know someone, chirping is fine in my opinion as long as it isn't disrespectful. The moment you cross that line, you are asking for some form of retaliation (good rub on the boards, little slash to the shin, etc)."

I normally just chrip when some one deserves it. Try to stick handle around the entire team only to get yourself put off side that's deserving of a chirping.

hockeyplayers,35kqtf,Atraid3s,1 point,Mon May 11 08:55:13 2015 UTC,Realistically if they are experienced players they won't rattle based on your chirps but if you find people who are quick to temper you can draw them into penalties.  I'm a bigger guy so I lean on people to try and draw hooks or trips.  Other than that you can just stick check like crazy to frustrate them

hockeyplayers,35kk8z,Drdingidforester,3,Mon May 11 06:31:50 2015 UTC,"I know a guy who built a barn and puts a rink inside it every winter. I'm going to do a running series about him next year on my channel.   As for your options (which I've also considered) I'd recommend finding a property with a big ass garage or barn, you can build a tennis court, rink, squash courts, storage, etc with a really big structure. either that or just get cheap land and throw up one of those giant tarp barn things which provide a lot of cover, but aren't really really expensive.   Personally I have a 24 x 16 ft synthetic ice rink in my garage. It's a lot of fun, but only for personal use and only really for training, not exactly for playing."
hockeyplayers,35kk8z,howtohockeydotcom,2,Mon May 11 16:30:12 2015 UTC,"I found a place that sells synthetic ice and I'm just trying to get a feel for price to surface size   Thier panels are 45 x 93 inches and are $250 a piece, how much did yours cost?  when you stop of the stuff does it shave it? or how does that work?"
hockeyplayers,35kk8z,scotttech1,3,Mon May 11 17:50:12 2015 UTC,"Synthetic feels like slow ice, you'll notice it the most when starting and stopping, you'll feel that extra friction that might make you stumble a little. I got mine for free from HockeyShot as it was their demo stuff and they needed to get rid of it. For Synthetic ice you basically have to sharpen your skates after every skate though, so that can be annoying."

Anyways, those big tarp barns are exactly what I was looking for (just didnt know the name).  I checked around and the prices arent that crazy.  To pretty much build a space big enough for a full tennis court/ bball court/ mini rink it would be around 20,000 - which is 20,000 for a custom domed place to play sports - not all that crazy.  I cant wait to see your series about him.  Really excited to do this over the next few years."
hockeyplayers,35kk8z,howtohockeydotcom,2,Sat May 16 23:37:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's a pretty sweet deal. $20 000 for your own rec centre! I want to build one and put squash courts in it."
hockeyplayers,35kk8z,WhiskyTango3,2,Sun May 17 04:43:36 2015 UTC,"If you did build a really small rink, I think youd be really disappointed. Sure, you could practice some things, but you couldnt really get a good game going on it. Also, its going to be expensive as fuck to build a rink like that. If youre not building it to spec, youre going to have custom parts made for it, which is going to cost a lot more.   It would be really cool and Id love to do the same thing, but in reality, I dont think its possible, unless you hit the lottery soon."
hockeyplayers,35kk8z,WhiskyTango3,1 point,Mon May 11 07:28:43 2015 UTC,"Dammit I thought I wrote back last night but I guess it didn't go through.  Anyways right now I play on one half of a tennis court area - so about 40x50 feet - which is definitely more than enough for solo practice, and we play 2v2 and 3v3 games on roller blades and have a lot of fun.    If I had that space in my own yard it would be worth it, so really what i am looking for is a 40x50 driveway to play hockey on - nothing that crazy (especially sine asphalt prices aren't that high), and for me I definitely dont think it would be disappointing.    What do you mean by custom parts?  Im really only looking at a surface to play on, no board or anything like that (at least for now)."

That enclosed arena could easily contain a rink and a couple locker rooms.  I imagine the cost in NE would be prohibitive but it's the exact solution to option #2 so it's worth a look.  When I lived in CT there were a ton of horse farms around, there's probably some options in your area."

I was at my defensive blue line just hoping for a pass to try and get a goal. The other team player didn't see me and was sending it back to center ice to try and secure the win. I race out to center ice to get the puck for a breakaway. Their d man did see me so he tried to stop me and got to me near the top of the right face off circle where I put the brakes on and started to cut to the net. The goalie was sprawling and I just got my stick around him to score the goal.     I got the goal with like 2 seconds left to tie the game and Force OT. I literally looked at the clock as I was crossing center ice to see how much time was left also because I knew it was getting close.   It was awesome. Felt like scoring the game tying goal in the Stanley Cup Finals. We lost in OT, but it was still very clutch."

I've never practiced that move or anything but was shooting the shit with the scorekeeper that I know. We were joking about me trying it since we were up by 3. I was like nah I'm not gonna do it because it's a douche move with a lead like that and only minutes left in the game.   Despite playing defense I somehow got a bit of a breakaway, so I was just gonna shoot from a far angle and if it goes in, I can't really feel bad about it. One of their defensemen gets to me and is distracting me so much that when I look up the goalie is about 3 feet out of the blue coming towards me. He makes a super aggressive move and I jump so as to not hit him. End up colliding with the boards pretty hard.   At this point I say fuck it. I'm going to try and embarrass this guy. Played a little more offensively and got a stretch passed, deked an attacking defender and forsberg'd the goalie. He punched me in the cup as I went by him. Totally worth it. Then one of their forwards called me an ""all star"". I like to pretend it wasn't sarcastic."

It was basically 5v4 any time he was on the ice and it was frustrating and not fun to say the least. He refused to learn or even put in basic effort(2 hands on your stick) at times. I was +8 during the season when I was on the ice with him. I scored a hat-trick twice in consecutive games after x-mas and a few goals with the help of my d-men backing me at the points.

I guess everyone started to get tired because I decided to pull a Bobby Orr and did an end to end rush with a diiirrrrrrrrrrrty toe drag on the last defender and a Datsyuk on the goalie. I loved hearing the oooohhhhss and aaaahhhhhhhs when I was on that rush. I don't think I even celebrated. I just sat back on the bench and gave my buddy a small fist bump.

Finally after a mad scramble I ended up on my belly and instead of keeping his cool the guy on the other team picked up the puck and threw it in! I was so mad I almost took the kid down but his own coach came out and benched him. We ended up winning 2-0. After the game my coach handed me a Zero Club patch which I used to keep in my gear as a good luck charm and still have to this day.

My buddy is a goaltender so when games ended at he let me and another friend shoot-out on him. I was really obvious when shooting or moving the puck. I mean this is my first time playing others. I was staring down when moving the puck, and I would stare at my target spot. And I realized it cause he would just watch my eyes. It reminded me of watching all these great shootout moves and my personal favorite is Zuccarelo's move against Calgary. So I skated in and I knew he would watch my face. I stared top glove side but knew I couldn't lift the puck high enough, nor fast enough to beat him. Being a lefty everybody says low blocker is the best to target. I got in really close and fired low blocker while staring at glove. He went for the windmill completely expecting it. He'd stopped 10 straight from only watching my eyes. And I skated off with my first goal ever. I swiped the ice and celly'd my ass off. Sheathed my stick, Swiped the ice, pumped my fists yelling in an almost empty ice rink. Fucking elated. I still am giddy about it.   Z's goal Vid I ""hardly mimic'd"": http://youtu.be/uMJnY2y2cwM"

For example Sidney Crosby uses a sherwood but its painted to look like a Reebok because he has a reebok sponcership. Players get completely customized sticks so they can get whatever they want. There is really no way to know what youre getting. But thats part of the fun!   2) Depends on the player but generally they are normal sized  3) I have owned 5 pro stocks and loved every single one.

hockeyplayers,35kagy,SilasX93,1 point,Mon May 11 04:27:12 2015 UTC,"Whenever your team has the puck in the defensive zone (usually Dmen, could be center), get your ASS on the right board. It'll make you an outlet to breakout and get the puck out of the zone. In the offensive zone, always go to open areas (below top of the circles unless one of your defenseman is pinching in, which in that case cover his spot till he returns) and always be ready to catch a pass. When you have the puck, always use the room you have to skate with it, and dump it in the offensive zone when you have no room (be careful not to ice it though). Good luck!"
hockeyplayers,35kagy,itanitarek10,1 point,Mon May 11 05:04:16 2015 UTC,"This, all the way. This is advice to listen to.  To add, if, in the offensive zone, the puck is on the other wing, put your ass in front of the net. Catch a rebound or dig the puck past the goalie.  This is especially great for the slower guys (like me) who are generally going to be the last man back into my defensive zone."
hockeyplayers,35kagy,tehReno,1 point,Mon May 11 23:33:49 2015 UTC,"Stay onside. I would rather have a guy come into the zone a step late and slow than be way offside and get the played stopped. Look at the ref, if his hand is up then get behind the blue line and wait for him to put his hand down. There is a guy I play with in a D-league he goes offsides 4-5 times a game and it is the worst."
hockeyplayers,35kagy,Hurricane_Viking,1 point,Mon May 11 16:28:56 2015 UTC,"Winger is a good place to start as the consequences aren't as severe if you fuck up in your own zone as a winger and it doesn't requiring as much skating agility as defense.  Play defense, don't cherry pick.  If the puck is down low, don't stay attached to the d-men up at the blue line, take away their passing lanes.  If you're the weak side winger, cover the high slot.  On the strong side, stay around the half wall to support if the play comes up and be available for a short break out pass if your d-man gains possession.  And if/when you do get that breakout pass don't immediately try to make a cross-ice pass in your own zone and risk getting picked off in a juicy scoring area in the middle.  In the offensive zone, look for the open ice and get there.  I think positioning for forwards is less cut and dry there as you are all moving around trying to create plays.  Establish and maintain that triangle."

Aside the fact that it's got a slim profile I think the best thing is I can actually talk with it in and sound relatively normal.
hockeyplayers,35jfw0,mochitomi,1 point,Mon May 11 02:18:46 2015 UTC,"i know a few people have said that you shouldnt need a mouthguard because it is non contact but it basically goes along the idea of wearing a cage or a visor. If you wear a visor you are risking your face but that is your risk, where a cage basically ensures safety... but there is still a small risk, very small. You shouldnt need a mouth guard but having played in a non contact league i have had a few situations where i was hit in the head or fell and banged my head. It doesnt happen alot but i have had concussions before and it is not worth the risk to me. The mouthguard does obscure breathing a tiny bit but it isnt that bad. To me my health is worth the ""cons"" of wearing a mouthguard. It is your decision and a cheap one will provide you basic protection. I have a shock doctor and it works fine."
hockeyplayers,35jfw0,Leftwithnocookies,5,Mon May 11 02:19:17 2015 UTC,"Just an FYI, there's no evidence that mouthguards prevent concussions. They do prevent dental injuries, which you can still receive in a cage, so there's certainly some benefit to wearing one."

I bought two because I wasn't sure how long they would last but so far its pretty good.   I took one solid knock to my jaw this winter season and I didn't get that awful teeth on teeth knock that I have had in the past. My jaw also didn't get cranked out of line and sore on one side.

hockeyplayers,35jfw0,1979_Honda_Accord,-2,Thu May 14 06:39:57 2015 UTC,Not sure why you're worrying about a month guard. Been playing no contact beer league for a couple years and have seen exactly 0 people use a mouth guard.
hockeyplayers,35jfw0,redwing634,2,Sun May 10 23:32:01 2015 UTC,"Maybe its just carryover from my rugby days where a mouthguard was the only protection, so its burned into my head that its the most important piece of gear."
hockeyplayers,35jfw0,bspec,1 point,Sun May 10 23:46:24 2015 UTC,"You should absolutely wear a mouth guard, it's not worth the risk especially if you don't wear a cage. That being said, you don't need to spend too much. I use a SISU mouth guard and it's been great. Very non intrusive, comfortable and you form the guard yourself so it fits your teeth. The company recently joined up with CCM so this isn't some third party cheap brand. Best of all their mouth guards are affordable at around $30 each. Definitely worth it in my opinion."
hockeyplayers,35jfw0,stevegcook,1 point,Sun May 10 23:58:53 2015 UTC,"Hm don't think I've seen that brand at my LHSs before, but I'll keep an eye out.  Most places ice seen just carry Shock Doctor and Under Armour-i got my Fox 40 from my brother-in-law who's an MMA fighter and brings them in, never seen them anywhere before either"
hockeyplayers,35jfw0,redwing634,1 point,Mon May 11 00:36:05 2015 UTC,"You can order them straight from the sisu website, and apparently the coupon code REDDIT will give you 10% off, according to what their rep once told me when I mentioned them before.  Many more stores will also start carrying them this fall because they're doing a partnership with CCM."
hockeyplayers,35jfw0,Leftwithnocookies,1 point,Mon May 11 06:13:59 2015 UTC,"I wanted to avoid ordering online because the American - Canadian exchange is stupid right now so adding shipping on there is aggravating.  I searched last night and couldn't find any Canadian vendors, so I was planning on buying a cheap-o for now then rebuying a SISU when I could justify $50 on a mouthguard, but I just went back to their website and the chat was online so I asked about my town and there are actually 7 or 8 vendors that carry them! So I'll be calling around and will hopefully grab one before I play again on Thursday"
hockeyplayers,35jfw0,redwing634,1 point,Mon May 11 15:25:07 2015 UTC,"In non-contact beer league, with a cage, why would you recommend a mouth guard? I understand it in contact leagues, but non.. eh..."
hockeyplayers,35jfw0,Leftwithnocookies,1 point,Mon May 11 01:02:22 2015 UTC,"i played in a non contact league and i got my head rocked a couple times both accidental and on purpose. And after having a few concussions i would never risk my safety/health because a concussion can be killer. To me it is not worth it, even if it obscures breathing a little."
hockeyplayers,35jfw0,redwing634,1 point,Mon May 11 02:13:59 2015 UTC,Mouthguards aren't really relevant to concussions. Hence why probably 99% of beer leaguers don't use them...    One of the most commonly held myths in sports medicine is the premise that wearing a mouthguard will prevent concussion  http://bjsm.bmj.com/content/35/2/81.full
hockeyplayers,35jfw0,aaronwhite1786,1 point,Mon May 11 03:10:48 2015 UTC,when i was playing in the beer league game i didnt have my mouthguard in my mouth (sometimes chew it when i am not near play or keep it out of my mouth until play comes to me then put it back in). The play moves quickly to me and i push the puck out but collide with another player. He braced for the hit and i didnt. I fell and bit down very hard because i hit the ice. I had a minor concussion for about 4 days. It was my fault but like i said before it can happen. It did not help i am probably more prone to concussions than others so that may have contributed.
hockeyplayers,35jfw0,redwing634,2,Mon May 11 03:14:52 2015 UTC,That's unfortunate but honestly you would have likely had a concussion with or without a mouth guard. Studies have shown mouth guards have no effect on concussions.
hockeyplayers,35jfw0,aaronwhite1786,1 point,Mon May 11 04:28:27 2015 UTC,"Even just wiping out, you could easily hit your head and bite down on your tongue or something like that. The ice will always be solid, and hit hard, no matter how much contact there is with other skaters."
hockeyplayers,35jfw0,redwing634,1 point,Mon May 11 02:44:14 2015 UTC,"I suppose that's possible.. but very unlikely. Like I said, I was only giving OP my personal experience; that I have personally not seen any beer leaguers use a mouthguard. It's not necessary at non-contact levels."
hockeyplayers,35jfw0,redwing634,0,Mon May 11 03:12:16 2015 UTC,"Don't they still help with concussions as well? I'll always be concerned with wiping out. If anyone around me skates as terribly as i do, it's only a matter of time before we wreck each other."

Unless you're not wearing one in bear league either? in which case I would recommend you do.  But I guess if you refuse to wear a cage/shield, then yea wear a mouth-guard (although even the guys who don't wear shields/cages in my beer league, still don't wear mouth-guards)."

hockeyplayers,35gxww,Kellysmurphy,12,Sun May 10 06:27:47 2015 UTC,"A few notes.   It seemed to track heart rate pretty well and consistently. I think the largest peak there was about the time I scored my goal, but I can't tell for sure. It has a ""steps"" tracker that it converts to miles, but I don't think that translates well for being on the ice. Either way, it's not the main reason I wore it for the game. My gloves cover my wrist well enough to protect the watch fortunately so I didn't really have to worry about that.   If anyone has any questions about the use or anything, let me know. I can also test out some things on Tuesday at my next game if needed since this was only my first use of it."

hockeyplayers,35gxww,4dotgov,6,Sun May 10 13:02:15 2015 UTC,I had my college club team do spin class interval training.  Without a doubt we were the best conditioned team in the league.
hockeyplayers,35gxww,GoodOleCanadianBoy,1 point,Sun May 10 18:58:18 2015 UTC,"Before I started playing hockey I was doing interval training just to lose weight + it was the only type of cardio that I enjoy doing.  So when I decided to play hockey for the first time (~3months ago), I noticed I was the best conditioned guy on the team.  Don't get me wrong, I'm still terrible at the sport."

hockeyplayers,35h1em,dangerfang,2,Sun May 10 23:09:18 2015 UTC,My league never loses sight of the fact that it's supposed to be fun. They follow the spirit of the rules more than the letter. The guy who runs the league is huge and intimidating which keeps everyone on their best behavior. We kick out teams who are just there to be assholes.   The rink has great ice and no one cares if you have beers in the locker room after a game.
hockeyplayers,35h1em,bspec,1 point,Sun May 10 16:41:12 2015 UTC,I've heard the legend of being able to order beers before the game and have it delivered on ice in the locker room.... Le sigh.

Also attracts a much younger crowd than the league I'm in now, which is nice, because I can actually hangout with my teammates."
hockeyplayers,35h1em,Walbeb24,3,Mon May 11 04:53:02 2015 UTC,"Parity, organization, and friendly atmosphere. For the most part the levels are what they say they are. Ice time is always set at the start of the season and doesn't change. And it's individual signup and the teams are scrambled every season so you play with everyone in the league at some point. Cuts down on the chippyness of the games."
hockeyplayers,35h1em,cgvandam,2,Sun May 10 13:41:45 2015 UTC,I would love to be in a league that scrambles everyone. I can definitely see how it could cut down on the chippyness if most guys actually know each other.
hockeyplayers,35h1em,Zednix,2,Sun May 10 22:23:26 2015 UTC,It's pretty nice. It not only increases the friendliness of the league but also improves the parity. And when your team gets smoked all season at least you know the next season will be better. The captains also get together before the season to eyeball the rosters for balance.

hockeyplayers,35f667,cgibsong002,3,Sat May 9 19:28:55 2015 UTC,"Hey, read your post, and had a ""coming of age"" slapshot moment (even though I'm an old fart beginner -  :-) I'm a big guy, 6'5"" 260, and been skating for 2 years and playing for 1.  Played primarily D, as I seem to have some natural capacity for skating backwards, and got the long arms/wingspan for a good poke check and enough power in a sweeper to break the occasional opponents stick. Downside has been that as the D-man I get the point shots, and everyone sees me windup for the slapper and the result has hitherto been nothing less than pathetic.  Yep, I hit the ice a couple of inches behind the puck, got the hand position pretty much right, but the puck dribbled forward in a really embarrassing way :-( Goalies would flinch at my first attempt, then laugh at my second as I slunk back to the blueline. -- until yesterday.  Took your advice and did weight transfer downwards rather than forwards.  Oh. My. Gosh.    Upside, 260 lbs on the stick in the right direction has become scary, and once I true up the accuracy, I've gone from pathetic to officially dangerous, the laughs have stopped, and have already been told that I ""can't do those anymore in pickup games.""  Downside, my trusty old Sher Wood PMPX 9950 woodie couldn't take the heat, and broke in the middle of the shaft.  Time to go and get a composite stick.  Any recommendations for a stick that is both long (full 63"") and strong enough to slap with?  TL:DR:  Took the advice here and discovered my boomer.  Broke my favourite stick, and need a new one."

hockeyplayers,35f667,ciabattabing16,4,Fri May 15 12:46:14 2015 UTC,"Yes, hit the ice right in front of the puck, not the puck. Your stick should slam off the ice and into the puck, giving your shot much more explosive power. Hitting the ice first is lost on a large number of players, unsure why. That's why those sticks bend in all the photos."
hockeyplayers,35f667,rafuzo2,3,Sat May 9 20:55:37 2015 UTC,"I always knew to hit behind the puck. But I didn't know how much downward force should really get applied. I thought it was just friction plus swing speed that did all the bending. How I was doing it, even if I hit 5 inches behind the puck there was no loading going on because I was just skimming the surface. Once I started really pounding INTO the ground by dipping my leading shoulder, all of a sudden my shots looked just like all the other guys whom I was thinking ""How the hell do they make that look so easy?""   I'm a golfer so I kept trying to swing through the puck cleanly, so this was very different for me and a bit of a revelation. By the way, I may be a beginner, but I've played recreationally most of my life and never had this click until now."
hockeyplayers,35f667,Whatsalodi,1 point,Sat May 9 22:01:55 2015 UTC,"The thing that did it for me was getting the sense of falling onto my stick. The problem I had was that I would transfer my weight from one foot to another without considering the stick. So I wouldn't load the stick at all and the shot would be weak. I knew I had to transfer that power somehow, but at one point it clicked that I needed to feel as if, if the stick wasn't hitting the ice at that exact right moment, I'd fall flat on my face to the ice."

Two players committed to Quinnipiac directly from this team and one was taken in the USHL draft this year. There are more, those are just the couple I can name. Tier 3 Jr. is good as well, just make sure to do your research and figure out what each team has to offer."
hockeyplayers,35fde7,Bluearmy69,1 point,Sun May 10 07:20:00 2015 UTC,"I dont want to be a dick but if your brother really is good enough to play D1 hockey he should know how to get there. Everyone on my AAA team knew exactly what path they would need to take to play D1 hockey. AAA>USHL/NAHL>College. Without knowing what team he plays on its hard to judge weather or not hes good enough to play in the USHL/NAHL (which by the way are the only junior leagues in the US which are free). The majority of AAA teams in the US do not send players to good junior leagues, and are pay to play."

hockeyplayers,35faqq,Bluuuurr,2,Sat May 9 20:10:27 2015 UTC,put some hockey tape around the part that slips into the shaft. just keep adding until snug. then add glue and shove it up in there.
hockeyplayers,35faqq,thecanadianswede,2,Sat May 9 21:34:11 2015 UTC,Did you add it to the bottom of the broken stick? or the top? If it was the bottom it may not fit exactly right. I agree with u/thecanadianswede you can add a strip of tape around it.   Make sure you heat up both the shaft and the blade before you connect them. Glue both the blade with plenty of extra glue. You can get a heat gun and glue at home depot for around $20
hockeyplayers,35faqq,kingofthediamond,1 point,Sat May 9 22:36:12 2015 UTC,I added it to the top.  I tried the bottum first but the shaft was no where near big enough.  I'll try the tape trick.  I suppose I'll have to get more glue now too
hockeyplayers,35faqq,kingofthediamond,2,Sat May 9 22:44:20 2015 UTC,Your LHS or an art store may have a thicker glue stick. The smaller ones melt really fast. make sure you go heavy on the glue. Once its done dunk it in a bucket or water or cold water in the sink. Then cut off the excess that oozes out

It's a 30 minute practice for hockey players that focuses on stretching out the hip flexors and lower back while still strengthening the lower body. It's more challenging than a beginner class but even if you've never done yoga before you shouldn't let that intimidate you!   Enjoy and let me know if you have any questions/feedback :)"

hockeyplayers,35c9xp,proudcanucklehead,3,Fri May 8 22:46:10 2015 UTC,"I can think of 2 ways.   Find your compete factor again.  Get in the mindset of not wanting to lose a battle under any circumstance. Accept pain is part of the game.  If you break your ankle again, then you do.  So what?  There is a guarentee you will get injured at some point.  You cant control how so just play and if it happens, it happens.  As a big stay at home dman, you are the least likely player on the ice to get hurt so you have that going for ya."
hockeyplayers,35c9xp,plumpilicious,1 point,Fri May 8 23:01:52 2015 UTC,I guess I ws lucky. I played hockey for 4 yrs now and haven't been injured so this was really the first time. But thanks for the advice! I'll take it to heart this summer
hockeyplayers,35c9xp,brttpckr,3,Sat May 9 16:15:21 2015 UTC,im a newer skater and i hurt myself pretty bad. feel and busted my chin on the ice. i had fat hanging out and had to get a few stitches. this is all 100 percent mental. it will take a little bit to get over this curve. your best bet is just to ease back into. once you get into your first battle youll start to forget about things. but until then just keep playing.
hockeyplayers,35c9xp,PizzaHockeyGolf,1 point,Fri May 8 23:40:15 2015 UTC,It didn't help either that I came back right at playoffs haha but thanks! I'll go to drop ins this summer and work through it.
hockeyplayers,35c9xp,HowitzerIII,5,Sat May 9 16:14:02 2015 UTC,It's a mindset thing. You have to know your ankle is stronger than before. Trying doing exercises that involve impact or landing on that ankle. If you know you can do that your playing style should change.   I tore my labrum in high school. Took a couple months to get back. First game back I was nervous until I got hit and my shoulder stayed in place. Maybe you just need a board battle to get you out of this funk.
hockeyplayers,35c9xp,PaddleBoatEnthusiast,1 point,Sat May 9 01:19:46 2015 UTC,"Thanks!  The funny thing is that it still doesn't feel ""stronger"" but I'll definitely  keep that in mind"
hockeyplayers,35c9xp,Knobdy1,3,Sat May 9 16:13:00 2015 UTC,"I would try to have some patience with the previously injured ankle. First, it needs to build muscle and flexibility back. Second, your body must ""learn"" to trust the ankle again, and ignoring your fears is a risky way to teach your body. The internal risk evaluation is a way for your body to know what it's limits are. I would try to push the ankle little by little, but not too much at a time. You want to extend the range of the ankle without going too far and suffering another injury.   Above all, keep at it. You'll get back to where you were."
hockeyplayers,35c9xp,mavLP,1 point,Sat May 9 03:09:32 2015 UTC,Thank for the tip! It's still hard to completely trust the ankle because I still feel an uncomfortable  pinch when I skate on it. But I'll keep at it especially with the ankle exercises rehab taught me
hockeyplayers,35d5np,kman418,4,Sat May 9 04:09:03 2015 UTC,I would REALLY recommend wearing socks. Try a thinker pair like Nike elite socks. They're expensive but worth the cost.
hockeyplayers,35d5np,TheSneakyBaldGuy,0,Sat May 9 04:35:27 2015 UTC,I can get those. But looking at other posts I have laced my boots over the eyelid and was wonding if that might have something do with it. It anyone with top end skates can chim in would help. Just want to make sure it's not Because they are my first boot that's actually stiff enough
hockeyplayers,35d5np,Axelstall,2,Sat May 9 05:02:29 2015 UTC,"If you're still skeptical about socks I recommend Darn Tough wool ones, I use them mainly for hiking and Ice Climbing (The boots used there are a lot like hockey skates fit wise) and the socks stand up for almost forever. The thinner running focused socks would work good if you don't like the feeling of socks being on."
hockeyplayers,35d5np,TheSneakyBaldGuy,1 point,Sat May 9 05:28:25 2015 UTC,Have you baked your skates?

hockeyplayers,35d5np,stevegcook,0,Sat May 9 14:39:57 2015 UTC,They could be too stiff. I don't know enough to advise you any certain way but if your boots are cutting your ankles I can't imagine a good fix outside of slightly softer skates.
hockeyplayers,35d5np,Zombiz,2,Sat May 9 05:40:14 2015 UTC,"I somewhat wonder if they're simply not a good fit for you.  I have MX3s as well and have never experienced that.  The heel/ankle of the Supreme line is quite narrow, so maybe you'd be better off in a wider skate?"
hockeyplayers,35d5np,stevegcook,1 point,Sat May 9 05:52:45 2015 UTC,"The feel great, it seems like weat the liner is connected to the boot is sharp almost, I'm like 95% sure that is what's causing it, hence why I taped it"
hockeyplayers,35bfim,cgibsong002,14,Fri May 8 18:31:41 2015 UTC,Just use a hacksaw.
hockeyplayers,35bfim,EvilGopher,1 point,Fri May 8 18:36:10 2015 UTC,Yep.
hockeyplayers,35bfim,mrpopenfresh,1 point,Fri May 8 19:12:19 2015 UTC,"After reading a lot about it, especially on that cut hockey sticks website that I see brought up around here a lot, I was thinking of cutting it to the center of my collar bone while on skates. Right now though it's an 85 flex stick and I'm 160lbs. I know it'll be way too stiff but I feel like it's better to have right length and wrong flex than other way around. Thoughts?"
hockeyplayers,35bfim,stubby-fingers,2,Fri May 8 21:42:19 2015 UTC,"Cutting to you collar bone seems a little to short. I prefer to have a short stick as well so I cut my sticks to right under my chin.   It is also important to make sure the majority of the blade is flat on the ice/ground when you are holding it. If you cut too much off you will find that too much toe is touching and it will affect your passing and shooting.   If you find you cut too much off you can always add a plug and extend it. Personally I like to leave a little extra so I can shorten it more if I want, plus I think adding a plug doesn't give a stick the same feel."
hockeyplayers,35bfim,BananApocalypse,2,Fri May 8 22:29:40 2015 UTC,That sounds a bit short but it's all preference. I like mine a bit longer so I go all the way around my upper lip on skates.   As for actually cutting I use a regular hacksaw and file it smooth
hockeyplayers,35bfim,kr580,1 point,Fri May 8 22:31:55 2015 UTC,Collarbone is on the shorter end of the spectrum. In my opinion I'd cut it at the chin and go from there. If you need it shorter you can always trim a little more. You can always add length back with a plug but it's the easier and cheaper route to cut little by little until you really like it.   Look up hockey stick lie and think of that as well.
hockeyplayers,35bfim,EvilGopher,1 point,Fri May 8 23:20:58 2015 UTC,"I'd say start with cutting it to your chin with skates on or nose with skates off and go from there. You can always cut more off if it's too long but can't add more back if you cut it off. I would say don't worry too much about flex right now, worry about length."
hockeyplayers,35bfim,ludo_kressh,1 point,Fri May 8 23:43:23 2015 UTC,"Collar bone isn't too short.  Many forwards, including pros, cut to the collar bone.  I just recently started cutting mine to the collar bone (used to cut to the chin) and I feel like I have better overall control of the puck.    Use a miter saw for a nice clean cut."
hockeyplayers,35bfim,OilyButt,2,Sat May 9 03:23:03 2015 UTC,"I'm a bit hesitant now after all the other replies, so I'll take it a bit at a time.  I guess I'll have to buy a saw. I had always heard chin like everyone else was saying until I saw how many pros actually used sticks significantly shorter than that. Right now, my stick is to my nose on skates. WAY too big, but it's all I've ever used so I'm also used to it. I'll try chin and then take it from there."
hockeyplayers,35bfim,Whatsalodi,1 point,Sat May 9 19:13:14 2015 UTC,"As people have been saying, it's all preference.  But yes, it's true that a fare amount of pros do cut it around to the collarbone.  I think the most important thing though is that the stick blade lies flat on the ice.    Your position also factors in a bit.  Generally defensive denfensemen will have a longer stick, and wingers shorter.  I recently switched from around my chin to collarbone, and found that controlling the puck in close was much easier and I like the change."
hockeyplayers,35bfim,kingofthediamond,1 point,Mon May 11 07:30:34 2015 UTC,"I would leave it, I'm 5'7 barley 150 and also have an 85 flex and got good at shooting with it after like two weeks and then got a cheeappp graf (like 30$) with a 65 flex and cut off like 5 inches so its just under the 75 flex mark. And I can't really deciide what I like more because I feel like with the bigger stick my shit it faster and harder. But it may be personal preference and the graf could be weaker material. The blade feels a little thing but my easton gives me a good forearm workout."
hockeyplayers,35bfim,beamseyeview,3,Sun May 10 04:40:17 2015 UTC,Hacksaw and I also like to file the ends to round the edges
hockeyplayers,35bfim,borkborkbork99,2,Fri May 8 21:46:10 2015 UTC,hacksaw.  Measure twice etc. And remember it becomes a stiffer stick with less flex as it gets shorter

hockeyplayers,35bfim,GoodOleCanadianBoy,1 point,Fri May 8 20:02:21 2015 UTC,"As others have said, measure twice cut once. Be sure to clamp the stick down close to where you're cutting it. They're kind of a bitch to cut through when you don't clamp them down."

hockeyplayers,35bk4p,remz07twos,2,Fri May 8 19:08:43 2015 UTC,"Do you have tape on your shaft? The abrasiveness of the tape could be ripping stitches out. I've found that taping my shafts wears down the palm faster, so I've switched to grip coating so I don't have to tape.   I have the Bauer X100's (a step below the APX 2'S) and I noticed a loose thread when I first used them, but I cut it to prevent further fraying. I've had the gloves since March and play 4x/week (3 roller, 1 ice) and I haven't seen any wear issues since."
hockeyplayers,35bk4p,tgoace,1 point,Fri May 8 20:11:31 2015 UTC,Yeah it's somewhat common. If you really want you can take it to a shoe repair place and they can sew on a leather patch for 5$.

hockeyplayers,35bk4p,arriflex,1 point,Sun May 10 22:00:22 2015 UTC,"I get that completely, you bought a brand new product, spent a lot of money, and it's bullshit that a design flaw has them falling apart so fast. I'm only saying you dont need that patch- if Bauer will let you exchange them at the store, maybe ask the store if you can swap up to Pros.   As to Pro Stock Vapors- honestly construction wise they are about the same. Both come from China, but with the Pro Stocks there may or may not be modifications ordered by the player. With Vapors it could be pro cuff of free flow cuff, palm material, gussets, finger length, type of backhand padding....etc.  Generally I'll just Wiki the player, if the gloves are listed at 14"" and he's 6'4 I generally assume he's got added finger length. If he's fairly close to my height I'm generally feeling good."
hockeyplayers,35bk4p,kingofthediamond,1 point,Sun May 10 22:13:38 2015 UTC,The pro stocks aren't player specific. But I'm going to probably do that. The Palm and cuff are different. Or I might just remove be rubber piece completely and call it a day
