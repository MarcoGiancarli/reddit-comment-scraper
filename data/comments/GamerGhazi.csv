He hates Republicans and libertarians. He would rather gag than be associated with social conservatives. He may be a total heel, but he's not a bigot, and is stridently anti-religious. The fact that so many libertarians and Republicans claim Rand as their intellectual goddess would likely infuriate him and her."
GamerGhazi,3e31b0,ccmulligan,3,Tue Jul 21 17:09:50 2015 UTC,That's a really interesting perspective. Do you know if there's any more detail on that?   Not sure about Rand caring though. Her personal views seem to line up quite well with a lot of them.
GamerGhazi,3e31b0,ccmulligan,11,Tue Jul 21 17:20:01 2015 UTC,"Do you know if there's any more detail on that?   Yes. Like I said, Amy Peikoff taught a philosophy class at my university. It was a required basic class (Epistemology) and I thought, as I was signing up for it, ""huh, that's weird, she has the same last name as that douche that edits all of Rand's terrible books."" Ayup. His wife.  She brought him in to guest lecture on a lot of classes, where the Randroids in class would sit at his feet and gobble up the bullshit he was feeding them. I sat at the back with the continental kid in the black turtleneck (yeah) and we made fun of him, but one of the local campus lolberatarians asked him one time what he thought of libertarians, and Peikoff went on this long diatribe about how Republicans would smash individuality under the guise of religious conformity and preservation of the social order, whereas libertarians said they supported freedom and the individual but were really just seeking another form of slavery, this time to their own baser instincts or without the self-affirming ""humanistic"" values Peikoff found in Rand.  To her credit, I sort of agree with Rand on this point -- she has an almost-fascist level of fascination with hero worship and cults of personality, but her philosophy is decidedly not nihilistic, whereas a lot of libertarian philosophy is very nihilistic."
GamerGhazi,3e31b0,ryannaughton1138,5,Tue Jul 21 17:24:26 2015 UTC,"Oh that's interesting! Yeah, I can see where he's coming from there.  I do think he's sort of cherry picking Rand like how most ""libertarian"" people cherry pick actual libertarianism and ""individual freedom"" mantras however.   Certainly that makes sense in comparison and in the context of what he was saying however. That's quite fascinating! Thank you :)"

GamerGhazi,3e29a7,missandric,11,Tue Jul 21 12:47:59 2015 UTC,"Jonah Lehrer was was caught ""self-plagiarizing"", not plagiarizing. Essentially he sold the same work to multiple publications. That's unethical, obviously, but it's very different from plagiarism. It's cheating the publishers, but it's not impacting another author or misleading the public about whose work it is. I think Ronson is being misleading by calling this ""plagiarism"" without qualifying. More generally I think we lose sight of why we have ethical standards when we obfuscate who is actually being harmed by unethical behaviors.  He did fabricate quotes though, which is just as bad as actual plagiarism."
GamerGhazi,3e29a7,MathRobot,2,Tue Jul 21 13:47:04 2015 UTC,"This is all wrong.  Lehrer's entire ouvre is full of plagiarism, facts and details changed for dramatic effect, and fraud, fraud, fraud. Virtually everything he has ever written contains serious violations of journalistic ethics. Several independent researchers have investigated samples of his writing and found them full of plagiarism and distortion.  He has been extraordinarily successful in minimizing his misdeeds and and painting himself as a remorseful, reformed man who if anything was a victim of excessive outrage. It is shameful that Jon Ronson has been taken in by him. He is an entitled, Teflon-coated Ã©lite asshole who has never been seriously held to account."

GamerGhazi,3e29a7,Ellie_Doodles,5,Tue Jul 21 14:08:05 2015 UTC,"I think the biggest sticking point for a lot of well-meaning people, and the blurry line that separates appropriate ""calling out"" from destructive mobs, is the question of ""how do we fix what's wrong?""    Because when most people call out shitty behaviour online, what they're trying to do is illustrate that there's a deeper problem with some kind of ingrained, systemic behaviour.    And the question of ""what is the problematic thing he/she/you/they said?"" is easy.    But when people subsequently ask themselves ""how should we fix the underlying problem?"" they often go off the rails, and confuse individuals with society at large.    To my mind, calling someone out by just saying ""hey, dude, that thing you said was kind of racist/sexist/homophobic/transphobic/etc..."" is fine.    But the appropriate reaction, after having called someone out, is to say something along the line of ""I don't necessarily think you meant to be taken that way, but maybe in the future you could try to be more sensitive to the feelings of people who aren't like you.""    But too often, the way people on the Internet follow up the initial call-out is to descend into a frothing whirlwind of one-upmanship, calling for the person to lose their job/home/relationships/civil rights/life.    I think part of it because of the public nature of most Internet platforms. When someone says something racist online, it's very easy to feel like they're attacking   Basically, on the Internet it's easy to forget that we all still have to live together offline, so generally the best way to fix the problems underlying statements worthy of being called-out is to try to educate the person and get them to consider other people's feelings in the future, not to try to eradicate them personally/professionally.    I think some of it may actually have to do with the contradictory sense of omniscience and impotence that the Internet fosters. Online, we can see so many instances of people acting like dicks that we become kind of overwhelmed. And we realize that we as individuals can't fix racism/sexism/homophobia/transphobia writ-large, but we believe we can fix this one instance we've encountered, so we go at the individual whole hog in part as a compensation for the fact that we're frustrated that we can't do more to fix the big-picture problem."
GamerGhazi,3e29a7,DrSoybeans,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:36:54 2015 UTC,"I think the difference is just politeness. You can tell if somebody genuinely wants to engage with you and wants to help improve the community by how they respond, e.g. ""that's a disgusting comment, you're wrong/homophobic/transphobic/etc."" is different from ""hey I just wondered if you knew how that could come across?""  One starts off aggressive, whereas the other is a genuine attempt to start dialogue."
GamerGhazi,3e29a7,Verpae,3,Tue Jul 21 18:24:41 2015 UTC,"Not sure how much I want to weigh in on this, but when Jon Ronson's book was first released and making the rounds for this. It was linked to a lot to people calling out sexism on twitter. So as much as I love the work he's done as a journalist and his emphatic portrayal of people with psychopathy, I'm not watching this from the most favorable position after he's been named dropped and work's been used to derail conversations. (I also can't watch it at the moment, as sound isn't work on this laptop)  Like we all have emotions that range in severity, they all have an adaptive and useful function at helping us self-regulate. Having shame is important, and it comes up in criminology journals for rehabilitating prisoners post-release as having an impact on recidivism rates. Outside of prison, it helps some of us work harder to avoid failure, not be a jackass, or ""reform"" ourselves in what ways we feel we need to.  This isn't really helped when it's larger group, the shame becomes inescapable, and there's no real designated way to absolve oneself or let alone a standard of how people would accept an apology. The Jack videos already hit on this with people being seen as all-good or all-evil with black and white thinking, and SMBC touched upon how crap apologies are received: http://www.smbc-comics.com/index.php?id=3754  As we drift towards the extreme edge of the shame spectrum; away from 'Sorry Dave I eat your sandwich in the staffroom fridge' we end up with impossible and meaningless demands like 'we just want you to accept responsibility[1]' by randoms on the internet, which comes off as coded for 'we want you to beg to us as we destroy your life'.  (Which makes it sound more like a phrase you never want to hear outside of an S&M club) So there is a very important thesis in what I've picked up on Ronson's book, but I feel it's nuance is going to either be lost or pertaining to the exclusivity of Ronson's views. Which is also how I feel about Anita Sarkesian[2], is that despite numerous other critics we only really know her and not necessarily for the best reason, ie. the whole public shaming and campaign of harassment.  [1]: for crimes that could've been real and/or imagined and exaggerated.  [2]: Because I know this will get quotemined elsewhere, when I say we only know Sarkesian I'm not saying the wealth of youtube white-washed, dude-droning talking heads are being ignored but there's woman/PoC/queer critics who's opinions are worth listening to but aren't.    I also think we're aware of what damage hunting people down online has, if not explicitly then by a number of us definitely are using pseudonyms detached from our other web accounts when talking on Ghazi. I ended up following Quinn's advice last year of paying for private hosting just to avoid getting deadnamed incase it ever came to that ... so glad I'm not famous."

There are no ""right targets"" for this.  Nontheless: getting called out for racist jokes is not haressment. Yes what happend to the lady was beyond ""calling out"" I agree. But to imply that she just made an innocent joke and the evil mob came after her is at best ignorant. (and I mostly mean the comments) EDIT: Might leaped a bit too far with ""racist joke"". Maybe ""badly worded joke"" is more fitting."
GamerGhazi,3e29a7,OctavianXXV,25,Tue Jul 21 12:19:59 2015 UTC,"But to imply that she just made an innocent joke and the evil mob came after her is at best ignorant.   Does her intent not matter? Can a joke not invoke race to mock racist ignorance? Is that a racist joke or an anti-racist joke? When Colbert says silly things like ""I don't see colour"" is that erasure of race issues or is it a satire of such erasure?   I think there's a distinct difference between 'call out' culture and actually educating people. It's the exact problem of assuming the position of moraliser, as though it is one's duty to 'call out' transgressions, and make sure they're spread far and wide, which is conducive to witch hunting.  If a friend of mine said something I thought was racist, I'd discuss it with them personally, not get out a megaphone. And though it's of course reductive to refer to the reaction as an 'evil mob' (and that's the exact point, not reducing people to simple traits like 'evil'), it certainly was a mob, and one encouraged by professional gossip mongers and rabble rousers like Gawker."
GamerGhazi,3e29a7,Essar,17,Tue Jul 21 12:58:19 2015 UTC,"This is an excellent point, and an incredibly important distinction, and one of the reasons I don't like Twitter at all. When we pull out the megaphone, it is no longer about educating someone. It becomes about us. It becomes about self-righteousness, schadenfreude, and elevation by denigration. And bringing other people into it is simply a piranha attack; everyone just wants to get a piece. It's the technological equivalent of a stoning."
GamerGhazi,3e29a7,Archchancellor,4,Tue Jul 21 13:14:07 2015 UTC,Twitter combined with Reddit or any other forum has the opposite effect of education on the person.

GamerGhazi,3e29a7,lifestyled,5,Tue Jul 21 14:07:19 2015 UTC,"Somehow I doubt that education came from people going ""Ugh, racist! Sexist! Just go kill y'self #killyourself""  And Twitter is poorly designed for the task. When it began, it was designed purely as a platform for telling other people who subscribe to your feed what you were doing (and not what other people are doing wrong). But, very quickly as the war of follower numbers took over, people found they got more followers by playing up to in/out-group dynamics and so dedicated most of their time rallying the in-group by castigating the out-group. To really seal the deal, the character-count restriction promotes slogans rather than discussion (something that forums can avoid with decent moderation). The shitshow that Twitter is now was inevitable once that behaviour became normalised."

Itâs the medium people use and what route is most effective that should be the topic of discussion.  And when the push to educate degrades into straight up harassment.

It is really disheartening, especially when so often we all stop and wonder why GGers have such an obsessive hate of ""SJWs"". Now I not only no longer wonder, I empathise to an extent.  This all reminds me of this episode of Stewart Lee's comedy vehicle.

I remember when Amy Schumer caught absolute hell for her routines and racism, and while I understood where the criticism was coming from, I didn't agree with it, because I saw it as a caricature: ""dumb white blonde"" satire. Yes, the jokes are racist, and some people think that way. She was just putting it out there like she has no Brain-To-Mouth filter.   It was difficult to defend the position, because we're right smack dab in the middle of a conversation about what comedy should be, and what responsibilities it has.   Don't worry, not everyone disagrees with you."

GamerGhazi,3e29a7,BeetlecatOne,2,Tue Jul 21 16:21:34 2015 UTC,"There's really no way of knowing from the tweet alone whether she didn't care about being racist, or whether she intended to parody racism, or whatever else. You can of course be racist without intending to, and in a contextless medium like Twitter I think you have to be prepared for people to read your words in the worst possible light.  It's a reasonable question whether, in the case of racism, the speaker has a responsibility to make themselves clearly understood or the listener has a responsibility to make sure they accurately understand. I personally think the responsibility is mostly on the speaker.  But I still don't think a racist tweet from an ordinary unimportant person, even an intentional one, deserves that kind of harassment."
GamerGhazi,3e29a7,MathRobot,3,Tue Jul 21 14:41:50 2015 UTC,"Her previous tweets were littered with tongue-in-cheek jokes making fun of the typical Westerner. If she meant that as a purely racist joke, it would have stuck out radically from her entire timeline."

A few things:   Gamergaters are propagating this over-simplification that it's only ""SJWs"" who do this shit, which is ironic considering that their group is founded upon a man ruining the life of a woman for selfish reasons. Gamergaters believe that these SJWs are a concerted effort to ruin people, rather than individual users causing avalanches.

GamerGhazi,3e29a7,snowy2004,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:14:38 2015 UTC,"This even made me rethink some of my own reactions to the drama with the management of Reddit or Gawker. There are times that (while trying to not add to it) I revelled in the aftermath or other's reactions to the drama. And I knew that that wasn't all that healthy. Heck, even here, months before, I'd come to see the newest gaffe or transgression by someone on Twitter or KiA. But... yeah, feeling ""above it all"" doesn't help anyone except yourself.  There's always this difficulty of figuring how to deal with such events and realizing that there's humans behind all of them. And that can be difficult. It can be easy to lose your empathy when you don't know the whole story or when others have accepted to let go of theirs already."

I'll leave a quote from a Ghazelle I agree with, who's said it so much better than I could.   Absoutely, completely, hate this opinion. It's liberals wanting to justify an ""I would support you if you weren't so uppity"" opinion while also pretending they're somehow different than the other side.   There's also the usual criticisms of TED talks, that it's a shallow, style-over-substance advertorial which doesn't really benefit anyone except the person giving the talk."

GamerGhazi,3e3huz,diehtc0ke,11,Tue Jul 21 17:53:02 2015 UTC,"Parts of this article is kinda dumb:   Today Reddit is governed, insofar as itâs governed at all, by a cabal of high-powered moderators who coordinate with administrators in private forums. The most influential of these forums, Modtalk, allows access only to moderators who oversee subreddits with a combined subscriber base of at least 25,000. A convoluted moderator culture has developed, full of intrigue and drama. Moderators are deposed after power struggles; the community is periodically wracked by allegations of payola and other schemes in which moderators game Reddit for personal gain. Moderators parse Reddit employeesâ every post to see if other moderators are in or out of favor with the company. When Ohanian made his first public comment during the Reddit Revolt, he first petitioned Modtalk, and only afterward spoke to the general masses.   Most of this paragraph is nonsensical or exaggerated. I'm not sure what they're even trying to reference with this line: ""Moderators parse Reddit employeesâ every post to see if other moderators are in or out of favor with the company""  Also, isn't /r/defaultmods more influential than /r/modtalk, and didn't kn0thing post there either first, or at the same time as in modtalk?   The moderator class has become so detached from its mediating role at Reddit that it no longer functions as a means of creating a harmonious community, let alone a profitable business. It has become an end in itself â a sort of moderatocracy in which the underlying logic of moderation has been turned on its head. Under the watch of its moderators, Reddit has become a haven for extremists: The Southern Poverty Law Center recently called it the new ââhome on the Internetââ for white supremacists, and it also functions as the central organizing point for the dubious ââmenâs rightsââ movement.   Most power mods seem to rather dislike the extremist parts of reddit, so they seem to be making a connection that mostly doesn't exist.   Any attempt to enforce real-world norms is rejected by the moderatocracy as impinging on their absolute authority over their miniature domains.    Uhhh. No. Reddit itself is what's holding back, not mods.  The power of modtalk is hugely exaggerated, and based on my experience there, most were disappointed that reddit didn't go further to curb hate communities."

The problem with Gamergate is:   Progressive politics are nothing to be suspicious of.  You don't like the political argument?  Read something else. Just because you suspect something doesn't mean you have good cause to.  Doubt your suspicions. The worst, most insidious thing that a games journal could ever be capable of would still not be deserving of calling a woman a ""cunt"". Your suspicions don't make you a movement or ""revolt"".  Your suspicions mean you have a bare minimum of reading comprehension and engagement. There is nothing inherently noble about being a consumer.  You have rights, but not entitlements. If your suspicions are proven true: speculate the very worst implications of them... and then turn those down 3 notches. But by all means: speak your mind.

However, it is stupid that we'll have no solo led Female Hero films until Captain Marvel drops considering that Black Widow has become a staple of the MCU and that Marvel ignores Female fans akin to Cartoon Network with Young Justice. I mean, Agent Carter is fantastic but it's a bandaid on a damm in terms of diversity.  P.S.: Hey, Marvel, you should totally let Phase 4 have an A-Force Movie in some form.

Once you get through all of those, what major female characters does marvel have left that have existed for more than five years and have ever been popular enough to get their own book?

It hasn't just illuminated why I've found it so frustrating to interact with some people (including some ex-boyfriends), but also answered some of my questions about, e.g., why I sometimes have trouble maintaining friendships even when I really like a person. Someone commented, lower down in the thread, about how recognizing the concept of emotional labor is one of those ""can't unsee!"" things---once you know what to look for, it's suddenly everywhere, and it explains so much about the dynamics of our personal lives.  I really recommend that anyone who has ever had  (or wants to have) any sort of relationship with another human being read that thread. Read the original article and the comments on that, too, if you can, but just read as much of the Metafilter comments as you can (I realize it's a very long thread).

GamerGhazi,3e0xfy,wightjilt,6,Tue Jul 21 09:12:51 2015 UTC,I don't get it either. I thought the SJW people got a bit too vicious during the Witcher 3 thing but that doesn't mean that GG hasn't spent the last year teaming up with Breitbart and neo-nazis.
GamerGhazi,3e0xfy,Doldenberg,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:09:55 2015 UTC,"I think the whole Witcher 3 thing was a very strange affair that showed everyone that cultural criticism really isn't easy. On the one hand, you had Polygon, which made a very moderate, but also very vague article which left behind a rather unsatisfying feeling; followed by more typical short and superficial statements - really showing the problem with being a cultural critic mostly active on Twitter - without anyone truly diving into the issue; on the other hand you immediately had Fanboys jumping in with cultural relativism and other highly stupid arguments; and you had Gators being dickheads, as usual."

Either way, knew this film was gonna be excrement from the minute I heard of its announcement, but honestly the fact that it comes out so close to Mister Iwata's unfortunate passing is what really makes this sad for me.

Here's Guillermo del Toro talking about working with Hideo Kojima on the heart-breakingly cancelled Silent Hills:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAQlWpcs8nE  This man is an overall good guy and has immense respect for Kojima.

It stumbles in a couple of places where it tries to get too emotional, or when Apatow lets Schumer shoot off a few too many one-liners. Through most of the movie, Schumer is not really acting, she's just doing her comedy shtick. Overall, though, the writing is phenomenal, and the casting is great. Tilda Swinton is unfuckingbelievably good. I honestly didn't recognize her until I saw her name in the credits."

In their eyes, any game is just this self contained entity, that doesn't interact with anything outside of it, except from the player. A lot of gamers want games to be treated as serious media, but also don't want to deal with the implications of that. Any time someone brings up games that are critical of themselves, there are always those who decry it as a pretencious piece of shit.  My favorite example of that is Spec Ops: The Line. Whenever you bring up that scene in a discussion, some people just go nuts.   In broad terms, the game makes you commit multible war crimes, and then says to you ""Hey dickhead, look at what you did, just because we told you to do it. Feel like a hero yet?""  I love it. It's a genius use of the medium. It's pointing out all the bullshit that is going on in military shooters right now. Sure, you can argue that it's bad that the game didn't give you a choice, and even if you play the game again and know what is going to happen, you can't advance without doing what you are told. But I see it as part of the whole commentary. The player is like a soldier that is conditioned to follow orders. So what does he do, when he finds out that the orders are bullshit? And why does he even care now? He did the exact same thing in other games, they just didn't show you the consequences of his actions.   Some people hate this reasoning, but I think you totally have a choice in the game. The game just made you do something bad. You can stop playing if you don't like it. Nobody is forcing you to keep playing. So why do you do it?   By saying that the game is bad for doing what it did, they are denying it any deeper meaning. They expected mindless entertainment and instead got called out on what they are doing. Kneejerk reaction is to dismiss this and just proclaim the game as pretencious. Sigh"

Knowing that will cause me dysphoria. I don't really care about engendering empathy in cis people, compared to that.   To be fair, since sex is assigned randomly in this game, I don't think people will necessarily conflate the sex of your avatar with your own gender identity. That happens in a lot of MMO games, but you generally choose your avatar's appearance in them.   They'll be thinking of my character as male and associating it with me. That's enough. I have enough trauma regarding this stuff that anywhere near it is too close, honestly.     And another:   welp thats me not playing rust ever cause I don't wana be forced to play as a male character   It'd be nice if there was a way to transition or something in the game if it goes the forced route. Then it can at least work a bit."

Making changes to that paradigm is risky, so they've been trying desperately to ignore other races and women gamers, despite all evidence pointing to their existence as a growing and potent consumer force, so as to not alienate their racist/sexist consumers (re: Gators) and potentially affect their bottom lines. The ones that do take the risk, which includes the Rust devs at this point, are the ones who get targeted by those consumers for not being 100% catered to.    Ask yourself: why is it that people really only have broad discussions about the role of identity with games when the stars of those games aren't straight, white men? Why are they the default, where any deviation from this ends up being noteworthy at best (Metroid, Far Cry 4) or heavily resisted at worst?"

A few years ago, my relationship with a woman I'd been dating for a decade (basically my entire adult life) ended in large part because it came out that she had been cheating on me for nearly three years.    This was, unequivocally, the single most devastating thing that has ever happened to me. And yes, I know that, in the grand scheme of things, this marks me as pretty lucky. But all the same, I was emotionally obliterated for quite a while.    Honestly, I consider it a pretty important event in my development as a person, because I could so easily have reacted by becoming an embittered, jealous, distrustful MRA-type asshole who blamed all women for the horrible behaviour of one woman. I didn't.    And part of that had to do with letting go of the desire for revenge.    My situation was complicated and not worth dragging out again. Suffice it to say, she was a horrible person who consciously made the choice to manipulate me in order to preserve the emotional stability she got from our relationship while also generally treating me like shit and disregarding our (previously) mutual expectations of monogamy.    And when the whole thing came to light, I admit that I wanted very badly to hurt her. I wanted to tell all of her friends and family what she'd done. I wanted everyone to know that she was awful. I wanted her to feel just as awful I as I felt.    But I never told anyone (aside from some very close friends of mine). I never outed her. Because I came to the conclusion that my own personal vindication was not worth publicly airing my ex's dirty laundry and shaming her to her family and friends.    So while, on the one hand, I have no sympathy whatsoever for people who's lives wind up ruined because of their cheating, I do not under any circumstances think it is appropriate for anyone to play vindicator and release someone's private information in order to ""strike a blow"" against cheaters.    I mean shit, this is the reason I started commenting on Reddit: initially I had just created an account because some friends had directed me to some hilarious surreal subs like /r/wheredidthesodago. Then, one day, I came across a post that Eron Gjoni had made on KiA, and felt compelled to respond to him personally to ask why he thought he was justified in what he did to Zoe, even if she had cheated on him (comment here, if anyone's interested). Basically, I could have been Eron, and I'm thankful every day that I had enough capacity for critical self-reflection that I'm not.    This is getting pretty rambly, but the TL;DR version is: Yes, people who engage in non-consensual non-monogamy are despicable. No, that doesn't justify publicly outing them just to satisfy a vengeance-boner."

GamerGhazi,3e0nnc,Bloo_Driver,2,Tue Jul 21 15:19:02 2015 UTC,I have friends and other acquaintances whom I suspect are or are on the edge of that crowd. It is scary.
GamerGhazi,3e0nnc,Lysmerry,3,Tue Jul 21 16:29:06 2015 UTC,"On one hand I'm really not going to say that these folks deserve this at all. On the other hand, Ashley Madison very certainly deserves the threats because apparently AM has been we-promise-its-not-extorting their members by offering a fee to delete their records. So unless you pay this fee, AM keeps you profile up for other users to find whether you like it or not. And now it turns out that even the users who paid the fee weren't getting what they asked for, because the ""full delete"" fee didn't do anything but lock the profiles to private (which were dug up by the hackers).   Shady crap all around."
GamerGhazi,3e0nnc,piwikiwi,6,Tue Jul 21 15:17:46 2015 UTC,"It would be perfectly fine just to let the significant other know. Unfortunately, with 'leaks' you can't simply inform the SO, and are instead setting a crowd of uninformed outsiders on the 'perpetrator.'  I would not equate it directly with revenge porn because with revenge porn the only 'crime' is trusting an intimate partner, while here there is more wrongdoing.  However, I don't think it comes down to 'deserving' or not, as the public does not know the details and it is not their place to judge. It is simply dangerous and irresponsible to make this information public."
GamerGhazi,3e0nnc,timetide,10,Tue Jul 21 04:35:53 2015 UTC,And that's before getting into the possibility of people who were having 'affairs' with permission.

My personal feelings come into play here, because I am happily, monogamously married and except in cases where a partner is being abused and can't easily leave, don't care much about protecting the ability of cheaters to cheat.   But the bottom line is, what they're doing is unethical. But the answer to that is not another unethical action. It's not the general public's business, it's the business of the cheaters and those they're cheating on."

GamerGhazi,3e0nnc,AgaGalneer,-14,Tue Jul 21 02:03:23 2015 UTC,Cheating isn't immoral.   It's a cruel thing to do. But it isn't immoral.
GamerGhazi,3e0nnc,Random_Tangent,11,Tue Jul 21 02:10:09 2015 UTC,"Depends on what your moral framework is. I would consider unnecessary acts of cruelty immoral.  I also acknowledge that there are far worse things a person could do, and I don't want to be the sort of person who would take part in them or set them in motion."
GamerGhazi,3e0nnc,numberonepaofan,10,Tue Jul 21 02:21:19 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't even need to go so far as 'unnecessary acts of cruelty'. It's willful deceit/dishonesty, in a relationship that has, implicitly and explicitly, in this case (marriage), an expectation of honesty, fairness and respect towards your partner.  Cheating breaches all three of those. It's dishonest, because cheaters hide it from their partners, it's unfair, because you're withholding information that would potentially (and likely) lead to your partner leaving you, or contracting STDs, or at least distrusting you, and it's disrespectful, insofar as you're not respecting your partner's wishes for a monogamous relationship."
GamerGhazi,3e0nnc,Random_Tangent,6,Tue Jul 21 03:31:12 2015 UTC,"I'd agree completely, and I think that gives me more than enough reason to dump someone who cheats on me.  But not nearly enough to post their personal information in a public forum where they will be harassed and hounded by bigots. I wouldn't wish that on anyone."
GamerGhazi,3e0nnc,_rhetz_,3,Tue Jul 21 03:50:38 2015 UTC,"I fully agree with that. It seems the hackers have beef with the deletion feature, where you actually have to pay AM to delete your account permanently, and they don't actually delete it completely (or at all).  Still, seems like a shitty thing to do to retaliate with user data. Company internal data (that proves shady dealings) might be a better option, if that's what they're trying to get at."
GamerGhazi,3e0nnc,Random_Tangent,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:19:43 2015 UTC,"If that was the case, they could directly email the individual users. If they have the data, they could just BCC them in a mass email."
GamerGhazi,3e0nnc,wurstomat,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:24:52 2015 UTC,"But by definition, cheating is immoral. It requires one to subvert established rules (in this case taking wedding vows and then breaking them). Morals are simply established principles, so cheating is contrary to morals, aka immoral.  Now, someone can avoid the rules without breaking them. This is amoral behavior (lacking morals). In this case, that would be like someone who's not married using Ashley Madison. For some reason, people tend to have a negative connotation about the word amoral when they probably shouldn't."
GamerGhazi,3e0nnc,Phoenix_Blue,2,Tue Jul 21 04:30:20 2015 UTC,Isn't cruelty immoral? I would think cruelty would be the most universally accepted signifier of immorality.

Usually only vaguely groking it when it's about race.
GamerGhazi,3e0i1n,Feminazis8MyIceCream,3,Tue Jul 21 05:07:36 2015 UTC,Sometimes it's unconscious bias and sometimes it's open bigotry.  I've seen plenty of both in tech culture.

But, also in his Wikipedia page   Computer Games Magazine wrote that ""over time, his reputation as an online defender of his games and unabashed pistol-whipper of his enemies overshadows the games themselves."" In an interview which was featured on the cover page of Computer Gaming World, Smart said of his online persona: ""Sometimes when I get online, and it's quiet, and I see something that attracts my attention, I'll post just to piss these guys off. That's why I do it. Because I'm in a good mood that day, I go in there and I start trouble.""   Sounds like a great person to be around and someone I'd love to face in a debate."

GamerGhazi,3dz6k0,CatPlant,9,Mon Jul 20 19:12:14 2015 UTC,"I had an interesting conversation with someone on twitter who said that part of the reason why the gaming industry has been so much more hospitable to GG than other fandoms they have tried to branch out of is that a lot of gaming developers can't take criticism. They don't have a background in the arts that helps you build up a skin thick enough to see people trash your work, which can of course be very painful to see but is also necessary for the artistic process. Instead they lash out attack the critic, trying to dismiss the criticism rather than engaging them. This is a common trait we have seen in GG supporting or sympathetic devs like this guy, Dyack, Chmielarz, and Kern. They feel like they are under attack when someone criticizes their work, and they want other people to defend them, by any means necessary. So basically you get these incredibly petty, argumentative guys who feel like they have to flame anyone who mentions them to defend their honor or whatever."
GamerGhazi,3dz6k0,_rhetz_,4,Mon Jul 20 19:35:25 2015 UTC,"Although, the things I hear from devs constantly are that to succeed in this industry, you have to * be good at collaboration and listening to your teammates * be able to take criticism and use it to improve your work * leave your ego at the door * etc  same as anything where you have to get a huge team of people working together to create something.    Other than the guys you mention, it looks to me like like it's almost never devs lashing out at critics, it's fans white-knighting (black-knighting?  what's the appropriate term?).    Something I just realized, though - what is it with GG devs and open-world space sims?  Wardell; Smart; Rogue-whatsisface ..."

GamerGhazi,3dz77g,EtienneZola,15,Mon Jul 20 18:50:40 2015 UTC,Some context for non-Canadians. Christie Blatchford (National Post) and Margaret Wente (Globe and Mail) are well-known scoundrels and reactionary scolds in the Canadian press. Blatchford is well known for her fantastically exploitative crime reporting while Wente is known for her plagiarism. I'd seen this story floating around but hadn't paid it much mind but I'm not the least surprised to find out Blatchford is behind the current harassment generation.
GamerGhazi,3dz77g,DanyLektro,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:53:50 2015 UTC,"Some more context for non-Canadians.  The Globe and Mail and National Post are our only two nationally-printed and circulating print newspapers, both right-leaning. The Globe and Mail is the more respected, more popular and less right-leaning of the two."
GamerGhazi,3dz77g,DanyLektro,2,Tue Jul 21 05:20:27 2015 UTC,"I would dispute that point. Between Wente, the continued pro-Harper line of the editorial board, and the reflexively pro-business/labour-hostile tendency in their business and political reporting, the Mop and Pail seems hardly distinguishable from a lot of what comes from the Nationalist Post. Indeed, I'd argue the libertarian-streak in Coyne has made him a stronger, more consistent critic of Harper than many of the Globe's mainstays (and that is no endorsement of Coyne's politics, I would add). The best I can give the Globe is that they allow slightly more scope of criticism on their editorial page. For an actual political difference I'd argue the Toronto Star and Vancouver Sun are more diverse than the two national dailies."
GamerGhazi,3dz77g,Caelrie,2,Tue Jul 21 14:08:27 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure that I agree on a more general sense. Harper's Conservatives are angering the right wing too, being critical of them doesn't necessarily make one less right-wing. The Globe on the other hand has been a staple of the economic right for as long as I can remember. I've definitely seen more centrist material out of the Globe in the last few years than the Post (though I can't name specifics offhand).  But hey, I live in downtown Toronto, I don't keep track of either of them really, the Star's one of my old local reliable options for print media :P"

You should probably get your head out of your ass. You're starting to act like it.   act like what? someone who actually acknowledges the massive talent gap between women and men in most sports?   Ha ha, I just listened to a podcast this week that had a veterinary scientist on to talk about how dogs would perform in US Olympic track & field events, and he demonstrated very convincingly that a well-trained but otherwise thoroughly average dog would win out over Usain Bolt every single time (unless you distracted them with treats and/or it was a blisteringly hot day). This is true not just for the short ""dash"" races, but also for marathons, etc. Dogs are just faster and have greater stamina than humans.   This massive talent gap between humans and dogs clearly proves that the Olympics should be canceled in favor of the Canine Olympics.   Or you know, you could also acknowledge that both men and women are capable of achieving impressive athletic feats that are worth watching, even though dogs are better.

GamerGhazi,3dzfa9,directhex,10,Mon Jul 20 20:49:33 2015 UTC,"I always say to never underestimate the power of even Token Gestures. Sure, it's a small thing, but it means when they have to put Fifa 17 together, or anyone else puts a Soccer game together, now it's not just them doing ""what they did last year,"" now they'd actually have to choose not to put a woman on the cover, and justify doing so, without having ""it's how we've always been doing it"" to fall back on. A relatively small thing, sure, but a visible one that changes the conversation."
GamerGhazi,3dzfa9,Flexhead,5,Mon Jul 20 20:14:11 2015 UTC,"Tokenism gets a bad rap. It's an important step towards allowing people who aren't ""default"" to exist without needing to justify their non-defaultness in some way. A token black character is a hell of a lot better than a character needing to justify their blackness."
GamerGhazi,3dzfa9,RexMundane,3,Mon Jul 20 20:44:15 2015 UTC,No women's world cup next year so no woman will be on the cover. Simple.
GamerGhazi,3dzfa9,Flexhead,3,Mon Jul 20 21:11:23 2015 UTC,People will still be wanting to play women's teams whether or not there's a cup next year. An audience that gamedevs will have to actively choose not to court. Not so simple.
GamerGhazi,3dzfa9,RexMundane,2,Mon Jul 20 21:21:12 2015 UTC,I have no idea how that is related to a woman being on the cover or not.
GamerGhazi,3dzfa9,Flexhead,3,Mon Jul 20 21:35:15 2015 UTC,"...sorry, I don't understand, are you proposing they'd keep women's teams in the game but not have a woman on the cover? Why on earth would they do that?"
GamerGhazi,3dzfa9,RexMundane,6,Mon Jul 20 21:40:28 2015 UTC,Because the cover depictions are the stars of the game for the current release cycle. I have a gut feeling that no womens soccer player will be a bigger star than any of the men for the next year simply due to no womens world cup happening.
GamerGhazi,3dzfa9,Flexhead,0,Mon Jul 20 21:42:10 2015 UTC,"Game box art isn't obliged to reflect what's ""happening in the sport right now"" though, it's main job is to sell the potential consumer on the product by reflecting what it contains and get them to buy. If there's a chance they gained some purchases by including a woman on the cover one year, and they'd lose those purchases by omitting her the next year, that's a difficult call to justify.  Plus, as far as relative star power of women soccer players, ignoring the unlikelyhood that literally zero noteworthy women's soccer players will emerge in the next year, that's an extremely nebulous thing to predict. If EA picked any random women's soccer player and put her in commercials for the game, she'd end up becoming comparably famous to a lot of ""star"" men soccer players. We're not talking Pele or Beckham levels of ""famous"" mind you, just ""visible""."
GamerGhazi,3dzfa9,RexMundane,4,Mon Jul 20 21:54:07 2015 UTC,"Game box art isn't obliged to reflect what's ""happening in the sport right now"" though   Sports game box art pretty much is just that."
GamerGhazi,3dzfa9,MrJoobJoob,0,Mon Jul 20 21:58:15 2015 UTC,"No, I understand it does that, but that's because hey, this player's in the news, lets put him on the box to help sell units. The box art isn't, like, contractually required to visually indicate to prospective buyers that there was no women's cup this year (or if they are then... then that's just a goddam ridiculous contract that makes both parties suffer for it, frankly). It exists to sell games. And removing a woman from the cover would risk aversely affecting that."

I hope I'm wrong on that one, but I'm afraid I'm not.  Also, I'm really hoping they'll include a way for men and women to play on the same team, because that would be just wonderful."

Chortle.   In GTA I hired pixels that looked like a prostitute, and afterwords I used pixels that looked like a car to run down other pixels. But so what? It's just a fantasy.   Not the use of the term ""a fantasy"", not ""fantasy"". As in ""I fantasize about running people over with cars"" instead of the shorthand for ""me running people over with cars is not a real thing that happens"". Hmmmm.

Yeah, I clearly remember Anita saying, ""I'm taking all the games away! Muhahahaw!!!"" I think what he means to say is he doesn't want to hear any criticism of his beloved pass time. Apparently having an opposing opinion and censorship are the exact same thing.  And if Jack Thompson taught us anything, it's that his criticism against video games didn't make them vanish, on contrary, they became more popular.   If this commenter is so for ethics in fact checking, he should really check his facts, starting with a dictionary definition of the word criticism."

GamerGhazi,3dyd20,_Synesthesia_,32,Mon Jul 20 15:19:09 2015 UTC,"I think the restaurant metaphor someone used further in that thread is apt.  To extend that:  Imagine there's this family restaurant called Reddit's Good Time BBQ, and everyone in town goes there.  It's super popular.  It's one of the biggest places to eat out around.  All sorts of people visit, and generally mind their own business.  You eat, you talk to your group, you leave.    Then sudden a big noisy family comes in, let's call them Fred Coontown, Sally Coontown and their twins Bobby and Sandy Coontown.  They talk loudly.  They talk loudly about hateful things, and call the other members in the restaurant racial epithets.  And maybe it's just them.  Maybe they only show up one day a week, and for most of the time, Reddit's Good Time BBQ is a friendly establishment.  But Fred Coontown and family are gathering attention.  They're loud, controversial, and can't help but occasionally walk over to other tables and start up heinous conversations.  Fred might even call over Sally for support.  It's getting out of hand.  People are complaining.  The Yelp reviews for the restaurant are plummeting, and reputation is at an all time low.    So what does Reddit's Good Time BBQ do?    It's basically faced with two choices:   Kick the Coontowns out. Leave the Coontowns alone, and let them eat.   Actually, I lied, and everyone was wrong because there's really a third option that no one considered.  In their brilliance, Reddit's Good Time BBQ went with:   Let the Coontowns eat for free, but put up a sign on the front door saying ""Warning: Fred Coontown is in the house"".  wat"

I mean let's face it, that's pretty much what most of them are already doing, and will do so regardless if others appreciate it, but I'd really like a meaningful way for users to challenge a subreddit's shitty behaviour. Especially since the people running this place are apparently unwilling or too incompetent to do so.  Of course there's subreddits like this for that, which is great, but right now it's too easy to dismiss as the other team; SJW conspiracies and all that. It doesn't effect people when their in a bubble.  I was thinking about up- and downvoting subreddits (skewed against # of subscribers), that affects the karma of it's subscribers or something. The big thing for me with this is that this would require minimum admin intervention, who seem to only start moving once they absolutely have to and even the screw it up, and it makes sense for the site, since we use it for everything else anyway. It's definitely not perfect though, there's still the issue of brigading, and it absolutely doesn't make sense for hobby or interest based subreddits to be scored this way, especially the niche ones.  And of course, put actual penalties on the subreddits and users that hit negative karma. Forcefully hide all comments on every thread so if someone wants to read them they have click every single comment; Delay their feed by an hour so everything will be old news once they finally get to it; Shadowban them if you want to be really drastic, but really make it hell for them to continue using this site.  It would basically make it a matter of numbers though, which really makes me wonder: Are there truly more shitty assholes on reddit than other people? If it is though, at least it'll be clear for once and for all and the rest of us can go find a better place to live.     Edit: Well, this would severely cut into reddit's userbase either way, so reddit will never actually implement any of this, but it would be an effective way to deal with it if reddit was actually serious about this issue."

Before all of this GG shit, I spent most of my time in various sports subs, a few hobbyist subs (history, beer, books), and none of the defaults. I knew there were elements to reddit that were shitty as hell, but I rarely every encountered them, and the communities and discussions I'd see/be a part of were most often engaging and thoughtful.  But since GG and spending time on Ghazi, I've seen that element that before I just wasn't ever exposed to. Nobody is brigading the sports subs. You start tagging certain names and realize the same ole guys are showing up in the same ole places every single time. You see links into the default subs and go, ""woooooow, sometimes the groupredditthink is unbelievably stupid and shitty and horrible"".  I mean, look at the most extreme case, former CEO miss Ellen. Has anyone ever endured so much vitriol and hate on this website, ever? Every post of hers is in the negative hundreds at least. Then literally the day after she resigns, she's striking up friendly conversation with strangers, everyone is giving her support, she's dropping dank memes, everyone seems to love her, upvotes abound. I saw a user make the joke ""hey, you seem to get reddit, you should run that place!"" I mean holy shit talk about a change in your reddit experience, and based solely on your job.

It's disgusting that companies are able to get away with this stuff, not only in Australia but internationally as well.   The article makes some really good points about the way that the bosses of the industry purposely blur the lines between the gaming scene and the job. From what I've heard it's a similar phenomenon at conventions - expecting fans to work long hours with low wages for the experience of being part of ""the culture"".   But I think there's another point that it misses - and that's the question of unions. Since the 80s in Australia the union movement has been on the backfoot, either beating back attacks from the bosses or giving in without a fight.   When this is coupled with the experiences of young students in the workplace (ie, atomisation, de-politicisation and no history of struggle) it means that bosses have been able to get away with intense exploitation.   What happens at EB games happens across all industries where young people are employed - and it'll keep happening until we organise."

Fixed that. Also note I've run music festivals and while I've had volunteers, I've only had them work before the event helping carry some speakers or whatever and then do an hour on the door, for that they get free entry, they hang out with the crew, they get dinner, lunch etc etc cooked for them, if they are musicians they get sets. I've done volunteering at anime and pop culture conventions when I was a teen and I was exploited to hell and back, 3 days doing 12 hour days of unpaid labour? Fuck that, it didn't take long for that exploitation to completely destroy my enthusiasm for cons. I had a friend a year back do volunteering for PAX and I remember saying ""This is a huge mistake, just go and enjoy the event man"" and he was like ""nah it will be fun to be an enforcer and hang out with the community"", not only did they still make him buy a ticket, he literally couldn't do anything he wanted at PAX and missed everything.

I'm an Enforcer, and that's absolutely not what should be happening or normally happens - we're treated pretty well, with shifts, ensuring we go on break, rules against working too much, so on, so forth. Nor is that unique to PAX AUS, that's 100% the standard treatment for every PAX. 12 hour shifts are explicitly not allowed. They do their best to try and make sure you do get to see as much of what you want as possible.  And you always, always, always get a badge - your enforcer badge is as good as an attendee badge, in terms of show access, no ifs or buts. I can understand if your friend bought a badge and didn't seek a refund after he became an enforcer - some people do that, some people sell on the tickets, so on, things happen - but PAX does not require enforcers to buy their badges, end of.  Make no mistake, something went seriously wrong there in a way that I genuinely can't see how it could have happen - even if your friend was determined to do as they did for some reason, Enforcers look out for each other, someone would have stepped in.

He admitted several times in his videos that handling social media stuff was too stressful for him and it caused irreparable damage to his reputation because that built-up stress would often cause him to lash out against against his fans the moment they said something even mildly critical about him.  For him to go and tell Anita to just deal with the harassment she's receiving is the very epitome of hypocrisy."

None of them create hit-lists that end up getting developers of card games harassed for not playing at 30fps.

I genuinely hope TotalBiscuit will someday find the one field-of-view slider that has always eluded him: his own.  (not original, remember someone else said that)  To TB's 'credit' (I guess?) it is clear that is isn't just the topic of feminism or whatnot that makes makes him lash out.

GamerGhazi,3dw0ly,hackmastergeneral,33,Tue Jul 21 09:04:48 2015 UTC,"He's the problem.   Ever since the Blue Plz days he's cultivated a fundamentally isolationist, elitist fanbase, and he's deeply beholden to them. They're largely steered by terrible people, so any time Baine does something that doesn't live up to their self-fellatiating purity tests he gets harassment and pressure from them. And, because he's cultivated a terrible fan base and doesn't pay the slightest bit of attention to how that has an impact on others, he gets a lot of pressure and criticism and mean words from everyone else whenever he tries to find the middle ground in between sensible and bugf#%$ irrational."
GamerGhazi,3dw0ly,SomeGuyInAWaistcoat,17,Mon Jul 20 02:12:12 2015 UTC,"This is so true. I used to watch TB's channel for about two years. He has an abusive relationship with his fans. There have been many dramas. Just recently, he made a video demonstrating a new city builder. His fans threw a fit and yelled at him for using a sub-optimal road layout. They attacked him because of the roads he built in a game. He was then forced to delete the video and make a new one. But since he's painted himself ""pro-consumer"", he feels like he can't criticize or discipline his fans, so now he's stuck. He can't complain about what his fans are doing to him, so instead he pours out all the accumulated anger and frustration upon the rest of the games industry -- colleagues, journalists, GG critics, Anita Sarkeesian."

How is it that people with three to four times as many eyeballs following them and hanging on their every word can be so off-the-rader in terms of insane controversy or E-drama?    Either TB is the problem, his audience is the problem, or some combination of the two.  And when you look at the kinds of people who watch (for example) Markiplier verses Bain there's a difference of night and day.    Markiplier's audience wants to have fun and watch silly games and laugh.  TB's audience are framerate-obsessing, entitled hyper-consumers."
GamerGhazi,3dw0ly,lifestyled,6,Mon Jul 20 09:20:12 2015 UTC,"Your suggesting there's something specific about the style of videos he makes that inherently gets his fans worked up in this way? Because I'm pretty sure there's other allegedly ""Consumer Reporting Focused"" gaming youtubers like Sterling who, again, aren't at the center of similar shitstorms, which brings it right back to Him. It's something he's doing, and something he has no interest in doing differently, no matter the damage it does.

GamerGhazi,3dw0ly,mister_slim,7,Mon Jul 20 15:23:37 2015 UTC,"To give him the benefit of doubt, maybe maybe I think it's that he's got a handful of over-zealous fans that think they're doing the right thing by telling him every time he's mentioned anywhere. I also think that ""handful"" has grown exponentially since GG started. I don't think he's namesearching himself (although he could be), and I don't think he's specifically told people to let him know when people are talking about him, but he doesn't tell them to stop either. The problem is, once he does know about it, it's in his nature to respond. He HAS to. He can't just let it go or pretend he didn't see it. I can understand that, sort of. I still think the criticism towards him is largely justified; he absolutely knows what he's doing when he publicly points people in a certain direction. Whether he believes it or not, he plays a key part in the harassment of others, through both his actions (retweeting opposing comments, or describing exactly where to watch the IA & MM videos) and inactions (NOT telling the biscotti to chill out)."

GamerGhazi,3dw0ly,Spaghettihouse,7,Mon Jul 20 00:54:51 2015 UTC,"I think this one is legitimate, because he is actually encouraging harassment, but there was a period when we had TB threads whenever he said something stupid (which is all the time).   He absolutely should not get a free pass for inciting harassment, but if we hang on his every word waiting for him to screw up in some minor way so we can make fun of him are taking it too far.   Totalbiscuit is an absolute shithead and I will never support anything he does, but there's a certain point where focusing on him too much becomes unhealthy for the community."

You wouldn't be as popular as you are if you weren't. I generally like your content, though I've unsubscribed from you a while ago when I just couldn't deal with the bs that kept getting tossed around. You're a powerful force in the gaming community, whether or not some people like it. I respect that, and in a way I aspire to be that myself.  But goddamnit TB, understand the power you have. You have thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of followers at your beck and call, yet you act as if you only have 100 listening to you that just so happen to stir shit up occasionally. You're not a lowly channel vying for attention any way you can. You're already a big deal(tm).  You frustrate me so much. You have power in this community, power that you've used for good, certainly. But you don't understand that not every action you've done leads to good, nor that your power lands on good people. It feels like you don't care where that good lands, or who receives the power that you wield, just that you care that you have the power to begin with.  Some people around here might read this and go ""duh, he's a pompous narcicistic ass-hat"". I'll admit, I feel that way sometimes. Other days I just get exhausted at the lack of self-awareness, at the destructive capabilities you hold with simultaneous glee and ignorance (some would say willful ignorance). That's not to say you're malicious, but that, like I said, you have power, and often times you wield that power with little self-reflection or empathy.  I dunno, this is mostly me talking to the void, venting at the air at my frustrations of, well, people in general. On the off chance this is read by you, you could easily brush all this off as pompous frou-frou whateverthefuck ranting. But at least understand that I care about people. I'm sincere in that caring. And it frustrates me to no end when I see people, intentionally or otherwise, be destructive towards eachother. And, well, you're a people."

He is a GlobberGrunter as much as the next KiA subscriber, but before that he is first and foremost a shrewd social business entrepreneur that protects his brand above all else.  He does not lack self-awareness.  He is not ignorant of his power.  He is simply aware that by carefully crafting the pretense of neutrality, he can appeal both to the mainstream and GG audience."

That wave will end one day though and he'll just leave it to find another, completely disowning GG in the process by shrugging it off and linking some tweet where he once claimed ""neutrality"".

In addition to this, videos supposedly critical of these actions have been taken down from Youtube with copyright claims, including a video by a smaller channel called MundaneMatt. It's difficult to tell what is true and what is not. 4chan is all up in arms over it which means that alongside any truth there's always going to be ridiculous stories and trolling attempts. 4chan is a blunderbuss. It's a giant cannon filled with fuckin screws, nails, bodyparts, shit and waifu. When it fires, maybe 1% of it hits and the other 99% just goes everywhere and makes a mess. Added into this whole drama shitstorm is a cadre of SJW types and whoever it is that is opposed to that, MRAs? I don't even know the terminology at this point and frankly I don't fucking care. The kind of places posting information about this whole thing are also places I'd take with a pinch of salt or who already have a clearly outlined agenda. Internetaristocrat did the main video on this, a channel mostly dedicated to debunking SJW topics and complaining about how prevalent they are in todays media. A fair cause for the most part, though it's a fine line to walk at the best of times.

He's a self-admitted ex-arsehole which means a lot, and he - generally - knows very well how to go about things. Remember when he shared an article by a trans woman on our murder rates, and then TB cried foul because he felt he was being put on the defensive (my feelings > your lives, basically)? That's what I'm talking about. Signal boost marginalised voices. Hell, he supports Andrea Ritsu's patreon.  And you know what, it's great that he can say 'hey, we argue stuff a lot', but it's...not very good when we don't know WHAT it is, and are you ever reaching conclusions together or does TB just slink off to his echo chambers again afterwards?  I mean...as much as a horrible person TB has been this past couple of months (side note: you can't justify the actual threats he's been receiving. That should go without god damn saying) and not actually taken stock of the mob clout he wields, I kind of cringed when Jim said people were ordering (strong words, but his) him to denounce TB. Like...I really don't like it when people do that. I don't like seeing people throw down 'them or me' ultimatums. IMO It's manipulative and cruel. Of course, YMMV.  Jim has every right to stay friends with someone. He's a smart man. He has a critical eye but he has history with him. But it's not his job to burn bridges, it's yours to just not support him. He has every right to stay friends with someone but everyone has the same right to say 'bye Jim' for associating with ass-top-hat."

Also Rowan's twitter is now private, by virtue of being optimistically Scottish I never really paid that much attention to TB (Channel, Fans, Curator on Steam*) but given what I can read I'm inclined to believe GatePleb's take on this with regards to siccing fans.  *I did buy Titan Souls because his comment was on the front page, describing it as an unrewarding boss rush game with the reward of MOAR BOSSES, and thinking this game was made for me.

Trans/queer people (and LGB people to a slightly lesser extent) know or worry about this possible eventuality with their closest of friends before we come out to them. Being trans is so stigmatized that we worry about which of our family and friends we might have to give up despite all signs pointing that they are progressive.  A lot of people who consider TB a friend likely feel indebted to him for the boost in subscribers/followers or, earlier on, even the chance at making YouTube their career on him.  Others know that, if they did decide to try to publicly denounce him, they'd end up targets in the same way his enemies have, some bigger and redder than others if they lack white, straight, cis, or male privileges... Some have even already experienced particularly creepy, individual harassment, and likely don't want to see it compounded 1000-fold by death eaters and biscotti...  So, as much as I wish that the content creators I enjoy who consider TB to be their friend would part ways unless he made a real effort to become better, I can certainly understand from a psychological PoV why they would be hesitant to do so... :/"

If I decided to end the friendship based on my friendâs actions, I wouldnât publically denounce them or really say anything about it in public.  Losing friends is a painful process and expecting people like Jim to reaffirm our dislike of TB is expecting a lot.  I understand why people want Jim to talk about it and its fine to be disappointed.  But I donât think we will ever really know when it happens."

If these books are selling well and interesting young boys and girls in stories by and about women, then I think the future of comic books could become incredibly exciting, hopefully creating a medium with some real diversity in its stories.

Obviously it's subjective but it really seems like these days films and pop art in general are doing less with more."
GamerGhazi,3duvqv,MrJoobJoob,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:58:45 2015 UTC,"This really is true. I mean look at these superhero movies of the last 5 years. How are they in any way intriguing or challenging to cultural conventions? It's especially frustrating considering that comics, like science fiction, have been such an interesting (and well-used) avenue for social criticism in the past."
GamerGhazi,3duvqv,WilWheatonsScrote,47,Tue Jul 21 03:36:40 2015 UTC,"As someone who has enjoyed quite a few of Alan Moore's comics books back in their day, I have to begun to see him of something of a dinosaur in the last few years.   His stories have become very self-referential, totally absorbed in intricate, yet often irrelevant details while severely lacking a compelling structure that holds all of it together (something that distinguished his early masterworks). Of course, this is the fate of many successful storytellers who are left to their own devices, without any editor ever daring to correct even the smallest of typos.   In my personal opinion, the problem with sexual violence and his entire approach to sex in general is something that very much resembles the kind of sleazy obsession many aging artists (unfortunately) display in their late works. Sex has always been present in Moore's work, but he has taken it to wholly different level in recent books such as ""Neonomicon"" (which I consider to be some of the worst stuff the man has ever published, and that does not only go for the sex parts in it).   It is often trite and simultaneously lurid and that is why his defense of sexual violence falls flat. Those who complain about the sexual violence in his works, do so because its inclusion seems to serve no other goal besides voyeuristic shock value. If it actually very an meaningful, artistic approach to this topic, people would give him much more leeway.    Unfortunately that is not what it is and I fear that we can't expect the man to change, considering his age. Stranger things have happened, but I doubt it.   Yet...  On the other hand, he still has a few good things to say. And I find myself agreeing with his statement about the current state of pop culture:    ""It looks to me very much like a significant section of the public, having given up on attempting to understand the reality they are actually living in, have instead reasoned that they might at least be able to comprehend the sprawling, meaningless, but at-least-still-finite 'universes' presented by DC or Marvel Comics. I would also observe that it is, potentially, culturally catastrophic to have the ephemera of a previous century squatting possessively on the cultural stage and refusing to allow this surely unprecedented era to develop a culture of its own, relevant and sufficient to its times.""   Although, it sounds snobbish, he makes a good point there, especially considering that he has always strived to push the boundaries of pop culture and I can very well understand why he is so deprecative considering that his mark on pop culture has been watered down to Anonymous masks and blind adoration for Rorschach's ""edginess"".  It says a lot about our time that people like many Gators can live entirely within a self-sustaining pop culture cocoon that has little to no resemblance to the real world."
GamerGhazi,3duvqv,squirrelrampage,10,Sun Jul 19 18:58:20 2015 UTC,"I thought Neonomican was an interesting take on Lovecraft, if nothing else. His mission statement with that story was to take the more sinister implications of Lovecraft's stories and blow them wide open. Personally I think those elements work better when they're implied rather than made explicit, but if nothing else it was intriguing and genuinely horrifying to see some of that stuff laid bare.   As far as his cultural critique stiff goes, I think he's dead on. We're currently in an era where studios are recycling pop culture landmarks, with very little making it big that could be said to be of this era. Videogames perhaps less so, as behemoths like COD and Mass Effect were created comparatively recently, but in films we're seeing a constant rebooting of franchises that thirty year old nerds and geeks would remember from their childhood. There have been relatively few blockbuster landmarks over the last few years that exist only in our time. Inception, Avatar maybe (though that's derivative as hell)... even Fury Road, which I adore, is based on a thirty year old franchise."
GamerGhazi,3duvqv,LordSepulchrave,6,Sun Jul 19 22:46:58 2015 UTC,"TW: Sexual assault.  The issue with Neonomicon isn't that it has rape, but that it totally misrepresents the nature of the situation. Eventually, the main character starts to have almost a comical relationship with the monster who repeatedly rapes her. Also, the depiction of it is lurid to a point of exploitation."
GamerGhazi,3duvqv,sheriff_gingerbeard,4,Mon Jul 20 13:21:51 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying that I enjoyed the inclusion of rape, or that it couldn't have been done better. However, I do think it's worth bearing in mind the context of the story: it's a modern Cthulhu story, meaning all its thematic content boils down to how humanity is fucked, the earth is doomed, civilisation is going to fall, and whatever higher power exists doesn't give a hint of a fuck about human notions of right or wrong. The events are meant to be cynical and unpleasant, as the core idea is that the world is a dark, horrible place and there aren't any happy endings.   I'm pretty sure the relationship you describe is meant to be a clear case of Stockholm syndrome. It's never meant to be interpreted as a healthy relationship, as by the end spoiler What she went through damaged her to the point that she simply doesn't give a shit any more. It's a horror story, so I don't mind it going into dark territory as long as it has a reason to do so, and in this case I think it did. The reason why it was so lurid, IIRC, was again, because Moore wanted to take the stuff that was implied in Lovecraft's stories and make it clear. Sort of like how Spec Ops took things that are implied in COD and Battlefield and made those explicit (the air-gun sequence, for instance). It's one part modern Lovecraft, but also one part deconstruction of Lovecraft, and even if I think some parts could have been done better, I think it was interesting to see Moore go about the same themes and ideas in a different manner to most other writers."
GamerGhazi,3duvqv,LordSepulchrave,3,Mon Jul 20 14:21:02 2015 UTC,"Fair points. I think your reading is a little bit kind to the text, but mine is also similarly unkind. As a result, I think any response I would have would boil down to, ""I read this aspect differently,"" with the subtext being that I think Moore has such a high status that his works are given more kind readings than they deserve. That's just a difference in perspective, so I don't think I would contribute much to that conversation.  That being said though, I never meant to imply you enjoyed those scenes or thought they were perfect. If anything I said did imply that, I apologize, as I was careful not to say something so reductive."
GamerGhazi,3duvqv,sheriff_gingerbeard,2,Mon Jul 20 14:54:07 2015 UTC,"It's fine. Different people have different interpretations of different stories, so don't think I'm trying to push my interpretation as gospel. I enjoyed Neonomicon a lot, but I think it's far from Moore's best work, and definitely has issues that could could have been worked out with another draft. I think he's said somewhere that he kind of had to rush this one out to pay a tax bill, so it's not one of his most polished stories by any means."
GamerGhazi,3duvqv,LordSepulchrave,7,Mon Jul 20 15:09:46 2015 UTC,"As someone who has enjoyed quite a few of Alan Moore's comics books back in their day, I have to begun to see him of something of a dinosaur in the last few years.    The fate of so many artists who become acclaimed enough they stop hearing any criticism.   Although, it sounds snobbish   Yes, extremely. And so do a lot of the people agreeing with him here."
GamerGhazi,3duvqv,GatePleb,2,Sun Jul 19 19:34:46 2015 UTC,I kind of gave up on Alan Moore when he had Voldemort rape Mina Harker in LXG: 1969.
GamerGhazi,3duvqv,GreyWardenThorga,2,Mon Jul 20 00:09:33 2015 UTC,"Ugh, freakin' preach. I'm so sick of Moore. I am a huge Lovecraft dork, and Moore is currently doing a series called Providence that's supposedly his attempt to blow the lid off of Lovecraft and Lovecraftian horror in the same way Watchmen did for superheroes. That's not an exaggeration; the publisher is literally calling it ""the Watchmen of horror.""   Instead, though, the first two issues are just Moore taking aspects of Lovecraft's cosmology and replacing bits with real occult referents. The last 15 pages of the second issue are a made-up pamphlet referencing numerous mythological creatures, and it's just so obviously Moore trying to say, ""Look how fucking smart I am."" Maybe the series will look different at the end of it all, but right now it's purely masturbatory. I'm beyond sick of Alan Moore and his self-congratulatory bullshit."
GamerGhazi,3duvqv,sheriff_gingerbeard,3,Mon Jul 20 13:24:23 2015 UTC,"Well arguably the thing to do now is to simply stop reading his work. Moore has always been an interesting creature, and has always been very aware of his place as a writer and a thinker. He thinks and writes what he would like to read, and the rest of the world will either like it or not but it will have little impact on what he actually does.  I find it funny how people will sit here and say that Moore is no longer of interest to them, when Moore will be the first person to say that if you read his stuff when you were younger then...he should no longer be of interest to you.  Moore expects his audience to surpass his work and develop new interests, because that is what humans are supposed to do. You are not supposed to latch on to one author and then stay intellectually betrothed to them for the rest of your life."
GamerGhazi,3duvqv,GucciJesus,3,Mon Jul 20 14:15:30 2015 UTC,"Sure, and I dig your point, but I'm not exactly a Moore acolyte. I read Watchmen and V for Vendetta when I was in high school and outgrew them. My only reason for reading Neonomicon and Providence is that I talk a lot about adaptations of Lovecraft and might do a paper on graphic narrative adaptations of Lovecraft. So I kinda need to read them to be informed and relevant.  Anything else he writes will not be getting my money anytime soon. And even then, I just read Neonomicon through the library."
GamerGhazi,3duvqv,sheriff_gingerbeard,2,Mon Jul 20 14:49:51 2015 UTC,"I honestly think Moore would see you as the perfect consumer of media then. You read some of his stuff, enjoyed it for the time and place that you were in and then moved on. I mean, the guy comes off as being really gruff sometimes but I never really see it as anything above the frustration that most people feel a lot of the time about a lot of things. It seems at times like people like Moore are outspoken simply because they did somethings that lead people to asking them questions for a very long time.   Out of interest, have you ever played Bloodborne? Some real Lovecraftian influences going on within that game, from the narrative to the thematics to how both impact the mechanics."
GamerGhazi,3duvqv,GucciJesus,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:19:36 2015 UTC,"I don't have a system that can play Bloodborne sadly, as I just invested a lot into making a good PC (not just for gaming; I use it for a lot of things, but making it play games was a nice benefit). Hopefully one day though; I've thus far only vicariously experienced it through GameGrumps. Thank you for the recommendation though, seeing someone on this board mention it as a decent game makes me far more likely to find a way to play it."
GamerGhazi,3duvqv,sheriff_gingerbeard,2,Mon Jul 20 15:26:59 2015 UTC,"I guess the easy disclaimer here is that I am a big fan of Miyasaki's work and he Souls games in particular, so I was the games target audience.  I do however know your pain, I sat there with my PC unable to play the game for a long time, saving up my pennies for a PS4. Finally got it a couple of weeks ago though. If you have the interest I can link you some good breakdowns of the Lovecraftian stuff in the game. :)"

GamerGhazi,3duvqv,EtienneZola,32,Sun Jul 19 20:59:34 2015 UTC,Moore has been barking up this tree since Watchmen. It's amusing because the state of comics has a lot to do with the fact that the industry spent about a decading misunderstanding his landmark titles and making poor imitations of it.

GamerGhazi,3duvqv,wanderingbishop,24,Mon Jul 20 07:10:44 2015 UTC,"Everyone's ragging on him, bit honestly I find myself going Team Moore on this.   There are two things to remember with Alan Moore- A) He is incredibly knowledgeable about the history of comic books, both the stories and the business. B) He is a hardcore believer in the idea that good fiction can not only entertain, it can inform, educate and inspire the imagination in all the best ways.   When he criticizes the comic book industry, I don't believe he's doing it from the position of a grumpy old man with nothing left to contribute. He knows the characters better than anyone, he defined many of the things we love about them, and he seems to believe that the current industry simply isn't doing good enough. The films especially are just broad strokes adaptions of various stories, with relatively little depth or thematic weight to give people something to chew on. I enjoyed Iron Man and the Avengers, but I can't say they gave me anything to think about. DC maybe try a little more in that regard, but they fail as often as they succeed (see Man Of Steel vs The Dark Knight).   He also has a huge axe to grind with DC and Marvel, not just for how they've screwed him over, but for how historically they screwed over a lot of the creators that made the same characters we're familiar with today. It's worth having one cultural misanthrope there ready to point out that the companies who provide us with all this superhero fiction have profited handsomely from the exploitation of their artists. If it means him grumbling every time a new superhero film comes out, I'm fine with that. He's criticizing the status quo, and should be allowed to do that, same as any critic.   It's also worth pointing out that he does put his money where his mouth is, and isn't afraid to distance himself from works that haven't aged well. He hasn't had anything nice to say about The Killing Joke for years, despite it becoming the defining Joker story and used by Warner Bros in practically anything Joker related."

From there you have to read Matt Fraction's Hawkeye run, it just wrapped up last week and you can read everything up to the 20th issue on MU. You can buy the rest of the story for $8 at your local comic shop when you're done.   Hickman's run on Avengers and New Avengers has been absolutely astounding.

My favorite arc of all time is the Alias run starring Jessica Jones from around ten or fifteen years ago, especially volume 3. The run is getting loosely adapted into a TV show by the end of the year. Find it, read every word. She's since popped up in a lot of other books, generally avengers runs, and if the show is successful she'll definitely have her own monthly again soon."

GamerGhazi,3duvqv,lalilulelo09,2,Mon Jul 20 10:37:43 2015 UTC,"I'm not actually reading a ton of stuff right now (comics are expensive), but I know plenty secondhand. From Marvel, there's stuff like Squirrel Girl, both Ms. Marvel and Captain Marvel, and the recent femThor (which kinda had the wind taken out of its sales with the Thor Secret Wars book recently, which suffers from some classic fridging) round out what Marvel's doing well as far as breaking ground. Outside of that, we're arguable in a golden age of X-Books where picking up just about any X-Men or X-Men adjacent title is a safe bet, and there's a lot of neat stuff going on with the Secret Wars event (which is more than I can usually say about comic events), and Matt Fraction's phenomenal Hawkeye just wrapped up, and even Howard the goddamn Duck has a solid solo book out atm. Meanwhile at DC, Batgirl's fantastic, Harley Quinn's solo title has been a lot better than it was circa relaunch in 2011 to the point of being great, and the recently launched Black Canary solo is strong so far and pretty promising.   I mean, I guess it's contingent on what one would consider surpassing basic escapism, but all of these stories are really fantastic, and though you could say they're either just the same or extensions of tried and true stories (which, honestly, I don't), they're all testament to the strength of the medium."

GamerGhazi,3duvqv,danharaj,11,Mon Jul 20 03:48:44 2015 UTC,"It's an entirely understandable view. In a lot of ways superhero fiction revolves around a new kind of aristocracy, people who gain the power to affect the world in ways nobody else can just because they're super. Everything BUT the superhuman receding, only rising up when some background character joins the mythos. It combines the idea of exclusivity with some tasty persecution, since nobody can possibly understand how wounded and alone our demi-god with impossible friends and limitless freedom feels.  Of course, that's not the WHOLE story, but it is most of the story. Jaime Reyes's and Kamala Khans are in short supply, and even the outer reaches like Global Frequency or The Authority suffer for their proximity to that idea.   Moore's problem with the accusations of bigotry is so obvious it hurts. It's not just the endless acclaim, it's that he's one of the OLD old pros of comicdom. Reading comic books is like reading a cloud; it's way thinner than it looks, you're through almost before you know it, the writers naturally look for any chance to punch things up and make it memorable. So it's ""just"" a story, a fiction he's been working with some other guy for months. Of course if anything was wrong, HE'd know it for sure! People who are complaining about all the rapes, thus, are JUST like the people who complain about stuff like continuity errors and demand to know when the next thing just like that unique thing he helped make is going to be done. It's thinking that all these critiques are coming from essentially the same place.  It's a shame, since I mostly know him as ""one of those guys who made Tom Strong""."

Is rape against men so much worse that you refuse to even portray it in any of your work?

GamerGhazi,3duvqv,RuncibleJones,12,Sun Jul 19 19:06:56 2015 UTC,"There's also an attempted male rape in Miracleman. A better question, though, is why Allen Moore is obsessed with including graphic rape scenes in so much of his work."

The bigger point though, is he only seems to want to show men being raped after sufficiently establishing that they deserved it (this guy is a serial rapist), there's no humiliating aftermath because the character dies, and he does his best to never actually let you see anything.  By contrast, when he has his female characters raped, it's graphic, you watch the victim the whole time, she's innocent, etc."

GamerGhazi,3duvqv,Gazelleit,3,Sun Jul 19 22:34:51 2015 UTC,"I can see where he's coming from, superheroes are esentially created as a marketing brand first, and a character second. Superheroes can only evolve in very superficial ways, since any meaninful development is wiped away to the status quo either because fans complain about it, or because the editors think that change is too confusing for their audience. Superheroes recycle stories very often, changing only minor details (how many times has Batman's origin been told already?) In general, story and character-building takes second place to action."
GamerGhazi,3duvqv,pyromancer93,2,Mon Jul 20 09:17:06 2015 UTC,"I read this when it was first published, and my first thoughts were 'Well, he has been quiet since this' followed by 'Oh shit, I hope this isn't the end of Dodgem Logic.'  Okay, so re-reading it there's three main ideas here. Superheroes are a cultural catastrophe, allegations he writes in gratuitous rape scenes and work has racist tones, to him wanting to get away from the public stage. First up, I think he's right we do have an obsession with heroes as icons. Not only do people who don't even watch the films or read the comic books able to recognize Batman when they see him, but the whole marvel/DC franchises has enough pop cultural osmosis that it's almost like a modern mythology (Like Norse/Kemetic/Greek pantheons) but while we still have all the heroes of last century, we're also making new ones and we're telling different stories with them. Before Lex Luther would be stealing forty cakes, or checking out every book in the local library with no plans to return him, now he's building doomsday devices (You can tell I don't read superman) and has love interests (pretty sure that's Fisk from dare devil I'm thinking of) and has become more well-rounded; same for every character now. We've taken them, remixed them, re-appropriated them, given them different stakes, some have new histories, others go under new names (or did viva la Oracle.) One arc that got articles analyzing it was when Superman had a realization he needed to support justice globally not just on American Soil. So the stories, stakes and ideas under the masks have all changed. But what do I know, I only read indies.  Secondly, Moore also had to ward of allegations he was writing pornography by calling one work he was doing with three female lead characters erotica. I think some of the work he's done, is why most authors use pseudonyms now just to distance themselves from the work they want to do but unsure about being known for that 'kind' of work. It does come off as unnecessary and not needed for the story, and along with this line in response to having non-white authors write on black issues: ""would appear to be predicated upon an assumption that no author or artist should presume to use characters who are of a different race to themselves"", he would have been better served as a writer if he worked alongside someone. He has a strong self-isolating streak that it's one of his features he's known for is being a hermit. The flak he gets could've not been as bad as it is, and certainly would've saved him time answering allegations if he got a second opinion on my touchy subjects. Even his self-reflective work 'Writing for Comics' (Vol.1) most of the advice especially for research is all things that could be done alone. Want an authentic surname that makes someone sounds like their from Louisiana? Check the phone book. Meanwhile, we have sites like DeviantArt and NaNoWriMo that are encouraging writing as a social activity. (NaNoWriMo is also doing their summer camp thing, includes writing for comics if you want to get in on that: https://campnanowrimo.org/sign_in ) So we're seeing the limit of how far someone can get being the lone shamanistic genius.  Third thing, most artists and writers do switch off from social media and come back recharged. We've had the likes of Neil Gaiman, Warren Ellis, and more recently Joss Wheton switch off but still keep going and I think the break's worked out for all of them. If Moore were to return to comics, I'm hoping it'd be something low-key or niche enough to give him the isolation he wants. (ie. Gazelleit really wants another issue of Dodgem Logic)"
GamerGhazi,3duvqv,IrbyTremor,2,Mon Jul 20 14:41:50 2015 UTC,"I'm wondering how new this whole ""dumbing down"" thing actually is, or if it's even specific to superheros. Weren't people saying this about the Westerns or the 80s action movies or Star Wars? Superheros are just the latest big pop culture thing that studios have latched onto.   Moore's problem has always been that he wanted to really explore the idea of superheros, but no one else ever seemed to live up to his bizarre standards. He kind of reminds me of Gore Vidal: subversive writer tied irreversibly to an establishment he would come to despise who became really bitter and hopeless in his old age."

With regards to rape, again, it's about sensitivity to the subject. People don't write about it as much because it is nearly always misrepresented by white men, particularly since they usually try to justify it somehow.  I feel that Alan Moore seems to have an immunity idol here just because of his iconic status in comics. If it were anyone else saying those things, Ghazi would rip them apart."

Engage the 'enemy' everywhere you find them, keep a veneer of civility, always get the last word. It's the same sick handbook. Doesn't matter how it's intended.  I meant what I said: if you asked a GG sealion why they were doing it you'd get an answer a lot like this."
GamerGhazi,3du248,Cielle,26,Sun Jul 19 15:48:26 2015 UTC,"That's a fair point. But one major difference, as I understand it, is that sealions engage unwilling participants in a debate, and go into spaces not at all intended for them. So entering TwoX and asking for random citations from someone who's just talking to other TwoXers is sealioning. I don't know that going onto a Youtube channel where someone is instigating a GG debate, and countering their claims with your own arguments that are carefully constructed, is the same thing. One is being obtrusive and dressing it up in false civility. What Innuendo Studios is saying is when these debates are being brought up, enter the debate and make your points. Don't force unwilling participants to debate you by harassing them. Don't act like you're ""just asking for some evidence."" Just debate politely where there is a debate to be held.  I don't actually know if this is a real difference or I'm just giving a kind reading to someone I support. I might be misguided here, and am happy to hear arguments against my reasoning."

Consider how GGers treat it as 'instigating a debate' whenever feminism is brought up anywhere. Consider how every additional unwanted reply is viewed not as being remotely harassing, but as furthering a 'debate' the other party started. Ask yourself, with cold honesty, whether your criteria are any different when someone starts spouting off about how Sarkeesian Is The Devil or whatever.

GamerGhazi,3du248,Safgaftsa,13,Sun Jul 19 20:09:37 2015 UTC,"Well I mean, I don't really see where the video encourages people to ""pester"" Angry Jack, but to talk to him instead of screaming at him or ignoring him. You can talk to someone without harassing, abusing, stalking, etc. GG'ers can talk to feminists (theoretically); what's objectionable is that GG'ers have horrible opinions, don't go away when you tell them to, and then go back to their buddies and encourage them to send you messages calling you all sorts of fun names.  If all GG'ers did was respond to a feminist, get told to fuck off, and then indeed fuck off, then it wouldn't be a problem.   If anti-GG'ers started going in and repeatedly trying to engage GG'ers who don't want to debate then yeah, we would be acting like assholes and hypocrites. And now that I think of it, there was that little bit in the video where he characterized GG'ers as always wanting the last word, and ""us"" pulling them back into the argument by calling them bad people. But I read that part as being less about us literally refusing to leave GG'ers alone and more that GG'ers tend to make grand pronouncements and then are shocked when someone actually responds."

GamerGhazi,3du248,thecarebearcares,5,Sun Jul 19 21:42:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah from discussions I've had with GG'ers it's pretty obvious that this is what the video's referring to. Every time they post a link and some vague butchered context or outright lie it's pretty clearly intended to be some sort of mic drop moment that proves forever that these people/sites they hate are bad. When you call that out it breaks their smug security and they scramble for another ""incriminating"" statement to post (until the point where they usually get caught in some loop of reposting debunked stuff or calling you an Aggro shill or cuck or whatever).

GamerGhazi,3dt032,dirtyrogue,35,Sun Jul 19 04:11:01 2015 UTC,"This is why I haven't stopped going here yet. I've got to remain aware of the actual stakes.  For me, this isn't about gamergate's credibility or the upcoming airplay thing or the fucking sarkeesian effect. This is about women feeling safe online, and people being able to express political opinions or just being pissed off with someone without being mobbed by a bunch of people threatening to rape them and kill them.  You see, I have a luxury. Most of us on this subreddit do. Whenever the fuck we feel like it, we can just unplug, close the browser, take some meds or play some games or get pizza, and cool off. And when we log back on, most of the time, we'll be just fine. No big raids, nothing.  You know who doesn't have that luxury? /u/zoequinn . Anita Sarkeesian. /u/SpaceKatGal . /u/freebsdgirl . The very woman who wrote this article. Why? Because they're women who got unlucky. Who ran afoul of this group of bullshitters simply through existing or through spreading a meme or making a tool to save other people.  Do you realize, right now, how fortunate you are, that you, random ghazi user who is reading this right now, CAN log off and not have 50 billion notifications in your inbox in 5 minutes? I fucking do. Right now, I could leave reddit and go watch aarava play f1 2015 for an hour and not come back to hundreds of messages in my inbox telling me to die, without some troll calling my phone and telling me I'm mentally disabled because I'm a feminist man, without someone sending the FUCKING COPS to my house on a mission to find some hostages that some asshole lied about just because he thinks it's fucking hilarious.  I recognize I have that privilege. That luxury. Do you? Do the people on here still recognize that? Because, I think it's important to recognize that. It might not be lulzy, it might not be sargon osis of liver drunkenly ranting about feminist illuminati, but it's important. It's serious. It matters.  Sometimes, on here, it seems like people forget that. Well, I'm not going to forget that. Are you?"
GamerGhazi,3dt032,Racecarlock,10,Sun Jul 19 06:14:35 2015 UTC,"Just gonna chime in to add: notice how pretty much everyone forgets anyone of color that's been hurt and driven out when listing the victims? The people who've just quit and not made their life into the unholy hell people like me have by fighting back? They don't even have the luxury of being remembered, or the luxury of people usually acknowledging that that's a luxury in and of itself :(   People also seem to forget that everyone other than me also seems to have the luxury of GamerGate not being rooted in an act of domestic violence against them, and I try to keep saying this because of the alarmingly high percentage of Crash Override cases we get in where it starts with ""I was dating this person and then...""  But yeah. Thanks for remembering that for some of us, GamerGate will literally never be over. Being targeted for mob harassment like this is like turning some of the worst moments in your life into a snowglobe and being forced to live in it."
GamerGhazi,3dt032,zoequinn,3,Sun Jul 19 20:08:04 2015 UTC,Sometimes I feel like our subreddit has forgotten this to an extent.
GamerGhazi,3dt032,Racecarlock,2,Mon Jul 20 03:15:12 2015 UTC,"It's a difficult balance, remembering the victims besides the biggest names while also protecting them from further harassment. Just chronicling them in a place GGers could see got them a new wave of harassment, which is why the sub stopped."
GamerGhazi,3dt032,Ayasugi-san,12,Mon Jul 20 06:52:45 2015 UTC,"This is about women feeling safe online   That's even understating it. You don't even have to be a woman, or say anything in particular to piss anyone off to be at risk of being swatted. Anyone with a public profile can be a victim of swatting or similar threats. Or even have no public profile at all, but have the wrong person find out your personal info. Streamers are particularly at risk because you have these people who want to see the cops storm the house live on camera. It's an incredibly easy thing to do and get away with, as well.  People are really unaware of how much harassment and swatting and shit is actually going on out there, because people don't publicize it for fear of attracting more of it. Particularly if you're active in the gaming community. Get any decent sized number of followers and you're going to be the victim of attempted swatting, stalking, harassment, and death threats.   For every Brianna Wu that has come forward with the threats they've received, there are a dozen or more others who we've either not heard of, or who have simply kept their harassment under wraps. Many prominent gaming figures work for large companies whose legal teams encourage them not to publicize threats.  Swatting is a huge issue: Easy to commit, easy to get away with, incredibly dangerous, and completely not taken seriously by law enforcement. And law enforcement won't address the problem until there are bodies."
GamerGhazi,3dt032,Sentrus,3,Sun Jul 19 07:17:54 2015 UTC,"I agree with you. I want everyone(especially women since it;s a lot worse for them) to be able to express their political opinions  on certain subjects without getting doxxed, harassed and etc.  I can not wait for that day to come.

In fact, sitting here typing this in 2 minutes in my underwear I've come up with a better solution. Give mods a tool that they can outright prevent users subscribed to subs of their choosing from posting at all in the forum they moderate, and/or disallow posts from people who have posted to those blackballed subs within the past 3 days. Force the blackballed subs to be displayed prominently on the sidebar so all users can see exactly which ones are never allowed.   Wow BeerandCheese, did you just completely prevent all possible acts of hate brigading from ever happening? Why yes, yes I believe you did. Hire me to run reddit, me and my underwear are ready."

I can't think of a worse way less effective way to drive traffic/advertise to hate subs than saying ""if you go here, you will not be allowed back, period"".  And really, is that bad anyway. If someone is swayed to go over to one of those subs simply because they saw it under a banned list, good riddance to that asshole. That person can enjoy posting hate in their own shitty little sub and be banned from everywhere else.  Edited two words to be a bit clearer."
GamerGhazi,3dqlfm,_BeerAndCheese_,8,Sat Jul 18 19:28:43 2015 UTC,"I think for something like Ghazi it might make sense, but maybe not the more general subreddits, some of which are like the front page of Reddit. ""Oh, there's a sub for people who hate blacks? Well, why bother with this general news stuff? I'll just go there!""  At least not from Reddit's perspective since they obviously don't want to call attention to all the shit they host.  Furthermore, some people might also not be comfortable having such things listed in their sidebar, subreddit names which contain racist/homophobic/misogynistic slurs etc. Some people seek out places where they can just entirely escape from that.  Maybe it could be an option for the subreddit to enable or disable as they see fit. Or a user setting."
GamerGhazi,3dqlfm,Nasharchy,2,Sat Jul 18 19:49:37 2015 UTC,Couldn't they just put it under a rules tab? That way you can see what is banned but don't have to be reminded it exist constantly? (First reddit post ever and it's about racism /sigh)
GamerGhazi,3dqlfm,_BeerAndCheese_,7,Sat Jul 18 22:48:25 2015 UTC,Reddit â Come for the racism. Stay for the... racism?

I think you could either make it so the BANNED SUBS header has a link that you click to see, or just a menu of the names that pops up when you mouse over them. Hidden to those who don't want to see it, available for easy viewing for the rest.  I think you're spot on that you wouldn't be able to implement something like that on the defaults. The rest though? I think that'd work just fine, even the larger subs. And subs wouldn't even have to use it (the larger ones probably wouldn't anyway, too many people throwing riots over peaches), just to have as an option. I think it would take care of many of the problems with reddit, simply and easily.  There would be downsides, like that you mention of course, but that's the case with anything you do."

GamerGhazi,3dqlfm,Nasharchy,6,Sun Jul 19 03:03:00 2015 UTC,"Reddit has a board, they pushed for a full purge. Ellen Pao refused. Alexis Ohanian refused. All of the people even remotely involved with Reddit administration are advising the board not to clean up Reddit.  Your idea is a good one but it needs to be something hidden. Sort of like a board-wide shadowban moderators can use against problem communities. Identities are cheap on Reddit, so you can't let people know they've been restricted or they'll just register more.  My personal opinion is that this solution (both the current new policy and your proposal) would have been great... three years ago when these subs were only a small portion of the site. Containment does not work when the hatred has metastasized into the whole community, to the point where I can't really tell the difference between a default-browser and actual racists. They could have headed this off in the past, but Reddit administration is anything but proactive and they lost the chance(s) to intervene where it would have counted."

I haven't seen the presentation, but I recognize the beard.  Rami's idea is Developer's can't go about games the same way gamers can. We can't for instance play games for hours every day, and expect ourselves to still produce something. We don't have the luxury of time, and being good at games doesn't transfer as being good at making them. You can watch the trailer footage of Fallout 3 when it was just the developer's playing it, they mocked for a bit sucking at their own game but it got critical acclaim. I think he was getting at less about toxicity and snobbery than, there's differences between what developers and gamers want. Personal point, I'd say is virtually every review on steam now for any game says 'buy it on sale' but it's something that usually goes without saying Steam has sales all the time, and the wishlist and email notifications helps points when games are on sale. Developers want money to eat at the end of the month, but gamers want games to be under a dollar. As an example of difference."

There's a similar sentiment I can pick up on art magazines and sites like Creative Bloq, with their advice of don't follow trends.

GamerGhazi,3drd9o,Caelrie,12,Sat Jul 18 19:31:48 2015 UTC,"This isn't something that you choose, either. Working on games for any length of time changes your perception of them. If a game is really exceptional and tightly constructed you can get away from it a little (off the top of my head, I'm thinking of portal, dishonored, and electronic superjoy), but eventually you do start seeing the strings, especially when you've done QA or level design. Or if you start recognizing the ""default"" parts of an engine (the default unity blue, some unreal engine assets that come with UDK, etc.), that's what really kills immersion for me.  On the other hand, it can make otherwise frustrating bad games kind of fun to play. I just finished fallout new vegas for the first time and that game is still buggy as hell, but it was fun to play because the way that the game breaks really invites you to examine the systems that exist within it and how they work so you can fix them. There's also a development studio that I follow simply because they make inferior versions of games I actually really love, and I feel like I have more tolerance for their stuff because I have game dev experience and have studied it academically."

Being a developer changes your perspective. It doesn't make gaming any less enjoyable, but...  ... okay, you know the feeling of doing research on a subject you really enjoy? Like, when you get caught going through a series of related wiki articles, or when you get stuck on TVTropes? That's partly how I feel about games.  It's actually, in a weird way, more enjoyable. I can still enjoy the story and the graphics, but there's this additional pull of ""how did they do this"" and ""why did they do that"". For a truly well made game, something like Dark Souls, going analytical on it and discovering that the devs have already thought of everything you're trying can genuinely improve the experience."

Film Crit Hulk had a good write-up on that in terms of the different levels of media criticism (specifically focusing on film): http://badassdigest.com/2013/06/05/film-crit-hulk-smash-hulk-vs.-spoilers-and-the-4-levels-of-how-we-consume-a/  And it shows that making film puts you on a level even beyond people who've spent a lot of time analyzing it without actually making it. I'm not a filmmaker, but I do write and compose music, and I agree that once you start creating it yourself you see it on a whole new level beyond just being a fan of it.  It's probably not something that ""just fans"" want to hear, Gamergate or otherwise. But it's the truth."
GamerGhazi,3drd9o,GearyDigit,8,Mon Jul 20 05:31:33 2015 UTC,"Being a creator in an artform sorta ruins your ability to enjoy it the way you did before you became a creator. You break things down even when you're trying to just turn off your brain and enjoy something mindless, you notice glaring errors and obsess over how they could have been best resolved, you find it harder and harder to get immersed in a story because you keep getting pulled out by analyzing it on a technical basis. It's like having Superman's version of X-Ray vision and never being able to turn it off."

I don't play now as much as I like, but anytime I hear a song on the radio, my mind instantly starts trying to break down the music into its constituent chord sequences, time signatures and melodies. I still enjoy it, because it's a great mental exercise trying to rebuild the mechanics of a song in your own head, but it does also change how I listen to music compared to other people."

Much of their outrage stems from an assuption that ""SJWs' are an outside force pressuring developers to make games the way they want.   Developers are not gamers, they are people with jobs, making many different choices for a variety of reasons, playing the end product does not mean you have any magical insight into the world of the creators."

GamerGhazi,3drd9o,Doldenberg,1 point,Sun Jul 19 08:51:07 2015 UTC,"I think the general point is well made, when you begin creating something, your mindset is changing and you can't really go back to ""just"" being a consumer. On the other hand, I think the whole ""You can hate games and still make them"" is taking it to far. (Assuming we talk about ""games"" as the art form itself; not what actual games exist right now.)

GamerGhazi,3drd9o,ListenAndBelieve,2,Sun Jul 19 09:00:39 2015 UTC,"Honestly, with the way some Gamers have been acting these past months, I don't blame them. They want to carry on creating games, of course, but they don't want to be lumped in with that shitty crowd."
GamerGhazi,3drd9o,gdshaffe,3,Sun Jul 19 10:30:00 2015 UTC,"It shows how ignorant GG is of game development that they would consider that statement to be at all controversial.  In other words, they show exactly the level of ignorance that is to be predicted of them.  Being a gamer means you play almost nothing but awesome games.  If you come across a game that isn't awesome, you set it aside and move on.  Being a developer means you play the same shitty game, over and over, obsessing about tiny details, little things that could be improved, for months at a time.  You're not appreciating the majesty of the forest as a whole because you're inspecting each individual tree for rot under a microscope.  Then when the game finally becomes not-shitty and maybe kind of great, you release it and move on to your next product."
GamerGhazi,3drd9o,BluePumpkin7,4,Sun Jul 19 12:04:12 2015 UTC,"I guess all this slide does is show some inherent game design flaws, it's somewhat the developers fault that gaming actually needs a label.

GamerGhazi,3drd9o,KarateSquids,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:17:50 2015 UTC,"There's some truth to Rami's speech certainly, and I think GG has painted him as a target because he sees their bullshit for what it is and doesn't pander to them.  I remember a twitter exchange between him and GG essentially boiling down to them saying ""Well, we will boycott your games, there's thousands of us, and you're throwing money away"" and him saying ""I don't care. I will not change my games or my beliefs for you and my company will be just fine.""  In other words, he's successful. He doesn't need to pander to consumers. They have no power over him.  Customers? Sure. Feedback is great from your customers. But again, it doesn't mean as a creator you agree, or that it would be good for the game.   I particularly liked his observation that the audience has been taught to believe that it's easy to make games - the mo-cap section was brilliant. If I were GG, I'd listen to that a few times and try and understand it.  As to whether developers are still gamers. I think that's an interesting idea. I certainly look at and notice how games have been constructed far more since I started making games. You can't help it.  It doesn't make me less excited for Fallout 4, or Xcom 2, or Deus Ex. So normally I'd say 'Yeah, I'm still a gamer'  And then I remember GG. And I'm actually happy to not be associated  with that particular label anymore.  Which is very, very sad :("
GamerGhazi,3drd9o,kmeisthax,0,Sun Jul 19 10:27:04 2015 UTC,"I'm not surprised GG is more actively hating on ""pretentious indie developers"" given that the whole basis of their little campaign is pushing gaming back 10 years where games were ranked on zero out of ten fun units, independent game development was impossible (console) or heavily discouraged (PC), and the Nintendo Wii never happened.  Speaking of the latter, if you scroll down the reblog chain you'll notice some ace quotemining of dearly departed Nintendo CEO Satoru Iwata. A while ago he said something like ""On my business card, I'm the corporate president; but in my heart I'm a gamer"".  It's incredibly insensitive to quotemine the thoughts of a dead Japanese game programmer for the purpose of creating propaganda for your white supremacist movement composed of videogame players. Especially when it's the same people who go on 4chan to make fun of Nintendo being ""for casuals"" while finding new ways to swap around Ls and Rs in ""Please understand"" and ""Do you like it""."

I'd be disipointed if TB didn't make the group fourms private soon as there's ALOT of hate being generated there and since it's his fourms he's responsible.

Same thing with the fov slider, singleplayer games usually involve a very forward experience, having periphral vision won't help you shit, and it's more comforting to your eyes if you are further away because things seem much closer. If you play competitive CS or something, yes, you should have 60 fps and at least 90 fov, because there every bit helps, but for a casual gaming experience, all of that stuff is completly unnecesary and just personal preference, it's the same as if i would not buy a game because they have windowed fullscreen, it's a nice feature but it's not absolutely necessary for the typical gamer."
GamerGhazi,3dq2si,Venomer,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:20:09 2015 UTC,"There is more to having a high FPS than having a millisecond faster response time.  The bigger problem in games like battlefield is that if you are averaging 30FPS cruising around in a buggy then when the shit hits the fan and buildings are exploding and stuff is flying everywhere your framerate is probably going to bottom out, leaving you unable to respond at all. There is a lot more going on in a 64-player round of battlefield than there ever was in counter-strike (a much wider variety of threats that can hit you from a much wider range of distances and angles), and the players are just as competitive. There's nothing special about professional counter-strike players that makes them more deserving of a decent framerate.  Of course if 'locking' to 30FPS meant keeping it at 30 even under stress, that could be fine. But I've only ever seen it as a limiter."

GamerGhazi,3dq2si,myGGthrowaway,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:45:54 2015 UTC,"Sure. And the one capped at 30fps might be a classic, and the one at 60fps might be a stinker.  I personally don't see it as a deciding factor. You do. I don't think we're going to go much further are we? :)"
GamerGhazi,3dq2si,KarateSquids,3,Sat Jul 18 16:53:57 2015 UTC,I mean the same thing is true of any feature. Devs provide all sorts of info on features. Why can't we have ways to easily know about this feature many gamers do care about?
GamerGhazi,3dq2si,myGGthrowaway,2,Sat Jul 18 18:06:27 2015 UTC,"I personally don't see it as a deciding factor. You do.   The existence of the information makes no difference to you either way, and it makes a difference to the other guy. So why not have it up front?"
GamerGhazi,3dq2si,lustophile,0,Sun Jul 19 11:22:41 2015 UTC,"Because, honestly, the way that the information is being used and presented is just incredibly negative right now, intentionally or not.  What if, instead of the comment 'Locked at 30fps' for a game (which I believe is all he adds to the comments on the game, certainly in the case of GoD) you instead said 'Runs at 30fps'.  Or why not curate games that do run at 60fps?  It tells the user the same information, but feels less loaded, doesn't it? Again, for someone supposedly smart, TB's use of words can be really dumb.  I don't know what else to tell you. It's become, intentionally or not, another useful thing that is being used (imho) in a negative way.   It's not a sign of game quality overall, and when you can get refunds, at the end of the day, why insist on negativity when you could do it, if you felt that you had to, more positively?"
GamerGhazi,3dq2si,KarateSquids,-3,Sun Jul 19 12:34:40 2015 UTC,"They shouldn't be trying to in the first place. Is it really so much to ask that devs be required to be more specific about the limits of their games. A screen shot of the options menu, frame limits, etc. shouldn't be information people have to hunt for."
GamerGhazi,3dq2si,CaptainBenza,10,Sat Jul 18 15:24:33 2015 UTC,"You're framing it as 30fps = bad (a 'limit') 60fps = good  Which is exactly the way TB's framing it, intentionally or not.  For someone who deals in words, TB is incredibly ignorant of their power. Or, you know, the other perhaps less flattering option.  It's just not a metric that applies equally to all game types, nor does it affect every person.   If I want to please the PC crowd, maybe I should just focus on making Twine games? They should run at 60fps just fine, right?  How about instead of focussing on 'limits' and 'policing' game developers, TB focusses on championing those that do run at 60FPS and benefit from it.   Make it a positive instead of a negative?"
GamerGhazi,3dq2si,KarateSquids,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:48:20 2015 UTC,"I think they shouldn't be labeling anything as good or bad. I think the real think people should be championing is ""more information."" Devs should be jumping on uh opportunity to say ""hey, here is everything about our game, we don't think anything we decided is worth hiding."" In the current gaming industry which is full of dishonesty, I don't understand why people wouldn't be all for more transparency between devs and players. We don't have to label any options good or bad, it should just be the standard that everyone be open about what's there. I don't think anyone should be getting harassed no matter what, and I definitely think people over react to small things, but that doesn't mean the idea of developers being open about their games is bad."
GamerGhazi,3dq2si,CaptainBenza,4,Sat Jul 18 16:02:35 2015 UTC,"I think they shouldn't be labeling anything as good or bad.   I believe you. But your previous response was:   Is it really so much to ask that devs be required to be more specific about the limits of their games.   (emphasis mine)  Consciously or subconsciously TB is helping to stigmatise any developer that runs a game at less than 60fps  I think your first quoted reply doesn't exactly sit well with your second.   I don't think developers are hiding anything. Seriously. I get that trust is hard to get these days (I'm still fuming about Colonial Marines, believe me).  But you get a video. You get screenshots. If you're lucky, you get a demo.   You can make an informed choice. And now, if your informed choice turns out to be a bad one, you get a refund, no questions asked. (which wasn't the case with Colonial Marines, but consumers took Sega to court over that! Yay consumers!).  Please don't assume (and I'm not saying you are) that all developers are scheming money grabbing bastards trying to dupe people. There are people like that (and Jim Sterling and others have done well to call some of this out) but their days are numbered now that you can get a refund.  The consumer's won. Yay!"
GamerGhazi,3dq2si,KarateSquids,2,Sat Jul 18 16:35:29 2015 UTC,"A refund to store credit. Still money out of pocket if you don't want a 30fps game.   I remember buying Divinity 2. Got to the main menu and instantly groaned. The menu was running at 30 fps. And yes, it's noticeable as hell. I was supremely delighted when the actual game had a ton of frame rate option so I could cap it with v sync. Or indeed just uncsp it.   I also remember buying Dead Space and seeing that v sync capped at 30. So I disabled it, along with the heinous mouse smoothing and capped it at 60 from my nvidia panel instead.   So, morale is: options are good. Information is also good. 30fps is very noticeable. Especially when you remove the godawful motion blur they so often use to mask it and make everything look like soup."
GamerGhazi,3dq2si,Stellar_Duck,0,Sat Jul 18 17:37:28 2015 UTC,"I don't think limits implies bad, but they are limits. Not having XYZ options is a limitation of your games options. If that's the design decision you made, that's fine. It's for the gamer to decide if those things are good or bad to them regarding that game.!  I don't there should be a ""if we're lucky."" It should just be standard for devs to take the 10 minute to write down those things about their game. For the good devs, that shouldn't be a problem. For the devs that feel they have something to hide, that should be exposed or people should ask ""hey, everyone else is living up to the transparency standard, why isn't this dev?""   I don't think the days of youtubers are numbered. People will always want the opinions of reviewers they trust. They may not be perfect, but they're trying to make this industry better like all of us wish we had the power to try to do. Let's not hate them for that.  I don't think the consumers have won. I think we're a long way off. As long there is distrust between devs and gamers, as long as dishonesty and broken promises are such a big part of the industry we're a long way off from having the ideal we want. One day I think we can get there, and the first step is saying that we want to be informed."
GamerGhazi,3dq2si,CaptainBenza,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:53:27 2015 UTC,"Please forgive the brevity of this reply, but I have to go do other things!  I think consumers have won (on Steam anyway) because even with cases of dishonesty and broken promises, they lose nothing but the time to download and try a game.  If you don't like the latest hyped up game that looked good in screenshots and videos but turned out to be crap, you get your money back.  I can't put it more plainly.   So you get your money back. You might see a game that is 60fps and download it because it looks good. And it plays awful.  You might get a game that's locked at 30fps and it's beautiful and engaging and everything you want despite being locked at 30fps. And vice versa of course.  So what is the point of the label? It's not an indicator of quality, surely?   Ok, gotta run - but thanks for the discussion!"
GamerGhazi,3dq2si,KarateSquids,3,Sat Jul 18 17:05:20 2015 UTC,Gamers are garbage.
GamerGhazi,3dq2si,khantron,2,Sat Jul 18 14:17:32 2015 UTC,"Making a curator list for games that run on 60+FPS? A good-ish idea.  Making a curator list for games that run on 30-FPS while having a fanbase that you have trained to get angry at 30FPS-locks because reasons, knowing some will get pitchforks and torches and on to witchhunt? Not the brightest idea."
GamerGhazi,3dq2si,LostmanX,2,Sat Jul 18 18:39:36 2015 UTC,The vast majority of games on steam can run on 60fps.  Making a list of them instead of ones that are 30fps would be a titanic undertaking
GamerGhazi,3dq2si,Simiantron,0,Sat Jul 18 19:12:03 2015 UTC,"Neither would be necessary, but the two better solutions are out. Just using tags? Banned. Developers taking the 10 minute to list options and technical details of their games. Nobody does it. We shouldn't have to have something like the curator list, but it's because developers and valve want to hinder us from being informed consumers, instead of helping us, that we're here.   And as far as pitchforks go, I think the main reason that 30FPS has such a bad reputation is from years of dishonesty as well. Nobody just wants to admit that they made a game that doesn't run 60FPS. They have to say things like ""it's a more cinematic experience,"" or make excuses like ""the human eye can't even tell the difference."" 30FPS has its place and isn't inherently indicative of a poor game, but Is it really all the surprising that it's become associated with mountains of bullshit?"
GamerGhazi,3dq2si,CaptainBenza,8,Sat Jul 18 19:49:20 2015 UTC,what difference does fps lock make?
GamerGhazi,3dq2si,newl-a,27,Sat Jul 18 13:09:08 2015 UTC,"A lot of people like the way 60fps looks and some will even swear up and down that 30fps is unwatchable and gives them tummy-aches.  But the real source of anger is that there's sort of a conspiracy theory floating around that devs are deliberately hobbling their PC releases as some sort of quid pro quo with the companies that make consoles in order to keep consoles competitive in the market.  It doesn't help that a certain ""youtube personalities"" has a very naive view of what goes into programming a video game, and has basically given his viewers the impression that moving from 30 to 60 fps is as simple as flipping a switch."
GamerGhazi,3dq2si,YRUasking,6,Sat Jul 18 13:33:55 2015 UTC,"oh I see, ok um followup question, what actual visual difference does it make?  also are games from a certain era all 30 fps or under? ?"
GamerGhazi,3dq2si,newl-a,9,Sat Jul 18 13:35:55 2015 UTC,"You can see for yourself if there's a difference, I definitely can see it: http://30vs60.com  Earlier games from the late 80s to early 00s were mostly 60fps, around the ps2 era, especially with big games like GTA3 they started to lock to 30 because they wanted to save processing power to draw more stuff, and as photorealism became more important developers started locking a lot of their games to 30fps in order to make things look as good as possible. So 30fps basically became the standard for the ps3/360 generation."
GamerGhazi,3dq2si,YRUasking,3,Sat Jul 18 13:40:06 2015 UTC,"I don't want to seem like ""that guy"", but I can see the difference, and 60fps looks a lot better, imho.  That said, 30fps certainly aren't unplayable, but 60fps is a nice feature that makes sense for some games. I just can't wait until we ascend to glorious 120fps."
GamerGhazi,3dq2si,_rhetz_,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:24:55 2015 UTC,"lol, that's the first time I've ever seen that comparison website and 60fps makes me quesy.   I am genetically predisposed to be a peasant. Clearly."
GamerGhazi,3dq2si,blahblahwordvomit,-1,Sat Jul 18 16:13:25 2015 UTC,the main difference i can see is that 60fps is slightly darker?
GamerGhazi,3dq2si,newl-a,15,Sat Jul 18 13:44:41 2015 UTC,Some see it. Some don't.  I certainly don't see it.  Someone should set up a blind test at some point with examples like that from games. I'd probably end up guessing right maybe 60% of the time. Some people would almost certainly get it right 90%+ of the time though.
GamerGhazi,3dq2si,Meneth,2,Sat Jul 18 14:00:46 2015 UTC,"theres a really easy to see comparison somewhere with a fast moving Dot, i can't remember the url."
GamerGhazi,3dq2si,Omicron0,0,Sat Jul 18 14:50:21 2015 UTC,"When movement is very fast, and no motion blur is used, it is usually pretty easy to see, yes.  That situation doesn't really happen all that often in games though."
GamerGhazi,3dq2si,Meneth,2,Sat Jul 18 14:55:15 2015 UTC,Motionblur is aN awful awful thing though.
GamerGhazi,3dq2si,Stellar_Duck,2,Sat Jul 18 17:41:02 2015 UTC,Depends on how severe it is. Very slight motion blur can make things look a lot smoother.
GamerGhazi,3dq2si,Meneth,2,Sat Jul 18 17:43:06 2015 UTC,"true, only really happens in fps or tps games when you do a fast camera movement. Dark souls especially would've been better at 60fps, Gehrman is incredibly fast, he moves like a super saiyan at 30fps."
GamerGhazi,3dq2si,Omicron0,-1,Sat Jul 18 15:01:49 2015 UTC,the fire is a different color umm the one on the left which is 30 fps i guess? is pinker and the one on the right is more red?   that would b a fun expiriment
GamerGhazi,3dq2si,newl-a,6,Sat Jul 18 14:04:21 2015 UTC,"There should be no colour difference, it would only affect the fluidity of motion."
GamerGhazi,3dq2si,WhatABiscuit,3,Sat Jul 18 14:21:42 2015 UTC,devs are deliberately hobbling their PC releases as some sort of quid pro quo with the companies that make consoles in order to keep consoles competitive in the market.   I don't think intent is sinister but don't they have console parity contracts ? Like I know a lot of multiplats say they need to do that. And they can't disclose the details of these contracts so devs get really evasive/vague when asked if there are enhancements for pc users.  I know there was a Ubisoft dev who admitted some of the graphical enhancements were removed from the pc version for console parity. (Users made mods to add them back in.)
GamerGhazi,3dq2si,myGGthrowaway,8,Sat Jul 18 15:33:25 2015 UTC,"It's a turn-based card roguelike, does it really need 60 FPS? Does any game really? I just turn my resolution to the lowest  setting, and then turn all the graphics options up to it's highest. Bam, look at those ultra-frothy graphics. Better than Gameboy colour! All the graphics, all the performance, not even caring about frame rates."
GamerGhazi,3dq2si,Gazelleit,16,Sat Jul 18 15:38:26 2015 UTC,"60fps is not an ""objective improvement"" because not everyone notices/cares. If you wanted to prove it was an ""objective improvement"" then you'd need to do some sort of massive double-blind study in which people play/rate various games in 30/60 fps modes."
GamerGhazi,3dq2si,safewoodchipper,12,Sat Jul 18 12:11:13 2015 UTC,A lot of people can't tell the difference between 720p and 1080p on a normal sized tv. It doesn't mean that image quality in 1080 is not objectively better. Similarly video quality at 60fps is better than 30fps.
GamerGhazi,3dq2si,myGGthrowaway,-1,Sat Jul 18 15:53:46 2015 UTC,"but if people don't notice it then it's not actually better, the quality and the experience would be effectively the same."
GamerGhazi,3dq2si,safewoodchipper,8,Sat Jul 18 18:01:23 2015 UTC,"video quality is not equal to experience. You might have more fun watching Avatar on dvd rather than blu-ray , but that doesn't mean dvd has better video quality than bluray."
GamerGhazi,3dq2si,myGGthrowaway,-2,Sat Jul 18 18:08:50 2015 UTC,"well now we're just making an equivocation error. If the quality of the video exceeds the resolution of the human eye, then effectively the quality is not actually better."
GamerGhazi,3dq2si,safewoodchipper,7,Sat Jul 18 18:19:20 2015 UTC,I went from playing Shadows of Mordor on PS4 which it's solid locked 30 to a locked 60 on a friends PC and I never noticed any of the hooha that people shout about!   The only time I ever noticed a huge difference in Frame Rate was going from Wrath of the Lamb to Rebirth! Rebirth makes me feel sick!
GamerGhazi,3dq2si,The_69_Eyes,5,Sat Jul 18 13:53:23 2015 UTC,oh really? I actually liked rebirth better because it never slowed down on my computer and consistently stayed at the same speed. What made you sick about it?
GamerGhazi,3dq2si,safewoodchipper,4,Sat Jul 18 18:07:48 2015 UTC,The smoothness of it honestly! It seems like it's running three times the speed it should and it fucks with my brain space!
GamerGhazi,3dq2si,The_69_Eyes,8,Sat Jul 18 19:01:41 2015 UTC,"Even if people don't notice it doesn't mean it isn't objectively better. Most people probably cant tell the difference between 18 karat and 24 karat gold, but that doesn't mean 24 karat isn't objectively better."
GamerGhazi,3dq2si,Simiantron,19,Sat Jul 18 12:46:01 2015 UTC,"24 karat gold is objectively worse in many ways, specifically for wear resistance.  Gold is frankly too soft for jewelry which is worn daily, which is why alloys are used."
GamerGhazi,3dq2si,IllusionOfYouth,13,Sat Jul 18 13:20:59 2015 UTC,"It... Kind of does mean it isn't objectively better? Like, the only objective thing is that it has more karats. By that logic a rabbit is objectively better than 24k gold."
GamerGhazi,3dq2si,ChicaneryBear,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:09:49 2015 UTC,"I feel thats a bad comparison somehow  probably because you can't sell fps for money? the first part of the comparison works, people can't tell the difference between the two, the second part doesn't really work in my mind because you can't sell fps like you can sell gold?"
GamerGhazi,3dq2si,newl-a,5,Sat Jul 18 13:18:29 2015 UTC,"Well I mean 24 karat gold is purer than a lower karat, and 60fps is smoother than 30fps.  Any drawbacks from 60fps aren't from the increased smoothness, they're from the game not being built to work at that high a framerate.  If the game can work at 60fps with no physics problems or whatever then it is objectively better than 30fps."
GamerGhazi,3dq2si,Simiantron,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:35:41 2015 UTC,oohh I guessss
GamerGhazi,3dq2si,newl-a,0,Sat Jul 18 13:43:18 2015 UTC,"my contention here is that ""better"" doesn't necessarily mean ""more,"" as what qualifies as ""better"" is subjective in the first place."

GamerGhazi,3dq2si,TehNeko1,19,Sat Jul 18 10:32:40 2015 UTC,Also they don't allow it because the tags are supposed to be about genre not the specs of the game. That more something for reviews and forums posts.

If he is outraged then it's the same as him saying you should be outraged. Don't try to pretend otherwise.  It's a big fault in his reviews really.

I think he understands people can have a difference of opinion.  Some things are a huge problem for Totalbiscuit . Games with an overly restrictive FOV,  games capped at 30fps, games without graphics customization options . I think he understands that people can have different opinions on those things than him.  I don't get outraged because a reviewer has a different opinion than me."

GamerGhazi,3dq2si,khantron,-2,Sat Jul 18 20:12:53 2015 UTC,"let the community decide things   It's an objective fact though. It doesn't come off as negative as a curator made to police games that have a forced framerate. How could the community even abuse that anyway? Aside from tagging games that it doesn't apply to, but that can be said about any of the other tags.   Is 30 fps unplayable? I thought it was just some pcmr bullshit that only bothers people for 20 minutes.   I personally tend to feel nauseous playing most kind of games at 30fps and the same is true for a lot of people."

He openly acknowledges that he has this influence and that people respond to what he says.  And yet for some reason when you don't apply that to a game, but rather apply that to a person, he pretend like he has just no idea that people would behave in the exact same way they behave when he's talking about games.  OWN your influence, jackass.  You demand other people do it, we'll you're not immune either."

GamerGhazi,3dq2si,Plan6,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:27:22 2015 UTC,"According to him, the curator's name is just a joke. Some people have already managed to take it too far.   Kinda like PCMR and how it went from a sarcastic reference to SRS BZNS/religion.   Guild of Dungeoneering is a turn based card game that runs at 30 FPS and would receive no conceivable benefit from a higher framerate.   I have this game on my radar and I'm really actually very surprised that anyone would care about the frames in this one so long as they don't drop below 30.  It's not an action game or anything of the sort, it's not a shootmans game where it matters.  Why does anyone give a shit?  It would be like someone caring if a game like FTL was frame-locked at 30.   Personally, I'm still waiting for this guy to realize that his fanbase is full of impressionable kids and young adults who take everything he says literally.   I wanna say that I hope he realizes that these same jerkoffs represent that same abusive mentality of GG and that he would use this to offer a deeper critique on the toxicity in gaming culture...  But I am perhaps cynical and think that he wouldn't risk putting his brand before the angry mob."

GamerGhazi,3dpulk,Net_Bastard,9,Sat Jul 18 22:42:33 2015 UTC,Semi-internet-famous trans women. Laurelai (Bailey) used to do stuff for Wikileaks. Last I knew she ditched Rationalwiki to work on SJWiki.
GamerGhazi,3dpulk,Enleat,8,Sat Jul 18 07:59:54 2015 UTC,They were at the center of the /r/lgbt drama storm that led to the creation of /r/ainbow.
GamerGhazi,3dpulk,0xFFE3,8,Sat Jul 18 09:31:00 2015 UTC,"Robotanna was a big name in shitredditsays a long time ago. TBH I don't know much more about her, she seemed cool.  Laurelai is internet famous mostly for being someone that jackasses love to hate. The hate is entirely unwarranted, and it started on reddit with MRA's claiming that she likes to make false rape claims.   Since then she's become an easy target for any accusations people want to make against her, the latest one before she secluded herself from the internet entirely being a claim that she is a rapist and a pedophile; later the three people behind those claims separately admitted to falsifying all evidence, and blaming each other for blackmailing them into it. (A claimed that B had blackmailed her, and that A had created the false twitter account that claimed to be a 14 year old victim, B claimed that C had put her up to it, (implications of an abusive relationship), and that B had told some unspecified lies, C claimed that this whole thing was A's idea, and specified that many of the things said were lies created by A. None of them talk to each other any more except in empty internet threats)  SRS also blamed her three times for trying to take over SRS, including twice where she wasn't even involved, and using one of those times as an excuse to kick out black, disabled, and transgender archangelles & community members.   (Being that a sour ex of Laurelai's is (was?) a mod in SRS, and she had acquired a bad name courtesy of the crowd that would later create /r/ainbow, it was easy for them to believe bad shit about her, even though the source of most of it is very much in opposition to SRS)  Politetimesplitter is, AFAIK, correct about her other activities, but those aren't really reasons why people would expect others on reddit to know her. The fact that she's hated because she's hated, is."
GamerGhazi,3dpulk,0xFFE3,7,Sat Jul 18 13:39:59 2015 UTC,"Wasn't she characterised as abusive by other trans people as well? I'd really like some info on this though, i don't know much about her except that there was a lot of drama round her."

While some of the allegations against her were fake, there were some that were actually true, which caused her to be demodded from a lot of places. She's been called out for it by numerous trans women for it on Twitter. As for RobotAnna, there doesn't seem to be much wrong with her. I follow her on Twitter."

GamerGhazi,3dpulk,GhostOfBrandeis,9,Sun Jul 19 14:54:24 2015 UTC,"This rant is quite something:   If you can't separate someone's actions from their identity and then have the gall to claim any criticism is harassment then you are a miserable excuse for a rational person.  Laurlai was the reason this sub was created, because social justice hypocrites were drawing to much hate for lgbt folk with their rhetoric. when your claim to being trans gendered, bi, or homosexual is because of make believe genders or because you want to gain victim status for immunity it's despicable. These people remove all agency from women, telling them that they are helpless without feminism and that they can't be free to express their sexuality (in most cases referring to heterosexuality) without indirectly harming others. They believe that all their own problems stem from society and they have zero self awareness. It is possible that Anti GG's and third parties have posed as gg'ers to stir shit, and there are bad apples among the gg'ers that may have done the same, nobody knows. But GG's mission is to end the sexist, bigotted, and perverse overcompensation for historical discrimination that society has already deemed despicable and was moving away from that is perpetuated by SJW types. The racism towards white people that gets ignored because somehow somewhere it was decided that institutional racism = racism and that apparently there never was a society that enslaved white people (ignoring thousands of years of history, for example the Khan dynasty, germanic peoples, Moors, Celts, Greeks, fuck just about everyone has been enslaved or enslaved someone else). It also claims that preferences tacitly belie discrimantion no matter what (even if sometimes it may be that way you can't really prove that and it does not cause significant harm) and that any figure couldn't possible be criticized for any reason besides racism/phobia/sexism.  The struggles of victims are stolen for the sake of pointing out how evil society is. Their irrational claims draws negative attention and encourages those that had some small amount of sexism/homophobia/etc. to justify it (""oh that crazy femnazi dyke bitch trying to tell me what to do lol"" or any other sort of reaction it might cause). I personally know teens my age that will say sexist shit just to rile up our local hoard of self loathing teenage girls and people think it is hilarious.  This bullshit makes a mockery of all feminism/rights movements and prevents focus on actual issues. Doxxing and harassing those who defy you're narrative is a despicable course of action. And if you think my rebuttal is harassment, you're a fucking joke and lack emotional maturity. Hurt feelings are not grounds for outcry. I will not stand for perverted identity politics that will make a world where Frozen is racist, gay men are sexist, sex is rape, any feeling of regret is rape, sex involving two intoxicated members of opposite sex puts that man in prison, women who rape are celebrated or go unpunished, living unhealthy is praised, and where criticism is tantamount to violence. I do not want draconian censorship of humor and insults that are even remotely offensive, that would be a rather joyless world. 1984 was a warning but social justice hypocrites treat it like a manual for running the world.  Edit: to the people who downvoted, does that really make me wrong? that you disagree? That the number is proof? Care to defend yourselves? No?

Since then, I've just been encouraging people to use software like Evernote and CherryTree to cannibalize pages from WP and edit them to fit their own uses and serve as their own notes. Wikipedia is like Facebook (except with knowledge instead, of privacy) and I think we need a diaspora-esque solution. Even if it'll come with it's own problems, at least we won't have to deal with people with an inflated sense of self-awarded importance."
GamerGhazi,3dou3l,Wrecksomething,4,Sat Jul 18 09:48:48 2015 UTC,"Wikipedia has not known what the fuck to do with offsite harassment since at least 2009 when I was up at ArbCom the first time. So it's story time.  Back in 2008, I was contacted by a newbie named Mythdon who wanted to help out in the same topic areas as I was writing. I helped him out a bit but then he just repeatedly got on my nerves over the course of a year, repeatedly warning me (while I was an administrator mind you) for using the revert tool incorrectly. At some point he asked me if I had a YouTube account with the same name. I apparently left him this message with regards to his inquiries. Prior to the opening of the arbitration case (or during it, can't remember), I went to YouTube and saw that a YouTube user named Mythdon had sent me several PMs. I relayed this information to another administrator in a PM (not through Wikipedia mind you) and he introduced this discussion as evidence because I had mentioned I looked at Mythdon's profile on YouTube and noted the age on his profile. In the end, I was punished in part because I had said I looked at his profile when the only reason I even had the ability to look at his profile was because he went out of his way to contact me through another website.  If I ever get the Gamergate case site ban lifted, this garbage still hangs over my head. I'm fairly certain I had tried to get the identity related sanctions lifted, but in the end I could only get one lifted because it had to do with harassment on site.  ArbCom doesn't care about things that happen off of Wikipedia. But we all know this already."
GamerGhazi,3dou3l,Pyryara,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:37:37 2015 UTC,"Also, as a minor aside, the only time they do deal with harassment is when it happens on site.  Russavia was a problem user on Wikipedia incessantly over several years, but he was finally indefinitely banned from the English Wikipedia after he commissioned ""Pricasso"" (an Australian artist who uses his penis to paint with) to make a portrait of Jimmy Wales after they feuded. Because what he did amounted to sexual harassment (apparently) he was banned and you can read the discussion about it. And apparently his ban now extends to all WMF websites. From what I can tell this is an impressive achievement.  When I was an administrator, I had blocked an account that was used solely to make stupid joking vandalism edits. This account and then dozens of others were used to harass me through Wikipedia's email feature. I was receiving hundreds of emails a day through the feature. I had to learn Gmail's filtering system to get rid of them as he simply sent the same message over and over (I still have many of them still in my account). This ultimately led to a Bugzilla report to request that a feature to prevent blocked accounts from being able to use the ""Send email"" feature. Of course, to file this request on Bugzilla, my email was made public (an actual bug in Bugzilla), so he began to sign me up for whatever mailing lists he could to where I had to abandon two email addresses (that I only used for Internet stuff) before I realized what was going on. During all this, I was getting help from technical users at both the English Wikipedia and the Wikimedia Commons, as he was using both websites to make accounts and harass me. His main account was discovered and blocked, but during all this another account had gone unblocked and I made sure to block it and tell everyone why. It's because of this asshole that the ""email disabled"" flag is available on Wikipedia. And also I discovered fairly recently that he managed to successfully request to be unbanned and I was never notified about it despite the fact that I was his primary victim."
GamerGhazi,3dou3l,Pyryara,12,Mon Jul 20 02:28:44 2015 UTC,"The really odd thing about Lightbreather is they apparently had enough evidence that she was a disruptive editor (before and after being the target of harassment) to justify banning her on those grounds. There was no reason to include the ""trying to identify a harasser"" thing.  But they did, anyway. Presumably because they hadn't kicked anyone when they were down for a few months, and sending out a message to potential victims of harassment that Arbcom will ban them if they do anything about it seemed to be absolutely necessary.  Worst bit is, I doubt the next Arbcom, once elected, will be any better."
GamerGhazi,3dou3l,shhhhquiet,11,Sat Jul 18 03:19:04 2015 UTC,"sending out a message to potential victims of harassment that Arbcom will ban them if they do anything about it seemed to be absolutely necessary.   Yes, I think this is the critical part.  As they stated in the GG case, no matter what kind of garbage you're being subjected to because you unwisely decided to volunteer time to WP, it's very important that you understand that harassment is an integral part of WP culture, and therefore doing anything other than quietly submitting will be taken as an attack against community standards and punished accordingly."
GamerGhazi,3dou3l,shhhhquiet,9,Sat Jul 18 03:45:45 2015 UTC,"Surprised the Lightbreather case didn't get more media attention and I suspect, from what little I've read of it, it's because we're waiting for a more ""perfect victim."" That is disappointing too.   Wikipedia has plummeted below my sinking expectations."
GamerGhazi,3dou3l,Pyryara,-2,Sat Jul 18 05:34:23 2015 UTC,"Well, most points in the ArbCom decisions sta d without any links to harassment. It's not like the site ban is only due to this bullshit claim about identifying harassers, but she was a pretty disruptive editor way beforehand."
GamerGhazi,3dou3l,shhhhquiet,3,Sat Jul 18 10:45:55 2015 UTC,"This is perilously close to ""she deserved it,"" you do realize? As in, ""if you're a disruptive editor then uploading fake porn of you is completely acceptable""?   Part of what's so toxic about WP's editing culture is the massive overreaction so many of the editors have to editing disputes. How could uploading fake porn of a female editor EVER be seen as an appropriate response to someone's encyclopedia editing? It most likely arises from so much of the editing base being teenage and young adult males, some of whom just seem to be programmed to escalate every difference of opinion into an all-out win-at-all-costs war.  It's the same kind of thinking that considers sending death threats to Anita Sarkeesian a reasonable response to her saying games are sexist.   Comments like yours just make me despair even more for WP."
GamerGhazi,3dou3l,Pyryara,0,Sat Jul 18 16:00:43 2015 UTC,I didn't say she deserved the harassment. I think you misunderstood my comment there: what it looks like to me is that the ArbCom decision for disruptiveness seems justified. Do you disagree with that? I'd really like to understand your perspective.
GamerGhazi,3dou3l,shhhhquiet,2,Sat Jul 18 16:44:13 2015 UTC,"Disruptiveness isn't something I'm equipped to judge as I haven't been watching the gun control pages, nor do I know enough about the topic to say what's legitimate commentary and what's not.  I do know that ArbCom's attitude toward off-wiki harassment of editors is deplorable, so that's what I'm commenting on."
GamerGhazi,3dou3l,shhhhquiet,2,Sat Jul 18 23:18:08 2015 UTC,"What pisses me off is that response to that off wiki harassment was itself off-wiki.

GamerGhazi,3dou3l,Fopenplop,0,Sat Jul 18 17:50:02 2015 UTC,"Reviewing some of those edit wars, I fail to see that misogyny was the underlying reason for the hostility. Pretty ""normal"" edit wars and all, which happen all the friggin time between WP editors, and in many cases this leads to bans.  I can understand if she was on the edge much more than the average male privileged Wikipedian, but I still wonder why you see misogyny as the underlying reason for most of her disruptive behaviour. I would love to understand your perspective on this."

I've heard at least five people I respect pulling that nonsense and my eyes about roll out of my head every single time.   (Off the top of my head, I heard this from TB, Jessie Cox, Moviebob, Alex Shaw, Jim Sterling, and Hannibal.  I'm sure I've heard it more elsewhere)  It's like everyone is too afraid they'll be labeled an ""Anita Fan"" and have their opinion dismissed, so they start off every conversation about her with a disclaimer about how much they actually don't like her or her work.   Then they whinge about how they can't criticize her.  If I were a content creator and I saw people badmouthing my work without offering any constructive criticism I could actually use, I'd flip all the tables.  It's especially infuriating because it reinforces the BS narrative that people only support her because she got harassed.    If someone gets harassed, the WORST thing you can do is make the entire conversation about that fact and not about what they were trying to say.

GamerGhazi,3dpymz,124876720,13,Sat Jul 18 08:44:24 2015 UTC,"This is interesting in context of their ongoing battle with corporate.    What a lot of people don't seem to understand here is the fight Gawker network writers have been undertaking to gain greater autonomy from overbearing corporate interests.  In an industry where writers generally don't have much security and there is significant pressure for every article to be good for business, it makes sense that writers have been working on building a union to better protect editorial from corporate.  So, while in this case a writer and their editor were abysmal little shits with seemingly no basic decency, many of the editorial staff do have reason to object to Gawker corporate taking down or modifying editorial content.  As one writer put it, they found the Gawker prime article gross and repellant but thought editorial should have been able to decide to take it down or not, not Gawker corporate.    Since the damage has already been done and the story is out there, forcing its removal serves only to try to reduce culpability for executives over editorial, and as far as journalistic ethics goes, take unethical action(corporate meddling in editorial) to stand against unethical behavior(outing a random guy) simply adds onto the awfulness of the situation.  People should keep in mind why it was taken down and very likely why it was ever put up at all.  Nick Denton, the head of Gawker, is possibly the biggest slimeball in that company, and his explanation that the story was well done but just not ""interesting"" enough for Gawker now shows the hollowness of the corporate decision to force the removal of the article.    Denton is the reason such an article would be put up in the first place.  Gawker executives have set the tone over the years, fostered the culture, and regularly pushed Gawker network sites to make more story decisions based on raw clicks and tabloid nonsense than anything to do with news or quality entertainment.  It's that kind of corrupting influence that writers have been trying to stand against more, and them exerting more control in this instance is an extension of that wider abuse.  Obviously Gawker prime editorial has issues; of that there can be little doubt.  That this story was approved at all is disgusting, along with other past examples of clear violations of privacy and basic ethics by people at Gawker prime.  But a big part of that is Gawker corporate.  People like Denton who have pushed network sites to be more focused on Tabloid bullshit while spitting on readers and commenters.  He and other executives want you and others to focus on editorial when they are the foundations that led to this in the first place.  So, we've gotta make sure to understand the context of this internal conflict at the Gawker network and not get too mixed up on a messy situation.  The fact is, a Gawker writer acted unethically in posting an absurd attack on a random guy they disliked, an editor unethically approved it, and then Gawker corporate unethically changed editorial content against the wishes of their writers.  Editorial should have the right to decide on it, and if in this case they had decided to stand by it, well, then we could have all lost respect for them and crossed our fingers for the lawsuit against them.    Now, the article is down on the site but still available everywhere else, we got a morally bankrupt non-apology from a Gawker executive, already frustrated writers are leveraging this as part of their wider effort against corporate, and no one has been fired yet.    If Gawker was going to do something, they shouldn't have taken down the article; they should have left it for the lawsuit to come, fired the callous jerk who wrote it, suspended or fired the editor who approved it, given an actual public apology, and laid out new standards of conduct that go beyond the usual shit they've approved for years."

GamerGhazi,3dng5e,WhatABiscuit,10,Sat Jul 18 12:28:31 2015 UTC,"I think this has to do with an overall issue with how gaming is at it's core a privileged and elitist hobby. It's about having the latest systems, or being with the ""in"" crowd as to what's popular, dick-riding top players, etc.  So rather than actually spend time playing the games and enjoy it for what it is, a very large portion of gaming is simply in it for ego. And of course that kind of ego would also bring about the supremacist thinking of ""women are lesser"" and ""women are outsiders"".  It does also have to do with a baseline of toxic masculinity thinking where men > women. Even if they will not outwardly say it, it is ultimately what they think. So no matter how badly they're doing, if they do worse or lose to a woman, it's extra salt in their wound.  It's also why when women do make accomplishments in gaming, first thing that happens is that accomplishment is played down. People will continually move goalposts for what one must do to be recognized even if they won't accomplish any of those much less match the accomplishments of the person they're berating in a million years."

I realized this tendency toward irrational anger in myself when I was on the second rung and playing against someone on the third rung--I couldn't say they were cheating, exactly, but there seemed to be something totally unfair in using words like that.

GamerGhazi,3dng5e,True_Patrician,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:02:21 2015 UTC,"I'm not too familiar with Halo but I'm questioning why you would consider them less brodude in culture considering how both are infested with toxic masculinity. Additionally, the study implies online play which suggests at least a somewhat competitive environment (not that offline is even an option for LoL).  iirc LoL was >90% male but that demographics survey was done in 2012; that ratio has more than likely changed since then. However, I highly doubt that it has dropped anywhere near to parity levels, so there is more than likely still an extreme majority of men. My argument isn't really on demographics though, it's culture, and hell I would argue that LoL fares a bit worse than Smash considering the sexism starts with Riot themselves and their roster (gender conformity, the rampant rampant objectification of female characters)..."
GamerGhazi,3dng5e,luladin,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:22:04 2015 UTC,"I guess my definition of brodude differs a bit from yours as when I say brodude I'm talking about the ""only buys an Xbox to play Halo, CoD, and Madden/FIFA and generally isn't aware or cares about any other games"". Basically I'd say it's a much more hypermasculine culture and the type of game a lot of the people who'd play LoL and Smash would call casual. Also I'd say there's a difference between like ladder competitive and just the competitiveness in a casual game.  But yeah, can't find any up to date demographic info but I imagine it's much better now, plus from what I've heard via friends who play representation is a lot better these days in the roster and within Riot staff themselves. Also LoL is definitley much worse than Smash, the FGC in general from what I've seen is really welcoming and not really toxic at all.  Also one kinda huge problem I found with the study while actually looking through for study numbers is they just randomly went on Xbox Live and played matches and recorded data from random play sessions and people they met in lobbies. Generally, from my anecdotal experience, really most of the people on mic are toxic obnoxious players, anyone who's not a total shithead either is in a private party chat meaning they wouldn't be counted in the study, or they have their mic unplugged and everyone muted because they don't like listening to the obnoxious shitheads."
GamerGhazi,3dng5e,True_Patrician,5,Sat Jul 18 03:01:21 2015 UTC,"Ergh. Looking at the language being used, I can actually see this being used as material for the PUA crowd. See all the talk about ""higher-status"" and ""submissive"" behaviour?    I'm willing to bet this ends up becoming yet another thing the manosphere will twist to fit their gross ""alpha fux, beta bux"" dogma."
GamerGhazi,3dng5e,StrivingAlly,2,Sat Jul 18 05:44:39 2015 UTC,"Yes, I already posted a critique of this in the other thread (mods have been asleep for days I guess, we have 3 threads about this, the original is the correct link and the other 2 just go to less-useful media reports.)  Anyway their entire ""social constructivist vs. evolutionary psychology"" framework is pulled out of their ass, they fail to demonstrate that the ""social constructivist"" strawman they're arguing against exists at all; their two citations for it are completely irrelevant and go to research papers about a different subject that don't discuss ""social constructivism"" or foreclose on ""evolutionary"" explanations in the slightest."
GamerGhazi,3dng5e,EvanHarper,2,Fri Jul 17 22:40:20 2015 UTC,"We now have 3 threads on this. Anyway here is my critique of the study, they threw in a bunch of really poorly supported ""evo-psych"" interpretations and attacked a ""social constructivist"" straw man that they cited to two completely irrelevant papers."
GamerGhazi,3dng5e,EvanHarper,2,Sat Jul 18 16:12:01 2015 UTC,"What? No, this line of criticism makes no sense at all. You can't extend findings about crime and violence to findings about snarky comments on XBox chat."
GamerGhazi,3dng5e,EvanHarper,3,Sat Jul 18 16:12:57 2015 UTC,"Interesting/important to note that this isn't about misogyny - it's about not being outright hostile to women. Maybe as people get more invested in the community they have higher risk of a backlash, or are just generally more mature. That doesn't mean top video game players aren't often misogynistic (they very, very often are), just that they don't flame women."
GamerGhazi,3dng5e,Yrale,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:18:50 2015 UTC,"Games are probably the one space where it's legal to violently attack someone who you don't like.  I imagine, ahem, certain people might not enjoy having that power taken away and then used against them."
GamerGhazi,3dng5e,Safgaftsa,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:07:00 2015 UTC,"Certainly jives with my (admittedly anecdotal) evidence gathered from co-running an endgame FFXI Linkshell for ~2 years, albeit with some nuance.  More specifically, I'd hypothesize that there's a mid-range of skill where the behavior is most pronounced.  Casuals and top-skill players alike didn't really seem to mind at being ""beaten"" (or, cooperatively, being passed over for an alliance role deemed higher prestige) by a woman, but mid-tier pseudo-hardcore Tryhards were the worst.  The same dynamic applies, with an almost comic obviousness, in poker."
GamerGhazi,3dng5e,gdshaffe,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:39:49 2015 UTC,I guess I'm the black sheep when it comes to this study cause I'm p much one of the worst at games but I'm not a total dickhole to people for things like their gender and stuff...  At best I'm just a bit salty when a spy/sniper reks me from out of nowhere but it's more towards the fact they're more gud than I am than anything.
GamerGhazi,3doihy,rarebitt,9,Fri Jul 17 23:18:55 2015 UTC,"I don't think there's a connection really. That sort of stuff routinely happens where you look different from the main population.  Many Asians consume American media and know American movie stars and pop stars , but white Americans often get called over to take pictures with Asians when they visit places like japan or china.  Don't think this has much to do with media."

GamerGhazi,3doihy,Casey234,2,Sat Jul 18 01:33:31 2015 UTC,I've never been to Japan but I've heard stories about that happening from friends. Maybe it happens in less tourist heavy areas?
GamerGhazi,3doihy,myGGthrowaway,4,Sat Jul 18 01:46:11 2015 UTC,"I lived in Japan for a few years, and yes, it does happen. I've experienced very similar situations to those being described by the author (except that in Japan, it is more likely for an old lady to approach you and ask to take your picture). This is not racism, this is pure and innocent curiosity. This kind of behavior is very different from the actual racism that can be experienced in Tokyo or other big cities. Racism involves an actual system of power and oppression, but some girls or an old lady wanting to take your picture and chat with you for a while are just people being friendly."
GamerGhazi,3doihy,RandomRedPanda,1 point,Sat Jul 18 11:24:23 2015 UTC,"This kinda thing happened to me a quite a few times when I spent a year in Japan (white Canadian).

GamerGhazi,3doihy,GastonBastardo,3,Sat Jul 18 08:43:11 2015 UTC,"Saying that Polish media needs more diversity is kind of preaching to the choir regarding most of the younger generation of Polish people. I always like the way people tend to forget that Poland was ravaged by the World Wars, and then after that was throw to the dogs on the wrong side of the Iron Curtain by the very world that claimed wanted to save them.  I have a lot of Polish friends, they know what they need to do and they know what it is gonna take to get their country to where they want it to be because unlike a lot of people they are painfully aware of the impact their history has had on their present."

GamerGhazi,3dmihq,ilikekittensdoyou,45,Fri Jul 17 13:59:22 2015 UTC,"Ian links to this comic his video description, and it's really good and well worth checking out. Edit: I guess that's not the best source to be linking to.  I often worry that Ghazi has some complicitity in fostering this good person/bad person divide.  Humans are really great at creating ""us vs them"" relationships, and it bothers me to see Gators referred to as bad people, rather than just people doing bad things.  It's hard to convince someone to change their behavior when you start with ""You are a bad person.""  They look at your argument, decide for themselves that ""No, I'm not a bad person,"" and can then dismiss the rest of your argument because of that faulty premise.  Any other points in your argument aren't worth consideration because they're based on that easily dismissable premise of them being bad.  I come to Ghazi by way of ShitRedditSays, where the ""bad thing you said makes you a bad person"" thing is sort of the modus operandi, albeit in a largely satirical manner.  I love SRS and the Fempire at large, but I recognize that it's not terribly persuasive.  I'm not saying that I think everyone on KIA is one well-framed argument away from being convinced of the error of their ways.  I just think it's important to consider the ways you talk to and talk about the people with whom you disagree.  I really like the way Ian's videos are trying to explain and humanize these people, and I hope that's something that we can all take away from this."
GamerGhazi,3dmihq,WhiteKnightErrant,31,Fri Jul 17 16:44:43 2015 UTC,"I agree with the sentiment. In practice it is harder though.  Here in Ireland during the marriage equality debate it was often stressed that when trying to convince a No voter to vote Yes for marriage equality it was important not to condemn them to much and to try and relate to them in a way that doesn't upset them, lest they double down on their bigoted views and are beyond hope. You flattered them, they weren't bad people they just had a misunderstanding that could easily be changed if they just spent some time with gay people. They would see that this view they had about gays was wrong. You shouldn't explore the reasons they held these bigoted views in the first place because if people felt attacked they would recoil.   Now it has been shown time and again that this is actually the only way to reach people who have entrenched bigoted views that they learned through culture. It works, I'm not disputing that. They do thing they are good, they think what they think is inherently good, they feel attacked if someone points out it isn't good, they will double down if you attack them too much. If you want to change a persons mind you need to handle them with kid gloves. It seems to actually be too much to expect that people self evaluate their own beliefs and change themselves.   The only problem with this is that it is exhausting for those who suffer under the bigoted views and it puts all the responsibility to be civil on the person who doesn't hold the horrible ideas. It works sure, but I also think if a gay campaigner who is meeting the 100th anti-gay bigot who wants to tell them that they are an abomination expecting that person to have the strength to not get angry or dismissive with this person is asking too much.  You often need to flatter the ego of the oppressor in order to get them to change their mind. But if you don't do this I'm not going to criticise you if you just run out of patience with this and dismiss the person as an ignorant asshole. Ideally people would self evaluate themselves if lots of people are saying they are an ignorant asshole. They won't of course, and you risk losing them for your side of the argument. But that doesn't stop it being any less exhausting."
GamerGhazi,3dmihq,DeLoftie,15,Fri Jul 17 17:03:27 2015 UTC,"This is absolutely fair.  I suppose I have veered a bit into a tone argument there.  As someone who has never been dehumanized for my race, orientation, or gender, I haven't had to deal with the kind of situation you describe, trying to treat someone far kinder than they're treating me.  I have to say I've been really impressed with how a lot of the GamerGate targets have dealt with their harassers.  They're in a situation where any hostility they show (that would surely not be unreasonable given the amount of vitriol thrown at them) would get screencapped and spread around as evidence of how awful they are.  I'm sure it must be exhausting.  Edit: And really, this is why I really like SRS, despite the fact that it isn't terribly constructive.  It's not meant to be.  It's there for people who have been dehumanized for who they are to vent that frustration.  No one is there to tell you that you'd be doing a better job if you just were a little kinder to those people who have been awful to you.  (Which is pretty much the thing I just did, I guess.)"
GamerGhazi,3dmihq,WhiteKnightErrant,4,Fri Jul 17 17:28:14 2015 UTC,"The Irish way of thinking; Tell them not to do something rudely, they'll do it out of spite no matter how dumb or dangerous it is. I know because... I've an awful habit of doing it too :S"
GamerGhazi,3dmihq,Guerilla-Mask,12,Fri Jul 17 20:25:59 2015 UTC,I think it's also important to remember that SRS was never intended to change anyone's mind. That was never their goal nor do they care if people change their mind.

GamerGhazi,3dmihq,Nasharchy,21,Fri Jul 17 21:29:06 2015 UTC,"It is very important to recognize peoples' potential for growth and change. I'm about to turn 27, but if GG had happened when I was 17-20 years old, I'm almost certain I would have been one of them.  I probably/hopefully wouldn't have been an anonymous twitter harasser, but I would have loudly proselytized the need for reform in gaming journalism ethics to anyone who would listen. Because what could be worse than being misinformed about how good a game is before buying it? And what could be worse than yet another person, (the newest incarnation of the parents, the pastors, the teachers of our youth,) who wants to air the dirty laundry of video games?   Remember that debacle involving psychologist Cooper Lawrence following Fox's lead on calling Mass Effect pornographic? I wasn't one of the mob who retaliated by giving her books one-star reviews on Amazon, but at the time I did think that was appropriate and satisfying justice. (And yeah, there's a difference between this & GG in that Lawrence truly was wrong, but the demonizing and the digital hate-mobbing are the same.) Thankfully, people can change, and I'm still not sure how, but I did.  On GamePolitics' post covering Lawrence's apology a few days later in the NYT, I found Angry Jack, second comment down*:   People like you Cooper, do not deserve the freedom of expression. You are an ignorant cocky lady who has put thousands to shame and not one sorry leaves your lips, We as a comunity are deeply upset. If your book's sales had not plummited this sham of an ""Appology"" would have never existed.

GamerGhazi,3dmihq,nodying,10,Sat Jul 18 18:50:15 2015 UTC,"Oh definitely, assuming that everyone involved in something bad must be ill-intentioned themselves is a foolish attitude.  But we don't, and can't, ever really know their minds, we only see their actions and words. When bigotry and paranoia are so widely upheld and repeated without meaningful challenge, and the group as a whole claims absolution of any wrong-doing and a corporate benefit to everything good done by a part, that skews what we can conclude pretty heavily.  Of course there are well-meaning people who see in GamerGate something positive that they relate to, something they feel strongly about that can't be dismissed as reactionary or close-minded. There are people who feel wronged and disenfranchised (sometimes even with non-hilariously bad reasons), or spurned by the people who ought to have supported them. But that doesn't change the ugly effect that the mob has had or that the entire thing is an optical illusion created to make something reprehensible look like a good idea from multiple, contradictory angles."

This comes up a lot when a celebrity gets caught making a racist comment; defenders (including the celebrity him or herself) will emphasize how good of a person he or she is and the person's intent vs. just the statement or action itself and its effect. It's a different point of emphasis and one that underlies so many of these ""controversies.""    His Castle Doctrine example demonstrates this beautifully.

GamerGhazi,3dmihq,JefWithOnef,14,Fri Jul 17 17:06:15 2015 UTC,"A while back my daughter came up behind me and I didn't know she was there. I turned around and ended up cracking her right across the face. Totally accidental, but I still had a crying little girl that needed hugs and sorrys on my hand. What kind of bastard would stand there and just say, ""well I didn't mean to do it so you shouldn't be upset?"" That's how I take the intent argument."
GamerGhazi,3dmihq,sisyphusmyths,0,Fri Jul 17 19:52:19 2015 UTC,"Is that a really sound analogy, though? When you slapped your daughter, there couldn't be honest disagreement between you that a slap occurred, nor could there be honest disagreement over whether or not it ""rightfully"" elicited a pain response, since that is autonomic and involuntary. You were actively involved (in the slap), and her involvement was merely passive.  In the case of speech and intent, the issue is a little murkier.  Initial emotional response to a problematic speech act is largely involuntary and instantaneous (just like a pain response), but all the interpretation that happens from that instant forward is not, and is just as subject to every human failing from incomprehension to prejudice.  Your daughter absolutely needed and deserved to be consoled and hugged and cuddled and apologized to for the slap.  But if she had spent the next three years convinced that--despite consolation, apologies, and all the rest--the slap was really proof that you hated her, or you hated daughters in general, or that you didn't want her to be your daughter, she would be wrong.  Basically, in the same way that we absolutely bear the responsibility for even the inadvertent harm that we do, being harmed does not inherently validate or vindicate every act, speech, or thought that follows.  It's one of the big reasons the cycle of pain continues."
GamerGhazi,3dmihq,MarioNecromancer,4,Fri Jul 17 23:57:22 2015 UTC,"An accidental slap is the result of clumsiness, of not thinking about the possibility of who or what might be next to you while you turn around rapidly. The chances of an accidental slap can be greatly reduced if the father becomes more aware that his daughter may be quietly standing nearby at any moment, so he starts to look more carefully around his environment before making sudden moves in his home. This is how we all reduce our own clumsiness. We use empathy to regret the pain our clumsiness caused, and then we learn to be more careful in similar circumstances in the future.   In my opinion, the analogy holds just fine. Someone who acts without care for who might unintentionally be hurt by an action can be forgiven once or twice if they apologize for their thoughtlessness. However, if they keep on engaging in the same thoughtless behavior day after day, and act defensive about it every time someone objects, then they're refusing to accept that their thoughtless behavior has consequences. Their refusal to empathize, adapt, and learn looks more and more like deliberate selfishness, even abuse."
GamerGhazi,3dmihq,sisyphusmyths,0,Sat Jul 18 00:29:39 2015 UTC,"Oh, I don't disagree at all with the need for empathy, or for avoiding actions that could reasonably be foreseen to cause harm to others, or conceivably have significant risk of doing so accidentally.  I'm sort of pulling on a thread that's been bugging me for a bit, in this back-and-forth with gators.  They essentially claim that a speech act is nothing like a ""real"" act (hence their belief that it should exist unregulated, as well as their downplay of the awful harassment they take part in, and the lives they ruin).  This is clearly not the case.  We as a group, on the other hand, tend to go to the other extreme, claiming that a speech act is, for moral purposes, indistinguishable as a class separate from any other type of act (hence the easy analogy and implied equivalence of a physical blow to verbal hurt), and thus naturally believe speech acts should be similarly subject to both external moderation and individual prior restraint.    It's not just a difference of opinion, it's pretty close to a disagreement on first principles."
GamerGhazi,3dmihq,QuartzKitty,2,Sat Jul 18 04:11:22 2015 UTC,"I cannot disagree more that intent doesn't matter. It matters greatly.   If someone is seriously injured in the course of you attempting to perform CPR upon them (which happens far more often than most people realize), it's a lot different than if you intentionally sought out to harm them. They were harmed by you either way, but in the first case, they were harmed in the process of you saving their life. By saying intent doesn't matter, you are saying there is no difference between breaking someone's ribs while performing CPR, and breaking their ribs by beating them up out of anger.  Intent DOES matter. It's not everything, but it is important. Good intentions by themselves do not inherently justify a bad outcome, but someone being accidentally injured in the course of you actively trying to do good for other people is a lot different than someone being hurt because you were trying to do something that benefits you."
GamerGhazi,3dmihq,the_cants,2,Fri Jul 17 23:54:31 2015 UTC,"intent doesn't mean jack shit.   That goes too far in the other direction. While intent is not the be-all-end-all, it is not meaningless.  Say there's a car accident because a fire engine runs a red light on the way to put out a fire. Now, say the same accident happens because some guy just couldn't be bothered to stop for the red light. The outcome is the same, the only difference is the intention.  And if the end results are all that matters, then that basically clears the way all manner of harmful and unethical actions, as long as the end result is deemed ""positive"" - (by what measures?)."
GamerGhazi,3dmihq,mattwan,5,Fri Jul 17 22:24:43 2015 UTC,"I think we need to be more clear that ""good"" and ""bad"" occur along multiple different axes.  In your car-crash example, I think most of us would agree that the firetruck driver was more justified in driving dangerously than the careless stoplight-runner. On the ""justification"" axis, then, the firefighter is likely to be seen as having been acting appropriately, and therefore likely to fall toward the ""good"" end of the spectrum, while the careless driver is likely to be seen as having been acting inappropriately/""bad"".  If we look at the ""consequences"" axis, on the other hand, both theoretical drivers cause harm; in fact, the driver of a honkin' big firetruck probably causes more harm than the careless driver in an economy sedan. Let's ignore that detail, though, and say that in both scenarios the victim survives but is left with a broken spine and permanently wheelchair-bound. Along this axis, both drivers have created an equal amount of harm and are thus equally ""bad"", and both are equally liable for remediating the damage they have caused.  To put it in terms of the latest video, the firefighter is a good person who caused harm; they shouldn't be expected to self-flagellate, but they should be expected to accept responsibility for remediating the damage.  Basically, their good intentions don't get them off the hook for the damage they've done; those intentions mediate their criminal and social liability, but they do nothing to mediate the consequences experienced by the victim.  Does that make sense?"
GamerGhazi,3dmihq,the_cants,0,Fri Jul 17 23:42:20 2015 UTC,"Basically, their good intentions don't get them off the hook for the damage they've done; those intentions mediate their criminal and social liability, but they do nothing to mediate the consequences experienced by the victim.   Right, the consequences are the same. But if intent meant ""jack shit"" then there wouldn't be a difference in criminal and social liability.  That's also why we have a distinction between murder and manslaughter, for example. Or someone accidentally not paying for an item in a store, versus someone deliberately stealing it."
GamerGhazi,3dmihq,mattwan,3,Fri Jul 17 23:48:30 2015 UTC,"Right, and that's why we need to be more careful in identifying which axes we're talking about when we're talking about ""good"" and ""bad"". In determining whether actions are harmful, then intentions really don't mean ""jack shit""--harm done is harm done, and it falls on the person who caused the harm to remediate it[1]; in determining whether actions reveal a person to be ""good"" or ""bad"", then intentions mean a hell of a lot. On the third axis of ""do I want to continue associating with this person?"", even if an abuser has a pure and gentle heart, their demonstrated history of bad action still doesn't pull them out of the ""drop 'em like a hot potato""  area of the spectrum.  [1] Murder vs manslaughter is an interesting case here, in that there's little that can be done to remediate causing a death. I think there can be some civil avenues for families of the deceased? I think that's what the civil OJ trial was about, at least. This could be an example of where everything kind of falls apart at the extremes."
GamerGhazi,3dmihq,3Nerd,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:05:25 2015 UTC,"Hi, you're right. My phrasing was probably a bit too harsh. I think that the ""meaning"" of intent becomes more important the more intimate the interaction is. Should have been clear about what kind of interaction I was talking about.  When the creator of a work talks about intent, that is kind of silly, since the work is out of his/her hands and open to interpretation by everyone that consumes said work. He/she couldn't possibly have predicted how everyone would react. And if people criticise the work for having a meaning that wasn't intended, it is totally fine for the creator to say that it wasn't his intention to have that effect. What isn't fine, is for him/her to just tell his audience that they got the meaning wrong, or trying to defend his intended meaning as the only ""true"" meaning, when some say that his work is sexist/racist/whatever. Granted, there is a bit of a gray area here as well, but in the end, what the author intended with his work isn't all that important anymore.  On the other hand, in a life and death situation, like the one you talked about, the intent of actions is of course way more important. There are more grey areas. Which is obviously a good thing. But in the end, you're still going to get judged by your actions more often then not."
GamerGhazi,3dmihq,wordsmythe,3,Sat Jul 18 09:33:50 2015 UTC,"This comes up a lot when a celebrity gets caught making a racist comment; defenders (including the celebrity him or herself) will emphasize how good of a person he or she is and the person's intent vs. just the statement or action itself and its effect.   Hey, that's a great Jay Smooth video."
GamerGhazi,3dmihq,yas_man,15,Fri Jul 17 21:01:18 2015 UTC,"The gut reflex of denial that he is getting at seems like a good way to explain peoples reaction to a lot of problems in the world. It seems like there is a certain type of person who is so perturbed by the idea of injustice and helplessness to change it that they would rather deny it exists than live with the prospect that a bad situation in life isn't always your own fault. The idea that their actions are keeping someone else down is probably equally distasteful to them. That's why I think we should steer clear of personal culpability when discussing these things. It just isn't effective at making allies. It would be best to make it clear that why we discuss issues in the world is not to shame individuals, but because sometimes, encouragement of different values in people is the only way we know of to affect change."
GamerGhazi,3dmihq,dlqntn,17,Fri Jul 17 15:24:28 2015 UTC,"It's the old ""Just World Hypothesis"", the idea that someone's status in life is purely a function of their own personal qualities, and is therefore perfectly just. Thus, those who are suffering deserve to suffer. Those who are prosperous deserve to prosper. Suggesting that reality might be otherwise opens the possibility that a person's success may not be proof positive that they are intelligent, industrious, dare I say, ""good"" people, and that they may instead simply be the beneficiaries of institutional bias.  Which is to say that I agree strongly with your conclusion. This idea is ingrained in (particularly American) culture, its not the brain-child of any one individual.  What makes this difficult is that, no matter how diplomatic we may try to be, attacking the Just World feels like an attack on the individual character of the person trying to defend it because of what the Just World's conclusions lead them to think about themselves and their own virtues. There aren't enough qualifiers in the world to blunt the suggestion in their mind that you're saying they didn't earn what they have or that they're a bad person and should be ashamed. It's why this video series is so important: it works not to prove the Just World wrong, but to show people why they might be so resistant to the possibility the Just World is wrong, and to try to cajole them into reconsidering their opinions."
GamerGhazi,3dmihq,345345554,5,Fri Jul 17 16:34:39 2015 UTC,"People are largely discouraged to actively self-reflect on their own life circumstances and their own place in the world. That's why people have such a hard time understanding ""privileged"".   Being privileged doesn't make you a bad person, but rather because you are privileged you have a greater social obligation of being more self-aware because you do have easier access to things that a lot of other people don't.  But it ultimately comes down to: Thinking is too hard. Doing anything to challenge the status quo even if you are actively aware enough to understand why it's shit is too hard.  So rather than do anything, even if it's something minor like speaking up when you happen to be in a position where your voice does have greater weight or simply educating yourself so you can understand what other people are talking about, people would rather do nothing and continue pretending like nothing's wrong."
GamerGhazi,3dmihq,3Nerd,18,Fri Jul 17 20:28:30 2015 UTC,"This is interesting because it gets at way gator types are so opposed to media criticism. From their perspective if a problem with a game has not occurred to them than it effectively does not exist. to a gator or gator adjacent person media criticism is not just pointing out problems with games it is creating them.. This is especially bad with feminist criticism because gators don't think like feminists, so those problems would absolutely never occur to them if somebody like Anita Sarkeesian didn't point them out. We often joke about how gators think that feminists are ruining games, but from within their own personal universes they actually are."
GamerGhazi,3dmihq,Tweevle,11,Fri Jul 17 16:02:01 2015 UTC,"Interesting observation.   I also noticed that a lot of people think that criticising something means that you have to say good AND bad things, otherwise you're just a hater...   And BTW, their idea of an objective review is just silly."
GamerGhazi,3dmihq,HiNutty94,12,Fri Jul 17 17:12:20 2015 UTC,"It also might have something to do with how people describe those ""looking to be offended"". Like, they aren't like this person, they haven't been through any of these experiences that might cause them to be offended by the subject in question (or if they have, they happen to not be the sort of person to whom it bothers). To them, no problem exists, so when someone turns up and says they find it offensive, they can't get their head around why someone would see a problem there, so they must be creating a problem. Why would someone create a problem where none exists? Looking for attention/money/feeling superior/general nastiness/etc. which are the typical charges they lay against ""SJWs""."
GamerGhazi,3dmihq,JefWithOnef,5,Fri Jul 17 17:59:10 2015 UTC,"I genuinely wonder why gators think feminists are ruining games. Like, let's say feminists win today against the ""war on gaming"" and gaming companies are going start representing women and minorities more cautiously in games. They're going to use Anita's videos as a guide to gauge what tropes and cliches to avoid when making female characters. What do gators think video games will look like five years from now?   In my head, they'll be less objectifying to female characters in new titles, new franchises that star female characters will show up, and so will franchises where you can choose your gender. One or two franchises that objectify female characters may cease to exist, but that's to be expected even without feminism for various unrelated reasons. Other franchises may change their structure on female characters, but may not due to changes being too jarring for the fans and less people may buy the games. We'll see less of the damsels in distress and dudes in distress, which is a weak plot tool anyway and will encourage developers to be more creative and inventive with games' plots. Lgbt characters will be somewhat more prevalent in games and won't fall into the same tired, old stereotypes like the butch lesbian or flamboyant gay guy. More races will be represented and have more accurate representation. New titles with these things implemented can and very likely will have more complex stories because real people are complex and will reflect that, without having to leave the escapism aspect that games provide. Games have been suffering from a severe drop in quality for the past few years and can seriously benefit from all these elements added. Old titles probably won't change at all due to tradition, but that's ok, there'll be something for everyone, and many titles are good without those things in it. So it's not necessary for every single franchise to change, and like I said before, old titles probably won't.  I'm a woman so I'm biased, but I don't see why this is such a scary future to gators. If fact, they might read this and not mind at all if games go this direction. If that's the case, why be a part of gamer gate? Because you hate feminism? If this is what feminists are asking for and you don't mind this future to happen, why do care if feminists win? Because... you hate feminism? It just makes you angry that they win? To reiterate the title of the video and thread, WHY ARE YOU SO ANGRY?"
GamerGhazi,3dmihq,JefWithOnef,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:33:59 2015 UTC,"Because... you hate feminism? It just makes you angry that they win?   Yeah, I think this is it. Anyone left in gamergate at this point is either a hardcore anti-feminist, an internet troll, or both. They don't even care about video games that much, they are just the battleground that they have chosen to stake their claim on because sexism in the video game industry is more entrenched than in other artistic mediums due to its connection to the super sexist tech industry."

A better understanding of what motivates other people is always a necessity before engaging in complicated discussions and conversations.  What I am wondering now is, how do you engage with these people? How do you try to change someone's opinion about something when that something is so ingrained with their own persona? This is not a problem exclusive to feminism, gamergate or media. This is a huge question that is at the center of some of the largest discussions of our time, like climate change. Knowing how to breach these walls is of utmost importance, our survival as species could hinge on it. I'm eager to hear what Ian has to say about this."

GamerGhazi,3dmihq,dlqntn,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:02:11 2015 UTC,I think it is important to note that most people have these attitudes but in a lesser extent. Try to be critical towards your own views and morality as well.
GamerGhazi,3dmihq,Cielle,-2,Fri Jul 17 20:12:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah, he lost me with this one.   I've been iffy on this series for a little bit because of how close it's strayed to pop-psych, armchair-diagnosis territory, and the ""they're just mad because they know deep down I'm right"" message of this installment is just too much for me to keep thinking of it as credible."
GamerGhazi,3dmihq,dlqntn,25,Sat Jul 18 06:46:04 2015 UTC,"Weird, the message I interpreted was that a certain ethical tradition is flawed and that this informs how we respond to social issues and cultural criticism.

GamerGhazi,3dmihq,Tweevle,18,Fri Jul 17 16:34:44 2015 UTC,"Agreed. He's not arguing for the truth or falsehood of Anita's videos, or of feminism in general, he's trying to analyze why people have responded with such vitriol to a video series of rather mild criticism of sexism in video games. Asking, y'know, why are they so angry?"
GamerGhazi,3dmihq,Cielle,0,Fri Jul 17 18:03:31 2015 UTC,It's a work of amateur psychoanalysis which just happens to echo everything its audience already believed about a group they already didn't like. That's the sort of analysis you should treat with heavy suspicion.
GamerGhazi,3dmihq,dlqntn,10,Fri Jul 17 18:55:59 2015 UTC,"I don't think the idea that he's just pandering to us is completely true. Note how even here in this thread the video has elicited a number of discussions on how to approach people when talking about social justice issues, and how anyone, including us, can fall into thinking of morality as a binary and of a person's ""purity"" as paramount over the ""big picture"" impact of their actions.   This happens to everyone, we all do it, and the fact that we're not all professional psychologists shouldn't prevent us from recognizing it. It's just that, in this case, the overall thrust of the videos is explaining the behavior of a particular group of people, but with points that are broadly applicable outside of discussing that group."
GamerGhazi,3dmihq,manwhatsit,8,Fri Jul 17 19:39:39 2015 UTC,"What he's saying on Twitter supports this, eg. he's saying he's using GG as a case study for a larger discussion, and that he recognises himself in the series.

GamerGhazi,3do3kj,isockforcash,18,Fri Jul 17 21:16:14 2015 UTC,"I honestly believe that whoever coined the term 'privilege' screwed up. It is useful as an academic concept, but it is horrible to engage in conversations. The people who will claim they have had hardships in their lives are not lying. America is a country where most people are struggling one way or another, but it is also a place that enshrines the idea of self-reliance. That is a toxic combination.  In this context, asking someone to recognize their privilege becomes a personal attack. For someone enmeshed in the American mindset, suggesting that what they have may not be entirely because of their own work undermines their perception of self-worth. This is a terrible way to start any conversation, as it automatically makes people go into defensive mode. It doesn't matter how right the person talking about privilege is, that conversation is going nowhere in the individualistic mentality of America.   Does white privilege exist? Of course it does! Denying that is ludicrous. But is the concept useful as a tool to improve the shitty racial situation in this country? I don't think so."
GamerGhazi,3do3kj,RandomRedPanda,8,Fri Jul 17 22:47:43 2015 UTC,"I find ""privilege"" extraordinarily useful as a concept when I'm talking about things I haven't experienced.   i.e. I understand ""privilege"" to be a useful short-hand to mean simply that I don't understand things I haven't experienced.  I mean how is that earth shattering for anyone.   Experiencing something allows you to understand something better than not experiencing it."
GamerGhazi,3do3kj,fish_magnet,6,Sat Jul 18 00:24:52 2015 UTC,"Sure, but you're not the person who needs convincing. In fact, think of what you said in the context of someone who feels threatened by the concept of 'privilege'. One needs to understand how said people feel if one wants to engage in a conversation with them.    I mean how is that earth shattering for anyone.   It is for a lot of people, and denying it leads nowhere."
GamerGhazi,3do3kj,RandomRedPanda,4,Sat Jul 18 00:35:17 2015 UTC,"The root problem here is people being afraid of learning, and being afraid of anything that threatens their ego.

Yes, white people need to get past their own fragility and open their eyes to the world, but also, yes, no one wants to think they're privileged, especially in America, land of bootstraps, and definitely anyone who didn't grow up wealthy. We are all raised to think everything we get is based on our own ability, even when that patently isn't the case. So while the root problem isn't the word but just part of white supremacist bullshit, it does make sense that the word privilege itself contributes to the knee-jerk reactions of BUT I WAS BULLIED or BUT WE WERE POOR. Anything to be able to say BUT MY STRUGGLE...!"
GamerGhazi,3do3kj,SJHalflingRanger,4,Sat Jul 18 03:13:04 2015 UTC,"Also, if you say so and so is privileged, the first thing you're going to think of is rich. That's the association most people will make. Outside an academic setting, you're either going to be working to rewrite the meaning of privilege as its used casually, or finding another way to talk about it that bypasses people's guard. The later seems easier to me, but some people get really attached to the terms they're familar with."

""Pride"" is another term that seems to have that same reaction.  I also don't know if there's a better term, tbh. But it seems like a lot of people just keep going back to the wrong definition, or conflate the two, in a way similar to ""theory"".  I don't know if it's language choices, semantics, or something else, but it definitely is a stumbling block and makes it much less desirable to talk to white folk about race."
GamerGhazi,3do3kj,madhaus,3,Sat Jul 18 02:14:40 2015 UTC,"The idea isn't to make oppressed groups use a different word for the benefit of the oppressors.

GamerGhazi,3do3kj,_rhetz_,9,Sat Jul 18 04:35:27 2015 UTC,"The study quantified the defensive reaction most of us have observed when a white person denies the existence of white privilege. What's needed next are some experiments showing the best approach to get past the defensiveness. We can't have a discussion if the disbelievers are roiling in emotional shutdown. (See: Every Gator ever.)  John Scalzi wrote his seminal, pre GynoGripe essay on white privilege as illustrated by a hypothetical videogame. He said he used that metaphor because he had too many discussions with white dudes who went apeshit when the word privilege came up. Even though he made a point of not using the word throughout the rest of the essay, proto-Gators gated over their incredible hardships compared to random black celebrities."

GamerGhazi,3dn0bn,Archchancellor,11,Fri Jul 17 19:20:40 2015 UTC,"It's been a long time since I worked on a production team (theater, not film-making) but some things are essentially the same. Behind-the-scenes drama between members of the team is incredibly common, most often disputes between the Director and the various technicians, usually based on a ""I want it this way!"" vs. ""That is not physically/monetarily possible, come up with another idea"" sort of dispute. At this point, the Producer steps in and mediates the issue. If the Producer is any good, they have already seen the conflict coming during production meetings, and already have a few alternative plans or suggestions to try and re-direct the energy away from arguing the original point towards a new mutual goal.  Underneath all the personality sniping and he-said-he-said back-and-forth, what I see here is primarily a problem with clashing creative visions and the unresolved question of who, ultimately, was in charge of the final decisions. Each partner seems to think it was them, and when the other disagreed, both felt they were in the right. Hence the mediator. This is poor production management. It ought to have been very clearly laid out from the beginning who had the ultimate decision-making power, including the power to fire members of the team that were not falling in line. Since Owen was clearly unable to do this, or Aurini was unable to accept his role as Producer, the project gets tanked. The only thing Owen did right was to retain legal and financial control. Aurini can whine all he likes about Owen's decisions and Owen's un-professionalism, but if Owen controls the funding then he owns the project. Period. Aurini does not seem to have understood this yet, but watching him pretend to still be in charge of things is certainly worth all the money their backers paid them. Perhaps not to the backers, but to me."

GamerGhazi,3dlq4v,TheDunadan,3,Fri Jul 17 13:54:17 2015 UTC,144fps is like a distant dream for me. Are there even any strobic effects at that speed or do you feel higher rates than that would make any improvement?

Again though, everyone's eyes are different. Some people can't tell the difference between 30 and 60, some might be able to tell the difference between 250 and 500.

GamerGhazi,3dlq4v,ShillMaster9000,15,Fri Jul 17 17:42:33 2015 UTC,"Most of us can tell because if we couldn't, a major complaint about many modern TVs wouldn't be the so-called ""Soap Opera Effect"".  That's a problem that happens if you watch a movie that was originally shot at 24fps on certain modern TVs. Those modern TVs try to interpolate frames - creating what it believes are the frames that would appear had the film been shot at 50, 60, or 120fps. And that's not as hard as it sounds, indeed most video compression is based upon determining how a video is transitioning from one frame to the next and storing only movement information and a delta.  So... what happens? Well, if it's any good, it looks terrible. Because your eye isn't expecting 120fps. Everything is far too smooth and realistic. The only time you usually see drama ""filmed"" at high frame rates are soap operas, because those are shot using video cameras and recorded on tape, so the whole thing looks like a soap opera.  So, yeah, we can tell. However, 24fps is almost certainly fast enough, our reaction times just aren't that good, so increasing the frame rate really is just an aesthetic thing.  What amuses me is that people are saying we need the high rates for ""cinematic"" video. That makes no sense to me. Immersive? Yeah, I can get behind that. But ""cinematic""?"
GamerGhazi,3dlq4v,squiggleslash,14,Fri Jul 17 14:16:55 2015 UTC,"Yes, the Hobbit had the problem of people expecting 24 fps and finding 48 to be 'television'. Which is odd, to me it resembled more seeing people on stage in theatre, which is more welcome to me. But there is a sort-of deformation of expectations if people reject a higher quality because it no longer masks the flaws of previous material.  I personally feel that the 24 fps for film argument sounds a lot like people who prefer the sound of the gramophone and felt really uneasy when CD-quality no longer masked the previously hidden flaws.  I am not really too invested in the reaction times argument, but it also is not 'just an aesthetic thing' to me. That is, 30 fps feels uncomfortable to me in the way that 15 fps feels uncomfortable. 24 was 'fast enough' because film was expensive. In a way we still have that argument with 30; it is just now that the rendering pipelines are expensive.  It's not that I need 60 fps, but it is a lot more comfortable to me to watch and I would rather have 60 fps than the extra triangles. Of course ironically with VR coming up even 60 fps can feel really nauseating at times and we need to start looking at such rates rendered for two eyes... :-\"
GamerGhazi,3dlq4v,WhatABiscuit,6,Fri Jul 17 14:32:10 2015 UTC,"I can understand both sides here.   One amusing anecdote - I  recall in the early nineties hearing more than one person upset about the decline of the Amiga, not because it was the best computer ever (which it was! Take that PClones and Atari ST losers! In your face Macheads!) but because they genuinely thought the video was better on it than they were getting out of their VGA PCs.  Why was did they think games on the Amiga were ""better""? Well, because while the video output of the Amiga was the same, or sometimes even lower, in resolution, to the PC, the NTSC/PAL CRT TVs you typically used an Amiga to game were so hideously low quality, that the 320x2something games looked ""right"" on them. Play them on a VGA monitor however, and no amount of scanline doubling and other tricks could make them look anything but blocky and ugly.  An issue with movies is that the framerate is part of the language, the thing that says ""This is a movie."" Just as a high quality monochrome image says ""This is art house"" rather than ""We didn't use the latest technology, sorry."" And it's typical to add, rather than hide, more artifacts. The Matrix famously tints everything green or blue, for example.  Maybe the language thing explains the love of vinyl. The crackling after the needle lands inside the outer groove of the record and navigates it to the first track is something a certain generation expected to hear, the language that says ""Strap yourself in, and be quiet, you're about to hear some MUSIC.""  Right now video games are in a situation where they're changing so much they don't get the chance to define much of a language. They can either borrow from more familiar forms of media, or just try to find some kind of realism using the technology available. With VR, I think you're right, borrowing the language of other medias is just not going to work if you're not looking at a fixed screen any more."

But there is a sort-of deformation of expectations if people reject a higher quality because it no longer masks the flaws of previous material.

GamerGhazi,3dlq4v,rarebitt,4,Fri Jul 17 19:05:40 2015 UTC,"I think the most important part is seeing when NOT to care. I can tell the difference, but I don't CARE about the difference for basically everything on the Framerate Police curator page. Its mostly not shooters, not fighting games, not AAA action games... its indie things, or turnbased games, or puzzley ""follow the leader"" stuff like Cook Serve Delicious.  Who in their right mind cares about getting 60 FPS on the Jackbox Party Pack games? For real.  If this was about highlighting the Graphics Crime of new AAA releases, that'd be one thing. In practice its just being used as another avenue to harass indie devs the GG people latching onto this are ideologically opposed to, regardless of if it makes any material difference to anyone or not."
GamerGhazi,3dlq4v,Sappow,9,Fri Jul 17 22:28:31 2015 UTC,"I'm surprised, as well. The difference is night and day- there's a significant perceptual difference between playing at 30FPS and 60FPS- it practically leaps out of the screen at you.  I mean, I'm not all that fussed by the idea of a game shipping at 30FPS- it's more than playable. But 60FPS really is a fair bit nicer."
GamerGhazi,3dlq4v,LocutusOfBorges,8,Fri Jul 17 14:13:01 2015 UTC,"When I'm playing Skyrim, it's actually quite noticeable when it drops from 60 down to 45. Sure it is still feels fine to play but it is very noticeable."
GamerGhazi,3dlq4v,Cerus-,6,Fri Jul 17 15:07:51 2015 UTC,"From programming and having to solve problems I have noticed that framedrops are far worse than a stable lower rate. The absolute worst is an occasional 'slow' frame. 45 to 30, or 60 to 45 is far worse than a stable 30."
GamerGhazi,3dlq4v,WhatABiscuit,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:29:33 2015 UTC,"Traditionally, monitors operate at 60 Hz, meaning the fastest framerate visible on-screen can be 60 Hz. Games can render faster, but an individual pixel could not update faster than 60 times per second. So the 'connoisseur' frame rate defaulted to the maximum. At the same time, 30 fps is a traditionally 'accepted' frame rate, though I am not sure why I suspect it has something to do with televisions and a sort-of-30-frame-per-second format.  So 45 is a lot better than 30, but 'it's not the max' is why people obsess about it. Generally people who like strong computers also want the maximum.  Although now new monitors can now reach 140 Hz, so there is a whole new range of high frame rates. I am not entirely sure what the maximum 'useful' framerate could be, because it will have something to do with the way objects move on screens as well as eye sensitivity."

GamerGhazi,3dlq4v,_Synesthesia_,4,Sat Jul 18 00:57:30 2015 UTC,"I meant that as a figure of speech. In the sense that if you show a game to people I do think 60 fps will be experienced as more pleasant than 30 fps, in the same way 30 fps is preferred to 15 fps. That's not to say you would want it at the cost of anything else."
GamerGhazi,3dlq4v,WhatABiscuit,-5,Fri Jul 17 14:10:13 2015 UTC,"That's fair enough.  However, framerate does have a stylistic impact.  60 fps gives something called the soap opera effect, where you lose the look of a soft 24fps, and everything looks like a home made vhs tape.  That movie with john cusack, 2012, had some scenes in it which were recorded at higher framerates, and the result is jarring as hell.    60 fps is not intrinsically better than anything. The simpsons are animated at 13 frames per second, if my memory doesn't fail me. Of course, the final product is on proper broadcast standards, but you get my deal."
GamerGhazi,3dlq4v,_Synesthesia_,9,Fri Jul 17 14:34:34 2015 UTC,"But the stylistic impact is cultural. It is not impossible to think that generations after us will have lost the soap opera association with high framerates (having seen many HFR films, and having grown up with games) and will regard 24 fps as 'old fashioned'.  I am not saying 60 fps is required, any more than 24 fps is required in the Simpsons. But it is something which can be 'better' in the sense that HD is 'better' than 800Ã600, or high bitrate audio is better than mp3. Some games, some animations, will not 'need' it."
GamerGhazi,3dlq4v,WhatABiscuit,3,Fri Jul 17 15:01:50 2015 UTC,"But the stylistic impact is cultural.   Absolutely, no discussion there. We agree.  I still believe ""better"" is a very charged word on these discussions. Yoshi's island has infinitely more beautiful art direction than, say, battlefield 4? And it was rendered on a minuscule resolution, while you can supersample whatever 3d game you want to whatever ludicrous number you want.   It's what works for a given moment in time. HD will be ""worse"" in the future, only in the sense that appliances will scale upwards in resolution. I think for competitive games a higher framerate is better for competitive purposes, and I enjoy smoother framerates for most of my games, but arguing that a current technical limitation is ""better"" than anything else sounds naive to me.   An aquaintance recently did a small spot for nickelodeon, where they did a hybrid of traditional, 12fps animation and traced them to 3d models. The result is an marvelous 12fps spot that works perfectly. It wouldn't be ""better"" if it was smoother."

GamerGhazi,3dlq4v,Mman235,5,Fri Jul 17 17:53:04 2015 UTC,"60 fps gives something called the soap opera effect, where you lose the look of a soft 24fps, and everything looks like a home made vhs tape.   That's complete bullshit."
GamerGhazi,3dlq4v,the_cants,4,Fri Jul 17 17:57:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that doesn't really apply to video games though. Or CGI movies, but let's focus on video games.  A game isn't rendered through a glass lens that causes the intentionally clean but soft visuals of modern HD 24FPS. The game's visuals are put together according to the designer's specifications and the user's selected options, so each frame of a game running at 10FPS can look as crisp and sharp as one running at 60FPS. It's going to be horrifyingly choppy, but still. You can get the look of a 24FPS classic movie in a game running at 60FPS and the hyperrealistic ""almost everything is always in focus"" feel of The Hobbit in a game running at 30FPS.  The framerate contributes mostly to smoothness of visuals, which the average person appreciates more in a game than a movie because a movie is passively watched, you look at almost the entire screen at all times (with the camera directing your focus as necessary) and it's usually live-action. In a video game, you personally change what you're focusing on as necessary, are an active participant and are expecting some level of stylistic variance from real life. So not only can the game devs employ cinematic tricks like altered FOV, changes in focus and other such things that traditionally don't work in raw 60FPS camera footage, but you're less likely to get overloaded by all the things because you're focusing on something in particular. And you're not going to get a disgusting amount of detail for random objects because the assets are not photorealistic."
GamerGhazi,3dlq4v,multiusedrone,8,Fri Jul 17 19:39:48 2015 UTC,"When did this sub suddenly turn into PCMR?  LEL!  But no yeah, 60 frames is objectively better than 30 most particularly when playing high-action titles such as an FPS.  Anyone that has had a lot of experience doing so can tell you this.  It's just a fact.  Does that mean 30 is ""unplayable""?  No, that's just hyperbole.  Just like it's ridiculous when people try to tell me that somehow 30 is more ""cinematic"".  Uh, okay, but I'm not watching a movie and 30 FPS when I'm playing shootmans doesn't feel more cinematic (it's apples/oranges) - just a little choppy.  Here's a very simplified example.  You can click 15, 30, and 60 frames and I can immediately tell the difference.  For my part, when I'm in a full-blown game trying to line up my crosshairs the difference is even more apparent.  Still completely playable, but apparent.  OP is right about input lag though.  Buttery smooth 60 frames won't yield you much in the way of a gameplay advantage over someone pushing only 30 if your input can't translate as smoothly."

To the creator of that video: LOL learn to metric system. That's 223ms, which means 0.223 seconds. A.k.a. 5 Frames per second. (It's a reaction time, not a framerate count at any rate).   That's appallingly embarrassing."
GamerGhazi,3dlq4v,PostModernismSaveUs,6,Fri Jul 17 13:30:09 2015 UTC,"Can someone explain to me why any modern games are being developed with the game logic tied to the framerate anyway? Lots of games function fine at any given framerate - so why would developers ever develop a game to work exclusively at a single setting? Is it easier, somehow?  As a person who bought a 144Hz screen specifically for gaming, I'd argue that it makes a huge difference for me in any game where fast visual feedback is important - for me that's counter-strike."
GamerGhazi,3dlq4v,SoftlyAdverse,21,Fri Jul 17 15:56:40 2015 UTC,"In order to achieve 60 FPS, the whole update loop needs to run at 60FPS, so that means AI, physics, gameplay, player controls   That's not true. Almost all modern titles decouple most of their systems from their visual update loop."
GamerGhazi,3dlq4v,trybius,3,Fri Jul 17 08:19:12 2015 UTC,"To some extent. A lot of synchronization is still necessary no matter what you do.  And if you don't change the underlying game state between frames, then sure, you might technically render 60 frames per second, but you might as well not. If you're just repeating the same frame because ""we haven't had time to process AI and physics"", then... don't bother.  If you want to be able to show something new 60 times per second, then you need the whole update loop to run at least 60 times per second. They don't have to run in the same thread, sure, and they might be decoupled in the code, but if the game state isn't updated 60 times per second, then you have no reason to render more frames. The frames you're drawing would just be a repeat of the previous one."
GamerGhazi,3dlq4v,no_real_username,7,Fri Jul 17 16:52:32 2015 UTC,"That makes very little sense.  Most systems are decoupled so they can run faster than the graphic update thread, not less.   And even if they didn't, you don't need the entire update loop to have finished to draw a frame - plenty of systems will use interpolation with various different strategies of smoothing if they were running lower than the actual frame rate."
GamerGhazi,3dlq4v,trybius,-1,Fri Jul 17 09:03:30 2015 UTC,"Most systems are decoupled so they can run faster than the graphic update thread, not less.    Yes, but in that case they still need to run at least at 60FPS.  Read your comment that I responded to. You said that it was ""not true"" that the entire update loop has to run at least 60FPS. As you just said now, the rest of the update loop is intended to run at least as fast as the rendering loop. Hence my response to your comment where you said the opposite. :)  As for interpolation, sure, kinda. You still need something to interpolate between. If you don't know what input you've gotten from the player or from AI, any interpolation would give pretty weird results. A frame where player input isn't processed is bad news. It's going to yield pretty wonky results and the player is going to hate the game far more than if it'd just rendered consistently at a lower framerate."
GamerGhazi,3dlq4v,no_real_username,6,Fri Jul 17 12:54:20 2015 UTC,"But things like physics and AI don't need to be updated at the maximum frame rate.  You do have information on where things are going. You know which direction the AI was going, and at what speed. So, you keep rendering that path, until new information is available about a changed path.   any interpolation would give pretty weird results.   Not really. If an object changes path, it has momentum, and it needs time to change that course.   The opposite is actually true. An AI that suddenly and instantaneously changed direction would be pretty weird. An interpolation from its old path to the new one would be much more natural.  And yes, a frame where user input is not processed is bad. Which is why these things get decoupled - and player input is processed at a much higher rate than things like environmental physics and AI pathfinding.  You want to process user input as fast as possible. The trajectory of a leaf blowing in the wind is not so important.   It's going to yield pretty wonky results and the player is going to hate the game far more than if it'd just rendered consistently at a lower framerate.   Spurious and unfounded conclusion."

Personally, as someone with an outdated PC, I'm perfectly fine with playing games at 30 FPS (and can manage as low as 25, though at that point it gets uncomfortable). Yes, there are games where 60 is definitely preferable (CS:GO, Heroes of the Storm, fighting games etc.), but I feel like the importance of it gets a bit overexaggerated when it comes to games that aren't animation-heavy or quick-paced.  Do games feel better to play at 60 FPS? No question. Do I need 60 FPS for Duels of the Plainswalkers? Not really, no.  Edit: As for my perception of 30 vs. 60, I've had a few experiences where a game that previously ran perfectly at 60 FPS locked itself to 30 after alt-tabbing from it and opening it up again, at which point it was really noticeable.  I also don't really get the current push for 60 FPS gameplay videos. From what I've seen and heard from other people who are more knowledgeable than I am, it doesn't really improve the experience of watching the video.

It should also be noted that games at 30FPS will also often use the extra effects processing to add something like motion blur effects.  Despite that, I still have trouble telling the 60 and 30 apart.  (I do notice the 15FPS is choppy).

I'm just adding to the discussion. :)  To be clear, I'm not in the industry, and I'm not that technical, but I know what works for me and what doesn't. A good game includes some sort of motion blurring to hide the ""choppy"" effect. Even in that 60fps version, I still see choppiness. I can't explain, in truly technical terms, what I'm getting at, but there's far more to the equation than 30fps vs 60fps, or 720p vs 1080p, or 35Mbps vs 10Mbps, etc. I guess I'm saying... those who are focusing solely on 30fps vs 60fps (and yeah, those folks are out there), really aren't looking at the full picture."

GamerGhazi,3dlq4v,Farlender,12,Fri Jul 17 19:47:03 2015 UTC,"The moment I loaded up that page I noticed 60 was on the right and 30 on the left. It was subtly visually different but mostly a more instinctual feeling. Watching/playing something in 60 FPS seems so much more responsive and I've maintained this long before I heard the opinions of people like TB, or the gaming community became obsessed with 60 FPS. Playing a 60 FPS game reminds me of watching a well-done, fluid combat scene in an anime; the motion itself is pleasing though I don't really understand why. This will probably sound odd but I will choose to play a 60FPS game over a 30FPS game just to get that feeling--I watch my favorite (fluid) anime scenes over and over for the same reason.    edit  Partly because traditionally PC games have had the advantage of 60FPS console games have lacked there is plenty of snobbery surrounding the issue of FPS. PC gaming master race etc etc blah blah. So I'd like to point out I'm not trying to be a smug ass when I say it genuinely surprises me that some people can't tell the difference but I also slightly envy them. Nowadays my computer is aging so I have to lock games at 30 if I can, and newer, graphically intensive, games tend to gravitate towards that number anyway. I wish I couldn't tell the difference so I'd have less reason to spend money on an upgrade."
GamerGhazi,3dlq4v,Meneth,3,Fri Jul 17 20:37:11 2015 UTC,The anime comparison makes sense because most characters move at 8-12fps regularly but fight scenes typically get a jump in frames.

Personally the actual metrics of framerate, while important to me, aren't as relevant IMO as the way in which TB has gone about this. He's presenting this as an attempt at being super objective and providing nothing but facts, but the actual list itself kinda comes across as developer-shaming. He's calling himself 'the framerate police' and pointing out games that don't meet his ideal.

You don't have to enjoy a game or agree with it being 30 over 60fps, but don't try and tell developers how to do the technical parts of their job.

This is fundamentally a problem with Steam's tag system.  If we could make tags like 30fps lock or fps lock we wouldn't need the curator service.  But Steam doesn't allow those tags so here we are.  Now the curator system is binary, you can either make a ""positive list"" or a ""negative list"". You can make a group with 60 fps and list all the games that run on 60 fps or higher, or make a 30 fps list and list all of those. Now I haven't done a complete survey of steam, but it seems like many more games offer 60 fps or unlocked frame rates than those locked to 30.  This makes it easier to make a list out games which are locked to 30 than those with better frame rates.  For the most part, I don't notice the difference between 30 and 60 fps (I know, I'm a monster) but I've still subscribed to the group because I want to be informed about the product I buy.  I see it more like a ""Warning: This product may contain nuts"" sticker.  I am warned that this product may or may not contain something that might not agree with me which allows me to make a more informed decision on my purchase.  There's nothing inherently ""wrong"" or ""shameful"" about the warning, until I apply it to my own viewpoint/reasoning."
GamerGhazi,3dlq4v,Agretlam343,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:58:55 2015 UTC,"For me, the fundamental issues are how/why is this being implemented, and what does it mean for developers and creators?  The implementation is my biggest concern, because of how Totalbiscuit has gone about this. He has a long history of railing against 30fps, claiming it comes down purely to 'inferior hardware' and poor design on the part of developers. He's also chosen to label this as the 'framerate police' which has very definite implications on how to view lower or capped framerates. If this was just an informative badge or label, that would be one thing, but I don't think that's what it is. It comes across as an attempt to frame a very nuanced debate from one side of the fence.   This then has knock on effects, I think, for developers. While most developers will go for uncapped framerates on PC, there are games which have capped framerates for very specific reasons. We're seeing more console games, particularly Japanese games, being ported to Steam. Having originated on fixed hardware, these games are much more likely to have game logic, physics etc tied directly to framerate. Upping the framerate either requires more development work, or means that certain game functions will be broken or run at double speed. Other games, in particular those made by indie  developers, may run on engines that lock the framerate at a lower speed. Hyper Light Drifter, for instance, is made with Game Maker, and runs at 30fps. The developers could have got the game to run at 60, but they decided that given the intricate nature of the 2D animation they're using, development would be smoother running at 30fps.   These are instances where developing the game for PC hardware around uncapped hardware simply isn't feasible. These are still great games. My worry is that the way this curator list is implemented, it's going to negatively tar and feather developers for either making different design choices, or for being unable to make significant changes to games that originated on other hardware."
GamerGhazi,3dlq4v,LordSepulchrave,4,Fri Jul 17 13:21:20 2015 UTC,"I'm curious why it's assumed that Frame rate police is a judgment.  The idea that there are actually police running around carting away developers for poor frame rate is laughable, which is what the name seems to be for me; and apparently what TB intended it to be.  You're second paragraph confuses me, because TFRP makes no judgments about the product, it only relays basic information.  Any further judgments are left to the consumer.  I don't give a damn the the Guild of Dungeoneering is locked at 30 fps so it won't influence my purchase.  I do care that Arkham Knight is locked to 30 and has frequent frame drops.  The context is important and is up to the consumer to weigh when buying the game.  I understand that hard-coding the game to match a fixed frame rate makes things easier, but it's also a lazy programming shortcut.  When I was learning the basics of what little programming I know my instructor said: ""You can use hard coding in your assignment, but you'll receive minimal marks because your code won't be able to react to a large range of inputs by the user"".  We had to weigh whether or not doing it the correct way was worth our time and effort for the marks.  There was no inherent judgment either way except that if you hard coded the assignment you were basically saying ""I don't care if the user experience is lessened because I can't/don't want to put the effort into doing it the ""better way"".   If the customer decides he doesn't want to purchase the product because a game is locked to 30 fps that's his decision.  It's harsh, but games are also a product and I'm spending money on them and if they aren't offering the experience I want/need than I don't want to spend my money on it, how hard the developer worked on it doesn't enter into my purchasing decision.  In the end I see TFRP no different than a ""Warning: May contain nuts"" sticker in which the organization supporting it has a puny name."
GamerGhazi,3dlq4v,AliceBones,2,Fri Jul 17 18:35:25 2015 UTC,"I would be very careful about saying anything here is 'lazy': again, many games on Steam tie physics and logic to framerate because they were originally console games. When you're working with consoles, you generally are aiming for a fixed framerate anyway, so tying logic to framerate provides some benefits for practically no trade-off. You're still seeing developers do this now on console titles like Halo 5 and TLOU.   Sure, it would be nice if all games were developed with uncapped framerates in mind, but a game like Valkyria Chronicles was originally intended as a PS3 exclusive, and only came to Steam years after the fact. To me, it's like complaining about a re-release of FF7 (no, not the remake) not having HD pre-rendered backgrounds. There was no way of them including them back in the day, and it's unreasonable to expect it now.   As a consumer, you're entitled to do what you like. My point of contention is that I think Totalbiscuit is being a bit of a dick about this."
GamerGhazi,3dlq4v,the_cants,5,Fri Jul 17 21:07:39 2015 UTC,"I considered rewriting the lazy bit but ultimately hard coding is a bit lazy.  You can have good, justifiable reasons for it but it's still lazy.  We're not talking about consoles, these are PC games. Different hardware, different standards.    Again, I don't see how ""TB is being a bit of a dick about it"".  I think it's a perfectly acceptable curation within the bounds of Steams limited structuring.  It seems like a completely objective listing of specifications, puny name aside.   Sure, it would be nice if all games were developed with uncapped framerates in mind, but a game like Valkyria Chronicles was originally intended as a PS3 exclusive, and only came to Steam years after the fact.   Valkyria Chronicles has a 120fps cap, did it run at 30 fps on consoles?"
GamerGhazi,3dlq4v,AliceBones,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:33:58 2015 UTC,"There were physics and collision issues running at higher framerates when the game first came out. They may have been patched since then, but the game didn't run flawlessly. Same with Dark Souls: even if you use the framerate-fix mod, there are issues with the game physics.   And I disagree. If there is a good, justifiable reason for doing something, it's not lazy. It's going with what works. There is nothing lazy about programming or designing games."
GamerGhazi,3dlq4v,the_cants,4,Fri Jul 17 23:16:51 2015 UTC,It isn't even truly objective unless you get motion sickness from it. It's quite possible not to care whether something is 30fps or 60fps.
GamerGhazi,3dlq4v,Net_Bastard,6,Fri Jul 17 23:37:06 2015 UTC,"It isn't even truly objective unless you get motion sickness from it.   Wouldn't that be the exact opposite of objective?   It's quite possible not to care whether something is 30fps or 60fps.   That's entirely possible, but has nothing to do with objectivity. That's like saying ""it's entirely possible to not care about the speed of light."" Sure, but that doesn't change the speed of light."

Yeah, probably, but it if's a physiological reaction and not a matter of taste, it's... probably still subjective? Yeah, bad argument.   But the speed of light and the number of frames are just numbers, like color choices. While 60fps is faster than 30fps, and light speed is faster than any vehicle we can build, it doesn't make one necessarily better. A better comparison would be, say, music production quality now versus the 90's. Sure, we can get bigger, clearer sounds than we could back then, but that doesn't necessarily make it better."

GamerGhazi,3dlq4v,bizude,6,Fri Jul 17 21:27:51 2015 UTC,"It has to do with vertical synchronization. It should match your monitor's refresh rate (or half of it), otherwise there is vertical tearing (it looks like your screen is literally being torn apart for a moment). Nowadays most monitors are 60hz or 120hz. If you don't mind tearing and the framerate's unlockable, then yeah, you can have any other number."
GamerGhazi,3dlq4v,wastedcleverusername,2,Fri Jul 17 13:54:55 2015 UTC,I see. Thanks.  Soâ¦ does that mean 75 or 37.5 is also technically possible?
GamerGhazi,3dlq4v,dreffen,5,Fri Jul 17 10:06:53 2015 UTC,Any framerate is theoretically possible. It depends on how fast your system can render.
GamerGhazi,3dlq4v,GatePleb,2,Fri Jul 17 10:16:09 2015 UTC,"Yes, and there are a fair number of 75hz monitors out there. When V-SYNC'd, if your FPS were to drop below 75, such a monitor would fall back to 37.5fps."
GamerGhazi,3dlq4v,RottenRedRod,3,Fri Jul 17 10:25:56 2015 UTC,"The AC power supply in many countries is 60 Hz, so there's some electrical engineering logic to having monitors run at 60 Hz as well."

GamerGhazi,3dlq4v,lighthaze,12,Sat Jul 18 04:15:30 2015 UTC,"I actually would like to see games journalists pay as much attention to Input Delay as they pay to Frames Per Second   Eh to be honest most real game journos don't care much about FPS, it's the Total Biscuit youtube crowd who get off on it.  I remember an interview with John Carmack a while back where he talked extensively about input delay and the trade offs of 60fps. This was in the build up to Rage, which made sacrifices to obtain 60fps that arguably weren't worth it.   Actually, funny story about input delay, remember when people were switching to HDTVs oh ten years ago, and HDTVs at the time didn't handle component cables well, and thus the TV itself would have a frame delay as it translated the signal? People had trouble noticing this with games like Prince of Persia--because there was a lot of built-in frame delay. But people noticed this very quickly with games like the NES Super Mario Bros, and Guitar Hero, as these games have zero frame delay.   Yeah it's the rhythm action games that really show it off. Parrappa the Rapper was unplayable at the time."
GamerGhazi,3dlq4v,Hammertofail,2,Fri Jul 17 20:19:43 2015 UTC,"It actually went the other way with me. My parents got a large flatscreen TV when they were new, and I hooked my PS2 up to it and played Mercenaries 1, a game with a considerable inherent input delay (but was still playable). That combined with the TV's input delay a delay that was about half a second behind my controls. Totally unplayable. Goes without saying that games that required much faster input delay were awful too. Guitar Hero in particular was agony to play on that thing. I ended up playing both games on my tiny CRT in my room instead. All I could play on that big TV were RPGs."
GamerGhazi,3dlq4v,Dissonanz,3,Fri Jul 17 16:39:41 2015 UTC,"I can definitely tell visually when a game has increased its framerate from the 30s to the 60s. I can even see it when I switch a twitch stream from high/medium to ""Source""; the framerate spikes up like crazy, gets way more smooth."
GamerGhazi,3dlq4v,WhatABiscuit,5,Fri Jul 17 10:45:51 2015 UTC,"I definitely agree with the OP that input delay should be a bigger factor. In some genres it already is, simracing comes to mind, then again, no serious simracer would play his game with less than 60fps."

GamerGhazi,3dlq4v,awa64,4,Fri Jul 17 14:11:24 2015 UTC,"60fps games (when meant to run that way) look amazing.  This would have been a great idea if it was about finding games that run at 30 where it matters but it's not because it requires a little more nuance than just blanketing any 30fps game with '30fps bad'.  Because when you take the shotgun approach you're lumping in the Jackbox Party Pack and Baldur's Gate with Arkham Knight.    Calling yourself the police, and throwing in 20 year old Saturn ports saying they're locked at 30 fps?  Oh boy thanks Total Biscuit, you're doing the Lord's work."

GamerGhazi,3dlq4v,awa64,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:03:49 2015 UTC,"The name's hardly that inflamatory. We're in a subreddit called GamerGhazi, so a jokey name shouldn't be that outlandish of an idea.  Look at it from his perspective - if he tries to apply his own judgment to what should or shouldn't be on the list, even more people are going to go up in arms over this. The ""objectivity"" here is a defense mechanism more than anything else. Just giving the basic facts is the safer option, althogh, maybe not the most productive one.  There are two points in the idea that deserve scrutiny. 1) Giving the buyer more (pertinent) information is always a good thing. If framerate is important to you, the curator creates value for you. If it's not, you're not even going to join it.   2) On the other hand, there's likely going be a shitty little reverse halo effect attached to this. For a lot of people 30 FPS is a pretty big downside (not to mention a lot of PC gamers have a very strong mental connection between 30FPS and ""crap PC port""). Just seeing the 30 FPS logo may well decrease the perceived value of the product. It must be noted, though, that this effect is going to be strongest for buyers with lower involvement - highly involved and knowledgable buyers might even be immune to this effect, since they rely on more specific signals (such as trailers, ratings and reviews, studio reputation, etc).  Ultimately, given the constraints of Valve's system, it's a trade off between 1) and 2). I, personally, think that supplying buyers with more information is worth it, given the cost. It'd be even better if Steam reinstated the FPS tags, although it is arguable whether they are as noticeable as curator icons. Not to mention that a lot of the enthusiasm over the Framerate Police may well just be backlash to game devs trying to pass off 30FPS as more cinematic and people getting rather sick of the BS.  I believe this whole thing could have been executed in a smarter way, but I don't expect it to last long."
GamerGhazi,3dlq4v,myGGthrowaway,-2,Fri Jul 17 18:46:05 2015 UTC,"The pro-circlejerk seems like yet another example of privileged gamer entitlement to me, demanding that since they spent so much money on a gaming PC all games should take advantage of the expensive hardware they bought. It's not like a game is suddenly unplayable at 30FPS, or even like 60FPS offers any concrete improvement over 30FPS. (It can correlate with lower input lag, but not always.) I think there's just as many people out there offput by 60FPS and its association with motion interpolation algorithms on high-refresh-rate TVs and cheaply-produced daytime television as there are who appreciate the marginal improvement in smoothnessâbut hey, like what you like, I'm not going to stop you.  But I'd rather have a game that works as the developers intended at a consistent 720p30 than a game that's buggy but can reach 1080p60 most of the time if you throw two Titans in SLI at the thing... mostly because that means a better experience for a wider audience. And I appreciate it if developers leave in the ability to unlock the framerate as a ""well, go ahead if you want, but we won't support it"" sort of option, but demanding a game must be able to run at 60FPS if I can throw enough hardware at it seems as childish as someone demanding a developer take out the gay characters because they think gay people are icky. At least asking for colorblind mode is fixing accessibility problems."

GamerGhazi,3dlq4v,PoliteTimesplitter,5,Fri Jul 17 13:24:18 2015 UTC,1) This isn't a boycott list. It's information on the frame rate and if it can be uncapped. 2)Frame rate is a more important feature to a lot of people.

Whether or not your eyes can tell the difference doesn't mean that there isn't one. My eyes can tell the difference albeit the difference between 60/144 is smaller than 30/60 which is quite noticable."
GamerGhazi,3dlq4v,warongiygas,10,Fri Jul 17 14:43:25 2015 UTC,"For some context on this, TotalBiscuit has started a second Steam Curation page, called Framerate Police. It exists solely to list games that are locked at 30fps and provide any information on whether or not it can be unlocked. And that's it. That's the entire page. It's a long list of: '30fps lock' '30fps lock' '30fps lock, can be unlocked via .ini edit'.  The problems with this are many. Yes, it's a response to Steam's tagging system not allowing the 30fps tag. But it's also...not curation. It's some kind of absurdist Hall of Shame. Curation shows you the good, not compiles a list of things of one thing you don't like. An actual curation list would show games that do have, and strongly benefit from, 60fps. If I want to know if a game is 30, I just scroll down the reviews very slightly.  It's also...so basic. There's no criticism beyond that. Yes, 60fps is nice. No, it's not deserving of a curation page with no other criticism. What's the context of that 30fps? Because he's got the fucking Jackbox Party Pack there. A god damn party game where you put your mates in a room and play with their phones and laugh. FF3 and FF4? Ugh, I need to know exactly when my ATB gauge fills up. I can't play my PC ports of DS remakes of 80s JRPGs at 30fps :(  It also demonstrates TB's lack of knowledge. He's highlighting Tomb Raider - not the reboot, the original - as one. 'Hey TB maybe this is silly, because it's fucking Windows 95 where 60fps was pretty much impossible. TB knows even fucking less about coding, game dev, engines, and working in the industry than a layperson like me. When he was (quite rightly) taking Koei to task over their dreadful ports, he said something along the lines of 'There is no excuse for game logic to run tied to framerate'.  Okay...have you ever spoken to people in the industry about framerate caps, coding, porting? Ever read something like OP? Ever even looked at a line of code? No? Then sit down, shut up, adjust your hat and educate yourself, even to a minimum degree, rather than sitting in front of your Death Rig 6000 and screaming 'lazy devs! Lazy devs! Laziness, I tell you!'  Here's a storify from someone who works in games explaining some more problems with this, more reasons why PC 60fps often doesn't work. Some choice quotes:   We have a problem with crunch in this industry. Massive problems with it. You want to talk to me about lazy developers, lazy coding? Get rid of crunch, give everyone some vague semblance of job security then we can talk lazy. Until then, folks bust asses to get things out.   But here's the thing, you've got x time, x money to bring something over from console. You've got x people to do the work. Balance that.  In a better, more sane industry, we'd allow time/money/manpower to sort these things out. This is not videogames. This is not our industry.  You do your best. You work with what you have to get the best thing you can out there. Sure, some don't. Most do. And it's compromises.  So no, I don't think it's harmless having a dude use a very prominent platform yelling about this stuff because it gives people weird ideas. And it's those weird ideas that are just little shitty things that make life in videogames worse. You can absolutely choose to not do that.   If you want to read more on crunch time in game dev, you can read this article from Jacobin I think the title, 'You Can Sleep Here All Night', gives you a taste of what's there. But back to particulars of frame rate, the OP mentioned The Last of Us, and that had some porting issues going from PS3 to PS4's remastered:   You see, the PlayStation 3 is a tricky piece of hardware, one for which The Last of Us ""was optimized on a binary level."" And even with some of the best engineers in the industry working on the project, ""just getting an image onscreen, even an inferior one with the shadows broken, lighting broken and with it crashing every 30 secondsâ¦ that took a long time.""   (the interview from Edge now just redirects to their review. Druckman makes a point it's a lot more complex than 'flipping a switch', and in some other interview I can't find, it's mentioned that 60fps, for a while, would absolutely destroy the physics on Joel's hair. Another example of unlocking going wrong without dev time)  It's weird that TB considers himself a 'consumer advocate' yet won't give the time of day to people on dev teams that are suffering because of publishers breathing down necks - one of the reasons why he can't have his beloved 60fps.  tl;dr TB had a decent idea but doesn't know what curation is, can't into context, doesn't know how dev works in the slightest, will one day have people thumbing their nose at him with 'ew? 60fps? Why not native 144fps?'"
GamerGhazi,3dlq4v,RhaganaDoomslayer,9,Fri Jul 17 14:31:26 2015 UTC,"For some context on this, TotalBiscuit has started a second Steam Curation page, called Framerate Police.   Ah, I actually didn't know the context.  All I did was notice that people were talking about framerate a lot recently.  (I got some of my sources back when I was following TB in November--like that video that thinks miliseconds are frames per second--got that from TB's twitter.  But I kinda stopped following TB when he piled on the wrong side of shirtgate; hi, TB, I have multiple Physics PhDs for friends, including astronomers--no, your opinion did not represent people in STEM)."

Just because you don't agree with the aspect they use to curate, does not mean it isn't curated.  I will say this, I think TB framed this all wrong and went about it in a hasty not completely thought out way. Some games frame timing matters more than others (fighters), others it is non-existent and frame rate and game timing is separate as it should be. Either way, objectively, more FPS is better, the downside to that is, some games move slow and thus really don't need much. I can play Civ V at 15 frames and not care. But I would never play BioShock at anything below 60. My preferred rate is 120 to match my monitor, it reduces my input lag and makes everything more sharp and less blurred."
GamerGhazi,3dlq4v,Cerus-,0,Fri Jul 17 11:22:39 2015 UTC,"I think the point here is, that PC gamers will happily wait for a good port, rather than get a half-baked one. Surely it's in the developers/publishers interest to do this also? eg. Get the console version done, then take your time with the PC port while getting revenue for the console versions, then get a renenue boost when you release the (better) PC version."

GamerGhazi,3dlq4v,taitaisanchez,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:17:48 2015 UTC,"I was answering separate things, but there's a lot to cover so I'll just dump it here.  The OP's point about input lag is technically true, but it seems to be talking about a separate issue and making a statement that's contradicted by every test I've seen (that framerate makes no difference to lag at all). Yes, engines have an inherent level of input lag that's also filtered through other sources of lag (like monitors), but that doesn't mean higher framerate doesn't contribute to lowering input lag. Of course framerate isn't the be-all end all of lag-the recent disaster Street Fighter 4 PS4 port being a good example-but it helps, and is the most easily controllable on the consumer end (with the arguable exception of VSync).  Higher framerates also allow for more granularity in stuff like animations; most engines have interpolation that makes framerate not matter for that to a degree, but there's still a difference when games are designed from the ground up for 60FPS, and it's very important in certain genres (where one frame can change everything) like Character Action and Fighting games. Of course this goes both ways, and in games without interpolation a 30FPS limit can be justified.  Entirely separating framerate and image quality is also somewhat of a false dichotomy, because in games with lots of motion 60FPS has greater temporal image quality than 30FPS; being the next Crysis only matters so much if a lot of the visual information is lost when things are moving. Films mostly look fine at 24FPS because the way they're filmed creates natural high-quality motion blur that covers up most of the temporal issues; by default games don't have that luxury, and it's only relatively recently that games have started to try and emulate this with motion blur (which can certainly make 30FPS look much smoother).  There is a degree of console vs PC to this; 30FPS console games are designed for that framerate so they tend to be much smoother feeling by default, conversely, due to other issues like frame pacing, a lot of PC games feel like absolute shit at 30FPS without some tweaking, which does give primarily PC players a higher natural negativity towards it (mouse control is also a place where higher FPS makes a very obvious difference to input, compared to a controller).  Honestly though my #1 issue is that ""30FPS target"" very rarely actually means 30FPS. Most 30FPS games consistently dip below that and into the 25 and lower region where the jerkiness gets impossible to ignore; if 30FPS games were locked to that 99% of the time I'd be far more accepting of it as a standard. Hell a few weeks ago I played Asura's Wrath and I missed QTE's purely because of how low and variable the framerate was at times. For a game that gets it right, Uncharted 2 consistently runs at 30 and only dips in the most intense situations, I might prefer it higher, but I'm perfectly fine with Uncharted 2's framerate because it very rarely draws attention to itself, unlike many other console games.  Rob's Storify is easily the best summary I've seen of the many legitimate reasons why 60FPS isn't practical a lot of the time, and why I think TB's thing is a good idea that's a bit misguided in execution. There are plenty of good reasons to not have 60FPS without sour grapes ""it's not that good anyway"" stuff (because in many cases, it is, just perhaps not as much as other things depending on the game's vision). I will however say I have little sympathy for games that consistently run below 30FPS.  Edit: and while it's unintentional a lot of this dismissal of FPS has a subtle strain of ableism in it. There are many who get legitimately ill when a game's framerate is too low for too long, and this applies to TB's FOV slider stuff too, as it outright makes him (and several other people) feel ill when it's too low, which makes the mocking kind of awkward to me."
GamerGhazi,3dlq4v,VoteRonaldRayGun,6,Sat Jul 18 01:41:34 2015 UTC,"Interesting points.   Higher framerates also allow for more granularity in stuff like animations; most engines have interpolation that makes framerate not matter for that to a degree   Basically every 3D game will have interpolation at some point--that point might be before the animation ever goes into the game.  But animators generally won't be doing 30 keyframes (or 60 keyframes) per second.  (Not just because of the insane amount of work on their end--also in many cases because the animation needs to be compressed).  That said, in many engines, going from 30 FPS to 60 FPS isn't a matter of just presssing a button for animations.  The animations would need to be re-exported, and ideally you would have an animator adjust the keyframes for 60 so that they look right.   Films mostly look fine at 24FPS because the way they're filmed creates natural high-quality motion blur that covers up most of the temporal issues   Blur is one of the special effects you can add with extra processing.  (And a lot of games do).   Honestly though my #1 issue is that ""30FPS target"" very rarely actually means 30FPS. Most 30FPS games consistently dip below that and into the 25 and lower region where the jerkiness gets impossible to ignore;   Oh for sure.  And this is arguably true (although not as big a problem) at 60 as well.  The human brain is very good at picking changes, so there are people who might not be able to easily tell the difference between a game running always at 60 and always at 30, but will notice if the framerate were to slip from 60 to 30 for a few frames."

Yeah this is what I meant with the animation stuff; animators aren't going to hand-make 60 frames of animation per second by hand (outside of exceptional circumstances anyway), but having 60 frames of animation a second vs 30 allows for a lot more flexibility if a game is made around it.   Oh for sure. And this is arguably true (although not as big a problem) at 60 as well.

Unfixed 60FPS certainly isn't optimal either (if the variance is bad enough it can even be worse than locked 30FPS), but I'd take it over unlocked 30.  Since you responded do you have anything that proves the thing about 60FPS not affecting input lag? I was kind of flippant about that to someone else above about it and I apologise to them for that but it seems to go against everything I've read about how input works, but if there's some reliably sourced breakdown of it I might rethink that. I mean it wouldn't change that I think that 60FPS feels much better, but it would make me rephrase it in terms of general responsiveness rather than input lag."
GamerGhazi,3dlq4v,Meneth,2,Fri Jul 17 14:21:23 2015 UTC,"Since you responded do you have anything that proves the thing about 60FPS not affecting input lag?    It will to an extent, obviously.  If you are at 30FPS, it can be 33ms or more before things appear on screen even if the game is programmed flawlessly.  But the kind of games where people build this stacking update, where a system will take a full 30ms to update, and then pass that information off to the renderer, and then the renderer will take another 30ms before it appears on screen--the kind of games where you see 100ms level input lags.  These games are just plain doing a lot of processing (100ms of processing) before things appear on screen.  And they're taking advantage of parallelism (information from several frames ago is still getting processed).  Let's say you double the number of CPU cores and get yourself a second GPU so that you can process twice as many frames in parallel--congratulations, you now have 60FPS, but your input delay is still 100ms.  In terms of ""but if you were to change your code, art, animation, and rendering to update twice as fast"", though, sure: then you would have a 50ms input delay.  What makes this complicated is that certain kinds of games do care about input delay, and these tend to be the same kinds of games that aim for 60 FPS.  Fighting games, first person shooters, music games.  So on the consumer end, you will see a lot more 30 FPS games with significant input delay, and 60 FPS games with very low input delay.  This doesn't meant that ""make it 60 FPS"" is necessarily the cure, however, when the games with longer input lags are using multithreading to process multiple frames in parallel."
GamerGhazi,3dlq4v,multiplethrows,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:15:38 2015 UTC,"Thanks, so it kind of depends on the game (and there's a sort of chicken or the egg thing going on where developers who focus on high FPS also tend to focus on low input lag).  I'll definitely cover FPS more in terms of responsiveness then, since the input lag part is far too variable from game to game."

If the tests you've seen contradict actual professional game developers describing how actual real games work, then have you considered that maybe the flaw is not with the actual professional game developer? ;)  No, it's not a separate issue. Games often start rendering each frame before the previous one has completed, to exploit the parallelism available on the GPU. That effectively means each frame is based on outdated game data. At 60FPS you have to present a new frame every 16.6ms. But each frame can easily have been in progress for twice as long (or more). It may be based on game state from 50ms ago, and it's just been rendering in parallel with the last two frames. In that case, rendering adds 50ms of input lag, rather than the 16.6ms you'd naively expect.  The higher the framerate gets, the more frames you may have to render in parallel, because each frame still needs the same amount of processing. In that case, your input lag won't go down at higher framerates. It might stay the same, but it's also possible that it'll go up (because having to render a larger number of frames may just slow down the rendering of each individual frame, so it has to be started even earlier)"

The only reason to have it is if the game requires very fast reactions, then yeah a higher fps will help (Eg Counterstrike). I don't doubt 60fps can look slightly smoother but there are things I'm far more worried about, and I won't care when playing.  If I'm not playing some competitive first person shooter then I've never seen fps matter. At this rate people on Reddit are going to complain about the fps in the next Civilization game."
GamerGhazi,3dlq4v,DrakosAmatras,13,Fri Jul 17 16:26:22 2015 UTC,30fps vs 60fps has never been about the image quality   Higher framerate does improve image quality though (if a game has lots of motion); the lower the framerate the more image data you lose when things are in motion. A major reason (beyond less input lag) higher framerate is so important in fast-paced games is because it's makes things so much easier to make out while in motion.
GamerGhazi,3dlq4v,poptartosis,5,Fri Jul 17 14:48:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah. If all that was sacrificed by going from 60 to 30 FPS was an extremely slight difference in visual smoothness, I'd take that sacrifice every single time to get better visuals. Doubling the AA unless it's already very high will make more of a visible difference than halving the frame rate (not that doubling the AA alone is gonna even remotely halve the frame rate).  The real issue is the tie between frame rate and input."

The same game running on a magic supercomputer where 60fps is achievable with no compromises or sacrifices, and in a parallel universe where the developer could afford to allocate the additional development time?  That's not a very relevant comparison, is it?  Would a game that currently runs at 30FPS ""look noticeably better and make for a noticeably more enjoyable experience"" if it had to target 60FPS *under all the same constraints, targeting the same hardware and on the same budget?  Would it be more enjoyable if the input lag was higher? If the resolution was lower? If the game was buggier because the programmers had had to spend more time optimizing and tweaking the rendering performance? If the game world was smaller? If graphical features had been disabled to speed up rendering?  Because those are the tradeoffs the game developers have to make. In reducing the amount of time you have to render each frame, you reduce how much can be rendered. So you have to make cuts and simplify. You'll make the game look and play worse in some ways, in order to make it look and play better in others.

You're assuming that they can just flick the 60fps switch and everything will magically run more smoothly with literally no downside.  That's not how it works.  A higher framerate has a cost. The developers look at that cost,  and decide whether to pay it. Sometimes, the cost may be so high that they determine it's not worth it. Sometimes, the game is better at 30FPS because too much would have to be cut or disabled in order to improve the framerate.

Because in a video game the visuals have to respond to player input you need a much higher framerate for the experience to feel smooth (or even tolerable - just imagine playing games at 16 FPS).

GamerGhazi,3dlq4v,Racecarlock,1 point,Fri Jul 17 09:49:13 2015 UTC,"Movies shot at 24fps do look incredibly shitty for scenes with lots of motion. Look at a fast camera pan, for example - everything turns into a blurry mess.  Even static shots suffer. Scenes with lots of white in them are an obvious one. A common example is an outdoor shot with lots of overcast sky in the frame. You'll see the sky flickering annoyingly because of the way the shutter works at such low frame rates."

I mean, I appreciate it, but to me - I'll take a reliable 30 FPS console game than a 60 FPS pc game that lags to 40, even if the frames are faster, that's a jolt I could see.  Plus, I never got the hate dmc got for being 30 fps on its original console release."

I mean I can just barely tell the difference myself, and I suspect if most people were just told ""No, yeah, that's 60"" they'd agree with it.

GamerGhazi,3dlq4v,Mman235,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:44:32 2015 UTC,"In terms of whether someone will notice 30FPS vs 60FPS...it actually varies by the human.   This is anecdotal evidence but the majority of people that I've come across can see the difference. I couldn't tell you exactly how many frames something is running at but playing a game for a minute or so, I could easily tell you that it's running at 30 or less.  I think that in terms of emphasizing FPS, the 60 FPS standard is aiming a bit high (I assume we're aiming for it because of the basic 60Hz refresh rate?), but I feel like aiming for 45 would be more than good enough too.  I'm still of the opinion that for certain types of games on the PC, 30 is too low. I played a lot of Unreal Tournament back in the day and unless my FPS was over 30, I wasn't getting those twitchy as hell hits.  That being said, I'm wondering if the input delay thing applies on a PC? I have noticed a lot of console ports feel, as I've come to call them, ""sluggish like a console"". I already don't really like console gaming as it is but it makes me reluctant to invest in ports of games that were designed with consoles as the main audience. Is this part of the same thing?"

I don't even have the soul in me to pick apart the whole pile of shit, it's the whole ""not even wrong"" thing where it's such a mess you can't make a counter. Pidgeons playing Chess and whatnot. So here's a few choice quotes, from a man who is, I insist you bear in mind, PAID IN ACTUAL EARTH-MONEY to write this way. You've been warned.   Perhaps being gay means I have a girl brain and Iâm not as good at problem-solving, puzzles and systematised thinking, because the only person I know of who was even more hopeless at it was iJustine.  Imagine a Twilight novel in which readers had to complete a quiz at the end of each chapter to unlock the next one. Millions of oversexed housewives would be straight out of luck.  I hope the majority of the soldiers assigned to my X-Com squad were liberals, or at least Celine Dion fans, because they got a guaranteed ticket to an early grave.   Unlike so many critics of gamers and game culture, I donât despise things I canât do or ask for new rules just for me: I admire those who succeed.  If I wanted to luxuriate in long cut scenes, there are paid websites for that. So-called LCD players, often filthy second-rate peasants on consoles, well. They just bring the tone of the neighbourhood. (See? Even as a gamer I can still be a snob.)  Gamers needing explicit instructions to progress through a game is part of a worrying trend that includes the idea of skippable combat to get directly back to the, erm, scintillating dialogue and story. (Which typically, Iâm sorry to say, makes 50 Shades look like Shakespeare).  These two particular games utterly fail at creating a compelling story or engaging and challenging the player. I imagine they are birthed out of a frustration at being laughed out of film or art school.  I guess video games seem an easy, trendy place for middle-class anxiety merchants and professional panickers to release their âtransmediaâ experiments. That might have been true if they werenât seriously asking $20 for the privilege of beta-testing [sic] their new womenâs studies essay on our downtime.  Games function as escapism. Many of the people who play them are escaping from the harsh vicissitudes of the real world, letting off steam in a safe virtual environment. The last thing they want is to have white guilt foisted on them by social justice warriors.  Imagine the poor garbage man spending twelve hours a day slinging sacks of trust fund refuse only to come home to their intellectual effluvient on his computer screen. For the love of God, let the poor man ogle at some breasts and shoot a few Nazis.  You can urinate on me, decapitate me and kick around my dismembered limbs in Postal 2: Paradise Lost, but I donât make a fuss no matter whoâs doing the kicking or why."

What? You seriously expect me to believe you played through X-Com and the best anecdote you got from the whole experience was ""hyar hyar they all died""?  When I played X-Com, I ended up with the story of the brave assault sergeant who deliberately ran up to point-blank range to a chrysalid in order to save a rookie. It didn't work, and the poor rookie had to flee both the chryssalid and her sergeant's newly animated corpse before the bombers arrived and sterilized the area.   That very rookie later went on to become a heavy, and the first to volunteer for ""enhancement"", and served as the teams cyborg-tank for the remainder of the game, taking bullets herself so nobody else would ever have to die for her again."

While the engine is old and the combats sometimes feel forcefed, apart from the combat it's really one of the greatest games ever. GOG has it, and it's definately worth a playthrough (or over a dozen, in my case; that game taught me more English than school did during those years).

GamerGhazi,3dmz0u,Cruven,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:56:35 2015 UTC,"Some things are similar and some are not. Do you know why you didn't get into BG? When you say you're not good at crpgs, it sounds like you found it too difficult in terms of combat et cetera - Planescape is both simpler and easier. Some things that are different:   Far less deadly. BG1 is notorious in that from the get-go a random arrow can and will kill you. Less bland setting. The sword coast of BG is really stereotypical high fantasy, Sigil is something very different; a city in the middle of the multiverse, connected to every plane of existence, where even Gods lose their powers and belief has direct, tangible power. Better written dialogue (but more of it). If you found BG to dialogue-heavy, you'll not like Planescape. I do find that it has a better journal system though, so you don't have to keep as much in memory. More ""smooth"" asthetics. Don't know how to explain it really, but the graphics are less intense while still being a lot more beautiful (IMO) than most of the areas of BG1. Less focus on mechanics. You have less available classes, and you choose class as you go along instead of at character creation. Lesser number (but more well-developed) side characters of less different classes. Less weapons and spells to choose from."

Although from what I've read, Jarhead apparently makes war look incredibly unappealing by simply showing that many people never see any action.  I disagree that objectivism is so inherently awful that it can't be presented any other way, but I do think it says a lot about the philosophy that nearly every attempt to present such a society ends up turning into an argument against it whether the creator intends to or not."
GamerGhazi,3dmz0u,KingWumpus,3,Sat Jul 18 00:13:40 2015 UTC,"The only way to make objectivism look good is to deny what it is, which admittedly isn't too hard considering how it's full of logical contradictions. Displaying anything accurately means displaying its upsides and downsides, and objectivism's upsides are so limited compared to its far more extensive downsides, so unless you're going into it with a perspective already skewed in favor of it, most depictions of it are going to look like they're portraying it in a negative light."

GamerGhazi,3dmz0u,SocialJusticeMace,2,Sat Jul 18 13:23:08 2015 UTC,"The Witcher, really? Ok, I'll be honest, I've only played the first hour of The Witcher 2 and stopped after 5:55's scene in this video, showing a fully naked hot woman, vagina and all (shaved no less), with the main character who is only naked from the waist up and has no animated nipples the morning after they clearly had sex, which he would not have worn underwear for but still has them on for some reason. Some dude walks in, sees her, and stares at her while trying to talk to the main character at the same time, obviously very turned on by her naked body, and ends up talking to her instead because she has his real attention. The camera pays special attention to her naked body at the very beginning of the scene. I stopped playing immediately after this scene because I got really uncomfortable. I have no problem with nudity, especially for female breasts because they seriously need to stop being so taboo to see, but why only her naked? They had sex, he should be naked too. Why have the other dude stare at her to make it even worse? It only showed that anyone outside the straight male category was not the game's target audience. Not only that, but it's not good writing, because it's set up to be a trap to see a sexualized woman for the sake of it. I didn't know anything about The Witcher series and just jumped right into the second one so I didn't know what I was getting into, but that killed it for me. Are there any actual choices in The Witcher series that has an impact on the plot? Does the writing get any better than that scene right there?"
GamerGhazi,3dmz0u,HiNutty94,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:07:57 2015 UTC,"You should google ""The Witcher"" and ""sex cards"" to find out more. :P  But anyway, TW does have solid writing, but the series always suffered from being basically a giant straight-male fantasy (and I don't mean the fact that the game world can be horribly sexist itself, I'm fine with that. It's an horrible place with poverty, famine and racism, so it does make sense, and it's not like the game doesn't address these stuff)  It gets a bit better as your progress through the games. TW3 has some great female characters like Yen and Keira, but it also makes clear they are masturbatory fantasy fantasies for boys."
GamerGhazi,3dmz0u,GearyDigit,2,Sat Jul 18 15:31:30 2015 UTC,"The games sound great from what you describe, but it makes me wonder why they bother with having that male fantasy element at all. It seems great on its own, it doesn't need it. It's like how Mass Effect 2 has shots of Miranda's ass everywhere even if you play as a female character. It's kinda funny to watch from that perspective but also sad because it's thoughtlessly put in and unnecessary. Damn you EA! Maybe I'll look into TW and give it another shot."

Like, no change of clothes for the battle field? Or casual encounters? Because that looks like an outfit the would be used in the bedroom maybe, if you catch my drift. She had a decent character to build upon if carried out well but it boiled down to ""I'm perfect. Look at my ass."" That's her only real purpose for being there."
GamerGhazi,3dmz0u,PostModernismSaveUs,2,Sat Jul 18 21:27:55 2015 UTC,"If it comforts you, Witcher 3 has astoundly less sex scenes, and Geralt's butt is visible sometimes cuz equality and stuff.

They listen to the fans, even the ones that don't have a lot of voice and they realistically could ignore."

Most objections to hate or misguided e-mail campaigns against them has been a matter of the hate being more about sticking it to a site criticizing hateful people in GG(or on the chans or in the Republican Party) and possibly saying progressive or feminist things at times than genuine concern over actual ethical concerns.  I've criticized Gawker for years and successfully pushed for some actual reforms on affiliated sites, but many GGers still called me a ""Gawker shill"" for objecting to their ridiculous reasons for hating and hounding them and their writers last Fall.  No one needs help disliking them or learning more about how idiotic, immoral, sexist, and homophobic Gawker prime is at times.  I will continue to object to misguided and regressive reasons to hate or harass Gawker or anyone else, not to the idea of disliking or criticizing them."
GamerGhazi,3dktvr,TellahTruth,2,Fri Jul 17 07:41:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah, this is one of like three legitimate gripes where I support the destruction of Gawker for the actions of their writers.  GG can claim this is what they were talking about the whole time (like they are), but the reality is the other 99% of their problems with Gawker are complete horseshit.  I don't like the site or their work or most of their other brands like a lot of other people, but to pretend this justifies the previous year of targeted hatred under the most spurious of pretense is dangerous.  This will only encourage other campaigns to prove guilty prior to committing a crime.  The people responsible for this should be held accountable to the fullest extent of the law, and the publication should face severe penalty for fostering an environment where this behavior was acceptable.  That doesn't mean you get to harass people who work at a video game site because you don't like them.  What GG has been fighting for all along continues to be bullshit, and nothing about this changes that."

The only possible justification would be if this executive did agree to use his sway to get political action, but that's a huge if. And ultimately, it appears to have just been blackmail that Gawker has now rewarded.  This is distinctly unethical trash masquerading as news.  Sargent should be fired and his direct editor let go or suspended.  This shouldn't be acceptable at any outlet, let alone one claiming to be ""progressive"" in any way."

Putting on and off such identities is a hallmark of chan culture, and it has been alive and well within GG from the beginning.   The fact is, while some trolls do exist, most of the trolling, shitposting, and harassment has been done by GGers convinced that they are justified to act that way as part of the collective GG effort.  To strictly delineate between GGers and GG-like trolls is counter to the reality of the sorts of varied actions by most of the anonymous people that have been wrapped up in GG over the last year."

I've always considered Gawker a borderline case; their CEO Nick Denton is an entrepreneur above all else and has no conscience about what is published on the site. But he's a savvy enough businessman to know that his target audience will not stand for pure Page 6 muck-raking, and generally employs the kind of people that have enough intelligence and empathy to steer clear of that stuff (even though they may skirt the line sometimes).  The fact that this got published wouldn't be that surprising if it slipped by their notoriously lax editorial oversight. But that the editor and other Gawker writers immediately defend it?

That's fucking Olympic-level cognitive dissonance suppression.  Gee, I wonder what the difference is.  Couldn't possibly be that one of them said bad things about GG, while the other allied itself with GG from the start, could it?  Not to mention GG's long and storied history of doing exactly what Gawker is doing here: ""outing"" people for the purpose of smearing them.  Hell, that's how GG started, and the faux-outrage GG is generating about this incident is a microcosm of GG as a whole.

Where are the exhaustive ""Digs"" into years and years of Twitter histories of Brietbart employees and accompanying red-arrowed MSPaints unraveling labyrinthine postulated conspiracies?  Not that I want to see any of those things - they're all petulant and ineffective ways to deal with actual suspicions of impropriety, with many crossing the line into abusive behavior.

Rodger didnât kill because the video games made violent, but the games did help to shape his violent fantasies. They provided a framework through which his online bloodlust turned into real-world slaughter.  Iâm more relaxed about violent video games than most, because it seems unlikely that they alone make people act out in real life. So what if theyâre the last resort of the frustrated beta male?

There's the Shirley Sherrod controversy, in which another heavily edited segment of a speech she gave was made to paint her as a racist, targeting the NAACP for giving a ""racist"" an award.  There's the smearing of Chuck Hagel as a member of a fictitious group called the ""Friends of Hamas"".  And that's just off the top of my head.  All three examples not just of scummy or borderline behavior, but aggressively deceitful pieces designed as capital-B-L Big Lies to smear people for strictly political, strictly partisan reasons (Hagel is/was a Republican, but widely castigated as a RINO and not popular in far-right circles).  It's weird.  Seeing as how I'm unabashedly in opposition to such a valiant group of crusaders for journalistic ethics as GG, you wouldn't think I'd be the one who could pull examples of actual journalistic impropriety (remember those?) off the top of my head.  And rest assured, the list of their misdeeds goes much deeper.  Can you begin to understand how GG's completely uncritical acceptance of Brietbart as an ally kind-of-sort-of worked to undermine the perception that they were legitimately a group that cares fuck-all about journalistic ethics, except insofar as accusations of impropriety could be used as a weapon to attack their enemies?"

GGers have already given me plenty of crap today, and many have responded to this story on Twitter in embarrassing fashion. Criticizing GG's ethical issues and general nonsense goes hand in hand with this. They come from a similar well of prejudice and poor judgment."

That said, feel free to report trolls to our troll police (sorry on phone, can't link).  I can speak for myself and can say that I haven't harassed anyone. You'll find that most of us on kia are equally reasonable.  Alright back to business. Fuck Gawker."
GamerGhazi,3dktvr,SasquatchGenocide,38,Fri Jul 17 14:38:55 2015 UTC,I mean I think most people here would admit that Gawker and Jezebel are pretty terrible. Just not for the reasons gaters think. Here's an archive link for those curious. https://archive.is/EUkg0  I stopped reading the Gawker family years ago with the exception of Lifehacker which is actually a pretty good blog.
GamerGhazi,3dktvr,Mr_Holmes,21,Sat Jul 18 23:03:00 2015 UTC,"A lot of Gawker network sites would be better off separate from their parent.  For all its posturing, Gawker still has a less than firm leg to stand on when it comes to actually being ethical.  Heck, ""decent"" even seems difficult at times.   Which is a shame, as some of their writers are okay, and some of their affiliated sites are quite good.  Yet, this kind of trash is routine and deplorable.  I hope this serves as just another example to help convince more Gawker network sites to go solo."
GamerGhazi,3dktvr,TellahTruth,8,Fri Jul 17 02:24:43 2015 UTC,A lot of Gawker network sites would be better off separate from their parent.   That's my view when I think about it. Let the good parts break off and the bad collapse and set themselves on fire.

GamerGhazi,3dktvr,A_Fhaol_Bhig,5,Fri Jul 17 22:00:52 2015 UTC,"I always found that funny, as well. I got called a Gawker shill last Fall despite years of complaints about them and actual, substantive efforts that resulted in improvements on Gawker network sites.  I may defend some of their affiliated sites, but the Gawker mothership is far too often reprehensible."
GamerGhazi,3dktvr,TellahTruth,3,Fri Jul 17 04:48:13 2015 UTC,"Jezebel's gotten a lot worse over time as Gawker has tightened the reins on them. I was a commenting regular back in like 2008-2010 when it was still fairly decent, when they had rules about not fat-shaming or slut-shaming women*, before they went full tabloid.  *Idk, maybe they still have those rules, but I've seen a lot more stuff I'd never have expected from my time there. Also the Kinja commenting system pretty much destroyed the community as we knew it, by removing its protections against MRA trolls from the other Gawker sites.   (Weirdly, a lot of them came from Deadspin and Kotaku. Times sure have changed...)"
GamerGhazi,3dktvr,tochterauselysium,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:01:46 2015 UTC,"Uck, I do hate the MRA trolls that spewed in.  That has at least improved since last Fall.  Jezebel has been pushing for more tools and more autonomy, and they fortunately seem to have made some progress on that.  Still not perfect, but at least better than the darker times."
GamerGhazi,3dktvr,TellahTruth,10,Fri Jul 17 06:17:17 2015 UTC,Gawker and Jezebel are the same group? Huh... that explains a lot.   This is disgusting :(

GamerGhazi,3dktvr,srhbutts,9,Fri Jul 17 03:40:54 2015 UTC,I wish they would drop the celeb talk from Jezebel. They've got some great articles padded with gossip about celebrities that I'd really rather not read. Tabloid culture is gross;
GamerGhazi,3dktvr,freebsdgirl,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:01:41 2015 UTC,"To me, a lot of that ties into the main Gawker's influence on them.  The idea of nothing being out of bounds with a celebrity or wealthy individual is a Gawker principle, and for a site like Jezebel, it's unfortunate when they fall into that, as well.  Jezebel seems best when it doesn't just act like a tabloid and actually addresses topics in a mature way.  I have a feeling Jezebel would move away from that if they were to ever split off."
GamerGhazi,3dktvr,TellahTruth,1 point,Fri Jul 17 10:02:39 2015 UTC,Isn't Jezebel created to try and bring feminist issues to a mainstream women's gossip magazine type audience?

Stories need a public interest and individuals don't forfeit the right to a private life by being famous or rich.  There is absolutely no public interest being exposed here.  No malpractice or immorality has been exposed.  All that has happened is a closeted gay man has been humiliated.  If you want crack open someone's private life, you need to show that they've done something unethical to deserve it, which Gawker has singularly failed to do.  Hell, even GG's founding legend would have managed that had it actually, y'know, been true."

It'd still be borderline (to me), but I think there'd be a much better case for publishing.  Clarity edit: it'd still be shitty to use unsubstantiated rumors to out a closeted gay man, but there would be at least be an argument for public interest if he used his political/professional contacts to reopen an investigation."
GamerGhazi,3dktvr,sinnodrak,10,Fri Jul 17 13:03:38 2015 UTC,"Hey look something ""GG"" and their ""Anti-GG"" can agree with - Gawker did something terrible and I'm pretty sure there could be a lawsuit happening.  Just, in general, wtf?"
GamerGhazi,3dktvr,jordha,17,Fri Jul 17 16:09:33 2015 UTC,"Not to go conspiracy on you all, but Conde Nast has holdings in what are essentially gawker competitors.  They published a seemingly unsubstantiated gossip about the sex life of an executive to a company that owns (partially) their professional rivals.  Any one of these things (outing gay man, aiding blackmailing, publishing unsubstantiated rumors about a competitor) are pretty shitty. Combine all three and you have some sort of trifecta of being a complete piece of shit."
GamerGhazi,3dktvr,sinnodrak,2,Fri Jul 17 06:45:00 2015 UTC,It almost seems like it should be illegal to in bad faith expose true information about someone in an attempt to shame them and hurt their business when they're a competitor.
GamerGhazi,3dktvr,OpinionKid,2,Fri Jul 17 03:31:42 2015 UTC,Sounds like you're pretty much describing blackmail which is pretty damn illegal.

Also according to this he's denying the allegations which in that case would place it under libel which also would open them up to a lawsuit."
GamerGhazi,3dktvr,True_Patrician,8,Fri Jul 17 21:21:17 2015 UTC,"I don't give Gawker a free pass. I thought them using their platform to show a video of Hulk Hogan having sex against his wishes was vile and I'm not a fan of wrestling or Hulk. It's shitty, despicable behavior. Behavior that their own journalists have called out in others before and behavior that they shouldn't be engaging in.  This is just another example of the owners of that website engaging in the worst sort of muckraking. Screw 'em, their coverage of reddit engaging in similarly shitty behaviors does not earn them a free pass!"
GamerGhazi,3dktvr,TolPM71,15,Fri Jul 17 21:33:11 2015 UTC,"Heh, I was laughing just earlier today about how Gawker was raking Reddit over the coals for its new ""hide it under the rug"" policy regarding white supremacy subs...  Why's that funny, you ask?  Because when Gawker was having a huge problem with racism, sexism, homophobia, etc. they developed a system where posts would stay greyed out (not viewable unless you opted in) until approved by an approved poster.  Sound familiar? It should, because it's damn near identical to what Reddit is doing.  Insert something about a pot and a kettle here."
GamerGhazi,3dktvr,Caelrie,0,Fri Jul 17 09:16:23 2015 UTC,"To be fair, Gawker's Kinja system works far better at actually striking that stuff down and helping people avoid it, and they do have a reporting and moderation system on top of that. (well, at least ever since Jezebel and other employees demanded they eventually address problems in the site's comment sections)"
GamerGhazi,3dktvr,TellahTruth,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:26:36 2015 UTC,"The greyed-out posts can also be deleted iirc.   Or at least, that's how it was during the pre-Kinja system. Not sure if they reintroduced that when Jezebel complained about how Kinja was allowing too many trolls into the site."
GamerGhazi,3dktvr,tochterauselysium,2,Fri Jul 17 03:54:03 2015 UTC,That is the case. All comments can be reported and deleted.  They seem to actually be trying nowadays.
GamerGhazi,3dktvr,TellahTruth,14,Fri Jul 17 06:23:43 2015 UTC,"Might I also mention that it is quite gross that basically the -only- comments on the article not complaining about how unethical and repulsive this is are the ones currently highlighted.    There are over a 1000 comments railing against how awful and homophobic this is, and not one is represented by default.  This is an example of when comments curation goes wrong."
GamerGhazi,3dktvr,TellahTruth,5,Fri Jul 17 07:10:53 2015 UTC,"On the Jezebel side, commenters on completely unrelated articles are criticizing Gawker's piece, and getting highly upvoted. See here:   Off-topic: Jezebel, I love you, but what the hell is going on at Gawker Headquarters? There needs to be a statement/apology for the David Geithner story. I feel dirty coming here now...   Also:   Having a bout of skepticism regarding this siteâs social justice orientation as long as the blackmailing-and-outing Gawker story stays up, and Jez writers defend it. Do you defend it Ms Lodi, like your colleague N Vargas Cooper?   Here's hoping the revolt from Gawker's readership prompts an apology."
GamerGhazi,3dktvr,-Guardsman-,2,Fri Jul 17 04:19:01 2015 UTC,This is an example of why comments should always be curated by the users and community at large and never by a single entity in charge
GamerGhazi,3dktvr,te-na-cious,4,Fri Jul 17 15:13:42 2015 UTC,"Lol no it's not. You can't really use the commenting system of a shitty blog as evidence of how all subreddits should be run. Personally I am okay with the mods work in here or /r/askscience or /r/AskHistorians for example (aka, mods adept in the arts of ""censorship""). Without the mods, those communities would definitely be worse off."

Many GGers have seemed to assume that those criticizing their prejudice and harassment somehow regard everyone criticizing them as perfect and beyond reproach, but that's not true at all.  Criticizing blatant sexism and cruelty is just basic decency, and even some rather awful people can see how wretched many GGers' views and actions are.  It reminds me of the American Civil War.  In it, white Northerners rightly condemned white Southerners as racists defending an inhuman system of racial slavery. Yet, at the same time and for years to come, most still supported racial segregation.  Their objections to the South were well-founded, but it did not mean they were free of their own moral corruption and prejudice."

Side note can I point out that this is exactly the sort of article Gamer Gate wanted folks like Kotaku to publish about Zoe Quinn?

I've seen this nonsense bloom and grow from the very beginning almost a year ago.  If you think there's any actual ethics going on with how most of GG has conducted itself, you're unfortunately fooling yourself.  I can't even imagine how a reasonable person at this point could possibly still align themselves with such a trash brand of destructive, counter-productive garbage.  I mention brigaders because the fact is, GGers have been brigading this sub and other subs for months, and as always, when the flood comes in, it's about manipulating information to potentially suit their preferred narrative.  It's conspiracy theorist 101.  If you're still involved in GG at this point and think you can salvage any kind of decent thing out of the trash heap it has been for almost a year now, I hardly even know what to say.  It continues to be a waste of your and others' time, and unfortunately, you will very likely regret these days in years to come.    Please get out sooner rather than later."

I stay away from the tag unless I have a reason to use it, I still network with other GGers but I refrain from using the tag unless I'm actually talking about ethics because that's what GG is built upon    I'm not the sort of person to follow people like milo yiannopolous"
GamerGhazi,3dktvr,TellahTruth,2,Fri Jul 17 09:48:15 2015 UTC,"Some people have made good in responding to the absurd storm of GG, yes, but GG itself has primarily just wailed, destroyed, and rammed its head repeatedly against walls.  GG has had no meaningful victories outside of glossed up pity prizes and the meager spoils of mobster tactics.  For a year of effort leading to the harming and misleading of tens of thousands of people and staggering damage to the reputation and well-being of the gaming community, very little of any  real substance has been accomplished, especially when it comes to gaming.  Heck, this right here isn't even gaming we're talking about.  It's just people that hate Gawker for sometimes being progressive and criticizing GG taking any opportunity possible to hurt them.    There are legitimate ethical issues here, but it has little to nothing to do with ethics in games journalism.  And most GGers and their misguided campaign again Gawker for actually good things(sometimes feminist statements and criticizing hate groups) have muddied the waters on genuine criticism toward them.  Even a broken clock can be right twice a day.  And in the same breath, most GGers are defending places like 8chan, Encyclopedia Dramatica, or the crappiest corners of Reddit.  In the face of the same and even greater unethical behavior, they can accept the cognitive dissonance of both condemning Gawker and associating with a monstrous cavalcade of bigots and the least ethical members of the media I've seen at places like Breitbart and TechRaptor.    Gawker has nothing to do with GG outside of being one of the people who have criticized them, and that continues to be enough.  Ethics is just a rationalization for hate, not the root cause of that hate.  I've seen the depths of this, as I haven't been able to avoid it; seeing my friends and colleagues get harassed for months for simply being women with feminist views in gaming.    Being unethical isn't the big sin; it's criticizing the actions of GGers or the games they like.  If you really aren't that tied into it anymore and don't like to associate with people like Milo or harassers like Chobit, then you've been riding in the backseat this whole time, being taken for a ride.  There's no need to subject yourself to more of that or continue to associate with it.    There isn't a lack of people in the world or online.  You can hang out with other gamers and even discuss actual ethical issues with relative ease outside of GG's spheres.  It just takes getting out and moving on. You can still check in with old GG friends if you need to, but there's no need to participate or waste your life on it.   Move on and simply join the rest of us regular gamers looking to make gaming a better place to be."

I mean to me it shows a huge lack of empathy.  I mean imagine the worst case scenario here. He's deeply in the closet and doesn't want anyone to know, because he denied himself for many years and go married and decided to have a family. He needs a way to express his urges and so sneaks behind his wife's back because he doesn't want to destroy his family and the charade he's been building all these years. Then he's outed, and everything comes tumbling down. His wife leaves him, his kids hate him because now they're being bullied, and everything is ruined.  Gawker just doesn't care.

If it's the former, I hope you guys realize that a lot of the things I've seen written about trans people on your sub is pretty darn similar.

GamerGhazi,3dmd1l,PaladinofFarore,15,Fri Jul 17 13:08:24 2015 UTC,"This article seems to a long list of claims that Anita never makes and why she would have been wrong if she made them. You take what she says, generalize from it, and then refute your own generalizations.  That's not how anything works."
GamerGhazi,3dmd1l,Antimuffin,5,Fri Jul 17 18:16:02 2015 UTC,"Quick example, she discusses a trope wherein female characters are possessed, turned against the hero, and have to be put down either in self defense or out of mercy; except that isnât a female trope. Thatâs a âloved one of the protagonistâ trope, that happens to characters of both genders all the time.    I'm not familiar with that particular criticism but a critique (of a critique) needs more support than ""nuh-uh"".  Did you do any of research to make sure it effects male and female characters equally?  Because it's very easy to think things are equal when they aren't.   Sheâs vehemently against any kind of sexualization, deeming it offensive and off putting to women. This includes scantily clad heroines like Bayonetta, as well as impractical clothing/attire like midriffs or high heeled shoes in combat.    It would have been far better to use a quote here.  The examples themselves are weak because they're a very specific type of sexualization catering to men.   To me, Anita Sarkeesian is, at worst, a poor cultural commentator who occasionally makes some valid points.   That's a damning conclusion for such a small article."
GamerGhazi,3dmd1l,hackiavelli,20,Sat Jul 18 10:37:32 2015 UTC,"I think you're taking an extremely shallow read into the over arching theme behind her Tropes vs. Women series, and you're lacking any specifics. I wish you had cited things that she has said or written in concrete detail. Otherwise you're just attacking a vaguely defined straw man.    Quick example, she discusses a trope wherein female characters are possessed, turned against the hero, and have to be put down either in self defense or out of mercy; except that isnât a female trope. Thatâs a âloved one of the protagonistâ trope, that happens to characters of both genders all the time.   This is a great example of what you're getting wrong in this article. The ""possessed loved one of the protagonist"" trope is often used in conjunction with other tropes that see violence perpetrated against women. In context to violence against women, the use of possession tropes feeds into tropes where a player must commit violence against a woman. In doing so, the cultural meme becomes, sometimes you have to smack a woman for her own good.  Plus you're not citing which specific piece you're pulling this information out of, so it could be any number of her videos, blogs, or tweets where she talks about this."

Another typical side-trope is helpless woman, but it can just as easily be subverted.  It's not about the tropes themselves, it's always about their general frequency and prevalence or the way how a specific work fulfills them. No one would care about damseling if it weren't so generally tired out (it's boring storytelling by now), gendered in a specific direction (you can't help but notice that it's always the same characters: children, not parents. Women, not men.) and in some notable instances comically bad, tasteless or paired with other tropes to make new tropes like ""women in refrigerators""."

I knew a professor who made a case that Alice in Wonderland was about a young woman's first menses. I think it's a somewhat crackpot conclusion, but it's not possible to say he's wrong unless his supporting evidence is not actually in the text or if other items in the text overtly contradict it. I felt his case was not convincing and you can certainly feel that way about AS's work in whole or part.  But that's not really wrong."
GamerGhazi,3dmd1l,tochterauselysium,3,Fri Jul 17 14:07:31 2015 UTC,"She views combat and violent problem resolution as inherently masculine traits, and cooperation and pacifism as inherently feminine. This is why in her view, Zoe from Firefly shouldâve just been a male, because her character type is a traditionally male one and her femininity is basically inconsequential.    I think this misses the point. I never got the impression she believes there are any inherently masculine or feminine traits (I don't think she ascribes to any essentialist view of gender), but it'd be hard to argue those traits aren't typically associated with masculinity or femininity in our current culture.  It's been a while since saw her argument about this, but IIRC the point she was making is that when you have important and strong female characters exhibiting ""masculine"" traits (i.e. ones associated with masculinity in our culture), that doesn't entirely fix the problem because the ""masculine"" traits are still being overvalued while ""feminine"" traits are undervalued. Essentially, the value of the character comes not from the character itself but how much it can be ""like a man"", with the implication being ""like a woman"" is still a bad or less valuable thing. Therefore, ideally we need to build narratives that value positive traits associated with all genders, not just ""masculine"" ones. That doesn't mean the ones we have are completely worthless, there just needs to be more diversity (which is basically Tropes vs Women in a nutshell).  It's a pretty nuanced and complex point so I'm not really surprised a lot of people don't get it. If there's one problem I have with Sarkeesian's critiques it's that she probably over-estimates people's ability to understand what she's saying and should perhaps lay it out more from first principles. Although considering she says it's okay to enjoy media and criticise it at the same time, and people still think she judges anyone who plays games, I question how much more she could do.  That said, I think this is pretty good, although IMO you conflate disagreement with her analysis too much with her discussing it badly. I don't agree with her on everything, but I don't necessarily think that because I happen to disagree she's done it badly (at least not because of that); we just came to different conclusions."
GamerGhazi,3dmd1l,HobbieK,8,Fri Jul 17 21:23:15 2015 UTC,"I agree with what you're saying here, but I'm not sure if that's how Anita sees it based on reading/watching some of her other stuff. She does seem to see valuing ""masculine"" attributes like combat as inherently sexist even when the work doesn't UNDERvalue the feminine per se -- a lot of her criticism of MM:FR was like that.  It's a particular strain in academic feminist criticism (and especially film criticism) I've always been iffy about, and one of the few areas where I disagree with her. I get that part of elevating women as a class is dealing with how our culture devalues femininity, since the reason we do so is because of misogyny and also as a way to divide women against themselves. But turning that into ""media must promote femininity"" reallllllllyyyyyyyy easily slips into gender-essentialism--both in general and in some of her arguments--in a way that should give people more pause.  (FTR I say this as someone who's pretty well-read on academic film criticism - I'm an academic myself (musicologist) who studies film soundtracks.)  Also, I have a lot of issues with Firefly both as a whole and with its feminism specifically, but I'd say the treatment of Kaylee and Inara to a certain extent disproves that the series sees masculinity in women as inherently superior to femininity. They're both very capable women who have strong feminine traits. Kaylee has both traditionally masculine and feminine traits and both are portrayed positively IIRC."
GamerGhazi,3dmd1l,RexCelestis,3,Fri Jul 17 17:20:53 2015 UTC,"But this is just a wrong way of looking at it. We should be ending the idea of of gender traits.

GamerGhazi,3dmd1l,Antimuffin,3,Fri Jul 17 19:41:27 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. I can see what you mean about conflation, I just personally think she sometimes uses some bad examples.
