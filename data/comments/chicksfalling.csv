chicksfalling,3786s3,cosine83,5,Mon Jun 22 17:20:04 2015 UTC,filmed before a live studio audience
chicksfalling,3786s3,CoffeeQuaffer,7,Tue May 26 02:08:14 2015 UTC,"The blonde didn't help by keeping her lower body in the boat while holding the ledge. Pushing the boat back, too."
chicksfalling,3786s3,tinkerer13,19,Mon May 25 20:41:52 2015 UTC,No doubt. The boat was mostly full of idiots. 6 of the 8 people there were standing ready to walk off the boat.
chicksfalling,3786s3,CoolGuy54,3,Mon May 25 20:47:47 2015 UTC,"epic fail   There's a lot going on here... First of all I think with 8 people the boat was overloaded and unstable.  (when the boat comes back later with only 5 people it looks more stable).  Green-shirt guy does the best thing, sitting down holding the boat to the pier, and pushing down on the pier, reducing the boat's tilt.  At 0:14, ""white belt guy"" falls forward when he, ""ass-crack guy""  and the blond all try to stand up at 0:14. They're lucky they didn't swamp the boat at 0:15.    I think this scared the black-haired girl in the corner where the boat almost swamped, and she panics and struggles to stand up from 0:16 - 0:23, pulling on the arm of orange-underpants guy from 0:19 - 0:23.  Black-haired girl fails to stand up, unfortunately she lets go of the starboard gunnel, and ends up falling/sitting down at 0:23 and all her weight suddenly shifts to port, pulling standing orange-underpants with her, all of which makes matters even worse.    At 0:23 there is a boat underneath purple-shirt girl, and at 0:24 there is not, and she's underwater.  She is a rock star for not dropping the bottle of wine, and later nearly pulls herself out onto the pier.  The back of her shirt looks partly dry!  You can see how slippery that red thing is when her ass slides off one way at 0:14 - 0:15, and then the other way at 0:23.  Ass-crack and underpants guy are standing straight up when the blond moves to get out, which made the boat even more unstable.  (Basically no one should ever stand straight-up like that.)  At 0:23 - 0:24, ""white belt guy"" tries to get out as the blond is getting out, so they both end up leaning out and pushing off at the same time.  White-belt guy jumping out at 0:24 not only tilts the boat further, but also kicks the bow out sharply, so the 3 people in the bow are thrown down.   I guess the pier is sloped and the pavers are uneven (White-belt's Heineken tips over), and the blond is in heel boots, so maybe that's why she trips or stumbles and falls back in.    Even after all of that, black-hair is still standing on the bow, and wobbling at 1:29 and still leaning on underpants, using him for a crutch.  She kicks out the bow too when she steps off.  Of course she didn't witness this the first time, because her back was turned."
chicksfalling,3786s3,tinkerer13,3,Sun Jun 28 05:39:07 2015 UTC,"You should copy-paste this analysis in all the reposts of this thing. Spot on.  Regardging your second paragraph though, I still blame white belt pretty much entirely for the two girls falling in, he should have hung onto to shore and waited."
chicksfalling,3786s3,resolvetochange,2,Tue Jun 30 02:19:49 2015 UTC,"Thanks, yeah I agree about ""white-belt"".    Feel free to copy & paste it if you want.  I know most would say I over analyzed it, even though i still probably overlooked some things.    Idk, I just found it interesting how much was going on, and the various instances of domino-effect.

chicksfalling,2zp3kx,Willowpuff,8,Sat Apr 4 03:01:11 2015 UTC,Cooper's Hill Cheese-Rolling and Wake. It's hilarious but some pretty serious bone breaking goes on there. It's a mad old tradition in England. I think it's in Gloucestershire.
