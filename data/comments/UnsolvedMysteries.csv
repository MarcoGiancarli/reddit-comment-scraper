UnsolvedMysteries,3e43ub,VALENS000,6,Tue Jul 21 20:21:57 2015 UTC,"The Luka Magnotta episodes are a BRUTAL listen.  I have mixed feelings about it though.  On one hand, the ""3 Guys 1 Hammer"" audio was over the top and too disturbing - especially since I listen to podcasts on headphones as I'm going to sleep in the dark.  On the other hand, the audio intensified the whole story, and almost made it a personal connection... if that makes sense."
UnsolvedMysteries,3e43ub,creesa,3,Tue Jul 21 22:14:30 2015 UTC,Yeah... I just heard that and there is really no reason to play the audio for that long. He gets the point across with the short but disturbing clips and his description of the video... but then he plays the raw audio for almost a full minute. No need for it.
UnsolvedMysteries,3e43ub,weevil_boy,4,Wed Jul 22 03:36:52 2015 UTC,It's gratuitous and in BAD TASTE.  Why not just describe the video like other podcasts would and leave it at that?
UnsolvedMysteries,3e43ub,bigroblee,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:23:30 2015 UTC,Which story in particular do you have a problem with in episode 15?
UnsolvedMysteries,3e43ub,Medic574,6,Wed Jul 22 07:09:45 2015 UTC,"I find myself agreeing with you. I listen to podcasts while working, and I was excited to find Sword and Scale. Even more excited to know he was coming to a bar very near me, and I planned to go meet him. But over time I went backwards to past episodes, and some things he said began to bother me. What truly threw me off was the episode with those people who wanted to eat children. The following episode, he calls his friend and very creepily has the robot voice pretend to want to eat his children, and says very inappropriate things. If it had been any of my friends, I would have clocked them. Immediately. That was honestly in very poor taste, to even really say these things about a friend's kids, much less on such a public medium, you know?   Criticism aside, I do admire his work ethic. He is also decently informative, and doesn't do ads or anything like that. Strong podcast. Still don't think we'd get along on a personal level, however."
UnsolvedMysteries,3e43ub,Medic574,-5,Tue Jul 21 23:49:14 2015 UTC,"Thanks for bringing this up.  I totally forgot about the episode where he pranks his friend with that horrifically poor taste call.  What the hell was that?  I enjoy a good joke as much as the next fellow, but jokes about baby cannibalism  just CROSS THE LINE.  There is no place in this society for such POOR TASTE.  I wish there were a way to get this show banned."
UnsolvedMysteries,3e43ub,thatirishguyjohn,7,Wed Jul 22 00:18:51 2015 UTC,"I don't think the show should be banned per say, as there are very popular shows where VERY vulgar things are said.

But, the bottom line is that Mike doesn't have a whole lot of competition in the way of true crime podcasting. The guy obviously does ALL the work on his own, and definitely knows what he's doing as far as audio production. He does not have any sponsors and because of his offensive tone, I don't think he ever will. He's one of the few guys out there working his ass off to produce content. Until some other good TC podcasts come along, I'm afraid we're stuck with Mike.   Generation Why is a pretty good TC podcast, but those guys are just fans talking about cases. They don't have any expertise in breaking down TC cases. Let's face it. We need Serial, Season 2 REAL bad!"

UnsolvedMysteries,3e43ub,weevil_boy,5,Wed Jul 22 01:33:33 2015 UTC,"I agree with you. He says a lot of things in poor taste. It's very obvious the guy doesn't even try to approach the topics with a sliver of neutrality/lack of bias. It feels sometimes like he gets off on being spooky and vulgar. I gave up on it when I heard the episode with the horrible, inaccurate comments on schizophrenia. It was obvious he didn't even so much as look at the Wikipedia article on schizophrenia. He paints schizophrenics as monsters and future criminals. The fact is that individuals with schizophrenia are much more likely to be the victims of crimes, not the perpetrators."

Like there was a boy who went missing at a scout camp. Left one group to catch up with others up ahead and was never found. Last year there was a fireman that went missing in the mountains north of LA and wasn't found.

UnsolvedMysteries,3djt96,velvta,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:43:56 2015 UTC,"Call me boring but it sounds like the most likely explanation is correct here. The kid ran off for some reason, hiked farther than anyone could have guessed (awesome feats of human endurance happen all the time - why can't they happen in children), took his socks off when they got wet in a creek or something and either slipped his shoes off and on again without re tying them or the dad was wrong and the kid knew how to tie them.   It's odd that the sock thing is such a creepy detail to some only because the father claims the kid couldn't tie them.    Loved reading that though, good find and thanks for sharing."
UnsolvedMysteries,3djt96,SmellyCherub,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:10:12 2015 UTC,"My analysis differs slightly from yours, although I don't think you've done a bad write-up here.  Why does the sock thing bother people so much?  It's a detail, any detail, and it helps drive it home for unimaginative people.  I like your proposed explanation.  Let me throw out an alternative theory, as I happen to find the socks thing comforting.  Here's what the socks mean to me - that whomever was with him (if anyone) was trying to comfort him first by helping him retie his shoes.  Then they allow him to keep the socks, which he puts in his pocket.  He's not going to die, right?  He's going to need the socks later.  I'd tend to assume that if the kid were with someone mean, they wouldn't have let him keep the socks.  The socks are a good sign.  So let's say someone was helping him, but once a search starts they get spooked and abandon the kid.  I'm not saying this is a responsible way to be, but it would have to be appealing to just cut the kid loose at the sign of trouble if you were an idiot to begin with.  Why do I think the person is an idiot?  If you were helping a lost kid, wouldn't you take the kid straight to the police.  Imagine if a slightly older boy were helping the younger search for his parents, and then when things started to heat up, the older boy were afraid to get himself in trouble.  Another theory still?  Boy wandered off, was too afraid to trust strangers, was overconfident in his ability to find his way home, maybe drank a couple of mouthfuls of sea water by mistake, got confused, the sun goes down, he climbs behind some dunes to stay warm, freezes to death in his sleep."

UnsolvedMysteries,3dcj9j,Grove_Street_Blvd,16,Wed Jul 15 05:08:00 2015 UTC,"I grew up in Germany in a tiny village (about 50 houses). Of course our little village came with its own little castle up on a hill, since you can't spit in Europe without hitting a castle or two.  The castle is abandoned and is basically one tower with a crumbling house attached, and as children we would all go up and play near it. There was a giant hole in the ground with a grate over it that used to be the castle's well.  The legend goes that the noble man who lived there was awaiting the birth of his first child. Being overjoyed, he commissioned a solid gold cradle to be built for his future child. The baby was born and spent its first night on Earth in the cradle. But no one had realized that the cold of the gold against the baby through that winter night would prove to much, and the family awoke to find the baby dead.  The noble man was devestated and cursed his opulence and greed. He took the cradle and threw it into the well, where it supposedly still remains.   As children, we were FASCINATED at the thought of a gold cradle just out of our reach down in the dark hole. Of course, who knows where the legend started and every little village has its mystery but growing up hearing the tale from all the old Omas and Opas in the town made us obsessed with the idea.  Sometimes I still wonder!"

There was a report of her car being seen at a nearby gas station a few days after she disappeared but that was the end of the story. There’s another one where a young mother in her 30’s just seemed to vanish. She left food cooking on the stove and her keys and wallet were left behind too. Also, she was on crutches due to a recent work accident. At first, there were stories about search parties being organized by her family and friends but nothing lately. I know they’re adults and they can leave and not be found if that’s what they want to do but it’s odd that there’s been no news. One vanished in 2013 and the other was about 8 months later.

They interviewed the first responders to the fire, which they assumed was a brush fire, and they said they just kept finding one body after another and it was horrifying. This case reminds me of another guy named John List who murdered his mother, wife and three children after being disappointed with his life. He left their bodies in the ballroom of their huge home, his mother's body in her apartment upstairs because he couldn't drag her down, wrote the children's schools saying they'd be gone for awhile and skipped town. I think it was a month before anyone found the bodies. He'd set the AC really low so the decomp would slow. The murders were in 1971 and he wasn't apprehended until 1989."
UnsolvedMysteries,3d0uq1,ReginaldDwight,5,Mon Jul 13 00:02:19 2015 UTC,"Don't know if it's the same show you're referencing but there is an episode about Bishop on ""The Hunt"" on Netflix. It's a Most Wanted style show hosted by John Walsh. I really recommend the whole series."
UnsolvedMysteries,3d0uq1,wrentintin,3,Mon Jul 13 03:58:16 2015 UTC,"It may have been, actually. I remember whatever I saw had John Walsh just speaking of him with nothing but disgust."
UnsolvedMysteries,3d0uq1,ReginaldDwight,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:22:59 2015 UTC,I'll have to check that out.  I have the original UM broadcast saved on my hard drive with a bunch of others.
UnsolvedMysteries,3cvslq,themissingfir,31,Sat Jul 11 04:47:46 2015 UTC,I think you should read one of the zillion identical posts already on here.
UnsolvedMysteries,3cvslq,tomorrowmorrowland,-26,Sat Jul 11 05:31:24 2015 UTC,What that suppose to mean.I think she slip into the tanks accidentally.
UnsolvedMysteries,3cvslq,marlasinger_,14,Sat Jul 11 05:40:40 2015 UTC,Her story has been posted and discussed many different times on this subreddit. Use the search feature next time.
UnsolvedMysteries,3cvslq,chewmomo,2,Sat Jul 11 10:44:36 2015 UTC,I'm not 100% sure but there was no trace of drug found in her body..
UnsolvedMysteries,3cvslq,AyYoto,12,Sat Jul 11 09:08:36 2015 UTC,Exactly. LSD has a half life of 3 hours. So... Half Life 3 confirmed.
UnsolvedMysteries,3cvslq,EntOnTheHolston,1 point,Sat Jul 11 17:11:13 2015 UTC,I assume nothing
UnsolvedMysteries,3clzgc,Jobcv314,3,Wed Jul 8 23:10:55 2015 UTC,"I remember when I first heard about this, I thought for sure they would find the truck in the Delaware or the pine barrens. I can't believe it's been 10 years."
UnsolvedMysteries,3clzgc,vjludovico,2,Thu Jul 9 03:57:56 2015 UTC,"Me too. To the best of my knowledge they never even found the vehicle. After so many years it just makes it more of a mystery. Sure it could be siting in a driveway covered up for years or in an old garage. But I guess it's more likely it's at the bottom of a river or long ago crushed in a compacter at a junk yard and it's metal sold over seas for scrap. I'm leaning toward it being in the river. Just seems like the easier way to make a vehicle disappear without involving too many people. Every time I read something about it, it seems like they are also leaning in the direction of some kind of professional hit. Very strange indeed."
UnsolvedMysteries,3clzgc,stonetape,2,Thu Jul 9 04:43:50 2015 UTC,"I lean toward the river too. I doubt they're in the Delaware, but cars accidentally drive into the Schuylkill more often than you'd think..just seems odd they'd end up west of they were headed to NJ.    I'm from Philly too and find this case eerily haunting."
UnsolvedMysteries,3clzgc,rudyruderooster,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:38:46 2015 UTC,Did they not investigate Danielle's estranged (ex?) husband? As soon as I read that part it kinda raised some red flags.
UnsolvedMysteries,3chdms,insomniaceve,7,Tue Jul 7 22:39:26 2015 UTC,"Based on the article alone it seems to me this isn't a mystery, but there's just no proof."
UnsolvedMysteries,3c9ggk,CrackerJackJack,7,Mon Jul 6 03:22:51 2015 UTC,Here's some suggestions from r/unresolvedmysteries. http://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/3bkti7/documentary_addict_here_what_are_your_favorite/
UnsolvedMysteries,3c9ggk,Pizzazzinator,2,Mon Jul 6 04:54:25 2015 UTC,"this is exactly what I was looking for, thank you!"
UnsolvedMysteries,3c1pja,BoobBread,6,Fri Jul 3 23:14:23 2015 UTC,"I definitely think she committed suicide. I can only imagine how she felt when her husband wouldn't even sleep with her. I think a lot of people would internalize it, and think something is wrong with them. It seems like she felt worthless, and then to have Tyler dismiss her probably just added to the depression. Tyler is a POS, though, I am glad he took a bit of responsibility for her death."
UnsolvedMysteries,3c1pja,PaintByNumberPro,2,Sun Jul 5 16:28:22 2015 UTC,If you watch this you should also read this article:  https://thecosmiccathedral.wordpress.com/2015/02/25/what-48-hours-didnt-tell-you-about-micah-moore/
UnsolvedMysteries,3bz1tg,BoobBread,2,Fri Jul 3 08:43:40 2015 UTC,This was really interesting to watch
UnsolvedMysteries,3bz1tg,Zoidbun,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:55:40 2015 UTC,"i thought so too, I'm glad i posted it and that you enjoyed it"
UnsolvedMysteries,3bz1tg,somethingwork,1 point,Tue Jul 7 06:26:02 2015 UTC,Really interesting to watch but I had to stop when he started talking about the details of the actions.  Horrible to imagine what the poor girls must have been going through :(
UnsolvedMysteries,3bz1tg,somethingwork,2,Thu Jul 16 14:42:32 2015 UTC,"that's good, that means you still got some life in ya"
UnsolvedMysteries,3bwt3v,CindyCCC,3,Thu Jul 2 20:15:25 2015 UTC,I think I remember seeing a segment on this on Unsolved Mysteries way back in the 80s. It is nuts how long some of that show's segments can stay with you.
UnsolvedMysteries,3bwt3v,KopOut,2,Fri Jul 3 05:47:57 2015 UTC,I have a lot of these old segments saved on my hard drive collecting them over the years.  The orange sock murders and Dexter Stefonek always gave me the chills.  This show is scarier than any horror movie could ever hope to be.
UnsolvedMysteries,3btlaz,MissMisery13,2,Thu Jul 2 01:13:18 2015 UTC,Well hopefully now it can be solved! I remember watching the two Dr. Phil episodes with his parents and his dad was as fishy as hell.
UnsolvedMysteries,3btlaz,Sue_Sue_Heck,1 point,Thu Jul 2 09:21:19 2015 UTC,Awesome!
UnsolvedMysteries,3btlaz,PotatoAvenger,1 point,Thu Jul 2 03:22:24 2015 UTC,This needs to be solved.
UnsolvedMysteries,3bi16x,eyeingyourpancakes,5,Mon Jun 29 11:44:27 2015 UTC,What was the cause of death? I couldn't see anything mentioned in the article.
UnsolvedMysteries,3bi16x,Midsky,3,Mon Jun 29 12:05:47 2015 UTC,"Her body was found in a small body of water on a Native American reservation; I heard she was strangled but cannot back it up with any evidence. The last person she was seen with, a male she went to school with, is still the only person of interest in the case. There were witnesses who saw them arguing. Interestingly, he is now a CEO of a local collections company who has been in legal trouble for illegally threatening debtors."
UnsolvedMysteries,3bi16x,AbortedCatFetus,2,Tue Jun 30 09:11:05 2015 UTC,"I can't find anything about it actually, which is strange."
UnsolvedMysteries,3bi16x,heyjennyy,2,Mon Jun 29 19:19:42 2015 UTC,"Through a quick search on Google, nothing came up. After the first page the results weren't related anymore. Each article said basically the same thing with no mention on the cause of death."
UnsolvedMysteries,3bi16x,OneSoggyBiscuit,11,Tue Jun 30 03:34:12 2015 UTC,"I don't understand how people think that adding beautiful in the title makes a case more compelling. It's just just OP, news agencies do it all the time. Am I supposed to care more because the missing person was attractive?"
UnsolvedMysteries,3bi16x,aeshleyrose,5,Mon Jun 29 18:51:40 2015 UTC,Because it is proven that it does.  Attractive people attract more attention. It's in the name. It isn't fair but it is human nature. Denying it doesn't make it go away.  However taking advantage of it doesn't seem right either.
UnsolvedMysteries,3bi16x,Heliyum2,2,Tue Jun 30 00:42:17 2015 UTC,"Well, whether you accept it or not, a persons attractiveness can be a huge influence in the response they elicit from others. I agree that in this case its pretty morbid, but to dismiss it entirely isnt right either."
UnsolvedMysteries,3bi16x,max10192,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:32:45 2015 UTC,"dismiss it entirely isnt right either.   Actually, yes it is. Someone who takes care of themselves but still isn't attractive... do they deserve less attention? No, of course not. What possible reason would there be NOT to dismiss it?"
UnsolvedMysteries,3bi16x,aeshleyrose,0,Tue Jun 30 02:19:31 2015 UTC,That it is a fact that people react differently to attractive people.
