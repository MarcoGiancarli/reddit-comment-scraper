Sonsofanarchy,3e32wk,HoneyBunchesOfAwesom,10,Tue Jul 21 16:10:43 2015 UTC,"I really like Lincoln Potter. He was a great character!  He was my favourite antagonist, I think he just tried to get a little bit of justice!  Stahl was vile, she almost made me smash my TV at least 3 and a half times!"
Sonsofanarchy,3e32wk,AllAboutTheFairytale,5,Tue Jul 21 19:21:03 2015 UTC,"Damon Pope takes the cake for me, personally. Just a perfect amalgamation of cold, calculated ruthlessness. His actions did more to fuck up SAMCRO than anyone before."
Sonsofanarchy,3e32wk,XxAzrielxX,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:28:54 2015 UTC,"I think Pope was the best for being bad, but I didn't really think of Potter as bad in the end, I think potter was a good guy who sometimes did bad things to get the bad guys, Pope was a bad guy who acted like a good guy to do bad things!  I loved Popes character. But I didn't want him to get his way, I have hopes Potter is still around, being weird, riding his bike and getting snippets of justice! Even when it's against mayors! And the reason ""because I don't like you"" The guy is brilliant. I love how weird he was!"
Sonsofanarchy,3e32wk,AllAboutTheFairytale,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:01:37 2015 UTC,"I thought of Potter as a man who wanted to do good and would use any means at his disposal to achieve that (which is just paraphrasing what you said). I think, at the end, he lamented what he did because he almost ruined someone's life who didn't deserve it (Juice).   I liked Pope because he knew who he was; he knew he was corrupt, he knew he had power, and he knew that he could do anything he wanted with no repercussions. He thought he was untouchable. In a way, he was the Reaper; he dealt death and, for a time, SAMCRO couldn't do anything to stop him. It wasn't until the very end that we find out that there was a very clear plan to dispose of him.  Also, Pope had charisma, something that I think Potter distinctly lacked. S4 is one of my least favorite seasons because of that. S1 didn't really have a villain, S2 had Zobelle and Weston (another favorite of mine, despicable to the core and full of pride), S3 had Stahl (the complete antithesis to Potter, literally kills her lesbian lover to save her own ass).  I'm so sad this show is over. I just want to experience everything again."

Sonsofanarchy,3e0i8u,Harrywoz8,4,Tue Jul 21 00:41:25 2015 UTC,"I'd agree with what one of our clubhouses glorious leaders says above!  I think the MC system ensures that everyone has a voice, hence the voting system. I don't think that would be as valid if every charter had one man to answer to. I don't think there is a president of all the clubs, it wouldn't be possible really, they are based all around the world. As far as I'm aware each charter gets to do their own votes, make their own decisions. Which is why when in a later season, SAMCRO votes on something, but it doesn't impact other charters (I'm being very vague here as I don't want to spoil anything) but for people who have seen it Spoiler So I would say no, as /u/asstasticbum said, I think they just have a lot of respect for the mother charter! :) But I certainly don't think they are controlled by them, maybe influenced a tad, but they have their own votes!"

Sonsofanarchy,3e0i8u,asstasticbum,4,Tue Jul 21 19:26:30 2015 UTC,"It was just that SAMCRO was the first charter, aka Mother Charter, that JT was the founder and that Jax was the ""Heir Apparent"" that Redwood got that respect and consideration. Much like the Hells Angels get that out of their Oakland Charter.  The president of Redwood is not as is in the Italian Mafiaso terms the ""Capo di tutti capi"" or ""Capo dei cap"" which translates to ""boss of all bosses"" or ""boss of bosses."" It was simply a matter of respect to Jax and the mother charter in what they did set the way, so to speak.  A classic example of this not going the way way of Redwood is when they visited SAMTAZ and found out they were dealing, told them to stop, yet they voted and much to the chagrin of Clay and Jax still decided to keep on dealing. Its a respect / homage thing to the mother charter. Although when the episode came around that they all met in the woods and Jax told them all that SAMCRO was getting out of guns and all of the other charters agreed at the table, that was some serious ass kissing bullshit and bad writing on Sutter, IMO.  Great post /u/Harrywoz8   a."

Sonsofanarchy,3dsg9y,AllAboutTheFairytale,3,Mon Jul 20 01:14:53 2015 UTC,"I don't think Gemma represents anything in Jax's psyche. Sure, the apple doesn't fall THAT far from the tree but Jax's ability to actually love truly and deeply is very very different from Gemma's conditional and toxic brand of love. That's what separates them the most. Even in the end, when she tells Jax that she loves him from the deepest and purest part of heart - it's a part of her heart that surely once existed but was quickly covered up and is probably unrecognizable. She's saying this AS she's coaxing him to shoot her which she knows will destroy him and send him to his own death... so, again - very toxic, very conditional, and very very selfish."

It was kind of laughable how unrealistic it was.  I mean, if you kill a different person every episode, and sometimes an entire group of people or a main character, the shock value goes away pretty fast.  I still enjoyed it, but maybe it would have been better to watch it as it was aired, once a week.  The body counts and lack of legal repercussions pile up laughably fast when you binge-watch it."
Sonsofanarchy,3djkkk,Dreadzy,-1,Fri Jul 17 00:35:07 2015 UTC,I know right? It's almost as if this wasn't fiction.
Sonsofanarchy,3djkkk,SabineLavine,7,Fri Jul 17 01:31:42 2015 UTC,Plenty of fictional shows manage to stay realistic.  SoA couldn't go a week without gratuitous violence and falling back on a deus ex machina at least two or three times.  The show can not compete with the other nominees.
Sonsofanarchy,3djkkk,AllAboutTheFairytale,2,Fri Jul 17 02:30:23 2015 UTC,"Gratuitous violence was one of the core facets of the show, from the outset. It permeated the lifestyle choice of the club. That was beyond intentional.   Yeah, they fell onto deus ex machina a few times, and that probably hurt them in the long run. But to use the gratuitous violence to hold against the show, when it was one of the very tenets of the conflicts across the entire seven seasons is kinda dumb."
Sonsofanarchy,3djkkk,CreepyAbelTeller,3,Fri Jul 17 04:13:46 2015 UTC,"Well yeah, the conflict was a central point of the show but that doesn't mean that it wasn't awfully overdone a lot of times.

And she was a beautiful character. Jimmi Smits deserves to be acknowledged for when he found out about Gemma. Where he acted without talking! And still made me cry for him!  And in my opinion, Sutter deserves a nod, simply for coming up with the show, he is a brilliant writer and I don't blame him for being pissed that critics take their dislike of him out on the brilliant actors in his very successful show!!"
Sonsofanarchy,3djkkk,Kallure,3,Fri Jul 17 17:57:12 2015 UTC,"Honestly, the fact that Justified was completely shut out and it had arguably the best final season of any show in recent history is more of a travesty than SOA being shut out. The only two possible nominations I saw SOA garnering for a very inconsistent Season 7 is Charlie Hunnam and Walton Goggins. Maybe Jimmy Smits. I'm ok with SOA being shut out. I'm NOT ok with Justified ending and Emmyless. The writing on Justified should have at least been acknowledged. There is no other show on air right now that has the same quality of writing. Unfortunately, SOA does not have the same caliber of writing and/or writing staff. I love SOA but I do also realized how flawed it is... especially in the last few seasons."

Sonsofanarchy,3djkkk,CreepyAbelTeller,2,Fri Jul 17 13:55:25 2015 UTC,"You may have had a point until you tried (and failed) to make Breaking Bad into something it's not. BB is not overrated, it's correctly rated. It's sublime on every level. And the acting on the show was terrific. Why knock one show down just because SOA was snubbed?   I do agree that HoC had a terrible season. Don't understand the love there nor the Jeff Daniels nomination. I love him and he's a great actor but wtf is he paying Emmy voters to get a nomination every year for the terrible Newsroom."
Sonsofanarchy,3djkkk,lylateller,-2,Sat Jul 18 14:58:09 2015 UTC,"I picked BB because it got a ridiculous amout of awards over the years. Keep in mind that even Skyler got an Emmy (probably for playing one of the most annoying characters ever on TV) and I think even the most hardcore BB fans dislike her. Apart from that, I never got the BB hype. The premise has potential but the show is way too safe, has a ton of grating characters (Sklyer, Walt Jr, Marie), very mixed writing (the whole season 4 premise makes no sense) and even fails at its supposed premise (turning the protagonist into an antagonist). If it hadn'T been that hyped, I never would have watched more than a couple of episodes."
Sonsofanarchy,3djkkk,dlrfsu,3,Sat Jul 18 15:17:04 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind that even Skyler got an Emmy (probably for playing one of the most annoying characters ever on TV) and I think even the most hardcore BB fans dislike her.    Skyler was a great character, I don't think many ""hardcore"" fans hate her. Just the ones who are completely blinded by their die-hard love for Walt, despite the fact her behaviour was pretty much always justified because he did a lot of stupid shit."
Sonsofanarchy,3djkkk,crane83,2,Sun Jul 19 00:19:33 2015 UTC,"Yes. THIS. And the actress who played Skylar was wonderful. It's a tricky role to pull off and she did great. The writing is excellent all around - it's nowhere close to ""mixed."" But agree to disagree!"
Sonsofanarchy,3djkkk,yachamed,5,Sun Jul 19 05:58:04 2015 UTC,I have a feeling SoA would've gotten nominated (now and in the past) if Sutter kept his mouth shut and didn't go on an Emmy-rant.
Sonsofanarchy,3djkkk,crane83,0,Thu Jul 16 20:21:32 2015 UTC,"I really do think there is some bias going on against the whole show. When Hal Holbrook didn't even get a nomination, something fishy was definitely going on. I'm sure Sutter doesn't give a shit about an award for himself,  but I think feels bad if him own actions screwed up the chances for someone else."
Sonsofanarchy,3djkkk,dlrfsu,7,Fri Jul 17 00:07:26 2015 UTC,"Hal Holbrook? Lol why would he deserve a nomination? If anyone deserved an acting nomination, Smits is just about it. But all in all, SoA just isn't up to par with other dramas. Sad to say as it's my favorite show."
Sonsofanarchy,3djkkk,crane83,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:25:42 2015 UTC,"Hal Holbrook kills it in both of his appearances. You can't convince me that Nate's complete inability to grasp reality doesn't choke you up a little... Besides, you don't have to be a major character to garner a guest nomination-- Diana Rigg gets nominated every year for GoT, regardless of her screen time."
Sonsofanarchy,3djkkk,lylateller,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:57:57 2015 UTC,"Who should he have been nominated over in 2011? How about this year? His character was good but not earth shattering. You can say the same about a lot of the SoA characters. Like I said before, Sons is my favorite show - it's incredibly entertaining, but the writing and acting just isn't that great."
Sonsofanarchy,3djkkk,maverickx12,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:17:32 2015 UTC,"His portrayal as Gemma's father should have won him the guest star Emmy, certainly worth a nomination. He was fantastic in that arc and if the Academy doesn't respect Sutter, there sure should of shown some to Holbrook."

Sonsofanarchy,3demqv,Slambo12,2,Wed Jul 15 17:53:16 2015 UTC,"I felt like the reason finale seemed rushed and why all the loose ends are quickly tied is because Jax realizes that if tries a different sort of 'fix' new troubles will arise in some other way (like they did throughout the series) and this is the only way the club can survive.  Bad guys lose, and Jax was one of them."

Sonsofanarchy,3derwl,gettheegone,5,Wed Jul 15 18:28:04 2015 UTC,"I think Gemma hated Clay after he went after Tara, after he promised her he wouldn't, and in doing so, he also sent a Hit-man after her two grandchildren.  I think Gemma did love Tara. Kurt Sutter always said it was like a mother daughter dynamic, they could be at each others throats one second but they would fiercely defend each other.  I think her hatred was a mix of him telling her it was his business what he did with their money, so long as she had money to entertain herself, him trying to kill Tara, which would have hurt jax (don't read spoiler if you haven't finished season 6) Spoiler and when doing that, he could have hurt Thomas and Abel. In doing that he showed he didn't trust her, which Gemma wasn't aware of till that point. Finally the beating, that was the last straw.  As far as the juice and clay relationship goes, I think they just understood each other. They both made mistakes they couldn't really go back on. I think Clay replaced Jax with juice as a son like figure, because Juice needed him, and loved him, and he had lost that with Jax. Juice was there for Clay when everyone else went with jax, I do think he loved him.  That's my take on it anyways :)"
Sonsofanarchy,3derwl,AllAboutTheFairytale,2,Wed Jul 15 18:58:28 2015 UTC,"I totally forgot that the kids were with Tara when the hit-men went after her.  Gemma has a lot of contradictions, but definitely I can understand her hating Clay most through that situation.   I think that'd be enough on its own.         Cool. This has helped a lot."
Sonsofanarchy,3derwl,CaptainCoral,3,Wed Jul 15 19:35:13 2015 UTC,"Yep, I think that it's all about Gemma not being able to manipulate them anymore. She lost her control over Clay, so she was done with him. Once she stopped being able to manipulate Tara, she was done with her and tried to bring Wendy back into the fold."
Sonsofanarchy,3derwl,CreepyAbelTeller,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:29:49 2015 UTC,"I don't disagree that Gemma, at one point, really really loved Tara. But she is a master at compartmentalizing - and would have eventually forgiven Clay for putting the hit out on Tara. I think the reason she went from slightly suspicious of Clay and their relationship to full on hatred was because by lying to Gemma - after she made him promise more than once and reiterated the importance of trust and loyalty in their relationship - Clay broke what their bond was built on (shared secrets, lies, betrayals, etc - but the keyword is shared) and went from treating her like his equal to more or less an old lady. Gemma has always seen herself as essentially a co-founder of the club and nowhere near ""just"" an old lady. So by reducing her to the very thing she has worked so hard to detach herself from, pushed her into the point of no return."

It's just some random Medieval show at this point. I don't think this show will make it past 1 or 2 seasons. Just as well... then Sutter can get to work on a First 9 spin-off.

He came back to hurt her because he was bitter that Tara aborted his baby without consulting him. Tara had opportunities to leave charming after that, with Jax's blessing, she chose to stay. Jax and Tara were drawn to eachother, and more often than not, they were good for eachother. I don't think Kohn had Tara's interests at heart, he was a scorned man who would stop at nothing to get his ""Tar-Tar"" back. Tara's fate was what it was, it was Gemma who caused it, Jax gave up everything for her freedom from charming, his boys, his own freedom and his club, he was going to go to prison for her.  Jax loved Tara more than he ever loved anyone, regardless of how much suffering the club and family brought Tara, Jax always wanted the best for her.

It seemed like Season 6 was all about Gemma winning and Tara losing at each and every turn, so I was rooting for her more than ever.

I loved juice and grew to hate him and his dumb decisions. For some reason half-sacks death really stuck me hard. He was such good comic relief and he was just growing into his character so well. I think the show was really lacking after his death even though his character wasn't a huge deal it landed hard to me. Then to find out the actual actor passed away.....sucked.

Most Sad: Opie:he was Jaxs best friend and I got this will always hit me hard. after that death I started to scale deaths baised on a 1-Opie scale.   Tara:just shocking   Bobbie was more of a HOLY SHIT!   not really death released but I'm glad tig and Venus became a thing.
Sonsofanarchy,3d24y3,Synner40,2,Wed Jul 15 23:05:47 2015 UTC,Stahl and Opie
Sonsofanarchy,3d24y3,GregDraven,2,Mon Jul 13 00:30:57 2015 UTC,"Most satisfying I have a few, Weston got his which was nice, Stahl was the character I hated the most so that was lovely but I think Pope was the one for me after all he did (although I loved his character)  Saddest/one I didn't see coming was Bobby. I really thought that they had painted Marks in a different light to Pope but nope. I didn't figure it out until about a second before when Bobby was screaming through the gag trying to tell Jax that Marks had the gun hidden on him. Fuck!"
Sonsofanarchy,3d24y3,shakeandsnake,2,Mon Jul 13 11:38:45 2015 UTC,"Opie and Tara were hard, but Gemma..oh that bitch...I waited a while for her annoying raspy voice to be gone."
Sonsofanarchy,3d24y3,hotsy__totsy,2,Mon Jul 13 13:39:35 2015 UTC,Peggy Bundy finally got what was coming to her.  Stealing 1s from a poor shoe salesman is a crime that should not go unpunished.

Sonsofanarchy,3d24y3,hotsy__totsy,2,Thu Jul 16 11:57:02 2015 UTC,"Pope and Gemma's deaths were by far the most satisfying. Pope however should of been stabbed, shot, burned, and dismembered. That dude was pure evil.  I really was upset about Opie's death and Bobby's as well. Opie was just sad because of all he went through, for him to sacrifice his life for the club sucked. Bobby i was really hoping would live and take over the club."
Sonsofanarchy,3d24y3,GingerDirtyMitts,2,Mon Jul 13 14:18:15 2015 UTC,"Stahl's death was the most ""Finally!"" death of the show for me, and I agree with /u/Vanitybomb that Tara's was the hardest. I didn't expect it, I thought Jax would find a way to save them both or he'd find some means of escaping danger at the last minute. Or escape it with short time and lead from within Stockton. Losing Tara was a shock.   On a personal note, I grew to see myself and my ex-fiancée as being slightly parallel to Jax and Tara, so seeing her die so violently- while I was watching it in bed with my fiancée- was deeply unsettling and bothersome to me. It took me hours to fall asleep that night. It felt personal."
Sonsofanarchy,3d24y3,Badger_Silverado,1 point,Wed Jul 15 06:52:58 2015 UTC,"I personally thought Tara doomed herself with the fake miscarriage thing.  Unser was right about her, she fell so low trying to do the ""right"" thing."
Sonsofanarchy,3d24y3,kampfgruppekarl,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:32:51 2015 UTC,"On a scale of 1 - people who deserve to die because they do morally corrupt things, I would say Tara was far from the worst. The fake miscarriage was terrible on all fronts but mostly because she was one of the few people who actually had a moral code. Regardless, of all the things that could possibly ""doom"" her, I wouldn't pick that. Dire circumstances lead people to do crazy shit. You know what they say... if you got to keep the monster in law away... (no one really says that... but it seems fitting.)"
Sonsofanarchy,3d24y3,CreepyAbelTeller,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:09:37 2015 UTC,"She's one of the first to commit and help cover up a killing, intentionally bringing Kole to Charming to serve up a justice she wasn't obtaining through legal channels.  I think she was doomed already, but the conniving she went through to try to take custody of her son and another mother's child sealed the deal."

Sonsofanarchy,3d24y3,killzonev2,5,Mon Jul 13 05:06:59 2015 UTC,Most satisfying: Gemma. Bonus satisfying points that it was Jax who killed her and not just some accident or suicide or anyone else Most upset: Tara :(
Sonsofanarchy,3d24y3,SkittlezTrench92,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:49:17 2015 UTC,"Agreed on Opies death. For me though, Lee Toric's death was the most satisfying, followed closely by Pope."

Sonsofanarchy,3d24y3,Arklelinuke,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:58:10 2015 UTC,"The most upsetting would definitely be Bobby. It wasn't the death that stuck with me the longest or made me the saddest, but I loved the hell out of Bobby. Out of all the deaths on the show, his was the only one I really didn't see coming. I actually screamed when it happened (that only happened one other time - Phil). Every other major death had some forewarning or a story line so deep in shit that you knew it wouldn't end well.   Stahl's death was the most satisfying. The execution of the scene (no pun intended) and the element of perfect revenge made it extremely gratifying. I was really happy to see Gemma go, but she deserved worse than getting shot in the back of the head. I get that it was his mom, but still..."
Sonsofanarchy,3d24y3,batz777,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:33:32 2015 UTC,Most satisfying: Stahl and Jimmy O  Most upsetting: OOOPPPIIIIEEEEEE
Sonsofanarchy,3d24y3,Boof-Bubba-Dale,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:39:02 2015 UTC,Most satisfying was definitely Stahl. First time I saw it I fucking lost my shit with excitement. My favorite (probably) TV moment of all time. Worst for me was Unser's. I know he got in the way a lot and all but he always meant good. I wanted him to outlive everyone. Because jax killed him I wasn't all that bummed when he took his own life in the finale.
Sonsofanarchy,3d24y3,BeardedGirl,-1,Sat Jul 18 06:00:49 2015 UTC,Stahl was the most satisfying. Opie's was the worst. I saw Opie's coming though. His entire demeanor had changed once he found out that Clay was the one responsible for Donna's death.  I also rooted for Tara to get killed. I just didn't see Gemma being the one to do it. After all the BS she put Jax through I said every week that Jax was going to kill her.
Sonsofanarchy,3d24y3,WWJaxD1973,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:26:32 2015 UTC,All the BS she put Jax through? Really? You're right - the career criminal who constantly puts club business over family is the victim here...
Sonsofanarchy,3d24y3,CreepyAbelTeller,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:07:35 2015 UTC,"Yes, all the BS she put him through. He told her how things were going to be and tried several times to get her to leave but she always refused and even started trying to assert herself as the next Gemma. But once she got in trouble she decided she was done. That was completely understandable but faking a pregnancy and then setting someone up like she did was wrong. Trying to run off with the boys, when she isn't even biological mother of one, was wrong. Setting Jax up so he couldn't get any type of custody of his kids was wrong. Leaving him and then going apeshit on his new woman was wrong. And after knowing everything and then accepting what the club and her husband was she decided to turn states witness to put him and the club away.  Was Jax wrong on multiple occasions? Absolutely. And he tried hard to make both the club and his family top priority. It just wasn't possible. And if the scene where he tried like hell to get Tara to leave, explained to her more of how bad it would get AND cheated on her so she'd go, and then Tara chose to stay, I cannot feel bad for her. I can not feel bad for anyone who KNOWINGLY puts themselves into a situation and then screws everyone over to get out of it.   PLUS when Jax told her to go he even said she could take the boys to Oregon and she chose not to. And then in the end she didn't even discuss it with him. She just went anti-Jax. So since you chose to be sarcastic and/or snarky with your reply would you care to explain why I'm the bad guy here?"
Sonsofanarchy,3d0dwq,Empire_Lifts_Back,28,Sun Jul 12 13:02:25 2015 UTC,"I didn't want to write mine in the post, but my favorite would have to be Stephen King. He appeared as Bachman (he used to write under pseudonym Richard Bachman in the late 70's) in season 3. He helped Gemma, Tara and Tig clean up the body of Gemma's dad's caretaker and I think the role, despite being so brief, fits him to perfection and even though he isn't known for his acting chops, he did an awesome job."

Thomas follows in his mums steps and becomes a doctor, making the mother he never knew proud. And the mother he was raised by proud too. Maybe specialising in spineabifida because their step brother of sorts Lucius struggled with the disease all his life. Abel was more like Jax and was fascinated with motorbikes, maybe he did run a motor repair garage or something. Maybe bikes were just a hobby and he became a teacher, or a Harley salesman!  Perhaps they got occasional visits from their uncle Chibs and Tig growing up. But they heard about what the club did to their mother, father, grandmother and grandfather. Because their uncle Nero who was always more like a father figure to them guided them to be good.  Nero told them about their father, how he was in a club that made him a bad guy. He wasn't a bad guy all the time but once their grandma murdered their mother, their dad had to kill her, because their mum and dad loved eachother very much, and their dad couldn't live with killing his own mother, and he didn't want his sons to be destined to be tied to the same gavel that ruined his life. The boys would know all about how drugs nearly killed Abel, their mother- Wendy and how it caused Lucius' condition. This would lead them away from ever getting involved in that life. Has anyone considered that maybe, just maybe... The boys lived happily ever after? That Abel just put the ring in a box to remind him of all the sacrifices Tara and Jax made to ensure he wasn't doomed to the same fate as the Teller men before him?"
Sonsofanarchy,3cyf9x,AllAboutTheFairytale,2,Sun Jul 12 01:40:41 2015 UTC,I basically said the same thing! :) I definitely agree with you.
Sonsofanarchy,3cyf9x,CreepyAbelTeller,1 point,Sun Jul 12 03:01:49 2015 UTC,"I think Jax's sacrifice meant something; I think it was the event that turns the Sons, even if it's only the Redwood Original chapter, to be 100% legitimate. So if it's a legitimate club where everything's above board and it really IS all about motorcycles and brotherhood, maybe Jax made it the kind of club he would be proud for Abel to lead. He didn't want his sons to glamorize his death and think of him as a hero because he wasn't, but it doesn't mean that the charter wouldn't be a positive influence if he joined."

Sonsofanarchy,3cyf9x,iamirishpat,6,Sun Jul 12 00:54:58 2015 UTC,"Thomas sighed as he entered the same information into the computer for the third time in as many hours. It's 2035, why do I still need to do this shit?. Thomas saw an interdepartment chat request from his older brother, pop up on his screen. Come on Abel, you've called me three times and I didn't pick up. Obviously I'm busy, get the hint.   ""Detective Teller?"" Thomas looked up at the patrolman by his desk. ""Your brother is in the lobby, the captain said we can't let him in after last time, but he says he has to talk to you.""  ""Tommy! You little fucking shit! Pick up your goddamn phone or come out here"" Thomas sighed and rose from his desk. This is why you never get promoted Abel. Your goddamn temper.   A small crowd had gathered in the lobby by the time the two borthers met. Thomas lowered his voice as he spoke to his brother, ""You might not take your fucking job seriously, but this is my goddamn career. You better have a great excuse for this ridicu-""  ""Uncle Nero's been shot"".     ""Hey Abel""  Thomas reached over and shook his brother. ""Abel!""  ""What?!""   ""What do you remember about Charming?""  ""It was shit""  ""Yeah but, mom and dad grew up here""  ""It still sucked, let me sleep""  Thomas had never had a reason to visit Charming in the past. No one ever spoke about it. He'd read everything he could find about his father and the Sons of Anarchy in the police database, but no one had ever told him anything growing That was enough to make him share in this hatred of the small town.     ""Thomas, wake your ass up, we're here"".   ""Already? How fast did you go? I knew I shouldn't have let you drive""  ""Shut up. Look at this shit""  Thomas rubbed his eyes and squinted as the world came into focus. As the scene became clear he felt his heart race. There dozens of motorcycles, he assumed Harleys in the parking lot of the hospital. Groups of men in leather vests huddled near the entrances of the hospital.   Thomas and Abel exchanged a glance as the car came to a stop. Both men reached behind their back to check that their guns were easily accessible. Abel spoke first. ""What. The. Fuck.""  ""Stay calm bro""  ""Stay calm?! These fuckers ruined our lives, of course they're fucking caught up in this.""  ""If they were behind what ever happened to Nero, they wouldn't be here right now.""  ""Whatever, you don't fucking understand.""  Thomas winced as his brother slammed the car door and walked towards the hospital. A group of Sons stood at the front door. As their eyes turned towards Abel, Thomas knew the outcome would be violence.   ""Who are you?"" The largest of the group, a black man with a men of mayhem patch, walked towards Abel.   ""None of your fucking business."" Thomas sighed and joined his brothers side. He hated getting in fights, especially now that they were supposed to uphold the law. His brother's temper had gotten him into a lot of them. Thomas had always followed his older brother into the fray. He'd always followed Abel, even now he noticed that he dressed just like his older brother, jeans and white sneakers, their long blonde hair sitting just above their shoulders.   Thomas smiled and spoke before his brother could. ""We're just here to visit our uncle. You fellas have a nice day."" As he walked past, one of the members put his hand on his chest and pushed him back. Thomas went to pull the hand away, but the body attached to it was already falling to the ground, his brothers fist connecting with its owner's head. Thomas saw the largest of the gangsters coming towards his brother, and put his knee in his stomach. The pair fought only as brothers could, but other members had joined the fight and the two quickly found themselves taking more hits than they were giving.    Thomas looked over at his brother, a gray haired member had shoved him against the wall. Thomas winced as his brother broke free and punched the old man in the face. The old man stepped back and started yelling.   ""Oi, fuck are you idiots doing?"" Thomas heard the fighting come to a sudden stop. ""Ye have any idea who these two are?"" The old man's words brought the fighting to a standstill. Even Abel restrained himself. The old man turned towards Abel again. ""Ye got Jacky boy's right hook, that's for sure."""

I think it would be cooler to see them in a new setting and somehow the Sons influence would reach them, in the form of a new charter or something."
Sonsofanarchy,3cyf9x,TheLastNomad,2,Sat Jul 11 22:39:32 2015 UTC,Well Abel would return because he wants in with the Sons. Thomas could get assigned there out of the academy.

I just think it would be more interesting (and make Jaxs sacrifice worth a damn) to see the two boys grow up without SoA around them, and then to see Jaxs actions for the club make them prosper and spread to where Abel and Thomas are. Which makes Abel think about what he remembers, which would tear the two very close brothers apart, what with thimas having no memories or very little knowledge of the club.  I just think that having the two boys go back to charming would not go down well with Nero and Wendy, and would seem too expected or something."

Other police officers are called in and we end up seeing Tig or chibs gunned down by Thomas. Abel ends up becoming a bounty hunter and starts to hear stories of samcro and how they use to rule charming and the surrounding areas. Abel ends up becoming drawn to samcro putting him at ends with Thomas.(queue some progression between them to the point Thomas becomes deputy chief and Abel a full fledged member of samcro upon showing the ring to Tig/Chibs) and butting heads again as Abel tries to expand samcro once more(against everything jax did)."

And then the return of Abel signals a need for club restructuring?"
Sonsofanarchy,3cyf9x,Tarkleigh,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:41:56 2015 UTC,"A sequel is very interesting but it is also harder to do than a prequel since it would remove an ambiguity from the original ending and whoever makes it has to be very carefull not the make Jax's action meaningless. Not just for Abel and Thomas but for the Sons. Are they still legit? Or have they gone outlaw again? If yes, how do they think about Jax?  Also, the sequel would likely be set in the late 2020 or early 2030, making it mild sci-fi compared to now. I personally like sci-fi and could imagine doing some cool stuff (everone driving Harleys with organic fuel or the Sons peddling illegal gene therapys) but I am unsure how well this would mix with the MC lifestyle.   But these problems aside, I think it would be a very cool idea. Maybe Abel can get close to Kenny (Ope's son) so we would have a mirror to Jax and Opie. And there would be so much potential for awesome scenes. The boys visting  Jax's grave, maybe swapping stories with the old veterans, maybe there is no Jax's motorcycle in the new clubhouse. Or a huge wall remembering the fallen brothers like Bobby, Opie, Jax and maybe even Juice.   Shit, maybe I have to write it myself"

Sonsofanarchy,3cty5m,giantJim,6,Sat Jul 11 03:30:08 2015 UTC,They try and promote themselves with a more positive image from time to time. I'm sure he is distanced from the day to day operations since he is in the public eye now. Barger did this when he wrote his book and when the Altamont case was closed.  I remember an interview he did with a local radio show in Atlanta over the phone. One DJ kind of poked fun and he got upset. The other DJ who was known to be a wise ass and make fun of any caller was quickly respectful and refused to say anything negative about Barger or the HA since he was familiar that with them and knew disrespectful behavior could be punished by some HA or affiliate club even though they barely have any presence here.

You did read the title of the thread where it says TIL - Today I Learned. Emphasis on the I as it was on that day that I learned this piece of information.
Sonsofanarchy,3cty5m,andrewsj1,-8,Sat Jul 11 20:15:06 2015 UTC,Ya but see... This is the SOA subreddit. It's not like the water cooler at work with people who casually watch the show. Hell even the TIL sub would have been more appropriate cuz some people there might not know that. Pretty much anyone on here could tell you that. There's mutliple threads dedicated to what characters and cameos are in what clubs. Rusty Coones is the founder of the Orange County Hells Angels. Sonny Barger was the founding president of Oakland HA. It's as though you walked into a Star Wars convention and started teling people that you just learned some trivia about Star Wars that everyone in the room knew years ago...  Sorry to piss in your Cheerios but it is what it is.

Sonsofanarchy,3cy3l6,Mr-WTF,7,Sat Jul 11 20:50:41 2015 UTC,"Story wise, Clay definitely did have his longer. Costume department wise, the cuts would have been created at the same time but one part of that departments job would be to make everything look as authentic to the story as possible. They would distress Clay's cut to give it a longer worn look."
Sonsofanarchy,3cy3l6,thatsnotmyrealname_,2,Sat Jul 11 21:58:42 2015 UTC,"I liked how very personal each cut was. Bobby's had silver bricbrac sewn on, Clay's was more an actual leather vest, Jax and Opie's were racer style with the snap button collar. I don't think Opie's had the higher waist in the back that Jax's had, which is classic motorcycle jacket styling. The details like that were just as interesting to me as the background we were outright given."
Sonsofanarchy,3cy3l6,Badger_Silverado,4,Sat Jul 11 22:37:17 2015 UTC,"He isn't saying the costume guys/girls made Clay's 10 years in advance, he's saying that Clay has been a member longer, therefore it wouldn't make sense for Clay's to look brand new and shiny."

Sonsofanarchy,3cy3l6,Tkavil,3,Sun Jul 12 11:42:35 2015 UTC,Clay and Jax are not the same age and they did not patch into SAMCRO at same time. Clay was one of the first nine. They don't get new kutte's every 10 years. Clay would have realistically had his kutte for A LOT longer than Jax.
Sonsofanarchy,3cy3l6,CreepyAbelTeller,2,Sun Jul 12 14:45:11 2015 UTC,Makes sense- for the show to seem authentic they can't both have brand new cutte's. Clay had hoc cute much longer than Jax!

Sonsofanarchy,3ckdxz,AllAboutTheFairytale,6,Wed Jul 8 16:29:18 2015 UTC,Then why didn't juice get one?
Sonsofanarchy,3ckdxz,AllAboutTheFairytale,12,Wed Jul 8 17:21:42 2015 UTC,"Unholy Ones - Like many biker patches, the real meaning of this one is debated. Some say it means that the wearer has killed for the club; others say that it is a reference to when a member is ordered to do a hit on a fellow member of the club, making them Unholy in carrying out a deed usually met with death for killing another member. Happy is a known assassin and Clay is known to have killed at least 3 members already.  This is what the internet said!"

Sonsofanarchy,3ckdxz,mandrews909,17,Wed Jul 8 17:39:10 2015 UTC,"He didn't get the unholy one patch because at the time, Miles' death wasn't a club-based decision. It was a spur of the moment kill. Juice did that as a cowardly form of self preservation, as a means of preventing the club finding out it was him stealing the coke from them. It wasn't voted on and it wasn't a hit that was ordered, carried out, etc., it was just Juice acting of his own accord."

That said, we had no idea that the Northern California would blow the fuck up shortly after Jax became the prez. The pressure and responsibilities were COMPLETELY out of control.  Jax is right- it is most definitely no easy being king haha"
Sonsofanarchy,3cg4pq,TyredditorusRex,8,Tue Jul 7 18:32:50 2015 UTC,"Opie is literally just foreshadowing of Jax. When you first meet him he is trying to stay away from the club, and go straight, and his wife wants him out even worse than he does. He lingers however, and ends up reintegrating himself with time. His wife dies as a result of his continued involvement with the club, which causes him to at first lose himself (kinda like when you see Jax ripping the teeth outta someone's head in the first episode of season 7), and then go all in with the club, more dedicated than ever before. Eventually he sacrifices himself to save Tig (Jax basically kills himself to keep SAMCRO from having to either kill him or deal with the fallout from other chapters alongside him), leaving behind two children and an ex who never could quite live up to his deceased wife.  He's like Jax a couple years ahead of schedule."

Flash forward to after Opie has died, the episode where the club goes to handle the torture porn crew on the docks that hurt Lyla (S6E1). When Jax asks Lyla why she went to the Persians, she says she needed money since she's taking care of three kids now. He follows up by asking why she didn't say something, and she says, ""I don't take charity.""  Nothing major, but an interesting bit I noticed during my rewatch."

Sonsofanarchy,3cin0t,jwith44,2,Wed Jul 8 05:08:43 2015 UTC,When I first watched it I hated it. But maybe it's just the lack of creativity I had I didn't see it ending any other way.   Granted with the long episodes for season 7 it would be better if they didn't try and incorporate so much filler but ultimately how else would it have ended to stay close to the hamlet tale without being an exact replica.
Sonsofanarchy,3cin0t,justmighthaveto,2,Wed Jul 8 06:39:01 2015 UTC,"I just finished rewatching the entire show.  First time I loved the ending. Second time through I got the feeling that there was SO much more that could have been done. That moment was epic, with the chase and all, but it was missing something.  Perhaps a voice over from his dad? Or maybe something more tragic to start the show? I mean with everything that happened it really wasnt a tragedy. Jax' journey from episode 1 to the final episode is an incredible arc but did Jax really pay the price or suffer for his impulses. He turned into Clay, the man he hated, yet it did not seem to play out like that on screen.   Breaking Bad took Walter White and devastated him in the final season. I wish Sutter had the balls to have done something like that to Jax. Have everyone hate him, have his impulses against the Chinese come back and REALLY haunt him with more death and tragedy. Jax should have been a ruined man when he took his way out. I just didnt get that epic character arc that Walter White had."
Sonsofanarchy,3cin0t,JaxTeller718,2,Thu Jul 9 09:57:06 2015 UTC,"I disagree that there could have been much more done with the ending (except maybe the voice over JT- great idea). But other than that, the ending was perfect in my opinion. Here's why: from episode one, it is clear that this is Jax's story. As a viewer, I really fell in love with the dichotomy of the outlaw hero. Jax is a brutal criminal but at the same time tries to use his intellect, criminality and brutality to help his family, his friends, and his club.   When Tara is murdered, that goes out the window. He is literally devastated by her death, and all of the carnage and destroyed relationships that follow are as a direct result. Sutter then takes this broken man, and leads him on a bloody rampage to exact his revenge. Jax knows full well that the massacre of the Diosa Del Norte girls (including Collette), the wrongful murder of Jury, and the brutal torture and murder of Bobby (in front of him no less), lands squarely on his shoulders. And as if the weight of all of that isn't enough, he is lead to realization that everything (Tara's murder and everything that followed) came as a result of the greatest betrayal in the entire series at the hands of the queen of lies and secrets, Gemma. Imagine the mental anguish that must have befallen Jax not only to learn that everything was his fault and based on a lie, but also that he had been betrayed by one of the few people that has always supported him and that he truly loved, his mother. Combined with murdering Unser, I was shocked that he didn't off himself there in the garden with Gemma.   Taking all that into consideration, there is no other way that the series could have ended. Killing Gemma was the last straw for Jax. There was literally no coming back from that, and he knew it. Perhaps being able to so easily clean house on all of the loose ends was a bit unrealistic, but why not. SOA would have done it pretty quickly anyway. Might as well let our hero go out in a blaze of glory. And as for everyone hating him, most of SOA does. The presidents recommended (and pretty much told him) that the Mayhem vote had to pass (or the implication was that civil war would break out). There is literally nothing that Jax could have done to lose the love of the brothers in the Redwood Original charter. So it would have been unrealistic for them to actually carry out the death sentence. To do so would have not only broken the character who carried it out, but also irreparably shattered the charter.   In the end, seeing Jax go out probably the same exact way that his dad did for basically the same reasons was pure poetic justice. Not to mention that The White Buffalo absolutely killed it with ""Come Join the Murders"". In the end, the bad guys lose."
Sonsofanarchy,3cin0t,UGHfineILLjoin,2,Fri Jul 10 01:30:48 2015 UTC,This is a beautiful analysis of the finale. Made me rethink my own issues with it.
Sonsofanarchy,3cin0t,CreepyAbelTeller,6,Sun Jul 12 03:08:03 2015 UTC,"I loved the ending. I thought it was brilliant.  It was roughly based on hamlet, if it had exactly the same story there would have been no shocks, Kurt Sutter is not the type of guy to be happy with predictability. I hated the ending when I watched it, just because I didn't want Jax to die, but I have analysed it a lot since then and I think the ending was pretty spectacular. I loved it!"

BUT we all know that the club would have supported Jax if he had decided to leave the club and respect Tara's wishes (she was a bitch but she was right) Hell they probably would have helped get him into hiding.

This is why Happy is prepared for Chibs to shoot him in the arm (to make Jax's ""escape"" look legitimate).  The farewells were said since he would be leaving. He would be on the run and presumably unable to return without risking the other charters finding him and enforcing the Mayhem vote. The guys did not expect to see Jax again, though they didn't know his final piece of the plan."

I feel like opies character didn't really have a personality so I wasn't a big fan of him. And Tara. Tara's character seemed like the most annoying person in the world and if I spent a second with her I'd have to punch her I the face. She was just such a bitch. Even worse was Margaret Murphy
Sonsofanarchy,3cgjwn,TeamStark31,3,Wed Jul 8 15:44:59 2015 UTC,"""I had a love/hate relationship with Wendy. I kept rooting for her and Jax to get back together, but it didn't happen until the very end, and then it was over as fast as it started. She was a much better fit for Jax than Tara was.""  ^ I will never, in a million years, understand this logic. Even if you hate Tara - which you clearly do - in what world is Wendy a better fit? You do realize she literally had to LEAVE that world to get healthy. Being around the club drove her deeper into drugs. That immediately makes her a terrible fit for Jax's lifestyle. Jax needed someone who was emotionally strong (as he was the very opposite)- and Wendy was the exact opposite. And the real kicker is that Jax wanted NOTHING to do with her. He shat all over their marriage - telling Tara how it was a sad time out and then straight up told Wendy in Season 1 that he hated her when he found out she was preggers and that he never wanted to be married. This was all said when he was actually somewhat compassionate and caring towards her. Not to mention, HE PHYSICALLY ATTACKED HER!! And threatened to do it again in Season 6. He completely and intentionally compromised her sobriety. How anyone can get past that is beyond me. I don't even understand how Wendy got past that - selective amnesia and all. He would have killed her at a certain point. He ignored her very existence in the final season until the Abel-mommy reveal and that wasn't for the sake of Wendy or even his own son. He needed a quick fix for what he believed was Abel's problem, so instead of consulting Wendy or I don't know, a fking self-help manual, he further traumatizes his child by telling him that he came out of this lady's (who for all we know Abel thought was his babysitter) tummy. Jax was a shitty partner to Tara at times but there's no denying that he really genuinely loved her. The thought of physically harming her never ever was a reality. But Wendy? He was awful to her. There's no full circle with them. He dumped his kids with her and didn't even care to tell her what he was doing - instead, asked Nero to unpack all of his damage."
Sonsofanarchy,3cgjwn,TeamStark31,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:21:26 2015 UTC,"Ok. If I understand this right, Jax killed himself mostly because of his kids. Nero and Wendy were to take them away from the club life, and Jax thought if he was around, they'd grow up to be like him in the way he grew up to be just like his dad. The Teller blood is pretty much poison, and from his point of view, that was the only way for them to grow up without the club's influence. This was also meant to clear his charter of their duty to kill him for killing Jury, even though he could have ran for it."
Sonsofanarchy,3cgjwn,TheExtremeChef2,2,Fri Jul 10 00:32:51 2015 UTC,"This was also meant to clear his charter of their duty to kill him for killing Jury, even though he could have ran for it.   This is what I gathered as well.  It was supposed to look like he escaped Mr. Mayhem and made a run for it.  While I like how he ultimately got to decide his own fate, I still don't understand why the whole club made a big scene like they were going to execute him.  If the plan all along was to have him make a run for it, why not sit down with him, have a few beers and say goodbye?"
Sonsofanarchy,3cgjwn,TinaBBlueberryGirl,3,Tue Jul 7 21:26:53 2015 UTC,"Because if they didn't do that, it would look like they let Jax go, and the other charters wouldn't be satisfied they'd at least tried to kill him."

Why not just shoot Hap, bandage him up, have a couple beers and then send Jax on his way?    Why were they pretending like they were going to execute Jax?  No one other than the Sons were there."

So it makes sense for there to be some literal embodiment of death in their universe. In this case, it takes the form of homeless woman. Whenever she appears, someone almost always ends up dying or has died recently. Then we see that even more clearly when in the series finale,  she says to Jax ""its time,"" then he ends up dying too.  She's a very interesting character,  and im glad Sutter put her in."

If you noticed almost every time something tragic or crazy happens the first words always uttered are ""Jesus Christ"" whether it be Clay, Jax, Gemma or Unser, even chibs says it a lot.. If you were to count how many times its been said through out the series I'd say it's around just as many times as the word SAMCRO..

Sonsofanarchy,3cbcus,Midnightfish,1 point,Mon Jul 13 09:40:06 2015 UTC,exactly what I thought too.
Sonsofanarchy,3cafg1,mjr1234,7,Mon Jul 6 10:53:19 2015 UTC,"Meh, she pointed a gun at his family, including his baby. That's pretty serious. A man probably wouldn't have got off that easy.   I think what he did to Wendy was worse."
Sonsofanarchy,3cafg1,fuschialotus,8,Mon Jul 6 14:31:06 2015 UTC,"I think what he did to Wendy was worse.    As a sober recovering alcoholic when he injected that speedball into her arm after her struggling all those years and being sober for so long I wanted to kill Jax.  So yeah, I wholeheartedly agree here that what he did to Wendy was far worse than what he did to Ima."
Sonsofanarchy,3cafg1,asstasticbum,4,Mon Jul 6 15:03:38 2015 UTC,Coming back here because I just got to that point and holy fuck. That is the worst thing he's done and it definitely shows how badly his character has lost morality.
Sonsofanarchy,3cafg1,bcraig10488,5,Sun Jul 12 06:28:22 2015 UTC,The guy clearly says he's only on season 4 so far and you guys are talking about this? I mean I know the 'rule' is season 7 only but come on!
Sonsofanarchy,3cafg1,CreepyAbelTeller,3,Mon Jul 6 18:22:09 2015 UTC,"What he did to Wendy, IMO, is the worst thing he pretty much ever did on the show. And that's why I will never fucking understand Wendy's nonsensical Season 7 arc - where she pines for the idiot who not only compromised her sobriety but NEARLY KILLED HER."
Sonsofanarchy,3cafg1,bcraig10488,3,Tue Jul 7 02:14:04 2015 UTC,I don't think it had as much to do with her pulling a gun as it did her being a homewrecker. He was standing up for his best friend's marriage in my opinion. It was a good moment though.
Sonsofanarchy,3cafg1,marshallgivens,2,Mon Jul 6 12:07:37 2015 UTC,"I don't think it was about her being a homewrecker because by that same logic, Opie is a homewrecker. Obviously there are double standards for men and women in the SOA world but Jax's speech to Opie right after he caught him with Ima was pretty telling - he blamed Opie as much as Ima for cheating on Lyla. Jax attacked Ima because she pulled a gun on his wife and his mother - in front of his child. I'm sure there was a part of him that was sticking up for Opie but it had more to do with her confronting his family with a gun."

Sonsofanarchy,3cafg1,CreepyAbelTeller,1 point,Mon Jul 13 09:25:30 2015 UTC,"It's a hard scene to watch even though Ima is literally the worst (and her ratchet hair makes me want to vomit). Jax had a rule in previous seasons where the club does not harm women or children. You could see how conflicted he was in what he had just done, as he's walking out of her dressing room. That being said, the obvious misogyny is hard to digest. Opie's dick didn't just fall into her. He made the choice. Just like Jax pulled a dick move in Season 3 and CHOSE to sleep with the hoe."
Sonsofanarchy,3cafg1,jps815,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:17:15 2015 UTC,I don't really think Jax was that conflicted. I mean he spit in her face after doing it.
Sonsofanarchy,3cafg1,marshallgivens,1 point,Tue Jul 7 04:44:58 2015 UTC,He was conflicted - not because of her specifically - but because it was a woman and he lived by a certain code: no harming women and children. You could tell when he walked away that he was a little disgusted at what he had done.

Engl. coat) but that is also, in a tongue-in-cheek fashion, used for Cut-offs.  A cut-off, also known as a kutte or ""battle jacket"" / ""battlevest"" in heavy metal subcultures, is a type of vest or jacket which originated in the biker subculture and has now found popularity in the punk and various heavy metal subcultures. Biker, metal and punk subcultures differ in how the garment itself is prepared, what decorations are applied, and how this is done.  a."

Sonsofanarchy,3c5cgq,marshallgivens,10,Sat Jul 4 23:11:17 2015 UTC,"I don't think Tara settled for Jax. She had left charming and had opportunities to settle down with other people, and if she wasn't so drawn to jax, she could have built a life anywhere. She was a doctor who was beautiful. She didn't settle, she loved Jax.  I can see what she saw in Jax. He was kind and compassionate with her, but he adored his children, he loved his mother, he loved his brothers. He was an incredibly loyal person who I honestly believed was good for more of the time he was bad.  Tara wasn't as good at heart as she wanted to be. She was always a bit of a bad ass biker old lady. It's a case of you can take the girl out of charming, but you can't take charming out of the girl. Jax gave her the opportunity to leave on a couple of occasions, but she stayed. I think it was a brilliant love story. And I never hated Tara, I always loved her, I understood why she faked the miscarriage. I didn't agree with it, but I got it. Jax thought she was too good for him for a while, but Tara was his one true love, and vice versa. I'd have loved for them to drive into the sunset with the boys. I was a massive fan of the ""fairytale"" ending I had in my head. Gemma soon stuck a fork in that idea though. I was prepared for the tragedy though deep down, a story based on hamlet was never going to end happy!"
Sonsofanarchy,3c5cgq,AllAboutTheFairytale,2,Sat Jul 4 23:43:42 2015 UTC,"I like your take on it - and I do agree! I don't think Tara was as good at heart as she wanted to be either. She wasn't entirely good or entirely bad. And I don't doubt her love for Jax at all. I understand that she loved him deeply (as he did her). It was her love for him that pulled her back in when her head was cautioning her to stay away. It's like when she says to him in Season 4 when he asks her if she loves him, ""if I could stop, I would.""  But sometimes two people who may be destined to be together can still be very toxic for one another. And as much as I did like them together, it was a case of when it was good it was great and when it was bad it was someone-getting-forked-in-the kitchen terrible.   Old ladies aren't successful doctors and educated surgeons - at least in the SOA world. They are porn stars, croweaters, and junkies. Jax was appreciative of Tara in the first half of the series but it was like once he ""got"" her, he didn't think marriage required any work."
Sonsofanarchy,3c5cgq,AllAboutTheFairytale,2,Sun Jul 5 00:04:15 2015 UTC,"I get what you are saying. But I think Jax knew that their relationship would never be easy, but it was the purest relationship he would ever have, with the exceptions of Abel and Thomas. I think in the world of bikers Jax never really treated women as equals, he treated them like they needed to be protected and cared for, because I think that's what Gemma waned from him all his life. But I do think he treated Tara different from other women, she was treated as his equal, and I think she took care of his needs far more often than Jax took care of her.  You see a massive contrast in season 4 episode 2 where lyla asks opie if the club had any involvement in the Russians deaths, and Ope says no, and then it cuts to Jax and Tara, and Tara asks the same question, and Jax tells her the truth. Jax was very open and honest with Tara up until about season 5, but Tara started being dishonest with him first if I remember right, by covering up how the visits with Otto were going.  I was shouting at them in my mind to just communicate!  But no other club member was as attentive a husband as Jax was."
Sonsofanarchy,3c5cgq,AllAboutTheFairytale,1 point,Sun Jul 5 01:06:59 2015 UTC,"""I think she took care of his needs far more often than Jax took care of her.""  ^ Yes, exactly! I do think he treated her and only her (not any other woman - including his own mother) as an equal - but that's exactly it... on paper, she's definitely NOT his equal. She's far better off. And even from a moral standpoint, she has way more of a conscience than he ever did. I can't get past his A-hole behavior in Season 3 and 6. And it's not just the cheating. It's the entire ""me me me"" mentality. And for what it's worth, this is making me sound like I'm very pro-Tara and anti-Jax, and that's not the case at all. I both love and hate each of these characters in equal measure."
Sonsofanarchy,3c5cgq,bmomma76,2,Sun Jul 5 01:18:30 2015 UTC,"I agree neither of them were perfect, but I do think as a couple, they worked. If they had remained open and honest with eachother it would have been fine. They cared for eachother more than they cared for themselves. I did adore both of them. I never got the whole Tara hate thing at all. I think Tara was smart, that's why she was a doctor, Jax was smart ""as smart as he is dangerous"" as Patterson says. He just used his brains in a different way to Tara. I enjoyed this chat haha, I love discussing alternative points of views with people! It's interesting!"
Sonsofanarchy,3c5cgq,Kimchidiary,1 point,Sun Jul 5 01:25:25 2015 UTC,Nah Tara was not too good for Jax at all. Like Jax told her he didn't force his life on her plus he gave her many outs that she didn't take. Tara put dick before her career and kids. There's just so much love for a person before you become stupid over it. Hated her in s6. All she had to do was talk to Jax. She was a criminal. Her trying to best Gemma failed big time. She did some really stupid shit and it came back on her.
Sonsofanarchy,3c5cgq,kampfgruppekarl,0,Mon Jul 20 03:06:23 2015 UTC,"I find Tara very manipulative and I think she's incredibly cold hearted and resentful of the child's real mother.  (A friend of mine had a very bad experience with his ex and completely disagrees.  So I know that's not popular, and yes despite the drug issue- she cleans herself up).  I'm not sure why a surgeon who must make a ton of money would live in such a hovel though.  I don't think she's too good for him, she has flaws that balance out his negative flaws.  I think Jax is more emotionally driven than she is though."
Sonsofanarchy,3c5cgq,Irish_Ent,1 point,Sun Jul 5 21:09:00 2015 UTC,"How is she resentful? She was the one who actually helped Wendy when she overdosed in the first episode.

If anything, Tara was the only person giving Wendy a chance when everyone else thought she was some stupid junkie."

After Jax beat the shit out of him and then killed him she could of left, she didnt. Jax even tells her to go on many occasions. You're just very wrong."
Sonsofanarchy,3c5cgq,Irish_Ent,7,Sun Jul 5 07:09:12 2015 UTC,"I do know why she came back. Did YOU forget that she was going to leave at the end of Season 1 and Jax threw a temper tantrum in the hospital and laid his heart out on the table and told her she was about to stomp on it again? This isn't a scenario where Tara stuck around, like some stage five clinger. He begged for her to stay and she made the decision to stay. They are BOTH held accountable for that. And in Season 3 and 4, when she could have (and probably should have) left, she was either pregnant and/or too believing of Jax's promises that they would leave post-RICO. In any case, that doesn't change the fact that Tara may very well be too good for Jax.   Also, it's an opinion - so please refrain from the matter-of-fact ""you're just very wrong"" diatribe."
Sonsofanarchy,3c5cgq,lylateller,-4,Sun Jul 5 14:11:35 2015 UTC,"Your treating her like shes an innocent, she assults people, threatens them, helps Jemma murder and plans a perfect murder for Clay. I like tara but she deserves almost everything that happens."
Sonsofanarchy,3c5cgq,Irish_Ent,7,Sun Jul 5 15:31:47 2015 UTC,"How am I treating her like she's innocent? In my original post I stated that there was a level of personal responsibility. That clearly indicates she's not at all innocent. That being said, if she deserves almost everything that happens, we live by two very different moral codes. She didn't deserve to go down because of the club (Otto and his need for vengeance) and she certainly didn't deserve a fork in the head."
Sonsofanarchy,3c5cgq,CreepyAbelTeller,-2,Sun Jul 5 17:57:02 2015 UTC,"I agree she didnt deserve that end, nor did she deserve the creepy ATF guy. Jax told her not to go to Otto that it was too risky, then when she landed herself in the shit he made a deal to take the hit. You give her too much credit and him too little."
Sonsofanarchy,3c5cgq,Irish_Ent,2,Sun Jul 5 18:34:12 2015 UTC,"I don't see it as giving her too much credit. I think I'm giving her the credit that's due while pointing out that Jax did more for the club - and really himself - than his own wife and family. Even in the end, he died a member of the club - wearing his kutte and on his bike. He told the club he was sorry the family he was given caused so much chaos in the family he chose - as in Gemma causing chaos in both the family he made with Tara and his other family being the club. That's incredibly negligent considering the club is a HUGE reason why his life was the way it was and a big part of Tara's demise. Gemma is just as much of the club as she is his mother. The fact that he saw both things as isolated parts of him is crazy.   Do I think Tara was incredibly shortsighted in her attempts to help the club via Otto? Absolutely. She should have never agreed to do it or at least considered Otto's warning when he said not to come back. That being said, Otto framing Tara was entirely Otto turning on the club and paying Jax back for what happened to LuAnn. So, in reality - Tara went down, her career completely destroyed - less so because of her wanting to help squash RICO and more so because of Jax's earlier actions (going off on the porn producer who killed LuAnn)."
Sonsofanarchy,3c5cgq,lylateller,-1,Sun Jul 5 19:16:20 2015 UTC,"Jax was raised from birth that the club comes first, above family or duty. Jemma was even encouraging him to shoot her in the head for what she did to the club. Jemma caused so much damage from the start not just getting bobby killed, she basically forced the Jax/Clay rift is season 1. At the end Jax burned all the books, pictures everything so all his sons would know is that their father was an outlaw, a murder, a bad man. Tara was a skilled doctor, she could of taken the kids away at any time, her urge to stay and try to save Jax was her downfall, but Jax never asked her to visit Otto he was against it. So he cleaned up his mess, set his sons free, protected his brothers and died how a biker should go, at high speed on two wheel."
Sonsofanarchy,3c5cgq,Irish_Ent,3,Sun Jul 5 19:56:36 2015 UTC,"she assults people, threatens them, helps Jemma murder and plans a perfect murder for Clay   And you can apply everything to Jax as well. Assault: every damn episode. Threatening: add that as well. Murdering: pretty much everyone has killed someone by now. Plans a perfect murder for Clay: pretty much EVERYONE wanted Clay to die. It was a unanimous mayhem vote.  Seriously you don't have an argument? What did she do that other people did not? How did she deserve to be brutally murdered for nothing?"
Sonsofanarchy,3c5cgq,CreepyAbelTeller,-2,Sun Jul 5 19:17:02 2015 UTC,I already said she didnt deserve the end she met. Jax is an outlaw... murder and assult are his job. All I'm saying is Tara was a Doctor (and a smart one at that) but made stupid choice after stupid choice. Instead of faking a misscarriage she could of posined Jemma.
Sonsofanarchy,3c5cgq,Irish_Ent,4,Sun Jul 5 20:07:25 2015 UTC,"""Jax is an outlaw... murder and assault are his job.""  Wait, what?! That's like saying, he has a right to be a psycho, killing machine. That isn't his JOB. That's super strange that you would rationalize it as something he's supposed to do. His job is to be a husband, father, and NOT a criminal. That's the righteous path - the one he wanted to go on and pushed for but always came up short. Murder and assaulting people were his choices - terrible choices that never existed in a vacuum and ended up hurting his family more often than not.    Also, how is poisoning Gemma the better choice? That's comparing two evils. Tara faked a miscarriage not to KILL Gemma - but to keep her legally away from her children. Tara's intention wasn't to physically harm and/or murder the woman."
Sonsofanarchy,3c5cgq,lylateller,1 point,Sun Jul 5 20:21:07 2015 UTC,"I didnt say it was right, but that is what he was raised to consider acceptable from birth. His own mother has told him to kill people many times. Jax's duty is to be a husband and father, his job was criminal and like Opie said there is no escape for guys like them only death.  Yes, but not pressing charges allowed Gemma to get out... has Gemma ever taken any shit? No. Would Gemma give up? No. Do you honestly believe Gemma would give a flying fuck about a court order? The whole miscarriage was to keep her kids safe, but it was a half measure. Half measures always fail."
Sonsofanarchy,3c5cgq,CreepyAbelTeller,3,Mon Jul 6 06:44:45 2015 UTC,"Okay, I'm not following you at ALL. So you are saying that instead of faking a miscarriage she should have just killed/poisoned Gemma???? How is that ANY better? How is that not a poor decision?"
Sonsofanarchy,3c5cgq,lylateller,-2,Sun Jul 5 20:11:22 2015 UTC,"Jemma was her problem, Jemma was always going to be her problem hence trying to frame her for the misscarriage.

Sonsofanarchy,3c5cgq,Irish_Ent,5,Sun Jul 5 20:19:13 2015 UTC,"You say that Tara was smart, she brought on most of her problems, and she gets too much credit.

Sonsofanarchy,3c6emm,PoisoningPerception,2,Mon Jul 6 07:02:38 2015 UTC,I honestly think the S6 and S7 finales were just as good as the S3 finale.
Sonsofanarchy,3c6emm,JackCuff,1 point,Sun Jul 5 09:03:22 2015 UTC,The best for me was the season 4 opening and the seasons 1 3 and 7 finales
Sonsofanarchy,3c6emm,TheExtremeChef2,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:43:40 2015 UTC,Whoa there - of ANY show?  I thought the Justified Season 3 finale and series finale are arguably the best. SOA's season finale is pretty damn great - maybe the greatest of the series - but I can't say of any show.
Sonsofanarchy,3c6emm,CreepyAbelTeller,2,Sun Jul 5 14:13:51 2015 UTC,"God, Justified's ending was so fucking good."
Sonsofanarchy,3c6emm,iAmMitten1,1 point,Mon Jul 6 01:22:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah it was incredible, the first time I watched it seeing Stahl get killed was fantastic and when they all started laughing I was so confused, I just remember thinking how great of a plan it was when Gemma was reading the letter."
Sonsofanarchy,3c6emm,JackCuff,1 point,Sun Jul 5 09:02:44 2015 UTC,I thought the finale song from season 4 was the absolute best song in the series.
Sonsofanarchy,3c6emm,boggart2,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:53:53 2015 UTC,The finale is very well done but the entire Irish sojourn is beyond parody in its awfulness and let's not even mention the tweedly dee version of the theme tune.
Sonsofanarchy,3c5zgi,xrambino23,11,Sun Jul 5 03:41:06 2015 UTC,"For me it was either Jax walking in finding Tara dead, or when Juice was telling Jax about how Gemma killed Tara, Charlie Hunnams acting in that scene is 10/10."
Sonsofanarchy,3c5zgi,JackCuff,6,Sun Jul 5 09:04:56 2015 UTC,Hunnam killed it with Juice in that scene.   I was blown away at the authenticity of his reaction.
Sonsofanarchy,3c5zgi,SirFoxx,3,Sun Jul 5 11:38:03 2015 UTC,I was honestly blown away. Kids got some real acting chops. Now he just has to put them to good use.
Sonsofanarchy,3c5zgi,pquigs,7,Sun Jul 5 15:48:01 2015 UTC,The saddest part to me was when he was saying goodbye to Abel & Thomas for the last time.  It was pretty gut-wrenching imo.
Sonsofanarchy,3c5zgi,rhcp88,8,Sun Jul 5 08:14:21 2015 UTC,And because he finally acknowledged Thomas!!
Sonsofanarchy,3c5zgi,CreepyAbelTeller,0,Sun Jul 5 14:16:22 2015 UTC,Never did get a 'Thomas' tat did he?
Sonsofanarchy,3c5zgi,cageyfanboy,8,Thu Jul 9 00:36:48 2015 UTC,He had a Thomas tat on his wrist.
Sonsofanarchy,3c5zgi,Mu-Pu,0,Thu Jul 9 18:35:19 2015 UTC,thanks!
Sonsofanarchy,3c5zgi,cageyfanboy,6,Fri Jul 10 03:19:20 2015 UTC,"He had a giant Thomas tattoo. He only completely ignored Thomas in the final season, so the kid got a few months of love from daddio."
Sonsofanarchy,3c5zgi,CreepyAbelTeller,0,Fri Jul 10 00:24:54 2015 UTC,Thanks. I must have missed it.

Sonsofanarchy,3c5zgi,NavyGuy87,3,Sun Jul 5 16:28:07 2015 UTC,Made this thread without realize how many feels it would bring back :(
Sonsofanarchy,3c5zgi,CreepyAbelTeller,7,Sun Jul 5 15:20:26 2015 UTC,Jax walking in on Tara's lifeless body is THE saddest moment of the entire series. Jax Teller lost his soul in that moment. And the series as a whole went down the drain.
Sonsofanarchy,3c5zgi,Mu-Pu,2,Sun Jul 5 14:15:14 2015 UTC,"Strong point, but that scene for me was just shocking. My jaw was dropped for the whole ending of that episode. Jax riding off is the saddest for me because I didn't want the show to end :,("
Sonsofanarchy,3c5zgi,xtremeschemes,2,Sun Jul 5 15:13:16 2015 UTC,"I thought the scene in season 3 where Jax follows Abel and his adoptive parents to the shopping centre in Belfast was really sad. As a father it got me hard that he decided to give his son up, albeit with his best intentions at heart. Brilliant bit of acting."
Sonsofanarchy,3c5zgi,AllAboutTheFairytale,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:55:40 2015 UTC,Honestly the thing that got me was the scene where Gemma tells Jax and Clay about the night she got raped. That whole episode was full of feels
Sonsofanarchy,3c5zgi,AllAboutTheFairytale,1 point,Sun Jul 5 12:57:55 2015 UTC,"Saddest parts for me where, well- my top five moments watched through tears!  1. Jax finding Tara dead. I think I cried as bad as he did. The hopelessness in his cry was haunting!  2. Jax saying bye to Thomas and Abel in the last season. And when Abel says ""I love you too dad"" that just broke my heart. 3. Juice telling Jax that it was Gemma that killed Tara. I think that scene deserves an my. Charlie Hunnam and Theo Rossi acted the hell out of that scene. Jax's shaking and trying not to cry killed me. 4. When Jax said ""I got this"" in the last episode, I knew then what was going to happen, that was him telling the guys he was going to sacrafice himself like opie did. I was in bits watching it!  5. Opie dying. I was absolutely not prepared for that. I loved Opie and I really didn't want him to die. My heart broke for Jax in that scene too!"
Sonsofanarchy,3c5zgi,CreepyAbelTeller,2,Sun Jul 5 14:10:59 2015 UTC,"2 has not left my mind since finishing the series. When he kisses Thomas and hugs Abel and Abel says ""I love you daddy"" and Jax says ""I love you son"" and he almost cries because he knows that's the last time he'll ever see his sons. That part destroys me every time I see it :,("
Sonsofanarchy,3c5zgi,AllAboutTheFairytale,1 point,Sun Jul 5 15:14:55 2015 UTC,It's heartbreaking. It's very hard to watch that scene :(
Sonsofanarchy,3c40we,bwsmg718,22,Sat Jul 4 15:46:06 2015 UTC,"For me, prequel...from First 9 to international MC Powerhouse?  That's a hell of a journey that would be awesome to watch."
Sonsofanarchy,3c40we,washeduplegend,6,Sat Jul 4 16:10:41 2015 UTC,"[SPOILERS] For me, part of the issue with a prequel is predictability. We'd know exactly what happens to JT, we'd know Clay doesn't die, we know Piney doesn't die, and pretty much any unfamiliar characters, we can guess, do die or leave somehow. If it's done right, knowing that wouldn't matter but a sequel would keep us guessing a little bit more."
Sonsofanarchy,3c40we,pinwheelpride,6,Sat Jul 4 16:27:50 2015 UTC,"I get what you're saying with predictability and plot armor etc.  But I would love to see certain events.     Unser's face when Gemma rolls back into town with the MC How/When Gemma and Clay begin to hookup The transition from being Nam vets riding Harleys to running guns Bloody '92 Lenny the Pimp and his ""allegedly"" murdering 3 ATF agents   And there's so much more that could be created"
Sonsofanarchy,3c40we,washeduplegend,1 point,Sat Jul 4 17:32:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it would definitely be interesting. They created a lot in their world and like you said, you could do a whole lot more too. I just wonder if it's sustainable for a TV show where most viewers have a good idea about so many big moments and main characters. Like, Better Call Saul works because while we know he isn't going to die (at least not until the very end, maybe) it's a completely different story with very little overlap to give away the plot.  If we could have some how gotten these events (The Lowells seem like interesting characters too) in the form of elongated flashbacks or entire flashback episodes, that would have been amazing. But that's also asking a ton. I'd be fine with new Sons of Anarchy of any kind, however, despite my preference for a sequel."
Sonsofanarchy,3c40we,pinwheelpride,1 point,Sat Jul 4 17:39:33 2015 UTC,"I mean, you know what happens in the Titanic...  Only kidding. I know what you mean. But I still believe they could give us a compelling story. Maybe I'm biased because I always like origin stories."
Sonsofanarchy,3c40we,wbarker11,8,Mon Jul 6 23:42:19 2015 UTC,"I'd prefer a look at some of the other branches of the Sons during the same period that the show takes place. Seeing how they each have their own problems and then hearing about and seeing the effect of the events in the original series would be cool. Prequel is too predictable, we know what is going to happen, so there would be no suspense, which SOA is a master of."
Sonsofanarchy,3c40we,Samspam126,2,Sat Jul 4 17:38:44 2015 UTC,"That would be kind of cool. A spin off, Sons Of Anarchy: SAMBEL! That'd be tight!"
Sonsofanarchy,3c40we,extensionofme,3,Sat Jul 4 18:02:46 2015 UTC,"I like the characters in the main show, but I think pushing for another series with some of them would spread their characterisation a bit thin. New characters would keep the whole thing fresh and let the writers take more liberties and really stretch their wings a bit more. I think it could be really cool."
Sonsofanarchy,3c40we,Samspam126,2,Sat Jul 4 21:39:03 2015 UTC,And then we'd get the dope-ass Irish intro every episode too
Sonsofanarchy,3c40we,OpieKid,2,Mon Jul 6 08:24:52 2015 UTC,"Oh god no, not unless sutter actually does some research and actually, y'know, meets an Irish person rather than basing the whole thing on the drunken ramblings of some drunk idiot whose closest link to Ireland is his great great great grandfather"
Sonsofanarchy,3c40we,hutchero,5,Mon Jul 6 17:42:47 2015 UTC,"[SPOILER] I would love a sequel. Not too long maybe a season or 2, but just show what happened after Jax died. Show how the club handled it and how it carries on in legit business. See whys going on with Wendy, Nero, and the kids. Just see what's happened after Jax, and what's changed or stayed the same."
Sonsofanarchy,3c40we,xrambino23,0,Sat Jul 4 18:50:26 2015 UTC,That's not really a sequel though that's just what the next season would be. A sequel would be 5-10 years in the future say and could be something like the sons are slowly going back to illegal money with new faces and new problems not the same characters on an the same mission.

Sonsofanarchy,3c40we,Pyrrolidone,3,Sun Jul 5 04:50:04 2015 UTC,why can't we have both ?
Sonsofanarchy,3c40we,Bman1233,3,Sat Jul 4 23:21:02 2015 UTC,Sequel. I want to see Jax's 2 boys grown come back to Charming. Maybe Able as a prospect and Thomas as a rookie cop. I think the dynamic between the 2 would be amazing. Chibs still has the gavel. I would watch the shit out of that.
Sonsofanarchy,3c40we,BillNyeStillHigh,3,Sun Jul 5 00:52:51 2015 UTC,"If they did a sequel, I'd rather the protagonist be a prospect, and it focus more on the club itself, as opposed to M Night Shamalamadingdong twists and Michael Bay explosions."
Sonsofanarchy,3c40we,GrimThursday,2,Sun Jul 5 11:29:02 2015 UTC,"Easy, prequel"
Sonsofanarchy,3c40we,tapsomebong89,2,Sat Jul 4 16:35:42 2015 UTC,"Prequel! Even though we end up knowing what happens to the first 9 and Gemma, seeing their journey would be amazing. I am one of the few people that LOVED the Ireland season, so seeing the back story to all of that is what I want to see."
Sonsofanarchy,3c40we,RyanLaFalce,2,Sat Jul 4 17:19:05 2015 UTC,"A prequel would be awesome since we already know some stuff that happened, just not how they went down.  As for a sequel, that's up to Kurt Sutter."
Sonsofanarchy,3c40we,Reedy212,1 point,Sun Jul 5 02:23:25 2015 UTC,I think a sequel could really ruin the series. Either it comes back without the Tellers and then I'm not sure if I'd care about grandpa Chibs.  or it comes back with the kids in the club and Jax's sacrifice was worthless.
Sonsofanarchy,3c40we,diddlyumpcious4,1 point,Sun Jul 5 04:13:38 2015 UTC,"If there's a prequel it is almost a guarantee that Opie won't be in it, or at least not the same actor. Prequel is likely set around the first 9 time if it happens. Opie would be a kid at best during that time. If a prequel happens, I doubt any of the same cast would be in it."
Sonsofanarchy,3c40we,JRB522,0,Sat Jul 4 19:28:13 2015 UTC,I think I'd find both interesting and would watch both. I know it'd never happen but I think I'd like a sequel a bit more just cause it upsets me that we'll never see the characters again and plus it'd be nice to see what happened after the finale and where the club/everyone is at.
Sonsofanarchy,3c1me3,ChupacabraIsMyFriend,1 point,Fri Jul 3 22:45:45 2015 UTC,Katey Sagal (Gemma) is also in lost as Locke's girlfriend.  This has probably been posted before but I've only recently started watching SOA.

Looking forward to the prequel though, that would definitely be something i'd be more likely to watch. But if there was an eighth I'd like to see like 15 years into the future and see Abel fuck shit up haha"
Sonsofanarchy,3c1aln,boatzhoez,2,Fri Jul 3 21:13:30 2015 UTC,"I was looking forward to the memoirs after I finished the series. I finished the series and got on to purchase the book, then found out he will release after the 'first 9' series. I really want both but was looking forward to the book."
Sonsofanarchy,3c1aln,extensionofme,3,Fri Jul 3 21:19:47 2015 UTC,I personally wish sutter had found a way to wrap everything up in 6. There was no need for the 7th season. You could have skipped all but the last 3 episode and not missed anything important to the story line.
Sonsofanarchy,3c1aln,jnolan3321,2,Fri Jul 3 21:21:10 2015 UTC,"No. And it's not going to happen. I don't want to see Abel or Thomas go back to Charming and join SAMCRO. That means Tara and Jax's deaths would be for nothing. They died trying to break the cycle of violence, so if the kids go back - well, Gemma wins and we are all f-ked."
Sonsofanarchy,3c1aln,CreepyAbelTeller,2,Sat Jul 4 01:09:50 2015 UTC,"If there were an 8th season, which is 100% guaranteed not to happen as the 7th was the last for the series, I couldn't see a lot really happening beyond the obvious healing of the club in the wake of Jax's death, and maybe some issues surrounding the Triads and the Irish. Given that Jax would no longer be around, however, these would likely be very minor setbacks for the club. Same song and dance too circulating any police attention. Neither Marks nor his gang would be an issue, and neither would the Mayans either, so creating another random enemy out of all that would be very contrived. Far as the SOA organization's concerned too, their only problem was with Jax post-Jury. So in no way whatsoever would I anticipate any drama from that front, either. Least as far as a present day storyline is concerned, SoA was right to end where it did.  However, all of the above aside, I am excited to see The First 9 prequel whenever that surfaces. I would also be interested in a sequel, but it's gotta take place a good, significant amount of time into the future. And personally, I would say that's at least a solid decade or more, once Abel's in his mid-late teen years. They foreshadowed his involvement in the club pretty heavily I believe, so in my mind, keeping with SoA's overall theme, they can at least base a movie around his arc."
Sonsofanarchy,3c1aln,TheRegulatorOnline,1 point,Mon Jul 6 10:00:34 2015 UTC,"Kurt Sutter always had a plan for 7 seasons. Anything more than that and I think people would have stopped watching I think. There was a story to tell that could last no more than seven seasons. I think the ending was really good and wrapped up really well. I think the first nine will be brilliant, I'll love watching the history of the club and I'll already know the characters. I'm excited to see JT's story!"

Sonsofanarchy,3bwxtk,CaptainKurls,3,Thu Jul 2 20:50:40 2015 UTC,"I always said this, Juice was only loyal to whoever had the gun to his head. He completely gave up the club in season four. He was undeniable rat based on the loose threat of being outed as a halfcast, and he pursued his rattiness even after Chibs told him it only mattered that he wasn't black on paper!  Then he was loyal to clay, he almost betrayed Jax by telling clay that Jax had set him up but the police knocked before he had a chance to finish. He then almost destroyed the one almost healthy fartherly relationship Jax had have had. He told Nero of Jax's secret.  Then, if all that wasn't enough. He betrayed Jax even further by helping cover up Tara's murder and killing Eli, her protector!! Then in season seven... Spoiler Juice was a liability, and where I loved him to begin with I very quickly lost respect for him. I loved the scene with Jax in season seven though!"

Someone that could have so easily been manipulated by fear and almost led to suicide isn't stable, that's for sure. When he tells Gemma, Wendy, and (maybe) Unser about being alone and getting lost in his own head and thoughts, I was really moved because having anxiety/panic disorder myself, it was the only time I'd ever heard how I feel articulated on screen. You could feel that he loved his family (the club), but that he simply didn't have it in him to be a part of it.   I always placed a bit of the blame on Jax and Chibs, because they could've cut him loose or reassigned him early on and possibly changed his path. They saw that he wasn't right, wasn't handling club life well, and they didn't do anything. They talked about it, but ultimately, just kept him doing the same things that broke him in the first place. I wanted to turn on him after all his actions towards the end of the show, but my heart broke for him too much."

Sonsofanarchy,3bv4uf,vengence2kill,17,Thu Jul 2 12:09:34 2015 UTC,"I also had high hopes of seeing Jax and Tara drive into the sunset with the boys, but after the end of season six I was aware that there was no happy ending for Jax, not without Tara! He promised her a beautiful life, and he couldn't give her that, I knew that because Jax broke that promise to Tara, I knew in my own mind that he couldn't live without her, and the show was ultimately based on Hamlet, which is a tragedy. I didn't want Jax to die, but I understand why he did have to die, it wasn't just about the club, it was about his boys. He lived and breathed SAMCRO since he was old enough to know what it was. He didn't want his boys following the same cycle as he had, he didn't want them to be tied to the gavel. He took himself out of the picture so that his boys wouldn't aspire to be like him, which is why he told Nero to make sure they grow up hating him. He also did it because he couldn't live with the fact he killed his own mother. He loved Gemma, but he had to kill her, and he couldn't live with himself after doing that. Plus the two people he loved most, who guided him in life, Opie and Tara were dead so all he had left to live for was his kids, and he didn't want them to be like him. The best thing he could do for his sons was set them free from the life of violence and murder he had been condemned to. Ultimately, you can say his decision was selfish, but he had become a bad guy, a murderer, and he couldn't escape that.  He became the antihero by sacrificing himself so that the club and his boys could have a fresh start, taking all the bad decisions with him to the grave. Leaving the boys with Wendy was his honouring Tara's wishes, I was so happy he did that, he resisted Wendy's help for so long and I'm glad he finally recognised that Tara wanted the best for the boys, and Wendy was the best chance they had at a normal, loving life. Tara raised her son when she wasn't able, and Wendy did the same for Thomas. I loved the way that worked. I loved Nero's part in the ending, he was a wonderful male role model to leave with the boys It was heartbreaking, I hated that it had to end like that, I genuinley mourned Jax. And I thought it was the only ending it could really have. I thought it was a beautiful end to the show."
Sonsofanarchy,3bv4uf,AllAboutTheFairytale,7,Thu Jul 2 13:14:27 2015 UTC,"Part of me wanted the happy ending too, but after rewatching the series (a few times; I'm an addict), Sutter's foreshadowing is more obvious. Jax is a bad guy and the bad guy died, I couldn't help but feel like that's what Sutter wanted to make sure we knew. All that time we spent romanticizing the club, Gemma, Jax, Tara, etc., was thrown back in our face so we'd either be angry or realize that they were all evil people. Either by doing evil or letting evil be done (I don't feel like Tara was an innocent at all). Nobody won.  That's just what I took away from it. What do you think?"
Sonsofanarchy,3bv4uf,flatulady,3,Thu Jul 2 12:43:53 2015 UTC,"Very similar reaction. During my initial viewing of the series, I remember thinking what a badass Jax was end of season 4-season 7. Right now I'm at the end of season 6 on my first rematch of the series and the stuff Jax did in season 5 and 6 is pretty terrible. I really saw what a monster he'd became when he banged the speedball in Wendy. As someone whose struggled with drugs and finally kicked the habit, I can't imagine what Wendy felt being sober for a good while and then having drugs forced into her. It made her fall back into the downward spiral until Gemma knocked some sense into her.   But yeah nobody in that show is really all that good (Nero and Chucky being the closest but even they were involved in some sketchy shit at some point in their lives) I definitely romanticized it all but yeah everyone who needed to die for what they'd done died."
Sonsofanarchy,3bv4uf,CaptainKurls,3,Thu Jul 2 18:59:16 2015 UTC,I personally didn't like it. The 2nd half of the series became the Katey Sagal show.

I thought there might be an escape ending for a minute at the end until he shot Gemma. That's when I knew he was going for broke.   I think the way it ended was great, and it's better for me with time. It gives a promise of the future- Abel seeing his dad not as the bad criminal but as the lovable outlaw we all saw, a new direction for the club- making it the right club for Abel when he's grown if Jax's push towards legitimacy works out. It's a good ending."
Sonsofanarchy,3bv4uf,aryeh56,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:30:17 2015 UTC,"It definitely said something, far beyond the what a TV show normally has to say. The end of SOA actually conveyed a message about the natures of identity, family, and humanity. I'm still gestating it and trying to understand just what that message is. All I know right now is that it left me with the same bitter taste as the end of My Name is Asher Lev. I'm not ashamed to admit that I cried at the end of both stories. I suppose once I can articulate what this story said to me I'll write a post about it and let you all know."
Sonsofanarchy,3bv4uf,Viziondfc,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:13:49 2015 UTC,Based on the very dark direction Jax was headed in s5 going forward I had a feeling he wasn't going to make it out alive.  As soon as they rebuilt Jon's knuckle head I had a strong idea it was going to end the way it did.  I was happy with it because it left no doubt that he had go away for his kids sake.

I thought the writing was brilliant, I was on edge a lot of season seven, that doesn't happen with poor writing. Season seven had some of the best acting in the entire series. Charlie hunnam, Jimmy Smits and Theo Rossi all gave performances that are being discussed by lots of people as emmy worthy performances. There is no denying the prison scene and the scene between Nero and Gemma were spectacularly acted out. I also happen to think it was wonderfully directed."
Sonsofanarchy,3bv4uf,openhighapart,0,Thu Jul 2 21:07:30 2015 UTC,"Fanboys may be in denial, but it's true."
Sonsofanarchy,3bv4uf,angerdome,0,Thu Jul 2 21:02:42 2015 UTC,"I thought it's was great. Tara needed to die. She was just as poisonous as Gemma was. But when we saw Jax try his hardest to cut all ties and free the boys and Wendy, it was almost poetic to see the grip SAMCRO has on the Tellers the the foreshadowing we saw in Abel. It's a circle. JT did it with Jax and his Thomas, and Jax tried it with Abel and Thomas.   Ultimately, the Tellers have a supernatural relationship with the Reaper. Jax personified that in the latter seasons, and literally wore the cloak in the final act. We saw him greet death as a familiar friend, and we saw him accept his fate.   I loved it."
Sonsofanarchy,3bv4uf,AllAboutTheFairytale,6,Thu Jul 2 15:39:32 2015 UTC,"I don't think Tara was as poisonous as Gemma at all, I think Gemma was all about keeping herself happy, and never really considered what was best for Jax at any stage in his upbringing.  Tara, on the other hand loved Jax, but she loved her kids more, and when she recognised that her husband couldn't be saved, she focused her every breath on getting her boys out of the life that took Jax from her. Tara may not have been innocent, but her intentions were good. Had she made it out of that house she would have raised the boys away from the club in a loving, respectable life. Tara wanted anything but for Wendy to have Abel, because he was her son, but she wanted Wendy to be his guardian should anything happen to her. That was something she did for the boys, not for herself. I think she was selfless, and a very loving mother. She went to dramatic extremes that I didn't agree with to protect them babies, but she it for the right reasons. Gemma was poison and selfish. She cared about nobody but herself, and even though she loved Jackson from the purest part of her heart, she never had his best interests at heart. If she loved him, she would have let him go rather than guilting him every time he tried to give his family a better life, and putting barriers up to make him stay."

Sonsofanarchy,3bu11v,ohmyluckystars,8,Thu Jul 2 05:12:26 2015 UTC,"I loved Halfsack as well and he was one of my favorites. Unfortunately the actor himself had some problems and I think they decided to part ways. He later was on drugs, killed an old lady, and then himself. From Sutter later, "" it was a tragic end for an extremely talented guy, who unfortunately had lost his way. i wish i could say that i was shocked by the events last night, but i was not."""
Sonsofanarchy,3bu11v,TizzleDirt,2,Thu Jul 2 05:49:30 2015 UTC,I hate that this always has to get mentioned whenever anyone talks about Halfsack. It's very tragic what happened in real life so I try to focus on his awesome character and his heroic death in the show. He was easily the best prospect and should have earned his patch before departing.

Sonsofanarchy,3bu11v,OpieKid,1 point,Thu Jul 2 12:07:16 2015 UTC,"I just finished season two and I can here to see if the show picks up or its just not my cup of tea.  I started watching this show because of the shield, I find the shield very good. But so far SOA has been a disappointment. I don't really understand the motives of the characters, their club with no money and little power manages to keep such high loyalties?   The killing of the wife of Opie is just a mess. He finds out who killed her and he is totally cool with it, well besides a little tantrum, club is important and shit. The rest of them have no opinion of course, cause the club is important and shit.   The rest is just shit piling up that makes no sense or is badly shot, like their pretend standoff outside of the cigar store. Why are policeman patting them down when they come near each other? guns work from range.  Are all those guns registered, they are just brandishing them out in front of all the cops.  Bleh it feels like the town people are just props, they only people that exist is the bikers their immediate families, the 2 cops and the bad guys.   A friend suggested me to watch the entire thing, Should I keep going? I ended up laughing at the ending of season 2 with its ridiculous ploy, the ATF female cop shooting that guy at the end, I just dont understand the motives at all for not reporting it as self defense, her buddies even knew the other guy was there to kill her.   Agr.. sorry for the rant, Its probably just not the type of show for me."
Sonsofanarchy,3bu11v,sectoid_in_a_bottle,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:30:35 2015 UTC,"Well,  the problem with Agent Stahl shooting Cameron's son is that it was not in self defense. He punched her in the gooch,  yes, but he immediately made a run for the door. In the US, as much as we love our guns, most people consider shooting someone who is running away to be bad juju. Cam's son was making a run for it, and Stahl would have been in BIG shit for shooting him. She could have punched him, tackled him, tazed him, pepper sprayed him, or even take a swing at him with a billy club. But to use lethal force on a fleeing target is very illegal, so she framed Gemma, since the opportunity presented itself."
Sonsofanarchy,3bu11v,Kimchidiary,1 point,Sat Jul 4 15:04:25 2015 UTC,"sorry but nope, the rest of her team was aware he had the intention of killing her, they got blanks for that purpose. The guy could have grabbed a knife or even just seem confrontational not obeying orders.  If she was willing to frame someone else, she could have EASILY put a knife in his hand, there was absolutely no witnesses."
Sonsofanarchy,3bu11v,twelveteen,1 point,Sat Jul 4 20:48:37 2015 UTC,"Think of when Stahl shoots him. The exact moment. He punched Stahl, got up off the couch, started running for the door, makes it to a garage/workshop space before Stahl shoots him through the threshold of the door. At that point, its not really fair to assume hes going for a weapon, since A) the house had already been cleared, B) he just realized how thorough they were, and C) he's going to be even deeper shit now. LEOs are specifically trained not to shoot at a fleeing suspect, even if the suspect previously made an attempt at your life. This doubly so, when you know before hand that their weapon is loaded with blanks.  Think about it- he now has this crazy legal weight over his head. He's an Irish guy living on foreign grounds, so its not like he has plans to stay. Its pretty obvious his only intention was dipping. Notice how  simply punched her in the gooch once before running; he didnt attack again, he didnt go for a more dangerous attack like hitting the throat area- he just put one clean hit in her then dipped.   Yes, he pulled the gun, but they had searched the whole house. Clearly they were thorough enough to catch the handgun in the vent, so we can reasonably assume the most dangerous thing available in the house was a chef's knife or a large hammer. If he DID go for that knife,  and then attempt to attack her, Stahl could shoot him. But we cant go around killing people for what they MIGHT do.  I grew up around multiple LEOs. I can promise you, that was not a clean shot on Stahl's part, which is why she covered it up. She already had enough to bring Gemma down, but it wasnt about that. It was about covering up a bad shot."

Sonsofanarchy,3bjgcb,dlrfsu,1 point,Tue Jun 30 06:19:40 2015 UTC,Yeah dude first 3 seasons are my personal favorites.
Sonsofanarchy,3bjgcb,ComplexOrganisms,1 point,Tue Jun 30 04:25:22 2015 UTC,Second time around is better because u pick up so much on stuff that you didn't see first time because ur not focused on the main story as much.

Sonsofanarchy,3blzeu,PositiveID,2,Tue Jun 30 08:59:00 2015 UTC,She has dimples in her nose. i swear sometimes it looks like it's pierced but it's not.
Sonsofanarchy,3blzeu,stacyo72,2,Tue Jun 30 11:36:07 2015 UTC,"Gemma hit her in the face and the timeline of Season 2 is like a few weeks so it's not going to magically heal overnight.   O/T but Maggie Siff has a perfect nose. Like, I've never had that much nose envy before. It's the perfect size and so friggin' straight. I always notice noses - and it was the first thing I thought about Tara lol. The first thing I thought about Jax, too. They both have great noses. I remember thinking Wendy's nose could have used a nice trim."

May have just been a sad look. The idea is that the MC comes before everything else, including family, and dealing with the Sons was deemed to be in the best interest of the club, so it had to be done, and Alvarez knew that."
Sonsofanarchy,3bhb9a,mjr1234,18,Mon Jun 29 05:37:18 2015 UTC,"When Gemma says ""everybody"" in her case, she just means the club. She doesn't want them getting pissed off and recklessly going after people she realizes are incredibly smart. She's making a sacrifice to try and help the club."
Sonsofanarchy,3bhb9a,diddlyumpcious4,0,Mon Jun 29 06:07:12 2015 UTC,"That reads into it differently than I did. I thought that she, as a 'strong, powerful woman', would not want anyone to see her as weak. I couldn't see her as thinking they were a super sophisticated threat. What they did could be done by any group of thugs who dislike the club."
Sonsofanarchy,3bhb9a,JesusClausIsReal,6,Mon Jun 29 06:11:15 2015 UTC,"It's more a matter of Gemma being smart. She realizes 100% why they raped her, it was solely to get a violent and immediate reaction from her club. She simply wasn't playing their game."
Sonsofanarchy,3bhb9a,TheLastNomad,4,Mon Jun 29 14:40:42 2015 UTC,"I don't think it was that simple.  She may not have said it, but being raped definitely broke her. She was not the same, and I doubt she wanted anyone to know. SPOILER"

Sonsofanarchy,3bhb9a,TeamStark31,3,Mon Jun 29 08:52:54 2015 UTC,"She was definitely trying to protect the club from doing something stupid... When something like that happens to the ""matriarch"" of a club like that the guys don't care about laws or rules they just go and kill... She didn't want them all in prison."
Sonsofanarchy,3bhb9a,AllAboutTheFairytale,1 point,Mon Jun 29 15:37:10 2015 UTC,Heh.
Sonsofanarchy,3bhb9a,bwsmg718,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:20:13 2015 UTC,"Gemma was very maternal in the most warped way possible and I genuinely do think that she was helping the little girl in season one because of her motherly instincts!  Gemma thinks of herself as a fierce protector, and admitting she was vulnerable was difficult for her in any situation. I think her talking Jax and clay was really emotional, it was her grasping control back. While she was wayward, Jax and clay became more broken and I think it became clear that the only way of fixing that was to come clean and give them a common enemy to bond over.  I hated her for doing that, because Jax going nomad could have had a massive impact on the next seasons but it was also one of the few times I loved her! Hope you are enjoying the ride!"
Sonsofanarchy,3bd23l,Empire_Lifts_Back,9,Sun Jun 28 01:52:28 2015 UTC,Tara's awesome - that's why you like her.
Sonsofanarchy,3bd23l,CreepyAbelTeller,2,Sun Jun 28 06:04:32 2015 UTC,"Heh, could be. I love your username BTW."
Sonsofanarchy,3bd23l,CreepyAbelTeller,2,Sun Jun 28 06:51:05 2015 UTC,"Some people write her off because she doesn't kiss Jax's ass or that she whines just enough to actually point out that he makes dumbass decisions 99.9% of the time (mind you, she makes a lot of stupid decisions as well). I like that she's not entirely a good person but has enough of a conscience to pull herself back from truly becoming Gemma. It's what separates decent from evil."
Sonsofanarchy,3bd23l,Zanyo18,9,Wed Jul 1 02:28:07 2015 UTC,Haha I thought the exact same thing about Sam Crow for like the entire first season until I googled...

Sonsofanarchy,3bd23l,autowikibot,4,Sun Jun 28 02:33:29 2015 UTC,Yeah it sucks that the prospect died. The only reason they killed him off was because the actor who played him had mental issues in real life. A few years ago he murdered his landlord and her cat and then jumped out of a third story window and died
Sonsofanarchy,3bd23l,leefx,2,Sun Jun 28 05:50:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I've read about that, some really sad shit. One more thing that makes this show great is that even though he wanted to leave they gave him a proper, meaningful death. Some shows can't do that when there's a problem with the actor and they just write him off like he never even mattered. Boardwalk Empire is a great example of that."

Sonsofanarchy,3bd23l,AllAboutTheFairytale,4,Thu Jul 2 08:47:35 2015 UTC,"You do find out what happened with Darby later on. As for the baby, pretty much the whole third season follows that story line. Alot of people didn't like it, but I thought it was an interesting change.   The intro does slightly change, but the tattoo aspect stays for the whole series. When I first started I had trouble with the lingo, but I caught on eventually. Unfourtantly, I'm afraid if I answer anymore of your questions I might give something away."
Sonsofanarchy,3bbink,LG34-,30,Sat Jun 27 17:13:52 2015 UTC,"I think the issues were that JT knew that Gemma and Clay were going to kill him. Also, that he wanted to take the club in a different direction than guns, and Clay thought that if that truth got out then the club would make a similar decision. But mainly I think it was because the letters would tell the club that Clay killed JT. And that would have earned a mayhem vote for Clay."
Sonsofanarchy,3bbink,FashionablyFake,1 point,Sat Jun 27 17:21:01 2015 UTC,I don't think the letters are proof enough to cause a mayhem vote.
Sonsofanarchy,3bbink,CobraJet97,4,Sun Jun 28 00:29:30 2015 UTC,"Yes, they were - hence why Clay went to the extent of killing Piney and then Tara. It wasn't just that Jax would kill him, it was that the entire club would stick his head on the reaper pole."
Sonsofanarchy,3bbink,CreepyAbelTeller,12,Sun Jun 28 05:59:12 2015 UTC,"To add to that first comment, I think there was mention that JT accurately described how they would kill him in the letters. I think it was Gemma that said it, but not certain."
Sonsofanarchy,3bbink,DrOrinScrivelloDDS,5,Sat Jun 27 17:48:42 2015 UTC,Didn't it all end up that Clay did not kill JT and he killed himself?
Sonsofanarchy,3bbink,Jokeasmoint,9,Sat Jun 27 21:15:45 2015 UTC,"I think the way it is reconciled is that JT understood that Clay and Gemma were plotting to kill him and he didn't really care about life anymore and when he was out on the road, realized his bike had been sabotaged and just ran into the semi."
Sonsofanarchy,3bbink,SwedishHeat,3,Sat Jun 27 21:40:48 2015 UTC,"Clay more than likely tampered with JT's bike. As Jury says in S7, John was such a good mechanic he would've known instantly if something was wrong. So, the thought is, he knew the bike was damaged and rode anyway, wanting to end it because his whole world had pretty much caved in on him."
Sonsofanarchy,3bbink,TeamStark31,4,Sun Jun 28 04:29:33 2015 UTC,I think if I remember rightly Gemma tells Unser about the predicting it would be his bike that is tinkered with... Which Clay orchestrates.
Sonsofanarchy,3bbink,-dracarys,4,Sat Jun 27 18:37:22 2015 UTC,"Everyone's talking specifically about the letters, I want to say something about Clay killing Piney.  Whether or not the letter's alone were enough to warrant a mayhem vote for Clay, Piney was stepping out line because he didn't agree with something the club had voted on. He was sowing mistrust throughout the club and directing all of it to Clay. Even Opie could see how bad he was. In Clay's eyes, with those letters, Piney would have been unstoppable. I think Clay would have killed Piney either way."

The episode prior, Jax leaves her to deal with club business right after they get done with a hot-heavy makeout session and then she touches herself. It was more or less Sutter showing that they were beginning to drift and her sort of walking around the house aimlessly and then into the baby's room and waking up Thomas was her way of feeling like she was wanted/needed because she felt pretty abandoned by Jax."

I don't trust their TV opinions anymore haha. This show is pretty fun to watch and the level of brutality and gore has a messed up way of getting you hooked, but I think the stories are stretched for too long and the characters aren't that great.   This is definitely not popular, but this show could've still been great if Charlie Hunnam was a better actor. He has a few moments where he's really good, but overall I think he doesn't have much charisma. Ron Perlman is a way better actor and much more interesting to watch.  Anyway, if you watched Sopranos, True Detective, Breaking Bad, Boardwalk Empire (to a lesser extent), Deadwood, 6 Feet Under ... this show is definitely a notch below it. Up to you if you feel it's worth your time."

Sonsofanarchy,3b3df1,TeamStark31,2,Thu Jun 25 20:41:52 2015 UTC,"I didn't watch the video, but the idea of comparing those two characters is pretty interesting. Both start out in their series as bumblers in the criminal element, both with a kind of ""how are they still alive"" aspect. Both could have easily ended up in the other's shoes (Jesse in jail, Juice making it out alive)."

It would have ruined him... Abel was really one of the mains Sons of Anarchy. It was once said on here, Abel and Thomas are the sons, Jax is the anarchy. The show needed Abel in."
Sonsofanarchy,3b1vwa,AllAboutTheFairytale,4,Thu Jun 25 10:49:21 2015 UTC,In hindsight I think the priest was right taking the child and giving him to a catholic family. I think the priest knew this is what would happen and tried to prevent it for johns sake. Since they were friends and all.
Sonsofanarchy,3b1vwa,Wh1teMorgan,3,Fri Jun 26 07:03:19 2015 UTC,"Hell, he did it for Abel's sake too. Abel was,  sadly, a fucked up boy from an even more fucked up family by the time he hit kindergarten. Cutting himself with the fork, blaming said cutting on Gemma, smashing another kid with the metal lunchbox?  That poor little boy didnt stand a chance as long as he was that close to the club and all the horrible-ness that surrounded it. He would have turned out much better with those nice parents who were uninvolved with crime. Im so glad Wendy took the boys away to live a better life."

Sonsofanarchy,3b1vwa,TheExtremeChef2,3,Sat Jun 27 08:01:15 2015 UTC,"If Abel had stayed in Ireland, it's possible that Maureen would have never put the letters in Tara's bag (it was really triggered by the conversation that she overhears between Gemma and Jax about Jax letting Abel go and Gemma telling him whats up). If Tara hadn't gotten the letters, there would have not been a hit out on her which means Oregon would have happened and they would probably all be alive and well away from crazy grandma."
Sonsofanarchy,3azb27,Nerm5484,8,Wed Jun 24 18:29:37 2015 UTC,"In my head, I don't think Nero would tell the kids that he was horrible, he will tell them that their dad was very sad because of the life he had, because his job made him do bad things, then when they are grown, he would tell them how Gemma killed Tara, Spoiler I think Nero would do a good job of keeping the boys out of harms way, and he is such a nice guy that I doubt he would be able to hate Jax, I don't think Wendy would have hated him neither after finding out what happened!"

Sonsofanarchy,3azb27,bwsmg718,3,Thu Jun 25 17:33:14 2015 UTC,"The main thing was that they didn't follow his lifestyle, and being that because of the ending, you would think that his sons would be banned from joining the club, because their father received the mayhem vote, he did his job and whether or not they believe their father was a bad person really becomes irrelevant."
Sonsofanarchy,3azb27,PunisherXXV,1 point,Wed Jun 24 22:28:59 2015 UTC,"I think they were setting it up for Abel to basically go through the same things Jax did, growing up wondering about his father's past, etc.  Also remember Gemma gave Abel the ""SON"" ring and he twisting it around his finger in the car."
Sonsofanarchy,3azb27,CreepyAbelTeller,1 point,Wed Jun 24 18:35:29 2015 UTC,"I don't think Nero was going to tell them verbatim ""your dad was a terrible person."" He's a smart man who had already lived a life similar to Jax's and found his way out of said life, so he would know how to handle with tact. He knew deep down that Jax was a good man, and he also understood the sacrifice Jax was making at the end. That's why I'm glad it wasn't just Wendy who ended up with the boys (sidenote: I'm bias in this because I couldn't stand Wendy and her stupid pout to begin with but I do realize at the end, there were very limited options as to who could babysit the little ones. And that's what she was - a glorified babysitter. Another reason I couldn't stand her/her storyline). Nero is the father figure Jax never had and would probably be a much better father to Thomas/Abel than Jax could have ever been. It's a shame Tara was killed though because she provided them an actual path outside of criminality and drugs - considering she had lived a very successful life outside of Charming and made something of herself."

Sonsofanarchy,3arv91,TomBonner1,2,Tue Jun 23 12:11:54 2015 UTC,Think it's made by the same prop company who made this which i've seen in so many shows.  They have loads of made up brands that look like the real thing. Think it's to stop paying for advertisement.

Sonsofanarchy,3arv91,OpieKid,1 point,Wed Jun 24 04:49:07 2015 UTC,Usually it is the opposite: companies pay the shows to use their products as advertising (product placement). Shows will avoid showing the logos otherwise. Another reason is if the product is used in a negative way (e.g. smashing the bottle over someones head) which the company might not be happy about. That is why many reality shows blur out logos.

Sonsofanarchy,3atmqd,TheExtremeChef2,4,Tue Jun 23 19:58:04 2015 UTC,They are gun-running criminals - moral superiority is not thy name.
Sonsofanarchy,3atmqd,CreepyAbelTeller,2,Tue Jun 23 21:34:33 2015 UTC,"Contra the earlier comments, I don't think ""moral superiority"" means over the world, but merely the other groups in their story.  And I agree with the OP.  In the first three seasons they were generally decent people, albeit criminals who dealt with other criminal elements harshly.  But after that they just became scumbags who would kill anyone who stood in their way.  I rooted for them in the beginning, but in the end I didn't really care."
Sonsofanarchy,3atmqd,JoeShmoe99,2,Wed Jun 24 15:28:38 2015 UTC,"I get what you mean, it's in season 4, When Clay gets greedy and is just in it for the money, so him and Gemma can live a stable life after his hands give out and he'll no longer be president. After the truth emerges, it's just Jax trying to get out of guns and cleaning up everything Clay put in place. I believe in season 5, someone says to Jax how messy everything is now he's in charge and he states ""I inherited it"". It's in the last season where they have their moments of everyone together/it's for the club."
Sonsofanarchy,3atmqd,PoisoningPerception,4,Fri Jun 26 05:38:44 2015 UTC,"They maybe a gang that killed people but that doesn't change the fact that they are written as the heroes of the series. That being said as the ""heroes"" of the story, they do at times hold morals. This is especially noticeable when it came to the killing of the pedophile in season one or going after Jax's son in season three.  Edit: words and stuff."
Sonsofanarchy,3atmqd,PoisoningPerception,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:36:18 2015 UTC,"The pedophile thing is where Jax really started questioning Clay, you can tell when Clay does the deed- Jax's expression is 'oh shit'.

Sonsofanarchy,3atmqd,Wh1teMorgan,2,Fri Jun 26 05:44:34 2015 UTC,What really upset jax was when clay told him he wasn't simply killing the pedophile for revenge  Clay was doing it to hlackmail oswald. Jax loves the club so much and having clay not tell them straight up what he was doing is what had jax questioning clay.

Not 'First 9' but elder of the MODs, always the first in the Clubhouse to say ""I Got This"" to the very end.  /u/Perma: Opie - Quiet (shows his Canadian roots) but demands respect and when he speaks, you better goddamn well fight, fuck, or flee - rarely showers.  /u/junkmale: Happy -  Always willing to ""bring the freedom."" Doesn't like a mess when you make pancakes and always is willing to break out his ""ball-peen.""  /u/mauicormac: Lenny The Pimp - You don't always see or hear him, but he's always there.  /u/xLite414: Otto - Minus the anal wreckage, always there for the Club, right to the very end...  a."

Most clubs aren't like that. Most just get together and ride. Do charity work. And it's more of a weekend get together with like minded friends. I've though about joining one like the latter. However none in my area match my ideals so far. Most have something in common.  Like we have one called the infidels around here. They are a group that is ""against the jihadist movement and will fight against it"". Which to me is whatever, but it's a little too extreme. They also only allow American iron. Which to me is ignorant. Because Honda motorcycles employees more Americans to build bikes than Harley and Triumph put together"

I did not like it at all. And yet, when I would see pics of her outside of the show with short hair, I couldn't believe how much I LOVED it on her. It's the way they styled it - it legit looks like it was cut in the dark. But her face is still stunning - I was always envious of her features."

Sonsofanarchy,3a3h1c,michaelmyers1994,4,Tue Jun 16 23:37:34 2015 UTC,So sorry and my sincerest condolences to his family and friends.
Sonsofanarchy,3a3h1c,Slevo,4,Tue Jun 16 23:40:52 2015 UTC,I'll see you later brother.

Sonsofanarchy,3a3h1c,miked00d,3,Wed Jun 17 07:47:33 2015 UTC,So sorry for this loss. May he Rest in Peace. Condolences for his family.
Sonsofanarchy,3a3h1c,jukedwayup,3,Wed Jun 17 02:04:45 2015 UTC,"The mods of this sub are amazing. iirc, you guys scoured the sub for spoilers when the finale leaked to stop us from seeing them. I know it's not exactly disarming bombs, but the simple fact that you guys must care about the show so much yet you did that for us when you didn't have to... I'm just saying you're all awesome people and it's so sad to lose one of you. Rest in peace brother."
Sonsofanarchy,3a3h1c,erotic_thunderpants,3,Wed Jun 17 04:56:11 2015 UTC,RIP. Condolences to family and friends.

Unfortunately I didn't have the pleasure of interacting with him, but I'll gladly celebrate his life and give my respect and thanks.  A shot of whiskey and a beer in your honor, Chris. Ride in peace."

Admittedly I'm not as active in this subreddit as I used to be but it's astonishing how much all r/sonsofanarchy moderators care about their community and about each other. Your efforts are what makes this pile of code a community.
Sonsofanarchy,3a3h1c,beaniebabiesliedtous,2,Wed Jun 17 18:12:43 2015 UTC,Thank you. We try our best.

Sonsofanarchy,39wnn2,eye_patch_willy,8,Mon Jun 15 12:14:32 2015 UTC,Good question. The club rule is clearly not at the forefront of what the club cats about. I always thought this was a very weak story arc that lead to a lot of tragedy. You see it when he comes clean to Bobby and Bobby says they need to update the by laws. Nobody gave a shit.
Sonsofanarchy,39wnn2,unoffensivename,5,Mon Jun 15 12:56:28 2015 UTC,"yeah for the amount of tragedy and the events that were set in motion because of it, the fundamental issue was very weak and the cause didnt justify the effect."
Sonsofanarchy,39wnn2,eye_patch_willy,4,Mon Jun 15 19:57:11 2015 UTC,"Agree, overall the writing was fantastic but this was a weak spot in a prominent place. I remember forgetting in the last two seasons why Juice was in trouble with the club in the first place, it seemed like such a non-issue."
Sonsofanarchy,39wnn2,michaelmyers1994,5,Mon Jun 15 20:24:47 2015 UTC,"Because the rule in most MC'S is ""No black people"". This was the case in SAMCRO. Hispanics however are permitted in the club. And chibs' old lady is an old lady, not a member. So the black rule doesn't apply."
Sonsofanarchy,39wnn2,batz777,3,Mon Jun 15 12:19:38 2015 UTC,In real life MC's Chibs old lady being black would be a problem though.
Sonsofanarchy,39wnn2,medievaleagle,1 point,Mon Jun 15 12:37:50 2015 UTC,"Chibs lost Fiona to Jimmy before he was in the MC. Jimmy outed him from the IRA, took Fiona and Kerrianne from him, then he joined SAMBEL before having to transfer to SAMCRO."
Sonsofanarchy,39wnn2,AllAboutTheFairytale,2,Mon Jun 15 22:42:54 2015 UTC,"They mention it later on as an unspoken rule, but a rule one the less. He was afraid that if they found out his dad was black they would kick him out and it (the club) was all he had."
Sonsofanarchy,39wnn2,Kimchidiary,2,Mon Jun 15 12:55:49 2015 UTC,"I just think juice is a victim, it's juice who makes a big deal out of it, not the club. Chibs points out that it's a rule, and it can't be broken, because if you break one, it makes them all seem redundant. Chibs also points out that they go by what juice is down as on his birth certificate. Juice could have just told the club, they likely would have went by his birth certificate, but he was a coward and risked the whole club for his own inclusion in the MC. I think it was more based around supporting that juice is a rat, and someone who repeatedly betrays the club for later in the show. Ultimately, he does give the club up to save his own neck, which is a catalysts for all the betrayals he is yet to make at that point."
Sonsofanarchy,39wnn2,ChipperJT,1 point,Mon Jun 15 20:55:02 2015 UTC,"Juice is made to feel that way.  The cop spooks him intentionally and he always knew the rule.  All the groups seem to have very racial divides.  I hated Juices story lines.  He's a good guy, shows genuine empathy and does sincerely care about the club."
Sonsofanarchy,39w8s2,michaelmyers1994,40,Mon Jun 15 08:41:34 2015 UTC,"He did have to die, it wasn't just about the club, it was about his boys. He lived and breathed SAMCRO since he was old enough to know what it was. He didn't want his boys following the same cycle as he had, he didn't want them to be tied to the gavel. He took himself out of the picture so that his boys wouldn't aspire to be like him, which is why he told Nero to make sure they grow up hating him. He also did it because he couldn't live with the fact he killed his own mother. He loved Gemma, but he had to kill her, and he couldn't live with himself after doing that. Plus the two people he loved most, who guided him in life, Opie and Tara were dead so all he had left to live for was his kids, and he didn't want them to be like him. Ultimately, you can say his decision was selfish, but he had become a bad guy, a murderer, and he couldn't escape that.  He became the antihero by sacrificing himself so that the club and his boys could have a fresh start, taking all the bad decisions with him to the grave. I thought it was a beautiful end to the show."
Sonsofanarchy,39w8s2,AllAboutTheFairytale,6,Mon Jun 15 09:45:16 2015 UTC,"Pretty much what he said. I disagree with the ending myself, and I hated it for a while, but ultimately I understand why it had to be done.  The Mayhem vote may not have passed in the end, but it would have started a war between charters. In the end, Jax knew what had to be done to save his club and his family."
Sonsofanarchy,39w8s2,stevensusername,2,Mon Jun 15 11:16:08 2015 UTC,I never looked into that explanation in such detail. It makes sense when you say it like that.
Sonsofanarchy,39w8s2,UnicornWiz4rd,5,Mon Jun 15 12:16:56 2015 UTC,"In the words of chibs - ""The rules have been around since day 1. It was a different time. I'm not saying I agree with them all. But if I start picking and choosing which ones to follow then the whole thing just falls apart.""  Having him saying that over the footage of the crash would have made it alot clearer imo"
Sonsofanarchy,39w8s2,nc_cyclist,6,Mon Jun 15 12:35:05 2015 UTC,"He had to in the end. The lies from his mother not only destroyed her family, but it sent Jax down a road he could never recover from. (including fellow member) Nero even told him killing his mother would be a wound he'd never recover from. Jax did what needed to be done. It's a shame he let his anger drive him to become something he hated. I blame all of this on Gemma though."
Sonsofanarchy,39w8s2,AllAboutTheFairytale,12,Mon Jun 15 13:19:24 2015 UTC,"Everything was Gemmas fault. Jax would have been long gone from Charming without Gemma in his life, Tara would still be around, Piney would be, which means Opie probably would have fought harder to live, JT would even still be around. She was a hurricaine, She destroyed everything in her path. Most of the problems Jax had in his life were caused by Gemma. She was a fierce mother, but ultimatley she was selfish, she never wanted what was best for Jax, she just wanted to be loved by him, and she wanted to keep and control him. One of my favourite scenes is when Jax tells Gemma he is Burying his best friend, and her need to be loved, worshiped and adored is low on his list of things to do today. i felt like high fiving my TV when he said that."
Sonsofanarchy,39w8s2,CreepyAbelTeller,4,Mon Jun 15 16:12:22 2015 UTC,"Jax didn't just die because of the mayhem vote. He died because a) he truly believed that by removing the toxin (himself), he could honor Tara's wishes and break the cycle, and their boys would never know that life (""I'm doing what I should have done when my wife was still alive"") b) he could never come back from killing his own mother but it was something he HAD to do - see point A and c) he was depressed as hell following Tara's death and was living and breathing on rage and nothing else... once he found out the truth and avenged Tara's death, he had nothing else to live for -- he was never a good father (""I'm not a good man. I'm a criminal and a killer"") and without Tara, he could never truly live his life with any ounce of happiness -- as Bobby told Tara in Season 6, ""He (Jax) ain't got a chance without you (Tara)."" He finally understood Opie's grief over Donna's death.  Living his life out with Wendy, Nero, and the farm was never going to happen. The only reason Wendy got the kids in the end was b/c Nero and Jax set it up for her and because there was literally no other option. He was leaving his children so he needed them to be taken care of."
Sonsofanarchy,39w8s2,novhakin,3,Thu Jun 18 02:16:38 2015 UTC,"For once he just wanted to play it clean. Plus they found out Jury never lied. So it wasn't just self defense. Jax came clean for the benefit of SAMCRO. Even if he lied, they would've eventually found out. And a Mayhem vote is unonimous"
Sonsofanarchy,39w8s2,Gwilt1,3,Mon Jun 15 09:00:37 2015 UTC,"Nah, he had to go, it was best for all parties involved. He had to erase his influence from everyone he cared about, because ultimately they all ended up paying a price for his lifestyle and choices. By taking himself out, he set a clean slate for everyone."
Sonsofanarchy,39w8s2,redfoxst38,1 point,Wed Jun 17 02:22:51 2015 UTC,I've learned to like the ending but it was the path of least resistance.  It takes more of a man to straighten up and act right for your boys.  I get that he wanted to save his boys but he could have went legit no matter the cost to himself.  I still love the series but I will always feel like he was too scared to do what should have been done.

Sonsofanarchy,39tygh,Fats33,10,Sun Jun 14 19:17:26 2015 UTC,"Re: Tara's arc - it's important to remember that she's from Charming. She was a part of that world - to a certain extent - when she was a teenager. As Sutter put it, at her core she has always been an angry, badass teenager. Her leaving Charming and making something of herself allowed her to carefully construct a new identity. Once she returned to Charming, those layers began to peel - and we saw more of who she was at her core. So, I don't think the hardened aspect is all that random or strange. She just began to embrace who she really was - but had the conscience to know when to pull back.   As for Opie, he tried with all his heart to move on from Donna but it was impossible. In the end, he really just wanted his children to be taken care of because he had completely checked out as a father. I think he was just glad that Lyla had some basic maternal skills and could play mommy for the time being."

Sonsofanarchy,39tygh,AllAboutTheFairytale,5,Sun Jun 14 22:47:41 2015 UTC,I 100% agree the Jax/Tara relationship was one of the better stories on the show and it definitely wouldn't have been the sane without it.

Sonsofanarchy,39tygh,CreepyAbelTeller,2,Thu Jun 18 01:25:37 2015 UTC,"No character stays the same throughout this show. Tara rises to the role of an old lady, coached by Gemma, it's survival tactics I guess, she has to be tough to stay in that life, and to keep the man she loves. Opie is just trying to fill the void that Donna left, his character is brilliant. I think he just wanted a woman, and a mother for his kids. Don't judge them characters for changing just yet!  They are two of my favourite characters and their story arcs are both pretty tremendous."

Sonsofanarchy,39tygh,chronicwisdom,-1,Fri Jun 19 18:47:47 2015 UTC,The big unexplained change in the series is Bobby. In season one he's clearly part of the 'old school' part of the club with Clay and Tigg. Jax sees them as an obstacle to reaching positive change. His role is completely reversed at some point with no explanation.
Sonsofanarchy,39tygh,asstasticbum,1 point,Mon Jun 15 02:48:04 2015 UTC,Unexplained?????? Did you watch the series?????
Sonsofanarchy,39tygh,chronicwisdom,2,Mon Jun 15 03:12:33 2015 UTC,Yeah I've seen the majority of it a few times. Why don't you enlighten me as to what you think I missed. Lots of stuff happens to Bobby but I don't recall anything that moves him from Team Clay to Team Jax.
Sonsofanarchy,39tygh,unoffensivename,2,Mon Jun 15 03:16:20 2015 UTC,"I always thought Bobby was the neutral character advisor. He never hesitated to tell Clay when he disagreed, and he did the same to Jax. Thats why both ""Teams"" respected him. He could pull off being neutral and opinionated unlike everyone else. I dont think he went from Team Clay to Team Jax like you interpreted."

Well, the car gets pulled over, so Kozik goes ""I got this,"" drives up to the police, and starts shooting at them so they'll follow him and leave the car for SAMCRO to grab.

So why the F did it take Unser so long to ""piece together the truth"" that Gemma killed Tara? If, as Gemma claims later that she saw the Chinese running from Tara's house, why did she not tell Unser immediately that Tara was murdered and that's why she was crying? Or why was she not the person to call it in to the police? UGGGGHHHHH. It's just so frustrating because the entire first half of S7 was so drawn out, when it seemed like it was alot more obvious than they acted."

I enjoyed how she was punished in Season 5 but for the most part, it was like she was invincible and it made her all the more detestable. Sagal brought layers and a certain nuance but it still annoyed the shit out of me.  I also hated hated hated Jarry in Season 7. That character needed to be recast and rewritten. I also hated Wendy - or rather, how illogically she was written and I thought Drea had 2, maybe 3 expressions the entire series. She also had zero chemistry with Charlie Hunnam, so any scene they shared together made me cringe.  Last but not least - I never quite understood how and why Jax and Tara avoided having honest conversations in Season 5. Like - they purposefully avoided the truth... for what? It made no sense."
Sonsofanarchy,39fyxn,perb123,3,Sat Jun 13 17:11:52 2015 UTC,Great points all around. I truly couldn't stand Gemma either. The fact that she could just do or say anything and people just trusted her was so irritating. And she wasn't even a good liar!  PS: fantastic username
Sonsofanarchy,39fyxn,ChupacabraIsMyFriend,4,Sun Jun 14 07:42:55 2015 UTC,"From the very start I was annoyed by the weapons they carry. Most of them are ex felons and would probably not get a permit (right? Not from the U.S but that's what I figure). How is it then that they never get charged with possession of an illegal weapon?  Or if they really are legal weapons, how can they kill people right and left with them without having to dump it and explain it to the law? ""Sorry officer, I know it's the third gun I lost this week, I'll try to hold on better to this next one I get a permit for.""  There might be a case with illegal weapons (when they storm that meeting= but that was because it fitted the plot, otherwise it's ignored."

Did Lyla just like doing what she did, despite what her husband thought of it? Isn't that a little insensitive in a serious relationship?  And why was Opie so concerned with having another kid with Lyla? They already had three cumulatively, all of them around the same age. Did he just hate looking at his kids so much that he felt that having another with a pornstar would make his world that much more bearable?   I mean, what the hell? Then they have the falling out over the birth control. Felt forced as fuck. Like, they didn't even have an adult discussion about it, Opie just sat on the rooftop all pissed off.  It was doomed from the start, and I saw it coming from the moment Opie lied to her about killing the Russians. Their interactions seem to contradict what Opie really wants; Opie never really understood why he pursued Lyla as a partner, but he tried to force it and ended up getting burned instead. He wanted to be happy, but he was so used to how he did things with Donna that trying to make those pieces fit an entirely different person fucked the whole thing up.  tl;dr Opie was stupid for going after Lyla"

He was the main antagonist of Season 7. He was the reason Bobby was tortured and he killed Bobby. And how is he dealt with? Less than 2 minutes in the final episode. Basically his involvement with the final episode was him walking down some steps, saying something like ""Jax, you don't have to do this"", and getting shot. That's it. Little to no payoff. Just, you're dead now. Pissed me off. Same thing with the rat (can't remember his name, he owned or worked at that bakery shop). He gave up information about the Sons, and the same thing as what happened with Marks, less than 2 minutes of screen time. Just shot in the head and that's it."

He dramatically sets his gun on the table and declares, “I’m ready…” Tig and Happy put hands on his shoulders, walk him dramatically over to the middle of the room, and then stand out to Jax’ sides with their hands on his shoulders. Chibs takes aim – leading the viewer to think, “Holy shit, they’re just going to shoot Jax here, now, like this?!” Then he shoots Happy in the arm. I get it. I get from a story-telling perspective, this was wonderfully dramatic. I even get from within the storyline why happy was shot (although he didn’t need to be). What I’ve never understood – within the story – is why have Tig and Happy put hands on Jax shoulders and do it this way? Why not just have Happy put his arm out and shoot it?"
Sonsofanarchy,39fyxn,ChipperJT,3,Thu Jun 11 14:22:09 2015 UTC,"Yea I'd heard a lot of complaints about that one.  Just like you said, it doesn't make sense within the show, but for Sutter wanting to tell the story and keep the viewer guessing he had to show it that way."

This is very subtle- Jax picks up a picture in the girls fathers house after she smashes the ice cream shop, and he says the woman looks familiar and it's the homeless woman.

Idk if that makes sense. Haha"
Sonsofanarchy,39iifg,batz777,2,Fri Jun 12 02:24:05 2015 UTC,"Sutter has said the woman is supposed to be Jesus, which makes sense because in season 2 Gemma sees her when she drops Unser off at church (after she'd seen her outside a store and given her money some episodes before) and asks, ""Do I know you?""

Sonsofanarchy,39ca5h,brob,2,Thu Jun 11 14:14:27 2015 UTC,Wendy mentioned she still loved Jax in S7 too. I'd imagine she was willing to do anything to gain his love back and have the boys.

Sonsofanarchy,39ca5h,CreepyAbelTeller,2,Thu Jun 25 14:24:37 2015 UTC,"Well, the two scenes you mentioned aren't really all that alike - apart from sex and a dead body.  The time he had sex with Tara was both an emotional release and them coming together after 10+ years of being apart. They couldn't quite be around each other for too long because they clearly loved each other - so they avoided each other as much as they could in those early episodes. I think after killing Kohn, Tara was both relieved and terrified and Jax was shaken up and very aware that he still had a lot of feelings for Tara. They rekindled their childhood romance right then and there.  As for Jax and Wendy - it was more of a ""I will bang anything that is warm right now"" scenario. Jax straight up told Wendy he wasn't ok and Wendy had said in Season 6 that her and Jax were always good in the bedroom but nowhere else. So, she basically felt like it was her job to comfort him in the only way she knew how."

His friction with Tig always had your curiosity piqued but it wasn't one where you thought they were going to really go after each other. Really like brothers, especially after Tig got out and made the comment about getting transferred in on a technicality since he was away and couldn't vote no. But he did it while hugging him.   Really any of the club members that were more peripheral seemed to not get into such heavy, crazy, violent stuff.   Would have been cool to flesh out some of their stories or even just day to day club stuff as say a nomad."

I enjoyed the series and suggest it to all who'll listen but to this day I haaate what they did with his character.  Bobby was another I'd like to have seen more development from.  He was the smartest and most level headed of them all but he had a sloppy personality which I really identify with :)
Sonsofanarchy,397mo4,dvfsz,8,Tue Jun 9 23:20:36 2015 UTC,"I absolutely loved Juicy in the beginning.  He always kept the spirits up I felt.  After what happened with Miles he was never the same.  The thing I always found interesting is that every member of the club he told about his father (Chibbs, Clay), didn't even think of it as a concern.  I couldn't stand seeing him just deteriorate."
Sonsofanarchy,397mo4,CptnAlex,2,Wed Jun 10 03:29:19 2015 UTC,"I feel like at first it was about his dad. That is why he took the coke. But when he talked to Chibbs, I feel he didn't see it as a big concern anymore. It was when he fucking murdered Miles that he got all fucked up. I still really loved Juicy though."
Sonsofanarchy,397mo4,-Replicated,5,Wed Jun 10 03:59:17 2015 UTC,"I love Juice. Despite being a coward, I would say he was a very loyal compatriot. All of his lies and mistakes were due to his love and need to be part of the Sons family.  I hated seeing him deteriorate as well, and I wish they had done more to redeem him. I'm just glad he got to finish his pie."
Sonsofanarchy,397mo4,AllAboutTheFairytale,3,Wed Jun 10 16:19:14 2015 UTC,"I completely agree, I also felt they treated juice like shit I guess there was some good reasons to like him stealing the coke but apart from that it was a shame the story went that way."

He should have a comedy spin off! Such a loveable character. I would have liked to have seen more Otto aswell, but kurt Sutter only really cast himself as a link to the prison system!  I think it would have been nice to see everyone's lives away from the club, like it cut to Jax and Tara occasionally, I think it would have been nice to see Ope and lyla at home and being themselves a bit more, I would have liked to have seen more opie in general too!"

Sonsofanarchy,397mo4,Julevict,2,Thu Jun 11 13:11:06 2015 UTC,I would agree with Unser being underrated if it weren't for how stupid and oblivious he acted from Season 4 onwards. The man lost all my respect in Season 6. His love for Gemma was sick and obsessive. I didn't find it tragic or whatever Sutter and his writers were going for. He went out of his way to get Tara to trust him in Season 6 and then what does he do? He goes and blabs to Jax about Lowen and sets the entire thing up. SPOILER

There were other bigger characters who would have been good to see more of but something about Chuky stood out"
Sonsofanarchy,397mo4,p_coletraine,2,Wed Jun 10 20:57:21 2015 UTC,I came here to vote for Chucky! He was smart and extremely loyal. He had real love for the club. I'm glad Gemma had that moment with him where she assured him he wasn't a joke.

Sonsofanarchy,397mo4,DrWhoisOverRated,1 point,Sat Jun 13 17:21:23 2015 UTC,"I would liked to have seen more of Otto.  I wasn't a big fan with how they dragged things out with him near the end, but his character was very interesting to me.  To me they could have had the same overall story with him ending up in jail for life for doing club favors, but let him out for a few episodes in one of the earlier seasons.  He could have gotten out for a few episodes, and then maybe saved another member like Jax from a serious jail sentence by taking the blame for something Jax did or something.  Otto could do this because after being on the outside he thought Jax was going to do great things for the club, and thought him taking the heat for Jax was the right thing to do for the club.  This would result in his overall story being the same, but with us getting to see what Otto was like as a member of the club outside of jail."
Sonsofanarchy,397mo4,CreepyAbelTeller,0,Thu Jun 18 00:17:50 2015 UTC,Didn't see if anyone else mentioned it. But they had no choice but to kill Half Sack.   He had a lot of disagreements with Kurt. So they both agreed to find a away to separate half sack from the show.  His actor is also now dead. He killed his 80 year old land lord and died himself in the situation. It's all out there to read lol
Sonsofanarchy,397mo4,icantmakethisup,-4,Thu Jun 18 01:30:58 2015 UTC,"Winsome.  Although it wouldn't have really fallen in line with the story, seeing a romance blossom (more) between her and Jax would've been nice. The Diosa scene(s) felt so organic and natural.  It was a shame that character had to be introduced at the tail end of the show.  Edit: Appears some of you disagree..."
Sonsofanarchy,397mo4,CreepyAbelTeller,6,Wed Jun 10 00:54:16 2015 UTC,"I didn't really understand the point of even introducing her character.  I mean, her and Jax share this scene where it maybe foreshadows a future between the two of them, then we never see or hear from her again and Jax kills himself."
Sonsofanarchy,397mo4,hullkogan,4,Wed Jun 10 16:51:53 2015 UTC,"It served two purposes: 1) Hunnam's required butt shot for every season and 2) Showing him grieving in a human way. Being so intimate with someone that isn't Tara but looked a lot like Tara clearly broke him and he couldn't keep up the angry/rage facade in that moment. Remember, when he's inside someone there's only one face he sees."

Sonsofanarchy,396tvc,billy8383,2,Wed Jun 17 23:49:32 2015 UTC,Completely agree. Some people get too caught up in what's realistic or not instead of just enjoying the amazing show that it was.

Sonsofanarchy,396tvc,VaneFreja,6,Thu Jun 11 16:04:51 2015 UTC,"The show obviously isn't incredibly realistic (cause, well, it's a show), but you have to take into consideration that the world of SOA is much different than the world we live in.  It's almost quasi-authoritative; half controlled by the government and law enforcement, half controlled by organized crime.  The IRA itself is a unified insurgency; there really aren't a lot of people around who have the immediate jurisdiction to ""investigate"" them.  Not to mention, SAMCRO has had the law enforcement of Charming in their back pocket since before the series even started.  Take the show for what it is; don't try to compare it to real-life because it is not."
Sonsofanarchy,396tvc,Croat32,3,Tue Jun 9 21:12:51 2015 UTC,My favorite finale of the series and possibly my favorite episode.  DEFINATELY one of the most satisfying episodes...and it was typical Stahl fashion to try to reveal JAX as a rat.  That bitch got what she deserved from the very beginning...and the best part of it all was the clubs evil laughing while in the back of the patty-wagon on the way to jail.
Sonsofanarchy,396tvc,Ey3z0nF1rE,2,Wed Jun 10 22:08:44 2015 UTC,"The club wasn't under suspicion for her or Jimmy's death given the way they staged it, to make it look the IRA."

Sonsofanarchy,395fct,JackCuff,1 point,Tue Jun 9 16:05:35 2015 UTC,"That was tough!  So many ways to define favorite. Obviously, for the show to be successful, the main characters had to be interesting and watchable. The actors nailed it. A great show needs a supporting cast that is interesting enough to be a main characters. The actors nailed it.   Personally liked? Gemma's death was longed for many episodes before it happened. Hated her. But in the way we were supposed to and the show would have been a poorer show without her. (That Sagal didn't get an Emmy nomination shows the selection process is as bad as FIFA's.)  I ended up going with more supporting cast in smaller arcs because I always loved when they came on screen and wished they had more screen time.  I give a Nero a vote, though. Smits is just incredible in anything he does (even the most ardent post-Sorkin West Wing critic admits to Smits making his arc watchable.) The ability to bring in the Nero character into such an established show, and have it not be a mere substitution, but a substantial addition and influx of energy, is comparable to the Potter/Blake transition in MASH. Again, Sutter not getting a writing nomination seems more personal than anything else."

Bobby, he was the most relatable guy in the crew. He reminds me of a few people that mean a great deal to me. I wish I had more people like Bobby in my world.  Chibbs, the man I would want to have my back any time shit got serious. He was as chilled out as anyone could be until it was time for shit to get real.  Tig. The dude would be worth keeping around for the entertainment value alone. He may have needed some serious medication, but, he is so much fun without it. I could see getting into some seriously fun trouble with someone like him.  Nero had heart. He wasn't afraid to get his hands dirty. He was fiercely loyal. If I had a brother, I would hope that he embodied Nero.  Stahl. That bitch was awesome. I hated to see her die just because I wanted to see more of her character."

Sonsofanarchy,3974de,AllAboutTheFairytale,3,Wed Jun 10 01:20:03 2015 UTC,I hear this complaint a lot about his accent. I never noticed it differ at all during my watch-throughs of the show.
Sonsofanarchy,3974de,stacyo72,5,Wed Jun 10 01:17:56 2015 UTC,Occasionally with words that end with hard R's. Doctor and mother especially.
Sonsofanarchy,3974de,JackCuff,2,Wed Jun 10 01:19:09 2015 UTC,I'll listen out for it!
Sonsofanarchy,3974de,gizmatic,3,Wed Jun 10 01:20:20 2015 UTC,"Me neither. Now that its been pointed out then I sometimes realize that his accent is from the UK rather than from the West Coast because honestly, I think that the West Coast has some of the most comedic accents I've heard.

Sonsofanarchy,3974de,gizmatic,4,Wed Jun 10 01:22:15 2015 UTC,I was thinking the same thing. Where's Otto and his table when you need him?

Sonsofanarchy,3974de,stacyo72,4,Wed Jun 10 01:24:50 2015 UTC,I think so. Until JT went soft in her opinion. Then Clay was a means to an end. She loved them both as long as they were useful to her.

Sonsofanarchy,3974de,JackCuff,2,Wed Jun 10 01:45:13 2015 UTC,It started on Clay.
Sonsofanarchy,3974de,JackCuff,1 point,Wed Jun 10 01:46:56 2015 UTC,Maybe because it would give Clay the deciding vote since we know what Jax would say.  Edit: Nevermind it ended on Chibs.

Sonsofanarchy,3974de,JackCuff,2,Wed Jun 10 01:08:35 2015 UTC,Maybe since I'm in the U.K and I'm use to the Irish accent.
Sonsofanarchy,3974de,JackCuff,3,Wed Jun 10 01:10:18 2015 UTC,That must give you a big headstart on understanding the Glaswegian accent also huh? Cause both Chibs and Tommy Flanagan are Scottish.

Sonsofanarchy,3917c2,batz777,5,Mon Jun 8 14:35:13 2015 UTC,"Donna was shot from behind because Tig wouldn't do it if he looked at opie in the face. Stahl was murdered that way for retaliation hence the ""this is what she felt"". Tara was just Gemma being overly aggressive.   To counter the argument Salazar's girl was stabbed in the throat face to face. In season 1 when the Mayans go after Darby they shot some of the girls face to face as they stormed his house. The nurse that Otto killed was hit from behind then stabbed in the throat but I think that was more of a tactical thing than anything else. And finally in Diosa the massacre was definitely face to face.   Good point made but I don't necessarily think it's a theme.   Stupid Gemma...."
Sonsofanarchy,3917c2,justmighthaveto,1 point,Mon Jun 8 15:41:36 2015 UTC,"I really didn't think there was a big theme, because there's hardly any common ground that connects all four murders. I just found it odd that it seems to be a semi-popular method for killing strong female characters on the show. And I knew that more minor female characters went out in face-to-face ways, so I was just gonna get some feedback before writing it off as a coincidence. Ah the stuff I think about when I should be working...  Kinda funny that both Stahl and Gemma are shot in the back of the head for killing a member's wife though (indirectly in Stahl's case, but still her fault)."
Sonsofanarchy,3915hl,gv45,7,Mon Jun 8 14:20:10 2015 UTC,"No nobody else knew but Jax and Tara- and in the spirit of using a quote from the scene of which I found my name!  ""Hey- I killed a fed for you- nothing says endless love like capital murder"" But jax would never have told anyone- he promised Tara it would never lead back to her, and he kept the promise. He kept that secret from the club for Tara. I don't think the club would have approved at the time of Jax murdering a fed for a girl who at the time was viewed as a fling rather than her being his old lady."
Sonsofanarchy,3915hl,AllAboutTheFairytale,2,Mon Jun 8 18:22:13 2015 UTC,"I kind of love how they both took that secret to the grave. His first non self-defense kill was for Tara and that changed him indefinitely. But it was also something that turned Tara on - although she wouldn't ever admit it. Like you said, he brings it up in his proposal to her at Diosa and you can tell she's kind of turned on by it."
Sonsofanarchy,3915hl,CreepyAbelTeller,3,Mon Jun 22 23:57:10 2015 UTC,I don't think he would have told anyone but he hinted it to Stahl.

Sonsofanarchy,3915hl,batz777,2,Mon Jun 8 15:21:49 2015 UTC,"Was it ever mentioned how he escaped from his escorts back to Chicago? I assume he ambushed them in some crazy stalker asshole kinda way, but they never say how (that I can recall)."
Sonsofanarchy,3915hl,batz777,2,Mon Jun 8 18:20:14 2015 UTC,"This is true as well. They mentioned he ""dissapeared"". If he would have ambushed the officers driving the car then they would have said so. Really weird"
Sonsofanarchy,3915hl,gizmatic,1 point,Mon Jun 8 21:06:53 2015 UTC,"The way Stahl relays it to Jax was so weird to me. If she knew he never got off the plane, wouldn't she know that he never got on either? If he was in as serious trouble as they acted like he was in, they would've escorted him the entire way back I'd think. Damn plot holes."

There's an old saying - that which doesn't kill you makes you stronger, I don't believe that. I think the things that try to kill you make you angry and sad.

Wendy is taking the kids the hell out of there and is not going to glamorize him."

After the last conversation Jax and Ope had, I think Jax would have got out, and Ope would have got back with Lyla. Even if Tara still hadn't survived, Ope kept Jax level headed- Jax would have had a reason to survive with Ope- he would have fixed the club and ran it with Ope as VP Ope was Jax's true north, with Ope it would have been an entirely different show with a very different end!  Tara would have probably survived to, because with Ope around I think he would have been less reluctant to let her go."

Sonsofanarchy,38ld2l,AllAboutTheFairytale,2,Fri Jun 5 02:35:17 2015 UTC,"With Ope in the picture Jax would never have taken the path he did. It would have followed a whole different storyline. Jax wouldn't have be one so brutal that Tara wanted to leave, because Ope would have kept him grounded, so Gemma would never have been pushed to do what she did. Opie would have made the ending very different!"
Sonsofanarchy,38ld2l,CreepyAbelTeller,1 point,Fri Jun 5 11:21:51 2015 UTC,"Jax wasn't brutal that Tara wanted to leave though. Had they had one, honest conversation in Season 5 BEFORE the Otto incident, he would have been pretty open to it. At least in terms of Tara leaving with the boys. She only brought it up at the very end of Season 5 - after she had accepted the job offer and kind of just dropped a truthbomb on him. His issue was never about Tara leaving with their children. The issue in S6 was Tara doing it in a deceitful manner but in her defense, she had limited options since she was legally bound to Charming by that point. Jax had never been opposed to doing what Tara wanted - he never ran the show with her. He knew she wanted what was best for their children and he trusted her with those choices.   That being said, I don't think much would have changed had Opie lived. Opie and Jax were SO estranged by Season 5. They barely talked and Opie had pretty much given up on that friendship. Opie's death didn't have the same effect on Jax as Tara's death. Losing a best friend is very different from losing the woman you are in love with. I don't think Jax would have been so hellbent on the club had Opie lived but I also don't see him walking away so quickly. I think had Tara not gotten involved with Otto, that would have really been the gamechanger. She could have easily left and maybe Jax would have followed. Then no Gemma and forks to the skull. We also wouldn't have to live through a disastrous final season."
Sonsofanarchy,38ld2l,sumneradam,5,Sun Jun 14 02:17:12 2015 UTC,The show creators wanted to kill Ope I think. If they didn't Jax would have gotten out with Ope and would have lived a normal life with Tara more than likely. They had to implement something to motivate Jax to stick to the club. He wanted to honor Ope by staying in his cut and not backing out.  It made the show more interesting.
Sonsofanarchy,38ld2l,sumneradam,2,Fri Jun 5 02:22:08 2015 UTC,"Who's to say Tara would have lived? At the time of his death iirc, Op was the only thing keeping jaxs in charming. I could be wrong."
Sonsofanarchy,38ld2l,Metrofball52,2,Fri Jun 5 02:34:35 2015 UTC,Tara dies bc Gemma thought she ratted Jax out. I think Jax and Tara would have left the club and took the kids else where due to Opie's advice to leave them behind. Ope would have wanted Jax to live and help his family and the only to have completely done that would have been to leave the club. The controversy of Tara's death would have happened if Jax had left the club
Sonsofanarchy,38ld2l,Breatheher,-6,Fri Jun 5 17:25:26 2015 UTC,Thanks for the (spoiler) warning. Ruined the ending for me. I don't think I'm going to watch the show anymore. Thanks

Sonsofanarchy,38mvji,Hamburbler,3,Fri Jun 5 06:18:05 2015 UTC,"I would have to rewatch the show as I've only seen it once, but I agree with you about Jax. I do recall my opinion of him dropping a good deal after Wendy returned and he handled the whole thing like a complete and utter a$$hole. As though Wendy was some wretched horrible being that wasn't fit to breathe in the same hemisphere as he and Tara. I mean, Wendy was an addict BEFORE he got her pregnant what was Jaxs excuse?"
Sonsofanarchy,38mvji,gizmatic,3,Fri Jun 5 12:09:13 2015 UTC,"I agree re: his assaulting Wendy as the point of no return but I would argue that the whole issue he had with Wendy wasn't just the junkie during pregnancy phase. It was the way she handled things AFTER she nearly killed their son. She went to visit Tara in the hospital when she was laying there with a mangled hand, her immediate career and dreams crushed. Jax told her to back off. She continued to handle things in a pretty annoying/stupid way (and it didn't help that she just allowed Gemma to walk all over her). I'm not saying that it gives Jax ANY right to violently assault her but it's not just one thing that she did that really ticked him off.   SPOILER"

I do agree that Tig was probably the main character my feelings changed towards. I hated him at first too, but  he completely changed and become a character I loved. The opposite for me was Juic, I loved him at first and lost more and more respect for him as the show went on.  Seasons 6 & 7 are where the most respect is gained and lost though, so ask again when you have finished the show! :) Enjoy the last two seasons!"

Although his way of treating Lyla was hard to watch and I lost some respect for him with that.   But overall.. out of all the characters..  Venus is my number one.

Sonsofanarchy,38mvji,CreepyAbelTeller,1 point,Sat Jun 6 21:25:18 2015 UTC,No I mean Tara. Tara was just as bad as gemma. The only difference is you knew what you were getting with Gemma while Tara tried playing innocent. I've watched this series all the way through 7 times and it's really not hard to miss if you watch with an open mind.
Sonsofanarchy,38mvji,franniiie,2,Sat Jun 6 22:04:10 2015 UTC,"Tara was just as bad as Gemma? Unless Tara was leading some sort of double life, that's wildly inaccurate. Gemma did everything in the name of Gemma. Tara - while not at all innocent - was far less selfish and more conscious-driven. She did a lot of stupid shit but NOTHING to the extent of Gemma. Did Tara sanction her husband's death and then pin it on her second husband? Did Tara try and kill her sons ex-wife by supplying her with a syringe full of drugs? Did Tara try and control her son and his significant other - to the extent, that she threatened to lie to the authorities so her daughter in law could get ""fist-raped"" in jail? Did Tara pretend that everything she did was ""for her family"" when it was COMPLETELY transparent that she was doing it FOR herself and to ensure she maintained control over EVERY aspect of her son and grandsons lives? Did Tara point a gun at a baby in Ireland? Those are just a few examples of Gemma's awfulness. Gemma was a vile, despicable woman who felt that her son and grandsons should continue HER legacy aka the club - a culture which has killed so many sons. Tara - while again, selfish and destructive in her own ways - was actually preoccupied with her sons safety enough to stop caring about her own safety and livelihood at a certain point."

Sonsofanarchy,38aocf,SanguineRose,3,Thu Jun 4 22:52:45 2015 UTC,"Jax is the protagonist. By definition he can't be the antagonist.   I take that back.the protagonist and antagonist can be the same person if the conflict is character v himself. But Jax's battle is not with himself, it's chiefly against ""the club"" as a character. The OP's question is nuanced, but it's directed in such a way that Jax can't be the answer. Gemma does serve as an antagonist, and she's a selfish and irresponsible bitch that deals in the background. She is the cause for all the pain and suffering in the show. Going back to his dad's death.  She deserved to die many times over."
Sonsofanarchy,38aocf,KingKidd,-2,Thu Jun 4 23:02:08 2015 UTC,"Oh no sir. I beg to differ.  Jax is at constant war with himself. Really that's a lot of what this show is about.

Sonsofanarchy,38aocf,SanguineRose,4,Thu Jun 4 23:22:27 2015 UTC,"If that makes killing someone justified, we are living by two very different moral codes.   Gemma lived by a very simple philosophy: protect Gemma. She didn't care about anyone or anything else. Her love for her son and grandsons was an incredibly toxic brand of love. It was self-serving and when someone defied her - including men she claimed she loved and married - she would make sure they met their end. She was a vile, miserable piece of work.

Sonsofanarchy,38937a,fuckingminotaur,3,Tue Jun 2 18:24:06 2015 UTC,I don't think you'll be able to find that exact same one but this is the closest I could find for you: https://eblanken.wordpress.com/2010/10/22/raising-a-hellhound/
Sonsofanarchy,38937a,Nyxia,2,Tue Jun 2 18:48:36 2015 UTC,"If I remember right, the font was created for the show.   Carnevalee Freakshow and the one /u/Nyxia listed are fair close.   I used to own a laser, and did a lot of SOA style stuff for people, so I looked pretty long and hard for the font."
Sonsofanarchy,38937a,medicwhat,1 point,Tue Jun 2 23:08:29 2015 UTC,Figured. Might as well make one myself then
Sonsofanarchy,38937a,mandrews909,1 point,Wed Jun 3 00:35:07 2015 UTC,"The font was created solely for the show, as told by Sutter on I believe season 1 DVD extras. I also remember that they did it because most MCs have their own font, and during the production of the first season they had to change the font a bit because an actual IRL MC came to SOA production team and told them their font was too much like theirs.  So chances are you won't find it anywhere."
Sonsofanarchy,388ahh,AllAboutTheFairytale,8,Tue Jun 2 15:45:22 2015 UTC,I really don't care that she's such a twunt; I would still drag my dick through a mile of broken glass just to hear Ima fart through a walkie talkie.
Sonsofanarchy,388ahh,stacyo72,3,Wed Jun 3 01:21:35 2015 UTC,This was a very masculine comment. She is still a bitch though!

I'm not a fan of the bleached/trashy look. She had a decent face though. Nothing special, IMO. And then Jax went and bashed it up. I would choose Tara, the Tara lookalike from S7 and Polly Zobelle over her any day."
Sonsofanarchy,388ahh,stacyo72,5,Thu Jun 4 16:50:55 2015 UTC,Let me get an advance on my trust fund. One of my favorite lines from  Jax.

Sonsofanarchy,388ahh,stacyo72,2,Wed Jun 3 01:30:03 2015 UTC,This judge and his son scene is so disturbing.  Talk about a dysfunctional family.

I'm so happy you posted this, otherwise I would have said something as I needed to talk about it :)  I loved the finale! It was what I needed. I was almost there crying with them. tbh, I didn't realize this was it. I never followed SOA before so I didn't know that it as the series finale. Glad I binged it before it was too long away."
Sonsofanarchy,387ic6,Chickenburgers,2,Tue Jun 2 23:49:22 2015 UTC,"Just little things. The first episode he visits the storage lot and that's when he finds JT's manuscript - in the finale he's back at the storage lot and burning everything. His hair, the 2 crows eating, ""never know this life of Chaos"" him talking to JT at the end Jax finally understanding what JT meant about his boys not knowing the life.  Jax and Gemma even have a discussion about JT'S death and his original idea for the MC. Jax hiding under a blanket.   I did cry. When they were all saying goodbye before Chibs shot Happy, so many tears I watched the special features after, and started crying again when Bobby (Mark Boone Jr) finished wrapping and they were all saying goodbye in real life."

Even though they were out on bail, I am pretty sure that they weren't allowed to leave the country, I think that they left their rockers in part because the trip wasn't official SAMCRO business--they were going to get Abel but it was a Teller issue that the club voted to support and help. Also probably out of deference to Elliot Oswalds preference/concern for his reputation. Its a small town with nosy people and he's well known and respected, he didn't want there to be a big obvious sign that he was in cahoots with the local MC, even though he was doing them a favor.  I understood it that way, but I could be dead wrong, I guess the simplest explanation is that if they got caught and arrested they didn't want it to be an official SAMCRO thing."
Sonsofanarchy,385c44,gizmatic,3,Tue Jun 2 03:47:49 2015 UTC,I think it was something to do with the fact they were on the run at the time? or some club policy that wasn't mentioned.

Sonsofanarchy,385c44,ChupacabraIsMyFriend,2,Tue Jun 2 14:16:39 2015 UTC,The rockers are the curved patches on their backs that are both above and below the reaper. The top rocker says Sons of Anarchy and the bottom rocker says California (or whatever state the charter is in).

A super basic explanation would be that the RICO Act can be used to charge all members (or at least the important members) of a criminal organization for crimes committed by that organization.   In Sons of Anarchy, a few different government organizations try to take down SAMCRO using the RICO Act. This is the ""RICO case"" they keep referring to."

The RICO Act focuses specifically on racketeering, and it allows the leaders of a syndicate to be tried for the crimes which they ordered others to do or assisted them, closing a perceived loophole that allowed a person who instructed someone else to, for example, murder, to be exempt from the trial because he did not actually commit the crime personally.

Sonsofanarchy,37wbu2,bhamm17,2,Sun May 31 17:34:45 2015 UTC,I think the 03 was a super glide sport though with the entirely blacked out engine and tranny and it always sat a little taller which the fxdx was. And the only thing about his street bobs year that makes me think its older than 2011 is Jax's rear fender still had a longer super glide type until 08 when they changed it to the shorter ones. I guess they could have for the show put the older fender on but I always wondered if they did then why? Ya know?

She was slick and cunning and you couldn't help but admire how much of a snake in the grass she was.  Also I loved the contrast between her and Lincoln Potter in season four. He was so by the book that it showed even more how willing she was to bend and break the rules to try and get what she wants.

Sonsofanarchy,37sy67,teabagZz,5,Sat May 30 20:14:22 2015 UTC,"How did you feel about Jax killing himself?  What was your take on the SFX? Personally people are to hard on the special effects, I was too invested in the show to notice they were bad. And even if they are bad I don't see how that takes away from the show.  Did you want Gemma to die?  Who's dear hit you the hardest?  Favourite and least favourite series?  Favourite and least favourite character?"
Sonsofanarchy,37sy67,JackCuff,8,Sat May 30 09:14:44 2015 UTC,"I assumed OP would answer... But in the absence of that, I thought I would respond! So you're not left hanging!    I felt incredibly sad about Jax killing himself, but it made sense to me. He had lost his way, lost his wife, killed his mother and wanted to save his sons from his fate, and with him around there would be no chance of that.  The SFX didn't bother me, in the last scene my eyes were to full of tears to notice, there could have been dinosaurs in the background and I wouldn't have noticed, I was only focused on Jax's face. I agree, FX don't affect the greatness of the story or the acting IMO. I thought I wanted Gemma to die, until she died. I think she would have suffered more living with the loss of Jax. But I understand that she had to die, because she would have found a way to get to Abel and Thomas. And Jax needed to avenge Tara. The betrayal was to heavy to be overlooked by Jax. It was difficult to watch her be murdered by Jax though. The death that hit me the hardest was Tara's. It was the death of Jax's escape and any chance of a happy ending for him. It was the death of his one true love and I really liked Tara. I realise that's an unpopular opinion but I think she loved Jax so much but she just had to love the boys more, and her dying just after she was getting the freedom for herself and her boys killed me a bit inside, and the pointlessness of her death was painful too. Gemma was horrible, she didn't shoot her, it was a very brutal murder. I was upset by the death of their love story too... It was such a good one. My favourite series was season four, because I loved seeing Jax try to get out of the club, and being dedicated to getting out, then I loved seeing him accepting his place at the end and standing up to clay.  My least favourite series was season two I think, because I didn't cope well with watching Jax be so horrible to Tara. I liked it when they were together, it upset me when Jax was trying to push her away! And I don't feel like they got revenge on Zobelle- he deserved to be tortured the bastard!  My favourite character was Jax. For so many reasons. He was so conflicted and although he did so many things that should have made me hate him, I couldn't hate him because I felt like he was a good person deep down! I think his storyline was beautiful, the times he was given hope and had it dragged away was tragic. My least favourite character was probably clay, he was ultimately selfish and hurt everyone he claimed to love. He didn't think before he did things, he beat up Gemma, killed piney, killed Donna and tried to kill Tara. Although Jax was destructive in season seven, he never hurt anyone in the club and he didn't hurt any women related to the club."
Sonsofanarchy,37sy67,AllAboutTheFairytale,3,Sat May 30 18:32:29 2015 UTC,Holy shit are you me?!?! I have these exact same opinions although I liked season 3 the most. How many rewwtches have you done?  And if you were president who would be your VP and who would be your SGT?
Sonsofanarchy,37sy67,JackCuff,5,Sat May 30 18:52:17 2015 UTC,"Season three had the best series ending I have ever seen in any tv show ever, the last two episodes of season three are my favourite of the whole show. They are so satisfying to watch!  If I was president, I'm assuming you mean after the end? My VP would be Chibs, because he is loyal and I'd trust him with my life! SGT would be Happy, because no one would fuck with Hap. He was such a good character. It wouldn't be Tig because he doesn't think before he does things and he lets his anger control him, and that anger has upset the club on more than one occasion. He always seems to kill the wrong person by accident too!  I am up to season 4 on my third Rewatch :) I might be you... If I am though, who am I?! Haha"
Sonsofanarchy,37sy67,AllAboutTheFairytale,2,Sat May 30 19:57:56 2015 UTC,"I'd pick Chibs and Hap aswell haha. If we're counting every member dead or alive [SPOILERS] I'd pick Bobby as my VP he was always very level headed and always made descisions that were best for the club even if the club didn't like them (I.E Clay's mayhem vote)   We need to meet and just watch sons of anarchy together start to finish without stopping.  The season 3 finale is the only finale of any show ever that made me sit back and just stare blankly at my TV just trying to soak in what just happened.  I've just never watched a show that blended violence, drama, brotherhood, family and comedy just so perfectly."
Sonsofanarchy,37sy67,JackCuff,2,Sat May 30 22:01:08 2015 UTC,"It's like we are the same person! Haha I would also pick bobby as my VP.  Yeah the season three final was incredible, it was so well written and all the loose ends got tied so perfectly. It's an amazing episode!  I agree jack- I like that plan! we could just watch them and agree with and understand each other! Haha when Tara died I felt so wronged and misunderstood! My friend who first told me to watch it hated Tara so he was happy when she died. He didn't understand!  When I tell people to watch it, and they ask what it's about it's hard to vaguely explain it in a way that justify a it's brilliance. People assume it's just about a bunch of guys on bikes, it's so much more than that. All the other shows seem dull in comparison to me now!"

I grew a bit meh towards tara over season 6 but I still did love her. She didn't desrve such a brutal death and jax's reaction kills me everytime, that scream right at the end of S2 kills me aswell.   I could literally talk with you about this show forever.  I just can't fault any single part of the show whatsoever, it's 100% perfection."

It took me about two episodes to get hooked and I watched the first four seasons in four days, I scheduled a few sick days from work to do this haha Yeah, Tara went a bit odd when she started being all needy and she wanted Jax and Gemma to tell her they loved her. She annoyed me with the fake miscarriage because I loved how honest she and Jax were with eachother- and Jax didn't deserve that, but I understand that she was desperate, and she needed Gemma to be out of the kids lives for good. It was more about Gemma than Jax. I didn't like her manipulative side. Yeah Jax crying always got to me. The end of season two where Abel gets taken had me in bits, that desperate scream cut me deep haha, then when he found Tara I was sobbing. His reaction and acting was perfect. And the scene between Jax and juice in prison in season seven is phenomenal. I know Jax's accent slips a bit but I genuinely think that's an amazing scene with incredible acting!  I don't think anyone has ever had the same opinions as me on this show! I'm really glad I answered your questions!"
Sonsofanarchy,37sy67,AllAboutTheFairytale,1 point,Sat May 30 22:41:07 2015 UTC,"Everything you say is the exact same things I have thought about for every second of this show. SAME! I've never talked to anyone who shares the exact same opinions as me on EVERYHTING. The show makes me want to ride a Harley so badly, and Jax's body.....Damn! I'm a straight male but god damn Jax is hot I'm striving to achieve his body type and I actually style my hair the same way as Jax does in Season 5. The show has become my life, I have a couple SoA merchandise, you got any?  When did you first watch the show? I saw it for the first time at the beginning of the year, currently on S3E9 of watch through 2.  Have you found another show to fill that SoA void? I haven't that's why I'm watching it again haha I need SoA in my life.  I love the music aswell, some of my favourites are John The Revelator, Come Join The Murder and Dad's gonna Kill me, you?  I'm sorry for the constant questions haha, I've not got any friends or family that I've convinced to watch the show yet and alot of people on this sub have very different perceptions of the show to what I do so I've never had the chance to basically talk to myself about the show. Great minds think alike though amirite?"
Sonsofanarchy,37sy67,JackCuff,2,Sat May 30 22:50:25 2015 UTC,"We do have the same views! Great minds do think alike, another thing we agree on! Haha The show made me want to ride a Harley but I can't even drive a car nevermind ride a motorbike! I can ride a pedal bike but that's not near as cool lol. I'm a straight female and I adore Jax's body. I adore hex. I think I'm mentally married to him, it's a bit sad really haha, I'm 26 years old with a fictional mental husband- I'm okay with it though!  You couldn't have a better style icon!  I'm from the UK and the merchandise is hard to find. I have the collectors edition book and the book that's set between season 3 and 4 bratva it's called. I have a t shirt but that's about it! The merch for guys is much better than the girl merch haha I started watching the show at the beginning of the year, watched it all in less than a month then just kept re watching.  I'm trying to watch the shield, that's another Kurt Sutter show, but I can't drag myself away from sons!  Yeah, I have most of the songs on my iphone, they are amazing, my favourites are come join the murder, day is gone and forever young- oh and someday never comes, but every song is brilliant. Such a good soundtrack!  That's okay. My friend refuses to talk to me about it because I never shut up about it. This is a brilliant sub though and they are all lovely on it. They do rewatches on Tuesday nights, no one turned up last week though so I don't know if it will continue but they are brilliant, all press play at the same time then discuss it!  I could chat about the show forever, it's my life at the moment haha, I can't see that changing anytime soon!"

Sonsofanarchy,37dbly,youmeanddougie,2,Wed May 27 00:52:23 2015 UTC,They changed showrunners in between seasons 1 and 2 and it went downhill from there and never recovered.    Season 1 focused on the science (which is very real).  It also had legitimate storylines for each character.    Season 2 (and beyond) turned Lightman into a super hero and basically made every other character insignificant.  It was really kinda sad because the show had so much promise.
Sonsofanarchy,37dbly,Zykium,1 point,Wed May 27 03:53:24 2015 UTC,I feel it was a good show all the way to the end. My biggest gripe is how Hal Lightman had to be an expert at everything.  SPOILER

Sonsofanarchy,37jwv8,TheWrathofShane,4,Thu May 28 04:05:18 2015 UTC,If Jax wants to leave it has to be a unanimous decision from the table. With clay still at the table in season 4 it would be difficult to let Jax go and still maintain the integrity of the club. I think you're underestimating the importance of the teller family to SOA.   Ultimately he was ready to walk away but not at the expense of letting the club die. SOA is Jax and vice versa. Once he lost Tara he had nothing else to lose.   As far as other members getting voted out it isn't as simple as being done with it. For whatever reason Kyle was kicked out after letting Opie go to jail without repercussion. But don't forget what happened to him when he didn't black out his ink. With clay it was only by Bobbys grace that he 1) told the truth and 2) didn't meet mr mayhem.
Sonsofanarchy,37jwv8,justmighthaveto,-3,Thu May 28 04:24:24 2015 UTC,"Hey if the man wants to leave, who is really going to look him in the eye and say no? Just be persistent and serious. If they didnt mayhem vote the member who got OPee locked up, and let him leave on bad graces, they are not going to mayheme vote jax. Its a free country and he doesnt have to show up for work.   Why not just share it with the club? Your telling me jax teller, the man with enough stones to get into heated gunfights all the time, doesnt have the stones to look his club in the eye and say I want out?"
Sonsofanarchy,37jwv8,justmighthaveto,3,Thu May 28 04:59:09 2015 UTC,"Work is one thing. Club is life for these guys. Heated gunfights are a part of the life. With Jax's involvement in SAMCRO with father figures such as JT/Clay the club is second nature to him.   A good series to watch is Gangland. Hour long escapades into various gangs throughout the nation discussing both how to get in, how to stay in, how they do their business and ultimately how to get out. Usually you get out of the club in a body bag. Even looking at Piney's age when he was shot what makes anyone think that he can go around in shootouts and what not.  Finally as much as they love the club they love the life more. The women, bikes, drugs, liquor, violence it's all a never-ending cycle. Ups and downs are rampant but you ultimately go through everything for the person next to you at the table."
Sonsofanarchy,37jwv8,justmighthaveto,1 point,Thu May 28 06:38:04 2015 UTC,"Link from an answers.com (I know, it's not entirely accurate but roll with me on this one)  There is only 2 ways to leave a motorcycle club. Good Standing and Bad Standing.  Good Standing * You die, while still a member of the club. (Usually honorary membership bestowed after death)    By some miracle, you manage to convince the other members of the club, that you wish to leave the club, ie. bad health, financial reasons, etc. (very rare)  Generally the old club members will leave this person alone. But, any badmouthing of the club can or will result in a good standing becoming a bad standing.    Bad Standing * You dishonor any of your club members or the club, or screw up in any manner that puts the club to shame. You leave on your own or you are thrown out.   Protocol when Bad Standing is bestowed upon an ex member of a club   The person will be punished, beaten, etc. every time one of the club members sees him. For ever. Bad Standing is for life. If that person joins another club and that new club knows about the bad standing, but still take the person as a member, that new club will also be punished severely. Only the club that initiated the bad standing status can lift or change this status."

Sonsofanarchy,37d1p2,some_dunkaroos,2,Wed Jun 3 17:27:52 2015 UTC,"I don't think he ever wanted to be part of the MC - but like the MC - he wanted to keep Charming safe. That line got SO old, but he used it often. Common goals, but different ways of going about it."
Sonsofanarchy,37d1p2,CreepyAbelTeller,2,Wed May 27 23:43:57 2015 UTC,"I don't think he wished he was with SAMCRO... he was enamored with Gemma obviously, even telling her that he's in love with her. But he knew what was best for Charming, and knew that cooperating with the Sons was definitely his best option for keeping the peace and keeping casualties down.   I think after a while, especially after he retired and became the Sons' on-hand whipping boy (disposing of bodies, retrieving intel for them, etc.) without a badge, he realized he was already so involved with the Sons on a day to day basis, that there was no getting out. Multiple times throughout the series he refuses to do something for The Club or for a particular person because he disliked the direction SAMCRO was heading, even telling people he's done helping them entirely, but continues to do so anyways. They were his family, and they were who he was ultimately loyal to. Without him, SAMCRO would have crashed and burned long ago, or else he would have been killed by Clay.   He didn't have any other legitimate options. They ended up making him who he was and he enabled The Club to eventually become what they were. They took care of each other."
Sonsofanarchy,37d1p2,teh1buck,1 point,Tue May 26 20:51:38 2015 UTC,"My theory would be that he was forced into a ""turn the other way"" type of situation when SAMCRO began. He just became comfortable with it. He never really wanted that lifestyle, but he knew he had a good thing going with them helping to protect Charming. They kept the streets clean and safe, and all Unser had to do was ignore the gun trafficking."

That's what she tells Nero. Unser does mention that he has known Gemma since she was a kid - which I don't really get if she didn't grow up there but I assume he was never meant to be the same age as her. Just that he has known her for a long time.   Wendy didn't grow up with Jax. That was never said nor inferred. In fact, very little of her history pre-pilot is known. I think it's pretty evident with the casting that she is meant to be older than him - there's no way she passes for early 30's. Tara is the same age as Jax - they went to high school together along with Eglee, Hale and Opie."

So Gemma and Unser growing up together, and Jax going to school/growing up with the others mentioned makes perfect sense   Also, actor's age most definitely does not equal character's so the guy who played Unser having to dye his hair is irrelevent"
Sonsofanarchy,37efxe,Captain_Murica91,0,Wed May 27 18:54:23 2015 UTC,I think you see this as a lazy thing done by Sutter don't you? While in fact it is an important link to the whole story. It helps to remind us that the city of Charming is just as much a character of the show as is any club member. Plus I was recently reading this article http://whatculture.com/tv/10-things-sons-anarchy-gets-right-bikers.php. it says that they are often pals with the Police. It's easier to be pals with a cop when you went to high school with him!
Sonsofanarchy,37efxe,VaneFreja,-1,Wed May 27 20:30:35 2015 UTC,"Where do we hear about Gemma and Unser growing up toghether? I'm only at S3E8, but didn't he just know her when she grew up, as she grew up in Charming?"

Sonsofanarchy,37a8ty,bwsmg718,1 point,Thu Jun 18 04:00:49 2015 UTC,Season 5 is only eclipsed by 6.   The transformation of Jax and the finale made that season amazing.
Sonsofanarchy,373oeq,TheRagedOrange,12,Sun May 24 16:07:27 2015 UTC,"I get it that the show was brutal and all, but I would look back at the show more fondly had it ended better. Jax, Tara, Abel, and Thomas living the dream in Oregon. Instead, we get Jax cowardly splatting into a semi with $15 worth of special effects. Seriously, that was the worst green screen effect this side of 1985."
Sonsofanarchy,373oeq,openhighapart,2,Mon May 25 04:25:11 2015 UTC,It seemed liked they rushed the finale. They must have had budget for better special effects than that

Sonsofanarchy,373oeq,teerev,2,Mon May 25 15:54:35 2015 UTC,"I thought it ended perfectly for how absurdly violent it got. Didn't see any problem with the green screen. Pretty much looked how such a thing would look. No faint green edges around anything, so I don't know what you're talking about.  I think his method of death may be a little far-fetched, but the guy was definitely stressed and ready to end it, just like juice was. It might be more plausible that he simple turn the gun on himself or something, but he might have felt the need to end it all in a sensible and meaningful way for himself as well as for everyone else, which just happened to include riding his dad's bike into a similar fate as his dad."
Sonsofanarchy,373oeq,damaged_but_whole,3,Wed May 27 13:36:21 2015 UTC,"The whole underlying message of the show is ""you can't just walk away from the club"" JT wanted to change things so his sons wouldn't take part in the club. This obviously didn't work out. Jax going out the way he did was somewhat poetic. He sacrificed himself so his kids could grow up in a life outside of the club. Outside of death, kidnappings, guns, etc. I would say it's far from cowardly. I think it's noble.. The special effects however could have used a little work haha"

Sonsofanarchy,373oeq,iamzombus,2,Sun May 24 19:06:05 2015 UTC,"I don't like how Jax went out either, or what season 7 showed him become, but I think we all knew that he wasn't escaping the reaper at the end of the show.  Also, this is how I felt when Gemma got lead to the dome."

Sonsofanarchy,373oeq,Hansono24,6,Sun May 24 21:24:33 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I found the final season incredibly difficult to watch. I didn't care about Jax anymore, nor could I sympathise with him. He'd become too much of a caricatured stereotype. I wasn't shocked at Gemma's death (special effects for that were horrid), and Jax's suicide was just.....bad (again, not to mention the special effects). I feel like the writers of the final season got far too bogged down in symbolism and sentiment to give the show the goodbye it deserved.   PS - Chibs 5eva."
Sonsofanarchy,373oeq,SuperBeard117,1 point,Mon May 25 08:05:02 2015 UTC,"Someone else just complained about Jax's death special effects. I literally saw nothing wrong with that at all. Did you actually? Or does the situation just cause you to realize it must be green screen and somehow that trumps your ability to appreciate the image at all?  As for his mom's death, I sat there in anticipation wondering what they were going to show and then for the split second they showed it, my reaction was ""oh that looked so fake"" but it was so brief, I immediately started questioning what I just saw. Did it look that fake? Seems the color of blood was off, looked kinda cartoony, but overall, looked kinda real, too. I never saw anyone get shot in the head from that angle. Yes, it looked pretty fake, but I'd rather that it did, actually. Pretty sick of all the realistic gore in that show by the end, quite frankly."
Sonsofanarchy,373oeq,damaged_but_whole,1 point,Wed May 27 13:45:55 2015 UTC,"I'm not complaining by any means, merely giving my opinion. If I didn't think it was a bit off then I wouldn't have said anything. In my opinion it was kinda cheesy and didn't look great, just my opinion.   Again, just my opinion, I thought Gemma's death looked super fake, and it was weird for a show that looked so real for 6 seasons to suddenly look so fake in the final season, to me it felt like they'd kind of stopped caring by that point. If you were sick of the violence, why watch the show? It's based around inherently violent subject matter."
Sonsofanarchy,373oeq,SuperBeard117,2,Wed May 27 13:53:59 2015 UTC,"I wasn't arguing with you or trying to put you down, I was just genuinely curious if you thought the green screen actually looked fake in some way or if it maybe was just a psychological thing where you knew it must have been green screen.    If you were sick of the violence, why watch the show? It's based around inherently violent subject matter.   There's a lot of inherently violent subject matter that doesn't get that violent.  A few way over-the-top shows caused this new mindset where we expect to see horrific violence to make a show supposedly more gritty and realistic; it didn't used to be that way. I would argue that S.O.A. actually got extremely unrealistic in the last few seasons specifically due to the violence.... But, you think I'm going to stop watching a show I got into because it got too violent for me? I wanted to see how it ended! :) Even if it was a semi-miserable experience for me. Lots of people ""enjoy"" entertainment they know is going to make them feel bad. I'm not the only one. I bet everyone who watched S.O.A. felt pretty shitty by the end, actually. Doesn't matter how much of a tough guy you think you are..."
Sonsofanarchy,373oeq,damaged_but_whole,1 point,Wed May 27 14:09:52 2015 UTC,"The green screen just kinda seemed like they'd chucked a fist full of money at someone and said ""eh, see what you can do, keep the change"". I think it would have been a bit more hard hitting if we never saw the truck, if that makes sense? Just seemed cartoonish.  Yeah I'll agree with you on that front! It did get very over the top violent, but it still looked realistic, then when they had Gemma's death the realism just kinda took a nose dive for me. I dunno, I just feel like everyone wanted to wrap the show up and finish it. As good as it was, it shouldn't have run for so long, because the last season was really laughable. Should have ended on season 5 or 6 rather than resolving everything so easily in season 7, just felt a bit chopped together."
Sonsofanarchy,373oeq,SuperBeard117,14,Wed May 27 14:28:31 2015 UTC,Love the show. But it dragged on for way too long. Gemma and Clay should've died earlier.
Sonsofanarchy,373oeq,n1ghtcheese,12,Sun May 24 19:01:33 2015 UTC,"It was a struggle to get to the end, should have ended in season 5. I'm glad it's over."
Sonsofanarchy,373oeq,Nick3867366,4,Sun May 24 17:43:51 2015 UTC,I loved it. Thought it was a very worthy end to a particularly spectacular series!
Sonsofanarchy,373oeq,AllAboutTheFairytale,2,Sun May 24 17:40:10 2015 UTC,"I loved the show - for better or worse. I wouldn't put it in my top 3 favorite shows of all time (i.e. Breaking Bad, Mad Men, Justified) because the quality was so inconsistent but it's one of the ONLY shows that I consistently re-watch. Seasons 1 - 4 were magical (well S3 kind of sucked but the last 2.5 episodes were pretty rad). Season 6 is when the show really started to dip in quality. Season 7 was all over the place and messy as hell. Sutter just isn't the same kind of show runner as Gilligan or Weiner - there's a noticeable lack of control he possesses when it comes to what should stay and what should end on the cutting room floor.   The show did give us arguably the strongest female character on television - Gemma Teller. She's the one I love to hate but boy is she is an indelible character.   Also - the show gave us the beauty as known as Charlie Hunnam's Hump. So, god bless."
Sonsofanarchy,373oeq,CreepyAbelTeller,4,Mon May 25 14:35:05 2015 UTC,Obviously we all hate it.
Sonsofanarchy,373oeq,FashionablyFake,2,Sun May 24 16:18:35 2015 UTC,"Totally agree, out of the many shows I watched (and liked), Sons of Anarchy appealed to me the most and is by far my favorite show. It kept me captivated and caring for all my favorite characters until the end, and the ending had me in tears of joy and sadness at the same time. This coupled with the fact that this whole story is an extended analogy to hamlet (a book I really like) made it ever the more genius."
Sonsofanarchy,373oeq,EasyPrinter,3,Mon May 25 14:23:07 2015 UTC,Best tv show? cmon. We all like the show but I think many of us here can agree it's nowhere near the best

Sonsofanarchy,373oeq,Scranton_Villager,2,Mon May 25 20:46:51 2015 UTC,"I watched Breaking Bad right before I watched Sons. I just finished Sons this weekend, and I have the opposite reaction than you do. Breaking Bad is hyped, just like Sons is, but I feel like it's just a better show overall. Better symbolism, fantastic cinematography, and better execution of its themes. I liked Sons a lot, don't get me wrong, but it didn't live up to the hype for me, especially the final season and resolution. Plus, the final 2-3 seasons seemed extremely forced and drawn out to me. The only saving grace was that Gemma was killed, I pretty much immediately hated her and was going to be extremely pissed if she managed to get away and live a life validated because she ""did it for her boys,"" or ""it was good for the club,"" when in reality, she was just a selfish, manipulating cunt."

It sure was entertaining, though. Great show... and yet absolutely miserable. :)  No spoilers here, just thinking about how everything ramped up in the last seasons and what the main story arc was."

Seasons 6 and 7 seemed like mocking parodies of the earlier season where things were more down to earth, and realistic.  Safe to say I wont be watching The Bastard Executioner, don't want to get invested in something else just to be let down because the creators just waiting for the cash check.

In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and nutmeg. 2. In another bowl, beat the eggs and then whisk in the milk and vanilla. 3. Melt the butter in a large cast iron skillet or griddle over medium heat. 4. Whisk the butter into the milk mixture. Add the wet ingredients to the flour mixture, and whisk until a thick batter is just formed 5. Keeping the skillet at medium heat, ladle about 1/4 cup of the batter onto the skillet, to make a pancake. Make 1 or 2 more pancakes, taking care to keep them evenly spaced apart. Cook, until bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, and the undersides are golden brown, about 2 minutes. Flip with a spatula and cook about 1 minute more on the second side. Serve immediately or transfer to a platter and cover loosely with foil to keep warm. Repeat with the remaining batter, adding more butter to the skillet as needed. 6. Procedure for adding fruit to pancakes: Once the bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, scatter the surface with sliced or diced fruit, or chocolate chips, nuts, etc. Flip with a spatula and cook for 1 minute more, being careful not to burn toppings"

Sonsofanarchy,370w61,GregDraven,9,Sat May 23 20:47:28 2015 UTC,"Creepy Abel had his best acting moment of the series there. When he says ""I love you, daddy,"" my heart broke for the both of them. The graveyard scene was more emotional to me - when Jax visits Opie's grave and finally Tara's grave. It was very telling - he had finally accepted death... not only their death but his own."
Sonsofanarchy,370w61,CreepyAbelTeller,4,Sat May 23 21:17:17 2015 UTC,I think you had an excellent acting moment when you went all self harming to get back at Gemma aswell. I think season seven was a good one for you creepy Abel!
Sonsofanarchy,370w61,AllAboutTheFairytale,2,Tue May 26 17:43:20 2015 UTC,Abel was one of my favorite characters in the show!
Sonsofanarchy,370a4k,SenorSalsaRumbles,7,Sat May 23 17:44:30 2015 UTC,"Wendy and Jax were friends who shouldn't have got married. I'm sure Jax pints that out aswell, and again when he tells Abel she is his mother. Jax cared about her, he did hurt her to keep his family together and that backfired, when Tara found out. I think Jax did a lot of things spare of the moment without realising the consequences, especially when it come to avenging/protecting Tara. Wendy needed to be deeply involved in season seven because she was such a big part of the final episode.  I liked Wendy, she was a genuine person with no ulterior motive in season 7, all she cared about was saving the kids! She was the only one who knew what Tara wanted for the kids. I loved how she and Jax come full circle in the show. She did love Jax, I don't think she forgot how he looked after her and let her see Abel in the beginning when I think she even felt like she didn't deserve to be a part of his life. And her being the final woman he spent the night with made sense to me. I loved how she and Nero took the boys away. Her character made sense to me I guess!"
Sonsofanarchy,370a4k,AllAboutTheFairytale,2,Sat May 23 18:24:35 2015 UTC,"""I liked Wendy, she was a genuine person with no ulterior motive in season 7, all she cared about was saving the kids!"" --- I understand this but that's not at all the way she came across in Season 1 and/or Season 7. She even tells Jax in Season 1 that she wants more than just Abel - she wants him as well. And in Season 7, that seemed to be the case. Abel never seemed like the priority - it was always Jax first and then Abel. I also can't get on board with her ""saving the kids"" when she was so fickle about ""the life."" She was with Tara in helping her get the kids out in Season 5 & 6 and then in Season 7 she keeps talking about how she is comfortable in Charming and what not. She did nothing to actually earn that happy ending whereas Tara died trying to protecting her children. If Jax hadn't pushed Nero in taking Wendy and the boys to the farm, would she have really left Charming? I don't think so. It always seemed like other people were setting up her decisions and almost forcing her to follow through - i.e Jax encouraging her to get help so she can get to know her son in Season 1, Tara telling her that she needs her to be a healthy guardian so to remain sober and help her with her plan, and Jax selling all of his property and setting her up with Nero to save his children. None of these are things she actively pushed for or tried to achieve herself. But I appreciate your insight - it's nice to hear a different perspective!"
Sonsofanarchy,370a4k,AllAboutTheFairytale,3,Sat May 23 18:47:50 2015 UTC,"I think she knew that Jax would never leave charming, and after Tara died she could have pushed to leave and ended the same way Tara did, or she could just do her best to make sure the boys were loved and safe. I think in season one her aim was to get Jax back, more so than Abel, but when she came back Abel was her main concern, and in season seven, Thomas too (which I loved, because when she was an absent mother, Tara raised her son, and when Tara couldn't look after her son anymore, I think it was brilliant that Wendy was the one who took on the mother role to Thomas). Her duty in season seven was to ensure the boys were cared for. She knew that she was the only one Tara trusted to take care of the boys, and so did Jax, which is why he let her back in I think. She didn't go out of her way to get Jax in season seven, he came to her, again full circle from season one. Since Tara died he had felt the ""endless disconnect"" he felt the last time he and Tara were separated, so it made sense to me that he would reconnect with Wendy to try to end that again. She said she was comfortable in the house- more so than when she previously lived there. I think she just made the best of a bad situation, she either had to accept the world, Jax's way, or argue that the kids shouldn't be there, in which case she knew Jax would send her away. I struggled with liking Wendy, but after thinking about it, I think there was more to her character than I first thought. She developed quite a lot throughout the series."
Sonsofanarchy,370a4k,Dariencro,1 point,Sat May 23 19:01:12 2015 UTC,"Interesting! I don't disagree with most of that. But I guess the part about ""Jax coming back to her"" or it being a reconnection of sorts in Season 7 just doesn't ring true. Much like in Season 1 after Donna's death, she comforted him - she led him to his bedroom. It takes two to tango but Jax was in a state of ""I'll take comfort in anyone right now."" That moment meant a lot to Wendy and probably very little to Jax since he had finally accepted Tara's death by that point and his own impending death. I think he respected her enough in the end to obviously leave his children in her care but it seemed awfully forced. He barely said a word to her the entire season and then by Ep 10 he's telling Abel that Wendy is his first mommy and they are sharing a hug.   I agree that she couldn't really just take the boys away because it would have ended badly for her but my point in saying that she didn't really stand for anything and just followed directions is basically a summarization of her personality which makes the whole ""fully fleshed out character"" seem very untrue. She did what she was told in Season 1 and she did what she was told in Season 7. I don't see that as development. She had more conviction in Season 4 - 5. But she regressed, IMO. Jax is just as toxic as drugs to Wendy. She had to leave that world to become clean. So comforting him in such an intimate way like she did in 7.12 is like relapsing. I thought up until that point she had made some progression. But after that... I just couldn't figure out if she had major selective memory or was just really stupid. I struggle to notice her importance in the series."
Sonsofanarchy,370a4k,teh1buck,4,Sat May 23 20:02:56 2015 UTC,i agree and i actully think that jax never really loved her and that sex in episode 12 is just how jax sees sex.you could see it throught to series when ever something big happens or jax is hurt he has sex
Sonsofanarchy,370a4k,Kwitcher_Bitchin,2,Mon May 25 21:05:44 2015 UTC,"To me, you could entirely disregard Jax's or anyone else's communication or interaction with Wendy and what she was meant to do. Even from Season 1-2, all she ever wanted was to be in Abel's life. It took her a while to get clean, but she made that effort, came back even Tara / Gemma were threatening her and was still hellbent on getting to see her son.   She might have cared for Jax because they had a son together.. hell, they might have actually worked out if they hadn't met and got pregnant when she was a junky. Under different circumstances, I think Wendy could have been really good for Jax.   I'm just glad it came full circle... Tara took care of Abel when Wendy was shunned and fell off the face of the planet for a while to get clean. Wendy still took a lot of shit from almost everyone, but after Tara's death, she is now the one to take care of Abel and Thomas."
Sonsofanarchy,370a4k,CreepyAbelTeller,1 point,Tue May 26 21:07:17 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your feedback! Wendy wasn't around in Season 2. And in Season 1, she point blank tells Jax that she wants more than Abel - she wants Jax. I do believe ultimately all she wanted was to be a part of Abel's life but her actions sometimes went against that. I don't doubt WHY she cares for Jax - I'm just confused why she acts like she has a chance with him and then after all the heinous stuff he does to her, she continues to be a doormat. When Jax was telling Abel about Wendy being his real mom, she looked more emotional in the part where he said that they were better off as just friends than when he was actually telling his son the truth. I don't know if it's because Drea's acting was off in that scene or the editing was bad, but it was strange.   Basically - I don't understand her existence. If she hadn't been in the series and Abel's birth and happened off-screen, nothing would have changed. The boys could have still driven off with Nero in the end.  I don't really know how Wendy would have been good for Jax. I don't really know how anyone really was - although after watching the series, I see why Tara was a formidable partner and smarter and stronger than any other woman on the show. Even if Wendy was sober and hadn't gotten pregnant at the time she did, I don't really see that changing how Jax felt about her - in the end, he seemed to not really want to be around her... because she was not Tara. So, if you eliminate Tara's existence, then yeah maybe but that's just not possible in SOA world. That's like saying, if you morph Wendy into Gisele Bundchen - then hell yeah, it would have worked! She can't be ""good"" for him if he didn't actually want to be with her/love her. They would just be glorified roommates."

Sonsofanarchy,371s20,bwsmg718,2,Sun May 24 02:15:43 2015 UTC,"You have some good points -- Sutter is a good writer but needs a co-show runner because giving him too much control results in bloated episodes and nonsensical scenes that should have been cut or trimmed. That being said, a lot of things that angered you are minor compared to other gaping plot holes.   For instance, Gemma's dad's nursing home bills. He probably had a retirement fund considering he was pastor and worked steadily for years before he fell victim to dementia. I don't think those things need to be discussed onscreen because one can just make the assumption that a + b = c. Gemma giving the ring to Abel makes sense to me because she is just THAT crazy. This is a woman who put everything into the club and is essentially a co-founder. After all the shit that went down, she still puts the club first and wants her legacy to continue so by giving the ring to Abel she's making sure that happens. Yes, she's on crack - the kind that kills people with carving forks.  Jarry and Chibs was my biggest qualm... of maybe the entire series. Well, just Jarry really. Chibs did not need that arc - it did NOTHING. And Jarry should have never existed. SOA has done a pretty good job of building up female characters - Tara and Gemma in particular - but with the rise of Jarry, they took their whole ""great female arc"" narrative and flushed it down the toilet.   Toric's arc was strange and it was a shame that he never really did anything except harass Otto and turn Tara in. But from what I understand, Sutter had a fully fleshed out arc for him but the actor had to leave the show due to another show and so they had to kill him off much earlier than anticipated. There was suppose to be this entire relationship between Otto and Tara - something about her discovering he had Huntington's Disease and attempting to help him in return for his help with her case. I think that could have worked and we would have seen Tara put on her doctor hat - but unfortunately that never happened."

Sonsofanarchy,36h425,DocDerry,15,Wed May 20 00:57:08 2015 UTC,"I don't get why we barrage ""real bikers"" with this question. Why would they care? It's a show about a biker club. They're a biker club. We don't ask doctors what they thought of Scrubs, or mental retard patients what they thought of Two and a Half Men. I don't get this acceptance everyone seeks."
Sonsofanarchy,36h425,Spinetablet,14,Tue May 19 14:39:20 2015 UTC,"Actually, asking doctors about Scrubs is probably pretty interesting. I always felt that Scrubs was actually (despite the fantasy sequences and such) an attempt at a ""realistic"" doctor show. Realistic as in, doctors screw stuff up, aren't always that smart, have human issues that affect their work, etc. In the same way, I care about what bikers have to say about SoA because I'm curious how much of it is reality vs how much of it is fiction. I've heard for example from more than one biker, that the show is actually a fairly accurate depiction of the 70s and the 80s, but is nothing like how things are now."
Sonsofanarchy,36h425,ucbiker,-4,Tue May 19 21:15:07 2015 UTC,Trying to shock someone who has flatlined without restarting the rhythm is dumb even for a comedy.
Sonsofanarchy,36h425,DocDerry,2,Wed May 20 00:59:59 2015 UTC,"I'd suggest because of the perceived volatile and violent nature of hardcore MCs and their perception that a TV show may somehow be disrespecting their lifestyle.   Not saying I agree with that, just saying I think that's why it gets asked."
Sonsofanarchy,36h425,Spinetablet,0,Tue May 19 14:47:41 2015 UTC,"That's true, but what do we gain from finding that out? I personally think, not much.

Sonsofanarchy,36drwb,GregDraven,26,Mon May 18 17:36:06 2015 UTC,"I think she genuinely cared about Jax and the boys, but not in the traditional mom/grandma way.  She cared about them in a selfish way; it was about her, not them."
Sonsofanarchy,36drwb,Cerberus73,16,Mon May 18 19:48:49 2015 UTC,My point exactly.
Sonsofanarchy,36drwb,GregDraven,3,Mon May 18 20:21:05 2015 UTC,"So, Gemma cared about Gemma."
Sonsofanarchy,36drwb,CreepyAbelTeller,30,Sun May 24 20:29:12 2015 UTC,"Unser was epic. The episode he basically told Jax to stop playing bikers and start being a good dad, that was gold.  I hate to say this, but the moment Jax tortured the chinese thug because of Tara was when I stopped caring about him.  Go, team Nero/Unser"
Sonsofanarchy,36drwb,Keeper-of-Balance,22,Mon May 18 16:59:44 2015 UTC,"I get that, and this will be downvoted on this sub, but I started hating Jax relatively early. He has done a lot of dumb shit to hurt everyone, but somehow he keeps getting free passes.   I have no idea why Jax gets all these free passes, but Juice HAS to die. Fuck that. Jax should have been dead way before Juice."
Sonsofanarchy,36drwb,idonotmath,14,Mon May 18 17:23:38 2015 UTC,There was the whole juice killing a member while trying to steal from the club and rat on them.
Sonsofanarchy,36drwb,kmutch,15,Mon May 18 23:57:26 2015 UTC,And being an easily manipulated coward for the rest of the series.
Sonsofanarchy,36drwb,chronicwisdom,9,Tue May 19 01:50:29 2015 UTC,"I totally see your side, but there's a reason. Jax was the prince. He was born into the club and it was his life. There was no playing at being a biker, there was no 'outlaw stage', there was just him and the club. Gemma made sure that the club was in his heart, and that is why he is given so many passes. With Jax, every decision was a club decision. He couldnt help but think that way. So, the club trusted and loved him for it. They knew that he would always look out for the club. Even when he fucked up, they knew he would never throw them under the bus. Juice showed that, when backed into a corner, he'd put himself first.  Juice only redeemed himself as a club member in his death, when he finally stopped thinking of himself first and was actually willing to do what the club needed. It's sad cause you can't blame Juice. He was always an outsider and he was mentored and manipulated by Clay, whom taught him that it was okay to betray the brotherhood for things you personally thought were worth it (like Gemma's love). Jax was driven by the vision of JT, the brotherhood of beliefs and unity--joining together, willing to give everything to this ideal of freedom.  TLDR; Jax is the result of JT's club of brotherhood, willing to do anything flr the club; Juice is the result of Clay's individualistic club."
Sonsofanarchy,36drwb,7V3N,3,Mon May 18 23:28:57 2015 UTC,"This is basically the response I was going to give, admittedly Jax made some calls that from an outside perspective could be called rash and unneeded. Though I also think it's important to realize that Jax Teller grew up in the club, he lived and breathed it from the day he was born, all he ever wanted was to get back to the days of his father. Unfortunately those days are far in the rear view and he didn't seem to realize it until it was too late. This thirst for the past is most likely what made Jax such an identifiable anti-hero for so many viewers but it was also what led to his demise in the final season."
Sonsofanarchy,36drwb,toneloc418,2,Tue May 19 00:43:18 2015 UTC,"That's a really good point - I never thought of it the way, the JT vs Clay club and how that affected individual members.   I'd argue that Jax put into practice both versions of the club. He started out with the same notion of JT's club of brotherhood but became more and more Clay-like in his decision making. He came full circle in the end and died as a result of JT's club of brotherhood but I do think there were decisions that were wholly Jax and no bleed through with either version of brotherhood. His own philosophy in Season 4 about getting out was to get away from what Clay had turned the club into and take JT off of the pedestal."
Sonsofanarchy,36drwb,CreepyAbelTeller,4,Sun May 24 20:37:58 2015 UTC,Probably because jax is the main character.
Sonsofanarchy,36drwb,DreamCatcher24,-3,Mon May 18 21:48:40 2015 UTC,"Once Jackson almost killed everyone with that bomb, we all knew he had to go. Hell, even before that, manipulating the table, hiding stuff. He wasn't a good guy for a while."
Sonsofanarchy,36drwb,bwsmg718,2,Mon May 18 21:59:44 2015 UTC,"How was Unser epic when he practically begged Tara in Season 6 to let him help her and the minute he realized that she was going to frame his beloved Gemma, turned on her and lured poor ol' Lowen into his trailer so that Jax could intimidate her? Or the time where he waddled over to Gemma's and told her that Tara had ratted and Jax was being picked up without even knowing the full story? Or how he went on and on in Season 7 about how everything he was doing was to protect Thomas/Abel and keep his promise to Tara when HE was partially the reason she was brutally killed and he never really helped her to begin with? Everything he did was stupid. If he had told Jax at any point that Gemma had sanctioned JT's death, I would have had some respect for him. Yes, he probably would have had to own up to his part in it too but me thinks he didn't know about Gemma/Clay's part in JT's murder until after it happened and then felt no choice but to help cover it up because he's a grade A dumbass and has a sick loyalty to Gemma. He died trying to protect a woman who would have probably put a bullet in him if Jax hadn't."
Sonsofanarchy,36drwb,CreepyAbelTeller,1 point,Sun May 24 20:33:04 2015 UTC,This is a great point!!
Sonsofanarchy,36drwb,BlackJackBob,7,Tue May 26 15:52:07 2015 UTC,"I think the idea was to portray a total disconnect from reality. The world she had built through years of lying was falling apart in front of her eyes. Her world had been destroyed and yes, she knew her fate was nearing.  I would chalk it up to a pure state of shock."
Sonsofanarchy,36drwb,ZomNoms,10,Mon May 18 16:27:24 2015 UTC,"I think Red Rose was one of the most powerful episodes of the series.  Not THE most powerful.  But it's up there.  I like when Jax is telling Nero about Gemma's deed, and the audio goes completely silent.  I also like the scene where Juice confesses to Jax. (That may not have been Red Rose, maybe the one before it).  The acting was so good between those two.  So powerful."
Sonsofanarchy,36drwb,PoisoningPerception,4,Mon May 18 16:32:12 2015 UTC,I love that Jax/Juice scene more because apparently it was all done in one take with two cameras.
Sonsofanarchy,36drwb,TeamStark31,1 point,Mon May 18 17:09:32 2015 UTC,"My heart was going crazy that scene, was kinda hoping for Jax to freak out and beat the shit outta juice"
Sonsofanarchy,36drwb,CHRISTINAK1980,6,Tue May 19 22:09:27 2015 UTC,"Gemma used Unser whenever she needed something. He loved her for some reason, but she didn't feel the same way. I think Clay calls him on this at some point...season 4? Maybe?"
Sonsofanarchy,36drwb,Jaymez82,7,Mon May 18 21:35:33 2015 UTC,I think she saw him as useful.  All she really did was use people to further her at the moment goal.  Gemma was the most self involved person on that show.
Sonsofanarchy,36drwb,jjsefton,3,Mon May 18 21:21:27 2015 UTC,"Gemma was a hard ass. She had to be hard after being surrounded by chaos and destruction most of her life. I think she genuinely cared about Unser but knew the two of them would not work together as a couple. He was the one guy in her life that didn't take advantage of her, that looked out for her best interests, and truly cared about her. The Sons ruled Charming because of Gemma and Unser.  As for her lack of emotion when Unser was killed, i think it seemed fitting for her character. Iirc, she didn't cry when Clay was killed, either. For the most part, Gemma was a pro at keeping the softer emotions at a distance. She understood the business that she was involved in."
Sonsofanarchy,36drwb,bens42608,4,Tue May 19 00:36:19 2015 UTC,IMO Gemma saw him as a sometimes useful pet. She (like most of the main characters on the show) was a psycho.
Sonsofanarchy,36drwb,AllAboutTheFairytale,2,Mon May 18 18:07:56 2015 UTC,"People fall in love with Gemma and she lets them hang around until she does something fucked up enough for them to leave her. Happened with John, Clay, Nero and ultimately Jax. Out of all the fucked up stuff it was just never enough for Unser to go because loving her was all he had in his shitty cancerous life. His wife left him when things got bad just like people leave Gemma when things get bad. But they're not the ones that leave. In a poetically ironic sort of way they were perfect for each other but it could never work."
Sonsofanarchy,36drwb,dlrfsu,1 point,Tue May 19 00:32:07 2015 UTC,"Gemma loved and cared about Tara and look how that worked out. I don't think she truly valued anyone but Jax, not even Abel and Thomas. I think she cared about Unser, but she cared about Jax more, and she knew Jax needed to kill her to avenge Tara. Unser was trying to protect her from the monster she created. Jax gave him the opportunity to leave, his argument wasn't with him, but Unser wouldn't leave, and he would have protected Gemma. Gemma knew she couldn't be protected from Jax, and in her warped state of motherhood, I don't think she wanted to be protected from him."
Sonsofanarchy,36drwb,SupALupRT,1 point,Mon May 18 17:29:58 2015 UTC,"Her lack of emotion can be explained by her realization that the end was at hand, not only her life, but all that she had tried to do for ""her boys"". Unser was never on a level equal to her family and she certainly was capable of killing him herself, if she thought it was needed."
Sonsofanarchy,36f3ab,bwsmg718,24,Mon May 18 22:04:30 2015 UTC,"In the end, it really is Gemma."
Sonsofanarchy,36f3ab,dlrfsu,3,Tue May 19 05:12:02 2015 UTC,She and Caitlyn Stark should hang out together.  Everything is Gemma's fault.
Sonsofanarchy,36f3ab,mstibbs13,1 point,Tue May 19 14:17:21 2015 UTC,Yep. This.
Sonsofanarchy,36f3ab,CreepyAbelTeller,3,Sat May 23 04:38:32 2015 UTC,Season 7 was mostly Jax becoming and exceeding who he hates.
Sonsofanarchy,36f3ab,XA36,3,Tue May 19 15:06:54 2015 UTC,"Jax ultimately killed more people than Clay in the end... but I'm on that Gemma hate train. She instigated, was involved, or her lies set in motion a lot of things that could have realistically been avoided if it wasn't for her meddling, lying, and manipulation.

Now it's mostly about respect, and many of them will fight for it; the cossacks MC will kill for it. The territory thing is a respect issue. The Bandidos have claimed texas as their main stomping ground and the Cossacks show up from Russia wearing wearing angel colors and a Texas bottom rocker? Hell no. That's a slap in the face and piss in their boots. MC's history and tradition define them and they fight for it.   In reality, the Bandidos are the outlaw club i understand the best, and if you can wade through the arrest/bad news, there is a journalist that they let hang with them for a while that's worth a read. I think he says that realistically there is 90% of bandidos that live and work normally with jobs and shit, but just with brothers and leather and Harleys. The Bandidos president also claims that the members caught doing anything illegal are doing so independently.

Also to my surprise he was arrested in 2008 for drug possession (coke and some hash). Good thing for him he kind of turned it around in the last few years.

Sonsofanarchy,36a8z0,locxation,8,Sun May 17 18:29:13 2015 UTC,"I did this exact same thing. I started in 2008 and by the end of the series it was early 2010. Seasons 1-3 take place pretty much back to back with 3 weeks between 1 and 2 and about 3 days between 2 and 3. Also, in Season 2, 3 weeks passes between episode 2 and 3, Clay says it's been 3 weeks since Gemmas ""car accident"". Season 3 episodes on the other hand pretty much take place back to back, So on my timeline Seasons 1-3 take place over a 3 to 4 month period.   14 months pass between Seasons 3 and 4. 3 weeks between 4 & 5 a few days between 5 & 6 and 10 days between 6 and 7. Each of those seasons episodes take place nearly back to back barring a few days here and there. Thus in my timeline Seasons 4-7 take place over the course of 4 months. Add all that together and the series only takes place over the span of about 2 years.  However, The show is notorious for its continuity problems. 1:Abel was stated in Season 7 to be 5 years old. That is impossible because A: Abel wasn't even a year old when Tara was pregnant with Thomas, thus if Abel is 5 Thomas should not still be a baby, yet he is; and B: there is no way 5 years have passed since the beginning of the first season. 2: Gemma's age currently and when she met John varies from Season to Season. In Season 1 she says she will be 51. That's in 2008 meaning she was born in either 1957 or 1958. Then in Season 3 she says she's 53, despite the fact only a few months have passed since Season 1. Also, she continuously says she met John when she was 18 and was pregnant with Jax two months later. We know for sure Jax was born in 1978 (the only year that stays consistent) meaning she was either born in 1959 or 1960.  3: Through out the series Jax and Tara were said to be around the same age, it was said they met when they were 16 and Tara left when they were 19, the year 1997. We know from Jax that 11 years have passed between Tara leaving and then coming back. That adds up to 2008 which works for the first season. However her tombstone says she was born in 1980 which screws that whole timeline up.  4: events are referenced in the series that happened in the year that season premieres such as Nero's Zero Dark Thirty reference in Season 6 2013.  In the end I don't think a straight timeline can ever be figured out because of the numerous continuity problems created by the writers. The main screw up in the timelines is Abels age. He is aged up way too fast while his brother Thomas never ages past infancy."
Sonsofanarchy,36a8z0,starkk92,1 point,Sun May 17 19:30:27 2015 UTC,"Thank u for ur feedback :) I appreciate it! Yeah keep in mind I know that the timeline is all screwed up. Like you pointed out, its because of having so many writers.  I agree with what u said, that abel was aged too fast but I am going to keep at it watching all the details like a hawk.  I will let u know the point at which i cant keep it together anymore.  At the end of the pilot, it does however seem that 3 or 4 days have passed in just the first episode though."
Sonsofanarchy,36a8z0,starkk92,1 point,Sun May 17 21:37:41 2015 UTC,No problem :) Whatever I can do to help. And your correct that at least 3 days pass in the pilot alone.

If u or anyone is interested in me continuing I will go onto episode 2 but even if I get no love on here I will prob do it just for fun myself to see where it gets too hard to follow"
Sonsofanarchy,36a8z0,CreepyAbelTeller,2,Sun May 17 22:58:39 2015 UTC,Pretty sure you're right in that the pilot covers 3 nights and ends Saturday night. Second episode begins the next day. I definitely think you should continue.

I've heard great things about a orange is the new black so that will be going on my playlist as well! House was also great Imo...I haven't seen it in its entirety but the bird and pieces i have seen of it I really liked!    Edit: fixing spelling mistakes

Sonsofanarchy,36bssz,Machr,4,Thu May 21 17:55:26 2015 UTC,"The Sopranos, The Wire, Justified, and Banshee.    Also if you like science fiction, Battlestar Galactica, Farscape, Babylon 5, and Firefly."
Sonsofanarchy,36bssz,imabden,2,Mon May 18 13:11:17 2015 UTC,Banshee is the shit! A must watch
Sonsofanarchy,36bssz,iamirishpat,1 point,Thu May 21 04:09:44 2015 UTC,"Are these on Netflix?  I LOVER the first two seasons of Sopranos but never made it past that because at the time I didn't have cable or Netflix.  Im definstely going to watch Justified at some point and the wire also seems right up my alley.  What is Banshee?  And I've seen Babylon 5 but none of the others.  Battlestsr Galactica gets great reviews..also what are Farscape and firefly?  If you had to pick ONE of your lister Science Fiction references aside from B5 what would you say is the most worthy of me checking out?  Same goes for sopranos, the wire, banshee and justified.,pick one!!"
Sonsofanarchy,36bssz,NLPEI,1 point,Mon May 18 20:53:31 2015 UTC,"For the SF, they are all unique so it is hard to say which one would be ""most worthy"" but Battle Star Galatica is really good with the theme what does it mean to be human.  Well done writing, production, and acting.  Firefly is only 13 episodes and a follow on movie of a Josh Wheden show about cowboys in space.  Great show, cut down in its infancy by corporate slugs at Fox.  Farscape is totally different animal with top quality Jim Hensen puppets to flesh out really weird aliens, but the story is an astronaut is flung through a worm hole to some other galaxy and is stuck on a  living ship with escaped convicts being chased by the ""peacekeepers."" 4 seasons plus a couple of movies of pure fun.    Banshee is a cinimax production about an ex con who assumes the identity of a new sheriff in the town of banshee.  Over the top violence and a cast of great characters. 3 seasons with a 4th coming 2016.  Comparison of Justified to SOA, Justified has better stories, writing, actors, and acting.   Are these on Netflix?   Firefox and Farscape are, the rest no.    There is always the public library and other creative ways of procuring media entertainment."
Sonsofanarchy,36bssz,NLPEI,4,Tue May 19 11:51:09 2015 UTC,The Sopranos is the best thing to ever happen to the entertainment industry.  Watch it.

Sonsofanarchy,36bssz,CaptainCoral,2,Thu May 21 19:27:20 2015 UTC,"Try The Killing.  Very well written and acted, kind of a dark murder mystery / police drama type of thing with local politics involved."

It's got a similar characterization in that most you either love or hate --- written excellent --- intense drama. If you haven't, you should try it. Very easy to binge-watch."
Sonsofanarchy,36bssz,Kwitcher_Bitchin,1 point,Mon May 18 19:36:59 2015 UTC,No I have not but that is also something I have on my queue and was planning on getting around to it at some point!  Right now my main choices are TWD/Dexter/Peaky Blinders and Daredevil..how many seasons are there of the walking dead?
Sonsofanarchy,36bssz,PoisoningPerception,2,Mon May 18 20:09:32 2015 UTC,"There's 4 on Netflix.... but AMC started to do the split-seasons, so the 3rd and 4th seasons have 16 episodes. I'm maybe onto the 4th or 5th episode of Daredevil .... personally it didn't hook me the same way. But it's extremely well done. Just not binge-worthy to me. But many love it. I'll also second Battlestar Galactica as someone else mentioned. It's really great."
Sonsofanarchy,36bssz,JoeShmoe99,1 point,Mon May 18 20:17:04 2015 UTC,"Peaky Blinders is ... OK.  It's about a family of gangsters in post-WWI England and their attempts to rise up in the underworld and battles with the police.  You'll have to watch it with subtitles because the accents are thick.  I have one episode to go in S1 (been waiting six weeks - which kind of shows that it's not at the top of my list).  Supposedly, S2 is better."

It's just not doing it for me..."" Then around end of season 2 it got fucky, the good kind though, like woah! It's all coming together...

Sonsofanarchy,36bssz,Kurtronic,1 point,Sat May 23 22:27:03 2015 UTC,I actually might be interested in Nip/Tuck because I really enjoy American Horror Story and I believe the writers of it (Ryan Murphey/Brad Falchuk) started out with Nip/Tuck before soing Glee and AHS
Sonsofanarchy,36bssz,ohmyluckystars,1 point,Sat May 23 22:50:21 2015 UTC,"Yup, that's what got me to watch AHS. Dunno if Glee is worth watching, I can't get my mind past the teenage pop drama exterior."

Sonsofanarchy,36b1ig,goodguypatrick,4,Sun May 17 22:33:59 2015 UTC,I think a lot of the dates and timelines were off. Look at Abel and Thomas in season seven... Poor Thomas was never given the ability to walk despite the three years Abel aged in his presence. It's common knowledge the timelines don't add up... Still an awesome show though :)
Sonsofanarchy,36b1ig,AllAboutTheFairytale,1 point,Mon May 18 00:10:06 2015 UTC,"The timelines don't match up perfectly, but I was also thinking back to season 3 when it's revealed that John spent a lot of his time in Belfast. Perhaps it was a combination of being club president (how often did we see the other members with their kids) and time spent in Belfast that contributed to an almost non-existent relationship between John and Jax."
Sonsofanarchy,36b1ig,becasaurusrex,1 point,Wed May 20 23:40:36 2015 UTC,"I always wondered how much time Jax spent with John. But the dates may be off on Wikipedia. I think there are a couple of good shots of his headstone in Season 1 - 4, so maybe you could get a more accurate date there.   Also, I highly doubt Clay gave Jax the sex talk. Considering Jax's sex drive, he probably figured all of that out on his own. :)"

Sonsofanarchy,368unn,Tomcat1108,5,Sun May 17 14:51:05 2015 UTC,"Also, according to the DVD commentary, the little skullcap helmets they wear in the States are illegal in Ireland so they had to wear helmets with ear covering."
Sonsofanarchy,368unn,tragicallywhite,2,Sun May 17 15:07:15 2015 UTC,"First, they were skipping a hearing they were supposed to be at, so a lot of agencies would be keeping an eye out for them.  Second, I'm assuming they were wanting to stay low key while in Ireland given they were on bad terms with at least Jimmy O and even some of the other Kings.  There also could be some club by-law we didn't know about."

Sonsofanarchy,35wgnl,Ey3z0nF1rE,7,Thu May 14 02:11:29 2015 UTC,"I interpreted it as a power thing. Both Tara and Gemma are very strong women, but don´t have any actual power over the men. So she was turned on by her power over Otto.  Or Kurt Sutter wanted to show how much he turns women on by masturbating."
Sonsofanarchy,35wgnl,ConsiderQuestioning,3,Thu May 14 11:02:11 2015 UTC,"Right before Tara feels herself up, she kisses Jax rather aggressively (which is completely unlike her) and he looks surprised and then reciprocates but pulls away and tells her to ""hold that thought"" so he can go deal with delivering Frankie's body to Roosevelt. Tara was clearly horny - having just freshly showered and wanted some of that Hunnam Hump - so smelling the perfume reminded her of how passionately Otto loved LuAnn, even after her death. I think her touching herself is essentially reminding herself of how much she loves Jax but also wanting that same kind of passion. They start to drift once Opie dies, so there's this lasting theme throughout Season 5 and most of Season 6 where they aren't quite where they use to be."
Sonsofanarchy,35wgnl,CreepyAbelTeller,2,Sat May 23 04:11:05 2015 UTC,"My interpretation of it was that she was incredibly lonely. Jax was always away with the club, and Tara was always left alone with the kids.  I think she went a bit weird after the hand incident aswell, where she wanted Jax and Gemma to reassure her they loved her. Maybe she just wanted to love herself a bit too haha"
Sonsofanarchy,35tyzr,rd8t,11,Wed May 13 14:19:19 2015 UTC,Sutter said in an interview (I don't remember where) that she was the angel of death. She IS death. The blanket is symbolic of deaths cloak. Jax was becoming the reaper. Symbolism.
Sonsofanarchy,35tyzr,angerdome,5,Wed May 13 18:39:25 2015 UTC,"A lot of people posted about not liking the finale, but I enjoyed it.  He had to face up to what he had done, took it upon himself to take out those who had seriously wronged them and could harm the club, the sorrow felt by club members, and the song they chose as he rode in the end.  Sutter was clear that it would never have a happy ending, and I thought he did a decent job of it.  Was it perfect, no, but it was still a suitable ending."
Sonsofanarchy,35tyzr,Wh1teMorgan,9,Wed May 13 19:26:10 2015 UTC,That scene on the steps though was fucking perfect!
Sonsofanarchy,35tyzr,woozi_11six,10,Wed May 13 21:12:53 2015 UTC,She gave him the blanket in season one. He was just returning it back to her in the cemetery.
Sonsofanarchy,35tyzr,AllAboutTheFairytale,1 point,Wed May 13 14:35:07 2015 UTC,"bad wording, but I know, but you see him returning it on screen, you don't see him receive it from her.   I was just wondering if it was a coincidence, or some connection to S1"
Sonsofanarchy,35tyzr,medievaleagle,2,Wed May 13 14:36:31 2015 UTC,"You see him give it to her in S1, and I'm sure she tries to give him a hoodie back in return and he tells her to keep it if I remember correctly!  So I think the idea was to assume she swapped the hoodie for the blanket, or that she looked after him when he was drunk, what with her being kind of a guardian angel to Jax/angel of death That was my interpretation anyways But as Kurt Sutter says: ""she is who she is, and she represents what she represents"" She means whatever you want her to mean I think"
Sonsofanarchy,35tyzr,TeamStark31,2,Wed May 13 16:49:47 2015 UTC,"See, I didn't really catch the meaning of homeless chick either."
Sonsofanarchy,35tyzr,ColmM36,3,Wed May 13 14:39:26 2015 UTC,it was easy to miss.  he has a conversation in season 5 or 6 with someone who tells of his wife dying in an accident caused by JT's death.
Sonsofanarchy,35tyzr,iamzombus,3,Wed May 13 14:42:18 2015 UTC,"I think you are talking about Brooke's father. The girl who throws the wrench through the window and later is with Ratboy. The homeless woman is possibly the ghost of her mother, or something that assumes her form. She seems to show up whenever Jax needs prodding in a direction he doesn't want to go."
Sonsofanarchy,35ukuv,MasterUnlimited,9,Wed May 13 17:12:02 2015 UTC,"I feel like the show would lose me if Jax could tell the DA the day was going to end in mayhem, and then have her just do nothing to try and stop him.  It would've been bad ass just to hear Jax say it though."
Sonsofanarchy,35ukuv,DogsBestMan,1 point,Wed May 13 17:48:41 2015 UTC,But what could she have done? Maybe had him followed. That's about it. It wouldn't have been a confession of anything.   And it would have had the same exact meaning of what he did say. I just think it would have been a better quote.
Sonsofanarchy,35ukuv,dbers92,1 point,Wed May 13 18:52:29 2015 UTC,Legally speaking she could detain him thus throwing off his timing for everything. Marx would be out of court/jail and impossible to catch by surprise for Jax at that point. But I do agree. Mayhem would have sounded bad ass.
Sonsofanarchy,35ukuv,DogsBestMan,1 point,Thu May 14 07:42:03 2015 UTC,"I didn't say she would be able to stop him, or that he would be confessing anything, only that suggesting mayhem would have made her do SOMETHING. If someone issues a bomb threat, authorities act to eliminate the threat in whatever ways they can, they don't just wait and see.  Patterson knows who Jax associates with and whom he feuds with. At the very least, she could increase the amount of patrolmen around all Sons associated venues. I'm sure she would've made a connection to his feud with Marks and tried to keep an eye on him too, which would've made it impossible for Jax to get away after shooting him."
Sonsofanarchy,35ukuv,vostheboss,5,Thu May 14 12:37:10 2015 UTC,"The important part about ""the bad guys lose"", is that it reflects what Jax told Nero earlier in the episode about how his kids should remember him as a bad guy. He is one of the bad guys that loses at the end of the day. Also SAMCRO has been profiled by Gang Task Force and the authorities long enough for everybody to know full well what Mayhem means."
Sonsofanarchy,35ukuv,AllAboutTheFairytale,2,Thu May 14 00:51:57 2015 UTC,"I think it was the perfect quote! The bad guys did lose, barosky lost his life, marks lost his life, the ira lost a king, and Jax lost his life, And the club lost Jax.  The little smile on pattersons face wouldn't have made sense if that quote hadn't been said and I loved that bit. I think Patterson was really good, and I don't think she hated Jax. Especially after the confession. She knew he had lost most of what he loved."
Sonsofanarchy,35ukuv,AllAboutTheFairytale,-4,Wed May 13 18:31:46 2015 UTC,Right. Everyone died. It was pure mayhem.
Sonsofanarchy,35ukuv,AllAboutTheFairytale,2,Wed May 13 18:53:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but if he had said to Patterson- mayhem happens at the end of the day she would never have let him leave the office. Why would a DA let an outlaw/murder/criminal leave her office to cause mayhem?... It wouldn't happen. But she would let him leave to make sure the bad guys lose."
Sonsofanarchy,35ukuv,rd8t,-1,Wed May 13 19:21:54 2015 UTC,"What could she hold him there for? Because he said mayhem?   You can't arrest someone because you think they will commit a crime.   In the end he meant the same thing, and she knew it. She let him go anyway."

Sonsofanarchy,35orih,MrCoolCol,14,Tue May 12 07:34:40 2015 UTC,"I usually watch with subtitles. This was all relevant at the time because Venus was having doubts about the validity of her relationship with Tig. The stubble was representative of what she thought was a barrier to a real relationship. I thought this was a very interesting episode because it really humanized the character past the usually ""man lady"" jokes."
Sonsofanarchy,35orih,XA36,7,Tue May 12 12:55:21 2015 UTC,It was Tig that was first having severe doubts about the validity of the relationship because he saw her for the first time with a public male trait and not as a sexual desire. Could he see past that aspect of her in the long term or was this something that was just too large for him to deal with.  Venus saw it as fault that she could not control and barrier to having Tig love her for her.  Indeed you are correct that it was a very interesting and excellent episode. The scene following it was particularly impactful and was easily Kim Coates best scene in the series.

Sonsofanarchy,35qnp9,PoisoningPerception,2,Sun May 17 02:58:25 2015 UTC,"Also, sutter loves a little bit of simbolism, if you look at it in a different way, it can mean jax was feeling some phantom pain, foreshadowing his mother's blood on his feet at the end of the episode."

Sonsofanarchy,35jnup,bwsmg718,41,Mon May 11 00:41:14 2015 UTC,Contractual obligations required at least four seconds of Jax-ass every episode.
Sonsofanarchy,35jnup,GunsGermsAndSteel,28,Mon May 11 04:21:35 2015 UTC,"I think it was familiarity, loneliness, and comfort. At that point think of all that Jax had lost by that point.  Everything was slipping through his fingers and there she was, holding together what was left of his family.  The past be damned,  And she was familiar, they were in love once. Wendy stepped up in the end."
Sonsofanarchy,35jnup,slyevilhomer,13,Mon May 11 01:45:30 2015 UTC,"I brought up Wendy's sexuality a while back. After her girlfriend leaves, she has a conversation with Gemma who encourages her to ""go back to dick.""  In later conversations with Brooke and Bobby, Wendy says in no uncertain terms that she still loves Jax, for better or for worse.  As for Jax sleeping with her, I think a) he needed someone to be with him, b) it showed that Wendy really had become part of the family, and c) it brought things full circle, in a way.  Just my two cents."
Sonsofanarchy,35jnup,some_dunkaroos,7,Mon May 11 01:47:35 2015 UTC,I took it as a comparison to when him and Tara banged after he killed Kohn (think I'm spelling that right).  Seems like jax just likes to fuck at some really odd times.
Sonsofanarchy,35jnup,atmospherical,5,Mon May 11 03:32:50 2015 UTC,"Almost forgot that they had sex when that happened, that's precedent, u are correct, Jax loves to kill then bang."
Sonsofanarchy,35jnup,atmospherical,2,Mon May 11 04:29:01 2015 UTC,"I'd say they were his two most emotional kills as well, yes even more than his revenge on who he thought killed her.  First was his attempt to be human, and Gemma was his realization that there was nothing left."
Sonsofanarchy,35jnup,CreepyAbelTeller,1 point,Mon May 11 05:14:28 2015 UTC,Except when he banged Tara it was emotional but it went beyond just killing Kohn -- it was this big moment of them reconnecting and Jax going from the 10+ years of mindless fucks to being with the woman he has always loved. When he banged Wendy he was completely empty on the inside having just killed his mother and accepted his death and finally Tara's death. He would have banged the nearest female in that moment. I don't think those two scenarios are remotely similar.
Sonsofanarchy,35jnup,rd8t,5,Sat May 23 04:23:27 2015 UTC,"I'd go in with the idea that she was heavily bisexual.  She wanted him but couldn't have him as he was madly in love with Tara, and having an attraction to women felt it was a natural progression (note:  This is not a thought of how anyone who is LGBT thinks or reacts, just a possible take on a fictional character).  That last season, she stepped up and worked hard to take care of his boys and family.  She came a long way from junkie who nearly killed her child to caring and responsible mother.   Combine that with the fact that Jax, after killing Gemma, was of the realization that he became the very thing he hated in life.  Everything was a chaotic mess, mainly because of him, while Wendy had become a sort of stability in his life.    The irony from season 1 to 7 is that Wendy was able to achieve everything that Jax wanted.  Stability, inner piece, etc.  She moved away from the toxic things in her life that brought harm to herself in others, while he took his family and club even deeper into the very things he set out to free them from.  Suddenly he is of the mind of knowing everything, and what he became, and how she is what he wanted to be, and perhaps, at least in that moment, he feel in love with her because of who she became and how that's who he desperately wanted to be."
Sonsofanarchy,35jnup,CreepyAbelTeller,2,Mon May 11 16:10:27 2015 UTC,Great post!
Sonsofanarchy,35jnup,iamzombus,1 point,Mon May 11 16:24:46 2015 UTC,"See I think the concept of Wendy is great but the execution made no sense. She didn't achieve all those things - or at least it was very very temporary and vague. She came back into Jax/Tara's life to get to know Abel and handled it horribly (ambushing Tara while she was in the hospital with a mangled hand) and then fell prey to Gemma almost immediately. She tells Tara to get out of Charming in Season 5 because it kills everything you love and then she comes back in Season 7 and tells Brooke that she feels more comfortable in that home than before - which is just gross considering two people were murdered there. She was 9 days sober at the beginning of the season, so to call her stable is a bit of a stretch especially when she could have easily relapsed when she was helping the pantyhose preacher's wife sober up (Abel interrupted that)."
Sonsofanarchy,35jnup,AllAboutTheFairytale,3,Sat May 23 04:30:01 2015 UTC,I thought it was funny in the episode where they show everyone is having sex and there she is alone in bed with a vibrator.
Sonsofanarchy,35jnup,CreepyAbelTeller,4,Sun May 24 19:41:51 2015 UTC,"I think this question can be answered by referring back to Jax's epic speech to Tara at the end of season one.  He married Wendy because he was lonely and he was trying to stop the endless disconnect. I think it makes sense that when he felt disconnected again, disconnected because of the loss of Tara, again, he would turn to Wendy. Especially since she had really proven herself, as a stable figure, a good mother and a loyal friend. Wendy did love Jax, she always loved Jax, and in season one Jax cared a lot for her. He wouldn't let Gemma call her a junkie, he made her get the help she needed because he didn't want her hurting herself. I think their relationship went full circle, so I guess to me, it made perfect sense that the last person he made love to was the mother of one of his boys."
Sonsofanarchy,35jnup,gingerbeef7,2,Mon May 11 06:28:18 2015 UTC,"I hated it. To be fair, I absolutely hate the character of Wendy. She had zero development and was SO inconsistent and bland.   The thing that always irked me about her was that she was clearly someone Jax got with because Gemma pushed for it (Wendy admits this in Season 6) and he was VERY clear that he never loved her - even in Season 1 when he was arguably the nicest to her. After he shot her up with a speedball in Season 5, I thought she would have a more interesting arc in Season 6 but she was as passive and boring as she was in every other season. And then for her to say she enjoys the chaos in Season 7 and clearly sit around and pine for Jax when he barely said a word to her beyond babysitting duties was just nonsensical. I think I also just disliked them together because they have the exact opposite of chemistry so it always looked like he was chatting it up with one of his mother's friends."

Sonsofanarchy,35jnup,CreepyAbelTeller,2,Mon May 11 00:50:59 2015 UTC,"I think jax just needed love. I dont remember who exactly says it to tara, but I think it was Opie. He tells tara that jax can't make it on his own, so in that moment he just needed to confide in her."
Sonsofanarchy,35kqln,gabrielle1106,9,Mon May 11 08:07:55 2015 UTC,"She doesn't any need a boy to handle her shit. I love Tara. She was one of my favourite characters in the show.  I loved what she means to Jax. And how protective he is of her. She symbolises all that is good in his world Her character is different to the rest of them because she isn't an outlaw, she is a professional. She is living in a world full of people who are very different from her in many ways. I guess I'm just a fan of the Jax and Tara love story... Afterall- I'm all about the fairytale!

Sonsofanarchy,35kqln,hutchero,1 point,Tue May 12 18:57:58 2015 UTC,"I think part of that blame is Jax's, too. Tara wasn't expecting Jax to leave SAMCRO until he himself said ""I'm out."" She was ready to go before he proposed to her. Yes, she's flaky in her decision making but she wanted her children to grow up with a father (and not repeat her own childhood) but also realized eventually that Jax wasn't ever going to leave. It's one thing if she was just assuming he was out but he was making promise after promise that he was going to leave the MC and give her a beautiful life."
Sonsofanarchy,35kqln,dbers92,1 point,Sat May 23 04:53:36 2015 UTC,"Big Tara fan here, too. I love her and I love her and Jax together. She is a big part of who he is - especially his heart. You have to remember, she's not really a part of the MC world so her version of handling shit is very much like a normal civilian which isn't as fun or controversial as the MC so it may come off as boring. At her core, she's this angry, badass teenager but she left Charming to make something of herself and carefully constructed this identity that slowly starts to peel apart as the series progresses.   I think you are writing her off too quickly if your main critique is that she's annoying. She's Jax's moral and ethical anchor, so she's not going to agree with everything our flawed hero does. Her relationship with Gemma is fascinating. They have a surrogate mother/daughter relationship, and to see the ways in which one views the other inferior and in other parts of their life superior, is really really interesting. It's deep and I wish more people looked into that because it's one of the more fascinating dynamics that I've seen on television.  As for what Jax sees in Tara? She's beautiful, she's educated, she made something of herself on her own, and she doesn't just put up with his shit and fawn all over him like most women. He's loved her since he was a kid. And she's essentially an orphan, so the only family she has ever known is Jax and by extension Gemma (see surrogate mother comment above)."

But then when I re watched the series for the second time, I absolutely loved and adored her. She gets a lot better after the first season in my opinion,  and their chemistry gets a lot better too. I can't really tell you why she's a good character without ruining the other seasons but just keep watching, I think you'll start to like her more eventually."

I don't quite understand why after watching sons of anarchy, which demonstrates the life in the light it does, anyone would be influenced to want to engage in that life.  Sure, in the beginning it seems cool and exclusive, and maybe the violence and destruction is exaggerated, I wouldn't know, and anybody in an MC will know what the life it really like, it might be great in reality, but I don't think this show sells the lifestyle as something people would want.

Sonsofanarchy,354lw7,ShadowDCL,1 point,Thu May 7 06:53:35 2015 UTC,Also finished tonight. Very tempted to stop by here and check things out but I knew what would happen. I learned a while back on a different show not to read anything until your done. It's hard but worth it.
Sonsofanarchy,352vp4,Gudtymez,2,Wed May 6 17:24:15 2015 UTC,I guess it was to show how serious Damon Pope and August Marks are. Laroy was just another henchman to them and are easily replaced.

Sonsofanarchy,353td8,AllAboutTheFairytale,3,Wed May 6 23:01:53 2015 UTC,His accent is really odd. Even in Green Street he doesn't sound quite right. Haha.

Sonsofanarchy,351dvu,Sharaghe,7,Wed May 6 08:21:24 2015 UTC,I always just assumed that Marks knew that Jax was the one that orchestrated Pope's murder.
Sonsofanarchy,351dvu,CaptainCoral,5,Wed May 6 15:52:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Jax insinuated he was the reason for popes death but Marks wanted to be the main guy on the streets as pope mentored him to be, I don't think Marks was particularly bothered so long as he had someone to send the hit man after for revenge. As far as I was concerned Marks knew Jax set Clay up!"
Sonsofanarchy,34zypd,pssychesun,13,Tue May 5 23:25:58 2015 UTC,"The CGI seemed to bother everyone, I was too emotional to even notice when I watched the final haha! Bobbys issue throughout every series was when members didn't take things to the table, that's when he spoke against decisions. Bobby loved Tara too. He told her so when he last spoke to her so I think her death would have impacted him heavily too. Jax was open with the decisions he was making- it was his battle, and they could join him or not, in his passionate speech in the first episode. I understand that it seemed out of character for bobby to accept the violence but he loved Tara, and he loved what she meant to Jax, and I think he expected to have to go through the revenge with Jax.  But I totally get that point. Juice- I think what he did was a big deal. Jax was already aware that juice gave the club up in the Rico case, so he had already betrayed the club enough to meet me mayhem, he almost told clay to run when Jax asked his help in nailing down clay, and his last chance at redemption was to kill that girl (which was horrible of Jax) and not tell Nero. He told Nero. He was not loyal to Jax, I have said before, juice was loyal to whoever had a gun to his head. Nero was the most stable role model Jax had and he almost lost him because juice was untrustworthy.  So it was a big deal that he told Nero. Also- he went on to do the most sinister betrayal by protecting Gemma when she killed Tara and murdering Eli, and in doing so creating a lie which got all the girls at deosa killed, bobby tortured and eventually caused Jax to kill himself.  Haha I wasn't a massive fan of juice towards the end!  That's my outlook on it! :)"
Sonsofanarchy,34zypd,AllAboutTheFairytale,6,Tue May 5 23:57:34 2015 UTC,"the CGI was just terrible   Overwhelming majority opinion   Bobby was the voice of reason and in S7 he just sort of said ""screw it"" and was OK with going full bore violent.   You can only poke a dog with a stick so many times before its going to snap and bite   I just didn't think Juice telling Nero he killed that girl was a big deal   It was in that it was the final straw for Nero coming full circle in that he knew Jax could never be trusted because he finally heard it from a sober Juice.  Glad you and your wife enjoyed the series. Welcome to the Clubhouse!  'Come Join The Murder'  a."
Sonsofanarchy,34zypd,RatchetChavez,1 point,Wed May 6 01:41:53 2015 UTC,"Can't rightly remember the ins and outs myself since it's been a while. But I remember the CGI being really distracting as well. The delivery was absolutely awful. Totally agree that it looked like he was out on a Sunday drive, the pace they were taking. It was noticeable for the latter portion of the ride, but right up towards the end when you get the view from the trucker's perspective, it literally looks as though Jax's bike is barely even moving at all lol.  But the story line was on point, so overall I don't think it's too big of a deal."
Sonsofanarchy,34zypd,RCG213,2,Wed May 6 00:34:09 2015 UTC,It was in slow motion if you look at Milo the trucker.

Sonsofanarchy,34zjx1,besyuziki,2,Wed May 6 01:24:13 2015 UTC,"Where the hell does this scene with Tara come  from? She was  just all supportive of Gemma, kissing Jax in the hospital and now. ...bam! She is questioning her place.  It always seemed awkward to me."
Sonsofanarchy,34zjx1,stacyo72,0,Wed May 6 01:35:39 2015 UTC,"Well think about it, Tara in this entire world of the MC is awkward."
Sonsofanarchy,34zjx1,stacyo72,2,Wed May 6 01:57:08 2015 UTC,"She actually pulls through early in season five. Even with all the shit she goes through in four, when they're hiding out at Diosa, she handles things with Lowen, steps up and handles her shit as Jax's old lady. Same with the end of season three. She jumps right in and gives them a hand. I think she just has a tendency to over think things. Her brain never stops working...to her detriment."
Sonsofanarchy,34zjx1,stacyo72,2,Wed May 6 01:59:42 2015 UTC,"So Chibs blows up, but  he's in luck, Tara the super doc is there and she does what every good trauma doc would do in that situation...she puts her ear to his chest to hear his heartbeat? Doesn't feel for a pulse."

The only problem is getting three people to sit down together and play. My husband and I really enjoyed it, but convincing someone else to play with us will be a challenge from now on.

You play as one of the motorcycle clubs in and around Charming (the One Niners, SOA, the Mayans, etc) and make choices to make money and avoid deadly consequences.  There is also an expansion for the game that adds an additional player (the Grimm Brothers) for a total of 5.   I bought it at a convention but it looks like you can buy it at Walmart   I've heard from my gamer friends who've played it that it is a great game whether your like to show or not, and it captures the show really well. It's from the makers of the board game Firefly, so you know it's got to be good."

Sonsofanarchy,34twy2,Ruben625,12,Mon May 4 15:07:53 2015 UTC,"I hated it also. The sink was full of water goes back to the beginning of the episode when Gemma was doing dishes.  Keep in mind, Gemma just hit Tara in the face with an iron, so I don't think Tara had a lot of fight in her.  It was so stupid for anyone to leave Tara alone and even more stupid that no one told Gemma that Tara was not a rat.  Stupid mis-communication..the fact that Jax was not in touch with Gemma was really just unbelievable."
Sonsofanarchy,34twy2,bebito79,19,Mon May 4 15:55:40 2015 UTC,You could probably argue the entire show happened because of stupid miscommunication.

Sonsofanarchy,34twy2,asstasticbum,3,Tue May 5 15:46:38 2015 UTC,"That is true I had forgotten about the iron, I thought she had hit her in the side. Still have a problem with the sink being full. Everyone drains it. And how in the hell after everything, does Gemma STILL have a key to the house. Granted all of taras lies came out but the restraining order would still be in effect and they would have immediately taken the key away....idk the fact that they killed Tara is w/e but how they did it felt very last minute written.."
Sonsofanarchy,34twy2,MerrisAwesome,4,Mon May 4 16:11:58 2015 UTC,.....I don't drain it...  I leave my sink water sitting so dishes can soak until I change the water to wash dishes again that evening. It saves us water by not turning on the water to rinse every dish as they're being used.

Sonsofanarchy,34rlq0,RWJ1985,15,Sun May 3 23:28:24 2015 UTC,"Let's take a look at some of the members:   Jax and Opie were born into the lifestyle.  They were raised around the club and never knew anything else.    Bobby's dad did the books for the mob, meaning that he was also raised around a life of crime.    Chibs was involved with the IRA.    Tig is a psychopath.  It's not like he can go work a 9-5.    Juice isn't all that bright, and comes from a low income broken home.  For him the sense of family is enough.    Happy was born riding a Harley and then promptly disemboweled the doctor.    What I'm trying to say here is that these guys didn't exactly come from stable upbringings and then choose to join the club."
Sonsofanarchy,34rlq0,DrWhoisOverRated,3,Mon May 4 03:50:36 2015 UTC,Thanks for the reply. This kind of clarifies the narrative behind their motivations; they just seems like really really bad at being criminals.
Sonsofanarchy,34rlq0,DrWhoisOverRated,2,Mon May 4 04:32:51 2015 UTC,They were just in way over their heads.

Sonsofanarchy,34rlq0,Acpt7567,4,Mon May 4 02:40:07 2015 UTC,They made a decent living in the beginning but had a lot of setbacks. It isn't a guaranteed steady pay but pay's good when you do.
Sonsofanarchy,34rlq0,Oakroscoe,2,Mon May 4 03:38:27 2015 UTC,"Running guns for the Irish allowed them to pay for/own the clubhouse and the TM property.  When the money is good for them, it's really good.  But, as a generalization, these guys aren't exactly good at saving money or budgeting.  And as the other poster said, their earning potential from a straight life isn't exactly that high.  When opie was trying to go straight in the earlier seasons, he wasn't exactly rolling in dough."

Sonsofanarchy,34rlq0,UsedAnalBead,2,Mon May 4 13:55:47 2015 UTC,"They're outlaws. They choose a life outside of ""normal"" and live around people with a similar mindset the same way most gangs do. The first 9 were Vietnam vets iirc and started the MC after getting back to the states after the war. It's pretty obvious Kurt Sutter based it off real life MC's which have similar startup stories. Vets often had no where to go so they would buy a bike which equals freedom, they get together with other people with bikes and form clubs, clubs decide they have enough people to start running guns or drugs and make money and soon enough you have an organized crime operation. Also their name implies the club was founded on anarchist ideals which is why they're so anti government and self sufficent."

Correct me if I'm wrong but doesn't Wendy have a conversation with Brooke about the reality of dating a member? Anyway that was my take on it, I didn't expect it to go anywhere I just saw it as more evidence that the lifestyle corrupts."
Sonsofanarchy,34qmkj,Abandoninghope,6,Sun May 3 20:09:13 2015 UTC,"I accept that. I guess by episode 10 of season 7 that point was driven home pretty well. Seemed like overkill at that point, which is why I thought there might have been another reason for it."

He was such a funny, fun loving guy in season 1, and you could just see him get more and more crushed with each season. Jax put too much on him, although Juice had to have known what that life could be when he signed up.  And he should've trusted the club instead of ratting, but he was in a bad spot. Doesn't Jax promise him a quick death when he confesses and he doesn't even get that? Yeah, it was brutal."

Sonsofanarchy,34n5fv,Thiky,8,Sat May 2 19:38:43 2015 UTC,Juice was always my favorite. He had his own demons and he wasn't exactly right for the club but he needed them. They were his family. I felt his death was both justified and horribly sad. I cried for far longer than I'd like to admit. He was the reason I watched the show. At least he got his pie.
Sonsofanarchy,34n5fv,JeSebella,12,Sat May 2 18:16:59 2015 UTC,He killed a brother and tried to kill himself!

Juice was a victim, had he been in bobby's shoes he would have gave the club up. He was loyal to whoever had a gun to his head. I thought he was a brilliant character but he deserved to die. Tara did nothing to him, and he covered her murder as much as Gemma did resulting in bobby and Jax's death, along with all the deosa girls and loads of other people!  Otto was never a rat until the club wronged him and he suffered far more than juice!  Juice got off lightly. His death was quick and he got to finish his pie!"

Sonsofanarchy,34n5fv,some_dunkaroos,2,Sun May 3 04:07:23 2015 UTC,"I won't get into whether or not Juice deserved to go out like that, but I'll chip in that it is, in fact, how he wanted to go out.  First off, he went out serving the club. He made it very clear throughout the last season that the MC meant everything to him and that he would do anything for the club. He may not have gone out in their good graces, but for himself he knew that he was doing something that could benefit the club.  While he was tortured beforehand by being turned into a prison pitch, the literal manner of his death - the quick shanking to the death - was how he wanted to go out. When he was high at Diosa and told Nero about killing Darvany, he said something along the lines of, ""I made it quick though. That's how I want to go out: quick."""

On that note I want to make you aware of one thing: The only season in which spoiler tags are required for is season 7.  The only reason I mention this as since season 7 was just released on Netflix (April 25th) there has been a significant uptick in Brothers and Old Ladies here so be cautious and simply be aware you may see spoilers for anything less than season 7.   As we all agree you are more than welcome here as often and frequently as everyone, but as a die hard fan on my end I just wanted to make you aware of that since you specifically state you just started the series and even strongly stated:   please god no spoilers.   You are coming up on what many will consider the ""meat and potatoes"" of the series so you might want to check the hell out of here until season 2 is over and then pop back in if you do not want any spoilers.  Welcome again to the Clubhouse!  'Come Join The Murder'  a."

Sonsofanarchy,34fzid,unspeakable16,6,Fri May 1 00:59:24 2015 UTC,Guess the whole no spoiler thing flew over your head
Sonsofanarchy,34egmw,DogsBestMan,13,Thu Apr 30 14:05:21 2015 UTC,"The other presidents knew that Jax would handle his shit and that one way or another he would die; which is what the Mayhem Vote is all about with the exception of another patched member not killing him.  They knew Jax fucked up but also respected him as JT's son, did not want the Mother Charter to fold, start a vengeance war on the other charters and so on.   The shooting of Happy IMO was largely done for the audience as /u/TerramuggusHolmes stated and as Jax said earlier in the episode he did not want to be looked at in the light of JT and the hero / face / legacy of SoA as a whole; specifically by his sons hence why he burned everything possible that could be ""paper trailed"" back to him. As the years will eventually go by, the stories will trickle down to Abel and Thomas about their father being a coward and running away from his fate. Jax wanted them to know that he was not someone to respect, to look up to, not a good person, should not be idolized as he was at the time of his death and by having none of his nor JTs writings around to show hard evidence he knew (as we all know from our own life experiences and the telling of history) as time passes stories become muddied and change constantly.  Regardless of what Abel and Thomas are told and by whom there will always be that lingering doubt and confusion on what they chose to believe based on how and whom they heard it from. It will be up to each to decide how to look back at their father as the only blood that is left is Abel to Wendy - so perhaps Gemma was not far off at all when she was rambling to ""Tara"" while driving about Abel's fate being sealed, but not Thomas'  a."
Sonsofanarchy,34egmw,asstasticbum,10,Thu Apr 30 14:48:20 2015 UTC,I thought the ending of the show was as close to perfect as it could get. Usually when it comes to the end of a TV series the finale leaves me feeling utterly disappointed. The only 2 that haven't done this for me were SoA and Breaking Bad. The ending of the show was somewhat poetic (as lame as that sounds) and I tip my hat to Sutter on a job well done.
Sonsofanarchy,34egmw,dbers92,4,Thu Apr 30 16:53:58 2015 UTC,"Yea I liked it well enough. As much of an ""everything gets tied up rather neatly"" situation as it was, any less convenient or more violently tragic ending would have felt weird and forced. I was more pointing out something that felt less fully thought out/remarking on all the people who wanted an even ""HAPPIER"" ending.  The only happier ending I would have accepted is if everything focused on Happy. That would've been the true Happy ending."
Sonsofanarchy,34egmw,Chastain86,4,Thu Apr 30 17:03:34 2015 UTC,"Sure, the leaders of the other SAMCRO charters would know the story that Redwood was feeding them was flimsy -- but with Jax gone, there'd really be no need to investigate further.  Guilty party is punished, and there's little reason to try to dissolve Redwood in the wake of it.  Given the circumstances of the past, it's probable that the other charters view ANY stories that come out of Redwood with one raised eyebrow.  Redwood has lost two consecutive presidents to corruption and a Mayhem vote.  So yeah, they'll probably know that Jax orchestrated the escape and the other members were complicit -- but with no proof, AND no need to investigate further, everyone will probably go back to business-as-usual.  Whatever THAT looks like."
Sonsofanarchy,34egmw,Chastain86,3,Thu Apr 30 15:06:29 2015 UTC,"I suppose I can see that, although if it were me, I would at least want to address the fact that Redwood's members were complicit. As you said, they've lost two consecutive presidents to corruption. To find out the other members failed to perform the duties of the mayhem decision out of loyalty to their ""golden boy"" and instead trusted him to commit suicide (which only makes sense to us viewers) would just make me question Redwood. How can anyone besides the viewer truly have known Jax would go through with the suicide?   I don't mean to say I think the other charters WOULD or SHOULD act. But if corruption is an issue with the Redwood charter and the members seem complicit with it when the other option is to go against their own, I'd be concerned if I were any member of the other charters. I think it leaves the MC worse off. It makes Redwood as a whole much like like the Tellers. It could very well be a never ending cycle of corruption that one day WILL need to be abruptly ended."
Sonsofanarchy,34egmw,RCG213,5,Thu Apr 30 16:52:56 2015 UTC,"What you're describing would actually make one HELL of a great mini-series follow-up, should Sutter ever decide to revisit the universe in the future.  Seeing how Chibs and Tig address the pressure being put on their club by the other charters, and how being the ""Redwood Original"" charter doesn't entirely protect them from the prying eyes of the others.  Could be a nice lead-in story ahead of introducing the newest member of the club... an 18 year-old Abel."
Sonsofanarchy,34egmw,TerramuggusHolmes,1 point,Thu Apr 30 18:37:54 2015 UTC,After Sutter is finished with The Bastard Executioner it looks like he will be revisiting the SoA universe. There are rumors of a show about the First 9 in the works.
Sonsofanarchy,34egmw,RCG213,3,Thu May 14 16:12:41 2015 UTC,Much like the scene where they act out shooting Happy. I think much of this was done for the viewers. It wouldn't be nearly as interesting if not for that..

She couldn't face the mess she caused, just like always, and put the blame on someone else to cover her own ass. She knew what would happen as a result, she just didn't give a shit, cause she knew she'd be safe from any blame. It's why that shot of her dead and alone is so powerful to me, cause at the end of the day she cared for herself, despite her ""need"" for a family. It wasn't her being a dumbass, it was her manipulating situations to save her own ass, not caring for the repercussions it will bring on her son. It's why Gemma was the true antagonist of the show for me, because she forced Jax into this life, and she ultimately caused him to kill himself at the end of the day imo."

Sonsofanarchy,34e99d,bwsmg718,-1,Sat May 2 00:38:16 2015 UTC,Season Six Ep. 9  She's Brooke's Mother! Go back to the episode where Jax confronts Gary Putner about Brooke smashing the window at Scoops. Jax sees a picture of Gary and his wife Emily. Jax says she looks familiar! Gary says she died in a car accident! Emily was in the accident that JT caused. Gary said Emily had mental issues!  She didn't die in the accident.
Sonsofanarchy,34e99d,GoD_JD244TIME,6,Fri May 1 16:37:10 2015 UTC,She is definitely dead. She is in Ireland in the mall area when Jax tracks down Able. I don't think an alive homeless person with mental disabilities that roams the streets is getting a passport and following Jax to Ireland.

Sonsofanarchy,34d1i6,slappyslug,5,Thu Apr 30 10:56:11 2015 UTC,"You know, I LOVED this finale but I couldn't help think that it was cheap. The writers tricked us. Up until that point, and after that point we are always in the know of what the club is planning. We see all these conversations. Then they just ""happened"" to leave out this conversation where they made up the plan, just for shock effect."
Sonsofanarchy,34d1i6,GonzoHST,3,Thu Apr 30 06:25:30 2015 UTC,"The best kind of trick ending is one where you can look back at the story and say ""my god, it was there the whole time and I didn't see it coming!""

Sonsofanarchy,34d1i6,Cerberus73,1 point,Thu Apr 30 11:29:47 2015 UTC,I agree I like to go back and see the subtle hints but I think the lack of them in this situation made it that much more shocking when they all started laughing in the truck and everything fell into place
Sonsofanarchy,34d1i6,Trooper_Super,3,Thu Apr 30 15:25:56 2015 UTC,"Maybe looking back after a few weeks I can agree with you, but the relief at finding out they were still brothers outweighed any tricks they might have played on us in my mind"
Sonsofanarchy,34d1i6,Wh1t3R4bbi7,2,Thu Apr 30 12:14:11 2015 UTC,"See I disagree. Yes this is the first time the writers left us out of the loop, but if you go back and watch the season again they hint at it throughout and it's not fairly obvious but you can figure it out."
Sonsofanarchy,34hnbk,Blueskymoon,12,Fri May 1 05:57:24 2015 UTC,Gemma had open heart surgery. She mentions it to the truck driver that gives her a ride up to her death.   Really? You wanted to actually see JAX die?? I don't think I could have taken seeing him go head on into that truck. Fuck that. Also terrible CGI is terrible.
Sonsofanarchy,34hnbk,TailWaterBluez,-1,Fri May 1 06:15:35 2015 UTC,I do remember her saying that to the trucker but for some reason I thought she was lying. I mean they could have changed the way he died instead of the truck and showed it and yes that would have been gruesome but I wouldn't expect anything less.
Sonsofanarchy,34hnbk,TailWaterBluez,0,Fri May 1 06:36:26 2015 UTC,I kind of Wanted chibs to kill him. Would have been awesomely dramatic.
Sonsofanarchy,34hnbk,zjbrickbrick,3,Mon May 4 23:12:44 2015 UTC,"Idk, I enjoyed her but yea, lack of facial expressions.  You were not the only one. I don't think he looked more black at all.  Looked more on the Hispanic side to me, about the same as Juice.  Idk about the hair, but she was a junkie for a while which would lead her to looking older. I think Sutter is leaving the flashbacks to the new Original 9 series.  There were a few snapshots of the past though like when Tara was standing behind Jax at the head of the table, it quickly flashed back to Gemma and John I think. She has mentioned a few times about her open heart surgery. I wanna say that he died of heart complications when he was a baby? Fuck Unser. I think she had to be made a doctor to fill some plot stories. If she was a normal nurse, getting her hand smashed to the point she couldn't perform surgery wouldn't have been as big of a deal.  Idk if it was ever explained, but I think it was fine the way he went out, aside from the crappy CGI.  He went out how he wanted to and he was finally happy and willing to accept his fate. I agree, but I think they should have killed Clay off way sooner.  It was too drawn out throughout the series. I would've liked it if they talked more instead of I broke you out of prison, Blam."
Sonsofanarchy,34hnbk,zjbrickbrick,1 point,Fri May 1 12:35:21 2015 UTC,Yea o agree with the clay situation. He should have died wayyy sooner. Especially after all that stuff he caused.  And I had no idea there will be a new series. I have to look that up! Thanks!

Sonsofanarchy,34hnbk,AllAboutTheFairytale,3,Fri May 1 16:45:02 2015 UTC,"Gemma's scar was from a heart surgery. She had heart issues, which ran in her family. Jax had a brother with the same heart condition. His name was Thomas, and he died because of it when they were kids. Someone can correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe Abel has it as well, and it was corrected when he had all those surgeries when he was first born.   The only other answer I have for you is about Wayne. He thought if he could get Gemma far enough away, he could protect her from the club, I think. He loved her so much, he at least had to try.   I'm in the same boat as you about Wendy's hair. I have so much hair envy for Drea De Matteo"
Sonsofanarchy,34hnbk,asstasticbum,3,Fri May 1 06:28:10 2015 UTC,"Jax has the same heart condition too, Jemma mentions it in one of the first episodes when she is trying to make him go and see Abel, something to the effect of ""you had that same heart condition when you were a tiny baby and look at you- I didn't give up on you"". Jax having it is never mentioned again though, but Jemma had it, she had a sibling that died of the heart condition aswell, Nathaniel, which is where Jax got his middle name. And little Abel had it. I think it skipped little Thomas, he was never mentioned as having it."

Sonsofanarchy,349ewi,La_Fille_de_Phenix,11,Wed Apr 29 15:13:33 2015 UTC,It made me realize on the similarities on both Jax and JT. The fact that Gemma had a direct hand in how both molded them into the men they were and their ends. I'd love to think the boys will end up different cause Gemma won't be there to influence them lol.
Sonsofanarchy,349ewi,Mishiiee,9,Wed Apr 29 15:16:12 2015 UTC,"I agree with this completely. Just finished the series, and totally believe Gem was the downfall of JT and Jax."
Sonsofanarchy,349ewi,iAmMitten1,8,Wed Apr 29 20:53:41 2015 UTC,Gemma is the root of all the bad things that happened to everyone in SoA.
Sonsofanarchy,349ewi,tragicallywhite,2,Wed Apr 29 23:50:35 2015 UTC,"Just like Maureen said: Well, Gemma, if you wouldn't chew up men like a meat grinder..."
Sonsofanarchy,349ewi,shouldbeworking23,2,Thu Apr 30 03:18:42 2015 UTC,"all the lies got the best of him... i don't think he allowed it, he just fell for her lies"
Sonsofanarchy,349ewi,Slanderpanic,5,Wed Apr 29 19:55:08 2015 UTC,What this season made me realize the most is how much I'd love to see a Wendy/Nero roadtrip comedy.
Sonsofanarchy,349ewi,Viziondfc,6,Thu Apr 30 00:10:30 2015 UTC,Everything after Clay's demise was Jax's fault.  He was a terrible person that showed signs of being able to do the right thing from time to time.  They were ALL anti hero's even his kid was turning into that already.  He offed himself to end the cycle... The problem is its a 1% MC club in that world and it didn't end when he died it just got a different head on the snake kind of thing.
Sonsofanarchy,349ewi,lilmonkey99,-8,Wed Apr 29 16:08:03 2015 UTC,"I find it amusing how you start with ""Jax killing that Chinese guy""  But then finish with ""This really made me hate Gemma.""   I mean, I get the Gemma hate. But it's not like she was mind controlling Jax to do her bidding. He did all that on his own. Give credit where credit is due. Jax was NOT a ""good guy""."
Sonsofanarchy,349ewi,lilmonkey99,22,Wed Apr 29 10:30:22 2015 UTC,It's all Gemma's fault. Her lying about the Chinese ruined everything.
Sonsofanarchy,349ewi,King_Kthulhu,-7,Wed Apr 29 10:34:56 2015 UTC,"She lied, she murdered Tara, she is a bad person. But she didn't force Jax's hand. He did that on his own. ""Well if she didn't lie he wouldn't have killed those people"" yep. And if he wasn't a ""criminal and a killer"" he wouldn't have either.   You can't place all the blame on Gemma and none on Jax. He's love able yes, I get that. I loved him too. But he's not an innocent man and even he knew that."
Sonsofanarchy,349ewi,lilmonkey99,9,Wed Apr 29 10:54:52 2015 UTC,"I dont know.. im sure there are plenty of people who arnt ""criminals and killers"" who would have done the same sadistic shit to the man they thought brutally murdered their wife."
Sonsofanarchy,349ewi,King_Kthulhu,3,Wed Apr 29 13:49:56 2015 UTC,"And they would be wrong too.  What about Jury?  Is that all Gemma's fault too?  I'm not saying the woman is a saint, I'm just saying that some of the blame has to be put on the person who actually did the torturing/murdering.  Especially since, like OP said, he didn't even let the guy speak."
Sonsofanarchy,349ewi,meh_apathy,1 point,Wed Apr 29 14:10:19 2015 UTC,"Jax is a murderer and a criminal, but that was probably one of the only justified murders in the series.. wel it would have been if the guy actually did it."
Sonsofanarchy,349ewi,lilmonkey99,2,Wed Apr 29 15:00:22 2015 UTC,"If my mother told me she saw the person who killed my wife and went as far as to identify the person, I would probably take her word for it and go blind with rage.  Gemmas actions resulted in like 90% of the deaths this season."
Sonsofanarchy,347gvr,stacyo72,4,Tue Apr 28 22:20:51 2015 UTC,"A little out of context for SoA - but it fits...  If you having girl problems I feel bad for you SON  Alright kids, lets do it, LET'S RIDE!! PRES PLAY!!"

Sonsofanarchy,347gvr,TinaIsKillingItSOA11,3,Wed Apr 29 00:58:01 2015 UTC,I do love this Jax and Tara scene!  The moment Tara clicks that she's his old lady!
Sonsofanarchy,347gvr,stacyo72,3,Wed Apr 29 01:03:51 2015 UTC,I love how it just dawns on her. You see the lightbulb go off.
Sonsofanarchy,347gvr,AllAboutTheFairytale,2,Wed Apr 29 01:04:36 2015 UTC,I know... I loved the Jax and Tara relationship. I was rooting for them from the first episode!!

Sonsofanarchy,347gvr,AllAboutTheFairytale,2,Wed Apr 29 01:11:46 2015 UTC,"Yes, yes he is. In have a fantastic pic of him on my desktop at work. It's actually distracting at times.n"

Sonsofanarchy,347gvr,AllAboutTheFairytale,3,Wed Apr 29 01:20:02 2015 UTC,My Skype pic as you know is. But a little more on the grim side than what I think you ladies are referring to.
Sonsofanarchy,347gvr,stacyo72,3,Wed Apr 29 01:24:38 2015 UTC,"""I'm your old lady."" Dream big Doc, dream, big."
Sonsofanarchy,347gvr,AllAboutTheFairytale,3,Wed Apr 29 01:05:42 2015 UTC,Fuck you Opie.  Jax is just worried about you.
Sonsofanarchy,347gvr,stacyo72,3,Wed Apr 29 01:06:01 2015 UTC,Opie seriously needs to get fucking laid.

Sonsofanarchy,33z7cq,mxpower,13,Mon Apr 27 01:33:37 2015 UTC,Having been with a club for years and know 100's of 'bikers' I dont believe any of them would beat your ass for wearing that. Depending on the place. If your gonna wear that anywhere... remove that MC and you should be at least a bit safer.
Sonsofanarchy,33z7cq,Koars,25,Mon Apr 27 03:18:21 2015 UTC,Recently left an MC. Can honestly say there are plenty of bikers stupid enough to take offence at the MC patch and the California bottom rocker. Just a heads up.
Sonsofanarchy,33z7cq,just_a_turd,1 point,Mon Apr 27 03:53:50 2015 UTC,Why would they take offense to that?
Sonsofanarchy,33z7cq,Koars,13,Mon Apr 27 06:12:24 2015 UTC,"MC implies that you're a club obviously, many people work hard and even die trying to earn their way in.   The bottom rocker marks your territory. That is the one many clubs will take offence over. Don't believe me? Just research the Mongols MC and The Hell's Angels MC feud. All over the California bottom rocker."
Sonsofanarchy,33z7cq,just_a_turd,6,Mon Apr 27 06:37:49 2015 UTC,Makes sense now. If you don't mind me asking why did you recently leave an MC?
Sonsofanarchy,33z7cq,Koars,0,Mon Apr 27 06:59:45 2015 UTC,They cared too much about making money and being outlaws then actually having a brotherhood. So me and some other guys left and there's talk of starting a new better club. Real fucked up situation. Lots of hot headed idiots to deal with.

Sonsofanarchy,33z7cq,rigel2112,7,Sat May 16 03:17:01 2015 UTC,It's a joke but needs to be said in every thread with one of these.   Do NOT wear in public and don't even think of getting on a bike with one.    It's never a good idea to disrespect any street gang or MC if you value your life and some people may not realize it.

Check out this about the Black Label Society fake MC patches from their own site:  The British based BLS tribute band Sonic Brew, and the owner of the UKSDMF forum have been in contact with the two leading British MC’s, Hells Angels and Outlaws. Both MC’s have been extremely helpful, patient and courteous in this matter. They have made it clear that they have nothing against UK BLS fans, and have no wish for any conflict with us (what a relief). Their issue is solely with the patches and BLS insignia. They have made it clear that should they see anyone wearing them, they WILL remove them and confiscate them. Therefore it is strongly advised that no one in the UK should be seen either wearing or displaying BLS back or front patches, or any T shirts or other clothing displaying BLS insignia until the situation is resolved. Doing so will only put oneself at risk and inflame the situation even further. Thank you for reading. Stay safe.  http://www.blacklabelsociety.net/f-a-q/"

Sonsofanarchy,3404ly,Rustyshackleford313,18,Mon Apr 27 06:17:46 2015 UTC,Theo Rossi definitely became one of the highlights of the show for me. His performance in the last few episodes is heartbreaking.
Sonsofanarchy,3404ly,JerFTW,11,Mon Apr 27 10:33:14 2015 UTC,"Agreed.  I was never a huge Juice fan.  I always found him to be weak and inconsequential vs the other members.  Then, when I look at Juice's character development and storylines throughout the entire series I am really impressed with Theo Rossi and his performances.  Especially season 7.  Juice is another character, like Otto, that suffered horribly for the club and the other members never really acknowledge it.  Yes, I know Juice was not innocent (Miles, stealing the coke, working with Roosevelt and Potter, and later Alvarez), but in the end I felt for him.  No family other than the club and then shut out by them as well.  Nowhere/no one to turn to."
Sonsofanarchy,3404ly,Fanfabulous,9,Mon Apr 27 11:07:28 2015 UTC,"I just started binge watching episodes 1-5 of S7 now that it hit Netflix, and wanted to make exactly this same thread. First time seeing s7.  Holy shit I'm disappointed so far, is all I can say at this point - I'll finish the series because I have way too much invested in it at this point. But yeah, do they really need to try this hard to get me to hate Jax?   For a modern day ""Shakespearean"" tragedy, I'd feel much more for Jax being killed off in the end if he was actually trying to be a better man this season. It's just so out of character again, especially after he redeemed himself on the s6 finale.   It's obvious we're supposed to hate Gemma, fine by me, she's earned it. But Jax? AT least for the first 6 seasons, he opposed Clay by being the guy who said ""slow down, let's think this through first"", now it's pop off vengeance killings.  Which brings me to my other gripe - Bobby is completely silent this season on all of this (so far, just 5 episodes in), but we know how out of character this is for him to just let Jax fly off the handle like this. I guess we're supposed to believe his character just doesn't give a shit anymore about trying to be the voice of reason? For that matter, it's like the entire freaking club has become robots, they don't question or care one way or the other, Jax's orders, and he just lost his wife, they'll let their beloved president do whatever he wants. That being said, they're all tired of the infighting and previous factioning in their club, but they (all club members) have absolutely zero screentime to express any doubt whatsoever, whether that's intentional or not, I don't know. All the screentime is purely on Jax/business, Gemma/Juice/Wendy/Unser, and the occasional Chibs/Tig. Thank God Nero is still Nero."
Sonsofanarchy,3404ly,Cassial,2,Mon Apr 27 15:07:49 2015 UTC,Bobbys sudden change of character is what ruined this season for me. He was always the voice of reason.
Sonsofanarchy,3404ly,JaxTeller718,2,Mon Apr 27 18:45:38 2015 UTC,the justification for Bobby's silence is Gemma's lie. Chinese killed Tara.
Sonsofanarchy,3404ly,Shanjayne,1 point,Thu Apr 30 10:37:33 2015 UTC,Exactly right. If Bobby didn't think The Chinese killed Tara season 7 would have been him and Jax fighting like clay and Jax used to. But he thinks the Chinese did it so when Jax goes on a killing spree Bobby thinks it's for a good reason so he doesn't say a word.
Sonsofanarchy,3404ly,Trooper_Super,15,Thu Apr 30 16:15:29 2015 UTC,"To answer your question:  yes, you are supposed to hate Jax and Gemma.  At least I did.  I was really rooting for Jax up until season 5 when he ambushed Wendy and gave her the drugs.  Even then, there was still a little part of me that said he would get his act together and figure things out.  But by the season 6 premiere, I knew he wouldn't.  Gemma, for me, started out as the typical meddlesome mother, poking her nose in her son's business.  But suddenly season 5 Gemma just became over the top for me.    Poor Abel--I would be emotionless too if I were him.  Born premature, addicted to drugs, medical complications.  Kidnapped, taken to Belfast.  Saw the clubhouse blown up, taken to porn studio and Diosa instead of having playdates with kids his own age."

He's not abusive or anything, but he does seem to be a bit absent and feeling guilty about it.   (And I'm not saying that he's a bad parent for putting his son in a care facility.

Sonsofanarchy,33yzfw,EasyPrinter,4,Tue Apr 28 20:29:02 2015 UTC,"Spoilers:  Honestly, I got the impression that Nero was just reluctant to give up his life and go be a full-time country-dad. It's not like when he decided to take off with the kids he was overcome with angst about spending time with Lucius- he was just finally really sick of his life as a pimp. He (and Jax) mention feeling like they were irresponsible 'fathers' before their kids were born, and to regret their kids' illnesses. But they don't seem pained when they actually see their kids.   I understand wanting to have a life beyond your kids (heck it's a good thing- Gemma's excessive focus on her life as a mom is the source of a lot of her screwups), but I feel like he wasn't totally comfortable with that, hence the long delays and lies. Jax and Nero both have issues with making grand plans to rescue their kids and take them off to a better life, where they'll be better dads. But they definitely drag their feet about it, and don't like to admit it.   I like Nero, but I don't think it's really accurate to portray him as 'no bull shit', he's got his own issues. They're just more parallel to Jax's issues than tangled up together with them."

Sonsofanarchy,33st0z,CatherineWright89,2,Sat Apr 25 13:37:11 2015 UTC,"Its only bad if its bad that I am on episode 4 right now, its just about over, I skipped most of episode 1 and I have seen all of season 7 about 5 times since the original broadcast.  So /u/TinaIsKillingItSOA11 - I won't judge ;)  Get some sleep girl!  a."
Sonsofanarchy,33st0z,CatherineWright89,2,Sat Apr 25 14:37:10 2015 UTC,"Haha, I've watched it 4 times since the original broadcast."
Sonsofanarchy,33st0z,Alwaysthequiet1,3,Mon Apr 27 15:56:25 2015 UTC,Does anyone know when it comes out on Netflix UK? Me and my mate have been waiting all week for a marathon!
Sonsofanarchy,33st0z,ICameBack4uSaul,3,Sat Apr 25 18:41:25 2015 UTC,"I watch them on netflix. Season 1-6 is currently on uk netflix, I'm not sure when season 7 will be on it, but the first six seasons should keep you going!  I got the DVD of season seven- it's £19.99 in Hmv or on amazon :)  I am in the uk so the rewatches are at 2am- but it's worth it! It's like the therapy I needed when I watched it the first time haha! Enjoy the ride! :)"
Sonsofanarchy,33st0z,pretentiously,2,Sat Apr 25 20:05:02 2015 UTC,I do not but you can always get an extension for Chrome that will give you access to UK Netflix.  Almost positive that /u/CatherineWright89 is in the UK and she does the rewatches with us. Not positive if she uses an extension or not. Might want to shoot her a PM and ask.
Sonsofanarchy,33st0z,camimiele,2,Sat Apr 25 19:16:38 2015 UTC,"If you use chrome, check out the extension called ""Zenmate"". It's a proxy extension that allows you to access sites in another country. Prime example here being Netflix. Looks like this. I use it all the time to watch American netflix with /u/Asstasticbum. If you don't use chrome or for some reason it doesn't work, just PM me and I'll help you out."
Sonsofanarchy,33st0z,sma92176us,3,Sat Apr 25 19:52:20 2015 UTC,Ahh- I watch mine on a roku box- I'll have a look if I can access us Netflix on that- but I'm not sure if it works from a roku!
Sonsofanarchy,33st0z,Daspin93,2,Sat Apr 25 20:26:09 2015 UTC,Ahh I see. Best of luck to you then!
Sonsofanarchy,33st0z,woozi_11six,3,Sat Apr 25 20:51:53 2015 UTC,Welp looks like I'm gonna be glued to the tv for the next month.  Gonna start from the beginning all over again.

Sonsofanarchy,33szi9,Primetastic,15,Sat Apr 25 09:13:35 2015 UTC,"I saw somebody else ask about this a while ago, and somebody commented something the likes of this: the guy behind Clay was used as an extra used in the background as a club member, and during season 2, the directors decided that he looked the part and decided to cast him as the face of John Teller after that."
Sonsofanarchy,33szi9,jdholzum,8,Sat Apr 25 09:44:17 2015 UTC,I think this guy became the face of the JT eventually but it wasn't intentional in this scene. Just a really bad coincidence.
Sonsofanarchy,33szi9,CreepyAbelTeller,2,Sat Apr 25 14:09:04 2015 UTC,"JT had long hair.  Looked kind of like a small fella to me, in the part where he's in the chair and Gemma is behind him.    That's definitely not him."
Sonsofanarchy,33szi9,CSMom74,3,Sat Apr 25 09:36:13 2015 UTC,But it is him http://img2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20141029045350/sonsofanarchy/images/e/e0/John_Teller.png

Sonsofanarchy,33tivw,CreepyAbelTeller,3,Sat Apr 25 14:07:19 2015 UTC,"Doing a job, and claiming to have that job/being listed as performing a job are two different things. I wouldn't have been shocked to find out that the Sons of Anarchy gave some superficial job title to a member's wife in an attempt to look out for her- it could have been an attempt to make it easier to funnel money to her regularly, especially once she split up with Jax.   Or it could have been a genuine attempt to give her a job that she eventually just flaked on, that later just became a purely superficial title. OR it could have been a former job that she put down on paperwork because. . . well, it feels kind of bad to write 'unemployed' on paperwork."
Sonsofanarchy,33tivw,CSMom74,0,Sun Apr 26 04:50:54 2015 UTC,"Well, as far as we know the latter would be a lie and when listed on a government-certified document is considered a crime. Drea mentioned in an interview in Season 5 that Wendy was never given a solid backstory, so she made one up. She said that Wendy was probably a dancer and that's where she met Jax and fell in love with him (but she remained a crow eater for some time). I doubt she transitioned into an office manager after that. I do see Gemma trying to make her more ""legit"" just like she pushed Jax into marrying Wendy because she wanted grandchildren."
Sonsofanarchy,33tivw,NullaLexInk,3,Sun Apr 26 14:49:19 2015 UTC,"Well, as far as we know the latter would be a lie and when listed on a government-certified document is considered a crime.   Yes, well we know the Sons of Anarchy, Gemma, and Wendy would never fudge the truth or commit a crime.  lol   Really, it's no big deal.  If it was a tax return, they might care.  A birth certificate doesn't matter when they ask you your occupation.  Florida doesn't even list an occupation.  That's how much it matters."
Sonsofanarchy,33tivw,NullaLexInk,1 point,Mon Apr 27 00:25:35 2015 UTC,"I don't think Wendy was ever a reliable office manager. If she ever actually worked there, I'm sure she was superfluous, and that she was given the job more to help her, and allow people to keep an eye on her, than to help TM.   And if she was holding the job only in name (either because Jax and Gemma were using it in  a way to funnel cash to her, or just because she was embarrassed to say she was unemployed), you're right, it WOULD be a crime. But it'd be a much, much smaller crime than everything else they were getting up to at the beginning of Season 1, honestly I don't think they'd blink an eye at it.   I realize stuff's unconfirmed, this is just speculation on my part. I don't think that a lie on some paperwork in this situation is really a plot hole, even if it was done in error on the writers' parts.   (Also, you're user name is fantastic)"

Gemma's maiden name was Maddock and I think it is or was at one point somewhat common for women to use their former surname as a middle name following marriage."
Sonsofanarchy,33qunu,ICameBack4uSaul,19,Fri Apr 24 19:31:11 2015 UTC,He's a professional actor.
Sonsofanarchy,33qunu,luce860,5,Fri Apr 24 19:50:04 2015 UTC,"I used to like seeing actors on other shows and going ""ooo theres blah from blah"". But now its so common i dont bother noticing."

Sonsofanarchy,33qunu,woozi_11six,1 point,Fri Apr 24 23:56:55 2015 UTC,"There are tons of SOA alumni on Criminal Minds. Off the top of my head, I remember seeing Michael Beach (T.O's actor) as a priest, Rachel Miner (Dawn's actress) as a kidnapping victim, and Mitch Pileggi (Darby's actor) as one of the Unsubs. I think that Jeff Kober (Jacob Hale) was in one of the early episodes as well, also an Unsub.  And of course, Galen and McGee were antagonists in season six, one of the more memorable arcs. I think there's more but that's all I can think of right off.  Yeah, I spend way too much time watching TV."
Sonsofanarchy,33qunu,NullaLexInk,1 point,Sat Apr 25 04:17:45 2015 UTC,That's amazing you can remember all that.
Sonsofanarchy,33qunu,NullaLexInk,1 point,Sat Apr 25 04:24:53 2015 UTC,"Thanks. I have a weird memory capacity for stuff like this. But that's partly because I've watched Criminal Minds like crazy since it was added to Netflix, and since getting into SOA around August 2012 I've been addicted to it. I also remember actor's faces and tics (if they have any) pretty well if they've caught my attention, so that helps."

Sonsofanarchy,33qunu,gizmatic,0,Fri Apr 24 21:27:59 2015 UTC,"There were only a few black people on the show, but I'm not sure who I'm looking at.  I know that its neither the actress that played Fiona Larkin, nor the one that played Rita Roosevelt. Or Neeta. I know its not Neeta."
Sonsofanarchy,33qunu,gizmatic,0,Sat Apr 25 01:08:20 2015 UTC,He was a major character. If you say you've watched this show you should definitely know who that is.
Sonsofanarchy,33qunu,gizmatic,1 point,Sat Apr 25 02:37:24 2015 UTC,"I've watched the show, so I definitely have seen his character if he was on SOA, but I sure as heck don't recognize his face. I'm horrible with faces in real life and damn near hopeless at it watching TV/movies.  Process of elimination tells me that its one of the following guys Damon Pope, T-t-t-tyler, August Marks, Laroy, T.O. or Darrell. I am confident that it isn't Aldo, because he isn't fat, but if that actor lost weight, it could be him.  You said he was a major character, so that means it wouldn't be Darrell or T.O, they were both very minor characters. Laroy was a cool cat, but not a major character...That leaves Damon Pope, T-t-t-tyler or August Marks.  Thats as far as I can get. The actor could have changed his hair, so I can't be sure about his identity any further than that. I mean, yes, I know that is has to be one of them, I just don't know which one and without being able to watch him move around (presuming he's playing the same type of character) and hear him speak, I can NOT recognize him.  I'm not kidding, I don't recognize him. My sister hates watching TV/movies with me because I don't recognize people 99% of the time."
Sonsofanarchy,33micj,MadamGunner,4,Thu Apr 23 18:54:41 2015 UTC,For some reason I thought it didn't come out until the 30th.  Looks like I know what I'll be doing Saturday.

Either that or start doing Google Hangouts on Teller Tuesdays.  We do Google Hangouts every night in /r/centuryclub (ugh, I was up till damn bear 0500 yesterday it was so fucking hilarious - sooooo tired) and we do them in /r/cigars too.

The murder charges on him were dropped most of his inner circle during his presidency were acquitted of murder charges. He is convicted of ""show of force"".

I loved Opie but you will look back on his death -- and while it will remain very sad -- it felt right (unlike some other characters). His time had come. He went out in a very noble way. He was a dead man walking for 3 seasons.
Sonsofanarchy,33e58r,iamjacksbigtoe,1 point,Wed Apr 22 23:21:47 2015 UTC,Just re watched S5E3.  The first time I watched it I was screaming at the tv.  I was pretty pissed watching it again lol Opie was definitely my favorite character hands down
Sonsofanarchy,33e58r,bwsmg718,-2,Fri Apr 24 01:42:05 2015 UTC,"Swear I'll never get the Opie love, I just don't. Makes no sense to me. I get feeling bad for the guy because of all that happened to him, but he wasn't a good actor, wasn't really a great character, just someone that got beat on emotionally throughout the series.   His death was a blessing, he had nothing left to live for."
Sonsofanarchy,33e58r,jckprry,10,Wed Apr 22 00:28:42 2015 UTC,"I thought he was a great actor, but I appreciate your opinion.  You're right that he had nothing left to live for. He never believed he was good for his children, he thought they were better off without him. That's why he eventually attacked the guard and gave his life for the only love he had left: his brothers."
Sonsofanarchy,33e58r,CSMom74,2,Wed Apr 22 04:03:01 2015 UTC,"His death was a blessing, he had nothing left to live for.   You mean other than his two children and his new wife?    Yes, Donna died.  Sad and all.  But he had two children that were still there."

Sonsofanarchy,33e58r,CSMom74,1 point,Sun Apr 26 17:34:11 2015 UTC,"I think people just saw this soft-spoken gentle giant.  Poor Opie, lost his wife for no reason.

Sonsofanarchy,339dd9,Blackjack__21,6,Mon Apr 20 18:14:51 2015 UTC,"It's been a while but iirc, Juice told Chibs but not the rest of the club, so Chibs might be cool with it but that doesn't necessarily mean Jax or any of the others would be. That or Juice has already been working with Potter and he could hold that over his head if the secret about his dad came out any way, so I suppose he might as well see it through and put it behind him."
Sonsofanarchy,339dd9,ZomNoms,3,Mon Apr 20 18:31:07 2015 UTC,"I haven't seen this season in a while, but isn't it because Potter can easily let it slip that he's been ratting? He's caught. He already stole the coke, he already killed Miles. Chibs knows about his father but nobody in the club knows the extent of what he's done."

Sonsofanarchy,339dd9,truthnineseven,2,Wed Apr 22 11:17:41 2015 UTC,"You can't say that facts don't exist, lol. The club had a ""no black allowed"" rule. That's why Juice got baited into ratting.   That's why there were no black members until that Grim Bastards pres patched over at the very end, after Jax had that rule nullified."
Sonsofanarchy,339dd9,-ferrocactus,1 point,Thu Apr 23 06:30:07 2015 UTC,I don't recall the no black rule...
Sonsofanarchy,339dd9,truthnineseven,2,Thu Apr 23 19:29:36 2015 UTC,"It was mentioned in ""With an X"" and it's in the IMDB FAQ.  Juice: ""Do you ever push back against the rules? Some of them are pretty hardcore.""  Chibs: ""Knew what they were when we signed up.""  Juice: ""The black thing ever bother you, with Fiona and all?""   Chibs: ""Fiona was an old lady.""  Juice: ""Yeah, I know, but still.""  Chibs: ""Listen, the rules have been around since day one. Different time. I'm not saying I agree with them all.

Sonsofanarchy,339dd9,therobbo91,1 point,Thu Apr 23 21:47:30 2015 UTC,"So juice, being Hispanic/ Latin, is just a huge gray area?"
Sonsofanarchy,339dd9,truthnineseven,1 point,Fri Apr 24 00:07:02 2015 UTC,"They don't have issues with Hispanics, Jews, etc. Obviously since they know Juice is Hispanic, Bobby is Jewish.

Sonsofanarchy,334911,chrisSOA141,17,Sun Apr 19 11:30:05 2015 UTC,"From my understanding, this was Juice's chance for redemption for everything he did to the club. And he literally had to do two things, kill Darveny and not tell Nero. He failed that, so I feel that it is correct.   But Jax keeping him alive for his own personal reasons is kinda messed up, but he's still the Prez."
Sonsofanarchy,334911,epictylerone808,1 point,Sun Apr 19 11:41:27 2015 UTC,"I get that, but it was more Nero finding out(by a druggie confession) rather than Juice ratting him out, and Jax straight up says that Juice betrayed him, overall i still think everything Juice did wrong(at first at least) wasn't really his fault, the thing with Eli was through blackmail, and with betraying Jax is was because of his accidental overdose, up until this i can't see why Jax wanted him dead(the shit he did afterwards was fucked up though, but again that all started from him being scared) idk i just feel like up until that point jax could have been lighter with juice, covering up Tara's murder and trying to rat on SAMCRO, ok he deserved it there but before that? I think it would have been easier to understand him"
Sonsofanarchy,334911,DkS_FIJI,8,Sun Apr 19 13:09:08 2015 UTC,Lots of other members got pressured worse than Juice and didn't sell out the club. Juice loved SAMCRO but he fucked the club over badly because he couldn't handle when other groups tries to leverage him.
Sonsofanarchy,334911,SideTraKd,4,Sun Apr 19 22:10:32 2015 UTC,"I'm thinking that in their eyes, going soft and turning into a junkie is a betrayal in and of itself.  Revealing club secrets to a non-club member on top of it just multiplies that betrayal.  It's almost worse than if he had done it on purpose."
Sonsofanarchy,334911,epictylerone808,2,Sun Apr 19 21:53:50 2015 UTC,"Okay. I accept that. But, I think he used ""betray"" in that sense is because Jax asked him multiple times if he was okay. And he always said he was fine. But this showed that he was not fine at all,  so he did lie and betray them.   Of course I don't know. But that's my idea/theory.   Quick edit: Juice is my favorite character because he's just put into horrible situations and it's really messed up."
Sonsofanarchy,334911,ClutchRaider,2,Sun Apr 19 13:18:09 2015 UTC,"That was on juice. Chibs said it himself, the blackmail Eli had was NO big deal."
Sonsofanarchy,334911,CatherineWright89,9,Mon Apr 20 01:59:29 2015 UTC,"I may get hated a bit for this but I wasn't a fan of juice. I just thought he was such a victim, and he always had someone to blame for his betrayals. When he was getting threatened, Chibs told him it would be okay if the club found out his dad was black, because it wasn't on his papers, yet he continued to work with the police. He tried to kill himself out of guilt and Jax asked him a few times if he was okay and he said he was, then he tried to kill himself again and in the process almost destroyed Jax's relationship with one of the very few stable, good people in his life. Juice betrayed the club more than anyone and continued to get away with it, and him covering up Tara's murder was by far the most sinister of his betrayals. I liked him towards the end of the last season because he became brave, and regardless of the fact he was victimised a lot in prison, he was more brave and honest than any other season. He told Jax the truth, he ate his pie, then accepted his fate. I respected him for that. But from season three I didn't like juice at all. He definitely wasn't cut out for the MC life, and I think Jax was within his rights to say Juice betrayed him! That's just my thoughts anyways!"
Sonsofanarchy,334911,stacyo72,7,Sun Apr 19 16:59:03 2015 UTC,"Also take into account that wasn't his first fuck up.  Jax was already pissed at juice for trying to kill himself, for helping Clay, the Darveny thing was the straw that broke the camels back."
Sonsofanarchy,334911,therobbo91,6,Sun Apr 19 12:03:24 2015 UTC,"Juice was my favorite character but he betrayed them on multiple occasions (stealing the coke, telling Nero about Darvany, offering to give Alvarez club intel for passage to Mexico, plus helping Gemma).  I know Jax was only referring to the one concerning Nero, but I still think the term applies. Whether he intended to tell Nero or not, he did. He was a liability and couldn't handle his emotions. That's not someone you want in on your illegal activities and deep, dark secrets. I think telling Nero was just the final red flag that Juice could not be trusted with anything. Eventually, the guilt will get to him. There was a long history in the ""you betrayed me"" line. He wasn't cut out for an MC lifestyle. I watched an interview with Theo Rossi and he joked that Juice would be better suited for a job at Blockbuster.  I was disappointed with where they took his character after season 4 and kept hoping he'd pull his head out of his ass, but no happy ending for him seemed about right. One constant in the show is that innocents surrounding the club will be drawn in and played like pawns, and eventually get hurt or worse (Donna, Lyla, Tara, Abel, etc). Another is that your sins will eventually come back around to haunt you. Juice started out in the former category (getting blackmailed by Roosevelt) and then was unlucky enough to experience the latter as well."
Sonsofanarchy,334911,DarknessBrotha,6,Sun Apr 19 15:12:54 2015 UTC,Juice worked with the feds. He's a rat

Sonsofanarchy,334911,CreepyAbelTeller,6,Sun Apr 19 12:38:54 2015 UTC,"Are you referring to Season 3? Jax didn't work with the feds - the club was in on it. They were setting up Stahl. And even in Season 4 and 5, he wasn't feeding the feds information -- they had RICO hanging over their head and he had to play nice with the cartel. Bobby and Chibbs were in on it as well."
Sonsofanarchy,334911,CreepyAbelTeller,5,Sun Apr 19 14:13:41 2015 UTC,"He gave up information while he was high, and after a suicide attempt. This makes him a rat, a junkie, and a suicidal member. SAMCRO hates all three of those things."
Sonsofanarchy,334911,DancingNancy4136,2,Sun Apr 19 16:44:31 2015 UTC,This is actually the best response. Very true.
Sonsofanarchy,334911,truthnineseven,2,Sun Apr 19 21:31:55 2015 UTC,"be·tray bəˈtrā/ verb 1. expose (one's country, a group, or a person) to danger by treacherously giving information to an enemy. ""a double agent who betrayed some 400 British and French agents to the Germans"" 2. unintentionally reveal; be evidence of. ""she drew a deep breath that betrayed her indignation""  I'm not sure why you think that ""betray"" is extreme. It's pretty dead on. Part of his orders were keeping this secret from Nero and he didn't. His state of mind or sobriety don't really matter, he still did exactly what he was asked not to do."
Sonsofanarchy,334911,ACrusaderA,2,Mon Apr 20 04:09:40 2015 UTC,"I think it is a reflection of the irrational unreasonable person Jax has become. Think of it as a snowball that starts small but grows as it is going down the mountain. Killing Darvany was just another poor decision by Jax. He thought when he killed her all loose ends would be tied, it didn't, as time passed the snowball grew, and juice brought Jax's sins to light. Lets not forget juice has done some deplorable things in terms of loyalty to the club I.E working with Eli and killing a member. His hands are not clean. Jax probably thinks it best to off Juice because he is a liability to the club/ jax realizes how mentally unstable Juice is. But at the same time I bet Jax thinks that by killing Juice he can bury a poor decision in the back of his mind and forget it forever."
Sonsofanarchy,334911,CreepyAbelTeller,2,Tue Apr 21 15:15:41 2015 UTC,"1 - It shows how irrational and dangerous Jax has become  2 - It was a pretty big fuck up. Regardless of whether he meant to reveal it or not, it shows that Juice can't be trusted with how much he knows.  3 - It's not the first time Juice has betrayed the club. He also stole a kilo of coke in order to get a sample for the cops and killed loyal member to cover it up just so the club wouldn't find out he was half black."
Sonsofanarchy,334911,hydrosphere13,1 point,Mon Apr 27 03:40:17 2015 UTC,"Juice was working with the feds in Season 4 and while he had few choices, he still went through with it so he was considered a rat by the club. Jax spared him his life in Season 5 and made him help out with the whole Clay setup. So Juice was already on SAMCRO's shit list. The fact that he spilled the beans to Nero - intentional or not - was the final straw. On top of that, he split after the final confrontation with Jax in Season 6, so I feel like that just gave more fuel to the whole ""Juice must die"" fire."
Sonsofanarchy,334911,Wildefriend1,1 point,Sun Apr 19 14:11:49 2015 UTC,Yes Juice betrayed Jax and the club by telling a club secret to a non club member. Doesn't matter if he meant to or not in the outlaw biker world Juice broke an unforgivable sin and needed to die....like a lot.

As for the Christian imagery, yes it was brilliantly done, except for seven seasons we were living a Shakspearean story then all of a sudden it was a Christian parallel. Seemed a little out of nowhere to me. I'd have been much happier to see the two crows bouncing around a piece of the wrecked bike that flew out from the crash or something to that effect."

Chibbs would run the show with Tig as his second in command. Everyone in Charming, including all the other clubs, thinks Jax is dead. The only way Jax makes money and keeps his boys afloat is his small ownership in Diosa. Obviously, his name couldn't be on the business license but Chibbs name would be on it and he would deliver the money to Jax every month or whatever.   Idk, the idea that Jax somehow thought he was ""ruined"" and couldn't even stay alive to raise his boys totally bothers me. It makes me think he was extremely weak minded despite all the strength and intelligence he showed during the show."
Sonsofanarchy,32rvge,supershotalltime,8,Tue Apr 28 16:37:26 2015 UTC,"He was weak minded though. I don't think the show made any attempts at covering that up. This is a man who felt like being an outlaw was the only thing he was good at (and refused to ""live off of his wife"") and chose to stay put in a lifestyle that had killed his father, his best friend and eventually his wife. Instead of walking away after the RICO case died down, he told Tara that he was staying put because he wanted to honor Opie -- which is Jax Teller non-logic at its finest: let me stay in an environment (with my family) that inevitably kills my brothers."
Sonsofanarchy,32rvge,CreepyAbelTeller,3,Thu Apr 16 20:12:36 2015 UTC,"I would have said that instead of Killing Jury he just cuts ties with the indian hills charter due to his anger, and lets say Unser calls the cops before jax gets to the house so she is locked up and jax is deprived of his revenge but he does get to kill Marks and Barofsky just not publicly and so Gemma spends the rest of her life in prison on death row never sees jax or the boys again and Jax finally leads the club into a legit direction."

Sonsofanarchy,32rvge,stacyo72,2,Sun Apr 19 01:48:51 2015 UTC,"I was also rooting for the happy ending. It would have been nice to see Jax finally climb out of the hole and dust himself off.

People come in and write what they want but some of the info on the Wiki is just bull that isn't supported by any official documentation.  Jaxs back story, as supported by the show, is essentially: Born w a heart defect, survived and raised in Charming He grew up with Opie as his buddy from 5yo. He grew up idolizing the MC (wanted a Harley and Kutte from the time that he was 5) Had a younger brother who was sickly and died from the family heart condition. Attended high school but didn't complete it (he and officer Eglee were classmates). His dad died when he was 16. He and Tara were high school sweethearts and lovers. We know that he has a GED, is not a masterful mechanic but okay at auto-repair. He joined the MC at 18/19 years old when Tara left Charming for school."
Sonsofanarchy,32rhxl,gizmatic,10,Thu Apr 16 04:50:29 2015 UTC,"He also went to school with Hale, I think."
Sonsofanarchy,32rhxl,GrimThursday,4,Thu Apr 16 06:41:27 2015 UTC,"I got the feeling that Hale was a couple of years younger than him. I can't remember why, but that was my impression based on the way that they talked in seasons 1 and 2. Where as the way that Unser mentioned Eglee was their classmate made me think that they were in the same grade at some point."
Sonsofanarchy,32rhxl,gizmatic,2,Thu Apr 16 21:55:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I remember Hale himself said that he was a few years below Jax"
Sonsofanarchy,32rhxl,GrimThursday,3,Thu Apr 16 23:44:09 2015 UTC,"Did he join the MC AFTER Tara left? I thought he was involved with the MC from 16 or so... or at least prospecting.   In the episode where Jax kills Kohn, he tells Tara that she's changed but he's the same guy wearing ""the same kutte"" which makes me think that he was in a kutte when they were in high school which means he was a member back then."
Sonsofanarchy,32rhxl,CreepyAbelTeller,3,Sun Apr 19 00:56:22 2015 UTC,"Okay, he was almost definitely involved in the MC earlier than most, but I don't have a specific reference from the SOA canon to back it up, but when your dad is the founding president, your mom a psychotic MC groupie who gives you a ""son"" ring while you are in elementary school, and you grow up with Piney, Clay, Lenny etc as your role models--and because you are JTs kid, then yeah, I would be surprised to find that Jax wasn't allowed into the MC circle a little (or a lot) sooner than most. Especially since the MC wasn't really outlaw in the earlier days. I don't think that Jax/Opie were prospecting younger than most, but I'm sure that they were a lot more attuned to the MC shenanigans than a lot of other kids.  I assume that to prospect for the MC then you have to be at least 18. I assume this because if the MC took minors then it could open them up to more un-official regulations if parents complained (And Gemma is probably the only parent that would NOT complain about such a thing, to be honest.).  Even though the canon (episodes) was vague about the timeline, we never hear Jax refer to ""Bloody 92"" as though he were apart of the MC then, he doesn't talk about it like he was there.  We are lead to believe that Jax wasn't in the MC when his dad died (1993). He never talks about it like he was there--he refers to it as though its not something he knows 1st hand. We know that Jax was born in 1978 so he would have been 16. I reckon that the earliest he could have joined the MC was 1995.  I got him joining at 19 from the SOA app, if I remember correctly but I can't back up my age for when he joined with an SOA episode off the top of my head."
Sonsofanarchy,32rhxl,gizmatic,6,Sun Apr 19 06:52:56 2015 UTC,I don't remember it being mentioned. As far as I'm aware he wasn't in any armed service. He carries a USMC KA-BAR but I figured it belonged his father. JT and Piney were both Vietnam War vets.
Sonsofanarchy,32rhxl,Hapa_Hombre,4,Thu Apr 16 03:19:23 2015 UTC,jury too. JT saved jury's life during a battle at some point i think?
Sonsofanarchy,32rhxl,UTLRev1312,2,Thu Apr 16 03:37:34 2015 UTC,yes. he says that his father saved jury's life and that jury owes the tellers a chit....and then they patchover the Devil's Tribe.
Sonsofanarchy,32rhxl,stacyo72,2,Thu Apr 16 15:30:12 2015 UTC,His father and Clay were Army Airborne I thought.
Sonsofanarchy,32rhxl,PATRIOT2121,1 point,Thu Apr 16 03:44:57 2015 UTC,"Not sure about JT, but Clay was - the pins on his cut indicate that. IIRC, Clay didn't serve with JT and Piney, though. They founded the club after coming home from Vietnam, while Clay didn't serve until after the club had been founded."
Sonsofanarchy,32rhxl,some_dunkaroos,1 point,Thu Apr 16 23:52:20 2015 UTC,"Owning a USMC KA-BAR means nothing. You can order one directly from KA-BAR if you want. Or if you prefer Amazon, you can order it there, too!"
Sonsofanarchy,32rhxl,-ferrocactus,3,Thu Apr 23 06:38:19 2015 UTC,"No, Jax was never in the USMC.  That's just a mistake in the Wiki.  The fact that he carries a K-Bar doesn't allude to anything.  Marines were issued K-Bars during WWII, IIRC, and it's still identified with the Marine Corps, but it's not a ""Marine"" knife in the sense that it could only belong to a Marine.  Also, I think I read somewhere that Jax had it because it's the maximum length permitted by California law to be carried around.  What I find amusing is that, according to the official SoA website explaining some of the characters' tattoos, Tig actually was a Marine and has a Marine tattoo on his left forearm: http://www.soatattoostories.ink/us/#tig/dagger/backstory  That just about explains his nuttiness.  Unser, too, was a Marine, based on some memorabilia in his office.   A couple of the First 9 were Marines, but not Clay - he was in the Army Airborne (http://www.soatattoostories.ink/us/#clay/death-from-above/backstory).  The silver jump wings he wears on his Kutte indicate completion of initial airborne training (5 jumps), which can be accomplished by anyone in any of the service branches.  Upon completion of 10 jumps, one being a night jump, you get the larger gold jump wings."
Sonsofanarchy,32rhxl,JoeShmoe99,2,Fri Apr 17 17:40:05 2015 UTC,Jax was never in the USMC. It must be a mistake.
Sonsofanarchy,32rhxl,DopeandDiamonds,3,Thu Apr 16 06:40:37 2015 UTC,"I don't think he was in the USMC, the First 9 were though. Why do you think he was in the USMC?"
Sonsofanarchy,32rhxl,GrimThursday,2,Thu Apr 16 03:14:49 2015 UTC,I was reading the SOA wiki and in the background it says he was. They also say that the knife he carries is a USMC knife.  (http://sonsofanarchy.wikia.com/wiki/Jax_Teller)
Sonsofanarchy,32rhxl,Catatafish,6,Thu Apr 16 03:17:26 2015 UTC,Might be his dads?
Sonsofanarchy,32rhxl,DrStephenFalken,2,Thu Apr 16 04:45:11 2015 UTC,I thought it was mentioned it was his dads. Back when he was reading his dads manuscript. I thought his dad mentioned being in Vietnam with piney and Jury. He started the club as a way for his vet brothers to feel like they still belong to something that isn't normal. Jax's ka-bar was from JTs time in the war.
Sonsofanarchy,32rhxl,Mountaineer1024,1 point,Thu Apr 16 20:59:01 2015 UTC,"Maybe the wiki page is right, maybe it's wrong. Literally anyone can edit it (I just did).  But I don't think the idea of him joining the military marries up to what we see of him in the show.  The outlaw life is the only one he knows, joining the military (even temporarily) would have exposed him to a whole other world.  And I'm pretty sure it would have been brought up whenever another character looked at his wrap sheet (Stahl for instance when she referred to him as the prince).  Plus he's already done prison time by the time the show started, exactly when could this supposed USMC stint have been?"
Sonsofanarchy,32rhxl,GrimThursday,2,Thu Apr 16 04:57:35 2015 UTC,Yeah it really doesn't gel with the storyline. I was surprised that was on there because I'd bet he would have mentioned it at least once.
Sonsofanarchy,32rhxl,GrimThursday,2,Thu Apr 16 05:03:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it doesn't fit the timeline at all. He was with Tara in highschool, then she left for a while, and early on in the show they mention that while she left to study medicine he stayed in Charming and stuck with the MC. I don't think there was any time for him to have joined the Marines."
Sonsofanarchy,32rhxl,GrimThursday,1 point,Thu Apr 16 06:36:41 2015 UTC,"The First 9 were all military, but I think Vietnam disenchanted them with order and the system, which is where they formed their outlaw anarchic views.

This way it's impossible to bring back or reboot the series   Doesn't mean they can't do a spin-off with the current club members or even a ""Save by the bell New Class"" deal where they bring in all new people and say it's the club 20 years later."

The super hero ability to murder all the leads of the other gangs / MCs without any retaliation. I'm not against religion but what he did was selfish and easy not very religious IMO.   The insanely slow speeds at which the chase felt like it was taking place."
Sonsofanarchy,32rois,DrStephenFalken,4,Fri Apr 17 04:12:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah the thought ran through my mind as well at the end, how he just goes on a killing spree to ""wrap up"" all the loose ends and doesn't get intercepted by police at any point. Part of me just ignored it because it was the final episode and I was having all kinds of feels haha.  Also, maybe it's that the club IS their religion? Idk...."
Sonsofanarchy,32rois,thunder_thighs_,3,Fri Apr 17 04:19:51 2015 UTC,"how he just goes on a killing spree to ""wrap up"" all the loose ends and doesn't get intercepted by police at any point   They would get into a fight with each other or another club and the police would show up fairly quickly. If they did a club wrong the other club retaliated normally within the same day. I did the same as you in the final episode, I enjoyed it. Then I got to thinking about it and a lot of it didn't make sense.   Also, maybe it's that the club IS their religion? Idk.   In a way yes, but I got more from it. Jax was giving his life for the club to continue on and be better which is BS to me."

Sonsofanarchy,32rois,Minista_Pinky,2,Thu Apr 23 03:47:50 2015 UTC,"The TL:DR is he sacrificed himself for the club. He killed himself and all the other gang leaders to wash everyone of their ""sins.""

He didn't want his sons to know him, so going to prison would make that incredibly hard. I also think that had he not killed himself, he wouldn't have ever been able to really break ties with SAMCRO. He would still be a SAMCRO member... just in prison. Part of him honoring Tara's wish was breaking the cycle and not letting their sons follow the same path - and the sad reality of his life is that in order to accomplish that, he had to physically remove himself from it all."

But I always found it incredibly insensitive and selfish (so basically the definition of Jax lol) that he doesn't visit his mother in the hospital (he takes off with Chibs after LuAnne tells him about Georgie) and chalks it up to ""we can visit her later."" As much as I hate Gemma -- she's his mother and she was injured - albeit he doesn't know the severity or how it happened... but still."

Sonsofanarchy,32l5rf,CatherineWright89,2,Wed Apr 15 01:01:59 2015 UTC,"I think it's cos her dad was a reverend, and she loved her dad.

Sonsofanarchy,32l5rf,stacyo72,2,Wed Apr 15 01:05:13 2015 UTC,"Well that would make sense. I know she does go with unser to church and she reads the bible, just wondering how it fits into the larger story arch."
Sonsofanarchy,32l5rf,stacyo72,2,Wed Apr 15 01:08:40 2015 UTC,Question: last episode when Stahl talks to Bobby in jail she basically comes out and says that Clay put the  hit out on Opie and killed Donna. Does anyone think Bobby knows what happened to Donna but just buries it?
Sonsofanarchy,32l5rf,CatherineWright89,3,Wed Apr 15 01:06:42 2015 UTC,"I don't think bobby trusts stahl, so I don't think he would go up against clay based on something she said, I reckon it probably raised suspicion but I think bobby is the kind of guy who likes to see proof before taking action."

Sonsofanarchy,32l5rf,CatherineWright89,2,Wed Apr 15 01:44:51 2015 UTC,"Jax's ""who the hell are you talking to"" reaction to LuAnne contrasted with how sweet he was moments ago with Tara telling her that it means a lot that she asked for the truth... is interesting. He treats women like shit for the most part (as do all the club members) - but almost always treated Tara like an equal, if not someone who was better than him and deserved more. These are the things that made me root for him... deep down, he was a good guy with a good head on his shoulders. And this is where he was exponentially better than Clay -- who treated all women, including Gemma, like chess pieces."

Sonsofanarchy,32l5rf,TinaIsKillingItSOA11,3,Wed Apr 15 01:24:48 2015 UTC,The job description states they operate on newborns as a speciality But maybe she asked red for development in other medical areas to boost her cv for her next attempt at escaping charming haha

Sonsofanarchy,32j7ia,CaptainKurls,9,Tue Apr 14 05:40:48 2015 UTC,"Well first off he blindly convinced himself that he was doing something for a good reason even if this action was based on rumours with little evidence Bobby said it himself in the show, he takes all of the shit the world throws at him right into his heart. So he makes many decisions based on revenge and hate. He thought he had to act alone. In so many situations if he just asked chibs or tig for some help maybe things could have gone better, but he insisted on doing it himself. He believed being ""king"" meant he had to make decisions that nobody else could. Thats true to an extent but eventually he just made sloppy decisions. Tried to be to nice when sometimes the bloody route actually ended up with less blood in the long run. He focused so much on trying to not be like Clay that he just ended up setting traps up for  himself to get stuck in.   I could probably think of a few more but these are the ones that seemed to stick out to me the most while I watched the show."
Sonsofanarchy,32j7ia,I_HATE_YOU_SO_MUCH,5,Tue Apr 14 07:16:57 2015 UTC,"I think his tragic flaw is probably that he's an incredibly dependent human being. He's not very good on his own. He couldn't leave the club because it was ""part of him"" and he couldn't handle being without Tara because she was ""part of him."" Jax was always defined by other people or other things. He wasn't really ever his own man. I remember the scene in which he proposes to Tara and he's talking about making some bank and then getting out of Charming with their family. He talks about how he doesn't have any skills and the only thing he's good at is being an outlaw. Tara had a complete identity - one that was eventually shattered - but she could survive on her own. She was a skilled surgeon. Jax wasn't really anything on his own. He's right - he's an ok mechanic with a GED. As much as he THOUGHT he could leave the club and save his family - the truth is, in his little world view - he will ALWAYS find a reason to stay with the club because it's the only place he yields power and influence. That, my friend, is a huge flaw.   His inability to communicate the truth and his reluctance to grow the fuck up (aka emotionally immature) were some other flaws that definitely led to his downfall. He lied to Tara, Opie and the club (and yes Gemma too but IDGAF about her) and it bled all over those relationships. He acted like a petulant child in his relationship with Tara - especially with the cheating and then justifying it as ""pushing her away to protect her"" or ""finding comfort when she was pushing him away."" They both sucked at communicating but it always baffled me in Season 6 that instead of actually trying to fix their relationship, he went and stuck his dick in the old prostitute and then cried to Tara that he felt so far away from her."

Sonsofanarchy,32j7ia,Gunner7777,3,Mon Jul 6 20:00:26 2015 UTC,"Letting emotion overcome reason. When he has time to think things through (contrary to what he tells Tara) he can do good things. The way he lead the club in handling the Stahl issue is one example. But when he lets his emotions get the better of him, everyone needs to get out of the way."

Charlie Hunnam  Though he isn't starring in Fifty Shades of Grey, Hunnam, aka Jax, is still making his mark on the big screen. He can be seen in Guillermo del Toro's Crimson Peak, alongside Jessica Chastain and Tom Hiddleston. He's also signed on to star opposite Rosamund Pike in The Mountain Between Us, he'll play King Arthur in Guy Ritchie's Knights of the Roundtable: King Arthur in 2016, and most recently, he signed on to replace Benedict Cumberbatch in Lost City of Z, costarring Sienna Miller and Robert Pattinson.  Katey Sagal  Sagal has retired the role of Gemma, but she's not done collaborating with husband Kurt Sutter; she's set to appear in his next show for FX, The Bastard Executioner, a period piece about a knight. The seasoned actress is also starring in Pitch Perfect 2 as the mother of Hailee Steinfeld's character and the boxing film Bleed For This, with Miles Teller and Aaron Eckhart.  Mark Boone Junior  Up until Bobby's death, Boone Junior had appeared in every episode of Sons of Anarchy, but he's also been busy shooting movies in the off time. He has several films coming up, including a horror movie called Six Gun Dead with Lindsay Lohan.  Kim Coates  Though he'll always be Tig to fans, Coates is moving on too. He'll next be seen, er, heard as a voice in the animated movie Pirate's Passage.  Tommy Flanagan  Flanagan portrayed Chibs for the show's entire length, and he's coming up next in the 2015 film Light Wounds. In case you want to see him now, he turned up in an episode of Peaky Blinders, which is on Netflix.  Theo Rossi  Rossi has been cast in Low Riders opposite Demian Bichir and Eva Longoria.  Dayton Callie  Callie will appear in the 2015 thriller Abattoir, with Taye Diggs and Jessica Lowndes.  Maggie Siff  Tara met her unfortunate end on the show, but the death gave Siff some time to work on other projects, like the sci-fi film The Fifth Wave. She's costarring with Chloë Grace Moretz and Liev Schreiber in the alien invasion movie, out in 2016.  Ron Perlman  Perlman is lending his voice to cartoon comedy Robodog and starring in the thriller Sara's Cell. It's not confirmed yet, but he might be reteaming with Guillermo del Toro for Hellboy 3.  Michael Ornstein  Ornstein, who played Chucky, can be seen in Medicine Man, a movie costarring Darby Stanchfield (Scandal) and Liza Weil (How to Get Away With Murder).  Jimmy Smits  Smits, who appeared as Nero Padilla, is coming up in the drama The Art of Living, alongside Edward James Olmos.  Drea de Matteo  De Matteo's next role is Krissi Cates in Dark Places, the film version of Gillian Flynn's hit novel. She'll also be starring in Sex, Death and Bowling, a drama costarring Selma Blair and Adrian Grenier.  Emilio Rivera  Rivera, aka Marcus Alvarez, has a lot of movies coming up this year, including Hitman: Agent 47 with Rupert Friend.  Kurt Sutter  Creator Sutter doesn't have any acting roles coming up, but he's working on his next FX drama. He also wrote Southpaw, a boxing movie starring Jake Gyllenhaal and Rachel McAdams."

Also, Charlie's upcoming slate is nuts. He's working with some great directors - Del Toro, Ritchie and James effin' Gray. I also LOVED Rosamund Pike in Gone Girl (the acclaim is so well deserved), so I'm excited to see her paired up with Charlie.  Out of all of the actors, Charlie, Maggie and I guess Katey are really doing impressive stuff. The rest of them are... um, co-starring with Lindsay Lohan and voicing animated films."

Sonsofanarchy,323ape,samcro10,3,Fri Apr 10 13:46:53 2015 UTC,I wish there was a birthday themed SOA episode.   Happy birthday Charlie!!
Sonsofanarchy,323ape,CreepyAbelTeller,2,Sat Apr 11 01:31:06 2015 UTC,Happy B-day Jax! Imagine the Birthday Bash that SAMCRO would have had for him.
Sonsofanarchy,3233r9,JR530,4,Fri Apr 10 04:37:03 2015 UTC,"I don't think there's a turning point in which Clay started caring more about himself and less about his family. I think he has always been a pretty selfish guy. Clay was all about Clay and then Gemma, Jax, etc. It just came more into focus when the rift developed between Jax and Clay. You'll notice - Jax takes on a similar quality by Season 6. He's club first, family second.   The Gemma and Tig scene is a strange one. She felt like Clay would love her less once he found out she had been raped. She put A LOT of worth into what men thought of her and how she held up against her partner. So, in the heat of the moment, she felt ""wanted"" and gave in to Tig who seemed to always have a thing for her (not sure if it was sexual but then again, it's Tig and everything is sexual with him)."
Sonsofanarchy,3233r9,CreepyAbelTeller,2,Sat Apr 11 01:36:33 2015 UTC,"The other thing with Clay was, his arthritis in his hands was going to limit his ability to ride his bike and lead the club.  I'm sure it was already preventing him from earning a living as a mechanic.  This got him thinking about how he was going to provide for Gemma and himself when he wasn't running the club, and was more in a ""piney"" type role with the club.   I think Clay was always a little selfish but his need to keep the secrets of John Teller's death to himself, combined with self-interest concerning his inability to lead the club due to his arthritis, caused him to become more selfish and controlling.  The whole ""retirement plan"" issue was even talked about briefly on a couple of episodes I think."
Sonsofanarchy,3233r9,wvtarheel,2,Fri Apr 10 12:41:45 2015 UTC,"I think Clay started to care less when the letters from Maureen became a problem. He cared more about the secrets keeping buried and was willing to sacrifice ties with his family to keep it that way.  The scene where Gemma and Tig did the do was down to them both, in my opinion, being in similar situations. They were both keeping secrets from those they loved. Gemma was hiding the fact she had been raped, and did not want Jax or Clay knowing. Tig was hiding the fact it was he who killed Donna and couldn't tell Opie at the time. In the heat of the moment, I think Gemma was looking for something to maybe set her right and Tig was there. He didn't know what she was hiding and she didn't know what he was hiding. I think the whole situation got too much for both of them, and that led to Tig needing to come clean with Opie.  Hope that helps, other people may of seen it differently so don't hold my opinion as the truth!"
Sonsofanarchy,3233r9,epicollie,1 point,Fri Apr 10 11:13:48 2015 UTC,The club already knew Gemma had been raped before this happened.
Sonsofanarchy,3233r9,Ehfit1983,2,Sat Apr 11 07:39:48 2015 UTC,"yes they did know at that point. but tig and gemma actually never had sex, just a heavy petting/kissing scene. remarkably it was tig who came to his senses first."
Sonsofanarchy,31xmr8,bloodyboppa,25,Wed Apr 8 23:21:13 2015 UTC,Sheriff Jarry is on the case!   ... which means it will never be solved.
Sonsofanarchy,31xmr8,CreepyAbelTeller,21,Thu Apr 9 02:04:51 2015 UTC,"Chibbs would take the club in a legitimate direction, earning legit. Having passed the gun trade over to the Mayans, Jax solidified the clubs ties with the Mayans so long as Alverez and his successor remain Prez. The club would receive major backlash from the IRA for killing a King, but nothing that they couldn't handle. More than likely it comes out that Wayne was dirty, working with SAMCRO as much as he did. Gemma's death would be chalked up to a troubled son to everyone outside of Charming, but those that know the insides of the club would make it a huge deal. With a majority of its first nine dead (Lenny the Pimp still being alive) the Redwood charter would loose a bit of its status, being watched by the more powerful Tacoma and Indian Hills charter. The club would begin prospecting in new members to replace the likes of Juice, and Bobby. They need bodies to stay whole, and to keep their charter operational. The legacy of SAMCRO would be tarnished by two Prez's meeting Mr. Mayham taking at least ten years to reestablish their foot hold in the oranization. Then Abel comes back to Charming....."

Sonsofanarchy,31xmr8,guitarman565,7,Thu Apr 30 13:05:59 2015 UTC,"The redwood charter would take a hit, two consecutive presidents receiving the mayhem vote, after all the carnage, the police would likely be all over SAMCRO as well."
Sonsofanarchy,31xmr8,bwsmg718,7,Thu Apr 9 01:32:50 2015 UTC,"Having lived near the fictional Charming for most of my life, I think it would be big news. Maybe not in Stockton, but newspapers (and local news, for that matter) from smaller towns like Lodi would report on this stuff a lot. Stockton used to be less shit-infested than now, but the only things that might garner attention about SoA shenanigans are 1) a 1%er motorcycle club with a history that goes way back in Charming and the area; 2) a bunch of mayhem involving the police, other MCs, and innocents; and 3) a focus on Jax himself.  I can't imagine a better persona than Jax's for primetime; nor can I picture a better knot of mystery than he, his club, and his family represent on myriad fronts.   My observations lead me to conclude that the earlier seasons of SoA were true to form:  those episodes were truer to the biker ideal. Later episodes, beginning with Season 3's foray over to Eire, began a long distancing from that vision. By the end, SoA may as well have been a pulp opera, akin to Scarface. The suspension of disbelief involving multiple subplots was too much for me.   Still, I watched it to the bitter end and can't say that I would have stopped watching it at any point.  I had to finish the tale."
Sonsofanarchy,31xmr8,McAuslan,1 point,Thu Apr 9 04:54:10 2015 UTC,"Maybe since you lived nearby, you can answer a question that has bugged me since Stockton entered the storyline! If it is inland, how the hell did it have that huge port??"
Sonsofanarchy,31xmr8,813teddy,4,Thu Apr 9 06:44:20 2015 UTC,"You can actually travel by boat from Stockton to San Francisco. SF Bay's terminus is Stockton. My cousin, who lives in Stockton, would take me out into the Delta where we would cruise around to various islands to go to bars on said islands--pretty fun. A lot of people in that area of California actually own islands in the Delta and have vacation homes on them, and these are tiny islands, but there are thousands of them. In recent years, they have become a meth mecca for outlaw entrepreneurs. Anyhoo, Stockton is actually an inland port and is used to divide the Central Valley into two constituent valleys, one north of Stockton and the other south."
Sonsofanarchy,31xmr8,McAuslan,1 point,Thu Apr 9 15:57:39 2015 UTC,"Thank you! Sounds amazing - but it IS California after all. Except for the meth mecca, but I live in Akron, Oh so i'm used to that! :)"
Sonsofanarchy,31xmr8,813teddy,4,Thu Apr 9 16:25:16 2015 UTC,"His kid's get away from the MC, SAMCRO earns legitimate. I don't think the headline matters."
Sonsofanarchy,31xmr8,Acpt7567,4,Thu Apr 9 04:13:03 2015 UTC,I think the club would have to lay low and be nothing short of boy scouts for at least ten years.
Sonsofanarchy,31xmr8,DrWhoisOverRated,2,Thu Apr 9 16:18:08 2015 UTC,I think the club would probably get disbanded in some form. There's really no way around all this either because they've brought so much carnage and sure they're at peace now but they still have quite a few things to deal with

Add up the points at the end of the season and most points wins gold from each of the other 3 of us.   Tie breaker settled by who wins the earliest episode. Earliest a vote can come in is 15 minutes before showtime.  Same people making same guesses is fine, tally points at the end of the season. I can keep track as primary, if I won't be here a particular night someone can step up. If no one says it, no points & you snooze & miss an episode you loose!   a."

Sonsofanarchy,31s6o9,TinaIsKillingItSOA11,1 point,Wed Apr 8 01:21:20 2015 UTC,You would have to have no soul however to not feel for her after Clay beat her.
Sonsofanarchy,31s6o9,stacyo72,2,Wed Apr 8 01:36:06 2015 UTC,"I did feel for her. That was one of the very few times I liked her. She should have told Jax right away that it was Clay who hurt Tara though. But I did feel sorry for her, she loved Clay so much I think it was hard for her to let go of him. She still warned him Opie was after him... That was a good season-I really liked the end to season four. Another near escape for jax and Tara!"
Sonsofanarchy,31s6o9,stacyo72,2,Wed Apr 8 01:40:18 2015 UTC,Hi Stacy.  Hi Tina.  Hmm....Just me and the ladies tonight.
Sonsofanarchy,31s6o9,stacyo72,2,Wed Apr 8 01:07:35 2015 UTC,Nice one. Lol

Sagal was amazing in Season 2 and I LOVED the Gemma/Tara dynamic. Endlessly fascinating. Even in Season 3 and some of Season 4.  It's weird re-watching Season 2 and having little to no sympathy for Gemma now knowing who she truly is/what she ends up doing."
Sonsofanarchy,31s6o9,stacyo72,2,Thu Apr 9 01:54:00 2015 UTC,"yes! the first go round I felt horrible for her. didn't even think of how she just told jax and clay out of pure manipulation. now, all i can see are the wheels turning in her bleached out little brain."

I hope that your BIL has tried the new Ashton Symmetry by now, and as I am sure he knows, you can never go wrong with a VSG ;)  Camacho has a long and storied history, they started going downhill a few years ago but then Davidoff bought them, rebranded and reblended some of them but they are not a very strong cigar across most of their lines and that is just not Ron's style.   Plus the Joya's have a broadleaf wrapper on them which is a big thick leaf and the Camacho leaves across the blends are thinner; with as much moving around as Clay does in the show they would be pretty busted up. Camacho are also considered ""one dimensional"" for the most part.

""“I was living in the Bronx, going to college—and I had, like, $7,600 in parking tickets,” he recalls. “At that point, for all the money I had, it might as well have been $7.6 million. So I went to Minneapolis, because I didn’t want to become a permanent scofflaw in New York. I thought the New York Parking Bureau would never look for me there. Under the guise of being on the lam, I wound up with a Master’s degree, which has been incredibly useful—it’s covering a hole in my bathroom wall.”"

A lot of people leave 1%er MC's for the same reason Jax would have family and their fine. Now Kyle I believe his name was left on bad terms, by that I mean got kicked out and didn't obey the  rules for excommunication."
Sonsofanarchy,31pvds,Acpt7567,1 point,Tue Apr 7 22:18:59 2015 UTC,"Well, I'm not sure exactly, but considering how deep Jax was in the club then, the blowback of him just leaving would've been severe. Remember that dude from season one, where they burned off his tats because he left? And that dude wasn't as important to the club as Jax. Considering everything Jax knew, I doubt they would've just let him walk.   Edit: and that's just SAMCRO. Jax had an enemy list a mile long, and if they found out Jax was going out on his own, they would've certainly come after him and his family. Secrecy was pretty much the only way he could leave and expect a chance to live outside of the club."
Sonsofanarchy,31pvds,TeamStark31,6,Tue Apr 7 17:10:01 2015 UTC,He got burned cause he didn't remove his tattoos after leaving the club. When Clay got kicked out they just inked his tattoos.
Sonsofanarchy,31pvds,JoeShmoe99,1 point,Tue Apr 7 17:42:07 2015 UTC,Excommunication must result in tattoos being removed.  The method is up to the wearer.
Sonsofanarchy,31pvds,JoeShmoe99,1 point,Mon Apr 13 18:33:35 2015 UTC,"No, no, no.  That dude got excommunicated from the club because he left Opie on a job, which led to Opie being in prison for five years.  He didn't just leave."
Sonsofanarchy,31pvds,justmighthaveto,0,Mon Apr 13 18:33:01 2015 UTC,Typically certain gangs require you to get jumped out if you want to leave the club. This involves getting a beat down of severe measures among other things. It may also have to be a unanimous vote. Jax is seen as a shoo-in as next President given his family history with the club. It would be a huge shock to everyone for him to walk away from the club his family built. People would have reservations about him leaving (especially the message it sends to other charters)
Sonsofanarchy,31pvds,some_dunkaroos,0,Tue Apr 7 06:26:22 2015 UTC,"When Jax wants to go Nomad, we see that the club has to vote unanimously for him to so. It stands to reason that a unanimous vote would be needed for him to leave on good terms, as well.  Most of the club is very supportive of Jax (reluctantly voting to let him go Nomad, etc) and would probably vote to release him if it was what he really wanted. Clay would be more difficult, though, given their tendency to fight and Clay's desire to keep some form of control after stepping down (ie hoping to influence Jax if he took over as president), so striking this deal ensures Clay wouldn't keep him from leaving. As president, Clay's vote to release Jax would also help influence other members to vote the same way."
Sonsofanarchy,31nv2j,pleasekopimi,12,Mon Apr 6 19:37:42 2015 UTC,The ending of Season 6 is far more emotionally draining and heartbreaking than the entirety of Season 7. I still to this day cannot re-watch Tara's final scene. But Season 7 is worth it for the last three episodes.

The music is delightful. There's something to enjoy in every scene.   Siff is on the first season and she's an absolute knockout. Her character - though only a minor one in the series - is very significant... as confirmed by last night's episode. Weiner has said he believes Rachel and Don were soulmates."

I read this really interesting article about the costuming on the show and the costume designer spoke about how Tara's look was very ""girl next door"" and unlike Gemma, Wendy and all the croweaters, Tara never had to flaunt herself because she had brains, beauty and Jax. She never really had to compensate. We see Gemma in silk nightgowns and a crap ton of eyeliner before going to bed but we never see Tara in anything really ""sexy."" Interesting stuff.

She always seems sweet and very grounded in interviews and podcast appearances.  So to consider Gemma such a raging bitch (which we all do), IMO is all credit to Katey. And maybe some to the writing too.  I personally think almost all of the actors had their flaws and moments where I would look at them and think, WTF were you thinking when you acted out that scene????"
Sonsofanarchy,31htws,SublimeThoughts,4,Sun Apr 5 05:30:29 2015 UTC,I agree. I think it pays credit to an actor when they make one of their characters so hateable that you hate the actor a little too. Joffrey was very talented in this aspect.

Sorry, but I just can't take her seriously...  I don't know anything about the actress to judge her, but Sherriff Althea Jarry: YUCK!  She didn't mesh well with the other characters, she lacked chemistry with Chibs, and as far as story-wise she didn't GO anywhere. Essentially she was useless. I don't know why they wrote her that way. She was an okay idea, but horrible, nasty, awful execution with the writing and (most of) the acting. The only time I liked Jarry was when she was on the receiving end of a punch/push or verbal beat down."
Sonsofanarchy,31htws,WWJaxD1973,6,Sun Apr 5 16:08:14 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I couldn't even figure out what the point of adding her was. I guess it was just a ""well SOMEONE has to be the cop here"" kinda thing."

Sonsofanarchy,31htws,CreepyAbelTeller,4,Sun Apr 26 01:28:02 2015 UTC,"The actress who played Jarry was HORRIBLE. It was a terribly written character too... so there's that. And although she had a minor part, I have to go with Lyla. She makes Abel look like a master thespian.  Gemma is a bitch but Katey Sagal is phenomenal in that role. I think you're responding to how well she portrayed such a heinous creature."
Sonsofanarchy,31htws,gizmatic,3,Sun Apr 5 23:48:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah, they couldn't seem to get the secondary female characters right at all after Season 3.  I liked LuAnne and Fiona and Opies Mom as secondary female characters. I even liked Cherry. They all played their roles well.  They each played there role in such a way that you could read more into the characters background or glimpse their personality just from watching the few scenes that each of these women had with the other characters.  LuAnne--she was an Old Lady who was leading the life, her Old man was away but she was Porn Queen and self-sufficient with her business. She was buddies with Gemma but definitely 2nd-in-command--and she was ok with that because largely, She and Gemma ran parallel to one another in the day-to-day. You believed that she and Gemma were overgrown Mean Girls.  Fiona--To me, she and Chibs had good chemistry between them. You could see bits of a marriage that they'd both WANTED to work, but obviously didn't for whatever reason, not just because of Jimmys meddling but also probably because of their commitment to their various criminal organizations and inability to leave ""The Life"" behind. You could believe that Chibs and Fiona loved one another, even if they weren't lustfully in love with one another any more.  Mary-- She was disenchanted with the SOA and the MC Outlaw Lifestyle. She probably fell in with SAMCRO as a phase in the days of a misguided youth and then realized what she'd gotten herself into. We know she didn't raise Opie and you can just see that nothing about her nature is ""nurturing"" so its not hard to guess why. Motherhood didn't suit her, Piney wasn't a good husband to begin with and she wasn't committed to the SOA on principle so she certainly wasn't going to fight for a man who was going to drink, cheat and break the law on a whim with no consideration for her, so she got out.  None of those are the official bios but if you pay attention when you watch, then thats the sense that you get. In the early seasons they cast actresses and wrote scenes that were good about Show-dont-Tell.  After Season 3? We got characters like Carla, Emma Jean, Darvany, Collette and Brooke. If you didn't pay attention you'd miss the explanation of who the heck they were and why they may or may not matter and were usually left wondering what was even the point of them.  I like quirky casts and fast paced story telling, but sometimes the pace was so fast that they forget to actually tell a story."
Sonsofanarchy,31htws,CreepyAbelTeller,3,Mon Apr 6 01:03:47 2015 UTC,"The Emma Jean character was the most bizarre example of stunt casting on SOA. She served NO purpose. And more importantly - of all the D-list actors in the world, we get Ashley Tisdale?  I would also add that Tara lookalike in Season 7. She had this super lengthy interview with Entertainment Weekly and it came off as if she were a recurring character... but nope, she was around for 15 minutes tops."
Sonsofanarchy,31htws,MajesticCat,1 point,Mon Apr 6 02:25:06 2015 UTC,"Tisdale said herself in an interview - the reason she was cast was because her dad was doing work on Kurt & Katey's house. She was a fan of the show, and basically said, ""Daddy, please!"" and was cast as a favor. Makes a whole lot of sense."
Sonsofanarchy,31htws,Ey3z0nF1rE,1 point,Tue Apr 21 19:44:26 2015 UTC,"It was actually the opposite.  She asked her dad that like you said, but her dad being a quiet man told her he couldn't ask Kurt of that.  Then a few weeks later, Kurt walked into her dads house and said ""I have a favor to ask of you.,we would love to cast Ashley on the show for a limited role.."" And BAM!! Lol"

Sonsofanarchy,31htws,mybaby51,3,Sun Apr 5 14:02:05 2015 UTC,I agree with the woman from glee. They made a big deal about her coming to the show (not SOA but gossip blogs and stuff) I thought she was going to maybe play some bad ass biker chick or something to get her out of the roles she usually in... and nope just some waitress in a diner

Sprague Grayden can't act - every role she lands ends up falling so flat. Donna had so much potential! I mean I know there wasn't a whole lot of time devoted to Ope's family in the first season, but the screen time she did get was essentially wasted. Donna could have been a powerful character if she had been played with a bit more depth, but in the end she was more or less a one-dimensional vessel for kickstarting Opie's descent."
Sonsofanarchy,31htws,CreepyAbelTeller,-5,Thu Apr 9 09:11:09 2015 UTC,Worst character.. Jax. Sorry guys I know a lot of you love him. To me he always was a bitch. I hate half in people. You either you do it or you don't.  Just my opinion so dont let your heads explode.
Sonsofanarchy,31htws,wvtarheel,10,Sun Apr 5 19:15:19 2015 UTC,"I think if he wasn't half in/half out, the show wouldn't really make sense. SOA is largely about Jax's journey in figuring out the kind of man he wants to be... and there's really no certainty when you're discovering that."
Sonsofanarchy,31htws,GregDraven,7,Sun Apr 5 23:51:17 2015 UTC,"Agree with creepyabelteller - The point of the show was Jax being half in and half out.  It got frustrating at times, because you want him to be the protagonist, but in the end you have to realize he just isn't a good guy.  Or is he?"
Sonsofanarchy,31htws,wvtarheel,-14,Mon Apr 6 19:06:19 2015 UTC,"For me, the worst actor is Chris Reed, played filthy Phil.   I really want to be an actor, and I think I'm petty good at it so it really grinds my gears when I see an actor get the opportunity of a lifetime, then be mediocre at best.   I like Chris Reed, he's a nice bloke. Just can't act.  Edit - Wow, downvoted to heck for giving my opinion on an In your opinion thread, stay classy sons of reddit."

Sonsofanarchy,319u0r,gingerbeef7,6,Fri Apr 3 03:39:56 2015 UTC,"Officially, I don't think that there could be an MC affiliated funeral. As far as the SOA organization was concerned, Jax Teller was a murderous traitor--he killed a brother and charter president. Outside of the strictly official sense of it, Jaxs betrayal was especially disgusting because Jury was a beloved friend of the Teller family. So everyone who knew of Jax and Jury would be turned off by that fact. Plus, it was 100% true, Jax killed Jury in an angry passion.  Jax Teller was judged by the SOA and it was decided that he needed to meet Mr. Mayhem--once the Mayhem vote had fallen, the club couldn't officially be all buddy, buddy with him. I don't think SAMCRO could afford to disrespect the rules by holding an MC funeral for Jax--they were already in a position of weakness.  We know that Charming wasn't feeling Jax (or the SOA) when he died, so I can't imagine who outside of a few members of SAMCRO would have gone, but I'm not even sure that members of SAMCRO could have gone (in their kuttes) if they'd wanted to.  Assuming no other charters were there to be sure SAMCRO fully left Jax alone, then I think that for Jaxs funeral the attendants would be from among: Skeeter, Wendy, Nero, Abel and Thomas, Chucky, Chibs, Tig, Happy and Rat would be about it. TO, Montez and Quinn might have come or they might not have. Marby Darby popped by to show his respects, maybe not."
Sonsofanarchy,319u0r,gizmatic,4,Fri Apr 3 12:13:38 2015 UTC,"I don't think celebrating his life - a la a funeral - would have made sense considering Jax wanted any memory of him to vanish once he died. He wanted his sons to grow up hating him and a funeral in which his family (i.e. his children) would be seated front-row would go against his wishes. Plus, outside of the Redwood chapter, he was considered a traitor who had committed president-on-president murder. I doubt other charters would feel obligated to attend. The only person who would probably pay their respect is Unser who seemed to go to everyone's grave... and well, we know what happened to him and who did it...  O/T but I just re-watched the series finale and I thought it was very interesting when Jax goes to Tara's grave, he places his backpack in what appears to be the perfect distance for another plot. It's like he knew he would buried right there, next to her. Not sure if that was intentional but that specific shot included his backpack and it would seem random and unnecessary unless there was some significance in showing it."

Sonsofanarchy,319u0r,admiraljohn,2,Mon Apr 6 07:20:52 2015 UTC,^ Yes this. I am literally talking about a cemetery plot. The plot of land in the shot I described above. Not a literary plot.
Sonsofanarchy,319u0r,CatherineWright89,2,Mon Apr 6 18:01:07 2015 UTC,"They wouldn't have a funeral, would they? He was, in the eyes of the club, a 'traitor' of sorts.  But in hypothetical terms, It'd just be SAMCRO. I don't think anyone else would want to attend."
Sonsofanarchy,319u0r,gizmatic,2,Fri Apr 3 11:30:54 2015 UTC,"When Jax died there was an APB out on him for multiple homicides. Not only that, but these homicides were done in broad daylight with multiple witnesses.   I think any good feelings the community had towards him (and maybe even SAMCRO as a whole) would be pretty much destroyed by this. I could see members of SAMCRO showing up at his funeral and possibly members from other charters but I don't think there'd be much, if any, community participation."
Sonsofanarchy,319u0r,bwsmg718,2,Fri Apr 3 12:03:18 2015 UTC,"I think Patterson would have gone to his funeral. I think she realised the good intentions he had on his last day. I think he would have been buried with Tara.   I definatley think the redwood original charter would have gone to his funeral, I don't think anything would stop them, with Abel, Thomas, Wendy and Nero. I think Venus would be there, rat boys girlfriend, all the escort girls. Mary (Opie's mum) Layla and Opie's kids.  I don't think it would have been a bad turnout!   I think Chibs would have read a eulogy, and it would have been heartbreaking!"
Sonsofanarchy,319u0r,besyuziki,3,Fri Apr 3 13:14:25 2015 UTC,Mary didn't even go to Opie or Pineys service. I highly doubt she'd have schlepped her fat ass out to the grave yard to see Jax off.

Sonsofanarchy,30ynoa,CreepyAbelTeller,7,Wed Apr 1 01:33:30 2015 UTC,Me too. I really liked him. I also wanted to see more of his relationship with Tara. It was pretty heavily implied he had a crush on her and while I would have liked her to have one genuine friend -- not a weird Unser-Gemma unrequited love situation -- I think she could have used a good guy like Hale as a friend in later seasons. Lord knows she needed someone other than Gemma and Jax to talk to.
Sonsofanarchy,30ynoa,CatherineWright89,4,Wed Apr 1 01:36:34 2015 UTC,"I agree. He definately cared about Tara, and I don't think Jax really disliked him neither, I think Jax and hale would have ended up friends had he stayed! But hale and Tara would have been interesting to watch!"
Sonsofanarchy,30ynoa,stacyo72,2,Wed Apr 1 01:41:35 2015 UTC,I think he totally had a thing for Tara.  If Jax wasn't in the picture Hale and Tara would have been a perfect couple.
Sonsofanarchy,30ynoa,CreepyAbelTeller,4,Wed Apr 1 01:45:15 2015 UTC,"Stahl calls him out on it in an earlier episode. It wasn't fair that Tara always had to be the ""jealous"" one. She's a super attractive doctor -- Jackie boy should have to get jealous from time to time.   But as crazy and fucked up their relationship is, Jax and Tara were the perfect match. That perfect booty needed little Tar Tar."
Sonsofanarchy,30ynoa,stacyo72,2,Wed Apr 1 01:47:12 2015 UTC,God hearing her called Tar Tar just makes my skin crawl! Lol
Sonsofanarchy,30ynoa,Alwaysthequiet1,4,Wed Apr 1 01:48:47 2015 UTC,"Agreed, I was very disappointed when he died."
Sonsofanarchy,30ynoa,JaxTeller718,3,Wed Apr 1 01:34:19 2015 UTC,"Gree 100 percent. The dynamic between Hale and Jax would have been fascinating considering Hale does not HATE the club just what it does. By the beginning of Season 3 Hale seems like he hates his own famil more than the club. So sad the actor chose to leave to pursue directing. I mean great for him, but I wonder how him leaving changed so much of what we saw. It was obvious from the season 2 finale that Hale would have played heavily in Jax pushing Tara away from him during Ireland. Someone should ask Sutter what the original endgame was but i doubt he would ever answer. Between this and losing the crazy marshall in Season 6 early due to Gotham I believe I wonder how much the endgame had changed. Hell i think even Roosevelt joined another show which is why he left as well."
Sonsofanarchy,30ynoa,stacyo72,2,Wed Apr 1 15:08:37 2015 UTC,The way they work together in season two is so  good. I would have loved to see that relationship pan out.
Sonsofanarchy,30ynoa,CaptainKurls,2,Wed Apr 1 01:35:15 2015 UTC,"I thought it would develop into a Jax and Hale vs Unser and Clay but then Hale died. I would've loved to see that, the corrupt older generation vs the new generation looking to do things right"
Sonsofanarchy,30ynoa,CatherineWright89,1 point,Tue Apr 7 04:27:40 2015 UTC,"I think it would have been brilliant, Jax and hale would have made great decisions. I think hale had a thing for Tara though so that would have complicated the relationship haha It would have been exactly like clay, Gemma and Wayne."
Sonsofanarchy,30ynoa,CatherineWright89,1 point,Tue Apr 7 23:43:23 2015 UTC,"I really would have loved to have seen Hale and Jax's relationship develop.   Oh amen sister. I've talked with multiple people about that; it would have been an amazing arc down the line in the later seasons, even if he left and ended up coming back to Charming."
Sonsofanarchy,30ynoa,stacyo72,1 point,Wed Apr 1 01:47:26 2015 UTC,"I think Jax at this point is a decent version of what a son should be, and hale is a decent cop. It would have been brilliant to have seen how far hale would bend for Jax, and if he would have not fully followed the law for the sake of Jax. I'd love to know what kurt planned for them before hale quit!"
Sonsofanarchy,30ynoa,CatherineWright89,1 point,Wed Apr 1 01:53:26 2015 UTC,I wonder if he would have followed the sheriff  Roosevelt arch with Potter going after Juice.

Sonsofanarchy,30ynoa,CatherineWright89,4,Wed Apr 1 00:59:30 2015 UTC,"I think people give Charlie Hunnam far too little credit as an actor. A lot of times it's not what or how he says something, but his reactions. Walking out the door, wiping his tears and acting like a bad  ass while his heart was just  stomped on .

It is borderline strange and obsessive on his part (really man, you have spent the last 10+ years banging boatloads of hoes and you always see Tara's face? Alrighty then!) but there is something strangely romantic and beautiful about his confession. He loved her so damn much."
Sonsofanarchy,30ynoa,stacyo72,3,Wed Apr 1 01:19:47 2015 UTC,Looking forward to finally being back to Teller Tuesdays with you all! Hope we have as big a turnout as last week!

Sonsofanarchy,30ynoa,CreepyAbelTeller,3,Wed Apr 1 01:24:57 2015 UTC,"I love love love when Jax and Tara kiss at Donna's funeral. I know it's inconsiderate of Jax (but really - when is he considerate?) but he just looks so cool with his little head nod after the kiss. He finally got the girl (again).   Also, Tara must be use to Jax's stinky breath because she just swapped spit with Mr. Pukey, and is totally cool with it."
Sonsofanarchy,30ynoa,CreepyAbelTeller,3,Wed Apr 1 01:53:05 2015 UTC,"I love that too. I love how it is Tara who gives him his cutt too, and not Gemma! That's Tara standing up as his old lady. I love that scene so much!  Jax always looks cool, it takes a lot to look cool at a funeral tho!"
Sonsofanarchy,30ynoa,stacyo72,5,Wed Apr 1 01:56:06 2015 UTC,Which is really interesting - the woman who left Charming as a teen to get away from the influence of the club/Jax is the one who ends up handing him is kutte. There's some symbolism in there.
Sonsofanarchy,30ynoa,Alwaysthequiet1,3,Wed Apr 1 01:58:27 2015 UTC,I really want to read John's manuscript.
Sonsofanarchy,30ynoa,CreepyAbelTeller,3,Wed Apr 1 01:53:13 2015 UTC,Light weight. Only one and a half fifths of vodka and  he's puking? Need to switch to Tito's. No hangover.

Sonsofanarchy,30ynoa,stacyo72,2,Wed Apr 1 01:51:57 2015 UTC,Mary is totally not the smother that Gemma is... interesting mother/son dynamic there. Nothing like Gemma/Jax.
Sonsofanarchy,30ynoa,CatherineWright89,3,Wed Apr 1 01:08:27 2015 UTC,She says at one point that she never had a relationship with opie. I want to see how piney and mary are shown in the first nine.
Sonsofanarchy,30ynoa,stacyo72,2,Wed Apr 1 01:10:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah, and Opie adored Piney. I really enjoyed that dynamic. It was kind of what I imagine Jax/JT would have been like had JT been around."

Sonsofanarchy,30ynoa,CreepyAbelTeller,2,Wed Apr 1 01:21:19 2015 UTC,Ouch. The truth hurts so damn bad.

Even Gemma gives her a ""ohh no you didn't just say that"" look. Didn't Jax just tell her a few episodes ago that he never wanted to be married and hated her when he found out she was pregnant? Love, that ain't."

Sonsofanarchy,30ynoa,besyuziki,3,Wed Apr 1 01:25:55 2015 UTC,She is that fucked imo.
Sonsofanarchy,30ynoa,stacyo72,2,Wed Apr 1 01:27:46 2015 UTC,I love how Jax goes all authoritative here.
Sonsofanarchy,30ynoa,TinaIsKillingItSOA11,2,Wed Apr 1 01:27:36 2015 UTC,Love that. And Piney's reaction.
Sonsofanarchy,30ynoa,stacyo72,2,Wed Apr 1 01:30:53 2015 UTC,Damn but this is such a great episode. So many great scenes.
Sonsofanarchy,30ynoa,CreepyAbelTeller,2,Wed Apr 1 01:29:14 2015 UTC,It really is! I forgot most of this episode!  It's a brilliant one!

In this case, he was saying whatever Wendy wanted to hear (even though he had zero desire to get back with her) to get her focused on staying clean."

Sonsofanarchy,30sh87,CrystalFissure,8,Mon Mar 30 09:30:53 2015 UTC,"The moment he viciously attacked Wendy sort of cemented his ""monster"" status. I don't want to spoil anything for you so I can't really go on but it's a huge turning point in the series -- not so much because he attacked Wendy per say but because of the logic behind it. Earlier in the episode, he clearly doesn't like what Wendy has to say - which for once is actually highly logical and truthful - and at the beginning of the ep, he couldn't get the guys to vote on mayhem for Clay so he takes his anger and throws it (literally) against the wall with Wendy. It's a really really sad scene. I never did like Wendy but man, I felt for that poor ex-junkie and her terrible makeup."
Sonsofanarchy,30sh87,CreepyAbelTeller,3,Mon Mar 30 18:34:47 2015 UTC,"I think it's hard to answer this without spoilers!  I always loved Jax but in that episode with Wendy my faith in the guy did waiver, but for me personally, I think Jax redeemed himself.  Although he did a lot of bad things, I always felt like this was the worst thing he did.  It's really hard to elaborate on this without mentioning events on the last two seasons! Sorry!"
Sonsofanarchy,30sh87,CatherineWright89,3,Mon Mar 30 10:33:59 2015 UTC,"I think, throughout the series - we're meant to be very conflicted about Jax. Props to Sutter and Hunnam creating a character complex enough for us to feel these things."
Sonsofanarchy,30sh87,-cwl-,2,Mon Mar 30 17:19:19 2015 UTC,"I didn't hate Jax at all, season 5 was a conflicting time for Jax but I never wasn't on his side. I hated Wendy in season 5, how she tried to come force her way into Abel's life as his mother, regardless if she gave birth to him it was Tara who stepped up and took him under her wing and raises him, Wendy didn't have the right and got what she deserved in my opinion."

I feel for Tara's death but damn, he's a stupid shit to believe that the Chinese guy did it. I mean seriously, the level of apologists for the guy actually concerns me a bit. He's a self-righteous, disgusting serial killer who tortures without remorse. She injected a woman with heroin who suffered from abuse. That is so damn intolerable I can't even begin.  It doesn't matter what Wendy did. No-one deserves to be forced into relapse like that. If you really think she deserved what she got for daring to get to know her son (and she was in a safer position than Jax / Tara was, then I dunno, that disappoints me. I get that it's a TV show, but yeah."

I guess there is something in me that loves seeing someone become the villain. I think the power of having the gavel definitely got to him. Most of season 5 is Jax doing whatever the hell he wants, even if it destroys Wendy."
Sonsofanarchy,30sh87,MajesticCat,2,Sun Apr 5 22:37:37 2015 UTC,"I loved Jax up until Season 5. Then that love turned into passionate hatred. There were still moments were I, in a sick way, admired him. But he truly became a monster in the end. There was a moment in Season 6 where I felt he redeemed himself, but not entirely. It basically just made me think that deep down inside, he was still Jax - but had changed after becoming president. Regardless, he loved Tara and his boys but had a lot of problems that interfered with being a proper husband and father."

And he was weird and calculating and ruthless and in the end he somehow HELPED the MC by doing away with the mayor. Oh and he had great one liners.
Sonsofanarchy,30qf1h,ThiefofNobility,4,Sun Mar 29 21:33:33 2015 UTC,"Potter was amazing.  He hated everyone.

Sonsofanarchy,30qf1h,ThiefofNobility,5,Thu Apr 2 21:50:51 2015 UTC,"He wasn't a friend to the MC, but he wasn't a villain either. I guess we'd have to establish what we mean by ""villain."" If you're implying anyone against the MC, then he would qualify. But that's like saying Hank is the villain of Breaking Bad because the main character is Walter White."
Sonsofanarchy,30qf1h,pm_me_judge_reinhold,1 point,Thu Apr 2 22:05:55 2015 UTC,"I have a theory that he was sexually abused as a child. Throughout Season 4 you see how odd he is, how different and withdrawn he is from his colleagues. He is a very bright individual who will not hesitate to throw some people under the bus in order to get what he wants. In his own words, he doesn't like people all that much.     In the end where he ruined Hale's plans for Charming heights by bringing all the sex toys to the council meeting, he seemed to be distracted by the little boy sex doll. When he looked at it, he seemed disgusted, but sad and passive.      I think he may have been sexually abused as a kid, and the abuser maybe never got caught or punished. Ofc it's a far fetched theory, with little evidence behind it, but it makes sense to me."

His arc was the where you started to realize that the fact that the sons were lords of their tiny town didn't mean that they were actually big fish.

Sonsofanarchy,30qf1h,CatherineWright89,1 point,Mon Mar 30 00:57:31 2015 UTC,"See, I never really saw Clay as a villain - at least compared to the other outright villains in the series. Yes, he did some horrible shit and caused a lot of pain but I always felt like he was under Gemma's thumb -- starting with carrying out JT's murder which was sanctioned (and probably highly encouraged) by Gemma. I feel like he truly and purely loved Gemma and even Jax. I didn't like him one bit after Season 2 but I also recognize that he wasn't as bad as the company he kept -- aka Gemma.   I think it's kind of fascinating that we don't know much about Clay pre-SAMCRO. He's a vet who came into JT/Gemma's orbit and moved on with Gemma and raised Jax. What was he like before all of that? Did he ever have any other children? Where the heck is he from?"

In terms of most fucked up villain I'd give it to her, but also because her death is one of the best scenes in the whole series and that is my favorite finale."
Sonsofanarchy,30qf1h,ChupacabraIsMyFriend,7,Tue Mar 31 03:07:26 2015 UTC,"I'd have to agree with Gemma. She was the root of all evil in Jax's life. I didn't hate her all the time but she was a beautifully complex and ultimately destructive character. She was selfish and cruel to Jax all his life and I don't even think she realised it.   The villan I genuinely despised was insignificant in the grand scene of things, and that was Alice, Venus' mother, she was a despicable woman and I was very happy she was killed. I kind of wish Venus had got to kill her though, revenge for all the years she was abused!  Pope... He was a weird one for me , I really liked his character, he was brilliant, but then I remember what he did to dawn and opie and I hate him.  Stahl I just wanted to punch in the face, her death was the most satisfying murder of the whole show I think, it was massively deserved."
Sonsofanarchy,30qf1h,Weltall548,1 point,Mon Mar 30 01:20:00 2015 UTC,What I liked about Gemma was that all of her best and worst actions stemmed from the same trait- her obsessive desire to keep people she cared about close. And you see Jax develop that trait too.   One of the few things I liked about the Ireland story arc was that Jax acknowledged that he was a danger to his kid (though he quickly went back from that way of thinking).
Sonsofanarchy,30qf1h,BasketeerOverHere,1 point,Mon Mar 30 21:11:19 2015 UTC,"though he quickly went back from that way of thinking   ^ which was entirely due to Gemma's ability to manipulate him. She brought up Tara's pregnancy and what he would tell his other son about Abel which immediately made him feel guilty.   I disagree that Jax had an obsessive trait to keep those he cared about close to him. I think mentally and emotionally he was very very obsessed with Tara (and maybe his kids but he was a pretty absent father so idk) which bordered on toxic BUT he encouraged her to leave on more than one occasion (and even later with the kids). I think truthfully he probably would have been an emotionally and mental wreck if she did ever leave but it's the thought that counts. Gemma is the complete opposite - I'll never forget... Jax in S4 tells Gemma that Tara and the kids are going to stay in Oregon for a while to stay clear of headless bodies and her reaction is ""you can't do that..."""
Sonsofanarchy,30qf1h,Blackjack__21,1 point,Mon Mar 30 21:53:09 2015 UTC,"No, he went back to that way of thinking because the adopted parents got murdered. He left Abel with them, then had to get him back, and got understandably over-protective (it's also plausible that Gemma's over-protectiveness stems in part from losing Thomas II to a heart condition that Jax and her also have- basically her sons' connection to her killed one of them, and put the other at risk from a very early point).   Jax does struggle with the 'keep the kids around vs. send them away' thing more than Gemma does. At least he gives some thought to the idea. But frankly, his attempts often feel halfassed, like he's dithering around. I think that for most of the series, but not all (admittedly, I haven't seen the last season, though it's been spoilered for me), he's kind of avoiding ripping off that band aid."
Sonsofanarchy,30qf1h,fantoman,1 point,Mon Mar 30 23:31:46 2015 UTC,"Right - but what triggered his decision was Gemma telling him about the baby in the oven.   And I agree about the ""avoiding ripping off that bandaid"" sentiment. One can say it's similar to his decision to leave SAMCRO -- while he may have truly felt like he was prepared to leave at one point, the truth is that it's the only place where he feels he yields power and influence. He was dragging his feet with that decision in later seasons, too."

Sonsofanarchy,30jsux,st4rgasm,26,Fri Mar 27 23:54:51 2015 UTC,"It was a trick.  Jax was being a ""double agent"" for SAMCRO. Jax TRICKED Stahl into making an ""under the table"" deal with him. Jax told her that he would rat for her, IF  1) Gemma was cleared of the false Murder charges for killing Edmond Hayes. Stahl killed Edmond and FRAMED Gemma for it   and  2) If Stahl would help SAMCRO get a reduced sentence for their gun and assualt charges, even though they really were guilty of assualting a group of people with semi-automatic weapons.  He and the whole club were in on the trick from the beginning of it. He was never ratting, he was carrying out a club-sactioned mission is all. Jax, went to the club and proposed the idea and they all voted on it and swore--as a club not to tell anyone, not even Gemma or Tara--which is why Jax wrote that letter to Gemma explaining it all at the end of the season because they didn't show SAMCRO setting it up, they wrote it that way to surprise and delight the audience (Watch Season 3s finale, the last few minutes and listen to Jaxs voice-over of the letter.)  The reason why he did it was to get the club a reduced sentence for those gun/assualt charges--they should have done like 12 years each or something like that. Instead, they wound up serving 14 months in Jail and being released on Parole. Also, Stahl had framed Gemma for murder, but she retracted the statement and blamed it on someone else. Rewatch Season 3 and ask questions as you go, its fun to watch that story unfold.   Stahl accepted the offer, she suspect that Jax was double crossing her, so that is why she wanted to ""make sure the prince had really turned Rat"" when she went to TM to get Jimmy O.  Because they were tricking her ALL of SAMCRO had to pretend that they were shocked that Jax had been working with Stahl. Gemma had to believe that her son was really going to be killed, Tara had to really think she might not ever see Jax again--the guys didn't know where the ladies would be when that part went down, but by keeping them in the dark, they guaranteed that Gemma and Tara had a natural and believable reaction.   Stahl watched everyone when she told them about Jax because she suspected them of lying to her, but SAMCRO got angry and violent, Gemma was desperate, Tara cried--everyone reacted appropriately and once Stahl was satisfied that SAMCRO had been surprised by Jax working with her, she signed some documents AND gave them to SAMCROs lawyer that said SAMCRO would only serve 3 years in prison BUT if they had good behaviour, they could have parole in 14 months.  Then she got in her car and rode off, smug and satisfied that Jax was going to be killed by the SOA or one of their allies and that SAMCRO would be destroyed/destabilized by Jaxs betrayal. (She personally hated SAMCRO, she didn't want to see them brought to justice, she wanted to see them suffer or dead.) They had Chibs and Opie waiting for her and Jimmy. Opie wanted Stahl dead, Chibs wanted Jimmy O. dead and so they ambushed and killed them to get their revenge--UNSER HELPED LURE Stahl to the ambush BECAUSE IT WAS HIS LAST DAY AS POLICE CHIEF and to get back into the Sons and Gemmas good graces. Stahl didn't think about/realize that so she believed Unser when he said all of that.  Anyway, Chibs and Opie (along with Piney and Kozik) killed Jimmy O. and Stahl, ""beat"" or ""knocked out"" Unser and DESTROYED the papers that Jax had signed making him a rat so it never got out that Jax of the SOA had worked with a Fed. There was no proof so only SOA knew that Jax had done it and Jax only did it because the SOA needed him to.  Hopefully, that was detail enough to help you understand it now. If not, let me know what you are unclear about and I'll be happy to walk you through it, I enjoyed that season a lot."

Most of the guys that we think of as being loyal to a fault formed the club together or were soldiers, IRA, of a different type previously. He was just a mixed up young man with circumstances constantly battling him. The younger guys outside of Opie and Jax were getting killed at a ridiculous rate when it came time for a test of their loyalty.  If he had just gone to Jax in private and either been used against the feds or even drummed out if they wanted to be shitty I would have preferred that. Hell he did try to kill himself before he'd committed almost a quarter of his offenses. Sorry for the length, tried to cover everything from memory on mobile."
Sonsofanarchy,30a7m2,subjectiveoddity,7,Thu Mar 26 02:33:30 2015 UTC,"It certainly would have been better.   However my point is that, Potter didn't cause anything. He did his job.   When he accepted the reaper on his back, never turning let alone killing another member was his Job.  He failed. Miserably.  He killed a member to help a cop.   If he would have stood his ground, we know for a fact that everything would have been okay.   His cowardice cost him everything. Not potter."
Sonsofanarchy,30a7m2,4mrkite,3,Thu Mar 26 02:57:38 2015 UTC,"You ever know something to be true and acknowledge it but emotion overrules you and fault is placed anyways?  That's me right now. I know it to be true but I can't do it, I must blame this man for the downfall of who I thought to be the most redeemable, at that time, of my favorite criminal group.  My brain gets it, my heart blames that poor fucker doing his job. And yes if you're curious, I admit I would be a terrible judge."
Sonsofanarchy,30a7m2,subjectiveoddity,2,Thu Mar 26 03:02:24 2015 UTC,"You're so right though. I love how divided Juice's character can make fans. While I despise some of his actions and wish he had made a different decision I also understand them and wish he wasn't stuck so much between a rock and a hard place. Juice, in my mind, was the sacrificial lamb of the club that, while he made mistakes, just couldn't survive in the long run; too many things worked against him and he was too deep into his decisions."
Sonsofanarchy,30a7m2,toneloc418,3,Thu Mar 26 02:53:00 2015 UTC,I agree with you but I think Juice ruined his own life by choosing to be an outlaw. Those kinds of careers don't tend to end well.
Sonsofanarchy,30a7m2,CreepyAbelTeller,2,Thu Mar 26 03:27:06 2015 UTC,Excellent summation.
Sonsofanarchy,30a7m2,subjectiveoddity,6,Thu Mar 26 03:29:47 2015 UTC,I love when Sutter would add in a quirky minor character like this. They were so much fun to watch.

In Season 3, we couldn’t make a deal with the actor who played David Hale [Tyler Sheridan], so that character ended up going away, and what we were able to do is put a lot of that onto Unser [Dayton Callie], and that’s really what blew up that character. I’m so glad I was able to do that because he’s become such an integral part of the show.   http://uproxx.com/tv/2013/10/thats-spoiler-prematurely-killed-weeks-sons-anarchy/"

But after re-watching, I'm guessing it's a mix of PTSD from what happened with Kohn and the fact that Jax goes from sweet talk in the hospital about their relationship to reducing it to ""whatever this is"" in Abel's soon to be nursery.   Also, it's so weird to see Jax care about not pushing Wendy over the edge considering how he treats her in later seasons and specfically what he does to her in Season 5...."
Sonsofanarchy,30575v,stacyo72,2,Wed Mar 25 01:19:08 2015 UTC,"The whole first season he cares about Wendy and her recovery. Holding her hand in the hospital, not wanting the push Tara up in her face...but then she bails.

Sonsofanarchy,30575v,besyuziki,1 point,Wed Mar 25 01:22:16 2015 UTC,"He is pretty nice to her in S1. Although in one of the earlier episodes, while attempting to own some of the blame of what happened to Abel, he segues into telling her how he hated her when he found out she was pregnant and that he never wanted to be married... all while she's in the hospital and probably in a lot of pain from her suicide attempt less than 24 hours ago.

Sonsofanarchy,30575v,GrubstakeMoose,2,Wed Mar 25 01:53:32 2015 UTC,"The Gemma/Tara dynamic always fascinated me. It irritates me when people write it off as annoying because it's one of the deepest relationships in the SOA universe. They both grew up without a mother (Gemma's mother checked out mentally when Gemma was young/she ran away at 16, Tara's mother died when she was a kid), so they look to each other as a surrogate mother/daughter - though neither would admit it at this stage. Gemma is a symbol of thwarted potential while Tara is someone who left this world to become a professional and achieve success. It's fascinating how similar yet different they both are - which I appreciate because I could not handle a Gemma 2.0."

Keep refreshing right around then and look for a post by either /u/asstasticbum or myself (/u/Alwaysthequiet1), as we post a comment letting everyone know when to play.   Once you see that comment, press play, and you should be pretty much in the same time frame as everyone else. This is (so far) the best solution we've come up with, given that the episode no longer automatically starts ""on air"" any more. We've received no complaints and 3 months later it seems to be a system that works so we'll be keeping it for now.

Sonsofanarchy,303edl,monkey-bones,20,Thu Mar 26 20:26:29 2015 UTC,"In the season 3 premiere, when Gemma is in a motel room, a plane crash is shown briefly on tv. When Gemma is clipping her nails, she then reads the newspaper an its speculated that Ethan was killed in that plane crash. Nothing is officially confirmed but we can safely assume that is what happened"
Sonsofanarchy,303edl,RNDMH3ro,4,Tue Mar 24 03:40:11 2015 UTC,Holy crap.  I think I missed this scene.
Sonsofanarchy,303edl,KanpaiWashi,3,Tue Mar 24 16:52:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah there's lots of speculation over the plane crash but Sutter has said that Zobelle escaped, just going to show that bad people do get away sometimes. I also think it was well in line with the elusiveness of the character, someone who had everything so well thought out was saved at the zero hour by circumstances he had nothing to do with. It's also worth noting that his daughter had to die so he could live, had Gemma not killed Polly then Stahl never could've framed her, Cameron never would have kidnapped Abel and the club never would have left and let zobelle escape."
Sonsofanarchy,303edl,HCPage,2,Wed Mar 25 18:28:41 2015 UTC,"It's insane how much Gemma's decisions affected the Sons and Jax. She did this and then these ten terrible things happen, it's a common theme that's not always easy to recognize when you're deep in the show actually watching. It hits you later that she was basically the bane of Jax's existence."

Sonsofanarchy,3028yr,fernando_69,4,Sat Apr 18 06:19:52 2015 UTC,"I've spent a lot of time on this actually, because I am planning to write a fanfic giving a backstory to various characters (Chibs and Juice are first).  For Juice we know that his dad was never around because left when he was young and this effected Juice. His mom was probably just not a good mom for whatever reason and Juice was one of those kids that needed a ""firm"" hand because he WILL get into trouble, so Juice was a difficult child to parent and the only parent he had wasn't up to the task. He is Puerto Rican but doesn't speak Spanish, probably no extended family in the city with them, just him and his mom (and his sister). I'm assuming that his sister is MUCH older than him and that they aren't close at all because Juice claimed to have no family, but Gemma mentioned him having a sister that he hasn't spoken to in years.  Juice, being Juice, was probably one of those kids that felt the fault of his broken family was on him, that he caused daddy to leave and its his fault that his mom doesn't love him. This guilt haunted him always.  Maybe his mom died when he was a school kid and he wound up a ward of the state--Inherently mischievous he was always a trouble maker and as he got older he fell in deeper trouble gangs. I have no idea how he made the jump from the East Coast to the West, but I'm guessing he did it after he was grown and on his own."

Sonsofanarchy,2zaqcx,WWJaxD1973,2,Tue Mar 17 21:06:26 2015 UTC,It was also around this time that Ron was getting pissy and making comments about how much of a mainstream actor he is and how he was doing major motion pictures and getting top billing and now he is just doing some random TV show. Even though it was most tongue in cheek there was a hint of seriousness in it. Until the point where Clay was being banished Ron was getting top bill but after that he was being relegated to supporting cast. I believe it did grate on him a bit.

They (in the earlier seasons) actually help their town to keep it free of drugs and other bad shit.  Also they do shit like the blooddrive and other charity events. If they were 1% they wouldn't do that.   I was wrong, but I have remembered something. A while ago someone from an actual motorcycle club posted to this sub and someone asked him about 1%. He said it was more of a members choice thing instead of a club choice. Also, if you google Hells Angels in images you'll notice many of them don't carry the 1% patch, although I don't think you have to have the actual patch.  That's mostly assumptions. But it makes sense to me."

Sonsofanarchy,2z88yy,autowikibot,3,Mon Mar 16 18:26:35 2015 UTC,See above... 1% are the 1% of bikers that live by their own set of rules and do what they feel they need to do in any given situation without much regard for the law.    Basically the 1% patch is a target for you though.  If a cop see's 1% he may be more likely to pull you over and make sure things are on the up and up... Of course usually they aren't so having a 1% patch could be a problem if you're holding or carrying.  This is very much a theory and I'm by no means a 1%er.  People tend to think of Bikers as less intelligent however they are very smart and calculated that's why a lot of guys stopped wearing that 1% patch because they realized it wasn't smart to announce that you are a badass.

Outlaw and one-percenter of article  American Motorcyclist Association:       The AMA was a whites-only organization from its inception in 1924 until the 1950s, not allowing blacks to join for its first 30 years.  Prior to the acceptance of black members, the term outlaw motorcycle club could refer to either a white counterculture biker club that was ""uninterested in 'square' events and competitions"", or else a club that accepted non-white members and was therefore not allowed to participate in the AMA.  In 1995, AMA President Ed Youngblood said that as a consequence of this racist policy, blacks continued to be underrepresented in AMA events for decades after the segregationist policy was rescinded.

Sonsofanarchy,2z4nmw,DrWhoisOverRated,13,Sun Mar 15 15:40:56 2015 UTC,"For those interested in 'The First 9'       JT - Vet:  John Teller was the founder and President of SAMCRO. Murdered by Clay Morrow and Gemma Teller Morrow. First husband of Gemma Teller Morrow and father of Jackson Teller, Thomas Teller, and Trinity Ashby.     Clay - Vet:  Clay was one of the First 9, but not a ""founding member"". In the season 4 episode, ""Family Recipe"", Clay mentions that Piney sponsored him when he was originally patched into the club in 1972. Clay became the president of SAMCRO after John Teller's death, and remained so until he was ousted by Jax in the season 4 finale, ""To Be, Act 2"". Clay was the last of the First 9 to join. Clay Morrow is personally responsible for the deaths of three (that we know about thus far) of the First 9: Piney Winston, J.T. Teller and Keith McGee.     Piney - Vet:  One of the co-founders of SAMCRO along with his best friend, John Teller. Piney was the father of SAMCRO member Opie Winston. He was murdered by Clay Morrow in Season 4 after attempting to blackmail him to stop moving drugs.     Lenny The Pimp - Vet  He was the 3rd member to join the Sons of Anarchy MC. He is the former Sergeant-at-Arms under John Teller. Currently imprisoned at Stockton State Prison for allegedly killing three ATF agents. Lenny had served in Vietnam at the same time JT and Piney were. They were in different outfits, but met up after missions. After his return stateside, he was disappointed like the others, not being able to find work, or be accepted into college. Despite his obsession with body building, he succumbed to his two pack a day cigarette habit and contracted throat cancer, resulting in his voice box (larynx) being removed. Portrayed by Hells Angels member Sonny Barger.     Keith McGee - Vet:  After being a founding member of SAMCRO, Keith moved to Belfast where he became the President of the club's Belfast charter, SAMBEL. He was killed by Clay Morrow in Season 3 for betraying the club.     Wally Grazer:  He was the 5th member of the Sons of Anarchy MC in 1968. A drifter by choice by the time he hooked up with SOA, he already had deep connections to every nitty and gritty part of Redwood County. He was a valuable asset. Committed suicide in 1986.     Thomas ""Uncle Tom"" Whitney:  He became the 6th member of the Sons of Anarchy MC, after Wally Grazer introduced him to the club. He holds the unofficial record for ""most stolen anything"" in the SOA lore. Stabbed to death in prison in 1995.     Chico Vellenueva:  Chico was the daredevil of SOA. He first met the MC in 1968. Chico was the first Hispanic member of SOA and provided them with a liaison between the Mayans and SOA. Died in 1976.     Otto ""Lil' Killer"" Moran:  Joined club in 1968. Found floating in the river in 1985, foul play suspected. He was 5'7 on a good day and got the nickname 'Lil' Killer' because it is rumored he once killed a 300lb man with his bare hands during a fist fight."

But clubs are full of vets.  I heard one person try to explain it like this.  If you think about a small military unit, like a squad or platoon, it's a small group of guys.  They (mostly) live together, form lasting friendships, (sometimes) risk their lives to gether, and face general hardships.  It forms a special kind of bond. I read ""at Pelilu with the old breed"", he said combat friendships are stronger than real brotherhood.  Now, when you get out of the military (at least my experience) you're almost instantly and completely cut off from that group/life style/social network.  You normally move far away, the group moves on and so do you.  Enter the MC.  Nearly perfectly matches the social structure and environment in the military.  I definately noticed it."

I am glad you asked this question as I am going to update the WiKi for the series with this link.  Careful on that page, spoilers everywhere.  Clay:  Morrow was born in 1949 (whereabouts unknown, although as of season 4, he had been a resident of Charming, California for ""31 years""). In 1968, he was one of nine members who were invited to join the Sons of Anarchy Motorcycle Club. He was the youngest of the first nine, and one of only three who were not war veterans. He did later go on to serve in the military, however, joining the Army Airborne in 1969 and serving in Vietnam until 1972. He commemorates his service with a tattoo on his left arm and by displaying the parachutist badge on his vest.  When he returned from Vietnam, he reconnected with the club and was patched in. He and John Teller, the club President, opened the Teller-Morrow auto shop. He went to N. Ireland, along with JT and Keith, in the mid-80's, because of IRA trouble in Keith's home town, of Shortstrand, a suburb of Belfast. He was the one who pushed for the gun running business back in the U.S., while JT was more opposed, than for it. He was responsible for a number of murders during the SAMCRO-Mayan War, that started in the early 90's. One of his victims was Lowell Harland, Sr., a mechanic at the auto shop who became an ATF informant.   On his cut, he wears patches reading ""President"", ""First 9"", ""Unholy Ones"" and ""Men of Mayhem"". He has formerly served an unspecified prison term. His last criminal conviction prior to the series beginning, was at least seven years. He states to Agent Stahl, that he hasn't been charged with anything gun related, or otherwise for that long. It could be assumed that his prior conviction was gun related, as other members had similar convictions around the same time.       JT:  John Teller was the founder and President of SAMCRO. Murdered by Clay Morrow and Gemma Teller Morrow. First husband of Gemma Teller Morrow and father of Jackson Teller, Thomas Teller, and Trinity Ashby.     Piney:  One of the co-founders of SAMCRO along with his best friend, John Teller. Piney was the father of SAMCRO member Opie Winston. He was murdered by Clay Morrow in Season 4 after attempting to blackmail him to stop moving drugs.     Lenny The Pimp  He was the 3rd member to join the Sons of Anarchy MC. He is the former Sergeant-at-Arms under John Teller. Currently imprisoned at Stockton State Prison for allegedly killing three ATF agents. Lenny had served in Vietnam at the same time JT and Piney were. They were in different outfits, but met up after missions. After his return stateside, he was disappointed like the others, not being able to find work, or be accepted into college. Despite his obsession with body building, he succumbed to his two pack a day cigarette habit and contracted throat cancer, resulting in his voice box (larynx) being removed. Portrayed by Hells Angels member Sonny Barger.     Keith McGee:  After being a founding member of SAMCRO, Keith moved to Belfast where he became the President of the club's Belfast charter, SAMBEL. He was killed by Clay Morrow in Season 3 for betraying the club.     Wally Grazer:  He was the 5th member of the Sons of Anarchy MC in 1968. A drifter by choice by the time he hooked up with SOA, he already had deep connections to every nitty and gritty part of Redwood County. He was a valuable asset. Committed suicide in 1986.     Thomas ""Uncle Tom"" Whitney:  He became the 6th member of the Sons of Anarchy MC, after Wally Grazer introduced him to the club. He holds the unofficial record for ""most stolen anything"" in the SOA lore. Stabbed to death in prison in 1995.     Chico Vellenueva:  Chico was the daredevil of SOA. He first met the MC in 1968. Chico was the first Hispanic member of SOA and provided them with a liaison between the Mayans and SOA. Died in 1976.     Otto ""Lil' Killer"" Moran:  Joined club in 1968. Found floating in the river in 1985, foul play suspected. He was 5'7 on a good day and got the nickname 'Lil' Killer' because it is rumored he once killed a 300lb man with his bare hands during a fist fight.   a."

In COC and UCOD meetings (where most of the clubs from the area get together to work things out/schedule stuff) we say the pledge.  Most bikers are patriots (pretty sure).    I think the mentality of most is more like nationalism not patriotism (as in the Cpt America sense).  And just because we (they) choose to 'live outside the law' it doesn't mean we think it's evil (note: I didn't say bad).    It's why there is a very clear distinction between a member of a club and a civilian.

Wendy was clean and becoming the mother she always could be, which should have helped Jax some. Not to mention the fact that Nero was stepping in as a truly positive mentor, there was reason for Jax to have hope."
Sonsofanarchy,2yzllm,leoooooooooooo,7,Sat Mar 14 04:37:39 2015 UTC,He was also voted to meet Mr Mayham for his actions and he didnt want to put that on his brothers
Sonsofanarchy,2yzllm,MickeyG42,24,Sat Mar 14 11:47:53 2015 UTC,"No there wasn't. He was poison and he knew it. He couldn't change, he was too far gone. The intended read is just that. Yeah a happy ending worth a white fence and jax and what raising the kids would have been great but if you want that brother you watched the wrong show."
Sonsofanarchy,2yzllm,Deep_In_Thought,8,Sat Mar 14 04:57:53 2015 UTC,"I guess let me change tactic here. I understand his belief that he was 'too far gone' and 'poison' for his children.  But isn't the decision to end his life via suicide, instead of trying to be the father that JT never got to be...rather selfish? Doesn't it fly in the face of everything Tara tried to do for him and his kids? Everything JT tried to teach him via his writings?  With the all of the religious metaphors, the open armed smile and embrace of death... I know we are meant to feel that Jax was dying a 'heroic death'. But it felt hollow instead. He gave up.  A cut to black as the semi rounded the bend, and then Jax smiling would have been more preferable to me. At least there is the 'what if' factor involved."
Sonsofanarchy,2yzllm,Deep_In_Thought,12,Sat Mar 14 05:09:55 2015 UTC,"Trust me, you would have hated a what if ending to this scenario.   Yes, in essence Jax committed suicide. But it wasn't for the pursuit of dying a ""Heroic Death"".   So, only two people acted as Jax's moral compass, two people who kept him grounded, in reality and in life - Opie and Tara. Jax came a little unhinged when Opie died and then Tara dying was the last straw. He went on a free fall downward spiral, consumed by rage and the idea of revenge and those thoughts were fueled by his mother.  He had come to realize that he had tried to leave the club behind many times and yet he ended up right there at the club house. No matter how hard he tried, he just couldn't walk away.   Instead of dying a Heroic death, Jax tied up all the loose ends for the club and took the fall for all those things that needed to be done for the good of the club so that it could continue, just like Opie had sacrificed himself in the penitentiary for SAMCRO. And he finally broke the chains and got his kids away from the toxic environment he grew up in and just couldn't leave.   Hope this helps."
Sonsofanarchy,2yzllm,Kopannie,2,Sat Mar 14 05:40:17 2015 UTC,"Oh it definitely helps, thanks for taking the time to reply. When you got the end of the finale, what were your initial thoughts on how the show wrapped up?"
Sonsofanarchy,2yzllm,chiefjaycee,8,Sat Mar 14 05:45:37 2015 UTC,"To be honest, I called Jax was going to die as soon as Sutter killed Tara at the end of Season 6. It was the writing on the wall and the fact that Sutter has always said that this show was a tragedy kinda hinted at it too.   What I didn't guess was how bad things would get cuz Jax was on the warpath and if he would end up finding if Gemma was her wife's killer.  But the end, Jax finding a way to take all the heat onto himself and absolve the club was sorta genius, his last ride on his father's bike was a touch of class and the moment when Jax finally realises that he's free from everything was brilliant."

Sonsofanarchy,2yzllm,TheOneTrueJeebus,1 point,Sat Mar 14 08:53:24 2015 UTC,"Sutter wasted at least 5 episodes in the final season, fillers if you will. Rushed  killings of main characters and an awful religious tie-in. His arms up straight when he was going into the truck along with the bread and wine on the roadside pointed at jax being jesus, deing for our sins. I was really disappointed in the final season under utilised actors and slow build up to a crammed finally really passed me off"
Sonsofanarchy,2yzllm,CSMom74,2,Sat Mar 14 18:24:36 2015 UTC,"He would have been in prison  for one.  Killed several people that last day or so.  Including Gemma, Unser, the old dirty cop, August Mark and his guy.  He would have been killed in prison on day 1.   Wendy was barely clean.  Yeah she's doing better, but she wouldn't have been strong enough to fight the club's influence.  Tara wasn't.    Like he said to Nero, he needs his sons to know who and what he was.  A killer.  They can't ever look up to him.    And they needed to show the impact.  The closure was there.  Wouldn't have been a final end if we thought maybe moved in time and lived on the farm.    It would have been too ""Sopranos"" anyway."
Sonsofanarchy,2yzllm,TheOneTrueJeebus,2,Sat Mar 14 05:36:33 2015 UTC,"I guess I get that. But the only reason Jax was going to end up in prison was because he gave himself up. So i feel like we could take that off of the table, hypothetically speaking, if he had decided to try and be the father figure he himself had always needed."
Sonsofanarchy,2yzllm,DayZKiller,1 point,Sat Mar 14 05:43:25 2015 UTC,Do you mean that the cut to black would have been too similar to the Sopranos or the uncertainty? Because the ending of the Sopranos was clear once I thought about it for a day or two.
Sonsofanarchy,2yzllm,Tomcat1108,2,Sat Mar 14 11:37:22 2015 UTC,"both. I think it would have been too similar, but I also think they wanted to make it completely clear that he was dead, and not have people think about it to figure it out or have different opinions."

Sonsofanarchy,2yzllm,marryanowl,1 point,Sat Mar 14 14:17:03 2015 UTC,I actually read an interview with Sutter where he talked about potentially cutting to black at that point. He said that 'SOA had never been a show about 'what if'. In his words that ending didn't make any sense.
Sonsofanarchy,2yzllm,chaos122345,1 point,Sat Mar 14 17:42:05 2015 UTC,"Jax knew he was not a good man, he wanted his sons to grow up hating the thought of him. If he would have stayed then there would have been a chance for Abel and Thomas to get caught in te club."
Sonsofanarchy,2yzllm,mysql101,4,Sat Mar 14 13:00:43 2015 UTC,Jax killed an MC president. The club voted for him to meet Mr. Mayhem. Jax had to die. He took his own life in order to save his guys from having to kill him.
Sonsofanarchy,2yzllm,monsieurjerreh,3,Sat Mar 14 14:34:37 2015 UTC,He made the only choice that would save his club and his sons. If he didn't kill August Marks all of his friends would be murdered. If he ran away with his boys they would all be dead. If he killed August and fled with his kids they would all be fugitives running and hiding his whole life and his sons wouldn't have a normal life. Not to mention the fact that by clubs standards he had to die so you would of had other charters with a bounty on his head.   If he stayed after saving his club they would of been forced to kill him or he would be sent to jail where he would of gotten killed by black for retaliation on Marks or his own club who ruled for Mr mayhem.  It wasn't just about him being too far in it was about sacrificing himself for his club and his kids.
Sonsofanarchy,2yzllm,thewackjob,3,Sat Mar 14 17:16:18 2015 UTC,The problem I with him killing himself is that his father died too and he still ended up joining the club. I think Grandma planted the seed in his son's hand when she handed him the ring.
Sonsofanarchy,2yzllm,ItsThatKush,3,Sat Mar 14 14:33:25 2015 UTC,"Also every choice he made in season 6 and 7 was selfish and the entire events that unfolded no longer mattered.  In season 6 he ruined relationships, and killed a bunch of people because he wanted to free his wife from her burden with torric. But in the end he just confessed and nothing mattered. Had he done that from the start, tara would be alive, the club would have been fine and all the deaths and chaos that season with the IRA and Chinese could have been avoided. Jax even set up to leave and pass it down to chibs.  In season 7, jax stayed as president and went on a rampage also ruining relations with marcs for no reason, hurting the club by killing jury(which he only did because he insulted his father) and going after the Chinese blindly. And then in the end, he ended up choosing to murder his mother and then killing himself. So nothing he did mattered. He probably fucked the club over by betraying the IRA and killing a king. They went after samcro last time why wouldn't they again?  Jax chose to die, because he knew he failed. He was a failure as a husband, a failure as a father, a failure as a son, a failure as a president and a failure as a friend to Nero (by killing gemma). Jax could of chose several different outs, but ultimately chose death, where he no longer could hurt anyone ever again. Thats why he didnt let the club kill him, and confessed that he killed jury. It freed them from that burden. He sent wendy and the kids with nero where they would never be near him again and nero could look after them. He didnt want his kids to know him or see him as a good person."
Sonsofanarchy,2yzllm,CreepyAbelTeller,1 point,Wed Mar 18 04:12:26 2015 UTC,"His dad's death and his writings and desire to change the club did nothing to remediate the situation or keep Jax out of the club.   I suspect his death won't keep his kids out either, especially with the writers predisposition for putting the protagonists in terrible situations."
Sonsofanarchy,2yzllm,AUGsThoughts,10,Sat Mar 14 12:06:45 2015 UTC,"As everyone is saying, Jax knew he couldn't leave the club, and that not being able to do so would cause his sons to fall into the same situation.  But there's more to it as well. Firstly, he'd done too much damage to the club and its relationships throughout the last season that needed to somehow be fixed. The club had gotten into a REALLY tight spot thanks to him, so he cleaned it all up by killing those who were a threat to the club at the end, but wanted those deaths to land on him, not the club.   But more importantly, Jax killing Jury created massive internal tension within SOA charters. (My memory of these events isn't 100% so forgive me if I get something wrong.) When Jax came clean to the other presidents about him being mistaken about Jury, and thus killing him for essentially no reason, Mayhem was the only option. Jax needed to die to maintain peace between charters, which is why he made sure SAMCRO voted Mayhem. He didn't want his mistakes to fuck up the club he loved. But he also knew that nobody in the club wanted the burden of killing him, and he wouldn't have liked the idea of dying like that, so he took it into his own hands and created his own fate instead (something he has wanted for himself since the start of the show.)"
Sonsofanarchy,2yzllm,JoeShmoe99,10,Sat Mar 14 06:23:35 2015 UTC,I don't think anyone has mentioned the mayhem vote that applied to Jax for killing Jury. He chose to go out as he did rather than take a bullet from the club he called family. It's more of Jax going out on his terms rather than the club's. No matter what Jax was a dead man.
Sonsofanarchy,2yzllm,UTLRev1312,1 point,Sat Mar 14 12:33:41 2015 UTC,"yep, exactly what I was going to say."
Sonsofanarchy,2yzllm,redfoxst38,2,Sat Mar 14 15:15:28 2015 UTC,"Yes, he did make the ultimate selfish decision. But it wasn't exactly a bad decision - which is saying a lot considering most of his decisions ARE selfish and generally terrible. I don't necessarily agree with the decision but I also don't see how he could have lived to see another day. He's Hamlet. He's got to go.  Jax was ridden with too much guilt and remorse by the end. It started with Opie's death (which began the rip) but ultimately, Tara's death is what destroyed it. Gemma may have plunged the fork in the back of her head, but the guilt of her death lay at Jax's feet. Like he tells Nero in the end when he's setting up the house and TM to be given to Wendy, he's doing what he should have done while his wife was still alive. He knew he should have walked away when Tara asked him to in Season 4 and/or 5. Yet, he chose the club (selfishly) over and over again. He was in too deep. Moving the club in a legitimate direction was never going to make the club a safe space and was never going to truly make him a good man. I think he says as much to Nero in the last episode, something about how he tried to run away from the truth by making things more legitimate but it was all a cover. Even if he tried to leave the club, he would still operate by club mentality (i.e. bashing Ima's head in to fix a problem-- like Bobby told Jax, that's the way he's wired and he can't change). This is in short saying, there is NO saving the club and by extension, no saving himself (especially not without his moral and ethical anchor - Tara - around). They are career criminals. They will never be legitimate professionals who operate by normal society standards. Their decisions and actions will always be soaked in violence and criminality. And furthermore, he had the blood of his sons' mother on his hands - Tara - and he had just killed his own mother for what she did to Tara. So, there wasn't really any way he was going to live to see his sons grow up and still be a sane, functioning human - let alone, a father. By removing what he believed was the real toxin, himself, he thought he would be giving his children a chance at a normal life (good luck, Creepy Abel!).   The only thing that really bothered me was that at no point in time did he actually renounce the club. I get that it couldn't really happen - he was in too deep and the club was all he had left, but this was the thing that killed his best friend, wife, father and surrogate father (Piney). Riding off with your patch and still a member of the club seemed a little crass to me if he had truly learned a lesson -- and which is why I never understood the whole ""sorry the family I was given has created so much chaos in the family I've chosen."" The family he was given was terrible (Gemma and co) but the club had created so much chaos in his life as well. Classy guy."
Sonsofanarchy,2yzllm,CatherineWright89,2,Sat Mar 14 15:29:58 2015 UTC,"He wanted to protect his sons from all the chaos that comes with being in the club. He wants everything that could influence the kids to join removed from the world, including Gemma and himself."
Sonsofanarchy,2yzllm,LaV-Man,1 point,Sun Mar 15 00:39:59 2015 UTC,That's interesting. I always thought him killing Gemma was just revenge for Tara. But you're right - killing Gemma was just another way of cutting the boys' ties to the club and making sure they wouldn't end up in SoA. Gemma giving the ring to Abel would've been a big shock to Jax.
Sonsofanarchy,2yzllm,CatherineWright89,2,Tue Mar 17 16:50:44 2015 UTC,"jax killed jury, another chapter president, and the club bylaws meant he had to meet mr. mayhem (the scene in the warehouse, when the rest of SAMCRO see him for the last time). but they were in on it, faked his escape, and let him go finish what he had to do...but he still had to die no matter what."
Sonsofanarchy,2yzllm,redfoxst38,2,Sun Mar 15 00:55:09 2015 UTC,Jax was pretty harsh on Wendy.  He was just as addicted to the club and it ultimately caused more harm.
Sonsofanarchy,2yzllm,LaV-Man,2,Mon Mar 16 20:46:05 2015 UTC,"I think it was a beautiful ending. Jax's main priorities were his boys, Tara and the club. He lost Tara, He damaged the club so bad trying to get revenge for Tara, then found out all his destruction was based on a lie. He did everything he could to fix it and he did it fearlessly. He wasn't worried about the consequences because he had already decided his fate. He had to kill his own mother, which is something he couldn't live with, but he wouldn't have been able to let her live after killing Tara and ruining his club, and losing bobby because of the lies she told, and she hurt Abel, He could see that the life he had had already damaged Abel. He was fighting at school and cutting himself because of the horrible truth he knew. He wanted to make sure that the life Gemma forced on him was not forced on his boys, and nothing could hurt Abel and Thomas anymore. Where JT left the manuscript, and spoke to Jax from the dead, basically instructing him to do all the things he wanted to do, Jax burned everything. He didn't want the boys to hero worship him, and aspire to be like him. He was being entirely selfless, He left the boys with Nero as the fatherly influence in their lives, and Wendy as a mother who wants the boys away from the life because she has seen what it does to people. Giving the boys to Wendy was honouring Tara's wish that she fought to the death for. He couldn't leave SAMCRO- he would have left with Tara but he had no life outside charming without Tara. In my opinion he ended everything right, with all the little metaphors laced into the episode, I think it was a perfect end for both the show and Jax."
Sonsofanarchy,2yzllm,LaV-Man,2,Sat Mar 14 15:21:38 2015 UTC,"I agree completely.  Still, a part of me wanted the ""Conan, sitting on the throne"" ending for Jax."
Sonsofanarchy,2yzllm,petalsforgems,2,Wed Mar 25 13:05:01 2015 UTC,"I wanted a happy ending all the way through, I wanted Jax, Tara and the boys driving away in a car singing songs with all their stuff strapped to the top of the car!   I realised pretty early on that SAMCRO members don't get happy endings. I still held onto that hope though till the end of season six when I was the most upset I have ever been about a tv show. After that end I had a tinge of hope that Jax would leave in a car with the boys, maybe not singing cos he'd be sad about Tara, but escaping whole, and I do think that if the club respected the wishes he had to kill himself, they would have allowed him to leave if he wanted. I knew that wouldn't happen though, he was to broken and angry to leave the violence.   I think a lot of people are slating the end and calling it a cop out. I'm a massive fan of metaphors. I love hidden meanings... I think it was a true Shakespearean tragedy ending like Sutter always hinted it would be.   And the song come join the murder was spectacular. All the hidden meanings in that are genius. Potentially my current favourite song, joint with day is gone.   :)"
Sonsofanarchy,2yzllm,MicOxlong,1 point,Wed Mar 25 21:33:25 2015 UTC,"I feel this way too.  Sacrifice would be standing up, leaving his brothers and raising his kids.  An outcast with blacked out ink working a crappy job so his kids would have a better life.  Denying his dark nature and providing for his sons is heroic.  Setting his club up, killing people, committing suicide and leaving your kids fatherless is expected.  I still love the show more than any other ever.  I am also learning to like the ending."
Sonsofanarchy,2yzllm,MrsFisher,1 point,Mon Mar 16 20:44:35 2015 UTC,"It's about the nature of the club.  This is what the club does to you.  It takes everything from you.  They even say this at some point in the series.    Basically, it's because the club demands that you put the club first.  Think about Gemma, she is dedicated to the club 100%.  It costs her every bit of her family.    It's the message of the whole series."

He knew he had tried to get out but he could never truly leave. Also he knew that the boys would end up the same fate as him. Also after Tara and all the chaos he had done with that, he knew he messed up and needed to pay. Thats what the vote for Jax to meet Mr.Mayhem but he decided to go out like JT."

Sucks I'm a little late but I'm glad I checked out the sub and saw this. Just to confirm we are watching the show finale tomorrow at 9? Then a lovely discussion on here. Then next week we will pick up on season 1 finale? Exited to get into this.  Edit: just saw the newest announcement. See you all on Tuesday for the discussion on season one finale.

Sonsofanarchy,2yw5k3,BillNyeStillHigh,16,Fri Mar 13 08:56:07 2015 UTC,"Regardless, your point still stands. All he had to do was tell the club he was half black. It was proven later on when Chibbs eventually found out that it was really no big deal. Yes, it's in the by-laws but they dont have to choose to enforce it if they don't want to.   Most of Juice's problems stemmed from how he just reacted instead of thinking most of the time. I don't think he was cut out of the life of an Outlaw."
Sonsofanarchy,2yw5k3,mschmitt1217,9,Fri Mar 13 15:56:46 2015 UTC,"All he had to do was tell the club he was half black.   Chibs relieved him, but until then, for all he knew, he could lose his patch for being half-black, even be killed.  Juice was a stupid lost boy, but what Potter and Roosevelt did was really sinister."
Sonsofanarchy,2yw5k3,besyuziki,5,Fri Mar 13 20:55:07 2015 UTC,"Agree totally. His stupidity mixed with Potter's ""ambition"" we'll call it and Roosevelt's quest for power definitely hurt Juice.  But taking it a step further, Jax basically gave him an out for that. If he didn't alert Nero about Darvinny (spelling?) he would have been okay. That was really stupid, and for a show that revels in self preservation..Juice really proved time and time again he was a liability.   However SPOILER"
Sonsofanarchy,2yw5k3,mschmitt1217,3,Fri Mar 13 21:00:49 2015 UTC,"To me though even as just a fan of the show, who in the club would you possibly picture in wanting to throw out or especially to kill a member of the club who had been through so much with them over having one of his parents be black?  Certainly not Chibs, certainly not Jax, not Happy, not Bobby, and even hard to imagine Tig or Clay having an issue with it.  Juice should have known those guys well enough to know none of them were that heavily racist."
Sonsofanarchy,2yw5k3,billy8383,3,Tue Mar 17 05:38:55 2015 UTC,"Hindsight is always 20/20.  For all Juice knew, SAMCRO regarded him as a Puerto Rican guy from Queens, they didn't know about his father.  You made some great points, of course they weren't racist but with the ""no blacks"" by-law Juice couldn't know what they would do to him for being half-black and hiding it from his outlaw club, where every leak compromises the whole organization... before Chibs said paperwork is the only thing that counts."
Sonsofanarchy,2yw5k3,besyuziki,5,Tue Mar 17 10:49:53 2015 UTC,"WRT telling everyone he's half black-   He did talk to Chibs about his feelings regarding antiquated bylaws. Chibs said the rules had to be followed, no matter what. Given that this is not an organization known for sweetness and subtlety, I can understand being hesitant about bringing up the fact you knowingly violated the club's rules."
Sonsofanarchy,2yw5k3,mschmitt1217,1 point,Mon Mar 16 01:10:41 2015 UTC,"There's a big difference between Juice probing for information on black membership by-laws, and coming out and telling Chibbs he is black. Chibbs, in my opinion, would have had no issue had Juice been open with him from the jump."
Sonsofanarchy,2yw5k3,mschmitt1217,3,Mon Mar 16 13:34:47 2015 UTC,"It's easy to say that in retrospect. Remember, Juice would have been risking a lot if he'd misjudged the amount of support he'd get.   The best analogy I can make is that it's like coming out in the military in the DADT-era. You have no defense against anyone who wants to respond badly, and have to hope that everyone's going to be OK with it. So you try to weigh every interaction you've had in your head, to try to figure out if it's safe."
Sonsofanarchy,2yw5k3,leemaho,1 point,Mon Mar 16 19:30:57 2015 UTC,"I can't disagree it would be easier to say in retrospect, but I also can't agree that he'd be risking anything more than he was going with the plan he rolled with. Being black would not be a death sentence in the club. That isn't retrospect speaking. Worst case, he loses his patch (worse than death? maybe to him).  He steals coke from the cartel and is an informant not only does he lose his patch, he dies as well. He's looked at as a rat and someone that would be a (pardon the pun) black mark on the charter.   Really no matter which way you spin it, Juice was a moron. A pretty good character all in all with a lot of depth, but a moron."
Sonsofanarchy,2yw5k3,wvtarheel,2,Mon Mar 16 20:42:40 2015 UTC,"We know he risked losing his patch, which is clearly shown to be a huge deal to him.   We also know that, much as we enjoy watching their antics, the club IS violent when enforcing their will. This is not a zero-risk situation for him. To simply say, ""He should have said that he was half black,"" is to ignore the years he spent clearly afraid to tell the club. In all that time, he consciously hid his ethnicity. That sort of says something about the emotional starting ground for the whole situation."
Sonsofanarchy,2yw5k3,billy8383,6,Mon Mar 16 21:14:37 2015 UTC,I believe the Feds were testing the coke to make sure it matched the coke being sold by the cartel. So any coke off the street wouldn't have gotten the job fined or him
Sonsofanarchy,2yw5k3,CreepyAbelTeller,6,Fri Mar 13 11:59:13 2015 UTC,"Except the club knew exactly who was moving the cartel coke stateside.  The Mayans were selling it on the street, and the club was well aware of that.  Would it have been so hard for juice (who obtained drugs for Jax and others at various points in the series) to have contacted the mayans and bought from them?  At that point, it would have been cut with filler, but all Juice has to do is lie and say they cut some for personal use and he brought that."

Sonsofanarchy,2yu8dv,talidrow,2,Thu Mar 12 21:22:05 2015 UTC,On a related note; how does this sub feel about the Wendy character?
Sonsofanarchy,2yu8dv,PuffaTheAllmighty,3,Thu Mar 12 21:28:26 2015 UTC,"She joins Jarry as the opposite of what Gemma/Tara (and even Venus) represented which was for the most part well written, fleshed out female characters who, despite all of the pulpy violence and questionable decisions, felt like real people. Not a diss on Drea who is a good actor when given decent material but Wendy had no real purpose. The show wouldn't have been any different had she been killed off or had disappeared to rehab for all 7 seasons. Yes, she got the kids away from Charming in the end but she wasn't the driving force behind that - in fact, Nero taking the boys away with his son would have been just as effective. I already wrote about this but my main issue with the way Wendy was written was that she was supposedly this weak junkie who found her way to sobriety. She had to leave that world to find peace. So, when she comes back in Season 6, I thought she would finally get back at Jax/Gemma (when she was plotting with Tara) OR do something that would prove her constant harping about getting to know Abel would actually go somewhere but that was ultimately a pointless arc that led to nothing. She spent the last few eps of Season 6 high on her couch. She backed out of Tara's plan as quickly as she went from being a lesbian to confessing her love for Jax. She acted like all she wanted was to be a part of Abel's life but she spent most of Season 7 waiting for Jax to notice her. It almost felt like Creepy Abel was a consolation prize. She lectured Tara on several occasions about how Charming is the worst place ever and she needs to leave with the boys, yet she tells Brooke in Season 7 that she feels more comfortable in Jax's house now than ever before (which is also a pretty shitty thing to say considering someone was just murdered there a few weeks ago). It felt like 6 seasons of Wendy were erased and Season 7 birthed Saint Wendy. It made no sense. Sutter really failed writing her a reasonable and believable arc."
Sonsofanarchy,2yu8dv,CreepyAbelTeller,3,Thu Mar 12 23:59:08 2015 UTC,"I'm ambivalent, personally. She's one of damn few people who had an overall positive character arc from episode one to the end of the series, but there were a lot of times where her actions just didn't make any sense. I blame that on the writing, though, not the character."
Sonsofanarchy,2yu8dv,gizmatic,1 point,Thu Mar 12 21:31:52 2015 UTC,Wendy has fans? As in...plural?  Who knew?
Sonsofanarchy,2yra98,Mjredmonkey,15,Thu Mar 12 03:34:08 2015 UTC,It was deserved. The hardest scene for me (spoiler) was Jax saying goodbye to his boys.
Sonsofanarchy,2yra98,angerdome,5,Thu Mar 12 04:31:25 2015 UTC,"Being a new father (Five month old Daughter snoring next to me as I type ..okay, so it might be her momma snoring, but I'll get in trouble if i say that ...) watching Jax interact with his boys, knowing damn well he wasn't going to ever see them again ... gutted me in a level no show has ever come close to.  Before that, the brutality of Opie's death caused me to stop watching for the longest time. I think it was the racial tone, used, that caused me great issue to. It made me think about society and our differences ... but that's what Sutter does. Right?  He makes us cheer for the bad guy then reminds us these are monsters, then we feel bad for loving these monsters, etc."
Sonsofanarchy,2yra98,CMFunk69,2,Tue Mar 17 06:10:06 2015 UTC,Just watched the finale last night and haven't teared up like that from a show in a long time....  That scene and the whole ending montage with that awesome song...
Sonsofanarchy,2yra98,Ultyma,8,Wed Mar 18 13:47:10 2015 UTC,"Eh, Clay's death was coming for a long time. It was prolonged for far too long. Yes, he became more and more sympathetic (and my anger was more directed towards Gemma by that point) but I felt like he was just dragged around in Season 6 aimlessly. Even Pearlman wasn't happy with it.  The saddest scene without question - IMO - is when Jax finds Tara's body on their kitchen floor. His wail at the end is heartbreaking. The entire park scene and the hotel scene in the Season 6 finale are sad too but they end on a very hopeful note. But by the end of that episode, I felt like a tiny part of me had crumbled. Nothing before or after has reached the same level of anguish and sadness as that scene. The loss of Tara, the loss of that relationship and the loss of their love was just really really sad. I knew Jax had lost all humanity after that, so I just settled in for a very bloody Season 7."
Sonsofanarchy,2yra98,CreepyAbelTeller,6,Thu Mar 12 15:56:27 2015 UTC,Yeah Tara's death would've been that way for me too...had my fiancee not turned on the TV as the last bit of the episode was playing. I just saw Jax crying with a woman in his arms (obviously dead).  All I wanted was to watch it commercial-free on DVR....was that too much to ask?
Sonsofanarchy,2yra98,justmighthaveto,3,Thu Mar 12 16:40:29 2015 UTC,"Well now that it's on Netflix, you can relive the horror over and over again with no commercials. :)"
Sonsofanarchy,2yra98,CreepyAbelTeller,6,Thu Mar 12 21:23:31 2015 UTC,Saddest part for me is easily Tig watching his daughter get burnt alive.
Sonsofanarchy,2yra98,Jasonresno,5,Sun Mar 15 03:27:48 2015 UTC,"Unser's final moments, he was a hero to the end and he was never going to leave Gemma. He loved that woman more than any other relationship on the show."
Sonsofanarchy,2yra98,daft_goose,3,Mon Mar 16 19:28:57 2015 UTC,The whole final episode was hard for me.  Slightly ahead of Opie's last fight.
Sonsofanarchy,2yra98,travboy21,2,Thu Mar 12 05:06:48 2015 UTC,"I agree. There's no logical reason for this because it was deserved, but Clay was one of my favorite characters and it broke my heart. Gemma and I had the same reaction."
Sonsofanarchy,2yra98,Aguazul_,2,Thu Mar 12 23:50:03 2015 UTC,"Thank god no one said ""OMG WEN OPIE DIED"". Don't get me wrong. It was very sad saying goodbye to his character, but I feel people over exaggerate it just to sound like everyone else.   Now my opinion is JAX finding tara dead on the kitchen floor. You could see his soul tear apart as he realizes what is laying in front of him. The fact that she is murdered just after fixing his relationship with her was a turn no one saw coming. There's a few other great scenes, but I think this one has to take the proverbial cake."
Sonsofanarchy,2yra98,Adamadtr,1 point,Fri Mar 13 05:43:51 2015 UTC,"Agreed. It's true - you can pretty much see his soul torn apart. For most of the season, he was such a jackass that I gave up on feeling anything but intense dislike for him. But that entire episode made me feel everything from happiness to intense sadness for him. He went from making the biggest sacrifice of his life and finally choosing Tara over the club/his crazy mother to losing the one person who truly and purely loved him."

Sonsofanarchy,2yl9rk,cantthinkatall,2,Wed Mar 11 01:31:14 2015 UTC,"Well, we are going to watch at least the pilot tonight. Will let ya know ;)"

Sonsofanarchy,2yl9rk,besyuziki,8,Wed Mar 11 02:19:55 2015 UTC,Is it wrong how much I love seeing Otto smash her face?
Sonsofanarchy,2yl9rk,stacyo72,3,Wed Mar 11 01:43:07 2015 UTC,Not one bit. :)

Sonsofanarchy,2yl9rk,CreepyAbelTeller,3,Wed Mar 11 02:17:42 2015 UTC,I think this will be cool considering I wasn't even watching the show until recently. I just finished season 7 over the weekend btw. It's a great show!

Sonsofanarchy,2yl9rk,Alwaysthequiet1,2,Wed Mar 11 01:40:56 2015 UTC,These are the moments where Jax should have muff punched her.
Sonsofanarchy,2yl9rk,stacyo72,3,Wed Mar 11 02:27:52 2015 UTC,"My God Maggie is beautiful this season, just an absolute natural beauty with the longer hair. Before she went perma-bitch-face."
Sonsofanarchy,2yl9rk,stacyo72,7,Wed Mar 11 01:47:00 2015 UTC,"I agree, she's such a natural beauty. But I thought she had pretty epic bitch face in every season. The RBF became more prominent in later seasons. Made sense though - she hardened as Jax hardened. If Gemma was my surrogate mother/friend/mother in law/only person who I seemed to hang out with outside of Jax and the annoying ass redhead from the hospital, I would also adopt permanent bitch face."
Sonsofanarchy,2yl9rk,stacyo72,1 point,Wed Mar 11 02:23:22 2015 UTC,"I sadly suffer from RBF. It's a giant pain in the ass when people constantly ask you ""are you okay?"" or ""what's wrong?"" as for Maggie/Tara, I'd almost believe it's not RBF, but RGF (Resisting Gemma Face)"
Sonsofanarchy,2yl9rk,stacyo72,4,Wed Mar 11 22:43:22 2015 UTC,"Tig: You ever get high off this?  Piney: Its just oxygen...  Tig: No, I know, I know. Can't you turn it, like, way up...get that 'Blue Velvet' thing going?  Piney: What's the hell is wrong with him?  Bobby: The list is too long my friend.

Sonsofanarchy,2yl9rk,besyuziki,2,Wed Mar 11 01:18:02 2015 UTC,Another Minnesotan here. I think we may actually get a real spring this year!!!
Sonsofanarchy,2yl9rk,stacyo72,1 point,Wed Mar 11 02:59:16 2015 UTC,I know! I would be sooooo happy as that way all the bike trails won't be flooded from the 8 feet of snow melting and have stagnant water until August 1st.  Where in MN? I'm in the NW Burbs.
Sonsofanarchy,2yl9rk,TinaIsKillingItSOA11,2,Wed Mar 11 03:12:33 2015 UTC,Southeast burbs. My yard has no snow and no standing water. It's so weird after the last two winters. Not complaining though!
Sonsofanarchy,2yl9rk,slightlyobsessedSOA,2,Wed Mar 11 03:14:39 2015 UTC,"No water here, only snow is at the street level where the plows came by and considering the next 8 days weather, it will likely be gone tomorrow.

Sonsofanarchy,2yhbns,BeachCop,33,Mon Mar 9 20:39:03 2015 UTC,Haha just another way for Kurt Sutter to suck his own dick. But Otto was awesome
Sonsofanarchy,2yhbns,jboutte09,5,Mon Mar 9 21:58:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I liked Otto but I'm not sure how I feel about Sutter as an actor."
Sonsofanarchy,2yhbns,Scientifichuck,7,Tue Mar 10 07:36:04 2015 UTC,"Otto was awesome, I think he took the most punishment for the club in every worst way. He was loyal to the end."
Sonsofanarchy,2yhbns,blessedwithacurse,8,Mon Mar 9 22:53:01 2015 UTC,"Long time lurker but this is my first comment.  It was actually upsetting to see Otto the first time I rewatched the show.  He looked so normal...at least normal when compared to the rest of SAMCRO.  The physical, mental and emotional things he put up with for the club were incredible."
Sonsofanarchy,2yhbns,jps815,7,Mon Mar 9 23:24:32 2015 UTC,I can't say Otto was loyal to the end and won't expand on the because of potential spoilers.. But he was an awesome character and one of my favorites. His story was great and he took a shit ton of abuse for and from the club.
Sonsofanarchy,2yhbns,WWJaxD1973,6,Mon Mar 9 23:34:42 2015 UTC,"I was about to say the same thing.  He tip toed around full loyalty a couple of times, and by the time the story came around, he had set the whole Tara/Jax/Gemma dynamic into a tailspin."
Sonsofanarchy,2yhbns,SilentLurker,1 point,Tue Mar 10 11:43:45 2015 UTC,"That was one thing he set in motion. But what he did to Bobby was another thing that could have really set off a shit storm. And it wasn't over Bobby nailing her, it was over him lying about getting her killer. Why you rat is never as important as ratting in the first place."
Sonsofanarchy,2yhbns,WWJaxD1973,9,Tue Mar 10 16:50:20 2015 UTC,I felt bad for him but after SPOILER
Sonsofanarchy,2yhbns,CreepyAbelTeller,4,Tue Mar 10 00:36:19 2015 UTC,"Otto talked to all sorts of cops.... Like juice he done what was right at the end and went out a warriors death, but this doesnt change the fact they both talked to the cops."
Sonsofanarchy,2yhbns,Irish_Ent,-2,Tue Mar 10 08:34:36 2015 UTC,He stiill rattled. I get he changed his mind but he still ratted which I have no tolerance for.
Sonsofanarchy,2yhbns,Acpt7567,0,Tue Mar 10 04:12:46 2015 UTC,It didn't affect me but spoiler tags dude.
Sonsofanarchy,2yhbns,Scientifichuck,3,Tue Mar 10 07:35:38 2015 UTC,Who goes on a rewatch thread without being caught up? It's common sense...plus spoiler tags are only needed for S7.
Sonsofanarchy,2yhbns,Acpt7567,1 point,Tue Mar 10 08:25:33 2015 UTC,"Ah, didn't know that. Nevermind then my bad."
Sonsofanarchy,2yioty,Spinetablet,5,Tue Mar 10 03:08:46 2015 UTC,"Coates didn't get many scenes to display his acting prowess but this was one where he nailed it. An absent father watching his baby girl burned alive, while a lifetime of guilt, regret and sadness wash over him. It's like he's going through all of the stages of grief at once. It's a tremendous moment for Tiggy. I've never felt sorry for him until this scene. And yet, Pope was doing the ""same thing"" that had happened to his daughter - an eye for an eye. So crazy and heinous. Pope was the best/worst villain."
Sonsofanarchy,2yioty,CreepyAbelTeller,5,Tue Mar 10 16:21:54 2015 UTC,"Never understood why so many people criticize Kim's acting in this scene. It's perfectly in-character, full of guilt and regret, and a genuine response to seeing one's flesh and blood burned alive."
Sonsofanarchy,2yioty,besyuziki,15,Tue Mar 10 19:44:38 2015 UTC,"Really? I thought his acting was not great in this scene. ""Ohbabynopleaseohbaby."" I didn't find it convincing, which is weird because I LOVE Kim Coates."
Sonsofanarchy,2yioty,FashionablyFake,6,Tue Mar 10 03:12:21 2015 UTC,"To each his own, of course. But during this and while he was begging for Pope to release her, I could feel how horribly desperate he was. How much he was thinking about Veronica and Clay's lies. I don't know, I just thought it was great."
Sonsofanarchy,2yioty,FashionablyFake,5,Tue Mar 10 03:15:47 2015 UTC,"I agree that it was a very emotional scene, but it didn't hit me in the way that the end of season 6 did, or even gemma's reaction to that scene in the airplane hangar... I just feel like the depth wasn't there.   Although I've watched people die before so I feel like I'm more picky when it comes to actors reactions to death. If I don't feel it's a genuine reaction then I just kind of write it off. It's a weird quirk. I think he did an okay job, though. It just didn't hit me as much as some others."
Sonsofanarchy,2yioty,FashionablyFake,4,Tue Mar 10 03:19:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah when it comes to life, nothing compares at all. I've lost family before so this shit hits me as long as I see it done right. I thought, obviously only in my opinion, that it was done right. But I suppose that opens the window that what people react to on TV is down to personal experiences and how it hits home to different people."
Sonsofanarchy,2yioty,SpookyRED,3,Tue Mar 10 03:30:01 2015 UTC,"Exactly. I probably related to those other scenes more because I know what it's like to lose a significant other. I've never lost a child, or a mother or father, so it didn't hit me as hard."
Sonsofanarchy,2yioty,m-torr,4,Tue Mar 10 03:32:06 2015 UTC,"yeah his acting was way off on that scene, he had no idea how to act it at all"
Sonsofanarchy,2yioty,slightlyobsessedSOA,1 point,Tue Mar 10 11:10:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah I thought it was pretty bad, honestly."
Sonsofanarchy,2yioty,mychaoseternal,3,Mon Mar 16 05:54:23 2015 UTC,I remember being so shocked that this was evening happening. I felt Tigs pain. True testament to his acting skills.
Sonsofanarchy,2yioty,stacyo72,6,Tue Mar 10 03:58:49 2015 UTC,"Don't get it twisted. The problem was the editing - not the acting.   Kim has said in many interviews that he spent two nights working on the scene and would have ripped his hands off if it wasn't for the costume department making him padded cuffs to protect his wrists. We didn't see any of that in what was shown in the episode. Tig barely pulled at the cuffs at all, yet Kim claims he went crazy during filming. I'm inclined to believe Kim because he's a tremendous actor.   The impact of the scene was damaged during the editing process for sure. Knowing Sutter, I would not be surprised if he deliberately cut out the stronger parts of the performance, for fear of Kim getting an Emmy nod over his wife. He does not like Katey to be over shadowed by anyone, and there was a very real chance that Kim could have landed a lot of noms had the scene been cut better."
Sonsofanarchy,2yn1hn,JackLombardFilmsInc,8,Wed Mar 11 03:22:43 2015 UTC,I assumed he was named after jax's brother. Why would he name the kid after a hospital?
Sonsofanarchy,2yn1hn,myredditses,2,Wed Mar 11 03:34:08 2015 UTC,Lmao. I actually laughed out loud at this. He just really loves the hospital and especially that annoying red head!
Sonsofanarchy,2yn1hn,CreepyAbelTeller,4,Wed Mar 11 17:15:37 2015 UTC,"His brother Thomas. It was pretty obvious, why would you name your kid after the hospital."
Sonsofanarchy,2yn1hn,starkk92,4,Wed Mar 11 03:33:54 2015 UTC,The show say's several times that he's named after his late uncle.
Sonsofanarchy,2yn1hn,Acpt7567,3,Wed Mar 11 04:19:05 2015 UTC,Really?
Sonsofanarchy,2yhrlj,Mjredmonkey,6,Mon Mar 9 22:35:31 2015 UTC,"Great topic!   I tend to love the ending montages over the opening ones. For example, the ending montage in the pilot. Bobby Elvis singing ""Only Fools Rush In"" while Jax/Tara embrace/almost kiss for the first time in 10+ years and Jax sees Abel for the first time (with Gemma over his shoulder) while Clay stands in the background under the ""EXIT"" sign. Very cryptic. Also love the ending of the Season 1 finale with ""John the Revelator.""   The ending of the Season 6 finale is so fucking sad but I do love the song and watching Jax cradle and wail over Tara's dead body is one of the best acting moments for Hunnam in the entire series."
Sonsofanarchy,2yhrlj,CreepyAbelTeller,5,Tue Mar 10 00:33:08 2015 UTC,"Season 3 finale opener ""This Charming Life""  Jax and tara happy, clay and Gemma happy, big happy club breakfast, Abel home, Opie and lyla engaged, jax and clay getting along."
Sonsofanarchy,2yhrlj,slightlyobsessedSOA,2,Tue Mar 10 03:55:26 2015 UTC,"That's a great one. I love love love that opening, especially the very first part of that scene. Even though I was pissed at how poorly Jax treated Tara all season, it was nice to see them in a really good place and how genuinely grateful he was to have her by his side. Plus, I think the scene after that is the greatest amount of time Jax has spent holding Abel."
Sonsofanarchy,2yhrlj,CreepyAbelTeller,2,Tue Mar 10 21:53:13 2015 UTC,Yes!! I thought that too - loved seeing him be a real dad. He pretends to feed Abel during the family breakfast and Clay is a doting grandpa. Ugh what could have been ...
Sonsofanarchy,2yhrlj,slightlyobsessedSOA,4,Wed Mar 11 03:02:21 2015 UTC,"Sack's wake with Dad's Gonna Kill Me in S3 premiere, last montage with John's voiceover and the twist with Hey Hey My My in the S3 finale, and of course the S6 finale."
Sonsofanarchy,2yhrlj,besyuziki,3,Tue Mar 10 19:55:20 2015 UTC,"I think my two favorite were the openers in consecutive episodes. S3E13 ""This Charming life"" that was mentioned earlier and S4E1 ""Coal War"" while the guys leave the prison."
Sonsofanarchy,2yhrlj,jps815,1 point,Wed Mar 11 00:46:48 2015 UTC,Love Coal War. That's a great set up for where everyone is in the beginning of the season.
Sonsofanarchy,2yhrlj,stacyo72,3,Wed Mar 11 00:50:23 2015 UTC,I thought ''Make it rain'' was pretty badass.
Sonsofanarchy,2yhrlj,Mayhem5100,4,Tue Mar 10 09:21:14 2015 UTC,Eh - I think it's a great song but that episode really needed to SPOILER
Sonsofanarchy,2yhrlj,CreepyAbelTeller,2,Tue Mar 10 21:54:43 2015 UTC,"Not sure why you were downvoted here - I agree. That was the penultimate episode, IIRC. Really a powerful take on that."
Sonsofanarchy,2yhrlj,some_dunkaroos,2,Tue Mar 10 16:57:50 2015 UTC,My favourite was the one with the house of the rising sun in the background at the end of season 4. It gave me chills. It was a brilliant montage!

Sonsofanarchy,2yeo43,AllAboutMeMedia,10,Mon Mar 9 20:08:56 2015 UTC,One of the best characters. I was sad when he didn't return. I would love a spinoff with him.

He had so much potential to be a great character --- the way he rides into town on a harley - when Roosevelt had an interaction with him about Juice and how he was wrong to manipulate him he says something like ""I wish I didn't understand, but I do, more than you know"" or something.

Sonsofanarchy,2yeo43,Adamadtr,2,Mon Mar 9 11:13:42 2015 UTC,He's just a great actor.  His small part in SOA will always stick out to me.  Couldn't agree more on the spin off thing.
Sonsofanarchy,2yeo43,WWJaxD1973,2,Mon Mar 9 16:18:10 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I'd like to keep his character as is.  part of the mystery behind potter is why we love him so much. There's to much that can happen that could fuck his character up."
Sonsofanarchy,2yeo43,gizmatic,2,Mon Mar 9 16:22:57 2015 UTC,"There was alot to this character. At first I didn't like him because i just couldn't see it. They didn't give him a lot of background or anything to relate to the character. But as it went on you could see there was a method to his madness, there was a driving force behind his actions, he was for justice period. he had an understanding of the why and how of a situation going to a certain point or it reachng it's conclusion.  A spin-off of his character? Maybe something where he was a traveling agent that made things right by taking up with the good guys when needed or the bad guys  if the system needed balance. A sort of modern day Kung Fu.  Also I think he would have been WAY better a character to keep over the cop that was introduced in season 7. I still want to bitch slap her dumb lost ass."

Sonsofanarchy,2yfbcf,CaptainKurls,4,Mon Mar 9 09:02:27 2015 UTC,"I believe that Clay loved Jax and Abel independent of his many, many many issues and his relationship with Gemma. I believe that is true from Episode 1 to the end. Yes, Clay is ruthless and he is willing to do horrible stuff to accomplish a goal, but so is Jax and most of the other members. This is a band of violent outlaws we're watching on screen and cheering for."
Sonsofanarchy,2yfbcf,gizmatic,2,Mon Mar 9 13:06:02 2015 UTC,"I feel like throughout this show (and, to varying degrees), you can say that the relationships between people are so brilliant and yet intense, and loving ---- but, none of their relationships will trump their relationship with themselves. For examples -- yes, I totally think Clay loves Jax. As a father, and as a brother --- but he doesn't love Jax more than he loves himself. That's what ultimately causes his downfall and he does the shit he does later. Same with Gemma and Tara. I'm rewatching and I had forgot how close they really get, and how far their relationship evolves during season 2/3. It's so creepy when Tara gives Gemma JT's letters, and she says to Gemma ""tell me you love me"". And I think Gemma truly does. But Gemma loves herself more."

Sonsofanarchy,2yfbcf,asstasticbum,1 point,Mon Mar 9 22:35:46 2015 UTC,I totally agree. Clay is being genuine about finding abel. I think he loves Jax and Gemma too. He is just a shithead who has little moral compass and cares about himself and his power most of all. Just like the rest.
Sonsofanarchy,2yfbcf,Gstreetshit,1 point,Tue Mar 10 19:49:32 2015 UTC,"This exactly.  Clay certainly had many faults just as you mentioned, but I do think he cared deeply about his family."
Sonsofanarchy,2yfbcf,billy8383,1 point,Wed Mar 11 05:38:49 2015 UTC,"No doubt he loves Abel, just like he loves Jax and Gemma. But he's not above putting his needs first. That was very apparent in his relationship with both Jax and Gemma. He's not a selfless dude. There's a really telling scene in Season 3 where Clay asks Jax what's going on with Tara and that relationship. He's not asking because he really cares about that relationship but because he wants Jax to pressure Tara into helping them push the black market meds. Meanwhile, Jax is trying to push her away and doesn't want her involved in club business because he can't risk her getting hurt. Jax infers that Tara is essentially better than him (something about her being a surgeon and saving lives and him being the opposite of all of that). Clay's response: ""She's just a chick. Don't complicate it."" Classy guy. At the end of the day, Gemma and Tara are just ""chicks"" and ""old ladies"" according to Clay. If anything, Jax always saw Tara as an equal, if not much better than him. And in a way, he always saw Abel (and eventually Thomas) as something more than just inheriting the patch."
Sonsofanarchy,2yfbcf,CreepyAbelTeller,1 point,Wed Mar 11 17:23:51 2015 UTC,"I can see how you'd get that out of the conversation over Tara, and while I don't disagree that Clay could be very selfish at times, I honestly took that conversation as him saying that it didn't matter what Tara or Jax did for a living, that if they were in love then all that didn't matter, and he was thinking too much about it, that if they were in love then there wasn't anything else to think about.  I could very well be wrong, but that's how I took it."
Sonsofanarchy,2yfbcf,billy8383,1 point,Thu Mar 12 02:01:29 2015 UTC,"Perhaps. But based on how he essentially used the phrase ""old lady"" as an insult to Gemma in Season 4 (when she was prying into club business and he needed to put her in her place), I do think he thought of women as inferior in some way. Saying someone is ""just a chick"" isn't really holding them to a high regard."

I just wish it had been done better. Like, maybe have him actually restart the nomad charter, and then something happens that draws him back into SAMCRO.  It might just be me, but it felt so weird seeing him pull this big dramatic moment where he rips off his VP tag, only to have him come back about two or three weeks later like nothing happened and hand wave it by saying ""I just couldn't help you in THAT way."""

Sonsofanarchy,2yeezw,Acpt7567,3,Mon Mar 9 02:50:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I agree with both points. I liked the idea of Half-Sack/Cherry but it didn't really go anywhere. And when she showed up in Belfast, it just seemed random and unnecessary. I nearly forgot about the whole Trinity-Jax almost incest incident. But I guess that was meant to show how far Jax was willing to go to try and push Tara out of his mind/heart since they had just broken up. Strange stuff and not very well executed."
Sonsofanarchy,2yeezw,Acpt7567,1 point,Mon Mar 9 03:16:56 2015 UTC,"Granted Sutter did really have a chance to do much with half-sacks story....  It wasn't really a storyline he almost fucked her, found out she was his sister and didn't it was part of the Belfast family story if anything."
Sonsofanarchy,2yeezw,CatherineWright89,1 point,Mon Mar 9 04:46:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I get that it was part of the (rather dumb) Belfast family story but it was ultimately pointless. What's the point of showing him tapping into his carnal instincts with his half-sister and then poof, she joins the piles of characters that are shown for no reason and never brought up again. I get that the introduction of her character was to show that JT had another family in Belfast but just mentioning her would have probably been as impactful.   Granted, I didn't really care for her... but it was just Jax being a dumb dumb. Somehow he finds time to make out with family while he's supposedly really heartbroken over Abel. Classy guy."

I thought WTF Sutter in that moment. I don't like Gemma but I did genuinely feel sorry for her in that storyline. Except the end of season six I think that was the worst thing that anyone did to the club, and he just walked away- they never hunted him down for revenge, and I really wanted him to get what was coming to him!!"
Sonsofanarchy,2yeezw,randyboozer,2,Mon Mar 9 18:50:25 2015 UTC,"The idea was to let Zobelle live knowing his daughter and crew was either dead or hated him. He was alone, known as a rat and couldn't feel safe no matter where he went. I think it wasn't properly executed but I got what it was going for. That and if you watch the season opening there is a plane crash being televised in the room Gemma is in. That is the plane Zobelle took, we are meant to presume he died in the crash."

Sonsofanarchy,2yeezw,MicOxlong,2,Wed Mar 11 23:05:32 2015 UTC,"No problem! The plane crash thing is a scene where she is sitting staring out of the window and the television takes up a good portion of the screen if I remember correctly. It's an image of a crashed plane so look out for it. And yeah, the writing of this show was very strange, either went too far or didn't go far enough to convince us. Like there is this with Zoebelle, or the end where Jax spreads his arms, the truck driver yells ""Jesus!"" and then crows are eating wine soaked bread as we close the show. We have pebbles thrown at us or a cannon ball."

Potter was a fantastic character. The way Roosevelt uses juice is genius on his part. You feel for juice as he is doing all the fucked up things he is forced to do, the goddamn Rico case getting squashed?! It was my favorite out of all of them so far."

Sonsofanarchy,2ycrlk,chronicwisdom,3,Sun Mar 8 22:07:51 2015 UTC,What's interesting is that Sutter has claimed the CIA was his plan all along and that he was dropping subtle hints throughout the season that he expected fans to notice. Personally I don't buy it. I also found the Rico thing to be entirely too derivative of the Sopranos.
Sonsofanarchy,2ycrlk,K1ash,6,Sun Mar 8 19:17:39 2015 UTC,RICO would be one of the best ways to go after the Sons though.
Sonsofanarchy,2ycrlk,chronicwisdom,0,Sun Mar 8 19:42:50 2015 UTC,"Oh it would, and Sons is a really similar show to Sopranos. I just don't think Sons carried anything they did in season 4 well. The RICO case, the cartel stuff, the juice shit, it was all done in such a way that I personally found myself questioning what Sutter was thinking throughout the season rather than just being able to watch and enjoy. I had similar issues with this season as well."
Sonsofanarchy,2ycrlk,K1ash,3,Sun Mar 8 19:45:59 2015 UTC,I think that was done on purpose. I think Sutter wanted to show that SAMCRO was in over their heads.
Sonsofanarchy,2ycrlk,asstasticbum,1 point,Sun Mar 8 19:52:30 2015 UTC,"That and the fact that they were much more of a fragile organization than the previous seasons made them out to be. The letters from Belfast alone were enough to essentially Clay into the one man show of SAMCRO.  Its also like I have said multiple times before, Jax lied to club and went along with what Clay wanted to get out. I really do not think that regardless of him being the heir apparent regardless of Clay killing Pinney, beating the shit out of Gemma and trying to off Tara that if the MC would have said, ""Oh, well Jax you were in cahoots with Clay as well in this conspiracy, well Clay was a bad guy, you are JT's son, forgive and forget."""

My biggest complaint of the series was how they would show you just about everything, and the story moves with dialogue you see.  They then get in tight spot and then something happens that is only shocking because they didn't the the audience that dialogue.

So we are supposed to believe a judge approves a 14-month sentence recommendation, with no quid pro quo, made by a field agent -- not a prosecutor -- who had been shot execution-style? BS.   But if you ask these questions, you can't really enjoy TV. Can you?  This is not a realistic show. Big deal. It's an enjoyable way to spend 45-90 minutes. (Later episodes get reAlly long. )"
Sonsofanarchy,2ycrlk,warrior1839,1 point,Sun Mar 8 23:33:09 2015 UTC,You really should stop watching now. It only gets worse. Season 7 is a relentless grim murder-grind all the way to a pointless ending.
Sonsofanarchy,2ycrlk,Dane_steele,0,Mon Mar 9 03:57:10 2015 UTC,"sad, but true."
Sonsofanarchy,2ycrlk,Boof-Bubba-Dale,1 point,Mon Mar 9 05:05:44 2015 UTC,Watch season 5 then stop its better than 4 but after that the writing is astoundingly frustratingly bad
Sonsofanarchy,2ycrlk,MicOxlong,-10,Mon Mar 9 23:48:38 2015 UTC,"Honestly IMO, i would of been OK with this being the last finale. The rest of the show was garbage afterward anyway."
Sonsofanarchy,2yb5r4,ICameBack4uSaul,11,Sun Mar 8 04:37:29 2015 UTC,"Out of all the scenes Charlie did for this show, this stuck out the most to me. It showed pure raw emotion, and both him and Theo's characters shined in this scene."
Sonsofanarchy,2yb5r4,adeadcurrent,6,Sun Mar 8 18:34:32 2015 UTC,Let me finish my pie.
Sonsofanarchy,2yb5r4,Keeper-of-Balance,2,Sun Mar 8 06:07:39 2015 UTC,Never have 5 words bothered me so much. My heart broke for Juice all season. I think the worst was when Juice told Chibs that the club was all he had and that he loved him....and Chibs told him that he should put his gun in his mouth and pull the trigger. I never hated Chibs until that moment.
Sonsofanarchy,2yb5r4,CharliesAngelSOA,2,Mon Mar 9 04:27:47 2015 UTC,this was one of the best scenes ive ever seen in TV
Sonsofanarchy,2yb5r4,TheLastNomad,2,Sun Mar 8 18:14:08 2015 UTC,Worth sticking through Season 7 just for this episode.
Sonsofanarchy,2yb5r4,CreepyAbelTeller,2,Sun Mar 8 20:03:33 2015 UTC,This scene was heartbreaking to me. Charlie and Theo did such an amazing job. Both of them did awesome the whole season. I have never cried so much in my life.
Sonsofanarchy,2yb5r4,CharliesAngelSOA,1 point,Mon Mar 9 04:23:53 2015 UTC,"They were both amazing in that entire episode, but that scene was really their best work. Charlie nailed it in that scene."
Sonsofanarchy,2yb5r4,stacyo72,-2,Wed Mar 11 00:53:57 2015 UTC,I don't get it.
Sonsofanarchy,2yb5r4,Mayhem5100,4,Sun Mar 8 11:37:30 2015 UTC,It's from that episode where Juice tells what happened with Tara.
Sonsofanarchy,2yb5r4,dudix81,0,Sun Mar 8 17:14:32 2015 UTC,Right. Totally forgot.
Sonsofanarchy,2yb6fb,Mjredmonkey,39,Sun Mar 8 04:45:15 2015 UTC,Definitely Stahl.
Sonsofanarchy,2yb6fb,Frost134,3,Sun Mar 8 04:54:50 2015 UTC,"For me, a show gets ""five stars"" if it can produce one episode (or, at the very least, one segment of one episode) that absolutely sticks with me for years, an episode that I'll occasionally just rewatch, out of the blue. The last fifteen minutes of S3:E13 ""NS"" is SOA's segment, for me. Quite possibly my personal highlight of the show right there."
Sonsofanarchy,2yb6fb,BlackDeath3,21,Mon Mar 23 07:25:36 2015 UTC,"My favorite was Opie's. He was my favorite character, and the epitome of what a club brother is, and always should be. Sure, he had a death wish, but he put his club first even after losing so much. He still had fight in him, but he knew deep down that it was his sacrifice to make. He wanted to go home to Donna, and saving his club just seemed right for him. It was his smile, that reassuring grin that still sends shivers up my spine. It was the way he said ""I got this."" The way the emotion reflected In his eyes. You could tell both Ryan, and the character believed in the core foundation of their club. Opie was SAMCRO."
Sonsofanarchy,2yb6fb,FuckingRoyalty,5,Sun Mar 8 05:01:23 2015 UTC,I agree. His and Tig's daughter's death scenes are always the ones that stick out in my mind. And Stahl because of Opie's reaction to it.
Sonsofanarchy,2yb6fb,JessicaHM,8,Sun Mar 8 05:29:07 2015 UTC,"I loved Stahl's death because it reminded me of a trapped rat. She inflicted so much damage. To see it rebound on her was sweet justice. The level of intricacy it took for them to plot that, and execute it was amazing."
Sonsofanarchy,2yb6fb,FuckingRoyalty,14,Sun Mar 8 05:40:13 2015 UTC,"I don't feel like anyone died better, or more tragically than Opie.  I mean think about it... His club killed his wife, and he forgave as long as his club granted his father (one of the first nine, mind you) forgiveness, then he lost his father to the MC president.   He was always a good son, although (personally) I think he had the most shit to hold against the club, but went out fighting for the club.  The Sons of Anarchy never deserved Opie. He should have been allowed to stay out, and have a life with Donna and his kids, but in the end, he died with Donna dead, his children orphaned, and his father backstabbed and murdered, and his last words? ""I got this.""  Opie is my favorite character ever in the history of a TV series."
Sonsofanarchy,2yb6fb,AggressiveBurrito,7,Sun Mar 8 06:24:04 2015 UTC,"Hmmm. I see what you're saying, and I do think it was the most ""noble"" death but it wasn't the most tragic. Opie was ready to die. He wanted out. The most tragic death was easily Tara. She was finally in a good place and ready to leave with her sons when she was forked to death."

Sonsofanarchy,2yb6fb,CreepyAbelTeller,4,Sun Mar 8 21:12:01 2015 UTC,"Sure, I agree with what you said about Tara too."
Sonsofanarchy,2yb6fb,AggressiveBurrito,8,Sun Mar 8 22:55:07 2015 UTC,"Since no one has mentioned it I'm going with when Tigg drowned the torture porn Persian....in piss. When he just sat on the dock after and they had Ottis Redding playing it has it's own, very dark, Sons style of beauty. Tigg killed the man because he was a piece of shit, he pushed his buttons with the 'daddy' stuff, and I felt in that last scene he was thinking about his daughter on that dock. Tigg did some things he regretted for the club, he had his loyalty tested, he lost his daughter because he was doing what he thought was right for Clay, and in that scene it seemed like he was finally at peace with everything. Tigg, like Opie, and Otto fully realized how Samcro could ruin a mans life and stayed loyal till the end."
Sonsofanarchy,2yb6fb,chronicwisdom,1 point,Sun Mar 8 06:58:27 2015 UTC,"wow, thats a new one. Thanks for the reply man."
Sonsofanarchy,2yb6fb,chronicwisdom,1 point,Sun Mar 8 07:00:10 2015 UTC,"It was a great question to spark discussion after the series has ended. My second favorite was Kohn, he was such an abusive fuck and Jax deciding to shoot him to save Terra was a fucked up act of love that could be seen as a microcosm of their whole relationship."
Sonsofanarchy,2yb6fb,chronicwisdom,1 point,Sun Mar 8 07:02:32 2015 UTC,"That was a good one too. The first time i really went ""holy shit"" in the series. Juice is still my number one though. Jax being a close second."
Sonsofanarchy,2yb6fb,WWJaxD1973,3,Sun Mar 8 07:06:36 2015 UTC,"Juice's death was beautiful but someone already mentioned it. I found Jax's death to be rather lackluster considering we spent 7 seasons building to it. All the allegory shit at the end really fucked up my suspension of disbelief though. Sons was always a show I could get really into, that last 15-20 minutes I just kept thinking 'fuck off Sutter just let Jax dide'. But I was never into the homeless angel of death lady so my vision clearly doesn't mesh with whatever psuedo-religious themes Sutter is trying to invoke."
Sonsofanarchy,2yb6fb,chronicwisdom,2,Sun Mar 8 07:15:42 2015 UTC,"I like both Jax and Juice's death because they both needed it to happen. They were both tormented souls. Both of them, in the end died for what is most important to them. For Juice, the club. For Jax the club and his boys. Jax was a martyr for his club. And i feel that is exactly how he wanted to go. On his own terms for his club."

Sonsofanarchy,2yb6fb,schnakatak,5,Sun Mar 8 07:20:00 2015 UTC,"Stahl's was my favorite because she had it coming on so many different levels. But I really liked Gemma's too. She was the matriarch and even though she didn't wear a vest she was the leader of that club. Her influence was felt by every character on the show. So when she stood there telling Jax to do it and talking to him like he was still her baby and being encouraging It was tough. And her telling him sweetly that he had to because that is what they do..very emotional.  Jax's death was good too. He went out exactly as he wanted to. Got the club straight and taken care of, put in the hands of a good president, his kids taken care of, and every ""bad guy"" in Charming and those who were after the club taken out. When he raised his hands, closed his eyes, and smiled you could just feel the burden lifted from him and knew that his tortured soul was finally free."
Sonsofanarchy,2yb6fb,CreepyAbelTeller,2,Sun Mar 8 05:55:40 2015 UTC,"I found Gemma's death scene to be lacking because it was never revealed that she had a hand in JT's death. It just seemed like Sutter forgot about it and/or decided it was irrelevant, but it should have come up at some point."
Sonsofanarchy,2yb6fb,CrazyWTCheeseWiz,2,Sun Mar 8 06:49:48 2015 UTC,"Her death scene should've been Jax refusing to kill her while Gemma is saying all the shitty things she has done in order for him to kill her, because she knows she had to die. she says how she betrayed his father and then she says killed Tarah and then she is shot"
Sonsofanarchy,2yb6fb,CrazyWTCheeseWiz,1 point,Sun Mar 8 09:36:11 2015 UTC,"It didn't matter at that point. Her telling him wouldn't have changed his mind. I can understand why you would want her to tell him, it just wasn't necessary."
Sonsofanarchy,2yb6fb,GrubstakeMoose,1 point,Sun Mar 8 21:41:17 2015 UTC,"season 7, especially the jax-jury confrontation, made JTs death appear like suicide and not murder. i think they had to do it this way to make the final scene (jax going out like his father) work."
Sonsofanarchy,2yb6fb,CreepyAbelTeller,1 point,Thu Mar 12 03:52:13 2015 UTC,"Gemma's death scene was emotional (in terms of the acting) but man, I wanted it to be so much more brutal. She deserved the Bobby-treatment: one eyeball out, fingers cut off, jaw broken and then shot in the head. But I guess the end result is what matters. She dead."
Sonsofanarchy,2yb6fb,GrimThursday,4,Wed Mar 11 02:34:40 2015 UTC,"That's what he said? I thought he said ""You were good sweetheart"" referencing their forced sexual encounters."
Sonsofanarchy,2yb6fb,Acpt7567,3,Sun Mar 8 18:48:51 2015 UTC,"Nah ""you went out good sweetheart"" Showing Juice really did go out well. When the man who has been raping him shows him respect. Even if he is about to kill him."
Sonsofanarchy,2yb6fb,CatherineWright89,1 point,Sun Mar 8 19:00:41 2015 UTC,That makes sense. It leaves a better light on Juice in spite of all the shit he did wrong.
Sonsofanarchy,2yb6fb,CreepyAbelTeller,4,Sun Mar 8 21:08:50 2015 UTC,"Kozik. ""You gotta be shittin' me."" Good perspective on how crazy all of this is. Second: Half-Sack. Made it back from Iraq and got killed in a kitchen."
Sonsofanarchy,2yb6fb,theironbear,3,Sun Mar 8 23:37:54 2015 UTC,Kozik's death made me mad. There was so much more they couldve done with him and Tig. Half- sack was expected for me. I knew what happened to the actor so it wasnt that surprising.
Sonsofanarchy,2yb6fb,theironbear,3,Sun Mar 8 23:42:05 2015 UTC,"Agent Kohn. The entire scene was badass. Kohn taunting Jax and Tara, Jax shooting him, Tara's shrill scream, Jax sitting on the edge of the bed trembling and processing his first non-club kill and then the creepiest/most twisted/greatest sex scene in SOA history ensues. I kind of loved it."
Sonsofanarchy,2yay6y,Starship_Ogre,20,Sun Mar 8 03:15:14 2015 UTC,HOW DID HE KNEW ?!
Sonsofanarchy,2yay6y,CaitlinSarah87,16,Sun Mar 8 03:35:09 2015 UTC,Jax knews all.
Sonsofanarchy,2yay6y,FashionablyFake,12,Sun Mar 8 03:36:31 2015 UTC,You'll notice Jax goes from being Stephen Hawking-level genius in some episodes to Charlie Day from Always Sunny in Philadelphia stupid in others.
Sonsofanarchy,2yay6y,CreepyAbelTeller,10,Sun Mar 8 20:16:27 2015 UTC,He had seen those specialized pens while fucking up those irish at their warehouse... when they raced through the warehouse and took what's his face hostage? There was a pen on the desk. As far as I can remember.
Sonsofanarchy,2yay6y,FashionablyFake,2,Sun Mar 8 03:17:32 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I guess I didn't pay attention"
Sonsofanarchy,2yay6y,Jasonresno,2,Sun Mar 8 03:21:20 2015 UTC,Yup. When he slams the one Irish dude on the counter there is a shitload of those pens there.
Sonsofanarchy,2yay6y,zak420,3,Sun Mar 15 03:33:30 2015 UTC,its the same pen he made the mick write down the address with.
Sonsofanarchy,2yay6y,chronicwisdom,3,Sun Mar 8 04:33:49 2015 UTC,The pen didn't fit in and he knew the Irish were pissed. It's my understanding that in the heat of the Troubles the IRA enjoyed bombing protestant pubs. I had a feeling they were going to blow that shit up as soon as Jax crossed the Kings. Jax had a feeling the Irish were going to retaliate and when the conveniently new keg delivery guy left a super Irish pen on the bar it was a clue. OR it's one of the many plot holes in the series...take your pick.
Sonsofanarchy,2y9fji,PershingRyki,1 point,Sat Mar 7 18:39:32 2015 UTC,I just checked it and it said back ordered. Maybe they will be getting more in stock soon? Shoot them an email and see what they say.

Sonsofanarchy,2y8oyq,CreepyAbelTeller,1 point,Sat Mar 7 22:23:26 2015 UTC,Thats only when the show is still on the air because they dont release them until the blu ray is released... the season 7 blu ray was out a few weeks ago.. usually its on netflix a month later
Sonsofanarchy,2y8oyq,speeder111,3,Sun Mar 8 02:12:59 2015 UTC,Probably in the fall. I would guess around September or October.

Sonsofanarchy,2y9jeo,ChilliChowder,2,Sat Mar 7 21:38:06 2015 UTC,Haha sorry. I guess I don't really understand the context. Are there re watch rules? I've watched them all 3 times... just cos it felt right. For me.
Sonsofanarchy,2y9jeo,asstasticbum,2,Sat Mar 7 21:59:33 2015 UTC,Im mainly talking about the reddit rewatches. They are doing the rewatch discussions so i was wondering if they only do 1 or more of those.
Sonsofanarchy,2y9jeo,schnakatak,5,Sat Mar 7 22:30:39 2015 UTC,"We re-watch one episode per week, in chronological order, to follow the tradition of when the show was still ""live"" and we'd watch the new episode every week as it aired. We decided to start this re-watch because for many of us Tuesday nights were always something to look forward to, so we decided to continue the tradition for those who want to.   So far we've only ""planned"" on one. It will mostly depend on the popularity of them as we go that will probably be the determining factor for if we re-watch more than once as a clubhouse.   This does not mean however that on your own time you cannot re-watch the show, do so as many times as you like as it is not up to us to tell you what to do. Also, feel free to join us on re-watch nights whenever you like! Tuesdays, 9pm EST, there's always a stickied post by /u/asstasticbum at the front of /r/Sonsofanarchy. Come join in and chat with us while we watch if you like! Just because you haven't seen the previous re-watches doesn't mean you cannot join in. The more the merrier!   If this didn't adequately answer what you were wondering please don't hesitate to shoot me (/u/Alwaysthequiet1) a PM, or message the mods! Hope this helps."

Sonsofanarchy,2y65fl,KingBR1,2,Sat Mar 7 04:33:42 2015 UTC,He truly is the glue that helps hold the club together. Same with bobby elvis!  Ps. I am on season 4 episode 6. Loving this show.
Sonsofanarchy,2y65fl,melisseph,1 point,Sat Mar 7 05:26:18 2015 UTC,"On Season 2, when the bounty hunters pick him up it is hilarious. Not to mention his beastality and necrophilia. Guy is messed up."
Sonsofanarchy,2y65fl,jaksida,1 point,Sun Mar 8 19:36:58 2015 UTC,I don't remember the beastality and necrophilia parts. Which episodes?
Sonsofanarchy,2y65fl,KingBR1,1 point,Sun Mar 8 19:59:40 2015 UTC,Early episodes he had sex with the two Mayans. They then had to pull the bodies out and replace them. Beastiality is hinted with the bounty hunters and at Oswald's stables. His eyes are just creepy.
Sonsofanarchy,2y65fl,jaksida,1 point,Sun Mar 8 20:04:07 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure he was banging the Mexicans that worked the warehouse and were burned to death before they were killed. At least that's the impression I got and that it wasn't necrophilia as I feel like that would have turned a lot of people away from liking his character. Its been a while since watching season 1 so I could be wrong here.
Sonsofanarchy,2y65fl,KingBR1,1 point,Sun Mar 8 20:36:40 2015 UTC,What about when they break into the forensics lab to stop the bodies from being ID'd. Tig says to Clay if he ever considered it. That the cold is somewhat comforting.
Sonsofanarchy,2y65fl,jaksida,1 point,Sun Mar 8 21:03:13 2015 UTC,"Could be Tigs twisted sense of humor, or that he actually has done it. Maybe I just don't want it to be true lol"

Sonsofanarchy,2y65fl,WWJaxD1973,2,Fri Mar 6 21:20:34 2015 UTC,How season 3 ended is my all time favorite. I actually was walking around the living room yelling at the TV the whole time.   I am from the 1%er back ground but hadn't been around it in ten years so whenthe started showing commericals for the pilot I was skeptical but was also missing the life. So the night it premired I sat down with a six pack and then watched the pilot both times it re-aired after the premire. I was hooked ever sense.  Yea there are things I thought outlandish and not a truthful portrayal of the life I knew but even more rang true that I got chills here and there. Great series and I am praying they do The First Nine and it is just as good.

Sonsofanarchy,2y7zqs,Mjredmonkey,7,Sat Mar 7 07:03:59 2015 UTC,"Lost me with the crappy CGI. It's like they left the last 10 minutes to some high schooler and his Paint program. Other than that, I thought it was a pretty obvious - albeit poetic - conclusion. Jax is Hamlet. He was always going to die in the end. I found it hard to believe from the moment he was shown cradling Tara's dead body, that he was ever going to make it out alive. He basically said as much in the beginning of Season 7 when he asked the club to commit to his vengeance plan and be prepared to die.   I liked the parallel to the opening scene of the series. That was pretty neat. The religious allegory was a bit too much though (did we really need Vic Mackey yelling ""Jesus!"" as Jax ran into his truck with his arms outstretched?). I found the scene with Abel twirling the SONS rings to be the best part of the ending. The uncertainty if Abel will follow his father's destiny much like Jax and JT was pretty haunting."
Sonsofanarchy,2y7zqs,CreepyAbelTeller,6,Sat Mar 7 16:27:59 2015 UTC,"SoA never had great CGI, but you'd think they would put more effort into the last scene of the show."
Sonsofanarchy,2y7zqs,iAmMitten1,5,Sun Mar 8 04:10:45 2015 UTC,Wasn't there a scene at the beginning of season 7 where they tied a gangster to a car - that CGI was really bad too.
Sonsofanarchy,2y7zqs,nikki_sixx,2,Mon Mar 9 20:33:17 2015 UTC,"Holy cow, yeah, I forgot about that one. One of the only parts in the show that had me rolling my eyes as it happened.  I too wish that the CGI with the truck had been better. It took me right out of it as it was happening, which is a real shame given how important that moment was.  On the other hand, the ""Jesus"" thing didn't really bother me. I didn't even notice it until some other reviewer remarked upon it later on."
Sonsofanarchy,2y7zqs,BlackDeath3,1 point,Mon Mar 23 07:32:56 2015 UTC,Yeah. The highest rated show in FX history can't afford some decent to good CGI? I don't believe it.

Sonsofanarchy,2y7zqs,CreepyAbelTeller,1 point,Tue Mar 10 00:25:22 2015 UTC,"I know I'm going to get hate for this, but I think that timeline is completely irrelevant when it comes to spoilers. Especially when it's so easy to just wrap a spoiler tag around something, I don't get it. It takes two seconds to tag your spoilers, but you can never really ""unspoil"" something for somebody. It just seems supremely inconsiderate to not tag."
Sonsofanarchy,2y7zqs,BlackDeath3,2,Mon Mar 23 07:36:49 2015 UTC,I get that but this thread is labeled: Last 10 minutes of the series -- did you come in here expecting anything different?
Sonsofanarchy,2y7zqs,CreepyAbelTeller,1 point,Mon Mar 23 15:17:38 2015 UTC,"I wasn't talking about SoA, and that's really my whole point. To me, ""discuss the last ten minutes of Sons of Anarchy"" doesn't imply that I'll be getting spoilers regarding separate (though possibly related) works of art. In this case, the work-of-art in question is Shakespeare's Hamlet.  It's like when you read a review about some movie, or TV show, or book, or whatever it is that you've just finished, and in the process of reviewing the work the author says something to the tune of ""[event that happened in show being reviewed] was crazy, and it was just like when [spoiler X] happened in [unrelated work-of-art Y]!"" Why would you do that, unless you just don't care enough about your audience to individually preface your spoilers?"
Sonsofanarchy,2y7zqs,BlackDeath3,1 point,Mon Mar 23 15:43:22 2015 UTC,"Gotcha. Well, I'm sorry to have spoiled Hamlet. That wasn't my intention.

Sonsofanarchy,2y7zqs,JessicaHM,3,Sat Mar 7 10:52:58 2015 UTC,"Bad CGI, amazing ending. It was very poetic and fit the show, Jax finished what J.T left and finished his journey. My heart was pounding watching what I knew was going to happen unravel and hoping Kurt would pull a plot twist but it I think the entire episode screamed Jax wouldn't make it. I think it gave a strong hint there'd be another Teller at the table, which would make a show parallel to SoA as, Abel would have no idea what his father wanted for the club or his thoughts and trials to guide him. Overall my favourite series finale."
Sonsofanarchy,2y7zqs,Acpt7567,3,Sun Mar 8 01:09:33 2015 UTC,"It was an epic conclusion to an awesome series.  When a show can make you feel, you know it's been a good one."

Sonsofanarchy,2y7zqs,Weltall548,1 point,Sun Mar 8 12:45:37 2015 UTC,I absolutely loved it. But I really would have found it perfect if they cut to black when Jax smiled and closed his eyes so the song could fade into the last SOA logo and we wouldn't have the god-fucking-awful CGI shot and then the bread suggesting religious themes and such. Or else if they had added good CGI. Either or.
Sonsofanarchy,2y7zqs,cmbucket101,1 point,Mon Mar 9 20:46:29 2015 UTC,Would love a fan edit without all the completely unnecessary allegory. Jax isn't Jesus and was never a Christlike figure. You started with a Hamlet archetype don't go slamming the bible into it because you feel like it.
Sonsofanarchy,2y7zqs,chronicwisdom,1 point,Sun Mar 8 07:10:42 2015 UTC,"I believe he was hamlet moreso until the end. He died for the sins of his club. The club pretty much has a new, clean slate. He sacrificed himself for his club and his family."
Sonsofanarchy,2y7zqs,chronicwisdom,2,Sun Mar 8 07:15:10 2015 UTC,"But he didn't die for the sins of his club, he died for his own sins. It's not like Jesus did a bunch of horrible shit then they crufcified him. He was a nice dude, performed some miracles, told people to chill out and the Romans got pissed because they thought his following/power would outsrip that of the empire. Jax made a bunch of poor decisions without really thinking that put his loved ones in trouble (seasons 5,6 7).  He then put himself in a a position where the only redemption for Samcro was his own death...that's not Jesus at all, and that's what made the allegory stupidly inappropriate/unnecessary. The tragedy works perfectly well (probably better) without having to shoehorn Christianity into it."
Sonsofanarchy,2y7zqs,chronicwisdom,2,Sun Mar 8 07:22:03 2015 UTC,I agree the Jesus allegory was not at all necessary. Hell i don't think it made the scene any better. But Jax messed up his club. He inflicted his own mistakes on the club. This suicide was his redemption. Also after all is said and done it is what Jax wanted. I feel that more than anything he wanted peace. And he did it by wiping away his sins that hurt the club more than anything. He stopped it before it could get to his own children.
Sonsofanarchy,2y7zqs,CreepyAbelTeller,1 point,Sun Mar 8 07:25:57 2015 UTC,"For sure, Jax put himself into a corner (and a lot of the blame can be placed on Gemma's lie) and his suicide was his redemption. However, i feel that Gemma's lie had precedent in actions by Jax and Clay in earlier seasons. When Donna died Clay blamed it on the Mayans, with unpleasant repercussions. When Clay got shot by Opie Jax blamed the niners, with unpleasant repercussions. Gemma killed someone she shouldn't so how do she and Juice decide to cover it up...the Samcro way by blaming the closest rival.  It seemed that after Donna died, the club lost a certain level of trust, but to maintain the brotherhood they had to push that distrust outside. This became a pattern under Clay/Jax and unless Jax ended his life the distrust and lies started under Clay would finally rip the club apart."

Sonsofanarchy,2y00es,zinterz,2,Sat Mar 7 00:19:47 2015 UTC,That sounds a lot like the normal edition as opposed to the collector's edition. Am I right? I'm hoping I'm right because I love the American collector's set and don't want our one to be different.
Sonsofanarchy,2y00es,Spinetablet,1 point,Sat Mar 7 07:19:30 2015 UTC,"Maybe there's a limited edition and a collectors? I'll have to look into it.

The rest looks a like with the box that looks like the chapel table and we've got the crate-looking outer box, too.

Sonsofanarchy,2xuouz,stacyo72,1 point,Sat Mar 7 05:09:20 2015 UTC,"Exactly! We hardly ever see any of the good moments in their lives. The only time I saw them happy, before the ATF crap, was that brief moment at the fireworks display. Other than that she was a harpy and a shrew constantly bad mouthing the club and giving Opie shit. Like she didn't know he was in the MC when they got married? Maybe she didn't know what the life entailed, but my God woman! Give the guy a break already."
Sonsofanarchy,2xuouz,stacyo72,1 point,Sat Mar 7 13:02:46 2015 UTC,"Haha. Agreed. They really didn't have any happy moments. I guess raising kids and taking care of the home when your husband is in jail for 5 years because of his criminal job will make you pretty bitter and resentful but damn, she got on my last nerve.   Although I feel like the same criticism was thrown Tara's way and I never really agreed with it because her arc was quite different (and every time she tried to actually leave, something would happen to her) and Jax was constantly promising things, unlike Opie who straight up told Donna this is who he is and he's staying."

The whole series is basically her slowly (or sometimes quickly) losing and fighting for all three.   Hence why I said here I think during season 6, maybe season 5, the show name should be changed from ""Sons of Anarchy"" to ""All Gemmas Children."""
Sonsofanarchy,2xrrb2,asstasticbum,10,Tue Mar 3 10:59:04 2015 UTC,So Gemma is the Cersei of SoA.
Sonsofanarchy,2xrrb2,ChriosM,2,Tue Mar 3 18:02:33 2015 UTC,What did she really want the kids for then... ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Sonsofanarchy,2xrrb2,Somaliam_Pirate,6,Tue Mar 3 21:55:14 2015 UTC,"I would say that Gemma is a narcissist.   DSM-5 criteria for narcissistic personality disorder include these features:    Having an exaggerated sense of self-importance  Expecting to be recognized as superior even without achievements that warrant it  Exaggerating your achievements and talents  Being preoccupied with fantasies about success, power, brilliance, beauty or the perfect mate Believing that you are superior and can only be understood by or associate with equally special people Requiring constant admiration Having a sense of entitlement Expecting special favors and unquestioning compliance with your expectations Taking advantage of others to get what you want Having an inability or unwillingness to recognize the needs and feelings of others  Being envious of others and believing others envy you  Behaving in an arrogant or haughty manner    I think that Gemma's dislike for Tara is because of how Tara came between Gemma and Jax.  Before Tara - Jax did what he was told, by Gemma, largely, but with Tara in the mix, you got to see a lot of these narcissistic behaviours come out.  You can also see it in her relations with the other characters.  She hits every point on that checklist with most people.  Look at her relationship with Wayne, look at how she expects her will to just be done, without question.  She takes advantage, she extorts and belittles as needed.  This would make Jax the ""Golden Child"" in a narcissistic family dynamic --  seen as an extension of the Narcissistic Parent, can do no wrong, and even the most minor of achievements are cause for celebration, admiration, and rewards.  So when Tara comes along, Gemma starts to lose control over Jax, in a way that never happened with Wendy.  She could control Wendy, but not Tara, so her attempts and manipulations become more and more transparent, and obvious as we move towards the end of the show.  The penultimate moment is when that bond is severed for good, by Tara, ironically, in thatSPOILER."
Sonsofanarchy,2xrrb2,SageTemple,1 point,Tue Mar 3 14:16:00 2015 UTC,"And all the members sucked-up to her, Nero adored her, Unser and Chucky were in love with her. She had it all and blew it so massively when she offed Tara."

She could control Wendy, but not Tara, so her attempts and manipulations become more and more transparent, and obvious as we move towards the end of the show.""  Wasn't it inferred that Gemma basically manipulated Jax into marrying Wendy? Like she set it all up? I remember reading somewhere that Wendy got pregnant as a way to keep Jax or something and I remember Wendy telling Unser that it was Gemma pushing the wedding train. So, in a way - it's like she hand-picked Wendy so she could have total control over the situation knowing that Jax was never going to be happy anyway (since he was always in love with Tara and at the time, she hadn't come back to him). Really spooky and messed up."
Sonsofanarchy,2xrrb2,CreepyAbelTeller,3,Thu Mar 5 02:56:45 2015 UTC,"Zobelle's thing with his daughter was more creepy.  He seemed like he was practically about to make-out with Polly.  Wouldn't surprise me if they had a sexual thing.  She seemed to like it  I think that statement of Jax's about his Mommy thing was a joke, totally not serious.  Gemma was obsessed with her son, probably because Thomas died, so she focused 100% of her energy on Jax.  Things may have been different if Thomas was alive.  However, I don't think there was anything sexual about it.    My family is Italian, we often kiss on the lips.  Light pecks!  Not all creepy like Zobelle and Polly.  It's cultural a lot of times."
Sonsofanarchy,2xrrb2,CSMom74,3,Tue Mar 3 15:56:36 2015 UTC,"Gemma was Queen Bee and Jax was Prince Charming. Someone pointed out that Gemma is a text-book narcissist and she is. I guess you could argue that Jax was a bit of one as well in latter seasons but he comes by it honestly.  There was, as far as I can tell--and I've seen the whole series and re watched select episodes time and time again--NEVER anything dubious about their relationship. It wasn't incestuous at all, if that is what you are wondering. Kissing on the lips is a cultural and subcultural thing and there is a difference between the simple peck of affection that Gemma gives/gets from Jax and the the kisses she gives Clay or those that Jax gives Tara.  Love is not rationed on the show. Some of the SONS themselves kiss one another and they are always giving hugs, and they all profess ""I love you."" over and over again. Its all on the level of familial and friendly affection. It isn't a sexual thing for them, they are an adopted family and they know it, own it and love it.  Jaxs ""mommy thing"" comment was in reply to Nero. Jax wanted SAMCRO to do business with Nero, but Nero was banging Gemma and Jax told him that if they did business, then Nero would need him to leave Gemma alone. (Remember, the entire club was invested in Gemmas interests and well being, but she was Jaxs mom.)  Jax knew that if Nero upset Gemma, the club would toast him. Plus, Clay and Gemma were seperated, not divorced at the time and it was up in the air what would happen between Gemma and Clay and adding Nero to the mix just made for a very messy love triangle situation.  Nero, not knowing all of that, asked if Jaxs request was about the best interest of the business arrangement or if it was just a mommy-issue he had (Alot of kids hate their moms new boyfriend/husband).  Jaxs reply: ""I got over my mommy thing a long time ago."" was just saying:Yes, this is about the business matter going smoothly, not my need to micromanage my moms love-life.    I took that as more a long the lines of ""My mom married Clay and I was able to cope with it just fine, so I'm not pissy about who she dates/loves romantically"" not ""my mom and I are no longer having an unhealthy intimate relationship with sexual overtures.""  Gemma herself acknowledged that she was so hell-bent on Jax, focused on Jax, obsessive about Jax, because that was how she coped with the loss of her 2nd son. Gemma doubled and redoubled the amount of time and energy that she poured into Jax, trying to make up for the fact that she now had half as many kids to dote on and mother. Its also mentioned that Gemma always wanted a big family--""a dozen sons"", but between her poor cardiac health and then the death of Thomas, she and JT never had more, so 2 sons was never really enough to scratch her mothering itch to begin with and then she lost one, leaving her a mother of one.  You can see that Gemma pampers and dotes on all of the Sons in SAMCRO from time to time--she makes them breakfasts and dinners, she councils them when they're sad, she picks them up when they are down. That sort of thing.  Gemma was controlling, yes, but she was a good mom in the sense that she always wanted what was best for Jax. Or what she thought was best for him."
Sonsofanarchy,2xrrb2,gizmatic,1 point,Tue Mar 3 18:38:50 2015 UTC,"""Gemma was controlling, yes, but she was a good mom in the sense that she always wanted what was best for Jax. Or what she thought was best for him.""  ^ The more I think about it, I don't believe Gemma knows how to purely love anyone, including herself. It may have something to do with her upbringing. But I suspect she had been like that long before Jax came along. Gemma has always loved with an agenda. All the way down to her grandchildren. Sure - she may think she's doing what's best but that doesn't mean it's pure love. Even after murdering Tara and all the destruction that went down with it, this psycho goes and gives her poor, little grandson -- who just went through a major mental breakdown before her own eyes -- a SAMCRO ring. She wanted Abel to continue the tradition - join the club which she helped build. She wanted her legacy to live on in a way."
Sonsofanarchy,2xrrb2,CreepyAbelTeller,2,Thu Mar 5 02:51:46 2015 UTC,"Oh God yes, this. Gemma is a nut-case. Some one pointed out that she is a textbook narcissist. As much as she loved Jax, and pined for her Thomas, SAMCRO was her favorite ""child""."
Sonsofanarchy,2xrrb2,gizmatic,-2,Thu Mar 5 04:21:59 2015 UTC,"What do you need clarification on exactly? If you've seen the entire series, then it's safe to assume you know what everyone else knows, potentially more because not everyone is up to date.  Did you only focus on certain elements on the show the first time around? Because their relationship is a major part of the series and is pretty frequently spelt out for you."
Sonsofanarchy,2xrrb2,BillNyeStillHigh,8,Tue Mar 3 10:36:39 2015 UTC,then it's safe to assume you know what everyone else knows   Everyone has their own interpretations and their own questions. There is no single definitive answer here so let the person ask his question
Sonsofanarchy,2xrrb2,BillNyeStillHigh,0,Tue Mar 3 11:02:33 2015 UTC,"My point is that there relationship is a HUGE theme of the show; it seems really unrealistic to me that you wouldn't at least have some kind of understanding of the situation - of course everything is open to interpretation, but not everything, and not everything is ENTIRELY subjective. For example, to say they had a sexual relationship is wrong; it's simply not there. So no, sometimes things are as they seem, and this particular dynamic was pushed in our faces over and over again. Unless you half watch the show while playing Candy Crush, it's impossible to miss."

Sonsofanarchy,2xsnz1,Weltall548,5,Tue Mar 3 15:52:28 2015 UTC,"Season 3 -  Belfast arc is too long, too stupid and unrealistic (but the whole Irish plot line is guilty of that), Welliver's accent, Stahl basically becoming a pantomime villain.   Redeemed by final episode."
Sonsofanarchy,2xsnz1,hutchero,4,Wed Mar 4 12:45:19 2015 UTC,"Season 1 was more like an intro to the world of Charming. I do feel like there could have been tighter story telling that led up to the Hit being placed on Opie that killed Donna. I liked Season 1, it was a good combo of light and dark and the characters had 'pop' to them. They were on screen for a few moments at most, but you knew who was who from their stage presence. Juice and Chibs were obviously buddies, Juice was brainy, but a good bit clueless. Jax was heir-apparent, and the cocky bastard knew exactly who and what he was. Chibs, Sack and Juice were Jaxs boys within the club. Clay, Tig and Bobby were the ""older gen."" Piney was Piney and God help the fool he had a problem with it.  Season 2:Ethan Zobelle was creepy, but he was a ""hands off"" villian, he had others to do his dirty work. He was a mastermind who screwed up SAMCROS gun connections which served as a conduit to introduce IRA people. But, yeah, Zobelle didn't do much himself. I do feel that they were sloppy with the Abel being kidnapped plot--the writing for that plot thread was exceedingly weak. Why would Tara go back to the house? How did Sack know that she was there? If Cameron had caught up to and attacked them in the street, and taken Abel as a hostage/shield to escape then it would have been better writing and less non-sensical.  Season 3: This season suffered from the mess that they made of the end of Season 2 end  a bad case of The Main Hero is the Only Hero. It would have been very amazing to have an arch where SAMCRO pulled together to do something for someone besides the Royal Family. Personally I loved the Ireland arch, it was cool to see SAMBEL and see glimpses of Chibs origin, (he's my favorite character) but it annoyed me that Chibs's plot got less time than Taras in Season 3. Season 3 should have been about SAMCRO in the wider sense. It focused on Jax and Tara to the extreme and was a very narrow view of a wider story. Tig and Kozik should have been able to do something right in the absence of Jax. I mean, A member of the First 9, TWO Sgt. at Arms, a couple of prospects with the help of the friggin ATF couldn't protect Lumpy, Find Salazar and his pinched faced hussy or get Tara back? For real? Then what good are any of them? Salazar was not a bloody mastermind.  Instead, Jax flew around the world to rescue his son and then raced back intime to save Tara too. Oh, and Maureen Ashby gave him some letters that he didn't even get. Whoopy-damn-do.  I wanted more Chibs background, I wanted more Tig and Kozik at each others throats and still getting shit done. They alluded to too much shit but didn't show or tell us about the characters. (Kozik vs Tig--what was the story behind the dog? Chibs and Fiona, what was their story?)  Season 4 It was a good deal better, but this was the season where Tara sealed her fate and I didn't care about anything else that happened to her. Jax asked her to go and she came running back--Tara sealed her fate and it felt almost like she was doing it out of equal parts pride and to scorn Gemma, not out of love for Jax and certainly not out of love for her boys. She wanted to prove to herself/Gemma/the World that she was MC-Queen material when, no darling you aren't.  Season 5 It was sort of the fall out of Season 4, it wasn't too bad or too good. The worst part was RICO. I mean, it shouldn't bee too hard to figure out that 1) you're all being watched and/or 2) there is a rat amongst you. That is how RICO works--you need past and present crimes. His reason for keeping the RICO case secret was silly. If the Feds couldn't make the RICO case, they can always just swoop in and arrest you all while you're hauling cocaine and illegal weapons and still put you away for life you silly goose. Again, too much Gemma and Tara, not enough SAMCRO.  Season 6Yeah, all the shit that SAMCRO did and does and its a school shooting with a weapon that wasn't owned or used by any of the members that brings them to their knees, yeah right. There was no linking that gun to SOA, it was a weak plot, I think they did it for sensationalism. Clays death was premature.  Season 7 This could turn into a term paper. The show was unrealistic by its own standards."

I thought Tara's hospital scene was one of the best acting moments in the entire series. Weird.   But to answer your question, the biggest problem with each season (with the exception of Season 2 and maybe Season 5) was Gemma getting away with everything.

Sonsofanarchy,2xhtun,carolinindy,12,Sat Feb 28 22:45:55 2015 UTC,That is a painful scene. And to top it off - Alesund playing in the background. :(  Sidenote: Jax's hair and beard are on point in this scene.

I got excited but I was sad thinking about it! It was a highly emotional scene!"

His heart just breaks as he realizes that his farm life with Gemma can never be.  You see every ounce of that heartbreak in a single split-second on Nero's face."
Sonsofanarchy,2xhtun,CatherineWright89,6,Sun Mar 1 15:05:58 2015 UTC,Probably Jimmy Smitts greatest moment as an actor.
Sonsofanarchy,2xhtun,CatherineWright89,3,Sun Mar 1 17:37:27 2015 UTC,"Yep - really great scene. You really feel for him as he learns just how much of a monster Gemma really is, and how he had all this love in the world for a murderess. The scene that really got me was right after when he's sitting on the sidewalk and crying while he fervently scratches his arms. :("
Sonsofanarchy,2xhtun,Kopannie,14,Sun Mar 1 20:28:07 2015 UTC,"A mothers work was by far the saddest for me. I think I died a bit inside watching that episode, Tara and the boys were so close to a happy ending, and Jax had Tara and the boys to come out of jail to and instead he got Tara dead in their kitchen because of crazy Gemma and her bad temper. That cry from Jax at the end was heartbreaking.  Hands was also sad because it was the end of all the could have beens, all the hopes of leaving charming for Jax and Tara.   Papas Goods was really upsetting, not only cos it was the end of the show as a whole but it was the end for Jax, I was emotionally traumatised for at least an hour after that episode. Hoping it wasn't all for nothing and cursing Gemma for giving Abel that ring!!  The episode with juice telling Jax the truth was epically emotional too. The acting from charlie hunnam in that scene was extraordinary.   Let's just say the show as a whole damaged my heart and made me cry multiple times! So worth the tears tho!!!"
Sonsofanarchy,2xhtun,Zantoo,5,Sun Mar 1 02:41:09 2015 UTC,"Good call on ""Hands"" -- the hospital scene still gives me chills.   And I agree that ""A Mother's Work"" is the saddest of the sad. It's really hard for me to re-watch knowing what happens. The moment when Jax returns home after saying goodbye to the club and he calls out for Tara with his signature ""babe"" and a big smile on his face but as an audience knowing what lays in the room next to him -- a little part of me died in that moment."
Sonsofanarchy,2xhtun,boosh44,7,Sun Mar 1 03:11:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah- the hospital scene where Tara tells Jax that they aren't going anywhere is chilling- I wish Jax would have kept his promise if getting out! He was so determined that they would leave. That was the beginning of the end for Jax and Tara I think. It's still a really hard episode to watch, especially when you know how far he would go to protect her and he loses her because of his horrible mother!!   I re watched a mothers work last week and it's so horrible to watch the park scene in particular. Where Tara thinks Jax will hurt her and he realises how he has acted, then where they make up. I always loved the Jax and Tara relationship, I loved Tara too- I know a lot of people hated her but I thought she was a brilliant character. I definitely think her death and Jax finding her was the saddest part of the whole show!"
Sonsofanarchy,2xhtun,AppleTrees4,5,Sun Mar 1 17:16:02 2015 UTC,"I debated adding the park scene as a ""sad"" scene but it ends on a hopeful note so I withheld it. I do think it's one of the best scenes in the entire show and an acting tour de force for both Siff and Hunnam (but Siff in particular). Reading through the SOA official guide and the breakdown of this episode, it was interesting to discover that Sutter wanted Charlie/Jax to approach the scene with the idea to give himself up but still filled with anger, remorse, guilt, etc. And he said something like, Jax sees how much pain Tara is in and he immediately cracks realizing how much he has put her through and how he could never hate her/she is all he has... so so sad. :("
Sonsofanarchy,2xhtun,gingersnapyoface,3,Sun Mar 1 17:30:19 2015 UTC,"I actually read that yesterday in the book. It's interesting they they dedicated about five pages to that one episode. I loved reading about that episode! Yes. That was one of the best performances from Maggie Stiff. I think that and the hospital scene. You can see how scared she looks when Abel runs towards her shouting daddy, it's a brilliant scene. That's my favourite episode to be honest. It's the one that upset me the most, I think I sobbed for a good half an hour after it, but I loved that Tara told him she loved him and they fixed their relationship, and all the lies and cheating was swept aside because Jax was doing the right thing! If Tara had died and she and Jax were on bad terms I don't think I could have coped!"
Sonsofanarchy,2xhtun,drchasedanger,3,Sun Mar 1 17:59:47 2015 UTC,Meeeeee too. I still haven't watched most of season 7 just can't
Sonsofanarchy,2xhtun,duceyo,6,Sun Mar 1 11:02:16 2015 UTC,"When Jax finds Tara's body was by far the worst for me. Opie was rough but I don't remember crying, just shocked."
Sonsofanarchy,2xhtun,slightlyobsessedSOA,7,Sun Mar 1 01:17:29 2015 UTC,"ITA. I really liked Opie but by Season 5, I didn't really see his character going anywhere. He was ready to die.   Tara's death pains me for so many reasons but the most important being: she was one of the only characters who didn't want to die. She didn't get a choice. Gemma was ready for that bullet, Jax was prepared to die, Opie willingly sacrificed himself for the club, Clay was living on borrowed time, etc. Tara was SO close to getting out, her and Jax were in love and their boys would be safe. It was so so sad."
Sonsofanarchy,2xhtun,slightlyobsessedSOA,6,Sun Mar 1 03:17:07 2015 UTC,"A little late to the party here, but wanted to share. I agree with all of these, Opie's wake, Jax in the market, Jax finding Tara, etc, but the episode that breaks my heart is when Gemma finally tells Jax and Clay about the rape. Taking into consideration what Gemma has dealt with in the past, her coping with the horror of the rape and keeping it a secret, combined with the horror and anger and pain in Jax and Clay's faces, pretty gut wrenching. And when Jax goes to her and kisses her hands, just, ugh."
Sonsofanarchy,2xhtun,GeneralTry,1 point,Sun Mar 1 06:26:47 2015 UTC,"I think ""Balm"" provides one of the best ""song"" moments in the series - towards the end, the music montages started to lose their significance but I will always point to ""Mary"" and that scene as one of the greatest moments of a song + emotionally charged conversation coming together to inform the performances and ultimately the tragedy. I love how different Jax and Clay's reactions are to Gemma's reveal - the young son full of rage and anger, the older man full of shame and regret. Beautifully done.   That being said, I still fucking hate Gemma."
Sonsofanarchy,2xhtun,slightlyobsessedSOA,5,Sun Mar 1 20:25:20 2015 UTC,When Gemma killed Tara it was pretty sad..  Pretty much set the tone for the final season. At that my point my thoughts shifted to wondering if anyone at all would survive in the end.
Sonsofanarchy,2xhtun,BigMike0228,6,Sun Mar 1 13:12:26 2015 UTC,Bobby. I sobbed like I had lost one of my closest friends.
Sonsofanarchy,2xhtun,BigMike0228,5,Sun Mar 1 15:03:53 2015 UTC,"I definitely agree with the season 6 finale. When I first saw it, I just covered my mouth with my hands in silent horror right when Jax arrived and I think I was just staring at my blank screen for like 10 minutes after it ended. That was one of the most gut wrenching things I've ever seen on a TV show.  Other than that, the episode after Opie's death always really got to me, and the one when Tig watches his daughter get burned alive."
Sonsofanarchy,2xhtun,FireRoy,2,Sun Mar 1 03:28:32 2015 UTC,"""I think I was just staring at my blank screen for like 10 minutes after it ended."" -- YUP. Me too.

Sonsofanarchy,2xhtun,PsychedelicSloth,6,Sun Mar 1 00:20:46 2015 UTC,"Coming out of lurkdom for this ... never have I had a show affect me emotionally as Sons of Anarchy  1) The Sleep of Babies - I wasn't all that connected to the character of Donna, but being a wife and mother, I was devastated for Opie and their kids  2) A Mother's work, loved Tara and Jax, specifically for how happy Tara made Jax, everything I'd hoped for through 6 seasons came crashing down, I knew no matter what there was no happy ending for season 7, life or death for Jax, didn't matter without Tara  3) Papa's goods - watching Jax say goodbye to his boys, heart wrenching, his death wasn't all that sad, but I was so sad for those he left behind"
Sonsofanarchy,2xhtun,BigMike0228,4,Sun Mar 1 03:04:48 2015 UTC,"I also would like to add ""Hands"" to this list, but only upon re-watch as it now marks the beginning of the end ..."

Also, What a Piece of Work Man Is:  The scene by the van where we see Tig saying goodbye and Happy crying.  There is something heart wrenching in the moments through the series when  see Happy crying or upset.  I think it's because both, so often he is the comic relief and also he is such a hardened, cold person.  Seeing the contrast is even more devestating."
Sonsofanarchy,2xhtun,Cornwalace,1 point,Sun Mar 1 17:36:34 2015 UTC,"I hope I don't get downvoted for this because I do think Hunnam is a great actor but that last scene in the Season 2 finale is an example of his (early on) overacting lessened the emotional impact of a rather tragic scene. I will always look back at that scene as the moment he scream-talks ""they took my soooooooonnnnnnnn"" -- I don't know, it just rang false with me. He's hugely impressive in other emotionally charged scenes but for whatever reason, that one line and the way he delivered it came across as silly."

Sonsofanarchy,2xhtun,Frost134,3,Sun Mar 1 00:56:12 2015 UTC,The last one. It gave me an almost fatal case of the sads. Especially that damned song. It stuck with me and made me just want to give up.

A lot of if has to do with the fact that I love Ron Pearlman regardless of the character, but the fact that the one actual thing he wanted in life, which was for Gemma to ""love"" him was made I to...that...just struck a very tragic chord with me."
Sonsofanarchy,2xhtun,RoronoaZoro1102,2,Sun Mar 1 05:49:30 2015 UTC,"By Season 6, I hated Gemma so much that I really wanted her to be shot dead by anyone... even if it came down to the little man, Abel Teller.

Sonsofanarchy,2xhtun,monkeyman035,2,Sun Mar 1 14:58:19 2015 UTC,Curious - what part of You Are My Sunshine? Or just the entire episode? The last few minutes were sad... mostly because Jax goes from being enraged to just completely devastated/broken. And I liked Nero comforting him.
Sonsofanarchy,2xhtun,Ellisj98,3,Sun Mar 1 17:33:32 2015 UTC,"Definitely the last few minutes, but aside from those I'd say Juice's overdose. Really pained me to see how bad things had gotten for the guy over the course of the show."

It was clear in that scene she loved him so much but she needed to put the safety of the boys first, and she was horrified at what he had become. Asking if she could say goodbye to the boys and begging Jax not to hurt her in front of them was heartbreaking. Maggie Siff was perfect in this scene.  My other was when Clay died. Yeah, I loved Clay. I know he was fucked up and mean and cunning but I think he tried really hard to repent, especially with Gemma and it was sad to watch his fall. To me, he was also one of the funniest/best parts of the earlier seasons."

The one scene with the mob was hilarious - ""Someone sneezes and you guys throw a punch. How do you get any work done?""  Re: Tara and her invisible network -- ITA. It's so strange that they never showed her outside of the hospital, her house or the clubhouse. She had to have some childhood friends and/or friends at the hospital. It would have been nice to see a genuine sisterhood - much like the boys and their brotherhood. There are some deleted scenes with Tara and Lyla which is the extent of her ""friendships"" outside of Gemma and the annoying redhead. She should have teamed up with Lowen! Lowen was awesome and her blazers ruled. I know the show is SONS of Anarchy but when you have two prominent female roles, it seems reasonable they could have a few friends that weren't dudes."
Sonsofanarchy,2xgrxs,CreepyAbelTeller,2,Sat Feb 28 18:49:30 2015 UTC,"I feel this way too. When Jax needed advice he had a whole club of guys to talk with, and even individually he had Chibs, Nero and in the beginning, Clay. Tara had Gemma and the hospital admin lady (Mary Margaret?). I always wondered what would have happened if Tara had a close friend to talk with - one who was presumably not an old lady and how this would have changed things with her. Even a nurse at the hospital to go for a drink with after work."
Sonsofanarchy,2xgrxs,Aguazul_,2,Sat Feb 28 20:50:36 2015 UTC,"I always envisioned her as having a close childhood friend who she lost touch with when she left Charming. She comes back 10+ years later, and her friend is a bit resentful of her just packing up and leaving but ultimately they get over it and resume their friendship. It would be interesting to see her bond with someone who presumably settled in the life that Tara so wanted to get away from - not the Old Lady life - someone who was content with a small town and small ambitions. Think Ava from Justified.   Hale was sort of a friend to Tara in the few seasons he was around. It was inferred he wanted to be more than friends with her (which would have made for a nice Unser-Gemma-Clay parallel) but at least she would have had someone who was relatively normal and not a criminal to bond with in times of distress.   On another note, I really wish we got a scene of Jax, Tara and the kids grocery shopping. They run into Alvarez and his wife. Chaos ensues!"
Sonsofanarchy,2xgrxs,CreepyAbelTeller,2,Sat Feb 28 20:58:59 2015 UTC,"Yes to the grocery shopping scene! They were small-town folk who never did anything in their small town.  It would have been nice to see Jax actually spending time with his kids playing/caring for them the way that the other members of the club did.  I mean if Happy can actually give Abel his breakfast, surely Jax can do something more than rub his head as he breezes out the door?  It would have been nice to see Opie at least try and be a dad to his kids. I mean you never see Opie even speak to his kids except in that one episode early in season 1.  The Rewatch has made me nostalgic for the snippets of simpler times we saw through out seasons 1-3. The boys being silly and stuff. I can't believe that Tigs fear of dolls is never exploited by Chibs and/or Juice. I mean...C'mon!!! I could think of a dozen ways to torment the poor guy!"

Come to think on it, the crimes were probably felonies: Unlawful sedation/drugging, breaking and entering, since they broke into his office, civil misconduct/stripping his clothes, sexual assault/having Venus hump him, battery/beating him over the head and slander or libel since they used the pictures for blackmail. I'm sure that unlawfully recording someone during a 'sex act' is a violation of some sort also.  Most of SAMCRO was on probation during that stunt so committing crimes during that time was also a crime."

Sonsofanarchy,2x659o,CreepyAbelTeller,1 point,Thu Feb 26 00:16:30 2015 UTC,"Yea, but Jax and Gemma's relationship was so twisted and kind of abnormal."
Sonsofanarchy,2x659o,CreepyAbelTeller,2,Thu Feb 26 21:55:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I agree. Still - it's not like he lacked common sense. He put some distance between them in Season 5 and he was lippy to her when necessary. It just seems like he brushed off A LOT of seemingly deranged things she said in a ""oh HAHA that's just my crazy ol' mother saying stuff!"" kind of a way."
Sonsofanarchy,2x659o,Kwitcher_Bitchin,2,Thu Feb 26 22:59:28 2015 UTC,Definitely agree with the brushing off.

Sonsofanarchy,2x048w,SylvesterMcMonkey,18,Tue Feb 24 16:33:02 2015 UTC,HAHA. This is almost - ALMOST - as bad as when they photoshopped a (floating) poster on the wall of Wendy's room in the opening montage of the season 7 premiere.

Sonsofanarchy,2x34b9,AwwNawwGodzirra,8,Wed Feb 25 06:22:52 2015 UTC,It ran its course. The last season and the last episode were probably as perfect as I could have wanted.

She ended up buying some SoA bikinis and the lingerie. She sent us MODs a message asking if it was ok for her to post pics of what she bought since all the guys posted pics of items they bought; caveat being she wanted to wear the items. The ensuing exchange of messages was interesting and hilarious.  I believe the rule at that time was if you ask the Clubhouse for help in locating something wearable from the show you have to wear it and post it here once you get it. Pretty sure that is still a standing rule.  Just an FYI ;)  a."

I actually really liked Roosevelt and wanted him til the end of the show but he deserved that hit. It was nice to see him be all fuck this im ready to flip a table instead of letting some tears fall.  Their was a weird satisfaction of Chibs beating up juice too. It did suck though cause you knew it was the end of that friendship. But it was like when you were a kid and you watched your sibling or friend get spanked after they acted a fool. The warning signs were there she raised her voice, called them by their first and middle name, and they still continued that stupid ass behavior!  You don't like it or want it to happen but at the same time you're glad someone reigned the fool in and hope their behavior improves.  Gemma smacking cherry with the skateboard. I think anyone who has ever gotten cheated on has imagined doing that to their spouse, the person the spouse cheated with, or both.  Tara vs gemma every single time. They were both annoying to me so I supported them taking it out on each other instead. Special mention to tara vs the desk.  Chibs cutting jimmys face and killing him. And obviously opie vs stahl"

Jax flipping the script (tricking the audience thinking he was selling out Tig)- great twist by Sutter.   -Jax almost banging his half-sister was somewhat disgustingly hilarious as both mothers stood in awe of what they just witnessed.   -When Jax went and 'talked' to his Dad at his Dad's death site on the highway (Finale)

I wouldn't be shocked if JT tasked him with trying to raise Jax ""right"" and it went to hell. Sort of like what Jax did with Nero.  The difference is Jax realized you can't raise kids in the club, they have to be far away."
Sonsofanarchy,2wz0cn,HCPage,3,Thu Feb 26 15:38:40 2015 UTC,The one thing I don't understand was that if JT killed himself why were Clay and Gemma so worried about Jax finding out that they had killed him? Even before the letters became a thing there were many references made between the two of them that they had indeed killed JT.
Sonsofanarchy,2wz0cn,phunkysai,3,Fri Feb 27 10:39:10 2015 UTC,"Omigosh, that was one of the biggest things that never got answered.  What were in the other letters from Maurine that Tara and Gemma destroyed?  Gemma should have 'fessed up right before Jax shot her (in a way making it easier for him to pull the trigger)."

Sonsofanarchy,2wz0cn,DundieAward,1 point,Fri Feb 27 14:07:17 2015 UTC,"I just assumed he knew they'd tampered with his bike as he suspected they were having an affair and probably wanted him dead, he also would have known something wasn't right pretty quickly after setting off if he'd been riding that bike all those years maybe that just cemented his decision to kill himself."
Sonsofanarchy,2wz0cn,sneezingcat18,1 point,Sat Mar 7 11:10:54 2015 UTC,"I think he knew that day something on the bike was off, and took it as a signal to actually move on. I think of it more as smashing to stories together rather than a plot hole."

Sonsofanarchy,2wz0cn,truthnineseven,2,Tue Feb 24 14:03:01 2015 UTC,"It is also important to point out that, although Jax hated the club.   The club had given him everything , family , money and most importantly,   An Identity. Which made it basically impossible to walk away and just be a family man."
Sonsofanarchy,2wz0cn,zak420,2,Tue Feb 24 18:36:07 2015 UTC,all I can say is....it was perfectly set up for Abel to come back in 15-20 years trying to associate with the club

Sonsofanarchy,2wyot4,randyboozer,1 point,Wed Feb 25 17:06:39 2015 UTC,"When I first watched season 3 I found it pretty annoying... I was actually cheering against Jax recovering his baby because I was sick of the damn story.  That being said the last episode of season 3 is consistently ranked as one of the very best if not the best episode of the series.  And, when rewatching the show, I came to really enjoy the ireland episodes just for the style and backstory."
Sonsofanarchy,2wyot4,CreepyAbelTeller,1 point,Thu Feb 26 10:45:12 2015 UTC,"What episode are you on?   The season is worth it for the finale. Trust me.   My main issue with the whole ""they took my son!!!"" Ireland arc was that it was bloated and introduced a bunch of characters no one cares about (with the exception of Maureen Ashby). The whole Trinity-Jax thing was so dumb. And the priest was drinking JT's koolaid and no one was listening."
Sonsofanarchy,2wyot4,homedude,0,Sun Mar 1 03:23:33 2015 UTC,Not getting in to specifics but season 3 was pretty disappointing to me for many reasons.  The redeeming factor is the season 3 finale which made the previous episodes a little easier to forget.
Sonsofanarchy,2wyot4,skinsfan14,0,Tue Feb 24 14:30:08 2015 UTC,"They arent done yet, most of season 3 was my least favorite but like the other person said the finale is the redeeming factor, hang in there it ties up some loose ends."

If Ryan had a drug issue, or anything else causing him to rapidly and excessively lose weight, I really doubt that they'd point it out in the show, it would be too cruel even for Kurt. Mary calls him ""too skinny"" in the S2 premiere.  After he got upgraded to a series regular (Kurt's original plan was to kill him instead of Donna) he must have worked his ass off to get rid of the love handles. Losing weight made Opie less ""homely"" if it makes sense, it was a more appropriate look when he fully committed himself to the club. Long sleeves is just personal preference.  If anything, Ryan should be praised for dedication to the role and his rapid weight loss."
Sonsofanarchy,2wwkxr,besyuziki,1 point,Tue Feb 24 01:14:27 2015 UTC,"I'm not at all criticising his performance or anything, it was just an observation that I wanted other opinions on. I think he is perfect for the role of Opie and did an amazing performance. I think his looks in the face when Jax tells him he looks like shit, when Donna takes the kids and leaves, looked all to real but that's just how amazing of an actor he is. After reading another post somebody had wrote questioning his wardrobe, and people explained that riding gets rather chilly. I had not thought about that, but I am in no way trying to criticize his performance or shed negative light on him.  Also, I'm not trying to argue or get an attitude in my response, so please dot take it that way. :)"

But most of the characters were always shown with long sleeved flannels or jackets, and when it's sunny, eyes get pinned. And it's California, so it's mostly always sunny. So now that I think about it, I'd say no."
Sonsofanarchy,2wwkxr,FashionablyFake,2,Mon Feb 23 21:27:32 2015 UTC,"And even if it's night during a scene, there will still be lights from the cameras. That could be why you say his eyes are pinned during the night too."

Sonsofanarchy,2wmqlt,Start_button,4,Sat Feb 21 15:07:12 2015 UTC,"Did she deserve her death? That is a matter of opinion but Tara was not liked for a lot of reasons.  She and Jax were first loves. The high school sweethearts. However, she knew Jax's love of the club and all about the lifestyle in whic he was in and not leaving and KNEW THEN it was not something she wanted so she left. When she returns in season 1 she isn't coming back because she wanted to be in Charmimg. Her father died and she didn't even come back. She didn't come back because she knew she loved Jax and missed him. She came back because there was a crazy abusive FBI agent who happened to be her ex-bf stalking her.   Yes here and Jax rekindled and Jax had never stopped loving her. Yet at several points for her own safety he broke it off with her and tried to get her to leave. Especially after things were getting more serious within the club because he knew that she wasn't safe, it wasn't a life she wanted, but she REFUSED to leave and even at one point decided to be the new matriarch of the club.  She got involved doing things she should never have done and she did them on her own. Even after having been told not to. The whole thing with Otto in the prison. She was asked to get him ONE message but continued to the poit it got someone innocent killed.  She didn't have the ability to go against Gemma. Props for standing up for herself and trying but Gemma not being restrained by the threat of losing her grandkids would have wiped the floor with her early on.   Tara's actions when after she finally got it figured out that she needed to go was a HUGE reason people wanted her dead. She set Gemma up, end rounded her husband Jax, lied to everyone but the hospital head, and planned on disappearing taking not only her biological son but her step-son and not ever letting Jax see them. And while doing all of this and being cold as hell to Jax, who had no idea there were issues, and fucking him just to try and keep him in check (see episode where she is on her back looking bored as hell), he goes off and has an affair with the whore house chick. She pushed him that way and planned on bailing anyways but went absolutely apeshit because he was with someone else.  All in all Tara was a user and liar. She played games she couldn't win and manipulated everyone. Not one person she interacted with was spared her manipulations or lies.   Some would argue she was doing what any mother would do. Maybe so but she KNEW EXACTLY WHAT SHE WAS GETTING IN TO! and was given several warnings by several different people and was told to go several times but made the choice to stay and then flipped and turned tail. Then did the most heinous thing she could have done in her position by trying to steal the kids and turn state's witness against her husband, mother in law, and the club. Even though she didn't in the end she was caught talking. And in the end that was what got her killed because Gemma was under the impression she followed through with it and had no clue it was Jax who turned himself in to keep Tara out of trouble."
Sonsofanarchy,2wmqlt,Start_button,2,Sat Feb 21 16:05:28 2015 UTC,"I couldn't have said this better myself. I liked Tara as a character early on (maybe up to season 3 or 4), but I think a lot of people hold her up to be this candidate for sainthood, which she wasn't. I don't think there's a point of saying whether or not she deserved her death, but I do think her death was a consequence of her own actions."
Sonsofanarchy,2wmqlt,fpgranny,3,Sat Feb 21 18:22:16 2015 UTC,"I don't believe Tara deserves saint hood, but I do feel life she was doing the best she could with what she had.  She was in Chicago until the Fed guy started stalking her. She came back to charming to move on with her life, and the guy followed her. Her and Jax hit it off again, so she tried to nut up and make the best of a bad situation. She cared for Jax, but she knew his lifestyle, yet she still tried to make it work.   And no matter what she did, Gemma just wouldn't cut her any slack.   She did back room surgery for the club on several occasions, raise able like he was her own, and tried to be the best mother and wife she could be.   Was she a saint? No. Was she a bitch at times? Sure. Did she deserve to die the way she did? Absolutely not!  Gemma's decision to do what she did ruined Jax's life, the boy's lives, Nero's, Unser's, Juice's (although he didn't need any help with that), Bobby's, and about 75 other people, on top of her own.  Spoiler>If anyone deserved to die, it was Gemma. In my opinion her death was not remotely harsh enough. They should have found her rotted, dismembered, mutilated corpse years down the line. What she did was just insane.  However, I'm now seeing a huge bit of irony here. They were both just doing what they thought was right for their family. It's such a shame that they couldn't get along. Just imagine had Gemma stepped aside as she should have and allowed Tara to fulfill her duties as the head old lady, they may have been able to do some truly great things for the club."
Sonsofanarchy,2wmqlt,Start_button,2,Sat Feb 21 18:49:03 2015 UTC,"I don't believe Tara deserves saint hood, but I do feel life she was doing the best she could with what she had.   BINGO.  Tara and Jax loved each other deeply and purely, something that Gemma could never understand.  But I have to respectfully disagree with the statement that BOTH women were just doing what they thought was right for their families.  99.9% of the time, what Gemma did was for Gemma, not ""for the club"" or ""for her boys"":  she wanted Jax to be in the life.  How could any mother want that for her children?  Chuck Klosterman wrote a book titled I Wear The Black Hat in which he defines a villain as the one ""that knows the most and cares the least""; I think we can all agree that Gemma is intimately acquainted with how SAMCRO destroys lives, and yet she actively encourages the only son she has left to be at the head of the table.  Fuck Gemma and everybody that looks like Gemma.   In other news, Chibbs is my spirit animal."
Sonsofanarchy,2wlb47,besyuziki,14,Fri Feb 20 21:44:28 2015 UTC,"Poor Wayne was one of the most complicated characters with a tragic story, easily up there with Opie, Tara and Jax, albeit with less focus. It could be very interesting to have some Unser-centric episodes (or at least subplots), especially after Dayton Callie made it to the opening credits.   He practically became SAMCRO's doormat mainly because of his unconditional, unrequited love for Gemma, and justified it as ""learning to work with the MC to protect the town"" whenever Hale or someone else confronted him. He lured a federal agent into a trap, knowing SAMCRO would execute her. His wife bailed when he was getting treated for cancer (just think about it, devastating betrayal coming from one's significant other). He couldn't walk away because he was living on borrowed time, he just settled in to the T&M compound with that piece of shit camper. That was all he had. And last but not least, he SPOILER"
Sonsofanarchy,2wlb47,dcj667,7,Sat Feb 21 00:26:50 2015 UTC,"And not one time did he come off as naive or ignorant. Maybe a little willfully blind at times, but I think his overall resigned nature due to his cancer and his career countered that. I agree, fantastic character and perfectly acted by Dayton Callie (almost better than Charlie Utter in my eyes)."

Sonsofanarchy,2wlb47,Gargantuan_Cranium,5,Sat Feb 21 20:04:02 2015 UTC,One of the most tragic aspects of Wayne's character arc is that he DIDN'T die from the cancer.  So many of his choices (mostly defending/covering for SAMCRO) came from his being resigned to his fate...which went into remission!

Yes, he loved Gemma and was too close to figure out the truth but the fact that he TURNED on Tara the minute he knew she set up Gemma (and knowing all the bad shit Gemma had done for years and years) and was the fool who gave Gemma the wrong info that led to Tara's death... no, he doesn't get a pass.

So, in some prisons they convert gymnasiums or large common buildings into housing units, where they essentially bunk a bunch of low risk inmates in one room. This could also be essentially their depiction of Jail which is different from prison, and is used for short term sentencing less than a year or someone who is waiting trial.   In the case of Clay he was in protective custody which is similar in a lot of ways to secure housing as they don't allow a lot of interaction with other people for their safety. And obviously in some cases where they are put in the rooms by themselves it's for the secure housing unit which is essentially prison's ""timeout"" corner.   The traditional prison cell is usually a bunk bed where two inmates share a small room which is depicted in a few scenes.   Hope this clarifies!"

Couldn't they have one, honest conversation where they really addressed all their problems? Sure, the park scene in the Season 6 finale provided a bit of that but by then, it was too late. I feel like Tara should have been much more up front with Jax about her issues with Gemma (or ya know, just tell him that mommy dearest assisted in the death of his father and excommunicate that bitch right then and there). I can't imagine a scenario where Jax wouldn't have been on her side."
Sonsofanarchy,2w96d6,CreepyAbelTeller,6,Wed Feb 18 03:47:37 2015 UTC,Not really. It kinda ties in with his Shakespearean style. The Bard was all about that miscommunication shit.

They stayed at home and got shooting lessons off Jemma!... Club history lessons and learning how to ride a motorcycle lessons were probably part of the old lady curriculum aswell Able is safe tho- that kid knows how to use his words!! :)

Sonsofanarchy,2w96d6,soupastar,2,Fri Feb 20 16:56:07 2015 UTC,"I'll add that I think most of the issues with Jax and Tara, and the deals being made with the DA could have been solved just by Jax going to Tara and telling her about the deal he was trying to make.  It's not as if Tara hadn't found out about a similar deal made by the club in season 3, and it's not like Jax would of had to tell her the club's full plan involving Clay and killing everyone off.  To me he would have even been a good husband by telling her because as far as he knew she was sitting around worried about going to jail, and him telling her could have given her hope for a way out.    In reality his telling her would have prevented her from trying to accept the deal offered to her whenever Patterson shot her down, and it would have prevented her from accepting the deal following what went down with the Irish towards the end of season 6, and MAYBE Patterson would have accepted the mess Jax left to her and gave him the deal he wanted since she wouldn't of had Tara to run back to in order to try and go after the SONS."
Sonsofanarchy,2w96d6,billy8383,3,Wed Feb 18 18:12:50 2015 UTC,"I honestly do not understand why Jax didn't tell Tara about his impending deal with the DA. Like - from a purely logical standpoint - what the fuck was the point of keeping her in the dark? Yes, there was growing distance between them and Tara was clearly pushing him away but Jax was trying everything (minus porking the local madam) to be let back in. He even told Tara at one point in Season 6 that he spent all night trying to figure out a way to help her with her case -- wouldn't just telling her of a possible deal on the table be helpful? Not only for her peace of mind but for the sake of their relationship which was clearly starting to fall apart? It was like this HUGE secret between them and it made no sense whatsoever."

I don't know the exact rules but i'm assuming if he had just left the club, there would have been some blowback. Plus, I don't think Jax really ever had it in him to walk away from the club because he loved it too much. When he finally realized that he had basically played a part in the death of every single person he ever loved and that it would bleed onto his children, he made a more final decision. But it took him a long time to get there."
Sonsofanarchy,2w9rrs,CreepyAbelTeller,2,Wed Feb 18 03:51:09 2015 UTC,"I was just watching the season four opener, when Jax proposes to Tara he says that he just wants to stay for a while, make some bank and then get out. Here he is talking about how the club has turned from brotherhood to greed and fear and that's his excuse for staying! Greed, because he doesn't want to live off of Tara's money, he wants to make his money from the cartel deal,  and fear, because he doesn't know anything else. I think that if he asked to leave, after everything they went through, he could have left. I think they would have voted to let him go. But did he really want to leave? No. No he didn't."
Sonsofanarchy,2w9rrs,stacyo72,1 point,Wed Feb 18 13:39:41 2015 UTC,"Didn't the NOMAD thing require a unanimous vote?  That would make me think that him being able to leave on good terms would also require a unanimous vote so maybe his thoughts were that all the other guys would respect his wishes and vote him out, but that Clay would never vote to allow him to leave since Clay and Gemma had always wanted Jax to lead the club one day.  So maybe Jax was thinking he needed to give Clay a reason to allow him out?    Either way though in the context of the show I couldn't picture any blow back at Jax for leaving even if he didn't get a full vote because who in that club was going to strike against Jax or his family except maybe Clay?  And up to season 4 I couldn't even imagine that Jax would think Clay would try and harm him just for wanting out.  I think Jax just respected the rules of the club so much that if he left he wanted to do it by the rules and get the votes required in order to leave."
Sonsofanarchy,2w9rrs,billy8383,1 point,Wed Feb 18 18:04:16 2015 UTC,"Fate would have brought his ass right back. I think that was part of the tragedy/theme of the show.

Abel's last scene was awfully suggestive..."

Sonsofanarchy,2w8ll4,stacyo72,2,Wed Feb 18 02:14:24 2015 UTC,"Nah. Im good. This  is actually the first good  snow we've had. I work in a school, it's amazing how the staff probably wanted a snow day more than  the kids."
Sonsofanarchy,2w8ll4,CreepyAbelTeller,2,Wed Feb 18 02:16:42 2015 UTC,Oh I believe it. Snow days are great for all parties involved.

Sonsofanarchy,2w89hu,CreepyAbelTeller,3,Wed Feb 18 03:52:34 2015 UTC,Just for a laugh they could go with an alternate ending similar to what Breaking Bad did and have Gemma wake up in bed as Peg Bundy next to Al revealing that the whole series was just a dream by Peg.
Sonsofanarchy,2w89hu,billy8383,2,Wed Feb 18 18:23:10 2015 UTC,I would love to hear about all of the different directions they would have taken the show had actors not had to leave. Would be interesting to see what Sutter would have done with Half-Sack or Toric
Sonsofanarchy,2w89hu,YurneroSpin2Win,2,Tue Feb 17 23:59:10 2015 UTC,Episode commentary for more  than a couple episodes. Im a sucker for commentary and love when they all do it together.
Sonsofanarchy,2w5br7,GeneralTry,20,Tue Feb 17 02:17:25 2015 UTC,"did you not watch seasons 1-6!?  hated her character, man. to the bone."
Sonsofanarchy,2w5br7,Caseycrowe,11,Tue Feb 17 04:26:53 2015 UTC,"I'm surprised when people say they hated her from season 1 to 7, 4 onwards I can accept that but in the season where she is raped she stops Jax going nomad and the club pulling itself apart. With the direction Clay took the club Jax would have been dead as a nomad, he would have been a prime target to hurt SAMCRO. Gemma started off as a bitch with a secret but good intentions, it was only as the show moved forward that she became the catalyst for all the bad that happened.  I personally hated Gemma by the end, she ended up being the reason so many died but in the earlier seasons she toughened Jax up as he began to show weakness and she held the club together the only way she could."
Sonsofanarchy,2w5br7,BigZombieMonkey,5,Tue Feb 17 11:38:34 2015 UTC,"That's true, but I hated how she was constantly meddling and lying and manipulating everyone around her. She couldn't NOT get involved in everyone's business."

Sonsofanarchy,2w5br7,RedditsInBed,2,Tue Feb 17 14:27:54 2015 UTC,Looking back on the show she is the reason for most of the terrible and chaotic things that happen throughout the show. Including killing jax father.
Sonsofanarchy,2w5br7,Felixlives,1 point,Tue Feb 17 09:05:41 2015 UTC,yes of course. what she did at the end of season 6 pushed me over the limit though.  I almost cant bring myself to watch the last season seeing doing whatever she wants without any consequences
Sonsofanarchy,2w5br7,CSMom74,2,Tue Feb 17 04:29:38 2015 UTC,It's worth it.  Push through.
Sonsofanarchy,2w5br7,Kopannie,-2,Tue Feb 17 08:42:43 2015 UTC,I couldn't. I just watched the last 4 episodes or so

Sonsofanarchy,2w5br7,DirtyInRedPants,2,Sat Feb 21 14:06:00 2015 UTC,"Season 7 ruined the show for me. It lost some steam by Season 6. Meanwhile, every season prior was great.  By the time 7 came around, and the way it was written and directed -in my opinion- the show fell apart."
Sonsofanarchy,2w3lvk,bearsncubs10,32,Mon Feb 16 18:24:50 2015 UTC,"First off, someone recently posted about how greasy his hair is. A lot of focus on Ope's hygiene recently!  Honestly, though, he probably is sweaty under all of that - at least sometimes. Ryan Hurst would obviously be sweating while shooting scenes in that outfit, and so would Opie. In both cases, the outfit choice is partially aesthetic. The other guys were a lot of hoodies and such too, particularly Jax and Chibs. There's never much consistency across the board in terms of dressing for the weather.  A big part of it, though, is also riding. If you don't ride, it can be hard to grasp just how drastic the temperature difference can be. I'm the kind of guy who sweats peeling an orange, but I can be on the bike in boots, jeans, a hoody, and a denim jacket in the summer and be fine as long as I'm moving. Depending on where I am between rides, sometimes it's easier to just keep it all on then to take it off to just to put it back on when I'm back on the move."
Sonsofanarchy,2w3lvk,some_dunkaroos,9,Mon Feb 16 19:24:07 2015 UTC,"Riding, is absolutely the primary reason. I live and ride in Arizona and this time of year, its cold as shit (like 50-55) in the morning. I need my leather jacket at a minimum, but by lunch time its 75-80 and I no longer need it.    Also, the amount of layers you need really depends on your bike and speed. I have no windshield, so if I'm on a freeway doing 70-80 and its only 70 out, it still gets chilly. Layers are huge for being able to adjust on fly. I always noticed that Opie always had the most layers, but it never seemed odd to me."
Sonsofanarchy,2w3lvk,Thekobra,11,Mon Feb 16 23:39:09 2015 UTC,"""Only 70"" and 55 is ""cold as hell."" What I wouldn't give for that kind of weather right now! I'm in the northeast in the snow."
Sonsofanarchy,2w3lvk,some_dunkaroos,3,Tue Feb 17 03:15:45 2015 UTC,Yeah it's -8° where I am. If it was 55° I'd be in shorts and a t shirt. Usually 40° was my riding cut off. Lower than that just wasn't fun.
Sonsofanarchy,2w3lvk,grumpywarner,5,Tue Feb 17 06:45:22 2015 UTC,its cold as shit (like 50-55)    You're cute.  This was my drive into work one day last week.

But damn, I like looking awesome and badass, but I think the Cut would do that, without the need of some heavy leather jacket."
Sonsofanarchy,2w3lvk,some_dunkaroos,5,Mon Feb 16 19:27:54 2015 UTC,"I couldn't agree more.  In Breaking Bad (no spoilers), I kept thinking the same thing. I could understand Jesse wearing his big hoody all the time (skinny guy, meth, etc), but at some point Walt was wearing his jacket while digging a whole in the desert, out in the sun. WHY?!"
Sonsofanarchy,2w3lvk,monkeytoes77,6,Mon Feb 16 19:53:29 2015 UTC,New Mexican here - sometimes it's cold in the desert even though it doesn't look like it. Could have been a cold wind or one of the winter months.

Sonsofanarchy,2w3lvk,r0x0x,14,Mon Feb 16 22:05:47 2015 UTC,You can't start putting logic into this. Remember the time the small town gang was getting fucked with by the cartel and cia and had a major shoot out once a month and was never on the national news or had real federal heat come to stop them
Sonsofanarchy,2w3lvk,Jaymez82,1 point,Mon Feb 16 23:37:45 2015 UTC,The feds didn't come in to stop them because the feds were involved. CIA remember? It was the CIA that stopped Lincoln Potter's RICO case against them too.

Sonsofanarchy,2w3lvk,Thekobra,9,Tue Feb 17 18:49:54 2015 UTC,Some guys handle heat better than others.
Sonsofanarchy,2w3lvk,CalDY23,4,Mon Feb 16 19:12:25 2015 UTC,"As someone from Scotland, who has been to the USA in the Summer, i don't get it. It's SO hot over there during the summer. Admittedly I've only been to the New York/Pennsylvania areas, where it's really humid and apparently there's no humidity to the West, but it still must be incredibly hot.   If i don't walk around in shorts & a tank top there's like a 80% chance that i'll die. How they constantly go around in baggy jeans, and leather jackets and cuts and all that crap is insane."
Sonsofanarchy,2w3lvk,blahblahwhateverblah,3,Mon Feb 16 22:36:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the US is so big that it's tough to explain if you've never experienced it first hand. The west coast is much different than the east coast. It also varies dramatically depending where in the west you are.   Southern California (San Diego or LA) for example is low humidity and warm year round. Northern California (San Francisco) is still nice, but gets cold in the winters.    Also, your boddy adjusts pretty quickly. I live in AZ where the summers get to 110+ for a solid 6-8 weeks in July/August and the winters are at least 60-65. I've been here for a few years now, but I'm from Chicago. In the midwest if a random day in March happens to be 70+ and sunny people will call in sick to work just so they could spend some time in the sun. Now, I'd still grab a light jacket or hoodie if it's only 70 and sunny."
Sonsofanarchy,2w3lvk,AnchovyKiedis,3,Mon Feb 16 23:45:33 2015 UTC,"I live in Australia.  Have long hair like Opie, the beard isn't quite that glorious but y'know, it's there. I rarely wear shorts unless I'm at home. If I go out, I wear jeans and boots. If I'm going out somewhere 'nice', I'll wear the same thing but with a leather jacket. Before I started wearing collared shirts everywhere, I'd wear long sleeved ones because I liked them.  Honestly, you get used to it. It was about 38 (100ish) the other week, and I was gardening for half the day in jeans and a long sleeved shirt. I wasn't really that hot.  edit: wording"
Sonsofanarchy,2w3lvk,Acpt7567,3,Tue Feb 17 03:43:09 2015 UTC,"Honestly, the wool tooque made so much sense to me. They go around killing ppl left and right, so a tooque/beanie would keep his hair falling everywhere. That's just smart, while everyone else is leaving hair DNA everywhere. I don't think that's what the directors intended, but it's a realistic factor."
Sonsofanarchy,2w49be,BigZombieMonkey,5,Mon Feb 16 21:18:19 2015 UTC,I haven't watched the episode in awhile. From the screen caps you posted it's hard to tell. But maybe something like this.  http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B00NHY0GUA/ref=redir_mdp_mobile/192-5182926-3338847  Looks like a tanto style fixed blade. The handle is different from the one I linked but didn't really spend too much time looking.
Sonsofanarchy,2w49be,Hapa_Hombre,1 point,Tue Feb 17 06:13:27 2015 UTC,Yeah the screen caps are not great but they are literally the only frames I can get that even remotely shows what the knives look like. It's so frustrating and I did have a look at a few knives like the one you suggested but nothing seems to be a complete match. I'm starting to wonder if they are custom made.
Sonsofanarchy,2w49be,Darthdre758,3,Tue Feb 17 11:30:11 2015 UTC,"While obviously your still prove it otherwise, I always thought he used something like this.    https://www.karatemart.com/images/products/large/triangular-push-dagger.jpg"

Googled it then and realised he was actually from Newcastle UK. Your comment made me wonder if he'd moved down south from there at a young age, and maybe did have a similar accent to the film.

Sonsofanarchy,2w39hq,hutchero,7,Mon Feb 16 16:50:12 2015 UTC,Titus Welliver - I'd have learned how to do an Irish accent convincingly
Sonsofanarchy,2w39hq,gizmatic,4,Tue Feb 17 15:59:59 2015 UTC,"David Labrava--I'd have liked a Happy centric subplot for at least one episode that shed some light on his character. He was so loyal, so ""Yes I will"" about anything and everything that SAMCRO needed. Where does a guy like Happy come from? He's unrepentantly but not indiscriminately violent, ya'know? I mean, who just drives a pick axe through someones skull and goes about their day? No one but Happy Lowman.  Theo Rossi--I'd have liked some explanation for the background of my character. I mean, Juice had exactly one thing in his life--SAMCRO. He lived and breathed SAMCRO even when it was clear that SAMCRO was not what he needed/where he belonged. Juice was ""the little one"" in the club, he was the goofy kid brother and Chibs right hand man, before sh!t went south. He become isolated, depressed, withdrawn and lived on suicide watch. No one tried to get him help. To me, they showed us that SAMCRO felt bad for him, but mostly they felt bad about him ashamed of him. Kind of disgusted and disappointed at his weakness. I'd have liked to see Chibs and Juices relationship tend toward healed before that whole Tara-Gemma dust up. I mean, did they even really speak in seasons 5 and 6? Aside from the episode Salvage (which was awesome), I can't remember Juice and Chibs speaking or interacting which was weird because for 3.5 seasons they were side by side, buddies. Juice exhibited signs of an abandoned child  Tig--Where the Fck does someone like Tig Come from? I would have have liked to show Tig going through the stages of grief for Dawn and come out of it a visibly changed man. The reason why I say this is because, clearly Tig wasn't unfeeling. When he killed Donna, he became spun out. He was a mess. He couldn't function as Sgt. at Arms--he was hesitant and unsure, he was literally crippled by guilt until he came clean to Opie. Yet, he doesn't seem to grieve for Dawn. I know that the very absence of grief/expected emotion can be a symptom of shock, which is understandable, but they had THREE seasons for Tig to address it, and they never did.  Clay + Tig + Bobby -- In the first 3 seasons, they are the 3-Musketeers, Bossman, Reasonable Guy and Get-er-Done Guy--The mind, body and spirit of SAMCRO.  I'd have liked to see more of the relationship dynamic between them from the get go and I'd have liked to see it shift with time. Not peripherally but it could have been one of the many threads they wove into the show starting in late season 3.  Bobby Elvis--Oh man, I can never get enough of my favorite Fatboy on an old Fatboy! I can't wait to get ahold of his SOA comic, I want to know so much more about Bobby its unhealthy!"

Sonsofanarchy,2vzgb5,greenmonster4411,1 point,Sun Feb 15 21:17:58 2015 UTC,"Generally the seasons were added in mid October, so about two months after the release of the DVD and one after the premiere of the new season. If I remember right, the final season will be released on DVD in February, so if it follows the pattern of adding shortly after the physical release, it will most likely be on Netflix in April or May. Maybe sooner, since it's the final season and shows that have ended tend to have things before too long, but I wouldn't count on that. More than likely, it will be in April if they add it at all."

It is available right now in SD on Amazon here <--------- SPOILERS for just $25 to watch all 13 episodes and if you get the right plug in on top of that for your browser you can DL as you watch.  $25 for over 20 hours of entertainment is well worth the price of admission; especially when you consider the amount of time/the investment we have spent in our lives of epic tale of the Sons of Anarchy."

Sonsofanarchy,2vx8pa,Acpt7567,4,Mon Feb 16 04:39:07 2015 UTC,Even if you know the ending....I'm telling you man it's worth watching. You have no idea what you're about to see. It's not going to be meh at all.   Good luck brother.
Sonsofanarchy,2vx8pa,RJPennyweather,1 point,Sun Feb 15 00:06:25 2015 UTC,I agree with this guy. I just finished season 7 for the first time 2days ago. But about a week before that I wanted to listen to the SOA theme and when I was typing it into YouTube that same goddam spoiler popped up. Just know that the last couple episodes are still amazing. Despite the spoiler it was still an amazing last season.

Sonsofanarchy,2vx8pa,somefuckwho,2,Mon Feb 16 12:01:38 2015 UTC,Everythingup to 7 was great!. Season6 was awesome with what happened. It just was a bummer to see the way kurt handled the 6 finale and going into 7 amess.
Sonsofanarchy,2vx8pa,MicOxlong,1 point,Wed Feb 18 14:39:31 2015 UTC,"Season 6 could have been good but Kurt failed miserably with it's execution, and then season 7 just made it worse, not only because the season it's self was bad but also because it made the rest of the show obsolete, like season 7 could have just been its own show."

Im doing a rewatch and Jax himself even said ""No son shall kill himself"", when Juicey attempted to. I feel like he contradicted the whole show on seqson 7.

Sonsofanarchy,2vu6ob,CSMom74,5,Sat Feb 14 21:06:55 2015 UTC,"SOA is seven seasons.   On some shows, when you re-watch, things you didn't notice or catch on to the first time make sense.   Like Game of Thrones for me.  I also re-watched Sons.  There may have been the fact that I was half zombified with no sleep with a newborn the first time, but when I re-watched, it was even better.  Especially Thrones because there are so many details.    For me, this is only true of ongoing shows that follow a story.  Not shows like Law and Order or something, where each show is a complete thing of its own."
Sonsofanarchy,2vu6ob,Horse625,3,Sat Feb 14 07:53:03 2015 UTC,"You sound like my mom.  She's somehow constantly surprised by the fact that I'll watch the same movies and TV shows over and over, even though I know the endings.  As if the ending is the only thing that matters in a piece of fiction.  I rewatch movies and shows, this one included, because I appreciate the amount of talent involved on the part of the actors, writers, and directors.  Knowing the ending does nothing to damage my perception of something.  In many cases, it actually allows me to see things that I may have missed the first time around."

Dont get me wrong I am buying every single thing up because I am a die hard fan but we could have gotten some of these stories in the actual show, hell other shows have lost their lead and if Hunnam wanted out they could have done an entire 8th season using the stories from these books and stuff and delved deeper into the history of the other characters more"

Sonsofanarchy,2vhf02,viktorlogi,2,Thu Feb 12 17:05:43 2015 UTC,"Well, not so much when they insist on struggling"
Sonsofanarchy,2vhf02,hutchero,7,Thu Feb 12 17:22:10 2015 UTC,"Eh, I hated Otto at the end -- he set Tara up and ultimately he's partially responsible for her death. She could have escaped Charming a lot sooner (and faster) had she not had the trial looming over her head. She shouldn't have ever agreed to go see him but he had the whole thing planned out - killing the nurse, framing Tara and destroying Jax."
Sonsofanarchy,2vhf02,CreepyAbelTeller,3,Wed Feb 11 17:34:20 2015 UTC,I kindof forgot about that part.  I didn't care for Tara much before she died.
Sonsofanarchy,2vhf02,CreepyAbelTeller,2,Thu Feb 12 00:07:17 2015 UTC,Why?
Sonsofanarchy,2vhf02,JaxTeller718,2,Thu Feb 12 21:18:24 2015 UTC,Tara had plenty of chances to get out and Jax told her going to see Otto was a bad idea so she dug her own grave literally
Sonsofanarchy,2vhf02,CreepyAbelTeller,1 point,Fri Feb 13 07:43:19 2015 UTC,No one is saying it isn't her fault. But it's not entirely her fault. Her intent in seeing Otto was noble - she was trying to help Jax so RICO could be squashed and they could leave as a family. Otto setting her up ruined her last attempt in trying to get out (she had accepted the job and was ready to leave by the end of Season 5 which wasn't that long from the end of Season 4 in SOA time).

Sonsofanarchy,2vhucg,besyuziki,5,Thu Feb 12 01:55:21 2015 UTC,There is no official explanation for the homeless lady. She is mostly left up to interpretation by the fans. The common theory is that she is supposed to represent a reaper or death.
Sonsofanarchy,2vhucg,Wangis,2,Wed Feb 11 11:15:46 2015 UTC,"I always got a very religious vibe from her - her part in Papa's Goods just sort of cemented it. I remember talking about how she was present for the ""sacraments"" in Jax's life. Like, when she points him to the cool water in the graveyard at Donna's funeral (I think... it's been a while since I rewatched), I thought that was symbolic of baptism (baptism = new beginnings, and that moment was a turning point for Jax). Then in Papa's Goods, she has the bread and wine, so she's symbolic of communion.  I felt like she was meant to really drive home the parallel between Jax and Jesus - like, Jesus began spreading the word and whatnot when he baptized in the river, and Jax started really being a ""messenger"" of JT's message from his manuscript. Then, the whole bread and wine... Jesus' death, Jax's ""sacrifice"" of his own life for the club."
Sonsofanarchy,2vhucg,vickyconlu,0,Fri Feb 13 02:43:17 2015 UTC,Some of us believe that Kurt said it because he was fed up with the homeless lady questions.

Stahl, that uppity bitch, was right about one thing: Tattoos and Chivalry is a delicious combination."
Sonsofanarchy,2vhjuj,CreepyAbelTeller,3,Wed Feb 11 02:28:47 2015 UTC,One thing Stahl got right. I do love when clay and gemma get to show how they feel about each other. They had great chemistry. Too bad they're so fucked up.

They talked and communicated, had a healthy sex life well into their 50s, knew how to fight and make up, had each others backs. They were confidantes, lovers and friends. Then Clay made that god-damned phone call..."

My best attempt at taking up for it was they had to wait for Tara, and even once she got there and needed better tools to get the bullet out she could have already done enough to get him stable to where it wasn't really a huge life or death situation anymore.  A bigger question for me is what did the club do before Tara came back into town?  I know Chibs did some stuff but it seemed he was really only able to handle basic stitches, so did everyone pretty much just die before and after Tara?"

Sonsofanarchy,2vb2xz,alchemy_index,6,Mon Feb 9 15:39:07 2015 UTC,"Ahh ouch man that totally blows. I have not had anything ruined per se but I know during season 7 I would Google SoA episode titles looking for a picture to put up in the Discussion Thread fully knowing what I was potentially in for and it would pop up spoilers from previous seasons. I would see those and think motherfucker you are a scumbag Google.  Something when being a MOD on reddit for any TV sub you just have to accept. Only thing I guess that kind of got ruined, but also kinda did not as I blame a lot of it on Sutter and that he did this purposely; main characters did interviews in the early episodes of season 7 and spilled what episodes they would be through up to the penultimate. In other words ""Character A"" would say that they just started filming ""X"" number episode in season 7 and that was a dead giveaway you knew that they were in the series through that episode. That was really shitty IMO that Sutter didn't put a gag order on them for that kind of thing like Vince did on BB and other series. I don't know if he was in a panic to a point that he would not get the viewership he was hoping for or what the deal was, but you could hardly search for SoA without a headline popping up about an actor giving an interview about their roles in future season 7 episodes.    BTW for what its worth, the moderators here in the Clubhouse after the series ended had a solid debate on whether or not we should remove the rule on spoiler tags. We immediately removed the rule to require them for Seasons 1-5 and then announced Season 6 spoiler tags would not be required after the New Years holiday. In the end it came down to removing the rule after the New Year so people could binge watch through the holidays and New Years, and since we had over 1.1million page hits over the finale it was determined people need to catch up or its on them. So now we only require Season 7 to be spoiler tagged and likely will through the year, especially considering it has not hit Netflix yet.  Enjoy your day!  a."
Sonsofanarchy,2vb2xz,Mayhem5100,3,Mon Feb 9 18:24:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah it must take a lot of dedication on your end to be a mod of a TV sub that still wasn't finished. Thanks for taking one for the team.   If I post in a TV show sub, I'll usually put a spoiler tag in because I know a lot of people start watching WAY late. I started watching SOA a few weeks ago and binged through the whole thing, finished it yesterday.   Also yeah, I try to avoid any interviews/sneak peeks to be honest. I think it was Breaking Bad/Walking Dead where after each episode they'd be like ""Next week on the Walking Dead..."" and then they show some of the exciting stuff from the next episode. I always turned off the TV at that point because when I watch an episode I like to not know anything about what's going to happen. If I watch the sneak peeks and then the episode the following week, I'll just be like ""so, when does ______ happen? Must be really soon because it was shown in the sneak peek"". But I guess those are good because for most people it builds excitement for the next episode, I'm probably just weird!"

I think it was a smart move by Ryan (and his agent) to distance him from Opie as much as possible in his next role to avoid typecasting, but unfortunately the show wasn't successful and it was discontinued after its first season."

She didn't show it as much on Mad Men, so I do think it was part of her character.   I never found Wendy charming. Even when she cleaned up, she looked like a junkie. Surprised more people don't mention how she constantly looked like she was sucking on a lemon."

Sonsofanarchy,2v48gu,JasonBored,22,Mon Feb 9 19:37:45 2015 UTC,"I didn't mind  her at first, but I wasn't a fan of hers near the end.  I mean part of me gets why she wanted out because of her kids, but she knew what she was getting into.  Some will say that Jax told her along the way he was getting out, but she had to know that wasn't a guarantee, and Jax himself tried several times to get her to leave early on by pointing out she was a doctor and didn't need to get dragged into his life.  He even went as far as trying to scare her away in season 3, and had even told her to leave with the kids in season 4 AFTER he told her that he wouldn't be leaving anytime soon since he was taking over as president and the club needed him, and it was her that decided not to leave and told him she wasn't going anywhere.    Jax even told her she should stop visiting Otto, and if I recall correctly she didn't exactly fill him in on the details going on with that, and while yes she ended up in that situation because of the club, she did make the decision to do everything with Otto on her own.    Then, after all the early warnings by Jax to not get involved with him to begin with, and telling her to leave with the kids she up and decides to work up deals with her lawyer and Wendy behind his back including lying to him about being pregnant and lying about his mother causing her to lose the baby.  I would have felt more bad for her without all the early chances to leave from Jax, and without her getting so dirty in the end."
Sonsofanarchy,2v48gu,billy8383,5,Sat Feb 7 22:25:12 2015 UTC,"This exactly! My dad liked Tara and kept asking me why I didn't like her. One of my biggest reasons was she 100% knew what she was getting into. Some times, people change. But you cannot bank on that. She kept wanting Jax to change his entire being for her. You can't ask someone to do that. They have to be willing."
Sonsofanarchy,2v48gu,thebooknerdkid,2,Sun Feb 8 02:03:28 2015 UTC,"To be fair, Jax wanted out fire most of the series as well - he just couldn't find a way to quit the life."
Sonsofanarchy,2v48gu,DarkhorseV,1 point,Sun Feb 8 13:46:26 2015 UTC,"What about all the times that Jax said he WANTED to change? Or all the promises he made to her about getting out? It's not like Tara was hearing strange voices. It's a two-way street. She wanted to help him and the club with RICO because a) she was the only person who could get to Otto and b) so RICO could be crushed and they could get out as planned. Yes, these situations do not exist in a vacuum and she obviously paid the price for getting dirty with a bunch of criminals (i.e. forging a note, giving Otto the cross, etc). BUT to say that she knew what she was getting into is kind of ridiculous. No one could have seen things play out the way they did. She never expected Jax to shoot up Wendy - which was ultimately the catalyst for wanting to GTFO of Charming.   Jax had this big idea to pull himself and his family out of the violence. She finally realized that he wasn't the same guy anymore (the club had eventually hardened him) and there is a huge generational aspect to the violence. Unfortunately, that isn't something that was realized within 2 weeks of being back together because a) he was saying and doing everything to prove that he was taking the club in the right direction for a while and b) she loved him."
Sonsofanarchy,2v48gu,CreepyAbelTeller,0,Mon Feb 9 20:42:57 2015 UTC,"I get your overall point, but can't totally agree.  It's not as if the club was ever a group of guys within the law.  Tara knew what the club was, even if things eventually got worse it doesn't change that they were always under watch by the police and ATF.  Up to the season 4 finale Jax had told her she could leave with the kids, and she decided to stay.    Just how many people had Jax and the club killed during the first 4 seasons?  Jax had even already spent more than a year in jail during that time, and would have spent more time in jail but he was part of a plan to kill Jimmy, and an ATF agent which it appears Tara knew about.  Stahl may have been a bitch, but she was an agent trying to do her job, and really didn't break any actual laws other than killing her partner which I doubt Tara even knew about.  Jax may not have killed her directly, but he was obviously part of the plan, and Tara didn't seem to mind that at all.    Also during the first 4 seasons Tara herself had helped Gemma kill and dispose of an innocent woman, had been kidnapped due to club activities which led to her having to kill a woman, and had seen a club member killed in front of her while her soon to be stepson was kidnapped and taken to another country, yet she accepted all of that and still refused Jax's offer to leave, and even decided to marry him in season 5 where he again went to jail, and she again didn't decide to leave.    She was ok with breaking multiple laws herself, ok with everything the club did, and it was only when she herself got into trouble that she wanted out.  Yes, her helping the club was the cause of her getting into trouble, and yes getting the kids out of that life was best for them, but she made all those decisions herself, and only decided to take the steps to get out when it became about saving herself, and was even willing to make the entire SOA pay for it with RICO in order to do so even though once again, she made the choice to get into that life and stay with it.    To further back my point of her doing it for herself I'll add this.  Prior to her going on the run with the kids towards the end of season 6 she witnesses the club take out Clay, and over hears Jax telling Nero that this was the final piece of getting out of guns, and everything would be legit going forward.  From all Tara knows at that point there is no reason to doubt that, and you could argue that would have actually been true had Jax not gone on a revenge for Tara streak in season 7.  Yet, this doesn't stop Tara from going ahead and agreeing to make the deal.    What happened with Otto may have been because of the club in most ways, but nobody from the club told her to take the cross to Otto, and that nurse didn't die because of gun running, she died because of Otto having the ability to do so from getting the cross from Tara, and if I remember correctly from having his hand freed by Tara.  It may not have been completely fair to her, but she made her choices, and mistakes and decided to bail herself out by throwing every SOA charter under the bus."

It was the final proof she needed to realize that he had turned into a monster. I don't think she was ever on board with what he did. All of Season 5 with her getting to Otto was meant to kill RICO so that her entire family could get out of Charming. I don't think it confused him so much as it angered him that his wife would challenge him. She had set up the guardianship and accepted the job in Oregon at the end of Season 5 - and I think to Jax that was like some huge betrayal because Tara was actually taking action as opposed to just saying ""let's get out."" In a way, her becoming a more formidable partner/Old Lady probably spooked the shit out of him."

Sonsofanarchy,2v48gu,Nyxia,1 point,Sat Feb 7 21:05:10 2015 UTC,"The difference is that Tara doesn't want her kids  to live toxic, criminal lives. Gemma wants the opposite.  Tara and Gemma couldn't be more different."
Sonsofanarchy,2v48gu,ThouArtNaught,2,Sun Feb 8 06:08:27 2015 UTC,"Well, they both did fucked up shit and ultimately failed at protecting their families so I'd have to disagree with you. Tara was fully aware of what she was getting herself into, it's not like Jax knocked her up and then was like oh by the way babe I'm actually a gangster so you gotta deal with the club life, she knew full well what came with the life. She just stayed hoping she could change him."
Sonsofanarchy,2v48gu,Nyxia,1 point,Sun Feb 8 06:35:00 2015 UTC,"Jax promised Tara he would leave the club. When he failed to deliver, she took matters into her own hands. All she tried to do was leave with her kids. The fact that she was forced to stay was not her fault.   And what fucked up shit are you talking about that Tara did? I remember all the shit Gemma did but from what I recall Tara only did things a good mother would do. I'm not saying she was perfect but she was no where as fucked up to be even remotely comparable to Gemma."
Sonsofanarchy,2v48gu,ThouArtNaught,3,Sun Feb 8 06:59:52 2015 UTC,"Smoking weed and ignoring her kids crying, faking a pregnancy and a miscarriage, going behind Jax's back to make a deal with Wendy, the whole deal with Otto... if she really didn't wanna be involved, she could have left one of the many times Jax told her to get out. But she never did."
Sonsofanarchy,2v48gu,Nyxia,1 point,Sun Feb 8 07:30:36 2015 UTC,"She could have left - but ultimately, was Jax really ever willing to let her go? In a ""heart wants what the heart wants"" kind of way. He basically told her how miserable and lonely he was in the 10+ years that she was gone. They clearly loved each other and weren't ever going to move on from one another. Yes, she would probably be alive had she left but I think - at the time - leaving him was just heartbreaking for the both of them."
Sonsofanarchy,2v48gu,CreepyAbelTeller,2,Mon Feb 9 18:14:28 2015 UTC,"I think he was, I don't think that he for a second wanted the kids to grow up the way he did and he realized that he had to let her and the boys go - but I believe he honestly thought he could get the club out of the criminal activities for the most part when he told Tara he'd go with them. I think he underestimated how difficult it would be to actually accomplish that. I dunno, I think I would agree with your point more if to me personally it didn't feel like Jax and Tara had no chemistry whatsoever. But it is what it is.  Also, your username is great."
Sonsofanarchy,2v48gu,Nyxia,1 point,Mon Feb 9 18:46:44 2015 UTC,"Ha thanks! Creepy Abel was quite creepy all season, so he lived up to the name.  Yeah - I can see why it's harder to accept if you don't think they had chemistry. I thought they did and I loved how Jax was much more aggressive in his pursuit of Tara and Tara was much more reserved. There's a scene in Season 5 when they're kissing and she comes on strong and he's genuinely surprised. He reacts by laying a big one on her. I think it describes their relationship perfectly. He was always way more sexually aggressive than she was.   And I think he would have been willing to let her go - temporarily - if he really thought he would be leaving the club too and joining his family in Oregon. Ultimately, they both knew that wasn't going to happen."
Sonsofanarchy,2v48gu,CreepyAbelTeller,3,Mon Feb 9 19:01:55 2015 UTC,"Liked her towards the end, and when she  was like "" fuck this in behind you 100 percent"" and stood behind jax when he was at the table"
Sonsofanarchy,2v48gu,MisterxRager,2,Sun Feb 8 00:21:44 2015 UTC,"I agree, I liked where it was going when she accepted her place in the club and started putting gemma in her place...then it seems like Kurt Sutter forgot he wrote that and just went back to writing her as whiny and wanting to get out. I couldn't stand her after that."
Sonsofanarchy,2v48gu,intrepidse17,3,Sun Feb 8 12:36:23 2015 UTC,"I always liked the idea of Tara, someone who was not like any other character on the show, someone with a ""normal"" life and not a criminal that balanced Jax out. However, I think the casting wasn't great, there was never a whole lot of chemistry between Jax and Tara."
Sonsofanarchy,2v48gu,Wisco_disco,9,Sun Feb 8 05:24:39 2015 UTC,I hated her too. Don't worry.
Sonsofanarchy,2v48gu,bazwalt,11,Sat Feb 7 22:48:35 2015 UTC,"No, I never liked her. Just found her to be rather annoying."
Sonsofanarchy,2v48gu,Hunter-Hyena,2,Sat Feb 7 20:09:28 2015 UTC,Couldn't stand Tara..
Sonsofanarchy,2v48gu,ontgy,2,Sun Feb 8 05:52:21 2015 UTC,I didn't so much in the beginning.   Her last two seasons when she started lying and causing problems I lost my likeness for her.
Sonsofanarchy,2v48gu,BigMike0228,2,Sun Feb 8 02:18:07 2015 UTC,"I liked her. I get that she knew what she was getting into, so people think that she had no right to try and bail with the kids etc. But I think she wanted to try to embrace Jax's lifestyle/the club because she really loved him, and trusted him to protect her and their kids when it came down to it, even if he himself didn't think he could. But she only wanted out for the kids when it became too much and she finally realised what Jax was trying to get across in the earlier seasons, that safety wasn't an option so long as her and the kids were associated with the club. I think I'd dislike her more if it wasn't shown earlier on just how much she loved Jax, which made it more evident how hard the situation became for her. I also think she's the most immediate representation of the everyman/the most humane, realistic character."
Sonsofanarchy,2v48gu,monsieurjerreh,2,Sun Feb 8 04:26:59 2015 UTC,"You are not the only one who hated Tara. She was an uppity, self-righteous bitch. My sister loathes Tara and she hasn't even seen the whole show yet, she has hated her since early on in Season 1."
Sonsofanarchy,2v48gu,gizmatic,2,Sun Feb 8 17:17:09 2015 UTC,"Team Tara here.   I wasn't as big of a fan until Season 3. And then I just got her. I feel like she had a lot of issues - selfish, manipulative in her own right, and dishonest in moments that felt very out of character. BUT, she also was the only person to see Jax for who he was apart from the club. She wanted him to be a better person - not just for the sake of their children but for his own happiness. She loved him purely. And THAT is the biggest difference between Gemma and Tara. Gemma has never loved anyone or anything purely. Not even her own grandsons. What kind of wackjob actually thinks it's in their grandchild's best interest to continue the legacy of SAMCRO - a club that has killed SO MANY sons. Giving Abel that ring solidified my theory that Gemma - as much as she tried - forgot how to love purely a long time ago. Tara, on the other hand, loved Jax and her sons in a way that Gemma couldn't possibly understand.  Jax and Tara had a lot of issues - their lack of communication irritated me to no end - but I rode the ""they loved each other deeply"" train to the very end. They sold it for me. I like that Jax was sexually aggressive and Tara was much more reserved. They were the yin to the others yang. It worked.  Sutter summed it up well -- at her core Tara was just a ""badass, angry teenager."" She may have left that world for a while but she did grow up in Charming. I liked that she retained a bit of that angsty teenager behavior. It made her real to me. She was a doctor by day but still a very conflicted individual by night.  Also, Maggie Siff is a national treasure. I loved her on Mad Men and I loved her on SOA. She's a wonderful actress.  I'm curious - did you hate Jax?"
Sonsofanarchy,2v48gu,CreepyAbelTeller,2,Mon Feb 9 17:17:12 2015 UTC,Jax and Tara were both the bomb. You summed it up perfectly bro
Sonsofanarchy,2v48gu,DrGarebearPHD,2,Tue Feb 10 02:01:28 2015 UTC,I think Maggie Siff is an excellent actress as well
Sonsofanarchy,2v48gu,mswarmboobs,1 point,Mon Feb 16 05:25:33 2015 UTC,I did not agree with him at times. But I do like JAX. Why?
Sonsofanarchy,2v48gu,CreepyAbelTeller,1 point,Mon Feb 9 17:56:59 2015 UTC,"A lot of Tara's problems had something to do with Jax and/or their relationship. They were both accountable for their relationship issues. Just curious if you ever saw Jax as the problem or at least sharing half of the blame. Lots of people tend to blame Tara for everything - and I'm not saying you are - but it's interesting to note those who defend Jax and yet hold Tara accountable for all ""her"" problems when they aren't entirely just hers.   These two were good at impulse but never good at planning for the long road -- i.e. what marriage is all about."
Sonsofanarchy,2v48gu,CreepyAbelTeller,1 point,Mon Feb 9 18:03:47 2015 UTC,"I agree. The thing that most people don't understand is, in MCs the club is always first. Especially when he was in before he got married. And Jax was trying to do the right thing for her, while also putting the club first which is a hard thing."
Sonsofanarchy,2v48gu,alaughinmoose,2,Mon Feb 9 18:13:27 2015 UTC,"Right. Jax was all about eating his cake and having it too. I think he summed it up best in the final episode (while talking to his ""dad""): a good outlaw and good father can't exist inside the same man (or something to that effect)."
Sonsofanarchy,2v48gu,Redstaining,4,Mon Feb 9 20:46:50 2015 UTC,Yeah but her ass though..
Sonsofanarchy,2v48gu,WWJaxD1973,2,Sun Feb 8 04:02:26 2015 UTC,you are probably not the only one but I didn't like her (for the shit she pulled in S6)
Sonsofanarchy,2v48gu,CreepyAbelTeller,2,Sat Feb 7 20:34:15 2015 UTC,Tara was my favorite character for the entire show. I guess I saw her play the role in a different light than most.
Sonsofanarchy,2v48gu,Vivalaredsox,2,Sun Feb 8 02:42:37 2015 UTC,My wife would get mad at me through the entire series whenever I would say that Wendy was more Jax's type than Tara and there was no way in hell that they would last. And when Wendy got clean and I said she was better looking and I hoped they would get back together I ended up on the couch the rest of the week lol!
Sonsofanarchy,2v48gu,Crash_Revenge,1 point,Sun Feb 8 15:14:07 2015 UTC,"Wendy cleaned up but still looked incredibly ""hard."" It was spot on casting for a junkie but I always found Wendy's face to be borderline ugly. It was like her features had melted together...  Tara was very beautiful - hated the haircut in Season 6 (wtf was she thinking?) but there's no competition when it comes to who was better looking. If Jax wanted to be with someone who looked significantly older than him (and haggard), Wendy is his gal. He looked good with Tara - she wasn't a supermodel but she was very pretty with the most striking eyes this side of television."
Sonsofanarchy,2v48gu,Picturemelolling,3,Mon Feb 9 17:24:03 2015 UTC,I wouldn't necessarily say I hated her but she was annoying at times.
Sonsofanarchy,2v48gu,MadamGunner,3,Sat Feb 7 20:22:59 2015 UTC,I didn't mind her to begin with but near the end I was praying for her to be spolier with a kitchen implement. Maybe prayer does work. 😃

Sonsofanarchy,2v48gu,TerramuggusHolmes,1 point,Sun Feb 8 21:32:19 2015 UTC,A different actress in the role would have been better.  I liked the character a lot.  She had her crazy moments toward her end and I was getting sick of her.  Jax's reaction though when he found her did me in though.  I missed her.
Sonsofanarchy,2v48gu,CreepyAbelTeller,1 point,Sun Feb 8 21:50:28 2015 UTC,I thought Tara was awsome. She stood up to Gemma and unlike Gemma did what was ACTUALLY good for her children.

Some characters are good characters that do good things, some are bad that do bad things. Just watch the show.  Edit: For anyone that's about to say ""it's because she didn't do enough for her kids!"" ... This is a show that glorifies gangsters who kill people for a living."

Also, I don't think your disclaimer is necessary in this sub :P nobody's gonna fault you for relating to or empathizing with the characters!"
Sonsofanarchy,2v3c03,yoinker272,9,Sat Feb 7 15:29:00 2015 UTC,In case you didn't know Otto's character is played by Kurt Sutter who writes the show. He also dates Katy Segal in real life.
Sonsofanarchy,2v3c03,Sykotik,3,Sat Feb 7 19:07:39 2015 UTC,"He was probably my favorite character. He really exemplified how awful the life was and the prices you pay for he brotherhood. Not to mention he was basically a beautiful story of tragedy and closure for a club member. Acted incredibly by the shows creator himself. Otto was just an outstanding inclusion for the show. It makes you think--if Jax went away for Tara, was he doomed to become Otto?"
Sonsofanarchy,2v3c03,7V3N,1 point,Sat Feb 7 20:47:31 2015 UTC,"Actually I dont think so. TBH Otto was more of an ""old school"" badass in the same vein as Clay or JT. Jax was a different animal.. Jax Teller was more of a product of that era but weened on being borderline spoiled by his elders. Don't get me wrong - Jax is my favorite character on the show. But there's no way he'd have ended up like Otto.. just silently doing his time and getting destroyed. He was too hotheaded and temperamental - he'd have ended up dead in a death match or prison escape, or by some stroke of luck maneuver his way out of incarceration. Jax is more cunning then Otto - and he would have played anyone in an authority figure to get him OUT and then double cross them (as he did to every adversary he had) - or he wouldn't have silently just allowed to be raped and bullied around. He'd have attacked some AB leader or cop or just gone afoul of the wrong people and would have gotten shanked to death (as he almost did). Otto was a badass, but in a different, more low key way. Jackie Boy was always destined to go out in a fiery, ""fuck it, I got this"" kinda way."
Sonsofanarchy,2v3c03,JasonBored,3,Mon Feb 9 19:31:56 2015 UTC,"Man I hated Clay but when he put the shank in his hand and said ""No more, brother."" I felt the biggest relief. I just wanted Otto's suffering to end."
Sonsofanarchy,2v3c03,FinalTy,1 point,Mon Feb 9 04:05:26 2015 UTC,"That and you could feel the relief in Otto when Clay told him he was sorry which I took as Clay not only saying he was sorry for his situation, but for the way they handled his wife, for their favors leading to him staying in prison to end up in that situation.  You could just feel that relief of having just wanted to hear those words, and that one of his brothers still accepted him as a brother even after the RICO thing.  Maybe I read too much into that scene, but that's the way I saw it."

Sonsofanarchy,2v3c03,JasonBored,2,Mon Feb 9 19:26:49 2015 UTC,"I've been rewatching the show and currently on season 6 just now. Couldn't agree more. Otto was a character I wanted to know more about and how he was before he went to jail. Otto went out the way he was supposed to. Some of his scenes were some of my favourite moments from the show such as smashing Stahl's face off the table, so satisfying and as you mentioned the tongue scene. Holy crap, it takes a lot to make me squeamish but that done the trick. There were times though where he was a character that you did feel sorry for."
Sonsofanarchy,2v3c03,dancingingotham,2,Sat Feb 7 22:18:51 2015 UTC,Yeah Otto went out like a badass !

Sonsofanarchy,2v3jkt,xtremeschemes,5,Sat Feb 7 20:52:54 2015 UTC,It's funny because I had that exact thought too. It sort of settles down and finds its own way a few episodes in. Such a fun show though.
Sonsofanarchy,2v3jkt,ZomNoms,10,Sat Feb 7 20:54:23 2015 UTC,"I read that Ron Pearlman not being satisfied with his character towards the end wasn't because he was sidelined, but because of the direction they went with him. I thought he said in his AMA that initially he had a connection with Clay, he understood him and the things he did, but he became so twisted and vile by the end he just didn't enjoy being the character any more."
Sonsofanarchy,2v3jkt,besyuziki,8,Sat Feb 7 16:35:39 2015 UTC,"Apparently it was also very frustrating for him to shoot his scenes in a cell, isolated, away from his co-stars he worked together for years. Their brief reunion in his last episode must have been very emotional.  Happy cake day."
Sonsofanarchy,2v3jkt,besyuziki,2,Sat Feb 7 19:29:12 2015 UTC,didn't like that either Clays death was pointless why did sutter keep him alive if he didn't want to use him in the last season? (should have died in s4 or s5)
Sonsofanarchy,2v3jkt,besyuziki,12,Sat Feb 7 20:32:06 2015 UTC,Because having Ron Perlman in your cast is great PR.
Sonsofanarchy,2v3jkt,HE1SENZERG,5,Sat Feb 7 21:07:54 2015 UTC,"In Kurt's original vision, Half Sack was supposed to eventually become a full patch after his prospecting period, but the character was written off early (some say the actor was let go, some say he wanted out) and as you know Sack is honored posthumously in the S3 premiere.  Then Miles and Filthy Phil became full patch off screen, and in S6, Kurt finally realized his original idea to give a prospect his top rocker on screen with Ratboy."

I was so bummed when he went out because I think Hale was becoming to Jax what Unser was to Clay only smarter and stronger. Hale/Jax had some great backstory and chemistry that we probably would have gotten to see play out.
Sonsofanarchy,2v3jkt,Mayhem5100,3,Sat Feb 7 22:33:35 2015 UTC,"THIS. I always wanted to see/hear more about Hale/Tara's backstory. It was clear in Season 1 that Hale had a thing for Tara. He was protective of her beyond his badge and even Stahl asked him if he had a ""stiffy for Ms. Tara."" It would have been nice for Tara to have some competition in the male department because we rarely ever got to see a jealous Jax. Tara is a total catch - she should have had Jax riled up from time to time."
Sonsofanarchy,2v3jkt,7V3N,10,Mon Feb 9 21:15:58 2015 UTC,Hale wanted out so they killed him off in season 3 premiere. Halfsack also wanted out so they killed him in season 2 finale. Toric also wanted out cuz he wanted to work on some kinda other show so they also killed him off in ''Wolfsangel'' . I'm sure there are more that i'm missing.
Sonsofanarchy,2v3jkt,FrankReynolds,3,Sat Feb 7 16:29:00 2015 UTC,"Halfsack didn't want out. His psychological issues were making him a trouble to work with and they wanted him out.

I will tell you that I've been having conversations with Johnny Lewis all season, and Johnny wasn't happy on the show. Creatively, he really wanted out of his contract.

I caught a couple of her deleted scenes on the DVD. She basically served as a religious mentor to Gemma when she was going through the post-rape crisis. I liked her but Sutter said that ultimately the character didn't land. Hilarious considering he thought Jarry landed in Season 7.   Also, I'm pretty sure Tara was always going to die at the end of Season 6. Sutter has said that he wanted the final season of the show to be Jax completely unchained and without his true north. For that to happen, Tara had to go bye bye."

I mean Chibs supposedly visits them every few months after Season 3. Yet, they have all this shit going down with the IRA in later seasons and we never hear/see from Fiona again.

Sonsofanarchy,2v2akl,billy8383,12,Sat Feb 7 19:46:18 2015 UTC,"The biggest issues I had with the show were all seemingly due to characters having outlived their usefulness, then being killed in overextended and largely unfulfilling ways.  There's no weight to Clay's or Juice's deaths because everybody knows they're coming for the 7-8 episodes that precede it.  Hale is set up to the next sheriff, then he's killed before it comes to pass -- but for what?  What does killing Hale accomplish in terms of furthering the story?  It's just not great writing.  Deaths on a show like this needed to be sudden, impactful, and meaningful.  Opie's death on the show isn't foreshadowed, but it's a sacrifice -- and the events that lead up to it, and immediately following it, MEAN something.  It's a catalyst.  Many of the deaths in this show had no weight whatsoever.  Also, the entire last part of the final season as they try to track down ""the rat"" seemed like a complete MacGuffin, and pinning it all on Baroski at the end was the laziest writing in the world.  There's zero foreshadowing to suggest that Baroski was involved in it, and there's little motivation for him to do so.  If anything, the prevailing sentiment is that Jarry was likely involved in it - maybe even stealing intel from Chibs during their liaisons - but nothing ever comes to fruition, and all the time the viewer spends on this angle has ZERO payoff.  It's a lot more interesting if the viewer thinks that Chibs is trying to find something meaningful for himself outside the club by getting involved with her, then BANG reveal that Jarry is using Chibs to work a longer con by turning the gangs against one another.  There's a lesson there -- there IS nothing and no one that any of the club members can love or truly trust EXCEPT the club.  It's a dark sentiment that fits with the overall writing of the show.  But instead, we get a tacked-on bunch of bullshit implicating Baroski, and Jarry is never seen again."
Sonsofanarchy,2v2akl,Chastain86,7,Sat Feb 7 06:15:32 2015 UTC,Hale's actor wanted off the show. Which is how Unser got a bigger role than Kurt originally planned for.
Sonsofanarchy,2v2akl,billy8383,1 point,Sat Feb 7 12:44:33 2015 UTC,"Hale's actor wanted off the show, and if you think about it then it did actually further the story.  The town started to lose trust in the club, and Hale's death was something that largely led to the County Sherriff's being brought into the town to run things.    The whole hting with Baroski was hinted at when Lin came into his bakery in season 7 during the scene where Lin threatened Nero's kid. It's possible during all this that Baroski was either bought off by the Chinese or threatened to give up information on the club."
Sonsofanarchy,2v2akl,shcwaig,1 point,Sat Feb 7 22:01:11 2015 UTC,"But that's just the thing -- the Lin/Baroski scene was a complete throwaway, and it carries no weight.  It's never eluded to again, and the viewer doesn't have any opportunity to work it out on their own.  There's no motive for Baroski to do this.  We already know that Baroski's out for himself.  When it's revealed he's the rat -- which the crew has been dealing with for 6-7 episodes -- there's not much emotional resonance.  Not like there would be in revealing that Jarry's been doing it.  THAT sets up a scenario where Chibs is forced to choose between her and the club.  It adds a layer of depth to the proceedings that wasn't present in a single ""Baroski did it / Jax shoots him"" sequence.  Anyway, I'm not arguing that this ISN'T one of the greatest scripted dramas ever made.  The question was ""what would you change?"" and these elements are what I'd change.  The mileage of others may -- and probably does -- vary.  But I wanted to make sure you knew that even though I disagree with you, I still appreciate the way you constructed your thoughts, brother."
Sonsofanarchy,2v2akl,shcwaig,1 point,Sun Feb 8 18:04:14 2015 UTC,"Don't' get me wrong, I agree that the final season lacked very good plot in terms of an interesting bad guy.  I still enjoyed season 7 for what it was, but it doesn't stack up with the other seasons IMO because they didn't draw my emotions into wanting to see them take out the bad guys/their enemies.  I think Baroski being the rat was likely within his character, but you're right in that they did write it up in a pretty lazy way.  As a fan you've pretty much forgotten about Baroski and Marks by the time Jax takes them down.   So I do agree with you, I was just saying that they did sort of show on screen how it may have gotten put into motion.  They should have kept Clay and/or the Gaylan around till the end for a more satisfying final conflict."

Sonsofanarchy,2v2akl,billy8383,3,Sat Feb 7 11:22:31 2015 UTC,"Exactly. He didn't want his kids to have any kind of positive feelings towards him or the club.

Sonsofanarchy,2v2akl,m-torr,1 point,Sun Feb 8 22:56:43 2015 UTC,"I think they brought out JT's book too early. Like from the moment you meet the character of Jax Teller he is just a product of his father's writings. He almost never comes out as his own self thinking man, but is instead is just following way too much in his father's footsteps. And when Piney gives Jax the copy at Donna's funeral and says ""it's time for a change""  it  has absolutely no impact because that's what Jax had been pushing for all season already. It just shows that Piney is on his side.   I would've liked to have Jax want to get out of guns because of the trouble it causes the club and go through everything and THEN get the book from Piney. At least we could've seen Jax with an original idea.   That just bugged me."
Sonsofanarchy,2v2akl,Dougdahead,2,Sat Feb 7 14:56:04 2015 UTC,"The the whole ""Jax takes out the bad guys"" towards the end of the last episode, it was extremely rushed. They really could have gotten an entire extended episode out of the few minutes that was spent on the vigilante scene. Also, the ending, but that's been talked about to death."
Sonsofanarchy,2v2akl,billy8383,2,Sat Feb 7 15:20:35 2015 UTC,"The story over the last 1-2 seasons would have been different.  The end game should have involved Clay IMO, and watching season 6 over again the story with the Irish should have been the main villain story along with Clay through the end.  They could of had the Irish be behind killing Tara to get the same result there if they wanted, and later had Jax find out about Gemma being involved with JT's death if they still wanted to explore Jax taking her out.    I would have gone with the same story up till the part where the Irish turn on the club and want Clay out of prison to work with them.  I would of had the Irish get Clay out on their own, and have him start up his own club as he had talked about.  I would of had some destruction by Jax lead to a couple of members like Tig and Juice joining up with Clay to play up the two clubs going up against each other.  Near the end of the final season I'd have it revealed that Clay had put the club together and recruited Tig and Juice to help him take out the Irish from the inside in order to protect SAMCRO, and somewhere along the way Jax finds out about Gemma and sees that she is just as, if not more responsible for JT than Clay was.  Clay however at some point sacrifices himself and is killed by the Irish during a final stand that ends the conflict with them.  During a final conversation Clay makes it clear to Jax that he's(Clay that is) still not innocent of a lot of awful sins such as his part in JT, Donna, and Piney, but he couldn't go out before making it right for the club, and he realizes JT was right and Jax needs to keep things right by making the club what JT wanted it to be.    Many may not agree with that overall story, but one thing that left season 7 a little flat for me was the fact that there weren't any real bad guys that you cared about.  Even by the time Marks was taken down at the end it didn't seem to matter.  Gayland meeting his end in the final episode however could have felt much more satisfying for the viewers."
Sonsofanarchy,2v2akl,kitten_anus,0,Sat Feb 7 21:27:55 2015 UTC,agreed loosing Clay and Gaylan at the same time was too much  Marks and Lin were boring villians IMO

You may get us all killed' in S7 Kill Clay in S4 or S5 Trim the fat off the show, bring it down to 5 or 6 seasons SEVERELY cut back on the nepotism. If Katey wasn't Gemma, I guarantee she'd have a drastically reduced role as a character Not have Juice betray the club over the dumbest pretenses possible. Or, make some of the club members really racist against black people, so his ancestry would actually be an issue Dial the notch of sensationalism back a little bit Not have 7.5 seasons of the show be built around JT's murder, than when you're almost done throw in some bullshit 'maybe he commited suicide' plot"

The character arcs were excellent. Imo all big deaths were meaningful and captured beautifully on screen. The actors didn't even really act from S3 on, due to how close they all got from working with each other for 7+ years. You should take some time and read some interviews from the entire cast and crew. Don't be so simple minded when judging a tv show because it's a different lifestyle than what you live. Take the show for what it is and not what you want it to be."

Drove the club so far wrong of its original idea 3. And not to mention it set up Connor Malone to be lead in Irish guns. Yes it was drawn out for several episodes if not seasons but still it was a pointless death.
Sonsofanarchy,2v2akl,aztec_prime,2,Sun Feb 8 01:32:05 2015 UTC,yeah it was just too little and too late  Clay's death seemed like an afterthought   They dragged it out way too much (thats why I thought he was going to be important for the endgame) Also after Clay and Gaylan died the show lost good antagonists they should have kept Gaylan around for longer and made the IRA the main antagonists in S7 instead of black and yellow  Marks and Lin were just lame

Sonsofanarchy,2v0068,sobusyimbored,3,Fri Feb 13 00:03:30 2015 UTC,"It seems a bit too on the nose, though I guess the show was never really that concerned about that, with the House of the Rising Sun cover etc.  Personally I like it when a show finds a piece of music that fits with a scene without seeming like a super obvious choice. Like when the Sopranos used Time Zone's World Destruction, which is a kind of punk/new wave/hip hop song from the 1980s and not really something that would logically jump to mind when you were thinking about a New Jersey mob boss in the early 2000s. But it works."
Sonsofanarchy,2v0068,kitten_anus,2,Fri Feb 6 21:17:42 2015 UTC,Personally I think the song is too consistent in it's tone. I feel that the montage of Jax's life should have some fast and angry parts to it.
Sonsofanarchy,2v0068,sobusyimbored,4,Sat Feb 7 00:08:34 2015 UTC,I agree. It would made a great montage.
Sonsofanarchy,2v0068,Mayhem5100,2,Fri Feb 6 18:54:31 2015 UTC,"That would have been an awesome, and seemingly natural, choice. Maybe they had issues getting the rights to the song?"
Sonsofanarchy,2v0068,GP_Level_0100,2,Fri Feb 6 19:40:34 2015 UTC,Or Highway to Hell.  Both would be appropriate.
Sonsofanarchy,2v0068,Vivalaredsox,2,Fri Feb 6 21:03:33 2015 UTC,"I personally feel like the NIN version would have been a better choice. Imagine if they added to the prison parts and showed a montage of all the member incarcerated reflecting on their thoughts? It would have added even more character depth, and the NIN version has the better atmosphere for the show IMO."
Sonsofanarchy,2v0068,FatalBeliever,1 point,Sat Feb 7 02:37:43 2015 UTC,"It's definitely a cool idea, but I think using a well known song like that may have taken away from the scene. I loved the song used in the final scene... The crow fooled him into joining and it ruined him. In the end the crow just laughed and went along its day. It summed up the show quite well.   On another note, first time I've watched the video in a long time. Chills. Can't believe he's been gone 12 years this year already."

Even though the song is about addiction and isn't really relevant to the show it would've fit very well.  Can I say something though? What is with Kurt Sutter's obsessions with montages? To be, it got to be a joke after awhile. There are a few that are immaculate in their execution (Donna's death, Stahl's death) but damn him for taking that trope and running it into the dirt with his overuse of it."
Sonsofanarchy,2v0068,TomBonner1,3,Fri Feb 6 20:47:49 2015 UTC,"As the story expanded and the side characters got bigger roles, the montages served as a way to quickly check in with everyone either at the beginning or end of the episodes.  I feel like they did a great job of just making it part of the show, almost like a title sequence in itself, something you count on. You could tell without watching the clock that you were at the final scene of the night because the montage started. The few times in season 7 they didn't use a montage were very intentional because it left a very different tone to the end of an episode."
Sonsofanarchy,2v0068,Mel_Books,2,Fri Feb 6 22:59:30 2015 UTC,There is nothing wrong with montages. It's just his thing. Michael Bay loves explosions and Kurt Sutter LOVES montages.

Remember the conversation with Bobby and Tara when she was patching him up from that bullet wound near the end of S6? Hell throughout most of the show, they all had some kind words towards her, and they considered her to be apart of the family. And that's what most people forget, they are all FAMILY. If one family member is wronged, you gotta stick by them. Tara's death was just as bad of a blow to the club as a whole, as it was to Jax."
Sonsofanarchy,2v21ij,mschmitt1217,1 point,Mon Feb 9 08:28:10 2015 UTC,"There was a lot of crap writing in Season 7, but I don't think them following blindly was part of it. Like mentioned extensively below, Tara was part of the ""club family"" as much as Gemma was. With her murdered in such a brutal fashion and Jax having an idea (as far off as it was) of who murdered her I think this fell right into line with how I would expect they would react. It's all about the club business but at the end of the day they are very close and still outlaws. They wouldn't let the murder of the Prez's wife go easily."
Sonsofanarchy,2v21ij,CreepyAbelTeller,1 point,Mon Feb 9 16:25:11 2015 UTC,"Hunnam explained it in an interview -- he said that Bobby and Chib's desire to follow him blindly was pretty simple -- they knew how much Tara meant to Jax.

Sonsofanarchy,2v21ij,TheLastNomad,3,Wed Feb 11 18:08:22 2015 UTC,I'm with you. But Sutter wrote almost every person out of character from Season 6 onwards. Clay got it much earlier - like Season 4. I can see why Pearlman was upset. The only character who was consistent (consistently rotten that is) was Gemma.
Sonsofanarchy,2v21ij,ApocalypseToast,1 point,Wed Feb 11 19:29:07 2015 UTC,"I remember a scene in season 6 i think, where bobby tells tara explicitly that she is the only thing holding the club together.

The Sopranos was basically groundbreaking for its ensemble cast, different way they presented the protagonist (anti-hero) and also how they shied away from the procedural type crime dramas that were prevalent in that time and moved to a serialized style. Not to mention they shot the show like it was a movie which wasn't exactly the way TV programs did it.   All of that, plus plenty of other aspects I'm forgetting ushered in a new era of TV and really changed the way people watched. You don't have to like the Sopranos, but you WILL respect it lol"

Sonsofanarchy,2uvih2,gizmatic,26,Thu Feb 5 14:53:23 2015 UTC,"The timeline was always a little inconsistent, but I think the glaring errors you're pointing out stem from the kids playing Abel. Once season 4 started, they had twins cast as Abel. They couldn't plug in any baby anymore and pass it off as the same kid. This forced them to be a little more fluid with Abel's age each season.   Also starting with season 4, they pretty much stuck to the formula of 1 episode = 1 day so the timetables of each season were very short.  Between seasons 4 and 5, we never get an exact time-lapse, but I generally assumed it was around a month. Yet because the twins growing a year, they aged Abel to match the kids. Abel jumps from just over two years, to three.  Seasons 5-6 are days apart, maybe a week and a half, but again, it's been a year in real life, the twins have grown, so they call Abel 4 to compensate for their growth.  Season 6-7 are only ten days apart. But now, the kids look 5, so they call Abel 5.  I'd estimate that from season 4 to season 7 eclipses 4.5 months, being generous with some of the timetables. So Thomas would be at most a year old, and Abel should have been around 2 and a half. Instead of having 5-6 year old twins playing a 2.5 year old, they decided to be a little liberal with his timeline.  TL;DR in order to balance the passing of time in the show vs reality, they had to be flexible with some characters age (mainly Abel and to an extent Gemma.)  Edit:grammer"

It's probably because it is really hard to get a kid who's just learned to walk to do anything you want him to do. Have you tried to do anything with a 2 year old? Sort of the same reason that TV families have dogs but usually don't have cats. You can't make a cat do what you want for the scene, and you can't make a 2 year old either. You can have a bird, because it's in a cage, and you can have a baby because he's in a crib or in someone's arms."

Sonsofanarchy,2uvxed,JaxTeller718,2,Thu Feb 5 17:07:39 2015 UTC,"My 2 cents on this who thought the season ended on a PERFECT note is that you can trace the problems with the final season back to Clays premature death. I have read in different articles that Ron Perlman wanted a story that would see Clay come back and kind of be the hero of the show, or at least have redeemed himself for everything he had done. Issues between Kurt and Ron led to his early departure. Rewatching the show from the beginning it seemed the path we were on was Clay vs Jax, and I think if we take what Ron has said in interviews we may have seen a redeemed Clay torn between protecting Gemma and her secret and telling Jax the truth about Tara. So much of Season 7 saw us going back to the things the first 2 seasons were great at which was Mayans vs Lin vs Black that I think a return to the main storyline of Clay vs Jax would have made for more drama, even more so if Clay did manage to make it to Ireland to get involved with the gun running.  The final showdown between Gemma and Jax with Clay in that room would have made for some fantastic character writing and history telling, perhaps with Clay revealing it was Gemmas idea to tamper with JT's bike to put a final betrayal on her before Jax guns him down. I also think if Sutter has no intention of going back to this well he should have killed more Sons off, the true tragedy being that his actions at the beginning of the season TRULY came back to haunt him and lead to his decision in the finale.  As it stands now his decision was based solely to save his club and his sons, but why stop there? Having Jax kill the club in a bloody way realizes JT's, Father Ashby and Unsers prophecy that it would only end in blood and bodies. The end was tragic from a character standpoint for Jax, but not for anyone else really and that I think is where he failed us with how huge the impact could have been in the final two episodes.  Edit: I know this is long enough but things like changing sheriffs, taking away the small town feeling Charming had in the first 3 seasons and having NONE of the Sons actually be AGAINST the war Jax started hurt the show as well. Everyone started to question Clay when they went into drugs, but no one questioned Jax, even AFTER the tragic death and I think that hurt the show as well. Some internal beefing would have made for great drama, especially from Tig who over the years did NOT seem to be the biggest fan of Jax in the first place."

Yes, Sagal's Gemma was arguably the most badass woman on television but I give SO much credit to her performance and very little to the writing. Same goes to Siff who was given the most ridiculous arc in Season 6. In the hands of a less capable actress, Tara would have been cloying and ridiculous. Siff made it work. No credit to Sutter."

Sonsofanarchy,2uvxed,gizmatic,1 point,Fri Feb 6 05:04:55 2015 UTC,Season 7 was very good IMO. Episode 10 was my favorite episode of the series (behind the season 3 finale of course).
Sonsofanarchy,2uvxed,JaxTeller718,1 point,Fri Feb 6 05:48:30 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't have had Jax kill Jury. Jax wouldn't die and season 8 would be starting soon. Bobby would have lived, Juice earned his butt rape and death for trying to sell out samcro to the mayans. Gemma earned her death. Unser was pointless anyway so he could die too, just an old cop. Jax screwed over Marks, but fuck em . Robocop had to die too. The Irish was a fuck up but idk."
Sonsofanarchy,2uvxed,JaxTeller718,1 point,Sat Feb 7 01:57:47 2015 UTC,"I was disappointed with Season 7. I don't like to dwell on it, but yeah, Season 7 hurt.  I felt that most of whats wrong with season 6 stems from the fact that Clay was killed too soon. Without Clay around, it was painful to watch Jax almost single-handedly destroy SAMCRO in that last season. It was basically a season of waiting to see how long it would take Jax to realize that he was his own greatest enemy. However, even without a single, main protagonist in Season 7, the writing was....awfully weak mostly but sometimes it was just awful.   Its like they hired a new team of writers for season 7 who had never seen seasons 1-6. Chibs and Bobby were grossly out of character--so was Juice. Up to season 7, Juice was an idiot, but not an *idiot***. Someone deserved to walk away--openly and on good standing--from the club, from what it had become and I think that out of the members left it should have been Juice.  Season 7, when you boil it down, was basically us watching Jax destroy himself and everything around him for 13 extended episodes, while Bobby, Tig and Chibs cheered him on with uncharacteristic gusto with some Gemma-drama thrown in each episode to pad out the random and goofy B-plots they came up with just for good measure. I felt like the writing in season 7 was just really sloppy, very, very schizo.  The Chinese guy that Jax killed in retaliation, would've been someone important to the triads and his death/dissappearance would've triggered tension between SAMCRO and The Mayans and Triads, with the Irish circling around being McPricks on occasion. They added a bunch of new bodies to the show, but not new characters. They should have fleshed out those characters.  It would have been nice to see Jax struggling with wanting more vengeance and wanting SAMCRO legit, to see tension between him SAMCRO get resolved, to see SAMCRO be 100% legit and living in criminal harmony with their outlaw alliances in place only to have something from early in the series--like Kohns body--come back to bite Jax in the ass.  West, Quinn and Montez were said to have families--where were they? Why didn't those 3 members have any concern or contact or mention their families? Ratboys best scenes were with Tig, so why did we waste screen time on him and Brookes dead-end, doomed to fail fuck-mance? Sheriff Jarry and Chibs--couldn't have been more poorly written. I never did really understand the point of that black woman and her son. I didn't understand their plot at all or why Jax thought going against Marks with a crime he didn't commit was a good idea.  Plus, the ""by law"" that drove Juice to betray the club was revealed to have been unwritten. W...T...F. That is probably what I hated most about the season. By Jax stating it was an unwritten by-law it completely invalidated everything that had motivated Juice in season 4. It would have made far more sense to have Jax just print out a nearly identical copy of the rules and mentions that some changes had been made to them and SAMCRO would be pushing for this new version to be adapted organization wide by ALL charters, no exceptions and when the other presidents looked through the rules they should have been like: Wheres the change? at which point Jax would point out that By Law 3, section 9 subsection 3f--The No Blacks Clause--had been removed. It didn't seem like anyone cared about the Black Rule, it was just an old grandfather clause anyway. To say that it was an unwritten rule after the way that Juice, Chibs, Jax and Bobby had all reacted in seasons 4 and 5 was just sooooo stupid.  It would have been nice to see internal politics between crime organizations, to see SAMCRO serve another charter for a change. To see Jax come up with a solution to a problem that wasn't a ""club solution"" because I remember that Bobby once told Jax that he wouldn't make it anywhere else because his solution to a problem would always be a club solution, for Jax to show otherwise at the end would have shown much more growth in his character.  Gemma should have gone to prison or killed herself to avoid going. After Jax caught up with her and she wanted him to end-her, he should have icily handed her over to the police--let her take the hit for Unser and own up to Tara. Jax should have gotten himself and his boys out of SOA if thats what he wanted or else he should have cleaned up SAMCRO so that it was something he wouldn't have to be ashamed for his sons to join.  I'd have liked to see Juice come to his senses--to realize that SAMCRO had changed into something else that he, personally, couldn't hang with anymore, and to get out of it. To perform one big act that saved SOA or SAMCRO or Jax to earn his complete pardon and then walk away from the life like a man.  It would've made for fantastic finale to a drama/tragedy such as SOA if at the end of the show, SAMCRO was 100% legit and there was a time skip of a few years. To see SAMCRO chilling in their clubhouse and have a rival/enemy roll up with assault rifles and then cut to black with gunfire and screams in the back ground, implying that all of SAMCRO died in the end anyway."
Sonsofanarchy,2uvxed,BroomPerson21,3,Thu Feb 5 19:54:22 2015 UTC,"Fan- fucking- tastic points!  I honestly thought the Jarry Chibbs deal was going to end in Chibbs leaving Samcro or that she would be killed and cause Chibbs to hate the club, but alas she was a throw away character like so many others were.  Spot on about Quinn Montez and the other background SAMCRO members. They had zero development and if all of them had been killed it would not matter at all.  My girlfriend actually said this to me as the show aired and she did not mean it in a racist way but she said ""Why do I even care about the bylaw if I am not going to see it make a difference and why did Juice have to suffer then""?  I didnt get what she was saying at first but now i see it. Jax biggest contribution was basically allowing minorities into the club. While a nice sentiment what does it mean in the overall drama of Sons?  And count me in as someone who thinks the better punishment for Gemma would have been if he let her go and then she found out that Jax had did what he did in the final show. Living with all of that guilt is far better punishment.  Bobby was always the voice of reason and his puppy dog act in the final year was very disappointing. What happened to the Bobby who tried to reason with Clay and Jax in the first few seasons?"

When I saw that scene between Jax and Nero after Darvany, I was like Hmm, wonder how all of this is going to come back to bit him in the arse?  Jax set that whole downward spiral in motion when he lied to Nero, the same way that Clay set his downward spiral in motion when he lied to Jax at the end of Season 1. When Jax confronted Clay about Donnas death and said whatever the truth is, I'll accept it. Nero pulled Jax to the side and asked him plainly, without anger or judgement, ""was this you?""  I always thought Jax using Juice to off Darvany was the stupidest thing he could have done in that situation. I'm not sure how using Juice to kill Darvany in that way proved Juices loyalty to the club--Juice was motivated by desperation and guilt. Jax should have had him kill someone who was a genuine threat or perform an actual service to the club, not Darvany.  If Jax had been patient, if he'd been 1/10 as smart as he thought that he was, he'd have allowed SAMCRO to ""get Darvany out of town."" like Nero asked, then banged an overdose into her arm and left her in a random hotel where it'd have looked like an accidental overdose. Especially with her boyfriend/bodyguard out of the way, it'd have been the smart play.  But no, kill her at your cabin and bury her body right outside the back door. Not one of the federal agencies that are watching you will EVER come and search on or near SAMCROs affiliated property.  That is a much quieter, safer and smarter way to handle it."

Idk he didn't fit the bill like happy or any of the guys with that ""I've seen/done some real shit man"". He was good for the character and what they needed for the show but again, made him just a big teddy bear lookin guy not intimidating enough. Just my personal thoughts on ol filthy Phil."
Sonsofanarchy,2umj1c,mydogziegen,3,Tue Feb 3 14:33:02 2015 UTC,"Yea he doesn't mesh well with the group to a degree.  But I got the impression that he was always the teddy bear type growing up, a pushover, which led to him getting picked on growing up, and sort of an outcast. So he joins up with a bunch of outlaws and societal outcasts to toughen up and feel accepted.  I can't remember if we were given a backstory on him during the show, but I think that's why he ended up with club."
Sonsofanarchy,2umj1c,beermit,2,Tue Feb 3 20:08:57 2015 UTC,Didn't he join with a whole bunch of prospects back when the MC was desperately in need of manpower? Think it was due to the whole cartel thing.

Sonsofanarchy,2umj1c,etherinmylungs,2,Tue Feb 3 16:14:02 2015 UTC,Didn't seem to fit the club.  They probably only cast him to try to make Juice look tougher by comparison.
Sonsofanarchy,2umj1c,giant_lebowski,1 point,Tue Feb 3 20:01:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah I agree with the fact that he didn't seem to fit, but I think that he idealized the club like a lot of the kids in that town.

Sonsofanarchy,2upaar,Tharnax,3,Thu Feb 5 00:59:34 2015 UTC,"There's quite a lot of padding in the series, extra scenes and dialogue, cluttered messy side stories.  Sutter and the writers had to fill hours of time so there's inevitable fat that they couldn't cut between the major plot points and developments due to time.  I think the reality is that they could have told the entire story in 4 or 5 seasons, but since the show was a huge hit they continued on."

But I also get really upset when watching 1-4 because it reminds me of how much promise the show had and how it went off the deep end quickly. I still, to this day, think the pilot is one of the best pilots I have ever seen. I HATED Breaking Bad's pilot - and I consider the show one of the all time greats. I put SOA's pilot up there with Mad Men's pilot which is a huge compliment in my book."
Sonsofanarchy,2ud7iz,gizmatic,11,Sun Feb 1 02:07:22 2015 UTC,"He does. I don't recall who mentioned it, but I know it was an early season seven episode. It was mentioned that SAMCRO or Gemma contacted his sister while looking for him, but she hadn't seen him for years."
Sonsofanarchy,2ud7iz,NullaLexInk,4,Sun Feb 1 02:13:49 2015 UTC,"Oh, thank you. Its in S07E01, now that you mention it. When Gemma and Jax are driving to Scoops, at the beginning."

Sonsofanarchy,2ud7iz,Herculesmngmnt,2,Sun Feb 1 02:46:04 2015 UTC,the stabbing was season 2 i think episode 7 or somewhere around there

Sonsofanarchy,2uc4gc,FashionablyFake,1 point,Sat Jan 31 21:15:38 2015 UTC,"^ Bingo. Its just like spitting in someone after you have killed them, knocked them out et al. Granted where Jax shot Clay he knew he was dead, but people can take a lot of bullets at times and survive. That's similar to all this foolishness surrounding Mike Brown an how it was ""excessive"" to have shot him 6,7,8,9 times or whatever the cop did. Its not like its 1 and ""Ok, that does it. I'll put my gun down now."""

Sonsofanarchy,2uc4gc,asstasticbum,1 point,Sun Feb 1 06:37:18 2015 UTC,"That's what it looks like, but stripper and en bloc clips are inserted into an internal fixed magazine within the firearm. The M1 Garand's iconic feature after firing all 8 rounds is ejecting the en bloc clip from it's internal magazine. That's why it's good to remember clip>mag>firearm."
Sonsofanarchy,2uc4gc,TheOneTrueJeebus,1 point,Sun Feb 1 12:02:49 2015 UTC,"Not a gun guy.  So is it bullets go into the clip, the clip goes into the mag, the mage goes into the gun?  Why is it wrong to say empty the clip?  When speaking of bullets, it seems to me you are emptying all three."
Sonsofanarchy,2uc4gc,Cicer,1 point,Thu Feb 5 16:01:14 2015 UTC,"Some people load their magazines by individually pushing every bullet in, one at a time. However if you used up your (on average) 8-11 magazines in a war zone and need to reload a mag you prefer to do it faster via stripper clips. You place the clip over the magazine, push down and all the bullets on the clip are inserted into the mag.  When Jax shot, the bullets were loaded into the magazine. Therefore he was emptying the mag and not the clip. This is a good comparison  If you're more interested, I recommend speed reading through this Wikipedia article. It pretty much explains everything."
Sonsofanarchy,2uc4gc,TheOneTrueJeebus,2,Thu Feb 5 16:12:28 2015 UTC,"Clip (ammunition):       A clip is a device that is used to store multiple rounds of ammunition together as a unit, ready for insertion into the magazine or cylinder of a firearm. This speeds up the process of loading and reloading the firearm as several rounds can be loaded at once, rather than one round being loaded at a time. Several different types of clips exist, most of which are made of inexpensive metal stampings that are designed to be disposable, though they are often re-used.  The defining difference between clips and magazines is the presence of a feed mechanism in a magazine, typically a spring-loaded follower, which a clip lacks.

Sonsofanarchy,2uc4gc,jamesacichon,3,Sat Jan 31 21:01:36 2015 UTC,"For the most part, it's normally emotions like contempt, anger, etc.  In the scene in question with Clay, like /u/craigo2247 they had to make it look like a shootout. One bullet to the neck seems suspicious :P any time there's a cover-up, they have to use more bullets to make it seem legit."
Sonsofanarchy,2uc4gc,yakityyakblah,2,Sat Jan 31 23:05:30 2015 UTC,And a significant amount of Jax' kills are cover ups. Guy is always murdering Peter to fool Paul.
Sonsofanarchy,2uc4gc,CopyRogueLeader,1 point,Sun Feb 1 05:13:19 2015 UTC,"That was the point I was gonna make, multiple bullets looks more believable than just the one. Also, Jax does so much overkill when he's in vengeance mode: snowglobe, Asianbro torture scene, etc. Gemma's the only one he was economical about his energy with, and he was probably pretty emotionally exhausted at that point."

Sonsofanarchy,2uc4gc,BillNyeStillHigh,2,Sat Jan 31 22:59:10 2015 UTC,He shot him in the neck. He didn't die from the first bullet. He then shot him in the chest and stomach. He wanted him to feel it.
Sonsofanarchy,2uc4gc,richierich925,1 point,Sun Feb 1 03:18:44 2015 UTC,I read something after that episode that each bullet was for someone close to Jax that Clay had a hand in killing.
Sonsofanarchy,2uc4gc,Cassial,1 point,Sun Feb 1 02:52:58 2015 UTC,"In the case of Clay's Overkill, it's because they had to arrange the scene. And they needed Clay's body there looking ""shot the fuck up"" - not just ""they took their sweet time and he died of one well aimed shot standing perfectly still and took it"".  Other than that instance where they altered the murder scene, most of the overkills are done out of vengeance/emotions, rightfully so. I would find this show boring as all hell if everyone was killed by one clean shot all the time, because with how many people get shot and killed in this show, you tend to forget how they died.   The Overkill element is used along with the HOLY SHIT SURPRISE SHOT TO THE FACE (best award there goes to Gaalan in my opinion) as a means to make it more memorable. I absolutely love more than anything when somebody gets shot mid sentence. Especially when we/they didn't see it coming."
Sonsofanarchy,2uc4gc,JaxTeller718,1 point,Sun Feb 1 16:35:40 2015 UTC,I remember yelling HOLY SHIT when Gaalan went down and the that slow creeping realization that Clay was fucked. That whole airport scene was great writing and suspense right down to Tara clutching Jax  hand with her broken wrist to say thank you for what he did to her.
Sonsofanarchy,2uc4gc,CreepyAbelTeller,1 point,Thu Feb 5 22:26:55 2015 UTC,They needed to make Clay's kill look like the result of a shootout + Jax had wanted to put a bullet in him for a long time.
Sonsofanarchy,2ucytf,TheCookieThief,9,Sun Feb 1 00:45:53 2015 UTC,"To me the true climax of the season (and the series) was the second to last episode. Having Jax find out what Gemma did, and that confrontation - that's what the entire season had been building towards.   The finale itself was more about cleaning up all of the smaller plot lines, and saying goodbye to the characters we'd all grown to love over the last seven years. There wasn't really any suspense - we all knew what was going to happen to Jax, it was just a matter of watching how it would play out.  So no, you're not missing anything. The finale was meant to be a bittersweet ending, not an exciting edge-of-your-seat thrill ride."
Sonsofanarchy,2ucytf,rmsersen,5,Sun Feb 1 10:43:15 2015 UTC,"I was pretty hyped through the final season, definitely going into the last episode. However, it was the second to last episode that I found myself the most anxious for and on the edge of my seat for."

Sonsofanarchy,2ucytf,CreepyAbelTeller,2,Sun Feb 1 18:50:24 2015 UTC,"I would say there was more hype going into 7.1, 7.11 and 7.12 than the series finale. Jax's fate was more clear than ever by the end of 7.11. I only wish half of the episodes in Season 7 had been either axed or redone because the final season of arguably my favorite show for the last 6 years was a huge letdown."
Sonsofanarchy,2ucytf,JaxTeller718,2,Sun Feb 1 22:18:49 2015 UTC,"There was hype but not THAt intense because everyone was reeling from the end of 12. In my opinion 12 and 13 should have been re-edited and played off as one 2 hour finale, because if you take all of that as one tight episode it would have been an emotional rollercoaster."
Sonsofanarchy,2ucytf,mtndewslimjimstarbur,2,Thu Feb 5 22:33:51 2015 UTC,"I wasn't hyped for it at all, I was pissed they were ending it. It was a stupid ending. Jax stil had his sons to live for . They get raised by OG Nero if he lives and Wendy but Abel knows Jax was a SOA he saw too much to forget. So they just ended it bad to me. I guess Hunam wanted to go be in movies now , which is dumb move."
Sonsofanarchy,2ucytf,VinniVilla,1 point,Sun Feb 1 19:49:50 2015 UTC,"The ending for me at least gave space to a sequel, as you said Abel saw to much to just forget, i think he would want to get in the club and know everything that happened to his father and his mother, but that might be me just hoping to get a sequel             EDIT: and in the last shot of him he still had the SON ring Gemma gave to him so i do think it might happen"
Sonsofanarchy,2ucytf,JasonBored,1 point,Mon Feb 2 10:56:04 2015 UTC,"You woulda had to be there man. It's hard to describe. There was a certain amount of.. anxiety? (excitement? sadness? wild fucking speculation?). Most people more or less had an idea how the Jax's character would end up. But the journey to that point, and more importantly Jax finding out the truth was more of an ""edge of your seat"" moment #1, and his ultimate reaction was moment #2.  Not to say the other issues (who was the rat? Juice's fate? situation with Jury? Nero/Wendy/the kids? future of SAMCRO? fate of enemies & alliances?) weren't also hyped up to overdrive.  I'm still awestruck by the slow-mo procession/escort/chase every time I think of it. That was one of the most memorable scenes in television for me."
Sonsofanarchy,2u7odv,Rawdreago,8,Fri Jan 30 16:59:41 2015 UTC,"Its interesting that in the beginning, Jax was hesitant to kill--didn't want to kill the guys at all.  In the end, he was only waiting to kill. Had his mind dead set on shooting and killing Marks."

He didn't have any redeeming features, in my opinion. Everyone else, with the possible exception of Stahl, had at least something to redeem them. And Zobelle. I guess he didn't really either, since his love for his daughter was so creepy and ultimately he deserted without her, not knowing what had happened...

When he was trapped in the Deli mart he called Charming PD to report that the Sons had him pinned and Hale told him something to the effect that ""Its a bad day for the Zobelles leaving town, we just found your daughter shot to death in a ATF safehouse..."" Hale said he'd send some help, but just hung up the phone and walked away.  So, Zobelle knew his daughter was dead when he left the country, but he wasn't sure about her status when he left her in Charming."

Zobelle's daughter was also a ridiculous bitch. He's the reason why I don't really like S2. Like, it's my least favorite season. Everything that's worth watching happens in the last four episodes.  Ironically, one of my favorite characters was Damon Pope. I don't know why, but he had that charisma and ruthless edge that wasn't unbecoming of someone as notorious as he was. Harold P. played him perfectly and his scenes were some of my favorites.  Half-Sack, although I didn't hate him, didn't play a huge part in the series for me to give a shit about him, so I would consider him a ""least favorite"" if I took the phrase literally.  There were characters that I hated at first (Alvarez, Darby, and Lyla) that I ended up really liking towards the end, however."
Sonsofanarchy,2u4xa5,CreepyAbelTeller,1 point,Fri Jan 30 01:11:03 2015 UTC,Is it just me or did they try and infer that Zobelle and his daughter had an incestuous relationship? Didn't he straight up kiss her on the lips?
Sonsofanarchy,2u4xa5,XxAzrielxX,1 point,Sun Feb 1 22:22:20 2015 UTC,"Perhaps. He was also just a creep in general. Like, when she was fooling around with Edmund Hayes (or whatever his name was, the Irish kid), he could smell Edmund on her hands.  He gave the okey-doke on AJ raping Gemma. I wouldn't put it past him to do some fooling around with his daughter."
Sonsofanarchy,2u4xa5,elkanor,6,Mon Feb 2 02:30:49 2015 UTC,"... I like Gemma. I like her character in its role in the series. I wouldn't want to know her in real life, but I think she was so vital and well acted and crafted. By the end of it, I really hated Jax too, as a person. Just the selfish, deluded arrogant little boy who never.fucking.learned. But as a character, loved him.  Lee Toric was too flat for me. Agent Stahl at least had some crazy to her, but that might have just been a poorly developed character.  I couldn't stand Marilyn Manson's acting and that made me hate Tully. Worst and most boring white supremacist character they ever had. Zobelle was a scary villain at least, with the economic future of Charming also an issue. Tully just made me want to sleep.  Oh, and Nero's non-sister felt tacked on and useless."
Sonsofanarchy,2u4xa5,justmighthaveto,5,Fri Jan 30 01:28:40 2015 UTC,Hector Salazar -  hated his acting and his mumbled English. I was glad when Jax stuck him with the knife and it was a relief to be done with the side bar issue as a whole.

Sonsofanarchy,2u4xa5,ticktock_heart,7,Fri Jan 30 04:29:29 2015 UTC,"I'm new to the subreddit because I recently started watching (starting season 7 now though!) and I'm kind of surprised by the fact that nobody seems to mention Tara in these discussions.   I'm guessing this is an unpopular opinion, but I kind of think she's a hypocrite and a terrible mother. There are episodes where she wakes her tiny children at night just to hear them cry and then walks away, she ignores their crying so she can keep smoking, and she generally uses them as pawns to get back at people she doesn't like. She assumes a self-righteous attitude toward the club while using violence, corruption, and manipulation to further her own agenda. tbqh, I'll always think she came back to Charming knowing that her stalker problem would be resolved with SAMCROvian justice and it seems like nobody (except maybe Gemma, but I'm not sure if that's just her possessiveness and paranoia at work rather than clarity) ever sees through her. I just find all her scenes very grating."
Sonsofanarchy,2u4xa5,warrior1839,7,Sat Jan 31 17:05:31 2015 UTC,"You hit right on target from my point of view. I seriously asked myself once if her only duty in life was to torment Jax and to break him in half between his club and his family knowing, obviously, that both were the same."
Sonsofanarchy,2u4xa5,ticktock_heart,1 point,Sun Feb 1 08:39:36 2015 UTC,Right? She honestly doesn't even seem to like Jax most of the time. I don't understand why she married him and started a family with him when she seems to derive more pleasure from Gemma's frustrations with their relationship than from the relationship itself.
Sonsofanarchy,2u4xa5,CreepyAbelTeller,2,Sun Feb 1 23:43:26 2015 UTC,"I think a big part of her self-loathing was her devotion to Jax. He was like a poison she couldn't get away from. I see what you mean when you say you don't think she liked Jax most of the time. I don't agree with it but I get it. Personally, I saw it as she deeply loved him - almost on an obsessive level. And it was mutual - he was in many ways similar to Kohn in his conquest for Tara. The difference is that a) they both were obsessed with each other and b) he was much more charming and suave about it. For a dude to basically confess that he has countless one night stands but he only sees one face for 10+ years - that's pretty nutty (even if it's a total panty dropper). There's a reason Gemma was so determined to keep them apart in Season 1 (other than the fact that she has an unhealthy control issue with her ""family"") -- Tara clearly broke Jax's heart and it never mended."
Sonsofanarchy,2u4xa5,ticktock_heart,1 point,Thu Feb 12 21:23:53 2015 UTC,"I totally see what you mean. Jax is definitely a little nutty about her too, I won't lie, and I 100% see them as obsessed with each other. I think my difference in opinion re: love is that I don't think that this obsession necessarily translates to love. (This is really just personal philosophy now, so no hate to anyone who doesn't agree!) I just don't really think you can love someone until you, for the most part, understand and accept who they are, otherwise it mostly breeds resentment and infatuation. I feel like that's something Tara never manages to accomplish, so she always gets stuck in the resentment/infatuation rut.   I definitely agree with you about the Gemma thing though. Mama knew what was up."
Sonsofanarchy,2u4xa5,CreepyAbelTeller,2,Sat Feb 14 13:41:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah - that's a good point re: resent/infatuation rut. The way I saw it - and I think this is what Sutter was trying to convey (though if he succeeded is up in the air) is that Tara saw him as more than just SAMCRO. She was really the only person to see him as something outside of the club -- a good father, a good husband and a genuine lover. She wanted him to not only want more for his family but for himself. And I think that is what Jax struggled with - he wanted to be a better man but the pull of his history (and the life long manipulation of Mama G) was too strong."
Sonsofanarchy,2u4xa5,mtndewslimjimstarbur,2,Sat Feb 14 14:44:08 2015 UTC,"She's the reason for all the trouble, she tried to show those letters and ruin jaxs' famlily. In their life JT was weak he had to go . That was old shit Clay raised Jax and you could tell he loved him and thought of him as his son. Tara just caused problems and tried to even let Jax go to prison a couple of times."
Sonsofanarchy,2u4xa5,CreepyAbelTeller,1 point,Sun Feb 1 20:03:50 2015 UTC,"Um. Are you serious? She was the one who didn't want to show Jax the letters because she didn't know how he would react and it would break his heart. And how is it old shit when the man you consider your father and your own mother assisted in the murder of your biological father? There's no expiration date on that kind of betrayal. And I have no idea what you mean by ""tried to even let Jax go to prison a couple of times"" - pretty sure a career criminal who murders and tortures people for a living sets those plans in motion himself."
Sonsofanarchy,2u4xa5,ticktock_heart,2,Sun Feb 1 21:30:34 2015 UTC,"I feel you on the no-expiration-date thing, but really, in terms of Tara letting Jax go to prison or wanting him to, she's again kind of a hypocrite. She's alright with his criminal career when it suits her, and when it doesn't, she rejects it and him.   In theory (and I'm not saying this is necessarily sound in real life; the show's universe sort of requires a suspension of disbelief), if you're going to be an MC guy's old lady, you know who and what he is, and you know what you're signing up for. Tara's the only one who seems to delude herself into believing that she is somehow different and superior — that her life as an old lady will be vastly different from that of every other woman before and after her. She's an immature girl who wants to date a bad boy for his cachet but doesn't want the baggage that comes with that and (naively) thinks that she can somehow change him. She doesn't truly like the person he is, and she resents him for the difference between the aspirational Jax and his reality. It's an old trope, really, but they masked it well with a doctor's lab coat and some well-worn tank-tops."

Sonsofanarchy,2u1p6a,Sorabella,8,Thu Jan 29 04:17:36 2015 UTC,"At the beginning of the episode, Jury was the leader of a small, independent club called The Devils Tribe. ""The Tribe"" was a single entity--it didn't have other charters in other places, and it was a friend-club to Sons of Anarchys MOTHER Charter, SAMCRO, and so its members were noted as ""friends of the SOA"".  The Tribe had called Jax because an SOA rival club--The Mayans, which is a big, incorporated club with multiple charters, like the SOA--was hassling them. The Nevada Mayans wanted the Tribe to pay them to be left alone and The Tribe wanted help dealing with the Mayan charter that was bullying them, so to speak.  Rather than just go down there and tell the Mayans to leave The Tribe alone, SAMCRO--the mother charter of the SOA--patched them over. They asked the members of the Devils Tribe to close down their independent club and become a member of the Sons of Anarchy, by joining the Sons, the Nevada MC members STOPPED being members of the Devils Tribe and became Sons of Anarchy.  So now, instead of being The Devils Tribe--an independent MC in Nevada, the Tribe became an SOA charter. Other SOA Charters would come to visit them, help them, hang out with them and call on them for help. Essentially SOA adopted the Devils Tribe officially and changed their name. So, now the Mayans in Nevada couldn't risk picking on the MC in Nevada, because if they pissed off Jurys MC in Nevada, they'd have to deal with any and all Sons from Washington, Oregon, California, Arizona, etc.  So, at the end of the episode, The Devils Tribe had died and Sons of Anarchy Motorcycle Club-- Indian Hills Charter had been born.  I gathered, from that episode that a ""Patch over"" is like being ""reborn"" as or ""baptised"" into another club. The Tribe was already a well-formed club, so its not like they had no idea about what was what and how to act as an MC, but they ""transformed"" into a SONs charter so that they wouldn't be hasseled/bullied by larger, better established outlaw gangs.  Recall, in the show, The Sons of Anarchy has close to 30 charters--or clubs--many of them in the US North-West, but some in other states and even in Europe. People recognize the name and if you're involved with the underbelly of society/crime then the Sons of Anarchy is not someone you would want to mess with, because if you piss off one charter, you've pissed off all of the charters. So, thats why Clay said patching over the Tribe was good for both--SOA gets a new charter in Nevada, gives them a presence and a jumping off point if they want to expand in the state, and the MC that used to the Devils Tribe gets greater respect/recognition.  I'm guessing that like any international organization that Sons of Anarchy clubs have to get permission from SAMCRO to even incorporate. Thats why they have SAMCRO, SAMTAZ, SAMBEL, SAMDino, etc...They are all Sons of Anarchy Motorcycle clubs, but each one gets its own ""nickname"" based on area/location.  SAMCRO stands for Sons of Anarchy Motorcycle Club Redwood Originals. I'm guessing that Clay, as the President of the mother charter, has the power to allow/deny a new charter of the SOA to form--its probably like forming a Scout troop/sports team within a league, you get permission from the board, well, SAMCRO is the board that says who can/can't become a charter."

Sonsofanarchy,2u1p6a,SamothSpawn,2,Thu Jan 29 04:51:25 2015 UTC,No Jax's uncle Jury is the Indian Hills president. It's just another soa chapter amongst the many throughout the states.
Sonsofanarchy,2u1p6a,SamothSpawn,2,Thu Jan 29 05:18:24 2015 UTC,"Ok, but then what is the significance of a patch over? What did that actually do?"
Sonsofanarchy,2u1p6a,caseyuer,2,Thu Jan 29 05:36:24 2015 UTC,"The mayans were growing in the state of Nevada and California, they had little presence in Nevada so they patched them over to make the organization bigger, stronger. Basically to push back the rivals territory."
Sonsofanarchy,2u1p6a,GrubstakeMoose,4,Thu Jan 29 05:40:58 2015 UTC,Indian Hills were originally called the Devils Tribe. Now they sons of anarchy Indian Hills
Sonsofanarchy,2u1p6a,GrubstakeMoose,2,Thu Jan 29 05:45:38 2015 UTC,"So they went from Sons of anarchy indian hills to .....?  What actual difference was there from before the patch over to after? I know why they did it and I remember the conversations they had about it, but what was the actual effect and what is jury's relation to SAMCRO now."
Sonsofanarchy,2u1p6a,UNICY,1 point,Thu Jan 29 14:34:55 2015 UTC,"They went from Devils tribe, to SOA. It guarantees you a certain amount of protection, and access- think of all the times SAMCRO uses the help of nomads and other charters.   It also means an action against that charter would be an action against SOA as itself. So when people attack it they are going to war with a very large organization, not just a single charter club."
Sonsofanarchy,2u1p6a,paulieman89,1 point,Fri Jan 30 10:46:15 2015 UTC,"Jury says something to the effect of ""Some of these guys aren't cut out for SAMCRO,"" which is confusing. They weren't going to be part of SAMCRO, but a new charter. All of the big 1% clubs have affiliated clubs that share colors and are loyal to the big club. Sometimes, the affiliated club becomes a new chapter/charter."
Sonsofanarchy,2u1p6a,some_dunkaroos,0,Thu Jan 29 14:13:16 2015 UTC,So they were SOA before but now are more SOA? or they were a whole other gang and are now SOA?
Sonsofanarchy,2u1p6a,mtndewslimjimstarbur,2,Thu Jan 29 14:35:42 2015 UTC,"Sorry, by ""share colors,"" I mean that the affiliated clubs wear black & white, red & white, red & yellow, etc., or in the fictional example of the Sons and the Devil's Tribe, blue & white."
Sonsofanarchy,2twufw,ICameBack4uSaul,20,Wed Jan 28 01:35:54 2015 UTC,"I think that it is. My understanding is that the plans for the Prequel are tentative and in-the works but I've read in a couple of places that Prequel (I think its titled, ""First 9"") is in the works. Its supposed to be a couple of years before it goes into production though."

Sonsofanarchy,2txaqe,Weltall548,7,Wed Jan 28 03:47:02 2015 UTC,"Phil was my favorite character. I always knew something either terrible or awesome would come of him based off of their lack of depth to him. To see him gunned down like a bitch was really the turning point for me from an A+ show to what it kind of droned on into.    I'd still be watching it week-to-week if it was still going, but it just wasn't the same after that (seemingly meaningless) turning point."
Sonsofanarchy,2txaqe,mrshll,3,Wed Jan 28 09:32:11 2015 UTC,Can I ask how such a minor part became your favorite character? I'm actually curious..I liked his character and thought he had some good lines though limited but they brought nothing to character development for him in my opinion.
Sonsofanarchy,2txaqe,mschmitt1217,4,Wed Jan 28 13:48:27 2015 UTC,Just a fan of the underdog is all. He was cool as shit.
Sonsofanarchy,2txaqe,mrshll,5,Wed Jan 28 13:57:24 2015 UTC,I'm right there with you. I just loved the idea of a big fat goofy coke-bottle glasses lookin dude making a go of it in a biker gang.
Sonsofanarchy,2txaqe,cat_handcuffs,2,Wed Jan 28 14:12:29 2015 UTC,"fair enough my friend like I said, just curious. I enjoyed his character and did wish they did more with him. Seemed like a pretty good actor too. It also helps that he did a couple AMAs and has been on this sub-reddit a few times as well lol."
Sonsofanarchy,2txaqe,mschmitt1217,3,Wed Jan 28 16:33:19 2015 UTC,His character could have been developed a little more..........but it might have come at the expense of cutting down on some of those montages.   heh heh heh heh
Sonsofanarchy,2txaqe,jeff15209,2,Wed Jan 28 18:47:32 2015 UTC,But he was just a prospect. How can you give much story to a prospect ?
Sonsofanarchy,2txaqe,Mayhem5100,6,Wed Jan 28 11:03:33 2015 UTC,He was half the man the sack was.
Sonsofanarchy,2txaqe,eatingdonuts,3,Wed Jan 28 12:59:30 2015 UTC,He was a full patch. It happened between seasons four and five.

Sonsofanarchy,2txaqe,gizmatic,3,Thu Jan 29 15:52:32 2015 UTC,I thought he and Rat got patched at the same time?
Sonsofanarchy,2txaqe,cat_handcuffs,2,Wed Jan 28 14:13:23 2015 UTC,"No, he got full patch WAY before Rat even though they were prospects at the same time. Phil really proved himself."
Sonsofanarchy,2txaqe,TheAdmiralCrunch,2,Fri Jan 30 09:21:15 2015 UTC,"I really liked Phil. The big fucking sasquatch teddy bear. Watching him play with the kids, and the fact that he seemed to just be made of fucking iron. And when there was a gunfight I remember him taking out more people than anyone, but this could be remembered wrong."
Sonsofanarchy,2txaqe,TheAdmiralCrunch,1 point,Fri Jan 30 09:20:45 2015 UTC,"Thats the problem with having a large ensemble cast I guess. Think about it--we know more about Jax and Venus Van Dammes backstory than we do anyone else.  We have no idea where any of the characters came from or where they might have been going in life when they got bitten by the MC bug. It would have been nice to see/hear from the family members of some of the fallen members.  I always wondered where Phil came from. He was like the least likely to be a criminal. What I mean is if you met them in life and had a 3 min small-talk conversation each member of SAMCRO, you would probably never guess that Phil was a criminal. So big, gentle and unassuming."
Sonsofanarchy,2txaqe,gizmatic,0,Wed Jan 28 14:29:50 2015 UTC,"Actually Phil is exactly what I hate in most TV shows. There are few major characters, a bunch of supporting characters and the rest of the world is the fucking vessels of a human that are mute zombies.

Sonsofanarchy,2txbv9,gizmatic,1 point,Fri Jan 30 10:50:03 2015 UTC,"Well, I am new to the online SOA community so I will take your word for it, but why don't you share some of your reasons for liking/loving Seasons 5-7.  Personally, I love discussing all things SOA--characters, stories, arc, etc. so lets discuss Seasons 5-7.  Which arcs from Season 5-7 were your favorite? How did your top 3 favorite characters evolve in these seasons? What did you feel was the short coming of each season? What, did you feel, was the highlight of each season?  Give us something to discuss with you friend."
Sonsofanarchy,2txbv9,gizmatic,2,Wed Jan 28 14:51:55 2015 UTC,"Season 5 introduced Damon Pope, my favorite SOA villain, and Nero, one of my favorite SOA characters. I enjoyed watching all of the awful things Pope did, especially to Tig. This made it especially satisfying when he died.  The highlight of Season 6 was Jax trying to get out of guns, IMO. Galen was a pretty good villain. I'm glad Clay finally died, too. The school shooting story wasn't very interesting, but it wasn't bad. I wish Tara didn't do the things she did behing Jax's back.   Season 7, despite dragging things out, did a good job of concluding everything. The CGI was somewhat bad in a few episodes, but it didn't bother me too much."
Sonsofanarchy,2txbv9,MojoLoko,2,Wed Jan 28 15:18:01 2015 UTC,"I really wanted Pope to stick around--he was a charismatic, intelligent, and level-headed boss. I never really viewed him as a villain so much as an adversary.  Personally I didn't want to like Nero-I mourned the loss of Clay/Gemma as a couple, from the pilot to Season 4 episode 8, they were one of the best couples on the limited amount of TV that I watch and definitely one of my favorites--but Nero played and important role, ultimately it was useless, but while I was watching, I loved how Season 5 found Jax with these 2 new mentors, sort of the Angel and Devils on his shoulders.  Pope on his left, Nero on his right.  Pope had success, esteem, respect, wealth and influence. He could have walked away from a life of crime, but didn't even want to. Never crossed his mind to back out but staying off the radar was his only real concern. Nero was small-time but legitimate. He'd suffered and loss from his past crimes, he was smart enough though not to repeat his mistakes and was determined to stay on the up-and-up. Nero was what a ""successful"" Jax/Clay would have looked like and it was painful to be reminded of their failings every time that he was on screen, so I kind of resented him as a character--but between Nero being Nero and the fact that the actor who portrayed Nero is kind of phenomenal, Nero kind of won me over.  It made an interesting contrast in Season 5 to see Jax with those mentors."

Episode 1 of this show is VERY different from the final episode, even though I love how the characters grew and arced I still feel the main story was Clay vs Jax and the show lost something when Clay left."

It's something I felt faded a lot as the show went on and became more about internal and external conflict and less about the way SAMCRO functioned on a day to day basis

Sonsofanarchy,2trqp2,deltolink,4,Mon Jan 26 22:18:18 2015 UTC,I think he had strong suspicion but when it came time where he had a final talk with Gemma. It was too late for it to matter or for him to care. He was past the rubicon so to speak.
Sonsofanarchy,2trqp2,Chaos-13,3,Mon Jan 26 23:07:42 2015 UTC,"I think the truth no longer really mattered. He had his own truth, which was that he needed to sacrifice himself before his kids got letters like that in their bags."
Sonsofanarchy,2trqp2,FashionablyFake,2,Mon Jan 26 23:15:51 2015 UTC,"I agree with both /u/Chaos-13 and /u/FashionablyFake in that he had a strong suspicion about it but by that time it really would not have mattered due to him finding out about Gemma killing Tara.  Adding on to /u/Chaos-13's sentiments, the doubt over his death and not knowing the truth was drilled home further by Jury before Jax killed him. So in the end was Jax directly told about Gemma being involved with JT's death? No. Was Gemma involved now is the bigger question at hand. And again, would it even matter? No, Clay was already dead and now Gemma was dying no matter what.  Also remember whether or not you think he was involved or simply collateral damage; Clay showed Unser the letters in season 4 and Unsers response to them was just slightly concerning; a manner showing he knew of what was going to happen or at least knew of what happened and perhaps aided in a cover up. So Unser exited at the same time as Gemm, Jax either took him out as having even been close to it and that was not outright said to us, or he was again just collateral damage.  In the end, it did not matter and would not have mattered. Jax knew where he was going and who controlled his fate that night."
Sonsofanarchy,2trqp2,asstasticbum,2,Mon Jan 26 23:42:15 2015 UTC,"John's death is a sticky wicket. Even John's oldest friends were divided. Piney thought John was murdered and Jury thought he killed himself. I kinda fall on the side of murdered. The letters he wrote said if he dies Clay and Gemma did it. That doesn't sound like a man that was going to kill himself, unless something drastic happened in the short time between the last letter and his death."
Sonsofanarchy,2trqp2,Chaos-13,1 point,Tue Jan 27 04:15:24 2015 UTC,"As others have said, the truth didn't matter at the point he knew he would kill his mother. Clay was already dead, so was Piney who was Johns closest friend and with Gemma about to die anyone involved in the potential murder of his father were all going to be dead shortly. I think once Jax had killed his mother the truth was dead and the only thing he cared about was making sure his Sons never ended up with his lifestyle."
Sonsofanarchy,2tsg2a,Unexpectedfart,2,Tue Jan 27 01:34:07 2015 UTC,Spoiler Alert ⚠ I'm not sure what episode it is unfortunately. When Jax is leaving Brooke's Father's (Gary Putnam) house he sees a picture on the wall and says to Brooke's Father that the woman in the picture looked familiar. Brooke's Father said that it was her Mother(Emily Putnam) and that she had a history of mental illness and died in a car accident.  I don't think she died in the accident. I think that seeing JT die the way he did affected her already weakend mental health.   Just my opinion.

In my spoiler tag I am not going to mention specific episodes but I am going to list two specific seasons that if you are binge watching and rip through the episodes very quickly you will want to take notice of post titles here. These particular seasons I am mentioning so you should probably avoid anything related to them if you see the season numbers in a post title. That being said, click or do not click, I just want to give you a heads up so nothing plot wise is ruined for you and again - they are not the specific episodes just the seasons. SPOILER  Welcome again.  'Come Join The Murder'  a."
Sonsofanarchy,2tp7ch,Equalizer101,2,Mon Jan 26 20:22:06 2015 UTC,Prepare yourself. Season 1 is nothing compare to what's going to happen. It will be getting worst and worst.
Sonsofanarchy,2tp7ch,Gstreetshit,1 point,Mon Jan 26 15:40:01 2015 UTC,End of season 2 beginning of season 3 is the best.

Sonsofanarchy,2tn0yb,LonrSpankster,6,Sun Jan 25 19:21:53 2015 UTC,I hated how they showed Juice suffering so much.. Ok...we get it.  He is doomed. I don't need to see him getting raped every episode.
Sonsofanarchy,2tn0yb,mentallimit,4,Sun Jan 25 21:43:42 2015 UTC,"I think one of Juice's lines that made me simultaneously LOL and cringe out of sympathy was ""Have at it."" right before the prison triad gangbang."
Sonsofanarchy,2tn0yb,JasonBored,2,Mon Jan 26 07:53:25 2015 UTC,"He just really gave up on life at that point. He knew he was going to die, and wants to die in SAMCRO's good graces. I liked how they came full circle with that unwritten bylaw getting removed, so another Juice situation doesn't happen again."
Sonsofanarchy,2tn0yb,Nocturnal2425,2,Sun Jan 25 22:04:01 2015 UTC,Yeah they really overdid the prison rape. It got kinda ridiculous.
Sonsofanarchy,2tn0yb,Deer-In-A-Headlock,7,Tue Jan 27 20:13:15 2015 UTC,"I personally liked it. Jax died, Gemma died, and pretty much everyone who should have died, did die. Well, Unser shouldn't have died, he was a good person, but on the other hand he really should have been dead a while ago with his illness.   It wasn't great, but at least it wasn't bad. Before SOA, my favourite show was Dexter, and god that had such an awful ending."
Sonsofanarchy,2tn0yb,afro_aficionado,2,Sun Jan 25 21:07:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah the first season, I hated Usner, but then by the end of the series, I hated to see him go"
Sonsofanarchy,2tn0yb,jamesacichon,3,Sun Jan 25 21:13:40 2015 UTC,i wanted juice to live but not keep taking dicks in the ass
Sonsofanarchy,2tn0yb,SilkyDarts,1 point,Wed Jan 28 02:45:44 2015 UTC,"Juice was a very conflicting storyline. He would act like a bitch at times, and at others he would step up."
Sonsofanarchy,2tn0yb,Propanex,2,Wed Jan 28 10:54:53 2015 UTC,"Opposite with me, for some reason I liked unser less and less as the series went on. Especially his role in getting Tara killed"
Sonsofanarchy,2tn0yb,UNICY,2,Fri Feb 6 01:03:36 2015 UTC,"I didn't want him to die. But then I really thought about that last line. ""This is all I got left."" She was his world and Jax knew it would destroy him to watch her die."
Sonsofanarchy,2tn0yb,Propanex,3,Mon Jan 26 03:17:37 2015 UTC,"I agree with your opinion on the idea that the series final season is trying to show the real face of that life. I was actually hoping that would come earlier in the series. The whole time the characters were depicted as the good guys because that's the perspective we get. But these guys are straight up criminals and killers. The honor that comes from their code is an illusion. Look just how much damage has Gemma caused in the name of 'protecting her family'. She kills her daughter in law and causes several more deaths with her lies. Opie lost his wife and his father because of the club/life. Tig lost his daughter. Bobby got killed. Jax has done so much to survive and keep his club yet he realizes he himself is the biggest threat to his closest ones. In the end, Abel is left without his biological parents with emotional scars that have already began to show. Not really much benefit in all that. Neither social or material (not like they were motivated by profits and making millions in selling guns). They all gave everything for the club and got nothing but misery in return."
Sonsofanarchy,2tn0yb,Mayhem5100,-4,Thu Jan 29 15:47:05 2015 UTC,"The last season sucked. Everything was rushed. It kinda sucked man.. The first 3 seasons were awesome.  I think Sutter got carried away with the popularity of the show & didn't give a damn about the story anymore, he was trying to wrap it up ASAP. At least, that's how it felt to me."
Sonsofanarchy,2tn0yb,Propanex,1 point,Sun Jan 25 19:32:39 2015 UTC,"I totally get how you feel, it did feel rushed.   I thought the first few episodes of season 5 were great, kind of like there was a new, bigger predator in the jungle and Jax had to figure out how to survive. Then it got sped up way to fast an Pope was gone.  I liked the ambiguity of Bobby hitting the open road where everyone thought he was going Nomad. It was kind of cool seeing SAMCRO have this or that, then it cuts to a scene with Bobby riding down the highway, with another person in his group."
Sonsofanarchy,2tn0yb,Propanex,1 point,Sun Jan 25 19:38:02 2015 UTC,"Man, I feel the same way, and we're a few episodes into season six, I think.  We starting finishing up 4, starting five this weekend, and I was like, wow we are in for a treat. Then five finished up and like you said felt rushed.   I looked up Knowles on wikipedia because I thought I was missing some background, and saw that she gets offed by Gemma at the end of the Season six, and now I don't even feel like finishing the series."
Sonsofanarchy,2tn0yb,Propanex,-1,Mon Jan 26 17:27:26 2015 UTC,Yep. That's right man .

Similar to how at one point in time Alvarez was one of clubs most hated enemies. Now they are in business together. I'm sure it bothers T.O. some still but he knows it was not something personal against him.

I mean---what the heck is the dog doing on the bike? And if Kozik had to transport the dog somewhere via bike, why would he be driving fast enough for it to die if it fell?  If Missy was killed by Kozik and a motorcylce, it would make more sense if he'd simply run over the animal than if he'd crashed with her as a passenger."

Sonsofanarchy,2tgg3i,gizmatic,5,Sat Jan 24 02:05:58 2015 UTC,"That's what it looked like to me.  I thought somehow Tig and Kozik both wanted to keep the dog and fought over it, because of how Kozik said he loved her too."

I will tell you the search function (located below Bobby's picture on the side bar over --------------> ) as a whole site wide is a major bone of contention for many and sucks donkey balls.  You might want to hit up another moderator in a PM named /u/hero0fwar as he has a TON of reddit and Clubhouse experience and if he is available might be able to help you out.

Sonsofanarchy,2tfqz8,PhoneySoprano,46,Fri Jan 23 20:03:21 2015 UTC,Stahls by Opie
Sonsofanarchy,2tfqz8,omgu8mynewt,16,Fri Jan 23 20:38:37 2015 UTC,My favorite thing about Stahl's death was how she cried like a little bitch begging for her life when she realized she was already dead. So satisfying.
Sonsofanarchy,2tfqz8,wbohn1,2,Fri Jan 23 23:09:02 2015 UTC,It was such dichotomy.  She was a true coward IMO.  She would act so badass when she had guns and backup; but when the tables were turned she couldn't take her fate in a way that befit her position.  Extremely satisfying just to see her go.
Sonsofanarchy,2tfqz8,redshoewearer,2,Sat Jan 24 21:35:33 2015 UTC,That's what I immediately thought of.  It was so satisfying to see her die the same way Donna did.
Sonsofanarchy,2tfqz8,SpacedAlien,23,Fri Jan 23 22:31:08 2015 UTC,"I liked Venus' mother's death but....  Definitely Jimmy O. Sweet justice and Chibs being Chibs. Plus death to that God awful accent, yeah?"
Sonsofanarchy,2tfqz8,justmighthaveto,13,Fri Jan 23 21:47:28 2015 UTC,I liked Clay's death quite a bit.

Sonsofanarchy,2tfqz8,bobbyLapointe,10,Sat Jan 24 05:08:40 2015 UTC,I loved Opie's death as much as I hated watching this moment. For me this is the strongest scene in the whole serie.
Sonsofanarchy,2tfqz8,Badger_Silverado,3,Sat Jan 24 00:37:46 2015 UTC,I loved this moment and thought it was the best until the scene of Jax and Juice in the meeting room at the jail. The acting between Juice and Jax was so emotional and raw that it was sublime.
Sonsofanarchy,2tfqz8,goodinthehood92,16,Sun Jan 25 09:23:33 2015 UTC,Venus's mother. Hands down.
Sonsofanarchy,2tfqz8,annabanana74,5,Fri Jan 23 21:39:23 2015 UTC,"Yep, because  when I was watched it , it came out of nowhere-- looking back, the cocking of Jax's head makes it obvious that shit's about to go down..."
Sonsofanarchy,2tfqz8,goodinthehood92,1 point,Fri Jan 23 21:45:59 2015 UTC,You're absolutely right about his head movement. Just youtubed it(and watched 3 times because it was great).
Sonsofanarchy,2tfqz8,Horse625,17,Fri Jan 23 22:00:21 2015 UTC,"Gemma.  Bitch caused way too much bullshit throughout the series, I'm surprised she survived as long as she did."
Sonsofanarchy,2tfqz8,Horse625,5,Fri Jan 23 23:44:19 2015 UTC,Man that was some bullshit. She should've been ousted to the whole club face to face and then been tortured or at the least killed how Tara was. How the fuck she got off so clean is beyond me.
Sonsofanarchy,2tfqz8,BasketeerOverHere,14,Sat Jan 24 00:36:43 2015 UTC,"I feel like being murdered by her own son, at her father's house, after watching her only friend left in the world die was pretty harsh already."

Sonsofanarchy,2tfqz8,Senor_Taco29,6,Sat Jan 24 02:44:42 2015 UTC,"Donna's death, being the first main~ish character to die, was most shocking to me and was undoubtedly one of the most emotional ones, with a list of reasons that go on and on. She was 100% innocent, she was the primary caregiver of two children who will now grow up being raised into a hard life, and it was at the hands of someone who considers her to be family. It also had a lot of buildup, as it took several episodes to put the pieces into place to bring Tig and Clay to that point, so we just watched all the pieces slowly fall into place, only for the plan to take a sharp left turn with a shocking twist."

Sonsofanarchy,2tfqz8,Horse625,3,Sat Jan 24 00:34:27 2015 UTC,Opie. That's all.
Sonsofanarchy,2tfqz8,Civil718,5,Sun Jan 25 14:02:36 2015 UTC,"Tara's. Personal preference, but I didn't like her pretty much the entire run of the show and was glad she died. I know Gemma was in the thick of all the shit but if it wasn't for Jax trying so hard to make things easier on Tara half of the bad things wouldn't have happened. Plus it was such a brutal death it was one of the most exciting to watch. The death that made me upset the most was probably Bobby."
Sonsofanarchy,2tfqz8,Horse625,3,Sat Jan 24 02:10:44 2015 UTC,"I totally cheered.  After all that shit with the fake pregnancy, playing Jax like that...  She deserved what she got."

Sonsofanarchy,2tfqz8,Budvar123,2,Sat Jan 24 05:35:22 2015 UTC,Opies for sure.
Sonsofanarchy,2tfqz8,AODonnell95,2,Sat Jan 24 00:40:01 2015 UTC,"Juice was/is my favourite character, and personally I think he went out like a champ."
Sonsofanarchy,2tfqz8,paulieman89,1 point,Sat Jan 24 22:00:48 2015 UTC,Donna's because it gave good story telling
Sonsofanarchy,2tfqz8,MojoLoko,1 point,Sat Jan 24 19:30:21 2015 UTC,"Stahl, Jimmy & Toric's were the most satisfying.   Opies could be the best death scene in the history of television. No other death on film or tv has ever come close to the emotions I felt watching Opie die.   The build up. The brutality. The brothers watching it happen and being helpless. Jax telling the guard he'll find and kill him. Then the wake at the club house to finish it off the next episode."
Sonsofanarchy,2tfqz8,occipudding,1 point,Sun Jan 25 02:01:42 2015 UTC,Lee Toric for me. The fact that Otto ended it in the most gruesome manner possible just made it even sweeter.

Sonsofanarchy,2tcs6n,adamtaylor4815,66,Fri Jan 23 01:25:41 2015 UTC,That's because you aren't changing them out every hour on the hour.  Jax changed his shoes every hour and had a team of illegals whose sole purpose within the US was to keep his shoes sparkling white.

Sonsofanarchy,2tenh1,Trooper_Super,1 point,Fri Jan 23 16:08:53 2015 UTC,"When prospecting, you first wear the prospect patch on the bottom.   Later, they give you the reaper patch, but you still aren't fully patched because you don't have the top rocker.   They literally say that T.O. should get the reaper, but that doesn't mean he is no longer a prospect. Hence the patch."

Sonsofanarchy,2tenh1,Adamadtr,7,Fri Jan 23 18:10:21 2015 UTC,"That's because he is wrong. When Rat-Boy got patched in he only had the bottom Prospect rocker. At the end when T.O. got patched in they made him a full member immediately. Tig and Chibbs go on to say that for as much as he has done for the club and that he lead the Grim Bastards for a decade he shouldn't have to prospect. Jax agrees and says he should be a full patch. He does, however, have to wait a year to be an officer.   All that said ... I have no idea why in the finale they had a kutte with the Reaper and a prospect rocker. It has never been shown in the show before."
Sonsofanarchy,2tenh1,GeauxOU,1 point,Fri Jan 23 19:07:26 2015 UTC,My theory is he'll have the Prospect rocker for a year to signify he can't hold office. After the year he'll get the Cali rocker. Just a theory though.

Sonsofanarchy,2tenh1,mleestokley,2,Fri Jan 23 23:41:42 2015 UTC,"All the top rocker bottom rocker stuff is rhetoric. Some clubs do some things different, but the concept is the same. You are a hang around, either by your choice, the club's invitation, or both depending on the club. Then you are a prospect or probate. The terminology here differs between clubs. I know of clubs that don't have prospects, just probates, and they wear a patch stating so. The club I am in has a hang around phase which is exactly what it sounds like, a prospect stage, where we wear a blank vest and do some tasks for the club, but are really guests checking out the club. After that, after a vote of approval, we are elevated to probate. We wear certain patches and rockers on our vest but not our patch. Like I said, every club is different. The last step is to earn your patch (in my club). Terminology, decoration, levels, everything varies and differs by club, they all have their own bylaws. SOA (as in the club, not the show) is loosely based on HAMC, The Mayans represent Mongols MC, one niners are bloods and crips (blue + red = purple) etc. The show hires 81's as extras, actors, and consultants. They were known to be pretty critical on matters of MC protocol and uniforms up until that point and I do not have an answer for the reaper (the patch being the most important and sacred item a member will ever hold) hanging above a prospect rocker. My only idea was an oversight or something we missed in an out take. What he should have had, according to what bylaws we can gather from watching, was a bottom rocker (prospect). When they decided to patch him straight in, he should have received full colors.  Source: patch holding member of real MC, but not 1%, but know 1%ers and protocol."
Sonsofanarchy,2tenh1,LordDVanity,1 point,Fri Jan 23 23:46:09 2015 UTC,Perhaps they forgot to take it off?
Sonsofanarchy,2tenh1,some_dunkaroos,1 point,Sat Jan 24 00:28:49 2015 UTC,"I imagine that they had a new prospect cut handy for bringing him in. As we see, they don't vote on TO skipping the prospect phase until right before they give him his cut.  Afterward they would give him his full patch and rockers since they voted to skip prospect, and he would stitch them on himself. As we see different characters stitching their patches on throughout the series, I imagine they consider it important to stitch on your own patches."

Sonsofanarchy,2tcrkr,PhoneySoprano,3,Fri Jan 23 01:20:37 2015 UTC,"It wrapped itself up naturally, but what the hell happened to Gemma ratting out Tara? That whole storyline was never spoken of again after the lawyer found out.  And Jax giving Tig to Marks. Marks doesn't kill him even though Jax was expecting him too the writers go on with his ""I love you brother"" story like he never sold him out."
Sonsofanarchy,2tcrkr,Imapony,1 point,Sat Jan 24 03:16:21 2015 UTC,"It was later revealed that it was toric that got Tara arrested, not Gemma."
Sonsofanarchy,2tcrkr,Mysterion07,1 point,Mon Jan 26 00:02:36 2015 UTC,"Toric was just using her in jail as leverage, he entered the scene well after she was arrested and while he had favors to pull in the prison, there was nothing he could do to actually get her arrested.  The lawyer showed up at TM frantically looking for Jax, Gemma intercepted her and the lawyer told her it had been revealed she was the rat, and gemma threatened to kill her."
Sonsofanarchy,2tcrkr,Imapony,1 point,Mon Jan 26 00:17:17 2015 UTC,"Scene between Toric and Tara when she is in prison goes as follows. Toric - ""How are your accommodations?"" Tara - ""confined..."" Toric - ""I'm sorry, I wanted to give you a few days to adjust before we spoke."" Tara - ""This was you...""  (Toric then nods, confirming he was behind her getting arrested.) Tara - ""how?"" Toric- ""by focusing the department of justice on the facts.  Pointed out your martial connection to the club, the Rico case, the documents your forged to access Otto.  Did you think they woukdn't find those?""  Seems pretty clear Toric, not Gemma, got Tara arrested."
Sonsofanarchy,2tcrkr,Mysterion07,1 point,Mon Jan 26 01:34:55 2015 UTC,"That was for the initial case against her which wasn't expected to amount to much. The whole thing revolved around whether Tara was complicit in the murder and deliberately helped Otto. There was no proof of that until Gemma said she'd testify that Tara knew what Otto was going to do and was a part of it.  The initial investigation against her may have been started by Toric, but the arrest, jail, and impending life sentence were all because of Gemmas fake statement."
Sonsofanarchy,2tcrkr,Imapony,1 point,Mon Jan 26 01:44:18 2015 UTC,"Conversation between GEMMA and Tara in the kitchen at Jax's house after she gets out.  Gemma - ""I'm not the one that turned you in."" Tara - ""I know.""  Tara only mentioned anything about Gemma to her lawyer before she met with Toric.    Watch the episodes again, Gemma only tried to scare her into staying.  That was the point of having Gemma threaten her in the first place, to make the viewer assume the obvious.   Assume the obvious until Toric straight up admits he got her arrested."
Sonsofanarchy,2tcrkr,Mysterion07,1 point,Mon Jan 26 01:49:49 2015 UTC,"Tara played along with Gemma to avoid more conflict. There was the initial investigation which Toric was involved with and Tara was sticking to her story that she was just bringing a prisoner something sentimental and had no idea what he would do with it. At that point her ties to the club were already known, but the prosecution had no evidence that she was complicit.  Then after Gemma's threat Tara gets arrested. Later the lawyer keeps saying that whatever new evidence they used to have Tara arrested is being kept secret. After it's made legally public, the lawyer goes to TM to tell Jax but Gemma gets to her first, and makes it clear that she's the rat and she will kill the lawyer if she ever tells anyone. Tara doesn't have to say anything to the lawyer about her suspicions, the defense has a legal right to know who the accusers are.  Toric has nothing to testify to for tara to get arrested for accomplice to murder."

Sonsofanarchy,2tcrkr,Mysterion07,0,Mon Jan 26 02:09:32 2015 UTC,"I have very recently, sounds like you need to.  Timeline of events:  Tara is under investigation for her role in what Otto did. ""Pointed out your martial connection to the club, the Rico case, the documents your forged to access Otto"" is already known at this point by the investigators. Tara is free to walk around because there is no evidence to say she was an accessory.  THEN she is arrested after some mysterious evidence against her claiming she IS an accessory and knew what Otto was going to do. Toric is incapable of making a testimony like that, and Gemma ADMITS to the lawyer that she was the rat and she will KILL the lawyer if she says anything. Maybe you need to watch that scene again.  As for Gemma saying she didn't do it? Yeah, she never lies."

""Everybody seems to want Ethan Zobelle back at some point -- is that in the works for the new season in any capacity? KS: My feeling on a character like Zobelle is I know it would be very satisfying in terms of the fans, but in my mind, the guys like Zobelle get away, and that was kind of the point of it.

She might say something.  Stahl said that she would hold the Irish guy that Jax handed over to her (Luke?) as a terrorist, without the ability to communicate with the IRA.

Sonsofanarchy,2t3keq,Bob_Swarleymann,33,Tue Jan 20 22:05:30 2015 UTC,"This does NOT merit a SPOILER tag. It's info from Season 2.  However, to the point of discussion, I know what you mean. But I think that when you are as embroiled in that culture as Opie and Jax were--then they think and feel differently about it. Even when he came back to the table after talking to Stahl he said, ""This club killed my wife."" He didn't say ""Tig, you killed my wife."" he didn't say ""Clay, how could you order a hit on me/my wife?""  He said: ""This club killed my wife."" It was like he felt the victim of a loop-hole in the law, than anything else. Almost like people who wind up petitioning to change a law after they get screwed by the legal gap that let it happen. (Think: Stand Your Ground)  He and Jax grew up not just around that, but embroiled in that life style and with that gang-mentality, they were raised to believe and feel that SAMCRO is first and foremost in life. Of course they knew that the penalty for betrayal was death. It was an accepted fact and something that they were, apparently 100% okay with.  I would not have ever joined that club knowing what the rules were. Never. SAMCRO, specifically, was almost like a cult, not a club. We didn't see enough of the SOA culture as a whole for me to say the entire organization was that way--in fact most of the other SONS we meet outside of SAMCRO are pretty shady bastards--but SAMCRO members were mostly devote to the chapters vision. Its like SAMCRO attracted the true ""believers"" and vetted members who were hypocrits while the other charters didn't care so much, so long as you made the initial cut and paid your dues on time.  The fact is, Opie and all of the guys viewed SAMCRO as an entity of its own, Clay and Tig were operating by SAMCRO laws. They had reason to believe that Opie was a rat, and they executed the MC law based on what they thought that they knew. Remember, Jax himself said that if Opie turned out to be a rat then he would kill him himself. Tig just didn't think that Jax would ever be able to really hurt Opie so he said he'd do it. Jax didn't say: ""If Opie is really a rat, we need to kick him out of the club."" He said he'd kill him. Jax had to have known that Piney would NEVER vote for his son to be killed by MC-law, so it would have been Jax, Tig and Clay plotting the hit on Opie without taking it to the table--where they would never get a unanimous vote.  Even when Stahl had him in custody, Opie knew what she was trying to do and thats why he was so desperate to tell the club what happened. The problem is that Stahl out-witted him by putting wires on him, feeding his accounts and such. She played SAMCRO like a fiddle and Tig and Clay danced accordingly  Opie was more depressed about the loss of Donna than enraged. Opie wasn't a hyper-passionate person. From what I've been able to tell, Opie couldn't or didn't manifest his feelings outwardly, he kept things inside and it effected his actions.  Opie imploded after Donna, he couldn't quite get back to what he used to be. Opie tore the rest of his life down himself--he checked out on his kids, sabotaged his relationship with Lyla, threw himself into life-threatening danger a bunch of times, and then volunteered himself to go to jail with Chibs, Tig and Jax when he knew very well that it was a death trap in the first place. He allowed his grief and guilt to drag him down.  Piney was pissed, but he too got over it. Rather quickly, he always seemed more pissed that 1) Clay had doubted Opies integrity enough to try and kill him 2) He had to do crap for his grandkids. Honestly, you don't see Piney bemoaning the loss of Donna too much.  I edited this post to remove some spoilerish things."

Sonsofanarchy,2t3keq,CSMom74,2,Wed Jan 21 15:48:03 2015 UTC,"If SAMCRO believed, cult-like, in SAMCRO law, then how come no one had a problem with Clay ordering a hit on Opie without having a Mayhem vote?"
Sonsofanarchy,2t3keq,JoeShmoe99,1 point,Wed Jan 21 14:47:51 2015 UTC,"The only ones who ""found out"" that truth was Bobby and Opie, Jax had sent Juice to call Tara so Juice didn't hear it, so he couldn't have told Chibs, Sack or Happy.  Opie squashed that truth from spreading. He didn't want everyone finding out his business, because no good would come from it for him or the club. He wasn't planning on leaving SAMCRO, and he didn't need every-ones silent judgement about what that said about him as a person.  He told them to kill that secret in that room, right then. The only ones present when he said that were: Clay, Tig, Jax, Bobby and Opie himself. Thats why Piney burst in and tried to kill Clay, he didn't know that Opie was keeping it silent."
Sonsofanarchy,2t3keq,gizmatic,1 point,Wed Jan 21 16:03:17 2015 UTC,"I get all that, but it goes against the grain of SAMCRO believing in SAMCRO law above all.  I could understand Opie letting it go if it was a club-sanctioned hit, but instead it was just Clay being paranoid."

Sonsofanarchy,2t3keq,besyuziki,1 point,Thu Jan 22 14:19:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah this is the best thing I've read on here.   I agree with everything you said but I still feel like the whole thing went away too easily. I'd have played it out with Opie's rage against the club for a episode or two more. It is of course due to the fact that he was more of a sidekick back then. Had it happened to Tara it would have been different - but that would also have been down to the difference between Ope and Jax. So yeah, I don't really disagree with anything you wrote but I still feel like it was a bit unrealistic."
Sonsofanarchy,2t3keq,gizmatic,2,Wed Jan 21 10:16:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it did go away a little bit too easily.Even at the beginning when they were killing that Mayan, Opie told Jax that if it had been Tara Jax would be ripping his fingers off one by one, because Jax and the others were trying to rush him when he wanted a confession.  I guess it helped that Opie and Donna weren't very close since he'd been inside for 5 years and was really struggling to come back to domestic life, and they were fighting, his kids were estranged to him. But mostly, Opie blamed Opie for Donnas death.   I think most of Opies grief manifested itself mostly as guilt. If he'd kept his word to Donna to stay out of SAMCROs criminal activities, then Donna wouldn't have been killed. Period. Of course, if they'd have included that in the show we wouldn't have to speculate on Reddit about what Opie was thinking or feeling.  Opie broke his promise/lied to his wife, and then indirectly and inadvertently got her killed. (He shouldn't have volunteered to do the hit on Hefner. He knew he wasn't ready.)  I guess that Opie had began to heal about Donnas death by the time that he found out the truth from Tig and really he was just exhausted from everything. It was weird, Opie had a family but he seemed to feel as Juice did. That he had nothing but the Club. Opie said his dad was dead without the club, but the same was true for him.  The guys are just suckers for SAMCRO, I guess. Even if Opie might have had 2nd thoughts about forgiveness, remember Piney burst in and tried to kill Clay. Opie had to let it go, or it would have just gotten his father killed. Of course, none of that mattered because Piney met his end brutally at Clays hand anyway, but at the moment, NONE of them could have foreseen that."
Sonsofanarchy,2t3keq,youmeanddougie,2,Wed Jan 21 14:37:42 2015 UTC,"I always took Opie's reaction as him blaming himself for Donna's death.    Not that I agree with his thinking, but I always assumed because he was one foot in, one foot out....it caused the Club to not trust him completely...which caused the events that lead to Donnas death.    Financial strain -> Stahl targeting Opie's family -> Clay having to make the decision to take him out -> Opie switching vehicles with Donna -> Tig killing Donna  Opie's behavior after that suggested he was trying to make up for his mistakes by throwing himself fully into the club.    But I agree with everything else everyone said in this too"

Sonsofanarchy,2t2mkc,stacyo72,4,Wed Jan 21 02:20:38 2015 UTC,Fun fact: Sutter insisted that in the scene where Clay slices the balls off that the balls be seen falling on to the ground in order to get the full affect early in the series to show just how ruthless the MC is and to show the divide between Clay and Jax. It took several days of negotiating between he and FX just to get the network to show the brief shot of the balls laying on the ground.
Sonsofanarchy,2t2mkc,stacyo72,1 point,Wed Jan 21 02:44:31 2015 UTC,"Interesting. I think that scene also showed a split between the younger generation (Jax and Half-Sack) and the older guys (Bobby, Tig, and Clay). Also, that must have been difficult for Half-Sack to watch."

Sonsofanarchy,2t2mkc,Alwaysthequiet1,4,Wed Jan 21 02:58:06 2015 UTC,"I couldn't watch at the same time as everyone else, but my thoughts are:   Bobby was shown to be ruthless, despite his Jackie Onassis sunglasses. It was kind of cool how in the early episodes, various club members were absent from the episode. It helped develop the main characters more, and showed how these guys had somewhat unpredictable lives. It reminds me of why we liked Jax, like when he told Gemma not to call Wendy a junkie and then took Wendy to see Abel. It reminds me of why we liked Clay, standing up for the town even if he had ulterior motives."

Sonsofanarchy,2t3rct,nucleargloom,10,Tue Jan 20 22:52:46 2015 UTC,"Kurt Sutter will not confirm her meaning, or who she truly is but has gone on record saying he enjoys her ""supernatural presence"". He also said he'd rather the viewer have their own view on who she is.  There are theories that she is god, theories that she is a reaper, theories that she is the spirit of John Teller but ultimately it is up to you. I don't think Kurt will confirm who she is, he seems to like the idea that we will never know for sure.  Personally I think she is an angel of death, she plays her part in the deaths caused by Jax and ultimately Jax himself."

Sonsofanarchy,2t3rct,yru1,2,Wed Jan 21 21:08:30 2015 UTC,Everyone just remembers her as some homeless lady she is Brookes (rat boys girls) mother. She died in the car accident that JT died in.  As far as her meaning after that is open to the viewer.
Sonsofanarchy,2t3rct,Horse625,3,Wed Feb 4 11:22:07 2015 UTC,She's a reaper.  Not everyone can see her.  Only those about to be involved in a death can see her.

Sonsofanarchy,2t3rct,CaptainRandus,1 point,Wed Jan 21 08:05:33 2015 UTC,"Since she gave Jax the blanket and he killed August immediately after that then the logical conclusion seems to be that she's the Grim Reaper but we had another idea. Immediately after Jax sees her for the final time, the camera closes in on the bread and wine left behind. Where else do you see bread and wine represented? The body and blood of Christ. Since Jax went out the way he did (arms out, invoking a crucifix), was he representing Christ, dying for the sins of the club?"
Sonsofanarchy,2t3rct,DrOrinScrivelloDDS,1 point,Wed Jan 21 18:41:15 2015 UTC,Oh yeah. I wondered why the bread and drink were so important to show on the episode. I wasn't sure if she was the reaper because the way Jax wore the blanket. Like why would he be the reaper if the reapers already right there.
Sonsofanarchy,2szjma,gizmatic,29,Mon Jan 19 22:56:29 2015 UTC,Tig without a doubt. I'd say Jax went the other direction if anything

Sonsofanarchy,2szjma,sarGasm37Bro,12,Tue Jan 20 19:17:19 2015 UTC,"Tig. For the better. I think that by the end of the show, he was able to finally see what "" the life"", does to a person, and more importantly, their relationships. The last shot of him isn't with the other club members, but rather, with Venus, slumped down, and not wearing his club colors."
Sonsofanarchy,2szjma,annabanana74,10,Tue Jan 20 20:28:46 2015 UTC,Juice and Jax were the 2 that grew the most  J&J
Sonsofanarchy,2szjma,Gus_Griswald,4,Tue Jan 20 01:33:15 2015 UTC,How do you feel that juice grew? I'm not saying you're wrong but I guess I don't see much growth
Sonsofanarchy,2szjma,soupastar,3,Tue Jan 20 17:42:18 2015 UTC,"Because Juice started out as almost comic relief, barely having any important matters with the club until Roosevelt blackmailed him. During that time he was put into a situation someone as.... ""immature"" as him couldn't handle. He made the wrong decisions and didn't fully understand the weight of his decisions. He eventually went on to admit to Nero that he was a coward. He had realised how his decisions had panned out and what they defined him as. In his final scenes he seemed at peace. And he was not the same Juice we had met in season one. He, in my opinion, did the most growing."
Sonsofanarchy,2szjma,ColmM36,6,Wed Jan 21 21:38:53 2015 UTC,"I would say Chibs. He's like the stoic insightful voice of reason in the last few seasons, but in the first few episodes I've watched recently he seems like a kid, loud and a little obnoxious."

Sonsofanarchy,2szjma,mistere676,7,Tue Jan 20 03:17:23 2015 UTC,"I would have to say Jax, at the start of the first season he is so young and against violence, through the series he becomes Clay or worse and does everything with violence.  Tig does the most growing towards the audience as you go from hating him in the end of season 1 to actually being happy he's still alive after the crazy ride."

Sonsofanarchy,2szjma,olderstillnew,7,Tue Jan 20 22:06:37 2015 UTC,"Tig started out as the least serious (and in my opinion, also the least likable) of any of them. As the show progressed, he got a lot more mature and we got to see him on a much deeper level. The scene with his daughter was painful, and his conversation with Venus last season was incredibly impressive."
Sonsofanarchy,2szjma,Bob_Swarleymann,3,Mon Jan 19 23:18:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah, im almost finished rewatching season 2. The difference between Tig that season with Donna and Season 7 is night and day. Jax was pretty cool back then, he grew up in the opposite way of Tig."
Sonsofanarchy,2szjma,olderstillnew,2,Tue Jan 20 01:37:34 2015 UTC,Absolutely agree.
Sonsofanarchy,2szjma,xlxcx,3,Tue Jan 20 21:49:46 2015 UTC,I think maybe Tig or Chibs.
Sonsofanarchy,2szjma,besyuziki,4,Tue Jan 20 15:28:32 2015 UTC,Chibs and Tig.
Sonsofanarchy,2szjma,Mayhem5100,4,Mon Jan 19 23:23:08 2015 UTC,"Without a doubt Jax. Just look at him in season 1 and now . With all the shit that happened in all of the seasons. Abel,Tara,Opie. In season 1 he was just a kid,but i think the real change happened in season 5 episode 3. From that point on the darkness consumed him. And Taras death made it even worse."
Sonsofanarchy,2szjma,VinniVilla,1 point,Mon Jan 19 23:37:05 2015 UTC,"Jax did grow a lot, for some time on a good direction, trying to take the club out of guns and trying to go legit, but after Tara's death he lost all of that, and went on a total different and dark way. But the character that grew the most was without a doubt Wendy, on the begining she was just a junkie that almost killed her son, but in the last season, she was a great mother, no wonder why Jax let her sons with her"

Sonsofanarchy,2swpnb,JonnyZero,11,Mon Jan 19 05:45:48 2015 UTC,"I have! I like it a lot! It's a worker placement/management game, primarily. It's absolutely worth a buy, my gaming group loves it, and none of them have seen SoA. As a fan of the IP, and of board games, I have to say it does a really good job paying homage to the IP while producing a game with high replay value.  There are two game modes, unleaded and high octane. In unleaded, the clubs/gangs are all the same. in high octane, they all hae different starting resources and special rules.  If you want more info, feel free to check out http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/156091/sons-anarchy-men-mayhem   The game is great with 3 or 4 players, and scales appropriately with either.  As a fan, the only thing that bugs me is that the pieces are the same sculpts for all the factions, which leaves the niners and the lin syndicate with dudes on bikes. It's kind of nitpicky, though, and I really can't recommend the game enough. I think it's absolutely worth the $50 MSRP."

It's pretty obvious that Kurt Sutter had a good idea of what the show would be in the very beginning and struggled to make things as interesting as the series drew to a close.

After season 4 I think Kurt starts to lose his vision for the show or loses his love for it or possibly is just pissed off with not getting any awards so just turns it into a gore fest for the ratings. He truly loses out on so many great plot points that it frustrates me, can't go any more in depth because of spoilers but you'll probably get what I mean by the end of your watch through."

Sonsofanarchy,2svuew,0netwothree,3,Fri Jan 23 18:21:06 2015 UTC,"As everyone else has already stated, it is most certainly worth the ride. However do keep in mind that (again, as everyone else stated) the ""clubhouse rules"" state that the only season that still requires a spoiler tag is the most recent (and final) season - Season 7. Any and all other seasons will be discussed freely, so if you visit the sub often, you are bound to run into spoilers, it's practically a given.   That being said, we also have discussion threads for each episode from Season 4 Episode 1 continuing on all the way to Season 7 episode 13 (the finale of the show). You can find those in the side bar. Feel free to check those out while you're watching.   Addendum: You've only just started watching. I wouldn't be so quick to judge characters just yet."
Sonsofanarchy,2svuew,madfiend,2,Mon Jan 19 06:11:09 2015 UTC,"Just echoing off /u/Alwaysthequiet1's sentiments it is beyond worth the ride, however Clubhouse rules which I highly encourage you to read here, state that no spoiler tags for post titles or in the post comments are required for any seasons but the final season; season 7.  As MODs we love to drive traffic here to the Clubhouse, we welcome you with open arms and are very happy you are here; but if you are just starting out there is no way possible, to use SoA terminology, being a ""hang-around"" you will not not have things spoiled for you. Just a friendly heads up as no one here can tell you what to do; by all means stay just please have a concrete understanding from the get go there are daily spoilers for seasons 1-6 in post titles.
