That's the crux of the matter, at the moment french is the language everyone agrees to speak but census data suggest that native french or native dutch are allready in the minority with over 30 other native language ranging from swahili to Arabic, Farsi, English, German, etc. And that's from data from my university class of 2008 regarding demographics in Brussels."
belgium,3e1leg,Lord_Ciar,5,Tue Jul 21 20:35:49 2015 UTC,"Flemish people are pretty strong in settling flemish schools if you ask me. A lot of them, quite good quality. But considering the diversity nowadays in Brussels, it is still a tough fight if the objective is to flemishize Brussels."
belgium,3e1leg,Bassura,3,Tue Jul 21 12:28:57 2015 UTC,It would be relatively if we look at how long it took to switch from a Dutchspeaking to a Francophone one especially considering it's pretty much surrounded by Flanders. Of course it would still take a long time.  What you're forgetting though is that we can't justify what happened back then today. We can't in a relatively short timeframe cut off support for the French language and thus pretty much enforce bilingualism and eventually monolingualism. We can't have housing-prices jack up and not consider it a problem so mostly only Flemish can come live there with the workers mobility and public transport we have today.  Forever is not a word that fits here in any way but still Brussels will stay majority Francophone for a long time. Let's say Brussels would go with Flanders if it ever were to become independent or join the Netherlands...The UF can go suck a dick but I don't think we should try to force the language out. That might change on it's own very slowly though. Hell it might even become a real mess of languages with the current growth of English & Arab languages & then some Dutch thrown in.

I even remember a neighbor of mine (Sint Jans Molenbeek) saying that 'us youth) can't even speak the Brussels dialect anymore. When we asked him how it sounded he just started talking Flemish with a heavy dialect and little to none French influences. Brussels is a Crimea story, simply due to the influx of Walloons, Walloons are now almost considering it rightfully theirs. :v"

belgium,3dydd2,Some_Random_Guy_1138,3,Mon Jul 20 19:45:11 2015 UTC,Awesome.   Just a photography-noob question: How does one take those night sky shots? A long exposure time alone doesn't work for me because the stars become streaks.
belgium,3dydd2,Aeri73,5,Mon Jul 20 16:07:07 2015 UTC,"It's actually quit some work:   Use the 500-rule: 500 / focal lenght = maximum light before stars start to 'trail'. For example: 500 / 10 mm = 50 seconds exposure. (make it 40sec to be sure) Find the milkyway. There are nice apps to locate the milkyway. For Android you can use Google Sky Maps. You capture the most stars there. Use the function ""Long exposure noise reduction"", most of the current DSLR camera's have this.  Find out the hyperfocal distance of your lens (there is also an app for that) and use a flashlight to focus on something within this hyperfocal distance. After focus, switch the lens to manual-focus and use a shutter release cable to make the photo. Use Photoshop raw converter to lighten up the dark sky a bit so the stars come out nice!   Enjoy!"
belgium,3dydd2,Aeri73,2,Mon Jul 20 19:12:55 2015 UTC,"some camera's aren't really ok with long exp. noise reduction, you can't shoot for the same time the shutterspeed  was after due to it processing the shot"

belgium,3dydd2,Detective_Fallacy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:06:29 2015 UTC,I've always thought that it was the 600-rule? Also make sure to multiply your focal length by your camera's crop-factor.  E.g. 10mm on say Nikon D300 (has 1.5x crop-factor) = 600 / (10*1.5) = 40 seconds.  Question: what f-stop did/do you use?
belgium,3dydd2,Tajil,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:53:36 2015 UTC,"Google shows hits on both the 500 and 600 rule :-), personally I would go for the 500 rule. To long exposure will make the stars blurry (an very short trailing)   You are right about the crop-factor. My Canon EOS 60D is fullframe, therefore I forgot about that.   Question: what f-stop did/do you use? F3.5"
belgium,3dydd2,SHFT101,3,Tue Jul 21 08:06:04 2015 UTC,"Not OP, but I found that going with the largest aperture you can and ramping up the ISO can do the trick. With higher ISO you get more noise however, so results may vary depending on the quality of your sensor."

Been looking into notebooks again because I love to game from the couch but anything decent and capable is running into the 1,2k+ euro...  Think I want a desktop again, way cheaper and way upgradable in the future. Could even connect a wireless controller, hook it up to the TV and use it as a console replacement (was also thinking about the Xbone for a while).  But it's been a while since I've built a PC and I'm not really up to date anymore with what's out there. After some research this weekend I came up with This build right here. Topic got no responses so far though, anyone around here who knows his way around more and can give his opinion?  *Edit: Or I just bite the bullet, bump the budget up to 1000 and be settled for sure with a GTX 970 like in This month's Tweakers build.  Edit Edit: 900 euro build with GTX 970"
belgium,3dwuqd,Matvalicious,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:02:11 2015 UTC,"I've been doubting about that as well. Either a GTX 960 or a 970 (but the budget didn't allow for a 970 in this build). From my understanding ATI offers more bang for the buck at this time, but an nvidia alternative is definitely an option because I tend to lean towards nvidia more anyway."

I  mean, everywhere you look you see Dutch terribly translated from French like ""opportuniteit"" instead of ""buitenkans"" and, this weekend, I actually saw a sign with ""Ik weet hoe u te plezieren!"".   I mean, that's obviously translated from ""je sais comment vous rendre heureux"" or something - innocent enough in French, but in Dutch it sounds like they're volunteering to fondle my balls and suck my dick.   Similarly, I saw a sign that said ""Ontdek onze promoties momenteel beschikbaar!"", probably a translation of something like ""D√©couvrez nos promos actuellement disponibles!"", but literally translated like that it sounds STUPID.  This madness has to stop. Surely, SOMEONE at Carrefour knows how to use Dutch without sounding like a hung-over Di Rupo. What the hell are they thinking printing and distributing signs like that to their Flemish stores? Why the hell doesn't s a Flemish store manager SAY anything?  I swear to god, I'm 95% there to just switch over to Delhaize or something so I don't have to see Carrefour rape Dutch every fucking week."
belgium,3dwuqd,elbekko,6,Mon Jul 20 13:10:10 2015 UTC,"Where I live no-one in the god damn carrefour can speak a single word of dutch, although it's located in Flanders. You don't need to be perfectly bi-langual to work in retail, but a simple greeting and basic counting is already enough to handle most customers just fine. That can't be too hard to learn can it? And what kind of school have you been to if you can't even do these basic things?
