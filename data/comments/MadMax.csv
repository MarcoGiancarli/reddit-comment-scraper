It's already up on various storefronts, like Neatoshop, RedBubble, Teepublic and Design by Humans.   BUT FIRST! I need a general vote - it was pointed out that ""the"" was missing in the ""I died historic on fury road"". I left it out because it looked better size-wise, but I understand that it might sound a bit annoying to us fans. It's an easy fix, do y'all want me to change it up?"
MadMax,3e04b4,The_Somnambulist,4,Tue Jul 21 09:34:25 2015 UTC,"I think it would be better sounding wise. Without the ""the"" it sounds weird. At least for me"

MadMax,3dxnqj,ZiGraves,4,Mon Jul 20 11:34:06 2015 UTC,"Thoughts (in order of rotation)   That is one tattooed Fragile! I like that Toast is grabbing Max's arm, just like she did in the movie!  NICE detail on that backpack Max is wearing! In fact his whole costume is pretty great. The only thing missing is the dirt but that'll take care of itself eventually! Nux loading Max's gun while Capable tries to stop him, again, someone clearly saw the movie!  Furiosa looks miffed. She's like, ""oh great, this shit again."" It's pretty funny. Angharad is jerking everyone's chain! There's a metaphor in there somewhere! And again, good detail from the movie.  Dressing up as the War Rig... needs more skulls, but that's a clever idea! And I like that the rig is a woman. It makes sense that it would be. Especially later, when Max attempts to steal her and she's like, nuh uh, that is not happening...    It's cool that you managed to put this group together and do this. Everybody looks great!"
MadMax,3dxnqj,IdiotsLantern,2,Mon Jul 20 22:11:24 2015 UTC,Someone made fan art in which the war rig is a dragon: http://sandara.deviantart.com/art/Dusk-537387605 Works surprisingly well. :-)

MadMax,3dwvmt,unanun,10,Mon Jul 20 05:08:12 2015 UTC,Its why he wasnt allowed to drive. If you notice he really wants to drive. Seems older than Nux but has a lower rank. He then gets put onto another drivers car after the tornado. STILL someones lancer. Then that driver get killed and he can finally drive ans quickly dies. No one even witnesses him.   Cause Slit is a dick.

MadMax,3dwvmt,WilWheatonsScrote,3,Tue Jul 21 10:58:35 2015 UTC,Possibly because Max kicked him in the face several times earlier.

MadMax,3dwom2,bpg609,8,Mon Jul 20 03:57:41 2015 UTC,The war boys inhale chrome/spray paint because of the effects of the propellant (rage/ euphoria). Nux needed Max's blood because Nux has a disease (possibly due to radiation or inbreeding).
MadMax,3dwom2,TR401,7,Mon Jul 20 04:02:13 2015 UTC,"I think most of the warboys have lukemia / throat cancer. I hypothesize it's from radioactive dust, although it doesn't explain why max doesn't have it. Probably from staying away from the citadel."

Looking now, I see Maximillian used at http://madmax.wikia.com/wiki/Max_Rockatansky, but it doesn't say where that info is from. Presumably a novelisation, or info in the script that didn't make it to screen, or some other source. Any ideas which?"
MadMax,3dv2zq,nemothorx,2,Mon Jul 20 00:40:40 2015 UTC,"As others have noted (and corrected me on), the Mad Max wiki gives his name as 'Maximillian'.   This was added to the wiki on this edit, back in 2013, with no citation.   I think it's a completely plausible name (despite my instinct for Maxwell), but I do like cites.  Anyone know where his full name was revealed? Director interview? Script? Novelisation? Other?  http://madmax.wikia.com/wiki/Max_Rockatansky?diff=next&oldid=4904"

Whilst the former is self-explanatory; the latter, which references ""smegma"", is the word for a combination of exfoliated (shed) epithelial cells, transudated skin oils, and moisture.

This is more Burning Man than anything else, it'd be a stretch to even suggest they were inspired by Mad Max."
MadMax,3dqntv,Captain_Kuhl,3,Sat Jul 18 16:30:51 2015 UTC,"The thing that made it feel like Fury Road to me was during the chorus where the lighting changed, it looked just like when they were inside the sand storm.    But I wouldn't say it's a ""shameless rip off"". It's just a music video paying an homage to the Fury Road aesthetic. If anything, a number of Nikki Minaj fans who otherwise had no interest in Mad Max probably went and saw the movie after they read comments/articles talking about the music video's inspiration."
MadMax,3dqntv,Andrew_W_Kennedy,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:32:50 2015 UTC,"I see a lot of cinematography/shots that are being directly copied. One example is 40 seconds into the video, that is the same low to high zoom shot from the first chase scene in Fury road (the scene with the vehicle that had a buzz saw attached to a crane arm). And the flags are the same exact colors as the flairs in FR. I loved the composition of many of the shots in Fury Road, its one of the things that made the film unique, and this video has a few shots that look like they were tracing shots from FR."
MadMax,3dqntv,josepheatsnutella,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:19:40 2015 UTC,I definitely see the Burning Man imagery as well. What i mean to focus on is that there are several specific shots that mimic the same exact composition of shots from Fury Road.

MadMax,3dqntv,adventurefine,2,Sun Jul 19 11:40:58 2015 UTC,"Clearly most of the people here are younger, maybe have only seen the new Mad Max. The video is an homage to Road Warrior, not Fury Road to all of you saying they don't match up or the release dates don't make sense, etc. David Guetta is wearing the same outfit as Pappagallo and his followers. Also keep in mind this isn't a Nikki Minaj video, it is a David Guetta one and he is into cars, racing and is the right age to be a fan from the original  trilology. I think it's okay, not as good as his F1 racing music video."
MadMax,3dqntv,PixieFurious,4,Mon Jul 20 18:04:34 2015 UTC,"I don't know, seems like kind of a burning man feel to me. The Mad Max type aesthetic has a life of its own at this point, so I don't know if we can talk about it getting ripped off.

The war boys seem so terrifying at the very beginning of the film, so our first expectation of him is to be a violent psychopath. We quickly learn his ambition to die in battle, and gradually learn just how innocent and pathetic he is inside. His ideals become questioned and the moment he realizes he's been fighting for the wrong cause he switches sides. Then, so soon after gaining a new reason to live, he gives it up in order to ensure the safety and survival of his friends. And in the end, he does precisely what he meant to do: Die historic on the fury road."

As an original low budget shocker with style it acquired a following, but don't expect post-apocalyptic scenes full of wild characters in awesome franken-cars.

MadMax,3dm9mq,Gnarbage,4,Fri Jul 17 17:04:17 2015 UTC,"I'm just chiming in largely to agree with other commenters so far.   Each Mad Max movie has it's own style and setting (the first is dystopian, but not yet post-apocalyptic for instance).   The original Mad Max was George Miller's first film - and it shows. It's great, but it's not so easily accessible as the later movies. It's pacing is relatively slow, and there are subtleties that are only rewarded with repeat viewings.   Thunderdome was part-directed by someone else, and feels a little disjointed. For some, that puts them off. I still think it's great.   MM2 (aka The Road Warrior) is generally seen as the best of the Gibson trilogy.   I hope you enjoy them all! :)"

MadMax,3dm9mq,Derpatologist_7,3,Fri Jul 17 13:15:57 2015 UTC,Mad Max 2 aka the Road Warrior is an amazing film.  It's hard to describe how awesome it is.
MadMax,3dm9mq,BadMedia,2,Sat Jul 18 04:15:24 2015 UTC,"I showed my girlfriend all the movies before we went to see Fury Road. Oddly enough, Beyond Thunderdome was her favorite and the Road Warrior was her least favorite  (she liked it, but she liked the other two more) but even after seeing Fury Road, she still enjoys them a lot and has rewatched Beyond Thunderdome. All the movies are different and will make people find they like some different than some. This sub loves Road Warrior (as do i) but it's not as black and white that you'll love only one or all three. Give them a shot. They are definitely worth a watch."

Fury road blew both of us away, when i first heard about it i was excited but afraid. The last thing i wanted was a bad movie to deter any newcomers.  Im so happy MM:FR did the exact opposite."
MadMax,3dm9mq,beligerentlypunk,3,Sat Jul 18 13:57:49 2015 UTC,"Not a popular opinion here, most likely, but I had to be bodily dragged into Fury Road, because my only other experience with Mad Max was Road Warrior, which I hated. Everyone told me that Road Warrior was the best of the original trilogy, but I didn't find the characters interesting, and frankly I'm going to dislike any movie that includes a rape scene for no apparent reason other than, ""Ooh, look how bad these bad guys are!""  That being said, I freaking LOVED Fury Road, so go figure. I think whether or not you like them will depend heavily on what you look for and enjoy in movies."

MadMax,3di097,Wireless-Wizard,11,Thu Jul 16 16:17:26 2015 UTC,"Miller was strongly considering filming it in black and white, seeing it as the logical extreme of the desaturated post-apocalyptic look. However, he said he couldn't do it for the theatrical release, because black and white is mostly used for arthouse-type movies and noir throwbacks, so he went with the brightly saturated version we saw in theaters."
MadMax,3di097,Hamlet7768,4,Thu Jul 16 16:58:17 2015 UTC,"Oh, alright. I had no idea.   I guess if you turn down the color setting on your television it'll achieve the same results. Have to try this when I get a copy."
MadMax,3di097,bigparkfan,7,Thu Jul 16 19:26:20 2015 UTC,"I doubt it'll be the same. I don't know this for sure, but from what I recall of an earlier thread there are specific professional ways of turning the color film black and white so that it looks crisp and clear, and just changing the settings will tend to make it look muddy."
MadMax,3di097,PastryChefSniper,2,Thu Jul 16 21:08:22 2015 UTC,Also good to know.
MadMax,3di097,bigparkfan,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:16:07 2015 UTC,"I just watched some random bits of FR with my video player set to greyscale and it looked fine. Still, I'm sure Miller would've done it better."
MadMax,3di097,M3n747,3,Fri Jul 17 09:46:08 2015 UTC,"I've seen two different B+W trailers made... one was pretty ordinary, one looked spectacular. From the same footage.   Professional grading and contrast for B+W should be extraordinary.   I hope it comes out eventually!"
MadMax,3di097,nemothorx,2,Fri Jul 17 11:48:41 2015 UTC,I agree; one of those B+W trailers actually gave me chills it was so good! I really want to see this movie professionally done in B+W.

MadMax,3devzq,YoungZer0,3,Thu Jul 16 07:15:34 2015 UTC,Buyers of the PC Version beware: This is published by Warner Bros. The recent PC Version of Batman Arkham Knight was a terrible port all hints at Warner Bros. trying to push out the game asap instead of focusing on a proper port.  Wait for reviews. If the reviews say that they did not receive a PC Port one week before launch: Do not buy. Wait it out.

MadMax,3dfj6b,Turbofurball,3,Wed Jul 15 21:37:26 2015 UTC,Every movie is made better with a Fury Road trailer mashup!
MadMax,3dfybt,nemothorx,4,Wed Jul 15 23:33:22 2015 UTC,"http://media.giphy.com/media/12eNicYP5cDnwY/giphy.gif  But in all honesty it isn't guzzoline that limits the siege, it is food and water.  Lord Humungous and his crew have access to the wasteland while the Guzzoline Pump Boys don't.  It's telling that they say, as you mentioned, ""every day we get weaker while they get stronger,"" because all things constant, they are running out of supplies.  We know that there are a considerable amount of folks running around the wastes (Max, Gyro Pilot) so we must assume there are others out there scavenging.  Humungous' Boys must raid everyone around for supplies and guzzoline.  Meaning the Guzzoline Pump Boys will weaken and starve before Humungous will ever relent.  EDIT: Clarity"
MadMax,3dfybt,Consolidated_Skeebal,3,Thu Jul 16 00:45:51 2015 UTC,"That's the obvious take from this, but it's not like the camp is exactly starving. (hell, they've got chickens running around as it stands.   With limited fuel, the marauders can only scavange so much of the surrounding district before they're out of fuel and end up stranded (or have to travel so far to scavenge fuel that it's not worth the travel back to continue the siege).   I guess my point is, in a world of ""show, don't tell"", the claim ""every day we get weaker while they get stronger"" is a tell that is poorly shown."
MadMax,3dfybt,eff1ngham,2,Thu Jul 16 01:32:41 2015 UTC,"Well a few pigs and chickens running around and some supplies stored up isn't really the point of them surviving.  They have a large group, and other than two or three people it doesn't seem like any of them are capable of combat or ""real"" survival in The Wasteland.  They want out, them saying ""we get weaker while they get stronger"" also applies to their mental state.    Another thing to consider, the Humungus and his gang up to that point had been relatively passive towards the group other than chasing down their scavenging parties.  If they really got desperate they may have just raided the base.  And given that only a few people there could fight there's a decent chance that they'd be overrun"
MadMax,3dager,sirenmika,49,Tue Jul 14 19:28:20 2015 UTC,"It was so lovely getting the chance to meet Nicholas Hoult, the actor who played Nux as well (my friend is an interviewer/host and set it up for me). He was so enthusiastic and excited about my costume and continually praised me about it as well as nearly dropping his own things when I asked for us to do the V8 salute together. Really stand-up guy."

I'd be interested to see that video. It's interesting to think that he shot that movie back in 2012 and kind of had no idea what he was making. Now people throw up the V8 sign when they see him and dress up like his character. It's gotta be quite something for him."

MadMax,3dcyjy,BreakingBradl,16,Wed Jul 15 08:13:33 2015 UTC,"I think showing (or even hinting) at a romantic future between Max and Furiosa would have ruined an extraordinary movie with such a hollywood cliche trope. It would have felt totally out of place.   They have earnt respect for each other. They have admiration. They are close, but they are not romance.   I think there is room for romance in the wasteland. But I don't think between Max and Furiosa in Fury Road would have been the place to show it - so very glad that they didn't! :)"
MadMax,3dcyjy,nemothorx,5,Wed Jul 15 09:02:54 2015 UTC,"Yup, they had the respect of fellow warriors. I'm sure there's plenty of badly written fanfics about them snogging though :-/"
MadMax,3dcyjy,Turbofurball,3,Wed Jul 15 11:12:17 2015 UTC,"I think Nux and Capable proved there is room for romance in the Wasteland. They only got as far as a kiss on the cheek but if they'd had time, they would have gotten there. They'd have become a couple. It's too bad time is the biggest thing half-life war boys don't have, because they proved that even with the sex slavery and breeding programs run by tyrants like Joe, two people can still find each other. I think that memory is going to be important to the new Citadel they'll be making.

MadMax,3dcyjy,nemothorx,5,Thu Jul 16 23:03:24 2015 UTC,"This is one reason why I adore Nux/Capable so much, it's clear that something is going on between them, but the movie doesn't beat you over the head with it like most other movies do I feel. I still feel that their on screen relationship (Nux/Capable) could have been toned down more still, it might have been included to appeal to the audience that prefers those tired old tropes or can't relate to a movie without a clear romantic subplot. I still prefer how much the movie goes the 'Show, don't tell' route. I agree with you though, I'm also somewhat conflicted like you are about the ending."

MadMax,3dcyjy,mukhlisz,2,Thu Jul 16 08:24:44 2015 UTC,"I too was surprised that Max left her, especially considering the lengths he'd just gone too to save her. Giving someone a transfusion from your own veins is a pretty intimate thing to do for anyone, let alone someone you just met three days ago.   And you know what? Given time, and peace, and close proximity to each-other, Max and Furiosa might, eventually, have developed a romance. Maybe. They'd have to actually get to know each-other first.   Furiosa is saddened when he won't come with them into the Salt, and terrified when it's just her and her prosthetic arm keeping him alive, but there's no indication she has any romantic interest in him. She respects him as a warrior, and likes him as a person, but she sees him leaving and smiles a warm goodbye. She doesn't ask him to stay. She knows he's got his own life to live.   And Max... ya know, if I had to guess, I'd say Max was more attracted to Angharad then to Furiosa. He's a former family man dying of thirst, she's the pregnant woman with the water hose. He takes her hostage twice, sits with her in his lap while waiting to see how the rock riders react, and her cries of distress are one of the things that get him to finally throw in his lot with the girls. Plus she climbed out of the rig, belly and all, to cut the chain that was threatening to tear his arm off. He smiled at her and gave her a thumbs up. I'm sure in Max's darkest animal brain, he thinks he somehow caused her fall, because everyone he gets even slightly close to is going to die. His guard was up doubly after that.   I think he respects the hell out of Furiosa. He proved as much when he handed her the rifle. I think he even likes her, and admires her skill as a leader. In short, sure, he loves her, but he does so platonically, and she returns it with a lot of affection and respect. Given time and the right circumstances maybe they could develop romantic feelings, since trust is a big part of love and they definitely trust each-other, but put simply, I don't think either one of them is anywhere close to being ready for that at the end of the movie. Max, in his way, is always going to be looking for Jess, and Furiosa has such a bad history that it'll be a long time before she can enter a stable, normal, healthy relationship with a man.   For one, I'm glad the idea that the male and female leads just have to wind up in love by the end of the movie didn't hold true. They are more interesting, and their struggles more real, because they didn't."
MadMax,3dcyjy,IdiotsLantern,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:37:52 2015 UTC,"I really like your idea that Max was more attracted to Angharad. Looking back on the film, I definitely agree with that. Do you think he'll ever find his Jess or will he end up being a lone wolf forever?"
MadMax,3dcyjy,IdiotsLantern,2,Thu Jul 16 08:48:18 2015 UTC,"Well, I think part of his madness is this compulsion to somehow get home to Jesse.  He knows she's dead, but in his head she's still waiting for him to come home, and he's late, and she's worried and he's got to hurry. It's part of the compulsion that will keep him wandering the wastelands forever."

So often in an action movie if we are lucky enough to have a ""Strong Female""she (or they) are still considered ""other,"" an unusual and rare example of that type of woman in whatever world the movie takes place in. But in this film we have a) many women, and b) different types of awesome women (some can fight, others can lead, others can be brave, others can be kind and see the goodness in people). Almostlikethey'rerealpeople?   That, and the fact that these women all have agency. They didn't have to be rescued by a man. Sure, Nux and Max helped them out a lot and played crucial roles, but in the end Furiosa and the Wives escaped by their own initiative, not because of some muscle man saving them.  Excuse the little monologue, I so so so enjoyed this movie."

MadMax,3d4ify,CEMN,46,Mon Jul 13 13:34:03 2015 UTC,I love how Max isn't this perfect badass that's never scared and emotionless. I love the part where his head is about to scrape the ground and he's SCARED. Something you don't see a lot in action movie characters. Heroes if you consider Max one.
MadMax,3d4ify,FogSeeFrank,20,Mon Jul 13 16:31:28 2015 UTC,"Definitely. It's hard to see behind the mask, but he spends most of the fight with Furiosa absolutely fucking terrified as well.   (And then five minutes later he's handing her guns. Furiosa does a brilliant job of getting him on her side.)"
MadMax,3d4ify,LogicalTimber,11,Mon Jul 13 19:43:22 2015 UTC,"Well, he had her down on the ground, with himself on top of her, with a loaded and functional gun to her head. If she'd managed to get HIM in that position, she'd have killed him. He'd have gotten the clip right in his skull. He actually DOES have her at his mercy, and... doesn't kill her. He also doesn't beat her, rape her or do anything else she might reasonably expect a muzzled psychotic to do. All he wants is for the fight to be over. She stops struggling.   But he's terrified of her. And no wonder. She almost killed him three times and even though he has the upper hand at the moment, he's clearly none too confident in his ability to stop her if she tries it again, no matter how many guns he points at her.  He's actually right to worry. That moment with the gear-shift knife is supposed to convey that she's not out of tricks yet and if he keeps being an enemy, eventually things are going to get very bad."
MadMax,3d4ify,IdiotsLantern,8,Tue Jul 14 00:29:00 2015 UTC,"Yup. If they continued trying to kill each other, Furiosa would probably win - the War Rig is her territory and full of weapons, and the wives will help her too. Max knows this. That's part of what makes the ""Want that thing off your face?"" line so good - Furiosa shows him that she does recognize him as a fellow human being, not just a target. That lets him relax just enough to decide that maaaaaaybe he's better off with this crew rather than waiting for the war party."
MadMax,3d4ify,LogicalTimber,10,Tue Jul 14 01:12:37 2015 UTC,"Well she tells him three things.  First, Joe is ""a very bad man."" So he can't rely on Joe's gratitude, especially since the thing Max seems to want, freedom, is one thing that's not on offer no matter how grateful Joe might be. Max looks like he gets this, but he still does nothing. She needs to give him more.   Second, that he's sitting on a nitro-boosted war machine and has a head start. Translation, we could probably outrun him if we start right now. Max still does nothing. It's not enough.   Third... ""you want that thing off your face?""   Translation: We will free you. You want freedom? You want to escape? So do we. You're dangerous to us, so we are dangerous to you, but this much we have in common.   THAT is enough. He lets her and the the other women in...keeping them at gunpoint, but it's one of him and six of them and if they all go at him at once, he's not going to last long. He needs to find a solution as well, which I think is why he agrees to head for the fuel pod. First, he doesn't trust Furiosa, AND he doesn't want to be left alone with the Wives, AND he wants to get away as badly as she does. Which I think is why she eventually gives him with the combination. She doesn't decide to trust him so much as she puts him in a place where he has no choice but to be trustworthy if he doesn't want everybody, including himself, dead or enslaved."
MadMax,3d4ify,IdiotsLantern,7,Tue Jul 14 04:06:04 2015 UTC,"It really reminds me of older films like Indiana Jones or even Die Hard, where you see the normally rough and tough main character display a full array of emotions throughout the movie."

On the other hand the pure simplicity of Max attempting to fight Rictus and quickly realizing 'crap, I can't do anything to hurt this tank' and instead using the disastrous, chaotic environment around them to distract and confuse Rictus long enough for everyone to escape ('cept for Nux, of course).

MadMax,3d3evq,Gnarbage,10,Mon Jul 13 05:14:31 2015 UTC,The Mad Max films are supposed to have a western type feel to them. They remind me very much of Clint Eastwood's westerns and I would be very shocked if they didn't have a direct influence on the Mad Max series.
MadMax,3d3evq,The_Nez,6,Mon Jul 13 05:46:20 2015 UTC,"You're absolutely right. I've seen interviews with Miller stating that Fury Road is a ""Western on Wheels."" The Road Warrior always felt like a spaghetti western on par with a Fistful of Dollars or something. Just thought it would be fun to include Batman and see how people reacted. I hope Max stays in popular culture now because The Road Warrior is my all time favorite movie"
MadMax,3d3evq,The_Nez,5,Mon Jul 13 05:53:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah the movies Clint did with Sergio Leone seem to be especially influential on Mad Max. And I hope it does too. It's the standard for anything post-apocalyptic (e.g. Fallout video game series), so my guess is that it's here to stay. My favorite film of all time is Requiem for a Dream with Fury Road being second and Road Warrior very close behind it. I like Gibson as Max better (I understand that it was extremely difficult for Hardy to portray a character so deeply associated with Mel Gibson and I think Hardy did a fantastic job), but I like Fury Road as a film better than the original trilogy. And I like the Batman choice. It's not perfect, but I can't think of anything better."

I think we only really got a glimpse of his Max because there was just so much going on in Fury Road. Furiosa and Nux had just as much screen time as Max and he was imprisoned for the first act of the movie so we didn't really get much from his character then.

He's a man with a dark past and no loyalty who somehow finds himself in the mix and works with others to his own means.  He's not quite and anti-hero, but he's as close as you can get.

MadMax,3d1bjl,Captain_Kuhl,8,Sun Jul 12 18:32:50 2015 UTC,That's the picture they sent?  Looks like a stock photo.
MadMax,3d1bjl,smellslikecat,5,Sun Jul 12 20:06:20 2015 UTC,Agreed that dosent look that they took a picture.
MadMax,3d1bjl,IdiotsLantern,5,Sun Jul 12 20:37:24 2015 UTC,Yeah it's kinda worrisome that they'd spend the time to PhotoShop it if it actually is the picture of it.
MadMax,3d1bjl,Pudge511,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:45:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that shoulder pad is going to need to be worked or replaced, in a best case scenario.   It's relatively easy for someone with the skill and material but for what you paid, it's disapointing. Lets hope the rest of the jacket is better."
MadMax,3d1bjl,Pudge511,5,Tue Jul 14 04:31:14 2015 UTC,But that's nothing like the real jacket. :/
MadMax,3d1bjl,Pudge511,3,Sun Jul 12 23:32:34 2015 UTC,"Needs a different jacket. I mean it is not like the real jacket at all. The style is completely wrong. There is too much to compare to fix that jacket. First none of those pockets should be there, the zipper is the wrong style, there shouldn't be a zipper in the elbow, the collar is way too small, the shape of the jacket bottom is off."
MadMax,3d1bjl,Cancerslug,3,Mon Jul 13 04:21:37 2015 UTC,Well the zipper on the elbow is so you can do the half sleeve like the movie or have a full sleeve. I like that bit. Pockets are because they were trying to replicate the battle jacket he wears later in the movie. Not really close to 100% accurate I know.  Personally I'm glad it's not 100% mad max jacket so I can wear it out and about without looking like a dweeb. I'm worried it's gonna be too different though and end up just looking weird.
MadMax,3d1bjl,Derpatologist_7,2,Mon Jul 13 04:42:37 2015 UTC,"I saw those and for the price, it wasn't a bad deal. The differences aren't really a bad thing. Just not SA. The combat jacket is a SADF M83 combat chest rig and the color is Nutria, just as a heads up. I wouldn't worry, it's not a bad looking jacket, I just don't like the leather shoulder pad. All in all, not a bad buy. :)"
MadMax,3d1bjl,Gnarbage,4,Mon Jul 13 05:45:26 2015 UTC,"This is the one to get, unless you can find an Abbyshot. The shoulder pad still isn't 100% accurate but it's a much better replica.  Looks like Abbyshot is actually making Mad Max jackets again."

MadMax,3d3gzf,eff1ngham,3,Mon Jul 13 07:23:54 2015 UTC,"Very little is spelled out in detail, because it's not important to the story of Max.   There are a number of fan-written timelines, all with greater or lesser amounts of speuclation. There are very few solid dates in the whole series.   Some good reading here, and is probably about as definitive as exists  http://madmax.wikia.com/wiki/Timeline_of_events_(original_trilogy)"

We know that the sea level is low enough that Sydney harbor is dry. The old cities have been abandoned in Australia at least. That's what we know from the movies. My guess would be most of the northern hemisphere is a radioactive wasteland, but there might be some hope for Africa and South America to have something civilized left."

MadMax,3d3gzf,ItsAmerico,5,Mon Jul 13 11:50:37 2015 UTC,"It's not salt flats. The pacific ocean would have many mountains and rifts, etc. He's probably saying ""there's nothing but salt"" meaning they might find nothing there. What max is saying is they have more hope going to immortan joes home than crossing a salt flat (not an ocean) and hoping to find something there."
MadMax,3d3gzf,ItsAmerico,7,Mon Jul 13 18:06:08 2015 UTC,"I think it's a reference to the salt lakes in Australia, they'd have been dried out and left salt I'd imagine?"

MadMax,3d3gzf,Bestpaperplaneever,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:37:15 2015 UTC,"It's been 7000 days since Furiosa's kidnapping which is about 20 years. Over all is been 12045 days since the beginning of the end based on the tattoo on Max's back. We don't know if the satellites still work or are broadcasting but considering the remnants of society could get an oil rig and a ammunition factory fixed,  its probable nothing else is being done anywhere else in terms of civilization."
MadMax,3d3gzf,Solas67,1 point,Tue Jul 14 10:09:53 2015 UTC,"I think the 12045 days refer to Max' age at the time of his capture, unless he lied about having been a cop in the opening narration, or cops still existed for decades after the apocalypse.  The opening of Mad Max 2 seems to imply that cops existed at least for a few months or so after the apocalypse (i.e. during Mad Max 1)."
MadMax,3d3gzf,Solas67,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:46:13 2015 UTC,"It's always meant to be ambiguous, but anytime you mention a nuclear war, resources running low and so on, you'd have to assume things are pretty far gone. If noone in Fury Road can access satellites, it presumes noone else can either. The original movie is pretty clear that society's falling apart already and then by Road Warrior, it's gone. Society generally has fallen apart, as evidenced by the scavenging. Miller just never had the budget to say 'this is what the rest of the world is doing', and to be honest that's not his focus. The original film is the only one to be -specifically- Australian, the second references it, the third and fourth are non-specific. You could definitely say it's happened all around the world, we just haven't seen it."

MadMax,3czzw7,GenDekker,8,Sun Jul 12 09:15:01 2015 UTC,At first I thought simply ripping part of his face off wouldn't be enough to kill him but maybe the quick jerk motion from the chain attached to his mask/apparatus also snapped his neck? Maybe it's a silly theory. But I just thought of it now.
MadMax,3czzw7,VforVickers,9,Sun Jul 12 13:05:10 2015 UTC,"1) Immortan is an old man. An injury that would be crippling to a healthy, young fella would certainly be catastrophic and likely deadly for Joe.  2) You have a very important artery in your face, called the Maxillary Artery. If you happen to be unfortunate enough to have your jaw torn off, you're going to need medical attention almost immediately. If you don't find someone to fix you up, quick, then you're going to exsanguinate - bleed to death.  3) As you noted, the physical force required to tear off a lower jaw could cause damage beyond the immediate injury - specifically, impact trauma.  Overall, there's a lot of reasons why Joe could have passed on to the gates of Valhalla."
MadMax,3czzw7,FM4k,2,Tue Jul 14 05:23:40 2015 UTC,Brutal. I am surprised that that would be enough to prove fatal though.
MadMax,3czzw7,Derpatologist_7,7,Sun Jul 12 09:54:24 2015 UTC,"Agreed, but Joe was an old man with other health issues, so it's not hard to suppose a heartattack (or even that without respirator he quickly died from inability to breathe - or drowned on his own blood). Either way, he was out of the fight and soon dead as soon as this happened.  (edit: closed brackets in a better spot)"

MadMax,3d2kbg,Nicke1Eye,3,Mon Jul 13 01:22:33 2015 UTC,"Nope. Many people have suggested this before, but it just doesn't work. The end narration of the Road Warrior suggests the Feral Kid's fate, and the opening of Fury Road both credits the character as ""Max Rockatansky"" not just Max, and has him say ""I was a cop"". Plus he is wearing his iconic leg brace - it would be too much of a coincidence for all of that to the be Feral Kid."
MadMax,3d2kbg,PastryChefSniper,2,Mon Jul 13 01:26:40 2015 UTC,"Though not the same leg brace, he is wearing one. It's actually a donjoy. The original is the polio brace which the woman from the first mad max wore."
MadMax,3d2kbg,Pudge511,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:59:04 2015 UTC,"Interesting. Do you have a source on the one from Road Warrior being the same as one in the first Mad Max (unless you meant original as in Mad Max 1 - I may be forgetting him putting it on in that movie)? Not that I disbelieve you, I just don't really remember that brace and the only thing I can find about the one in Road Warrior is that it is constructed from tail-gate hinges and straps (though that's also unsourced by the Wiki). I wish I could find some side-by-sides of the braces in the different movies."
MadMax,3d2kbg,PastryChefSniper,2,Mon Jul 13 05:10:07 2015 UTC,"When anyone says first of course they should mean the 1979 mad max. Just watch the movies, it's pretty obvious. The old woman is wearing the same afo braces that max constructs his from and wears in the road warrior. The new brace is much more streamline in that it isn't as baggy and loose as the old ones. I'm also a mad max fanatic so not much slips past me."
MadMax,3d2kbg,Pudge511,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:17:35 2015 UTC,"I was questioning whether you meant the ""original"" brace being worn by Max in the 1979 movie rather than Road Warrior, since I didn't remember him wearing a brace, not which movie was the original.  I definitely know the brace in Fury Road is not the same (and I appreciate you pointing out it's a donjoy). I just can't find anything online about the Mad Max 2 brace being in the original and am not about to watch it right now to find it. But I'll keep it in mind for when I do, thanks."
MadMax,3d2kbg,PastryChefSniper,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:22:06 2015 UTC,Sorry. He doesn't actually put the brace on in mad max. One can only assume that the prop was repurposed for road warrior.

MadMax,3cwraw,Wardez,6,Sat Jul 11 13:12:09 2015 UTC,"If Max's blood can heal, I'd say it's more likely because he's a fit, strong doner in a world where almost everyone else is dying of something, rather then some kind of supernatural or super science quality of his. Motherhood and the giving and nurturing of life is a huge theme in Fury Road, and Max's status as a Universal Donner makes him able to share his strength with those who don't have enough of their own. Blood from him beats back illness and death and makes you feel better. He's a kind of mother himself with his blood tube standing in for an umbilical cord, giving life willingly or unwillingly.   If it's supernatural its supernatural that same way Robin Hood's archery is supernatural. It's part of his nature as a Wasteland folk hero."
MadMax,3cwraw,IdiotsLantern,10,Sat Jul 11 19:21:09 2015 UTC,"yeah, I think you're reading more there than was intended.   He's just had a good day. That's all.   I prefer my Max to be Mad, but not a superhero (even an inadvertant one)."
MadMax,3cwraw,nemothorx,1 point,Sat Jul 11 13:15:30 2015 UTC,"Just in case you're curious and want to read a dissenting interpretation of the film, I wrote up my thoughts on Max's blood below..."
MadMax,3cwraw,Droidaphone,1 point,Sat Jul 11 16:05:11 2015 UTC,"It's an interesting analysis, for sure. It just doesn't sit well with my reading of the movie - or my general worldview. If Miller himself came out and said ""yes, Max is intended to be supernatural"", I could be grossly disappointed and my respect for him would go down.   But this is not surprising given my general worldview. I prefer my heroes to be extraordinary, rather than supernatural. (For instance, my favourite comic ""superhero"" is Batman (DC) and Ironman (Marvel) with a notable mention for The Phantom too - none of these three have supernatural powers. They're just folks. Extraordinarily smart/skilled/healthy/lucky/etc folks, but lacking in 'supernatural' nonetheless :)  Basically I don't think Max has magic blood. I do think he's extraordinarily healthy (relative to living in the wasteland) and heals quickly. Nor do I think Max has precognition, as some have suggested in other threads. I do think he's crazy, combined with being smart and can think fast on his feet. On top of all that he's lucky - not in a supernatural way, just in a 'central character to fiction' way."
MadMax,3cwraw,nemothorx,1 point,Sat Jul 11 23:57:20 2015 UTC,He's had A lovely day.   FTFY
MadMax,3cwraw,Bestpaperplaneever,0,Wed Jul 15 17:58:52 2015 UTC,"Max has the power of being pissed off. Hulk-light.   But yeah, just hit me something weird. But Max just really knows how to make things work to a super heroic degree anyway. He definitely has some special predisposition to survive."
MadMax,3cwraw,nemothorx,4,Sat Jul 11 13:21:00 2015 UTC,"eh, he has the luck of survival. I think that's about it - and that's not something notably special to Max, so much as just the way fiction is written in general. Central characters tend to survive.  But he's not immune to injury, and in the Gibson trilogy, Miller was careful to show that injuries from one movie were carried through to the next movie. (none were overtly carried through to Fury Road, though the leg brace remained as an allusion to the Gibson ones)"
MadMax,3cwraw,Droidaphone,6,Sat Jul 11 13:26:06 2015 UTC,"I don't think you're reading into to it too much to think that Max's blood has special powers. I think it's actually strongly implied that Max has something supernatural watching out for him, and his blood is part of that.   Actually, I'm surprised i haven't seen this brought this up before: Max is very much a Jesus figure, and the blood is part of that.  When we first see him, Max tells us that he is driven by one thing: survival. His dreads and beard seem to imply that he may be an old man, it is surprising to see such a strong, youthful face underneath. Possibly Max is unnaturally old? We learn he's a universal donor: it makes him extremely valuable in a society where humans are a commodity. But while Max might be unnaturally old, he definitely is unnaturally wild, willful, and bold. Max is simply un-tame-able. But something hinders his attempt to survive: a guilty memory, another purpose: protecting others. Saving people.  Nux calls Max's blood 'high-octane' psychopath blood. Just a quick suggestion that his blood itself may be special. Later, Max unbreakable nature means that he never seems weakened by his blood transfusions. Throughout the film, his uncanny ability to survive is driven home over countless near-misses. Part of this is obviously just the nature of an action film: the hero does unthinkable things. But maybe George Miller is playing with the idea of an action hero here: maybe Max is truly a man of legend, who beats death back with sheer willpower. Or maybe Max is literally watched over by unseen forces.  The obvious turning point for Max as a character is when he chooses to help the Furiosa and the Vuvalini instead of merely surviving himself. Something has changed, he's not just a blood bag looking for an escape. He sees a chance to redeem himself from his previous failure to protect others.  Later, his memory of his dead companion (daughter?) saves his life, as Max is LITERALLY given the stigmata. If you notice, BOTH of Max's hand's end of being pierced: one by a bolt, another by a bullet. I'm not sure why this happens but is never lingered on by the film. There's no way it's a coincidence, and it's not the only religious imagery in the film either. There's the Michaelango-like nature of the hurricane scene, the odd quotations by the bullet farmer, the scene where Imortan Joe is praying to a grenade... And before we forget, Max also is required to save Furiosa by freely giving her his blood which had been only taken by force before. That's pretty much an on-the-nose Jesus metaphor.   (Edit: to re-iterate, a guy who has a hard time dying and holes in both of his hands gives his blood to save someone, and in doing so, helps save a whole tribe of people. You can't get a whole lot more Jesus-y than that)  And also, even though Furiosa may be out of blood, it seems slightly miraculous that Max's on-the-road transfusion was enough to keep her alive. Again, maybe Max's blood is a thing of legend.  So, yeah. Max's blood is a big symbol in the movie. There's definitely imagery in there that ties him symbolically to christ, and his blood is mentioned as having special qualities. I don't think there's an in-world explanation. I think Max is a myth, a legend, and possibly a messiah-figure in this new world.  I don't know why there isn't more made of this symbolism in the film. My guess is that it was cut, because it slowed down the non-stop pace. And maybe because it was heavy-handed, and pulled away from some of the immersion. The parts where the film is the most baroque, the most religious are some of the strangest parts. But it's definitely in there."

Again, maybe Max's blood is a thing of legend.   Furiosa was losing blood, sure, but that's not the only problem she had. Her lung was collapsing from the wound in her side. A good thread to read here - from an military combat medic, who basically says that the injury, diagnosis, and procedure to save Furiosa are all legit.  https://www.reddit.com/r/MadMax/comments/3c3n0a/possible_spoilersif_anyone_is_interested_in_the_2/  Remember: George Miller is a trained Doctor. The Mad Max movies have never dealt in fantasy healing, but have often indulged in the realism of horrific injury."

MadMax,3csuxk,AccursedEntity,4,Fri Jul 10 16:34:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah, because there's nothing creepy and scary in a bunch of fanatics following a crazy warlord. By the way I am an old school fan of the original movies(specially the first and second) and I am no kid.   But there was more story in the War Boys than the ones in the old movies. The originals had crazies doing practically whatever they want(although they did had some leadership), it was mostly crazed anarchy. The war boys can be scarier because they are crazy and organized fanatics, sometimes fanatics can be worse. You know the Doof Warrior was wearing his mother's face as a mask right? :D Nothing psycho there."

They where scary in they  motives and the way they where involved in the story, but at first there looks did spook me enough, until later when I saw the more.   I love the War Boys, there one of the best villain groups ever, but I like the old Raiders more, Cause they where ruthless Raping Murdering all alike."

One of the first things I remember from the War Boys is that suicidal leap onto the spiky car. That was awesome and creepy and spooky and let me know just what kind of fuel raged insane group they were...   That and the line, ""You can't go make war...""   If there was ever a line to perfectly describe the insanity and ignorance of the Warboys, it's that right there.   Makes me so happy."

The Gyro Captain belongs in the same category as the Wives, the compound people in Road Warrior, and the kids from thunderdome. They have grand hopes for rebuilding, but they dont have the insanity and brutality required to survive in the Wasteland. The Gyro Captain is captured by Max almost immediately, the wives wouldn't have made it on their own, and so on.  So Max exists as a waypoint between barbarity and civilization. He has just enough humanity left to help the rebuilders, but also enough insanity to actually beat back the real madmen of the wasteland so the others can survive. He's not the hero at all. He's a stepping stone used by the heroes to get enough of a foothold to really begin to rebuild."
MadMax,3crg7e,uponthecityofzephon,3,Fri Jul 10 20:20:02 2015 UTC,"I love the observation that he's a waypoint... but I disagree that he's not the hero.

MadMax,3cpbzx,IdiotsLantern,6,Fri Jul 10 02:00:20 2015 UTC,"I've had this happen too. I learned a thing about the two main types of audience that go and see movies these days most.   A lot of people are just too used to novel adaptations or movies that follow similar structure. Most of all, they need a tight ending and for the movie to feel well rounded and complete. To them, this is a good ""movie.""   Then there are those who appreciate movies for being movies, rather than simply being vehicles for a complete story.   Mad Max doesn't ever apologize for being a flat out visual feast that tower the story along with it, not the other way around. And people take issue with that because to them, a movie is supposed to have a clear point in it.   I love GM for throwing this style in the face modern cinema, proclaiming loudly that movies can be a lot simpler than they have to be in the story department and still be deep while focusing on executing intense visuals that tell the viewer most of what they need to know.   It's totally fine to be either one if you want. I'm into both, so I get to enjoy all kinds, but for some weird reason, a lot of people think they need to pick a side and stick with it."

There the only nudity in Fury Road is Valkyrie's, and that is obscured by her hair and the camera angle. There is no sex in the film."
MadMax,3cponh,IdiotsLantern,5,Thu Jul 9 20:52:18 2015 UTC,"Other commenters have noted that they're not sure why FR was rated R. Editing down for your family sounds like a good task, and what you edit may be dependent on what they're going to be bothered by more - nudity/sex (of which there is very little in FR), violence (there is a heap), gore (the worst is Joe's face torn off and subsequent view of it as a corpse at the Citadel), or... something else.   Good luck with your edit!  (and that scene you mention - I agree with others that IMDB is fail there. It's a scene from the first movie)"
MadMax,3cponh,nemothorx,3,Thu Jul 9 23:09:18 2015 UTC,"that scene is in the first movie, fury road does not have that kind of scene."

MadMax,3cponh,Derpatologist_7,3,Thu Jul 9 20:15:24 2015 UTC,"Like everyone else says, there is absolutely no scene like that in Fury Road. Mad Max 1 & 2 yes, albeit briefly.   I'm curious, and I apologise if I come across as smarmy as it's not my intention, but does your family have a problem with nudity/sex but not violence or gore? If so, I've always found that one of the most weirdest contradictions. Like the former is natural and beautiful and the latter is horrible and unsettling yet god forbid somebody shows a breast onscreen lest you damage someone's psyche."
MadMax,3cponh,Derpatologist_7,2,Thu Jul 9 23:20:04 2015 UTC,"Yes it is weird that people care more about the nudity than the violence. But I did get rid of some violence and gore. Blurred what happens to immorten Joe, and I zoomed in the abortion scene so that you don't see dead baby. Plus some other crazy blood and stuff."
MadMax,3cponh,nemothorx,2,Fri Jul 10 00:14:13 2015 UTC,Is this due to religious sensitivities or something else?

MadMax,3cponh,Raist1,5,Fri Jul 10 06:17:00 2015 UTC,"I would counter that not all violence/nudity is gratuitous. Sometimes it's a completely valid and important part of the storytelling process.   Granted that there is so much gratuitous violence and nudity in a lot of cinema and TV these days, that it's easy to conflate ALL violence and nudity into the 'gratuitous' label.  IMHO, Fury Road stands out by NOT showing gratuitous nudity, when it so easily could have (especially since it already has an R rating). Instead, it respected that adding nudity was not needed for the story, and so wasn't gratuitous.   Similarly the violence could have included a LOT more gore. Instead, it was kept restrained for the benefit of the story :)"
MadMax,3cponh,Turbofurball,1 point,Sun Jul 12 10:57:37 2015 UTC,Then they shouldn't watch the movie. Go watch something else. This movie is for people who enjoy extreme violence and action on screen.
MadMax,3cponh,sombray,2,Sun Jul 12 01:21:21 2015 UTC,I watched Road Warrior yesterday and the description seems very reminiscent of the one that happened in Road Warrior.  And I have seen Fury Road twice and am pretty damn sure there was no such scene.
MadMax,3cponh,chrisbean213811,2,Thu Jul 9 22:12:38 2015 UTC,Both Mad Max 1 and 2 feature a moment with that description. MM2 also has a rape scene which is pretty disturbing (though not gratuitous).  Fury Road has none of that.

MadMax,3cldxj,Jordy95,30,Wed Jul 8 20:31:27 2015 UTC,"I didn't see it as motherly, really, but more of an innocent puppy-love type thing. When you think about it, both Nux and Capable were, in a sense, emotionally children. She'd been isolated and imprisoned for (presumably) her whole life, he'd been brainwashed and indoctrinated out the wazoo.   I loved how they showed the affection between the two as being again, very sweet and innocent (napping together, a kiss on the cheek, etc). The movie could very easily have fucked up and had a sex scene between them or something else jarring and stupid, but I think they made a great decision by portraying the relationship the way they did."
MadMax,3cldxj,maeEast,3,Wed Jul 8 21:23:07 2015 UTC,"I agree completely. Their relationship was obviously romantic, but they didn't take it any further than it should have gone for two people their age and their maturity who have only known each other for the amount of time that they've known each other for."
MadMax,3cldxj,CharlieHarvey,15,Thu Jul 9 19:38:47 2015 UTC,"I agree with the wince of anticipation when Capable found Nux and it became clear they were going to have a connection. She's an abused former sex slave. He's a dying kamikaze boy. Neither of them is mentally or emotionally ready for a sexual relationship and I respect that the movie didn't try and force them into one. Given time (a thing a dying war boy doesn't really have), they would have probably gotten there, but their one and only kiss was on the cheek.   That said... basically from the moment Capable lies down beside him, the two are pretty inseparable. They nap together, comfort each-other, ride on the same bike... there's a moment in a behind the scenes bit which must be a deleted scene where she's upset to learn the Green Place is gone, and Nux walks over to her and puts a comforting hand on her shoulder. I understand why they lost it but I like the idea that he'd comfort her with a gentle touch like she comforted him earlier.   Capable actually protects him quite a bit by sticking up for him and finding him ways to earn everybody's trust. She is why I never worried he was going to betray the group at the 11th hour in a bid to regain Joe's favor. No way was he going to do that if it would have meant hurting or loosing her. Unlike Max, who was given a bike and an invitation but was otherwise free to go where he wanted, no one had to ask if Nux was going into the Salt with everyone else because wherever she's going, he's going too and that's it. They are like two children who just know that being together feels right. Even separating long enough for him to repair the engine requires an effort and a long ""get back safe"" look from her.   I like that they avoided the cliche where they see each-other and it's a long look moment and we just know those two are going to have a relationship. I think the moment where they connect in the back of the tanker is our first time really seeing either of them, since in a way they are both re-evaluating who they are in the wake of Angharad's death."

MadMax,3cldxj,Turbofurball,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:32:54 2015 UTC,"I dont think it was supposed to be motherly or romantic. Not every relationship has to be like that. And neither of those would make much sense in their situation. I saw it as more of a friendship, just kind of a person to person understanding, and they were just enjoying and deciphering the only amount of affection they'd ever been given in their lives. It didnt have to be complicated, it didnt have to be any more than it was. It just illustrates the way human emotions are affected by the wasteland."

Then his wife dies, the nuclear war happens, we're talking 5 years (I know there are ""official"" timelines but nothing is really ""official"" until GM says it's so.) that puts him at 25 by Road Warrior. Then 10 years later it's MMBT so he's 35 by that time. I guess another 10 could pass before Fury Road so he's probably in his mid to late 40s. Hardy could be a young looking 45 for sure.

It tells it as though the movies were all in chronological order implying that Fury road happens after Thunder Dome. Then the rest of the comic seems to be about what happens leading up to Fury Road. Explaining how the Interceptor Is back in the story. I can give more details if anyone wants me to.

He sometimes takes employment... Doing random things like bodyguard, miner, assassin,etc.. But only on HIS terms. - HERE IS THE IMPORTANT PART - ...And always in return for car parts with which to REBUILD his INTERCEPTOR.  This page makes it seem like Max must have his Interceptor hidden away somewhere and works on it when he can and when he gets parts.   Then when it goes into the story telling what happened between Thunderdome and Fury Road it is a story of Max visiting Gas City where they also host a Thunderdome battle, but with a twist. Instead on ""two men enter, one man leaves"" it is many enter and fight tooth and claw but still only one leaves and is rewarded a prize. In this particular battle the prize is a Boss 351 Cleveland V8 Engine. Max wants it for his Interceptor that he is still rebuilding."

Which is why I won't be reading the others. The movie works well on its own. This is another case where tie-ins add nothing to the wonderful experience of the film.  The best tie-ins are those that honour the world already created but at the same time add something new without beating you over the head with unnecessary exposition, questionable imagery and bizarre character moments.  I felt this comic was done in poor taste and treats its audience as dumb."
MadMax,3ckp6x,VforVickers,2,Sat Jul 11 22:07:00 2015 UTC,Apologies for the crappy quality of the blog. Ordinarily I would have made a video through my YouTube but when I first read this review I knew I'd have to do something a little more detailed and just couldn't manage it in video.  Hopefully the content makes up for the blog design.  I'd love people's thoughts on my interpretations but I recognise it's also a wall of text :/ sorry
MadMax,3ckp6x,IdiotsLantern,3,Wed Jul 8 17:44:52 2015 UTC,"...I am biting my fist and trying very hard to heed Max's warning. Because he's right... it's a trap. I get in there, I'll never get out.   .... I shall limit my reaction the bare essentials:   Reviews of reviews are always a hard sell for me, because it's an opinion on an opinion. Especially when it's a review like Ana's which is rooted in her real-life experience as a victim of rape and abuse who saw a lot of troubling tropes in the comic and wrote a blog about it. Ever since, she has dealt with a lot of condescending explanations seeking to 'correct' her and I'm sure she's tired of it.  In a mostly non-verbal movie like Fury Road, a lot is left up to interpretation. But you ask Ana repeatedly if she saw the same film you did.. and I'm not really sure -I- saw the same film you did. I won't go detail here, because I'd be here all night and again, who needs an opinion of an opinion of an opinion, but I disagree with your interpretation of key moments in the film, and one quote you used was actually incorrectly quoted, and it made it harder for me to take your opinion seriously.  You repeatedly bring up that you think the comic creators were opperating on inside knowledge from the film's pre-production/writing phase, and this is how we know this interpretation, and not Ana's, is the correct one. Considering the freedom George gave the actresses to control their own characterization and the workshops with Eve Ensler, I think the comic creators may have been operating with different information then ended up in the movie and the two visions branched after shooting actually began. Key details of the Wives back-stories that came out in the workshops (Angharad is a cutter, Toast cut her hair short as an act of defiance to make herself less feminine and attractive to Joe and was probably his least favorite and most difficult wife, Capable was Angharad's  BFF,) weren't mentioned in the comic, nor was the scene where Angharad forces Furiosa to spare Nux by reminding her that they'd agreed to ""no unnecessary killing,"" implying that as desperate as they were to escape, they were still mistrustful enough to insist on some conditions first. It's not really surprising, since the movie went through two years of post and even one period of extensive re-shoots, so continuity problems are inevitable, but this parting of the ways makes this less a ""prequel"" and more it's own original thing. This isn't bad by itself, just disappointing for those of us who were hoping for more from the world of the movie.    And I'm going to turn off notifications for this one, since I have already vented my spleen about that comic and don't want to do it any more. I hope to step back out of this trap before it closes on me and I'm lost forever."
MadMax,3ckp6x,VforVickers,2,Thu Jul 9 04:01:14 2015 UTC,"You probably won't see this but I watched your rant about the comic and you captured a lot of my frustration with the Furiosa comic. It's almost as if they wanted to reverse how awesome these characters were in the film. Some of the imagery in the comic book is very questionable. They hammer us on the head with unnecessary exposition and then throw in a quote from the film for good measure because ""Hey, there's a link!"". It just left a really sour taste in my mouth. Most movie tie-ins leave me feeling indifferent because a lot of them rarely measure up to the film. But this one left me feeling angry and frustrated.  This was made for the ""I need everything spelled out for me"" crowd. And also for those who want as much backstory as they can get, no matter how unsatisfying. Mystery is good. Subtlety is good. Honouring the world and characters of a film is good. This comic book is no good."

MadMax,3chmmx,IdiotsLantern,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:51:43 2015 UTC,"If Max gets through it with any dignity intact, it can hardly be worse.   ...Hashtag stillnotoverit."
MadMax,3chmmx,nemothorx,6,Wed Jul 8 02:47:27 2015 UTC,"To be honest, I feel like Furiosa herself maintained her dignity, that wasn't my problem with the comic. The biggest issues that I have with it are: The story literally does nothing to progress the story of Furiosa or the wives. It only provides unnecessary exposition on details that were already assumed. Additionally, like half the comic is either Joe raping the wives, or the wives talking about getting raped by Joe. Now that I'm writing about it though, I'm getting angry that I spent $5 on that comic. Here's to hoping I'm not disappointed tomorrow."
MadMax,3chmmx,IdiotsLantern,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:05:05 2015 UTC,"Interesting that the sample pages shown cover the events of the Gibson trilogy, so this would seem to be going for the ""single unified continuity"" angle, rather than the ""standalone mythic stories"" view."
MadMax,3chmmx,nemothorx,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:33:26 2015 UTC,"In a way I'm relieved, because now we know the comics are a new continuity. We know Miller isn't big on canon, heck the very nature of what killed the world seems to change between movies, and he's repeatedly declined to link Fury Road too specifically in with the previous films.  It's like everything the movie deliberately avoided, the comic is eager to do. It's kinda amazing."
MadMax,3chmmx,sombray,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:03:57 2015 UTC,"My view on the continuity is that the three Gibson movies are chapters of the one ""myth"", but Hardy is a separate myth. Similarly, the comics are their own myth, and the upcoming game is another myth again.  But even that's kind of a loose idea, and implies I care more about the continuity between the Gibson movies than I actually do.   I'm certainly MORE than happy at this point to call the comics their own thing."

MadMax,3chfs2,TypoHero,8,Tue Jul 7 22:56:17 2015 UTC,"In the opening montage of MM2, we see Max standing by two graves.  Miller is a big fan of ""show you the key moments, let you work out the connection"".   We knew she was very badly injured, and we see her grave. Do we really need it spelled out that ""oh dear, thought she was going to make it, but turns out: not so much""  That's great for a medical drama, but not needed for MM."
MadMax,3chfs2,nemothorx,7,Tue Jul 7 23:03:03 2015 UTC,"I always took ""salvageable"" to mean they could save parts of her to use for other people (which is why the list off the parts).  Even if she did live for a while, Max steals a police car and goes out and kills like 12 guys.  In a time where there are still laws.  It's not like he could just go back a few days later and have everyone forget about it.  At that point he had to just wander away deeper into the Wasteland."
MadMax,3chfs2,eff1ngham,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:17:01 2015 UTC,"But Max is a police officer at that time and the force bought that car specifically for Max. Plus the main job of the MFP is gang control so I doubt anyone would be mad about the force's top pursuit man getting rid of a known deadly gang. Plus if it ever went to court it would either come out as no contest or Max's word against the dead biker's...which I assume would also mean no contest.  I do completely agree about his wife being ""salvageable"" though, otherwise them listing off body parts doesn't really make sense in context."
MadMax,3chfs2,beligerentlypunk,1 point,Fri Jul 10 12:47:19 2015 UTC,"Oh I getcha, I'm basing this off the tone the movie sets right off the bat.  There is constant chatter on the police radio about following procedures and maintaining strict order.  Its not quite like Lethal Weapon where they can tear through the city killing people and blowing stuff up and get a bunch of high fives at the end of the day.  Could he have gone back?  Maybe, and maybe they wouldn't have cared.  But Max was already starting to lose it, bordering on being one of the people he chased down on a regular basis.  That was the point he snapped.  Even if he could have gone back to the MFP, would he have wanted to?"
MadMax,3chfs2,eff1ngham,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:56:58 2015 UTC,"I doubt it, he wanted to leave the MFP because he was ""scared of becoming one of those terminal crazies"" when he ran down the toecutter he became one. With nothing left to lose and nothing to live for he drives off into the wasteland looking for his own humanity."
MadMax,3chfs2,beligerentlypunk,3,Fri Jul 10 16:18:08 2015 UTC,"If you understand all the medical jargon the Doctor uses, then his wife is alive with functioning organs but no brain activity. She's brain dead.   Max had been standing outside of that hospital room all day without moving or speaking to anyone. He hears them talking about harvesting her organs and I think part of the strain on him was knowing they'd want him to sign off on it. We saw her grave so she died soon afterwards anyway weither he did or didn't, so my guess is the hospital and what was left of that part of Australian society didn't last long once the police force finally fell apart.   Goose is more of a question mark. We heard him breathing but don't know if he ever regained consciousness or if he eventually died of his wounds. There was a time when Lord Humungeous was going to turn out to be Goose, but that was abandoned when someone realized it'd make no sense. So who knows what happened to him after Max lost it for good.   For as long as the Mad Max movies focus on characters other then Max, I don't think we can expect to see Goose again, but that's too bad, cuz I'd love to see Tom Hardy's Max meet his old, left-for-dead partner from what feels like a former life."
MadMax,3chfs2,IdiotsLantern,1 point,Wed Jul 8 04:58:54 2015 UTC,Yeah I heard salvageable as in her organs were still good for like donation.
MadMax,3cjelw,Bonapartist,20,Wed Jul 8 11:14:57 2015 UTC,"her initial motivation wasn't overthrowing Joe. It was escape to her homeland.   Then there is the problem of the warboys, other Imperators, the Bullet Farmer, The People Eater, etc...   So, yes. She could have simply killed Joe. But why would she? It would have effectively been a suicide."
MadMax,3cjelw,nemothorx,7,Wed Jul 8 11:25:59 2015 UTC,"The Bullet Farm and Gas Town aren't rivals, they're partners.  All the Warboys and other Imperitors left in the Citadel, and everyone from those two clans would have just killed her, kept the wives and put someone else in charge.  As nemothorx already mentioned their plan was to escape.  The only reason they went back was because Max convinced them there was nothing out in the Wasteland to grow crops and that the Citadel was their best option."
MadMax,3cjelw,eff1ngham,5,Wed Jul 8 14:24:46 2015 UTC,"I don't think it would be as simple as her just walking up to him and cutting off his head.  For one, he has his son protecting him and he tastes the milk first plus he has his other imperators.  That throne room isn't a 'come and go as you please' kind of place.  Also, I mean, how do you kill a living god?  Her plan was just to get the eff out and rescue some folks as well.  Killing Joe only became possible after the insane experiences of the film and the body count became so huge."
MadMax,3cjelw,skonen_blades,4,Wed Jul 8 16:13:29 2015 UTC,"public killing: rictus would make a pudding of her.  poison: maybe, but then with joe dead, what's gonna prevent the citadel from falling into total chaos? what would happen to the wives in a situation like that?"

MadMax,3cbvus,MagicalMoustacheMan,10,Mon Jul 6 18:47:58 2015 UTC,Oooh yeaaah! That's some subtle details I'd never notice during the movie.
MadMax,3cbvus,Kubrick_Fan,6,Mon Jul 6 18:57:35 2015 UTC,Also you'll notice the two lumps on his neck are bigger in this scene than at the start of the film.
MadMax,3cbvus,IdiotsLantern,4,Mon Jul 6 23:40:20 2015 UTC,"Nux's make-up starts fading gradually the longer he stays with the heroes. In the scene with the Vuvolini, it's pretty far gone. I like that it never entirely disappears though. Nux is a War Boy, and that never really goes away."
MadMax,3cbvus,IdiotsLantern,23,Tue Jul 7 03:10:53 2015 UTC,"Goddamn that Nick Holt is a good actor. I count three conflicting emotions in this scene. He's realizing what great purpose he was being saved for, and he's ready and willing and excited... And terrified. He's breathing hard and his hand is shaking. It takes him a second to rally his strength to say the words.   War Boyz are taught that they live, they die, they live again.  Nux himself was all too eager to die so he could ride forever in Valhalla.   Now the moment's finally come, and he's ... sad. I don't think he's stopped believing in Valhalla, but maybe he's no longer sure if he's going there. Or maybe, even if it's real and he gets in and the Heroes of All Time are there, the red-haired girl won't be. This is his purpose, his destiny, but... he has to say goodbye to her, and his Blood Bag, and his friends, and whatever vague hopes he may have had for the future. And that's hard.   ""Witness Me"" never meant, ""goodbye, this is for you, I love you,  goodbye"" before Nux. Capable being there, signing back the sign for love and remembrance, is what gave him the final surge of strength he needed to spin the wheel and go to Valhalla with a smile on his face and no regrets.   We are seeing how Joe's toxic ideology might be transformed into something kinder by the new Citadel."

Is it an event where you need to bring everything to last the weekend on your own or are there food/drink vendors on-site? Is it something that you can go to solo or should you look into joining a tribe? I've been to Burning Man several times so I know how to pack/camp for a long desert trip.
MadMax,3cd0y4,Combaticron,2,Tue Jul 7 18:27:45 2015 UTC,"Ideally you'll bring everything you need (ice and water especially), but there is usually a taco truck and people are very generous about sharing. The Atomic Cafe has free drinks but it's good juju to bring a donation. Town is 20 minutes away in case of emergency.  You can go solo and hook up with other groups with a minimum of effort, or you can find a tribe you like (on FB or the WW forums) and ask to join. And yeah, it IS awesome."

Fury Road is head and shoulders above the rest because of the intense and intimate composing done. Every track has something different in it, yet keeps borrowing themes from the first track. It's interesting to note that like Tron: Legacy by Daft Punk, this was done by a DJ with no real experience in film scores, but he understands the themes so well, it carries and lifts the movie superbly."

MadMax,3c9l0z,Gnarbage,21,Mon Jul 6 04:07:23 2015 UTC,"Max's costume was grayed out, wore down to showed age and use. The design was spot on in the utilitarian nature of his lone survivor way of life.  To add to this tread; I thought the costume for Immortan Joe was one of the best villain designs I have ever seen. the little details on the chest plate, the custom breathing mask and the scepter really pulled it all together. Like Darth Vader but more evil and menacing."

MadMax,3c9l0z,IdiotsLantern,7,Tue Jul 7 08:21:02 2015 UTC,"Max's costume was supposed to have been black once, but it's been so weather worn that it's original color has faded.   But they really wanted to start from scratch for Fury Road, and build a new Max. Tom Hardy actually had a lot of opinions about Max's first look, the one he has when he's captured. The idea is this Max is supposed to be less a biker and more a para-military/ Blackwater kind of guy who went through some unknown war.   There was one thing they couldn't resist keeping through. Sometime while Jen Breavan (the acadamy award winning costume designer) was starting work on Mad Max, Mel Gibson's jacket from ""Road Warrior"" turned up in some Australian warehouse. It was grey and stiff as a board, but it was genuine. She broke it down and based Tom's jacket on the same design. So that's your connection."
MadMax,3c9l0z,Retlaw83,5,Mon Jul 6 07:26:30 2015 UTC,Max says right at the beginning of Fury Road that he used to be a cop. Just like the original. Any warring he's done is since the apocalypse.
MadMax,3c9l0z,AfraidOfTechnology,-2,Mon Jul 6 10:28:25 2015 UTC,"In Max's world, cops are also known as ""Road Warriors"" and they deal with much more anarchic conditions than normal, everyday cops. It's likely that the Police force has become at least partially militarized. From what I remember, it seemed less like the Police were simply upholding the law and more like they were waging war on biker gangs and other bandits."
MadMax,3c9l0z,Retlaw83,5,Mon Jul 6 11:26:11 2015 UTC,"No, they aren't known as road warriors. Mad Max being a cop and being the Road Warrior are entirely different things. The cops are not militarized. Have you ever watched the first three movies?"
MadMax,3c9l0z,The_Nez,4,Mon Jul 6 12:04:47 2015 UTC,You're right. I'm pretty sure that the opening narration is a direct reference to the first two movies.
MadMax,3c9l0z,AfraidOfTechnology,2,Mon Jul 6 13:33:02 2015 UTC,"The connection to Fury Road and the previous three films is awfully tenuous. When Max says that he was a cop, I seem to remember he follows it up immediately by describing himself as a Road Warrior. Also, Organic tattoos that word on his back. It's not unlikely that Organic recognized him as a cop based on his jacket and Interceptor, which would not be common items in the wastelands. (Maybe not so much the jacket.) It doesn't prove that cops were called Road Warriors, but it might lead one to speculate. No, the Main Patrol Force isn't militarized, but it was obvious that they weren't typical cops, either. They were almost more like mercenaries. They may not have officially called themselves the Road Warriors, but that doesn't mean people didn't use that as a slang term for cops in that universe. The War Boys, Imperators, Bullet Farm and Gas Town boys, dudes from Barter Town, Humungus's Gayboy Berserkers and War Dogs, and the gangsters from Mad Max, as well as the people inhabiting the refinery in the second film are never described as Road Warriors. So if ""Road Warrior"" is a title exclusive to Max, Organic would not have known that, and he would not have tattooed that on his back. Which seems to suggest there is a possibility that within this setting, people might refer to cops as ""Road Warriors."" It's really just a guess, though. An errant observation..."
MadMax,3c9l0z,nemothorx,7,Mon Jul 6 15:07:25 2015 UTC,"I think it's more likely that if ""Road Warrior"" is a general slang, it would be for something like ""someone who survives solo (shunning any kind of family/community/cop or even gang affiliation)"", though on second thought, it's probably even more generic than that - just someone who is exceptionally good at driving based survival skills, regardless of affiliation.   I disagree with /u/Retlaw83 regarding the continuity of the movies, but I completely agree on ""being a cop and being the Road Warrior are entirely different things""."
MadMax,3c9l0z,IdiotsLantern,4,Mon Jul 6 16:32:45 2015 UTC,"I agree. I think ""Road Warriors"" are what they call the lone scavengers who wander the wastes. ""Cops"" were a different thing."
MadMax,3c9l0z,IdiotsLantern,-2,Tue Jul 7 00:24:55 2015 UTC,"What he means by ""cop"" and what we mean by ""cop"" might not be the same. For all we know, the military and police merged at some point and cops got sent to ""police"" other countries... hey, it's not impossible."
MadMax,3c9l0z,Retlaw83,1 point,Mon Jul 6 11:14:34 2015 UTC,What he means by cop is pursuit officer in the Main Force Patrol.  They didn't retcon anything. This isn't a reboot and happens sometime after Thunderdome.
MadMax,3c9l0z,nemothorx,6,Mon Jul 6 11:23:18 2015 UTC,"Well, it's not a reboot, but it's not a continuation either. It's a reimagining and doesn't fit into the chronology of the original trilogy well (no matter where you place it, there are glaring inconsistencies)  I'm pretty sure I've seen someone (I think it was Miller, but may have been Hardy) talk about how this version of Max has a different history to the Gibson Max, but they didn't want to bore audiences with a new origin story, so just skipped it.   I'm trying to track down the relevant cite  edit: found it - it was Hardy   Then I imagined, if this is post-apocalyptic now, what kind of policeman or police officer would he be? I had him more coming from private risk management companies or from that territory — the military, special forces. So that’s why you’ve got the rig on top of the classic silhouette, and ear piece for his team. So yes police, but in a different world police kind of territory.   — http://io9.com/the-making-of-mad-max-fury-road-we-shot-one-scene-fo-1704025550"
MadMax,3c9l0z,IdiotsLantern,3,Mon Jul 6 13:34:56 2015 UTC,"It's a soft reboot. A hard reboot would have re-told the story of how he lost his family and went insane, but a soft reboot ignores or re-writes some continuity without outright throwing away the originals.  If you want to see this in continuity with the first films, and are willing to do some creative juggling, then you can, but if you want to call this a whole new universe, you can do that too."
MadMax,3c9l0z,leonryan,4,Mon Jul 6 18:17:34 2015 UTC,his black on black car wasn't exactly black either.  it stands to reason that everything would be dusty or faded.  crisp black would look wrong.

I like the pseudo-military ""final"" look with the leathers and the battle jacket, but it's not nearly as distinctive as the newish black leathers (technically vinyls) of MM1, the beat-up semi-punk survivor look of MM2, or even the Bedouin-influenced costume of MMBT."
MadMax,3c9l0z,nemothorx,1 point,Tue Jul 7 08:06:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah I prefer the MM2 and MMTD looks the most. Going to be a while before I get used to the military bag thing. I realize it's useful, but it just doesn't look that great on Mad Max imo"

There are so many amazing shots in this section. You could almost take any frame of this scene and frame it as a piece of art; each shot is so well composed!  I've seen this seven times in the theater, and at the end of this scene when the screen goes black, you can just hear the whole audience relieving their tension and leaning back in their seats.

Unless your memory is outstanding, it's possible that you simply don't remember every scene from a film you haven't seen in years.  2) Maybe you saw a shortened TV version of the film? As someone else mentioned, films are often edited for TV.  3) If you know you watched it on VHS and not on TV, then maybe the VHS that you had was recorded off TV?  Funny story about number 3. I had The Princess Bride when I was little on VHS and it was one oh my favourite movies, but I was probably missing half the film, because it was a copy my dad's friend had taped for us and he edited out the commercials by stopping the tape when one came on and then starting it again when the movie was back on. Of course, he would often forget to start recording again, so I was missing big chunks of the film after every break and when I finally saw a legitimate copy of the film, it was like a whole new movie for me. Ha."
MadMax,3c71m7,CharlieHarvey,1 point,Mon Jul 6 03:10:28 2015 UTC,"Dunno about 15 minutes, but the IMDB page on 'alternate versions' says:   TV version is cut for violence and runs 88 minutes.    http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0079501/alternateversions?ref_=tt_ql_trv_5  That's 5 minutes short of the 93minute run time of the original (so says Wikipedia)  [edit: my DVD case says 89 minutes, and has the scene you described in it. My recently purchased Blu-Ray copy says 93 minutes on the case, but I've yet to watch this disc]"

MadMax,3c71m7,nemothorx,2,Sun Jul 5 14:27:23 2015 UTC,"Thinking on this - the 89/93 minute versions is likely to be just a matter of different frame rates for the same content. Film is 24fps, but US/NTSC broadcast is 30fps. 24fps is ""stretched"" into 30fps via a method called ""3:2 pulldown"" - which results in the content running for the same length of time.  Meanwhilst AU/PAL broadcast is 25fps, and runs without any conversion, leading to an approx 4% speed-up for the same content. I'm pretty sure this 4% speedup accounts for the 93/89 minute timing difference on my DVD/BluRay copies.  However, an 88 minute US TV edit would be in context of US timings, so would indeed have 5 minutes cut, and shouldn't be confusing with the ""89 minute"" PAL encoded runtime.  tl;dr: competing frame rates makes things stupid!"

MadMax,3c56h6,randalicioso,3,Sun Jul 5 12:54:46 2015 UTC,While your editing skills are great you gave away the whole damn movie in the first five seconds of the trailer.
MadMax,3c56h6,fatty_fatshits,2,Sun Jul 5 18:07:51 2015 UTC,"The beginning was the most difficult part. There was no scene quite like the one in the trailer for Mad Max Fury Road. It had to be in or near a vehicle, as Max is listening to the radio. No scene was good enough or fitting enough. I had to settle for this one."
MadMax,3c5jce,Lopzz,4,Sun Jul 5 00:25:56 2015 UTC,I've no source but I think someone said the director said it wasn't him.
MadMax,3c5jce,matckama,5,Sun Jul 5 00:43:19 2015 UTC,I think it was a nod to the Gyro Captain.
MadMax,3c5jce,LongHorsa,5,Sun Jul 5 15:40:45 2015 UTC,The googles don't even look similar.
MadMax,3c5jce,Heartless_level,2,Sun Jul 5 02:35:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm with Heartless - the appearance is similar, but not enough for it to be the same.  I like the idea though, maybe it suggests that the Gyro pilot wasn't the only one with a Gyro in the Mad Max universe?"
MadMax,3c5jce,HarlequinWasTaken,5,Sun Jul 5 02:40:54 2015 UTC,Or the only one to have a cap with goggles on it?

MadMax,3c5jce,drevill,1 point,Sun Jul 5 17:22:19 2015 UTC,"It isn't him. The Gyro Captain wouldn't be the only person in the world to have the bright idea to put his goggles on top of his cap.  Also, why would you want him to be dead? If Max is still alive then the Captain could still be alive too (in that he wouldn't have died of old age yet). According to the end of Road Warrior the Gyro Captain became the leader of the tribe, so assuming that Fury Road comes after Road Warrior and assuming that there's any sort of logical timeline to these films, I would rather imagine the Gyro Captain as alive and leading his tribe than dead with his head on a lance."

MadMax,3c3n0a,McWeaksauce91,14,Sat Jul 4 13:18:24 2015 UTC,"This was a very informative post - I was definitely curious about the medical accuracy of those procedures, as movies (even great ones) so often do a terrible job of presenting remotely accurate medical scenarios. George Miller truly showed a lot of intelligence and practicality in directing this film, relying not only on his own expertise but also knowing when to call on other experts to get the best information.  Given your description, it seems plausible that Max likely could have learned those techniques as part of his police training, or observed them in the field."
MadMax,3c3n0a,PipeOrganEnthusiast,9,Sat Jul 4 14:15:31 2015 UTC,This is an absolute possibility. Lots of police officers these days are basically medically trained. Now the maneuvers max performed are those of a skilled technical medical individual. That being said in the wasted land I wouldn't be surprised if they had to learn these techniques!
MadMax,3c3n0a,IdiotsLantern,8,Sat Jul 4 14:30:47 2015 UTC,"It's interesting that Max knew how to treat Furiosa, but not how to diagnose her. One of the Vuvolini had to tell him what was wrong before he knew what to do.   On that same note, the Vuvolini know what's happening, but from their attitudes they don't seem to think there's much that can be done to save her. When Max is treating Furiosa, it's the Dag and Capable who are helping him, not the Vuvolini.   Maybe the Vuvolini's knowledge came before the collapse, and she really never adjusted from hospital medicine to combat medicine.... somehow, even after fifty years of people getting hurt in the Wasteland. I admit it doesn't sound very likely."
MadMax,3c3n0a,Malkav1379,6,Sat Jul 4 16:52:37 2015 UTC,"Max knew how to treat Furiosa, but not how to diagnose her.   That was right after or during a big action scene, right?  He may have been stuck in combat mindset at the time, but medical training kicked in once the Vuvolini pointed out what was going on.  Just a theory."
MadMax,3c3n0a,IdiotsLantern,4,Sat Jul 4 19:11:19 2015 UTC,"He may have been stuck in combat mindset at the time   Well, in a way he's still fighting. Piercing her chest and then inserting the needle are very physical, even kind of brutal, things to do to someone. That's why he keeps saying ""sorry,"" and making comforting noises. He feels bad that he's hurting her, even if it's to save her.   And there's limits to his training. From his technique, he's clearly not an expert at sticking needles into people. He got it done, but it wasn't a very neat job."
MadMax,3c3n0a,IdiotsLantern,5,Sat Jul 4 19:37:35 2015 UTC,That's an extremely interesting point. Maybe she knew what was happening and didn't know how to solve it? Maybe she has had a negative outlook? I mean furiosa has a Long long road ahead of her as far as recovery goes post movie. I never thought about that!
MadMax,3c3n0a,CharlieHarvey,5,Sat Jul 4 18:53:32 2015 UTC,"Maybe she knew what was happening and didn't know how to solve it? Maybe she has had a negative outlook?   Why wouldn't she, though, if Max is able to stabilize Furiosa with relatively low-tech combat medicine?  Maybe she never really adjusted to not having a whole hospital of resources at her disposal, even after fifty years in the wasteland? Or maybe the way she specifically was broken involved watching so many people die who could have been easily saved long ago that she no longer believes in her ability to do anything? Or maybe she sees the severity of Furiosa's wound, and figures even if she's stabilized it's going to be a very long time before she'll be in any shape to climb around moving trucks or fire giant rifles, and the general rule seems to be if you can't fight, you aren't going to live very long? There's no such thing as a quiet field hospital in the Wasteland.  ...Actually, it just occurred to me... maybe the reason the Vuvolini doesn't try and treat her is because they don't treat injuries that severe: if someone is too hurt to ride, they make a sad sign, end it quickly, make another sad sign, and keep moving? It'd be hard, heartbreaking, but maybe if they set up a tent and wait for the person to get better, they will all die?  ... It sounds pretty brutal for those nice old ladies, but... no one said life in the wastes is pretty. Their survival depends on staying mobile and taking out threats from a safe distance. Maybe they just can't take the risk, and that's why they seem resolved to the fact that one way or another, Furiosa is done."
MadMax,3c3n0a,IdiotsLantern,3,Sat Jul 4 20:21:43 2015 UTC,"That's an interesting take on it. That's axrually a pretty common ""survival attitude"". It's like when do the costs out weigh the benefit. Why wait for someone to heal and dump supplies into them whn you could solve the supplies and do more"
MadMax,3c3n0a,TWK128,5,Sat Jul 4 20:38:00 2015 UTC,"It's possible that he's just heard the tidbit before that this is what you do when someone's lung is collapsed, but hasn't been around enough collapsed lungs to have immediately realized that that was what was wrong with her? Or he'd seen it done before, but again, isn't around enough collapsed lungs to instantly recognize what was happening?  An example of this might be: lots of people have heard that when someone is having a seizure you have to put something between their teeth so they don't bite or swallow their tongue, but most people have probably never seen a seizure, so it could be realistic for someone to see someone having one and say, 'What's wrong with him?' and then when they're told, 'He's having a seizure,' they might say, 'Put something between his teeth so he doesn't bite his tongue off.' Even though a moment ago they didn't even know what was wrong."
MadMax,3c3n0a,IdiotsLantern,1 point,Sat Jul 4 22:19:52 2015 UTC,"That's possible... I have a hard time imagining Max hasn't seen a lot of injuries (or at least a lot of violent death), but maybe what was happening to Furiosa was different, and he remembered his field medicine once he knew what was wrong with her."
MadMax,3c3n0a,TWK128,1 point,Sun Jul 5 01:04:29 2015 UTC,"Maybe she'd seen a collapsed lung in her youth, so she recognized the sound, but had never been a medical doctor or nurse herself.

MadMax,3c3n0a,avanns,2,Sun Jul 5 00:13:33 2015 UTC,"She knew the technical term for loosing all of your blood. I think she had some medical knowledge. Maybe she'd been a nurse once or was training to be one before the apocalypse happened, and still remembers some of the books she read."

MadMax,3c3n0a,IdiotsLantern,3,Sat Jul 4 18:57:27 2015 UTC,I'm not sure on this but I heard you can't do person to person blood transfusions because the plasma might not match.
MadMax,3c3n0a,CharlieHarvey,9,Sat Jul 4 14:42:57 2015 UTC,"That is a risk. But the risk is fairly minimal considering considering O pos is universal. Theres always riskes with blood transfusion. the other option is death so....  The blood is considered ""whole blood"" when it leaves your body. Whole blood is the best kindve transfusion you want considering it has everything in it (RBC, Platelets, plasma)."
MadMax,3c3n0a,Qarlo,6,Sat Jul 4 14:45:52 2015 UTC,"Max is actually O neg (look at his back tattoo), which is the complete universal donor.  Edit: oops I think I'm wrong, the tattoo says  ""O- plus Hi-octane"". Of course even if he is O pod he could donate to someone Rh negative once."
MadMax,3c3n0a,IdiotsLantern,5,Sat Jul 4 15:32:31 2015 UTC,"Ah yes pregnant women too!! I was actually going to make a mention that you can't give o pos to a pregnant woman. Good catch. I'm not sure how the civilian world works but in military we use O pos, just because o neg is a lot more uncommon. So we save it for when it's needed most"
MadMax,3c3n0a,Qarlo,2,Sat Jul 4 15:34:35 2015 UTC,"Remember when Organic tells the guy with the cattle prod, ""Careful, he's a universal doner!"" Looks like O negative is still pretty uncommon, so as a healthy, physically fit o-negative full life, Max is a valuable catch and they don't want to be excessively rough with him.   ... This comes right before they chain him to a car and send him into battle where absolutely anything could happen, so I guess he wasn't that important. Or maybe that's just what blood bags are for."
MadMax,3c3n0a,IdiotsLantern,3,Sat Jul 4 16:32:56 2015 UTC,"When Joe says go and they take all the war boys, I think you sacrifice the blood bag to get the breeders back."
MadMax,3c3n0a,LogicalTimber,1 point,Sat Jul 4 16:49:56 2015 UTC,I don't think Joe really thinks much about the Blood Bags.
MadMax,3c3n0a,Derpatologist_7,1 point,Sat Jul 4 17:04:00 2015 UTC,"I think that they probably try to keep their blood-bags for as long as possible, but some people don't take to captivity and the fact that Max already escaped once and was vicious enough that he needs to be muzzled, it's possible that they don't have much hope of him 'thriving' in captivity.  I'm sure they figure that he'd going to keep making escape attempts and attacking them until they have to kill him or he'd otherwise die prematurely somehow. Might as well make use of him while they can!"
MadMax,3c3n0a,IdiotsLantern,1 point,Sat Jul 4 22:19:44 2015 UTC,I think they're there to be used up.
MadMax,3c3n0a,Derpatologist_7,1 point,Sat Jul 4 16:45:52 2015 UTC,"Possible, but how common can healthy o-negatives be in this environment? Plus he's fit, so give him a diet with a lot of iron in it and he'll make blood for you forever.  But he clearly wasn't the only Blood Bag they had, so I think if you aren't suitable for that, and they have no other use for you, why bother keeping you?"
MadMax,3c3n0a,nemothorx,2,Sat Jul 4 16:51:59 2015 UTC,"Well, and it was a pretty heavy-duty situation, what with the wives stolen. In ordinary times maybe they go a little easier to stretch out the blood bag's useful life a bit."
MadMax,3c3n0a,DeCoder68W,4,Sat Jul 4 17:10:58 2015 UTC,Now that we are on the subject I wonder how the organic tested the blood? Do you think joe actually had the equipment?
MadMax,3c3n0a,DeCoder68W,6,Sat Jul 4 15:36:28 2015 UTC,"He's got to have had something. Whether that something would look anything like the equipment a modern medic would use is... less certain. It's supposed to be roughly fifty or sixty years after the end of the world, so if those machines are still working, they've been repaired in some very creative ways. Still, people don't stop being smart just because it's the apocalypse and if you really need a blood-test machine, you'll find some way to get what you need.   Or maybe the Organic, lacking fancy electronics, found some way to create a testing system where he adds a sample from the new ""arrival"" to samples who's type is known, and then watches the reaction.... I don't know, I just made that up."
MadMax,3c3n0a,IdiotsLantern,3,Sat Jul 4 16:23:44 2015 UTC,"If that's actually possible, it'd make a lot of sense. Good idea."
MadMax,3c3n0a,DeCoder68W,1 point,Sat Jul 4 17:51:19 2015 UTC,"Where did you get the 50 to 60 years after the end of the world number from? I know there's not a firm time line but if Mad Max 1 was set around mid '90s, Max was early 20s, and at that stage the world hadn't yet fully gone to crap then by your dates Max would be 70-80 years old. I think it's 20 years tops since the world was killed and Fury Road set around 2020."
MadMax,3c3n0a,JohnCodmanlives,3,Sat Jul 4 21:49:59 2015 UTC,"I got it from George Miller  ""I view it as more revisiting the world, but the chronology is not exact...this one's set around forty-five to fifty years from next Wednesday when all the bad things we read in the news happen all at once.""   And personally, I'm not going to worry too much about how this movie sits in chronology with the other films, mostly because George Miller himself doesn't seem too worried about it. For all we know, the first movie was set in the 90s, but it was the 2090s or 2190s and we are seeing society regress as institutions crumble. And Max could be a ""cop"" but not a cop like we know cops. Maybe the world didn't collapse all at once and the heavily militarized Australian police force was one of the last to go, hanging in there decades after almost everything else was gone. We don't know. It's pretty vague."
MadMax,3c3n0a,IdiotsLantern,2,Sat Jul 4 22:28:44 2015 UTC,Good enough for me. Thanks.
MadMax,3c3n0a,badboy5166,1 point,Sat Jul 4 22:40:55 2015 UTC,"Maybe the world didn't collapse all at once   It didn't in the Mel Gibson Max, so I think it's a very reasonable assumption that the Hardy version of Max has a similarly 'collapsed in stages' history.  (also, thanks for the reminder of the 7:30 interview again. I saw it on original broadcast, and just love how humble and softly spoken Miller is)"

MadMax,3c8fe7,Asterra2,12,Sun Jul 5 21:41:11 2015 UTC,"You seem to be discounting the possibility that frame dropping was a specific stylistic effect that Miller was going for - that's the impression I've gotten based on other mentions about the framedropping in Fury Road. It helps tie the movie stylistic in with the earlier ones (especially MM and MM2, I'm not sure if it was used in Beyond Thunderdome)  Based on his interviews about the editing process and how he specifically wanted Margaret Sixel (his wife, and who has never edited an action movie), I've not gotten the impression that he was ""hovering"" over her (or anyone else involved in the editing)"
MadMax,3c8fe7,nemothorx,-8,Sun Jul 5 22:19:36 2015 UTC,"Let me just say that to allow for this possibility is too magnanimous.  Truly so.  The intended framerate could have been achieved with under-cranking, and a herky-jerky aesthetic could have been engendered with a different shutter speed, but both of those would have needed to have been decided upon ahead of the fact.  If it's too late, it's too late.  Dropping frames can be done whenever.  Check the wiki on this movie to glean insight into the director's methods in the editing room (insofar as this specific movie)."
MadMax,3c8fe7,nemothorx,10,Sun Jul 5 22:25:48 2015 UTC,"chaging framerate more smoothly than blunt frame dropping is also ignoring what can be achieved with digital interpolation these days.   If frames were hard dropped, then it seems much more likely that it's a deliberate choice.    The director needs to figure out what speed he wants the action to be before he shoots.   That seems to fundamentally ignore the point of the editing process, which is to make decisions about the final product after the shoot."
MadMax,3c8fe7,IdiotsLantern,6,Sun Jul 5 23:12:59 2015 UTC,"Particularly important in Fury Road's case, where I think the total amount of footage was some 400+ hours. Not story, necessarily, just coverage.   That's a big job for any editor. Fury Road was 8 months of shooting, around two years in post, and I think the final cut was delivered less then two weeks before it's first scheduled screening at Cannes so they were still working on it right up until the last second. That it holds together at all, let alone came out a new high water mark for the action genre, is astounding."

MadMax,3c8fe7,IdiotsLantern,7,Sun Jul 5 23:37:13 2015 UTC,"I do too. I just disagree with the thesis that because it's not how time manipulation is ""supposed"" to be done, that it's somehow a mistake or a movie-breaking thing.   But maybe I'm just sad the movie left theaters without out-performing ""San Andreas,"" and was murdered dead by the arrival of ""Jurassic World the Video Game."" This is why we can't have nice things..."
MadMax,3c8fe7,nemothorx,3,Sun Jul 5 23:40:05 2015 UTC,"I want to just call it ""Jurassic World the Video Game"" all the time now, but I feel that that's a bit unfair till I at least see it for myself. That's unlikely to be in the cinemas.   Otoh, I did see Terminator:Genisys The Video Game last week! :)"
MadMax,3c8fe7,nemothorx,-2,Mon Jul 6 08:22:01 2015 UTC,"That's precisely the problem, though.  It is a movie-breaking thing, in my case.  I will almost certainly never watch it again, because in the end I would be just as thoroughly distracted by the Youtube-like jerkiness as I was at the theater.  Maybe some patient soul will, one day, reconstruct the movie scene by scene with interpolation software.  Or maybe the studio will do it themselves.  They can call it the ""no migraine"" edition."
MadMax,3c8fe7,nemothorx,3,Mon Jul 6 13:54:34 2015 UTC,"It is a movie-breaking thing, in my case   I wonder just how many people have this issue with the movie though? You are literally the first person I've seen register this complaint. (and I've talked to some very movie savvy friends - some of whom hated the movie for other reasons and seemed to want to jump on any chance to criticise it, and even they haven't mentioned the frame dropping as being an issue beyond ""didn't like it"" (also, the plot, characters, acting, choreography, and colour grading... )"
MadMax,3c8fe7,nemothorx,5,Mon Jul 6 14:12:58 2015 UTC,"When I said I got the impression that the frame dropping was deliberate, it was from mentions like this:   John Seale did the vibrant cinematography, he and Miller judiciously dropping frames to create jittery images of mayhem and melee   http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2015/05/mad-max-fury-road-review  When you say ""the wiki"", links would be great, thanks. But I think I found what you were referring to via a post on /r/filmmakers ...linking to a comment within the post that sums it up for me:   It was crazy, and it worked, and I loved it.   https://www.reddit.com/r/Filmmakers/comments/3636rj/frame_rate_the_saving_private_ryan_effect_and_mad/crate93"
MadMax,3c8fe7,IdiotsLantern,-2,Sun Jul 5 23:22:05 2015 UTC,"It was crazy, yes.  But I don't view the effort through the same rose-tinted glasses.  The dropped frames smack of a specific breed of laziness, reinforced particular by the fact that the phenomenon is exactly what one gets when something has in fact gone wrong (problems with encoding, playback, incompatibility between framerate and display device, etc.) as well as the simple truth that a jerky framerate - especially one whose jerkiness is manifestly inconsistent - looks awful and challenges one not to develop a headache, in the literal sense."
MadMax,3c8fe7,IdiotsLantern,3,Mon Jul 6 14:03:16 2015 UTC,"Oscar winning Director and Cinematographer... lazy?  Sorry, don't buy it - and neither did it give me a headache or threaten to.   It sucks that it clearly bugs you - and I sympathise - sometimes there are elements of films (technical and/or plotwise) that bug the HELL out of me. And it's worse when nobody else seems to care, and/or it's deliberate on the part of the film maker. So yes, I understand your frustration.   I just don't share it, and until proven otherwise, I stand by the impression I've gotten that the hard frame dropping was a deliberate stylistic choice that harks back to the original trilogy where it was also used."
MadMax,3c8fe7,IdiotsLantern,3,Mon Jul 6 14:08:50 2015 UTC,"I saw the film six times, once in 3D. No headaches. Did I do it wrong?"
MadMax,3c8fe7,nemothorx,2,Mon Jul 6 21:16:16 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind, George Miller has never shot a digital live action film before. So it'd make sense if he just had a lot less respect for the technical aspects of how digital film speed manipulation is supposed to work. When in doubt, he can always just say, ""it's MAD MAX, it's supposed to look rough!"" and keep right on doing what he wants to do."
MadMax,3c8fe7,IdiotsLantern,-4,Sun Jul 5 23:30:56 2015 UTC,"I think that's what's going on in this case.  I'm the director, this is my vision, therefore it is above technical reproach.  I personally suspect that the dropped frames are nothing less than the consequence of a director demanding speed changes for scenes when those demands were not compatible with a satisfactory end result.  But that suspicion is irrelevant; the fact of the matter is that the result is bad.  If the movie hadn't been any good, nobody would be defending the awfulness of the phenomenon.  That is a guarantee."
MadMax,3c8fe7,nemothorx,5,Mon Jul 6 14:08:44 2015 UTC,"I personally suspect that the dropped frames are nothing less than the consequence of a director demanding speed changes for scenes when those demands were not compatible with a satisfactory end result.   You have no actual evidence to back this up, especially with the editor being George's wife (and unlike him, she has worked digital quite a bit), and John Seale the cinematographer talking about dropping frames as a stylistic choice. Either way, I think you are doing quite a bit of over-valuing how much the general person is going to really care about frame-rates.    the fact of the matter is that the result is bad.   What makes it bad? Why? I keep waiting for you to explain what the big problem with doing it this way, besides that you, personally, didn't like it."
MadMax,3c8fe7,IdiotsLantern,2,Mon Jul 6 21:15:03 2015 UTC,"nobody but you is complaining about it! It's just you! (I wont be so egotistical to guarantee it, but the ball is in your court to find a second who agrees with you)"
MadMax,3c8fe7,nemothorx,-2,Mon Jul 6 14:14:02 2015 UTC,"Nobody has it in their bluray player yet.  Anyway, I already got promoted from ""what jerkiness?"" to ""it was intended"".  I can wait a bit for the questioning to begin in earnest."
MadMax,3c8fe7,nemothorx,3,Mon Jul 6 14:18:52 2015 UTC,We noticed the jerkiness. It gave the film a rough quality. I don't understand why you think it's such a problem.
MadMax,3c8fe7,IdiotsLantern,2,Mon Jul 6 21:11:21 2015 UTC,"well, the first question seems fair for someone to ask since a lot of people didn't notice it, or all of it (I only noticed it consistently with the buzzards, though others have said they noticed it in a few other scenes). shrugs  There might be some murmurings of questioning, but I doubt there will be any major 'WTF' reactions that you seem to expect."
MadMax,3c8fe7,JeffBaugh2,8,Mon Jul 6 14:22:30 2015 UTC,"I'll freely admit I'm a neophyte when it comes to technical stuff. But in an era when almost every other action film looks like the director playing video games, even capes are CGI, practical creatures are painted over in post, if dropped frames and manipulated film speeds are the price of shooting live on location rather then in a studio against a green screen...   Screw it. I'll take it."
MadMax,3c8fe7,Turbofurball,-1,Sun Jul 5 23:09:43 2015 UTC,"Well, not to derail the point of this thread, but the tradeoff for all those practical effects, in this case, is that many of the environments are thoroughly artificial, and generally in ways that the only positive spin possible is ""artistic"".  I almost laughed out loud during the nighttime scene that was clearly broad daylight with a very heavy, dark purple filter over the entire scene.  I mean, the last time that technique was used was in the '60s I think."
MadMax,3c8fe7,supersaw7,5,Mon Jul 6 13:58:33 2015 UTC,"Day for night was common in the 80s in fact.   This is a great read about some of the FX in Fury Road, and has a segment specifically about the day-for-night shooting was setup (by overexposing and grading, rather than underexposing and blue filter).

MadMax,3c8fe7,supersaw7,0,Mon Jul 6 14:18:56 2015 UTC,Overexposing?  I would never have guessed that.  My takeaway from that sequence was that everything looked flat - the darkest darks were like 20% away from black.

That move's not so likely to break a limb, but watch the fabric running behind her right knee - I'm told the friction can be enough to melt clothing if you're not careful. Aerials are fun, and more painful but not actually as dangerous as it looks. As long as you stay away from the war boy mentality, anyway."
MadMax,3c2uqd,LogicalTimber,2,Sat Jul 4 08:59:50 2015 UTC,".... Ya know, I'm remembering how George Miller was certain that the Polecats couldn't be done practically and would have to be superimposed, and then the stunt team brought in Cirque du Soleil acrobats and showed how those things could actually be done safely with the right training and gear.   ... Now I'm wondering what sort of post-apocalyptic action aerial silks might lend themselves to. Not vehicles, obviously, but some kind of elevated stronghold might use them to ambush people..."
MadMax,3c2uqd,IdiotsLantern,2,Sat Jul 4 18:24:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah, from a circus perspective what the Polecats are doing isn't that physically difficult. They just have to climb the poles, then they have footrests and safety harnesses at the top. It's the swinging back and forth on moving vehicles part that is nuts. :-) (This is much closer to the limits of what can be done on the swinging Chinese pole, which is the closest act to the polecats. Also, this woman is ungodly strong.)   I've heard fan suggestions that between the geography of the Citadel and the various gear hanging off the war boys' belts, they probably spend a lot of time climbing, which makes sense. If you want a circus act that fits in the Mad Max world, I'm partial to this straps act, or the appropriately-named wheel of death."

Car Wars is a game featuring freeways of the future in which the right of way goes to those with the biggest guns. Players choose their vehicle — complete with weapons, armor, power plants, suspension, and even body style — then they take them out on the road, either to come home as ""aces"", or to crash and burn. If a driver survives, his abilities improve and he can earn money to buy bigger and better cars. Advanced rules let players design their own customized cars, trucks, and cycles.

This is a re-release of Formula DÃ© with several changes from the original format. Whilst old tracks can be used with the updated Formula D rules, the new game features boards that have an F1 track and a Street Track on the other side. These street tracks each have a novel inclusion or two to add greater theme -  The game mechanisms are a simple race, get to the finish line first!  However, players have to use a significant amount of planning, and rely on quite a bit of luck.  Each player manages when to shift gears, with each gear providing a different speed.  (For example, 4th gear is a die that rolls random numbers from 7 to 12 for spaces moved.)  Each turn, players may move up one gear, stay in that gear, or move down gears.  This forces players to match possible rolls with the optimum distance for that turn, and hopefully plan ahead.  However, speed is not the only issue!  Corners have a ""stop"" rule that requires players to stop once, twice, or three times on that corner in consecutive turns or face a penalty.  This creates an effective speed limit to the corners.   Of course, things do not always go as planned!  Players take penalties if they miss their roll, bump into another car, are blocked by other cars, have to brake heavily, or have to downshift several gears.  These are taken off of a car’s attributes (Tire health, Brake wear, Transmission Gears, Body, engine, and Suspension).  Losing the maximum in any of these categories will result in elimination, or a severe setback for that car.  This requires that players manage their car’s health, plan for their best path, and have good luck on their rolls.  This high amount of luck gives the game its family appeal, and lets weaker players have a chance at winning once in a while.  However, the fun does not end with a single race!  The rules include the ability to customize your cars, use a pre-generated character, add Slipstreaming (Drafting) rules and road debris, and change tire types to modify your distance rolls.  There are also variations for a single lap race, or multiple laps with pit stops to repair some of your damage points.  In addition, numerous expansion tracks can be purchased to vary the demands on each driver and car.  Each track may also have weather effects (rain) that change car handling and die rolls due to skidding on wet track.  This opens up the game for rally rules giving championship points over a number of races.  Formula D adds a few items that are not in the original Formula De:  There is the added excitement of illegal racing in the streets of big cities - anything goes!  This adds custom cars, nitro acceleration, drifting in the curves, dirty tricks, gun battles, and trash on the road to add more variation.  A basic change is the use of a ""Dashboard"" with movable pegs to manage your car’s attributes instead of the paper forms from Formula De.  There are also two sets of pre-painted cars; a Formula 1 set and the Street Race set of stock cars.  The street cars come with ""Character"" profiles to give a bit of role-playing to the game.  Finally, the old category of ""Fuel"" for the car has been renamed Transmission Wear to give a better thematic fit to the effect of multiple downshifting.  The popularity of this game has given it a lot of expansions, some simplifications to the rules (See Formula DÃ© Mini), and a lot of ""after market"" parts.  There are also fan expansions and tracks for the very dedicated player.  In many ways, this has become a multiple game system."
MadMax,3c0p05,dragoth13,1 point,Fri Jul 3 23:06:45 2015 UTC,"If you can handle roguelike RPGs, Cataclysm: Dark Days ahead is probably the best post-apocalyptic game because you can make and live out of Mad Max style vehicles and customize them in a lot of ways with spikes, armor, auto-turrets, and rams for running down psycho survivors, eldritch horrors, zombie hordes, and hallucinations of cannibal Shia LaBeouf"
MadMax,3c2se0,PenMadeMightier,1 point,Sat Jul 4 05:43:07 2015 UTC,"To summarize, I made that video to talk about how much I loved Fury Road, and while it was fun to make and watch, I really wanna talk about how cool the ideas were!  I've never seen a movie so well laid-out! I didn't need a map to understand how the general area worked, major landmarks are pretty easy, and the names of the cities were great!  Bullet Farm - It farms black powder and makes them into bullets, presumably! SMART! The audience doesn't even have to think to understand it! Same with Gas Town!  The most complicated city was Joe's, but they showed you why his stuff worked in the opening scenes!   All in all, I adored Fury Road. I just love Mad Max in general. Did you guys love this stuff too?"
MadMax,3c2se0,guacamelon,1 point,Sat Jul 4 05:45:48 2015 UTC,"Are the landscapes any more complicated in Mad Max 1-3? I still need to find a way to watch those.   It's nice to know where places are located relative to where the characters are, but I think the simple names help better.   I'm not sure it's fair to compare Mad Max to LOTR since the size of both the land and story are completely different. The names in LOTR can't really be ""simple"" because it's a fantasy world. It works better as a book because a map is given for the audience (I believe)."
MadMax,3c2se0,nemothorx,1 point,Sat Jul 4 07:24:59 2015 UTC,"I can see that thought, but the Riders of Rohan had a pretty simple name. It was easy to see Rohan as a horse-based economy (which turns out to be correct) and no one has to think too hard.   But there is indeed a map in the book.   Having seen 2 of the older MM films, they never really talk too much about locations or distance or direction too often. It's pretty new and it made the film feel very complete in a cool way."
MadMax,3bzd9c,BSS616,11,Fri Jul 3 11:16:33 2015 UTC,I think that line had to do with working for Joe in general rather than something specifically to do with the wives
MadMax,3bzd9c,ofthedappersort,6,Fri Jul 3 14:03:28 2015 UTC,I regret that comic had nothing to do with what she actually did for Joe.   .... It's one of the many things I regret about that comic.
MadMax,3bzd9c,IdiotsLantern,0,Fri Jul 3 20:02:18 2015 UTC,"Oh you. That comic really bummed you out, didn't it?"
MadMax,3bzd9c,Derpatologist_7,6,Sat Jul 4 11:50:07 2015 UTC,"The thought was brought up.  That maybe if she wasn't involved in capturing those wives specifically, she may have been involved in other kidnap raids or at least done some pretty dang distasteful stuff to rise to a position of power in Joe's army."
MadMax,3bzd9c,skonen_blades,10,Fri Jul 3 16:47:37 2015 UTC,"Probably not, in the Furiosa comic is seems they don't recognise her beyond from the citadel and being and Imperator."
MadMax,3bzd9c,memberzs,5,Fri Jul 3 13:58:58 2015 UTC,"In my head cannon (haven't read any of the comics yet) I believe that Furiosa and her mother were originally captured to become wives, but then Furiosa turned out to be barren from the radiation (which also caused her to be born without an arm). So she was able to make a life for herself within the Citadel as one of the only women not a milk mother or a wife, but managing to become an Imperator."
MadMax,3bzd9c,CrystalElyse,4,Fri Jul 3 15:25:27 2015 UTC,"I don't have a source at the moment, but I think I read somewhere that Furiosa lost her arm in a battle. But otherwise, I love that theory!"
MadMax,3bzd9c,Werewolfinmychair,1 point,Fri Jul 3 20:17:42 2015 UTC,IIRC Furiosa's infertility and her losing an arm in battle (not at birth) were both confirmed by Charlize Theron and Miller. Don't have a source handy.

We took three trailers which we liked the best (1, 2, 3), threw some ideas around and soon wrote the script remaking every scene from the trailers. With the help of some friends (who thought we were crazy and mostly had no idea what the hell was going on) we shot the scenes and soon finally finished this little project.

MadMax,3bv3bg,jahoodunrama,2,Fri Jul 3 03:17:41 2015 UTC,That is a fantastic insight
MadMax,3bv3bg,Turbofurball,24,Fri Jul 3 08:55:00 2015 UTC,"Anyone who says Charlize is overrated doesn't know what they're talking about. I've watched all of her films and even if some films fell flat, she always gave fantastic performances in them. Sometimes saying so much while actually saying very little.  There's a shot of her in 'Young Adult' - for example - that covers a range of emotions. And it's just a shot that lingers on her reaction. There have been a few who have accused her of relying on a physical transformation to carry a performance. But she looks exactly like she usually does in Young Adult and still gives an impressive performance.  Tom Hardy is also a fantastic diverse actor. And, just like Charlize, he says so much with his eyes in this movie.  I'm so glad George had enough faith in his cast to carry entire scenes with very little to no dialogue. It certainly paid off. I'd like to see more films like this and Under the Skin that don't rely on paragraphs of exposition."
MadMax,3bv3bg,VforVickers,4,Thu Jul 2 13:51:48 2015 UTC,"I also feel the way the it was filmed gives a lot of story telling. Nice, beautiful, still shots of the scenery or the expression everyone has at a given time. No shaky cam experience. It really paints a picture and tells a story in itself and I loved that it was filmed that way."
MadMax,3bv3bg,iJYDx,13,Thu Jul 2 23:04:59 2015 UTC,You're so right. Much of the best acting in this movie is done without dialogue. Fitting for a movie that supposedly had storyboards instead of a script.
MadMax,3bv3bg,Karasu-sama,11,Thu Jul 2 12:21:48 2015 UTC,I can't wait to get this movie on DvD for a rewatch and find little nuggets of gold like the one you've mentioned.   Nice find! 👍
MadMax,3bv3bg,Keeper-of-Balance,9,Thu Jul 2 13:19:34 2015 UTC,"Another favourite is after Max gets shot with the crossbow, and gets in The People Eater's War Rig.  He sits in the driver's seat, reaches his hand out the open window, and slaps his palm on the door.  That smack of his hand pushes the bolt flush of his palm, so he can pull it out.  It's just a quick little motion, but it's perfect."
MadMax,3bv3bg,Andrew_W_Kennedy,6,Thu Jul 2 15:15:35 2015 UTC,"Another interesting thing about that shot is Furiosa just saved him from falling off the rig. She caught him with her robot arm and his weight started popping the straps off before Nux kicked him onto the People Eater's rig.    Just as Max is popping the bolt out of his left hand, Furiosa is fixing her left arm by redoing the straps. It's one of many parallels that the film draws between the two of them through subtle actions."
MadMax,3bv3bg,Derpatologist_7,3,Thu Jul 2 19:31:35 2015 UTC,"That one I missed.  Time for another viewing, I guess"
MadMax,3bv3bg,Keeper-of-Balance,3,Fri Jul 3 00:16:13 2015 UTC,"At first I thought he'd already removed the bolt and he then put his hand outside the cabin for a brief moment and was shot again, and I remember thinking, what are the chances? On my second viewing it's when I noticed he was pounding the bolt out. So metal."
MadMax,3bv3bg,Dr__Apocalypse,2,Thu Jul 2 21:40:33 2015 UTC,Yeah! That one I did catch on my first watch. It was awesome.  Especially since he walked around for a bit with the bolt half lodged in his head haha!

Toast getting and then explaining it for him saved everyone a lot of time.   Toast didn't wait for anyone to ask her to speak or do anything. She took inventory and then kept track of it, so Max and Furiosa had one less thing to think about. Plus she can drive and shoot. What's annoying about that?"

As for the knee brace, I think it's fitting that it's the whole legend angle. No two people are going to remember the same exact details. One person might say,""he had this metal knee brace with a hinge and also wore a jacket"" and the next guy might say, ""he had this black leather jacket with a shoulder pad and he also had something on his knee""  There's also the whole issue of the kid going with the tribe and then ending up as their leader not fitting with the theory of him becoming a roving wanderer who has hallucinations of max's son."

Also, she was the lead, not co-lead.  Like I said, should have been called Mad Maxine and flashback boy.  If this is what is required of action movies now, the genre has gone to shit.

MadMax,3c1r5u,nemothorx,10,Fri Jul 3 23:46:36 2015 UTC,I'm not good at biology what so ever so this could be false but I thought that having some fat on you allows for more milk to be made
MadMax,3c1r5u,nemothorx,2,Sat Jul 4 00:00:24 2015 UTC,"Yup, this is why women with eating disorders won't get pregnant; if the woman's body is too undernourished to sustain ITSELF then it certainly can't support a child."
MadMax,3c1r5u,nemothorx,-36,Sat Jul 4 00:10:56 2015 UTC,"Not at all.  Being extremely skinny OR fat (basically, unhealthy) is bad for milk production. Unhealthy female = unhealthy milk production.  Just because she is huge does not mean there are any more milk glands. It just means her body has to work MUCH harder to produce the milk."
MadMax,3c1r5u,_Phie_,21,Sun Jul 5 20:25:58 2015 UTC,"There are two good reasons that they would be fat, one from an in-universe and one from filmmaking perspective.   Joe keeps them basically immobile. Their lives look like they amount to eating, sleeping, and being milked. Having them be fat and imprisoned like they are brings the image of cattle to mind, so it reinforces the whole ""Joe is literally using people like farm animals"" impression in the audience's mind."
MadMax,3c1r5u,TotesMessenger,-30,Sat Jul 4 00:27:59 2015 UTC,"A super overweight person is not going to produce quality milk.  Fat does not = mammary glands.   I'd say it's more so the ""bigger"" crowd feels included. This movie was a feminist / lesbian wet dream."

MadMax,3bvygt,SmokeyPeanutRic,6,Fri Jul 3 10:47:46 2015 UTC,"Filmmaking isn't something you really retire from. I think George will probably keep working for as long as he's alive and people are willing to give him money.   That said... one option he's floated is that he might open ""Mad Max"" up, like Disney with Star Wars, and let other directors make movies set 'in universe.' Personally, I think it'd be interesting to see Mel Gibson write and direct (but not appear in) a Mad Max movie. But whether he'd be directing Tom Hardy or whoever will be after Tom Hardy... Who knows?   ... But I can't see an open universe working if Max has to be in every movie. One reason the Star Wars movies are looking so good is the universe is so big that each film can have it's own setting and characters without breaking the world. If Max has to be the lead to make it official, then we are either going to wind up with a lot of different Max's, or we might need to start calling the series something else.  Still, if you pulled it off, there's basically limiteless possibilities. How about a movie all about Auntie Entity and Bartertown? How about a movie set in the Citadel, following a War Boy as he grows up under the new Lady Immortan? Or a road movie about a roving biker gang praying on settlers but told from the gang's point of view?   For me, one of the worst options would be to do a remake or hard reboot of the first Mad Max movies. I think George (and possibly Mel too) will have to die before it's an option, but I can see 10 or so years down the line, some Micheal Bay producer type thinking, ""hm, this has name recognition, lets redo it with modern special effects and sell it to 20-somethings."" I just can't see that ending well."
MadMax,3bvygt,IdiotsLantern,4,Thu Jul 2 20:58:55 2015 UTC,"I think they should keep the movies about Mad Max.  I think doing otherwise would be like making a James Bond movie about someone other then James Bond.  The could make an ""expanded universe"", but I'd rather all we ever know about this world be from the perspective of Max's adventures.  Play with the idea that the stories are more of exaggerated tales of a folk hero, but like James Bond never be clear as to is he's really just one man, or if it's a title that's been given to multiple people.  One thing I'd agree with though is that I don't want to see any reboots, or remakes."
MadMax,3bvygt,SpaceTire,2,Thu Jul 2 21:21:59 2015 UTC,I would love it if Mad Max became like the James Bond series.

How about a movie set in the Citadel, following a War Boy as he grows up under the new Lady Immortan? Or a road movie about a roving biker gang praying on settlers but told from the gang's point of view?   Been thinking on a little over the morning - I think it could work - but only if it treated each movie[13] as it's own myth to build from, and doesn't try and connect the movies into an overall coherent universe.   [13] Or at most, each actor's version of Max as part of a coherent universe - though that might be pushing it a bit.   But I would like to see the story of how Papagallo found and setup the refining compound. And how the Great Northern Tribe fared. The story of how the kids that remained in the crack in the earth fared. Of how Entity founded Bartertown, and what he next move was after she left Max for dead...   Yeah, I'm won on that idea. ...with the ""not a shared universe"" caveat :)  (that I'm OK with , and even like, sprawling disconnected/inconsistent universes is probably telling from my other fandoms - Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy and Doctor Who ;)"
MadMax,3bvygt,SpaceTire,2,Fri Jul 3 04:30:34 2015 UTC,"I would kill for a Mel Gibson directed Mad Max movie. As much as everyone hates Mel for being crazy and racist, he really does have a brilliance when it comes to the screen. But brilliance like that doesn't usually come from a well buttoned up/never does anything wrong white collar sane person.   Apocolypto is one of my favorite movies."
MadMax,3bvygt,nemothorx,1 point,Fri Jul 3 19:22:58 2015 UTC,"""opening up"" the universe works for Star Wars, because it's a single consistent story.   Mad Max is a series of myths, with many self contradictions already.   Now you could argue that this makes it easier to open up the world to other writers and film makers, but for my taste, it makes it harder, since the connecting thread between movies is no longer story and world building, but a less tangible... style (for want of a better word). Miller brings his own style to the table to unite the series, and I think it would be difficult for another director to follow on from that in a way that felt ""true""."
MadMax,3bvygt,IdiotsLantern,1 point,Thu Jul 2 22:33:07 2015 UTC,"I think the hardest part would be that when Mad Max first appeared, it kind of created it's own subgenre: the post-apocalyptic road action movie. There are many, many movies in this genre.   Convincing viewers that this is a ""Mad Max"" movie and not one of the imitators is going to be hard if you have to do with without George Miller AND without a character called Max. I don't want to say it absolutely could never be done but... it'd be very difficult."
MadMax,3bvygt,nemothorx,2,Fri Jul 3 09:48:21 2015 UTC,"It wasn't the first to try for that genre (Damnation Alley is a contender surely?), but Mad Max certainly claimed the genre and made it it's own.   But I think part of what has allowed MM to not get stale is that each movie is quite different within that genre.    MM is a revenge movie.  MM2 is a siege movie (despite the famous chase ending) Thunderdome is a rescue-the-kids movie. (I've yet to come up with a clean one-word sub-genre summary that I think fits it. I do like Beyond Thunderdome, but it's hard to describe simply) Fury Road is a chase movie.    I don't know how many distinct subgenres of post-apocalyptic and/or action movies there are, but I think aiming for a core sub-genre would help keep things in focus.  Regardless of hypotheticals, I agree it would be very difficult, and my preference would be to let the series end where it started - with Miller."

We (USA) don't have the gnarly MAN trucks that they used for the Doof Wagon, but a similar domestic machine (a 50-ton crane truck) runs about $40-60k used. Combine with a boatload of 8, 10 and 12-inch woofers, who-knows-how-many amps, a spare generator to run it all (about $5k) and (of course) four concert bass drums (largest I could find on eBay was a Yamaha 40"" model for a cool $1,500 each)...

MadMax,3bt9b5,TypoHero,19,Wed Jul 1 23:28:55 2015 UTC,"Nux has been raised to be fanatical to a cause. That is hardwired into him. He's not going to be ambivalent about things.   He's failed in front of his ""God"" - Joe. He knows he can't return to that life, and so he's all but given up on life completely. He has no cause anymore. But then he's given a reason to go on - a new cause.   So I don't see it as problematic that he goes from completely supporting Joe to completely supporting Furiosa and Max, so long as the reason for the change is justified - which I felt it was.  Basically, I don't think Nux's personality has changed. He's just traded one cause (that he didn't fully understand) for a new one (that he probably doesn't fully understand either!)"
MadMax,3bt9b5,nemothorx,1 point,Wed Jul 1 23:55:58 2015 UTC,Yeah HE failed HIS god. So his reaction is to fight against him. I still don't really buy it.
MadMax,3bt9b5,CharlieHarvey,8,Thu Jul 2 00:08:35 2015 UTC,"Really, the problem is that it's a film.  I agree with you. Nux's story is seriously abbreviated, but films have to fit a lot of moving parts into a very small space.  If this was a novel and the characters had months together, then yeah, we would have seen a slow breakdown where he vacillates back and forth between his faith and the 'truth'. Instead they had two days and we had two hours. So we get a quick scene where his idol casts him aside and a beautiful stranger shows him a moment of unexpected kindness.  I get what you're saying, but with as much as was going on the film couldn't afford to show long, drawn-out scenes of Nux in emotional turmoil, struggling to come to grips with things.  Besides he was angry, hurt, betrayed, etc. It's not too unrealistic that in the heat of the moment and still stinging from the Immortan's rejection that a kid of his age might jump ship that quickly.  These were people that needed help. His contributions would be noticed and appreciated. Plus, there was a woman he was interested in who was also interested in him. It all would be a pretty strong draw to jump ship, at least temporarily.  Maybe if he had lived he would have had some moments of doubt and panic over what he'd done afterwards. I actually think you can kind of see a hint of that in how incredulous he looks when he hears that Joe is dead, but for the moment he was just caught up.  Within the context of what the film has time to show, it's believable enough for me."
MadMax,3bt9b5,skonen_blades,3,Thu Jul 2 00:44:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah.  It's hard to fit that complex of a turnaround into so short a time frame but it has to be done.  It's up to the actor, director, and writer to make it believable.  It's a hard thing to accomplish."
MadMax,3bt9b5,BlakeFlaherty,3,Thu Jul 2 19:33:42 2015 UTC,"Why not? If he's not going to witness the gates Valhalla and he knew for sure that he wasn't, then why wouldn't he help the people who showed him the first signs of true compassion in his life.   It's a direct reflection of christianity in my opinion specifically catholicism. If you knew that you were going to burn in hell for failing one menial task, then why wouldn't you help the people willing to help you before you had to experience that. I know that I can speak to the fact that I reacted in a similar way, just much more sedated way I guess.   Also keep in mind that throughout the movie Nux is looking for that moment of greatness that he believes he was born for, and with the constant failures provided to him by following Immortan Joe he could've had a moment of enlightenment where he realized he had been trying so hard for something that never truly appreciated him, and just completely changed spectrums with his opinions. I've seen similar cases multiple times."
MadMax,3bt9b5,nemothorx,3,Thu Jul 2 01:44:10 2015 UTC,"Yes, his god rejected him, and after a period of despair - and a dose of genuine attention (rather than Joe's faux attention) - he rejected his god.   I don't find this difficult to buy at all."
MadMax,3bt9b5,shadowbannedkiwi,2,Thu Jul 2 01:53:41 2015 UTC,"In old times when people lose faith, they turn to new ones. In his case, he turned to help the brides who asked him ""who killed the world?"""
MadMax,3bt9b5,Andrew_W_Kennedy,8,Thu Jul 2 06:23:38 2015 UTC,"As /u/nemothorx said, he failed right in front of his god and got called mediocre. Plus, like he says to Capable, Joe saw Nux's blood-bag driving the rig that led to the death of his favorite wife and child, so Joe would probably have killed Nux and banished him to hell (or whatever their equivalent is) out of spite.    When we meet Nux again he's completely broken down. He's given up on himself, and his faith has been shaken because ""the gates were open three times"" but he failed to be ushered into Valhalla.    I think one of the most significant factors though is Capable's compassion. Nux hasn't experienced compassion or a woman's touch possibly his entire life. She lays down with him and strokes his face, and he probably feels the closest thing to love he has ever felt. She convinces him that maybe it's his ""manifest destiny"" to rescue them from an evil oppressor rather than being ""an old man's battle fodder."""
MadMax,3bt9b5,LogicalTimber,3,Thu Jul 2 00:48:44 2015 UTC,"Generally speaking, the more extreme someone was before a conversion, the more extreme they'll be afterwards. Fanatics don't stop being fanatics because their values got flipped on their heads.   He also doesn't change that much. He goes from devotion to one god (Joe) to another (Capable). He still finds meaning in dying for them. If he'd lived, perhaps he could have had time to mature. As it is, there's not that much growth happening.   I agree a little more time for him to switch sides or a little more foreshadowing that he's starting to doubt Joe wouldn't have hurt. Buuut, it's a short movie with a ton of characters, all with their own arcs. I think it's pretty good as it is."

MadMax,3bt9b5,IdiotsLantern,5,Thu Jul 2 14:48:32 2015 UTC,"Nux abandoned his faith, his lifelong indoctrination and his values so quickly I got whiplash.   I don't think he did, actually.   Nux was raised to want just one thing: a death historic that would ensure his entry to Valhalla. He wants this so badly, he jury-rigged a way to take his fresh blood supply with him, something even the Immortan Joe seemed to think was unusual enough to justify a second or two of his attention.   When Capable finds him cowering in misery in the back of the rig, he is upset for two reasons: (1) he failed in front of his Immortan and everyone he knows, and this crushed him. (2) .... He just saw Splendid die. This is, I think, the biggest reason why he knows he can't return to Joe: Max drove the rig that Angharad fell from, because Nux was so determined to have his blaze of glory that he brought his Blood Bag with him, and then lost control of him. So Nux feels responsible for the death of Angharad, and combined with his failure in front of the Immortan and the fact she was his favorite and the person who was carrying his heir, no wonder he feels like he's blown his chance at Valhalla. No way would the Immortan ever carry him there now. And he's devastated because this was it, this was his destiny, he was raised from birth for THIS and he doesn't understand why it keeps not working.   What Capable does for him, besides just quieting him down, is tell him that maybe there's a reason why he failed, maybe he has a different destiny. He's never considered that before: having a different destiny. But what could it be?   It's not that he stops believing in Valhalla, but what changes is how he intends to get there. He needs a new destiny. And lets not pretend like his crush on Capable played no part either: if you've got nothing else to live for, then the kind, beautiful girl who cares for you and comforts you even after you've tried to kill her friend and enslave her several times... maybe she is your destiny. Maybe you were always kind of supposed to meet her. Nux and Capable are basically inseparable for the rest of the movie, to the point where even leaving to fix the engine requires an exchange of meaningful glances and Capable has to be urged to leave the rig even though he's driving and can't leave before she does.   And finally, at the end of everything.... his original fate rears it's ugly head. And he looks at Rictus with the engine above his head and realizes.... this was always how it was supposed to be. And it's not like the ""WITNESSING"" of the past: he doesn't scream with glee or spray his mouth silver.... instead he just looks at her, and asks her to witness him. There's an interesting conflict in his face here. Although he knows what he's going to do, and feels like this is finally it, this is why he's here...  he is sad to be leaving her. Because that's the one sadness the cult of Witnessing doesn't account for: the sadness of leaving your loved ones behind. The Heroes of All Time might be there, but she won't be. Capable understands what he's about to do, and knows it's what he wants and she can't stop him ... and gives him the Vuvolini sign for love and remembrance. ""Witnessed,"" goes from a thing of bloodlusty joy to sadness and respect. And he smiles, and twists the wheel, and finally enters Valhalla. It's the definition of dying historic on the Fury Road.    TL:DR Nux's beliefs didn't change, what he fought for did. When he finally died, it wasn't for some dream of immortality, it was for the people he loved. What was being witnessed wasn't the opening gates of valhalla, but his sacrifice for the sake of people he cares about."
MadMax,3bt9b5,black-opal,1 point,Fri Jul 3 05:44:53 2015 UTC,"He did spend a lot of time with Capable (the redhead), the wives were educated. You can see the two of them snuggled together in the War Rig, being taken for who you are and loved and not a pawn."
MadMax,3bt9b5,firerocman,0,Thu Jul 2 20:43:22 2015 UTC,"People tend to eat up simple redemption stories, and that's largely what Nux is, right down to his super predictable death.  It wasn't just that the turn around was quick; you can explain something like that, it's that the movie doesn't do a great job, or really any job of explaining such a quick about face believably.  He was definitely more enjoyable to watch as a War Boy for me, and those scenes in the beginning made up for the small flaws involving his character."

MadMax,3bogr7,Cross-Country,3,Wed Jul 1 03:02:28 2015 UTC,Not sure. I kinda like how it looks with them. I'm getting it for a not exact mad max costume. More for just wearing around when I'm on my motorcycle.   I will admit that I really want one of those south African battle jackets but I have no idea where to get one for under $200.
MadMax,3bogr7,Cross-Country,1 point,Wed Jul 1 05:28:08 2015 UTC,South African battle jacket?
MadMax,3bogr7,AngriestCosmonaut,1 point,Fri Jul 3 07:36:29 2015 UTC,It's the thing that has the tan pouches and the backpack that Max is wearing in the new movie.
MadMax,3bogr7,IdiotsLantern,1 point,Fri Jul 3 13:03:40 2015 UTC,"They can be had all over for under $200. If you import them from South Africa or Namibia, or buy them from eBay sellers who specialize in military surplus and not cosplay, you'll find them for ~$85 easy. Believe it or not their price has gone down since the film came out, and it has had no noticeable effect on their availability. That is of course if you want the original Nutria surplus. Repros in different colors are dirt cheap.  Also be advised that while they're great fighting rigs as well as airsoft rigs, their design is in no way whatsoever suitable for a post-apocalyptic setting. They're meant solely for direct action (like an SADF Fireforce vest) and have extremely small capacity compared to other rigs of their time. Hope this info helps."
MadMax,3bogr7,fwinzor,1 point,Sat Jul 11 07:15:42 2015 UTC,I actually wanted it more for hiking or dirt bike riding for the exact fact that they're not to bulky. It's like a day pack with some extra easy to reach pouches. I actually prefer the minimalist setups and my favorite plate carrier I have is my JPC from Crye.  It's funny you sent this now cause my buddy literally sent me a link yesterday for a vendor who just got em in stock for $85.
MadMax,3bogr7,SethManhammer,0,Sat Jul 11 09:36:15 2015 UTC,"Not to be a jerk or anything, but could you please leave the authentic surplus ones for us surplus collectors? I can even link you a repro in the color of your choice if you want. Pretty please...."
MadMax,3bogr7,Gnarbage,2,Sat Jul 11 15:39:12 2015 UTC,"I actually am in the military so I'd prefer not to own a repro that might break on me. Don't worry, I won't modify it to the point of oblivion. I shall treat her well."
MadMax,3bogr7,Gnarbage,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:28:10 2015 UTC,"Well in that case, enjoy it! Again not trying to be a jerk, those of us who collect historical surplus have just been having a hard time with different rigs being picked up by cosplayers who don't understand what they are, what they're worth, or how badly we want them. It's gotten more frustrating over the years and we were all afraid Fury Road was the last we'd be seeing of the Battle Jackets (which as pointed out previously hasn't been the case).  Enjoy the one you get! I'll be getting one here soon as well."
MadMax,3bogr7,Gnarbage,2,Sat Jul 11 21:16:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I know the feels. There's a few rigs I'd like to pick up that I can't find anywhere due to demands (especially from the airsoft market) Picked up a ChiCom rig recently for free, pretty stoked about that."
MadMax,3bogr7,Turbofurball,3,Sat Jul 11 21:50:12 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much, I wanted to get it but honestly I'm too scared to risk it! Can't wait to see how it turns out."

MadMax,3bpeg4,jallain,8,Wed Jul 1 02:13:25 2015 UTC,The pod is full of fuel. They were bringing milk water and produce to gas town and the bullet farm in the main tanker. The pod is most likely filled with fuel as a reserve to refuel convoy as needed.   The plan was to leave the pod only. Furiousa even says she'll unhook the pod when she's talking to the rock riders
MadMax,3bpeg4,eff1ngham,3,Wed Jul 1 03:52:23 2015 UTC,"Why did she decide to screw over the canyon dudes and keep the pod, and when did she change the plan?"
MadMax,3bpeg4,bunnyteefs,4,Wed Jul 1 05:04:48 2015 UTC,"Furiosa appeared to have every intention of giving the Rock Riders the fuel, she just ran out of time. She sees how quickly the pursuit vehicles are approaching as she's walking to unhitch the fuel pod, and has no choice but to run with Max and the girls instead."
MadMax,3bpeg4,Deezer19,-3,Wed Jul 1 23:12:12 2015 UTC,"There was no deal anymore. She brought less then they agreed upon. She also promised them there wouldn't be much trouble. She only needed them to seal off the canyon. They needed to seal it anyway now that so much heat was coming, so Furiosa got what she wanted and didn't need to give them the fuel."
MadMax,3bpeg4,Derpatologist_7,8,Wed Jul 1 06:25:08 2015 UTC,"I don't think she brought less than agreed upon. She even said ""3000 gallons of guzzoline, like you wanted"". They were pissed for two reasons. 1. She brought 3 war parties in tow and 2. She was meant to be alone, but Splendid made sounds when her contractions started and made noise alerting the Rock Riders that she was not in fact alone.  Furiosa was more than happy to unhitch the pod, they just started firing upon her."
MadMax,3bpeg4,Deezer19,6,Wed Jul 1 11:45:13 2015 UTC,They didn't hear Splendid. That was just added tension for the viewer.
MadMax,3bpeg4,skonen_blades,2,Wed Jul 1 16:41:56 2015 UTC,"That's up in the air.  Sounds were made and then the Canyon guys started shooting.  There was no reaction shot that I remember of the canyon riders going ""What in the heck was that sound?!"" but it seemed to be the straw that broke the camel's back of the tension there."
MadMax,3bpeg4,5p33di3,3,Wed Jul 1 17:05:19 2015 UTC,The second time she made noise the main canyon guy changed his gaze from Furiosa to the cabin then I think the camera cut to Furiosa and she shouted 'fool' but I'd have to watch it again for the exact sequence.
MadMax,3bpeg4,TypoHero,1 point,Thu Jul 2 05:39:51 2015 UTC,"There was a clear cry from outside the tanker, camera on Furiousa. It's clear she either new they heard it or they did because she says ""FOOL!"" then starts running at the same time they started shooting."

MadMax,3bpeg4,LogicalTimber,2,Thu Jul 2 05:39:58 2015 UTC,"Given how much authority she has, it's possible she just ordered the fuel pod to be filled and no-one questioned it. Remember her crew's exchange: ""We're going East!"" ""Why are we going East?"" ""Don't know!"" It's believable that she'd have special orders requiring a mid-trip detour, and that she'd need a full fuel pod for it."
MadMax,3bpeg4,ItsAmerico,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:55:36 2015 UTC,"Is it possible she was taking the gas to Gas Town?  And yeah it seems the plan was she would only have dragged the two or three cars that were with her, the Buzzards(?) would have killed the stragglers and then taken the gas and letting her travel out safely."
MadMax,3bpeg4,LongHorsa,2,Wed Jul 1 03:04:41 2015 UTC,The Buzzards are the cars with spikes. Furiosa had made the deal with the Rock Riders.

Thus, the convoy would need some extra guzzoline for their long trip. That and the tank itself is filled with Mother's Milk, Aqua Cola, and produce."
MadMax,3bpeg4,SpaceTire,-5,Wed Jul 1 22:42:46 2015 UTC,"People in this world are simply trying to survive.   My question is this:   Did Furiosa Bring the Wives because maybe she planned on using them as bartering tools or to give to the rock riders. She was supposed to be alone, but if things got crazy, maybe she would offer them up for safe passage. Furiosa knows how to survive. For gods sake, she is a one armed woman in this crazy world."
MadMax,3bpeg4,teaqualizer,6,Wed Jul 1 07:48:06 2015 UTC,Not quite sure how that would qualify as an act of redemption.  If survival was her goal she wouldn't have betrayed Joe in the first place.
MadMax,3bpeg4,Derpatologist_7,5,Wed Jul 1 07:55:56 2015 UTC,I don't think it was her plan to surrender those wives to anyone for her own gain or safe passage.
MadMax,3bn9pm,MeguhMan,22,Tue Jun 30 16:15:17 2015 UTC,"I thought it was interesting that she phrased it as a question. Because it's kind of not a question. She really can't wait for him, not with three armadas on her tail, and he knows this. He tells her the obvious thing. It's sort of the only answer he can give. But still, hearing him say it, I think.... I think that's the moment when they realize they don't want to leave him.  And he realizes something too: Yes, the Bullet Farmer will kill or enslave every last one of them, blood bag and wife and war boy, and with Furiosa and Nux busy tending to the rig, Max is the only one available to deal with it. It's a smart move no matter what. But...   I think this is when he realizes that this is becoming more then self-preservation. These people are starting to matter to him. That's the real reason why he heads off to deal with the Bullet Farmer all by himself. He did it to protect them.   This I think is his biggest turning point. Some part of him remembers that a cop is supposed to serve and protect, and even though that cop died a long time ago, finding that instinct again is the biggest shift from desperate beast back into something like a person. He's gone from looking out for himself to looking out for the group."
MadMax,3bn9pm,IdiotsLantern,10,Tue Jun 30 21:02:33 2015 UTC,Oh that last paragraph gave me chills.  Nice one.
MadMax,3bn9pm,skonen_blades,2,Tue Jun 30 23:50:09 2015 UTC,"Excellent analysis, I couldn't agree more. That moment is a good counterpart to the trust they show each other when firing the rifle (he trusts her not to shoot him, she trusts him not to move). The whole group has been building bonds for a while, this scene is where they realize that those bonds exist."
MadMax,3bn9pm,LogicalTimber,10,Wed Jul 1 04:40:29 2015 UTC,Absolutely.  It's like a masterclass in symbolism.
MadMax,3bn9pm,Turbofurball,7,Tue Jun 30 18:09:45 2015 UTC,Also Toast seems quite concerned when she sees the blood all over Max's face.

You could almost swap out the words ""slave"" for ""Wife"" and the article still works."
MadMax,3bowjz,IdiotsLantern,9,Tue Jun 30 23:21:13 2015 UTC,"Hmmm, lets see.....   ""Did the slaves here appreciate the care they got from their mistress?""   ""They lived in a nice house here, and they weren't being beaten. Do we know why they wanted to leave?""   A gentlemen came in to view our replica slave quarter and, upon learning how crowded it was, said, ""Well, I've seen taverns where five or six guys had to share a bed!"" — thus adding ""tavern-goers"" to the list of white people who supposedly had it just as bad as slaves.   And this one's a really good one.   ""Were they loyal?"" I turned around, and saw a man resting his arms on either side of the door frame behind me, blocking the exit. He looked like he was about to slap me.   I asked him why he would ask that. ""They gave 'em food. Gave 'em a place to live,"" he said. He was just staring into the room, blank in the eyes.  ""I think most people would act ‘loyal' to a person who could shoot them for leaving,"" I said.    And the kicker at the end...    ... guests — especially older folks — used to ask me all the time whether the people who owned the house were ""good slaveowners."" I would say, ""Well, that's an interesting question,"" and suggest a couple of reasons why even the phrase good slaveowner itself is troubling.    ....Yep. That's pretty spot on."
MadMax,3bowjz,IdiotsLantern,9,Tue Jun 30 23:56:02 2015 UTC,"The story about the tavern-goers got elaborated on on Twitter:    Last month a guy walked into our historic slave quarter and went, “This isn’t that bad!”  “Well, it would’ve held 5-6 people per room,” I said. “So are you saying it’s not bad…compared to other slave quarters?”  He said, “Well, yeah…and I’ve seen old taverns where five or six guys had to share a bed!”  I pointed out nicely that after a night in a tavern, one leaves.  He started in on an old standby of slavery apologists: “Well, the Irish were treated much worse than slaves were.”  We argued about how free workers got rights and upward mobility, whereas slaves were motivated by violence.  He started pacing the room with his hands behind his back.  He asked who sold the slaves to begin with. (In other words, he wanted to lead me into blaming Africans for slavery.)  I started to talk about the Dutch and the Portuguese. He goes, ""If you study your history,""  “…you’ll find that the black people sold other blacks into slavery.”  I talked about how African slavery was different from American slavery. Also about how not all black people are related.  He started defending American slavery: “They got food, did they not? They got housing?”  “Who built the slaves’ cabins?” I countered. (In our region, typically, the slaves did.)  His comeback: “But who TOLD them to build them?”  I am a museum professional but God help us all I blurted out, “How kind. That’s really nice of him. Wow.”  Anyway, his wife came in from exploring the workyard, read the situation, and gently hustled him out, leaving me alone in the quarter.  The craziest stuff always happens when you’re by yourself."

If it was entirely orange, same principal except opposite hand. Yes, this is the Hollywood orange/blue trope, however redundant it is, it works. The doctor still resides emotionally in the wasteland and looks at this as just another medical procedure. Immotan knows this is his son, and one that could be better than any of his living ones potentially. (SPOILER ALERT) It then does a complete 180 when after the baby is found to be a boy, Immotan celebrates, even though his son was dead. He did, after all, ""have"" a baby boy, dead or alive. I think this makes Immotan that much more evil, he has moments of empathy, but is he empathizing himself or his lineage? Really complex antagonist and could not have been better written for the world of the Wasteland. Some of the best cinematography I have seen in awhile that was not done by Roger Deakins."

Its essentially a fake word, from a language Max has never spoken to my knowledge, and it doesn't really match his lips.

Best I've found so far is the dialog sub-titles from the leak.  Someday when I have the time I plan to go through and flesh it out a bit.  At least add who's speaking each line and such.  It would be cool if we could expand it to closer to a real screenplay.

Half the Trans Ams that you see for sale already look like they've survived the apocalypse and are held together with nothing more than baling twine, tape and the grace of god.  Buy one of those, paint it matt black, sand the paint off the edges of the numerous dents it's sure to have had when you bought it. Sandblast the whole thing a little, mix some glue and sand/dirt together to give it some semi-permanent filth and then add the engine and you would have a much better-looking MM car for probably less money than this thing cost."

MadMax,3blat0,Derpatologist_7,21,Tue Jun 30 03:38:03 2015 UTC,"...Max is both extremely smart and bat shit insane. He's also partly feral, which gives him very strong instincts. So you can get away with a lot when it comes to portraying his inner world and what he does and does not know at any given moment.   I'm pretty sure he can't predict the future in the supernatural sense, but like all of us, he can predict it in the conventional way. But because he's crazy, what for you and me might be, ""hmm, if I do this, then this and this and this is probably going to happen... so I should get ready for a fight,"" translated through his layers of guilty hallucinations and symbolism, is going to look like a dead girl throwing her hand up at him, making him flinch, before re-materializing in the distance calling ""C'mon Pa, let's go."" Which is how he knows what he's decided to do.   I'm of the personal opinion that him reaching for that particular spot was a coincidence. His subconscious told him, via the girl, that he needed to be ready to fight, so she attacks him, and he flinches and raises his hand to his head. Later, when the crossbowman attacks, he sees her again, and this time flinching leads him to save his own life by stopping the bolt from going right through his head.   I agree with another analysis I've read on this sub: this is his guilt fusing with his need to survive. The girl has gone from stopping his escapes and torturing him to warning him of incoming attacks to keep him alive. Fighting for the Wives and Furiosa is a way of settling with his past and redeeming himself, so the girl (a kind of incarnation of his guilty conscience) is trying to help him. Like all animals, he's got very strong instincts, so she appears when he senses danger, even if what's left of his rational mind doesn't recognize why or how.   It's not that he doesn't have the ability to think about things rationally. We saw him do it quite a bit in the movie. It's that when you jump inside of his head, you might not recognize what his reasoning looks like."
MadMax,3blat0,IdiotsLantern,3,Tue Jun 30 05:47:28 2015 UTC,"So the actual vision/shot of the crossbow dude just an artistic shot for a bit of fun?  I agree with your whole premise, by the way."
MadMax,3blat0,IdiotsLantern,3,Tue Jun 30 06:15:21 2015 UTC,"I think the girl throwing her hand at his head was his mind's way of telling him, ""you know this is going to be very hard so you'd better be ready to fight."" And then she was out in the desert, saying, ""lets go,"" which was his way of saying to himself, ""yes it's going to be very hard, but you want to do it anyway, because this is going to redeem something inside you.""   And then later, when the crossbowman showed up, his instincts manifested the girl to warn him ""Get Ready to Fight!"" and he flinched. And the way he flinched saved his life. It was a heck of a coincidence that flinching that way was exactly what he needed to do. He was eerily accurate at predicting exactly what kind of scrape he would wind up in if he convinced everybody to return to the Citadel. It's uncanny, but not supernatural."
MadMax,3blat0,teaqualizer,2,Tue Jun 30 06:36:00 2015 UTC,It's one of those great little details I don't want miller to explain.   In terms of the original question I'd rather he didn't have ESP but then again I'd be open to it if miller made it work well.
MadMax,3blat0,teaqualizer,2,Tue Jun 30 09:11:39 2015 UTC,"The only reason I asked the question is because when I froze the movie at that exact point you could see quite clearly the crossbow man, I just assumed they've slotted the image in for a bit of fun."

MadMax,3blat0,ItsAmerico,1 point,Tue Jun 30 10:56:07 2015 UTC,"But at that stage he hadn't seen the crossbow dude. I'm just of the opinion that the image of the dude was just a bit of creative fun, morning more."
MadMax,3blat0,The_Nez,1 point,Tue Jun 30 11:04:40 2015 UTC,"The opening of Thunderdome is pretty similar. He might have seen the crossbow bolt itself, kinda like when you go paintballing and you can see the paintballs even though they are small and going really fast and you can kinda move out of the way. I'm just pretty certain the he doesn't have ESP based on the events of the four films as a whole.   I don't mean to be harsh. It's a neat theory. I guess I just disagree and wouldn't like it very much if he had ESP."

MadMax,3bl5du,SethManhammer,2,Tue Jun 30 11:10:55 2015 UTC,"My suggestions, after owning multiple copies of each movie on bluray (except for Thunderdome, since it's only had one release thus far):  Go for the Scream Factory Mad Max bluray, since it's got the most special features carried over from the MGM Special Edition DVD, and it's got a new featurette, plus you can turn in insert and have the original artwork or the new.  Skip the old combo pack and Best Buy steelbooks.  The version of Mad Max in the trilogy tin is from the Combo Pack.    The newest release of The Road Warrior has a new transfer, and it's the mostly grey cover.  The old release is yellow-ish and is fine, but if you want the best transfer, the grey cover is the way to go.  The special features are the same across both discs, however, and the commentary is actually really good."

MadMax,3bia3s,VforVickers,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:15:58 2015 UTC,"Agreed on that. Would've liked to see more of Furiosa yelling in the desert, was a great shot but didn't last too long. Then again, I suppose better too short than long."

The way this fits into the sequence of shots that precede and follow it is stunning. There are many similarly well-crafted shots like this in the film but this one in particular is so satisfying. And it only lasts like half a second or something. The relentless pace really adds to the replay value because you just want to watch the sequences all over again to marvel at how they've been put together."

In the scene she presents herself as a potential new bride for Joe hoping to live a life of luxury in comparison to her life among The Wretched. Ironically, the group of women she is hoping to join just used the same elevator to escape the life she so covets.  Her fellow members of the wretched chant 'Let her up!' and either due to the crowds support, her beauty/non-mutated appearence or some combination of the two she is given her wish. Therefore, when Furiosa, Max and the remaining wives return at the end of the movie and The Wretched chant 'Let them up!' it is actually a call back to a cut scene."

Apparently Rictus holds her up by the throat, and then the Mechanic stabs her, and licks her armpit (?) while she's in her death throes. Sounds morbid as hell, which is probably why it was deleted."

(possibly even extra war boys?) Since The Wretched flock to the lifts, the guards there might find people that appear unblemished and sort of, harvest them. It's clear the Wretched want up, so it doesn't seem outlandish to think people might present themselves to attempt to get work/life in the Citadel, and sometimes people are allowed up."

MadMax,3bjr6k,Flopjack,2,Mon Jun 29 20:05:21 2015 UTC,"Sounds good.  Like the vehicle carrier.  At the beginning of the film, the car carrier is full of war boys and then at the end it's full of cars from the battles.  Maybe it doubles duty as a war boy ambulance/meat wagon/rescuer?"
MadMax,3bjr6k,skonen_blades,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:30:02 2015 UTC,I didn't notice there was such a vehicle. At what part do we see it? At several points we see the stations on top the War Rig for War Boys. One gets torn off by the spikey car wasteland thug's semi-truck monstrosity.  You're right that there's further utility for the war Boy Wagon such as medical and as a hearse.
MadMax,3bjr6k,trabnas,3,Mon Jun 29 20:36:03 2015 UTC,It's shown at pretty much the beginning of the chase. Just before the Buzzards.  Edit: It can be seen in the background just when the guitarist is introduced  Edit2: spelling

Splendid, without a hint of irony,  refers to Nux as both a child and an old man within the same sentence. It's tragic and really puts the Warboy mentality of sacrificing themselves into perspective as well as Nux's character arc.  I think that line perfectly sums up the insanity of the wasteland and this film in general."
MadMax,3bi6ga,Peanlocket,7,Mon Jun 29 14:47:55 2015 UTC,Nice how in the film Joes minions aren't allowed to graduate to War Man or War Soldier status. You start out as a pup and are ready to fight when you're a boy. Another subtle tool of oppression.  Edit: what's in a name? A hell of a damn lot.

MadMax,3bi6ga,IdiotsLantern,2,Mon Jun 29 19:06:55 2015 UTC,"That is also one of those lines that implies a whole backstory we never seen. These wives were kept in isolation. How did they manage to learn about, let alone sympathize, with the War Boyz and their brainwashed, chronically dying lot?   Whatever it was, not one of them feared Nux. Even when Capable found him, and she was alone and unarmed, and he's already tried to kill Furiosa and return them multiple times... she feels for him enough to actually comfort him, and touch him gently, and say kind things to him. Next time we see him, he's fighting on her side, where he has clearly decided he is going to stay until his half life runs out."

MadMax,3bi6ga,BreakingBradl,2,Mon Jun 29 19:32:55 2015 UTC,It's also in the cacophony of voices in the very beginning before the opening scene of the move.
MadMax,3bi6ga,BreakingBradl,15,Wed Jul 1 01:51:10 2015 UTC,"""Max. My name is Max. That's my name."" This shows a compassionate side of Max that we haven't seen since the first film, while he still had a wife and son. I feel that we, the audience, nor Max himself expected to feel compassion towards anyone else in the wasteland. A side I definitely didn't plan on seeing. It was a nice change of pace in my opinion."
MadMax,3bi6ga,LostSoulsAlliance,4,Mon Jun 29 13:28:00 2015 UTC,In a way it kinda makes me think that he shouldn't have said it in the opening narration.
MadMax,3bi6ga,BreakingBradl,2,Mon Jun 29 13:47:21 2015 UTC,"Yes, but going on the fact that there are 3 other movies we do know his name. Furiosa not knowing Max is dramatic irony more than anything."

MadMax,3bi6ga,adventurefine,15,Wed Jul 1 06:25:41 2015 UTC,"""THIS, is your way home.""  Turns everybody around on what they can hope for. Shows them they can fix what they have, instead of hope for something that probably doesn't exist. Fix what's broken, or you'll go insane.  Heck, maybe it should be:  ""You know, hope is a mistake. If you can't fix what's broken, you'll... You'll go insane."""
MadMax,3bi6ga,aheavywithdiabeetus,8,Mon Jun 29 18:08:15 2015 UTC,"It definitely is ""You know, hope is a mistake. If you can't fix what's broken, you'll... You'll go insane.""  It marks the turning point of the movie in terms of Max's character. We finally understand the meaning of the dead people that keep haunting his mind. It's sad because Max is trying to communicate his feelings to Furiosa yet he knows she doesn't quite get it like he does. Max saves her from the madness that he suffers from, and I think she maybe recognizes that as she goes up the lift to the citadel at the end."
MadMax,3bi6ga,dmasterdyne,8,Mon Jun 29 18:42:16 2015 UTC,"That's the one I would pick.   ""If you can't fix what's broken, you'll... You'll go insane.""  For me this is key in the decision to turn back and take the citadel. But more importantly it's key to Furiosa's redemption. Even if the green place existed she still wouldn't be able to live with the fact that the citadel still exists under the brutal rule that she helped to maintain for so many years. If she goes back and fixes it she'll have a real shot at redemption."
MadMax,3bi6ga,adventurefine,12,Mon Jun 29 19:14:39 2015 UTC,"""We are not things"" does put the whole thing in motion. It's basically the driving force of the film."
MadMax,3bi6ga,Derpatologist_7,12,Mon Jun 29 19:41:47 2015 UTC,"""WITNESS ME"" will be the most enduring outside the movie's context. That line alone has already become part of pop culture."

You have here the embodiment of everything Furiosa, the Wives, and Max by proxy are fighting against: a Warboy who by virtue of his own naiveity and indoctrination and who feels he's failed not once but three dies to die serving Joe listening to a plan that's suicidal, but gives every one of them a chance.   Including him.   Here we have him speaking what Max and Furiosa dare to have but don't speak. He's speaking it for all of them, but most importantly himself, because he's found another way.   Pivotal."
MadMax,3bi6ga,Liviosa,1 point,Tue Jun 30 11:14:26 2015 UTC,Yeah the sentiment is right but the delivery kinda irked me. It was more Nicholas Hoult than Nux to my ears. Not gruff enough.

On this site, there are people talking about how to make one and they have some good ideas: http://www.therpf.com/showthread.php?t=239913  Basically, it' a bird's skull with a bunch of car parts added to it (obviously).  You can get a replica bird skull from Skulls Unlimited: http://www.skullsunlimited.com/record_class.php?id=2  A real skull (eBay) would be cheaper, but also much more fragile.  People on the site I linked are saying that it's a raven or crow skull, but both of those birds have black beaks, not bone-colour, so it isn't. But it's very likely that the prop was modelled on the shape of a crow and they took artistic liberties and made the beak bone instead of black. Whether you can recreate this exactly will depend on your sculpting skills. If you're not good that way, just buy a different, but similar bird skull. A galloping horse won't notice it's not the same species, right?  There are nuts screwed into the bird's eyes. The site I linked seems to think that the lower jaw is most likely a small wiper-arm (like off a headlight or a back window wiper) or part of a set of grips.  It wouldn't be hard to make something close, if you're ok with not having an exact copy. If you want an exact copy you're going to have to have some tools on hand and be pretty good with them. The people on that website are sculpting pieces and using grinders  and all kinds of stuff.  Personally, I would look at pictures of the bird and then make something close but try to make it my own, too.  Everyone on that site is trying to figure out exactly what part of a car that spring came from, but I think: who cares? Just use a spring that works.  Anyway, if you decide to make one, good luck! That site will probably be the closest you'll get to a guide for a while, but whether you can follow what PoopaPapaPalps is doing or not will depend on how good you are with sculpture and what access you have to the tools he's using.   EDIT: I went to art school once upon a time and while I was always useless at 3D media, I'm thinking of buying a replica skull and trying my hand at making something close when I get paid again. If I do (and if it turns out well!) I'll post my process and message you to make sure you see it."

She's not infallible which makes her more realistic: there was a naivete to her plan with the rock crawlers that she lucked out on IMO, because I don't doubt that had she truly been alone with just the wives, there was nothing at all to stop the rock riders from killing them and taking the whole rig.  As a group, their plan to cross the salt flats was also a folly where hope clouded people's judgement. There's a good chance they would have all died on that journey."

When he trips on the chain and  Immortan Joe calls him mediocre, I legitimately felt his pain. He became a smart, strong-willed character."
MadMax,3bhjdm,JustAPrankBro,3,Mon Jun 29 07:58:03 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Nux is the heart and soul of the movie. The only character will a real arc too. Furiosa and Max are pretty much the same beginning to  rend, Nux grows."
MadMax,3bhjdm,aytakk,6,Mon Jun 29 12:31:14 2015 UTC,"Both Furiosa and Max grow, the former learning to trust some people and to work with whats available, and the latter progressing from barely able to grunt through to forming genuine relationships and caring about something outside himself."
MadMax,3bhjdm,Turbofurball,4,Mon Jun 29 15:18:19 2015 UTC,"I was just thinking about that, about how Max is becoming more compassionate and forming bonds with people now. He's filling in the hollow part of him with new people to take the place of his deceased family."
MadMax,3bhjdm,Turbofurball,2,Mon Jun 29 16:51:47 2015 UTC,"Exactly, his blood donation scene at the end is tender and caring, a peak of /human/ behaviour not seen since MM1."
MadMax,3bhjdm,VforVickers,3,Mon Jun 29 17:19:59 2015 UTC,"All 3 of the lead characters grow in some way.  Furiosa didn't ""rescue"" the five wives. She was helping them escape because she knew that's where it would hit Immortan Joe the hardest. She starts out purely motivated by revenge and then ends up working with others to form a better future for not only herself, but for everyone. She also learns to trust Max and eventually Nux.  Max also starts out not trusting too easily and we eventually see a softer side to him where he embraces others and forms an ""identity"" for himself."

MadMax,3bhjdm,Turbofurball,7,Mon Jun 29 18:01:19 2015 UTC,Max's one true love.
MadMax,3bhjdm,BreakingBradl,8,Mon Jun 29 18:16:44 2015 UTC,"The Dag. She's just in the background looking like nothing worthwhile, but has such a unique view of the world. And she takes over the reigns as the keeper of seeds, which is going to be super important.  Earlier unlikely favourite chacters: Mae with the shotgun in MM1, the mechanic's assistant in MM2, and Pig Killer in BT.  Special shout outs to the uncredited female mechanic in MM2, and Viper in Doomsday."
MadMax,3bhjdm,Derpatologist_7,3,Mon Jun 29 15:25:07 2015 UTC,The Dag is definitely my favorite of the wives
MadMax,3bhjdm,derb,5,Mon Jun 29 18:37:33 2015 UTC,Mine was Toast the knowing.
MadMax,3bhjdm,Turbofurball,3,Tue Jun 30 00:16:11 2015 UTC,"The Dag feels like she is on the same level as Max to me. Quick to spit some venom ""He's just a smeg who eats schlanga!"", but also the one who seems to take on responsibility quite quickly in terms of becoming the new carrier of the seeds. Plus she has the most Australian accent in the film I reckon."
MadMax,3bhjdm,heroicintent,2,Tue Jun 30 01:17:23 2015 UTC,"All the wives develop and grow up a lot through the course of the movie, but ""it's got everything you need, as long as you're not afraid of heights"" still makes me giggle :-)"

MadMax,3bhjdm,Derpatologist_7,8,Mon Jun 29 18:50:01 2015 UTC,"Gyro Captain. I really like his dynamic with Max, and how he ends up leading those people after the first leader gets killed. Plus he's got arguably the coolest vehicle in the series."

MadMax,3bhjdm,atglobe,3,Tue Jun 30 00:14:49 2015 UTC,he's certainly one of the more entertaining characters in the series. I'd agree with you.

MadMax,3bhjdm,VforVickers,4,Mon Jun 29 12:56:07 2015 UTC,Master Blaster is probably my favorite.
MadMax,3bhjdm,AtomicKaiser,5,Mon Jun 29 13:20:48 2015 UTC,Furiosa without a doubt.
MadMax,3bhjdm,DaJaKoe,3,Mon Jun 29 18:36:37 2015 UTC,"Golden youth, what a qt. Jk, Id say Immortan Joe, he looks so badass yet its mostly to disguise his weakness. I love the unrelenting force his armada carries with the guitar thrashing and the Gigahorse leading the way."
MadMax,3bhjdm,Solas67,2,Mon Jun 29 20:02:36 2015 UTC,Immortan Joe and his War Boys make Toecutter's and Lord Humungus' gangs look like couple a children pushing others around in a sandbox.
MadMax,3bhjdm,RebelGirl1323,3,Tue Jun 30 03:20:08 2015 UTC,"Gyro Captain is hard to go past as a favorite secondary character because Bruce Spence plays him so endearingly. He's out for himself, gangly, awkward yet with a heart. Always referring to Max as 'Partner', as if they're going to go off on some other adventure.   Warrior Woman from the same movie! Sort of your prototype before Furiosa, she was down the line fighting for her people unto death. Just uncompromising in values, and yet able to recognize and be warm to Max."
MadMax,3bhjdm,Gnarbage,2,Tue Jun 30 11:23:42 2015 UTC,"I think I have to go with Immortan Joe. Someone who survived the wars and remade Viking mythology for his own needs. That he feels a need to see his legacy live on is interesting. Either he believes his own religion or he cares that a false religion he knows he invented lives on. He is trying to build something, even if his low sanity points have resulted in a twisted vision of what that something should be. Previously I would have said Lord Humungus but he didn't have a full on religion yet. I think Immortan Joe is what a victories Lord Humungus would have become."

MadMax,3behww,CMAProductions,37,Sun Jun 28 14:04:07 2015 UTC,I've been saying since my second viewing that like 50% of this movie is Max and Furiosa looking at each other. It's the most important thing in the film.
MadMax,3behww,Greybear93,9,Sun Jun 28 16:07:21 2015 UTC,i really rarely see a movie twice... but this movie was one of them. So ... fucking.. good
MadMax,3behww,Throwcore,18,Sun Jun 28 18:19:53 2015 UTC,I never noticed The Immortan's Gigahorse has all those car brand logos on it
MadMax,3behww,fwinzor,5,Sun Jun 28 18:53:50 2015 UTC,"oh, the dash is covered! Neat.   I see a lot of Aussie ones there:  Torana, Kingswood, Falcon 500, Magna, the Holden logo they introduced in the 90s...   and that's just from a glance :)"

MadMax,3behww,The_Nez,4,Mon Jun 29 01:01:49 2015 UTC,"I wonder, what if Max stayed with Furiosa at the Citadel instead of backing away like a myth and legend?"
MadMax,3behww,Forrester96,1 point,Mon Jun 29 01:20:02 2015 UTC,"Max couldn't stay with her. He lost all he cared about (Jessie and Sprog, maybe a daughter (real or adopted, even imagined) ) long ago, and I don't think he could love again, but he can still care."
MadMax,3behww,Solas67,2,Tue Jun 30 11:39:24 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I like to think of dir. George miller played with the western genre conventions. He enters the community (frontier) and then exits it, just like the western hero he can't stay and he has to move on once the villain is killed. I just can't wait to see what miller is going to do next with the other 3 films!!"
MadMax,3bfrhp,Andrew_W_Kennedy,11,Sun Jun 28 20:52:54 2015 UTC,Nope. Nobody else who saw Mad Max movies has ever wanted a V8.  /s
MadMax,3bfrhp,Turbofurball,5,Sun Jun 28 21:30:21 2015 UTC,"Well not just any V8. I already have a fifth generation Mustang with a V8. But compared to old cars it's so smooth, quiet and refined. In most cases that's a good thing, but when you want to rip down back roads on a nice day, nothing beats the raw unrefined howl of a carbureted V8 shaking a big old school muscle car to its bones.    That's what Fury Road made me miss. Not just power and speed, but that gritty soul that comes with an old American street rod."
MadMax,3bfrhp,jimbohostetler,1 point,Sun Jun 28 22:08:19 2015 UTC,"With your fifth gen one thing that really gives it an old school feel is deleting the catalytic converters!

MadMax,3bfrhp,Broken_Goat,8,Sun Jun 28 22:14:49 2015 UTC,Hope these work. Built it to drive to the movie when it came out. Need to make quite a few modifications. It was supposed to be kinda like maxs truck from beyond thunderdome. But now its just not crazy enough to fit into the mad max world.   http://imgur.com/nGPJXnV http://imgur.com/jTRlblI http://imgur.com/fXL4q4V  Yes its fully street legal.   Head over to the facebook groups. We've already figured out how to make the lances. Haha.
MadMax,3bfrhp,IrrelevantLeprechaun,5,Sun Jun 28 23:11:42 2015 UTC,"Nice, I bet that was loads of fun to build. Did you take it to a drive-in theater? It'd be amazing pull up in that thing at a drive-in showing with the soundtrack on full blast."
MadMax,3bfrhp,President_Illuminati,2,Sun Jun 28 23:36:42 2015 UTC,Sadly no drive ins are within driving distance. But the local cops had us park up on the sidewalk next to the entrance so that was close enough for me.
MadMax,3bfrhp,President_Illuminati,5,Mon Jun 29 04:07:44 2015 UTC,Sure I had the urge and the vision.   But I'm just too damned poor.
MadMax,3bfrhp,President_Illuminati,3,Mon Jun 29 04:46:49 2015 UTC,I just really want a Mustang V8.. I currently drive a 96 toyota camry and I crave more power.
MadMax,3bfrhp,Volts-ohms-amps,2,Sun Jun 28 21:14:46 2015 UTC,"The new ones (2015+) are really nice. Ford finally put independent rear suspension on them, and that Coyote 5.0 liter V8 is a hell of an engine. Even better is the GT350 model that has a flat-plane V8 that revs over 8000 rpm.    I have a fifth gen GT and it's definitely a fun car. But like all newer cars, they also make you feel a bit isolated from the drive train and the road. That's why I got something older that I can wrench on for cheap. Not nearly as safe or efficient as modern vehicles, but the raw feeling of older cars makes them a blast to drive when the weather's nice."
MadMax,3bfrhp,Blasturtle,1 point,Sun Jun 28 21:52:33 2015 UTC,"That's awesome! I would love to have an older Mustang but I don't know much about cars and I don't have the money either :p I'm only 19 and I've been saving for awhile, I'd be happy with any of the 2005-2015 model Mustangs."
MadMax,3bfrhp,LegoWarBoys,1 point,Mon Jun 29 02:15:53 2015 UTC,"Right on. If I were you I'd keep an eye out for a 2005 - 2009 model. They're getting relatively cheap now that there have been two redesigns (2010 and 2015). Plus they sold a shitload of them before the Camaro and Challenger came out, so there are tons on the used market. They don't have that awesome Coyote 5.0 engine, but they still have a decent 4.6-liter V8 that makes a great sound while putting out 300 horsepower. More than enough to put a smile on your face."
MadMax,3bfrhp,that_kiwi_dude,1 point,Mon Jun 29 02:36:28 2015 UTC,Thanks for the advice! Good luck with finding an older muscle car/rat rod :)

MadMax,3bfrhp,dragoth13,3,Sun Jun 28 21:32:44 2015 UTC,"Those chopped rat rods do look amazing. I'd love to build one some day, but I'd probably have to get way better at fabrication first. You can sometimes find them on Craigslist for a few grand, but half the fun is building it yourself."
MadMax,3bhphe,ItsAmerico,6,Mon Jun 29 08:54:19 2015 UTC,"So the loose time line is Max was born about 1975. The events of the first movie is around mid 1990s, there's an energy crisis going on and outback gangs are getting out of control. After the first movie and between the second, thermonuclear war takes place, things are worse.  The time is around 1999. Beyond Thunderdome is some 16-18 years after film 2.   Though even Miller himself said there is very little continuity, if you put a gun to his head he'd say Fury Road happened after Beyond Thunderdome. You could loosely surmise Fury Road could be circa 2020 or there abouts and Max's age ~45."
MadMax,3bhphe,Derpatologist_7,3,Mon Jun 29 11:27:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah I see fury road as set before thunder dome,they are using methane(pig shit) to power the vehicles. But maybe where they were there wasn't a source of guzzleine..."
MadMax,3bhphe,g_rammed3000,2,Tue Jun 30 05:34:18 2015 UTC,"I actually thought Thunderdome was some years after Fury Road, but now I think you're right. He's got the long hair and nearly-destroyed outfit in Fury Road that matches the look he has in Thunderdome - then he gets his hair cut. It's not much to go on, but it could be that Fury Road is either set shortly after Thunderdome or long enough after Road Warrior for him to go completely feral and grow his hair out."
MadMax,3bhphe,Bevman00,5,Tue Jun 30 06:46:48 2015 UTC,"The Road Warrior wasn't society rebuilding so much as it was the very last remnant of society holding on.   Thunderdome was the rebuilding movie though.   In that regard, thematically, I think Fury Road sits kind of alongside Thunderdome - it's another fragment of 'society rebuilding'"
MadMax,3bhphe,nemothorx,1 point,Mon Jun 29 09:39:54 2015 UTC,"Well I meant with Road Warrior, more in the sense that the oil tanker people had built a refuge but it was bare bones. True it wasn't a real society though.  I just feel Fury Roads society seems so far along. No one seems to know anything of the world before. In Thunderdome it was really just the kids."
MadMax,3bhphe,aytakk,3,Mon Jun 29 16:19:56 2015 UTC,Thunderdome had Bartertown. Fury Road had Gastown and Bullettown. Seems to me they are alongside.  Immorten Joe's fortress could just be an old mine he moved into. Or an underground water pumping station built into an old mine.

MadMax,3bhphe,Solas67,2,Mon Jun 29 14:21:37 2015 UTC,"It's important to note in the backstory of Fury Road (which I appreciate most people haven't seen due to the shortage of Immortan Joe comics that hit) that the Citadel was already self-sufficient when Joe found it.   He didn't build it from the ground up, the mine and the refinery were already out there. He just conquered them. So timeline wise, it doesn't have to be that far in the future at all. Maybe a generation, twenty years, tops. Enough for the Warboys to be a thing, especially if they die young."
MadMax,3bhphe,Solas67,2,Tue Jun 30 11:37:25 2015 UTC,"That does answer a few things but still raises a few questions on the Warboys themselves and the whole cult mentality. While the Warboys have a ""half life"" they are still... Old. I mean most of the Warboys seem to be in their 20s? That would mean that at most this would be the second generation of Warboys? It just seems like a short amount of time to develop such a cult that is so oblivious to the ways of the old world. It seems like a vastly different world built in this film than the one presented in the previous three films."
MadMax,3bhphe,Solas67,2,Wed Jul 1 02:55:11 2015 UTC,Think about it like this: What of the Old World is -left- to be oblivious to? Cultures change and adapt faster than we think.

He kills his dude, drags him out of the sun-roof, and jumps down and takes control of his car. He's right there in the cab with the People Eater, and he doesn't look at him once. He sits there and glowers, staring straight ahead.  Like he's intentionally ignoring the giant blob of gross in the seat next to him.   People Eater plays dead for a few seconds, then pulls out his gun to try and kill Max. Even THEN Max barely looks at him while he disarms him and then makes him a human shield against Joe.

You're not the only one Max.""  I tried to remember that line from the movie, but I can't even think of the context in which that might have happened.  Max is surrounded by women and Nux, and the voice doesn't sound like any of them.  Then I Googled the line and IMDB attributes it to Immortan Joe... but, even if that is the actor saying the part, he doesn't have his weird distorted mask sound AND like you say, they don't even speak to each other.

MadMax,3bfu4d,IdiotsLantern,2,Mon Jun 29 00:20:40 2015 UTC,"Good point. I don't think they ate him, though."
MadMax,3bfu4d,Turbofurball,3,Mon Jun 29 07:34:20 2015 UTC,That was my assumption as well. Relics of a leader who was worshipped as much as Joe was could be valuable.
MadMax,3bfu4d,2718281828,6,Sun Jun 28 21:34:42 2015 UTC,"There's a fantastic episode of star trek deep space 9 where you find out that it's a Ferengi tradition to purchase body parts from famous dead business men. Quark finds out he had a terminal illness and accepts a lucrative bid on various orders of freeze dried Quark.   It turns out it was a sting from one of his rivals. He wasn't terminally ill at all but he had signed a contract to deliver his body parts by a specific date. He then faced a big dilema. Either kill himself to uphold the contract and die a true Ferengi or live and break the contract, deny his ferengi heritage and lose his licence to trade.  I know it wasn't the best show but it did have some great episodes."

MadMax,3bfu4d,nemothorx,13,Sun Jun 28 22:22:31 2015 UTC,"They don't eat him, they tear him to pieces. Basically they defile his corpse. It's the movie's way of telling you that for all the bowing and scraping he forced people to do, he couldn't make his people really revere him. The instant he was dead, they finally expressed how they really felt about him. THAT is his real legacy.   It also tells you something when the cheers go up when the common people see Furiosa. For all her tough reputation, the War Pups and the beggars LOVE her and demand she ascend to the Citadel.  You're just left to wonder for yourself exactly why she's so beloved. It can't just be that she killed the Immortan, since they didn't see that. It was Max, a stranger, who showed them the corpse and for all they know, HE killed the Immortan. But who killed him doesn't seem to matter. He's dead, and everyone is jumping at the chance to make HER the new leader. Why? We may never know."
MadMax,3bfu4d,N-Shifter,5,Sun Jun 28 21:42:21 2015 UTC,Imortan Joe's end is very reminiscent of the fates of numerous fascist leaders throughout history. In particular I'm thinking of what happened to Benito Mussolini in the final days of World War II as well as the videos of rebel fighters beating Muammar Gaddafi. The pictures are not for the faint of heart.
MadMax,3bfu4d,nemothorx,-2,Mon Jun 29 03:11:44 2015 UTC,are you sure (? .... ? ) they didn't eat him. i think i am interrupting this film different from you. to each their own. :D
MadMax,3bfu4d,IdiotsLantern,3,Sun Jun 28 22:25:30 2015 UTC,"Relatively sure.... Seen the film six times and I'm relative sure. If they'd eaten him I think we would have seen blood or other matter on thier faces wile the Wives pull them up onto the platform. I could be wrong, but it's my opinion they didn't eat him."
MadMax,3bfu4d,nemothorx,3,Mon Jun 29 00:26:14 2015 UTC,"I agree. If you are incredibly mad at a despot ruler and get the opportunity to lay your hands at him what would you do? Kick him, pummel him, rip him apart. He's already dead and there's a frenzied mob on him. This makes sense."
MadMax,3bfu4d,IdiotsLantern,1 point,Mon Jun 29 02:57:30 2015 UTC,he'd had hours to bleed out and cook on the engine. The lack of blood on faces isn't enough to convince me.

MadMax,3biow5,CesareaTinajero,2,Tue Jun 30 00:34:07 2015 UTC,I liked Megan Gale's character the most. she was hot and badass
MadMax,3biow5,VforVickers,2,Mon Jun 29 17:13:18 2015 UTC,I would have loved to see her as Wonder Woman. She would have been fantastic in a George Miller helmed production of the Justice League.
MadMax,3biow5,SmokeyPeanutRic,2,Tue Jun 30 19:02:26 2015 UTC,My favourite is The Dag mostly because I identify with her the most.
MadMax,3bhgsc,IanMazgelis,7,Mon Jun 29 06:44:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's funny how film editing has improved in the digital era, how Miller's vision hasn't had to be compromised as much as funding is easier to get, and how his own experience has helped make things better.   That said, I think you've written off the original too easily. It has a lot of subtlety going for it, but I don't think Miller was yet experienced enough to get  it to the screen coherently. Remember that it was his first full length film. I've described it as a student film before (and I know some object to that), but I stand by it. It's a film where he was learning as he went along (he admits that he still learns things every movie - which is a great attitude, but the progress is most obvious between first and second Mad Max IMHO)  Btw, you said ""I watched the original films"", but then also ""I'm not sure about seeing Beyond Thunderdome""  ...so... you've watched only two of the three original films?  Don't you think you should watch them all before collecting them all into one judgement?"
MadMax,3bhgsc,nemothorx,6,Mon Jun 29 06:55:00 2015 UTC,What's wrong with being like Burton's Batman? They are great films.
MadMax,3bhgsc,IndyBrodaSolo,2,Mon Jun 29 07:17:43 2015 UTC,"Yup, big fan of Batman (1989) here ... really don't care for Nolan's Batman films at all."
MadMax,3bhgsc,Turbofurball,3,Mon Jun 29 15:33:48 2015 UTC,I tried to watch the first Batman (1989) the other night and I was appalled.  I loved it when it came out and I'm glad you liked it but I was shocked at how dated and clumsy and cartoonish it all seemed with my present-day eyes.  But I'm glad it got made.

My opinions haven't changed on them since then, just gotten more in-depth.   Mad Max; a slow film. It seems more like a movie about Goose. The last ten minutes kicked all kinds of ass though.  Road Warrior; Great movie. Action was fun, I enjoyed it.  Thunderdome; Master-Blaster is cool, but, even when I was a kid, I knew it wasn't going to be as good because he lost all of his cool guns in the first fifteen minutes."
MadMax,3bhgsc,JustAPrankBro,1 point,Mon Jun 29 07:42:15 2015 UTC,"come on, the first 5 minutes of Mad Max kicked ass. It was one of the best opening chase scenes ever."
MadMax,3bhgsc,xenu99,3,Sun Jul 5 03:53:31 2015 UTC,the road warrior is a masterpiece in editing
MadMax,3bhgsc,Gnarbage,5,Mon Jun 29 14:08:53 2015 UTC,Each movie is also a product of its time. Action movies (at least Australian ones) in the 70s were fairly slowly paced. They try to be action and artsy at the same time. Case in point : The Cars That Ate Paris.  Fury Road on the other hand is made for an international audience with years of development in action movie expectations.
MadMax,3bhgsc,aytakk,3,Mon Jun 29 12:41:47 2015 UTC,"This, plus George Miller has said that he took full advantage of developments in film technology when making MMFR."
MadMax,3bhgsc,candleflame3,2,Mon Jun 29 14:20:42 2015 UTC,"I'll admit, even before watching Fury Road that the first Mad Max film was pretty difficult to sit through at first but I ended up loving it. As much as I think that Fury Road is better than the originals in all technical aspects, it doesn't have the charm of the originals. I have to say I like Road Warrior most due to this and a few more things like Mel Gibson's performance, it seems like they actually are Mad Max films and Fury Road is almost a spinoff, albeit a great one.   You said about not seeing Beyond Thunderdome, you didn't really miss much. I'd say it's the weakest of the series behind Road Warrior, Fury Road, and the original in that order."
MadMax,3bhgsc,ImLivingLikeLarry,6,Mon Jun 29 07:00:38 2015 UTC,"a few more things like Mel Gibson's performance   yeah. As good as Hardy was (and he was pretty damn great), I think Gibson's Max was better. Perhaps that'll change as we see more of this version of Max in the sequels (hopefully they will happen! :)"
MadMax,3bhgsc,nemothorx,3,Mon Jun 29 07:07:30 2015 UTC,"I have to give credit where credit is due and that goes to the seriousness Hardy brings to the table as Max, he seems even more broken and serious than the previous iterations after all that time trekking the vast nothingness. Really makes Max seem more dynamic, but I still love Gibson's Max more."
MadMax,3bhgsc,ImLivingLikeLarry,2,Mon Jun 29 07:20:46 2015 UTC,"yup.   And I think it's perhaps looking at other characters who have been played by different actors over time. James Bond, and The Doctor (Doctor Who). In both, each actor's version of the character is the same character, but yet emphasises different aspects of that character. Bond is always witty, but Roger Moore's Bond was especially so. The Doctor is alien, but Colin Baker's Doctor was especially so. Max (after his wife was killed) has always been broken, but in Fury Road... especially so."
MadMax,3bhgsc,nemothorx,2,Mon Jun 29 07:32:10 2015 UTC,You have to remember that the first one had a stupid small budget. The second one had only a bit better budget and was totally awesome.

MadMax,3bhgsc,sombray,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:37:35 2015 UTC,"The first one was very connected to the franchise! They reference it in every other Mad Max movie and it provides Max's backstory as to how he became ""a shell of a man"" and why he ""wandered into the wasteland."" Fury Road is only marginally better than Road Warrior, both are incredible films. I don't think Road Warrior could have been any better. I really like the first Mad Max and you have to consider that it is a 1979 low budget action film. I didn't really care for Thunderdome though, but it is still important to the film series."

MadMax,3be60z,BSS616,11,Sun Jun 28 11:15:01 2015 UTC,"Probably more symbolic for Joes perversion. Even with the chastity belts there's plenty of other ways the wives could have been abused by Rictus or anyone else. Joe didn't just seal them in a safe to stop them escaping. He sealed them there because they were his treasure, his property. The chastity belts were more an extension of Joe's sense of ownership rather than a genuine deterrent against other would be rapists. (Pretty sure there's more than one pair of bolt cutters left in the world). That's why in the movie they cut them off in distain rather than leaving them on to protect themselves against other would be attackers. That's not the purpose they serve."
MadMax,3be60z,teaqualizer,3,Sun Jun 28 15:08:16 2015 UTC,"Symbolism goes both ways. It's possible another reason to put belts on them isn't to stop the abuse, but to send the message to any man who looks at them that they are the sexual property of the Immortan Joe. Yes, they are branded like everyone else in the Citadel, but the belts would let you know who's exclusive use they were reserved for.  Yes, conceivably, you could cut the belts off, but you wouldn't be able to say you didn't know you were messing with another man's property when you did so."

We know Splendid is pregnant and at the end of the film Dag mentions she's pregnant, too.  Maybe a third one was pregnant?  It occurred to me that maybe only the pregnant wives get locked up with a chastity belt.  Not sure why, though.  Or maybe two other chastity belts were just off screen and my brain is working too hard."

MadMax,3b9bo3,Knightmaredog,5,Sat Jun 27 19:18:47 2015 UTC,Found this just now. Agreed.
MadMax,3b9f3k,DickyCrickets,15,Sat Jun 27 01:37:53 2015 UTC,"...That's amazing, because it introduces the concept of Witnessing and the ""Kami-Crazy"" part of the War Boyz culture before it's really explored later in the movie.   The Warboyz don't hesitate to throw themselves into suicidal situations because they believe that if they die doing their jobs, they get to go to Valhalla. This guy throws himself after Max, gets shaken off, and plunges to his death, and he's HAPPY. He wants everyone to see what he's just accomplished.   To quote another reviewer, ""maybe you didn't see it... but your brain did."""
MadMax,3b9f3k,IdiotsLantern,12,Sat Jun 27 04:47:50 2015 UTC,That's pretty mediocre.

MadMax,3b9f3k,TheSweetestKill,8,Sat Jun 27 14:56:23 2015 UTC,"I saw the film 5 times in the cinema, but I was watching the leaked film last night and I noticed a few things I hadn't picked up on the big screen.   One was the first witness that you have posted. The second one was when Max climbed atop the war rig to recouple the pod and they did the profile shot of him walking to the back there was Nux on the underside crawling his way to the front. Never noticed it before."
MadMax,3b9f3k,Derpatologist_7,6,Sat Jun 27 04:56:35 2015 UTC,"The leaked copy has subtitles, too, so I watched it with them on and learned a whole lot more (like what exactly Slit was saying when he was pointing and yelling at the sand storm - it was ""Fang it!"")"
MadMax,3b9f3k,Derpatologist_7,3,Sat Jun 27 20:50:33 2015 UTC,Furiosa said fang it as well. I know to non Aussies it probably sounded like faggot. Fang it is an older Australian slang word. I'm not sure it's been used widely since the '80s.
MadMax,3b9f3k,stargunner,2,Sat Jun 27 21:25:16 2015 UTC,"to those wondering what ""fang it"" means, if urban dictionary is to be believed it says:    To dump the clutch and go as fast as possible in the shortest possible time."

MadMax,3b9f3k,SteelToeAGoGo,3,Sat Jun 27 21:15:40 2015 UTC,"Does he actually say, ""witness""? I knew a guy took the plunge but never heard anyone say it."
MadMax,3b9f3k,Forty4Two2,2,Sat Jun 27 20:46:21 2015 UTC,"The subtitles say ""Witness!"", so I guess so."

MadMax,3bakro,danielbln,7,Sat Jun 27 10:35:49 2015 UTC,"They needed weight in the back of the pursuit vehicle so the blown out front tire wouldn't drag it. Slit didn't trust Max to not try to escape or fight or anything (rightfully so), so he was going to kill him and leave his body in the back to continue feeding blood to Nux.  He says something like ""Okay head, say bye bye to the neck, decapito!"" and was then I assume going to cut his throat or cut his head off. Clearly that didn't work out well for him."
MadMax,3bakro,TheSweetestKill,3,Sat Jun 27 14:58:47 2015 UTC,"Tell the truth, I've seen the film (cough cough) times by now and I don't even know for sure what was going on there.   They needed to move the Blood Bag to the back to balance the weight of the car. Slit gets on that, unhooks Max, and kind of throws him down onto the car windshield. Max and Nux look at each-other before Slit drags him onto the roof.   I don't know why Slit was going to kill Max. Was it because Max immediately started struggling (he did) and Slit just didn't want to deal with it? Would he have killed him either way because a corpse will make a better counterwight? And did Nux know or care? You can't get a transfusion from a corpse, but Nux seems to have enough blood by that point. Still, when he looked at Max through the windshield, he seems to be going, ""are you ok?"" and Max looks back kind of incredulously.   He's not surprised to see Max still alive when he wants someone to WITNESS his firey demise. But he also has no reaction when Slit falls from the car and he sets about sealing his cab against the sandstorm.   So yeah. I admit that I don't know."
MadMax,3bakro,IdiotsLantern,3,Sat Jun 27 17:45:49 2015 UTC,"I don't think that Nux knew Slit was going to kill Max, because as you said, he isn't surprised to see him still alive when he wants him to witness him, so he was clearly expecting him to still be alive. Besides Nux seems to be naive enough to think that the blood-bags accept their place in Citadel society, judging by the fact that he's genuinely surprised when Max doesn't want to witness him and tries to stop him from killing them both. He seemed to think that Max was going to happily go along with being killed just like a way boy would. Also, later when they subdue Furiosa and he's asking Max what he's going to ask for he's again surprised when Max doesn't respond to his camaraderie and instead sucker-punches him in the gut and leaves.  I think his lack of a reaction to Slit's fall can be explained by: they're tough and they can survive a lot, so Nux probably assumed that Slit was fine (which was true) or Slit had gone to Valhalla, which is a happy ending for a war boy and nothing to mourn about. Nux was busy enough at that moment planning his own fiery trip to Valhalla that it makes sense to me that he didn't spend a lot of time wondering where Slit was. He fell off the car. Either he was alive or he'd gone to Valhalla. Simple as that."
MadMax,3bakro,CharlieHarvey,5,Sat Jun 27 21:34:59 2015 UTC,"Say goodbye to the neck. Decapito! I'm not sure what his intentions were. The dude seemed psychopathic, though."
MadMax,3bakro,Derpatologist_7,2,Sat Jun 27 11:21:27 2015 UTC,"''Decapito!'', which seeing the O at the end sounds like latin for ''I behead you''.  Maybe Slit just didn't like how his prisoner was more handsome than him?"
MadMax,3bakro,Renjingles,0,Sat Jun 27 13:45:07 2015 UTC,"I know I'm late and already replied, but I watched this scene again and something clicked for me. Earlier in the scene, Max says ""That's my head!"" when Slit throws the lance right next to him. So Slit is calling him ""Head"" like it's a name when he says ""Hey Head, say bye-bye to the neck!"""

MadMax,3b78ez,avickthur,2,Fri Jun 26 16:02:13 2015 UTC,"It's from an unused intro voiceover, which was going to be from a third person perspective (I'm not sure who it was intended to be. Perhaps one of the history men who were also meant to appear much more than ended up happening.   Test audiences responded that it didn't work so well, and the intro change to first-person-Max was changed quite late in the piece."

The 3D is well done and doesn't take away from the movie but it also doesn't give much to it either. The only shot I can remember in 3D that took full use of the 3D was one in which an instrument comes flying at the camera and then slingshots back (trying not to give away any spoilers).   The only reason I saw it in 3D was it was the only IMAX screening available."

To the OP: if you're dedicated enough to see it multiple times, may as well see the variations that you wont get to see again, right?  For my taste, I thought the 2D was slightly better, except for that one 'obvious for the 3D' scene, which was distractingly out of place in 2D, but suited the 3D great.

MadMax,3b74yd,madcorewest,2,Fri Jun 26 19:57:04 2015 UTC,"I saw it twice, both times in 3D, and I intend to see it that way once more. The 3D looks really nice - especially knowing it's a post-conversion - and while it doesn't really add to the story, it does enhance the wow factor of the film as a whole (that sandstorm, man). Like other commenters said, there's only one gimmicky shot; everything else looks natural, the depth extends inside the screen and nothing pops out in your face. I'd say give it a try, you might be pleasantly surprised.  BTW, which films have you seen in 3D? From what I have seen, I'd say the ones that were definitely worth it were Coraline, Avatar, Jurassic Park and Fury Road."

Years ago I used to frequent a site related to mIRC scripting and ""negative comments"" were frowned upon, so people would post screenshots of their work which 8/10 were terrible and everyone would say great job, looks awesome, and I hated it because no one was being honest and I thought it stunted growth and development.

MadMax,3b56vq,Agfare,3,Fri Jun 26 02:36:31 2015 UTC,"That's kinda what I inferred with ""kamikaze"" being a Japanese word and Fukushima being a logical brain-jump over to that train.  Nuclear disaster sort of fits the whole post apocalyptic vibe but is there anything more to it?  I still feel like I might be missing something."
MadMax,3b56vq,MrGuttFeeling,15,Fri Jun 26 01:46:36 2015 UTC,"i think it (like a lot of wasteland slang) is based around loose inference of minimal cultural information from the past.  we're told at the beginning of the movie (and throughout the franchise) that nuclear war was a big factor in the destruction of the world.  also the war boys seem to be naturally irradiated, hence their half-lives.  throwing out the name fukushima (fucacima in the subtitles) seems to be another instance of semi-ignorant reference toward the old world.  the war boys probably think the word has something to do with radiation, which in turn has a lot to do with them.  they're an interesting culture, they worship V8 engines for goodness sakes.  I also enjoy the deliberate mispelling in the subtitles, as though the word remains in language but its origins are unknown."
MadMax,3b56vq,ZombieGears,4,Fri Jun 26 02:05:38 2015 UTC,"Awesome answer.  This makes a lot of sense to me.  I especially like how they refer to water as ""aqua cola"".  No one's had a damn Coca-Cola in god knows how many years but the word remains, at least partially, in their culture."
MadMax,3b56vq,Dragredder,3,Fri Jun 26 02:28:00 2015 UTC,"and what about Nux, telling about ""mcfeasting with the immorta in Valhalla""? this is a direct reference to McDonalds combined with the eternal feast of the bravest warriors in Valhalla."

MadMax,3b56vq,piotrdrag,0,Fri Jun 26 03:35:34 2015 UTC,I think kamakrazee is a play on words of 'kamikaze' and 'crazy' referring to their suicidal attack techniques.
MadMax,3b56vq,tyrefire2001,-3,Fri Jun 26 02:55:06 2015 UTC,"I believe the script does use the word Fukushima and it is implied that in this Mad Max universe the nuclear disaster from 2010 is what eventually escalated and ""killed the world"".

MadMax,3b587c,YouSmellOfButterfly,8,Fri Jun 26 01:57:09 2015 UTC,I think there is something wrong with his mouth or lips. His mouth looked bloody when he was tattooing Max and his lips look uneven(one side is bulging). I would guess he has some sort of cancer that keeps his mouth from closing correctly.

MadMax,3b1ytn,M3n747,2,Fri Jun 26 08:54:25 2015 UTC,"But ""8bit"", pedantically, is just colour depth. Resolution has nothing to do with it. My first computer was an Amiga with more than enough resolution to handle these individual images, yet it was only 4bit depth (Amiga 500). Some time later, I had an X11 thin terminal monitor which boasted (from memory) 1280x1024 resolution, and yet only 1bit depth! (I have screenshots. It was nuts).  But I get that you're saying that ""8bit"" isn't about a pedantic limitation of ""8 bit colour depth"" and nothing else, but is about an aesthetic which harks back to a certain game era. I'm saying something similar - that ""8bit"" is used as an umbrella term which covers things which are reminiscent of all generations of pixel art gaming :)"

As you said, it's not about dry numbers but a certain aesthetic - to me, ""8-bit"" means something that looks like it was made on a C64, Atari XL/XE, NES/Pegasus etc., whereas ""16-bit"" is something coming from an Amiga, SNES or Sega Mega Drive and thereabouts.  Indeed it looks like ""8-bit"" is used as an umbrella term and that irks me, because it seems that the term is used by people too young to remember those days and who can't see the difference between the two, because anything older than the PS3/X360 era is ancient history to them.

MadMax,3b22co,ChaosThe15th,24,Thu Jun 25 09:55:51 2015 UTC,In the swamp there were three main reasons they stopped:   Many of the vehicles were getting bogged and had to get pushed out. Immortan Joe's baby had to be cut out of one of his wives and they couldn't do that while moving. Max had put some mines down that had blown up a couple of cars making driving through the swamp much more dangerous.
MadMax,3b22co,SirM4trick,-2,Thu Jun 25 10:07:47 2015 UTC,all good points but now that it is pointed out it does seem pretty anti-climatic and unexplained in the movie.  i guess thats part of the reason i love this movie though is its better off unexplained.

MadMax,3b22co,RetroCorn,8,Fri Jun 26 08:58:11 2015 UTC,My guess is that it would've taken too long for them to get all of those vehicles through the swamp. The only way the bullet farmer was able to manage the swamp is because his vehicle was on a continuous tank track.

So, either, that entire area of the scene is warmed up to hell and back (kinda pointless cause the mask itself is obviously colored yellow, not to mention the rest of the face), or they went to such granularity in post to warm up that specific area of the film (why why why why why why why why why), OR they actual colored the ""real"" teeth red or warm enough to be seen as red.

My home town of Brisbane, Australia was really tiny at that time so we didn't get too much.   I remember thinking at the time that the first one was boring (sacrilege) but the second one smashed me in the face and I loved it. The same year I remember Thunderdome coming out and it was my least favourite.   And I just remembered why my sister took me to the movies.

MadMax,3aztc6,pmoon1,7,Wed Jun 24 20:46:32 2015 UTC,"TL;DR- hot rods are built for speed, hauler trucks aren't.   Even with tandem 2000hp V8s and bobtailing the rig, you wouldn't be able to outrun any of the smaller cars and trucks. The transmission and axle in say, Nux's coupe, are able to be made to function together easily with the tools available in the wasteland. I imagine something like a 454 pushing a 700R4 going into something like a Ford 9"" rear end.   Now the War Rig is based on a Tatra 815 chassis, which is a hollow tube with integrated independent axles. You're not gonna replace those axles, not even with a Corporate 14-bolt, because they're incredibly strong and also incredibly hard to service, not to mention you'd have to redesign the chassis (at which point you might as well just build a whole new truck with dump axles and scrap the 815).  So you're running 2 V8s into the Tatra transmission, transfer case, and axles. From the factory, trucks such as this are geared pretty low (numerically high) so as to make better use of the engine's low end torque to move heavy loads. You're not gonna find a re-gearing kit for a Tatra in the wasteland (possibly not even in real life), so even if you could get the engines up to 9000RPM, you'd still be capped by the transmission, transfer case and drive axles in terms of maximum speed.   I got distracted halfway through this dissertation- sorry if something doesn't make sense."
MadMax,3aztc6,hartke20g,3,Wed Jun 24 22:40:37 2015 UTC,Long story short it wasn't gonna go much faster if you took the tanker off.

After that, I'd join a forum for whatever make/model you have, since those guys know way too much about that particular car and can help you with anything you could think of.   Most importantly, it helps to just actually do more things. So go out and buy some inexpensive tools and start tinkering. Depending on what you have, it might be pretty easy to remove & clean out your intake, take your valve cover(s) off and clean the sludge and put a new gasket on, or even inspect & change your differential & fluid. Pick something you think you can do and start there."
MadMax,3aztc6,DudeBad,0,Mon Jun 29 17:03:47 2015 UTC,"I actually found a major flaw in your logic. The chassis, axles, and transmission were all capable of going faster. In the last part when they spew guzzoline into the blower, they actually went faster due to the extra hp it received. Thus, if it went faster when it received extra spike in hp, it was capable of going faster without the tanker."
MadMax,3aztc6,DudeBad,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:11:47 2015 UTC,"Most war-party cars were still capable of outrunning the War Rig (think Nux's coupe). Maybe not the Doof Wagon, but all the little runabouts and attack vehicles could.   IRL though, if you just start dumping high octane junk into your intake without precise control and instantaneous performance readouts, you'll probably just blow a rod and end up with a ventilation hole in your block that wasn't there before. From the info I got during that scene, all they were doing was pushing their engines past the redline, which does give you a temporary top speed boost, but at the cost of possibly blowing up your engine.   And yes, it could definitely go faster without the tanker since it wouldn't have to pull all that extra weight, but I'm sure any car in the war-party could still outrun it (they have to be able to go faster than whatever they're attacking, otherwise they'd never be able to keep up during a raid).   IMO, I would've kept the tanker attached, too. That's a big bludgeoning weapon to swing around at their attackers and definitely helped block the pass in the canyon at the end. They got more use from having the tanker than they would've from ditching it earlier."
MadMax,3aztc6,teaqualizer,10,Fri Jun 26 17:17:33 2015 UTC,Part of their plan was to decouple the tanker in the canyon and block the pass. so joe and the warboys could not get through before they took the citadel.
MadMax,3aztc6,tuskentheraider,2,Wed Jun 24 22:05:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah... I noticed that too, until one of the ladies responded by saying ""KABOOM..."" How could they assume that decoupling the tanker full of water have a large enough explosion to block the pass? Doesn't make any sense."

MadMax,3ay8tf,memberzs,4,Wed Jun 24 18:09:05 2015 UTC,"I liked the furiosa comic and it just added to her mystery.    SPOILERS: DO NOT READ FURTHER IF YOU DONT WANT SPOILERS!  It's the beginning of the story of how the new citadel was founded by Furiosa as told by a history man. It's not present tense telling of the story, but a historical account as passed down.   As with most historical texts embellishments of the Victor of war are added. Things like how immortan Joe liked the girls prepped like the war boys before breeding, insinuating his homosexual nature hidden from the people, or how abusive he was to the girls during sex. Based on fury road he cherished them as prized possessions and wouldn't harm them in fear of effecting their ability to bare a defect free child.  Though because of everyone's hatred he is given an even worse image to better the image of Furiosa as even more of a hero for ending his reign AND saving the girls from hell.  We know furiosa's story for the most part. She was taken, her mother killed, she traveled the ranks to eventually get her own war rig.  She has her mystery still how she lost her hand, how she went from spoils of war to champion of the people and trusted with a rig, plus things I'm not even remembering off hand.      I think most people had a different expectation of what we were getting here than what we got.  We got the beginning, just not the one expected. We got the beginning of fury road from a main characters point of view other wise left from the film."
MadMax,3ay8tf,DrinkMePotion,2,Wed Jun 24 20:09:04 2015 UTC,"I think most people had a different expectation of what we were getting here than what we got.   Pretty much. People were probably expecting a parallel running comic that would start from the same point - it doesn't. Along with that comes all of the story preceeding the movie, it's also a bit ridiculous to claim every issue will be about Furiosa's rape as the reviewer does. It's canon and we already knew that this happened, multiple times even. It's just part of her idendity."

Where in the comic is it communicated that we are meant to interpret the History Man as an unreliable narrator?  It wouldn't be hard to do. Have panels where the history man describes something while in the artwork we see something very different being shown, have characters talk in a single, stylized voice like one might hear in a distantly passed down verbal history...  In the panel of him talking to his audience, we see that he is an old man talking to a group of mostly children. If we are to view this as him changing the story to suit his audience and his message, why is an old man describing in graphic detail the instances of ovulation tracking, rape encounters, and attempted abortion to small children? What message is he trying to communicate with those details? What are we, the modern civilized audience, supposed to think of this unknown man who does that?"

It could be years or generations after fury road.   As far as embellishment, think about the stories of Caligula and his plans to make his beloved horse part of his consul, the historians that write this part of history lived decades after Caligula was assassinated. Was he truely this insane Roman emperor or did word of mouth over time evolve to the next level crazy.  The history man may be speaking the history as he was told meaning the panels would align with his words.  As for how graphically and candidly he spoke, its the wasteland morals are different than what we  are familiar with in our lives. He is simply speaking the reality of history he is charged with passing on to the next generation.  The wasteland is a world where murder, slavery, and rape is part of life that's shown in both mad max (the girl in the hot rod raped by toe cutters gang) and the road warrior (shortly after max meets the gyro captain and they see the road chase and take down) .

MadMax,3ay8u4,IdiotsLantern,8,Wed Jun 24 13:42:15 2015 UTC,"I understand your rage. What's frustrating to me is that the question here is about EXPLOITING rape in the comic, in other words the way that rape becomes the central defining feature of the situation and the characters to the point that all we see of them is it happening, their reactions to it, etc. But the answer treats the question as if it were about the bare presence of rape at all. In other words, I think it strawman's the question to make it easier to deal with. The presence of rape does make a difference to the narrative (it introduces the issue of creating life under another or one's own control, for instance) but the difference the answer suggests is laughable and kind of offensive (we'd see the girls as spoilt whiners without it ... wha? I agree with you that is face-desk worthy).   So basically, the real question is avoided, and a simpler one is substituted and then given a shitty answer."
MadMax,3ay8u4,adventurefine,10,Wed Jun 24 17:14:45 2015 UTC,"I wish people who know nothing of nothing would just shut up.   -- by an older man who's concerned with their safety.

MadMax,3ay8u4,ILiveIDieILiveAgain,4,Wed Jun 24 15:43:07 2015 UTC,"The problem with this is it implies that what Joe did wrong wasn't kidnapping and imprisoning women against their will. It was doing all of that AND being super mean. If he had just been a little nicer, they'd have just accepted and been more grateful for all the nice stuff he gave them and just taken the rape and had his babies with a lot less fuss."
MadMax,3ay8u4,teaqualizer,3,Wed Jun 24 16:41:14 2015 UTC,Not quite sure what you're banging your head against table for. Are you objecting to the use of rape in the story or people arguing against or in favour of the use of rape in the story?   Just not sure what your beef is.
MadMax,3ay8u4,BigTimStrange,8,Wed Jun 24 14:51:49 2015 UTC,"I'm objecting to the conception that people who are enslaved and held prisoner against their will only want to escape and be free if they are abso severely, brutally and repeatedly abused. The implication is if Joe had just refrained from quite so much rape, the wives would have had nothing to complain about and should have enjoyed thier baths and been grateful. You really need all the rape to ""understand"" the desire for freedom in girls who after all can drink all the water they want.   It's so stupid. And it implies that freedom by itself has no value. You can live contentedly in cage if only your captor refrains from abusing you too much.   That is my beef."
MadMax,3ay8u4,teaqualizer,2,Wed Jun 24 15:31:41 2015 UTC,"Here's the thing: as we've seen in the comments, without the rape angle it's arguable that the Wives situation isn't that bad considering the world of the Wasteland.   There is no black and white answer. Both the Wives and the citizens of the Citadel have freedoms and restrictions. Is imprisonment worse than radiation-induced cancer, starvation, murdering others to survive? The Many Mothers set up a Damsel in Distress trap and it's implied that people who fell for it were shot in the back of the head from a distance and their possessions taken. Even Max, who has gone insane trying to help people, has been reduced to a feral dog willing to hurt or abandon people to death in order to survive.   The Wives being Joe's breeders makes it clear cut that their situation is the worst option in the Wasteland.   It's also reflective of the real world. What's happening in the Citadel is perpetrated by ISIS, Boko Haram, etc and the story gives us a great opportunity to discuss what's happening in the real world."
MadMax,3ay8u4,TweetsInCommentsBot,4,Thu Jun 25 01:03:40 2015 UTC,"without the rape angle it's arguable that the Wives situation isn't that bad considering the world of the Wasteland.    Here's the thing: if Joe opened up his vault, showed these women all his nice stuff and said, ""you are here because all of you are beautiful pure-bred full-lifes. I will give you all of these things, books and music, food and water, and protect you as long as I live. In exchange, I want you to give me sons. Now you can either leave, or stay here as my wife. It's your decision.""   That's is WORLDS different then going, ""Hey, a purebred full-life! I'll stick her in a vault before someone else grabs her. Horray, a healthy baby maker! Look, you can have all this stuff...well it's MY stuff, but I'll let you use it when I'm not around! Aren't you grateful? Now get over here. We are making a baby. Right now.""    The life of an Immortan's wife might not have been objectively bad, at least from a material comfort level, and some might actually WANT it, but the point is choice isn't an option in either case. Full-life fertile women are so rare that you can't risk one of them choosing WRONG, not when YOUR legacy is on the line! Stick her in that vault and close the door. If she decides she likes it, fine, if not, well, there are bigger things at stake here. She'll see that eventually. Or not. It doesn't really matter as long as the baby is healthy."
MadMax,3ay8u4,teaqualizer,-1,Thu Jun 25 02:46:51 2015 UTC,"You've got really good form of offering keen insights on this sub but I think you've gone a bit off course here.  What's telling is that you are qualifying what you are saying with the words ""too much"". This in itself implies that you know it was absolutely necessary for the wives to be abused by Joe for the story to work (otherwise you'd have proposed a hypothetical where there was no abuse whatsoever). How much abuse is "" not too much"" abuse?  I've not read the comic but watching the film the fact that those women were being sexually abused was the foremost motivation for their escape. That's not to in any way deny the desire for freedom you've described but the abuse was needed as a catalyst for the escape attempt. And for one of the wives the abuse still wasn't even enough to want to leave the comfort of their cell. So if they were just willing prisoners living in luxury like Beauty and the Beast it would be very hard to sell that they'd want to face the uncertainty of the desert or that they'd have such strong hatred for Joe.  What did they scrawl on the walls? ""we will not be caged?"" No. They scrawled ""we are not things"" and ""our sons will not be warlords"" these are both statements that relate back to abuse rather than imprisonment."
MadMax,3ay8u4,LogicalTimber,6,Wed Jun 24 16:48:01 2015 UTC,"...Well, to be fair, according to this comic they didn't write anything on the walls. Miss Gitty did it for them, because apparently even their own battle cry had to come from someone else.   But I apologize for the hyperbole. I have not presented myself properly here.  Yes, I know that the Wives were abused. It's a key part of their backstory. Any attempt to tell the tale of how they managed to move from the locked vault to the belly of the War Rig is going to have to at least touch on what went on in the vault, obvious as it is.  The problem is when that assault is all you get. None of the Wives telling each-other stories, practicing music, asking each other questions, exchanging ideas, being people. We don't have time for any of that. We have to cram as much rape as possible into this one issue, otherwise you won't get why Furiosa might suddenly decide she feels for these ""spoiled young girls"" who get all the water and food and baths they want.  The problem is, as you say... too much. Something that Mark Sexton apparently does not get:   It starts out well enough    This IS the story that George Miller had. Written by the people who wrote the screenplay for the film.   Ok...  but still, I accept that. BUT THEN!    All I would like to say is that we tried to tell a story that really explained WHY the Wives fled the Citadel -and how Furiosa - a battle-scarred, hard and almost emotionally deadened warrior - came to help them. The world of the story is a brutal place, and what Immortan Joe was doing was brutal and ugly. And the poor Wives are trapped in this godawful situation. We thought it was important to show how ugly it was, because that gives further weight to how Furiosa becomes moved in some small way to empathise. And then to help them.and we wanted it to feel hard-earned, not easy or nice. Because when you really think about the world of Fury Road, it really isn't nice. at all. It's actually incredibly sad. Humanity on the edge of extinction.   Don't you get it?? You HAD to see the ""poor Wives"" get raped so much because otherwise, how would you know that being a warlord's sex slave is a 'godawful situation?' Furiosa had to watch all that rape, otherwise her choice to help them just wouldn't be plausible, because she's 'hardened,' and 'emotionally deadened'... The rape was really there for her, because otherwise there's no way she'd really believe that being a sex slave was worse then being a warrior with a war rig and a whole squad of fighters under your command.   And he pointedly ignores things like the sacred rape baby abortion sequence, the women's general cattiness and lack of agency, the sacred unpoisoned purity of the virgin, ""it's going to be BEAUTIFUL,"" the lack of respect the women have for each-other, that Furiosa herself didn't even really believe in the Green Place anymore and had to be talked into it by the starry eyed girl-children around her, girl children who didn't even have the gumpsion to write their own messages of defiance on the walls of their former prison...   Argle blargle.   The deeper I go, the angrier and sadder I get. I love this movie. I haven't loved a movie this much in ages... I keep trying to be done with this lame ass piece if shit comic I really do... This hurts me."

(Again remember that I haven't read the comics)   It sounds like you had an idea in mind of what you wanted and got something totally different that was disturbing rather than entertaining.   I know how much you love that film and writing about so it's a shame the comic let you down so hard.
MadMax,3ay8u4,teaqualizer,7,Wed Jun 24 22:31:29 2015 UTC,"You're treating it like 'imprisonment' and 'abuse' are separate things. They are not.   It bothers me how many people seem not to get that - the writers of the comic book among them. Being controlled by someone else is horrific, whether or not there's rape involved. Abusers don't have to be violent to be abusive. But someone a lot of people seem to think that if Joe's not a violent rapist, the plot would fall apart and the women would have no motive for escape. Not actually the case."
MadMax,3ay8u4,LogicalTimber,-2,Wed Jun 24 20:40:31 2015 UTC,"Firstly I haven't read the comic so I'm only going on what I've seen in the film and heard a bit about here.   No I'm not treating it like they are separate. You can't habitually rape someone who isn't a imprisoned. In such a harsh environment as the mad Max universe the wives were living in relative security and luxury. Many of the people at the bottom of the citadel would have gladly allowed Joe to have his way with them if it meant access to food and security. Women reluctantly agreeing to degrade themselves for a chance at security isn't anything new   If Joe hadn't been violent with them, if he'd been apologetic in his approach to fathering his children, then Stockholm Syndrome would have set in with the luxury of the prison being a way to reconcile the situation. But being violently raped by a gross old man on a regular basis would be the kind of thing would stop someone from being institutionalised. Saying that doesn't diminish their status as prisoners. It makes their imprisonment even more severe.   Could they have gone a different route to make them motivated to escape? Probably. But most women would consider rape the ultimate violation so violent sexual imprisonment is a pretty believable motivator for 5 women to all agree to escape a prison that offered security in a mad world. I've not seen anyone complaining that it didn't make sense for them to want to escape."
MadMax,3ay8u4,teaqualizer,7,Wed Jun 24 21:28:31 2015 UTC,"What you and the authors of the comic seem to be saying is that if they weren't being violently raped, the women wouldn't have had a believable motivation to escape. That simply being imprisoned (albeit in luxurious surroundings) isn't enough of a motivation on its own. Is that accurate?"

MadMax,3ay8u4,SirM4trick,0,Wed Jun 24 23:51:52 2015 UTC,"But he's not saying that. You're inferring it.   ""A few people are saying that you are exploiting rape in the first issue, what would you say to that?  Best answer is that the use of institutionalised rape by Immortan Joe is not only central to the story but without it, the story could be viewed merely as a bunch of young spoilt girls whining about being kept in relative luxury by an older man who's concerned with their safety. Not really much room for dramatic tension there..!""  The key sentence there is ""could be viewed"". He's not implying that's the way he'd see it but rather the way that some people might see it and he's right. Without the sexual abuse element the internet would be flooded with people asking why the hell they'd leave the security that Joe provided. The film simply wouldn't function if Joe had just kept them locked up and didn't abuse them in any way like he was some ogre from a fairy tale. They despise Joe. That's why it's believable that they'd leave the citadel. Survival is more important to people than freedom. It's why most people agree to go to prison rather than make a run for it. A safe cage is better than no man's land.  Edit: 1 in the morning here so I'll not be able to respond for a long time."
MadMax,3ay8u4,Turbofurball,5,Thu Jun 25 00:35:00 2015 UTC,"The key sentence there is ""could be viewed"". He's not implying that's the way he'd see it but rather the way that some people might see it and he's right.   So you're no longer defending that viewpoint?   ""Well we're not sexist\racist\etc but other people are, so we had to make it so they'd understand"" is bullshit, especially when the movie didn't function that way.   I doubt that we're going to come to agreement here, but thanks for the civil discussion."
MadMax,3ay8u4,Turbofurball,2,Thu Jun 25 01:08:57 2015 UTC,"But he's not saying that. You're inferring it.    Except he DOES say that, when he talks about how much time they spent worrying if the events of the comic were ""possible.""     The most common debate we had while writing these scripts was, ""Does that seem believable? Does it seem possible?"" If the answer was yes, then we'd run with it. Things had to feel like they could be real and could actually happen. That was tough to do, but rewarding.   ... And he decided that all of this rape was the best, most 'real' way to present it.   Do you understand? I'm pleading here..."
MadMax,3ay8u4,SirM4trick,3,Thu Jun 25 00:44:54 2015 UTC,"If Joe hadn't been violent with them, if he'd been apologetic in his approach to fathering his children, then Stockholm Syndrome would have set in with the luxury of the prison being a way to reconcile the situation.   ... and there it is.   You. Can't. Possibly. Know this. And the idea that the Wives would have had no valid reason to object to a lifetime of sexual slavery and imprisonment if only Joe had been a little nicer to them is an insult not just to them, but to everyone who values freedom and the power to make your own choices.   They are prisoners. They are slaves. They did what they had to do to survive, we always do, but you should not need it explained to you via repeated and graphic rape scenes ""why"" someone would possibly object to the situation, no matter how nice the soft beds are.   Yes the wives clearly had problems beyond just the door that locked them in. But that these writers didn't trust that we'd sympathize with any kind of desire for freedom UNLESS it was also clear that they spent morning noon and night in sex slave hell with the cruelest most disgusting man on the planet... What? Really?   Someone put me out of my misery. I can't do this any more."
MadMax,3ay8u4,SirM4trick,0,Wed Jun 24 22:40:00 2015 UTC,"What's clear is that you are passionate about this but what isn't clear is when are using sarcasm or not.   You. Can't. Possibly. Know this. And the idea that the Wives would have had no valid reason to object to a lifetime of sexual slavery and imprisonment if only Joe had been a little nicer to them is an insult not just to them, but to everyone who values freedom and the power to make your own choices.    You suggested this not me. But again very difficult to read the intention of what you are trying to say when you switch between sarcasm and anger.   They are prisoners. They are slaves. They did what they had to do to survive, we always do, but you should not need it explained to you via repeated and graphic rape scenes ""why"" someone would possibly object to the situation, no matter how nice the soft beds are.    The key sentence there is ""they did what they had to do to survive"". In the world of mad Max the citadel stronghold was clearly their strongest chance for survival. It's not the comfort of the prison that might have seen them want to stay, it's the security. That instinct for survival, that reptilian brain that Theron likes to talk about would tell them to stay put and stay safe. For all 5 of them to abandon that instinct without a very compelling reason to do so would have seen forums flooded with people complaining about them leaving the only place they could have realistically expected to survive in.    Yes the wives clearly had problems beyond just the door that locked them in. But that these writers didn't trust that we'd sympathize with any kind of desire for freedom UNLESS it was also clear that they spent morning noon and night in sex slave hell with the cruelest most disgusting man on the planet... What? Really?    It's seems that you don't have a problem with the logic behind making rape one of the main motivators for the escape. You're main beef is that what is merely implied in the movie is depicted explicitly and repeatedly in the comics. Why reinforce something you already know right? I can totally understand how that would annoy you but it shouldn't lead you to start questioning the validity of rape being a legitimate motivator for the escape or lead to you accusing the writers of belittling the injustice of imprisonment.   The reason why the movie has the intensity it does is not because they are escaping the citadel, it's because they are specifically escaping Joe. When Anghard opens the door to lean out of the cab she's not doing that to save Furiosa, she's doing it to save her only chance of escape. Go back and read your ""lets talk about the wives"" post and try to imagine how many of those observations would go out the window if the wives were fleeing a cage instead of a monster.  If the film was full of distressing rape scenes it wouldn't have gotten the rating it did and I probably wouldn't have seen it more than once in the cinema. Comics are a different medium that tend to focus more on the cruelty rather than action. That yellow bastard is fully naked in the sin city graphic novel. In the movie he wears a pair of purple silk under shorts for that scene. I'm not arguing that the depiction of rape in the comics isn't excessive. (I haven't even read them) But your revulsion at this seems to be leading you to question the validity of the implied character motivations of a film you paid to see six times without any such issue."
MadMax,3ay8u4,SirM4trick,7,Thu Jun 25 00:09:10 2015 UTC,"Movie theory? What are you talking about?   And yes I am aware I am worked up about this. I can't help it. This shit makes me angry. Rape and kidnapping and sexual slavery is a real thing that happens, and the human beings who live through it are not ""selfish"" for wanting to live lives, even difficult lives, free of abuse and imprisonment.    The movie portrayed this so well. This comic couldn't have missed the whole point of a break for freedom any harder if the point was on a whole different continent."
MadMax,3ay8u4,ILiveIDieILiveAgain,0,Wed Jun 24 16:26:38 2015 UTC,"I have yet to get around to reading the comic but from watching the movie and just things that I have heard I think he has a point, maybe they wouldn't be 'spoiled' but there lives wouldn't have been as bad as the people outside the vault. I feel raping them added to there suffering therefore their willingness to run away."
MadMax,3ay8u4,BigTimStrange,3,Wed Jun 24 16:57:48 2015 UTC,"It may have added to it, but who would want to be locked in the same couple of rooms all the time?  A gilded cage is still a cage ;-)"
MadMax,3ay8u4,SirM4trick,6,Wed Jun 24 13:46:48 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind, Joe didn't ASK any of these women if this was what they wanted. He just kind of threw them in, locked the door, and went, ""it's for their own good."" And then he's stunned that they might happen to disagree.   Maybe it's just me, but I never needed to ask myself why these people would risk life and limb on the wasteland rather then remain prisoners, rape or no rape. Freedom is not a selfish luxury, it's a human right, and control over your destiny is something worth fighting for in and of itself."
MadMax,3ay8u4,BigTimStrange,2,Wed Jun 24 13:52:07 2015 UTC,Absolutely!
MadMax,3ay8u4,BigTimStrange,4,Wed Jun 24 14:03:21 2015 UTC,"... Huh?   So do you think all the slaves who happened to belong to people who don't mistreat them should be happy with their lot as long as everyone else has it worse? Kind of like in the South, how all the field slaves were envious of the house slaves because the house slaves got nice clothes and softer beds?  This guy locks women in a vault. IN A VAULT. Like with a giant bank door on it and everything. And he feels like he's right to do it, like these women NEED him and should be grateful that he's looking after them.   C'mon dude. Sanctity of freedom and all that. It shouldn't matter how nice your locked cage is, you are not ""spoiled"" if you want to live your own life and decide your own fate."

MadMax,3ay8u4,firerocman,6,Wed Jun 24 13:52:00 2015 UTC,"They still don't have freedom. The people at the foot of the citadel are at least free to leave if they want to. Sure, they'll probably die, but at least they have that much control over their lives.   It's not a question of having it ""good,"" it's a question of being free. People have always yearned for that.

That's Joe's attitude, to pout that the wives aren't grateful that he's given them so many luxuries (while keeping them as sex slaves). Not Furiosa's. Not any of the women's."
MadMax,3auz79,LogicalTimber,1 point,Tue Jun 23 21:56:28 2015 UTC,I've seen that panel too and been debating this with others here. I've not read the comic but this particular panel seems to be the one that annoyed people the most and features most in articles criticising the comic.  Really I think the problem with that panel is that it fails to get across the writer's intent. If Charlize had acted it things would have been clearer. That's not Furiosa getting angry because the wives are ungrateful. That's her getting angry because the horror of the wives situation is stirring the guilt in her over being complicit in Joe's regime and therefore also being complicit in their abuse. She's really trying to justify their situation to herself rather than the wives. She's confused and angry when faced with the reality of a situation she's chosen to ignore. She's trying to dispel her own guilt and takes it out on them.  People have argued that for Furiosa the fact that the wives were imprisoned should have been reason enough for her to want to help them. But the thing is the sight of imprisonment is nothing new for Furiosa. You can be sure that Max is not the only caged bloodbag dotted throughout the citadel where Furiosa has risen through the ranks and witnessed many people imprisoned against their will. So what makes the wives different? Why help them? These are the questions that the writers are referring to when they talk about the story being believable.

MadMax,3auz79,shitcock55,10,Sun Jun 28 18:11:02 2015 UTC,I read it too. The comic does lack a lot of meat and tells very little if any backstory to Furiosa. They even ask how she lost her arm - no response. The comic should have been named after the Wives' desire for freedom because that's where the comic starts.  I want to say that the reasoning behind such a meager story is the fact that Furiosa still has a story to be told in future movies. So shitty? Yeah. I hope the next is better.
MadMax,3auz79,schneiderwm,12,Tue Jun 23 19:51:30 2015 UTC,"It also leaves out key parts of the WIVES back stories. Angharad has scars on her arm. She's a cutter. It's not in the comic.   Toast cut her hair short to try and appear less feminine and attractive to Joe. Also not in the comic...in fact the comic implies he would have enjoyed that because he's really gay because of course the villain would be gay and the supermodel harem is just a beard to disguise his real inclinations.   So shitty. So so shitty.  The next one might not be better, but I have a hard time imagining it being worse."
MadMax,3auz79,IdiotsLantern,4,Tue Jun 23 23:48:15 2015 UTC,Dang I was really looking forward to this. Looked at some reviews while I was skimming through it at the comic book store and decided against it.

MadMax,3auz79,BigTimStrange,16,Wed Jun 24 01:53:12 2015 UTC,"No, but I do believe the people handling the comic did so with different information, and long before the final film was complete. They also completely lacked George's subtle touch with the sensitive subject matter. At the bare minimum he knew you didn't need to SEE the rape to know it was bad.   Quoth Nico   I ask you to remember that ""Fury Road"" was written 15 or so years ago. At the time I joined it 13 years ago as a script and story analyst, the bare bones of Furiosa's story were obvious from the script and storyboards. As work continued and we began to build the world in ever-increasing detail, time to reflect led to questions about her past.....We did have the advantage that each of these stories had their genesis in the backstories that George concocted during the pre-production process. Some of them are still very much his original idea, while others have evolved.     ... Translation: George's ideas are the ""basis"" for this, but they have ""evolved"" to suit the comic medium (and the new creative team.) Basically this whole interview is them obviously pitching for a Furiosa series, because if there's anyone you want to read a whole comic series about, it's a pro-rape 'man without balls' who thinks nice baths and rape and anal rape and rape baby-making is a future to be grateful for and backhands women who don't agree because how selfish are THEY?    And always the question: How did the Wives manage to convince Furiosa, a proud warrior and high-ranking Imperator in the Immortan's army to help them escape?    ...The answer ended up being, ""She just got sick of watching them being raped and trying to abort their rape babies (BABIE KILLER!!) and he was going to de-virginize and ruin the one virgin in the group and maybe all those nice baths weren't really worth all the anal rape after all. Also Miss Gitty talked her into it. And the wives, who have been berating her for her non-intervention and throwing gendered insults at her the entire comic turn around and suddenly say, 'Oh thank you kind savior, you have inspired us to be strong!' Yup. That's what's most plausible.  Oh, and the chastity belts? We'll throw them in as an afterthought. Otherwise we'd have to come up with some more creative reason for them to know about and interact with Furiosa, since you don't put belts on women who are only going to be seen by you and another woman and each-other. And who has time for that? The chastity belts are punishment. Sure, they make you immune to rape, but...  they are really uncomfortable! I bet you are sorry now!""    It gives us a wonderful chance to see more of what Immortan Joe had created in order to guarantee the future of his rule -- and perhaps give more of an understanding as to why the Wives wanted to escape so badly.   ... You need to understand, like REALLY understand, that the Wives really wanted to escape because of all the rape. If only Joe hadn't been so rapey, the wives would have had no objections to being his captives, because if you get all the books and baths and music sheets you want, what kind of selfish petty little person would EVER want to be free? I mean...you can probably take your book into the bath if you want to! What's freedom compared to that??   ... Sorry, again, I keep deciding I'm done venting my spleen about this and it keeps not being true. Forgive me. I really am trying. ARGH."
MadMax,3auz79,IdiotsLantern,5,Wed Jun 24 05:13:04 2015 UTC,I continue to love you.
MadMax,3auz79,2Weird2Live2Rare2Die,0,Wed Jun 24 12:16:42 2015 UTC,"Furiosa comic book is pretty good. Do you really think that in the the Mad Max Wasteland that Immortan Joe and the War Boys would take in consideration the feelings and rights of this ""Prized Breeders""? I would say a man who thinks that he's a god and that all of the wastelanders who rely on Joe for the occasional water he provides are his followers, I would say that this ladies' rights are coming in last. Also I would just like to remind everyone that this is a fictitious world and none of these characters exist."
MadMax,3auz79,Canamcrue,-4,Thu Jun 25 14:04:19 2015 UTC,"While it didn't focus on Furiosa, making the title misleading, I did appreciate the dark tone being used to emphasize why the wives are running away from the Citadel, despite the resources they are given. It made Immortan Joe darker and more despicable than portrayed in the movie which I enjoyed after going back and watching Fury Road (for the 4th time), making his death even more satisfying. All of that being said, it's not a fun read and not the same tone as Fury Road."
MadMax,3auz79,nathanfraas,11,Tue Jun 23 22:24:22 2015 UTC,"I did appreciate the dark tone being used to emphasize why the wives are running away from the Citadel, despite the resources they are given.   Yeah, how much rape does it really take before those nice baths just aren't worth it anymore??   The fact that the comic needed to spend so much time on WHY these women might possibly want to escape from sexual slavery... that kind of sums up what's wrong with the whole comic, right there, for me.   And that leaves aside the female cattiness, the precious bundles of rape baby joy who must be protected at all costs, Cheedo's unpoisoned virginity, and the total lack of agency that robs the Wives of being capable of even thinking up their own ""We are not things"" mantra without Furiosa there to inspire them to be strong, you know, after she's done with watching them get raped...  All of that sucks too.   Sorry.... I shouldn't be taking this out on you. It's this comic, man. It makes me angry.   I'll be done venting about it soon, but not quite yet."

MadMax,3auckw,TheDevilsAdvocat,-25,Tue Jun 23 19:48:20 2015 UTC,"So glad I downloaded it and didn't check it in the theater like I initially planned. No idea why these actors let themselves be put in a B movie. ""The Chase"" with Charlie Sheen had more character development and more nerve wracking action scenes.  Wtf was wrong with Tom Hardy's voice? It felt like he dubbed all of his lines from a clean air conditioned studio. His gestures while talking were weird and either delayed or done too soon and didn't fit the dialogue. I get that his character hasn't spoken in forever and has been alone, but c'mon, this was just totally off. Charlize delivered her lines fine and the audio for them didn't sound weird, so no idea what Tom's problem was.  Nothing at all made me care about Max. I probably felt more for Nux than any other char. All the other characters were predictably boring. And I know mad max has always fucked around with the practical vs ridiculous, but really... did we really need the guitar playing minion like some apocalyptic drummer boy?  If this movie wasn't thrown in the mad max universe and flew under an original title, it would've bombed and people would've made fun of it for being a michael bay wet dream."

I like abandoning a linear time line, but how do you keep Max a relatively young ex-cop when he's 50 years past copdom? Well, you make him a cop again. He runs into a rag-tag community that recruits him as some sort of order-keeper (due to his background and after much protesting from Max). He could help fend off attacks on a fortified compound, ala Road Warrior, or become some 1-man Judge Dreadish apocalyptic highway patrolman. Naturally, at the end of the movie, he would rip the make-shift badge off his leather jacket and throw it into the dust, but then we could safely jump 100 into the wasteland future and never worry about him being referred to as an ex-cop."

(but it didn't get much (perhaps any?) screen time.  I can easily imagine a Mad Max esque world with a road war, but based on far more fuel efficient (and electric/hybrid) vehicles.

MadMax,3ar3ed,VikingSlayer,2,Tue Jun 23 07:15:44 2015 UTC,"MPG isn't really an issue, you need speed, acceleration and power to be able to either escape and survive, or to chase someone down.  A 1.8 litre 115hp engine might get you 35 MPG for a long trip, but it doesn't do you any good if you're getting chased down by a custom built pursuit vehicle, or if you're trying to chase down the Interceptor.  There's a few things to consider:  1) Gas Town is supplying their fleet, the Citadel and the Bullet Farm with plenty of gas for how many vehicles they need.  Gas isn't a massive concern for those groups.  But even the People Eater mentions how much the chase for the wives is ""costing.""  Fuel is, however, important for groups like the Rock Riders, who all exclusively ride motorcycles (a very fuel efficient choice).  2) All the vehicles in Fury Road a custom built for a purpose.  Even the re-built Interceptor has a large fuel tank on the back to help compensate for needing speed in addition for needing to travel long distances.  Joe's fleet for example has pursuit vehicles that are only about chasing down other cars in the Wasteland.  You don't care about gas mileage in those situations.  The War Rig and The People Eater's limo/truck thing both seem to be built to be able to re-fuel vehicles on the fly as needed.  3) There certainly could be more fuel efficient vehicles out in the world in other areas, however a movie about Honda Civics and Hybrids slowing traveling over the Wasteland isn't as exciting as someone on the hood of a car spitting nito methane into the intake to make flames shoot out the exhaust ;)"

Except instead of battery and starter motor and alternator and lights, you'd have batteries and motor and generator and lights. Don't need anything else :)  [edit/appendum: I'd even say that the lights are a luxury, but we saw that they all had lights in Fury Road, so it's clearly something they think is important enough to ensure their vehicles have :) ]"
MadMax,3ar3ed,nemothorx,1 point,Tue Jun 23 12:25:22 2015 UTC,Exactly. My dad has an old MG in his garage that has points instead of a computer. If he had to he could make a gravity feed system for guzzoline. Older cars are a lot more simple and easy to maintain as long as parts still exist.

In terms of driving practicality... well, I have an engine with far fewer moving parts, and no reliance on (likely very dusty in the wastelands) air for the engine to work.   A couple more notes/thoughts:   I'd probably arrange a bunch of panels as a sail along the top - to catch sunrise and sunset as much as possible. (think of the spines on the Dimetrodon: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimetrodon#/media/File:Dimetrodon8DB.jpg ) For maximising found resources (and range anxiety), there is a good case that you'd have a small petrol engine that powers en electrical generator. This engine wouldn't be connected to the drivetrain, so could run at maximum efficiency (thus maximising fuel economy and minimising engine wear) regardless of actual driving needs of the moment.  Electric motor is hell of a stealth car in the V8 Mad Max world.   It's completely unlike traditional Mad Max vehicles I grant you. But I don't think it's any less impractical! :)  The above is all based on a theoretical ""descent to Mad Max esque world, but from the world (and vehicles) of today"". I'd probably base my vehicle from a Toyota Sera - butterflywing doors allows for some interesting action potential (doors hold open at 60 km/h - I know this from testing in my own car ;)  A hypothetical more like Max's world, civilisation crumbling in the 70s, then I'd probably aim for a panelvan - for my ""carry everything I might need"" instinct (especially for extra fuel tanks, extra spare tyres, etc!)"

MadMax,3aoqq9,nemothorx,1 point,Mon Jun 22 23:00:30 2015 UTC,"I think Nico was the professional writer who got booted by George when he didn't want to work with Brendan McCarthy.

While there are valid points in the article, there are a few points that I feel are reaching a little.   I don't like that the writer takes issue with the fact that the wives are sceptical about Furiosa upon her arrival.   After hearing that she’s there to protect them, one of the wives marvels “but who’s going to protect us from her?” What.  The wives could have (and this would have seemed vastly more realistic to me) been actually interested in Furiosa when she first was assigned them. “You’re a warrior? You drive a war rig? What is that like? How is it better than this? How is it worse than this?”   I don't understand why they would, at least initially, want to engage Furiosa in polite conversation. Furiosa was installed there by Joe. Joe is their captor and their abuser and a major cause of much of their anguish. Surely the wives would see Furiosa as someone loyal to Joe, and so someone they shouldn't trust. We wouldn't expect the wives to engage in polite conversation with the medic when he comes to visit, so I'm not sure why they would do so with Furiosa, another solider of Joe's."

Hmm well we'd have Furiosa be assigned to guard the wives because she won't rape them even though they have chastity belts on and should be immune to rape (they'd conveniently forget all about the belts, because having belts means they don't need Furiosa, so instead of control they get the belts as punishment for being defiant. Yup. That's totally the point of chastity belts.) We'd have the wives be all weirded out that there's a woman fighter, omg. We'd have the girls wind up bonding while they just hang out in the vault for no reason. Furiosa would be there and see everyone getting raped and feel sorry for them but other then that she really envies the wives their cushy lives and spends a lot of time being bitter towards them.... and that was around the time I gave up because we'd have hit rock bottom then.  Looks like I was right. That's sad. Either George kept the good stuff for the Furiosa prequel he still wants to make, or he shared only the bare bones with the people writing this script and they filled in the gaps themselves in the most obvious and least interesting ways before they ever saw the movie.   I'm going to be charitable and call this non-canon. So I can stop thinking about it."
MadMax,3alv46,IdiotsLantern,3,Sun Jun 21 20:57:11 2015 UTC,Thanks for your comments. Having you articulate all this will help me lay my own inner monologue of small sighs to rest and stop thinking about it too.
MadMax,3alv46,adventurefine,7,Mon Jun 22 01:54:55 2015 UTC,"The lowest point (and the moment I decided this comic was non-canon, vague George Miller story credit or no)   Page 10 has a rape scene while Furiosa watches and makes an unhappy face.   Nope. No no no no no NO.  For one, No Way would the wives be this comfortable around Furiosa if she'd watched them get raped and done nothing. I get that they need her, but someone who didn't intervene once will possibly do so again, plus there'd be the small problem of every time they look at her it would be like, ""hey, remember that time you watched us all get raped and didn't do anything? Because I remember! Lets go to the green place and build a new community together!"" It's laughable.   Plus... Remember this?   Max didn't need to see the pain and humiliation of the wives for himself to get that it was terrible. Why does Furiosa have to? She witnesses them get raped several times, hell she holds the wives back while Joe rapes the Dag for stopping him from taking Cheedo's virginity, and all I can think is this is WAY too much. None of this is needed. Furiosa of all people should understand what Breeders are for. She doesn't have to be there and watch it happen to know it's bad. That the writers of this comic felt it was necessary is not a good thing, it's a very bad thing. It undermines the themes of freedom that the movie is all about.   This part sums it up pretty well (yes, the article makes some very valid points and this is one of them):    The time spent “justifying” wanting to escape into the apocalyptic wastes paradoxically undermines itself. I, a survivor of rape and abuse, never found it odd that the wives would rather risk starvation in the desert than continue on in that situation, but the awareness that I am now apparently supposed to think it was odd just reminds me that “I don’t want to be abused” is considered a selfish luxury in our society, rather than a human right worth dying for.   This and the fact that the comic is suspicious of female cooperation and HAS to show the women being catty and jealous with each-other before they've been abused enough to justify wanting to work together.    This isn’t the tale of Capable and Knowing (haha, see what I did there?) women making plans together and executing an amazing prison break; this is the tale of Furiosa stomping up the stairs and saying “come with me if you want to live.”   So I guess George's idea that a ""man stealing five women from another man was a different movie,"" was right. Except in this case, Furiosa is just a man ""without balls"" as Capable said. Instead of the intelligent, compassionate, tough-as-nails woman we actually met in the movie, she's the terminator with an extra X chromosome.   I know this comic had to be written long before the film was finished, since they needed time to finish the art to release it alongside the film. But damn. This is pretty bad. I'm actually kind of hoping ""Mad Max: Furiosa"" gets made now, just to wash this all away."
MadMax,3alv46,IdiotsLantern,7,Sun Jun 21 21:53:10 2015 UTC,"I went to see Fury Road with a group of friends, one of whom is a bit of a Mary Sue type feminist.  Every time the Wives were on scream she tutted. Coming out of the film, she explained how the whole film experience was ruined by the scantly dressed, impossibly gorgeous wives, who she felt were only their to appease the young male demographic.  I tried arguing that the fact that they were stupidly beautiful, clean, and lewdly dressed was integral to plot and character; they were Joe's breeders.  They were fertility and vitality incarnate, one of the last truly living full-lifes in the barren wasteland.  Miller captured their naivety and innocence perfectly.  The incongruity of them against the wasteland's desert was absurd - and that was exactly what Miller wished to show.  When Max first comes across the wives, the camera slowly comes into focus from previously being out of focus.   Almost like a mirage.    I tried to explain to my friend that anyone with two brain cells to rub together can see that the film is many things, but anti-feminist is one it cannot be. Who killed the world? Man did - men did - Joe did.  Warlords and the mad rule the wasteland - the Wives are the embodiment of the pure, fertile hope for the world.   That's what stuck out for me.     Tl;dr people need to stop looking only at the surface of a story, a film, a piece of art, and drawing conclusions from that.  Every single one of the criticism in this article can easily be explained in a wholly non-misogynistic, pro-feminist interpretation.  But the Mary Sue's of this world aren't the brightest of individuals."
MadMax,3alv46,DamaskDream,18,Sun Jun 21 17:12:58 2015 UTC,"The Mary Sue has been pretty unequivocally in favour of Fury Road.  They have literally raved about it.  But this isn't about the movie, it's about the comic.  Had Fury Road not been such a positively feminist-friendly movie the contents of the comic wouldn't have been a shock, but whats there doesn't match up to the film.  It does sound like your friend is an idiot."
MadMax,3alv46,Turbofurball,12,Sun Jun 21 17:47:14 2015 UTC,"One thing I really, really appreciated about the movie was that there's not a single cleavage shot in it. Despite the gorgeous, scantily clad women on screen, the only body part it zooms in on is Angharad's belly, the first time we see her. The focus stays on the women's faces and hands, same as it does for the guys. A lot of it has to do with Miller's insistence that every. single. shot. be center frame (where the main point of interest is directly in the center instead of at 3rds or the golden ratio), I suspect a lot of it has to do with the editing too.   This blog post gives a lot of examples and comparisons to Age of Ultron, which keeps shoving Natasha's head up against the top of the frame. I had no idea how toxic this shit was until I saw a movie that didn't include it."

No one group has a monopoly on stupidity. I've seen people who use ""feminist"" as an insult defend liking Fury Road with this same exact logic. One guy actually said, ""You know, they could have replaced any of these women with the exception of the pregnant one with men and I'd have felt exactly the same,"" as a way of shrugging off the idea that it's a feminist film. Never mind that changing Furiosa or any one of the wives to a man would significantly change the story. Argle.   So I won't say your friend is an idiot, I don't know her, but I will say she does herself a disservice by not looking deeper. The Wives are intentionally objectified when they are introduced because that's the whole point of their story: they are seen as things, pretty objects, and they are rebelling against that and fighting to be seen as people, skimpy outfits and pretty faces be damned, they are human beings. From the start they are actively participating in their own escape. This is a good thing."
MadMax,3alv46,IdiotsLantern,2,Sun Jun 21 21:12:51 2015 UTC,"Reading this interview with the comic writers ...    It's a fascinating insight into how this tough, scarred and brutalized woman comes into contact with the Wives and somehow becomes sympathetic to their cause.    ....It's ""facinating"" how SOMEHOW she becomes sympathetic to the plight of women being brutalized in front of her. This is a fascinating story. How will she make this all important leap?? We must make sure she witnesses a whole lot of rape, otherwise no one will buy that someone so tough might actually care about all this rape happening, especially to these spoiled rotten girls who get to take baths whenever they want. We're not sure how much rape it really takes to make them want to leave such a sweet deal, so lets just make sure it's a whole lot of rape, and anal rape. And we'll throw some stuff about Cheedo's ""unpoisoned"" virginity in there too, and how we've got to leave before rapes her, and how the lives of rape babies are sacred, and rape rape rape rape rape rape rape rape.....   ... ahem.  Yah. ""Fascinating.""  No wonder the comic was bad."
MadMax,3alv46,presidentparrot,3,Tue Jun 23 00:21:33 2015 UTC,"Basically agree with this, and I think it says about Miller that he's a guy that doesn't get how to write female characters himself, but has good intentions as evidenced by his hiring that feminist writer to tweak the Fury Road script."
MadMax,3alv46,Turbofurball,11,Sun Jun 21 17:13:36 2015 UTC,"He's previously written good and interesting women, I suspect this may be a case of him giving a story outline over to someone who is an idiot."

That said, this comic sounds horrible. Dunno why they complained about the fact that she'd been a wife before when clearly, any attractive healthy fertile woman was fair game for Joe; I mean it was almost certainly why she was captured and raised to adulthood. That's not sexist, that's just accurately depicting a rapist warlord obsessed with breeding."

A huge reason why I liked Fury Road was because there was emphasis placed on female independence without it being so ""OH, LOOK AT US. TEEHEE GIRL POWER! WE'RE ALL SO WELL ROUNDED AND CULTURALLY APPROPRIATED. LOOK AT FURIOUSA. SHE'S SOOOO MUCH BETTER THAN MAX."" Fury Road independently created what was necessary for each character (most of which was superficial and that's okay) and that was all that was necessary. It's a fuckin' action movie. There doesn't need to be depth!  Fuck you, Mary Sue and your uncreative, copy-pasted bullshit. Furiosa is awesome."

They didn't say Furiosa isn't awesome, only that it does the characters injustice (plus old boring tropes about sexual violence). I personally didn't know anything about the comic but was looking forward to getting it (because Furiosa is awesome and was curious for some background story - but this doesn't seem to be about her at all?), but idgaf which website this review is on, if only some of these things are true, I have no interest in reading it.

Things like the kids parents divorcing, the teen who can't stop oogling every girl he sees, St. Maj. Dinobait once raising a wolf pup, and whatever the British assistant was doing on her phone when she should have been watching the kids is brought up and then just forgotten about.   ...If it's not going anywhere, don't waste screentime on it, geniuses. In Fury Road, there's a blink-and-you-miss-it moment where Toast grabs Max's arm to try and keep him from going for the gun. This foreshadows later when she grabs Joe's arm to keep him from shooting Furiosa. Like Max, Joe shakes her off almost immediately. Unlike Max, Joe then backhands her across the face so hard she spits blood. These wasted seconds are enough for Furiosa to get the upper hand. Everything that happens is important."

She does this, then immediately ducks while Furiosa does her thing. She doesn't contribute directly to the rest of the fight.   Meanwhile, Toast is in the cab with Joe. Joe actually puts a gun to her head to stop her from moving. Furiosa dangles alongside the car up to the window, and Joe turns his gun on her, but Toast grabs his arm, he punches her, and Furiosa snags his face-mask with her harpoon. ""Remember me?"" Boom, lights out for Joe. Toast has to grab the wheel to stop the car from spinning out of control. She spits on Joe's corpse.   After Furiosa's been stabbed, Cheedo also is the one who grabs the guy (after the Keeper stabs him in the eye) and kicks him out of the cab. If we assume he went under the wheels, then Cheedo is the one wife who actually directly killed someone in this movie."

MadMax,3akwlm,HarlequinWasTaken,6,Sun Jun 21 05:16:58 2015 UTC,Literally the only thing similar to a tank was the treads.
MadMax,3akwlm,AtomicKaiser,2,Sun Jun 21 06:32:33 2015 UTC,"Nope, it's a Ripsaw light tank with the skin of a Valiant Charger. They've been in production since 2009."
MadMax,3akwlm,gtr427,1 point,Sun Jun 21 21:44:00 2015 UTC,Which is in no way a mass export battle tank design. Its a Howe/Howe toy. Thats why I mentioned light AFVs etc.
MadMax,3akwlm,AtomicKaiser,1 point,Sun Jun 21 23:16:56 2015 UTC,"I think you're getting overly specific, unless you mean that it just doesn't have enough armor. It probably wouldn't be used to fill the role of a tank in the wasteland but I think most people would still call it a tank."
MadMax,3akwlm,gtr427,2,Mon Jun 22 01:31:52 2015 UTC,"Not to be pedantic, but would you call this a tank? http://twentywheels.com/imgs/a/a/t/f/a/caterpillar_318cln_cab__heat__air__crawler_excavator_backhoe_diesel_cat_machine_ac_4_lgw.jpg"
MadMax,3akwlm,AtomicKaiser,1 point,Mon Jun 22 01:33:14 2015 UTC,"If I was being shot at, I would much rather be in there than in a car. It's closer to a tank than pretty much anything not built specifically for combat, even if strictly speaking it isn't a tank.  Edit: It all depends on context, but I don't think either thing really fits what OP was looking for so it doesn't matter."
MadMax,3akwlm,gtr427,0,Mon Jun 22 02:06:09 2015 UTC,"It probably does indicate that he at least had a tank, though. He probably had the tracks removed for the reasons noted above, and then attached to his personal vehicle to give it better all-terrain handling."
MadMax,3akwlm,pickelsurprise,2,Sun Jun 21 17:49:40 2015 UTC,"Not to get too geeky, but those treads were not from any battle-tank in the last 70 years. Maybe a light AFV or a Japanese tank from the 1930's"

MadMax,3ajm76,IdiotsLantern,21,Sat Jun 20 21:00:08 2015 UTC,"George says all of his movies are the ""legends"" of Max the road warrior, told after the fact. (After society is back, I imagine.)   I think Max is kind of like the Wasteland's ""Robin Hood,"" where there are a lot of stories about him, but no one knows how much is true and how much is exaggerated and if there even was a real guy. And I don't think any of the stories spread during his lifetime. If ""Mad Max"" became a Wasteland folk hero, Max himself never got the benefit of it."
MadMax,3ajm76,nemothorx,4,Sun Jun 21 00:43:46 2015 UTC,"Do you have a cite for George actually saying this? I've heard it repeated a lot amongst the fandom, but not seen a solid cite for it."
MadMax,3ajm76,IdiotsLantern,7,Sun Jun 21 05:08:04 2015 UTC,"He hasn't said it in as many words, but when you corner him and flat out ask about Max's continuity, he first avoids the topic and then gets mythological.  ""If you put a gun to my head, I’d say after Thunderdome, but it’s very loose. I can’t even work out the chronology of the first, second and third, let alone the fourth thirty years later.""   Then -   ""They’re kind of like standalones exploring the whole world – like Westerns. The loner, you know? I think it predates cinema, actually. There was always the wanderer, who wandered the wasteland looking for some kind of meaning or purpose. From samurais to Vikings, and especially Westerns.""   Here  Max is a mythological figure, and that air of mystery around him is part of that allure. One thing I liked about Fury Road is that even though Max gives us some voice over and we have glimpses inside of his head, everything we see raises more questions then answers. Max himself can't really tell you where he came from or where he thinks he's going when he takes off back into the Wasteland. A guy like that would inspire people who met him, even in passing, to construct their own tales of what he's done and what they think has happened to him."

I'd seen that first quote you used - the gun-to-his-head answer, so extrapolating his view from that seemed... plausible, but not quite with enough backing. I'd not seen (or remembered perhaps) that second quote - about standalones and like westerns.   Thank you again for the link. You're right - he doesn't say it in as many words, but it seems to be the point he's circling around :)"

MadMax,3an2nh,Ballongo,17,Sun Jun 21 21:02:33 2015 UTC,Max dying in the interceptor crash at the start would have made a pretty crap movie. Plus one of those characters does die. Splendid would also like a word.
MadMax,3an2nh,mutantratking,10,Sun Jun 21 21:26:31 2015 UTC,I totally agree with you in terms of the Hobbit and there being no sense of danger to the action but I don't experience that watching fury road. Characters do die and Furiosa nearly dies so I never felt that disconnect I did while watching battle of the 5 armies. Even when the two lead dwarves got killed I was too bored to even care at that point. But Fury Road kept me gripped and Max and Nux surviving the storm never made me think that the movie was pointless because these guys are being protected by the writers.   It's a pity you got that feeling while watching it because I know how tedious an action film can be once the element of danger has been completely removed. It's why although I actually like Dead Man's Chest and Desolation of Smaug the thirds acts lost the sense of danger aswell as the spirit of fun and adventure.
MadMax,3an2nh,teaqualizer,5,Sun Jun 21 21:53:35 2015 UTC,"Interesting point, but I was under the assumption that what Miller was going for with the action in FR was to make it extremely well done eye candy. It does boil down to a matter of taste, I went into FR expecting beautiful and fun action scenes, nothing in the realm of realism."
MadMax,3an2nh,protofail,3,Sun Jun 21 21:29:06 2015 UTC,"Any normal human would die or break something important every 5 minutes in this movie.   What you describe is a long established trope:  http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoOneCouldSurviveThat  In the Mel Gibson Max movies at least, one of the arguments that they are part of a continuum is that his injuries DO accumulate from movie to movie, and never completely heal. This is noted as the 'Dented Iron' trope on the TVtropes page for Max  http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Characters/MadMax  Fury Road has less continuity in this regard (he has the leg brace, but no limp. He doesn't have the eye injury from MM2 that is visible through Thunderdome), but still is willing to injure - and kill - major characters.   Part of this all is just suspension of disbelief, and any behind the scenes doco of any stunt, in any movie, will quickly demonstrate that what you see on screen is a fantasy. Not even Jackie Chan, master of doing it for real stunts, couldn't do all the stunts, in order, without error, that his characters perform.  Don't get me wrong, I completely agree with the annoyance at invincible protagonists, I just didn't get that vibe from Fury Road :)"
MadMax,3an2nh,nemothorx,2,Mon Jun 22 01:51:57 2015 UTC,"I saw it three times and it's PLAINLY impossible for Nux and Max to survive the War Rig crashing into them during the sandstorm.  However, it doesn't matter.  It's that kind of movie."
MadMax,3an2nh,skonen_blades,1 point,Mon Jun 22 15:23:23 2015 UTC,Yeah. That is the problem. Max is invincible so the action scenes lack danger. Sure cool to watch but in Road Warrior the action scenes were also suspenseful.
MadMax,3an2nh,skonen_blades,2,Mon Jun 22 23:32:04 2015 UTC,I can dig that it took you out of the movie.  I think Road Warrior is a shade more grounded in realism whereas Fury Road is like a Heavy Metal comic book story come to life.  It didn't phase me but I can see it causing problems for some folks.
MadMax,3al2an,sombray,6,Sun Jun 21 06:26:37 2015 UTC,"Thoughts:    He complains about the ""Fake CGI fire"" coming out of Doof's Guitar. That's real. If there was CGI in that shot, it was the background, not the fire, and even that is probably just altered to get more cars in the frame.  This guy LOVES HIM SOME Mad Max 2. That's fine, we all have our favorites, but personally, you won't convince me that the final chase scene in Road Warrior was better then the one in Fury Road.  I'm not sure I agree with this guy's interpretation of Mad Max 2 either. Max was never considering leading the clan, he agreed to help them as a way of screwing over the people who wreaked his car and killed his dog. The Warrior Woman didn't ""take a liking"" to him, she apologized for thinking that they should kill him and that he'd take off with their gas. She'd been wrong about him and she was sorry. That's it. Sure she says it kindly, but she didn't ask him out or anything.  Why does he keep calling Mad Max 2 ""gritty and realistic?"" Mad Max 2 had archers who could barely hold up their bows properly, fiberglass arrows that are somehow less hard to come across then bullets, snakes you can train, ass-less chaps and leather harnesses as battle wear, death by silver boomerang, a gyrocopter that still functions and somehow is less good to have then a car despite the fact IT CAN FLY...sure it didn't have anything as rediculous as a flame throwing bedpan guitar, but you don't deck out your villain in a spiked codpiece if you are going for pure gritty realism.  You REALLY won't convince me the Wives were just there to look hot onscreen. In a way, I think the intentionally cheese-cake way the Wives are introduced is a deliberate lampshade about the fact they are no less determined to survive then Max is and they will very soon be trying to help Furiosa kill him. When you think about it, turning former sex slaves into sex objects posing for the camera to oogle would be a pretty damn icky thing to do.  His problem with Max's characterizations seem to steam from the idea that if this Max is any different at all from the previous Max, then it's getting something wrong. Mel Gibson didn't see inconvenient visions or hear angry voices, so that Tom Hardy does must be some kind of mistake. It doesn't leave open the possibility of Max having gone through more things between movies that'd break his psyche down even more. It also doesn't leave open the ""soft reboot"" possibility where this is a different version of Max's story, and Max's history is now different then what we've seen before. It's the first film narrated by Max himself, and he isn't the most reliable narrator. Really, ""hunted by scavangers."" Scavengers don't hunt, they eat things already dead, that's why they are scavengers. Max, I'm a little worried about your sanity.  He claims this movie ""Fails as a sequel because it fails to do anything interesting with Max himself,"" completely ignoring the scene in the cab where Max gives himself to Furiosa in a very literal sense. I have a hard time imagining Mel Gibson's Max cradling a dying woman (who he has no romantic feelings for) in his arms, using his voice to keep her awake, apologizing for her pain, giving her of his own body to save her. If that's not an ""interesting"" thing to see Max doing, I don't know what would qualify.  This guy seems way too fixated on his detailed portrait of ""Evil Max"" and how great he thinks a movie depicting Max as a masochistic and guilt-riddled barbarian leader who turns on his own gang would be. For one, I too think it would be interesting to watch Max inch his way back towards humanity. But I don't think more contact with other people would make him into a monster. A group of savages would never get him to join them anyway, no matter how desperately lonely he gets.   The intercepter is wreaked in Mad Max 2. The Interceptor is always getting wreaked. It always comes back. I'm convinced one reason Max melts into the crowd at the end of Fury Road is he knows he has to get to the wreckage of his Interceptor before the scavengers do. There will be PLENTY of spare parts around he can use to fix it."

Most people agree, including most critics, Max 2 is still the best and has the best end chase scene. It's certainly more convincing and more brutal.  Re: the Warrior Woman and Max. This is an example of how MM2 is, in places, much more subtle than MM4. The woman touches Max on the arm and looks at him affectionately as he walks away. she's also the best looking woman in the camp and the script states that when she is killed Max responds with anger.  Citing the costumes of MM2 as unrealistic is both silly and misses the thematic point. In MM2 the bad guys are deliberately given an animalistic (fur tails and hats etc) look and their sexual depravity is shown in their bondage look. While the good guys are dressed in white rags like farmer peasants. Those are thematic, but they're not unrealistic either. Ever looked at how real biker gangs, punks and heavy metallers dress? The gritty and realistic comparison concerns the plausibility of the action scenes and the society depicted. MM4 is like a cartoonish future, still very good entertainment value, but MM2 is more believable. The boomerang thing is part of the Feral Kid sub-plot with the kid himself representing the future of humanity. Eventually the kid is fought over by Max and Wez in the finale.  The video doesn't say the wives are deliberate sex objects. That way of looking at the film is raised in response to those who complain that the film is feminist propaganda. eye of the beholder stuff.  Re: the sequel / reboot debate. The film was not clearly marketed as a reboot or sequel. MM2 was very clearly a sequel and used footage from the first film in its intro for new audiences and thus satisfied new fans and fans of the original. MM3 didn't severely clash with the previous two films so works as a sequel too. So previous installments had established a pattern of sequel and continuing story. The new film broke that without warning and thus was a jarring mismatch in many places. Like you say great standalone movie. The ""Mad Max"" title is basically used as a marketing strategy. ""Soft reboot"" ... What's soft about it? What would a hard reboot be like? And how is a reboot different to a remake?  Max cradling Furiosa hardly qualifies as an interesting progression of the chracter. It was pretty lame and unimaginative. And Max did make some personal sacrifices for others in the previous films, such as for the Feral Kid. They were just more subtle so you must have missed them.  Re: Evil Max suggestions. It was already suggested multiple times in the previous films that Max was on his way to becoming a savage himself. At times he acts like one in the second movie, showing a disregard and indifference to the plight of others - that conflict in Max was what made his journey so interesting in the second movie. He was in denial of his own humanity.  The Interceptor is not ""always getting wrecked"". The one in MM2 was the same one from the first movie. It was destroyed and was not in MM3. It has only been resurrected once ... in MM4. The idea he's going to find and fix the interceptor again is nonsense and smacks of making excuses to paper over the flaws in the new movie.  Fury road is a good movie, but it's flawed and not the best of the series. It is getting a lot of praise in part because today's action audiences have come to expect so little because the competition releases are so poor."
MadMax,3al2an,vemo15,5,Sun Jun 21 15:26:11 2015 UTC,"If the guitar fire is real then they've done a good job of making it look fake with unnecessary colour filters.   It's real. Here's a photo from Ben Smith (actor who played the Doof) personal instagram page. No filters. If they used CGI to enhance the fire, it doesn't change the fact that there was fire there.    Most people agree, including most critics, Max 2 is still the best and has the best end chase scene. It's certainly more convincing and more brutal.   I'm not going to get into a debate about what ""most critics,"" say. I said you won't be convincing ME. But then Fury Road was my introduction to the Mad Max series and I didn't watch the original films until after I'd seen it, so take my opinion for the admittedly little it's worth.   The woman touches Max on the arm and looks at him affectionately as he walks away.    Affectionately? She's apologizing. She's been saying they should kill him practically since she laid eyes on him, and she realizes it was wrong of her and she feels bad about it. Speaking kindly to him now is the least she can do to make amends. And either way, going from ""I was wrong to want you dead and I'm sorry,"" to ""I fancy you,"" is something of a big leap.    she's also the best looking woman in the camp and the script states that when she is killed Max responds with anger.   Is it at all possible he doesn't like watching women die, because it brings back bad memories? Either way Max's reaction is far from proof that he was revved up (so to speak) for a relationship with this woman. That she's ""the best looking woman in the camp"" doesn't mean she HAS to be a love interest by default, especially if the entirety of their interactions with the exception of one apology is some variety of ""we should kill him, don't trust him,"" vs. ""I'm only here for the gas.""    Citing the costumes of MM2 as unrealistic is both silly and misses the thematic point. In MM2 the bad guys are deliberately given an animalistic (fur tails and hats etc) look and their sexual depravity is shown in their bondage look. While the good guys are dressed in white rags like farmer peasants. Those are thematic, but they're not unrealistic either. Ever looked at how real biker gangs, punks and heavy metallers dress? The gritty and realistic comparison concerns the plausibility of the action scenes and the society depicted.    I'm not saying they weren't thematically fitting, but they aren't ""gritty and realistic."" No one, facing the apocalypse, immediately hits up their local fetish shop for exactly the right leather open-chested bondage vest to terrorize some villagers in. You don't want to spend days on a motorcycle with your ass hanging out. You don't see too many spiked codpieces and feathered shoulder pads on real-life bikers. Those are generally reserved for clubbing, not weeks of exposure to the wind and elements. Again, not saying it didn't fit with the vibe of the film, but it was impact, not realism, that George Miller was going for there.    MM4 is like a cartoonish future, still very good entertainment value, but MM2 is more believable.    Have you ever trained a snake to act as a home security system? Because I haven't. Believability is not really the goal.    The boomerang thing is part of the Feral Kid sub-plot with the kid himself representing the future of humanity. Eventually the kid is fought over by Max and Wez in the finale.   It's still a silver boomerang thrown by a small child that killed someone. Again, fits the story thematically, but realism is not the point.    The video doesn't say the wives are deliberate sex objects. That way of looking at the film is raised in response to those who complain that the film is feminist propaganda. eye of the beholder stuff.   I don't follow your reasoning. You do know the people who are complaining about the ""feminist propaganda"" are basically of the opinion that merely having women in your movie and having them do things means those are things men can't be doing and why aren't men doing those things, do you hate men or something? In short, those people are idiots.   In a way, George Miller did something subversive when he decided that instead of one wife being rescued by our hero, it would be a whole group of wives being rescued by one of their own gender. He said that the image that kick-started Fury Road was the idea of this tanker taking off with this human female cargo, but their rescuer couldn't be Max because a man stealing five women from another man is a different movie, which inspired him to create Furiosa, a female Road Warrior who could fight side by side with Max. And Furiosa fascinated him. Of course once he thought of her, he had to come up with her backstory, and the whole movie kind of grew out of that. Max's part didn't come to George until later, when he figured out the ""runaway animal"" aspect.    Re: the sequel / reboot debate. The film was not clearly marketed as a reboot or sequel.    Probably so that the audience can decide for themselves. This is an updated version of Max, and intended to be a new entry point into the series, and whenever you corner George and ask him point blank about continuity, he always gets really evasive and starts talking about story archetypes and legends. Basically he comes up with the films one at a time, and continuity between the films is not his highest priority.    MM2 was very clearly a sequel and used footage from the first film in its intro for new audiences and thus satisfied new fans and fans of the original. MM3 didn't severely clash with the previous two films so works as a sequel too. So previous installments had established a pattern of sequel and continuing story.    Yes and no. If I asked you to define what the apocalypse that destroyed the world between Mad Max 1 and 2 vs. what they say ended the world in 3, I'm not sure I'd get a cohesive answer. Things like where did the gas pumping settlers come from and where did they go do, what happened to the Bronze, did Goose and Max's brain-dead wife ever actually die... all of these are just never going to be answered.   The new film broke that without warning and thus was a jarring mismatch in many places. Like you say great standalone movie. The ""Mad Max"" title is basically used as a marketing strategy.    I don't think that's giving George Miller himself enough credit for what Mad Max is and what he does with it. For him, ""Mad Max"" is a mythology, a framework that he can use to tell the story he wants to tell. Whenever Tom Hardy was asked if he was intimidated taking over the role that made Mel Gibson a star, he says two things: he says to him, Mel Gibson IS Mad Max and nothing will ever change that. And he says if George Miller is still at the helm and he says this is what he wants, then Tom's not going to doubt him.   He can say this because he clearly DID doubt him, on the set. George had a very free-wheeling, unconventional shooting style where instead of having things like call sheets and shot lists, the whole armada would just roll out at four in the morning, shoot until nightfall, then they'd drive an hour and a half back to the tiny town they were staying at, and then the next morning they'd do it all over again. Tom is a very method actor and his way of playing Max was to kind of stay in character, mumbling and keeping to himself a lot. This lead to a lot of frustration on set, as you can imagine. Tom complained that George couldn't properly articulate what he wanted, which was murder on a perfectionist like Tom.  Once Tom finally saw the finished movie at Cannes, he turned to George and publicly apologized for doubting him. He says he didn't understand it at the time, but he can't argue with the finished product, and then made a bunch of noises that roughly translates to, ""forgive me, I will never doubt you again."" This was somewhere around the time we found out he signed a contract to make three more of these films.    ""Soft reboot"" ... What's soft about it? What would a hard reboot be like? And how is a reboot different to a remake?   A soft reboot is something like Jurassic World: ignores some series continuity but if you want to place it in the universe with the other films, you can. A remake (or a ""Hard Reboot"") is something like the new Ghostbusters movie (or ""The Amazing Spider Man""), where it's re-telling the origin of the world. Both reboots introduce new and new interpretations of characters, but one of them is a hard reset on the whole world and the other is a bit murkier. Add to that that this particular series is about leaving a lot unsaid, and you've got a lot of room for interpretation.    Max cradling Furiosa hardly qualifies as an interesting progression of the chracter. It was pretty lame and unimaginative.   For serious? When was the last time you saw a male action hero lead doing something so gentle for someone who was not his wife or kid? Men, especially tough, brawny men, in movies just don't get to be that emotional.    And Max did make some personal sacrifices for others in the previous films, such as for the Feral Kid. They were just more subtle so you must have missed them.   I have a hard time imagining something more selfless then a transfusion out of your own body (after you've just had it forcibly stolen from you earlier) to save someone you just met. You're right, if he did something MORE self-sacrificing in any of the other movies, it was so ""subtle"" that I missed it."
MadMax,3al2an,IdiotsLantern,2,Sun Jun 21 20:37:30 2015 UTC,thank you for such a good response. Saved me the bother! :)
MadMax,3al2an,nemothorx,1 point,Mon Jun 22 08:36:48 2015 UTC,"Lol, boy are you making excuses to paper over the flaws.  The very fact that Miller has had to publicly claim the flames are real proves that they don't look real. Either way that's a fail. And are you seriously saying that all the fake backgrounds don't stand out to you? The lighting, coloration and focus are general giveaways and, like with most movies that have a lot of CGI, make the movie look fake. The early Max films were shot pretty much all in camera. No CGI, no bluescreens that I can recall. Result - it looks natural and doesn't jar the viewer while watching. And the very fact that the marketing of Fury Road has made a big thing of the stunts that were shot for real (while playing down the CGI) proves that the film makers know the audience want less CGI. But there are even CGI cars added into shots in the film.  It's funny how you select out Rotten Tomatoes to try and argue FR is the better movie. Yes BOTH movies have 98% on there and the number of reviews of FR is simply because it's a new move, but surely you're aware that RT generally spews out bias toward new movies. Revenge of the Sith has 80% on there compared to Return of the Jedi having 79% for example. And often it's because the people jumping on to review movies on RT are the people who liked the films. Hence crap like Dark Knight gets as high a rating as the first Star Wars movie.  If you judge audience reaction by the younger viewers, who generally are used to CGI in most new action movies and more likely to post online reviews then FR gives RW a run for its money, but every single person I know who has seen both movies has said they like FR but prefer RW. Some I know have flat out slated FR as an empty-headed cash in. And to an extent I agree with them. The film breaks very little new ground and the fact that's Miller doesn't mean it's good. He directed MM3 which hardly anyone likes. Same goes for Lucas and the Star Wars prequels. Millions have complained about the CGI, poor scripts, etc - same director.  Feminism is the only thing FR brings new to the series, but there's nothing daring about that. Jim Cameron pulled that off with even more zest in Aliens and that movies is near 30 yrs old. Throwing feminism into a movie these days is easy formula - you know there's always going to be a critical sector who cheer no matter how ham-fisted it's done. And even most of the good visual stuff in the film was already done before in previous Max films and is just rehashed with a higher budget this time around.  Seriously, you sound like a publicist for the film. Saying that the marketing as to whether the film is a reboot or sequel was left vague so that the audience could decide for themselves sound like something a studio PR dept would come up with to disguise the flaws. Haha.  FR is a great movie by modern low standards and no that isn't harsh. A lot of critics have been saying the film is the kick in the teeth Hollywood needs to start making good action movies again. but I suppose you're gonna look for a semantic way to disagree with that too."
MadMax,3al2an,vemo15,1 point,Thu Jun 25 07:04:54 2015 UTC,"Days after the fact but hey, at least it's something to talk about that isn't that godawful comic...    The very fact that Miller has had to publicly claim the flames are real proves that they don't look real. Either way that's a fail.    ... How do you possibly get real fire to look more real then real? And Miller didn't claim anything. Did you see the live stunt video I posted? Practical stunts and effects were a big part of the marketing of this movie.    And are you seriously saying that all the fake backgrounds don't stand out to you?    No, they did, but really I think that was using CGI right: it wasn't there to replace the real desert, or the real stunt or the real car or the real fire, it's there to make what is actually there look better. Which is really what it's best for.    film makers know the audience want less CGI.   Which is why Jurassic World made 1 billion dollars it's first week, while Fury Road is struggling to out-perform ""San Andreas?"" This is why we can't have nice things...    But there are even CGI cars added into shots in the film.   None of the cars were CGI. The production designer will be the first to tell you they made 88 vehicles for the movie and they were all practical. What they'd do is composite shots of a real car onto a shot with another car to put them in the same shot, so they can get shots like the one where the mobile refinery explodes while Max is up on the pole. Obviously blowing that up in the middle of all of those cars wouldn't have been safe, so they got the shot with Tom Hardy on the pole, then the shot of the moving vehicles, then the shot of the tanker exploding. All three happened separately, but they all happened on location and live, and were blended together in post.   And don't fool yourself: George Miller would have totally used CGI on the first Mad Max films if it'd existed. Being able to paint out things like the safety harnesses for the performers, and composite shots all meant that it was hard to think of something he wanted that couldn't be performed safely. There were no serious injuries the entire shoot. And things like Charlize Theron's arm and the sandstorm would have just plain not been possible without digital technology.    every single person I know   That's nice for you, but it doesn't prove anything by itself.    Seriously, you sound like a publicist for the film. Saying that the marketing as to whether the film is a reboot or sequel was left vague so that the audience could decide for themselves sound like something a studio PR dept would come up with to disguise the flaws. Haha.   Hey, if they wanted to pay me, I'd be happy to take their money. Since they don't....   Look, if they wanted there to be no ambiguity at all, they would have done either a direct sequel where they pepper the movie with references to Humungeous or Barter Town to establish these things exist, or a hard reboot, where they re-tell a story from one of the previous films, probably the first one about how Max lost his family and went insane. As a soft reboot, it's intentionally ambiguous: are these the ghosts of his family he's seeing, or other people? Why does this girl call him ""Max"" but call out for ""Pa?"" Why does he say he used to be a cop when we're 50 years or so past the apocalypse, minimum, and he looks more like a private military/Blackwater type anyway?   Though really, you lost me with the ham-fisted stuff about feminism. Yes, James Cameron gave us one good female action star 30 years ago, and then again with T2, and since then.... What have we gotten? Can you point to another big budget, female fronted summer action movie that came out this year? We can't even give Black Widow her own film and she's the closest thing to a female superhero we have. It's sad but true that the mere act of putting women in your movie, especially like in Fury Road where there are a large number of female characters of different ages, abilities and personalities, all of whom contribute to the film in a unique way and not one of which is involved in a romance with our hero (the romantic subplot was left to two supporting characters) is enough to label a film ""feminist,""...  but such is the sad state of things in movies these days. I wish it wasn't."
MadMax,3al2an,IdiotsLantern,4,Fri Jul 3 21:25:29 2015 UTC,"Re: Evil Max suggestions. It was already suggested multiple times in the previous films that Max was on his way to becoming a savage himself. At times he acts like one in the second movie, showing a disregard and indifference to the plight of others - that conflict in Max was what made his journey so interesting in the second movie. He was in denial of his own humanity.   This is what's known as ""head-cannon."" This is your interpretation of things and where you see the story going. Everybody has one, and again, in a series like Mad Max where so much is left unsaid, there's a lot of room to fill in the gaps for yourself, and that's fine. Good head cannons are always supported by observations and stuff you see in the canon fiction. Problem is when people start acting like their head-cannons are REAL cannon, and that everything that doesn't gel with that is getting it WRONG.  I know you don't want my advice, but George Miller is unlikely to make your perfect ""Evil Max"" storyline for you. If you want it to exist, I hate to say it, but you probably have to write it or draw it or make it yourself. Anyone else would get it wrong. You have the internet. Anything's possible.  You'll probably have a lot of fun doing it too. You should do it!    The idea he's going to find and fix the interceptor again is nonsense and smacks of making excuses to paper over the flaws in the new movie.   This is a series with camel-powered trucks, snake-dropping gyros, mind-controlled prosthetic arms, and bungie cord battle domes. Fixing up a wreaked car would be one of the less unbelievable things in this world.   Let me put it this way; if Max has his Interceptor back in the next film without a word of explanation, I've got my excuses all ready to go. We can always assume Max somehow got Furiosa's people to toe it back to the Citadel and fix it up. She'd have done that for him. It's a movie.   I actually think the Interceptor was one of the less well-served characters in Fury Road. Poor Interceptor: it got wreaked, then got a really bad chrome paint job and a skull mounted on top to class up it's nitro intake. I hope it gets it's crowning moment of badass in the next movie. It's supposed to be one of the fastest ever made, driven by one of the best drivers in the Wasteland, and all it did in this movie is get wreaked, get turned evil, and then get wreaked again. Max at the wheel of the Interceptor is a man perfectly in his element, and it'd be great to see Tom Hardy portray that.    Fury road is a good movie, but it's flawed and not the best of the series. It is getting a lot of praise in part because today's action audiences have come to expect so little because the competition releases are so poor.   Harsh, man. Very harsh. Fury road isn't just being called ""the best in the series,"" it's being called a miracle and the fix to everything currently wrong with action movies. Hyperbolic, sure, but if it's mission was to introduce Max to a whole new generation, it succeeded. I've seen it six times in theaters and I'd see it again."
MadMax,3al2an,IdiotsLantern,2,Sun Jun 21 20:37:52 2015 UTC,"Reviews are opinions of course, so I'll give my opinion on his opinion. I think his review is flawed because he feels the need to look at the movie as a sequel of both the story and Max's development. This leads him to believe it to be worse than if it was a standalone film.   I don't agree that the opening was poor. It is certainly not the highlight of the movie though. He has an issue with the ""ghosts"" that haunt him, saying that a more subtle way would have been better but doesn't really give concrete examples on how it could have been done. Given the pacing of the movie, anything else would probably seem more odd.   It was sad to see him dislike the ending, which I thought was done well. He doesn't specify what he dislikes about the ending exactly, other than the action trying to one-up itself. I think the ending works well with quite a touching moment as Max and Furiosa part ways. It doesn't linger. The real tragedy of the final act is that the climax is muddled between Nux's sacrifice and Furiosa killing Joe. It leaves an odd feeling because both need to happen but neither quite hit a high note.   I agree that the night time coloring was off and seemed so obvious that it was a filter. But it is nitpicking. Also, at the end he suggests what he would like for future Mad Max films, including Max becoming a rapist in a bandit group just so he can show him regaining a place for humanity in his heart again. Weird suggestion, but he seemed to be miss how Fury Road did just that but in a more ""realistic"" way.   Final disclosure: I have yet to watch Mad Max 1-3"
MadMax,3al2an,guacamelon,-2,Sun Jun 21 10:34:00 2015 UTC,"Watch the first two Mad Max films and you'll see that the new one is largely a rehash of the second. It's decent, but virtually all of the critics are in agreement that second is still the best."
MadMax,3al2an,vemo15,4,Sun Jun 21 15:01:06 2015 UTC,"Are they? Just doing a quick check of rotten tomatoes, both have a 98%, but Road Warrior has 42 votes while Fury Road has 272 votes. While I have not read all the reviews, I don't think it's as cut and dry as you're making it as which is the best. I grew up on Mad Max and had TRW as one of my favorite movies, and I personally think Fury Road is superior, and i doubt I'm alone in that regard."

MadMax,3al2an,Gnarbage,1 point,Sun Jun 21 07:08:18 2015 UTC,"I think this Rob Ager character has watched some weird mirror universe series of movies about this guy that Rob keeps calling ""the Max character"".   From what he describes, it's a much poorer series of movies than the ""Mad Max"" ones we have.   Would not trade places."
MadMax,3aio91,TTTTTTTtttimmmmm,9,Sat Jun 20 15:46:56 2015 UTC,"My thoughts:  I'm really excited about this game, but, as with anything else, I have some aspects that make me excited and some that don't.  Things I'm excited for :   While it's a complaint, I like the voice actor for Max. I like the atmosphere of the grittiness and the feeling of being in a wasteland. I like that, just as the film, the game is going to have interesting characters, both as protagonist and antagonist. At one point in the trailer, it showed a Pharoah sort of guy.  I like the car building. It seems to not be about maxing out every aspect of the car, but decide if the player wants to go for speed or ramming ability. It feels like real customization. To add to this, finding engine parts and scraps seems like a fun system if done right.   Things I don't like:   The fighting seems too fluid. This usually wouldn't be a problem, but with the gritty feeling, I was hoping a bit more Last of Us and less Arkham trilogy. I'll save too much judgement until I see more gameplay. The fact it seems to tie-in too much to Fury Road. I'm excited to see the war boys again, but with the legend feeling of Max and seeing all four movies, I kind of wish Avalanche had used a bit more creative freedom. 8 am glad it's a different color palette, so it feels a bit separated from Fury Road.   I'm hoping for a good storyline and fantastic characters. I want this to be a great game, and I think it will be, but I know it won't be perfect and that's great. I just want this to feel like part of the Mad Max universe and not a cheap tie-in."
MadMax,3aio91,HoustonsSolution,3,Sat Jun 20 16:41:48 2015 UTC,"I'm mainly worried about Max as a character and what they will do with him. I saw a love interest in there and I didn't think it fit, which would heavily disjoint it from the Mad Max world."
MadMax,3aio91,HoustonsSolution,6,Sat Jun 20 18:02:14 2015 UTC,"I think it can be done well. The question is, how will they handle it. I'm cautiously optomistic since, to tell you the truth, I'm so hyped for this game."
MadMax,3aio91,Malvu5,0,Sat Jun 20 18:13:14 2015 UTC,"To be fair I feel like it should take more cues from Fury Road for example. Like, in the way the characters are designed, the weapons, vehicles and just the general feel of Fury Road was a lot better, at least imo. Plus, Tom Hardy's voice and appearance seems to fit Max better than this grizzly and beardy look he has in the game plus his voice feels a bit off. Also, no Furiosa and War Rig, plus, the game feels a bit too washed out as opposed to what Fury Road did and had very vibrant colors. What I basically wanted was Fury Road: The  Game. That's just my opinion though... I just feel like they could have done more with it."
MadMax,3aio91,HoustonsSolution,5,Sat Jun 20 20:39:30 2015 UTC,"Cues are fine, but Mad Max isn't Fury Road. Mad Max is a set of stories and Fury Road is one of them. The game should have its own feel while making references to its other parts of its universe."
MadMax,3aio91,Malvu5,3,Sat Jun 20 20:55:54 2015 UTC,"I know they said that the storyline takes place a while before Fury Road and that's why they have the War Boys back and everything in this game. Besides, the feel of the game is closest to Fury Road than any of the older movies. So I feel they could have taken more from Fury Road and dropped into the game but that's just me personally. It still looks really good and hope it works out."
MadMax,3aio91,rob-e_tha_robot,2,Sun Jun 21 05:19:01 2015 UTC,"The voice is kinda weird, I wasn't even sure he was Australian until this last trailer came out. I think the grizzled beard look is customizable, in some shots his beard looks less bushy."

MadMax,3aio91,IdiotsLantern,2,Sun Jun 21 00:51:11 2015 UTC,"In a world that already has ""Boarderlands"" and ""Fallout,"" having a post-apocalyptic action game that doesn't feel redundant is going to be tough. The best case scenario looks like a kind of Red Dead Redemption with cars instead of horses.   Thing is, I'm not sure what specifically makes this a ""Mad Max"" game, apart from the name."
MadMax,3aio91,IdiotsLantern,1 point,Sat Jun 20 18:50:56 2015 UTC,"I actually wouldn't mind having a Mad Max game similar to those. I think best case single player would be a bare-bones RPG, with an amazing open world. It'd have a super intense, exciting, and well written main story with loads of side areas and other stories to get involved in. There should be a survival element, so the player has to go on supply raids or quests. It has to have awesome, grotesque, and barbaric tribes living in the area that can be dealt with. The car customization seems cool enough, and that definitely needs  to be a part of it. Lastly, and possibly the most difficult to implement/accept (in my mind), is the stability of Max as a character. The player can make some decisions in the game, but Max's stats stay constant. He will never be a good talker. He will never be amazingly strong. The player has to become Mad Max from the movies that we love. Some decisions can be left to the player, such as how to attack, how to survive, but others must hold Max true to the personality that has developed on screen. Sorry for the block of text, but I feel like this game isn't going to portray Max in a proper way."
MadMax,3aio91,HoustonsSolution,2,Sat Jun 20 19:17:48 2015 UTC,"Max's characterization is another big concern for me. Looking at the box art for this game, ""Max"" looks like, if you will pardon the expression, ""just another gun-bro in a media full of gun-bros."" His choice of one-sleeved jacket seems to be all that tells you this is Max and not Generic Video Game Protagonist Model #49585. They couldn't get the likenesses for Tom Hardy or Mel Gibson so they designed a guy who doesn't look like much of anybody.   I don't know. I'd be happy to be pleasantly surprised by this game, but one thing Mad Max always had was a kind of sense of humor about itself. You don't put a flame throwing bedpan guitar vehicle in your movie without your tongue at least somewhere near your cheek. I just don't get much of a sense of personality from anything attached to this game."
MadMax,3aio91,Seaofpain,1 point,Sat Jun 20 20:32:03 2015 UTC,"I was watching an interview with one of the developers from Avalanche who stated they really worked on the story, hence the lack of multiplayer within the game. They apparently wanted to be focused on the story. I think people worry about this game because of the company. This isn't Naughty Dog or Blizzard. This is the same people who made Just Cause. I love Just Cause 2, but people have their doubts, and probably, rightfully so. I think the story cam be good, but I don't think this game can live up to a lot of people's hooes, but George Miller did play consultant on some aspects of the game, hopefully he did enough to give it the Mad Max feel."

MadMax,3aio91,WappyTrees,2,Sat Jun 20 22:29:42 2015 UTC,"Played the demo at E3, well, the car combat part, the driving felt solid, the car physics believable, the combat was actually really fun and the 20 minutes time allowance went fast.  During the demo I had an interceptor like vehicle, but instead of gas tanks in the trunk, I had ""chumbucket"" (NPC gunner for your vehicle). The objective was to take out a convoy. I had multiple weapons, but I only used the shotgun and the harpoon (which was my favorite and re-usable, while the shotgun had a very limited ammo). You could also side swipe and ram the enemy NPC cars. The enemy AI was excellent, hard charging and relentless. When I was approaching the convoy on an open area it felt like I'm in the Road Warrior movie. Ripping off wheels with the harpoon and ramming the disabled vehicles felt good, the explosions are on par with the movie's effects (the new one). Also had the chance to do a bit of a melee combat just before the car combat section, the punches felt connected and heavy, very similar to the latest Batman games.  Obviously this was a demo and a very small part of the actual game, but if the rest of the game shape up like the part I played, it will be an outstanding game (Mad Max or not). Day 1 purchase for me."

MadMax,3al588,Gnarbage,15,Sun Jun 21 07:13:56 2015 UTC,"Killing Furiosa would have wrecked the ending IMO, she was the figurehead for the people to rally around, and was the stand-out leader of the group.  Papagallo was a political leader without warrior skills, he put his money where his mouth was, but it wasn't surprising that he died."
MadMax,3al588,Turbofurball,3,Sun Jun 21 08:02:55 2015 UTC,I think Papagallo sacrificed himself for the good of his people. He knew that tanker was full if sand and knew his chances if survival were slim to none.
MadMax,3al588,Derpatologist_7,2,Sun Jun 21 09:29:40 2015 UTC,"Exactly, hence my 'put his money where his mouth was' comment ;-)  Furiosa was ready to make the same sacrifice - when she went after Joe she was already dying, hardly able to breathe.  Max saving her was needed to complete Max's story arc."
MadMax,3al588,Turbofurball,0,Sun Jun 21 13:25:56 2015 UTC,"Good points, but my opinion hasn't changed though. I would've liked more of a bitter, chaotic ending. I felt like there was a nice big bow around this ending which made it less authentic than Mad Max 2"

MadMax,3al588,darthmaverick,10,Sun Jun 21 15:23:24 2015 UTC,"I think it would be a disservice to the Furiosa character to take her out just to make us buy-in to the male character's story more. He should be able to stand on his own two feet (and I think it does - Max always leaving has to do with him and his past, not how particular episodes work out). Furiosa killing Joe at the end had a lot more emotional impact because she's the one who's grappled with this baddie most of her life. Max killing him would have felt empty.   To kill Furiosa to further Max's emotional plotline would have been a classic 'fridging' move, the kind of trope female characters often fall into in action movies that Fury Road refreshingly avoids."

MadMax,3al588,YouOnlyLiveOnceMaybe,2,Sun Jun 21 19:26:00 2015 UTC,"Assuming the video game is canon and Fury Road takes place last, she's risen after The Road Warrior at least, and probably after whatever happens in the game."
MadMax,3al588,IdiotsLantern,4,Sun Jun 21 21:10:34 2015 UTC,"Mel Gibson cameo.  I like to think that really ugly dude who gets a few seconds of screen time at the end of the movie, had a huge nose, brown skin, dread-locks and was all smiley looking up at furiousa.  I like to think its really Mel in movie make-up."
MadMax,3al588,IanMazgelis,2,Sun Jun 21 18:23:16 2015 UTC,"Furiosa is the last living authority figure in the Citadel. If she had died, no way would it have been safe for Max to leave the Wives there. The Citadel is undefended, the Wives are educated and smart but not experienced, the common people don't know their faces and won't demand their ascension... basically as far as they know, Joe was killed by a group of strangers. With Nux dead, they NEED Furiosa to establish some continuity of leadership. Without her, not only are they unlikely to ascend, but they are sitting ducks who now REALLY have nowhere to go."
MadMax,3al588,buffcode01,3,Mon Jun 22 07:36:06 2015 UTC,Hope is a mistake. If you can't fix what's broken... You'll go insane mad.
MadMax,3al588,papergangstuh,0,Sun Jun 21 18:11:22 2015 UTC,"I would have bought Mel back as Max. I thought Tom Hardy was out of place, his accent was a little odd."
MadMax,3al588,teaqualizer,0,Sun Jun 21 18:42:24 2015 UTC,Tom Hardy. Naked.
MadMax,3al588,bouli_,-1,Mon Jun 22 01:21:39 2015 UTC,I would probably like to see Gibson instead of hardy. People complain about the movie being too centred around Furiosa whereas Max does have more screen time than her. The reason why it feels like Furiosa movie is because Theron commands the screen in a way that Hardy simply doesn't. I think aswell the decision to grey out his leather and remove the grey streaks from his hair robbed the character of his distinctiveness. Even if they kept hardy but reverted to the original costume I think he would have had a greater screen presence.
MadMax,3akt8n,jochorocho,7,Sun Jun 21 04:28:08 2015 UTC,"This is all literally explained in the movie. As with Fury Road, you just have to work some things out for yourself.   Without a distraction they would never have made it, the bus and other vehicles were too slow. Without the weight behind it it wouldn't have the momentum needed to smash through cars. Also, it had to be convincing enough to keep the raiders' attention. No, the remnants are shown clearly giving up after the truck turned over, and having lost their leader. The truck did a u-turn. The gyrocopter was no longer capable of flight, but it only needs the engine to run to be able to drive. They're amazing machines, go read up ;-) Max is clearly shown with Papagallows' marauder car at the end. The dog died guarding it's master. That's a sign of the adventures they had already been on."
MadMax,3akt8n,Turbofurball,4,Sun Jun 21 08:13:07 2015 UTC,4- Why did Lord Humungus just teleport a few miles ahead and then just smashed himself into a reinforced truck?   Max does a u-turn and starts driving back. I guess Humungus was playing chicken and lost
MadMax,3akt8n,Immortan_Joe,1 point,Sun Jun 21 05:44:28 2015 UTC,"My memory is a bit hazy, but on top of what you said I believe there was a bit of a hill and Humongous had activated his nos so the car was pretty uncontrollable, too."
MadMax,3akt8n,Derpatologist_7,1 point,Sun Jun 21 09:36:57 2015 UTC,"The rig was a diversion. I don't think Max even knew it was filled with sand. He looked kind of surprised when he saw it.   If Max wasn't aware it was filled with sand, then it was filled with sand so he'd feel the weight. If it was empty then he'd of known something was up."
MadMax,3akt8n,Derpatologist_7,0,Sun Jun 21 04:31:57 2015 UTC,"Yes, I agree Max didn't know it didn't have any fuel. And yes, maybe he could have known it was a little bit too light if it was empty.  I guess I would have to see it again but I think Max proposes the rig but before that they acted like they couldn't carry the fuel."

MadMax,3akt8n,nemothorx,1 point,Sun Jun 21 06:11:39 2015 UTC,"that's the main road out of there. The other ways are slower paths on rougher roads. If you want speed in a big truck that doesn't turn easily, you go on the main road - even if it IS the focus of Humungus' siege"
MadMax,3akt8n,sombray,2,Sun Jun 21 14:43:15 2015 UTC,"No, when he got his gas in the Interceptor and left"
MadMax,3akt8n,sombray,2,Sun Jun 21 20:46:40 2015 UTC,First time he leaves
MadMax,3akt8n,nemothorx,-1,Sun Jun 21 20:47:01 2015 UTC,"perhaps largely for the same reason? The story required that he crash and be defeated in this attempt. A way would have been found regardless of any direction he left in, and someone would have a quibble with it.   He clearly gets a long way - he leaves as the sun is barely rising (from memory), and isn't defeated till the sun is well up.   My quibble with the sequence is how relatively easily he's defeated by a pipe to the windshield, but I don't call it a plot hole or anything. It's just a bit which doesn't seem to quite fit for Max compared to the skill he's shown at the start of the movie. Still plausible, just poorly told."
MadMax,3ag54j,KernCreations,4,Fri Jun 19 21:37:12 2015 UTC,That's amazing! Ever consider doing other Mad Max creations after this one is complete?

MadMax,3ag54j,HoustonsSolution,2,Sat Jun 20 01:16:33 2015 UTC,"I actually started by grabbing a framing hammer and a cheap parts store block dolly, and watched how the metal moved. Then I got a $50 welder and stuck it together. I kept playing around, got cooler toys, and now, at 26, I do stuff like this totally self taught."
MadMax,3ag54j,HoustonsSolution,2,Sat Jun 20 01:25:07 2015 UTC,Do you feel that anyone can pick this up or that talent is more vital than just an aid?
MadMax,3ag54j,I_am_awaited,3,Sat Jun 20 01:35:34 2015 UTC,"I think it is something that can be learned, for sure.

MadMax,3afte7,AfraidOfTechnology,9,Fri Jun 19 20:06:37 2015 UTC,I enjoyed the Jurassic Park crowd last weekend as well. I've never had the entire theater all to myself. It was nice.
MadMax,3afte7,CharlieHarvey,4,Fri Jun 19 21:23:22 2015 UTC,It's the best. Back when I still lived in a city I used to love going to the cinema at odd times to try to get it all to myself. My ex-husband and I used to be all alone in the theatre lots of times.  Like if you go to see the earliest showing of an action film you could be there all by yourself just because most people who are at the cinema at 2pm are there to see kid's movies not Mad Max or whatever.
MadMax,3afte7,AfraidOfTechnology,3,Sat Jun 20 01:14:05 2015 UTC,"That sounds lovely, going to the cinema with someone special and having the place all to yourselves.  I always assumed matinee showings would be busy because of the discount, but last week I caught a matinee showing of Fury Road and there were only two other people in the theater with me. It was nice."
MadMax,3afte7,squitzeaux,2,Sat Jun 20 02:18:55 2015 UTC,That must be nice. I went to see it the other night and some asshole brought in a fucking subway and was messing with the paper and making a ton of noise. Other people brought in soda cans and shit. Just an overall shitty experience.

MadMax,3agcfg,IrrelevantLeprechaun,2,Sat Jun 20 01:56:42 2015 UTC,This!
MadMax,3agcfg,ser_sheep_shagger,13,Sat Jun 20 03:57:43 2015 UTC,Fury Road is better in my mind because George Miller had so much time to reflect and re-imagine the world.  He took everything that made the originals good and ramped it up ten fold.  The element of danger seems a lot more intense to me.  Something about an organized army of kamikaze war-boys seems a lot more intimidating than a rag-tag gang marauding the wasteland.
MadMax,3agcfg,YouOnlyLiveOnceMaybe,6,Sat Jun 20 04:42:49 2015 UTC,"For me, yes it's better. More involving, more tense, more complex. It's my favourite move now.  Mad Max 2 will always hold a special place in my heart though (as does Mad Max 1, for different reasons)"
MadMax,3agcfg,Turbofurball,3,Sat Jun 20 09:43:23 2015 UTC,"I love them both, but The Road Warrior is a classic…it was different from anything else in cinema, at that time.   Yes, Fury Road is technically more full of OMG AWESOME!!!, but it’s not really a fair comparison…TRW was done with minimal budget and effects, and still manages to create an entire world within the film…it’s a unique achievement, and more impressive, in some ways."
MadMax,3agcfg,littlejohnnyjewel,4,Sat Jun 20 19:05:04 2015 UTC,"It's a tough call but I think that in the end, Fury Road just did it bigger and better. There were far more ""wow"" moments for me and I just think the characters were more compelling. Road Warrior is still perfect the way it is though."
MadMax,3agcfg,treverhaas,2,Fri Jun 19 23:36:44 2015 UTC,"You described it perfect. RW is still my favorite movie of all time, probably for the sheer number of times I've seen it. Once Fury Road hits blu-Ray, it will be a toss up."
MadMax,3agcfg,maxrockatansky13,5,Sat Jun 20 01:39:46 2015 UTC,Nah. Road Warrior is original Jurassic Park (despite not being the first MM) as Fury Road is Jurassic World for me.
MadMax,3agcfg,SinServant,4,Sat Jun 20 00:58:35 2015 UTC,"I would say it is. My order goes:   Fury Road Road Warrior Beyond Thunderdome  Mad Max   My 3 and 4 change back and forth, but to be clear, I love all the movies for different reasons, but Fury Road was the bar for me, no doubt."
MadMax,3agcfg,HoustonsSolution,2,Sat Jun 20 01:14:10 2015 UTC,They're all such different movies.  It's hard to compare.  I'd call it a tie between RW and MMFR because RW has more talking in it and the helicopter pilot character and I like that.
MadMax,3agcfg,skonen_blades,2,Sat Jun 20 01:51:07 2015 UTC,I like Fury Road a little more than Road Warrior. I'll link to one of my other comments explaining my reasoning cuz I'm lazy. Basically I think Fury Road is a suped up version of Road Warrior.
MadMax,3agcfg,The_Nez,2,Sat Jun 20 04:46:18 2015 UTC,"Absolutely not.  ""Fury Road"" was awesome. You just can't get those cars to move the way they did if you went ahead and CGI'd it all. It is one of the best IP's to come back from the dead.  With that being out there, the focus in this flick was off Max, and on Furiosa and Nux. I did not connect to the character the way I did with the Road Warrior. I am exited for future Mad Max movies, but The Road Warrior will be the best Mad Max flick in my mind, followed by the original and then ""Fury Road"".  I'd like to pretend ""Thunderdome"" does not exist. PG13 killed it. The train killed it... Entertainment yes, but good? Nah. The movie brings it back to the younger crowd that probably didn't even know about Mad Max till the trailers started showing. But the older fans of the franchise (which includes anyone who became a fan before fury road was even a glimpse on the horizon) will be hard to sway.  May you ride eternal... Shiny and Chrome. The movie had some great spots, but Max wise? Ah... Mediocre..."
MadMax,3agcfg,TheDutchTexan,2,Sat Jun 20 17:41:57 2015 UTC,"yeah I feel the same way. Tom Hardy's portrayal was very interesting, just wish we got to see him explore the role more. The Road Warrior felt like it was more intimate with getting to know Max"
MadMax,3agcfg,sombray,2,Sat Jun 20 17:44:38 2015 UTC,The Road Warrior is more subtle and plausible. Fury Road is beautiful apocalyptic fantasy action.

While Road Warrior is probably one of my favorite 80's action movies, Fury Road is one of the best films i have ever seen. Comparing Fury Road to any of the original films is like comparing the MLB to JV ball."

The game was successfully crowd funded through Kickstarter, part of a trend of high-profile developers launching projects on the site. After the postponement of the original release date from October 2013, it was released on September 19, 2014.

MadMax,3acyft,IanMazgelis,7,Fri Jun 19 02:32:26 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure. The Acadamy famously hates genre films, and ""Mad Max"" is unquestionably a genre picture. It's not like ""Black Swan"" where you can take a horror movie and just tell everyone it's a ""psychological thriller,"" and suddenly it's respectable. ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" is an action film, and although cinephiles everywhere will admit to Mad Max being the moment everyone started taking Australian-made movies seriously, it's gonna struggle with the fact that it's a genre flick.   I could see it being up for some technical and aesthetic Oscars, maybe things like Production Design, Costume Design, Sound Design, Special Effects, Sound Editing, Editing, Cinematography (John Seale coming out of retirement is the kind of story the Acadamy loves)... With a good campaign, Charlize MIGHT get a nod, but really being ""Best Supporting Actress"" would be wrong for her. She'd be ""Best Actress,"" and although the Acadamy LOVES Charlize, I can't see them giving her another Best Actress oscar for an action film.   I predict they'll use Tom Hardy as a presenter at the ceremony, though. Especially if ""LEGEND"" winds up being as good as it looks like it's going to be. His star is on the rise and bar some kind of catastrophe, he'll be a certified A-List movie star before too much longer."
MadMax,3acyft,IdiotsLantern,5,Fri Jun 19 07:25:13 2015 UTC,"Trying to be realistic here because politics at the awards often skews a little but I think it might ... win Best Visual Effects plus get a nomination for Charlize as Best Supporting Actress, a nomination for Best Cinematography and maybe one smaller nomination like Best Production Design. Thats optimistic but thats my pick."
MadMax,3acyft,jdmax,4,Fri Jun 19 04:04:36 2015 UTC,Theron was the female lead.
MadMax,3acyft,ILiveIDieILiveAgain,0,Fri Jun 19 06:50:48 2015 UTC,"it doesn't matter. her performance, IMO was not strong enough to win best actress. Did you see Girl Interrupted?  Jolie won best supporting and its an identical situation with two leads"
MadMax,3acyft,jdmax,2,Fri Jun 19 10:32:01 2015 UTC,"Yes, but she can't be nominated for Best Supporting Actress 'cause she was in the lead role. Tom Hardy is the male lead, Theron the female lead. Supporting roles would be Nux and Angharad (for example)."
MadMax,3acyft,ILiveIDieILiveAgain,2,Fri Jun 19 10:42:56 2015 UTC,This is considered a film with a dual leads. Hardy and Theron can both be nominated for either lead or supporting awards.
MadMax,3acyft,dmasterdyne,0,Fri Jun 19 13:30:52 2015 UTC,"By your logic, how did jolie win best supporting then?"

I'm not going to make any calls on what I think it would win, but I will say, I think it wont win original script, even if it gets nominated."

MadMax,3acyft,jdmax,1 point,Sat Jun 20 01:52:16 2015 UTC,"ROTK was nominated in the same year as lost in translation and master and commander which is arguably a vastly superior film. But the Oscars it received that year were more in recognition of Jackson and the team's achievement for the trilogy overall.   I think Fury Road is a stunning picture and out would be interesting to see what kind of press pack they give to academy members in the run up to the nominations. Would it push the feminist and silent movie slants of the picture to appeal to academy sensibilities?  With recent films like Rush, Gran Torino and Drive being passed over by the Academy it's tough to call."
MadMax,3acyft,teaqualizer,0,Fri Jun 19 06:46:21 2015 UTC,Then Fury Road might get recognition for the Mad Max series overall. You never know right?  Mad Max 1979 was the first film to mount cameras on vehicles and it changed the way car chases were shot
MadMax,3acyft,jdmax,1 point,Sat Jun 20 01:05:57 2015 UTC,I think that's a bit of a stretch considering that none of the original mad max trilogy was Oscar nominated for best picture. Fellowship and Two Towers had been nominated for best picture in the previous two years so it had the momentum to go one step further with ROTK.

I dont see why they wouldn't have branded him after catching him, but I always had the feeling they didn't just because of that scene where they fail to the first time."
MadMax,3abcoa,BobaFetted,2,Fri Jun 19 13:03:13 2015 UTC,"Comic book spoiler below!  In the comic released yesterday, Furiosa #1, they do show how the Wives get from the vault to the War Rig with Furiosa's help.  If you guys want I can post a picture from the comic book, but I don't want to spoil it that much for anyone who plans on picking up a copy.  I'm not sure if MM gets the branding on his neck, but from my understanding, everyone branded is considered IM's ""property""."
MadMax,3abcoa,dmasterdyne,3,Thu Jun 18 18:50:36 2015 UTC,"I asked Dayna Grant on Twitter if Max got the brand (she would have been in a position to know) and she said he didn't. So the dark smudge might just be a spot. But if someone happens to know Jacob Tomuri or Tom Hardy, they could ask them and know for sure. They won't return my texts for some reason. :P"
MadMax,3abcoa,nemothorx,2,Thu Jun 18 18:54:59 2015 UTC,"I think it's more likely that in the context of the story that he was branded (but perhaps not shown in the movie, hence not bothering with any makeup) rather than not branded at all."
MadMax,3abcoa,CharlieHarvey,1 point,Thu Jun 18 22:47:55 2015 UTC,"Thing is, if he were branded, he'd have worn the makeup regardless of whether or not they planned on showing it to the camera. All the War Boyz always wore the make-up, and so did Furiosa and the wives, and all of their stunt doubles. George's style was so free-wheeling that you couldn't count on things not being on camera. Nickolas Holt was minus a boot even when his character's feet weren't being seen.   The idea that he'd be branded without the actor ever wearing the make up is... iffy. I don't know.  But I also know all the stuff in the organic mechanic's lair was shot after the fact, so maybe he had the make up in that scene but didn't have it later. We don't now. Short of someone actually meeting Tom Hardy and asking him, I don't think we'll ever know for sure."
MadMax,3abcoa,CharlieHarvey,2,Thu Jun 18 23:37:03 2015 UTC,"I think it could go either way. It really depends (in my opinion) on how long after he was re-captured we meet Nux, etc.  They absolutely would have branded him, no doubt in my mind about that, but it's possible that after re-capturing him they would decide to just do it later and then don't get around to it before Nux takes him."
MadMax,3abcoa,CharlieHarvey,3,Fri Jun 19 01:04:08 2015 UTC,"George Miller said the entire movie takes place over the span of three days, which would mean Max got shipped out with Nux practically as soon as he arrived in the Citadel. I have a hard time buying that, just because Max seems to be sitting in that cage with the air of a man who's been there for a while, but I also would have a hard time believing he was prisoner for much more then a day before getting hooked up to Nux. Although there's no guarantee that Nux was the first person to ever get a transfusion from Max, especially since he doesn't have a muzzle in the cage but does have a muzzle while he's hanging as a blood bag, so some time has passed."
MadMax,3abcoa,CharlieHarvey,2,Fri Jun 19 01:23:13 2015 UTC,"It's funny that you mention Max's attitude! When I saw the film the first time I assumed that weeks or maybe even months had passed when I saw Max in the cage, because he seems so docile and resigned to his fate.  It was only on my second viewing that I realized that it all happened pretty close to his capture."
MadMax,3abcoa,CharlieHarvey,1 point,Fri Jun 19 01:29:49 2015 UTC,"Maybe they figured they'd let him starve in a cage for a few days while his blood gets drained away as a way of knocking the fight out of him before they tried branding him again. I don't know how long they plan on keeping their Blood Bags alive in the Citadel: do they drain them and then just throw them away, replacing them with more recent captures, or do they actually spend food and water keeping them alive? Max was clearly not the only Blood Bag they had, and unhappy as they looked, blood from a corpse isn't any good for their needs, so... I don't know.   Either way, something must have happened after he was first hooked up that got them to stick that muzzle on him, so he was still willing to struggle even then. Maybe they figured they'd let him hang a little longer just to make sure there were no more incidents."
MadMax,3abcoa,CharlieHarvey,2,Fri Jun 19 02:08:26 2015 UTC,"I agree!  My thinking is they probably keep them alive as long as possible. It doesn't take that much food or water to keep a sedentary person reasonably healthy and a living full-life just keeps on making more blood, so it would be in their best interest to try to keep them going for as long as they possibly can.  Based on how quick Max was to start trying to chew Nux's fingers off when he's trying to get free from his unconscious body, I am guessing that Max bit a number of war boys during the course of his imprisonment. Ha."
MadMax,3abcoa,nemothorx,1 point,Fri Jun 19 02:25:25 2015 UTC,"She's a stunt double, so I don't think she knows everything about the story. Plus, her proof was hardly conclusive. She didn't say, 'I read it in the script' or 'I asked Miller'. She said, 'Max escapes before they brand him'. Yes and they re-capture him 2 minutes later.  She didn't seem to be speaking with any more actual knowledge about it than what we have."
MadMax,3abcoa,CharlieHarvey,2,Fri Jun 19 01:00:01 2015 UTC,"She was talking about her own brand, which she wore in every scene she was in, whether it was going to be on camera or not. I asked if Max wore one, and she said no.   Yes the reasons she gave were story based, but at the bare minimum, we know there's no point in looking for a band on Max in any scene Furiosa would have been a part of, otherwise Dayna would have seen the make-up.   Whether he had one in the cave is the question now. That's either a dirt smudge on his back or a very raw and recent brand, but if he was branded quite that recently, I can't see him being quite that cavalier about throwing jackets and stuff on his back. Brands really hurt."
MadMax,3abcoa,nemothorx,1 point,Fri Jun 19 01:19:43 2015 UTC,"My own thinking is that he doesn't have the brand, for the story-based reason that I mentioned in my last post (they probably said they would just do it later and never got around to it). The practical reason I think he doesn't have one is because then he would have to have it in any film that takes place after this.   The timeline of MM films is purposely ambiguous. Max not having a brand would just make things easier from a filmmaking perspective, I think, and help to keep things even more ambiguous about when the events of later films happen, etc.  As for the point about the brand hurting. Films don't concern themselves too much with stuff like that. Max is a man who is used to pain. Splendid is a woman who has spent most of her life living in a well-decorated cage where she was insulated from any and everything, yet, she takes a bullet to the leg and acts like it was a mosquito bite."
MadMax,3abcoa,CharlieHarvey,1 point,Fri Jun 19 01:25:54 2015 UTC,"The bullet grazes her leg, it doesn't enter it. It's nasty but it's a pretty superficial wound. And it does make Splendid freeze.   Plus Spendid is the one who's face is covered in scars, so she's experienced quite a bit of pain in her life, one way or another. She didn't shrug off the leg injury either. That and the damaged door are why she slipped from the rig."
MadMax,3abcoa,nemothorx,0,Fri Jun 19 01:51:44 2015 UTC,As I recall the bullet seems to go right through her calf. At least when they show it the trickle of blood seems to be coming from a hole right in the back of her leg.
MadMax,3abcoa,nemothorx,2,Fri Jun 19 02:21:38 2015 UTC,"It looks more like a cut on the side of her leg to me. Bloody but not serious. Max wasn't trying to shoot her, he was firing warning shots and grazed her by accident."

MadMax,3abcoa,CharlieHarvey,2,Fri Jun 19 02:15:35 2015 UTC,"Despite having seen the film four times now and seeing the guy who got the same tattoo on his back just a few days ago on this subreddit I had completely and utterly forgotten about the tattoo!  But a neck brand is slightly more visible than a back tattoo, since Max isn't usually shirtless (if he ever has been? I can't remember)."
MadMax,3abcoa,jdmax,0,Fri Jun 19 02:19:24 2015 UTC,"yeah, neck brand would definitely be more visible, but the tat would still count as a continuity-limiting factor... if George cares...  :)"

MadMax,3a9y8h,ILiveIDieILiveAgain,6,Thu Jun 18 11:56:52 2015 UTC,"As someone else mentioned, the comics don't go into a lot of detail. I actually wanted way more details! The first issue is both Nux and Joe's histories and the info they actually give on them wouldn't fill a paragraph, typed. I've said this before. The comic was great, don't get me wrong! But there are only going to be four of them (as I understand) and the nature of comics doesn't lend itself to too much text to begin with...  Anyway, I think you're looking at it from the wrong point-of-view. It's not about being right or wrong; it's just about talking about a film franchise you love with like-minded people.  I posted an idea I had a couple weeks ago and someone who disagreed apologized to me for posting his dissenting view. That is the fun! Posting things and then reading other people's ideas. We're not competing with each other to have the rightest ideas.  You should read the comics. If you're interested in Mad Max, why deprive yourself just because you're scared that your theories won't be correct? The new information will just let you come up with new questions and theories."

I don't really think anyone's theories can be ""in-correct"" (unless they're really far-fetched). And I don't feel like I deprive myself - I still do have my imagination (and it's very vivid!).   What I'm worried about is that the new information will limit my imagination! Maybe it's a stupid fear, dunno?  (Also I don't like the fact some things are described in detail in the comics. I do not want to see raping or things like that. I was so glad they were left out in the movie.)"
MadMax,3a9y8h,CharlieHarvey,1 point,Thu Jun 18 13:40:49 2015 UTC,"Well, apart from this sub I don't follow a lot of MM news, so I haven't been reading anything about the storylines for the upcoming comics. There was no rape or anything remotely like it in the first issue and I haven't heard anyone saying that the rest of them are going to either.  Uncomfortable topics are lightly brushed up against in the film. I would imagine the comics will be the same. I mean, the wives are imprisoned sex slaves forced to bear children against their will, but it isn't shown, obviously. I imagine the comics will follow suit.  You don't have to read anything you don't want to. But you're going to learn what happens in them anyway, just from posting here. And if any of your ideas clash with what's been establishing, well, clearly the creator's word is going to be taken over yours and you will be corrected or contradicted, but as I said, this is meant to be fun, so don't read anything you're not interested in."
MadMax,3a9y8h,memberzs,1 point,Thu Jun 18 14:21:03 2015 UTC,"In the furiosa issue (nobspoilers don't worry). Some pretty uncomfortable topics get a good amount of detail. They are used to illustrate the emotions and struggles the characters have in the FR world especially the breeders. The the narrator also follows what seems to be historical tradition of ""those who won the war write history"" and then bad mouth  a previous leader including the possibility of there being deeper reason for some of his actions."
MadMax,3a9y8h,Sullyville,3,Sat Jun 20 00:29:49 2015 UTC,"They give away nothing. The comics are full of people speculating, but the main characters don't say anything.

MadMax,3a9y8h,memberzs,1 point,Thu Jun 18 19:09:57 2015 UTC,"I agree, they also just raise more questions and room for speculation."
MadMax,3a9y8h,dmasterdyne,2,Sat Jun 20 00:30:44 2015 UTC,"I have both issues of what has been released so far. They really don't give much away at all. Some of what is implied in the comics actually creates more questions and room for speculation. I was skeptical, as you are, but as far as the first two comics go, this has not been the case."
MadMax,3a9y8h,IdiotsLantern,2,Thu Jun 18 16:17:08 2015 UTC,"The comics are ""based on a story by Frank Miller"" but that's not a lot to go on. Frank Miller himself really isn't into continuity, especially when it comes to Mad Max.    So in my mind, the Comics might or might not be cannon. I think everyone will read them and decide for themselves if they think it fits with what they saw in the movie. So no, I don't think the comics will ruin any of the fan speculation.   If the next film does turn out to be a prequel, it will probably run right over the comics anyway. So the comics are interesting, but the movie is still the movie."

MadMax,3a6smd,-Leonhart,5,Wed Jun 17 17:56:48 2015 UTC,"I always did wonder how they didn't run out of gas. I guess you could argue oil reserves are huge and with a dramatically reduced population they could last quite awhile, gas inefficiency aside."
MadMax,3a6smd,primus202,6,Wed Jun 17 20:54:37 2015 UTC,"The real issue is finding it. It's much better to be able to produce your own fuel, which is why Humungus wanted the refinery. Somewhere like the Citadel that can grow crops could just grow corn or something and make ethanol. With some different parts and some tuning, engines can run on pretty much anything that burns. Diesels especially."
MadMax,3a6smd,gtr427,2,Wed Jun 17 21:17:00 2015 UTC,"Well, we just have to assume that Gastown is such a refinery town? Also, the people of the Citadel seem to live a grander vehicular lifestyle than most people (if we assume that all three films exist in the same universe, which for the purpose of this argument I'm going to do instead of taking the obvious answer and say 'this film's budget was bigger'). So, if we pretend that the vehicles aren't amazing in Fury Road because of a bigger film budget, then we could say that they're bigger and grander because the Citadel has access to more guzzoline than most people. The Buzzards have cars, yes, but there's no double-decker Caddies on tractor wheels or War Rigs among them. Their cars look like tinker toys next to what Joe and his war boys are playing with. The Rock Riders just have some dirt bikes and the Vuvalini seem to just have a few old motorcycles.  There were no real impressive vehicles in the first two Mad Maxs either. Max's Interceptor was built before the world technically ended and when gas could still be purchased at the gas station and people had jobs and gas economy probably wasn't taken into consideration as much as it would have been if the car had been built after the world completely went to hell.  Anyway, my point being - I don't think that the vehicles of Fury Road are typical. I think that much like our current world everything is divided into the haves and the have-nots. Joe can afford to let his war boys outfit themselves with such outrageous vehicles and so he does. Most other groups would not be able to."
MadMax,3a6smd,CharlieHarvey,1 point,Thu Jun 18 02:15:55 2015 UTC,"Well, my point was more that even if the gasoline gets used up, there will still be lots of fuel. Even if there was no refinery and you couldn't grow crops, you could still have motor vehicles for as long as you could find things to burn.  An older diesel engine could run on home heating oil, kerosene (with a little lubricant), automatic transmission fluid, and most hydraulic oil with no modifications. Vegetable oil works too, but not during the winter unless you can keep it warm or blend it with something else so it won't gel up. Waste vegetable oil (which you'd find at every fast food place) is usable after being filtered and de-watered, which apparently also works for used motor oil as long as you mix it 1:1 with regular diesel.  Modified petrol engines could run on alcohol (ethanol), propane, and even just compressed air.  Supporting as many vehicles as in Fury Road would definitely require being able to refine crude oil into fuel or produce a lot of biomass, though."

I agree with your points.  About the quote, at a certain point you do also have to say that it is a film and some allowances do have to be made for that.  The cars is something that people have been poking fun at Mad Max for since the beginning. I was not a MM fan before Fury Road. I had the first film on VHS, but before getting into the original films because of Fury Road I would have just said that I neither liked nor disliked any of the MM films. But one thing that everyone's always mentioned about the films is, 'This is a post-apocalyptic world where people murder each other for gasoline, yet everyone drives muscle cars!'  As much as we like to like to dissect the films we love and work out how everything could be possible, there is a certain element of simply 'because it's cool' at work, too."
MadMax,3a6smd,CharlieHarvey,4,Thu Jun 18 13:16:27 2015 UTC,"Oil was a precious resource in road fury, but it looked like there was still a LOT of it left(esp. Considering the vehicles all being supercharged/turbo'd/ nitrous on huge off-road tires) , water seemed to be the super precious resource"
MadMax,3a6smd,Jaxon258,5,Wed Jun 17 22:20:10 2015 UTC,In the US we use 19 million barrels every day.  There is a fuckton of oil and with most of the population gone it's basically a limitless resource.  The only limitation would be in processing it.  They made the first gasoline engine in like 1870(?) so I would think if they could process it back then they would still have no trouble doing it in the mad max universe.

MadMax,3a9jw1,skonen_blades,5,Thu Jun 18 08:56:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah totally. Upon reflection, the R stuff is pretty much all implied rather than shown.

Offhand, though, I'd say the pregnant woman getting run over and the subsequent hasty C-section, even if offscreen, crosses that PG-13 line."

Many modern movies (especially action, and ESPECIALLY post-apocalyptic type) desaturate already, so Miller felt that to stand out, it the options were to saturate it up, or desaturate the whole way to Black and White.

MadMax,3a543n,sexyfantastic,9,Wed Jun 17 08:23:26 2015 UTC,"Actually, based on what I've read I'm under the impression that the theatrical cut is the director's cut. Everything I've seen has pointed to Miller getting absolute free reign over the movie. Usually a director's cut comes along when the studio or MPAA or some other organization makes them cut or edit parts of the movie, and the director's cut is the unabridged version that the director truly envisioned.  As far as I can tell, nobody was telling Miller what he had to or couldn't do. Unless he changes his mind about decisions he made on his own sometime between now and home media release, I doubt a director's cut would be any different from the theatrical. I the case of an extended cut, Fury Road is about as close to a perfect movie as you can get. Removing more than a single second would be to the film's detriment, and I feel that adding one would be the same."
MadMax,3a543n,pickelsurprise,8,Wed Jun 17 14:16:20 2015 UTC,They'll probably have the deleted scenes as a part of the extras on the DVD/Blu-ray but I don't know if there will be a director's/extended cut since George Miller has said in interviews that the theatrical version is the cut he wanted because it had the right pacing.
MadMax,3a543n,KingofMadCows,5,Wed Jun 17 08:58:38 2015 UTC,"In this YouTube interview with Collider, George hints that there might be a small snippet of deleted footage (lending more backstory), but he categorically shoots down the idea of an extended edition. He also confirms that he had final cut."
MadMax,3a543n,supermattkelly,3,Wed Jun 17 18:38:51 2015 UTC,It would be nice to have the option to watch both ... that has been done on DVDs before
MadMax,3a543n,Turbofurball,2,Wed Jun 17 10:15:30 2015 UTC,It sounds like the theatrical version is the director's cut.  So there aren't two to watch.
MadMax,3a543n,candleflame3,2,Wed Jun 17 12:48:30 2015 UTC,"The theatrical release was edited after test screenings (ie. there's a moment where a woman tries to enter the citadel by flashing her boobs), the test screenings cut out a lot of material from the early edits."
MadMax,3a543n,Turbofurball,2,Wed Jun 17 14:41:03 2015 UTC,You might get some boobs in the DVD extras then!

MadMax,3a4dfe,YouOnlyLiveOnceMaybe,5,Wed Jun 17 03:25:58 2015 UTC,"Not quite related, but I've seen no evidence that the girl is Max's daughter. Max had a son, who's only called Sprog (kid) in the first film.  May be broad strokes of continuity, but she calls him Max, not Daddy or Dad (so far as I remember). She might be someone he failed to save sometime before Fury Road."
MadMax,3a4dfe,Hamlet7768,7,Wed Jun 17 06:04:58 2015 UTC,Her name was Glory. And she called him dad once. It wasn't his daughter though.
MadMax,3a4dfe,Derpatologist_7,3,Wed Jun 17 06:30:46 2015 UTC,"She called out for ""Pa,"" but that might or might not have been directed at Max. She also called him ""Max"" at several points, especially when she seems to be looking for him, so maybe she was someone else's daughter and she was calling for her own Pa, or she started calling Max ""Pa"" because he sort of adopted her, or maybe she WAS his daughter and he had and lost another kid between films somehow, or maybe George just changed the age and gender of Max's kid because who needs continuity anyway....   Could be anything. Max is nuts, remember? I don't think you're going to get much actual information out of him."

MadMax,3a4dfe,I_am_awaited,5,Thu Jun 18 04:56:14 2015 UTC,"As someone else said, she calls him 'papa' at one point in the film, but I can't remember where.  The last time this was brought up I got into a conversation with some guy whose ideas made the most sense to me: either he had a second family at some point after his wife and first son were killed or he struck up a relationship with a woman who already had a daughter and, obviously, he became close enough to them that she calls him both 'Max' and 'papa'.  The little girl keeps saying, specifically, 'Where are you, Max?' He has visions of her saying that more than he has visions of her dying or anything else. Miller's had decades to come up with these stories; I'm sure it'll be covered in the comic(s) or in a later film."
MadMax,3a4dfe,CharlieHarvey,2,Wed Jun 17 09:40:00 2015 UTC,yes i thought she said papa.  so i guess i just assumed daughter on that one.

MadMax,3a2c8e,dmasterdyne,6,Tue Jun 16 18:02:42 2015 UTC,It's amazing how many of these design concepts were actually fully realised in the films production.   Joe's lair is pretty much exactly the way it's shown here in the finished film.

The story of Fury Road is really a series of visual moments, and it's really cool to see different ways the same moment was imagined (like Max coming upon the women carrying Nux), and to think that these moments have been around as a story for such a long time before the film was actually made."

He also has a tendency to recycle a lot of dialogue throughout his films so borrowing a line from one of his favorites makes sense. Plus it's the last line from the narrator in both films, which both involve a sort of rogue male character fighting against all odds and class systems for survival. Of course Titanic ends the way it does,  but I would totally buy Cameron using that line simply because he couldn't think of another. Not as  a ""ah ha,  Road Warrior""  reference but just a borrowed line that's catchable if you're paying attention. Plus I've never heard it used elsewhere.   Edited cuz fucking autocorrect"

MadMax,3a1aq7,BobaFetted,4,Tue Jun 16 13:20:18 2015 UTC,"I googled this out of curiosity and found this thread on Mad Max Movies: http://www.madmaxmovies.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=13&t=11064  Someone said that if you have the art book there's a drawing on page 52 that explains how the arm works. He says it's powered by a 'small petrol engine'.  CouplaDaisyGo says: 'Have a careful look at freezeframes. It's unexplained but auto mechanical, there's a pullstarter and a twostroke cylinder head and some glimpses of fuel lines and maybe a fuel tank to power/charge it so perhaps it's supposed to have some hydraulic or pneumatic pressure accumulator that gets charged up for a few minutes a day to power rams and pistons to drive the fingers.'  Knightrider says this: 'I did not think it was that hi tech at all. I got the impression the arm was supposed to be a piece of junk because it kept falling off, the thing runs on gasoline like it was built from an old chainsaw motor or something. Probably cobbled together in Joe's garages with the same tech that put together all of those crazy vehicles.  there is the question of how the finger work that does seems hi tech, but that might just be a simple open/close hydraulic mechanism that operates by twisting her arm a certain way or flexing muscles. To me the whole thing looks like it was made from scrap.'  I think the Knightrider is the closest. I think the war boy mechanics cobbled it together for her out of bits and pieces and the fingers work on some very simple function, either when she moves her arm a certain way or (even simpler) the fingers close when pressure is applied to the palm, like when gripping a steering wheel.  Also, a guy had a good idea in this thread posted 9 days ago: https://www.reddit.com/r/MadMax/comments/38v9f7/how_does_furiosas_arm_work/  My favourite reply is the one that says: 'It uses a suspension system, called ""dis-belief""'."

MadMax,39z3ly,Derpatologist_7,5,Tue Jun 16 11:47:28 2015 UTC,yeah I'm with you there i don't rember any rape
MadMax,39z3ly,dogatemyfeather,1 point,Tue Jun 16 12:27:16 2015 UTC,Must be a deleted scene. Apparently another deleted one was the Organic Mechanic killing Miss Giddy.
MadMax,39z3ly,Derpatologist_7,5,Tue Jun 16 12:37:00 2015 UTC,"It's possible OP meant the implied rape, ie the Wives' situation? There hasn't been any suggestion in any of the interviews that a rape scene would have been filmed then cut."

MadMax,39z3ly,Dragredder,8,Wed Jun 17 10:28:02 2015 UTC,"The MPAA says ""Rated R for intense sequences of violence throughout, and for disturbing images"" Perhaps it's the non-stop intensity of the action that puts it over the top? The interesting thing to me is that except for the lizard eating, Fury Road never deliberately goes for the gross-out. It's all implied and off screen. For an R rating I definitely expected a lot worse."
MadMax,39z3ly,LogicalTimber,0,Mon Jun 15 23:53:15 2015 UTC,yeah I figured if they are going R might as well go for it and show me a few faces being chainsawed off
MadMax,39z3ly,HoustonsSolution,9,Mon Jun 15 23:56:49 2015 UTC,That's the problem with the rating system. Either the studio tones down the movie to get a PG-13 rating or amps it up to being way too much gore since they'll have an R rating anyway. This is one of the few movies that stays in the middle of those extremes
MadMax,39z3ly,Turbofurball,3,Tue Jun 16 00:48:42 2015 UTC,And its all the better for sticking to its guns :-)
MadMax,39z3ly,CharlieHarvey,6,Tue Jun 16 10:32:11 2015 UTC,"There is the scene where one of the polecats get hit with a grenade (not sure what happens, actually) and as he flies backward you see that his entire body has been blown open and his organs are falling out and his ribcage is completely exposed, but it goes by so fast I only noticed it when I saw the film in IMAX on my third viewing.  Other things they might have objected to: there are sort of boobs when it shows Joe and Rictus testing the mothers' milk, people gleefully sacrificing their lives in suicide-bomber-esque orgies of religious violence, an old woman takes a chainsaw to the neck (even though it's barely shown).   None of the above seems worthy of an R to me, but they must have disagreed, obviously."
MadMax,39z3ly,skonen_blades,8,Tue Jun 16 00:54:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah totally.  Upon reflection, the R stuff is pretty much all implied rather than shown.  I'd say it's no more violent than Transformers in most scenes.  Offhand, though, I'd say the pregnant woman getting run over and the subsequent hasty C-section, even if offscreen, crosses that PG-13 line."
MadMax,39z3ly,CharlieHarvey,4,Mon Jun 15 23:56:35 2015 UTC,"Well, the second time that I saw it there was a mother and her two sons sitting one seat to my left and one of her boys who appeared to be around 10-11 (he wasn't a little kid!) was terrified almost from the start, but by the time that Nux and Slit went forehead-to-forehead over the steering wheel he was begging mum to leave. The other boy must have been really enjoying it (I couldn't see or hear him from where I sat as he was on the other side of mum) as she kept asking the scared kid to give it another minute.  They made it as far as when the war boy is shot in the head with the crossbow and kamikazes one of the buzzards. At that point the kid was so scared he was almost crying and the mum took them out.  So I guess there are kids out there that this film would be too intense for.   Now the difference is that I'm not in the US and the film is rated 14+/15 here in the UK and not 18+ like it is in the States."
MadMax,39z3ly,jumpyg1258,8,Tue Jun 16 00:47:31 2015 UTC,yeah I think 14+ is like the perfect rating for this movie.
MadMax,39z3ly,LogicalTimber,3,Tue Jun 16 00:50:35 2015 UTC,"Just curious, what is there to be scared about with this movie?  Now I remember I was a kid going to see Jurassic Park and was flipping out scared when the T-Rex came, there's nothing anywhere near that terrifying in this movie."
MadMax,39z3ly,leonryan,3,Tue Jun 16 03:06:14 2015 UTC,what is there to be scared about with this movie?   To adults who are already jaded from too many mediocre gore fests? Not much. But the noise alone would have been way too much for me as a kid.
MadMax,39z3ly,CharlieHarvey,2,Tue Jun 16 03:33:51 2015 UTC,i think it must be the fat ladies getting milked and the cesarean/abortion scene.  those seem like things a bible biased country would get upset about.  it was rated M15 in Australia.
MadMax,39z3ly,ILiveIDieILiveAgain,2,Tue Jun 16 03:20:18 2015 UTC,"I was probably around 10 when Jurassic Park came out and I remember my friend covering her eyes when the T-Rex was on screen, but I was riveted! Totally fearless.  I guess for a somewhat nervous kid who is skittish about loud noises or just easily spooked in general I could see how a film as loud as Fury Road might unsettle a kid. And the war boys might be scary to a really sensitive personality type? They are painted solid white and covered in scars and Nux does have his face carved and painted into the shape of a skull. Also, I can see how Slit would possibly be scary to a child. His face with the cuts and strange staples (?) holding it together is not pleasant, whatsoever. Ha.  But when I was little the only things I can remember really scaring me were horror movies about ghosts. I did not like ghosts, but the way things looked never bothered me. I even loved The Cryptkeeper when I was younger; the only thing about him that I couldn't cope with was his laugh. Whenever he laughed in the intro I would cover my ears."

And I'm not even that sensitive."

MadMax,39z3ly,Derpatologist_7,3,Tue Jun 16 14:13:18 2015 UTC,Miller had free reign to direct the movie he wanted to direct and he probably wasn't thinking of ratings at all. So it's not so much he was making an R rated movie and more about how he wasn't making a PG-13 movie.
MadMax,39z3ly,MinimusNadir,2,Tue Jun 16 12:28:28 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure it rated M15+ here in Australia and I also don't see a reason for an R18 rating. I thought it was pretty mild or rather nor gratuitous. Poky nips were great but not R rated worthy.
MadMax,39z3ly,ClockworkLunatic,2,Tue Jun 16 05:51:57 2015 UTC,I think that doing the c-section and just plopping the fetus down is probably a big part of it.
MadMax,39z3ly,Turbofurball,2,Tue Jun 16 06:30:04 2015 UTC,"In Australia, some american 'R' films are only rated 'M,' which is also sometimes like a PG-13. Here, it's rated MA, for 'Strong violence and Post-apocalyptic themes,' so I guess it might have somehting to do with that? I mean, some of those kills are just a wee bit brutal and confronting (Immortan Joe's whole face-ripping thing comes to mind) but honestly, if you think it's fine for your sis, take her. Just check with your parents first, since your know - they're parents."
MadMax,39z3ly,Turbofurball,3,Tue Jun 16 07:55:43 2015 UTC,"Well, a guy gets shot in the face with crossbow bolts then commits suicide ... that's just a teensy bit violent."

I think it wouldn't hurt the film if they did make it as gritty and violent as the first two, but the fact that it didn't make it into a family movie (as Beyond Thunderdome could have turned into) did make me proud to be a huge fan of the whole series as it can be appropriate for more ages and not lose it's vibe."

MadMax,3a03sx,Dr__Apocalypse,2,Tue Jun 16 15:06:45 2015 UTC,"I read it as subconscious rather than supernatural. It develops along with the character. In the opening sequences, the flashbacks/visions get in his way as he's trying to escape the warboys. Later in the film, it prompts courses of action that are in his favor, and actually defends him from a threat. He might always have this stuff in his head, but it's integrating and becoming a useful part of him."

Really glad they decided to go with that if so.   Edit. There's a shot in here showing Max throwing a tank of gas that's been lit molotov cocktail style. I'm thinking he did something similar to the Bullet Farmer when he walked off screen during the night scene, maybe in a more elaborate way, but a similar move. Suppose it would be difficult to get the ammo and a boot and the wheel after blowing it up, but an interesting thought nonetheless."
MadMax,39z90e,Scythe42,4,Tue Jun 16 00:07:12 2015 UTC,"Dane Grant was only briefly Max's stunt double. It was the very end of pre-production when Dayna was cast as Duriosa's stunt double, and Dane was ""Max"" while they were blocking that first tanker fight. The production was having a hard time finding Tom Hardy's double, and Dayna knew Jacob Tomuri from the NZ stunties, and showed them his picture. He bears an errie resemblance to Tom Hardy, and he was cast as Max's official double, and Dane wound up in the film as one of the War Boyz.  Today, when you ask Dayna what she got out of making Fury Road, she says, ""I got the best souviner of all, I brought home a War Boy! :)""   ..I just imagine her turning to everyone who looks at her wierd for that and saying, ""....Oh come on. You all wish you could bag a War Boy."" And everyone shaking their heads in shame because it's true."
MadMax,39z90e,IdiotsLantern,2,Tue Jun 16 05:20:28 2015 UTC,"I would rather be a war boy than a stunt double anyway, so I think he ended up with the better deal in the end.  Oh, and he got a wife and son, too, I guess that's good also."

You say it's based off a Diablo, yet that body is much more like a Countach That's a very tiny V8 to fit in that location (regardless if Countach or Diablo) Neither Countach or DIablo have doors that open like that   All that said, it's not like half the vehicles in Fury Road had much resemblance to their vehicle of origin either... :)  [edit: fixed list formatting]"

You've probably seen this already, but this is as good as I can find: https://turntherightcorner.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/mad-max-fury-road-screenshot-josh-helman-slit-1.jpg  This isn't great, either, but you can kind of see one of them clearly over Slit's left shoulder (our right): https://turntherightcorner.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/mad-max-fury-road-screenshot-josh-helman-slit-2.jpg?w=1024  Not good either: https://turntherightcorner.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/mad-max-fury-road-screenshot-josh-helman-slit-4.jpg  All I can really tell from these is that they seem to be a dark stick (duh!) with leather (?) wrapped around the top and the ends left trailing in sort of ribbons and that the explosive part at the top is shaped kind of like a lantern (six-sided?

About how bizarre it is that Hoult would be in both Mad Max and an obvious rip-off of Mad Max, but I watched the trailer and it actually doesn't look like it's ripping off Max, at all. Apart from the fact that they chose a name clearly meant to grab the attention of Fury Road fans.  The film is called 'The Young Ones' in the US and the title for the UK release is 'Bad Land: Road to Fury' because we used to have a TV show called The Young Ones here once upon a time and I guess there was concern people would get them confused somehow.  One of my co-workers ended up watching this and he said that it's pretty good. It's a drama and absolutely nothing like Mad Max. He said that it's brought down a lot by the association between not only the same actor, but the similar titles since if it they had just gone with a completely unrelated title (like they did with the US release) no one would have tried to make any real connections between it and MM."

Edit: Also, what a lame way to describe her looks. ""She doesn't look like a dude!"" No fucking shit. Plus I'm pretty sure she shaved her head just because ALL Joe's War Boys and soldiers had shaved heads. It wasn't because she wanted to look fierce. It was just practical."
MadMax,39tbi6,ILiveIDieILiveAgain,3,Sun Jun 14 16:52:57 2015 UTC,"I remember seeing a review of this movie, where this guy just exclaimed, ""Shave off her hair, cover her in dirt and motor oil, and she's STILL one of the most beautiful women who's ever lived. You just cannot lampshade that.""  I also saw an interview with Nick Holt where he remembered times where he'd be in the make-up chair (he learned to knit to pass the time) and he'd see Charlize come in, grab a pot of black grease paint, smear it on her head, and then walk out again. And Nick couldn't do anything except sit there and think, ""I've been here for an hour and a half..."""
MadMax,39tbi6,IdiotsLantern,4,Sun Jun 14 21:25:52 2015 UTC,"Supposedly Charlize and George went back and forth for a long time talking about what they were going to do about Furiosa's hair. There are early concepts from before Charlize were cast that showed Furiosa with dreadlocks, or a mohawk. They tried a lot of looks for her, but none seemed right.   Then Charlize called him and said, ""I think I just have to shave my head. I thought I should tell you before I did it."" And there was a pause and then a deep exhale. Because it just seemed so right after she said it. Why would Furiosa bother with hair? She doesn't have time to braid dreadlocks or maintain a mohawk or anything like that. She's got actual important shit to do.   She didn't find out until later that he had certain reservations about the shape of her head. But he never voiced them to her. Looking at the final result, it's hard to imagine Furiosa any other way."
MadMax,39tbi6,IdiotsLantern,3,Mon Jun 15 07:20:14 2015 UTC,"No doubt. The point is that she's a woman but she's an elite warrior, not a breeder hence utilitarian and practical. All the Imperators wear grease on their foreheads, its status. This is just badly written."

MadMax,39tbi6,ILiveIDieILiveAgain,9,Sun Jun 14 17:14:21 2015 UTC,There was nothing feminist in that description of Furiosa. Quite the opposite.
MadMax,39tbi6,Uejji,6,Sun Jun 14 17:30:50 2015 UTC,The feminism in the film stems from the absolute equality between Furiosa and Max.
MadMax,39tbi6,ThirstyOne,-7,Sun Jun 14 20:33:27 2015 UTC,"Correction: Feminism in the film stems from people who insist on dragging their gender-bias-butthurt with them to the movies. It is not the point of the film, it's not even the subject matter. Furiosa isn't motivated by feminism, she's motivated by revenge, and Charlize Theron said as much in one of the interviews for the film. Not one of the other characters, including Immortan Joe, so much as bats an eye at the fact that Furiosa is an imperator, they all recognize her for her strength and her abilities, not her sex.   People in the wasteland after the world has gone to shit have better things to worry about than gender-roles. Most of them are probably more busy just staying alive. Given all the work that goes into that I'd imagine that the gender roles and behaviors of contemporary western society are extremely impractical after the apocalypse. You're either strong or you're weak. You're either a survivor, or you're dead.  Miller spent years developing a complex set of characters, each with their own motivations, personality, history, etc. Trying to superimpose some feminist agenda on top of that detracts from the viewing experience and reduces the film to just that aspect. It's like going to see an art gallery and only focusing on the red bits in all the paintings."
MadMax,39tbi6,Uejji,4,Mon Jun 15 04:34:26 2015 UTC,"That's the point, don't you see?  The movie has a strong feminist message strictly because it doesn't make a point, positive or negative, about Furiosa's gender.  She is Max's equal without having to prove herself to be ""one of the guys,"" and Max defers to her judgment on several occasions without it being a thing, without any undertones of emasculation or an on-the-nose message about women being good leaders, too.  This is the relationship between men and women that feminism has always strove for -- where nobody cares about a person's gender, just who they are as a person."
MadMax,39tbi6,ILiveIDieILiveAgain,5,Mon Jun 15 04:52:30 2015 UTC,"Not one of the other characters, including Immortan Joe, so much as bats an eye at the fact that Furiosa is an imperator, they all recognize her for her strength and her abilities, not her sex.   And you just explained the feminist aspect yourself! That is what feminism in is movie means, believe it or not.   We obviously agree. Sex shouldn't matter. We're all people here. So it makes me wonder: if gender doesn't matter - why are people so bothered that someone might call FR feminist? Feminism doesn't take anything away from the film. It's still an epic movie no matter what."
MadMax,39tbi6,ThirstyOne,-4,Mon Jun 15 05:23:38 2015 UTC,"That's not feminism, that's gender equality. Or what the denizens of the wasteland would simply consider practical. A utilitarianism born of a survival need in a world that's gone to shit does not make the movie 'feminist', no more than the previous 3 Mad-Max films were 'masculinist' because of a strong male lead.  Let me pose the question from the opposite direction: If a movie is feminist because a female character has as strong lead role, then are movies with a strong male lead masculinist? Let's take Schindler's list for example: Strong male lead saves a bunch of people from the death camps in Nazi Germany. I doubt many male viewers walked out of the theater thinking ""Wow, I feel so empowered as a man because of the strong male lead"", that would be ridiculous and completely ignoring the point of the film.  Fury Road is meant to be a triumph of good over evil, civilization over barbarity, not a gender message. What about the movie's message about the evils of slavery? What about the movie's message about the futility of war and the death-cults it fosters? What about the movie's subtle environmental message? The message about peak oil? All the things that Furiosa fights against are evil in and of themselves, not because she's a woman.   The beauty of Fury Road is that Furiosa's role could have been equally played by a CGI mutant kangaroo, and the message of the movie wouldn't have changed, and it certainly wouldn't have made it 'marsupialist'."
MadMax,39tbi6,ILiveIDieILiveAgain,2,Mon Jun 15 13:27:08 2015 UTC,"That's not feminism, that's gender equality.   Feminism = gender equality.   You can call it whatever you want but veeery many people and I will still see FR as a gender equal / feminist movie. Just try to live with it, okay?"
MadMax,39tbi6,ThirstyOne,0,Mon Jun 15 13:37:45 2015 UTC,"While gender equality is one of the stated goals of the feminist movement, or at least it used to be, gender equality is not feminism. To prove it, I'll pose this question: Does the doctrine of feminism equally represent the rights, needs and struggles of men for gender equality? Specifically in terms of the struggle against domestic abuse, child custody rights, and all the other grievances that the feminist movement seeks to redress? If the answer to this question is no, then feminism does not promote gender equality, it promotes gender equality for women, specifically in the paradigm of a struggle against the systematic disenfranchisement of women based solely on their gender.   Promoting true equality on the other hand means you promote it for everyone, not just your own interest group. This of course begs the question of ""If you're promoting it for everyone, then why focus on gender in the first place?""  Don't get me wrong, historically women had been under-represented and in many countries they still are, and it's great that there's an interest group that shed's light on this, but when that struggle is narrowly defined to women alone, you're doing a disservice to the human rights or the other half of a planet.  I take the same issue with this as I do with people promoting gay-rights. I don't believe in gay-rights, I believe in human rights. Not because I'm gay or not, but because if a gay person's rights have been infringed upon, that's an infringement on everyone's personal liberty. In the same vein, I don't believe in 'women's rights', because that implies that women are somehow different and need special rights and privileges because of it, as opposed to everyone else. I fully recognize that certain groups are marginalized, and that a political struggle to address that is justified as a result, but the struggle for equality should be just that, a struggle for equality, not a struggle for representing a particular demographic in isolation.   Focusing narrowly on the 'rights' of one group or another just divides people in their struggle to seek a redress for grievances from the powers that be. I guarantee you'll get a lot more people, of all demographics, to attend a 'equal rights for all human' protest than an 'equal rights for amputee hawk-handlers with a lisp' protest.   Political recognition and social traction comes from making your political movement inclusive, not by focusing on what divides us. Otherwise it's just the same divide-and-conquer bullshit that politicians have used for centuries to keep people separated and struggling against each other."
MadMax,39tbi6,Uejji,3,Mon Jun 15 14:13:52 2015 UTC,"Yes.  Feminism seeks to dissolve all gender-specific roles, biases, prejudices and portrayals.  This includes, for instance:  -The notion that men are generally less suited than women to be parents.  -The tradition of Selective Service being a male-only requirement.  -The view that men who are victims of domestic violence are weak.  -The idea that men who make less money than their partners are reneging their responsibility as breadwinner.  -Etc."

The detail allows the story to be so much more visual and little details help fill in what is established. Many franchises like Fast & Furious make their plots way too complicated to be enjoyed, at least to me. I get taken out of the action. I think losing complicated side-plots and allowing the smaller details tell the story about the characters keeps the film so much more focused."

Because that was what the twitter account that turned out to be a fake said, and I've not found a reference to that title that isn't an echo of that tweet.  Personally, I hope only Max carries over to the next movie. I don't care if it's set before or after Fury Road, but a prequel will make no sense (since it's clear this is the first that Max meets Furiosa), whilst a sequel I'm not interested in, any more than I was interested in knowing details about the Great Northern Tribe from the end of MM2."

That's no garantee though that those films will ever be made. Tom Hardy will definitely keep the title role (and probably the blood bag tattoo as well, as a reference to past events), but if the next film was in obvious continuity with this one, it'd be a first for the series.   Still, George says he ""isn't done""  with these characters.

Best I can find are references like this (http://screencrush.com/charlize-theronmad-max-movies/ ), which say it's unclear what her contract has remaining."
MadMax,39szms,nemothorx,1 point,Sun Jun 14 22:58:21 2015 UTC,"True, but sources like that are from before the film broke 100mil at the box office and has taken in 300+mil worldwide. It's also Rotten Tomatoes best reviewed film of the year at 98% fresh. It's expected to make even more money off of VOD and Blu-Ray once it leaves theaters.  We know it was a difficult shoot, and George's free-wheeling style meant a lot of frustration on set. Tom Hardy has apologized for this, saying he can't argue with the finished film, and saying things that sound a lot like, ""George, I'll never doubt you again."" We don't know if Charlize feels the same, but with Furiosa being called the best thing to happen to women in film since Sarah Conner, NOT coming back if George wants her is going to be hard for Charlize, even if it just ends up being a cameo."
MadMax,39szms,Derpatologist_7,2,Mon Jun 15 01:55:13 2015 UTC,"oh yeah, if George wants Charlize back, it'd be tough to say no. If he wants her back for the same character (which wouldn't even be a question in any other franchise!), even tougher yet.  I was really only after a cite for ""all the leads of this film have signed contracts for three more films"" (especially in relation to Charlize)"

MadMax,39szms,nemothorx,1 point,Mon Jun 15 09:40:44 2015 UTC,"The apology   “I owe George an apology for being so myopic. . . . That was my first thought.... The most frustrating thing for me or the hardest part [of filming] was trying to know what George wanted me to do at any given minute on a minute-by-minute basis, so I could fully [execute] his vision ... But because he was orchestrating such a huge vehicle literally in so many departments, and because his signature is on every single detail and because all of the [parts] in the vehicle are just moving, there is just motion. I have to apologize to you because I got frustrated and there is no way that George could have explained what he conceived in the sand while we were out there [filming]. And because of the due diligence that was required to make everything safe and to make everything that was incredibly complex so simple—which is what I saw—which is a relentless barrage of complexities simplified in a fairly linear story . . . I knew [Miller] was brilliant, but I didn’t know how brilliant until I saw it.”   Charlize elaborated here    There were times when I was like, ‘George! What are we doing?!’ We would show up with no scene numbers — we couldn’t even have a call sheet. And you look around and go, ‘What the fuck is going on?!’ [...] There’s part of me that’s like, ‘No fucking way will I ever do that [again]."
MadMax,39szms,gamer961,5,Mon Jun 15 16:36:30 2015 UTC,"The MM films don't re-visit the same places or people and in a way I would like to see that continue with the next film being totally unrelated, BUT I am also extremely attached to nearly everyone in Fury Road and would love to see more of Furiosa and the wives (and if it's a prequel Nux, Splendid and Joe) but I would think that this would need to be some kind of spin-off that doesn't involve Max. Not sure if it would work or not."
MadMax,39szms,nemothorx,2,Sun Jun 14 19:17:41 2015 UTC,"Oh, cos I just remembered: There is also the upcoming Mad Max game, which if memory serves, is also set prior to the events of Fury Road!"
MadMax,39szms,sombray,3,Sun Jun 14 15:09:02 2015 UTC,"Mad Max doesn't have a specific timeline for Max.  Miller describes it all as these tall tales told, and although there's some feeling of continuation throughout the movies, the timeline actually doesn't really exist.  The game is centered around Max, meaning that it may be ""kind of"" before the events of Fury Road, but it still won't be a direct prequel."
MadMax,39szms,nemothorx,2,Sun Jun 14 15:18:19 2015 UTC,"given that it uses locations explicitly named in Fury Road, that connects it more solidly to FR than any connection between any two movies, none of which share or even mention location similarities.  But you're right in that it's a standalone unrelated story, rather than a prequel/setup story."
MadMax,39szms,nemothorx,2,Sun Jun 14 15:46:48 2015 UTC,That could be a reason why his interceptor is torn to shit in the first shot of FR. He gets it again after the events of the game and leaves the Magnum Opus to Chum.

MadMax,39rh84,CharlieHarvey,8,Sun Jun 14 01:12:03 2015 UTC,"maybe Max uses it to repair vacuum lines on the V8 Interceptor or for siphoning gasoline from wrecked vehicles  We have seen him in MM2 use what ever he could to save the fuel in the opening scene ; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLO7IWyj4Kk  Starts at 07:15 of 1:50:00 on this link. In this scene Max has a green gas can and a clear tube, it looks as if he is going the siphon gas from the wreckage, but does not have to cause it is leaking on to the road. he sound the rigs tanks , seem to be empty. Max has some serious road warrior skills he has honed in the years of wandering the waste."
MadMax,39rh84,Volts-ohms-amps,4,Sun Jun 14 01:52:48 2015 UTC,"Well, the tube he has in Road Warrior for siphoning is much more suited to the job, but beggars can't be choosers, so good point! This makes sense too.  You're the second person to point out that the tube mightn't have had anything to do with blood when Max was using it before being captured by the war boys and I can't believe that it hadn't crossed my mind."

MadMax,39rh84,Cancerslug,3,Sun Jun 14 01:27:29 2015 UTC,"According to a behind the scenes I read, when the Costume Designer was putting together Max's look, she deliberately avoided any actual throwbacks to Max's previous costumes...With the exception of the jacket, which was based on Mel Gibson's jacket from Road Warrior, which had turned up yellowed and stiff in a warehouse somewhere. But the rest of the outfit was all new.  When Tom Hardy showed up to look at sketches and talk about the costume, he actually had a lot of opinions about Max's first pre-capture look...the one that gets immediately taken away from him. The idea was that Max starts the movie with all of this stuff, and then looses it, and then gets it back (in a sort of way) at the end. So he has a latex hose at the start because he'll have one at the end, and it will be extremely important to how the movie turns out.   Notice that it's not the same hose. It's thicker and more opaque. It's also clipped to the opposite shoulder then his blood bag hose was. Whatever it was used for, it probably wasn't transfusions."

MadMax,39rgu8,4estGimp,2,Mon Jun 15 01:28:04 2015 UTC,"From an article on the double blown GTO, ""To be realistic, this 474 can get all the air it will ever need from the single blower...<snip>...Bill is looking for 9-second timeslips with the new tighter converter, but he also admits that the second blower, while it looks killer on the street, will probably be more of detriment to that goal than a help due to the amount of horsepower it takes to drive it, amount of heat it will generate while delivering air to the blower beneath it and the engine despite the intercooler, and the fact that the single 8-71 is large enough to feed the engine anyway. He also realizes that should the second blower offer a performance benefit, the reward will probably cause a hasty evacuation of the contents of the short-block.  For those reasons, Bill is planning on yanking the 6-71 blower and heading back to the track with the single 8-71 13-percent overdriven to make some more passes with increased boost.""  So that explains that the 2nd blower is cosmetic and a detriment to performance.  As for turbos, yes there are nice, practical twin setups.  They just don't also feed into superchargers.  The turbo/supercharged camaro is again just a show car."
MadMax,39rgu8,Broken_Goat,3,Tue Jun 16 09:00:41 2015 UTC,"Dude....two days ago in a response to /u/Turbofurball I clearly said; ""Yeah theres other better ways to go about it...they just dont have the sheer audacity that twin blowers have. Haha""   Turbos can and do feed into superchargers, and they can do it the other way around too.   From Wikipedia    The concept of twincharging was first used by Lancia in 1985 on the Lancia Delta S4 Group B rally car and its street legal counterpart, the Delta S4 Stradale. The idea was also successfully adapted to production road cars by Nissan, in their March Super Turbo.[1] Additionally, multiple companies have produced aftermarket twincharger kits for cars like the Subaru Impreza WRX, Mini Cooper S, Ford Mustang, Toyota MR2.  The Volkswagen 1.4 TSI is a 1400 cc engine – utilised by numerous automobiles of the VW Group – that sees use of both a turbocharger and a supercharger, and is available with eight power ratings"""

They worship these machines; the largest vehicle in their war party has no military function, it is entirely dedicated to rock'n'roll. Look at any Catholic cathedral; opulent overkill everywhere.

Their short exchange of stares was hilarious.  Another one - when Furiosa puts the shotgun to Max's head, his eyes go so wide and then squint when gun misfires."
MadMax,39mf4r,Torley_,1 point,Sat Jun 13 06:31:06 2015 UTC,hehe and then she smacks Max with her stub just before going at him with the bolt cutters. Love it.
MadMax,39mf4r,MrSiltStrider,3,Sat Jun 13 15:30:48 2015 UTC,"The part where Rictus lifts up the war rig's supercharger, and it cuts to a shot of Nux looking up into the camera."
MadMax,39mf4r,bryanlharris,2,Sat Jun 13 17:32:34 2015 UTC,"""Witness...Me."" How many feels? Too many."
MadMax,39muuz,HotterRod,4,Fri Jun 12 21:29:58 2015 UTC,"Liked everything about the boltcutters, the stuff about Max's muzzle seemed to kind of go off the deepend. But any good theory should give you just a little bit more than you need."
MadMax,39muuz,JeffersonHelicarrier,9,Sat Jun 13 00:53:58 2015 UTC,"There are certainly feminist concepts in the film, but people tend to go too far when asserting that the entire film is a symbol for feminism. As a  whole it's just a great action flick."
MadMax,39muuz,IrrelevantLeprechaun,8,Sat Jun 13 03:55:34 2015 UTC,"I agree. I think it is a step in the right direction for what feminism wants to come out of movies, which a part of that is having female characters with agency. Imperator Furiosa had a ton of fucking agency."
MadMax,39muuz,astronomoaustin,5,Sat Jun 13 06:46:19 2015 UTC,"Look at the beating Joss Whedon took over Ultron, where he upped the number of female Avengers to...two. And all the Black Widow think pieces about how shafted Marvel's women are getting, and all I can think is, ""you know, if Black Widow wasn't the only woman around for miles, people wouldn't care so much if she hooks up with Bruce Banner or not."" When there's just one woman, then she has to be all women, and it's not fair to the character. The obvious solution (""well, then have more then one woman, have a whole range of women of different ages and abilities who can free each other up to have different storylines"") doesn't seem to have occurred to anyone yet...   Imagine if instead of the five Wives, we had one wife, and it was Angharad, and Furiosa was a male, and he and Angharad were running away from Joe because they were in love and going to be free in his green place homeland. That change alone would alter a lot of the film's subtext from ""rebelling against being treated like objects"" to ""risking it all for love."" Along the way they meet Max, they help each-other, the homeland's gone now, they decide to return to the Citadel and take it for themselves. It'd be a perfectly functional action movie plot, but nothing we haven't seen before. I think what George did was much more interesting."
MadMax,39muuz,IdiotsLantern,5,Sun Jun 14 14:23:33 2015 UTC,"Often, stories of escape will hinge on stealing keys, or learning passwords or combinations, or in some other way relying on the resources and power of the captor to get free. The prevalence of the plot point wherein a woman must seduce her enemy is born out of this, at least in part. At best, it’s the idea that you can outsmart even the enemy you cannot overpower. At worst, however, it demands that a woman a) play by the rules of her oppressor and b) keep him around as long as possible. You mustn’t kill him too soon or run too far, because you’re going to need him. He holds the power and the secret of your freedom, and you have to get it from him carefully.   My favorite part of that article."
MadMax,39o6fp,tilicentshit,7,Sat Jun 13 04:19:01 2015 UTC,"My first thought was that she was cutting as a way to deal with the trauma of being a sex slave. Not necessarily defiance, just a coping mechanism in a horrible world without therapists."
MadMax,39o6fp,uponthecityofzephon,6,Sat Jun 13 16:40:55 2015 UTC,"Confirmed by the actress.   ""All of us had the Immortan Joe's branding on the back of our necks. And I had scars all over my arm, representation of my character's conflict. I decided early on in the rehearsal period and in the period where we discovered who our characters were that my character's torment was taken out through cutting herself."""
MadMax,39o6fp,hvelsveg_himins,1 point,Mon Jun 15 01:01:20 2015 UTC,Oh neat thanks
MadMax,39o6fp,leonryan,1 point,Mon Jun 15 02:48:42 2015 UTC,yeah could be!
MadMax,39o6fp,anassakata,5,Sun Jun 14 02:32:22 2015 UTC,that furiosa theory is bullshit.  how does one less arm make her a less viable breeder?  her genes remain unchanged and it just makes it harder to defend herself from him.  it's a stupid premise.
MadMax,39o6fp,ItsAmerico,3,Sat Jun 13 05:10:37 2015 UTC,"Eh, I can kind of see it. Like yes, half the point is that the wives are good breeders, but it's also about them being literal treasures--living a life of luxury, wearing soft fabrics, showering all the time. They are important aesthetically as much as genetically."
MadMax,39o6fp,CharlieHarvey,2,Sat Jun 13 05:43:46 2015 UTC,"That's just because they are pampered and taken care of, because they are insanely valuable. I mean they are basically sex slaves... Joe isn't an idiot. He tries to pamper them as much as he can to wash over the fact that they are, well, sex slaves."
MadMax,39o6fp,ItsAmerico,2,Sat Jun 13 08:10:47 2015 UTC,I agree with you. I can't see her cutting her own arm off for such a flippant reason. The chance of dying of infection in a place like the MM universe would be enormous and also having only one arm in a place as violent as this would be a serious handicap.
MadMax,39o6fp,skonen_blades,1 point,Sun Jun 14 00:40:22 2015 UTC,I don't know man it was someone elses theory sounds pretty likely to me though like why are none of his wives bad looking? there has to also be unattractive girls who are real healthy why wouldn't he choose them to have his kids unless he cared about his breeders appearance at least a little? maybe he shows them off and would be embarrassed if one wasn't perfect with all her limbs and shit. Chill its just a theory
MadMax,39o6fp,CharlieHarvey,1 point,Sat Jun 13 05:58:57 2015 UTC,"Because it's a Hollywood movie. There is NOTHING to support that Furiosa is anything intimate to Joe, and the movie never suggests anything of the sort. If anything it goes against it. The art book for the film goes into the backstory / bio for the Wives and states they aren't very close to Furiosa (you would think they would be if she had that type of tie to Joe) and they simply respect her and what she is going to do with them. They aren't friends though."
MadMax,39o6fp,LogicalTimber,0,Sat Jun 13 08:13:47 2015 UTC,Again. Just a theory. Thanks for the background though
MadMax,39o6fp,bryanlharris,2,Sat Jun 13 09:06:41 2015 UTC,"I also disagree that Furiosa cut her own arm off.  I think it was either war damage, punishment, or a birth defect.  However, I'm curious about Splendid's scars.  They're super light but they look like razor cuts.  I don't think she did them to herself.  They're also all in one grouping so it almost looked like she slid face-first over something and got scarred up. Again, I'd go with punishment scars rather that self-inflicted."
MadMax,39mnoh,IdiotsLantern,3,Fri Jun 12 20:37:57 2015 UTC,that's not insight.  we saw him break free.  we also saw him get recaptured.
MadMax,39mnoh,leonryan,5,Sat Jun 13 04:00:23 2015 UTC,"We never saw him get branded, and we have no shots of any sort of brand on his neck, despite numerous shots of the back of his head.   Hence the debate whether he was branded or not."
MadMax,39mnoh,leonryan,2,Sat Jun 13 07:58:31 2015 UTC,"yeah i know, and i'm not willing to say one way or the other if he was.  i'm just saying her statement means nothing."
MadMax,39mnoh,leonryan,1 point,Sat Jun 13 08:29:01 2015 UTC,"It's not nothing, because she was on-set almost every day of the shoot and she confirmed that as far as she was told, his character never received a brand, so the actor (whoever it was that day) never wore one. Don't bother going through the film looking for Max's brand, because you won't see it.  So either it's there and it's someplace we never see (which would mean it was moved somewhere besides his neck for some reason), or it's not there because it's not there.  As far as she knows, it was never there. That's pretty conclusive in my mind."
MadMax,39mnoh,leonryan,2,Sat Jun 13 09:00:06 2015 UTC,"all she confirmed was what we already knew.  that he broke loose when they tried to brand him.  she didn't say anything about him breaking loose a second time, or even that he was recaptured.  it may well be true that they didn't do it, but her tweet is not sufficient to make that call."
MadMax,39mnoh,teehoffff,1 point,Sat Jun 13 10:36:52 2015 UTC,"she confirmed he never wore the make-up, and this was probably the reason she was given why not.   Why Max wasn't branded after he was recaptured would be a question for George, but as far as she knows considering all the time she spent around the people playing Max (Tom, Jakob Tomuri, the other stunt men who occasionally played Max), nobody was wearing the brand.   Maybe she's got this wrong, but I don't know why she would. It's not her ""reasoning"" we are questioning here, it's just what she saw."
MadMax,39mnoh,Osmodius,1 point,Sat Jun 13 10:49:53 2015 UTC,where did she say he never wore the makeup?  you posted her tweet as evidence but it's not evidence of anything.  if you know something else about it you haven't done anything to back it up.
MadMax,39mnoh,CharlieHarvey,1 point,Sat Jun 13 11:27:57 2015 UTC,"She'd know if he ever wore the make-up. She says he didn't.   Again, go through the movie looking for footage of his brand, but you won't find it because he didn't have one."
MadMax,39mnoh,Derpatologist_7,4,Sat Jun 13 20:23:22 2015 UTC,"Her reasoning is flawed. He was recaptured after breaking free. It stands to reason that, unless they forgot or changed their minds, they would have branded him after bringing him back."
MadMax,39mnoh,teehoffff,4,Fri Jun 12 21:18:56 2015 UTC,"""Well guys, he did break free the first time we tried to brand him. Maybe he doesn't want to be branded after all?""    ""Gosh you're right, we didn't even ask him! Call it off, boys""."
MadMax,39mnoh,teehoffff,2,Sat Jun 13 01:58:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah. They almost certainly would have branded him upon dragging him back, unless having finished the tattoo already they just threw him in a cage and said they would do it later and then didn't get around to it before he escapes..."
MadMax,39mnoh,TweetPoster,4,Fri Jun 12 22:27:38 2015 UTC,Absolutely. I can't believe that didn't occur to her.
MadMax,39mnoh,MunchlaxWasTaken,2,Fri Jun 12 21:28:34 2015 UTC,"That's what I thought, but Dayna Grant is Furiosa's stunt double and she spent a long time hanging out in cars and rolling in the dirt with Tom Hardy, Jacob Tomeri, and the other stunties called on to play Max. If she says he didn't have a brand, I believe her. She'd have been in a position to know if he wore the make-up or not (she always wore it herself). He didn't, so Max wasn't branded. Why not? Don't know, but that's how it went."
MadMax,39mnoh,bryanlharris,4,Fri Jun 12 22:53:08 2015 UTC,Just because Hardy didn't have the brand makeup applied doesn't mean it didn't happen to Max. I doubt he wore the tattoo they gave him after he got his shirt and jacket either.
MadMax,39llp0,spider_cereal,1 point,Fri Jun 12 16:19:55 2015 UTC,That's cool. Sort of looks like Klaus Kinski though.  http://i.imgur.com/5UNKQDf.jpg
MadMax,39l5dz,BotBoyFM,23,Fri Jun 12 14:24:20 2015 UTC,Can't we all just get BEYOND Thunderdome already?
MadMax,39l5dz,insomniabob,11,Fri Jun 12 14:59:09 2015 UTC,HEYOOOOO!
MadMax,39l5dz,skonen_blades,0,Fri Jun 12 15:43:29 2015 UTC,Rimshot!
MadMax,39l5dz,ballweiner,11,Sat Jun 13 20:58:21 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I absolutely loved it, but I think it would have been better if they switched the first half of the movie with the second half. I found myself a bit bored after Max was gulaged out of Bartertown because the tribal kid arc felt like it could have been its own movie."
MadMax,39l5dz,Ricks_Right_Hand,6,Fri Jun 12 15:11:19 2015 UTC,"Well originally Miller was considering making a film which was half ""Lord of the Flies"" and half an adaptational of ""Riddley Walker"", then he decided to crowbar it into a MM film."
MadMax,39l5dz,SpecsaversGaza,4,Fri Jun 12 15:36:16 2015 UTC,"It's also worth noting that Miller didn't direct all of Thunderdome. Because his friend died location scouting he sort of fell out of it, and only directed the action segments. Other than the last chase and presumably the Thunderdome scene, I'm not sure which parts he directed."
MadMax,39l5dz,thatguywiththe______,2,Fri Jun 12 21:02:40 2015 UTC,"You can tell in that final chase, too - movie is all bopping along, mid-80s Hollywood, then all these crazy vehicles roar out into the desert, center-framed and wrecking into each other."
MadMax,39l5dz,Retlaw83,2,Sat Jun 13 16:48:43 2015 UTC,"I remember watching it, when the chase starts there's this sweeping aerial shot similar to the first shot in the movie, and I just got so pumped from that shot because I knew that now we're getting started."
MadMax,39l5dz,thatguywiththe______,9,Sat Jun 13 19:29:55 2015 UTC,"I'm not a huge fan of it, and it is definitely my least favorite Mad Max (1 Fury Road; 2 Road Warrior; 3 Mad Max; 4 Beyond Thunderdome). But I am definitely greatful for the film. Reason being, I think that the main reason Fury Road was so amazing is because Miller had 30 years of feedback from the first 3 films to figure out what worked well and what didn't; it helps that the first 3 were pretty different from each other, it gives Miller a wide range of content from which to draw upon. And Miller took everything from the first 3 movies that worked (mostly from Road Warrior it seems), and then some, and put it all in one film with 30-years-better technology and stunts and a huge budget. I freaking love Fury Road, it is THE PERFECT Mad Max film."
MadMax,39l5dz,The_Nez,7,Fri Jun 12 19:44:21 2015 UTC,"I watched all three in preparation for Fury Road as well and I'll tell you, I had zero recollection of there being kids in the movie at all.  I was like ""What the heck is going on?"" the whole weird broken English and all the kids.  I quite enjoyed it but I must have been bored by it when I originally saw the film back when it came out because I had no memory of any it.  I only remembered the Tina Turner and Bartertown parts as well as the final chase scene but all that's only like a third of the movie.  And just the opening credits from Thunderdome were like NINETEEEN EIGHTYYYYY SEVEEENNN!!!! which I also wasn't prepared for.  It sure has dated badly.  Unlike the second one.  Super interesting.  I love how all three movies are so different from each other."
MadMax,39l5dz,skonen_blades,5,Fri Jun 12 15:47:17 2015 UTC,"I love this movie but it  does lose pace when Max meets the kids. George Miller's friend died whilst scouting for locations for this movie in a plane crash and as a result I don't think George's heart was in this film. It's still really inventive and a visual feast. One of my favourite moments is when Max first goes up to Aunties cabin and he sees the guy playing the sax, reminding Max of his wife - sad yet a nice nod to the first film."
MadMax,39l5dz,buffcode01,2,Fri Jun 12 17:19:06 2015 UTC,"I've watched and rewatched these films most of my life, and I never put that together about the saxophone player."
MadMax,39l5dz,Original_Pig_Rig,2,Fri Jun 12 21:51:47 2015 UTC,I struck me when I watched them all in a row.  One of my favourite moments in all the films
MadMax,39l5dz,buffcode01,6,Sat Jun 13 13:45:42 2015 UTC,I feel that BTD is to Mad Max as Temple of Doom is to Indiana Jones
MadMax,39l5dz,Nicke1Eye,3,Fri Jun 12 21:30:15 2015 UTC,That's.....actually pretty true I guess
MadMax,39l5dz,littlejohnnyjewel,2,Fri Jun 12 22:00:55 2015 UTC,"I would say Return of the Jedi, to Star Wars IV."
MadMax,39l5dz,spider_cereal,5,Sat Jun 13 16:55:16 2015 UTC,My favorite out of the first three is the first one. For its time I thought it was excellent. They are all great in their own ways though.
MadMax,39l5dz,Goyims,4,Fri Jun 12 14:36:28 2015 UTC,"I enjoyed it decently. It's not my favorite and I wasn't a huge fan of the train scene, but besides that it's decent."
MadMax,39l5dz,nemothorx,7,Fri Jun 12 16:09:25 2015 UTC,"Agreed. It's the most balanced of the original trilogy - mixing action with pathos. Where The Road Warrior narrator tells us at the start that Max learnt to live again, we don't get to feel that. But in Thunderdome, that sense of beginning to care, comes across to me.   It's not a movie without it's flaws, but I nonetheless think it's pretty great.   It's nice to see another defender :)"
MadMax,39l5dz,Dr__Apocalypse,3,Fri Jun 12 14:32:46 2015 UTC,"Couldn't agree more, Its the balance that really seals the deal."
MadMax,39l5dz,EdgarsTeethAreDry,6,Fri Jun 12 18:15:39 2015 UTC,"Not really. Some people are maybe a tad harsh on it, but overall it's still not a very good movie, and it's by far the worst of the series. Countless potholes, unoriginality in some parts, overall cartoonish vibe, awful slapstick, etc. I would have no problem with more plot than action if the plot had been very good. I love the first one and it's probably the least action packed of all of them. Thunderdome could be a good family action film if it had committed to that, but I don't think it really did. There were too many parts that wanted to be darker than the children's film slapstick suggested it was."
MadMax,39l5dz,yeahwattupboi,3,Fri Jun 12 16:04:35 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's underrated at all. It has a 6.2 and 8 on IMDb, I don't think it deserves anymore and it's difficult to take 'underrated gem' seriously. I also think it's hard to believe the Thunderdome scene is THAT good, but I do think the fight scene in Fury Road after the storm is perfectly crafted and one of the best I've ever seen."
MadMax,39l5dz,palehorse864,3,Fri Jun 12 22:34:51 2015 UTC,"What was great about it were the little items and set pieces. Thunderdome of course, but things like the baseball mascot head. That's the kind of weirdness I really love about the series, and other series (such as Fallout) which have been inspired by the films. Any time something weirdly goofy is repurposed like that, I find it entertaining. The strange post apocalyptic set pieces, like thunderdome, and that giant human powered winch in Fury Road are also great."
MadMax,39l5dz,Gog_Noggler,5,Sat Jun 13 04:42:37 2015 UTC,"It's the worst, by far. But, it's still fun to watch if you're a fan of the series."
MadMax,39l5dz,gtfolmao,4,Fri Jun 12 16:38:35 2015 UTC,The Bartertown stuff wasn't bad but they totally lost me on the kids plot haha.

MadMax,39l5dz,pogue23,2,Fri Jun 12 21:57:40 2015 UTC,The first movie trailer I remember seeing was for Mad Max. I ended up seeing Road Warrior before Mad Max because no cable and my dad believed in the future of the betamax medium. Sigh. I'm just happy there was a third and finally a fourth.
MadMax,39l5dz,M3n747,2,Sat Jun 13 00:20:58 2015 UTC,It was actually my favorite of the original trilogy. I liked the kids in the oasis. I liked their story. I liked how fully formed their subculture was.
MadMax,39l5dz,Retlaw83,2,Sat Jun 13 12:44:13 2015 UTC,"I rated Thunderdome the highest of the first three films, although I find myself returning the the first two and not BT, which is kinda odd. To me, MM1 is a whole lot of nothing bookended by two great scenes and MM2 has a lot of potential that's painfully held back by a low budget and whatnot, whereas MM3 feels the most like a proper ""big"" film. And yet what sticks out to me the most are those great moments of MM1 and MM2."

MadMax,39kwy7,ZeTian,4,Fri Jun 12 13:36:03 2015 UTC,Why did the Interceptor have to crash AGAIN?!
MadMax,39kwy7,vulcanblight,3,Fri Jun 12 15:06:46 2015 UTC,I think because the vehicle is so iconic and has received so much screen time over the years the writers and directors felt it was unnecessary for it to be a center piece in the action.
MadMax,39kwy7,fwinzor,2,Fri Jun 12 15:33:10 2015 UTC,"I play Dungeons and Dragons and a very important lesson about making a story, is early on make your BBEG (Big Bad Evil Guy/main boss) do something early on that is personal.  for instance, the group just killed a monster terrorizing the local town, took awesome trophies from it, the lord of the land came to take the body, all there trophies, and charged them a tax for ""disturbing the peace"".  After that they HATED him, he could have brought upon a golden age of art and science, they'd still want to rip his eyes out  I think it is similar, early on they destroy something precious to makes (and honestly, to us) so we get a grudge against Joe early on."
MadMax,39kwy7,EasyGh0st,1 point,Sat Jun 13 01:24:43 2015 UTC,"If you think about it, the intercepter has got very little screen time. Last 10 minutes  of the first film, about 15 minutes at the start of the second film with the crash after about 1 minute in the middle and that's it. We need an awesome chase with the intercepter."

MadMax,39kwy7,Retlaw83,-1,Sat Jun 13 18:29:14 2015 UTC,It's a Ford Fairlane. The original Interceptor is a Ford Falcon.
MadMax,39kwy7,vulcanblight,1 point,Sat Jun 13 18:36:53 2015 UTC,Hmm. Might not have been able to get a real one due to the rarity.

MadMax,39kwy7,4estGimp,2,Sat Jun 13 23:53:06 2015 UTC,"The destruction of the interceptor showed the viciousness of the warlords and of scavenging in the wasteland.

MadMax,39id12,LostSoulsAlliance,1 point,Thu Jul 9 11:59:52 2015 UTC,ikr - Max is awesome throughout that whole sequence when he starts punching out the window in rage. xD
MadMax,39id12,CharlieHarvey,38,Thu Jul 9 12:02:11 2015 UTC,"I can't believe how much I loved it.  I went into it knowing nothing. I mean, I know about Mad Max, of course (I still have the original on VHS), but I'm not usually interested in reboots and remakes and I hadn't watched a single trailer or read a single review for this film.  I only went to see it on a lark because I needed something to go do with this guy who had asked me out and it was showing at the right time.  Going into it knowing nothing was the best ever. Blew my mind! I've seen it four times now."
MadMax,39id12,CharlieHarvey,12,Fri Jun 12 01:10:17 2015 UTC,"I avoided ALL trailers, previews, and anything to do with this since the very first trailer, so I went in really blind too. I was apprehensive and didn't have high hopes for it, but holy cow I loved it!!  Seen it seven times so far, and I want to see it one or two times before it leaves the theaters."
MadMax,39id12,dmasterdyne,6,Fri Jun 12 06:06:29 2015 UTC,"I've seen it four times and I think that I'm going to make that do as I live in a very rural, remote area and it's quite a drive to go see it and, unfortunately, none of my friends are into it at all, so I would need to go by myself and I hate going on long drives by myself.   I don't normally buy DVDs/BRs new, but this will obviously be an exception. It's been a really long time since I was this obsessed with a film and you guys are the only people I can ramble on about it, too, because everyone I know who saw it thought it was fantastic, but not fantastic enough to want to talk about!"
MadMax,39id12,fatty_fatshits,4,Fri Jun 12 12:09:24 2015 UTC,"I also have peers whom I don't feel comfortable enough to discuss the film with besides instantly becoming one of my favourites. I guess it feels strange because on the surface people expect it to be ""just another action movie"", so when you admire the action, show them the trailer or et cetera they get the impression that it's just a guy's movie; you need to take the extra mile to make them see what they're missing, so to speak. :p  It's a freaking crazy movie, but rarely has there been so much enjoyability and such character in an action film."
MadMax,39id12,JimmyDaGent,4,Fri Jun 12 23:18:05 2015 UTC,"Exactly. And most people don't tend to fixate on things the way I (apparently) do. Even the two co-workers I have who saw and said that they loved it aren't interested in talking about it in depth and don't remember most of the details or scenes that I mention. Or when I say something about a scene they just do that vague, 'Yeah. It was a great film,' thing and then change the subject.  I don't like to seem that I'm unhealthily obsessed, so I try not to bring it up to the same person more than once. Ha."
MadMax,39id12,FogSeeFrank,2,Fri Jun 12 23:38:17 2015 UTC,I think part of the reason is also because almost all the greatest moments fly by SO fast in the movie (why so many people are re-watching it so many times) that most people who saw it like one time have a lack of things to discuss besides calling it a masterpiece or really good.

MadMax,39id12,IrrelevantLeprechaun,18,Fri Jun 12 18:20:36 2015 UTC,Interesting.  The Godfather was the most recent movie in the top ten apart from Mad Max. That almost seems more impressive for some reason.
MadMax,39id12,LostSoulsAlliance,18,Thu Jun 11 23:49:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah, good catch. I guess that alone makes it very likely that Fury Road will be looked upon as an all-time classic in time like those other masterpieces.  Another thing I noticed is that a lot of the movies on that list have revolutionized the film industry the most, and I can definitely see Fury Road having heavy inspiration for future action cinema."
MadMax,39id12,Turbofurball,12,Fri Jun 12 00:01:27 2015 UTC,"Oh definitely, the only other recent  action movie in its league right now is John Wick. It really is something great to witness."
MadMax,39id12,leonryan,5,Fri Jun 12 02:35:12 2015 UTC,"I'd say Raid 2 over John Wick, even though I really enjoyed Wick. Just like Mad Max set a lot of bars higher in my eyes, I feel like Raid 2s' fight scenes were pretty awe-inspiring."

MadMax,39id12,Dat_Bass1,13,Fri Jun 12 17:44:22 2015 UTC,I find Rotten Tomatoes in general to give lower ratings compared to a lot of other reviewers. So this is quite the achievement.
MadMax,39id12,ProfBatman,10,Fri Jun 12 01:26:09 2015 UTC,"Agreed. It's a shame that Fury Road's rating is tanking on IMDb though by all the people criticizing its lack of story, meaning and depth (all things that I thought the film did very well in regardless, just told in unconventional ways). I think its highest spot was #22 there; now #38 and dropping. I'm probably exaggerating the film's quality a bit, but it was just that good."
MadMax,39id12,finnay1,10,Fri Jun 12 02:00:26 2015 UTC,"Sure it's the best action movie in decades, but in terms of plot I wouldn't put it on the same level as all the classic greats."
MadMax,39id12,Sullyville,8,Fri Jun 12 03:15:21 2015 UTC,"There's a lot there though and it's amazing how deep things are, especially for an action film. This is one instance where a lot of the story is in the details. I don't recall any action movie that had this much character development and especially where you actually care for a lot of the characters, even the war boys."
MadMax,39id12,loubric,7,Fri Jun 12 06:09:08 2015 UTC,"The plot is like 10 pieces of 1' long rope, compared to 1 10' long rope of a normal complex plot.  I mean, there's a story in there about a fricken boot."
MadMax,39id12,loubric,3,Fri Jun 12 08:31:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it doesn't have the greatest story ever, but the rest of the experience is so top notch that it's kinda excusable that the film is getting so much praise."
MadMax,39id12,maalbi,6,Fri Jun 12 03:19:31 2015 UTC,IMDB ratings are typically representative of a popcorn crowd rather than a filmschool crowd.

MadMax,39kxls,CharlieHarvey,3,Fri Jun 12 15:11:00 2015 UTC,I've seen different versions of Furiosa/Rosie mashups around as well but this is by far the best one.

MadMax,39kxls,ILiveIDieILiveAgain,-2,Fri Jun 12 15:32:15 2015 UTC,"I'm getting tired of seeing that ""We Can Do It!"" everywhere. First of all, I hate the thought behind it. As if women are never able to do it and you need a print to prove it. And secondly, it doesn't fit Furiosa. I can't see her posing like that, telling everyone that she can do it. Hells yeah she can do it, she doesn't need to tell us that. Pfft.   Why can't Furiosa have a normal print, instead of some ""I supposedly have a vagina and I can still do stuffs!"" crap?"
MadMax,39kxls,drevill,0,Fri Jun 12 17:14:49 2015 UTC,"I agree, the first time I saw the shirt I hadn't seen teh movie so I didn't think much of it. Now that I've seen the movie, her persona doesn't fit the design.   Although I still love how they drew her I'd prefer something different too."
MadMax,39lvca,Dr__Apocalypse,2,Fri Jun 12 17:24:16 2015 UTC,"I don't think that they have anything to do with the vuvalini (spelling?). I think they just moved into the land after the vuvalini were forced out.  I would think that if they were members of the vuvalini tribe more of a mention would have been made of them, particularly when they decide to go back to the Citadel, but they're never mentioned again and no one seems to care what happens to them.  I don't have any proof to back up my notion, but I think they're just another strange group of people subsisting however they can in the wastes."
MadMax,39lvca,CharlieHarvey,0,Sat Jun 13 01:04:28 2015 UTC,"Could go either way. If they were members of the Monthers who did stay behind, they might be considered ""deserters"" and not considered part of them any more."

MadMax,39lvca,skonen_blades,5,Fri Jun 12 17:32:01 2015 UTC,They mention 'the crows' once or twice but it's unclear if they're referring to the actual crows that we see after the Bullet Farmer gets blown up or if they're referring to the weird stilt walkers.  They're scavengers in the soured land of the green place but they're not fully defined every.  Maybe they're leftover from the green place and maybe they're just scavengers.  Stilts are good for marshes so maybe they've been there for a while.  Who knows?
MadMax,39lvca,M3n747,4,Fri Jun 12 19:04:42 2015 UTC,"Leaves a lot to the imagination, and that's not a bad thing. Damn I loved this movie."
MadMax,39lvca,KingofMadCows,3,Fri Jun 12 20:04:28 2015 UTC,"I think she meant the actual birds. At first I too thought that she referred to the stilt walkers, but it just doesn't seem to make any sense to call people of stilts ""crows""."

MadMax,39m7ag,Nyansaur,5,Fri Jun 12 18:43:36 2015 UTC,"Seems like there will be 4:  A series of Mad Max prequel stories from DC Entertainment's Vertigo Comics imprint kicks off Wednesday looking at the earlier days of Fury Road's prime players, beginning with the villainous overlord Immortan Joe (played by Hugh Keays-Byrne in the movie) and Nux (Nicholas Hoult), one of the Immortan's loyal War Boys.  An issue focusing on Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) and how she met the Immortan's brides, women chosen to bear a worthy male heir for the ruler, arrives June 17, and two chapters focusing on Max Rockatansky (Tom Hardy) and a hazardous trip to Gastown — and Thunderdome Plus — come out July 8 and August 5.

Fury Road: Starring Mad Maxeen, Nuxii, Immortan Joan, Furioso and the 'grooms'. I imagine everyone who insisted on dragging their gender-bias-butthurt into the movie theater with them would be singing a different tune, albeit just as loudly and obnoxiously."

MadMax,39g3k2,ZombeeAndroid,6,Fri Jun 12 00:45:43 2015 UTC,"That's an interesting questions. An emergency Orchiectomy would be pointless, since the testes couldn't survive separation from the body, no matter how hard Ricta Erecta (Played by the same actress that plays Brianne of Tarth) would have yelled that she 'could have had a baby sister, perfect in every way'.  I guess that's just one of those gender equality issues; If something can't be equal simply due to biology, how do we make it equitable?  Since we can't solve these problems on Reddit, I suggest we instead take it a level deeper and go full inception mode on this instead: Furioso is a flaming queen transporting the 'grooms', who are all dressed in drag, as they flee the oppression of the citadel where they're forced to take on masculine roles although they all identify as trans-gender. Instead of the war-rig they'd be driving a modified version of the bus from 'Priscilla, Queen of the desert', and to top it off we'll make the whole thing a musical, with the coma-doof warrior being the only one who has any spoken lines. Broadway, here we come!  Bonus: At the end credits scene we snap back to the original film, revealing that the entire thing was just a fantasy sequence in Furiosa's head after she takes some powerful hallucinogens to help her deal with the PTSD caused by years and years of everyone else in the citadel making repeated 'Do you need a hand?', 'Can you lend me a hand?', 'Hey, I hear you're pretty handy"", 'You're a handful' and other such puns. She then proceeds to cement her reign of terror over the citadel by 'limb-shaming' everyone who isn't an amputee or mutant."

MadMax,39g3k2,nemothorx,1 point,Fri Jun 12 07:06:51 2015 UTC,I like it. He's a much more enigmatic character and has that whole 'phantom of the opera' thing going for him.

MadMax,39gzme,teaqualizer,8,Thu Jun 11 17:39:01 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure that the tattoo will be enough to keep your body out of consecrated ground so any post mortem circumcision would be solely for the coroner's childish amusement.  PM me for relevant links.

MadMax,39nfsz,IrrelevantLeprechaun,2,Sat Jun 13 02:04:46 2015 UTC,nemothorx is correct
MadMax,39nfsz,eff1ngham,0,Sat Jun 13 03:31:10 2015 UTC,"I assume that the little girl is meant to be his daughter.  Not sure how familiar you are with the original films, OP, but in the first film (SPOILERS, obviously!!) Max's wife is run over by that film's main villain while she's carrying their baby. Both die.  In the beginning of Fury Road he makes mention to being haunted by those he could not protect. Since we know that Max only very begrudgingly helps the people he meets in his travels and isn't too bothered by letting people die, we have to assume that these people he couldn't protect were extremely close to him and not just people he met in some adventure. People dying in the course of Max's adventures doesn't bother him too much.  What makes this sort of confusing is that I'm pretty sure Max's baby was a boy and also an infant and not a girl as old as what's in his visions.  Also, the little girl calls him 'Max' most of the time, which would lead you to believe that he is not her father, but I'm 99% sure she says 'papa' at one time, though, unfortunately, I can't remember when. I just remember in one of my viewings hearing her say, 'Papa?' and thinking, 'Ah-ha! She is his daughter!' Possible that I just misheard, though.  Anyway, I'm guessing that for the purpose of storytelling his infant son was aged up and turned into a daughter."
MadMax,39nfsz,CharlieHarvey,0,Sat Jun 13 01:15:56 2015 UTC,"on further review you are correct. she does say ""papa"". i guess i was hoping for some underlining story with the visions. i was wrong i will admit that."
MadMax,39nfsz,CharlieHarvey,2,Sat Jun 13 01:44:10 2015 UTC,"It's still kind of confusing since most kids don't call their dads by their first name and she calls him 'Max' about a million times and 'papa' only once.  I don't really get the point of changing his son into a daughter, either, except that audiences seem to find little dead girls spookier than little boys, if horror films are anything to go on.  There's not a lot tying all the films together anyway, especially with the angle that Max might not even be a real person, but instead just a myth of the wasteland, so it frees them up to change pretty much anything they want on the fly."
MadMax,39nfsz,Retlaw83,5,Sat Jun 13 02:00:10 2015 UTC,"This kid is named Glory. Max's son was Sprog. They are both dead children, and both probably Max's, but they aren't the same kid.  My theory is after he regained some of his humanity after his adventure in Bartertown, he settled down somewhere and tried to start a life. When he finds the children in the oasis, after over a decade of scavenging the desert, he's ready to settle down there. He says to the teenage girl there, ""No one's leaving. We're going to stay here, be thankful, and live for a very long time.""  Maybe after Beyond Thunderdome he returns to the oasis and he forms a fatherly bond with one of the kids. Maybe he moved to another town and got attached to a single mother and the kid was adopted that way.  Regardless, there was a tragedy and it explains why he's so thoroughly broken in Fury Road. He could fight through losing loved ones the first time, and take years to emotionally heal enough to love people again, and then they die."
MadMax,39nfsz,CharlieHarvey,2,Sat Jun 13 17:45:25 2015 UTC,"I like this theory!  My only further input would be: I don't think that his son was actually named Sprog, personally, because Sprog is just slang for 'kid'. I know he's credited as 'Sprog', but I think that's just because his actual name is never given and Sprog is just a jokey nickname like 'Kiddo'. Sort of like 'Feral Kid' from MM 2.  It's been a little while since I've seen the first one, so I could be wrong, though."
MadMax,39nfsz,Retlaw83,1 point,Sat Jun 13 20:29:54 2015 UTC,"They only ever refer to him as sprog or sprogger. I didn't know it was slang, just assumed it was another weird Mad Max name."

MadMax,39nfsz,M3n747,2,Sun Jun 14 00:29:24 2015 UTC,"she calls him 'Max' about a million times and 'papa' only once   My best guess is that some time between MM1 and MM4 Max met some people (you see them in the flashbacks too), one of which was the girl, and he looked after them to perhaps make up for his failure to protect his family. In that case, it would make sense for the girl to call him ""Max"" at first and only call him ""papa"" once she accepted him as her surrogate father. (BTW, Aliens does this beautifully with Newt and Ripley.)"
MadMax,39nfsz,no_stalkers,2,Sat Jun 13 21:59:40 2015 UTC,"What if she(the little girl (Glory) just calls Max papa to pull on his heart string, you know to mess with him to get him to help Furiosa take The Citadel. It is his subconscious f**cking with him to help the helpless and ones worth dying for. Max is a man at the end of this rope when we start this story. I am convinced this is a clever way to tell back story. You know foreshadowing and that kind of stuff.  I would not put it past Gorge Miller to make a myth of many layers of the hero's quest. but this may be my option and mine alone. I am fine with that."

MadMax,39hl39,skonen_blades,6,Thu Jun 11 20:08:58 2015 UTC,"I think the idea of Mel and Tom being in the same movie is one of those rumors being floated by the studio, and not anything George, Mel, or Tom ever really talked about.    Mel Gibson seems content to stay behind the camera as a director (on other projects) for now, and he's never been anything but supportive of Tom, if Tom is who George likes. Supposedly after Tom and he had lunch, Mel phoned George and said, ""I think you found a guy even crazier then me.""   ... part of me worries that means we can expect Tom Hardy to have a total racist meltdown in 30 something years...   It might be interesting somewhere down the line to see a Tom Hardy Mad Max movie DIRECTED by Mel Gibson, but I can't see it happening any time soon."
MadMax,39hl39,IdiotsLantern,4,Thu Jun 11 22:22:09 2015 UTC,"I really hope Hardy doesn't go all Gibson on us... It's nice to have a kickass action hero who also looks adorable with puppies and speaks up about sexism in the film industry, and it would be so very comforting if he didn't start foaming at the mouth about Jews further on down the line."
MadMax,39hl39,ZiGraves,3,Fri Jun 12 09:44:10 2015 UTC,Mel was supposed to cameo in the movie acording to some of the script info that came out a few years ago. The thing is Mel doesn't want to do it so I doubt we will ever see him in mad max again.
MadMax,39hl39,The_Gotham,3,Thu Jun 11 21:37:06 2015 UTC,"I heard that rumor was always false.  I suspect the studio planted it themselves to see if anyone wanted it. No one did, not even Mel. I mean, George means a lot to Mel, but I think that means Mel would be there with anything George wants... and nothing George doesn't want. George has said he doesn't want Mel for a cameo because he thinks it would be ""Distracting."""
MadMax,39hl39,IdiotsLantern,5,Fri Jun 12 04:37:13 2015 UTC,Watched Road Warrior the other day.  A lot of people have pointed out how strangled Hardy's voice sounds. We never actually see the narrator at the end of Road Warrior. We assume he's an old man because of the way he sounds. Could he not be a younger man but with damaged vocal cords?  It would also explain Hardy's heavy grunting.
MadMax,39hl39,teaqualizer,11,Thu Jun 11 19:56:50 2015 UTC,"Isn't the narrator in Road Warrior the feral boy as an adult?  And in his narration he mentions that 'in the fullness of time' he came to become the leader of that group that Max helped, so the narrator probably isn't a young person."
MadMax,39hl39,CharlieHarvey,3,Thu Jun 11 20:50:46 2015 UTC,Yeah the words about leading the tribe definitely drive a great big semi through that theory
MadMax,39hl39,teaqualizer,6,Thu Jun 11 20:54:31 2015 UTC,"i'd like to see Mel as a villain.  A crazy guy who's heard about Max and is going around claiming to be him, offering people help and ripping them off in Max's name, leaving Max confused about his own madness and identity.  Hardy rolls into town calling himself Max and finds everyone hostile and has to track this bastard down, recover his identity, and redeem his name."
MadMax,39hl39,leonryan,5,Thu Jun 11 21:24:39 2015 UTC,"Frankly, that's pretty silly. Max isn't supposed to be a wasteland celebrity. Nobody would bother ripping people off in Max's name because everybody is too tied up in their own business to give a shit about some wanderer, let alone steal his identity."
MadMax,39hl39,ReturnToOcean,4,Thu Jun 11 23:26:01 2015 UTC,Max is a wasteland legend.  sooner or later the various communities he's helped are going to spread word of him.  it's not hard to imagine some traveler hearing the story in Bartertown or the Citadel and showing up at the next town claiming credit for Max's actions.
MadMax,39hl39,leonryan,3,Thu Jun 11 23:29:01 2015 UTC,"Won't happen. That wouldn't be a Mad Max movie. In a series in which continuity is of virtually no importance, it's ridiculous to expect Max to become a wasteland celebrity. Legend to some, sure, but it's a huge part of the movies that nobody sees Max and goes ""oh, this guy's a bloody hero!"" Same goes for a character going around claiming to be Max and people responding with anything other than ""who the hell is that and why should I care?"""
MadMax,39hl39,ReturnToOcean,5,Thu Jun 11 23:41:48 2015 UTC,"is it difficult to be so narrowminded you can't entertain the notion of a hypothetical situation for a fictional character?  it's got nothing to do with being a celebrity.  say i drive to the next town over and introduce myself to someone who goes ""my father was killed by a man calling himself that"" and suddenly i'm a suspect for something i didn't do because somebody heard my name and used it as cover.  The Citadel has a trade arrangement with two other settlements.  there is interaction between communities and it is possible that max has been discussed in heroic terms in more than one of them.  what's important is Max's situation.  The story is merely the vehicle for it, and how it comes about is the least important part.  That's where continuity breaks down.  The question of ""how did this come to be"" is the one that doesn't get answered, so whether it's likely to occur or not really doesn't matter.  The fact is it's possible and would provide an interesting exploration of characters and themes that are relevant to Max is what dictates whether it's worth telling the story.  He'd get to question his identity and his sanity and explore what meaning they still have after the apocalypse.  It could discuss how history and legends are perverted by time and individuals."
MadMax,39hl39,leonryan,0,Thu Jun 11 23:56:55 2015 UTC,"I can entertain the notion fine. I just think it's a bad one. I'd hope over the coming years the series does work to shake things up in terms of structure and such, but I don't think that's the way.  I want Mad Max to continue to deal with deeper themes. Fury Road did an excellent job of balancing adrenaline-fueled action with questions like ""who killed the world?"" I just feel that your idea would make Miller's world feel smaller, more artificial, and less alien."
MadMax,39hl39,ReturnToOcean,3,Fri Jun 12 00:32:00 2015 UTC,"i'm just proposing a way to get Gibson in it without him being a completely different character.  the question of whether Hardy really is Max was already raised because the timeline doesn't seem to match, so i think that would be fun to explore.  It would enhance the mystery of who Max really is.  Maybe Mel is the real Max but he's gone completely insane over the years.  Maybe Hardy is just crazy and after hearing the legend of Max he deluded himself into thinking he is him, and with Gibson now insane the mantle passes to Hardy because Max the legend is a concept rather than an individual.  it would free the franchise from dumb questions and open it up for eternal sequels, kind of like how people suggest James Bond is a title rather than an individual.  Ultimately I'd like it to end with Hardy killing Gibson but never really answering which was the real Max."
MadMax,39hl39,leonryan,0,Fri Jun 12 00:38:24 2015 UTC,"Or they're the same character played by different actors. I hate to sound like the unimaginative stick in the mud, but, unless it's explicitly stated otherwise, it is far more likely that there is only one Max."
MadMax,39hl39,ReturnToOcean,1 point,Fri Jun 12 00:52:56 2015 UTC,"i'd prefer there's only one max too, but i like anything that raises questions and builds a mystery.  that's what gets people speculating for decades."

Essentially, he's a prince of his particular world and someone who has survived very well in it."
MadMax,39hl39,50MoreTrash,0,Fri Jun 12 15:22:02 2015 UTC,"True enough, but many people don't like Thunderdome. The story plays a role in that."
MadMax,39hl39,ReturnToOcean,2,Fri Jun 12 18:36:57 2015 UTC,"I dunno, I feel like the fact that he never says his name in Thunderdome and is guarded about it in Fury Road sort of indicates that in both films he has already gained some amount of notoriety/fame. He might not want to say his name because he doesn't want people to assume he's going to help them with whatever problem they're having. He prefers to stay anonymous (since it's possible that his stories have spread around).  He obviously has some sort of recognizable traits though because when he's getting tattooed they tattoo ""lone Road Warrior"" on him. Might be a common term for men like Max, but in 2 the Feral Kid refers to him as the Road Warrior, might also only refer to him.    I think nobody recognizes him because the only real method of spreading information would be word of mouth. Like, other than vague descriptions how would they differentiate him from anybody else, but then, if you heard the name ""Max"" things might start to click.  I feel like a false-Max angle wouldn't be the worst if handled properly, but I doubt it's compelling enough for a whole story. Just saying, there's a good chance people have heard of him, even if they don't know what he looks like."

The feral kid recalls him as the road warrior, but in the same way he would have had he used a term like ""the drifter."" Also, prefixing it with ""lone"" would imply that Max isn't the only person who would be classified as a road warrior. If Road Warrior was a title specific to them they'd have written ""the Road Warrior."""

MadMax,39hifk,Bestpaperplaneever,15,Thu Jun 11 19:21:51 2015 UTC,"3000 gallons, which we are led to believe is how much the fuel pod at the back held.  The main tanker held water and milk (I assume it's a divided tanker with each in separate compartments, and they would have traded for additional gas at Gas Town).    The pod most likely carries gas to re-fuel any of the vehicles in the fleet as an emergency reserve.  Since they have a 12,000 gallon tanker as the main source to haul, the pod is most likely insurance just in case.  The Rock Riders don't appear to have any allegiance with Joe, so why would you let three war parties onto your turf when you could block the pass and deal with just Furiosa and the War Rig?  The enemy of your enemy is not necessarily your friend in the Wasteland, especially when they outnumber you 10-1 (or more)"
MadMax,39hifk,eff1ngham,7,Thu Jun 11 20:07:52 2015 UTC,"Yup.  One thing you'll also notice is that the riders immediately end their chase after they see the fuel pod explode, which goes to show how pragmatic their motives are."
MadMax,39hifk,kramark,2,Thu Jun 11 20:20:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm a big fan of the Riders for that reason - they were only pissed because the deal was being broken, and only wanted what they were promised."
MadMax,39hifk,Turbofurball,2,Fri Jun 12 10:26:39 2015 UTC,"My guess is that the fuel pod was not actually completely full of guzzoline and her intent was to unhitch it and drive off before the Rock Riders were the wiser; what with the chaos of the pursuing vehicles.   Now given the explosion it created, it most certainly could be argued that it shouldn't have been that large compared to a fuel pod running on empty.   Another strange thought is that there is a whole segment about the truck losing power when Nux disconnects one of the two fuel lines, so how does the truck continue to press on after they lose the fuel pod in the canyon?"
MadMax,39hifk,TheGreatMinky,5,Fri Jun 12 15:32:20 2015 UTC,That was an air hose for the brakes. He disconnected it and it caused the brakes to lock up on the pod. That's what slowed the rig down.

That's a good question.  If they're on their way to gastown to get gas, why bring a whole bunch of gas?  Who knows. I think the Rock Riders blocked the passage to keep three freaking war parties out of their turf.

MadMax,39hifk,JimmyDaGent,3,Thu Jun 11 20:34:43 2015 UTC,"I think they were only supposed to get the trailer, not the whole rig. Furiosa intended to take the rig (and wives) onward to the Green Place. At the very beginning, the war boys chanted that they were going to Gas Town and were loaded with aqua-cola (water). I'm willing to bet everyone else thought the gas-trailer was empty and would get filled with gas in exchange for water--naturally you wouldn't use the same container for gas and water.   Furiosa was smuggling the gas for the Rock Riders. I would guess there wasn't a lot of mother's milk, and I imagine it was also being smuggled for the wives and the Mothers. Seeing as how nobody had anything to eat, I'm guessing Furiosa and the wives were supposed to use mother's milk for nourishment.   See above I don't think they necessarily hated Furiosa (at least not at first), but seeing as how she bought the war parties into their turf I imagine they got pretty pissed. The one thing I was thinking was that Furiosa was pretty naive to believe the Rock Riders in the first place: they could have easily killed her and taken the whole rig, and the wives as a bonus. It was actually fortunate the things went the way they did, otherwise I seriously doubt they would have let her live. What incentive would they have otherwise?   The irony then is that when Furiosa says ""I got unlucky"" by bringing the war parties, in the end it probably kept her alive."
MadMax,39hifk,LostSoulsAlliance,1 point,Fri Jun 12 06:20:55 2015 UTC,"At the beginning the war boys are chanting a song as they get the rig ready to go and at one point in their chanting they're saying, 'Today we're hauling aqua-cola!' Aqua-cola being their slang for water.  The tanker is full of milk and water. We know it's full of milk and water, because the war boys tell us and because at one point Max goes to wash his face in what he thinks is going to be water and not understanding what he's found he says, 'What is this?' and one of the wives says, 'It's mothers' milk.'  They were taking this milk and water to deliver it to Gas Town and bring back fuel (probably in the tanker that would then be empty). Again, we can figure this out because part of the war boys chant includes them saying, 'Today we're going to Gas Town!'  And I believe that Immortan Joe mentions this in his speech, but I can't remember.  The fuel pod is full of guzzoline (probably to be used to re-fuel vehicles on the road if something unforeseen happens and they need extra fuel). Furiosa is going to trade this to the Rock Riders in exchange for safe passage.  She would not be trading them the War Rig and the water or milk, because she needs/wants all three of those things to get to the Green Place."

One thing that I think is kind of telling is that the war boys aren't really that surprised or alarmed when they suddenly go off-road.

Unless they thoroughly scrub it down between hauls, hauling foodstuff in anything that had gasoline in it would make it unpalatable at the very least, if not downright toxic. As for mixing leftover milk or even water with gas, that's a recipe for engine trouble."
MadMax,39hifk,ThirstyOne,4,Thu Jun 11 21:32:54 2015 UTC,"See my original post, but most large tanker trailers (The War Rig is certainly one of the largest) have several different compartments in them.  For example a tanker truck today doesn't just mix all different kinds of gas together, they're compartmentalized to separate them out.  I would assume the War Rig has several different holds, some of them are for water, some for milk, the others for gas.  It would make the most sense unless as you say they're thoroughly washing and sanitizing each time (which is possible but unlikely)"
MadMax,39hifk,eff1ngham,1 point,Fri Jun 12 00:03:31 2015 UTC,"I think you're right, plus we know the tanker had water and milk and also... The brides. There must have been other chambers in the tanker to accommodate them. Plus they said it was hard to breath down there, too."
MadMax,39hifk,Derpatologist_7,3,Fri Jun 12 11:01:32 2015 UTC,"Poke all the holes you want! Why apologize for that? We're just talking. :)  I just can't really think of any other way it would work. There isn't a second, empty tanker in their train and unless they're going to Gas Town just for the purpose of re-provisioning them without bringing anything back, they would need to bring guzzoline back in something. The fuel pod is already full of fuel, so they're not going to be using that to bring any back from Gas Town.  I agree with you that milk/water that's been hauled in a tanker that is also used to haul gasoline would be gross and not safe, but this is also a post-apocalyptic world where most things are probably toxic and unpalatable. It's not really like the health inspector is going to catch them.  Also, I think if the tanker was rinsed, even poorly, the amount of gas that would be left would be minimal enough that it wouldn't kill people. At least not in the short amount of time that half-lives live anyway."
MadMax,39hifk,CharlieHarvey,1 point,Thu Jun 11 21:41:35 2015 UTC,"What if the fuel pod is only partially full, or if it was meant to be empty, but Furiosa filled it up before leaving, unbeknownst to the war-boys. Does anyone have any idea how much fuel a pod like that holds?"
MadMax,39hifk,ThirstyOne,2,Thu Jun 11 21:47:40 2015 UTC,"Well, Furiosa promised the Rock Riders 3,000 gallons, I believe? But of course that's assuming that the pod is full. My hunch would be to say that the pod holds 3,000 gallons, because it seems to me that the Rock Riders would have negotiated until they got a pod full of fuel and not a half-filled one."
MadMax,39hifk,CharlieHarvey,1 point,Thu Jun 11 22:01:41 2015 UTC,"The rock riders don't necessarily know how much fuel the pod holds though. Even if they did, Furiosa would have to explain to them that she can't very well go on a fuel run with a full pod during the negotiations.  This is a visual representation of a 3,000 gallon water tank. The tanker behind the truck looked bigger than this.  My guess is that they'd negotiate for less than a full tanker since they still have to haul the fuel into wherever they're hide-out is in the mountains. There weren't any roads that were accessible by regular car from the canyon that I could see in the film, which means they'd have to empty the fuel into smaller containers they can carry on their dirt bikes. Doing that with an entire tanker full might be challenging."

MadMax,39f697,Turbofurball,5,Thu Jun 11 12:16:45 2015 UTC,I've actually caught this too. Anyone who has seen the movie multiple times I think notice this. It IS one bullet off. The scenes happen right after each other.
MadMax,39f697,compacta_d,2,Thu Jun 11 14:02:06 2015 UTC,"This is one of those things that will be settled when we have Blu-Rays we can analyze shot for shot. The way I'm remembering that scene (right now) it goes...   Max has a gun on Nux. The Dag points out the Bullet Farmer is approaching. Furiosa signals Max to handle it and replaces him holding the gun on Nux. Max starts shooting at the bullet farmer. He fires twice before TK says, ""You've got two left."" Then he fires one more time. That would be a total of three shots, which fits with Toast's count from earlier.   Furiosa hands TK her pistol, tells HER to cover Nux (!) and then goes to make the last bullet count.  So basically the whole thing would have been avoided if Furiosa had kept Max on Nux guard duty and taken the shot herself. But then again, maybe a desire to make amends for that failed shot is part of why Max grabs that gas can and takes off to finish off the Bullet Farmer while everyone else tends to the rig. Who knows."
MadMax,39f697,IdiotsLantern,3,Thu Jun 11 18:13:00 2015 UTC,"I'm not entirely sure, but in my memory it went like this: Toast counted four bullets when she checked their ammunition.

MadMax,39f03l,Yagatra,8,Thu Jun 11 07:40:29 2015 UTC,"My dad was a radio technician for wildland fire services (aka forest fires).  Setting up radio transmissions from a central location (or locations: Citadel, Gas Town, Bullet Farm) with multiple receivers requires a lot of effort and planning in addition to the equipment and radio towers.  Most likely it's knowledge and equipment they just didn't have.  Walkie talkies potentially may have been an option for the small groups in close proximity, but given how far in the future Fury Road takes place it's a safe bet that those kinds of batteries were tough to come by"
MadMax,39f03l,eff1ngham,2,Thu Jun 11 16:01:45 2015 UTC,"radio is hard?   We know they have electricity (cars start with starter motors presumably, but also: headlights), but in a ruined world, building and/or maintaining radio equipment, when nobody cares about it (unlike cars), is likely hard and a quickly forgotten technology. (memories of my 1980s childhood electronics hobby say that building an FM transmitter is relatively easy, but FM receiver is harder. AM receiver is relatively easy, but AM transmitter is hard... But my memories may also be faulty :)"

Some fans have speculated that Max may if used it as ear plugs, but I guess when the film is released on Bluray and it's no longer in the shot then we can confirm it was a production error."
MadMax,39f03l,Derpatologist_7,2,Thu Jun 11 11:03:28 2015 UTC,I actually don't remember seeing him wearing that ear piece until after Furiosa shoots near his ear.  I always assumed he wore if after that because of the pain from her shooting so close.....
MadMax,39f03l,eff1ngham,2,Thu Jun 11 16:05:36 2015 UTC,"I think if it was intended to be part of the story, that would have been relatively obvious.

No electrical function - just something he wears by habit, or some obscure comfort reason not clear to us. Would be easy enough to retcon something (stop noise and dust to sooth an irritated ear!)  Either way, at best it indicates that radio (maybe even bluetooth) did previously exist in the past, but I don't think it alters the point - radio isn't used in the story, and that technology appears to have been lost."

I didn't really have an opinion or theory on it myself, though I did see that it didn't show any function in the movie and like you said, they would have shown it having a more useful function if that's what they'd intended during filming. I just thought it was a neat observation."
MadMax,39f03l,Derpatologist_7,1 point,Thu Jun 11 12:07:26 2015 UTC,the first image is the first I saw it too - I'd probably not have noticed it if not for another redditer.

One of those other pics you posted -the one where Max is on the back of Nux's car looks like a promo shot, but if that was in the actual movie during those scenes I think it would be interesting as to why or more so how Max has it considering he was still a prisoner at that stage and had been bound, but also considering he'd been held in captivity in the citadel I daresay he'd of been stripped of all of his belongings and had his pockets emptied."

It is a type of gene bank. The seeds stored may be food crops, or those of rare species to protect biodiversity. The reasons for storing seeds may be varied. In the case of food crops, many useful plants that were developed over centuries are now no longer used for commercial agricultural production and are becoming rare. Storing seeds also guards against catastrophic events like natural disasters, outbreaks of disease, or war. Unlike seed libraries or seed swaps that encourage frequent reuse and sharing of seeds, seed banks are not typically open to the public.

Clearly she's seen some shit as she's missing an arm, but she's managed to gain both the trust and respect of Joe and the war boys (the war boys call her 'boss').  Clearly she hasn't tried to make multiple escape attempts. At least not on any meaningful scale, because the war boys didn't suspect her of anything when she went off-road and Immortan Joe seemed genuinely surprised by all this."

This is also why i believe they'd have never let Max go, no matter how ""grateful"" the Immortan was. Useful healthy humans are just too valuable to be allowed to wander off into the desert where they can be no good to anybody.

They lived without fear, no one dared to attack them for fear of the valkyries who rode the sky protecting them.  That was until one day black smoke bloomed on the horizon. The valkyries set out to identify this threat. What they saw scared them. A war machine unlike any other crawled its way across the desert. It's treads ripping the ground up as it pushed forward. Cranes clawing in front pulling the rig. Along its back a small city guarded by fire, bullets, and cannons. Black smoke rising from the back. This machine was followed by many vehicles. Rigs carrying gas and men.  Far off in front. A lone black vehicle. Riding across the desert like a mad demon. In its wake dust and dirt rise into the air like blood and flames. The leader of the valkyries reckonizes this vehicle. One from a distant memory. One from a time when hope seemed lost.  But it no longer holds hope. Only doom as the behemoth behind follows it north.

MadMax,39a6rz,nemothorx,9,Wed Jun 10 20:16:17 2015 UTC,they glorify cars. Car engine scarred into Nux's chest for instance.   Chrome on cars is A Thing. They're mimicking it.

MadMax,39a6rz,AdaptationAgency,6,Thu Jun 11 01:59:02 2015 UTC,"They are inhaling spray paint. Huffing paint gets you high. Hence, it'd be a useful drug to take right before you're about to commit suicide because it will remove fear of death. It also makes you shiny and chrome, so it fits in with the religion of V8  Here is a redditor's first-hand experience with inhaling paint fumes:    Since no one else is going to answer, and it's been over 20 years since I've engaged in such foolishness, I can probably answer without being lectured (as anyone currently doing this absolutely should be). It is completely insane. Like high-dose psychedelic insane. The one thing that stands out to this day is the profound sense of deja vu it caused. It was almost as if everything was scripted. Not much in the way of visuals, but a complete and total mindfuck. Really, a brain-damaged stupor would be the best way to describe it, but with pretty intense euphoria. One thing that set it apart from other inhalants was the incredible duration. A huffing session could easily keep you high for 4-5 hours, with effects lasting 2+ hours past the last inhalation. I'm not going to lie, it was loads of fun. It was also incredibly stupid. My final encounter with it scared me straight for good as it was the one and only time I ever blacked out. I don't mean passed out, I mean blacked out. I lost two hours in the middle of the day, where I was fully conscious and interacting with people but had NO recollection of it whatsoever. It was literally as if my environment completely changed in the blink of an eye. One second I was in my house talking to one friend, then one second later, when I ""came to,"" I was on my back porch talking to another friend who wasn't even there before. It literally happened mid-sentence. I zoned back in and heard the last half of what I was saying, then was startled by who I was talking to. ""Wait a minute... Randy... when did you get here??!!"" ""Dude, are you kidding me? I've been here almost two hours."" Needless to say, I was incredibly disoriented, frightened, and confused. My friend told me that they had to wrestle the bag away from me because I wouldn't stop huffing. This scared the shit out of me because I realized I easily could have huffed until I died during my blackout, had my friends not been there to stop me. I never touched that shit again. In hindsight, I consider myself extremely lucky to have not suffered any long-term damage from my 20-30 times huffing that Krylon Gold Metallic. Who knows, maybe I have? TL;DR - Huffing spray paint is an incredibly intense, bizarre, fun, and long lived high that's not even remotely worth it."

Capable then says, 'Who are Larry and Barry?' and Nux points at his tumours that have little smiley faces drawn onto them and says, 'My mates, Larry and Barry.

Every movie in italy is translated and dubbed, it's a pretty big business, seeing the 4 installment in english wasn't so easy, luckily i found a cinema that screened not dubbed movies once a week.  In popular culture it's a pretty loved film, but mainly between 80s and 90s nerds and movies critics (each group for different reasons i suppose), during the ages the passion went fading, maybe with the 4th chapter we could have a rebirth.  The first enthusiast were born also because in the ages 80 and 90 the anime kenshiro (don't know how it's titled abroad, but i think you know it) had a great success.

Mad Max series itself is not really well known either; it's easy to say that Fury Road is the first introduction of Mad Max series to young south Korean people.  Mad Max: Fury Road was open in 2D, IMAX 3D and some other type of cinema with Korean subtitle. It stayed box office #1 for a couple of weeks and about 3 million tickets were sold. For comparison, Avengers: Age of Ultron sold 10 million. You can say Mad Max was super hit.  Most of discussion regarding the movie is quite similar to those posted on Reddit, such as mad respect to powerful nonstop action sequences, made with practical effects and stunts rather than greenscreen CG, discussion about the gender equality portrayed in the movie and men's right activists' hatred against it, props to minor details you may ignore and of course the Doof Warrior hype(or, that red spandex guitar guy). So you can say the movie delivered a very clear message regardless of cultural difference.  But some detail got lost through translation, and Australian root of car enthusiast culture definitely got lost. More likely, I cannot tell if it's Australian thing or post apocalypse thing. I cannot tell if there's some Australian culture flowing through this movie, or if it's all imagination of the director George Miller. But that doesn't make movie less interesting."

These are fanatical holy warriors who worship car engines and try to die in explosions-- I somehow doubt there would be too much objection to Nux bringing his blood bag along for what appears to essentially be a Mad Maxian version of D-Day.    It makes more sense from a resource-use perspective to keep Max healthy   From a resource-use perspective tearing around revving your v-8 and kamikaze-ing yourself doesn't exactly seem like the kind of behavior that people with a real appreciation for the concept of scarcity would dig.    2) The Wives' body types don't really visually communicate fertility. Too skinny. Curvier would have been a better choice.   Huh. Odd and very specific criticism. Being attractive ladies without deformities draped in white seemed to convey fertility perfectly well to me. And they weren't just meant to convey fertility, but goodness, purity, beauty, and innocence.    3) During the fight on the way back to the Citadel, there is a scene where Max is on top of the People Eater's vehicle, and he pulls the driver up and out through the sun roof with one hand. While the vehicle is moving at a high speed   Yeah, you know, probably a lot of the stuff we see these guys and gals do guys and gals can't actually do."
MadMax,39dpqa,astrangefish,-1,Thu Jun 11 03:33:22 2015 UTC,"1) But the People Eater is absolutely aware of all the costs involved and gives Joe an earful about it.  If you need blood to keep the War Boys going just like you need gas (sorry, ""guzzoline"") to keep the vehicles going, you'd be careful how you treated the source of the blood.  I wouldn't expect the War Boys to think about it, but the Organic Mechanic would, and in fact there is a line where he tells them to be careful handling Max because he is a universal donor.  2) If you look over the history of art in Western civilization and virtually ALL of pre-history, fertility images are nearly always of females with curvy, plump and even fat bodies.  There are biological reasons why a curvy body is better-suited to bearing and feeding healthy babies.  Since the film deals with many storytelling archetypes and is strongly visual, skinny women as fertility symbols is an odd choice.  A Sofia Vergara body type would be very attractive and more suited to what is being communicated."

Pre-production was largely done within Australia (especially vehicle scouting and design, and before relocation, location was intended here too). Two of the three writers are Aussie (in fact, two of the three were involved in the original Mad Max, though I guess counting Miller there is a bit too easy, right? ;)  But for me, I think the bits that seal the deal is that it was produced by Kennedy Miller Productions (Australian company), and Village Roadshow Pictures (also Australian). WB was the distribution company for most of the world. (but hey, distributed by 20th Century Fox in Malaysia apparently!), so they're behind most of the marketing, but that's quite different from the production. Finally, I believe Screen Australia also assisted with the production in some form :)"

MadMax,3963vp,skonen_blades,6,Thu Jun 11 01:13:35 2015 UTC,"Agreed. The film had a nice coherent sequence of event's throughout and the pacing and visual representation were awesome. No missing bits or sequences where you have to merely assume something happened, or wonder 'what the hell just happened? How did we get to this point?'. Unlike so many other 'action' films such as the latest Avenger's movie or anything made by Michael Bay which just feels more like an ADD highlight reel than an actual film. Those films feel like the editors could have used a drip-feed of Ritalin and Adderal just to keep them from spastically switching between shots and cutting the movie like a bunch of crack-heads wielding dull razors."
MadMax,3963vp,ThirstyOne,8,Tue Jun 9 16:25:57 2015 UTC,"I saw an interview with George Miller on Collider yesterday and he spoke about how there where 5 deleted scenes - but these weren't snippets taken from existing scenes but extra little scenes that he felt would cause a ""bump"" in the flow of the film. The original cut was 2 hours and 20 minutes - he then got it down to just 2 hours which I feel was perfect and I'm sure he felt the same way. The film flows perfectly - it would have been tiring to have constant action throughout the film. When I went to see Age of Ultron for the first time I instantly detected bumps in the flow of the film - which I hear where caused by hovering executive producers tugging at Joss Whedon's creative strings to get him to juggle a mishmash of different scenes.  I'm glad the film got an R rating (or 15 in the UK) - this gave George a wealthy amount of freedom. It also seems - unlike Marvel Studios - that the producers and executive producers of Mad Max Fury Road let George go wild with whatever he wanted. Reading all these stories about big film producers and studios makes it sound like the Executive Producers and Producers are more of the Directors than the actual Directors themselves."

You can tell what's going on in the HK stuff, very eloquent visual language. The American stuff is choppy and garbage. It's similar to Robert Altman dialogue where people overlap and you can't hear what's going on -- I get why it's done but it's usually done poorly. If the POV is tightly on a character who is in a noisy, confusing situation and is unable to see what's going on, fine, convey that with the film. But an action movie's express POV is letting us, the audience, see the action, no matter what the characters are experiencing.   So yes, this was a breath of fresh air."

It made sense to have it there though - unlike practically everywhere for any other action film.  If Michael Bay directed this film you'd bet there be thousands of suggestive shots of the Wives with Megan Fox playing Furiosa and then Max saying ""My bad"" when he breaks something - fill that in with some teen angst Linkin Park and some mention of China and the cash'll start flowin'. Come to think of it - that would be absolutely horrific."
MadMax,3963vp,Dr_Death_Defy24,3,Tue Jun 9 20:06:43 2015 UTC,"I saw an interview somewhere saying that Miller made sure that the action is always happening dead-center, in the middle of the frame. You don't have to waste precious milliseconds looking around the frame to figure out what's going on. That's how so much action can explode everywhere, yet with some sense of logic in the way we view it.   Ah, here it is, with a nice video showing examples:  http://vashivisuals.com/the-editing-of-mad-max-fury-road/   One of the many reasons MAD MAX: FURY ROAD is so successful as an action film is the editing style. By using “Eye Trace” and “Crosshair Framing” techniques during the shooting, the editor could keep the important visual information vital in one spot…the Center of the Frame. Because almost every shot was center framed, comprehending the action requires no hunting of each new shot for the point of interest. The viewer doesn’t need 3 or 4 frames to figure out where to look. It’s like watching an old hand-drawn flip book whiz by. The focus is always in the same spot!  This was an edict passed down directly from director George Miller. Over the walkie talkies during every scene he could heard saying “Put the cross hairs on her nose! Put the cross hairs on the gun!” This was to protect the footage for editorial and to ensure that the entire high speed film would be easily digestible with both eyes and brain. Every new shot that slammed onto the screen must occupy the same space as the previous shot. This is by no means a new technique, but by shooting the entire film in this way, Margaret Sixel could amplify and accelerate scenes, cut as fast as possible with the confident knowledge that the visual information would be understood."
MadMax,3963vp,Turbofurball,3,Wed Jun 10 00:41:54 2015 UTC,"I also saw an interview with Miller where he explained that all the action, all the things he wants the viewer to see, are right in the center of the screen. This means that your eyes rarely have to move which is a VERY good thing when the average cut is not even 2 seconds long.   I would love to find the interview/article because it had some footage from the movie with a crosshair in the center of the screen to really highlight how centered it was. unfortunately, i'm on mobile."

MadMax,397ema,kithkatul,4,Wed Jun 10 09:40:08 2015 UTC,"Considering what one of the Vuvalani said about it, and what it used to be, they're likely scavengers looking for valuables left over from when it was the Green Place, using stilts to keep themselves out of the toxic muck."

MadMax,397ema,HarveryDent,4,Tue Jun 9 21:43:50 2015 UTC,In the People Eater's entourage (can't remember if it was his personal vehicle or not) was a mobile refinery capable of generating gas on the go. It's what makes the really big boom while Max is up on the pole.
MadMax,397ema,IdiotsLantern,8,Tue Jun 9 23:54:32 2015 UTC,"Great take aways!    I'd read a great comment that the Mad Max films follow a track of civilizational development.  In the original, civilization is raggedly hanging on but actively crumbling.  In Road Warrior, things are at an absolute nadir, everybody barely has anything if anything at all and has to scavenge and kill to survive.  In Thunderdome, civilization is beginning to shakily re-assert itself, and Bartertown is intended as a permanent settlement, the first we've seen post-apocalypse.  In Fury Road, civilizational power has just begun to solidify enough to concentrate and consolidate around warlords.  Immortan Joe reintroduces a sort of feudalism with the Citadel as his castle, naturally attracting great numbers of disenfranchised peasants that flock to its safety.  It's uncertain just what Joe gets out of their presence but I'd guess that he takes the healthiest male babies among them to become War Pups.  Mad Max is about humanity falling down, Fury Road is about it hitting the ground, Beyond Thunderdome is about it finding its feet, and Fury Road is about it standing up.  Young people make great fighters, but experienced people make great leaders, and only the best leaders in this world seem likely to make it to old age.  In a world that seems driven by the understanding that survival means taking everything you can get and giving nothing up, Immortan Joe, the People Eater, and the Bullet Farmer have become more powerful and resourceful than anybody heretofore seen in the series by cooperating.  Joe provides the water needed to sustain life and the milk needed to help replenish it.  People Eater has created a community of refineries so great that the gas wars the rest of the continent lives by seem almost quaint.  Hell, Road Warrior's entire conflict is driven by a town with an oil derrick, and Gas Town is so flush that it has derricks so far out that GT can just be made out on the horizon, the derricks undefended.  The Bullet Farm totally erases the kind of scarcity that made Lord Humungus' five or so bullets seem so significant.    Each of them empowers the other, and I imagine that none of them were so individually powerful before they formed what seems to either be a Triumvirate or a King and his vassals.  Maybe Gas Town started out with the same scale as the refinery from Fury Road, Bullet Town as an ammunition dump or a lead mine like you suggest, Immortan Joe as a Humungus-like gang leader that happened across an underground reservoir.  By agreeing to trade with one another rather than attempting to conquer each other's turf, all three flourished and grew into what they became by the time of Fury Road.  It's a little hard to imagine any of these groups figuring out how to build more, say, oil derricks, but if the Keeper of the Seeds remembers what it was like before the fall then surely there are other experts who do too, and if the Organic Mechanic can determine Max's blood type while in a mountain cave then clearly all acumen hasn't been lost.  That was definitely Russian?  Awesome!  I'd been really curious about what the Buzzards were saying, that's super cool to know.  Like so much of the movie's lore it explains very little but opens up so many fascinating possibilities.  I'm already imagining Russian refugees fleeing as far as they could practically manage from a nation that seems to be a likely epicenter for a nuclear fallout."

MadMax,397ema,horticult,2,Fri Jun 12 16:54:30 2015 UTC,"I got the idea that Joe, People Eater and Bullet Farmer have set up what may be, sadly, the most civilized place in their area.  They've build a pretty stable economy on the three legs of fuel, weapons and agriculture, with the implicationt that female slavery is also a staple of their society on some level or another.  This is why they don't seem to struggle for fuel or even food."
MadMax,397ema,teamtywin,3,Thu Jun 11 05:07:10 2015 UTC,"One of the most insidious things toxic masculinity does is convince young boys to relate to tyrants, to see themselves as metal album cover viking barbarians and tell them that to be real men, real manly men, they will take whatever they want with violence, that emotions are weakness, and power and the respect of that tyrannical father figure are the most important things life has to offer them.  All over the world there's a tradition of old men sending young men off to die for them, often with very little explanation. I think George Miller is skeptical of that system."

Asatru is already a fairly popular religion (among pagan religions, I mean)."
MadMax,39bi9e,TheHorselessHeadsman,1 point,Wed Jun 10 20:38:20 2015 UTC,I was unaware of this town (which has 9 inhabitants). Somehow the cult in the film reminded me of two towns named Walla Walla.

I've seen the film four times now and the last time was in an IMAX theatre where the sound was up so loud my teeth were rattling in their sockets and I'm 99% sure that they're saying 'Valhalla' in the film, though, and not 'Walhalla'.

MadMax,397hvg,Droidaphone,8,Wed Jun 10 02:35:54 2015 UTC,The diseased masses are important in terms of the film because they help to emphasise his wealth and greed to the audience (and to Joe himself). They are also important in terms of the loyalty of the war boys. The fact that there is a lower tier struggling to survives gives the war boys a point of reference that make them feel privileged to serve Joe. They get food and access to wheels and the organic mechanic and seeing those wretches below reinforces their devotion.
MadMax,397hvg,teaqualizer,4,Wed Jun 10 11:27:20 2015 UTC,You make a good point about the Warboys.
MadMax,397hvg,Qarlo,3,Wed Jun 10 11:46:58 2015 UTC,seeing those wretches below reinforces their devotion.    Really good point. Immortan Joe's favor is the only thing that keeps them from living and starving in the dirt.
MadMax,397hvg,TheHorselessHeadsman,11,Wed Jun 10 19:16:02 2015 UTC,"TL;DR - I don't think that Immortan Joe would want to kill those people. I think that in his own evil dictator way he is trying to take care of them. Besides, we didn't get to see much of the Citadel. They could contribute in some way that we never see. Most of them seemed somewhat able-bodied and there would be no shortage of back-breaking labour and drudgery to be done in keeping a place like the Citadel alive and moving. I can't remember now, but is it not some of them that are powering the wheels used to raise and lower the platform the vehicles take to get to the ground?  One thing about the Mad Max villains is they're not usually out-and-out horrible people (I don't think anyway).  Toecutter in the first MM film was probably the most two-dimensionally villainous, but that could also just be because he's not in the film that much and so we don't get a chance to really know him. All we ever get a chance to see him doing is terrorizing people, as I recall.  The leader in Road Warrior (I cannot remember his name right now to save my life. Lord something) really struck me as a guy who was brutal and ruthless, but mostly because he had to be. Like there's a scene where he's asking the defending townspeople to just leave and let his gang take what they want and it really seems like he honestly doesn't want to have to kill these people, but if he has to, he will. He keeps saying something to them like, 'Please, just leave!'  I don't think that Immortan Joe is an 'evil' person. I think that in his own way he's trying to do what's best and probably rationalizing a lot of things by saying that in tough times people have to suffer. His rationing of the water isn't really that bad of an idea, in theory. I mean, they're in a desert. It's reasonable to think that it could run out someday if you let the rabble have as much as they want.  I'm not trying to say that he's a nice person. He probably looks down on these people as lesser lifeforms and wouldn't be too fussed if they all suddenly died, but I think that within the confines of what he finds reasonable he tries to take care of them...  And there's the scene where one of the wives wants to go back to him and she's shouting things along the lines of, 'He'll forgive us, I know he will!' and 'We were his treasures; he gave us everything!' and the other wives don't seem to disagree with her that they were well-treated. They just object to not being treated like free people.  Pretty much everyone in the Mad Max universe (Max included) do a lot of shitty things and could very easily be the villains of films told from another perspective."
MadMax,397hvg,Qarlo,8,Wed Jun 10 02:34:56 2015 UTC,"Actually, a ""Mad max is the villain""* story would be neat. He comes in and fucks up a slightly better-class Citadel/Bartertown because he's after one guy hiding behind it and doesn't give a shit about the rebuilding going around it.  * One of the lesser-known ""Mad Max"" legends"
MadMax,397hvg,TheHorselessHeadsman,5,Wed Jun 10 16:02:25 2015 UTC,"This would be pretty cool.  I think a good example of how Max can be just as cruel and uncaring as everyone else in the wastes is the part of Road Warrior when he chains the gyrocopter pilot to a dead tree and then leaves him there and doesn't bother telling anyone he's there or considering him again until he finds him escaping (while dragging the tree) later.  The guy could easily have dehydrated to death or died of sunstroke or even been eaten by feral dogs.   Of course the pilot did try to kill Max first with the whole snake trap thing, but it would still be a pretty terrible death to die chained to a tree."
MadMax,397hvg,ComradeGarcia_Pt2,6,Wed Jun 10 16:14:54 2015 UTC,In my opinion that's essentially what happened in Thunderdome.
MadMax,397hvg,Qarlo,3,Wed Jun 10 17:28:05 2015 UTC,I've been thinking about it since I posted that and I think you're pretty much right. Bartertown was a wretched hive of scum and villainy but it wasn't evil. Thunderdome was trial by combat - extra-bloody dueling -  and the Pigkiller actually was a pig killer where pigs were absolutely critical. Auntie Entity was explicit about rebuilding civilization and replacing despair with hope.

I was surprised when I got the invitation, because this is a group of people who until now were not interested in seeing the movie...but I've been raving about it nonstop for the past week and I'd like to think that I piqued their interest a bit.   This group is mostly women and they tend to like big action movies. They all watched Avengers: Age of Ultron and they are all stoked about Jurassic World (as am I), but for some reason they were simply not interested in Mad Max and did not seem to think it could possibly be something they would enjoy watching.

Can we rewind it…no? I’ll guess I’ll have to see it again…”.   The level of detail in the costumes, sets, and the breakneck pace of the editing draws you into the film.

MadMax,395abd,PatchfaceProphecy,9,Tue Jun 9 10:31:10 2015 UTC,"At least in terms of the war rig, all of its tires were armored from the sides. Early on they show some buzzards trying to cut one open, but the tire armor deflects it. The only time the war rig loses a tire is toward the end when Slit drops some spikes in front of it, and even then it's shown that the tires have a sturdy metal frame inside, so the war rig keeps going strong even after losing part of the tread. I didn't notice it the first time, but if you look at the tire the camera focuses on after the spike drop, you can see a wire mesh where the rubber was torn off. They really think of everything when it comes to making these things unstoppable."

MadMax,391rim,NotGoodAtUser-Names,9,Mon Jun 8 21:03:25 2015 UTC,WITNESSED!
MadMax,391rim,DigitalLauren,32,Mon Jun 8 22:11:16 2015 UTC,"Hi /r/madmax... I turned 40 last week, and my daughter (17yo, art student) painted Nux for me, in that critical moment of his journey when he says ""Witness me"" to Capable.  Nux's story resonated so powerfully with me.  I am a recovering fundamentalist Christian; I used to believe the earth was 6000 years old, that care for an environment destined to be burned up in judgement was pointless... and all kinds of other crazy stuff.  I trained for years within that paradigm - and I was fêted as man with a worldwide ministry.  I could preach in a way that would draw you in, excite you, have you hanging on my every word.  And then I failed, not even spectacularly... but I didn't so much burn-out as fade away.  The details aren't too important.  But the best word you could use to describe the man I turned out to be was, of course...  MEDIOCRE  I hung on in there, like Nux when Capable first discovers him...  for many years.  But gradually, and particularly as my academic study of theology and original biblical languages grew, I outgrew my old-time religion.    I came to realise - and I don't want to bog you down in the theology of it, though it excites me - that the vision of God I had was almost exactly like Immortan Joe.  The version of the Gospel I had preached - the technical name for it is ""Penal Substitutionary Atonement"" - had a God like that, and the ridiculous, evil idea that he was unable to forgive me without sacrificing his own son - a son who stood up to his evil father like a boy who stops his alcoholic dad from beating up his mother.  Over the last few years, I've moved a long, long way from that kind of understanding - to something far, far less toxic.  So... to see Nux escape fundamentalism and his evil god, and to become something better, something none of us could describe as mediocre... well that journey resonated with me, and, knowing that, my daughter gifted me this painting.  I hope you like it; I hope you'll bear with me, world, as I try to be a better person than I used to be; I hope you'll witness me."

She doesn't yet have much confidence in her work so at this point, the fact that she was willing to do this for me, and to allow me to post it here and elsewhere, is a big deal.  She focuses mainly on faces, and eyes in particular, in a lot of her work, so I'm not surprised she aced those areas here (at least I think she did!) and other features will improve with practice I'm sure.  Thanks for your feedback!  Edit: one other factor is that there is no decent resolution still of this image available... she had plenty of other images of Nux available of course but for this exact image, only a very, ahem, low-res source..."

MadMax,394itt,teamtywin,1 point,Tue Jun 9 20:07:26 2015 UTC,"This is exactly the case with me, saw the Dark Knight 4 times and now this.  No regrets, it was so excellent every time.    I picked up a few new details on the fourth go-round as well.  My favorite was that when Max jumps on the chain when trying to escape, and a warboy jumps off after him and falls, you can hear him screaming ""WITNESS"" on the way down.  AWESOME DETAIL!  I think this is actually the first explicit line in the movie that doesn't take place in Max's head.    The 3D was a huge enhancement as well, it brought out the effects in better contrast, especially fire and spark effects.  There are many times in the movie that flamethrowers are being fired and I didn't notice before I saw it in 3D.    Also, it was just me and two other dudes who apparently hadn't seen it before, and they were losing their MINDS!  I kept having to resist the urge to turn around and say ""You think that was cool, WATCH THIS SHIT!"""
MadMax,394itt,imbeciI,1 point,Thu Jun 11 04:59:43 2015 UTC,"I know what you mean about noticing little details! Like on the second watch I realized that Slick says ""Mediocre!"" when the one War Boy kamikazes the Buzzard buggie while everyone else is yelling ""Witness!"" and doing the V8 gesture. I thought he was just being a dick, but on the third watch I realized what this actually says about his character. He says that the War Boy's death is mediocre because he's acting under Furiosa's command, and therefore not an honorable death for the Immortan Joe, so the doors of Valhalla will be closed for him.  It also contrasts with Nux's views of dying honorably, since Nux doesn't even consider this and honors his fellow War Boy's death regardless. The ending definitely shows Nux is looking for something worth giving up what little life he has. He's not a moron, he just wants his death to have meaning."
MadMax,393av3,Zellabell,22,Mon Jun 8 23:15:32 2015 UTC,"Hey, I like your Furiosa theory. It's pretty dark, but it makes sense to me.  I think your co-worker is a bit of an idiot, honestly, if he can't see that the Nux character was a way to cast the War Boys as further victims of Joe's rule.   To be frank, I'm not sure I'd try too hard to rationalize why there are so few women about like Furiosa. It seems totally possible to me for women to gain power in this world (lets not forget Aunty in Thunder Dome). Joe has set up his scene with an apparently radical gender imbalance, and we can chalk it up to his weirdness, or the aesthetic of all those buff/sickly War Boy bods in Miller's imagination. I don't think it makes a great deal of rational sense not to have female War Boys. As Furiosa shows, girls certainly could be doing it. For whatever reason, they're not, but it doesn't mean the movie is casting all men as evil. I think we're meant to sympathize with many of the men, hell even Rictus is a little sympathetic.   Sounds like your co-worker's got some wonky gender politics going on. You don't have to rationalize what's going on in the film to question why the bare fact of female protagonists makes the movie 'made for girls' (guys can't relate to female protagonists?) or why it would be a bad thing even if it were true (are things made for girls shit just for that reason?)."
MadMax,393av3,adventurefine,7,Tue Jun 9 00:10:31 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your reply :)   And I haven't seen the older Mad Max movies yet but want to watch them. And what I more so meant wasn't that it would be impossible for a female to get into a position of power in that world- more so under the rule of immortan Joe. Since like you said there very well could have been some female war boys that were also kick ass but for whatever reason Joe didn't have any- that with him only wanting sons I guess made me think that he may have restricting ideals about gender. And I didn't even really start questioning why Furiosa was the only female of a higher rank until my co-worker said that and then I started over thinking :P  And yup I agree. There are movies targeted towards women that have a male lead but no one complains. (And heck, Mad Max still has a male main character). It's kind of sad if the fact there were more female characters was enough to make someone overlook an epic movie."
MadMax,393av3,crowcrash,6,Tue Jun 9 00:33:00 2015 UTC,"At the end, she mentioned something about redemption, didn't she? My favourite thing about the movie is that they don't go into the gory details of everyone's back story, so I think it's safe to assume that meant that Furiosa was previously an utter bitch to both genders.    I'm wondering if your co-worker even saw the movie, and/or if he's just mimicking what he's heard without forming his own opinion. Since it's relevant, I'm a female, so I may be biased - but I felt that Max and Furiosa had equal footing. They didn't need to show Max doing everything. We know that he is badass - but we needed to know that she could hold her own, too. She's also just an appealing character. Even if her character was male, I would not like the movie any less. In fact, many ladies adore Nux too.    Of a much more personal opinion, I think that the movie using models would not have been a way to appeal to devout feminists, especially when depicting the breeders as, uh.. ""curvy"" ladies."
MadMax,393av3,Imma_boop_you,8,Tue Jun 9 01:28:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah I figured she must have done some pretty bad things in her past for her to want to redeem herself so much.  And yep I'm a girl too and my favourite character was nux :)  And yeah the movie wasn't made specifically to appeal to the crazy type of feminists, but I think a true feminist would appreachiate how the characters were treated... For example I have to admit when I first saw the wives I kinda rolled my eyes thinking ""ok, now we're going to go with whole movie with scenes going out of their way to just to sexualize them"" but I was pleasantly surprised there was none of that. Yes they were very attractive but the movie didn't go out of it's way to shove this in our face (ok, there weren't wearing a lot but there were in the desert). Maybe I'm just jealous but the only actress choice I really didn't like was rosie huntington (something about her just didn't fit... I think it's her lips looked too fake- she's still hot don't get me wrong but just my opinion) but still I liked how she was treated as an actress (was very surprised when she died. Pretty female characters, especially pregnant ones, don't usually die like that in movies. I figured after she fell off the rig they would go back, save her, and by some unbelievable miracle she would give birth to a health baby. But very glad that didn't happen. She didn't get special treatment for being hot- she could die as easily as anyone else.) Sorry for going off topic :P"
MadMax,393av3,MrSiltStrider,9,Tue Jun 9 02:07:43 2015 UTC,"Since it's relevant, I'm a female, so I may be biased - but I felt that Max and Furiosa had equal footing.   Yes - that's what seems to get people talking in my circles. Very few films seem to handle the male-female dynamic in this way, where the male and female characters are total give-and-take. Furiosa was better at some things; Max was better at others.   It's real weird that portraying Furiosa as equal to the main male character would come off to some people as qualifying as a ""girl"" movie."
MadMax,393av3,Imma_boop_you,7,Tue Jun 9 01:33:27 2015 UTC,"(Not person you replied to, but wanted to comment)  I'm also really glad they didn't do the whole ""She's a girl, so we have to make her better at everything than the guys, to show how not-sexist we are"" that a lot of movies with ""strong, independent woman"" protagonists do.  The power relationship between Max and Furiosa felt very natural and realistic, due to the reasons you said."
MadMax,393av3,Imnicepleasefuckme,4,Tue Jun 9 05:36:31 2015 UTC,"Exactly! It's that natural, realistic feeling power dynamic that, in my eyes, elevates Mad Max to a whole other level of film. Such a simple concept (man and woman can be actual equals) seen so little in other films. Whether it's the obvious male rescuing female, or, as you mentioned, the ""hey look we're not sexist"" powerful female that's just better than men at everything."
MadMax,393av3,Teantis,5,Tue Jun 9 06:10:49 2015 UTC,"Since like you said there very well could have been some female war boys that were also kick ass but for whatever reason Joe didn't have any- that with him only wanting sons I guess made me think that he may have restricting ideals about gender.   Could also be a warrior culture thing. Maybe Joe didn't want the war boys to have potential distractions.  But I think women would be too valuable anyway, as they could be used for milk or breeding. Not sure why Furiosa wasn't used for either. Maybe she is unfit to be a breeder because of her arm, either for genetic or cosmetic reasons. And if she was taken when she was young (in the film she says 7000 days, or about 20 years) then she might have been too young to be used for milk.  So maybe she showed promise as a warrior, and Joe raised her as an imperator? I dunno, just shooting in the dark here."
MadMax,393av3,Teantis,4,Tue Jun 9 01:40:12 2015 UTC,Yes I can't wait to find out more about her. She must have been a pretty bad ass kid though for Joe to want to make her an imperator instead of sticking her in a different role
MadMax,393av3,thatguywiththe______,4,Tue Jun 9 02:10:59 2015 UTC,"If the dude can't appreciate a damn good story and world and great characterization because it's ""made for girls"" there's really no reasoning with that I reckon. Everything in the film felt like it arose organically and logically from the initial framework, it wasn't arbitrarily making the women the ""good"". And if he can't think two steps further and realize oh hey maybe furiosa's done some really really terrible shit because how else did she get to become an imperator? And not only that the only female imperator as far as we know, then what can you say to the guy?   Source: I is man"
MadMax,393av3,leonryan,2,Tue Jun 9 14:45:29 2015 UTC,Yes I totally agree. I just really wanted to change his mind but I realized after there's no way to even argue with him :P
MadMax,393av3,ILiveIDieILiveAgain,3,Tue Jun 9 16:59:03 2015 UTC,Also since alien won't let me edit my comment for whatever reason your theory is also what I assumed and seems very natural and logical implication from the story and furiosa's character
MadMax,393av3,CrystalElyse,3,Tue Jun 9 14:46:44 2015 UTC,I thought it fit and there was nothing I can think of to disprove it (not saying it must be true by any means though just that it could be true). I thought it would make her goal of redeeming herself seem even that much more significant.
MadMax,393av3,CrystalElyse,2,Tue Jun 9 17:04:10 2015 UTC,"When Max and her are talking in the war rig, she explains that she was taken as a kid, Max asked her if she's done this before, she said many times. I've always wondered exactly what was meant by that exchange and I think it really supports your theory."
MadMax,393av3,dmasterdyne,11,Wed Jun 10 20:10:14 2015 UTC,i suspect your co-worker is a bit of a moron and feels threatened by women.

It's certainly not the first time something is criticized just because it shows women can have some power too (and not even power, only equal possibilities). We've all been there, right?   I like your Furiosa theory, too! It makes a lot of sense."
MadMax,393av3,IdiotsLantern,6,Tue Jun 9 04:56:52 2015 UTC,"I, personally, assumed that Furiosa was barren, and that's why she wasn't a wife or a milk mother. BUT she knew how to drive, which puts her ahead of a lot of the helpless legions that gather below for water.  She was probably captured for a wife, was found unsuitable for that purpose, but had other skills that found her a place."
MadMax,393av3,skonen_blades,8,Tue Jun 9 01:13:41 2015 UTC,"True, but wasn't she a little kid when she was captured? So it's not liked they noticed the driving skills then. I could totally believe that she was barren... they may not have found out through until she got older and started to develop though maybe? (I'm not sure if there is ways to tell when a girl is only a child if she will be barren??) So unless her mother taught her to drive as a child someone in the Citadel would have had to teach her, no? They left us with a lot to guess at with not many clues."
MadMax,393av3,chenobble,4,Tue Jun 9 01:22:23 2015 UTC,"She was 7 at the time she was captured. Also, the Vulvalini functioned differently at the time, so maybe she didn't learn from them. But she may have had more freedom when younger (she's much older than all of the other wives, so perhaps she was one of the first ones taken?) perhaps she was friends with the warboys who taught her things? Perhaps she just had a natural talent? That part I will admit that I'm much less sure of.   The barren thing I feel like they wouldn't have figured out until puberty. Perhaps she may have never started cycling, or only cycled rarely, or maybe after a year or two of trying she just never became pregnant. But, for some reason, I just really believe that she is."

MadMax,392vzu,Imnicepleasefuckme,3,Mon Jun 8 23:28:43 2015 UTC,Same.
MadMax,392vzu,jumpyg1258,2,Tue Jun 9 00:10:10 2015 UTC,I thought he was referring to whatever happened to him that we did not see before the movie that required him to get a fill up of fresh raging crazy blood.
MadMax,392vzu,TheHorselessHeadsman,4,Tue Jun 9 18:08:11 2015 UTC,"I could be wrong, but my impression is that they just need the blood because of the illness(es) they live with and that nothing actually happened to him to cause him to lose blood. They're just all sick and dying and need to keep having blood transfusions regularly."

I remember watching this documentary on Bond girls once and without fail each Bond girl said ""And unlike those other girls, I was a BADASS not just there to look pretty"" ... it's hard to believe after awhile.

All this in addition to being completely unmarked by the warboys. You know why women and men arn't mixed frequently in the american and other militaries? Because they get raped. It's a serious issue. even with all the discipline, thickheads will be thickheads, being a woman in the military can be a legitimate risk. Plus, many people in the military are just outright misogynistic. I've never met a female drill sergeant in my life because a lot of marines just shrug girls off because ""i don't have to listen to you, you're a woman.""  If this is how risky it is to be a woman in the most well trained, well funded military on earth, can you imagine how awful it would be to be with a pack of crazy, drugged up teenagers who live off of death?  Now, I could understand her if she used to be like a milk mother or a breeding girl, but was rescued by the crazy ass old lady bikers and now wants to do the same for other people. I can get that; that's a point of logic and sympathy. No-one wants to be abused. But apparently she's such a srong innepenent blak womyn who donneed no man the crazy ass psycos respect her or something? There isn't a fucking minority quota in immortan joe's army. She's there just because the director wanted a ""strong woman""  but had no idea  how to write one. He didn't realize that the amazon biker ladies were excellent examples of strong women and I really fucking liked their characters."
MadMax,392maj,Turbofurball,5,Tue Jun 9 12:57:40 2015 UTC,"I don't think you understand the meaning of the term sexualised.  Also, there are military forces where women and men serve alongside one another. America is not the world."
MadMax,392maj,PrivateHazzard,3,Tue Jun 9 13:10:22 2015 UTC,"What's funny is, the movie actually shows us why Furiosa would have a high rank in Immortan Joe's army.  She's smart (smarter than he is!) and tough, she can drive, shoot, fight, negotiate with outsiders, and strategize.  Anyone would want her on their side.  Rejecting her because she has boobs and a pretty face would just be stupid.  But PrivateHazzard is too dim-witted to see that."

We've had problems with them recruiting impressionable young women, too.  You don't appear to be following your own logic on your previous points, what were you trying to say again? Have you redefined the word sexualisation? Because what you posted above doesn't appear to have much of a relationship to that word."

And I'm sure they're seen as equals and are totally enjoying their position.   So, I do know what sexualization is, and part of my point was her ""strong girl attitude"" was sexualized. There are men that like tomboyish, brash, ""tough"" women, and that's who furiosa was appealing to."
MadMax,392maj,PrivateHazzard,2,Tue Jun 9 15:29:28 2015 UTC,"Just because men find her attractive (it's Charlize Theron, ffs) doesn't mean she was sexualized.  Furiosa doesn't do ONE sexual thing in the movie."

So do you feel that Tom Hardy was exploited in a sexualised way too, then?   I mean, he had a strong guy attitude, and the way the camera kept lingering on his tight butt and naked chest it was obviously made to attract gay men to watch. /s"

I mean, he had a strong guy attitude, and the way the camera kept lingering on his tight butt and naked chest it was obviously made to attract gay men to watch. /s   So you're implying they didn't pick him because he isn't AT ALL appealing to either women or men who want to be him?

MadMax,392maj,LegionofDoom12,1 point,Tue Jun 9 14:10:14 2015 UTC,"It's pretty hard for a woman to get visible upper body muscles without the right diet and right training. Charlize Theron mentioned in an interview that she had to put on weight. I have to admit that I was kind of startled by that, because I didn't think she looked that strong.  But I guess I'm just used to the looks of pole dancers, they need to have strong upper body muscles, they need to be able to pull and hold their own weight for a long time. Furiosa doesn't. Why do you think she used weapons to defend herself against Max? I don't think she needs to look very muscular to make her strenghts believable. I believe she is strong, but I also believe she is smart enough to figure out that someone like Max is physically stronger than her and she wouldn't stand a chance fighting him, so she goes for the gun..."
MadMax,392maj,PrivateHazzard,2,Tue Jun 9 15:31:01 2015 UTC,"It's a myth that the apparent size of muscles or having a ""cut"" look has anything to do with strength.  E.g. teenage figure skaters are often little tiny things with not much visible muscle but obviously they are very strong  I'd say Furiosa and Max were about equal in terms of physical strength and fighting skill, which is cool.  I dig the equality/partnership vibe they had going."
MadMax,392maj,LOLMaster0621,1 point,Tue Jun 9 15:50:17 2015 UTC,"Theron mentioned in an interview that she had to put on weight.    Good. She needed more.   they need to be able to pull and hold their own weight for a long time. Furiosa doesn't.   So she's in the military but shouldn't be able to do pull ups? Upper body strength is crucial for handling weapons, cars, punches...   I also believe she is smart enough to figure out that someone like Max is physically stronger than her and she wouldn't stand a chance fighting him, so she goes for the gun...   But of course. But the girl's a soldier, she has to look the part. Knock out a couple of teeth, add some scars, give her warts, boils, flame scars, puncture wounds ext. You ever seen a bare-knuckle boxer's face? You can literally see the knuckle marks. She's too damn pretty. I can't get the one scene where the camera zooms in on her perfect, braces tended, pearly white, non-cavitated teeth. It's just so damn unfitting. Hell, even in modern society with toothbrushes and toothpaste people loose teeth. I don't know if she had a movie she had to get to after this, but they needed to absolutely kick the shit out of her to make her look the part. Sunburns, sand scars, tan, everything."
MadMax,392maj,PrivateHazzard,1 point,Tue Jun 9 15:51:21 2015 UTC,"Given that we don't know anythingy about Furiosas past you can't make assumptions based on how you think she has to look.  Look, I get what you're saying and white perfect teeth are not only an issue in this movie, I'll give you that, but I'm neither a dentist, nor do I know how Furiosa looks naked. So how do you know she's not covered in in scars where you don't even want to see one? Also, as far as I know (somebody correct me if I'm wrong please) the scars the War Boys have are self inflicted, e.g. Nux' engine. So take off the tumors and the white paint and a War Boy would look rather healthy.  And I don't believe a fighter has to neccessarily look the part, at least not a good one. Take Ronda Rousey for example..."

She is a warboy in all but gender. She does not look like a warboy. SHE IS TOO PRETTY.   So how do you know she's not covered in in scars where you don't even want to see one?   Because people aim for the face. You saw the movie. You saw the flames, the bullets, the impacts, the spikes... How could NOTHING touch her face? I don't even box and I have chin scars.   scars the War Boys have are self inflicted, e.g. Nux' engine   You are wrong there I'm afraid. That is a tatoo, however nux has cuts on his face, head, lips ext as well as several easy to see tumors.   So take off the tumors and the white paint and a War Boy would look rather healthy.   It's established early on in the movie that the war boys are all suffering from advanced leukemia and cysts. Look up the wiki article for more info.

It's not an opinion- your extremely bias. I don't comment on this sub (this movie is right there with The Dark Knight for me), but i keep seeing 3 or 4 of the same people talking shit (which is fine) but your just in the wrong Sub. Im not going to go over to r/starwars and say ""Hey guys- Just saying i think the whole """"Im your Father"""" reveal was so blatant and on the nose that it took me out of the film."" Put a fucking sock it in bro. Furiosa's my (and the fan's in general) shit and Charlize DESTROYED that role. My gf and all her friends seriously call her there hero now (my gf could care less about action films- what these ladies are seeing is a strong woman that they look up to, that defies men and weather and war alike to get what she wants). I can tell your a male so i understand that you can't put yourself in a females shoes, but i will say that she is the strongest female since Sarah Connor in T2. Also- False expectation leads to failed relationships. Your relationship with this film was severed as soon as Charlize's body wasn't ""up to snuff"" (omfg your sexist..... That's really your main problem guy.)  Side note- I can't name ONE fucking MALE ISIS member..... Im glad you know so much about there infrastructure?

MadMax,392maj,teaqualizer,2,Wed Jun 10 00:26:17 2015 UTC,"For one, we don't know that Furiosa was a soldier for the entire time that Joe had her. We only know that she was abducted when she was young, and that by the beginning of Fury Road, she had become an Imperator of Joe's army. Additionally, it is much more difficult for women to build muscle, because of their lack of testosterone, which is what allows it to be so much easier for men to build and tone muscles. Not saying it's impossible. Now, with that established: We can infer that Furiosa, like the rest of Joe's army,  did a lot more driving than actual hand-to-hand fighting. Assuming she was just driving, with minimal hand-to-hand fighting and other activities that require continuous muscle strain, why would she have toned muscles?  For the second thing you said, for one thing, it had nothing to do with the sentence you quoted from me. Obviously Furiosa did have something happen to her, hence the missing arm. Also, she could very well have many, many scars under her clothing, since she is very well covered.   Now, to finish this up, your definition of sexualization is skewed. You are assuming that any beautiful woman who is not made to be less beautiful is being sexualized. That is not what it means. Sexualization is when a woman is shown as a sex object, only used for her sexual appeal, which is clearly not what is happening here.  Thanks for debating with me, it's good to be able to brush up on my debate skills."

The Wretched? A milk mother? Breeding stock?   Not saying it's impossible.   Which makes it odd that furiosa has none. I mean, let's be honest, she's got NOTHING. Hell, I'm a scrawny ass white boy and I got more than she does.   why would she have toned muscles?   For the same reason that in order to join the USAF you are put through boot camp.   Also, she could very well have many, many scars under her clothing, since she is very well covered.   But none on her face, none on her teeth, and I'm gonna be honest, the missing limb was for style points. You know how easy it is to green screen a limb out? That was for cool factor.   Sexualization is when a woman is shown as a sex object, only used for her sexual appeal, which is clearly not what is happening here.   But she IS for a certain sex appeal. The ""don't need no man"" tough girl appeal. IS she walking around in a bikini? No. And THANK GOD. But it is still sexual, in a different way. I will say, right now, that it isn't as drawn out as it could be. And THANK FUCK FOR THAT. Can you even imagine? The biker gimps were enough. But I have no reason to think that she wasn't made female just because the director wanted a ""strong female lead"". And this doesn't refute my point about how literally everyone around her is misogynistic as fuck and yet she hasn't been challenged by anyone yet.   And you're welcome I guess?"
MadMax,392maj,teaqualizer,5,Wed Jun 10 01:15:22 2015 UTC,"I also tried and tried to get people to see it. Only people I got to go besides me is because I took them and paid.

MadMax,392maj,phosphenTrip,3,Mon Jun 8 21:04:08 2015 UTC,I think that there's a lot of people out there that want to see it but the age rating has a huge impact. If they'd went for a PG 13 cert it would have made a lot more money. If furious 7 or Ultron were r rated they'd be in the same boat as Mad Max.  If those two ladies you were trying to convince have seen furious 7 then I don't know what to think
MadMax,392maj,phosphenTrip,1 point,Mon Jun 8 20:43:24 2015 UTC,However making it PG13 would have taken away from Fury Road significantly.
MadMax,392maj,skonen_blades,3,Tue Jun 9 11:43:36 2015 UTC,Possibly but I think it's closer to a pg 13 movie than a full blown r rated movie. The violence is minimal and suggestive rather than explicit. There's only one instance of swearing I can think of. It's essentially the partial nudity that's swung it into the r rated category. You don't see any actual nipples but it seems that any shot that even implies the possibility that women might have nipples is enough to get the censors backs up.
MadMax,392maj,phosphenTrip,1 point,Tue Jun 9 11:52:10 2015 UTC,"Absolutely, and the decisions of what to include are there for their artistic merit ... compromising any part for censors would have dented the can, and it makes those tiny moments all the more important!"

MadMax,392maj,phosphenTrip,7,Tue Jun 9 02:29:50 2015 UTC,"I think some people are story-deaf.  (I just coined that phrase.  Ha!)  Like tone-deaf, only with stories.  They just don't ""get"" that in a story (a good one, anyway) everything is there for a reason, every detail tells you something about the world of the story, the characters, themes.  And they have NO ability to connect the story to anything going on in our real lives.  I actually know people who think 1984 and Brave New World are just books they make you read in high school.    So when they go to see a movie like Mad Max they are only watching it superficially, without realizing they are doing so.  The Doof Warrior is an awesome expression of the values of the Mad Max world, but to the viewer who doesn't even understand that the movie is showing them a world, the Doof Warrior is just odd."
MadMax,392maj,skonen_blades,3,Tue Jun 9 02:42:26 2015 UTC,"That reminds me of a (smart, film nerd) friend who didn't understand Wall-E at all. He just couldn't understand a story that wasn't based on dialogue.  I think the same is true of my friends' underwhelming responses to Fury Road."
MadMax,392maj,phosphenTrip,2,Tue Jun 9 11:47:35 2015 UTC,Oh jeez.  Wall-E is not that hard to get.  We are more or less living it now.
MadMax,392maj,phosphenTrip,2,Tue Jun 9 11:49:12 2015 UTC,"He could follow what was happening, but the romance between EVE and Wall-E was entirely lost on him. All of the subtleties, background detail, emotional investment, etc, didn't enter his peripheral vision."
MadMax,392maj,skonen_blades,3,Tue Jun 9 11:54:31 2015 UTC,I think some people equate 'talking' with 'story'.  I've noticed this in a few of my friends as well.  They didn't care about any of the characters in MM because none of the characters talked very much.  It was strange to have those conversations.
MadMax,392maj,skonen_blades,2,Tue Jun 9 16:05:08 2015 UTC,"I may be guilty of that but I have two points: I am a novice to the mad max world. I spoke to my friends after who knew about the mad max series and explained a few things about it. I think for novices it did do a poor job on the story, and was not helped by the poor dialogue. E.g. the monologue in the beginning was out of touch and when the main actress and Max were talking, her saying she's in this for ""redemption"" didn't cut it for me. It was hard to connect with the characters because their actions didn't win me over. I couldn't connect with the traitor when the redhead touched him. It felt artificial, and a bit too easy to be won over if you ask me.  Also, yes, it's a post apocalyptic world, and the wives are trying to escape this milotary ruler. Simple enough. So the story was basic, and the characters were hard to connect to, so what was left was cinematography and the cool world itself. These were great, but not enough for me."
MadMax,392maj,Turbofurball,2,Tue Jun 9 21:15:06 2015 UTC,"Um, she (a woman) has risen to the rank of Imperator, gets to drive a war rig, and lead a team of men.  Under the rule of a violent man, in a violent world.  So, there is a 100% chance she has seen and done some fucked up shit.  (As she says, she has done this ""many times"".)  How do you think she got her fighting and shooting skills, if not from actual hard-won bloody experience?  That's what she needs redemption for, and it's not hard to figure out."
MadMax,392maj,Solas67,1 point,Tue Jun 9 22:42:39 2015 UTC,"Hard to figure out, no. Interesting in any way, no either.I didn't care about the fact that shes been through this because it didn't seem like she had a chip on the shoulder, and most of the movie didn't care/focus about her past, so why should I? and she has one arm but other than that seemed pretty much in great condition and didn't seem to have many battle scars, which also takes away from feeling for her"
MadMax,392maj,bryanlharris,1 point,Tue Jun 9 22:51:11 2015 UTC,That's dumb.
MadMax,392maj,bryanlharris,1 point,Tue Jun 9 22:52:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah I've heard something similar.  'Redemption' for me spun my mind off into a whole bunch of 'what if' scenarios about WHY she needed redemption and I loved that.  I didn't exactly get tears in my eyes when Capable showed Nux some compassion but I like that it didn't go SURPRISE he knifes her or SURPRISE she throws him off the truck or SURPRISE she gets a grapling hook through the chest from a bad guy on the back of the truck we didn't see until now.  It was just an earnest show of affection and that really stood out for me.  I am curious about people experience of it as a novice.  The previous three movies can pretty much be summed up as ""Max's wife and child died and the world ended now everything's really screwed up.  The end."" so for me, it was set up just fine but I've seen the previous three movies so I can't really say for sure.  I think the premise was simple but I think the story had some ups and downs and ins and outs.  The canyon motorcycle gang betrayal was a surprise to me, the green place straight-up not being there was a surprise to me, them turning around and going BACK to the citadel was a surprise to me.  I'm not disagreeing with you.  It's just interesting to hear different viewpoints.  It definitely had a lot of action and the dialogue was sparse but I found the words to be chosen with extreme care and attention to detail that hinted at a much larger world.  I appreciated the lack of unnecessary dialogue.  Like some downtime monologue about where she got her arm or some expository flashback about how Joe rose to power.  I was relieved that wasn't in the story.  But after talking to a few people that had a similar experience to yours, I imagine that might have improved the experience for some."
MadMax,392maj,2Weird2Live2Rare2Die,1 point,Tue Jun 9 21:29:40 2015 UTC,"Thanks for that. I do agree that the story did have its ups and downs and was not as bland as I made it seem. When we find out the Green Place wasn't there anymore I was pretty concerned and thought they were done for. I agree I thought it was good that they didnt have unnecessary dialogue,  but I'll take the extreme stance and say they could have used even less dialogue. Many parts in the car had some dialogje that didnt help the story or the characters I felt. But yeah, you're right that there was more to the story. Id say for me I didn't like it that much because I'm just not into action movies, and even this movie with its plusses, didnt do it for me either."
MadMax,392maj,PastryChefSniper,1 point,Tue Jun 9 22:43:40 2015 UTC,"Wow, even less dialogue.  Wild.  That would have been so extreme.  Now I want to see a version of it with no dialogue at all.  That would have been amazing if it worked.  Ha ha.  That's really something to think about.  George Miller did say in an interview somewhere that he wanted it to work regardless of whether or not you understood the dialogue.  I'm curious as to how it'll do overseas in different languages."
MadMax,392maj,PrivateHazzard,2,Wed Jun 10 00:15:25 2015 UTC,"Haha that would be really cool to see. Honestly I think it could be done. And yeah, in response to a different comment of yours, I agree, the movie failed to connect me with the characters, specifically me. I'm just trying to say that I'm an example of someone who was told to watch it even if I don't like action movies and I didn't love it like most people. I'd rather the Dark Knight"

MadMax,392maj,PrivateHazzard,1 point,Tue Jun 9 22:56:19 2015 UTC,"But you think it should have included more info on Furiosa's past, in addition to what the audience could figure out on its own?"
MadMax,392maj,Turbofurball,1 point,Tue Jun 9 23:02:59 2015 UTC,"They both had an awkward amount of time devoted to their pasts. They either should have worked with it into the plot and actually have their past catch up to them either through a familiar foe or a struggle with her one arm or something as opposed to unnecessary hallucinations thrown in every time he fights just so it looks cool, OR just not bring up those details  at all. At the end of the day, the movie was 90% action, and your main point is that even ppl who don't watch action movies should love this. I'm saying, that's not true because of a lack of connection to the characters and the fact that most of the movie was one long action sequence, aside from the parts where they attempted (and failed) to get you to care about these characters and objectives."
MadMax,392maj,PrivateHazzard,2,Tue Jun 9 23:19:50 2015 UTC,"Well, attempted (and failed) with you.  I cared about them quite a bit.  But to each their own."
MadMax,392maj,Turbofurball,1 point,Wed Jun 10 00:12:21 2015 UTC,"OK so a major deal in storytelling is ""show not tell"".  Another major deal is ""actions speak louder than words"".  That means true character is revealed through choices under difficult circumstances.  So we have plenty of opportunities to connect with the characters by seeing who they really are by the choices they make.  In a well-written story, action IS character."
MadMax,392maj,PrivateHazzard,1 point,Tue Jun 9 23:26:22 2015 UTC,Oh I don't know.  I liked the hallucinations.  They made Mad Max 'mad'.  They showed just how crazy his mind is 24/7.  But I can dig that people might not have liked them.

But there's any number of ways you could play the scenario out.   If you want to boil Mad Max down to the bulletpoints, I think you would say it has to have:  1. Vehicular action  2. Real personalities for all the characters, even if we only get a glimpse of them, an impression must be made  3. The tribes need to make sense, be they heroic or villainous, and even on the side of the villains, you need characters more than cartoons. See 2.  4. Explicit worldbuilding done in the writing but most of it is implicit in the film, not lampshaded. Things make sense if you look at it, if you pay attention, but it's not all spelled out 5. General sensibility of pushing the wild and woolly edge. It's grim but exciting post-apocalypse rather than grim and not fun like the Road.   Waterworld had so much potential to be good, a Mad Max Upon the Water. Pretty much every one of those points above were ignored which resulted in the waterlogged, soggy mess that was that film."
MadMax,394jju,jollyreaper2112,2,Tue Jun 9 19:55:02 2015 UTC,MM1 would be somewhere with small towns and big plains. Ohio? MM2 needs a desert and a refinery. Texas? MM3 needs desert near to oasis.

MadMax,3937g4,DeliciousToastie,3,Tue Jun 9 14:41:52 2015 UTC,"I've read that Max's character has some of the same fundamental character traits/archetypes as an on-screen Samurai, so that's a positive for that market."

MadMax,391igb,MojaveMilkman,4,Mon Jun 8 18:47:47 2015 UTC,"Sounds a bit like Fallout: New Vegas. Humanity is trying to put civilisation back together, but it's still nowhere near a proper civilised community. It's still the wild west and the rule of law isn't very strong. On top of everything else, the organised communities and nations are now warring with each other.  Every facet of the Mojave's culture comes together to make an extremely interesting conflict."
MadMax,391igb,KingofMadCows,6,Mon Jun 8 16:29:04 2015 UTC,"A major focus in the Fallout franchise is on how humanity is rebuilding after the apocalypse. Even in Fallout 1, which takes place around 80 years after the apocalypse, there were several self sufficient towns, there was trade between the various settlements, people were trying to rediscover pre-war technology, and there were even upstart trading companies. They even had an established currency backed by water merchants.  In Fallout 2, the New California Republic had spread across a big chunk of California. They had electricity, they had government, they had scientists and teachers, they were able to make a lot of pre-war technology, and they had hundreds of thousands of citizens."
MadMax,391igb,neko_ceko,3,Mon Jun 8 17:25:26 2015 UTC,"I'm new to the series as of Fallout 3, never played the prior installments. What struck me is that even from an environmental perspective, it looks like WWIII happened yesterday instead of 200 years ago. You'd think that the greenery would have recovered in some places.   I loved the setting and mood and wished they made Fallout 3 a little more concentrated. They had to spread the story across the wasteland and also allow for branching plotlines (destroy megaton and be a baddie, stay in megaton as a goodie) and so the individual stories wound up a bit thin. I would have been stoked if my whole story was just making a home in Megaton and helping get the place fixed up, increase the population and make it a shining beacon of civilization. That's a different story from what the creators wanted to tell.   The funny thing with many of the scientist-types, they seemed to have such pre-war mentalities. I could buy their characters if this was 5 to 10 years after the end but it seems funny to think that they have never known anything other than the post-apocalypse but can remain such squares. I guess if they're vaultdwellers that could explain it, they really are living in a pre-war culture.   I'm curious to see where they're going with 4."
MadMax,391igb,KingofMadCows,3,Mon Jun 8 18:38:07 2015 UTC,"Fallout 3 is the only one that diverges like that. Almost all of the Capital Wasteland is still a huge shithole with no real progress. My explanation is that, because it was the capital, it was hit the worst in the war. So it kinda makes sense that it would take the longest to recover. Everyone who could almost certainly did get out of there. The people that remain are just barely scraping by. Well, most of them."

There was actually some disagreement between Bethesda and Obsidian, which actually had a bunch of people who made the original games, about how much civilization and how developed the civilization was supposed to be. Obsidian wanted the civilized areas to be more developed so there'd be a bigger contrast between the major settlements and the wilderness of the Mojave Desert."

As far as open world games go, my favorite has been Red Dead Redemption. Very not buggy, few glitches to remind me I'm playing  a game.   Was NV worth the effort?

MadMax,391igb,ThirstyOne,1 point,Tue Jun 9 15:51:58 2015 UTC,"Thankfully, modern modding is pretty easy, even for a newbie modder. My source of choice for (most) mods is Nexus Mods. They have their own mod-manager, Nexus Mod Manager (NMM for short) that will when installed auto detect your installed games that it supports (of which there are quite a bunch, including New Vegas and FO3).   Steam also has its own mod distro section as well, I'm not as familiar with it, but you can ""subscribe"" to mods and they will automatically install and update (if the mod author does an update) for you. I'm not sure if some of my favourite mods are on Steam mods.  Then there are some mods neither mod manager are able to install for you, but most gamers find indispensable. New Vegas Script Extender, Fallout Script Extender (for Fallout 3) and (in another genre) Skyrim Script Extender are all made by the same team of programmers, and add a bunch of awesome extra script enhancements to the default engines of each game, allowing other modders to do some really cool stuff, like Project Nevada's sprint key function, or Nevada Skies' dynamic weather effects. NVSE is pretty easy to install if you read the readme and follow the step-by-step that comes with it.  One other mod I would suggest that isn't able to be installed by your mod manager of choice is New Vegas 4GB - it's a patch that will allow FNV.exe to access up to 4GB of virtual memory (unlike vanilla which has, I think, a 2GB cap). The vanilla cap can be really crippling on your performance, especially with a pile of mods that are graphics or script intensive.   I'll give a shout-out to /r/FalloutMods, which has several how-to articles on how to get into modding FO3 and FNV (and soon, FO4!), along with a great team of mods and subscribers who can help you with figuring out proper load order (and what load order is!) and giving mod recommendations and suggestions, so you can tailor your Fallout experience to best suit your tastes. (I for one, prefer it much more dangerous and hardcore than even Hardcore mode can provide. Thankfully, there are mods for that!)  This has gone waaay off topic for the thread's purpose so I'll call it short here, but I hope you give the games a chance (they're really good) and don't be too scared of modding. Certain mods are incompatible with each other, but mod authors are typically really good about pointing out incompatibilities (especially with popular mods), so you can avoid them, or figure out which mod among several that do similar things you prefer."

MadMax,391igb,eff1ngham,2,Tue Jun 9 19:13:08 2015 UTC,"I think it could work. The first Mad Max takes place before the apocalypse. Max still has an actual, paying job and civilization hasn't totally collapsed yet.  I could see a film that's about trying to build a society working, but I'm not sure that they would go that direction. Max doesn't really care for people. Even when he gets emotionally attached to a group, he still returns to the road once he's finally helping them.  I have no idea what the next MM film is going to be about. I don't know if anything's been said about it or not, but I would love to see the Citadel again. But I know this isn't going to happen since the end of Fury Road shows him leaving it behind and that kind of follows how all the MM films are. He's a loner and every film is in a new place with him reluctantly helping new people.   Besides I think it would be really hard to go back to the Citadel now, because Fury Road is meant to have a happy ending what with the overthrowing of an evil dictator, etc, but the Citadel would be a giant mess after the death of Immortan Joe.  In the wasteland you need an army to protect yourself. The Citadel has its half-life war boys and the half-lives need full-life blood in order to live.  Under Immortan Joe's rule they were just taking the blood, but the Immortan is dead now and Furiosa and the wives have this whole thing about people being free and no one owning anyone else, so there goes using full-lives for their blood against their will.  The new leadership is going to have to either come up with some ethical source for a lot of human blood or let most of the half-life population that they need to keep the Citadel running die.  The only quick and easy way I can think of off the top of my head to make this work would be a blood tax. Any full-lives who want to live in the Citadel have to pay for food and water with a certain amount of blood.  I kind of got way off-track there, but I would think that the next film will be kind of the same. I am interested to see what Max does about getting a car in the next movie, though, since Slit pretty much thoroughly destroyed the Interceptor."
MadMax,391igb,eff1ngham,3,Mon Jun 8 16:58:34 2015 UTC,"Miller says he's got ideas so I'd trust him sooner than some Hollywood hired gun coming at the next film.   I don't think it would be hard going back to the Citadel because, even with most of their forces gone, they're still one of the biggest regional powers we've seen. I think you could have a hell of a story there as things are being put back together.   Corpus (the deformed guy at the telescope) is supposed to be pretty bright. There's a lot of complicated stuff keeping everyone alive there, stuff that has to be maintained. And I'd wager it gives them an advantage over any barbarian band of raiders who are literally having to raid to survive. Note that food, water, fuel, all of that is being manufactured right now, not scavenged. Raiding is no longer required to keep the economy going. And raiding pretty much requires a larger, stable society to mooch off of or else you run out of loot real quick.   I think Furiosa's story is pretty much separate from Max's at this point unless fate slams them back together. That's fine. She can have her own movie. Max can keep doing his own thing.   The setting is so ripe for stories to tell, so many areas to explore, you'd be hard-pressed to mine it out."
MadMax,391igb,Bestpaperplaneever,1 point,Mon Jun 8 18:23:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah. I would love to see more of the Citadel and Furiosa, but it's a little premature yet to be thinking about spin-off films like one about her.  My guess would be any new MM films would follow the example set by the first three, as in they'll follow him and be pretty much completely unrelated to one another. I would love to be wrong, though."

Every Mad Max movie is a retelling of the same story, as communicated (and mutated) through oral tradition through many generations.  There may be a meta-timeline you can infer, where each version of the story has elements that reflect the world of the teller (or, more likely, the teller's conceptions of the world a few generations prior), as distance from the apocalypse grows.  But there are common elements that seem to stick to the story.  Not every element in every version, but in varying combinations and roles:   The music box The tanker chase The rescued innocents The town with resources The initially-hostile feral child who helps Max Master Blaster (/ Immortan Joe's sons) The Interceptor Max himself The pilot (""different character"" played by the same actor between 2 and 3)   etc."

MadMax,390tps,Bestpaperplaneever,3,Tue Jun 9 22:31:45 2015 UTC,"The beauty of the way they phrase it is a few years from the time the movie takes place, it doesn't specify that the movie takes place in at the current date.    Also I don't believe there's any mention of a nuclear meltdown in Japan in Fury Road, unless you can enlighten me as to which scene you're referring to?  Edit: did you mean the chant they do when hooking up the war rig?  I think that's more along the lines of a military ""boot camp"" like song. I don't believe it has an actual bearing on the war boys since, IIRC the meltdown didnt actually hurt anyone"
MadMax,390tps,eff1ngham,2,Wed Jun 10 03:11:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but why would they be mentioning Fukushima if nothing interesting happened there in their timeline?  As far as I can tell, none of the vehicles in Fury Road are newer than the late 70s or early 80s. The Doof Wagon is the most recent vehicle, I believe. Then again, cybernetic limbs didn't exist until the mid 00s or so."
MadMax,390tps,Bestpaperplaneever,1 point,Wed Jun 10 17:18:41 2015 UTC,"It certainly is interesting.  I'll be honest the first three times I've watched the movie I never put those two things together.  I don't quite know why they'd use that in their chant.  I actually think the newest vehicle in the movie is the MAN KAT that the Buzzards have (the one with the excavator attached to the back).  However it's been mentioned before that any kind of newer vehicle would be ill-advised due to the need for electronics or for maintenance reasons.  Most of the cars in the fleet are custom built and using an old 70s V8 on essentially a frame makes more sense for a mechanic's standpoint.  One last note about Furiosa's arm.  It's not cybernetic.  You can see the cable that runs up the arm to the shoulder and you can see that it's strapped around her waist as well.  There have been prosthetic limbs around for centuries.  Hers is most likely controlled with body motions of her upper arm and torso.  If you look closely you can actually see it's made up of a lot of spare parts as well (the main forearm is actually a giant wrench), which is pretty cool :)"

There are a few other vehicles in the fleet that are late 80s, they just don't get much screen time (mostly when they all show up to the fallen rocks, and then again when they get stuck in the bog)"

Well armed and equipped, they evacuated from the coast area further into the outback, marauding and pillaging resources from survivors.

Plus, the War Boys don't just drive around aimlessly in the wasteland. They get sent to raid and salvage. At the beginning of the movie, they attacked Max, captured him and stole his V8 Interceptor.

MadMax,38zo4t,DIABEETICHONEYBADGER,3,Mon Jun 8 05:39:57 2015 UTC,Except when its a big low RPM engine. You did notice the tach didnt go much over 5k right?
MadMax,38zo4t,Broken_Goat,1 point,Mon Jun 8 06:03:17 2015 UTC,but there keeping it at 5k if that's the rpm of both engines added together that wouldn't be bad but if there using 5k on each engine for the entire time they're trying to run that's a lot.
MadMax,38zo4t,DIABEETICHONEYBADGER,5,Mon Jun 8 06:23:46 2015 UTC,"No its not....the engines can take it...but obviously their radiator isnt up to the task. I have the same issue with my battle wagons. I can and have run at 5k rpm for hours on end. However it has a 3 core radiator and other mods. The other one has a stock radiator and can only sustain 5k rpm in short burst. About 15 minutes at a time. Which...if you watch the war rig, it overheats the same kind of way. Burst of speed and power, then they have to back off and let it cool.   Any modified engine can last long periods of time. If you notice on most high performance engines, they either die from oil starvation or overheating. So, while admittedly they are causing undue stress to the engines by constantly overheating them...the RPM alone wont kill them.   Iron block V8s are amazingly resilient as well. I had a 78 LTD I pulled out of the woods for my first car. The radiator was so clogged, the car would peg the temp gauge at 240* and continue getting hot enough to where the engine just wouldnt run. After cooling down, it was fine. Eventually I cleaned out the radiator and continued to drive that car for several more years, usually beating the crap out of it. It lived at high RPM and sounded glorious."

MadMax,38zo4t,starkimus,2,Tue Jun 9 03:26:33 2015 UTC,"Sure. It all depends on how its set up. I know they built a custom transmission to link the two chevy 502s in the giggahorse together. Probably a custom system that just joined them up to a regular mass produced transmission.   As for the war rig, I could design some kind of crazy over complicated connecting system to make them work seperately like in the movie...but FROM WHAT IVE FOUND SO FAR is that there was only one engine in it.   Now...if it was me, and I really wanted a way to disconnect and shut down one engine at a time. Id use a one way clutch on the back of the motors, like a ratchet uses. The second engine would be higher then the first one, to allow a drive shaft to pass from the front engine to the transmission where the clutch would be. Of course it would have to be supported rather stoutly. Then Id have a strong sprocket and chain connecting the 2nd motor down to that shaft. The one way ratcheting clutches on the back would allow either motor to be shut down independently.   Another way would be to have the clutches on the back of each motor and just use hydraulics to move them like on most modern manual transmissions. Then the ratchets and chain drive.   It would be fairly complicated, but would be reliable if kept simple.   Connecting multiple engines together isnt a new thing. It started getting popular in tractor pulls in the 80s. They'll connect 2,3,4,5,6, sometimes 8 V8 engines together. Sometimes 2 v12s, 3-4 jet engines.....it gets pretty crazy. Heres a little idea. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFHR_5vv5a4"
MadMax,38zo4t,Broken_Goat,7,Tue Jun 9 03:57:00 2015 UTC,Gas Town is a refinery and they are not just making Guzzoline.  That can at least reasonably answer most of your petrol/lubricant questions.   Bullet Town is not a Remington factory.  Its sits on a lead mine. Depending on what else may be there in terms of metal production is it possible though a stretch to think that other metals are there to that some alloys could be produced and made into vehicle parts.  They would obviously be custom for the most part or at least within custom families but its not in the realm of ridiculousness to consider if you are unable to simply suspend you disbelief and enjoy the movie.  Everyone is paying tribute to or has formed a partnership with Joe because he controls the water and in crunch time the Citadel looks very self contained and defensible if everyone just stays put.    Discussing the feasibility of apocalypse scenarios is all what if conjecture.  There are potentials for reality within the over the top Mad Max world.

MadMax,38zo4t,Osmodius,4,Tue Jun 9 04:38:57 2015 UTC,"One of the times when suspension of disbelief is the only really believable answer.  I mean sure, the Citadel can maybe maintain and produce some of the stuff required, but I don't believe they're capable of producing motor oil, brake fluid etc. etc."
MadMax,38zo4t,copperwatt,2,Mon Jun 8 09:34:34 2015 UTC,I assumed those things came from the refinery industry in Gastown.
MadMax,38zo4t,LostSoulsAlliance,2,Tue Jun 9 14:17:09 2015 UTC,"I think the world has literally been nearly decimated by nuclear war and the subsequent radiation. You have to figure the population is probably down at least 90%, which mean there are probably millions of vehicles just sitting out there, plus all the auto parts stores and junk yards that were left. Since roads are pretty gone, you're going to have to modify your vehicles for off-road use. Older tech cars are easier to maintain than newer ones too, hence all the older style cars in the film."
MadMax,38zo4t,eff1ngham,3,Mon Jun 8 22:39:49 2015 UTC,"The Interceptor is one of the only (relatively) stock vehicles in the film.  Look at most of Joe's fleet, they are custom built for a certain purpose.  Nux's car is clearly not using original 34 Chevy parts, and the Bigfoot clearly isn't running on stock 40's Dodge pickup parts.  They're obviously using what's available, and when something does break, it's most likely re-placed with something else.    The mechanics clearly are able to improvise, so it would make sense that they're able to make their own brake fluid, for example.  Does it meet DOT standards, probably not.  But I image they can create their own.  Should that not satisfy your needs, then just assume that people trade in parts for water/gas/bullets and the the parts are then used to maintain the fleet"
MadMax,38zo4t,beligerentlypunk,1 point,Mon Jun 8 20:02:11 2015 UTC,parts are money! Barter town was created on this premise maybe?
MadMax,38zo4t,Turbofurball,2,Tue Jun 9 04:37:21 2015 UTC,"At the beginning the rear driver side tire on the interceptor has no side wall, but appears to be stuffed with rags and bungie corded together. Drive it till it breaks then worry about fixing it.  I had similar questions after the second time I saw it. My immediate reaction to the war boys rebuilding the interceptor was ""wow the wasteland has some pretty primo race parts"" when was the last time you saw anything with a ram air intake?"
MadMax,38zo4t,Turbofurball,1 point,Mon Jun 8 12:28:45 2015 UTC,"Apparently the Buzzards have a huge stockpile of new car parts, with which they trade with the Citadel ... hence they have an uneasy peace - on a trade run the War Boys are pretty relaxed despite being prettily close to their territory."

MadMax,38yt7j,teamtywin,9,Mon Jun 8 00:11:47 2015 UTC,I think both George Miller and Charlize Theron stated in an interview that Furiosa lost her arm in a big battle.
MadMax,38yt7j,Irrelevant_username1,5,Mon Jun 8 02:42:20 2015 UTC,There's also the skeleton arm painted on the door of the truck.  Which if she was seated in the driver seat is the same one she's missing.
MadMax,38yt7j,two2teps,5,Mon Jun 8 14:09:17 2015 UTC,It could've easily been torn off if she had her arm out the window during a battle.

MadMax,38yt7j,two2teps,1 point,Mon Jun 8 14:51:02 2015 UTC,Oh yeah!  I totally noticed that but I didn't draw a connection between that and her arm.  Super cool.
MadMax,38yt7j,skonen_blades,6,Mon Jun 8 16:11:04 2015 UTC,i don't think joe's so stupid that a severed arm would make her an undesirable breeder.  it's not like she's genetically altered.  Splendid has a huge scar on her face and it didn't dissuade him.
MadMax,38yt7j,leonryan,2,Mon Jun 8 06:15:09 2015 UTC,"I thought the scar was a burn mark or something like it placed on them by Joe to mark them as his, sort of like branding cattle"
MadMax,38yt7j,arbiterbuddy,4,Mon Jun 8 06:32:06 2015 UTC,that alone would suggest joe wasn't averse to disfigurement wouldn't it?
MadMax,38yt7j,leonryan,2,Mon Jun 8 06:33:13 2015 UTC,"They already have his brands on their backs. What's on Splendid's face is different, whatever it is."
MadMax,38yt7j,IdiotsLantern,3,Mon Jun 8 07:04:40 2015 UTC,"Maybe she did it herself…”cutting” herself, in protest. Or it could just be a form of self-adornment."
MadMax,38yt7j,littlejohnnyjewel,1 point,Mon Jun 8 15:19:24 2015 UTC,"She did, it's in the comics. I read it on tumblr somewhere. She cut herself out of protest as she was Joe's favorite due to her beauty"

MadMax,38yt7j,IdiotsLantern,1 point,Mon Jun 8 20:06:18 2015 UTC,"Weird what people take from stuff.  Splendid was also mentioned as his favorite. I took this to mean he spent the most ""time"" with her. I also took this to mean the cut scars on her face were from his ""fetishes"" if you get my drift.  They look like knife cuts, not some random scar."

I also took this to mean the cut scars on her face were from his ""fetishes""   If that were the case, the cuts would all be different ages and probably different sizes too. To me it looks more like she was thrown down onto some very sharp surface.   If it's true that ""Wasteland"" is going to be a prequel, then we might get to find out what happened to Splendid's face."
MadMax,38yt7j,IdiotsLantern,1 point,Mon Jun 8 20:09:50 2015 UTC,"it DOES. to me at least. I've seen cutter scars. They look like that. The sporatic pattern says to me that they did not all happen at once. If it were a single incident they would likely all be facing a similar pathway. They are cross hatched in random directions, yet all located in the same 2 places on her face without actually REALLY disfiguring her.  http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/articles/arts/movies/2015/05/150512_MOV_MadMaxWomen.jpg.CROP.original-original.jpg"
MadMax,38yt7j,compacta_d,1 point,Mon Jun 8 20:51:45 2015 UTC,"Hmm... you may have a point.  If The Wasteland turns out to be a prequel, we might get to find out how she got those scars. Either way, the idea that he'd mutilate her for entertainment is a pretty gristly one."
MadMax,38yt7j,IdiotsLantern,1 point,Mon Jun 8 21:11:27 2015 UTC,I agree
MadMax,38yt7j,compacta_d,10,Tue Jun 9 02:44:28 2015 UTC,I'd also say that she is barren but otherwise healthy.  I don't think a missing arm would hold Joe back but who knows?  Maybe that would be enough.
MadMax,38yt7j,skonen_blades,3,Mon Jun 8 01:53:40 2015 UTC,"So here is the detail that I actually pulled from this and it may be a stretch or what resonates with my experiences.  The skeleton arm on the war rig.  People are weird and hold on to shit, and also represent scars, medals, and other war gains proudly. I always took the skeleton on the side of the truck as ""Furiosa's Vehicle"". She lost her arm in some battle whilst serving Immortan Joe and the skeleton arm with gun symbol is Furiosa's trademark/status symbol. Like ""if you see this, you do not fuck with this vehicle"" or maybe ""just so you know EXACTLY who just crushed you"".  Throughout the video they go through 2 different enemy areas. The spike men, and the motocross guys. It was likely against one of those gangs that she lost her arm. I'd like to think they recognize that symbol and respect it/fear it."
MadMax,38yt7j,compacta_d,3,Mon Jun 8 13:38:50 2015 UTC,That's not a bad theory. Gotta wait for the comic to find out.
MadMax,38yt7j,starkimus,3,Mon Jun 8 01:06:12 2015 UTC,"I don't remember seeing anything about the arm being a wound...can anyone link a source?  The stump looks pretty scar-free. That and her position outside the harem to me mean logically the condition was congenital (present from birth). She was very young at around the time order fell apart, she was probably born or at least raised during heavy nuclear fallout (She remembers how the many mothers ambush), radiation doesn't tend to have great effects on the human genome especially during its initial formative stages.   Congenital conditions are often heritable, it would make sense Joe would elect to not use her as a breeder."
MadMax,38yt7j,IDGAF1203,2,Mon Jun 8 16:01:21 2015 UTC,Sounds like a fanfiction theory.
MadMax,38yt7j,ILiveIDieILiveAgain,2,Mon Jun 8 06:32:02 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I'd rather not see what happened to her arm in a film even if George and Charlize both said she lost it in battle. Mystery is sometimes a good thing and we don't need to know everything about every character and place in Fury Road. It's nice that there's still a possibility she was simply born like that. Not having that in the film leaves it open to our imagination.  Before, I'll admit I was curious about what happened. But reading this post and thinking on it some more changed my mind: http://nospockdasgay.tumblr.com/post/119381643753/my-reaction-to-mad-max-fury-road-and-the-utter"
MadMax,38zz4l,Gnarbage,8,Mon Jun 8 06:28:08 2015 UTC,"Bruce Spence should play his original character, (30 years older) run into Max not referencing any previous encounters and towards the end of the film, someone calls Mad Max by his full name and he Spence's character says ""Max? Are you sure he's Max?"" and then the film carries on regardless leaving us as an audience wondering, creating more theories and scenarios about Mad Max."
MadMax,38zz4l,Osborne85,5,Mon Jun 8 17:12:39 2015 UTC,"I like the idea of the original Gyrocopter Pilot returning - what if, by this point, he has remodeled his tribe's way of life to function around the use of flying machines (using his knowledge of how to build and maintain gyrocopters and the like). Imagine huge scale chases like in Fury Road, but involving buzzing swarms of assault copters hurling grenades onto the vehicles below, or warboys on catapults flinging themselves up into the copters as living artillery rounds.  Miller could still have so much fun with this character - and Bruce Spence would be perfect for the role of an aging tribal leader turned aerial warlord."
MadMax,38zz4l,PipeOrganEnthusiast,3,Tue Jun 9 06:06:00 2015 UTC,"To the far north is a great tribe. People who ride the skies along side the sun. Their leader, a man who taught them. Together the tribe was strong. Villages, refineries, factories. The tribe was a shining example of society being rebuilt. They lived without fear, no one dared to attack them for fear of the valkyries who rode the sky protecting them.  That was until one day black smoke bloomed on the horizon. The valkyries set out to identify this threat. What they saw scared them. A war machine unlike any other crawled its way across the desert. It's treads ripping the ground up as it pushed forward. Cranes clawing in front pulling the rig. Along its back a small city guarded by fire, bullets, and cannons. Black smoke rising from the back. This machine was followed by many vehicles. Rigs carrying gas and men.  Far off in front. A lone black vehicle. Riding across the desert like a mad demon. In its wake dust and dirt rise into the air like blood and flames. The leader of the valkyries reckonizes this vehicle. One from a distant memory. One from a time when hope seemed lost.  But it no longer holds hope. Only doom as the behemoth behind follows it north. Bringing it ever closer to the tribe.  Mad Max: The Doom Crawler.  Edit for future me. Don't write when tired jackass. See you nazis. I can grammatize myself later."

MadMax,393nb1,dinghead,8,Tue Jun 9 00:52:38 2015 UTC,"I see your point for sure - the first 2 minutes of the movie might not seem to matter, really...  Unless, and this is how I've been putting it together:   We catch Max in the beginning when he is alone, and totally vulnerable. He's stuck with his demons, and (as he says) is constantly on the run from them. We catch him when he's vulnerable, and then we see why he shuts down.   The ""reveal"" of his name in the end of the movie then seems to establish an intimacy, a respect, between him and Furiosa. This feels like Max's redemption in a big way - that there's still humanity left in him, and for a second, he saw why he's still running. Why he chooses to stay alive.   Or maybe they just wanted to set up the movie as Let's Torture Tom Hardy for Two Hours™"

As for the intro, I'm sure that they made sure that Mad Max was in the title for marketing purposes, while simultaneously knowing that even though the previous films were massively famous, none of the kids would have actually bothered to see them, so some explanation was required.  Mad Max 2 was released in the USA only as ""The Road Warrior.""  Calling this one simply ""Fury Road"" would have been equally cool.  and obviously I meant 36 years ago, not 16"

It seems that (through the intro to 2) this is because a lot of resources are fuelling some sort of war between the 'two largest superpowers' in which it also seems everyone has picked a side. So in Mad Max 1, Max fills the role of a pursuit officer in the MFP (Main Force Patrol). This is, at least in the outback, the last remnants of policing. As you will see by evidence of the quality of the justice halls. Which I took to be just where the MFP hangs out and other judiciary proceedings take place elsewhere.   In Road Warrior they begin it with an introduction and now it seems the war has picked up. I believe some sort of Nuclear conflict has arisen. Anyway, it must be taking place some time after 1 because things have truly gone to shit. Cars aren't normal cars and some of the 'language of mad max' has come to, e.g. 'Guzzoline'. There is no law and no order. People live and die by the gun. Or car. And yes, cars have become very important. Where once they had a deserted area but with an ounce of infrastructure they now have a barren wasteland. People are fascinated by 'Guzzoline' and protect what they own with their lives. Small communities exist but little infrastructure remains. Sort of like, they have their bands of bandits but little housing facilities. This is also the film where Max gets his dog, an Australian Cattle Dog.    Beyond Thunderdome seems to be where people are rebuilding. Bartertown exists, primarily based around the act of... um... bartering but it's still very brutal. Law and Order makes a twisted return and other communities have formed. It definitely is the most different to the other two films. IMO it's the worst (my and many other people's) and it doesn't help that Tina Turner is... Tina Turner.   By Fury Road... well you've seen that."

MadMax,38zb4l,nemothorx,-1,Mon Jun 8 08:58:48 2015 UTC,"i don't think it is. Max doesn't appear to the same person at all in this series, but we don't see a whole lot of world exposition in this series at all. I consider the original trilogy to be its own separate universe with this being a sort of rebooted universe.  But in a way, you could view them as different tellings of the same story. Max is a legendary figure to two different communities by the end of the original trilogy, so maybe this is just an alternate telling of his tale by the denizens of the wasteland.  The only striking difference is that it doesn't look like Max has the same backstory."

I can’t even work out the chronology of the first, second and third, let alone the fourth thirty years later.”   He's referring to the films themselves. Fury Road came out 30 years after Thunderdome. He says himself that he hasn't worked out the chronology of the movies."
MadMax,390poy,jackdaw_t_robot,1 point,Mon Jun 8 13:32:09 2015 UTC,"Again, I was trying to give the benefit of the doubt to the minimums for the point of the discussion of it... the full extent of that quote says:   “The apocalypse of some form happens, and you wind up 45-50 years in the future. That’s where we pick up.”   So, even if the original Mad Max takes place in dystopian future “a few years from now…”, and Fury Road is 45-50 years after the apocalypse referenced above, which had not taken place yet in the original film, then Hardy’s character is far too young to be the same Max."
MadMax,390poy,jackdaw_t_robot,3,Mon Jun 8 13:41:33 2015 UTC,"The ""12045 Days"" on his back could be the total reign of Joe.  Much like a primitive feudal calendar would track years of the monarchs' rule instead of a predetermined time before hand.  Furiosa say's she has been gone for 7,000+ days which is about 20 years, implying that that Joe has been in power for at least that long; making 33 years not seem out of the question.    Especially if it's counting time from whenever Joe created his original gang, perhaps way back in the time pre-war time of the original film, and not from when he became the cult leader we see him as.  Motor-gangs where becoming prevalent before the war it's likely that Joe formed his first one before the world died and has been counting the days ever since.   Max also references being a cop in the opening narration and loosing his wife and kid.  Information he didn't share with anyone, it was just between us (the audience) and him.   I'm just taking this as another ""Tale of the Road Warrior"" and the only cannon you can call back to is the very first film based on the death of his family, the fact he was a cop, and his leg brace."
MadMax,390poy,ProfessorAdonisCnut,3,Mon Jun 8 14:32:50 2015 UTC,"It's the same Max. It's possible he had an adopted daughter he rescued at some point, or helped a girl with trauma who just simply called him that from day one.  Max very young in Road Warrior, only in his mid-20's. It's possible that he could be in his late 30's in Fury Road and have it still after Thunderdome.  The thing you have to keep in mind is that the rise of marauders and the undoing of society is already in place in Mad Max, as he's working to fight for what's left of it. Fury Road could be in a place that's had warlords, gangs, and chaos before the first movie ever started, even though the pox-eclipse was after RW.   Some have mentioned that is not just possible, but almost a necessity, for there to be an Australian government in session during Road Warrior, and they simply had written off most of the wasteland as a loss years before. Why would bombs drop on a country with no government to fight?  The spirit of these movies is that at a certain point a timeline is meaningless. Every day is the wastes, chaos, murder, flight, survival. What month or year doesn't matter. It's always the same. The story cold happen pre-Thunderdome or after and it would be he same."
MadMax,390poy,nemothorx,1 point,Mon Jun 8 12:53:06 2015 UTC,"Max very young in Road Warrior, only in his mid-20's. It's possible that he could be in his late 30's in Fury Road and have it still after Thunderdome.   From the standpoint of it just being an interesting theory to discuss, the above isn't possible based on Miller's quote.    Lets say for the point of discussion that Max is 20 at the beginning of MM1 and that Road Warrior takes place just three years after that (even though the significant breakdown in society suggests it has been longer).  So he is 23.  Using the IMDB reference to Thunderdome of 4 years, instead of the Wiki's reference of 15-18 (I was shortchanging it) He would be 27 after the events in Bartertown.    Miller says thirty years.  That would still make him 57.  Tom Hardy's Max is not 57 years old.  That's taking all of the low end estimates into the equation.    Now I am not saying this is how it is given your accurate statement that the application of a timeline is not really the point of the Mad Max films.  It does make for a good conversation which was the point.    One could also argue the point that oil was already in essence gone by the time of Thunderdome.  The vehicles were just frames with engines and not the beast machines in Fury Road.  It was this that led me to believe Fury Road happened before Thunderdome until Miller made that statement.    This post was never intended to be an I'm right and you're wrong sort of thing.  I just thought it was a really interesting theory if you needed to quantify time into the lore."
MadMax,390poy,soda-popper,2,Mon Jun 8 13:18:54 2015 UTC,"I agree with what you're saying but the canon is also all over the map. I've heard dates ranging up to 45 years post pox-eclipse! I almost wish that Miller took a firm approach in nailing a timeline just to end this conversation (almost).  I like to think of Fury Road fitting in between RW and Thunderdome. I think it would make more sense that way.  I believe Miller was thinking of Mad being 40ish in that film, hence the gray temples.   I also like to think of oil simply being a more precious commodity saved for raids and stuff like that. It'd make sense for Aunty to save a small stockpile of It. I could see Mad favoring a caravan just to keep from being ambushed for it constantly.   I love these kinds of conversations though. I think it drives home the point that the History Men and Women really should have started to write things down instead of relying on oral tradition."
MadMax,390poy,littlejohnnyjewel,2,Mon Jun 8 14:47:10 2015 UTC,"Yup, that's what I was interested in was the conversation.  I know there really is no way to nail Mad Max down to a timeline.   Most of my friends just approach MM1 as the foundation and each story as a ""legend"" of its own."

MadMax,38wnfb,carlosmcsnyder,15,Sun Jun 7 13:39:58 2015 UTC,"A few things to consider:   George Miller has said he thinks of the Mad Max movies more as different legends of Max, told way after the fact and filtered through several re-tellings, rather then literal accounts of what happened.

But yeah, the whole Green Place thing seems a little wonky for the time line. It sounds like they had a well established culture with terms and gestures that have that post-apocalyptic flavor when Furiosa was a child. Unless they were some kind of strange cult in the modern world? Hmm. Or Furiosa is a lot younger than Theron, which I could also buy. Maybe the character is mid-late twenties, and the Many Mothers got off to a snappy start after the apocalypse happened 30-40 years ago.  Even 30 years is too long for Max to have been a typical modern-day cop, though, since it would put him at about 50. But he could have been a cop post-apocalypse in a place that was still trying to hold onto law and order. That might be the most promising angle."
MadMax,38wnfb,adventurefine,5,Sun Jun 7 14:07:42 2015 UTC,"I posted this in another MM thread earlier, but this seems to fit here, too:   Like the other poster said, there's no firm timeline, however, the first film seems to indicate that global war hasn't happened yet, but there is definitely an oil/energy crisis and bands of gangs are out of control, but life seems fairly normal(ish).  Film two indicates that the world has gone to shit and there has been thermonuclear war and now the wasteland is filled with gangs and marauders. Resources are scarce, life means very little.  The 3rd movie shows it's pretty clear that life as we know it is gone, a fading memory.   Again, there's no distinct time line, and in fact, the only time I've seen a date mentioned was in Mad Max 3 Beyond Thunderdome where a group of kids Max was helping said the captain of the plane their parents had crashed in was 1999, and the events of Beyond Thunderdome was possibly between 2016-2018.  I've been thinking that if we were to try and attribute dates we could possibly surmise that the first film was set around the mid 1990's and the second film around 1999(ish), but the problem is that if the timeline I've mapped out is right or close then in Fury Road, Max would be or should be approximately mid 50's in age."

Just bits & pieces.  *Like maybe their parents were similar to present-day survivalists/transition town type people, who know shit is about to get real.  And maybe the landscape was very different when the old ladies first went to the Green Place, so it really was isolated and and safe for a while, until Immortan Joe showed up.  So the old ladies had, say 40-odd good years at the Green Place, then Immortan Joe (and probably others) found it and in various ways destroyed it.  The next 20-30 years, they became badass motorbiking vagabonds, while Furiosa rose up through the ranks at the Citadel."
MadMax,38wnfb,candleflame3,2,Sun Jun 7 23:31:57 2015 UTC,"In Australia it isn't uncommon for people to refer to their favourite programme as ""my show""."
MadMax,38wnfb,AcidMage,2,Mon Jun 8 00:09:33 2015 UTC,"I believe it's been stated that Fury Road takes place about 50 years after the holocaust. So it's possible that there was some sort of Main Force Patrol in the post-apocalypse, still fighting for justice and virtue after the bombs fell. Sort of like what we see in the Fallout series with various factions such as the NCR."
MadMax,38wnfb,MojaveMilkman,1 point,Mon Jun 8 17:21:03 2015 UTC,I believe George Miller said that Fury Road takes place 45 years after the Apocalypse. That would mean the original Mad Max took place many years after the apocalypse. Max himself had to have been born after the apocalypse since he's clearly younger than 45. That also means the apocalypse didn't affect every place the same way. Some places were able to maintain civilization for a longer time before falling apart while other places collapsed much faster. So it's possible that the Vuvalini came from a place that had been in chaos for much longer.
MadMax,38wnfb,KingofMadCows,1 point,Sun Jun 7 23:48:14 2015 UTC,"Let's clear up the apocalypse time line. 1.) Mad max is based in the safe zone. 2.)  The Road Warrior and Thunderdome are based in the wasteland. With that said, you can now start to theory craft on how certain ideas and explanations are presented in Fury Road"
MadMax,38wnfb,Gronk_ifyourehorny,1 point,Mon Jun 8 07:18:42 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the comments. What's awesome about this franchise is the ability to keep the viewer interested and speculating about the film long after leaving the theatre. The ambiguousness of certain elements of the film reflect the shattered and disheveled world we are brought into. Things that are open to interpretation let us try to piece together and rationalize the insanity of Max's world, which I'm sure many characters in the film try to do as well. In a world where nothing is written down and almost everything is lost, history and fact are replaced by stories and legend."

MadMax,38uw8l,IdiotsLantern,40,Sun Jun 7 01:02:48 2015 UTC,I enjoyed the movie.
MadMax,38uw8l,VintageRudy,17,Sun Jun 7 01:35:12 2015 UTC,"Her character was perfect.  She felt very authentic and real.  Believable.  So many times female action heroes fall short because they come across as campy, or cheesy, etc.  But Furiosa was just great in every way.  I was also so happy they didn't try to shoehorn any bullshit love scenes in between her and Max or anything like that.  Just a mutual, well earned respect between the two."
MadMax,38uw8l,M_Night_Shamylan,9,Sun Jun 7 02:41:37 2015 UTC,"Same. It would have hurt Max's characterization, in my opinion.  I wonder if it's time to include Furiosa in the class of Sarah Connor and Ellen Ripley."
MadMax,38uw8l,HoustonsSolution,6,Sun Jun 7 02:50:48 2015 UTC,I think there was a lot of popular analysis putting Furiosa in that company pretty much from the day the movie came out.   Completely justifiably too.
MadMax,38uw8l,nemothorx,11,Sun Jun 7 11:21:10 2015 UTC,I like the way your brainmeats squirm.  Well said.

MadMax,38uw8l,nemothorx,6,Sun Jun 7 07:40:57 2015 UTC,"Fucking awesome, I couldn't haves said it better myself. The only take on here that was different was similar to that of Michael Meyers from Halloween where Max is actually an entity and not really a person. This is to say Furiosa and Max the characters are actually just two of the embodiments of the real Mad Max."
MadMax,38uw8l,Mex-Box,5,Sun Jun 7 07:50:00 2015 UTC,"Then she asks if he wants the muzzle off. And he gives her this LOOK (Tom Hardy's reaction there is GREAT) and that's it, she's got him.    That's one of my favourite parts of the movie!"
MadMax,38uw8l,candleflame3,3,Sun Jun 7 13:14:41 2015 UTC,"Her tough but fair minded leadership, her genuine compassion for her people, and her sincere desire to lead them someplace better makes her everything Joe was not. She's the leader you can trust, the one you WANT to follow, not because she's a god but because she's going to look after you, you mean something to her.   Like a mother?"
MadMax,38uw8l,teaqualizer,2,Sun Jun 7 15:46:58 2015 UTC,"Like a mother?   Ha ha! Yeah, exactly like that. I am digging this use of ""mother"" as a title of power and respect.    It's fun because the going theory right now (in my mind anyway) as to why Furiosa is a fighter rather then a breeder is they found out she was infertile. A breeder who can't breed is useless. So instead she became a fighter, which ina roundabout way lead to her becoming mother to an entire city. I got a very strong ""Mysha"" vibe from that scene where the downtrodden poor demanded the Immortan's people allow her to ascend to the Citadel."
MadMax,38uw8l,teaqualizer,2,Sun Jun 7 16:05:57 2015 UTC,Did you feel at all short changed during that scene that you didn't get to see corpus colossus either approve or object to the lowering of the platform?  It could have played out like the scene in gladiator where phoenix had to reluctantly give the thumbs up to spare his sworn enemy
MadMax,38uw8l,teaqualizer,2,Sun Jun 7 16:33:37 2015 UTC,"Possibly. According to the actor, Immortan Joe always tried to do right by Colossus and look after him as best he could. If anyone would have cause to be legitimately saddened by his death, it'd be his last living family member, but the look on Colossus's face shows a lot of conflicting feelings. His thing is that giant telescope of his, so I think he saw what life in the Citadel was like for most people. If he was shocked and saddened by Joe's death, he wasn't surprised that most people were less so.   One reason why I'm hoping for a sequel rather then a prequel is I'd like to learn what happens to Colossus next. What will Furiosa do with him? I can't see her throwing him out into the Wasteland, but can she trust him enough to let him keep his position as the Citadel's watcher? Apparently Colossus and Furiosa ""grew up"" together, so it'd be interesting to see that develop."
MadMax,38uw8l,Stevezilla9,3,Sun Jun 7 17:03:05 2015 UTC,"Probably one of my favourite moments is the look on her face when she goes to get out of the cab to face Joe after being stabbed. It's a look of resignation rather than steely determination. Theron played that really well, not afraid to show some vulnerability.  It almost mirrors the reaction of the war boy at the start who realises he is fatally wounded and that it's time to break out the chrome spray. Again a look more of acceptance and resignation rather than anticipation."
MadMax,38uw8l,ILiveIDieILiveAgain,3,Sun Jun 7 17:23:34 2015 UTC,I like how they didn't try to force her into being badass. I've seen too many movies where they over play a woman being badass. These guys just made it seem so natural.
MadMax,38uw8l,aulum,2,Sun Jun 7 23:39:45 2015 UTC,"I have some own speculations of Furiosa's past. I, too, think that she was taken as a child to be a breeder, but something happened along the way and she ended up being one of the Warboys. Being infertile sounds like the most believable option. Otherwise she was healthy, capable and smart, so it was wiser to take advantage of that instead of completely getting rid of her.  I have no doubt she started plotting her escape the minute her mother died, so she had plenty of time to improve her skills (she was a good shooter and a good mechanic, assuming she built her own arm [though it could have been Organic too]). I bet her determination (to eventually escape) was the reason why she became Imperator. She did have the motivation.  Along the way she must have met the Wives. Maybe only she was allowed to meet them (as far as I know, she was the only female Imperator) 'cause I doubt Joe let any men near them. She must have plotted with the Wives and Miss Giddy, so maybe she was even able to go inside the vault. It could be that it wasn't her primary plan to take anyone with her (she had made the deal that she would go to the canyon alone), but she obviously trusted the Wives enough to eventually share her plans. It didn't seem like it happened ""just like that"" 'cause the Wives had had time to write on the vault's walls and floors, and Miss Giddy had been there, waiting for Joe to discover what had happened. So I do think she cared a lot for the Wives. She must have. I actually think she tried not to 'cause she knew how it felt to lose someone."
MadMax,38uw8l,Imnicepleasefuckme,2,Sun Jun 7 19:04:20 2015 UTC,"We know only two things about Furiosa's escape attempts. We know they were unsuccessful, and she hasn't tried since she started driving the War Rig. Angharad may have figured if she'd tried before, she could possibly be convinced to try again, since she'll ""never have a better chance."" I'm sure the timing of this particular attempt came from the Wives, since Angharad desperately wants to get away from Joe before her baby arrives.   We know this isn't her first time driving this rig, because Joe says, ""Once Again, I send out my War Rig... Once again I solute my Imperator Furiosa..."" So she's gone out on runs before. From the reaction of her War Boy to the sudden change of direction, we can even assume she's gone on unannounced secret missions as well. Whatever happened before the start of this film, Colossus said, ""Your partner isn't heading to Gas Town,"" which tells you how close to the Immortan she had to be. Why Joe would let someone who tried to escape so many times rise that high? Is it a case of ""keep your friends close and the people you can't trust even closer so you can keep an eye on them?""  I will say, considering how cold and distant she is to the Wives, I don't think they associated very much while still in the Citadel. Joe keeps chastity belts on his women so I don't think he'd need Furiosa to look after them, plus he has Miss Gitty as a caretaker. I have to assume if he didn't suspect his wives were up to SOMETHING, his first thought when Furiosa swerved off course would have probably been, ""sigh, she's doing it again, alright, lets go turn her around,"" and not, ""SHE DONE STOLE MAH BABYMAKERZ!"" So I think he suspected his wives were up to something, but didn't know what it was and definitely didn't know they'd been talking to Furiosa.  Maybe it's significant that Furiosa is the only one who DIDN'T throw up the V8 sign when he gave his speech. Maybe he got suspicious at that.   I don't know. I'm just guessing."

MadMax,38vlr8,pickelsurprise,18,Sun Jun 7 14:56:02 2015 UTC,"Bruce Spence's character in Beyond Thunderdome wasn't the same as in The Road Warrior. It is somewhat confusing, as both films have two pilot characters played by the same actor. Still, at the end of The Road Warrior, the narration states that the Gyro Captain goes on to become the leader of the northern tribe, so it's highly unlikely that he'd even have a reason to be anywhere but there."
MadMax,38vlr8,MondoBizarro,6,Sun Jun 7 05:44:54 2015 UTC,"I just watched The Road Warrior last night and that ending narration gave me the impression that it was spoken by the feral kid, and that he became the leader of the northern tribes."

MadMax,38vlr8,Retlaw83,5,Sun Jun 7 18:28:05 2015 UTC,That's why George Miller didn't have a Gibson cameo. He likened it to watching a Daniel Craig Bond movie and seeing Sean Connery show up.

Never getting a sequel!"".   Warner Bros. wouldn't fund the film if they knew it wasn't going to be successful - or even give more money to George to make more or better scenes (Like the Spikey Truck being flipped scene). The film is a success both financially and critically, it's one of the highest rated films of the year so far and on track to make more money in Japan considering that Mad Max has quite a huge following there. My money is on Warner Bros green-lighting the sequel in August for a 2017-2018 release - no matter what the naysayers say."
MadMax,38tfrl,DeliciousToastie,16,Sat Jun 6 18:14:06 2015 UTC,"I'm hoping you're right. The WB needs a series after HP: Deathly Hallows 2 and this one is one to take now. You have a good Max in Tom Hardy (even though people might say anyone could have played him in this movie -- I humbly disagree with that and thought he did awesome) and a film that was critically successful; high praise from both critics and audience members. Hopefully they see how successful this can be for them in the future, but if not, at least this was a great send off for Max, much better than Thunderdome, in my opinion."
MadMax,38tfrl,DeliciousToastie,14,Sat Jun 6 18:21:23 2015 UTC,"I'm sure Warner Bros. see great franchise potential for Mad Max. They're publishing a Mad Max game this September as a major release (It ties in heavily to Fury Road and acts as an ""interactive"" prequel to the film) and there is already talk of a sequel and Tom Hardy being signed onto for 2-3 more Mad Max films. George even elaborated in an interview that he had so much content from the 12 years of work on Fury Road that he kept some back for future films. We even have comics that expand on each major character from the film.   I'm certain Warner Bros and George want a franchise as much as we do - we just have to wait until WB give the word on a sequel being greenlit."

I don't think Tom Hardy auditioned, at least not in the sense that they went through a casting agent and had him read lines and that kind of thing. I think George Miller met with Tom several times and liked his energy. Heath Ledger was another person George was considering for the role, but, sadly, Heath's early death put an end to that..   I do know the first three people cast in the movie were Charlize Theron (George says he basically wrote Furiosa with Charlize in mind), Nick Holt (who gave a fantastic audition using a dense emotional scene that isn't in the movie), and Zoe Kravitz (who had just come back from Burning Man and had dust still in her hair). This was way back in 2009 when I think the movie was still going to shoot in Australia. After this came a lot of false starts."

MadMax,38tfrl,Nicke1Eye,4,Sun Jun 7 00:42:12 2015 UTC,"Considering the movie's critical success, WB will probably make a pretty heavy award push. That will greatly increase the film's long term profit. WB will be committed to the franchise.  Plus, WB might want George Miller to direct one of their DC films. That'll give them more incentive to continue the Mad Max franchise."

Experiencing a character facing impossible situations/odds, choosing to succeed or die in the attempt, is a tale we have told for thousands of years. We love it and always will. From Odysseus to Han Solo to Furiosa. Who doesn't like a badass underdog?"
MadMax,38vxzh,mirainokirby,8,Sun Jun 7 09:13:18 2015 UTC,"You're assuming they would have killed Furiosa. Maybe they would have taken the pod and left without harming her. Maybe not. Maybe Furiosa would have asked Angharad to drive instead of Max. What if, what if, what if... We will never know 'cause it never happened. So this is kind of pointless."
MadMax,38vxzh,ILiveIDieILiveAgain,11,Sun Jun 7 09:32:31 2015 UTC,"The Rock Runners seemed more pissed that she'd broken the deal than anything. You don't break a deal, its business."

MadMax,38vxzh,AfraidOfTechnology,3,Sun Jun 7 15:29:24 2015 UTC,Exactly!
MadMax,38vxzh,Turbofurball,3,Sun Jun 7 16:01:50 2015 UTC,I was a bit confused about how the deal soured. Everything seemed kosher then they just seemed to open fire on her.   The only thing I could put it down to was Angharad possibly having contractions and making a sound thus tipping off the Rock Runners that Furiosa wasn't alone as agreed. Or that they were pissed that she'd brought 3 war parties behind her.
MadMax,38vxzh,Derpatologist_7,8,Sun Jun 7 11:11:22 2015 UTC,"They heard Angharad, and realised that there was a reason for all the war parties, so not only did she break the deal but also brought a whole lot of trouble their way too ... putting them between a rock and a hard place."
MadMax,38vxzh,Turbofurball,2,Sun Jun 7 12:03:45 2015 UTC,Thanks for the answer. So looks as if I had the right idea all along. Cheers.
MadMax,38vxzh,Derpatologist_7,4,Sun Jun 7 12:29:50 2015 UTC,"The thing that soured the deal was the heat she had brought down on them.  ""You said a few vehicles in pursuit, maybe.  We count three war parties.""  Clearly a smaller faction, the rock runners were probably happy to get their hands on some easy fuel, but were understandably pissed that it brought down the combined armadas of Joe, People Eater and Bullet Farmer on them.    Edit: Word."
MadMax,38vxzh,teamtywin,1 point,Sun Jun 7 23:49:01 2015 UTC,"The reason she broke the deal was because she knew the instant she unhooked the gas, they'd kill her. Or injure her, take her prisoner, and use her (and probably the War Rig too) as leverage to negotiate with Joe. Taking off with the gas was a way to spread their forces out and force them to engage her as they catch her.   It wasn't a great plan, but the instant that gas came away, she'd have been dead, so she had to make a break for it while she could."
MadMax,38vxzh,IdiotsLantern,2,Mon Jun 8 07:19:34 2015 UTC,"The war parties were right on top of them, from the expression on her face I think she believed the Rock Riders weren't going to drop the rocks at all (and they didn't until after she'd bolted)"
MadMax,38vxzh,Turbofurball,1 point,Mon Jun 8 09:50:19 2015 UTC,"I don't know if Angharad can drive. I know she heads towards the cab of the War Rig and Max shoots her in the leg to make her stop, but if she had gotten there would she have actually known what to do or was she just going to figure it out?   Toast is able to seize control of the Gigahorse after Furiosa kills the Immortan, so she either already knew how to drive or just watched really closely and figured it out. But then Toast leaves the driving to the Vuvolini and joins the rest of the Wives helping Max tend to the dying Furiosa. So this says she may drive like she loads a gun: she knows how to do it, but no one would call her an expert, at least not yet."
MadMax,38vxzh,IdiotsLantern,1 point,Mon Jun 8 07:24:04 2015 UTC,"Well, it would have been wise of Furiosa to teach them how to drive. It's not very clever to escape with 6 people of whom only one can drive.   We don't know when these women were taken. Some of them could have been already adults. If they can load a gun then I have no doubt they can drive too. They had books too in the vault, maybe they just figured it out... We're not talking about helpless children here."
MadMax,38vxzh,ILiveIDieILiveAgain,2,Mon Jun 8 07:50:24 2015 UTC,"She hasn't had time to teach them to drive. I don't think Imperators and coddled Breeders kept in a vault got to do much mixing.   I'm going to do a lot of speculation there: so bear with me.   Toast (Zoe Kravitz) is the only one of the wives with short hair. Thanks to Max, we know that new captives on the Citadel have their hair cut short. This means it's possible she's a relatively recent addition to the harem. This might explain how she knows how to load rifles, match bullets to guns, and drive.   The other wives have long hair. The implication is they were raised together and might know very little about life outside of the vault. Angharad might not have known how to drive, but if nothing else she would have sat in the cab and done her best to keep Max out of it. Not a great plan, but not nothing."
MadMax,38vxzh,IdiotsLantern,0,Mon Jun 8 08:20:52 2015 UTC,"""This is the kill switch order. This is the wheel and this is the gas pedal. Ok go.""   Simple.  Okay but seriously. I don't think the hair has anything to do with how long they had been in the Citadel. Based on that speculation Furiosa must have arrived that morning. They probably just let the Wives cut their hair as they preferred. Cheedo was the youngest and also reluctant to leave the ""luxuries"" Joe was offering, so she was probably the last one to arrive."
MadMax,38vxzh,ILiveIDieILiveAgain,2,Mon Jun 8 10:51:40 2015 UTC,"Cheedo wasn't really reluctant to leave Joe and and his ""Luxuries."" She was upset because she'd just seen Angharad die, and it brought home for her in a very real way that this is DANGEROUS. All of them could get killed doing this. For an instant, returning to him felt better then death.   Cheedo is also the youngest, meaning odds are she arrived in the vault as a very small child and was raised there...Probably as soon as Joe saw how beautiful she as going to be, he had her ""promoted.""   And we all know there's more to driving then just ""wheel gas pedal go,"" especially in a place like the Canyon which is full of rocks and tight places for a truck that size.   You might me right that I'm reading too much into the hair, but I still think that if we go off of the assumption that Joe didn't let the wives have things like knifes and scissors in their Vault, then Toast seems to be the standout. One of the remarkable things about the hair is that the vault seems to be the only place where it's worn long. The wives and the immortan have long hair. Everyone is bald or has short hair. We saw them carefully collecting Max's hair when he was captured, so they use hair for something..."
MadMax,38vxzh,IdiotsLantern,6,Mon Jun 8 19:16:18 2015 UTC,"She wasn't alone against the buzzards though. She had the crew on the war rig and two pursuit vehicles and motorcycles protecting it, as everyone assumed it was a supply run.  I'm guessing it was always her plan to eventually drive through the sand storm and get rid of them and end up at the canyon alone.  The deal went sour because they saw all the vehicles in pursuit. ""You said a few vehicles in pursuit maybe. We count 3 war parties"".  I wouldn't call her naive. Sounds like a calculated risk to me."
MadMax,38vxzh,Imnicepleasefuckme,6,Sun Jun 7 15:09:30 2015 UTC,"I don't think the Rock Riders were really all that big of a threat. It was clear that all they wanted was fuel. They abandoned the pursuit as soon as the fuel tank exploded. Also, it's possible that they knew the War Rig has kill switches. In previous films the V8 Interceptor has been outfitted with similar kill switches (booby trap switches?) so I'm thinking kill switches and booby trapped ignitions/fuel caps are common in the Wasteland, and the Rock Riders know it and assume it's not worth it to try to steal the War Rig.  Finally, they all use bikes to traverse the mountain pathways. What good is one War Rig going to do them? It's big and imposing, but without support vehicles it can't really do much damage on it's own, and would probably be overtaken by Buzzards as soon as they try to leave their little mountain pass with it. If not for Nux and Immortan Joe's war parties, the War Rig would have possibly been overtaken in the first Buzzard attack."
MadMax,38vxzh,AfraidOfTechnology,5,Sun Jun 7 15:40:01 2015 UTC,"I don't think Furiosa was Naive. The worst you can say about her plan is it was pretty minimal. As best I can figure, she planned to turn the Rig off course into hostile territory. She would have killed or ditched her escort of War Boyz...somehow, we wont ever know how because the Buzzards attacked. The Wives would hide in the tanker. She'd be alone at the pass, give them the gasoline, and they'd drop the rocks. She'd continue on her way. Everyone wins.   Her plan went to crap kind of from the start, the way plans do. First, she had barely been off-road a few minutes before Colossus raised the alarm. Joe was after her way too soon and her War Boyz realized that something was up. The Buzzards attacked that slowed them down enough for the Immortan's war party to catch up to them. And then, after she manages to escape into the dust storm and is taking a moment to shake off the dust and let the wives out for some air, suddenly some muzzled maniac shows up carrying a car door and corpse. He sticks his gun in their faces and starts barking like some sort of wild dog. So then that has to be dealt with....   Basically I don't think her deal with the Rock Hoppers ever mentioned having to face down three war parties. The Rock Hoppers don't want to do that. When Joe and his allies enter the canyon, the cliff people hide rather then attack. They'd have killed Furiosa or captured her and traded her to the Immortan if it'd have settled the situation. And this is before they learn about the Wives. Somehow I have a hunch they wouldn't treat them very much better then Joe did."
MadMax,38vxzh,IdiotsLantern,2,Mon Jun 8 07:43:38 2015 UTC,"It's an interesting point.  I think you're right.  It would have been bad news for her and the wives of they'd actually followed the canyon bikers instructions.  Even Max was like ""you don't want to go in there"""

One of Immortan Joe's original crew was a military major and when they were scouting the citadel before they took it over they discovered an abandoned lead mine and a disused oil refinery.   The military major (The Bullet Farmer)  then set up the lead mine as The Bullet Farm where they produced fire arms and ammo and the oil refinery would become gas town administered by the People Eater.

The last one the film seemed to have moved to the smallest theater in the complex, and the picture quality was not good. It looked like the image was made of a bunch of square ""pixels"" and was not sharp, so it was disappointing. Plus the sound system was mediocre.   The first two times I saw the movie was on in the cineplex's ""main"" theater, and that was very sharp and the sound was awesome. You especially notice it in the scene where they are approaching the storm, then enter it. (Song: Storm Is Coming) On a good sound system, just as they're about to enter the storm there are these glorious trumpet ""stabs"" that pan overhead from the left to the right, like ""BRRRRRAAAAATT"", and it kind of builds up the suspense to entering the storm. IT SOUNDS AWESOME on a great system, and from there you get the majestic strings that lift off as the vehicles get pulled into the fire tornado.  I'm thinking of seeing it again but I need to find a good screen in the Denver area that is still showing it. Most theaters have it relegated to their smaller rooms."

There are several factors that cause the discrepancy. First, it depends if the theatre is completely digital or it maintains a 35mm. The theatre I work at has one 35mm and 4 digital projectors. Spongebob was the only film we were able to keep for that length of time because it was really the only 35mm available. WB, as far as I know, doesn't make 35mm, so that takes that out of the equation. The next aspect is if the movie has 'legs,' meaning it will make decent money for more than the first couple of weekends. With the amount of money it had made, I would say most theatres will keep it for two-three weeks and the only ones that will keep it longer are the Regals, Carmike's, and etc."

MadMax,38tovz,underneathlogic,5,Sat Jun 6 18:57:43 2015 UTC,There was an interview with the guy who played the Doof warrior going around and he's a metal guitarist from Australia. He says on set he played lots of random bits and pieces but none of that stuff ended up in the film.
MadMax,38tovz,teaqualizer,3,Sat Jun 6 20:12:05 2015 UTC,Like you said there are parts featured in the soundtrack - but after seeing the film again it seems they layered over most of the guitar music in post. According to the actor/musician who played Doof - iOTA - the actual guitar sounded awful so they added most of the guitar parts in editing.

He formed a biker gang terrorizing the people after the fall. His gang included henchmen dubbed Major Kalashnikov (later known as The Bullet Farmer) and a strategist: Deepdog. With each battle the gang grew stronger by slaughtering the leaders of other gangs and taking the women. With that, his idea of bringing back society willingly took a dark turn. Eventually he and his gang entered the wasteland, where he would learn about a massive aquifer plant later known as The Citadel.

MadMax,38t8x5,DeliciousToastie,13,Sat Jun 6 16:52:44 2015 UTC,There are multiple imperators in the movie. They are the guys without white body paint and black foreheads. They can be seen with Joe
MadMax,38t8x5,starkimus,2,Sat Jun 6 17:30:33 2015 UTC,"The guy who introduces Joe at the beginning (""Rev it up for Imortan JOE!"") is painted as such.  He's shown a few more times, and has a brief spar with Furiosa on the Gigahorse near the end if I recall right.  He hisses at her, which was notable."
MadMax,38t8x5,teamtywin,4,Sun Jun 7 23:35:37 2015 UTC,"The identity of the other Imperators isn't obvious, but has come up in this sub previously:  http://www.reddit.com/r/MadMax/comments/38lkkj/whowhere_are_the_other_imperators/  I've also seen a screencap showing them, but can't find the relevant thread offhand."
MadMax,38t8x5,nemothorx,2,Sat Jun 6 17:29:18 2015 UTC,"Cool! It also raised the question that if Mad Max - the game - takes place before Fury Road like it's suggested then Joe's War Boy Army is much bigger than we think. From the game it shows that Scrotus has his own Army of War Boys at Gas Town and beyond (He was most likely placed there because he was classed as a psychopathic killer, according to the prequel comics). So, Scrotus could have his own Imperator's too that we don't know about, yet."
MadMax,38t8x5,Turbofurball,3,Sat Jun 6 17:41:08 2015 UTC,"The Bullet Farmer also has one on his tank (who advises him not to shoot the wives), so they're everywhere."
MadMax,38t8x5,bryanlharris,6,Sun Jun 7 10:17:26 2015 UTC,The credits list other Imperators.  I barely noticed them in the movie.  I think one of them is standing there when Joe turns on the water at the beginning.
MadMax,38ruzr,teamtywin,43,Sat Jun 6 07:21:10 2015 UTC,"when he came back and gave nux the wheel and a boot without saying anything, that's when i knew hardy nailed the role of max."
MadMax,38ruzr,JimmyDaGent,7,Sat Jun 6 10:34:33 2015 UTC,I'd forgotten about this - what a great moment to look forward to seeing again when I catch it in 3D on Monday!!  How did the boot situation go? I think I remember Slit yanking a boot off Max and showing it off later on in a canyon scene but can't remember anything with Nux and boots.
MadMax,38ruzr,kuuuma,10,Sat Jun 6 14:06:31 2015 UTC,"Slit had yanked off one of Max's boots when all three of them were on Nux's car before the sandstorm, when he was holding onto Max's legs and Max was trying to kick him off the back of the car entirely.  After the sandstorm, Nux was unconscious so Max yanked one of Nux's boots off to replace Max's missing one, then carried him and the car door over to the War Rig.  Nux got thrown out of the rig with one bare foot, caught up with Joe's warband, and got onto the Gigahorse in the canyon scene by showing he had the white scarf from the Wives - Slit then showed off the bloodbag's boot in an effort to get invited onto the Gigahorse as well, but was understandably ignored."
MadMax,38ruzr,ZiGraves,7,Sat Jun 6 14:16:26 2015 UTC,"The fantastic thing is that the movie would have functioned fine without it, but because Miller is commited he went to that other level with chronological detail.  It's like the crossbow that was mentioned earlier this week.  Most movies would just show characters using weapons, but Miller clearly had a picture of what every character was doing during most moments."
MadMax,38ruzr,kuuuma,3,Sat Jun 6 18:23:11 2015 UTC,So that's how it goes!! Thanks much for filling in the blanks for me! :D
MadMax,38ruzr,bryanlharris,2,Sat Jun 6 14:25:47 2015 UTC,If Slit was a better friend he would have given Nux the blood bag's boot at that point.
MadMax,38ruzr,LostSoulsAlliance,4,Sat Jun 6 18:46:58 2015 UTC,"Slit was an asshole (like the character and acting, don't get me wrong). He puts down everyone every chance he gets, he's conniving and mean. When that first guys ""chromes"" and goes out in a blaze of glory, everyone else is like ""WITNESS!!"" and he shouts ""MEDIOCRE"" to put down the guy's epic sacrifice."
MadMax,38ruzr,bryanlharris,3,Sat Jun 6 23:21:50 2015 UTC,I think he's calling the spikes car guys mediocre at that point. Isn't he?  I might have to go see it again. :-)
MadMax,38ruzr,MickMickey,8,Sun Jun 7 11:26:55 2015 UTC,"I'd like to take this opportunity to point out the rebirth imagery for anyone who may have missed it. Max rises up from under the sand in a state of confusion, and we hear muffled heartbeat sound effects and hallucinatory flashes of fleshy hues. Later, Nux cuts his chain, which also has his blood running through it, so it's clearly umbilical-severing imagery. It makes a weird little family out of them, since later Max splashes his face with Mother's Milk. This is good visual storytelling, people."
MadMax,38ruzr,Turbofurball,3,Sat Jun 6 21:31:05 2015 UTC,Awesome!
MadMax,38ruzr,GeneralRose,11,Sun Jun 7 02:54:03 2015 UTC,"I think this is one of the things that Fury Road's few negative reviews comes from - it shows you a myriad of unexplained small stories woven together. It doesn't explain anything for you, and many people just miss what's in there ... possibly because they're used to being spoon-fed a longer story from one protagonist's point of view."
MadMax,38ruzr,Turbofurball,11,Sat Jun 6 15:35:29 2015 UTC,"Like most stories we're supposed to be SHOWN things about characters, not just TOLD them. Miller nails this in his writing and directing"

MadMax,38ruzr,Turbofurball,2,Sat Jun 6 19:11:12 2015 UTC,"One thing that really drove this home for me was when I went to see it for the second time. While I don't have epilepsy, strobes and flashes still make me uncomfortable due to sensory issues, so I had my eyes shut for a lot of the storm sequence the first time around. When it had ended, I was a little lost over what was going on for a short while. The second time I saw this film I decided to try and watch all of that scene, and found that I'd missed quite a huge chunk of the story simply by not looking for that minute or so, despite the fact that I could still hear everything. (And I agree with the others here; the visual storytelling and refusal to rely on dialogue and exposition makes this film even more fantastic.)"
MadMax,38ruzr,AtomicKaiser,1 point,Sat Jun 6 23:55:38 2015 UTC,"Not sure why you got downvoted.  I think you must have been misunderstood.  I totally agree with you, people are adjusted to that more straightforward exposition, so a movie lacking that seesm bizarre."

MadMax,38tc89,TreeFiddyBot,3,Sat Jun 6 19:25:34 2015 UTC,"The thing with spraying your mouth full of chrome is and shouting ""Witness me!"" before your death-sacrifice is huge part of the War Boys' culture, along with making the sign of the V8. It's not that it necessarily glorifies violence, it's that it's a part of their culture and their tight-knit group. People want to have a team, to belong to something deeper than the superficial.  If more of the Vuvalini's culture was shown, like the head-touch-neck-grab greeting and grasping at the air to remember someone, you'd be seeing people imitate that too.  It's no different than saying ""May the Force be with you!""  Oh, and when Nux says ""Feels like hope"", that comes like 30 seconds after Max says ""Hope is a mistake"" to Furiosa. There's a reason nobody has latched onto that yet. He doesn't sacrifice himself just for Capable, either, he does it for himself. So he can die a hero and finally have the recognition that he has always wanted, instead of alone in the dark.  Edit: I added in necessarily, context is important."
MadMax,38tc89,gtr427,1 point,Sat Jun 6 20:44:19 2015 UTC,"In the right context, it absolutely does glorify violence. Their whole culture is built around war and blind faith to a malevolent dogmatic leader. Nux's revelation at the end is that, despite his ailments and his impending death (from the disease), he can still do something honorable regardless of a reward. He knows at that point that his death will have meaning to the people he helped saved, not as a final act of glory gaining him entrance to Valhalla. From what I am getting out of this tumblr post, the writer isn't trying to get people to stop using the phrase, but rather recognize the importance of other aspects of the film. Different catch phrases have different meanings inherently. Also I feel like Max is jaded. He has lost all hope. Just because he says that, doesn't mean it is true. Nux finally knows what hope means, and he gives up his life regardless of having a person (Capable) worth carrying for.  Granted, yelling witness me while driving on the highway is fun as fuck, but the writer is just trying to get people to overlook that aspect of the film a bit so the true meaning isn't lost."
MadMax,38tc89,Deathtrip,3,Sat Jun 6 21:24:31 2015 UTC,"You're right, I edited it a little bit for context. I understand what the writer was going for, and I can't argue that it isn't supported by the movie, I just feel like they might be missing something."
MadMax,38tc89,gtr427,2,Sat Jun 6 22:09:56 2015 UTC,"I mean I don't ever expect a bunch of people to start doing the Vuvalini air grab gesture, because, again, yelling witness me or what a lovely day seem to highlight some of the best action sequences of the film, and it's just more fun to do. When it comes down to the bone, however, the film is inherently visual, and that is what will stick in the long term for casual watchers. I think that films with real quality, typically have quality directors. Miller is making a point with this movie, and he is doing it in a way that is bad ass, awe inspiring, visually captivating, and inherently subtle (in terms of what is actually said by the characters about their individual motives/emotions/concerns). He expects people to watch it again and again, each time thinking more and more about the unspoken themes, emotions, narratives, etc. Shit, when I saw it the first time, I was so taken aback, that I hardly knew any of the characters names! I was too involved visually. So rewatching it a few times has allowed me to go in and analyze different scenes and culminate my opinion on what the overarching theme of the film was. It was hope. Immortan has hope for a perfect child and long lasting power; Furiosa and the wives have hope for redemption, retribution, and safety; Nux learns what hope means, and in that short lived embrace, he makes a great sacrifice for others to preserve what he sees as their only hope. Max can only relearn hope, but he knows deep down that he is an agent of change, not a stable person to rely on. It makes him the ultimate drifter. In and out, silent and deadly, cautious yet rabid, untrusting yet loyal."
MadMax,38tc89,Deathtrip,2,Sat Jun 6 22:28:48 2015 UTC,"That was a wonderful reply, but so completely cracked up at ""silent and deadly"""
MadMax,38tc89,Turbofurball,5,Sun Jun 7 11:59:00 2015 UTC,"People are taking this movie way too seriously. I'm going to continue using ""witness me"" for silly and trivial things, not acts of kindness."
MadMax,38tc89,Peanlocket,7,Sat Jun 6 18:57:22 2015 UTC,"This movie is very serious in many ways, and because of that, the writer has a great point. The climactic, high intensity, heart pumping scenes are the ones we will all remember at the drop of a hat, but the movie showcases other scenes that promote the main, overarching message about hope. I don't think this writer is trying to take all of the fun and excitement away, but rather, make sure people realize that it certainly isn't the biggest, most important part of the film. If people idolize violence and destruction, then there are certainly many great violent propaganda films out there with no poignant theme being conveyed (even if there is a theme, it's probably not being conveyed in a way that is good enough to make the audience really think about it deeply). Good directors utilize film as a medium to convey a message about things they experience, or analyze in the world. Miller certainly used this crazy and tumultuous medium to get across his point, namely that there is hope, no matter how dire the situation, or how mad the world can become. The film serves as a warning for the jaded amongst us. It showcases the problems of the world that plague us currently, and how they could eventually lead to our utter downfall. To say that this movie shouldn't be interpreted seriously is a disservice to Miller's intent."
MadMax,38tc89,Deathtrip,1 point,Sat Jun 6 19:26:59 2015 UTC,"I see your point, but telling someone that they can only interpret a movie a certain way is ridiculous, telling people how they should think and feel about a movie is stupid.

MadMax,38tc89,SALT_DONT_GO_NOWHERE,-1,Sat Jun 6 23:06:05 2015 UTC,"Yes but there are degrees of separation between a good interpretation and a bad one. Yes everyone can interpret how they want, but at the end of the day, we are trying to come down to what the director intended it to be. From there we can continue to draw our own conclusions. I'm not trying to pressure anyone into seeing this film a certain way. I am trying to give a reasonable and thought out analysis based on several factors, and much thought."

I think most people know what it stands for, but a group of people love a piece of work so much, they state it by saying a common phrase from the movie. I know what this means to the characters, but it doesn't stop me and my girlfriend from saying these things and showing our love for it."

I'm not telling op that they must take it seriously, but that by not taking it seriously, they are missing out on why the director made the film, and has been making the films in the previous installments. I'm stating my opinion that taking the movie as just an every day action flick is a disservice to the intent of the director. There is a lot more under the surface to this film, and it deserves to be analyzed. If they don't want to, fine. I'm just giving an opposing point of view."

There was a collection set which had all 3 in one case for $29.98 and saved me some shelf space, but it was a 2013 release, whilst the above were a 2015 release and added Audio Descriptions on Thunderdome which was lacking on the 2013 collection. Also, I like having the bit of extra space for photos and layout that you get with one case per movie :)  For historical trivia, $9.98 is also what I paid for the each DVD of Road Warrior and Thunderdome, 6 years ago.

MadMax,38q456,raniwasacyborg,40,Fri Jun 5 21:51:19 2015 UTC,"I thought he was great.  I loved how he unquestioningly followed Furiosa and relayed all the orders back to the team.  There was that sweet door manouver that he did with Furiosa where she locked the accelerator and then they both swung out on the door to take care of that buzzard car, sending it hurtling back into a second car.  That looked like something they'd done a bunch of times, a practiced action, maybe something they'd come up with together on one of the many runs they'd done as a team.  When he puts the puzzle together and tries to grab her neck, it seems like he feels an almost personal betrayal rather than anger at a soldier stepping out of line.  And then she punches him instead of killing him and off he goes into the dust.  I like to think he lived.  Although he had a whole pack of tumours on his neck and he looked to be in his late forties which for a warboy is practically unheard of, I imagine.  He was a great character and a good soldier.  He was probably the only warboy besides Nux that I actually felt a little bad for."
MadMax,38q456,skonen_blades,11,Fri Jun 5 22:34:59 2015 UTC,"Me too! I loved the interaction between him and Furiosa; then this line: ""What have you done?!"""

MadMax,38qti6,jumpyg1258,5,Sat Jun 6 01:03:48 2015 UTC,Yes. Also when Max is crawling out of his crashed car at the start you see a shot of the young girl as a later scene of Immortan's armada drives over her. http://i.imgur.com/3hXk1vd.jpg
MadMax,38qti6,Immortan_Joe,2,Sat Jun 6 01:55:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I was wondering if they were alluding to Max having some kind of ESP or something. It's too weird that both those flashes (and the second including the mask) would perfectly prepare him to intercept that shot."
MadMax,38qti6,deftPirate,2,Sat Jun 6 02:55:32 2015 UTC,I noticed that re-watching it last night. It's as if he's not so much haunted by the girl as being watched over by her.
MadMax,38qti6,BigTimStrange,2,Sat Jun 6 14:50:31 2015 UTC,"I was thinking about this the other day, and I don't think it is meant to be him having ESP or special powers. The way I see it, Max is fully aware that his mental state isn't the best and that he is constantly haunted by those he could not protect. To this end I take the flashes as a glimpse into Max' mind where time may not be flowing quite right and the event may have happened already and that the turbulence in these visions is one way Miller is giving us a cinematic glimpse into Max' fractured mind.   Coincidentally, I really like how Max is being protected by those he couldn't save. It's like he is being saved by his ongoing humanity and compassion for people, despite suffering loss."
MadMax,38qti6,FargusFaustmeister,1 point,Sat Jun 6 16:28:27 2015 UTC,Well if you know the original story line he was a cop who lost his entire family (set back in the 80's where police/civilian relations were not as tense) so this may explain why he has so much PTSD as well as why he's so set on trying to save people.  Also what I meant in parentheses is that in the media and hollywood we tend to root for the bad guy and not the cop these days.
MadMax,38qti6,Mex-Box,2,Sun Jun 7 08:17:46 2015 UTC,"I don't think being a cop explains why he has PTSD because anyone who suffers loss like Max does will have some issues, but like you said it does show that his character is inclined to help others.   My point is that ""special powers"" is likely not what the visions are meant to convey, but rather that Max' survival instincts and trauma are what keep him alive as much as his own skill and determination."
MadMax,38qti6,FargusFaustmeister,1 point,Sun Jun 7 17:50:13 2015 UTC,It's one of those little details that makes the film so cool. Whether it's esp or just a massive coincidence that saved him it's not important. It's something that I really hope Miller never explains.
MadMax,38rbwd,sombray,12,Sat Jun 6 03:46:56 2015 UTC,"My name is Max, my world is fire and blood. Once I was a cop, a Road Warrior, searching for a righteous cause. As the world fell each of us in our own way was broken. It was hard to know who was more crazy, me, or everyone else. Here they come again, worming there way into the black matter of my brain. I tell myself they cannot touch me, they are long dead. I am the one who runs from both the living and the dead. Hunted by scavengers, haunted by those I could not protect.

I'd love to see George Miller get one more story out but I can't imagine these movies are easy to make for a 70-year-old man.  And I don't trust anyone else to do it.  I don't know.

MadMax,38rl5m,Chessiecat,1 point,Sat Jun 6 09:33:45 2015 UTC,"not not a ""massive"" box office success relative to costs.  they pretty much ALWAYS sign stars up for sequels. That's just standard operating, but meaningless information when trying to work out if they'll make sequels.   The cult following (of both the originals as well as the new), and fantastic critical acclaim of the new - are both very good things for sequel chances. It's been speculated for Oscar nominations too, and if it wins a few (music, editing, screenplay seem the most likely), that will help greatly too.   I hope they will. I think there is a better than evens chance that they will. But nothing is ever set in stone in the movie industry."
MadMax,38rl5m,nemothorx,1 point,Sat Jun 6 10:00:36 2015 UTC,Tom Hardy was signed on for sequels long before the movie released. Normal operating procedure and doesn't ever mean a sequel is going to be made. Just means the studio wants that option in the future.
MadMax,38rl5m,Delita232,1 point,Sat Jun 6 22:42:32 2015 UTC,"A lot of that budget went to cost overruns. The delay caused by rains that made the Australian landscape too green ended up costing them for example.   Despite the overruns the studio gave Miller more money to flesh out the final scene which is practically unheard of for a film that's gone over budget.  It had a very strong showing in America for an R-rated film and in Asia it was #1 for 3 weeks so I'd say as long as the studio is confident that hey won't have a repeat of the costly delays Fury Road dealt with, the chance of a sequel is very, very good."

MadMax,38rc12,starkimus,6,Sat Jun 6 03:48:12 2015 UTC,"When they are spitting into the intake is it gas and does that work?   Yes. It adds more gas into the combustion chamber.   When the engine cuts out on the War rig, what happened to it and what did Nux have to do to repair it?   Plot stuff happened to it and he had to do plot stuff to fix it. He was able to work on it while it was running because the War Rig has two engines, so there's probably a way to disengage one engine and work on it while the other one moves the rig."
MadMax,38rc12,iwanttogotohell,3,Sat Jun 6 04:02:23 2015 UTC,http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_injection_(engine)  That may be the likely source for the spitting. Found out that this was discussed prior.   The disengaging of an engine could make sense. I've never worked on a vehicle with more than 1 so I wouldn't know if that's possible but it seems more likely.
MadMax,38rc12,iwanttogotohell,4,Sat Jun 6 04:05:33 2015 UTC,"No, it's obviously gasoline they're spitting into the engines. Spraying gas into the blower would add more gas into the combustion chamber for each cylinder and make the engine fire faster. Kind of like the afterburners on a jet."

MadMax,38rc12,Bewareofbears,3,Sat Jun 6 04:45:50 2015 UTC,"Water injection (engine):       In internal combustion engines, water injection, also known as anti-detonant injection (ADI), can spray water into the incoming air or fuel-air mixture, or directly into the cylinder, in order to cool certain parts of the induction system where ""hot points"" could produce premature ignition.  It was used historically to increase the power output of military aviation engines for short durations such as dogfights or takeoff, however it has also been used in motor sport and notably in drag racing. In Otto cycle engines the cooling effects of water injection also allow for greater compression ratios by reducing the problem of engine knocking (detonation). Alternately this reduction in engine knocking in Otto cycle engines means that in some applications significant performance gains can be obtained when water injection is used in conjunction with a supercharger, turbocharger and/or other modifications such as a more aggressive ignition timing.  Depending on the engine, improvements in power and fuel efficiency can also be obtained solely by injecting water.  Water injection may also be used to reduce NOx or carbon monoxide emissions.

MadMax,38u74c,Frosssty,9,Sat Jun 6 21:26:14 2015 UTC,"To each of their own. I personally loved the movie and instantly went into my top 15 movies, if not higher. It was my favorite Mad Max movies, and I honestly thought nothing would out do The Road Warrior. I loved the attention to detail, the characters, the simplicity of the story, and the great action, but I'm not here to change your mind, and I can see how the hype can possibly over do it for some people."
MadMax,38u74c,HoustonsSolution,-15,Sat Jun 6 21:29:04 2015 UTC,"top 15? come on dude, there is no way one can argue that without a huge bias for the movie."

MadMax,38u74c,teaqualizer,-9,Sat Jun 6 21:38:40 2015 UTC,"I saw it yesterday and wouldn't give it much more than a 6/10 for the great scenes and uniqueness. But acting, story, character development and plot was just silly. Outside of Max and Furiosa, i cant recall a single persons name.   The movie was literally the same scene over and over and then once backwards. How can a group of 100 people, all with guns, not once get a good shot at the people in the truck? Did they once use the mounted .50 cals? Silly movie IMO"

MadMax,38u74c,HoustonsSolution,6,Sat Jun 6 21:36:55 2015 UTC,I would recommend them. They are low budget (especially the first one) but it's easy to see George Miller's talent from the beginning and how he grows from Mad Max to Road Warrior.

I wasn't disappointed at all, but your points, while I disagree with many of them, I do appreciate anyone who doesn't blindly hate and keeps themselves from being tossed into a troll category (luckily the sub seems free of, knock on wood)"
MadMax,38ubzy,HoustonsSolution,-7,Sat Jun 6 22:18:28 2015 UTC,"What in particular did you disagree with? I know I'm making a radical point about furiosa. But I do genuinely think she's just bait. Is this possibly just because I'm a sexist fuck? Maybe, but I do think it questionable that all the war boys are the smokers from L4D2 and here's this beautiful lady just hangin out untouched."
MadMax,38ubzy,HoustonsSolution,6,Sat Jun 6 22:21:08 2015 UTC,"Talking about how ridiculous the movie was in parts, which it was supposed to be. This movie doesn't take itself seriously, and that helps the enjoyment. I thought the acting was great, and all the characters had varying personalities, but the lack of exposition can make it harder for some audience members to notice this without numerous viewings, which is something else I enjoyed. It's all about how somebody likes a movie laid out, and maybe you simply didn't like how it was handled versus other people.  Furiosa, in my opinion, is a strong female character. The way she looks, shouldn't hinder how she handles herself and her characterization in full. Beautiful women can be strong characters and in this world, she has to be one of the strongest if you haven't pampered (like what Joe did for his wives) and like I mentioned, it's supposed to be ridiculous that she can pull off these stunts. Keep in mind, during the fight with Max, they were both at a disadvantage. And the wives did help when they could, one threw Furiosa the bolt cutters, they pulled on the chains, and that's more action than they have probably ever seen."
MadMax,38ubzy,HoustonsSolution,-8,Sat Jun 6 22:31:41 2015 UTC,But that's my problem with furiosa- she CAN'T be beautiful. Even the best looking war boys are covered with monstrous cysts. So why isn't she? Because the directer didn't think we could find an ugly woman appealing.
MadMax,38ubzy,teaqualizer,5,Sat Jun 6 22:47:05 2015 UTC,"Or she was potential to be one of his breeders (which may be why she was kidnapped) which means she would have to be healthy. She could have found to be barren, but was found to be useful as a soldier and made her way to be high ranking."
MadMax,38ubzy,LostSoulsAlliance,-7,Sat Jun 6 22:52:29 2015 UTC,If she was so useful then how come she did not develop scars like the others?  And why would she be barren? Is she one of the 1/1000 people on earth who are COMPLETELY sterile? Why wouldn't she become a milk mother? She has functioning breasts as we can see.
MadMax,38ubzy,MrMcDoll,3,Sat Jun 6 22:56:55 2015 UTC,Scars? She's missing her arm. She could be sterile from whatever caused the world to end or anything else that cause one to be barren. Larger women became milk mothers and she's fairly petite compared to the milk mothers.

MadMax,38ubzy,OrangeTux,9,Sat Jun 6 22:32:13 2015 UTC,"You need to start using your brain. I'll give you a few hints to start you on your way:   Why is Furiosa able to hold her own against Max?   a. Max is not super human.  b. Max has been hanging upside down for some time, probably not fed, very thirsty, strapped to the front of a vehicle with his hands secured behind his back, is locked into a face mask, and has had his blood slowly drained from his body for a while. (perhaps you had your eyes shut for the first 45 minutes of the movie....?)  c. Furiosa is a very fit woman, apparently well taken care of and very capable who is in good condition.  d. There are five other women who are also young, fit, well-fed and in good condition helping her.  e. And lastly in case you missed it (which apparently you did), Max was FRICKING CHAINED TO ANOTHER MAN WHO WAS KNOCKED OUT, so he was dragging around at least 150 lbs of dead weight.  Apparently in your misogynistic brain those are not good enough reasons for a man to be equally matched by a woman...but to continue...  The five wives ARE SUPPOSED TO BE physically perfect, clean and model-like.  THAT'S THE POINT. Why do you think they're so highly valued and kept in a frickin' safe?! THEY SPENT THE WHOLE MOVIE TRYING TO CAPTURE THESE WOMEN. Were you in the theater when the movie was playing? I'm beginning to think you were watching Pitch Perfect 2 during most of this movie, but it was shown right there on the screen.  And yes, the wives are spoiled and ""bitchy"". They are Immortan Joe's prized possessions. Outside of the lack of freedom and raping, they get all the water they want, the best food available, an education, and culture and you could probably rightly assume they were held above almost everyone else. Again, that was the point. Since you were probably out for another popcorn run, there was a point where Joe opens the ""safe"" house, and there is a clean pool of water, five classroom tables and a black board, a ton of books, a piano and chandelier, not to mention green plants. These girls are the sultan's harem, as it were.  So if these girls come across as spoiled and a bit bitchy, then that's because these ""crappy actresses"" did their job. The fact the you didn't understand why reflects on your ability to understand what's presented plainly in the clearest of terms.  Seeing as how every cinematographer and cinematographic association I've seen is lavishing praise on the way this was shot and edited makes me think you don't know what good camerawork is, even when you're sitting in front of a 120 minute, 22'x52' example of it.  Mad Max spoke as much as he needed to. You seem to claim you've seen the prior films, but you don't seem to recall he never said much there either. Not to mention that this particular Mad Max story focuses on him having completely gone feral and thus has nearly lost the ability to speak. If the one of the points of the story is Max learning to communicate with humanity again, then it would seem to make sense that he wouldn't go about like a Chatty Cathy now, wouldn't it?  The War Boys were great! You know why? Obviously not, so I'll tell you: at the beginning the audience has the typical expectation that these guys are purely expendable henchman. By then end, you realize (again if you've paid attention) that these are boys that have been misled and indoctrinated, and they're complex characters. Especially Nux. In a typical action movie, you'd never learn a single ""henchman's"" name, but here you know Nux, Slit and Ace. You don't necessarily like them all, but you learn something about them and their motivation and character. There's depth there if you simply look.  As for you comment about the ""no sound other than their voice and the music, blah blah blah""...do you realize the idiocy of that statement there and of itself? ""BLAH BLAH It's not realistic because we could hear their voices and music but not the engines""--so the music coming out of nowhere is perfectly ok, but that the editors chose that you hear the dialog and music over the sound of motors bothers you? I'm guessing you prefer this:  ""Furiosa [rumble blaattt] where are [rrrrrr whawhawharrrr] ng?""  ""What?""  ""I [rumble rumble, roar], ok!""  ""What?""  ""....[rumble rumble rrrrrr chickchchkchk]...""  "".......yeah ok.""  The apparent fact that you're unable to watch a movie that clearly and directly shows you exactly what's going on and yet not understand any of it reflects more on you than it does on the movie.  I give your critique 2/10. I'd rather not have witnessed it."

MadMax,38rodc,Derpatologist_7,2,Sat Jun 6 16:52:08 2015 UTC,"Like the other poster said, there's no firm timeline, however, the first film seems to indicate that global war hasn't happened yet, but there is definitely an oil/energy crisis and bands of gangs are out of control, but life seems fairly normal(ish).  Film two indicates that the world has gone to shit and there has been thermonuclear war and now the wasteland is filled with gangs and marauders. Resources are scarce, life means very little.  The 3rd movie shows it's pretty clear that life as we know it is gone, a fading memory.   Again, there's no distinct time line, and in fact, the only time I've seen a date mentioned was in Mad Max 3 Beyond Thunderdome where a group of kids Max was helping said the captain of the plane their parents had crashed in was 1999, and the events of Beyond Thunderdome was possibly between 2016-2018.  I've been thinking that if we were to try and attribute dates we could possibly surmise that he first film was set around the mid 1990's and the second film around 1999(ish), but the problem is that if the timeline I've mapped out is right or close then in Fury Road, Max would be or should be approximately mid 50's in age."

MadMax,38lson,Youwhatwhatwhat,27,Fri Jun 5 03:50:27 2015 UTC,"If the budget for the film is really ~$150mil, and it's approaching 2x that, then it's not really struggling in my opinion.   Agree that the follow-on to this one should be pretty big at opening though.   I've only seen MM:FR once and I'm dying to see it again. TAKE MY MONEY!!!"
MadMax,38lson,Beerificus,9,Fri Jun 5 04:52:35 2015 UTC,"Movie profitability isn't just about making its production budget back.  It's far from an exact science but the conventional short-hand is that a movie costs about as much to advertise / distribute as it does to make.  I have no idea what MMFR's ad costs were but the quick and dirty wisdom would suggest that it isn't gonna be in the ""safe zone"" until it hits 300 million, and that alone isn't enough to make a sequel a sure thing.  I wouldn't say MMFR is struggling, but it isn't flourishing either.  If we want to see more Mad Max then we gotta keep that word of mouth flowing and not feel cocky that we're definitely getting another in a couple of years.  That being said, I'm optimistic that we're gonna get more Mad Max.  Critical reception doesn't matter as much as box office but a 98% on RottenTomatoes makes people notice.  Combine that with two written scripts that are presumably production ready or close to it and a rising star that's signed on for four more, there's a lot going for it.  Franchise potential is a good thing for green light potential.  If it manages to pull off a high profile Oscar or two then its odds will further improve.  But it's definitely not a slam dunk and I wouldn't feel too comfy about it until we hear a green light announcement."
MadMax,38lson,SerrisHawk,6,Fri Jun 5 05:23:57 2015 UTC,"Some great points! Thanks for your insights.   I have done what I can, and continue to do so, in the way of 'word of mouth promotion.' I can't help myself if anyone mentions the movie at work or something like that. ""You ALL need to see it right now! RIGHT NOW!"" It's a great movie action wise & surprisingly does not come off as if it's stuffed full of visual effects, which I think people are becoming complacent to.   I'm in for another couple viewings while it's still in theaters, so I'll do my part to make it stick & gain credit for a follow-on."
MadMax,38lson,Beerificus,3,Fri Jun 5 05:34:47 2015 UTC,"I found this - http://pro.boxoffice.com/statistics/movies/mad-max-fury-road-2015  Which, though admittedly I haven't read further to find out where the budget figure is from, would suggest that $210m is the total budget, presumably including the already known $150m actual film budget and $60m advertising, distribution and misc.  If that $210m is correct, then they've already passed both the film budget and the total budget and are well into actual profit territory. Plus whatever they're gonna rake in once they start making actual merch available other than just the Art Book, plus whatever they're gonna make from DVD & blu-ray sales and repertory showings.  MMFR should be pure money at this point, I think."
MadMax,38lson,ZiGraves,2,Fri Jun 5 11:51:13 2015 UTC,"Studios only get back half the box office take in the US, and about 40% of the box office take overseas.  So the money they've gotten back so far is around the $140 mil mark with a $284 worldwide gross.  So not in profit yet.  The other issue is that it is a sliding scale - the longer a film stays in theaters, the higher the percentage goes to the studio."
MadMax,38lson,thedangerman007,2,Fri Jun 5 14:28:09 2015 UTC,"If that $210m is correct, then they've already passed both the film budget and the total budget and are well into actual profit territory.   No they aren't. Remember that studios don't get 100% of ticket prices. Theatres, distributors, cinemas etc. takes their cut.  But of course there are also all the merchandise, sponsor deals, dvd/blu-ray/iTunes/, tv-rights etc. that will also make money for them."
MadMax,38lson,IndyBrodaSolo,5,Fri Jun 5 12:51:41 2015 UTC,"I just mentioned all the merchandise, dvd & blu-ray sales, etc. right there in my post. I can't tell whether you're trying to argue with me and then present my point back to me, or whether you're trying to agree.  The source for the figure also appears to include distribution as part of that $60m on top of the original production budget, since P&A covers both the advertising and the necessary printing/copies of the film itself that have to go to the cinemas.  Cinemas get a small cut of the actual ticket sales these days - as little as 10-20% in the opening weekend, gradually scaling up from there toward 70% by the fifth week if it gets that far- so it's not unreasonable to consider the vast majority of MMFR's box office takings having gone to the studio so far and only now starting to tip more in favour of the cinemas as the run extends."
MadMax,38lson,ZiGraves,2,Fri Jun 5 13:26:11 2015 UTC,I was wondering about the other merch as well. I've got both the artists and the art book coming my way whereas folks who are eating up Pitch Perfect 2 won't be buying anything accessory to the cinema experience.

Our heroes are the Slick Six, a group of international criminals who set out to alleviate the worst of these conditions and put America on the road to recovery. Liberation is a story about living down the past, personally and nationally; about being able to laugh at the punch line to the long, dark joke of American history.

MadMax,38npp0,Dr__Apocalypse,2,Fri Jun 5 19:10:32 2015 UTC,"I think the Lord humungus has him beat in terms of raw strength and physical capability, Joe is not a well man after all, he's dependent on a respirator just to go outside. He also controls his men not through some kind of religion, but through respect and sound leadership. In his prime though, back when he was still just Colonel Joe Moore, and later on leader of a biker gang, that might have been a different story.  My guess is that if they were both to fight as they're depicted in the films the Lord Humungus would probably kick his ass. Punctuating the beating with a ""Joe, do you even lift?"" one-liner before crushing his skull."
MadMax,38npp0,Dr__Apocalypse,2,Fri Jun 5 19:18:08 2015 UTC,"Our big argument in favor of Joe was his amount of resources and control. The Citadel was a powerhouse base of operations, Humungus seemed to be more of a rover gang with no place to call home.

In historical context though, I'd think Joe would have likely been in a position of leadership very similar to that of the Humungus earlier in his career, back when he was still the leader of a biker gang. The advantage of the citadel is the constant supply of water, and the gas refinery and ammo manufacturer's nearby. Otherwise, survival would dictate a more nomadic life-style."

Are you playing with the backstory at all?  Tom Hardy: That’s hard to say, so, George says one thing, and that’s what goes. My understanding of it was, because we’re in the desert, because we had to move from Broken Hill, which is clearly Australian, and it’s a very different environment because of the landscape, which is clearly a huge character in it. Then I imagined, if this is post-apocalyptic now, what kind of policeman or police officer would he be? I had him more coming from private risk management companies or from that territory — the military, special forces. So that’s why you’ve got the rig on top of the classic silhouette, and ear piece for his team. So yes police, but in a different world police kind of territory."

According to an interview and someone who apparently seen a few of the test previews - there where scenes that had Max frantically re-inserting the headset as some sort of ""comforter"".   This was changed in more of the test previews - including the opening monologue which was from the perspective of another person (like Mad Max 2). The remnants of this is in Trailer 1 where he says ""Everyone's gone out of their mind - you're not the only one Max"".

MadMax,38mgmh,DeliciousToastie,1 point,Sat Jun 6 17:54:16 2015 UTC,"Neither did I - but I don't think we'll get those scenes in the BluRay, usually scenes from test previews never make it onto the home release because they're removed to get closer to a final cut of the film. However, from what I've seen in the trailers - there might be some scenes in the deleted scenes:   One of the Wives putting her index and middle finger together to focus on one of the war parties heading towards the rig. Immortan Joe slamming his hand down on the roof of the Giga Horse. Furiosa looking into the distance of the Bog while standing through the opening of the roof on the War Rig. Furiosa putting her metal hand onto the roof of the Rig while she's driving."

MadMax,38mn3v,VforVickers,6,Fri Jun 5 14:33:22 2015 UTC,She applies it again before she goes into the canyon to meet the biker gang so at that point it was probably to ensure they recognised her from a distance. Someone already linked to an image of what may well be other imperators with the same makeup. It's probably not usually applied in the form of tyre grease but knowing the level of paranoia the biker gang has she probably just improvised a means to give herself the standard imperator markings that they would be looking out for.

MadMax,38mn3v,DuDEwithAGuN,6,Fri Jun 5 05:47:51 2015 UTC,I figured it was a anti-sun measure and glare. Along with the white-powder the warboys have on them.
MadMax,38mn3v,AtomicKaiser,1 point,Fri Jun 5 07:58:00 2015 UTC,"To reduce glare, they would put it on under the eyes a la football players. I think it was a measure of rank (all the Imperators have it)."

MadMax,38nc1a,muchgreaterthanG_O_D,3,Fri Jun 5 09:28:50 2015 UTC,"Aw man I'm exhausted and can't give you as good of an answer as could be interpreted  It seemed to me many people had genetic deficiencies in the citadel. The people down below begging for water seemed like they were deformed, blistered, missing limbs etc.  Basically those women weren't selected just for being good looking, they also have stronger/ less damaged genetics. When the citadel bandits were excited about that dead maidens baby being healthy, they most likely meant non malformed.  There's other references throughout the movie, like the old lady looking in the back of the maidens mouth and saying ""this one has all her teeth!!"""
MadMax,38nc1a,m_dubb,3,Fri Jun 5 09:39:08 2015 UTC,"So the women of the citadel were either used for breeding and then presumably milking, fighting (I only saw Furiosa), or were left at the bottom?  As far lady, i took that as meaning that the wives had led a spoiled life, free from the hardships the rest of humanity faced."
MadMax,38nc1a,m_dubb,2,Fri Jun 5 15:32:09 2015 UTC,"You might be right about the lady. There was at least one more really big example but I can't seem to remember it. :/  So yeah, healthy boys become warboys, girls become maidens or mothers to milk, and everyone else deformed or unfit gets tossed to the people below.   Of course, this is mostly interpretation but with the way they talk about genetics and health it seems to add up perfectly. Like even Max's tattoo seems like it could go either way- some could just be referencing battle wounds, some like lumps and bumps could be about deformations.  EDIT before this said ""I'm unsure if the warboys get to have kids"". That's wrong. In retrospect, Immorton Joe (Warchief) doesn't even know Nux or most of the boys' names, yet his other children are coveted. It's safe to assume that Joe had the terrible genes (respirator son, wheelchair deformed son). This also would make more sense of the accounting guy (with the big feet Max uses as a human shied) who's really upset with how much they've wasted. If those maidens were the only source of the Warboys, I think he'd care more."
MadMax,38nc1a,VforVickers,4,Fri Jun 5 15:53:08 2015 UTC,"His five wives are his most precious ""possessions"" because they're beautiful and - more importantly - healthy.  The other women in the citadel either work for Joe like Furiosa or they're used for breeding.  The war boys come from the women. They're raised to be warboys and start out as mechanics. If they're lucky enough (and live long enough) they get to be drivers when they're older."
MadMax,38nc1a,skonen_blades,5,Fri Jun 5 10:12:39 2015 UTC,"I get the impression that the warboys also come from kidnapped children, too.  Like Furiosa was kidnapped from the green place."
MadMax,38nc1a,VforVickers,3,Fri Jun 5 15:48:52 2015 UTC,Good point.
MadMax,38nc1a,WhoreMoans69,3,Fri Jun 5 15:55:03 2015 UTC,That's good to know about the ranking of the war boys. It makes sense why they had the scene where they all ran to get their steering wheels. The wheel was a very symbolic thing to them.
MadMax,38nc1a,PCLD,2,Fri Jun 5 15:21:26 2015 UTC,"Adding on to the other two answers, there were a lot of women being used to produce mother's milk."

MadMax,38nc1a,teaqualizer,0,Sun Jun 7 18:17:32 2015 UTC,What I don't get is assuming it's true that all of the war boys are Joes progeny that have been given war boy status because of their half life why is Corpus Colossus given such a high privilege? (CC is the naked midget character) It makes sense for Rictus as a healthy male specimen to be elevated to heir status but not CC.  How do we know that the war boys are Joe's children? I can't remember that ever being said or even implied.
MadMax,38nc1a,skonen_blades,4,Fri Jun 5 13:29:29 2015 UTC,"Corpus Colossus is Joe's son, hence the high privilege.  As for the other war boys, they could very well be the sons of previous warboys and men working for Joe."

I mean, being an imperator in Joe's army, he should know her pretty damn well.  Perhaps there's something in her past that Joe doesn't know about, but asking ""remember me"" sure doesn't put that in a context or allow Joe to remember in any way..."
MadMax,38lkkj,zolikk,1 point,Fri Jun 5 11:27:09 2015 UTC,Nah it's just supposed to be a badass finishing quip. Standard fare for action movies.
MadMax,38lkkj,timothytia,2,Fri Jun 5 19:22:12 2015 UTC,"But... it doesn't make sense as a badass finishing quip unless it actually has meaning. It is not interchangeable with other contextless lines, like ""Got your ass"" or alike.  It's actually pointing at some event in the past, like a sort of true revelation of the hero's identity to the villain right before killing him - to drive a point through. Except the revelation is not there, and there isn't even a possible justifiable scenario in which there would be some.  Joe is implied to know Furiosa, and at no point is any extra information presented to Joe about Furiosa that would give context to the phrase. (edit: Jon != Joe)"
MadMax,38lkkj,zolikk,4,Fri Jun 5 20:20:03 2015 UTC,"I have a theory both about that line, and Furiosa as a whole.  Clearly, Immortan Joe collects healthy young women to breed children. Furiosa, while kidnapped as a child, was likely a candidate to be one of his wives. However, something becomes clear; she must be infertile. She was likely raped a few times before Joe realized no children would result. There is little other reason why a healthy young woman in her fertile years would be an Imperator, rather than part of Joe's creepy wife collection.  My guess about how she journeys to become an Imperator is possibly that she was then going to be given by Joe to one of his high ranking officials, who she then killed. Or possibly she was just thrown to the wolves and she clawed her way up.  It is also possible that the fertility theory is all wrong and Joe rejected her because of her missing arm, which is possibly if he only wants the most untouched, perfect of women. That only explains it if she lost the arm early, however, before she reached the age of fertility...which meant she lost it pretty young."
MadMax,38lkkj,craftygamergirl,1 point,Sat Jun 6 18:46:49 2015 UTC,"Interesting, engaging theory. But still, Joe should have known about all this (i.e. what he supposedly did to her etc.)... I don't think he'd be so much in the darkness about one of his officers. It would require him not even coming in contact with or knowing the origins or appearance of one of his officers, essentially. It's in the realm of possibility, but again, not pointed to by anything in the movie."
MadMax,38lkkj,zolikk,4,Sat Jun 6 19:12:20 2015 UTC,"No I meant she is saying remember me, remember what you did to me...I never forgot, even though I served you for a long time and you even came to trust me. It also explains how she even knew or came into contact with the wives; yes she was female and couldn't impregnate them but she also may have been in the same living area before.  Also she could just mean remember me in Hell, which is presumably where psychos like him end up."
MadMax,38lkkj,craftygamergirl,1 point,Sat Jun 6 19:31:02 2015 UTC,"Well, it does make good sense at least. Including it as part of the premise somehow (like a mid-movie revelation to the audience) would solve this issue. It should've been pointed to in some way in the movie..."

It was a very small moment but, looking back, I think was the closest we saw to him laughing or smiling. It added a lot and could have been so completely awkward, but works really well."

MadMax,38ko0w,VforVickers,4,Thu Jun 4 20:59:15 2015 UTC,You can see the war rig in the distance in both shots. In the comicon footage the war rig looks a lot closer than the way it's positioned in the trailer footage. If they decided that the war rig looked too close in the original shot in terms of the overall geography of the chase then moving the war rig back further in the shot and not having the war party visible in the shot of the flares suggests a more plausible gap between the heavy truck and the more zippy vehicles.  Proof they were right to change it? No threads here asking how they couldn't catch them over such a short distance. It's that attention to detail and continuity that makes it such an engrossing film. Miller's understanding of audience perception of geography and time is most impressive.
MadMax,38ko0w,teaqualizer,1 point,Thu Jun 4 21:50:52 2015 UTC,"The war party seems to be in a similar position - it's just the dust clouds they're leaving behind that have been changed. As for the changes, it's not just the positioning of the war rig that changed. It's a lot of landscape tweaks and the flare trails that have changed too.  The changed version doesn't look bad and I know there have been changes in other shots too but it does make me wonder how many shots were changed (aside from skies and colour grading and the known CGI shots)."
MadMax,38ko0w,teaqualizer,1 point,Fri Jun 5 08:09:22 2015 UTC,If you listen to some of Millers interviews he says that 90 percent of the shots feature some sort of digital augmentation. For Miller the ability to remove harnesses and rigs in post production meant the possibly of pushing the stunts further. Still safe but more spectacular.
MadMax,38ko0w,Snake-Oil,1 point,Fri Jun 5 12:57:59 2015 UTC,Huh. Not sure why'd they do that. Maybe the War party was supposed to be heading towards the cameras view in that trailer? Who knows.

MadMax,38isow,pickelsurprise,13,Thu Jun 4 14:26:02 2015 UTC,I don't think it's meant to have a literal medical meaning so much as it's just a phrase that the organic mechanic uses as shorthand to indicate to non medically-minded (but very automotive-minded) folks that his blood is very good.  Presumably it's some combination of features like * no diseases * no clotting issues * good oxygen carrying ability as per your speculation * good blood pressure * etc
MadMax,38isow,nemothorx,6,Thu Jun 4 14:44:48 2015 UTC,"No idea what their talking about, but octane is a measure of how explosive a fuel is. The higher the octane the less explosive. When you compress fuel and air you get heat. Higher compression means more heat. You want a less explosive fuel there so it wont ignite from the heat before the sparkplug ignites it. If it ignites before, you get pre detonation which is very bad.   Oh yeah...higher compression means more power. Thats why people associate high octane with power."

Interestingly, there is something akin to ""high octane blood"" - have you heard of EPO/blood doping?   I think that's analogous to high octane fuel, but I don't know much about the latter."
MadMax,38isow,551usersherenow,2,Fri Jun 5 06:30:57 2015 UTC,"Blood doping:       Blood doping is the practice of boosting the number of red blood cells in the bloodstream in order to enhance athletic performance. Because such blood cells carry oxygen from the lungs to the muscles, a higher concentration in the blood can improve an athlete’s aerobic capacity (VO2 max) and endurance.  Many methods of blood doping are illegal, particularly in professional sports.

MadMax,38isow,autowikibot,3,Fri Jun 5 06:31:02 2015 UTC,"The Citadel clearly has some sort of way to test a person's blood, so there's no reason they wouldn't know more then just your blood type.Max may be a little scrambled in the brain-area,  but he's young, athletic, disease-free, not malnurished or dehydrated, and very physically fit. Considering where they found him, he's in REALLY good shape... you know, except for the part where he's crazy for co-co puffs. Which sort of sums up Max pretty well, now that I think of it.   Although there weren't very many Blood Bags hanging there, so my guess is any captives who weren't fit to be blood bags just weren't kept around. There aren't THAT many cages.   Oddly enough, highly trained athletes usually have a lower then usual amount of red blood cells due to the amount of muscle they have to supply (it's called ""sports anemia""). BUT well-adapted athletes can compensate for this with higher-then-usual cell regeneration rates, resulting in younger cells. So if Max was the physical equivalent of, say, a tri-athlete, his red blood cell count would be low, but it would be high in hemoglobin and he'd be able to produce a lot of it very quickly, especially if he was fed a diet with a lot of iron in it."
MadMax,38isow,IdiotsLantern,5,Fri Jun 5 08:09:12 2015 UTC,"My question is, how do they determine his blood type? The wastelanders don't seem to have much in the way of medical technology. Do they just hook him up to a war boy and if they die Max is not a universal donor?"

I think the idea is supposed to be that this is such a toxic environment that infection is relatively low on the list of things that will kill you so no one really worries about it.

Since Max is strong and healthy, his blood is considered better, both for the legitimate reason that it's more useful than that of less-healthy individuals, as well as the fact that it's supposed to confer some amount of the donor's strength and vitality."
MadMax,38isow,izlude7027,1 point,Thu Jun 4 21:53:53 2015 UTC,"Actually, you're not far off - the higher a person's red blood cell content, the more oxygen they can carry, and thus the longer and stronger they can perform athletically without tiring out.  It's why high-altitude training is a thing (thinner air forces you to develop higher RBC concentrations to compensate, so when you go back down to sea level you've got more oxygen carrying potential) and why a lot of professional athletes have gotten in trouble for ""blood doping"" (having doctors filter red blood cells out from their blood many weeks in advance and store them, so that come event-day they can have the RBC's reinjected and massively amp up their blood's oxygen-carrying potential.)"

Furiosa's wound meant blood was getting into her chest cavity and couldn't get out. This blood was filling the space her lungs occupy, meaning they couldn't work.

Let me explain by analogy:  I leave the house to do stuff. I come home. I leave the house again!  Not all ""do stuff"" is equivalent. If it's ""boring job, go home"" then it's no big deal. If it's ""hang out with friends and see amazing car chase movie that blows my mind that I then talk about for weeks"", then it's a big deal - something I look forward to prior, and something I remember fondly afterwards.   Valhalla I see as the same. It's not just a pit-stop. It's the spiritual gold-class lounge where only the best war-boys go, and possibly where they think Immortan Joe hangs out too!"

MadMax,38fkeh,sirenmika,7,Fri Jun 5 10:17:30 2015 UTC,"To me, this sounds like a better game idea in and of itself then all of Savage Road. I am hoping for a game that transcends the storyline limitations of just following Max around, instead becoming a unique sort of MMORPG (with many different functions to the game, such as the vehicle battles you describe) set in the world of Max's wasteland. From this perspective, I really don't see being satisfied with what Savage Road seems to involve."
MadMax,38fkeh,Cancerslug,7,Thu Jun 4 00:50:29 2015 UTC,"I think that something almost like the GTV Online Heists or the Pay Day heists could work well with this.   You have objectives and you get to plan out the steps you will take along with any defensive strategies and weapons you want to take with you. You set off and everyone has a role to play. It would be easy as the War Rig to set a task and just defend, theoretically. Until you factor in that the attacking team gets to know the lay of the land and has people stationed around the map at different points where they believe the war rig will go (or where they force it to go). You could have some people on the attacking team shoot far ahead and set up sand traps like we see in the very first moment of the War Rig going off the path in the movie.   Honestly, so behind this. It makes so much sense."
MadMax,38fkeh,AdaptationAgency,3,Thu Jun 4 00:29:48 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately the game will no have multiplayer. If it's being built on the same engine as Just Cause though, MP may be modded in later."
MadMax,38fkeh,nemothorx,3,Thu Jun 4 06:06:28 2015 UTC,I had the exact same idea and am already working on modding gta5 for this  There is a rogue-like game like this. It's called Convoy and is a lesser version of FTL on wheels
MadMax,38fkeh,skonen_blades,2,Thu Jun 4 16:45:33 2015 UTC,That soundslike a pretty cool idea
MadMax,38fkeh,Gnarbage,2,Wed Jun 3 22:39:12 2015 UTC,"Oh my god a multiplayer Mad Max team v team Protect The War Rig game would be insane if it was done right.  Great, great idea.  Hopefully that happens one day.  I get the feeling the game that's coming out was rushed to market."

MadMax,38gzov,handull,51,Thu Jun 4 03:40:15 2015 UTC,"George Miller called this the scene where Max ""gives himself"" to Furiosa.   ...That is literally what he is doing. He is saving her life by giving her of his own body. It's entirely platonic, and totally justified by the circumstances. Still...saying you ""gave yourself"" to someone usually has a very different meaning. So the subtext was there, and George Miller was clearly aware of it.  That's one of the reasons he wanted Margaret Sixel as his editor. She'd mostly cut dramas and he knew that scene especially would need a very delicate touch.   Also, ""Giving yourself"" to someone, in it's most common usage, also usually doesn't describe things from the boy's side. Girls ""give themselves,"" boys ""score home runs."" So they are doing some stuff with gender roles here.   One could even see a kind of parental theme to the scene too, with the tube as the stand in for an umbilical cord, and Max as a stand in for the mother who was probably the last person who was ever kind to her. Themes of creating and nurturing life are all over this movie. That's just not something you get to see male characters be. After all of the explosions and fighting is done, Max's big hero moment was as a healer and a life-giver, rather then a destroyer.   Max is a ""universal donor"" able to share his life force with others who don't have enough of it. If you are weak, he can reinforce your strength with his strength. Almost like George Miller is of the opinion that there's more to masculinity then just punching people."

MadMax,38g6ga,heart-station,2,Thu Jun 4 00:16:40 2015 UTC,I'd watch that every Saturday morning for two seasons.
MadMax,38j8ft,The__Ugly,5,Thu Jun 4 16:10:40 2015 UTC,I think they hit the right balance (except for that one obvious moment). The color work doesn't bother me because it was so well done. I can't remember any of those annoying moments where color grading makes blacks stand out as separate fields of grey or blue. Even in the night treated shots.  Stuff like the storm and the canyon being cg isn't a detraction for me as it adds geographical structure and variation to what was essentially a featureless desert.  I think in general why the film is refreshing is because they didn't cg elements like characters or vehicles unless they had no choice so you get that weight and lighting that makes it more realistic. Most of the war boys falling or exploding were rag dolls rather than cg.
MadMax,38j8ft,teaqualizer,3,Thu Jun 4 17:27:28 2015 UTC,Yeah a great balance was struck. Theres a behind the scenes vid on youtube that gives much insight
MadMax,38j8ft,wheelsun131,3,Thu Jun 4 17:39:04 2015 UTC,"they didn't cg elements like characters or vehicles unless they had no choice   Just listen to how often the guys speaking in this presentation speak about Miller talking about fixing stuff in post-production:  https://vimeo.com/127381179  Miller doesn't really seem that hesitant to use cg.  One of the guys talks about one example where Miller wanted an actor to get their arm to be in a very specific position and after trying a couple times to get them to position in it in the way he wanted, he apparently said that he would see that it would it get changed in post-production."
MadMax,38j8ft,teaqualizer,2,Fri Jun 5 08:22:20 2015 UTC,That pretty much sums up what I already said.
MadMax,38j8ft,VforVickers,6,Fri Jun 5 12:48:26 2015 UTC,"All the vehicle stuff was real apart from a few ""flying"" vehicles in the storm. The Doof Wagon crash seemed real but the flying elements (like the wheel, guitar etc.) were obviously inserted into the shot. I agree that the obvious made-for-3D shot was annoying.  The storm was the biggest CG scene, obviously, apart from a few vehicles and the cast.  But aside from that annoying 3D shot, the film struck the right balance with CGI and practical effects. The most important stuff was practical. Things like skies were sometimes edited for continuity and to make the visual flow more logical."
MadMax,38j8ft,nemothorx,3,Thu Jun 4 17:48:24 2015 UTC,"The annoying 3D shot was also filmed as an actual practical effect though. I think it just seems overly CGI because it's annoying, rather than vice versa."
MadMax,38j8ft,VforVickers,1 point,Fri Jun 5 09:43:39 2015 UTC,I know that it was approached with a stop-motion animation technique and then inserted into that shot. It definitely didn't take place at the same time as the background shot. It does look out of place visually when compared to the rest of the film.
MadMax,38j8ft,nemothorx,1 point,Fri Jun 5 10:00:42 2015 UTC,"I agree it definitely jarred when I saw it in 2D first time around - it felt terribly out of place. But my second viewing was in 3D and it seemed to suit. I don't know if that was because it was 3D as intended, or that I knew it was coming, or something else about the experience entirely. Overall, I'm still on the fence about it.  I wont be surprised if it gains notoriety in the long run as the one scene that most fans dislike.   [edit: ""It definitely didn't take place at the same time as the background shot."" ...this, whilst true, is also true of most of the rest of the movie, so isn't really notable except insofar as it was less successful this one time]"
MadMax,38j8ft,VforVickers,3,Fri Jun 5 11:55:06 2015 UTC,"I am aware of other shots that were composited together. For instance, the explosion with Max on a pole and vehicles on either side. Those were 3 seperate shots.  But I do feel that the made-for-3D shot felt a little out of place and gimmicky.  However, it didn't affect my overall enjoyment of the film. It was just a slight distraction."

MadMax,38j8ft,nemothorx,7,Thu Jun 4 18:34:35 2015 UTC,Most of the car crashes were real. They did as much practical effects as humanly possible. It's mostly the things that are impossible to achieve like the sandstorm and the citadel that are CGI. But they also composited certain scenes.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9kK-CbqH0k  http://www.fxguide.com/featured/a-graphic-tale-the-visual-effects-of-mad-max-fury-road/
MadMax,38j8ft,nemothorx,4,Thu Jun 4 20:45:45 2015 UTC,"The cars were real. The environment was significantly enhanced though. The obvious 3D shot was actually done for real via stop motion, but I agree with it looking annoying and the most fake (in 2D anyway, I thought it was fine in 3D actually) in the whole movie."
MadMax,38j8ft,Snake-Oil,0,Thu Jun 4 22:30:24 2015 UTC,Just watched a behind the scenes vid and the guitar was actually real...they swung if towards a camera with ropes in fromt of a green screen
MadMax,38j8ft,nemothorx,3,Fri Jun 5 12:53:04 2015 UTC,"I should have been clearer - the guitar, yes. The steering wheel that follows it:   In the end, George wanted to push right into the mouth of the wheel, but the resolution wasn’t enough, so we tracked the action of the spinning wheel on the gimbal and I built a little rig to photograph that with a high res stills camera. So we matched the motion of the spinning one and did a really high res version - like stop motion.    — from the fxguide article that has been linked to multiple times in this thread already :)"

MadMax,38fhb7,IdiotsLantern,12,Wed Jun 3 21:33:28 2015 UTC,"I think in this movie The War Rig takes the place of his Interceptor, and as the central vehicle of the story.  I was thinking toward the end of the movie that The War Rig has a lot of character to it. It's almost like a train engine or locomotive really, especially with that front plow on it and the long hood and long cab.  It becomes a sanctuary of sorts, and a life boat. It's the protector and conveyor for all the heroes in this movie.   The way they perform repairs on it without stopping reminded me of a train or ship movie: most the story takes place on it and it seems unstoppable. It makes it more of a shame when it get destroyed. Rictus pulling the blower off was like ripping its heart out."
MadMax,38fhb7,LostSoulsAlliance,17,Thu Jun 4 01:14:26 2015 UTC,"Fury Road wasn't an action fairytale where Max gets his car back and reigns supreme on the roads.   I loved the car, but it's not some God on the road like some suggest. It's not full of gadgets like some 007 rubbish. It's just a car and was on it's last legs at the start of the movie already.   I think Miller may have recognised the fandom around the car, and deliberately downplayed it so that the focus of the story was on the people :)"
MadMax,38fhb7,nemothorx,6,Wed Jun 3 22:36:53 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying I really missed it in Fury Road. I'd just like to get to see it be badass in at least ONE scene...if just so I'll care more when it inevitably gets blown up again....and again...and again. :P   Really, I'd like to see how good it really is, if just so I know more about why Max is so attached to his car. In two out of three Mel Gibson Mad Max Films, Max is more motivated by his stuff and his quest to be reunited with his stuff then by any of the people around him."
MadMax,38fhb7,nemothorx,9,Wed Jun 3 22:53:00 2015 UTC,"I agree it'd be nice to see more of it. But I don't need to know why Max is so invested to it. It's he last thing he has from before his wife dies. It's the last tie back to his life as a cop.   But it's also the very tool that he uses to enact revenge at the end of MM. For him to move past that and regain his humanity, it makes sense that he has to let go of the car.  And now that I've thought about it in those terms, I'd love to see the next movie reunite (it doesn't have to be explained) Max and the Interceptor, show them being badass, but then along the way, Max voluntarily hands it over to someone to who needs it more (via whatever plot contrivance), thus showing his own growth and allowing the car to be more than Max's weapon of choice, but just get back to being an awesome car again."
MadMax,38fhb7,herrsteely,3,Wed Jun 3 22:59:58 2015 UTC,"I think the fans love the car more than max. I know I do!.  He only used it in MM to get revenge on the biker gang. He loved the car when he had Jess and sprog, or at least what the mechanic did to it. It was used to get him to stay in the MFP. But In TRW he'd ripped it apart.  No carpets. No removed the seats. Dumped the boot/trunk lid to fit in the extra tanks. I think he also added larger rear wheels as I'm sure the original had standard wheels.  He also smashed the front end in ramming the car in the opening scene. And it was rigged to blow if anyone touched the tanks.  I think he just saw it as a means to an end. Personally I think after he lost his wife and child he couldn't get emotionally attached to anything else. He was surviving, that's it.  He was offered a new life by papagallo and he turned it down to stay alone in the wasteland.  In BTD the kids helped him to regain his humanity. He wanted to leave with them but sacrificed it to save the kids.   I think the fury road max is more like TRW max than BTD or MM max, quiet, cold, just looking out for himself at the start.  Even in MM I think he had a little doubt in his mind about killing johnny the boy. That's why he gave him the hacksaw.   Or it could just be a way of torturing him and giving him false hope. It's just a theory anyway :)"
MadMax,38fhb7,Turbofurball,1 point,Thu Jun 4 00:05:03 2015 UTC,"The end of MM is definitely torture for Johnny Boy, he might need 5 minutes with the hacksaw, but he gets about 2."

It's a shame he didn't make it.  Although if you can get hold of an uncut version there's a scene where the biker gang attack the halls of justice and kill fifi (the police chief) roop,  Charlie and charlies partner (can't remember his name). Which is pretty sad.  There's also a scene where goose drives the interceptor and max rides goose bike and they race. And a scene where max saws off the shotgun barrel.  Only saw it once many years ago.  Not sure where it came from but it was a dodgy pirate copy."

Nothing lasts forever, the car has had some great moments, and we can see them any time we want.

The car doesnt get destroyed - the driver is shot and the car veers off into the desert. its still out theer waiting for Max to reclaim it.."
MadMax,38fhb7,nemothorx,5,Thu Jun 4 04:35:35 2015 UTC,"no, another warboy claims it, and it gets crushed between the war rig and the people eater's refinery (whilst Max is dangling upside down out the window, if memory serves)"
MadMax,38fhb7,Carpe_DMT,3,Thu Jun 4 07:31:55 2015 UTC,"yes, came here to say this. when max was dangling over it i thought he'd get shoved out onto the hood and drive it himself, the way he took over the gas town barons car. instead,  that interceptor was destroyed in the most painful and powerfully cathartic way possible. watching it get.smushed between those two rigs was a thing of beauty. a fitting end to the mad max mobile."
MadMax,38fhb7,Turbofurball,6,Fri Jun 5 07:27:08 2015 UTC,"Who is willing to bet that's where Max is headed right after Furiosa and the gang are safely ensconced in the Citadel?   After all, he's got to get to it before the scavengers do."
MadMax,38fhb7,teaqualizer,3,Thu Jun 4 05:46:32 2015 UTC,"On the bonnet of the Interceptor (which got its own name, though I can't remember it) was Slit, Nux's friend.  After the driver is shot Slit drives it where it gets crushed and set on fire.  Given the previous stories about Max, he might just get it back again for the next movie, though :-)"
MadMax,38fhb7,MisterDamek,2,Thu Jun 4 13:16:13 2015 UTC,If they do make a sequel that follows the same set of characters then Max would be emotionally invested enough to really make the interceptor shine.
MadMax,38fhb7,fatty_fatshits,3,Wed Jun 3 22:51:31 2015 UTC,"Well, it'd be a first for the series, since every Mad Max movie seems to take place in it's own continuity. The few things that carry over are things like Max's leg brace, which are more references then anything else.   BUT, George Miller's done sequels before. He did one for Babe and he did one for Happy Feet, so he might do one for this film. Who knows. We'll have to see.  One thing I'm not sold on is it being a prequel centered around Furiosa. I'd love to see more of her story, but seeing her in a setting without Max and with minimal (if any) Wives, Nux and the other War Boyz, and the Immortan... I just don't know.  Still, weirder things have happened."
MadMax,38fhb7,nemothorx,3,Thu Jun 4 00:06:43 2015 UTC,"It'd be interesting to see one of her previous escape attempts. It'd be interesting to see some of her life in the Green Place before being taken. Or maybe there's a story of how she won respect and the role of Imperator, perhaps involving serving Joe in dealings with Gas Town & the Bullet Farm... Lots of possibilities there."
MadMax,38fhb7,fatty_fatshits,4,Thu Jun 4 02:40:00 2015 UTC,"The Interceptor's (and Max's origin) story was basically self-contained in Mad Max 1. In MM 2, they gave the car a send-off as it wouldn't be super useful to the story any longer. But at the same time its destruction had meaning. It's an unforgiving world this Wasteland, and no matter how strong of a survivor you are, you're vulnerable.  Thunderdome gave us a nod and tease that it may re-appear by showing it being salvaged and restored.  We got another sample in Fury Road, but similarly to Road Warrior, the Interceptor could serve no great purpose other than shameless fan service- and it still made an appearance before getting destroyed (again!- it's kinda a joke at this point).  However, I do think we will see the Interceptor again, and perhaps, maybe even perhaps, we'll get a story-motivated glimpse of the last of the V-8's in action with our mighty driver behind the wheel.   TLDR: But at this point the Interceptor may be conceptually what cinematic blue-balls look like."
MadMax,38fhb7,nemothorx,1 point,Thu Jun 4 03:08:55 2015 UTC,Thunderdome gave us a nod and tease that it may re-appear by showing it being salvaged and restored.   I'm positive it makes no appearance in Thunderdome in any form at all. Which car are you thinking of?
MadMax,38fhb7,Gnarbage,2,Thu Jun 4 07:33:43 2015 UTC,"From the imdb trivia page:    It is a popular misbelief that the vehicle Max is seen driving at the beginning and end of the film is based on a Ford F150 pick-up truck. However a modified early to mid 70's model Australian Ford Fairlane ZF-ZG was used as the base vehicle. Although the exterior of the car has been heavily modified, the vehicle is identified through the remaining pieces of the cars interior. These include a curved dashboard and ignition switch along with steering column positioning (common style of Australian Ford model's between the years 1971 to 1976,) Along with the a ZG seat trim and steering wheel. This can be confirmed through close-ups of the interior during the final chase sequence. The ZG Fairlane shares a very similar body style, chassis and engine (351, 5.8 liter V8 Cleveland) to Max's original yellow Interceptor used in ""Mad Max."" Making all three of the main vehicles used by Max in each film a similar variation of each other (Australian Model Ford V8, mid 70's Sedan,Coupe).    I don't know if this is confirmation or not, though.   I always was under the impression the V8 was being worked on and restored in the background in the Pig Farm. Wasn't it the same vehicle Max disarmed at the Pig Farm?   I personally like this theory as it may help explain why Max has his car in Fury Road, before it gets smashed again...and again."
MadMax,38fhb7,Esco91,2,Thu Jun 4 12:33:19 2015 UTC,"yeah, I've seen that IMDB trivia, and haven't ever seen anything resembling evidence for it. I take it's trivia with many a grain of salt.   This, otoh, looks more compelling, as it provides some photos, and run by someone presumably more dedicated to MM minutiae and trivia than IMDB folks.   http://www.madmaxmovies.com/mad-max-beyond-thunderdome/cars-and-vehicles/max-buggy/index.html  Of course, nothing to say that it's not an F-series chassis and suspension, with a Falcon/Fairlane body/interior. In which case, is it a falcon with a new chassis and suspension, or is it a truck with a new body? Either way, it's Max's car at the start (when he is plane-jacked), then he disarms it in Bartertown and it gets repairs to drive - becoming Masterblaster's vehicle of choice (Max demanding his vehicle back is how he starts the fight with Blaster). Then it's in the final chase and drive by Max in the final scenes to clear space. It's a vehicle with a completely different suspension setup than any version of the Interceptor so far, so I have a tough time believing one could be derived from the other.   Continuity? I don't think any explanation is needed beyond ""all movies are just different tellings of the 'myth of Mad Max'"" :)  [edit: this page goes a step further and calls it out explicitely as an F-150 with parts of an XB body on it.  http://madmax.wikia.com/wiki/The_Camel_Wagon http://madmax.wikia.com/wiki/V8_Interceptor  standard ""it's a wiki, take all opinions with a grain of salt"" disclaimer applies :)"

MadMax,38dr12,dmasterdyne,11,Wed Jun 3 20:27:34 2015 UTC,"I think Joe is a complex character for a number of reasons. I think the reason why some say that he isn't all that bad is because a number of the things he did made sense for the society they lived in at the time. He set up an ordered society, he grew crops, he provided blood bags to keep his War Boys alive as long as possible so that they could be of benefit to his society as long as possible. A lot of this does make sense but the way he went about it is morally reprehensible and inherently destructive. I think what he felt he was doing was restoring a semblance of order to a world on fire and that he felt that sacrifices to had to be made. Don't get me wrong, I think what he created was wrong but I don't necessarily feel that what we see of the Citadel was what he intended to create in the beginning. Of course he intended to be on top no matter what, but the fanatical worship and domination that followed he couldn't have predicted.   My reading of his character, based off what little we know of it, is that he wasn't a great person by any means before he ruled the Citadel but that it was him becoming the Immortan that truly made him a degree of evil.  I feel like before, when he was just the leader of a gang with a nickname, he felt that since he was the person trying to restore ""order"" he deserved to have the most water, the most food, and the prettiest women. I think that what truly drove him over the edge and made him irredeemable was that he went from thinking that he deserved the best because he was the leader to thinking he deserved the best because he was the Immortan. That at first he probably embraced the Immortan mythology just as a way to control his people but eventually he actually started to believe his own propaganda; he started to believe that he was a god and a savior. Probably from then on in he began to believe that what was best for him was best for society; in my opinion think is what really caused him to rule the Citadel so harshly.   In the end however, I think that what really makes Joe so irredeemable isn't his self serving view of the world but rather the fact that he probably knew full well what he was doing was wrong. I can't really blame the War Boys for sharing Joe's view on the world, that people (and women) can be objects, because they literally don't know anything else. The belief is still wrong, but they've been raised that way and its all they know. While we've never had an official timeline established for the time of the Fall the comics say that Joe was a veteran of the Oil Wars, which means that he was born and raised in civilization. Because of this he would have known full well that his actions and treatment of people would be abhorrent to our civilization, he just doesn't care.  Thats my reading of his character and motivations anyways.    I agree that the people who rush to defend him don't really know what they are defending but I feel a distinction should be made between those people and the people like me who just really like his character. I mean seriously, Hugh Keays-Byrne should get an award for his work in MM:FR. I don't think anyone since Anthony Hopkins in ""The Silence of the Lambs"" has managed to create such a compelling villain with so few lines.   (edit: spelling, formatting, forgot a part)"
MadMax,38dr12,dmasterdyne,3,Thu Jun 4 00:24:55 2015 UTC,Thanks for all this!  Immortan Joe is a great fictional character.  A really evil villain is much more fun to watch than a garden-variety asshole.  I just think it's weird that some people apparently really think IJ was a good guy.

MadMax,38dr12,bbooth76,3,Thu Jun 4 01:28:08 2015 UTC,"I think some people are just attracted to powerful men who seem to single-handedly keep the world spinning. Joe has basically put his face all over the Citadel. Everything there comes from him. It's like he'd have you believe that he carved those caves himself, he found the aquifer, he built the pumps that access it, he planted each and every plant in the gardens... And he's also a god who can grant you immortality in paradise. Why would anyone ever defy him? Without him, life would fall apart. Sure, he's harsh, sure he lets his people starve and his citadel is full of slaves, disease, and misery, but hey, it's better then what's waiting for you out in the wastes!! ... Isn't it?   ... At least that's why I figure people make excuses for Joe.

As far as Fury Road goes, Miller absolutely nails human behavior. From a neuroscience perspective, both Furiosa and Max as the lead protagonists, their ability to rise above the biological compulsion for self-survival with Furiosa accepting Max and Max accepting Furiosa as equals and allies, plays into the Campbell structure of the protagonist succeeding due to their willingness to adapt and grow, while the antagonist's failure comes from their refusal to change."

You say that we'd be looking for other options besides living around the Citadel.  So why did George Miller show us plenty of people around it then???  Are we shown other forms of political paradise in the Mad Max films?  No.  Society is breaking down in the first one, and has collapsed completely in the subsequent films.  Aunty Entity is quite harsh as well, and rules with an iron fist, has a slave workforce, and subjects people to torture and fights to the death.  At least Immortan Joe gives out free water once in a while!  Sure, some sort of democracy for the Citadel would be great, but I would imagine in a post-apocalyptic society, strong, violent rulers like Aunty Entity and Immortan Joe would be the norm."

MadMax,38dr12,Snake-Oil,4,Thu Jun 4 01:20:57 2015 UTC,Sounds like the same situation Lord Humongous was in and he's considered a bad guy.
MadMax,38dr12,Raidf28,2,Thu Jun 4 06:58:16 2015 UTC,"I never said what I thought about the Citadel itself either way.  It's pretty obvious that it had functional relationships with Gastown and the Bullet Farm, so it's doubtful there would have been violence over the water.  The film actually shows us alternatives to the Citadel as well, so there are some options.  And just because something is ""the norm"" doesn't mean people wouldn't be looking to change it or get away from it.  Duh."
MadMax,38dr12,Snake-Oil,3,Wed Jun 3 19:10:53 2015 UTC,"The film shows us, the observers, other alternatives. Look at the Wretched. They don't see any alternatives. The Vuvulini were at least a day east, through hostile territory and barren desert and that by vehicle. Gas Town was far enough and the journey hazardous enough to warrant the War Rig, plus escort cars and outriders and possibly a full squad of War Boys, maybe the same could be said for the Bullet Farm.  The Citadel was obviously trading with the other two settlements, using their most valuable commodities - Aquacola and Mothers' Milk. Even if the Wretched managed to survive the journey south to Gas Town or the Bullet Farm, would they accept diseased, dying and emaciated refugees?  Immortan Joe is definitely a bad guy, and I am not defending him, but to the Wretched, the Citadel provides the only chance of survival in the wasteland, water is given, however infrequently, food must trickle down from above and there's little, but some cover from the elements and from roaming marauders.  Plus the Citadel gives a perverse sense of hope to those living below. Just hope for something better, the hope that however brutal it is up there, it'll be better than down here."
MadMax,38dr12,Raidf28,2,Wed Jun 3 20:34:49 2015 UTC,"Huh?  It's not clear what you're even arguing here.  Anyway, the Wretched had NO problem tearing Joe to pieces and allying with Furiosa so clearly they were looking for options too.  A better person running the Citadel is an option."
MadMax,38dr12,channerflinn,1 point,Wed Jun 3 20:54:06 2015 UTC,"After he was dead. What alternatives are actually viable for say, the guy shown without legs?"
MadMax,38dr12,ThirstyOne,1 point,Thu Jun 4 07:06:49 2015 UTC,Why can't the Citadel take in the Wretched?  Why do they have to live just outside with only their little tarp things for shelter?  Why can't the water be made regularly available instead of drops at a time?  And so on.
MadMax,38dr12,seafooddisco,1 point,Thu Jun 4 11:20:28 2015 UTC,"I don't know. I'm not Immortan Joe or Corpus Colossus. I'm only going by my interpretation of what I saw.  Maybe the Citadel can only support a finite number of people with its resources, or maybe Joe was a complete bastard."
MadMax,38f3jh,urbanleprechaun,4,Wed Jun 3 20:10:42 2015 UTC,"I believe there was another shot with Tom Hardy in the foreground and the wives in the background. If either are found at a quality res, let me know. I've come up short searching for it!"

MadMax,38g0ns,skonen_blades,1 point,Thu Jun 4 05:46:24 2015 UTC,The great thing about it was is that I barely had to touch the main trailer with only bits and bobs cut in from other trailers. The beat of the song was a perfect match and the elated lyrics were a perfect juxtaposition with what was happening on the screen with the eventual overlapping of cross-referencing.
MadMax,38g0ns,docb30tn,2,Thu Jun 4 10:00:32 2015 UTC,WTF? Like the song. Like the movie. Together?Uhhhhh......Idk.

At least you probably noticed the jacket, which was nice to see! The sheer number of references to the previous films is one great reason to watch it over and over, haha."
MadMax,38hjn0,handull,4,Thu Jun 4 07:06:50 2015 UTC,"I believe he's wearing the brace for the entire movie actually. You can see it at the start when he kills the mutant lizard, again when he's attempting escape from the war boys after being tattooed, you can see it quite clearly when he's on the back of Nux's vehicle in the dust storm and again in the war rig when Furiosa stops to attempt her deal in the canyon. It's definitely more than one scene possibly the entire movie."

MadMax,38j6lx,jrockjesse,11,Thu Jun 4 15:59:20 2015 UTC,Max is in the movie.  There are lots of car chases and explosions.  You will enjoy it.
MadMax,38j6lx,skonen_blades,9,Thu Jun 4 16:07:15 2015 UTC,"Max get's plenty of screen time but I think it's undeniable that it ultimately isn't Max's story.  Even though Max probably has as much if not more screen time than Furiosa. He doesn't have much dialogue, while Furiosa is the one driving the story , has a clearer character arc. (Although I think Max's arc is still interesting), and in my opinion is more badass than Max.  But I don't think that the focus on Furiosa is a reason not to see the movie because Furiosa is fucking awesome."
MadMax,38j6lx,timothytia,2,Thu Jun 4 16:14:51 2015 UTC,"I think OP is either 12, or hasn't actually seen any previous Mad Max movie, while you're making good points I think they just went over his head :-/"

MadMax,38j6lx,uponthecityofzephon,6,Thu Jun 4 19:40:55 2015 UTC,Simple answer. No  Expanded answer. Go see it and try to appreciate what Max does do rather than what he doesn't do. He's a very active character and his contribution and character development increases as the film progresses.
MadMax,38j6lx,Derpatologist_7,-4,Thu Jun 4 16:07:46 2015 UTC,But does max actually kick anyones ass in the film lol

MadMax,38bvte,PipeOrganEnthusiast,26,Wed Jun 3 05:32:09 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure those weren't actual dead babies, just dolls. The women were essentially wetnurses. They might not have had kids for years, but as long as they kept being pumped, their bodies kept producing milk, even though they weren't pregnant."
MadMax,38bvte,uponthecityofzephon,11,Wed Jun 3 07:27:01 2015 UTC,Yeah I saw it twice and they sure looked like dolls.  Just there to give them comfort as they were milked.
MadMax,38bvte,skonen_blades,2,Wed Jun 3 08:08:14 2015 UTC,"I'll have to watch it again to be sure (I'll watch it again regardless, of course), but to me they certainly looked like small, mummified corpses instead of dolls. Some of them were dressed up as if they were alive, akin to how some animal and human mothers will keep caring for their dead children in a state of denial and trauma. I found this very gruesome, yet fitting. It really reinforces the ruling class's mindset of people as commodities and crops - in this case, human dairy cattle."
MadMax,38bvte,mdmrules,7,Wed Jun 3 13:22:43 2015 UTC,"I think they were just dirty old dolls, but would it even be a stretch if they were the  mummified remains of their dead babies?   Not at all. That's how fucking crazy this movie was."
MadMax,38bvte,teaqualizer,8,Wed Jun 3 21:48:31 2015 UTC,Initially I just figured that the piercings were a nice sight gag. You have a character who looks like a stuffy accountant and then you cut to the mid shot where you see the nipple piercings and he's comically affirmed as fitting into the world of Mad Max.  That one of them is an actual breast has interesting connotations. Having one of his breasts linking back to the other suggests that he is totally self serving and only out for himself.
MadMax,38bvte,Dr__Apocalypse,6,Wed Jun 3 11:46:05 2015 UTC,"This movie wasn't just a action flick, it was much deeper then that. Points like this are the reason it has resonated so well. Such a damn good movie."
MadMax,38bvte,AfraidOfTechnology,4,Wed Jun 3 18:30:15 2015 UTC,"As others have stated, I think the Milk Mothers are holding dolls. I thought they were dead babies at first, but in subsequent viewings they looked like dolls.  I don't think the People Eater has syphilis, in the Mad Max Art Book he is described as having ""Nose Leprosy,"" which may or may not be a thing? Maybe it's their term for Syphilis!  Also, I took the nipple piercings to be an indicator that he's just a kinky guy. He's as hedonistic as you can get in the Wasteland. Notice how he wears a catheter?  Here's a picture of concept art for the People Eater. You can see he's wearing high heals and what looks like a blouse? I wonder if he doesn't have some kind of gender issue that may have been toned down at the advise of Eve Ensler?"
MadMax,38bvte,jrizos,2,Wed Jun 3 22:20:27 2015 UTC,"Awesome observation. I made a video congratulating the movie for using little bits and pieces like that to establish exposition, rather than slow and deliberate development.

MadMax,38e1aq,Cropulis,2,Wed Jun 3 16:33:25 2015 UTC,Someone should expand this out to a full song!
MadMax,38bg24,ThirstyOne,35,Wed Jun 3 03:19:29 2015 UTC,"You have a point in that we can't judge him based on our society's standards, but I'd say we can judge by what he does, compared to what he can do.  He is a man of means. He has a fairly advanced social structure, water supply, he grows food rather than consuming a pre-apocalypse supply, and means to defend himself and his followers. He could absolutely be a true redeemer and build a lasting society.  But he doesn't, and this makes him a villain. Consider.  I would not call him a man of vision. He has built an empire, but solely to serve him. He keeps the wives so that he, specifically him and him alone, can have a legacy, and no one else. If all he cared about was a healthy human race, he has plenty of healthy men that could succeed him, but he has them hooked up as bloodbags instead. He doesn't care that the leader after him is a good one, only that it is his son.  He does nothing to better his followers. Dumping water on them is insanely wasteful but a spectacle. Having his warboys equally distribute water would lose the god-appeal. I imagine the only reason he tolerates them is to have a healthy supply of future warboys.  He doesn't conduct trade with Gas Town and the Bullet Farm, the three are a triumvirate that mutually support each other to ensure their continued dominance. It's not a trade society when the leader literally controls 100% of trade goods.  He has built a war cult around him that states that the only good death is a violent one. This ensures that the Citadel must remain in constant warfare against drifters and anyone they can find to satisfy his warboys. If he were to stop capturing and enslaving everyone they came across, it would lead to massive instability among his warboys. His culture has no emphasis on stability and fair governance, only expansion and conquest.  In short, his society is like every dictators, and it only functions while he is in charge, and there are no institutions in place to take over if he dies.  It is the apocalypse, but compare him to someone like Pappagallo. Pappagallo was a leader like Joe, but he clearly cared for the community before himself, and was willing to take personal risk for the good of others, rather than Joe makes others take risks for him. While Pappagallo is the leader, he listens to others, and others are capable of arguing against him without it being declared treason.  Most importantly, Pappagallo had an actual vision, an escape to the north, that actually benefitted everyone. Joe's vision is just keeping everything the same forever while his son takes over.  TLDR: Joe's a shortsided dictator with no vision, and fails when compared to a real leader like Pappagallo"
MadMax,38bg24,uponthecityofzephon,16,Wed Jun 3 05:17:57 2015 UTC,"That's a great, thorough, reply :-)  I'm pretty surprised by the number of Immortan apologists on here in the last week ... its an easy argument to poke holes in."
MadMax,38bg24,Turbofurball,-2,Wed Jun 3 08:42:35 2015 UTC,"Good points, well argued. Some of the greatest empires on earth were, and some still are, based on conquest and expansion though."
MadMax,38bg24,uponthecityofzephon,5,Wed Jun 3 13:42:07 2015 UTC,"maybe, but if they lasted, it was because they had an efficient and sophisticated bureaucracy to back them up and stabilize them. Compare ancient Rome with all its taxes and laws and regulations to Alexander the Great's empire falling apart after his death. Joe is definitely closer to Alexander."
MadMax,38bg24,MisterDamek,0,Wed Jun 3 15:30:40 2015 UTC,"Good points, but I disagree in regards to comparing Joe to Alexander. Alexander's empire fell apart because of rapid expansion that didn't allow for establishing a tradition of greek rule, or the bureaucracy as you correctly put, and because he didn't have a clearly defined heir, something that Immortan Joe is desperately trying to establish.   I don't see evidence of Joe's empire being aggressively expansionist in the movie. Rather, he has access to several resources and guards them jealously. Perhaps his goals were expansionist in the days of his earlier rule, as evidenced by Furiosa being kidnapped along with her mother and likely others as a child, but in the movie itself there is no expansionism but rather a stable territory he controls. Consider this, if his empire really were to fall apart upon his death, why would Furiosa decide to return to it? Surely the turmoil of warring factions of warlords ,and the risk of re-enslavement or death wouldn't be preferable to freedom the salt-flats, would it?"
MadMax,38bg24,withinreason,1 point,Wed Jun 3 15:50:57 2015 UTC,Are they great? Who says they're great? Who says empire is good? Usually just empires.
MadMax,38bg24,uponthecityofzephon,0,Thu Jun 4 04:11:18 2015 UTC,"You're ideals of him as a leader only work in a vacuum in my opinion. A monarchy of succession provides stability, and I would argue a wasteland society needs stability far more than kindness. If someone more worthy were to be placed as his successor you'd have succession wars and anarchy in a hurry. Showing weakness might invite conquest by their powerful neighbors. As shitty as it is, people are just trying to survive, whether by intention or accident, the type of ruler Joe is is probably best for the situation."
MadMax,38bg24,fatty_fatshits,3,Thu Jun 4 01:23:01 2015 UTC,"again, joe's goal is not the betterment of his society. It is the betterment of himself, which is attained by having a powerful society.  A cursory glance at history will show that a monarchy does nothing but invite succession wars and anarchy. You have family members vying for position, legitimacy of children called into question, and outright murder and usurping. I'm not saying this last thing wouldn't happen in another form of government, but it's guaranteed in a monarchy.  Pappagallo isn't weak, and he doesn't show weakness. He outright defies the Lord Humungous and his vast army, but more than that, he creates a sense of loyalty and strength. His men will keep fighting even without him physically being there, or being alive. This is far more stable and strong than a warlord leading a horde.  Both Lord Humungous and Pappagallo die, but consider what happens to their leaders. When Humungous dies, his vermin disperse, and all that he worked for is gone with his death. When Pappagallo dies, his people, united by camaraderie and unity, stay together and accomplish their goals, and the Gyro captain naturally arises as a new leader, who grows them into the ""Great Northern Tribe"". Who's society is stronger?"
MadMax,38bg24,fatty_fatshits,42,Thu Jun 4 03:28:06 2015 UTC,"If Immortan Joe cared about the future of the human race he wouldn't have lent himself as the male donor. His skin was heavily mottled from the radiation poisoning. He kept women as literally property/objects. He gutted that one girl for the baby* (/u/IDGAF1203 is right and as /u/ThirstyOne pointed out, this is a bad example, it wasn't barbaric, it was medical.)  There's also the fact he manipulated masses with religion not for their benefit, but for his own. The lives of the community below were only maintained enough so that they survive to continue to serve as a well to draw from (wives, warboys, blood, milk, other fluids, etc).   Yes, the community Joe provided was probably a bit better than surviving in the Wasteland, but part of the reason surviving in the Wasteland is so undesirable is based on the conditions Joe has helped to create. And this is by design, by not giving the people much alternative, profits are maximized because overhead is kept to a bare minimum.  However, you may note his apparent loyalty to family, even disfigured, his sons have lofty positions. They weren't immediately killed as babies for their deformities so there's that...  I like your theories though."
MadMax,38bg24,fatty_fatshits,9,Wed Jun 3 04:47:59 2015 UTC,"Well argued. In regards to gutting the girl though, she was already dying as indicated by the doctor ""Your girl is breathing her last here boss"". If there was no hope to save her then trying to save the child would be the next logical step.  Edit: To add to that, Immortan joe, AKA Colonel Joe Moore was around from pre-war times, so perhaps his genetic make-up was not affected by the radiation. As one of the other commentators on this thread pointed out, he was able to produce a healthy offspring."
MadMax,38bg24,IDGAF1203,6,Wed Jun 3 13:47:14 2015 UTC,"Absolutely, I'll probably asterisk that line. /u/IDGAF1203 basically pointed out it wasn't so much ""gutting"" as it was a c-section.   That's an interesting point that the Immortan is okay genetically. One idea I had though was how it may've been possible his wives were also his daughters. I only saw the movie once (a sin, I know), but I don't remember them saying what happened to the daughters (unless we're to infer they are killed or cast out.)  I just have this sneaking suspicion that in a world of widespread cannibalism, incest is an excusable act. And as far as producing a viable offspring, it's almost either 1. a King's act of defiant evolution in the face of a wretched place and basically mother nature or 2. Joe's gonna keep pumping his seed until he hits 777s regardless of his genetic or incestual problems.  To concede and by the looks of it, even becoming pregnant seems very difficult.  The counter to the incest idea is that yes, Immortan cared about having the healthiest possible offspring which is why he never picked any two women who looked alike. But I also imagine pristine women were a rarity and these women seemed fairly healthy looking, I would guess the problem lied with Joe (he probably picked the healthiest after all). There also seem to be those immune to the radiation, namely people like Furiosa (unless she's barren for whatever reason) and Max. They seem like good candidates to continue the human race over a guy that looks and sounds like a monster.  TLDR: Incest/Controlling mother nature theory- It's possible to produce a viable offspring even with incest. So Joe may've been doing a little of that. Works on a story level as a King who is attempting to defy mother nature and establish himself as the ultimate power (but he's a false idol who gets his face ripped off by the protector of the wives for all his trouble).  EDIT: Oh shit, I just thought of this (as I'm sure many others have already), Immortan Joe runs the breeding program and sterilizes all those who he deems unfit, but this is mostly to weed out the competition, so no one other than he sires the next King of the Wasteland. Nux hadn't even touched a girl until he left Joe. To cover his bases he may sterilize many women as well, including Furiosa- the brand on the back of her neck signifies she was ""processed."""
MadMax,38bg24,LastStar007,3,Wed Jun 3 14:15:01 2015 UTC,"It's an interesting theory, but none of the incest or sterilization theories have supportive evidence in the movie. I expect that the brand is more to mark his 'property' than anything. It's also highly likely that the radiation itself would sterilize people, reducing the need to perform complicated medical procedures that might result in infection and death. The brides never refer to him as a father or forebear and their genetic variance would seem to indicate that they aren't part of his line."
MadMax,38bg24,MisterDamek,2,Wed Jun 3 15:05:28 2015 UTC,Agreed.
MadMax,38bg24,TWK128,8,Wed Jun 3 15:08:35 2015 UTC,"He gutted that one girl for the baby.   To be fair, many call that a c-section, and its been going on since Roman times."
MadMax,38bg24,leonryan,16,Wed Jun 3 12:37:12 2015 UTC,"You raise good points, but I still think he's a villain. Most of his rule comes from lifting himself up above his subjects as a kind of superhuman, and degrading some of his subjects (wives and wretched) as sub-human. It's basically the same idea as North Korea and slavery of Africans, a comparison enhanced by how those in power have far more resources than they can consume themselves, but refuse to share so that they can maintain their iron rule.  Also, Joe only provides medical care for the War Boys and the less expendable human resources (breeders, milk makers, etc.).  Perhaps the most damning evidence is that the water he provides at the beginning of the movie is not even close to enough for the masses. It's not explicitly shown, but death is rampant among those not fortunate enough to catch his eye. He just doesn't care about any of them."
MadMax,38bg24,leonryan,14,Wed Jun 3 04:49:27 2015 UTC,"He believes owning human beings and using them as means to an end is A-OK. That makes him a villain.

In other words, ""who killed the world?"""

MadMax,38bg24,TWK128,24,Thu Jun 4 03:25:20 2015 UTC,"you have to be kidding right?   he didn't establish a safe haven, he took it from others who were already holding it by sneaking in and killing them. he withholds water from people who need it to maintain his power over them. he grows food for himself but there's no indication he does so for anyone else, and those cranes are simply to lift his vehicles up so he can jealously guard them. he provides medical maintenance for those who serve him like you'd maintain your weapons or farm animals, only so they'll be able to effectively serve his needs. he enslaves desperate children. he deludes his people so they'll feel he's a benevolent leader and won't rise up against him. he established a way to exploit the one resource he has to attain other resources, and in doing so denies all three resources to the people who inhabit the land surrounding the citadel.   did you not notice the unanimous cheer when they dumped his fat corpse off the gigahorse?  Furiosa never said anything about revenge.  Had Max not encouraged her to return to the citadel she would've ridden into the sunset never to see him again.  Her motivation was to save the wives because during her rise to Imperator she did things in the service of Joe that she's not proud of and now she wants to redeem herself for them."
MadMax,38bg24,ILiveIDieILiveAgain,-1,Wed Jun 3 05:52:04 2015 UTC,"Where in the movie was it established the Joe snuck in and killed the previous occupants of the citadel? Even if he did, who's to say they were morally considered 'good' by virtue of having been there previously or that they hadn't done so themselves to the previous occupants? For all we know the citadel was previously occupied by cannibals who ritually murdered people every day for entertainment, and Joe's rule, brutal as it is, was a welcome reprieve. To add to that, there are many cultures throughout history that have succeeded by invading other culture's territory. Take the Europeans who settles the North America vs. the native Americans, the Roman empire vs. the local tribes of Europe, the British empire vs. pretty much the rest of the world, the Muslim empire circa 8th to 13th century under the Abbassid Dynasty. Does history, and their genetic legacy, judge them by their success or by their morality? How would they judge themselves? He does withhold water, but perhaps not as greedily as you think. The human body generally cannot survive for more than 3 days without water, especially in such an arid condition, which means that for his followers, even at the lower rungs there has to be a steady supply, likely once a day and hopefully in not as wasteful a spectacle. Same as the water supply issue from above. People need to eat. For that many people to be down there they must be eating something. Unless it's each other, I suspect he's providing them with some form of sustenance or they'd all have either died or left. He does provide medical maintenance in a limited capacity, and only in a way which benefits him, but with medical attention as a limited resource, does he really have a choice? Given limited resources, do you spend them on that which makes your society stronger, or on those who don't? If you don't maintain the war-boys, but rather spread a limited resource thin to all your people, how does that impact the security of your territory? Those children are desperate for a reason. I don't see any walls or fences around the citadel, the children of the people who live around the citadel could have easily walked off into the night and chosen to die, freedom intact. Those taken from other tribes might be a different story though. Deluding the people is something politicians have done since the dawn of time. Many people suffer their leaders even knowing they are being deluded. How is Joe any different? Can you show me a modern society that is not based on resource control? If he had the power to harness and organize control of the resource does that not mean he therefore has the right to manage it? In a world that runs on survival, once you establish control of a resource do you then just give it away?   The crowd cheered equally loudly when Joe gave them water and when he sent out the supply run. The crowd would have likely cheered just as loud at his triumphant return.  In regards to Furiosa, in an interview with Charlize Theron she indicates that she believes Furiosa's motive to be revenge."

Does this make her fit to rule? Fit to try and restore humanity and the world?   Did we see the same movie? Furiosa was very compassionate, and a very good leader too. I didn't think it was anger or hate that led her: it was just the hopelessness of the situation. She missed her home so bad.   I kinda see your point. But.

Yeah.    what other options would be available to these woman out in the wastelands of post-apocalyptic Australia and how likely would they be to survive?   The Vulvalini are strong evidence the movie gives us of the capacity of women to survive in the wastelands. I think it's pretty condescending to suggest women would need to accept imprisonment and rape or they'll just go belly up, particularly when we're talking about a movie with Furiosa in it.  Also, judging what is needed to survive and what is morally right are very different concerns. I'm not sure why we would think that morality is relative to survival conditions. It might be that you need to do more bad things to survive, but they're still bad. Justifying Joe or anyone else's actions by saying ""but he needs to do it to survive"" is not a moral argument all by itself."
MadMax,38bg24,Qarlo,-2,Wed Jun 3 13:03:14 2015 UTC,"I think it's pretty condescending to suggest women would need to accept imprisonment and rape or they'll just go belly up   I suggested nothing of the sort. I merely pointed out that, as they're portrayed in the movie, the 'wives' did not really have any other skill sets nor experience of the wasteland. They aren't warriors like Furiosa or the Vulvalini, nor are they physicians, mechanics or even blind musicians like the coma-doof. I posed the question that given their freedom in such a harsh world, how would they survive? What options are available to them? A conflict which was portrayed by the one of the characters of the wives themselves when she tries to return.  As for morality being set in stone as opposed to changing with circumstances and knowledge; many a war have been fought, or at least presented as such to the people, over who had the moral high-ground. Some claim it by divinity through religious texts, while others claim it though popular support i.e 'we the people', but many of these doctrines differ on key points. This leaves me to conclude that popular morality is a function of the society which creates and perpetuates it, and not the other way around."
MadMax,38bg24,candleflame3,7,Wed Jun 3 12:40:27 2015 UTC,"how would they survive? What options are available to them?    Learn. It's what humans generally do when they have the chance and the need. Or die. Either way, rape is rape, and it doesn't get any morally better for happening in a gilded cage, or being carried out by the dude who's keeping you alive.   I'm not a moral relativist, so the fact that there's lots of disagreement about what is moral between different groups doesn't mean there's no fact of the matter about what's right or wrong to me. It means someone's making a mistake."

MadMax,38bg24,ArtimusGG,5,Wed Jun 3 15:38:43 2015 UTC,"/u/adventurefine is discussing rape though, and so am I.  Do you think rape is always wrong?"
MadMax,38bg24,ArtimusGG,-1,Wed Jun 3 15:42:27 2015 UTC,"On a personal level, yes. I do not condone rape. I find it to be 'wrong', if such an absolute term can be invoked without hubris. In fact, I find it to be one of the more heinous and deplorable crimes, right up there with murder. But I've arrived at this conclusion from a position of moral relativism based on how it affects the people around me, the society in which I function as an individual and the morals on which I was raised. Other people raised in different cultures might arrive at different conclusions and also consider themselves to be morally justifiable, hence why marital rape is still an issue in many societies in the 21st century.  I'll wager though, that if anyone looks far enough back into their genetic legacy there are likely conquerors and rapists in it. On a biological scale the survival of the species or the perpetuation of a particularly successful genetic trait is defined not necessarily by personal morals, but by who was the most prolific breeder and died the least before being able to breed. As a result, human history is rife with rape, murder and slavery. Evolution doesn't really care though, it just turns a crank and grinds us out."
MadMax,38bg24,TheCurseOfJamesDolan,5,Wed Jun 3 15:45:10 2015 UTC,So you don't think rape is always wrong.  You think it depends on the culture where the rape happens.  I'm guessing you aren't too bothered about how the rape victim feels about it.  Real nice.
MadMax,38bg24,Ekudar,0,Wed Jun 3 16:08:24 2015 UTC,"As I've indicated. I think people's perception of whether or not rape, or other crimes for that matter, are morally wrong is based on their upbringing, and there's plenty of cultures, both historically and today that demonstrated just that. I personally consider it morally wrong, but the difference in our perceptions is that, unlike you, I don't consider my moral decisions to be absolutely right in and of themselves, but rather a reflection of the morality of my society and the circumstance it faces. The crux of my argument being that no one is born with morals, morals are learned behavior.  As for your tacit accusation of me being a rapist in some capacity, or lacking in empathy for rape victims via a slippery slope fallacy, no doubt to justify your lack of capacity to effectively argue the merits of moral relativism or any of the other points I've brought up: All you're doing is trying to derail the argument into proving that I am somehow a rapist and therefore all my arguments are invalid. Real nice."
MadMax,38bg24,Ekudar,2,Wed Jun 3 16:18:45 2015 UTC,"how do you reconcile them with people who have opposing views that perceive your views as wrong and are capable of demonstrating that they are to their satisfaction?   We deal with all kinds of disagreements with other people where each of us is satisfied we are right - disagreements about science, religion, the arts, etc. In each case the mere fact that there is disagreement doesn't mean there is no fact of the matter about what is right (perhaps particularly obvious with science). I don't think there is a special problem here for moral disagreement. So yes, I think those who disagree with me about moral matters are wrong. That doesn't mean I ignore their views, it means I approach the discussion as something one of us can be right about, and that the correct view will be discovered through discussion, empathy, reasoning, all the tools we have for assessing moral truth.   The moral law and the legal law can come apart. Whether or not I chose to disobey the law on moral grounds would depend upon how morally heinous I took complying with the law to be.   Look, there are many different moral outlooks one can take. You could be a utilitarian who asks how to maximize happiness for the greatest number of people. Or, you could be a deontologist and think about what the moral law requires of you (such as Kant's idea that you should never treat other people merely as a means to your own ends, but always an end in themselves). Both of these are moral views that can be sensitive to cultural context (what makes people happy might differ, what people consider being used as a means might differ), but the basic moral principle at work, if you endorse it, doesn't change with context. It is always right to maximize happiness, or it is always right to treat others as ends in themselves.   This is just to say the choice is not between moral relativism and flagrant arrogance in the face of cultural differences."
MadMax,38bg24,autowikibot,1 point,Wed Jun 3 16:54:29 2015 UTC,"You make good points, and I agree that the choice between moral relativism and flagrant arrogance in the face of cultural differences is a false dichotomy.   However, it seems that your argument relies on the idea that there are moral absolutes, even if they are based on concepts that can be adapted to various cultures. In the same way that I don't accept complete moral relativism (I have some moral ideas that I too hold dear), I also cannot accept claims to complete moral axioms and a resulting moral authority - that is a claim that moral standards exist without the cultural and biological backing and conditions that created them. While it's true that more than enough people can agree on a few particular moral concepts, can these be considered axioms, or are they merely a construct based on cultural agreements or concession or indeed the 'human condition' itself? If you believe in evolution, where does the quest for the roots of moral axioms lead us as we tread down the hallways of our past? Is the 'human condition' different than the 'ape condition' or even the 'lower mammal condition'?  Let's consider your two examples: 'It is always right to maximize happiness', who's happiness? Maximized in what way? Is the happiness of the individual or certain groups of individuals more important than maximizing that of the masses? What if something that maximizes my happiness, say: having a new smartphone, reduce the happiness of others, such as the workers in a Chinese manufacturing plant? What if a fanatical group of believers would maximize their happiness, and presumably share that happiness with all mankind if everyone followed their religious beliefs? Unfortunately, in order for their happiness to be maximized, those who are unable to share in it must be killed.  In the case of 'it is always right to treat other's as ends in themselves'. To me that evokes the idea of cooperation being a survival mechanism in our past and that the overall success and survival of the tribe relies on the individual success of each member of the tribe. Difficult to reconcile when two tribes are competing for limited resources though, as that usually leads to violence. Killing the members of the other tribes or chasing them off a territory or resource does not treat them as an end in themselves, but rather as a means to an end. However, mankind and animals vie for territory constantly. While some people consider violence moral, other's consider it immoral, depending on that particular type of violence or whom the violence is inflicted upon. Some people, Janists for example, consider all violence immoral while Holy-warriors consider it justified. If both history and biology have taught us nothing else, it's that humans (and most other organisms on the planet) have an evolutionary re-enforced capacity for violence. Are we then evolved in an anti-moralistic way?  I guess my point is that I find it difficult to accept that morality existed as a physical law, and that we merely discovered it in the same way we discovered gravity. Rather, I'd wager instead that what we refer to as morality, later codified through law, is merely an attempt to rationalize survival oriented behavior based on the pressures facing us as individuals or as a society, and what's right for whomever wields the most power to enforce that behavior. Hence, each review and discussion of morals should take into consideration the conditions from which they arise."

He's actually working against the propagation of healthy human genes by polluting the wives with his irradiated filth. He's little more than a fat Warboy as far as genetic stock is concerned."
MadMax,38bg24,autowikiabot,3,Wed Jun 3 21:03:12 2015 UTC,"You can say many of those things about Hitler or Stalin. They took care of their followers and provided them with so many promises that people became blind to the atrocities that were being committed, or figured it was worth some sacrifice to have a better life. My issue with Immortan Joe was that he gave the healthiest women to himself, even called them his property. Finding the best and healthiest men and then encouraging them to have children to increase the likelihood of a healthier community is less sinister than keeping the women for himself. He even hid his health issues with that suit and had some of the War Boys blowing powder on his sores to treat him."
MadMax,38bg24,Xiphos462,-2,Thu Jun 4 03:30:07 2015 UTC,"Would him choosing healthy men for the purpose of procreating be any less rapey than him raping the wives himself though?   In regards to him having to select healthy specimens: By primitive biological definition him being the ruling warlord, in effect - the alpha male, entitles him to the right to breed."
MadMax,38bg24,LastStar007,2,Wed Jun 3 15:27:00 2015 UTC,"To your first point, yes it is less ""rapey."" In my post I mentioned encouraging them, not forcing them, to have children with healthy males and encouraging the males as well. Not forcing anyone. The motive behind that is to promote a healthy society by combining the best gene pools. To your second point, yes I believe that is more what Immortan actually did with Citadel. He was the warlord alpha male entitled to owning people, War Boys and his Wives, and being worshiped."
MadMax,38bg24,IDGAF1203,7,Wed Jun 3 15:40:24 2015 UTC,"Disgusting. Another Immortan Joe sympathizer.   even though he keeps them trapped against their will   Even if you are the leader, you don't get to keep slaves and keep people against their will. Providing a haven and protection doesn't allow you to run roughshod over society. That's what dictators do (and that's what Joe was).  The brides and Furiosa just wanted to leave and he sent three war parties after them.   Joe may keep them captive but their quarters are plush compared to the conditions of everyone else, nor is he depicted as being abusive towards them. In fact, he demands that they get not so much of a scratch on them from his followers.   This argument is flawed. He values passing on his legacy above all else not the wives. He values an heir. His current sons are flawed obviously. The girls are just a means to an end. ""An object"" to use their terms. He almost nearly reached his end, but his aggressiveness killed a wife and his ""perfect"" son. That's when you see what he really values.  If one of the wives couldn't accomplish Joe's goal, you have no way of knowing how that wife would be treated. She might go from a breeder to a milk mother real quick. Or worst.   He provides clean water for his people but reminds them that it is a scarce resource, and not to be squandered. A reflection of how fragile life can be in the wasteland.   He doesn't just ""provide"" water for his people and protect it. He owns it and uses it as leverage. He controls the water, so he's in charge. Control is another weapon in his arsenal.   Her dream of freedom for herself and the others ends up costing not only the life of one of the brides, but the lives of many others, and in the end her dream turns out to be nothing more than a shattered vision   First, her dream wouldn't have cost any lives if not for Immortan Joe. He's the one that didn't allow Furiosa and the wives to leave Citadel of their own accord. They had to leave by subterfuge. Subterfuge that Joe responded to with violence. You can argue that Furiosa put her immediate crew in danger (The ones that were accompanying her to Gas Town). However, every life lost was a result of actions by Joe.  Second, even if Furiosa's dream was incorrect, she (and the wives) should be allowed to seek out what they believe their best future is. Just because we learned Furiosa's goal was no longer viable, that doesn't automatically mean Immortan Joe's society is the next best option. The girls should have freedom to live where they want, how they want and with who they want. They should be forced into being Joe's sex slave because the options outside Citadel are bleak.  There might not be a better option. Things might be worst. But they should be allowed to seek out their own destiny.   Can we apply the moralistic judgement of an affluent pre-apocalypse society to that depicted in the film or does the new set of circumstances depicted in the movie's world require a different approach in the interest of the survival of humanity and civilization?   I think it's fair to say, in any society, that humans should be allowed freedom to make their own decisions. If Furiosa and the brides no longer feel safe/comfortable with Immortan Joe, they should at least have the option to leave.  In a post-Apocalypse world, needs and priorities may change, but tyranny does not. Life might not be any better outside the walls of Citadel, but they should be allowed to make that decision for themselves."

The character is beautifully written and the actor did an amazing job, but there is nothing redeemable about the character or his actions."
MadMax,38bg24,TWK128,1 point,Thu Jun 4 23:11:14 2015 UTC,"OK, I'll try to explain.  Tyranny by dominant males has been observed in many species, including our closest relatives - Chimpanzees and is presumably a survival mechanism, reenforced by millions of years of evolution. It has also been observed up until fairly recently in human history. Pyramidal structures of dominance such as thanes, kings, emperors, etc. were all fairly common and some still exist today. Some even go so far as to claim divine right (an appeal to God, the ultimate alpha figure). The concept of democracy and later on equality didn't officially emerge in writing until the days of ancient Greece and even then you only got to vote if you were a citizen (the slaves in Greece didn't get much of a say in anything).  On a biological scale the sudden appearance of ideas such as equality, and the presumed end of tyranny that should logically follow, don't make much sense as an evolutionary trait, as they counteract millions of years of evolution to the contrary. People still size each other up subconsciously and most social structures still have an alpha male or female in leadership positions. Rather than presuming that most people are born as what we consider 'good and fair' that is - with these traits ingrained, I'd wager that the rise of popular democratic rule and the equality it fosters is a learned behavior that's reinforced by teaching people to empathize with all members of society, not just yourself or your caste, as a means for cohesion of the larger 'super tribe', aka 'the rule of law'. That's why we send people to schools, that's also why we punish those who disobey the agreed upon laws, to keep the super-tribe functioning. The creation of this 'super tribe' and its application has more to do overall well being of the tribe and the tribes use of readily available means of enforcing majority rule (higher availability of information and weaponry) that can be affected by more people against tyrants. If the established government itself becomes tyrannical or is far enough out of alignment with what the people as a whole want, it then follows that the two forces of government and the people oppose each other, rather than peacefully coexisting, circa many a revolution. But even with all these mechanisms in place, when we form democratic nations we then use the powers of those nations to squabble for resources with other nations. So we've taken the individual or tribal evolutionary struggle for resources and merely superimposed a larger structure over it; The nation as a super organism if you will. Countries wage war on other countries and most people are happy enough to go along with it so long as they feel that their survival is at stake. Even so, I'm sure people would evoke a much different emotional state about going down the street and robbing their neighbors petrol station than they would shipping their sons and daughters off to some foreign country to 'defend freedom'.  I digress though.  You use words like Evil, Scumbag, and Crimes to Judge Joe by what I presume is your understanding of the concept of justice in the society in which you currently live. But examine his behavior purely from a survival perspective, unburdened by these social definitions: Joe doesn't care if he's 'Evil'. He's in charge and does what he wants. To him this is merely how he gets by and I'm sure he doesn't sit around pondering how evil he is as that's self-defeating. He just does what he does to stay on top. As for crimes, who's going to judge you when you're the ultimate source of moral authority and have the last say by virtue of your own power?   In a world previously full of democracies that had quite literally destroyed itself, Joe is very much an Alpha male. Formerly Colonel Joe Moore, veteran of the oil wars and hero of the water wars, he's literally seen so-called civilization tear itself apart as resources such as oil and then water dwindled. As a military man and through his own experience he has an understanding that force works. It may not be 'fair' or 'equal' or 'good' but it works and it affects survival of the fittest. Joe chooses to carve out his own dominion as so many others have before by being the fittest and he uses every resource at his disposal, including the lives of others, also as so many have done before him. As such, I don't really think the concepts of good or evil of a functioning democracy apply here. Only what's good for Joe and what's bad for Joe from his own survival perspective, and what's good and bad for everyone else from their own unique survival perspectives. In the wasteland it's not about who's right or wrong, but who's dead and who's alive and can keep on living. To quote a friend ""There are no weight classes in the jungle"", and their world has very much so turned into a jungle. Joe was just the biggest, meanest heavy weight around. All this isn't to say that I necessarily agree with his methods or motivations, simply that using terms like 'good' and 'evil' are imposing concepts of a judgement system from a world that no longer exists to them.  The women of the Vulvalanni are professed bandits, Max would have been happy to abandon the wives in the desert if that meant he could make an escape, Furiosa is motivated by vengeance. Are any of these characters automatically 'good' simply because they oppose Joe?  The purpose of posing the question was to stimulate debate about what concepts of 'good' and 'evil' would be like in the world depicted in the film and how those measure up to survival needs. Granted, this is based on my opinion that morals are learned behavior and are relative to the society which they reflect. But consider this: a moral code that gets you killed won't be around long enough to be perpetuated to the point of being considered a social norm, and therefore 'good'. If that is indeed the case, what then becomes morally righteous behavior?"

Frodo of article  Kasakela Chimpanzee Community:       Frodo (June 30, 1976 – November 10, 2013) was Fifi's second oldest son.  His father was the relatively low ranking male Sherry. Even from a young age, Frodo was large and aggressive. He learned to throw rocks as a juvenile, sometimes throwing them at and hitting and bruising his human observers.  As an adult, he was one of the largest chimpanzees ever observed in the community, at about 113 pounds (51 kg) and remained aggressive.   He also became an excellent hunter of red colobus monkeys, and was also able to intimidate other chimpanzees into sharing their kills with him if he was unsuccessful.   His large size and aggressive nature allowed him to attain high status while his brother Freud was alpha, and on October 2, 1997, while Freud and other community members were suffering from sarcoptic mange, Frodo defeated Freud and attained the alpha male position.

MadMax,38bg24,fire810,4,Fri Jun 5 00:50:54 2015 UTC,"Joe's actions are 50% survival / 50% ego.   He is a functional leader. Being able to create a more or less harmonious community in a world as brutal and ruthless as that is a great feat. It is easy to judge some of his actions as unnecessarily harsh such as spilling the water, leaving the commoners on the ground to fend for themselves, and creating a factory out of the mothers and children, but some people cannot grasp how difficult decisions are between two or more evils. There is not always an idealistic, non-violent, crowd-pleasing option. To understand, one would have to truly live in the mindset of that world or be faced with those choices themself. Showing too much compassion is seen as weakness which counteracts his ability to garnish devotion. His ruling style of devotion is a great balance between fear and respect, causing his warboys to willingly put their lives on the line, motivated more by disappointment in not pleasing him than by fear.  But Joe does let the power get to his head. It goes with the persona, so again it tough to judge, but his one-track mind of retrieving the brides and keeping them locked away for only himself are difficult to stand behind. There appears to be little to no tolerance for dissenting opinions, and the future plans rest solely in the hands of his ""royal"" family.  Overall, I would not call Joe evil at all. He is practical. It would be interesting to see what Furiosa changes. There are definite opportunities to expand farm lands and empower the poor, but will this paint a target on them for neighboring clans, and will she be able to maintain working relations for gas and weapons."

You bring up some good logical points as to why Joe should have just allowed Furiosa to return to the citadel - but I am certain Joe wasn't acting on logic at that stage. The notion that Furiosa had taken his wives from him, stolen his most prized possessions (resulting in the death of his favorite wife and precious unborn son), led him on a disastrous chase... and is now heading BACK to take over his prized citadel? I think possessive rage pretty much took over at that point."

MadMax,389dgm,dmasterdyne,9,Tue Jun 2 19:18:28 2015 UTC,"The reasons why I think it's not doing as well as one should expect:   It's the 4th Mad Max. Now, I wasn't even born when the 3rd movie came out, and for some reason I never really had interest to watch it or the ones before it. So when I saw Fury Road's trailer I thought ""Naww this is some remake of an 80's movie"". The only reason I went to see FR was basically Tom Hardy 'cause he rocks. So I think many of the... Krhm, kids, might not be very interested in FR if they see it as a sequel to some old-ass Mel Gibson movie.  It's rated R.  People are stupid and don't know what's good for them."
MadMax,389dgm,ILiveIDieILiveAgain,4,Tue Jun 2 21:01:39 2015 UTC,"Good points. I wasn't born for the first 3 either but I enjoy film in general so my knowledge of ""cult cinema"" is fairly up to snuff, the same way that I wasn't born during the 60s/70s but damn I love me some Zeppelin   Ninja edit- I was actually alive for Beyond Thunderdome, but I was probably still in diapers"
MadMax,389dgm,teaqualizer,6,Tue Jun 2 21:17:37 2015 UTC,I think read in one of the reviews a line about Miller taking the current generation of action directors and putting them over his knee to slap them silly and show them how action should be done. And while I as a fellow 30 something agree with this in principle you can't argue against the fact that FF7 had made over 1.5 billon so they must be doing something that appeals to the younger generation who I clearly am drifting further and further away from.   Tl;dr FF = Cabernet FR = Pinot
MadMax,389dgm,skonen_blades,3,Tue Jun 2 20:23:35 2015 UTC,"I agree with you. It helps for me to remember that people don't watch film the same reasons, some just want to turn off their mind and be entertained for 90 minutes, which is fine, and if a film can do that, then it was successful at some level. I took a few film classes during undergrad, and i am so glad i did because it helps me to get so much more out of film, and it's now one of my favorite hobbies. Don't confuse having an introspective, curious mind that likes to be stimulated with ""drifting further away from people"". I've felt different from most people most of my adult life. No matter how old we get, the number of assholes and idiots will remain pretty consistent."

MadMax,38bdf5,TWK128,4,Wed Jun 3 05:33:27 2015 UTC,Any serious Post-Apocalyptic fans know Mad Max was heavy inspiration for many of the early post-apoc games.  One example is a game called Wasteland which inspired the Fallout games. In fact the leather armor from all of the Fallout games is directly modeled after Max's armor in Mad Max.

MadMax,38bdf5,SirLuciousL,0,Thu Jun 4 07:03:23 2015 UTC,"I'm a bitter old-school Fallout zealot. Played 1 and 2, even Tactics. I was there before PoS and the cancelled Van Buren. Chris Avellone is one of my saints. NMA is still my site of choice.   Bethesda stripped away so much of what made Fallout Fallout. When you take away that harshness, that unforgiving practical world, you're making something else, but not Fallout.   Fallout meant practical choices free of false dramatic pomp from arrogant, self-righteous writers. (You must sacrifice yourself? Even though you've got a ghoul squadmate? And then, you give players shit for picking the option where no one has to die?)  Fallout meant the freedom to use a powered Mega Power-Fist to punch something in the crotch until it died.   You could even kill children, but you'd have to face the consequences for it.  Fallout meant a world past traditional morality, where survival came first. Because of this, nobility and goodness was hard to find, and usually didn't take the traditional forms.   We see this with the NCR, the Brotherhood, and Caesar's Legion in New Vegas. There are no clean-cut ""good guys"" and ""bad guys."" All three have their own interests, and there are individuals within each group that are admirable or despicable.   From what I've heard about 3, and now 4, Bethesda puts too much of the old world into this wasteland. And it just doesn't fit.   It's not their sandbox and the way they run it is very, very different from the people that used to run it.  Which is why New Vegas is my Fallout 3. It's the closest we've come to the Fallout 3 that was supposed to be. That was actually in production before Interplay shut down.  Want to know what the former lead on Interplay's FO3 has been up to? He just helped design a game called Pillars of Eternity.   There's a lineage behind Fallout, and Bethesda's not part of it. For me, they will never be anything but pretenders who bought the rights."

MadMax,3855tx,nemothorx,12,Mon Jun 1 23:14:15 2015 UTC,"There was something oddly cathartic about how the ""death of the Bullet Farmer"" was filmed. In a movie with non-stop action and death, it was surprisingly refreshing to simply have Max run off and kill Bullet Farmer off screen. You'd think one would be upset that the scene played off screen and we only see the aftermath as Max walks back with bags of ammo, but I actually enjoyed the scene, or the lack thereof."
MadMax,3855tx,Beeslo,10,Tue Jun 2 15:48:07 2015 UTC,"I absolutely love that they never focused on his battle with the Bullet Farmer and instead chose to keep the focus on Furiosa and the ladies. It's a great tell as to how this really isn't a film about Max. I like to believe that it's actually a story that Max is telling us about Furiosa and the wives and so he's focusing on telling us about them instead of telling us about his own experiences. Instead of bragging about his own vengeful successes, he's focusing on the people that basically saved him and brought him one step closer to confronting his demons and finding redemption.   I agree so wholeheartedly on how oddly cathartic that scene was. It was also very cathartic that the big bad didn't get a huge dramatic death scene. Furiosa simply ripped off his mask/jaw and that was it. You didn't really see much more of him. He didn't have a moment where he was able to say one last remark or traumatize Toast right before he died. The small decisions like that really make me trust George Miller and the editors who worked on the movie because it was really refreshing with the way they handled death of both the good and the bad and also the way they handled grief and blame as well."
MadMax,3855tx,Moist_Matt,2,Tue Jun 2 17:02:29 2015 UTC,Yeah the best film makers know when to let the audience use their imagination.

MadMax,3855tx,sardu1,8,Mon Jun 1 23:53:06 2015 UTC,Oh that's right I forgot he was carrying the guzzoline when he left. Probably my favorite part of the movie because it doesn't even show the Bullet Farmer die but you know it happened

MadMax,386zv2,praz911,1 point,Tue Jun 2 08:27:39 2015 UTC,"I love how little CGI was used, even by the before and after comparisons - the vast majority of it was just the equivalent of matte painting, those painted backdrops that used to be used in films before CGI was invented, or else throwing a plain colour filter over the standard shot. Both techniques go back to the dawn of film, and barely even qualify as CGI even if these days they're performed on computer rather than using the older techniques.  The only times it's really noticeable as more than just matte painting/plain filtering is when they add in vehicles afterwards to make sure no stunt riders actually get killed in the very real non-CGI explosions, or for the giant storm scene. I can forgive the use of computer special effects when it's a choice between that or literally getting your actors killed, not just gratuitous abuse of a server farm."
MadMax,385pok,dmasterdyne,13,Tue Jun 2 01:11:30 2015 UTC,"that's an interesting interpretation, but it's the kind of meaning i can't help but suspect only came about upon reflection when Miller may have intended nothing more than ""Furiosa is a better shot"" and it just happens that it's also metaphorically tied to her intentions.  let's not forget it was Max who's forethought persuaded Furiosa to take the Citadel when her entire plan at that point was to just continue traveling in one direction and hope to get lucky."

MadMax,385pok,leonryan,7,Tue Jun 2 08:41:33 2015 UTC,I'd have to agree with leonryan here. I think OP is overreaching here. The significance of the rifle scene is that Max is practical and forward thinking enough to not let his pride force him to waist the remaining bullet.   Some idiots see this as Max getting his balls chopped off but the truth is he was man enough to accept his limitations for the greater good.
MadMax,385pok,teaqualizer,3,Tue Jun 2 09:51:53 2015 UTC,"But then, she'd spent the entire time focussing on getting to a place that she thought would solve her problems and be an endgame, only for her to find out it no longer exists. From there, the idea of a U-turn for her is incomprehensible. Her goal has been destroyed, but she still feels she has to move forward (maybe due to 'running' the entire film, and Joe's armada seeming invincible and following her to the ends of the earth).  Or perhaps she reasons that at this point, chasing a dream across the salt is no different from what she already had been doing."

MadMax,385pok,Peanlocket,2,Tue Jun 2 12:35:35 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say she ""beat"" Max. She would have killed him after the sucker-tackle if the shotgun was loaded but after that Max turned it around. And Nux was unconscious half the time, putting Max at a disadvantage. Furiosa was rested, had situational awareness/familiarity with surroundings, a stashed gun and 5 healthy women to help her while Max was tired, thirsty, confused, arguably unarmed and had an unconscious man chained to his head, and she still kind of got owned. She's still obviously badass, being a much better shot and at least an equal driver (I guess?), but I don't think she would beat Max hand-to-hand.  /nerdrage"

I imagine he'd be a hell of an inquistor too.   He also immediately broke his word to Joe about not harming the Wives.

The Furiosa/Max bromance was so refreshing, and the fact that Max did EVERYTHING to keep her going including giving his own blood? That was great. He had been through hell with this woman, he was definitely NOT going to let her die!"
MadMax,3843v3,south_wildling,20,Mon Jun 1 18:48:30 2015 UTC,"YES! I loved the progression of Max/Furiosa relationship, and it was almost done entirely through actions. Building on OP's examples:   In their first encounter they almost kill each other, then Max straight-up leaves them stranded. Next, Max realizes that he needs Furiosa, since she knows the kill switches for the Rig. Shortly after, Fuirosa realizes that her plan has gone to shit (3 war parties in pursuit) and she knows she'll need Max as well, and this comes right off the heels of the scene where Max volunteers to check the malfunction of the extra gas tanker in haul (the start of building trust). Great chemistry without any sappy romantic crap. Moving along, they continue to earn each other's respect.   Ill point out 2 more key moments in the progression of their relationship that I found compelling; both come from the scene where they fight The Bullet Farmer (fuck yea, Bullet Farmer!). First, the scene with the rifle. I'm going to restate another comment I've read which i thought was brilliant:   The symbolism behind the rifle/carbine shot:   Max misses the shot twice. The 'long shot'. This represents Max's inability to go with a long term plan: back to a major theme: survival. Max is living for right now, surviving any way he can. Fuirosa on the other hand, has a long term plan. Get the 'breeders' out of Citidel, and get to ""The Greenplace"". This is represented physically and literally by her ability to hit the long distance snipe shot. boom. Again, they complement one another, and create something more then they can be individually. Then Max goes on the offense to take out the Bullet Farmer. Now we're almost at a place where the characters trust each other enough to start acting proactively instead of in reaction to one another. This comes to a beautiful climax when Max offers his help and a plan - 'We go back the way we came, TAKE THE CITIDEL TOGETHER!  FUCK I LOVED THIS FILM."
MadMax,3843v3,dmasterdyne,11,Mon Jun 1 21:10:37 2015 UTC,"There's a moment in the final chase where Max kicks a guy (with a chainsaw?) off the hood of the War Rig, and he locks eyes with Furiosa through the windshield. That moment set my emotional engagement for the rest of that final chase, because I could see in everything he did afterwards that he was trying to get back to her and knock the next guy off her back.   When he pulls alongside her in the People Eater's big rig, and one of the wives shouts to him, ""She's hurt! She's hurt real bad!"" it's just like GET BACK THERE RIGHT NOW BUDDY. And he seems to feel it too. Then shit keeps getting in the way, and he's punted all over the place, but it isn't just random flailing around, because I always felt a clear drive in him to get back to the front of the rig. When he sees that she's climbing onto Joe's truck he really gets desperate, and that fairly simple emotional story really kept me in the sequence. Otherwise, it might have just felt like a cluttered collection of things happening.   But it all starts with that look through the windshield, grounding us in the sense they are working tightly together, even when he's several vehicles back, and she's climbing onto Joe's truck alone. He gets there just in time to catch her. Oh my god, I love it. Okay, enough salivating.   Edit: When Miller talks about having Margaret Sixel edit the film so it doesn't feel like a typical action movie, I always think of this moment and wonder if she thought it was important. There are far more meaningful looks in the film than exchanges of dialogue, and I read that she said it is hard to edit things without dialogue, that it felt like a relief when finally there was a scene with dialogue. But man, she really knocked it out of the park with making sure silent exchanges still communicated a great deal."
MadMax,3843v3,adventurefine,5,Mon Jun 1 19:35:39 2015 UTC,"Yes to all of that, and on the flipside from Furiosa's point of view the harder things get the more dangerous she becomes. More resolute, to the point where a collapsing lung doesn't stop her from taking on a fellow Imperator."
MadMax,3843v3,Turbofurball,13,Mon Jun 1 20:04:18 2015 UTC,"As someone who can never go home, the silent scream in the desert got me. She had done so much, committed all of herself, to get to a home that's just not there any more."
MadMax,3843v3,Turbofurball,5,Mon Jun 1 20:07:03 2015 UTC,"After Max kills the Bullet Farmer, I liked the confusion on Nux's face when his Blood Bag gives him a steering wheel and a boot.  I'm not sure what was going on in Max's mind to make him reach out to his former captor, and Nux didn't seem to, either.  Still Nux looked like he enjoyed the new steering wheel and I liked the scene."
MadMax,3843v3,Corydoran,4,Mon Jun 1 22:52:24 2015 UTC,"Nux's sacrifice. Not exactly a ""no dialogue"" moment but you take into account the sheer devotion the war boys have to their cult and the gravity behind the phrase ""witness me"" when they do something they believe is the full culmination of their purpose in life. Demanding a witness indicates that the next action taken is the single most important thing they will ever do. For Nux to make his action the thing that allows them to win, it becomes a powerful act of love. Reciprocating the grace the young wife showed him. It also proved that the war boys, those caught up in the lies of religion CAN be redeemed."
MadMax,3843v3,darthmaverick,3,Tue Jun 2 04:39:05 2015 UTC,"The young Wife comforting Nux: just a moment, a breath from the action   Yes, I loved this. That moment when she runs her finger over his scarified skull lips."
MadMax,3843v3,CoruscantSunset,4,Tue Jun 2 00:35:29 2015 UTC,"Personally, I thought the scene where Max gives Furiosa a blood transfusion was in some ways more intimate than a love scene. I guess it's kind of weird to make such a connection, and I'm glad the filmmakers avoided romance, but in a way I thought that scene was kind of sweet. He's literally using his own life force to sustain Furiosa. It wasn't the typical scene where the hero explodes into action mode to save the damsel in distress, it was very intimate and personal and it highlighted Max's saner, softer side. It was neat and I appreciated it."

To be completely honest, in spite of how many times it is mentioned in the film and even with the scene where ""UNIVERSAL DONOR"" is tattooed on his back, I completely missed all of that and was wondering how he was able to give blood to Nux and Furiosa. It wasn't until the second time I saw the film that I realized Max's blood is type O."
MadMax,3843v3,AfraidOfTechnology,2,Tue Jun 2 00:46:27 2015 UTC,"I have to come back to add to this, and thank you everyone who's replied so far. It's really heartening to see moviegoers who are responding to real emotions from real characters instead of a lot of contrivances. The utter gulf that there is from Age of Ultron (the last blockbuster I saw to this) is immense. And quite frankly, Joss Whedon can't hold a candle to emotional honesty such as we see in Fury Road. My own personal thoughts, at least. But...  Another couple of scenes that caught me off-guard emotionally.   Max's nightmare saving his life: aside from the often horrifying death stares he gets from his daughter/someone he failed to save? 'She' saves him twice. When she asks him to follow her to the rest of the group, he's moved, even -compelled- to respond with his own humanity to help. To -belong-. It's the moment Miller lets Max drive the situation after just reacting for so long. And in turn plays into the next scene where Furiosa accepts his help. Willingly.   The other moment the vision saves him is with the quarrel through his hand into his forehead. Shocking, brilliant. The vision is almost like a force of its own, protecting and sustaining him.   The ending: Max's hesitant, almost murmured explanation of who he is. As if he's vulnerable and giving up his most prized possession: his identity. My heart just went out to him because Furiosa cared enough to -want- to know. And Max was Max again.   This, combined with the just bonded way they stand on the People Eater's rig supporting each other and their shared looks as he goes on his way to wherever next. A completely unshakeable, unbreakable bond. Only their sense of redemption prevents them from going on to have any sort of feelings for each other, but that's fine.   I ached for Max in that final scene, that he couldn't stay, that he can -never- stay. Everything he ever wanted was wrenched from him long ago and while he can still be a good person, he can't ever go home again, just like Furiosa. I -wanted- him to go home, finally.   Maybe, just maybe, Max and Furiosa will meet again and who knows, travel the wastelands as equals.   And wouldn't that be just damn cool?"

I mean, these two actors are known to act through their eyes, 'cause they're just on that next level of acting. I couldn't imagine anyone else playing Max and Furiosa.

MadMax,385zba,Deathtrip,3,Tue Jun 2 03:35:45 2015 UTC,"We don't know how long the chase/hunt lasted. I think they made mention in the movie that they recovered no gas from his interceptor, meaning it was probably out. This is a big factor.   The point story-wise is Max is caught, to drag it out doesn't serve the story in any way. If anything it highlights how vulnerable even the strongest survivers are in this environment. Plus we also learn early on (right before the title) that Max is difficult to contain.  In this universe it is VERY easy to get fucked up in the most horrible of ways ""out on the road."" Generally, most of these road races end when someone fucks up.   In Road Warrior, Max's fully gassed interceptor was taken out by a dude wearing ass-less chaps. All it takes is a little NOs and Immortan Joe's War Boys seemed well financed."

MadMax,385zba,nemothorx,1 point,Tue Jun 2 08:04:23 2015 UTC,"I just watched The Road Warrior for the first time a few hours ago and I was really thrown off by that scene. It looked to me in that moment like the biker shattering the window with a piece of pipe was somehow enough to flip the car dramatically. I was like ""...seriously? A bit of nitro and a pipe to the window = trashed Interceptor?"" I get that it's entirely possible that they also sideswiped him or distracted/interfered with Max enough to cause him to lose control, but based only on what you see on screen it comes off as a really strange incident, at least it did to me. Phenomenal movie though. Prior to Fury Road, my only experience with the films was a half-remembered broadcast of the first movie on late night TV over a decade ago, so it's nice to finally take the series in properly."
MadMax,385zba,TheBitterSeason,2,Tue Jun 2 11:43:35 2015 UTC,"I read it as that Max didn't expect them to come up beside him so fast, so when the windshield was hit, he reacted instinctively - steering sharp left and off the embankment - leading to rolling.   This compares with earlier when he drives the big rig into the compound, and someone throws a rock at the windshield - he saw and expected that coming, so it didn't cause such a problem."
MadMax,385zba,nemothorx,6,Tue Jun 2 11:53:04 2015 UTC,"Guys, keep in mind, sure the Interceptor was blown up in the final fight, but it's come back from worse! Who's willing to bet when Max left Furiosa at the Citadel, he was heading right back to the battlefield to find and fix his Interceptor? There will be no shortage of spare parts he could use...   And as for getting captured too easily, Max and his Interceptor aren't exactly in the best shape when we meet him. The tires are roughly patched, who knows what else is wrong...plus I just think he's never met a party of War Boyz before and doesn't know to look out for those explosive lances they throw. Maybe he just miscalculated and waited too long to hit the gas. It only takes a moment to screw it all up.   Either way I'd be shocked if that Interceptor doesn't make a comeback in the sequel. If Fury Road was missing one thing, it was an awesome Hero Moment for that iconic car. We needed to really see it doing what it can do (mostly drive really fast, tbh.)"

MadMax,385zba,uponthecityofzephon,1 point,Tue Jun 2 20:48:53 2015 UTC,"Well, I thought that about Splendid, too. I think it might be an indication that she didn't actually go beneath the wheels. The fall alone was enough to kill her.   Or, well, maybe it didn't hit her square as we'd think but crushed her legs. We never really see anything besides her torso and face."
MadMax,385zba,TWK128,2,Tue Jun 2 03:21:04 2015 UTC,"on my second watch knowing what was coming it doesn't appear to have gone right over her, when Joe pulls off to the side and the truck crashes you can see her to the side of the truck in a brief flash as the truck is tipping over."
MadMax,385zba,Teantis,2,Tue Jun 2 03:59:26 2015 UTC,"I've seen it four times and could never get a clear look. A dust cloud obscures it, but unless the right tires bounced up, I'm pretty sure they ran her over. If I was Max looking through the side mirror, I would have said, ""she went under the wheels"" too."

MadMax,385zba,wile_e_canuck,1 point,Tue Jun 2 16:22:25 2015 UTC,I agree. I think we could have benefited from just a few minutes of Max cruising around and scavenging for parts and food while trying to avoid the various wasteland gangs and thugs. Then we see him get caught.
MadMax,383j84,DarkKnightXIII,8,Mon Jun 1 16:25:58 2015 UTC,They're definitely signals (he says something about signalling gastown that they convoy is moving IIRC); I'm not sure if they're on screen long enough to translate more than just a few letters. It would be interesting.
MadMax,383j84,fultron,4,Mon Jun 1 18:00:28 2015 UTC,"That's interesting, I never thought that it could be morse code. I'd love to see what the transition is!"
MadMax,383j84,avanns,2,Mon Jun 1 18:22:16 2015 UTC,Weren't they just flashes of light from the telescopes? I thought maybe because Furiosa waits for both of them to go out before going offroad
MadMax,383j84,NotRefuse,11,Mon Jun 1 17:02:12 2015 UTC,I thought they were signal reflectors for sure.  It didn't occur to me that it might have been morse code.   I'm super curious.
MadMax,383j84,skonen_blades,1 point,Mon Jun 1 17:51:03 2015 UTC,"I thought they'd be signals at first too, but I didn't think they flashed in any predictable way. Morse code is pretty fast after all..."

MadMax,383j84,Peanlocket,5,Thu Jun 4 23:48:18 2015 UTC,It was definitely some type of communication between Citadel and Gas Town. I'm pretty sure Joe even comments about letting Gas Town know the convoy left. Then it's after Gas Town responds (presumably that the convoy is in sight) that Furiosa heads offroad. She was trying to buy as much time as possible by waiting until after Gas Town sent their signal.
MadMax,383j84,TangibleBreezeOQueef,1 point,Mon Jun 1 19:01:19 2015 UTC,"In relation to each other, they wouldn't ""go out"" or disappear. They will disappear from Furiosa's POV due to her movement and possible terrain changes. In the real world this is a LOS transmission, and as the transmitter and receiver are motionless, they are always in the others FOV. Think of it in terms of the signal fires in the Lord of the Rings movies, or even Mulan if you wish."

MadMax,3844d6,leonryan,3,Mon Jun 1 20:58:48 2015 UTC,i walked into my comic shop and there it was in the Vertigo section for 5 bucks.  are you telling me i should be scalping them?
MadMax,3844d6,leonryan,4,Tue Jun 2 06:46:43 2015 UTC,"I don't think you're going to get rich doing this, but if you're buying them for $5, and they're selling for $20-$40 online, you can make a few quick bucks if you can grab a few copies.   I personally think that Fury Road has the potential to turn into a franchise similar to... dare I say it.... Star Wars. There are many of the same elements: A rich world open to imagination, colorful characters, tons of room for back stories, just the right amount of weirdness etc. But for that to happen, lots of things have to go right (like another couple of movies on the same level as Fury Road at minimum, no small feat!).   If that does happen, a first edition of the comic would probably be a fairly valuable collectors item, judging by it's level of scarcity only 3 weeks from it's release. Of course I'm talking like years and years from now."
MadMax,3844d6,MrMisterMarty,4,Tue Jun 2 13:29:53 2015 UTC,"yeah i'm not likely to go buy them all up just to resell them for profit.  i hate it when people do that.  i've never considered preserving a comic before either but I might just put this one away safely and leave it to my son.  I'd like to see the franchise blow up too, but if it's going to I'd like to see it happen in Miller's lifetime so he can really set it in stone.

MadMax,384pko,denimgremlin,2,Mon Jun 1 21:44:03 2015 UTC,"I can't remember either, but I'm not sure that any of the warboys were branded. Probably because, like you said, they're not citadel property."
MadMax,384pko,batunderscoreman,2,Mon Jun 1 21:16:05 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure that Nux is meant to be branded, even though we don't see it, because at one point one of the wives shouts at him something close to, 'That's why we all wear his brand on our backs!' and somehow the way she said it or the context of their conversation made it seem like her 'we' included Nux and not just meaning 'we the brides'.  That said, we see a number of war boys from the back (particularly the older one who keeps coming to the window of the War Rig to talk to Furiosa when she first goes off-road) and I can't remember seeing a brand on any of them, but I also wasn't really looking."
MadMax,384pko,CoruscantSunset,1 point,Tue Jun 2 00:29:54 2015 UTC,i doubt warboys need a logo because they're indoctrinated and easily identifiable as practically a part of joe himself.  and they do have things like engines branded on their chests.

From their position, they could probably pick off quite a few War Boys with their weapons and firebombs, and the sheer amount of weapons, supplies, and parts they could take was probably more tantalizing than chasing the truck."
MadMax,384m83,Brutusness,3,Mon Jun 1 20:57:00 2015 UTC,That makes sense. Many people have noted that blocking the pass is a very temporary solution to stopping the warriors. But if they get ambushed after the crash...
MadMax,384m83,Peanlocket,2,Mon Jun 1 22:32:09 2015 UTC,A canyon with an enemy on high ground above it that likes to use grenades.  I could see the entire column getting wiped out depending on how many of those biker guys there were.  Could explain how Furiosa could expect to hold the citadel from the returning pursuers too.
MadMax,384m83,wile_e_canuck,2,Tue Jun 2 16:26:12 2015 UTC,"I thought the same thing. Perhaps they used that shot to establish that it was the same pass, but I hardly see the point of that. In the end, I'm with you, it really seems like they should've either cut that quick shot or added a couple shots afterward to have them join the chase or something."
MadMax,384m83,clavejones,5,Mon Jun 1 20:58:22 2015 UTC,"At the same time, had we not had that shot, the question would be, ""What happened to the mountain bikers when the convoy went back through the pass?""   Now we know. They were camped out when the War Rig came back through, and likely in no shape to join the chase right away. But when the war parties are stuck behind the crashed rig, they'll be pretty vulnerable."

MadMax,383gu0,spicymince,1 point,Mon Jun 1 18:14:34 2015 UTC,"Timeline of events (original trilogy) (from Madmax wikia):       This timeline has been assembled from various interviews with the creators of the movies, official documents & other legitimate sources. Movies themselves provide very little backstory and concrete information as to what exactly triggered the events leading up to the apocalypse. The first movie gives almost no exposition except for the opening line ""A few years from now"". The sequel provides a vague description of events that led to the apocalypse, not detailed enough to determine when it happened and who was responsible for it. The third movie shows a bit more of the backstory but again, it is rudimentary. The entire Mad Max trilogy doesn't provide any dates except for one: 10th of September 1999. It is the day Captain Walker left The Crack In The Earth along with other adults from the crashed Boeing 747 in search of civilization. George Miller revealed in an interview   from 1984 that the events of the first two movies took place some odd 15 years from then. This would place the first two movies in the mid to late 90's. Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome takes place 15-18 years after which puts it in 2014 - 2018.

MadMax,383gu0,autowikiabot,1 point,Mon Jun 1 18:15:12 2015 UTC,"The sequel provides a vague description of events that led to the apocalypse, not detailed enough to determine when it happened and who was responsible for it.   Given when RW was made I think it's pretty clear that the cold war between America and Russia turned hot"
MadMax,383gu0,Peanlocket,1 point,Mon Jun 1 19:35:57 2015 UTC,It was made in the 80's when generally both sides were getting tired of that shit but neither wanted to make the same decision of backing down out right for fear of being seen as a sign of weakness.
MadMax,383gu0,vulcanblight,1 point,Wed Jun 10 18:13:40 2015 UTC,"That was a good read, the only thing that didn't make sense was Wez being a Vietnam vet if the events of RW were late '90s. He didn't look that old."
MadMax,383gu0,Derpatologist_7,2,Tue Jun 2 00:07:00 2015 UTC,http://www.madmaxmovies.com/archives/web-pages/alex-maddison-mad-max-chronology/mchron.html  Even more time line but from the sources of the books based on the films. And the magazine based on Beyond Thunderdome.
MadMax,383gu0,vulcanblight,1 point,Wed Jun 10 18:14:53 2015 UTC,That is awesome. Thanks so much for sharing. I had Max pegged at being born circa 1975 so it looks like my dates marry up.   I appreciate the link. Thanks heaps :)
MadMax,383gu0,Derpatologist_7,1 point,Thu Jun 11 10:49:27 2015 UTC,Keep in mind this stuff was written year before the new film was even out of development hell. But yeah. Give a vivid idea of how things went down.
MadMax,383gu0,vulcanblight,2,Thu Jun 11 16:07:26 2015 UTC,I think it was clearly stated that it was nuclear war.  But is that what you meant?
MadMax,382q1t,bryanlharris,4,Mon Jun 1 12:50:36 2015 UTC,"It looked more like a machete to me, which was probably hidden somewhere on the war rig."
MadMax,382q1t,BobaFetted,3,Mon Jun 1 13:27:48 2015 UTC,Ah okay.  I guess I was hoping for an easter egg type thing.  That scene is darker and I had a hard time making it out.
MadMax,382q1t,dmasterdyne,4,Mon Jun 1 13:35:47 2015 UTC,"It's possible. There is so much for the imagination in this film. I love that the movie gave away just the right amount of info so you can follow everything, but moves too fast to give away too much, leaving us to wonder and speculate about this odd world. Fucking beautiful film."
MadMax,382q1t,Turbofurball,3,Mon Jun 1 14:20:34 2015 UTC,"It's a stylized Kukri, a very handy weapon to have!"
MadMax,382q1t,leonryan,2,Mon Jun 1 20:13:49 2015 UTC,Oh that makes sense.  It's a weird knife that's bent a tiny bit like a boomerang.
MadMax,382q1t,YeOldeBaconWhoure,2,Mon Jun 1 21:26:43 2015 UTC,it's a gurkha kukri and they do look a little like a razor boomerang.
MadMax,381p4n,DumKopfNZ,4,Mon Jun 1 05:26:48 2015 UTC,"Was driving home last night and the fuel light came on, as I turned off the AC I totally thought of this :)"

MadMax,3833vf,Sleep_The_Sage,2,Mon Jun 1 14:40:54 2015 UTC,"Spoilers for the original and Fury Road below.  If you mean Max's wife in the first movie, she technically survived but since she's not in The Road Warrior, it's presumed she either eventually died from her injuries between movies, or because of the apocalypse happening.  If you mean in Fury Road, she was just barely alive after falling off the War Rig and being run over. She most likely either bled out from the impromptu C-section, or her technically still-living body was simply discarded after Joe found out his child was dead."
MadMax,3833vf,pickelsurprise,8,Mon Jun 1 14:51:12 2015 UTC,"If I remember correctly, the Organic Mechanic says, ""Your girly's breathing her last,"" so she was pretty close to death even before the impromptu C-section."
MadMax,3833vf,witty_username_ftw,2,Mon Jun 1 15:09:14 2015 UTC,i thought he  said she was breathing atlast.
MadMax,3833vf,Brutusness,2,Mon Jun 1 16:05:47 2015 UTC,It's that Aus accent.
MadMax,3833vf,bryanlharris,2,Mon Jun 1 16:31:58 2015 UTC,Yeah and he was spitting all over the place more than the bad guy from Air Force One.
MadMax,383e8z,FuckGiblets,15,Mon Jun 1 15:54:35 2015 UTC,All new characters.  All new story.  Only Max is the same character.  Maybe something a little different in tone with more talking.
MadMax,383e8z,skonen_blades,10,Mon Jun 1 18:02:50 2015 UTC,Yeop. Furiosa was completely fucking awesome and I never want to see her again in the Mad Max franchise. Maybe Charlize*sorry can grow her hair out and play a new character. I think I could handle that.
MadMax,383e8z,AeoSC,2,Mon Jun 1 21:00:38 2015 UTC,Charlize  FTFY.
MadMax,383e8z,Derpatologist_7,2,Tue Jun 2 00:14:49 2015 UTC,"Jeez, I butchered that. Thanks."
MadMax,383e8z,AeoSC,5,Tue Jun 2 03:04:21 2015 UTC,"Absolutely!  Maybe going into a former city, or underground city, or something weird like that :-)"
MadMax,383e8z,Turbofurball,2,Mon Jun 1 20:14:54 2015 UTC,"whoa, an underground city would be really cool and a nice contrast to the wide open desert environments of the rest of movies."
MadMax,383e8z,denimgremlin,3,Mon Jun 1 22:57:25 2015 UTC,"Exactly, you need some kinda relief from plain and barren desert. In Fury Road thats the Citadel, Wall of Rock, and the former Green Place ... it'll be interesting to see what Miller comes up with :-)"
MadMax,383e8z,Turbofurball,7,Tue Jun 2 07:11:14 2015 UTC,"The title ""Mad Max: Maximum Madness""."
MadMax,383e8z,Lvnch,1 point,Mon Jun 1 20:40:09 2015 UTC,"A prequel with more Immortan Joe, more War Packs, and more Chaos. Which it seems is happening with Hardy signed on for two more films."
MadMax,383e8z,bholzi88,8,Mon Jun 1 16:10:04 2015 UTC,"I'm hoping for a whole new story with Max being the only recurring character. I would like, if (when) there are more, for each film to be able to stand alone as an independent story. As if with each one we are just seeing a short snippet of Max's crazy life in the wastes."
MadMax,383e8z,TriumphzZ,2,Mon Jun 1 17:49:23 2015 UTC,I thought a sequel was already in the works and it was called wasteland. However it was originally called furiosa
MadMax,383e8z,TriumphzZ,1 point,Tue Jun 2 08:38:07 2015 UTC,I'm asking the question purely as a hypothetical. Ignoring anything we may know about a planned sequel.
MadMax,383e8z,Snowfire870,1 point,Tue Jun 2 15:39:21 2015 UTC,Fair enough
MadMax,381uot,MuffinSnakes,11,Mon Jun 1 06:26:42 2015 UTC,that would be cool. What flairs should we suggest?  A few from Fury Road since that's in my mind the most...    Warboy Wargirl Imperator Immortan Mad Polecat
MadMax,381uot,nemothorx,10,Mon Jun 1 07:47:00 2015 UTC,Don't forget classic stuff too like:    MFP Officer Gyocoptor Pilot Thunderdome Fighter Feral Road Warrior Bartertown Trader Ayatollah of Rock n' Rollah Smegma Crazy Gayboy Berzerker Cutter of toes

MadMax,381uot,leonryan,5,Mon Jun 1 09:48:31 2015 UTC,I think the most memorable vehicles should get flair also. Doof Wagon flair would be amazing
MadMax,381uot,SaxMan100,3,Mon Jun 1 08:52:58 2015 UTC,can't believe nobody said Doof Warrior yet

MadMax,381uot,denimgremlin,3,Mon Jun 1 09:14:13 2015 UTC,Humongous Night Rider And I second Ayatollah of Rock 'n' Rolla. That's the one that I would use.
MadMax,381uot,The_Nez,2,Mon Jun 1 12:03:24 2015 UTC,"Shiny  Chrome  Also, how does one even  flair on reddit? I have been wondering for some time."
MadMax,381uot,dizzykitty,1 point,Mon Jun 1 15:43:05 2015 UTC,"It's a setting per sub-reddit. The moderators of the sub can enable them, then subscribers to that subreddit can set them from the designated options."

MadMax,381uot,Tr0k3n,1 point,Tue Jun 2 22:24:15 2015 UTC,These are all awesome but do any of us even know how to do flair?
MadMax,380hn8,Brutusness,14,Sun May 31 23:08:24 2015 UTC,I also like how each vehicle had a specific purpose such as the ones with harpoons and claws to slow down vehicles and pursuit vehicles made to disable other vehicles
MadMax,380hn8,Grayfoxxhounds777,13,Mon Jun 1 01:41:34 2015 UTC,I thought Nux's car being this hot rod Deuce Coupe was perfect for his character too.
MadMax,380hn8,denimgremlin,1 point,Mon Jun 1 01:04:25 2015 UTC,"The movie and the genre in general seems to be a celebration of unique characters, only the most incredibly badass will survive in any sense. It kind of reminded me of the warriors, even the crows who had about 6 seconds of screen time were memorable and unique."
MadMax,380hn8,dangoofed,1 point,Mon Jun 1 05:34:50 2015 UTC,the hype im feeling for this game is going to kill me
MadMax,380hn8,Cambot1337,1 point,Mon Jun 1 10:42:31 2015 UTC,I really hope they do make each tribe unique.  Similar to how every gang/tribe in Fist of the North Star had some unique element.

MadMax,37z95c,bawlzsauce,3,Sun May 31 23:01:30 2015 UTC,Can it be ordered as a set?
MadMax,37z95c,schneiderwm,3,Sun May 31 20:10:26 2015 UTC,"No, but I could count up all the parts and order them individually if I wanted to, which I do, and will do in the future."

MadMax,381t3m,Oh_Thats_Just_Fred,61,Mon Jun 1 06:08:46 2015 UTC,"they chrome themselves in preparation to ride forever through valhalla.  they only do it right when they expect to die because chrome is the pinnacle of motoring prestige.  they demand witnesses to ensure their contribution will be acknowledged in the afterlife.  it's probably also a reference to how many young men's last words before death in a fiery crash are ""WATCH THIS!""."
MadMax,381t3m,leonryan,25,Mon Jun 1 06:16:09 2015 UTC,"I feel like it's also a reference to 'chroming', where kids inhale aerosols or solvents (often spray paint). It gives you a bit of head rush and get's your heart racing. It's  unfortunately common among indigenous kids here in Australia, and I could easily see it becoming a ritual among Warboys."
MadMax,381t3m,Sam_Strong,10,Mon Jun 1 09:56:25 2015 UTC,yeah definitely.  huffing paint or sniffing petrol.
MadMax,381t3m,leonryan,2,Mon Jun 1 10:00:07 2015 UTC,"That's true, aboriginals are so addicted to huffing aerosol paint and solvents that you'll often see them ripping off picket fences and burning them in bonfires so they can get high off the fumes."

MadMax,381t3m,nemothorx,17,Mon Jun 1 07:41:13 2015 UTC,"A lot of the cars from the '50s and '60s had these big, wide chrome bumpers and grills, making it look like they had huge, shiny mouths (eg, this '60 Corvette, '55 Chevy, '59 Cadillac, '60 Beetle (no grill, but you get the idea), '65 Valiant, etc). Painting their own mouths chrome is their way of emulating the cars they worship, preparing themselves to ride eternal on the roads of Valhalla."

MadMax,37z89e,Carninator,2,Sun May 31 18:24:49 2015 UTC,The only way I can get it will cost me 36 euro. Do you think it's worth this? I'm really tempted to get it as I fucking adore the movie!

MadMax,37z89e,IndyBrodaSolo,3,Mon Jun 1 01:25:15 2015 UTC,I hear you dude - it's just over $40 in Canada whereas it's $25 in America.  Do check out the reviews on the US Amazon website - a couple of people have done flipthroughs so you can see the contents of the book. Maybe it'll help you decide whether or not to drop the cash on it.
MadMax,37z89e,kuuuma,2,Mon Jun 1 01:39:07 2015 UTC,"I've seen 2 flip throughs, although I've skimmed through them as I don't want to see too much in case I do buy the book. I'm really liking what I see and it seems like a fantastic book but I've never spent anything near 36€ on a book so I'm just hesitant.

MadMax,380cbi,BobaFetted,3,Mon Jun 1 04:05:39 2015 UTC,I've seen it 7 times so far. Probably going again soon!
MadMax,380cbi,AfraidOfTechnology,2,Mon Jun 1 13:27:06 2015 UTC,"I've only seen it three times, but pretty much every day I talk myself out of going to see it again. I really want to see it in IMAX, but there are no IMAX showings in the entire metroplex."
MadMax,380cbi,treverhaas,2,Mon Jun 1 00:37:40 2015 UTC,Just 3 times. But I only paid $5 the third time because the theater does $5 Tuesday's. I've been trying to use that as justification for a fourth viewing next Tuesday so it's like I only really paid to see it three times.
MadMax,380cbi,avanns,2,Mon Jun 1 02:02:27 2015 UTC,Just saw it for a third time tonight. I think I'm going again this upcoming weekend with some coworkers. I have a problem but I'm totally okay with it.

First time i've seen a movie in a cinema more than once, and since it seems to be pretty common it has me wondering about the box office earnings and whether a studio is as happy making 3 million from 1 million patrons or if they'd be concerned that it's not 3 million patrons.  I wonder if they're satisfied with a rabid cult following rather than mass appeal."

MadMax,380cbi,cobrareaper,1 point,Mon Jun 1 06:19:44 2015 UTC,Saw it both last and this Sunday and watched Game of Thrones immediately after. Thinking of going a third time with my friend (who 's apathetic about seeing it but I want him to experience it so I'm forcing him to go). It was fun seeing it a second time because I didn't have to pay attention to the plot as much (do it for every movie I watch the first time) and could just focus on all the details.

MadMax,381u1b,uponthecityofzephon,3,Mon Jun 1 06:18:47 2015 UTC,"Nux could be shorthand/slang for knuckles.  Like maybe he was a good brawler or like, picked the name because he wanted to sound like a good brawler.  I imagine they all have one-syllable nicknames."

MadMax,381u1b,skonen_blades,3,Mon Jun 1 14:55:00 2015 UTC,I wonder how Rictus Erectus got his name...
MadMax,381u1b,ILiveIDieILiveAgain,3,Mon Jun 1 08:43:17 2015 UTC,"Given his sibling's name, Corpus Colossus, I feel like there's probably some ironic twist to all Immortan Joe's sons' names. ""Rictus"" apparently means ""a fixed grimace or grin."" This could just be due to the fact that he's always scowling, but I think it could also be because he has a deformed jaw and has trouble speaking. The rubber, uh, thing around his chin is obvious, but on my second viewing I started wondering if maybe he needs it to keep his mouth from hanging open all the time.  Now I have to wonder if Scrotus is sterile, or maybe he has some other, er, deformity..."
MadMax,381u1b,pickelsurprise,2,Mon Jun 1 13:06:30 2015 UTC,He was probably just a huge dick wad so Joe sent him to gas town.
MadMax,381u1b,dizzykitty,2,Mon Jun 1 15:40:13 2015 UTC,"On the issue of reading and writing, many people who can't really read or write are able to write their own names, at least. And none of the war boys seem to have particularly complex names. It wouldn't take much effort to learn how to read and write 'Nux'.   I believe that he wrote that on his own gas pedal. I could be wrong, but just what I think.  Also, the Citadel seems to have History Men/Women (I think they're called) so I don't think it's too far out of the question to think that the war pups get some very basic education, including how to read, at least a little.  We never really see much of the Citadel or what 'amenities' are available.  Also, the war boys seem to have wildly varying lifespans. Like some of the war boys (to me) looked like they were in their 30s or older, like the one who kept coming to the window of the War Rig to talk to Furiosa. Even ignoring how flaky his paint was, he looked way older than a lot of them. Nux is just a kid and he's already dying. I could see how Immortan Joe would want them to have some slight education since there has to be some kind of ranking system and the war boys who have been lucky enough to have grown older must earn some kind of ranks with some responsibility and authority. Reading would be a big help there.  Just my two cents.  Edit: But I agree with OP that they're not born with their names, but either earn them or are given them. Slit is a perfect example of this. Obviously he got his name because of his face.  The comic claims that Nux was given his name as a child for being a 'tough nut to crack' and refusing to die, basically, but I have no idea if the comics are canon or if there is a canon, per se, with these films."
MadMax,381u1b,CoruscantSunset,2,Tue Jun 2 00:48:58 2015 UTC,The War Boy that does the suicide dive onto the Buzzard's car was called Morsov.

It's like a starting gun."

MadMax,380b2m,northamerimassgrave,8,Mon Jun 1 03:07:13 2015 UTC,"Do we think of Alien or A Nightmare On Elm Street as feminist films?  Most people don't.  But that helps the message, because it's not didactic.  Feminism is an element, an ingredient in the mix."
MadMax,380b2m,Shishin,5,Mon Jun 1 06:30:41 2015 UTC,"I'm starting to dislike the term ""feminist film"". Just because a film has a female lead that is done well doesn't really make it have an agenda. It's just a film, and a really good one."
MadMax,380b2m,MisterDamek,2,Mon Jun 1 03:52:31 2015 UTC,"Just because a film reflects themes of human equality, including specifically and obviously feminist themes (including the feminist theme of a man who regains his humanity in relation to a woman) -- just because a film reflects such themes doesn't mean it ""has an agenda."" What does that even mean? How does a film possess an agenda? And what makes a film with an agenda -- or strong themes -- good or bad? If you just mean artistic intent, all films ""have an agenda."" I would say all films have some creative intent, and when heavy-handed they can be quite bad, but some of the most compellingly good films are very subtle yet straightforward with their intent. Mad Max strikes me as squarely in the latter. Almost every major theme in it is also a major theme of contemporary feminism, so I tend to think everyone who wants it to not be somehow feminist is A) not very familiar with actual feminism, and B) has their own agenda."
MadMax,380b2m,skonen_blades,4,Tue Jun 2 11:05:52 2015 UTC,Hopefully in ten years all films will be like this and no one will call any of them feminist.  But this film IS feminist.  Right now.  Here.  In this time.  In comparison to like all other films. If this is the game changer it looks like then a slew will follow and having female leads in action films won't even be worthy of note.  So I see your point.  But I think the label's important.
MadMax,380b2m,Shishin,3,Mon Jun 1 06:28:53 2015 UTC,It seems like you didn't actually read the article. Having a female lead is just the tip of the iceberg of the film's feminism.
MadMax,380b2m,MisterDamek,2,Mon Jun 1 04:02:17 2015 UTC,That's fine but I just don't see the point in the label. It's an authentic representation of female characters in a film. I just don't think the whole movie needs a label of feminist because of one theme in the film.
MadMax,380b2m,Turbofurball,5,Mon Jun 1 04:09:39 2015 UTC,"So to you, feminism is about strong female characters?  I'll let you know, it also includes: body control and ownership; male compassion and empathy; consent; respect; healing. Hell, the non-consensual use of Max as a ""blood bag"" is a pretty clear parallel of the use of female bodies as milk mothers and breeders. Which makes his willing gift of blood to Furiosa at the end not only intimate but a supremely feminist male act. Not saying Max as a character is therefore become some paragon feminist male, but that dozens of themes of contemporary feminism are woven through this film. Even the empathy and comfort given to Nux by one of the wives.  This doesn't mean the film is only feminist, or that feminism has a monopoly on all themes of empathy, ethics, and equality, but it's not all just about ""oh hey there was a woman warrior, too."""
MadMax,380b2m,Broken_Goat,2,Tue Jun 2 11:12:29 2015 UTC,"""We are not things."""
MadMax,380b2m,Broken_Goat,1 point,Mon Jun 1 15:39:47 2015 UTC,"It's the dominant theme in the film. I think the bigger question is, and the one I would ask you... Why the resistance to the term feminism? Does it make the film less good if it's feminist? Perhaps it's a good film BECAUSE it's feminist, since that theme gives power and meaning to the action."
MadMax,380b2m,Broken_Goat,7,Mon Jun 1 04:22:21 2015 UTC,No...its good because its mad fucking max. Its a 2 hour car chase with post apocalytic scavanged vehicles.   They were spitting nitro into the engines in an impromptu drag race of sorts! Whats not to like about that?
MadMax,380b2m,Shishin,5,Mon Jun 1 04:41:46 2015 UTC,"None of that means anything if there's not a good story behind it. And good stories are almost always about more than their basic plot points, but are about deeper themes. That's what makes Fury Road noteworthy. Otherwise it's just empty action."
MadMax,380b2m,Shishin,1 point,Mon Jun 1 04:55:33 2015 UTC,Yeah theres a story...but its not force fed to you with tons of wasted screen time like other movies. You can dig deeper if you like or just enjoy at face value.
MadMax,380b2m,Shishin,2,Mon Jun 1 05:12:00 2015 UTC,"Who said that deeper themes need to be ""force fed""? I would agree that Fury Road does a fantastic job of giving the viewer a ton of information very efficiently and organically. But the bottom line is... if I were to sit you down and show you 2 hours of car chases without any context, or any reason to care about who's being chased, or why... you'd probably be pretty bored. What makes Fury Road interesting is that we're given a legitimate, meaningful reason to care about the action."
MadMax,380b2m,MisterDamek,2,Mon Jun 1 05:17:35 2015 UTC,"Obviously we're not on the same page and I cant convey my thoughts easily enough to understand.   Nothing here is force fed.   Each person in the movie has their own story.   I could literally watch them fight all day. Ive downloaded the movie and watched it somewhere north of 15 times. Making note of details, actions, and even more details. It doesnt get boring. Its awesome.   Everyones different though and will have different ideas of the movie."
MadMax,380b2m,howyadoineh,-2,Mon Jun 1 05:29:14 2015 UTC,"Ive downloaded the movie and watched it somewhere north of 15 times.    Dude, you might want to take a break and like go outside for a while or something. That's not healthy."
MadMax,380b2m,BundleOfHiss,3,Mon Jun 1 06:02:04 2015 UTC,I'm not saying it's bad or anything I just personally don't see why you would call it a feminist film. To me it's like calling a hot dog a hamburger. There is nothing wrong with either of those things and some ingredients are shared but that doesn't make them the same thing.
MadMax,380b2m,Renjingles,1 point,Mon Jun 1 05:15:12 2015 UTC,That argument makes no sense. It's called a feminist film because it's a film about emancipating sex slaves and destroying a system of patriarchy.
MadMax,380b2m,ILiveIDieILiveAgain,2,Mon Jun 1 05:19:28 2015 UTC,"Ok well I'll try a different approach then. Max has ptsd and that plays heavily in the film. The film isn't a ptsd movie or a poster child for people with severe psychiatric problems. It is just one piece of the character, a man running from his own inner demons. I would say that that theme is more central to the arc of the main character too but I still don't approve of lables."
MadMax,380b2m,Renjingles,2,Mon Jun 1 05:46:33 2015 UTC,"It's valid to point out the PTSD angle. And yes, that is something that Max is dealing with in the film, but the main narrative is about what Furiosa is trying to accomplish."
MadMax,380b2m,ILiveIDieILiveAgain,3,Mon Jun 1 06:00:31 2015 UTC,I guess that was were we differed is that I related more to Max's character and saw this as his journey and return to humanity.  I think that is more the overall point of the film as intended.
MadMax,380b2m,MisterDamek,2,Mon Jun 1 07:13:36 2015 UTC,"It's quite possible for films to encompass many different character arcs, and that's certainly part of Max's, but did you notice that part of what little healing he experienced all came from his interaction with women? Whom he eventually decided to help fight back against a patriarchal war machine?  I related to Max, too. But I also related to Nux, Furiosa, and quite a few of the others. They all had emotional journeys.  I don't think it's really valid to suggest one could just as easily argue it's a film about PTSD. Nothing is said in the film about the visions or voices he experiences, and they don't even really drive any action, though they do flesh out his character. I thought their addition were a great enhancement to the film, but I'll point out, the previous three films all worked fine without these glimpses of the inside of Max's head.  If you're looking for themes in a film, you look for plot and the actions, emotions, and words of the characters. These were largely feminist in nature. No one was talking about Max and his need for growth, no one took him to a therapist or tried to save him. But people did talk about ""we are not things,"" they did enact plans to free some enslaved women, and then to free a whole community from a violent warlord who saw all bodies, male and female, as tools - (war boys & blood bags as well as breeders & milk mothers).  They did depict, in action, Max growing and healing somewhat, reaching out to Furiosa and then healing her as well. Sure, that's a psychological character arc. But guess what: male emotional healing and mutual respect & consent are also feminist themes."
MadMax,380b2m,MisterDamek,0,Tue Jun 2 11:29:43 2015 UTC,"Allot of the feminism i see basically tells me i should fell horrible for being a man, that I'm the source of terrible things in the world and that I'm a bad person because I'm a man. This is mostly the impression i get from the feminism i see on Reddit, which is not an accurate portrayal of feminism in my opinion.   I think this is how allot of men on Reddit are exposed to feminism and it has left a negative impact on them. That's why they don't want to call mad max a feminist movie. they view feminism as something that hates them and doesn't want to include them.  That being said i like mad max. I like Charlize Therons character. I was totally rooting for the women in the movie. If that makes me a feminist then I'm a feminist haha."
MadMax,380b2m,dmasterdyne,2,Tue Jun 2 04:43:02 2015 UTC,"There's some truth to that. Feminism isn't about demonizing men, it's about demonizing misogyny, and condemning a celebration of a certain kind of toxic masculinity that comes at the expense of women's equality. There's nothing wrong with simply being a man, but there is something wrong with thinking that men are biologically and socially superior, and that women should accept their place as servants. Mad Max is a film that specifically targets this idea, and that's what makes it feminist. If men feel threatened by that, well, then, they need to take a hard look in the mirror."
MadMax,380m5o,LandmanCA,3,Sun May 31 23:45:06 2015 UTC,"I really disagree with the first paragraph where it says it lacks a strong narrative with no character development. I think it's more subtle and simple instead of convuluted and obvious, which is what can make this action movie so enjoyable."
MadMax,380m5o,HoustonsSolution,2,Mon Jun 1 00:03:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you pick up on that stuff a lot more on the second viewing.   The first time you see it I think you're just in awe of the spectacle it is and miss a lot of the development because, as you noted, it's subtle.  Especially in comparison to the rest of the movie.  I think that's part of why it is so great actually, the movie really stays out of its own way and just keeps moving forward.  It's fucking awesome."

But the guys driving the spikey cars were called Buzzards by Furiosa. So when the Many Mothers told of the water turning sour and the arrival of the crows, I followed the same line of reasoning and applied it to the stilt walkers. Also based on their appearance, they seemed to be wearing large ragged cloaks which might also put one in mind of crows."

MadMax,3806nj,LongHorsa,3,Sun May 31 21:55:50 2015 UTC,Miller said if there was a timeline that it would be after Thunderdome.  See this interview: http://www.fandango.com/movie-news/interview-director-george-miller-answers-all-your-big-mad-max-fury-road-questions-749278
MadMax,3806nj,sardu1,2,Sun May 31 22:18:40 2015 UTC,"My bigger issue with this isn't the car, but the lack of grey hair! How would he look younger!"
MadMax,3806nj,maximae,1 point,Sun May 31 23:06:11 2015 UTC,Tom Hardy is actually several years older than Gibson was during the filming of Beyond Thunderdome.
MadMax,3806nj,wheelsun131,1 point,Fri Jun 5 09:28:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I don't really get why they died Gibsons temples grey."
MadMax,3806nj,maximae,3,Fri Jun 5 17:59:51 2015 UTC,"I'm not following this theory at all.   You open with the theory that his truck is a ZF/ZG, as a stand-in for the XC, and say he might have retrieved it from Bartertown. Then you quote IMDB trivia which says that he drove it at the end of the movie!   The Ford XC Falcon is a close cousin of the Ford XB Falcon, which is the Intercepter. In the world of Mad Max converting it to a Ford XB Falcon-a-like wouldn't be too hard.   Actually, it was the immediately following model with minor mechanical, interior and exterior updates. ('cousin' would be a better description of the ZF/ZG IMHO). Converting an XC to look like an XB (or vice versa, and ditto the XA) is pretty trivial in this world, let alone in the movie world.  I'd be interested to see a better cite than IMDB trivia for the truck being ZF based, rather than F-series based. It's quite probable that the vehicle is an F-series truck chassis, with falcon/fairlane interior bits hybrid'd in. There are extra photos of it's exterior here:  http://www.madmaxmovies.com/mad-max-beyond-thunderdome/cars-and-vehicles/max-buggy/index.html"
MadMax,3806nj,nemothorx,2,Sun May 31 23:00:40 2015 UTC,mad max isn't bloody chronological.
MadMax,380xmr,McG2k1,23,Mon Jun 1 01:17:02 2015 UTC,"The Citadel had all the hallmarks of an unsustainable society. The biggest problem they have is conspicuous consumption. Joe distributes water to the masses in a visually impressive but wasteful way. He has an extravagant car for himself, the War Boys waste fuel, they have a truck with a flame throwing guitar, and they're in a wasteland where resources are scarce. All that is extremely wasteful and it's done for the sole purpose of propping up the myth of Immortan Joe being a god. It's basically why countries like North Korea waste money building amusement parks when there are millions of people starving.  Joe committed the resources of the three biggest settlements in that part of the wasteland just to go after the wives. Again, a huge waste of resources just to satisfy Joe's ego and maintain the illusion of power.  He's not doing anything to create a healthy human race. The War Boys are all sick. He's only using the wives for himself. He only wants his descendents to be healthy.  He doesn't care about the wives. He cares about their ability to give him heirs. Just look at what happens with Angharad. When she was dying, Joe had no problem letting the organic mechanic carve up open like an animal. He didn't care about Angharad, he only cared about the baby."
MadMax,380xmr,KingofMadCows,3,Mon Jun 1 03:49:22 2015 UTC,"Not to mention we only see him in the course of about four days. The only thing we see him accomplish that isn't directly related to the wives being stolen is having his war parties hunt down innocent passers by and enslave or kill them, and a plunder based army can only survive with constant warfare.  And he switched to agriculture because he had no access to pumps, and his form of agriculture requires massive enslavement."
MadMax,380xmr,uponthecityofzephon,-1,Mon Jun 1 06:08:00 2015 UTC,"we never see any of what you describe above in the film.  not a single thing.  the film opens with them chasing down Mad Max, who knows what he did?  why do you assume he's innocent?  There are a few hundred subjects down below the citadel, what purpose do they serve?  they arent slaves, they arent workers, yet somehow for some reason he keeps them alive."
MadMax,380xmr,uponthecityofzephon,3,Mon Jun 1 16:24:57 2015 UTC,"If he is trying to help those subjects, there are far better ways to distribute water to them than by pouring it on their heads. He is clearly a man of means, but yet has made no attempt to provide them with shelters, equal food distribution, or order.  As to their purpose, I'd say they are a large stock from which he derives his war boys. All healthy (as in they can walk and war, not live past twenty) males are taken from them to be trained as warpups. I haven't heard any other explanation.  And, again, he has a society build on slavery and plunder. All the warboys have a fascination with dying historic, which they can't do if Joe never fights anyone unless acting in self defense. By creating just a death cult, he has ensured that the only way his base of power is stable is by constantly enslaving others to steal their cars, which makes his army larger, which requires more fighting and enslaving.  Max isn't the only bloodbag we see. Furiosa was abducted as a child and made a slave. The Citadel only survives by grabbing everyone that can be used as a commodity and forcing them into servitude like a machine."
MadMax,380xmr,Turbofurball,3,Mon Jun 1 16:47:22 2015 UTC,"Very thorough analysis, I think OP isn't very aware of real life dictatorships."

MadMax,380xmr,Turbofurball,3,Mon Jun 1 16:25:43 2015 UTC,"Art is a reflection of life, that's the whole point.  Immortan Joe's actions can be seen in every one of histories most notorious dictatorships."
MadMax,380xmr,Volts-ohms-amps,-1,Mon Jun 1 16:33:24 2015 UTC,"exactly.  and he's not all bad.  I think this is what was missing for Vader in the prequels.  Understanding the choices made by the villain are probably for the best, even though they are distasteful.  the slippery slope into malevolent dictatorship."
MadMax,380xmr,xJ_Dx,3,Mon Jun 1 17:14:02 2015 UTC,"Your original post isn't about understanding motivation as much as it is trying to turn the tables completely.  Joe is a greedy psychopath at heart, he isn't trying to make a new civilization, he's trying to exert power in his every action."
MadMax,380xmr,dangoofed,8,Mon Jun 1 18:39:43 2015 UTC,"You have got a lovely point there. Mad Max and Imperator Furiosa then can be looked at as the antagonist, not the protagonist of the story then. It seems we want to vilifies Immorten Joe, but why  should we! Because he is different or from a culture we know nothing about. I feel this film has a lot of social commentary to it, if we just look a little deeper than the action, octane, and adrenaline."
MadMax,380xmr,Immortan__Joe,1 point,Mon Jun 1 01:38:48 2015 UTC,"That's arguable, because at first Furiosa wasn't necessarily trying to disrupt Joe's establishment, but rather she was trying to return on her own childhood home. Of course later in the movie they are directly attacking the Citadel, but once again it was just Furiosa trying to redeem herself. I only saw the movie once, but did she say anything inheretly bad about Joe, or his societal structure?  You also have your defintions mixed up a bit, the protagonist doesn't have to be 'good' and the antagonist doesn't have to be 'bad'. The protag is simply who the story focuses on (Furiosa), whether they are good, bad, or neither."
MadMax,380xmr,dizzykitty,1 point,Mon Jun 1 02:44:58 2015 UTC,"The term protagonist has two definitions, the one you provided, and someone trying to achieve a goal, it's really confusing because   alot of times the single term directly contradicts itself. I had a film teacher who would analyze films according to who is trying to do something, and who is trying to stop them from doing something, and when you use the term that way just about every movie (particularly disney movies) has the villian defined as the protagonist, because usually they're the only ones with a defined goal other then ""Stop them"""

MadMax,380xmr,heroicintent,3,Mon Jun 1 04:57:50 2015 UTC,"Also, while he may not kill any of his soldiers personally due to anger, the mythos he created glorifies an ""honorable"" suicide. The only time he is shown to be visibly upset or distraught is when his baby boy who was ""perfect in every way"" died. The only way, in my opinion, that he is ""good"" is that he could be a lot worse to his people and soldiers as OP pointed out."

MadMax,37x6u5,elsiniestro,3,Sun May 31 13:45:56 2015 UTC,It's an iconoclastic film that is extremely popular (at least in the the academic aspect of film). It would be hard to find a 101 or 102 level film class that doesn't include discussion/study of Metropolis

MadMax,37x6u5,Osmodius,7,Sun May 31 12:40:02 2015 UTC,"Seems to me that this is a major failing of Rotten Tomatoes. Fury Road has been tagged as Action/Adventure, so it's raw score is compared to all other movies with the same genre tag, regardless of how well it compares in that genre. This shows up especially in the Horror section, where Fury Road is also #2, yet whilst it's a fantastic Action movie, I think it's a pretty poor horror. Certainly doesn't deserve to be the #2 horror movie"

MadMax,37x6u5,YouOnlyLiveOnceMaybe,9,Sun May 31 15:51:49 2015 UTC,Mad Max trumps a lot of classics right there.
MadMax,37x6u5,VikingSlayer,4,Sun May 31 16:15:26 2015 UTC,"I'd say Fury Road is definitely the modern day ""King Kong"", ""Wizard of Oz"", ""Star Wars"", or ""Jurassic Park"" spectacle.  It's big like those, but it's got cinematography work as good as Citizen Kane which made the whole concept really relevant in the first place.  The score fits well with the action. The story isn't convoluted, but it has depth and character development. It shows more than it tells, and it's one of the greatest films ever made.  The only people who would dismiss it are art-film snobs who think action movies are beneath them. People who don't have a taste for it, harshly criticizing something that has no real flaws."

They all fall apart upon closer examination.  Yes, the resources of the wasteland are scarce and there's probably not enough to support everyone. But how does that excuse Joe's wasteful expenditure of resources?  Yes, he is giving the War Boys something to believe in so their lives aren't so bleak. Except he wasn't doing it to make the War Boys happy, he was doing it so the War Boys would be more willing to fight and die for him.  Maybe the Milk Mothers were treated well. But just because slaves aren't beaten and tortured doesn't make slavery right or necessary.  And what does Joe's child dying or him having a diverse harem have to do with anything? They're just non-sequitur meant to distract people from the weakness of the argument."

I can see Capable getting into working with the War Boyz, especially once whatever Boyz survived the last battle make their way back to the citadel and discover it's under new management. Her story of Nux might help her connect to them and get working on rebuilding the Citadel's defense forces, which is going to be priority number 1. Eventually I'd send her to Gas Town to keep it out of the hands of the raiders.   Toast is inclined to weaponry and mechanics, so she's probably going to start working with the engineers. I'd send her to run the Bullet Farm when she's ready.   The Dag is going to get into agriculture, medicine, and spirituality. She'll replace the Organic Mechanic and use the Vuvalini's knowledge to improve the quality of care the citadel residents receive. She's also going to go about repairing the spiritual damage done by a religion devoted entirely to Joe.   Cheedo is the youngest, but she was cunning enough to realize her innocent face was the most useful weapon she had. Give her some training in politics and see if she takes to it.

And if you think women just bicker with each-other all the time, clearly you don't know very many women, especially closely bonded women who've just gone through hell together. Nothing gels a group like that. Being able to trust each-other unconditionally is going to be extremely important as they solidify their control of the citadel."

If the water is good for crops, it's probably good for people. And he allowed his wives to have a steady supply of it in their vault. Water buried ""deep in the earth"" has a good chance of surviving radioactive fallout. Bar some Word of God, I'll keep assuming the water is safe to drink and the illness comes from some other source.    I didn't feel like the women were particularly united, atleast one of them was ready to jump ship   Immediately after the death of one of her sister wives. What is THAT grief if not an expression of a strong bond. In her grief she was willing to throw herself on his mercy rather then watch anyone else die. And she was talked out of it by her two sisters, who reminded her why they were running and that Angharad's death would be meaningless if they didn't keep fighting for what she'd fought for. What was that if not an expression of a strong bond?  The Wives react as a team to everything around them. Together they subdued Nux, together they tried to help Furiosa fight Max, together they helped Furiosa kill Joe at the end of the last battle. She wouldn't have succeeded without them there to intervene at key moments (especially Cheedo and Toast). They are as closely bonded as any group has ever been.   besides furiosa they don't have any experience in leadership   Furiosa is an Imperator, which is clearly a position of high authority in the citadel. Her War Boys called her ""Boss,""  and respected her right to change their orders without a single word of explanation. Immortan Joe said ""Once Again I solute my Imperator Furiosa"" meaning this isn't the first mission she's led. So she's got experience. Heck, even Max couldn't have turned them around on the Salt Flats if she had decided his plan of retaking the citadel was suicide.    an aversion towards violence which isn't a very useful quality in a leader in the crazy world of madmax   No one in the movie has an aversion to violence. The Wives, especially Angharad, have an aversion to unnecessary violence. Being opposed to killing when you don't have to, and wanting to live someplace where killing won't be necessary, is far from being against all killing ever. Hell, after Furiosa is stabbed, the Keeper of the Seeds stabs her attacker in the eye with a bullet and Cheedo (CHEEDO!) kicks him under the rig's wheels. These girls are perfectly ok with violence against people who were violent first.    For example furious risked these women's lives and didn't even know for sure if the place they were going still existed   These women begged her to do it, they knew the risks, and they decided the chance of being killed on the run was better then being Joe's sex slaves any longer. Furiosa had no reason to think her ""green place"" wasn't still there. Her memories of it are still as strong as they ever were.    Then her followup plan was to ride out into the dessert into certain death.   It wasn't certain death, it was unknown hope, which is what Max points out when he tells her, ""hope is a mistake."" Her desire to find something new, her hope and faith that just beyond the horizon there will be a new green place where everyone can rebuild... that would have been what killed them out in the salts. It's not poor leadership, it's foolish hope. Max's alternate idea is to go back to the citadel and take it for themselves... and THAT is the crazy idea. They are one Imperator, one half-dead War Boy, one Blood Bag, a handful of coddled breeders, a few elderly clanswomen, and that's it. And they are going to face down an armada.   Furiosa is talked into it because she realizes that, yah, they'll probably die, but if they happen to survive then they'll certainly have everything they need to rebuild. This is better then the salt, where they have no idea what they will find and they'll probably die anyway. They risk everything on a Hail Mary pass because they have nothing else to loose. It's not an easy call to make, but she made it.  And it was HER call, not Max's. It was his idea, but she made the choice to do it. From the beginning to the end of the movie, she's been the leader of this group. At first she shared that with Angharad, but Angharad died, and the group kept moving."
MadMax,37ymps,IdiotsLantern,0,Mon Jun 1 01:48:34 2015 UTC,"On the water I'll concede your most likely right, the water is probably potable. Im not sure the water is limitless, but controlling and rationung resources for the greater good is central to jumpstarting a new civilisation. Even if immorten joe is hoarding water to maintain power, hes got to have some way to control and anarchaic lawless group of violent nomads long enough for a structure to form, if he needs to hoard water to do it then i think it could very well be for the greater good. I think the girl almost giving up and heading back shows a lack of commitment. Certainly if you had a parallel group who were stalwart the whole way with no lapses of faith we would both recognize that the second group is undoubtedly more united commited. Also not that it wasnt until one of their own died that the wife had her moment of doubt. This after dozens if not hundreds of warboys died as a result of their decision. And besides even if I did feel they were completely united what does that prove about them as leaders? There are cases of girls being kept in basement dungeons and banding together to survive, I still wouldn't elect them to be joint mayors of cincinatti.  On violence, yes the wives killed to secure their own freedom, and you're right they were against unnecessary killing not killing in any sense. But I still get the impression that in this world with the amount of people that immorten joe was keeping alive, if you make a peaceful utopia it's gonna be flooded with people quickly. If that happens resources are going to become more scarce and violence/raoding might be necessary in order to sustain such a rapid influx. If thats the case I'm not sure they would have the stomach for it. And if they do then the difference between them and joe is just a question of degrees and in that case there goes your moral arguement, and in that scenario I'd go with the raider I know, immorten joe, instead of a bunch of rookies (besides furiosa)  I don't think you really addressed my point about furiosa's poor decision making. Nothing in the movie tells me that she couldn't have made sure the green place was there before risking everyone's life. Certainly if she had put some effort in she could find out about a green oasis a days drive from the citadel, i doubt itd be impossible especially for a high ranking imperator, but whatevs. Also just because the green place exists vividly in her memory doesn't mean it exists in real life. I remember circuit city but I wouldn't go looking for one without googling that shit.  You act like having foolish hope isn't a bad quality for a leader. Clearly it is, and particularly if the risk entails everyone trusting you to lead them dying in the desert. The fact she changes her mind when faced with facts only shows she's not completely inept but it doesn't prove much else. Like you said it's what do you have to lose. She put them in a desperate situation and they made a desperate choice.   In conclusion, if you value unity, commitment and want humanities best shot at survival you AR in much better shape under immortan joe. If you want a disjointed learn on the fly co-op that will be overrun in a month go with furiosa."
MadMax,37ymps,DallasBass,1 point,Mon Jun 1 03:55:59 2015 UTC,"if he needs to hoard water to do it then i think it could very well be for the greater good.    It's funny how often ""the greater good"" is used to justify all kinds of terrible things. The only structure Joe's built with all of his resources is all about empowering and glorifying and deifying himself. He has everything he needs, and instead he plays dress-up while deifying himself.     I think the girl almost giving up and heading back shows a lack of commitment.   It shows a moment of doubt. These are humans, not robots, and relatively coddled humans at that. I'd have been shocked if the gruesome death of one of their own HADN'T caused some doubts.  And again, the girl turns herself around and heads back into the cab. She never wavers again. In fact, she's the one who notices the injured Furiosa is having a hard time climbing the Gigahorse and has Rictus lift her aboard so she can help her, making her instrumental in killing Joe in the end. That is a united, committed group.   This after dozens if not hundreds of warboys died as a result of their decision.   Like I said, they aren't against violence when it's necessary. They spare people when they can, like when they saved Nux from Furiosa. Joe saw one of his boys take a bullet for him right in front of his face, and didn't even blink. After all, he raised them to die for him. It's to be expected.   Contrast this with Furiosa visibly shaken by the death of Angharad, and later when she throws herself on Cheedo to save her from the now-blind Bullet Farmer. She screams when the pole cat grabs Toast. Furiosa values her allies. To Joe you are nothing except what you can do for him. I know who I'd trust more in a dangerous situation...    There are cases of girls being kept in basement dungeons    Did you see all those books in the Wives dungeon? Books are rarer then gold in the Wasteland, but these women had them, and writing desks, and a whiteboard covered with maths and star charts and who knows what else. They were educated. Plus they have the Vuvolini with them now, and all their wide-reaching experience and knowledge. It's not a guarentee of their fitness, but it's not a bad foundation to work with.    if you make a peaceful utopia it's gonna be flooded with people quickly.If that happens resources are going to become more scarce and violence/raiding might be necessary in order to sustain such a rapid influx. If thats the case I'm not sure they would have the stomach for it.   No one said it was going to be easy. And Furiosa especially has clearly done terrible things while fighting her way up the ranks (hence her need for ""redemption."") At least I believe Furiosa would WANT to save as many people as possible, which is more then I think Joe ever did. And she's got even more reasons to fight for the Citadel. Some difficult choices are ahead, undoubtably, but at least she has some agenda beyond making herself a deity and producing a healthy heir, which is more then you can say for Joe.    is just a question of degrees and in that case there goes your moral arguement   I don't know, those degrees can be pretty important. It's a long way between total lawlessness and KNEEL BEFORE ZOD!    Nothing in the movie tells me that she couldn't have made sure the green place was there before risking everyone's life.   Again, it never occurred to her that it wouldn't be. Not a good trait, true, but the thought that if she just survived long enough, someday she could go home is probably why she fought so hard to survive in Joe's citadel. If it's not there, she doesn't want to know. Maybe not a great trait, but show me anyone who's totally objective where matters of this much personal importance are concerned. She's only got one childhood home to loose and she lost it. It hit her hard.   Tell the truth though, the knowledge that the Green Place wasn't there anymore wouldn't really change anything for anyone. The Wives still want to escape from Joe.   Basically I believe Furiosa genuinely cares about the people who follow her. Joe cared only about Joe. For this reason alone, I'll call whatever she manages to do an improvement over a brutal totalitarian dictator with a bunch of brainwashed boy soldiers and a vault of sex slaves who lets his own people go thirsty when it suits him."
MadMax,37ymps,IdiotsLantern,1 point,Mon Jun 1 08:16:41 2015 UTC,"Just know you're dragging a good man's name through the dirt here. Immortan Joe does deify himself and let's assume he does hoard the water to maintain power. I will explain again why this is forgivable and this time I hope you consider it and acknowledge it if you choose to respond. The wasteland is full of insane desperate people who eak out an existence by raiding and exploiting one another for dwindling resources. It's chaos. Add to that there's a disease that cuts the populations life span in half, so just stop and think about how crazy that would be. Young guys know I ng they're on the verge of death with nothing to lose out there killing and pillaging day in day out. One of the first things you would want to do is get them under control not just for the safety of everyone in the wasteland but if you intend to accrue resources they would never be safe with the war boys out there raiding your stuff. So how does Joe do it? Instead of brutalizing or slaughtering them or imprisoning them he inspires them with a purpose and a new religion. He gives them hope. And he unites them, you want to talk unity look at the religious fervor he inspires in the war boys. Even in the least devout warboys nux who eventually turns, he doesn't do so before willingly sacrificing himself twice. So if unity and devotion to a cause is a sign of anything positive then the war boys definitley got the wives beat there. Just look at the historically unruly step people in and around mongolia. It wasn't until genesis Kahn jump started a society after years of lawlessness that they entered the world stage. And genesis Kahn was much more brutal than good ole immorten joe. Besides with every new war boy he inspires immorten joe also takes on the responsibility of feeding housing and providing for an extra mouth in one of the most brutal landscape in modern cinema. Whatever alchemy he's got to do with resources with manipulation of the war boys is a very small price to pay for that very tough first step between complete lawlessness and early government, certainly if that's the extent of immortan Joe's methods for maintaining power he'd be head and shoulders above most leaders of upstart civilisations.   On the rest of your points which read to me like just excuses for the shortcomings of the wives I'm thoroughly unconvinced. Yes the wife had doubts and that makes her human. But so what, the world of mad max is in shambles because of human instincts played out to their most base level. Certainly a leader more free of those human instincts would be an improvement. In fact it's immorten Joe's humanity that's his downfall. Had he just let the wives go he would still be alive and his war boys would be safe, the wives and furiosa happily riding motorcycles to death on the salt flats. But joe had a warped and admittedly twisted affection for his wives and they were his downfall. Also just because immorten joe doesn't fall apart when one of his war boys dies in an ongoing battle doesn't make him any less of a leader. Furiosa being emotional over someone's death doesn't help anyone, and certainly had joe pulled over and mourned the war boy it wouldn't have done himself or the other warboys any good. In fact it's immorten Joe's emotion and humanity not his cold calculating nature that makes him a less than ideal ruler. More humanity is not the answer. Just imagine if immorten joe loved every war boy with the fervor and intensity with which he cared for his wives. Would he send battalion after battalion any time one of them was hurt, risking valuable resources and warboys in the process. That's no good for anybody.   On the wives being educated, I doubt immorten joe had the wives educated in any kind of political science or governance. Yes they can read star maps and do botany but we're still very far from them being capable of providing for a large group of desperate sick people. Again if these girls were running for mayor of cincinatti you wouldn't vote for them and reassure yourself with, we'll they had a lot of books in there. Sure you probably wouldn't vote for immorten joe either but at least he'd make the buses run on time. Again it's inexcusable that furiosa didn't check the green place was there before heading out there, no matter how you slice it. It's just terrible leadership. And yes actually knowing that the green place wasn't there would have affected things greatly, perhaps the plan would have changed to a coup instead of an escape or she could have tracked down a better location, certainly anything would have been better then ""well let's just ride out into the salt flats and hope for the best""  I don't buy that furiosa cares for her people any more than immorten joe does. She killed enough of them that I think she gave up the right to distinguish herself from joe in any significant sense. Nux is convinced to risk his life for them just as he did for immorten joe earlier, he follows them just as blindly. They use him as carelessly as immorten joe used him. He does this of his own accord of course he's not forced into it, but joe doesn't force him either. In fact he is totally thrilled at the prospect of sacrificing his life if it would help immorten joe in any way. So if furiosa and the wives lead how are they going to inspire this level of devotion from the war boys? With kisses on the forehead?  Because if there is any error here then youll have hundreds of lunatics tearing apart and looting the citadel so it's not exactly the time to be experimenting with new utopian approaches to governement. And why release the water when they arrive at the city if not as a gift to the people for embracing the new furiosa wives government. Isnt this the same thing joe was doing? Using the water to control the population? Do you think theyll just run that aquifer all night and turn that healthy safe underground water into a toxic above ground river? Just imagine it, all that good water flowing through the citadel with sick war boys dipping their hands covered in boils and wounds polluting the water. Disease sky rocketing. Or will the wives turn it off and on the way immorten joe was doing it? If so were back at the same place. And you havent proven that joe hoarded the water with any kind of malice. And on your last point, so anything furiosa does will be better because of her intentions huh? That's absurd, there's many people who are good people that would make terrible rulers, I don't agree that furiosa is a good person btw, I don't think crying over your dead is any sign of anything, terrorists thugs and nazis all lamented their dead, also immorten joe gets just as emotional over his wife's death as anyone else so again this proves nothing. And keep in mind that her idealistic noble gang she comes from is one that survives by repeatedly pulling off this nasty trick: tricking people into stopping to help a distressed woman and sniping them from a sand dune. That's the green place for you, a place where the wives can murder passerbys and steal their shit. Furiosa says herself I've seen this before so this practice isn't something they picked up after the green place went bad, it's something they've always done. In that light manipulating the war boys and controlling the water doesn't seem that bad to me, especially if the woman tribe is presented as the highest point of the moral spectrum."
MadMax,37ymps,DallasBass,1 point,Mon Jun 1 18:34:15 2015 UTC,"Just know you're dragging a good man's name through the dirt here.   Given the lack of exposition we are given, we can only judge people through their actions and the way the other characters react to them. The very same people begging for water at the Immortan's feet gleefully tore his corpse apart. His wives (who probably spent more time with him and knew him better then anyone else did) spat on him and the chastity belts he forced them to wear. They were willing to risk death and torture rather then remain with him and let him raise their children. Furiosa called him, ""a very bad man."" And absolutely no one, not even Nux, is sad to see him die.   YOU call him a ""Good Man?""    And he unites them, you want to talk unity look at the religious fervor he inspires in the war boys.   And look at the lack of reaction those very same boys (or Nux at least) had to his death. Look at how willingly his own people defiled his corpse. His own War Pups lifted the woman who murdered him up into his castle. The only one who seems at all emotional is his son Colossus, and even Colossus seems more concerned about his position in the Citadel then the fact his father is dead.    the world of mad max is in shambles because of human instincts played out to their most base level.   Actually, when the wives ask, ""who killed the world,"" the movie answers that it was men like Joe who killed the world, men who mistook increasing their own power and protecting their own interests with bettering the state of their people as a whole. Men who believed that only they could run the world, so everything they did was justified. Look at politicians today, and you'll see the same exact reasoning. ""Why can't you vote for gun control, considering you know it's right?"" ""Because it'd kill my political career."" Doing the right thing isn't right if it could cost the Powerful anything power at all. That's not being into power as a way to help your people. That's being into power for it's own sake.    Certainly a leader more free of those human instincts would be an improvement.   You want a robot ruling you? The DICTATORTRON 2000? I can't see that going well...    joe had a warped and admittedly twisted affection for his wives and they were his downfall.   His affection for his wives was similar to the affection someone would have for their fine house, or their fancy car, or some other shiney display of their own awesomeness. Hell, he calls Splendid's child ""MY PROPERTY"" TO HER FACE. While she uses her pregnant body to shield Furiosa. These women are his valuable breeders, the mothers of that perfect son, and when Splendid lies dying, the only emotion Joe can muster is rage that she took his child with her, robbing him of that son he really, really wanted. She was never more then a baby machine to him. A valuable one, but HER death didn't worry him. Once he knew she couldn't be saved, he discarded her, murdering her. It wasn't compassion, it was a stoploss measure.   Also, remember that Furiosa had to know Max SAW Angharad go under the wheels before she insisted they keep moving. The implication is he hadn't seen it, if there was a chance she'd somehow survived the fall, they would have gone back for her.    Also just because immorten joe doesn't fall apart when one of his war boys dies in an ongoing battle doesn't make him any less of a leader.   But it makes him less of a human, and I wouldn't trust a leader who's not human to have any compassion at all for his people. A leader is supposed to sacrifice for the sake of his people, not demand that they sacrifice for him. In words of Tyrion Lannister, it's ok to be terrible, if you are the kind of terrible that keeps your people from being more terrible. The War Boyz are exactly as terrible as the Immortan forces them to be. That they have any humanity and compassion left in them at all is more a testament to the strength of the human spirit then evidence of any good leadership on his part.   I doubt immorten joe had the wives educated in any kind of political science or governance.   I doubt he trained them at all. I think that was Miss Gitty's job. And I think SHE taught them everything she knew about everything. They had walls lined with books in that vault, as well as writing desks and reading lamps for late night studying. They were literally locked in an ivory tower with nothing to do except learn. You can doubt all you want, but I'd be surprised if there was a single book that at least one of them hadn't read, and what are the odds at least one of them was about politics?    Again if these girls were running for mayor of cincinatti you wouldn't vote for them and reassure yourself with, we'll they had a lot of books in there. I'd still call them an improvement over the OLD mayor of Cincinatti, who locked them in that basement in the first place while he turned off my water, branded my neck and demanded I worship him like a god.   at least he'd make the buses run on time.   When it suited him. I'd have to ask him very nicely first, and maybe do some groveling, lick his boots a little bit, and maybe if he was feeling especially charitable, MAYBE, he'd find it in the goodness of his soul to let me ride that bus.    Again it's inexcusable that furiosa didn't check the green place was there before heading out there, no matter how you slice it.   But it's understandable. She wanted it so badly to be real. She's a human being, and she cares about people, which is more then Joe ever did.    Nux is convinced to risk his life for them just as he did for immorten joe earlier, he follows them just as blindly.   He follows HER, Capable, because she's beautiful and kind and she comforted him when he feels like crap. She leads him with love, caring glances, a look that says ""come back safe."" It's cheesy to say, but his crush on her is why he's content to follow her around. He's looking for something to die for.    She killed enough of them that I think she gave up the right to distinguish herself from joe in any significant sense. If you are calling the War Boyz ""her people"" then Joe is also killing his own when he attempts to have her murdered. She betrays him, the Boyz are loyal to him, she fights the Boyz. She still puts herself in danger repeatedly to save the Wives, and Max, and even Nux towards the end of the movie. I can't see Joe throwing his body between Cheedo and a barrage of bullets, and he was using Toast as a shield against Max and Furiosa's bullets. When she stopped him from killing Furiosa, he punched her in the mouth so hard it knocked out a tooth.  He does this of his own accord of course he's not forced into it, but joe doesn't force him either.   Joe filled his head from early childhood with stories of Valhalla and promises that if he died a certain way, he'd live forever in a shiney perfect afterlife. The worst thing Nux did was believe it. Even at the end, I'm not sure he's stopped believing in Valhalla, but he has stopped believing that dying for Joe is the way to get there. Instead he chooses to die for the girl he loves. She witnesses his sacrifice and he goes out with a smile on his face, his goal finally accomplished.  Capable is far from unmoved by this. In fact she's pretty crushed. The other two wives have to support her. Nux wasn't a disposable pawn to them, he was a person and his loss is a loss.    So if furiosa and the wives lead how are they going to inspire this level of devotion from the war boys? With kisses on the forehead?    No. With kindness. Like you said, the Half Lives are basically born to die, heck, most of them probably don't even make it to puberty. But instead of promising that if they sacrifice themselves then they'll live forever and that's their only goal in life, promise them that their deaths in the service of protecting their home will be forever remembered by their brothers and sisters, and in Valhalla all the friends they've lost will be there.   As a wise man once said, ""the country doesn't need martyrs. It needs heroes. A hero is willing to die for his country ... but would rather live for it.""   No, it won't be easy. Nothing ever is. It's a start.    And why release the water when they arrive at the city if not as a gift to the people for embracing the new furiosa wives government.    It wasn't Furiosa or the Wives who turned on the water, it was the Milk Mothers who did it in celebration of the Immortan's death. Because it's always been the people's water.    Do you think theyll just run that aquifer all night and turn that healthy safe underground water into a toxic above ground river? Just imagine it, all that good water flowing through the citadel with sick war boys dipping their hands covered in boils and wounds polluting the water. Disease sky rocketing.    This sounds less like a political problem and more like an engineering problem. Joe let the water just fall in the poisoned dirt and the people scoop it up as best they can. THAT wasn't a great system either. Better get whoever designed those water pumps to work figuring out some sort of distribution  that is fair.   That's the green place for you, a place where the wives can murder passerbys and steal their shit.   That tribe did what they had to do to survive after all their crops died. Now they have a place were, hopefully, they won't have to anymore. The problems of the Citadel are plentiful, but there's at least a hope, now, that things will improve.  Joe saw no reason for things to improve. Joe had everything he wanted. No one else mattered. Now at least the people are free."
MadMax,37ymps,IdiotsLantern,1 point,Wed Jun 3 01:53:37 2015 UTC,"I was under the impression that the people tore him apart because they believed he was immortal and seeing him dead instantly disproved that so they desended back into godless heathens. To me this scene makes it even more clear that these people are pretty brutal themselves and wouldn't make a good fit for an egalitarian society where you depend on people to be good to eachother. Im being facetious when I say he's a good man, but in the context of mad max he's relatively good. Certainly if you use Furiosa's tribe of murderous theiving women as a barometer of good Immorten Joe isn't too far off.  I admit that the movies making the point that guys like immorten joe destroyed the world, but they also built it, all early societies were brutal societies and totalitarian states. Run by despots.  And yes they can eventually transition to more egalitarian societies. It takes generations. If you don't think so try to get a socialist elected today to a major office to share resources differently. It's pretty difficult and we're still far from the world of Madmax. The question is, is this society at the citadel ready for that? To make a leap from totaly despotism to whatever coop idealic society the mothers want to set up? I dont think so. The world is too brutal, the war pups are too brutal, the people are easily swayed to whoever has the resources and without immorten joe i think the citadel is a lot more volitile then your letting on. And if someone were to be able to make this huge leap forward it would take an incredibly inspirational figure, I dont think itd be furiosa and the wives. They seemed to have made all major decisions in the film out of desperation and without a lot of planning. Obviously it was a dramatic situation so I cant fault them too much but by the same token you cant ascribe too much to those decisions either. You already know I dont think Furiosa was a good leader, and the wives are totally unproven as well. I'm not saying Immorten Joe is perfect but there were positives to the way he ran the citadel. I dont think the wives have enough of those positives and the other stuff they bring to the table doesnt seem to be as valuable in the wasteland. It takes a specific type of person to be ruled by kindness and the war boys are pretty far from that particular kind of person. It'd be like asking a group of sheltered college aged women to run a high security prison where all the inmates are freely walking around, have access to weapons and you have all the resources they want, not to mention their conditioned to raid, kill and steal. The only thing uniting them is dead. Thats more than just not easy, thats a powder keg. Also your wrong about the trap the women's tribe would do, it wasnt that they did what they needed to after the crops died, they were doing it back when furiosa was around back when the green place was very much green and thriving. Furiosa says that scene of the naked woman crying, the trap was familiar to her, so they were clearly doing that same thin way back then, when the green place was registering as the shining hope that would drive furiosa years later.    Im not sure why but it seems like everything Joe does is self serving to you and everything the other characters do is a necessary evil. Youre not giving Immorten Joe  a fair shake. Why wouldnt Joe want things to improve for him and his people? Surely a population of healthy war boys is better than sick ones. Certainly a satisfied population could be easier to rule. Joe had a functioning economy, a healthy protein source in his milk, gardening, a water source, the citadel was safe under his control. I dont see any indication that Joe lacked ambition or would have stopped socities progress if he could help it. Yeah he wants to benefit as well but so does literally every other character in the film. Max doesnt help the refinery people in road warrior for any other reason then to get gas until the end. The mothers have to give up their milk but they also dont have to scrounge around for food, theyre safe etc. It seems to me like everyone had a trade off. The sick people of the citadel certainly dont seem like they have anything to offer Joe but theyre allowed to live there and given water and I assume fed. For what? some new currency or something? Just their devotion? The war boys were doing all the work and their devotion comes freely because theyre ""brainwashed"" so its not like he needs citadel people for labor for anything. The war boys have to protect Immortan Joes fleet on the fury road so trade can happen between the three hubs of industry in exchange theyre fed, housed, got some make shift healthcare and the hope of being promoted, brain washed or not they seemed very motivated so whats the problem? And whats the alternative? Do some of the same things or probably much worse for less by yourself out in the wastland? War boys got it pretty good considering. The only people that I could tell were treated unfairly were the wives. They were slaves and obviously they didn't like it (huge understatement i know) and certainly I'd understand if someone thought that thats enough to make immortan joe a scumbag and outweigh everything else hes accomplished. But to take the next step and say that therefore the wives and furiosa will be better functioning leaders and that the people of the citadel are better off I completely disagree."

I think it would be safe to assume many of his pillars of government will remain, only augmented toward a more eh ""morally good"" version.   That's how fledgling nations work. Regimes  change and evolve until they eventually stabilize.   edit: I am not saying Joe was right, I am saying he actually thought he was solving the worlds current problems. The breeding program would not only give him a healthy heir, it would solve the half life problem children faced.  He was an egotistical maniac, but he believed he was doing good, and relatively, in a post apocalyptic way he was."

MadMax,37x4fo,transemacabre,2,Sun May 31 04:50:40 2015 UTC,Oh what a cool idea.
MadMax,37x4fo,transemacabre,6,Sun May 31 04:52:25 2015 UTC,"It neatly explains why the timeline is so wonky, why the same actors appear playing different characters, why Max himself sometimes looks like Mel Gibson and sometimes like Tom Hardy. All things and all times coexist in the Dreamtime. It's at once a physical place and also a supernatural place. Also, I like how utterly Australian the Dreamtime is."
MadMax,37x4fo,Zenarchist,8,Sun May 31 05:48:47 2015 UTC,"Nah, petrol is useful and valuable, but it's not really the most valuable. There are whole towns and regions dedicated to pumping has, same as there are whole towns dedicated to making arms and ammo.  If you have lots of petrol, but no water, water is far more valuable than petrol. For Immortan Joe, who had enough petrol, arms, and water, the only thing of value to him was a reasonable heir. Just look at the length he was willing to go to to retrieve his breeding wives.  The efficiency of the engines is a non-point. You don't know what kind of engines they are using, and you don't know what kind of fuel (hi-octane!) They were using. It's also been completely irrelevant to the story so far.  There are plenty of theories about where this film sits in the Rockatansky Saga, but I truly don't think it matters. Max could be the feral kid, Max could be the Gibson Max, Max could be a new character that has taken on the Max name, or he could be a myth, a legends, and these are all just tales in his mythos.  Miller has said that he doesn't know when in the timeline this (or any of the other films) sit, and it really doesn't matter."
MadMax,37x4fo,EasyGh0st,6,Sun May 31 10:16:28 2015 UTC,"George Miller said in an interview that in his head this film is sometime after Beyond Thunderdome and around 40/50 years after the apocalypse. He doesn't worry about a timeline he just wants to make the best film he can. I think this leans it's self to the theory that apart from the first film these films are someone else's perspective of events, when the legendary Road Warrior (that might not even be the same man, they just assume it's him) turned up helped them and left.  The feral kid in road warrior, the tribe of kids in Thunderdome and Furiosa in fury road. That's why the worlds are so different they're telling the story back the way they remember it, the same way the film 300 is set up. One survivor is telling an embellished version of the battle to fire up his men for the up coming battle."
MadMax,37x4fo,LongHorsa,2,Sun May 31 10:21:44 2015 UTC,"It's also Oral Tradition - little is written down anymore (who has time to make paper, also, trees) and so the stories and histories are passed down across generations possibly with a little embellishment along the way."

MadMax,37x4fo,Streetmix,9,Sun May 31 22:38:56 2015 UTC,"I think a theme through the movie is greed. Immortan Joa has enough water for everybody, but instead he hoards it jealously.  I am thinking gasoline is the same thing. There is more than enough to go around, but instead the elite keeps it for themselves and spend it however they see fit."
MadMax,37x4fo,sanamA,9,Sun May 31 04:20:20 2015 UTC,"So, just like society today then?"
MadMax,37x4fo,uponthecityofzephon,16,Sun May 31 04:34:53 2015 UTC,"That's the point they are trying to make. The brides, the warboys, the slaves, they are all just cogs in a machine that resembles a charicature of today's society. The kind of society that treats everyone as an object- The warboys as brainwashed soldiers raised only to die at the pleasure of an unfeeling authority, and the brides, trapped in the same system as sex slaves.  ""We are not objects""."
MadMax,37x4fo,Retlaw83,7,Sun May 31 04:42:03 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Lots of elements in the movie made me think of how countries hoard oil and how ISIS is using oil too. The brides, warboys and slaves also are uncannily similar to what we're seeing now in the Middle East."
MadMax,37x4fo,new_ireland,3,Sun May 31 16:41:54 2015 UTC,"Say Max is in his early forties. The apocalypse happens twenty years ago, so you have an entire society of people that have grown up in the wasteland. Even in they were kids when society fell, Mad Max showed that society was already pretty sketchy beforehand, so its not like people went from palaces to warlords. I imagine it was gradual in some places, like your town starts to fall apart over time because there's no road maintenance or protection provided by the government, so you become more self reliant. Some of those warboys might have been seven or eight when the from the nuclear war happened, and then brought into Joe's army when they were teenagers. It's not like teenagers are too intelligent to bring into a cult in trying times."
MadMax,37x4fo,Left4DayZ1,3,Sun May 31 06:15:01 2015 UTC,"Joe could have also started a survivalist community about the time the original Mad Max happened, and it mutated into that within a generation. He could have seen the shitwinds blowing, and horde useful items and setup the Citadel for self-reliance. It's a lot more fun for me to think of the war boys as Generation Sprog."

MadMax,37x4fo,Zenarchist,3,Mon Jun 1 03:50:32 2015 UTC,"i think it's meant to be a bit of a lampooning about the notion of ""going to war for oil"" but, in the process of going to war, using countless quantities of oil.  Like, we'll go to war to fight over resources, but absolutely waste those resources in order to go to war."
MadMax,37x4fo,-ArthurDent-,5,Mon Jun 1 17:18:06 2015 UTC,"As far as I'm concerned, the film is a soft reboot and this isn't in the same continuity as the old films. As for the use of a massive car armada, or carmada as I like to call it, I think it's because the spaces between settlements are too big to cross on foot without dying of thirst or exhaustion. Also, if one tribe of raiders starts using cars, then the only effective defense for travelers is to use vehicles themselves. Plus, Mad Max runs on rule of cool as much as guzzoline, so the use of badass vehicles is entirely justified :P"
MadMax,37x4fo,skonen_blades,3,Sun May 31 04:08:25 2015 UTC,George Miller has said that he was not making a reboot.
MadMax,37x4fo,The__Ugly,3,Sun May 31 10:07:32 2015 UTC,"Tom Hardy said this about it:  ""We have to take it differently as George is taking it. It’s a relaunch and revisit to the world. An entire restructuring. That’s not to say that it’s not picking up or leaving off from the Mad Max you know already, but it’s a nice re-take on the entire world using the same character, depositing him in the same world but bringing him up to date by 30 years.""  I've heard that George Miller just doesn't like calling it a reboot, and he's probably not wrong, considering the negative connotation with the word these days along with the fact that they haven't changed the fundamental parts of Mad Max (like only using pre-1980s vehicles)."
MadMax,37x4fo,eff1ngham,2,Sun May 31 15:56:43 2015 UTC,I think it wouldn't go this way if it wasn't Immortan Joe's 'wives'.  Any expenditure is worth getting them back.

MadMax,37x4fo,eff1ngham,2,Wed Jun 3 19:33:05 2015 UTC,"There are only a few gigantic gas guzzlers if you really look at the whole fleet.  Most of the cars serve a purpose, only the ""royalty"" vehicles are excessive.  In terms of them being V8s, well ask any mechanic and a 60/70s V8 is one of the easiest engines to work on/modify.  They're making due with what's around and easy to maintain and also fast enough to survive.  In terms of the timeline Fury Road is after Thunderdome, and Max would be in his 50s/60s.  Now you have to account for the fact that people may have lost track of time, but the movie is essentially taking place a year or so after 2030 (Mad Max took place in the year 2000 and Max was allegedly 25)."

MadMax,37wne9,HoustonsSolution,5,Sun May 31 16:30:29 2015 UTC,"While my gut reaction to something like this happening would be to get super excited, I don't know if it would work.  While the world itself is incredibly interesting, said interest mostly comes from what Miller chooses NOT to tell the audience during the movies. He gives just enough background on a character or setting for you to make your own conclusions, but there are very few things he just explicitely says or shows the audience.  Mad Max's appeal, in short; comes from what's implied instead of what's said. The characters and the places we see are so interesting because we get so little information about their actual history that they feel mythical and larger than life.   In order for a TV show to work, they would need to expand and develop these characters to a certain degree; and in turn make them lose what makes them so special.   In fact, they seem to be doing this exact thing with the videogame; and the story is not looking good so far."
MadMax,37wne9,HoustonsSolution,3,Sun May 31 03:38:11 2015 UTC,"Hm these are excellent points. Yeah I'm not too stoked for the story of the game either, but the gameplay looks like it will make up for that- reminds me of red dead redemption but set in the wasteland"
MadMax,37wne9,leonryan,2,Sun May 31 03:52:09 2015 UTC,"I trust Avalanche to make a good game. They are even able to play a little fast and loose because of the fast and loose continuity in the series. According to an article I read, Miller did have some consultation involvement in the game."

MadMax,37wne9,LongHorsa,1 point,Sun May 31 20:42:18 2015 UTC,I think a lot of it was to not completely go against some aspects if the world and Max's characterization. I believe Gastown is a big plot point of the game and they had some notes to go by.
MadMax,37wne9,Dreadnought13,1 point,Sun May 31 21:26:49 2015 UTC,i wouldn't be too fearful that the game is going to spoil too many mysteries.  it seems to be largely populated with random wasteland freaks except for the main villain who is Joe's third son who we didn't meet in the film.  it's predominantly going to be an action game focused on Max's day to day life in the wasteland.  I think it'd be a real shame to deny yourself the experience.

MadMax,37wv5t,corruptigon,9,Sun May 31 01:53:04 2015 UTC,"I think whatever happened to the rest of them. They died when the Green Place died. It seems like the tribe was matriarchal and since most of the survivors were old women I assumed they were the elders of the group, possibly the rest of the younger women and men died to protect them, or were captured. I never got the impression they were only women, just the ones who were left."
MadMax,37wv5t,denimgremlin,5,Sun May 31 02:07:33 2015 UTC,"according to the comic the warboys seem to be sourced from the crowd of poor people at the base of the citadel, and their fathers are forced into gladiatorial combat.  perhaps some of the remaining mothers and daughters fled to establish their own home in the green place when furiosa was a child, meaning they never had any men in the first place and unless some of them fled already pregnant they never had any sons either.  there's nobody younger than furiosa in the tribe after all.  Nux's mother could have been among them."
MadMax,37wv5t,leonryan,5,Sun May 31 03:00:02 2015 UTC,"The Vuvalini were once a large and healthy clan, so odds are very much for them having men amoung their number, and probably plenty of them.   They probably died off from just about anything. Maybe they died failing to repel raids like the one that took Furiosa. Maybe they were killed by scavangers, or buzzards, or captured by raiders looking for slaves and blood, or took off looking for a new ""green place"" and never came back. Whatever happened, the older women (and one not-so-old) are the only ones left now.   The implication is the Vuvalini are wary about men because just about every man they've met in the Wasteland has tried to kill or hurt or rob them. There's no implication that they ever killed or even mistrusted their own sons and brothers."
MadMax,37wv5t,IdiotsLantern,6,Sun May 31 08:05:14 2015 UTC,"We know that Max was old enough to be a cop when society fell, so I'd say there hasn't been more than one generation that grew up in the wasteland. I figured that there were no men, maybe just a group of women and their children with no plans to have their own, perpetuating isolated society."

MadMax,37wl9i,civil_blight,9,Sun May 31 00:22:11 2015 UTC,"half life is a term used to describe the persistence of radiation, so i would suggest the warboys have a radiation sickness which shortens their lives rather than an unspecified congenital sickness."
MadMax,37wl9i,leonryan,3,Sun May 31 02:53:30 2015 UTC,"The religion of the Warboys and going to Valhalla to live again is likely borne out of their own short real lives, it's not only an effective coping mechanism for people whose lives are destined to be short painful difficult affairs and partly a powerful weapon Immortan Joe has shaped so as to easier control them.  Essentially it's both"
MadMax,37wl9i,GAdvance,3,Sun May 31 00:47:34 2015 UTC,"I think Nux or another Way Boy calls Max a ""full-life"" right before they use him as a hood ornament, so I believe the term just refers to people affected by radiation and their shortened lifespan."
MadMax,37wl9i,CurtBaboon,3,Sun May 31 03:27:37 2015 UTC,"I didn't catch it personally, but the ""full-life"" thing seems to suggest that it's simply the lifespan.

MadMax,37v9ph,IdiotsLantern,6,Sat May 30 18:12:08 2015 UTC,"According to the prequel comic, the War Boys are actually recruited from the masses surrounding the Citadel. Whenever Immortan Joe lowers a platform to send out his War Boys, the surrounding people try to give up their children in the hopes that they'll have a better life inside the Citadel. Joe's men take the healthiest looking kids. The boys become War Boys and the girls become Milk Mothers. Apparently, there's also a deleted scene that shows this."
MadMax,37v9ph,KingofMadCows,0,Sat May 30 20:32:37 2015 UTC,"I'll take it, but I'd call it a very unreliable way to procure the next generation. You'd have no control over the size of your supply of children. Plus the people we saw look too old and sick to be doing very much breeding. Joe goes through a lot of War Boyz every time the rig is sent out and as miserable as life in the caves of the Citadel looked, you can't call the place ""sparsely populated."" There's a heck of a lot of people in there.   You'd be unable to control their age or training: like an infant girl who is healthy will have to consume over a decade and a half of resources before she's going to get to earn her keep as a milk mother. (I doubt there are female War Pups). Likewise a boy who is healthy might be almost at puberty and too old to be properly trained and brainwashed into wanting to give up his life for a self-styled god. And I can't see Joe allowing that.   Overall, it's a lot better to breed your battle fodder yourself, and then control every aspect of their lives: their training, their lessons, and eventually their promotions up the ranks."
MadMax,37v9ph,eff1ngham,7,Sat May 30 23:13:53 2015 UTC,"There's a few points I have a different opinion on.  The ""half life"" they refer to is the fact that the war boys believe when they die, they'll be born again in Valhalla.  That's why they're so willing to die in battle (first 1/2 of their life) because they think they'll be riding immortal in the afterlife (2/2 half of their life).  It's not referring to the fact that they're sick.  Some obviously are, but some of the other war boys look quite healthy (Morsov looks like he's in great shape for example, and other than the grotesque scar, Slit seems to be fairly healthy).  Also, the war boys shave their heads/eyebrows, etc and put on their war paint to look a certain way, they're not actually albino kids with no hair.  Now I'm not biologist, but I think the Milk Mothers are just kept there constantly pumping out breast milk.  They're not constantly breeding new children though.  They are hooked up to breast pumps and kept well fed/nourished to continue to produce milk.  It's certainly possible that some of them were Breeders previously, but IMO they were just women who either had kids and were healthy enough to produce milk, or were given hormones to help them produce (the organic mechanic seems to have a pretty decent knowledge of biology/anatomy).  I believe the war boys (grown up war pups) are just the healthiest males from the citadel population.  Whenever the ramps are lowered you can see the population trying to climb aboard, begging to be taken above the ground level.  And the machines are manually run by people from the population.  It seems to me that the war pups are chosen by Joe's men as the healthiest looking, and brought up to become war boys after running the machines for a while and displaying enough physical skill to ""do war.""  Lastly, my guess as to why where are no war girls other than Furiosa: Joe doesn't want any of the female population to die by any means other than natural causes as it would mean less of a chance of ""healthy"" kids to either become breeders or war pups.  The Vertigo comic coming out later this summer about Furiosa may shed some light on her past, but we don't really know how she became a high ranking official in their army after she was taken as a child.  But I would image that Joe wouldn't want any females healthy enough to be out ""doing war"" to be out there if there was a chance they could either be Breeder or Milk Mothers.  Obviously I am guessing on that last point since Joe is a fanatical, god-complex weirdo.  Women certainly can, and have in the series, been bad asses.  The Warrior Woman in Mad Max 2, even Auntie Entity in Thunderdome, the Vuvalini, culminating with Furiosa.  So this is just my take on my there are no war girls :)"
MadMax,37v9ph,leonryan,6,Sat May 30 19:57:13 2015 UTC,"i disagree with your interpretation of ""half life"".  Slit has a big tumor beneath his right ear and the ear itself is bubbled, though that may be a cauliflower ear and not a tumor.  Organic Mechanic labels Max a Full Life and we know he's healthy.  i believe Half Life refers to radiation sickness, since the length of a radioactive material's toxic effect is called it's half life and all those warboys known as half lives are riddled with tumours, and possibly with hair loss and anemia.  it seems highly likely that a Half Life is someone who's irradiated and dying."
MadMax,37v9ph,uponthecityofzephon,4,Sun May 31 03:13:22 2015 UTC,"Half life definitely means they're dying young, at half the age of healthy people. Nux spells it out when he's saying he's sad that he had the chance to die historic three times, but now the night fever or his two tumors will kill him instead. Every War Boy has lumps, and they even tattoo on Max's back that he is lump free"
MadMax,37v9ph,eff1ngham,4,Sun May 31 06:23:47 2015 UTC,"These are all very fair opinions.   For what it's worth, I'll continue to disagree that ""Half Life"" is a cultural rather then physical thing just because of the voice over that says, ""our bones are poisoned, we have become half-life."" It'd also explain something of Splendid's insistence that they spare Nux by saying, ""he's at the end of his half-life!"" If they know he's soon to die anyway, then saving him from Furiosa's knife seems like less of a recklessly pacifistic move.    Also, none of the wives fear Nux. When Capable finds him in the back of the truck, she's startled but not frightened. This makes me think they have some sympathy for the War Boyz, born sick and brainwashed into wanting to die for an evil old man's lies.   But being born Half-Life could be like being born HIV+, like a chronic condition that may or may not actually grow into the tumor-causing, blood-thining disease that will kill you. This might be why some War Boyz are older and healthier then Nux."
MadMax,37v9ph,uponthecityofzephon,1 point,Sat May 30 20:18:42 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately my first issue of the Fury Road comic STILL hasn't arrived in mail, but I believe it may have additional information on the subject.  But you certainly could be right :)  I will say though, the reason the wives aren't afraid of Nux is because they know they would never be hurt since the're Joe's property.  The only thing they have to fear is going back to the Citadel.    It's also interesting to consider, the Wives and many of the war boys look to be the same age.  Obviously the war boys are brainwashed and loyal to the death to Joe, but did they grow up knowing each other at all?  I would imagine Joe kept the Wives away from everyone as much as possible, but over the years I wonder if any of them came into contact with each other.  Could explain why Capable felt sorry for Nux, maybe she was friends with other war boys in the past"
MadMax,37v9ph,Teantis,2,Sat May 30 20:35:01 2015 UTC,"I imagine the Wives can't have spent ALL their time locked in the Vault just because Joe bothered to put chastity belts on them. Why do that if they are never going to have any contact with anyone who's not Joe?   However, Nux had never seen them before, thus his surprise at how ""shiny"" they are. This makes me think they could see the War Boyz even if they couldn't be seen by them. Whatever they saw of the Boyz lives and training...they seem to pity them."
MadMax,37v9ph,ZiGraves,2,Sat May 30 23:39:19 2015 UTC,"The Wives could easily have never left the vault. Joe put the belts on as a form of control, and also because he's crazy, or because he's afraid of someone breaking in (which, you know, happened)."

MadMax,37v9ph,teaqualizer,1 point,Sun May 31 17:06:49 2015 UTC,"Seems likely enough that he'd bring his Wives out as a show of wealth when other leaders are visiting his Citadel.

The belts are both a display of power & ownership (wearing his mark on them, showing that he owns & controls their reproductive status), and a means of ensuring that none of the guests can get cocky enough to try and have a quickie with one of his wives."

MadMax,37v9ph,uponthecityofzephon,3,Sun May 31 20:01:30 2015 UTC,I think that fundamentally many armies tend to be exclusively male because it's easier to maintain control than it would be in a unisex army. Trying to keep the war boys in line is probably tough enough without introducing sexual politics into the mix.   Also I'm pretty sure that a woman can keep producing breast milk many years after giving birth. That's why wet nurse used to be a viable profession.
MadMax,37v9ph,uponthecityofzephon,5,Sat May 30 19:52:49 2015 UTC,"I think that fundamentally many armies tend to be exclusively male because it's easier to maintain control than it would be in a unisex army.    Is that really true though, or is it one of those reasons that's always been given for why women ""have"" to stay home and raise the babies? There are real honest-to-god female soldiers in many armies around the world today, and they seem to do just fine.   And this seems to be a world with a very utilitarian attitude towards gender. The Brides are valuable because they are healthy and fertile. Furiosa is not valuable because even though she's healthy, she's not fertile, and an infertile female is no use to anyone. Furiosa had to learn to fight to justify her continued existence. Potential War Girlz, sick and infertile from birth, are not given even that chance because resources are limited and it's not worth raising a girl who can't breed.      Trying to keep the war boys in line is probably tough enough without introducing sexual politics into the mix.    I never got the impression the War Boyz were difficult to control. They are crazy in battle, but when Furiosa deviated from the plan they'd been given, they obediently followed her lead until it became clear she'd betrayed the Immortan. Their loyalty to the Immortan is absolute... as far as we've seen, anyway. If she was the new Immortan, they'd need to adjust, but I doubt ""gender politics"" would concern them as much as, ""are we still going to Valhalla after this??"""

MadMax,37yd5o,teaqualizer,4,Sun May 31 16:12:30 2015 UTC,"You're attributing modern day Islamic extremism to Mohammed. Mohammed was no different from any religious founder. He had armies, tax systems, a bureaucracy, and when he died his successor was elected.  Maybe you could argue he's more like bin Laden, as a religious leader in a very, very trying time, uniting people by promising a return to golden age, but even then, it's not specific enough. There are hundreds if not thousands of people like him."
MadMax,37yd5o,Rebelsuns,-6,Sun May 31 14:26:44 2015 UTC,He was different from many religious founders. Jesus and Mohammed and Buddha were all completely people from different backgrounds who lived different lives. Can you name any other religious founders who were warlords who kept sex slaves?
MadMax,37yd5o,autowikibot,2,Sun May 31 14:45:53 2015 UTC,"If you compare Mohammed, who ruled a state and nation in his own time, to Jesus and Buddha, who were not political leaders, then yeah, Mohammed is special.  Jewish leaders like Joshua led war campaigns to conquer the holy land. The way they fought is comparable to genocide, as the Ban ordered the death of all men women and children.  Then there are more examples if you don't just look at religions that survived to the present day. The Taiping Rebellion killed 20 million as was led by a man that styled himself the brother of Jesus. There's Tenskwatawa, a prophet who led the Shawnee in a war against the United States.  Prophets/Military leaders exist all throughout history, and Joe was an approximation of many of them, who himself used a strange combination of Norse mythology."

I just took it that their plan was to get away from Joe and that they are going to drive out into the unknown to try and find somewhere new to settle with a solid buffer of 160 days to find more supplies.
MadMax,37trr7,teaqualizer,19,Sat May 30 09:31:42 2015 UTC,"The salt flat is implied to be the dried up ocean, so its not about  crossing Australia but about crossing the ocean. Furiosa said at the start they were heading eadt, so we can surmise this is the east coast. The pacific is pretty big, with only a few polynesian islands and new zealand potentially in their way.  But more importantly,Max says ""I guarantee that 160 days ride that way is nothing but salt.""  Doesn't  say he's been there before.  He JUST finished saying in the scene before that hope is a mistake and you need to fix what is broken or go insane. I don't  think he knows what's  out there on the salt flats. I think he just believes there isn't  hope there, while the citadel has thousands of people who are suffering, and their best shot at redemption."
MadMax,37trr7,CanadianMutton,3,Sat May 30 13:42:33 2015 UTC,Maybe they don't actually know how big the earth is as Furiosa was seemingly born in to a post-apocalyptic world and so was possibly Max in Fury Road(the continuity seems to be different from the originals).

MadMax,37trr7,Retlaw83,4,Mon Jun 1 23:39:34 2015 UTC,"I think you're thinking about it wrong. they wouldn't be riding in a straight line hitting the edge and then giving up, there's millions of square miles of land in Australia to be exploring. That's 160 days of wandering the whole expanse of the wastes. also, as a side note to the people saying its the ocean. that's crazy right? the ocean? I mean the ocean's not a flat plain with some water over it, it's thousands of feet deep, and it doesn't just gradually incline down either. it'd be like riding down the side of Everest."

Anything that would dry up all the world's oceans would also have killed every living thing on the planet. More likely, the oceans have been somewhat reduced. Perhaps there is now a land bridge all the way between Australia and Papua New Guinea, for example."
MadMax,37trr7,transemacabre,5,Sat May 30 19:56:16 2015 UTC,"The way I understood it was they were on what was at one point the Australian coast, and the salt plain they were looking to cross was the ocean, all dried up. They didn't know how long the salt plain lasted, so they didn't know of they could make it to the other side in less than 160 days. I'm pretty sure with no ocean to contend with, there's no where on earth you couldn't drive in that amount of time, but they had no way of knowing that. It's actually disappointing, because I would have loved to see how other continents fared in the apocalypse."

Where the oceans used to be is what they call ""the salts"" now.  I always assumed that the 160 days would account for days or even weeks of backtracking if the dried up ocean floor became impassable. I also assumed it accounted for their survival once they found somewhere suitable to grow new food and plants with the seeds. If they used 3/4 of their fuel to find a new home, they would still have fuel left to scout the new surrounding area, for example. I don't believe it's implied that they would be riding their bikes straight for 160 days. I always assumed it basically meant they had enough supplies for about 6 months worth of food to live on in addition to how far they could travel on the gas they brought."

(based on https://www.google.com/search?q=etymology+deaf&gws_rd=ssl )
MadMax,37u3vu,nemothorx,2,Sat May 30 16:05:32 2015 UTC,"I think the Doof Warrior has become Mad Max's ""Boba Fett"", a character in Star Wars that was supposed to be just a minor role but everyone loved him so much that he's become larger than life."

MadMax,37xgs2,Chaosgreg,1 point,Sun May 31 05:55:04 2015 UTC,All those long silly fight scenes wore me out. I had such high hopes for this movie but was let down. The guitar man and the boss guy was cool.
MadMax,37scdf,ACFCrawford,11,Sat May 30 00:13:48 2015 UTC,"I love how body positive this movie is, just about every character in the movie has some kind of mark from the environment they live in forever written on their character, but nobody ever draws attention to it. A gimp leg is no more of a crooked sight then a giant tumor, a missing arm, or a person with vestigial limbs. Even the most evil characters will never address what is physically different about them, because every one of them has their own burden to bear."
MadMax,37scdf,dangoofed,8,Sat May 30 04:02:58 2015 UTC,"I really enjoyed this aspect too. I really felt that if the end of the world was such a huge nuclear holocaust, that we'd see more deformed/mutated people and animals, and that wasn't all that present if the first three movies, but I'm glad that it made it into Fury Road.  Now, it also makes more sense in Fury Road, and less so in the older films, because now a full generation of people have been born post-WWIII, people who are more likely to exhibit mutations due to radiation/etc..."
MadMax,37scdf,PantsBonanza,2,Sat May 30 05:15:29 2015 UTC,"The global nuclear exchange only happened post-Mad Max, pre-Road Warrior, iirc."
MadMax,37scdf,LongHorsa,1 point,Mon Jun 1 22:30:45 2015 UTC,"Oh, I know, I'm just saying that we never see anything in Road Warrior and Beyond Thunderdome. I just really like seeing mutants/radiation sickness in my post-apocalyptic media, so I'm glad that Fury Road included it."
MadMax,37scdf,PantsBonanza,8,Tue Jun 2 05:00:43 2015 UTC,"But at the same time, his father's body was used as a spectacle for the Citadel. I'm not sure he would really want to work with Furiosa after that."
MadMax,37scdf,HoustonsSolution,5,Sat May 30 00:50:31 2015 UTC,"He sort of struck me as a 'please don't kill me.  I'll do what you want' kind of person.  But yeah, that's a good point."
MadMax,37scdf,skonen_blades,6,Sat May 30 04:47:32 2015 UTC,Its not like he can resist. He doesn't look like he can hardly walk. The cult of the war boys was built on the persona of Immortan Joe. They likely would hold him no loyalty.   He'd be lucky to survive the night.
MadMax,37scdf,Lord_NiteShade,4,Sat May 30 14:21:24 2015 UTC,"I like to think that Furiosa kept Corpus around in an administrative role after the credits, as he seems to be fairly intelligent and probably knows the workings of the Citadel in a way few people do. Like the Organic Mechanic, he surely has skills worth employing. With the Bullet Farmer and the People Eater dead, not to mention Joe, the Bullet Farm and Gastown are surely in disarray, and Corpus Colossus is probably one of the few people left who knows how to communicate and negotiate with the survivors of those outposts.  I took the scene of Corpus allowing Furiosa and the wives to be brought up as him taking the chance that they would keep him alive, as opposed to letting the remaining War Boys fight it out for control of the Citadel, which Corpus will certainly NOT survive."
MadMax,37scdf,transemacabre,8,Sat May 30 19:06:06 2015 UTC,"I love, LOVE this character. He's really visually memorable and just fits the overall style of the movies.  He looked REALLY scared of the War Pups once Furiosa made her way back to the Citadel, probably because he was in charge of molding them into proper War Boys; or at least supervising them to some degree.   Either they tore his ass apart like the Wretched did with Joe's corpse, OR he was sent below to live with the filthy masses now that his family had been fully taken out of power. I just don't think Furiosa would want ANY aspect of Immortan's regime to live on except for his seemingly unlimited water supply and (possibly) the remaining War Boys/Pups in order to defend the Citadel.  Whatever happened, I don't see Corpus being allowed to live comfortably after the events of Fury Road."
MadMax,37scdf,CurtBaboon,3,Sat May 30 02:15:04 2015 UTC,It's unusual that he didn't seem to have a clear brawny counterpart to carry him around ala master blaster or bran and hodor.   Although he was only in it for one scene.   You would assume that his power would lie in information if there is a second film and it focuses on the citadel.
MadMax,37scdf,teaqualizer,11,Sat May 30 00:50:35 2015 UTC,"More than one scene by my memory -- near the beginning, everyone except for Joe (including Rictus) seems to defer to his authority, which implies to me that he might be one of the main administrators in the Citadel."
MadMax,37scdf,leonryan,4,Sat May 30 01:07:01 2015 UTC,"his name, corpus colossus, is a part of the brain.  presumably what he lacks in physical strength he makes up for in intelligence."
MadMax,37scdf,skonen_blades,5,Sat May 30 10:26:22 2015 UTC,Maybe he does get carried around Master-style by Rictus during day-to-day operations.

MadMax,37pg0r,stinkywizzleteets6,4,Fri May 29 18:56:07 2015 UTC,"Still showing up as R, I think it's just a flub on the part of IMDB.  Though, since we're talking about the rating..... can someone explain to me what made it R? There was no cursing, no blood/gore, yeah there was action violence, but almost all of the worst of it happened off screen. There is one nude woman, but all of her bits are covered. The only thing I can think of is that all of the wives nipples poke through their shirts. Is that really enough for an R rating?"
MadMax,37pg0r,CrystalElyse,6,Fri May 29 15:36:58 2015 UTC,Suggestive imagery is sometimes enough to get an R rating. Examples include the cutting of the baby out and the face getting ripped off.
MadMax,37pg0r,HoustonsSolution,2,Fri May 29 15:46:23 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. The baby thing I didn't think was that bad, but I can see it being upsetting. I was, however, very glad that we didn't get close ups of Joe's jaw being ripped off, and the shot of him dead was very quick and not really long enough to get in much detail. I feel like they did their best to keep the gore to a minimum, even with all of the craziness."
MadMax,37pg0r,CrystalElyse,3,Fri May 29 15:53:07 2015 UTC,SPOILERS: There was some cursing when Max is on the front of the car he yells fuck a couple times and than Furiosa shoots a guys cheat off and his ribs hang out and immortan joes face gets ripped off
MadMax,37pg0r,Papermachetoilet,1 point,Fri May 29 16:08:44 2015 UTC,"I don't remember the guy with his ribs hanging out at all. And Immortan Joe's injury happened off screen, the reveal later on only showed him for, what 4 seconds?    The fucks I honestly didn't notice, but with all of his mumbles and grunts I guess it just slipped by me. That could definitely be some of it. I've seen it twice, and there was a good bit of goreyness, I just never really felt like it was any worse than any other PG13 movie out there, you know?  Thanks, though. I'll have to pay more attention to those moments when the blu ray comes out."
MadMax,37pg0r,CrystalElyse,2,Fri May 29 16:16:45 2015 UTC,I don't remember the guy with his ribs hanging out at all.    It is one of the canyon bike gang IIRC. Furiosa shoots some type of grenade at him and for a moment you see his chest all 'sploded.

MadMax,37osi4,jdmax,6,Fri Jun 19 03:17:52 2015 UTC,"""Angharad used to call them anti-seed: plant one and watch the thing die."" is accurate.   Source: Seen the movie five times. Love that line."
MadMax,37osi4,sirenmika,2,Fri May 29 19:13:08 2015 UTC,Thanks!  I caught the line last night on my second time watching the movie. But if you've watched it 5x you've probably caught all the stuff I've missed.
MadMax,37osi4,sirenmika,4,Fri May 29 22:20:44 2015 UTC,"I'm a total movie geek and this movie hits all the marks, man.   My favorite little thing to mention to people in case they never realized it or noticed it, is the hand signs that the War Boys give when they talk about V8 or Valhalla or Immortan Joe. The way they lace their fingers makes their hands look like an 8 cylinder engine, or a V8 Engine.   I feel like there isn't a detail out of place and I love George Miller for that SO MUCH."
MadMax,37osi4,2Weird2Live2Rare2Die,1 point,Sat May 30 03:55:04 2015 UTC,"I hadn't noticed that but yeah, now I'm even more impressed. That was certainly the feeling I got from the movie--nothing is there on accident or just because it was the most convenient thing. The text isn't just filler, the detail is layers deep, the characters are nuanced."
MadMax,37osi4,CanadianMutton,1 point,Sun May 31 05:16:01 2015 UTC,"A friend with an eye for historical details said that the same gesture was a Viking salute representing a mead hall.  Grain of salt, dunno if that's true, but if so it makes for a cool synergy with the V8 and Valhalla."
MadMax,37osi4,copperwatt,4,Sun Jun 7 10:54:49 2015 UTC,"My favourite part of this is that later, when the Keeper of the seeds knows she is about to die, she reaches for her bag of seeds. The Dag hands it to her and she clutches it. You think she just wants to hold onto her seeds as she passes, bit then when a warboy shows up, she pulls a bullet out of her bag of seeds and plants it in his face. Little bit of a callback. I love it."
MadMax,37osi4,Turbofurball,2,Fri May 29 23:33:45 2015 UTC,I also love the mirrored shots of that bag of seeds and the bag full of mixed bullets the wives are given to sort.
MadMax,37ouis,JMueller2012,8,Fri May 29 06:00:13 2015 UTC,"The credits called her Miss Gitty. I doubt she was ever a breeder. According to some behind-the-scenes stuff, she's supposed to be one of the few people old enough to remember life before the world fell and she's a kind of historian. Joe may have employed her as a teacher and caretaker for his Wives, because the only thing rarer then a healthy fertile woman, it's a healthy fertile woman who is also educated. It increased their value. And I think he'd like the idea that the mothers of his children are intelligent and cultured. That's why he's breeding with the Wives rather then the standard Milk Mothers.  Maybe he also wanted his wives to know things because they weren't just stock, they were entertainment. There is a piano and sheet music and writing desks and books in that vault, so maybe he went there to listen to his little wives play music.... and watch them bathe and whatever other terrible things he liked to do to relax.   I think the reason Miss Gitty is so marked-up is because in a world where books are rarer then gold, you need some other way to carry your knowledge around with you. I think I saw a page from the prequel comic (haven't read it yet) where she used a word on her arm as an illustration for the story she was telling some children. I noticed similar tattoos on the Dag's fingers as well, maybe as markings of the different lessons she's mastered.   As for why she came with the War Party, I think Joe wanted to see her face when he reclaimed his ""treasures."" Maybe was planning to kill her in front of them to punish them for running away. We won't ever know, but she was in on the plan, and she was the only person upset when Splendid lay dying."
MadMax,37ouis,IdiotsLantern,7,Fri May 29 07:37:41 2015 UTC,"That's why he's breeding with the Wives rather then the standard Milk Mothers.   I thought that the implication was that any children born from non-pure Breeders wound up riddled with birth defects (eg Joe's two sons, the various limbless people we saw, the War Boys' anaemia and strong pre-disposition to developing cancers, etc.) which was why the Wives were so incredibly valuable to him. They represented basically his only chance at producing viable offspring."
MadMax,37ouis,SirCannonFodder,2,Fri May 29 10:35:02 2015 UTC,"I'm liking your theory on the 'pure breeder', it makes a lot of sense."
MadMax,37ouis,alec_vx,2,Fri May 29 14:22:59 2015 UTC,"She's down in the art book as Miss Giddy, apparently all the words on her are her own attempts to keep history written down - books tend to get lost, or burned for fuel, or torn up to use as building materials, etc. But what's on skin can last as long as that person does, or even longer.  Her tattoos are as much history of the world before it ended as she can remember, and the book suggested there are others like her who also keep human history on their skin."
MadMax,37ouis,ZiGraves,4,Fri May 29 08:54:38 2015 UTC,In a cut scene she's killed by the organic mechanic apparently.  It'd be interesting to see her skin appear in a random place in a future sequel.

MadMax,37ouis,creepypaster,4,Fri May 29 10:53:17 2015 UTC,"I think she was an earlier wife/breeder for Joe.  She's significantly older so her age matches up with being Rictus' and the midget's (forgot his name!) mother.  I assume she stayed behind to somehow minimize suspicions that the 5 wives were gone, to keep the room from being dead silent perhaps?  Her role could be that of a mother figure for them too, looking out for them as a fellow female while imprisoned."
MadMax,37ouis,BigTimStrange,3,Fri May 29 06:09:12 2015 UTC,"She's a History Woman. Paper and parchment is impossible to produce in the Wasteland so people take on the role of historians, tattooing words and phrases on their skin, telling stories (called ""word burgers"") about the world before and after it fell.   I assume after they die their skin is removed and tanned so the information on their skin is preserved for future generations."
MadMax,37ouis,LostSoulsAlliance,2,Fri May 29 23:57:30 2015 UTC,"I think she was the head ""nanny"" and caretaker of the girls. I would guess that she thought she was told old to make the journey, so she would wait for Joe and kill him when he would inevitably figure out what was going on. Obviously it didn't work out when she missed, and I imagine Joe planned to make an example of her once he caught the girls; plus he didn't trust her any more so better to bring her along."
MadMax,37ouis,BobaFetted,1 point,Fri May 29 06:08:16 2015 UTC,"I think she's one of the history people, as seen in the new comic. They have knowledge of the world before, and keep information and history through all the craziness, and have it tattooed all over their bodies."

MadMax,37mg0n,scuttlebuggy,27,Thu May 28 20:02:27 2015 UTC,"Furiosa is unquestionably the coolest name to give a baby. On a slightly more serious note, here is some information about the name you probably never cared about. I'm not sure if there has been official confirmation for the specific reasoning behind the name, but here are a few possibilities.   George Miller is the best at naming characters (100% true), and simply came up with the most badass-sounding name possible. The Furies: Greek female deities of vengeance. In the movie, Furiosa is certainly taking some vengeance, so it would fit. A reference to Orlando Furioso, this old Italian epic poem about a guy who betrays his emperor and then goes mad. The title literally means 'Raging Roland'. And if you're looking for a name to give a female road-warrior meant to be the equal of 'Mad Max'?? Seems like a good choice."
MadMax,37mg0n,scuttlebuggy,14,Thu May 28 20:01:59 2015 UTC,"Moreover Rockatansky is just a cooler version of Carl von Rokitansky, whom - I imagine - Miller learned about during his medical career."

I was expecting her real name to be something more Vuvalini-ish.  But it didn't bother me too much.  Furiosa is indeed a super cool name.
MadMax,37mg0n,skonen_blades,6,Thu May 28 20:22:09 2015 UTC,"""her real name"" does not necessarily mean ""given at birth"". Was she old enough to choose her own name before she was taken?

MadMax,37n8i0,renegaade,5,Thu May 28 23:58:58 2015 UTC,I've seen it twice.  Once in 3d AVX and once in regular 2D.  I plan on going again next week in 3dAVX again.  I liked it in 2D but I found the 3D to be more immersive.
MadMax,37n8i0,skonen_blades,1 point,Thu May 28 23:00:32 2015 UTC,"I agree with this. I saw it twice, once in 3D and then in 2D. 3D was really immersive, I though they shot it in 3D. For a post converted 3D movie it was really well done 3D."
MadMax,37n8i0,TheOneWithTheNose,5,Fri May 29 01:45:29 2015 UTC,"the thing is, the 3D was carefully made for this movie, knowing very well it can cause nausea and headaches if there is  too much of it.  miller talks about that in one of his interviews. ""safety first"" seemed to be his main concern for his crew during the shooting, and to an extent, for his audience later on. he seems like a great guy.  go see it in 3D if you haven't. it's balanced and well done, unlike ""transformers"" that was basically a 3D mess that gave me a headache to the point i had to remove the glasses."
MadMax,37n8i0,JimmyDaGent,4,Thu May 28 23:18:31 2015 UTC,"The 3D is pretty well done--it's actually pretty subtle except for two parts (the opening logo; the finale crash).  I really would like to see it in 70mm stereo-projector format 3D (true IMAX 3D), but out of the twenty or so theaters in this region, none that can do it are showing it."
MadMax,37n8i0,stormstalker,2,Thu May 28 23:30:05 2015 UTC,"I thought the 3D would be totally over the top and silly, and I was hesitant to even go. I'm glad I did. I've seen it twice in 3D now (once in IMAX), and it was genuinely one of the most fun experiences I've ever had at the theater. I actually was the only person in the entire theater for the matinee showing today, which was pretty fun."
MadMax,37n8i0,leonryan,3,Fri May 29 02:36:29 2015 UTC,"I saw it in 3D first because I didn't realise it was a 3D session when i bought the tickets, and then went back to see it again in 2D.  I may go for a third viewing this weekend to take my Dad.  2D was far better."
MadMax,37n8i0,Cancerslug,4,Thu May 28 23:23:21 2015 UTC,I saw it for the third time today. I will probably see it 2 more times. It's my favorite movie now; Tremors used to be. I plan on buying my first bluray player when Fury Road comes out. I ordered this shirt. I am completely obsessed. I'm also painted up a pig skull with Nux's qoute on it. Still need to do the weathering and learn to weld for the rest of the piece. I also plan on building some War Boy steering wheels for myself and friends.
MadMax,37n8i0,Cancerslug,2,Fri May 29 06:00:29 2015 UTC,Was Nux's dash ornament made from a pig skull? It looked like a skull mounted on sprint with hex nuts for eyes.
MadMax,37n8i0,LisasSister,3,Fri May 29 06:09:48 2015 UTC,"No, it was a bird skull. But I was craving a creative project and Fury Road inspired me.  I would love to make my own Nux bird dash ornament though. It's hilarious when it's bouncy around and he's going nuts."
MadMax,37n8i0,ohnonotnow,3,Fri May 29 07:33:56 2015 UTC,I have seen it four times. All in 3D. The theatre in my town didn't show it in 2D. I'm not a fan of 3D and everytime I left the theatre I got a headache. But I wrote an email to the theatre asking politely if they could squeeze in some 2D showings. They did and I'll see it again on Monday in 2D :)
MadMax,37n8i0,Consolidated_Skeebal,3,Fri May 29 08:11:50 2015 UTC,"I've seen it twice:  once in 3DX on this massive screen with awesome surround sound, and the second time in 3D on a smaller screen with inferior sound.    The first time it was like seeing my favorite rock band play live with first row seats.  The second time was more like having lawn seats."
MadMax,37n8i0,BaltimoreSkater,3,Thu May 28 22:35:15 2015 UTC,"3, all in 2d though. I don't go to 3d movies because I'm not really impressed and its expensive.  I'm debating whether I should go a 4th time, but idk.  I'll definitely buy it on bluray.  edit:weird formatting"
MadMax,37n8i0,YeOldeBaconWhoure,3,Thu May 28 22:39:25 2015 UTC,Seeing it for the third time on Friday :D
MadMax,37n8i0,HoustonsSolution,3,Thu May 28 22:54:38 2015 UTC,"Twice, already planning a third. Both in 2D so far. Probably won't do 3D but maybe. The glasses dont really fit well over my normal glasses."
MadMax,37n8i0,YeOldeBaconWhoure,3,Thu May 28 23:10:22 2015 UTC,"I honestly use the kids size glasses. I don't have a small head or anything, but the normal size are really awkward."
MadMax,37n8i0,maxac,2,Thu May 28 23:17:31 2015 UTC,I agree. My glasses are pretty big though so that would make it even worse haha.
MadMax,37n8i0,maxac,3,Thu May 28 23:31:06 2015 UTC,"My current girlfriend and I have seen Mad Max twice, first time in 2D and 3 days later in 3D, now we are in love and this movie is like ""our movie"" I think we will go for the third time now in DBox, thats is how is called in my country, the chairs with movements :D"
MadMax,37n8i0,tongmaster,1 point,Fri May 29 03:22:06 2015 UTC,"I think they call that 4D here, but I don't know of any theaters nearby that do it. Should be intense though!"
MadMax,37n8i0,Mistress_of_the_Sky,2,Fri May 29 06:17:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah 4D, but now thinking about it, the first time we saw it it was in a theater with a bunch of chairs with ""4D"" but I didn't ask about it because is more expensive, I haven't read reviews of the film in 4D, now I'm not sure if it is available in this format."
MadMax,37n8i0,OrangeTux,3,Fri May 29 18:42:27 2015 UTC,"Just saw it for the second time, both times in 3D. To be fair I had a gift card for the second viewing, but it is still super fun to see in 3D if it doesn't bother you."
MadMax,37n8i0,DanTMWTMP,3,Fri May 29 06:11:30 2015 UTC,"Seen it once it 2D, but planning on going back this weekend to see it in 3D in IMAX.  And you could always just buy some cheap popcorn and bring it in! That's what we do with all our snacks unless we fancy nachos. Melted cheese is so good."
MadMax,37n8i0,avanns,2,Fri May 29 08:26:53 2015 UTC,"Three times, all 2D.  No plans for anymore viewings."
MadMax,37n8i0,eff1ngham,2,Fri May 29 01:24:17 2015 UTC,Seen it three times.. in 2D.   I plan on to see it again this weekend w/ my dad in 3D.
MadMax,37n8i0,ZiGraves,2,Fri May 29 01:27:19 2015 UTC,"I've seen it twice in 2D and am definitely going at least one more time. I'm considering seeing it in 3D, but I'm not sure yet. I've heard it's better in 2D."
MadMax,37n8i0,warcroft,2,Fri May 29 01:45:18 2015 UTC,3 times in 2D.  Not an especially big fan of 3D in just about any movies I've seen.  If one of my friends wants to go see it in 3D I could probably be convinced
MadMax,37n8i0,BobaFetted,2,Fri May 29 02:46:47 2015 UTC,"Seen it once in 2D, once in 3D. Will be seeing it again next week to take friends who still haven't had the chance to go see it, really want to try and find a good IMAX to go see it in. Maybe a fourth time depending who all else wants in.  Will very definitely be getting it on bluray, because we have a massive HD tv and are considering upgrading it to a stupidly massive ultra-HD tv, and Fury Road in UHD would be a really good reason to do that. Especially if we can get the surround sound hooked up."
MadMax,37n8i0,BobaFetted,2,Fri May 29 09:37:39 2015 UTC,"After Avengers 2 I refuse to watch any post production 3D movies. If its filmed in 3D then Ill definitely watch in 3D.  Mad Max was a visual masterpiece. There was no way I was going to watch it in 3D. Im thankful I saw Avengers 2 first, otherwise I would have spoiled Mad Max for myself."
MadMax,37n8i0,ProfBatman,2,Fri May 29 10:47:03 2015 UTC,"I've seen it seven times so far. Once in 3D, the 3D was okay, pretty exciting, but I dont much care dor 3D in general. I plan to see it atleast 4 more times before it leaves theaters. I'm already dreaming of the multiple blu-ray sets I'll certainly buy for this film!"
MadMax,37n8i0,sirenmika,2,Fri May 29 17:25:01 2015 UTC,"Wow, seven times!  I saw it in 3D again last night, and the 3D just dulls the colors so much. I'm looking to buy the art books and blu-ray and whatever other merchandise there is for this one!"
MadMax,37nmlv,IndyBrodaSolo,6,Thu May 28 23:32:26 2015 UTC,"I just bought it today! I don't usually do impulse buys of anything, but I loved the movie so much that I knew I  had to have it. The art is beautiful, and I love the maps of each major settlement.   It's also cool to see the concepts that didn't quite make it into the film (like the raider hovercraft that lures cars in giant quicksand pit). I was also really, really happy to get a good look at each of the major and minor cars in the armada.   It's quite an excellent book."
MadMax,37nmlv,-ArthurDent-,4,Fri May 29 04:11:26 2015 UTC,"Oh man, I'm waiting for it to arrive, hopefully tomorrow or next week. It seem like they did some nice photo-shot just for the artbook, I want to see them all!"
MadMax,37nmlv,NikolasPascal,3,Fri May 29 02:37:43 2015 UTC,"It's really beautiful. It's also incredibly useful for any cosplayers or prop builders, since it gives us some really high quality stills of Furiosa's car, Max's jacket, Nux's scarification, the Wives' various wraps, Angharad's facial scars, etc. If anyone on the sub needs cosplay or prop-making references, ask any of us with a copy of the book and we can try to find some good reference photos from it for you."

MadMax,37nmlv,sardu1,2,Fri May 29 13:51:09 2015 UTC,"It's a very good book! Only thing missing was some of the characters. I'd like to see a page or two dedicated to Rictus Erectus. Also, something I found odd is that some faces are blurred out in a few of the production stills. Never seen this in a behind-the-scenes book before."
MadMax,37km66,IndyBrodaSolo,41,Thu May 28 09:02:52 2015 UTC,"great news! that's probably us going back to the fury road for a second or third time.  it seems there is already a cult for this movie. i see a lot of well-written articles or discussions, crazy theories etc. and it's only been 3 weeks."
MadMax,37km66,JimmyDaGent,26,Thu May 28 09:33:27 2015 UTC,it's great to see it opening a whole new generation of fans.  i have a 13 year old son who i've shown Mad Max 2 before and he liked it but it didn't blow his mind.  last week i took him to see Fury Road and now he loves the whole universe and wants to watch them all.  Nux in particular really appealed to him and i have a feeling there's going to be tons of Warboys at upcoming comic cons for the next couple of years.
MadMax,37km66,leonryan,12,Thu May 28 09:46:57 2015 UTC,Just noticed that original Mad Max movies have climbed to top list in my home country's iTunes. They are now definitely making money with old movies as well as Fury Road.
MadMax,37km66,tkms,1 point,Thu May 28 09:58:03 2015 UTC,Nux was absolutely my favorite. So well done.
MadMax,37km66,MatchaJelly,13,Mon Jun 1 17:16:16 2015 UTC,"A lot of my friends have seen it or plan to see it at least twice. I think most of them come out, dazed and overwhelmed by what they witnessed.   Most of them told me after they passed the Storm scene, the audience was so shocked by what had transpired by that long action sequence, they just stayed silent until someone mutters "" Holy shiiit ""  Then they decide that it's worth seeing it a second time, just so they can take in more details. And in my case, I tell my friends about the movie, they plan to go watch it so I just tag along. Because gosh darnit it is the best movie I have seen in a very long time ! I'll see it next week and it will be my fourth time.  I am tempted to pre-order the DVD but I want to see if there is a Limited Edition coming out."
MadMax,37km66,CrystalElyse,7,Thu May 28 13:32:33 2015 UTC,"Yup. The first time, also, I had never seen any of the Mad Max movies before. So I watched 1 & 2 and then ended up wanting to see Fury Road again because it was just so metal. I felt like I hand't really understood what was happening that well the first time and really wanted to see it again.  I also kind of now want to see it again a third time.... but that will have to wait for blu ray release."
MadMax,37km66,MatchaJelly,9,Thu May 28 15:37:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah I saw the first 3, but I feel that Fury Road, like many pointed out, is the film that George Miller has always wanted to make.   I really like how Josh Helman , who plays Slit puts it:  ""It feels so much grander and more polished""  I cannot wait for the Blue Ray to see all the bloopers and footage that did not make it into the movie!"
MadMax,37km66,CrystalElyse,3,Thu May 28 16:09:10 2015 UTC,"Well, I don't give a shit what you think is cringy. I'm old and haven't changed my slang in over a decade. I'm not here for you to validate my ""coolness.""   See what happens to you in another 10-15 years and you're still saying ""left swipe"" or ""snap me"" or ""swerve"" or ""thot"" or whatever the hell it is."
MadMax,37km66,SirCannonFodder,2,Fri May 29 02:20:39 2015 UTC,"It's just short-hand for ""Exemplifies, or has many things in common with, the aesthetics of heavy metal music culture"". So take the bloody stick out yer arse."
MadMax,37km66,lyricalsaint,1 point,Fri May 29 02:38:07 2015 UTC,"With that logic, so is ""super cringey"". Hell, at least ""metal"" is an acutal word, ""cringey"" on the other hand..."

MadMax,37km66,LostSoulsAlliance,2,Fri May 29 17:55:12 2015 UTC,"It seems like a lot of people are seeing this movie more than once. I'm thinking it will have legs and stay in the theaters for a while. All the movies coming out this weekend are looking pretty bad according to Rotten Tomatoes rankings, so it might have another good week before Jurassic World clobbers everybody."
MadMax,37km66,Grayfoxxhounds777,20,Thu May 28 10:28:48 2015 UTC,Damn right that is where it belongs
MadMax,37km66,leonryan,9,Fri May 29 06:12:07 2015 UTC,"i've been looking at box office stats every few days since it opened, but i don't really know what i'm doing.  is it officially posting a profit yet?  it seems a surprising number of us are seeing it more than once, and it appears to still be pulling high numbers as time goes by."
MadMax,37km66,nemothorx,12,Thu May 28 13:12:30 2015 UTC,"The estimate cost was $150million. The estimated box office totals are around $100 million so far.   I imagine WB has a lot of mined data to estimate how well it'll do in the box office now based off the first two weekends (like, they'll have a good idea that it'll have better holding power than Pitch Perfect 2, and probably have a pretty good idea that it'll do really well in long term BluRay sales too - so hopefully all that adds up enough that they'll happily greenlight a further MM movie :)"
MadMax,37km66,neatntidy,12,Thu May 28 09:44:39 2015 UTC,"Counting international, the box office total is 230 million"

MadMax,37km66,pickelsurprise,5,Thu May 28 19:53:10 2015 UTC,Is it enough to be considered a success yet? I need that sequel.
MadMax,37km66,neatntidy,5,Thu May 28 20:02:50 2015 UTC,"Including international it has apparently grossed 230 million, over a budget of 150 million. I suspect it'll reach at least 250 million by the time its theatrical release is over, and if the cult following is to be believed, it's going to clean house on home media sales.  Exceeding the budget by 100 million may sound like a lot to us common folk, but I'm pretty sure that's actually a tiny margin compared to what producers actually want. Still, sequels have been made on far smaller profits. I'm confident we'll see Wasteland yet."
MadMax,37km66,avanns,7,Thu May 28 18:06:56 2015 UTC,"It'll hit 300 million. There's nothing good dropping until Jurassic world and that's 3-4 weeks away. I agree that in our current box office world even 300 on 150 isn't impressive, but its become a sensation. I think execs see that this series has real legs"

MadMax,37km66,xxtruthxx,3,Thu May 28 18:30:10 2015 UTC,"I've seen it 3 times in the theater already, tempted to make it a 4th this weekend."
MadMax,37km66,morecomplete,3,Fri May 29 02:26:05 2015 UTC,Seen it twice. Best movie I've seen since 300 and before that the Matrix. Might go watch it again tomorrow.
MadMax,37km66,CrystalElyse,7,Thu May 28 20:45:03 2015 UTC,Still can't believe it got beat out by Pitch Perfect 2 on opening day.
MadMax,37km66,morecomplete,14,Fri May 29 03:09:49 2015 UTC,"Not really. Pitch Perfect is a comedy, it appeals to the masses, and it's easily accessable. Fury Road is an R rated action movie. So, only adults with no kids or a baby sitter can go see it (no teens, no bringing the kids, no families) , and some people may not want to see an over the top action film. It makes a lot of sense that Pitch Perfect would beat it out, just because it's all about the numbers."
MadMax,37km66,CrystalElyse,4,Thu May 28 13:47:24 2015 UTC,I guess. I never saw the first one. Never even heard of it. The PG-13 rating makes sense though.
MadMax,37km66,morecomplete,4,Thu May 28 15:39:52 2015 UTC,"Really? Huh. Are you outside of the US? I was in upstate NY when the first came out, and now I'm in GA. Both areas just about everyone has at least heard of both, and, maybe it's just the social circles I hang out in, but not that many haven't seen the first one. A few people haven't seen the second one yet, but it's only been out for a few weeks AND these days I'm noticing a lot more people waiting for things to come out on redbox/netflix instead of going to the movies."
MadMax,37km66,CrystalElyse,5,Thu May 28 15:54:45 2015 UTC,"Maybe I just heard ""musical comedy"" and blocked it from memory."
MadMax,37km66,bryanlharris,5,Thu May 28 16:12:46 2015 UTC,"Maybe. I mean, it's not a masterpiece or anything, but the first movie was definitely palatable and had a number of good laughs. I you liked Mean Girls or Easy A, it fits in well with that style of humor.   The second one I thought was much funnier, but I think it was more that I was ""surprised"" at most of the joke. I'm sure on second viewing it wouldn't be quite as good."
MadMax,37km66,gypsiequeen,4,Thu May 28 16:32:37 2015 UTC,Just googled it and was pretty confused.  Cubemate says it's a comedy and that the first one was pretty funny.  At first I thought it was about baseball or softball or something.
MadMax,37km66,morecomplete,5,Thu May 28 18:01:04 2015 UTC,"pitch perfect 1 was..... absolutely hilarious and awesome, i'm honestly not surprised it crushed it.   it's like they decided to make some movies with women in mind and they were successful.... here's hoping that trend continues.....it was a lovely opening weekend all around"

MadMax,37n7t9,eff1ngham,1 point,Fri May 29 02:49:28 2015 UTC,"There's no recognized territory in Antarctica.  Your idea makes more sense than my stranded tourists & businesspeople, or even ship's crew idea, as Antarctic Research stations are more likely to include mechanics who would know their way around land vehicles. Moreover, they are used to living in an austere Environment, albeit a well supplied one.  I hope you propose they came to Australia by ship and don't subscribe to the crazy Notion that the oceans disappeared because of the 160 days worth of supplies they had supplies to travel (which is unrealistic anyway)."
MadMax,37n7t9,fluntcaps,4,Fri May 29 14:44:03 2015 UTC,i like the idea they were just tourists

MadMax,37msbt,eff1ngham,1 point,Sun May 31 03:55:59 2015 UTC,"Oh, I totally understand why they mention it in the actual movie. The article just feels like it was written by someone who doesn't actually know anything about cars (not that I do either...), and they just picked something random out of the list of features from the first film. To me it almost feels like they think it's referring to the iconic blower, which is definitely what I would have mentioned."

I only remember one scene where a woman is raped. And more men got straight up tortured and murdered than women in the series.  That's not the point. Women have been treated as people in the Mad Max series, not just as women. Maybe they could have been more developed, but so could most of the male characters. This series has been pretty fair."

I was not able to relate to them, not at all. So from a very young age I grew up looking up to male characters. It made me basically despise my own gender because women were almost always portrayed as weak, empathetic and soft, whereas men were a little bit of everything else.  I know better now. But still.

Well, I only watched like five episodes, because I couldn't stand the females.  And when I think about current shows that have likeable and strong female characters the first one that comes to mind is Walking Dead. Maybe it's just the postapocalyptic women who can kick ass :D"

MadMax,37m0i8,ZiGraves,16,Fri May 29 09:17:38 2015 UTC,"The message of Fury Road is, ""we are not things."" The same tyrannical system that enslaved these women also enslaved Max and brainwashed Nux.

MadMax,37m0i8,quesoesbueno59,13,Sun May 31 04:33:23 2015 UTC,I think you're justifying the need for feminism. The fact that a movie is perceived as a radical anomaly simply because it doesn't have terrible depiction of women's roles is an indication that the norm is screwed.

MadMax,37m0i8,EdgarsTeethAreDry,1 point,Thu May 28 21:51:13 2015 UTC,"I think it's more that it's saying something about objectification with gender as one of the vectors. Max becomes a Blood Bag when he is taken prisoner, the Warboys are treated as expendable cannon fodder, Furiosa has clearly done things she is not proud of in Joe's service and the wives are ""breeders""/sex slaves.   They all reclaim their personhood throughout the movie in various ways. ""We are not things"" is the most nail-on-the-head, sure, but Nux/Furiosa/Max all have arcs of rejecting the identity imposed on them and doing their own thing. Nux's crisis of faith, the Wives cutting off the chastity belts and leaving them in the desert, Furiosa  struggling with hope and the little scenes about their real names all point to a wider theme IMO."
MadMax,37m0i8,FoiledFencer,0,Fri May 29 10:38:27 2015 UTC,"I don't see how any of that means that gender isn't a theme of the movie. It is about objectification, and it does show men being objectified, yes, but doesn't mean that it doesn't put more emphasis on women. All but two protagonists are women, Furiosa was raised in a matriarchy before being kidnapped and corrupted in a patriarchy, ""We are not things"" and ""Who killed the world"" are both only said by women, it's made very clear that women are less valued than men as a whole in that society, etc. Yes, it's also about young underprivileged men being exploited for war. The movie can be about gender as well as other things."

We may be in agreement, I just didn't see how what you were saying follows with the point I was making (that the discussion about gender in the movie comes from more than just having strong females) unless you were disagreeing. Sorry if I misinterpreted."
MadMax,37m0i8,EdgarsTeethAreDry,1 point,Sat May 30 09:13:36 2015 UTC,"I guess I worded it poorly. I meant to say that I totally agree that gender is a major part of the movie, but that people seem to get hung up on it to the exclusion of all the other ones. I think that's a shame for a movie with this much going on.   Gender is clearly a theme and it's ground zero for a lot of the related issues (""We are not things""/warboys are expendable/the matriarchal tribe with seeds and anti-seeds).   What I'm saying is that I think that all the themes (including gender) and character arcs point towards carving out an identity in spite of all the harshness of the Mad Max universe - the people who end up on the War Rig insist on an identity of their choosing and help eachother to do so. Capable talking to Nux about getting over his dissapointment and shame at having failed in his destiny is a good example. Or Furiosa picking up the pieces of her old clan and trying to cross the salt plain to find a place to start over.  It's totally saying something about gender too. I meant to add, not disagree :)"

MadMax,37m0i8,Bestpaperplaneever,-3,Fri May 29 03:56:45 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure some of the more rabid feminists might take issue with the scene in which Max walks in on the girls washing themselves.

Max finding compassion in himself, and possibly remembering his name after forgetting it while alone in the wasteland so long. I think Max left at the end because thats just his style, he gets caught up in other peoples deals, ends up helping them, learning selflessness, then continues on his way after the trouble is resolved. He's a loner in the wasteland, trying to find his own way. Either way, its a great scene, and contributes to his character arc wonderfully!"
MadMax,37pegk,BobaFetted,7,Fri May 29 17:28:18 2015 UTC,Brothers in arms. Shieldmates. Whatever its called when people grow close in battle. He left because he's a lone wanderer who can't afford to hope. This is not a romantic connection.
MadMax,37pegk,heroicintent,2,Fri May 29 18:40:24 2015 UTC,Bingo. This is the respect and commraderie forged in battle. There is no reason whatsoever to take it as anything romantic. people just are not used to the idea that two leading protagonists of opposite genders do not need to be romantically entangled.
MadMax,37pegk,CanadianMutton,1 point,Fri May 29 23:44:11 2015 UTC,I definitely see the respect and commraderie.  But I also see a little something more.  I'm not saying they are in love with eachother but there is definitely more there.
MadMax,37pegk,renegaade,10,Sat May 30 15:15:43 2015 UTC,He warmed up to her as she had to him. But there wasn't a tinge of romance I believe. It was more out of mutual respect and him giving her his name was almost a token of friendship.  And the reason he left her is because his journey didn't end there. He had faith that the Citadel was now in good hands.
MadMax,37pegk,VforVickers,3,Fri May 29 13:44:24 2015 UTC,"If he had only 'warmed up' to her, then there wouldn't have been so much chemistry, and he wouldn't have held her so close and been so fervently disarmed by her almost dying."

He respected her and saw her as a friend and ally. And that's why he gave her his name.  If you were in distress that you were going to lose someone you cared for (whether it's a friend or family member), you wouldn't hold them close and be disarmed by it?  Let's not forget that Furiosa is an example of a powerful female character who doesn't need to be romantically linked to the male lead.  It was more a powerful friendship than a romantic moment."
MadMax,37pegk,VforVickers,2,Fri May 29 15:06:16 2015 UTC,"Well, I was definitely responding to your 'warmed up' statement. I can see both a powerful friendship and a romantic moment.

MadMax,37nskd,skonen_blades,2,Fri May 29 00:31:45 2015 UTC,"i imagine a ready source of steel like railway tracks would probably be cannibalised pretty quickly in a world of scavengers, and secondly, trains travel predictable routes and are therefore inviting ambush and pursuit.  i mean it would be cool if someone built an indestructible war train, but it could easily be derailed by one man with a crowbar somewhere down the line."

MadMax,37nskd,nemothorx,1 point,Fri May 29 04:08:26 2015 UTC,"i'm impressed it coped with such big gaps, but they didn't say anything about deformations in the rail.  the track is straight, there's a break, and then it continues straight in line with the previous section.  and it wasn't terribly fast either.  still surprising how long it survived though."
MadMax,37nskd,leonryan,1 point,Fri May 29 04:18:15 2015 UTC,"yeah, it certainly seems as if they were missing a few obvious tricks, but it nontheless shows the basic ""derailing is maybe not as easy as you might think at first glance"" point.   As commenters note - there are dedicated derailing devices these days... sure surely were similar back then, if really needed.  (though those have the problem that they can be removed and the enemy has a valid line again..."
MadMax,37nskd,nemothorx,1 point,Fri May 29 04:38:40 2015 UTC,"i'll admit i was impressed, but either way you're going to know exactly where the train is heading, so unless it can outrun enemy cars they're going to be able to get ahead of it and have something nasty waiting.  like a dumptruck full of rocks parked across the line."
MadMax,37nskd,leonryan,0,Fri May 29 04:43:57 2015 UTC,You should watch all of the Mad Max movies then ask questions. Not just watch Fury Road.
MadMax,37nskd,returningtheday,0,Fri May 29 04:30:44 2015 UTC,"It's hard to say, really. Unless somebody is actively maintaining the tracks, it's more than likely that scavengers and time have worn them away to the point of being useless. That said, if Miller & Co can come up with a reasonable explanation as to how serviceable railroads still exist, I'd love to see some train vs car battles, or even train vs train.  Actually, since we saw the salt flats that stretch on for ""a hundred and sixty days"" in Fury Road, it might be interesting to see some kind of land-train type vehicle, designed to quickly cross a huge, flat wasteland. It would be useless on other types of terrain due to being difficult to control, but it could be the only way to cross the salts in a reasonable amount of time."

So, if you accept that, how does this sound?  First-person guitar hero game - you watch the road war happening around you with your guitar in hand, on the mobile stage at the helm of the Doof Wagon. Your task is to play and play good - but also to watch the warboys around you, and if something special is about to happen, to witness it with a suitable musical solo. Even better is if you your regular playing is SO good that you inspire a war boy to a specific action, and through your music basically guide that warboy to live, die, and live again.   As well as the guitar for music, you'd have control over the flame thrower, and various amp and effects - the controls for which would be scattered around the stage - including on the wall of speakers behind you, and you reach them by bungee jumping to them."

The idea was scrapped fairly early, but this is the reason his marauders have police gear such as helmets, cars, and bullhorns.  I found that on there the other day and thought it was interesting because I noticed when I first watched it years ago that they had a lot of police looking stuff, and I hadn't seen MM1 at the time so it never occurred to me that the didn't look like 'the police', they looked like the MFP."

Years later, when two microbes in a studio petri dish figured out people LOVE Max, it was changed again to ""Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior"""
MadMax,37mx0g,skonen_blades,1 point,Sat May 30 15:50:44 2015 UTC,Yeesh. They didn't CONVINCE themselves nobody had heard of Mad Max.

MadMax,37mx0g,skonen_blades,2,Sat May 30 16:59:54 2015 UTC,How did they bork it?  By not releasing it in thousands of theaters and putting a million dollars of advertising behind it?  It was a low-budget Australian exploitation flick from a first-time director with a cast of no-names.  That's super risky to put your studio's money behind.  I mean yeah it was an awesome movie but on paper I think it was an understandable decision.
MadMax,37mx0g,Dreadnought13,1 point,Sat May 30 17:17:52 2015 UTC,"Upon American release, the distributor was afraid Americans wouldn't understand ENGLISH, and so re-dubbed it.  the original audio wasnt available for years afterwards.

MadMax,37mx0g,skonen_blades,3,Sat May 30 17:39:17 2015 UTC,Yup they fucked it.  However it was only the most profitable film in history because it only took $200k to make.  Hard not to make a sweet profit if a film that cheap gets even moderately big.

MadMax,37mn8a,irfoland,3,Thu May 28 19:12:51 2015 UTC,"I mean, obviously the Mad Max series doesn't care too much about continuity, but it really bugs me how people keep on coming up with these arbitrary number of years that it HAS TO BE after the apocalypse and then also saying that their arbitrary number of years has to start after Mad Max as if society in Mad Max hadn't already gone through a huge disintegration, likely after an apocalyptic event, although that's a super vague term anyway."
MadMax,37mn8a,EdgarsTeethAreDry,5,Thu May 28 22:04:10 2015 UTC,"Right? George Miller said himself that there isn't really much continuity because he never intended there to be three, let alone four and however many more we get now.   I kind of like how the timelines are fucky anyway, adds an element. Not sure what or why but it amuses me."
MadMax,37mn8a,YeOldeBaconWhoure,2,Fri May 29 00:20:25 2015 UTC,"I don't think the timelines are necessarily that funky, really. It's certainly plausible that the world is just changing relatively quickly, or certain areas are different from others. You could map out a plausible timeline if you had to, but there's no reason to. Things are kept vague for a reason. It's silly to come up with an argument as to why there definitely could never ever be any continuity in the series, just like the Feral kid theory is silly."
MadMax,37mn8a,EdgarsTeethAreDry,3,Fri May 29 00:44:32 2015 UTC,"Oh I didn't mean super fucky, I meant the level of ambiguous that they are. I agree with you. It's not necessary."
MadMax,37mn8a,YeOldeBaconWhoure,2,Fri May 29 01:08:15 2015 UTC,"Alright, my bad. Yeah, you're right, though. The timelines being hazy works great because going back to the first movie, the series has always been about showing what you need to know, not explaining details and answering questions just in order to create an easily digestible and understandable ""universe"". Each movie having a different atmosphere maintains ambiguity that would be lost in a tighter timeline."
MadMax,37mn8a,EdgarsTeethAreDry,2,Fri May 29 01:17:53 2015 UTC,"I'm with you. I also kind of like that theory about how Mad Max is essentially halfway to being an urban legend in-universe and people make up/embellish stories about him. He's got a growing reputation in the first film, and things only escalate from there so it kind of makes sense that everything gets increasingly over-the-top and has wonky timelines. It's kind of like that ""James Bond is a codename and the new actors are different agents under the same name""-theory. It might not be canon, but it's a lot of fun."

This implies he blames Max for her death...--   Actually, Nux blamed himself. He was to one who wanted to take Max with him 'cause he needed the blood. So in a way, it was Nux' fault that Splendid died. Had he stayed in the Citadel, Max would have never met Furiosa etc. And that's where Nux failed big time. Immortan Joe would have never forgiven him, knowing it was Nux's blood bag that caused all the fuzz."

Joe crashed attempting to avoid her.  He didn't callously mow her down.  You could absolutely put all the blame on max."
MadMax,37keu0,leonryan,12,Thu May 28 10:10:17 2015 UTC,Nux is the real star of the film as far as I'm concerned.
MadMax,37keu0,Peanlocket,2,Thu May 28 12:42:45 2015 UTC,"After seeing it five times Nux is easily my favorite character. I tear up every time he flips the war rig, and lately every time Joe chromes his mouth."
MadMax,37keu0,Dritalin,10,Mon Jun 8 02:03:52 2015 UTC,"Nux and the warboys highlight just how much people want to be a part of something, even if they know that particular something is a sham.

Nobody would ever witness me if i tried to go out in a blaze of glory on the M1."
MadMax,37keu0,horticult,7,Thu May 28 15:28:21 2015 UTC,"Great write up, and I agree on most points!  I think Nux is the most interesting character and has the deepest character arc.  I was surprised too at how ""real"" the war boys are revealed to be, and how much more there was to them rather than being cannon fodder or mindless minions they're revealed to be characters with depth and background. Starting with Furiosa's wingman (the guy with the droopy mouth), then the guy from Prometheus that does the suicide leap (the first one to go all chrome-y), and then the relationship between Nux and Slit, you get a sense of these people as individuals and you see how thoroughly committed they are to their religion and Immortan Joe. By the end of the movie, you start feeling sorry for these guys."
MadMax,37keu0,LostSoulsAlliance,7,Thu May 28 20:20:46 2015 UTC,"They continue to be people, despite the best efforts to make them not. Against all odds, they are still human. Crazy, but human.   You hope things will be better for them under Furiosa. Joe didn't even blink when one of his Boyz jumped in front of a bullet for him. That's what he raised them for. They are expendable.   It's one of the most evil things he ever did."
MadMax,37keu0,CoruscantSunset,6,Thu May 28 20:32:55 2015 UTC,"""He saw it, he saw it all...my own blood bag driving the rig that killed her.""   Well, Max tells them that she 'went under the wheels'. This makes it sound like he meant the wheels of their own vehicle, before she then was hit by Immortan Joe's car.  I also don't really agree that Nux was still happy to die. I think by the end he was starting to realize it was all a pack of lies. I mean, he was helping them to overthrow the Immortan, so clearly he'd had a major change of heart about his religion.  I also don't remember him looking particularly happy about having to die, but his vehicle was crippled and Rictus (?) was a major threat to the safety of his new crew, so he sacrificed himself for them.  As I said already he seemed to me like he would have much rather been alive, but Nux knows that he's dying anyway (at the end of his half-life) so it would be better to have a useful death. But I'm thinking he probably didn't have much faith anymore that he was going to the chrome-plated Valhalla that Joe promised them anymore."
MadMax,37keu0,Bestpaperplaneever,6,Thu May 28 13:18:04 2015 UTC,"I think by the end he was starting to realize it was all a pack of lies. I mean, he was helping them to overthrow the Immortan, so clearly he'd had a major change of heart about his religion.   I would say he had a change of heart about his religious leader, not his religion, as the ""Witness me!"" mantra seemed to be connected to it. Like when Lex Luthor had a change of heart about the Pope, not about Megatron.  Maybe Joe isn't even the architect, or sole architect of the Wallhalla religion, but the first metalhead War Boys were, as Germanic mythology is incorporated in some forms of metal quite a bit."
MadMax,37keu0,LostSoulsAlliance,5,Thu May 28 20:05:07 2015 UTC,"Not to mention he wanted to save Capable, who I think he'd fallen in love with."
MadMax,37keu0,Dritalin,3,Thu May 28 20:07:32 2015 UTC,"I agree. I've seen the film five times and I think more and more he lost his will to die, he finally had something to live for."
MadMax,37keu0,CoruscantSunset,2,Mon Jun 8 03:35:40 2015 UTC,"That's it, exactly. Like when he's filling the cab of his coupe with gas and screaming, 'Witness me, bloodbag!' at Max early in the film he's ridiculously excited to die 'heroic on a fury road' and then when the time does come to die he whispers, 'Witness me' to Capable, I think her name is, but you can see all over his face that he'd be rather be continuing on with them.  I actually think it would be really interesting to see how they manage the Citadel once they take it over, because they're going to have quite the moral dilemma on their hands. There are a lot of half-lives living in the Citadel including the fact that it seems the army is made up almost entirely by half-lives (the war boys). In a post-apocalyptic world you couldn't survive long without your army, but the half-lives need full-life blood to live. Blood that they've just been taking up until this point.  Furiosa and the wives are all about people being free and no one owning anyone else, but without blood their war boys and probably other half-life citizens we never met are all going to die and I would guess there aren't a lot of full-lives out there who would just volunteer to be bloodbags."
MadMax,37keu0,nemothorx,5,Mon Jun 8 16:11:00 2015 UTC,"Loving your reviews! Keep them coming. (and please, keep linking back to the old ones, as I probably wont revisit them till your last)"
MadMax,37keu0,adventurefine,10,Thu May 28 09:01:49 2015 UTC,"Thanks for posting your thoughts! Nux is such a fun one to think/talk about.  I'm not sure I agree that Splendid's death is what turns Nux, at least not in the sense that it was a different kind of death than he has seen before. Nux has probably seen lots of senseless, non-glorious death out on raids like the one that ran Max down at the start. Splendid is beautiful and pregnant, but who she is doesn't seem to be at the center of his speech to Capable. If anything, what seems most important to Nux about Splendid is that she was precious to Immortan, and he fucked up big time.   All that stuff about the gates being open three times, it's all about him, losing his dream of going to Valhalla. That dream has to be crushed out of him before other things can step into the void. I think that's why he's so jazzed about getting the rig out of the mud. Failing in front of Joe broke him, but hey, turns out that amid the scattered pieces of his life's dream he can still do something cool. He's still worth a little something.    To be honest, I think we get lots of cues that a crush on Capable is a big motivator for his turn, as corny as some people find that. He doesn't get talked out of his faith, and the speech he gives Capable is still very much steeped in it. But then she touches his face, and for the rest of the movie he follows her around, making shy moon eyes at her and doing helpful things, rewarded by looks from her that say ""Yes, I'm proud of you"" and ""Come back safe"". The editing frames almost everything he does with looks between them, and of course that's particularly true of his final sacrifice.  Does he make that sacrifice for her? I've pondered this, because some people will say all he wanted is for her to witness him, etc. But I dunno. I think you're on the money there. He's still motivated by a desire for a meaningful, violent death rather than one by sickness. In a way, that's a standing motivation for him regardless of which side he's on. A kind of euthanasia. It seems to me that whatever attachment he has to the brides' cause in particular is heavily weighted by his connection with Capable. We just don't see him develop a fully realized, alternative world-view to the one he had as a War Boy. We see those dreams ripped away from him, and then we see him pluck up again at pleasures that can survive in the burnt shell of his life goals - Capable and doing fun shit with cars.  At any rate, I think I'm in the minority in thinking that Nux's loyalty to Furiosa's party is mostly a matter of having nothing better to do now that he's flunked out of Valhalla contention and attaching to the kind, beautiful girl who picks him up. I take it most people think he undergoes a deeper, more significant shift in his whole worldview, rejecting Joe's religion entirely and dedicating himself to the cause of a new world. But it's fascinating to discuss."
MadMax,37keu0,LostSoulsAlliance,8,Thu May 28 19:19:58 2015 UTC,"I agree. I think Nux still believed in Valhalla and a warrior's death, but he's irredeemable to Immortan Joe as far as he's concerned; plus Joe died which probably shocked Nux as he thought Joe was immortal.  He really does love Capable IMHO, and sacrificing himself accomplishes three things (which you touched on):   He saves Capable and her mission He gets redeemed and should be able to enter Valhalla (as far as he knows) He dies a glorious death ""historic on the Fury Road"" instead of succumbing to Larry and Barry and the night jitters."

MadMax,37keu0,eff1ngham,3,Thu May 28 23:45:02 2015 UTC,in order to participate in battle he improvises a way to take his healthy blood supply with him   I doubt that's much an improvisation. It's quite common in the world of Mad Max for captives to be strapped in front of vehicles.
MadMax,37keu0,adventurefine,7,Thu May 28 19:57:52 2015 UTC,"Max isn't a hostage who is supposed to intimidate a refinery of settlers into surrendering. And having him out there was unusual enough for the Immortan to think it work a second of his time to look over at him.  ..It goes by so quickly that I'm not 100% about it happening this way, but I think Nux's lancer (the one that's not Slit) was going to kill Max, against Nux's orders. They are about to drive into the sandstorm and Nux tells his guy to ""get that Blood Bag in!"" The guy unchains him, and there's a moment of relief on Max's part. The guy throws Max against the windshield and Max and Nux look at each-other...and Nux looks CONCERNED. He gives Max a look like, ""are you ok?"" and Max just looks incredulous, like, ""seriously?"" Especially since Max knows, even if Nux might not, that the lancer guy is going to kill Max and throw him off the car so Max throws him off first (and looses a boot in the process).   But if Nux notices the fate of his lancer, he doesn't let it slow him down any. He closes the sunroof, puts on his goggles, and gets ready to blow himself up."
MadMax,37keu0,Bestpaperplaneever,7,Thu May 28 20:24:26 2015 UTC,Nux has one of his front tires go flat and get pulled off the rim.  They need to move Max to the back to counterbalance the car so that the front rim is off the ground.  That's why they unchain him and try to move him to the lancer's perch
MadMax,37keu0,brianashe,3,Thu May 28 20:40:19 2015 UTC,"Good memory... so why does that guy seem ready to kill Max? (""Say goodbye to your neck!"") Is he planning to weight the car with his corpse, or is it because Max has already started fighting back?"

MadMax,37phq4,Turbofurball,2,Fri May 29 11:39:54 2015 UTC,"Yes it really was a terrible listicle. It also focuses on the world as it exists instead of Furiosa and the wives' fight against it. At least a few of the points don't make concessions for setting or plot development. Yes, the wives are all extremely attractive, but that fits within a feminist narrative--the patriarch chooses the attractive women to be his breeders. What do the wives do? They fight against said patriarch by escaping and fighting against him.   It's almost as if the list's problems arise from the fact that the movie doesn't start at the end. If women hold equal standing with men from the very beginning, then what's the conflict? ""Everything was perfect and nobody had any problems"" doesn't make for a compelling story."
MadMax,37phq4,BunchOAtoms,1 point,Fri May 29 14:10:44 2015 UTC,Absolutely!
MadMax,37phq4,Turbofurball,9,Fri May 29 14:19:27 2015 UTC,"Correct me if I'm wrong, but the point of feminism is not ""the woman taking all the decisions"". It's about E-Q-U-A-L-I-T-Y.   Also, the whole text was crap and had no point. Basically the writer thinks Fury Road is not a feminist film 'cause there are also men in it. The writer doesn't see the whole picture at all.  (Btw, I myself am a feminist.)"
MadMax,37phq4,ILiveIDieILiveAgain,8,Fri May 29 11:43:15 2015 UTC,"Exactly this. OP seems to think that feminism is about portraying female characters as flawless individuals in a world where women have no adverse circumstances to deal with. As for the last part, that's just unrealistic. The world has always been biased towards men (and this is coming from a man; there's no justice to it but it's true), so why would this be any different in a post-apocalyptic hellscape?  As for the female characters, of course they make bad decisions sometimes. So do the male characters. Equality is the word here. They're human beings and the film portrays them as such. The fact that Joe's harem are female is incidental, if he were gay, bisexual, pansexual etc and the group were male or a mix of the two, none of their decisions or actions would seem out of place.  Looking at Nux and Capable as a forced love story is overlooking what I consider to be the most important arc of the story, Nux's dis-indoctrination from the Warboy cult. He's been brought up taught that people are objects and the only thing to strive for is glorious death. Capable treats him like a person and through that, he learns to see people as people, not things.  Finally, Max doesn't save Furiosa. They save each other, and it doesn't make either of them a half-formed character. Max doesn't abandon her at the end, he sees that he's not needed and moves on, because that's what he does."

Which is caused by diet and lack of circulation. Which is yeah associated with wealth. Wealthy people drank a lot and laid around a lot on their fat asses.

MadMax,37iwbx,Broken_Goat,2,Thu May 28 18:13:42 2015 UTC,"Its just a regular ankle...  Gout is the solidifying of uric acid in joints. Its forms crystals in the joints and is very painful. Usually found in the big toe, but occasionally in the ankle, and other joints down there. (mines usually in my ankle). The crystals cause inflamation which is just swelling and what not. Its VERY VERY VERY painful. If that guy had it....he'd have either cut his leg off, or not been mobile at all. The slightest pressure...and its soooooo bad.   Remember when it was rumored that kim jong un had gout because he hadnt been seen in a while? Yeah, I was hoping he didnt have it. Its that painful. Not on my worst enemy kinda thing.   The good news is that gout can be controlled. Medicines such as allopurinol and cochicine can be used to help lower the uric acid levels but the real ""cure"" is diet change and weight loss. Less red meat, less high fructose corn syrup. etc etc etc.   Edit: forgot to answer about the jogging. I can jog, run, etc. Eventually if I have too many attacks, I will wear out the cartilage in the joints and itll be pretty shitty...but as of right now...uric acid levels are down, no gout attacks for a while, and I feel great."

Sometimes if I have a mild attack I can down a quart and in an hour my ankle will be fine. However Ill also be shitting my brains out. Small price to pay in my opinion.   If I sip on the cherry juice, no problems and the pain eventually goes away. It actually lowers the uric acid levels somehow."
MadMax,37iwbx,bryanlharris,1 point,Thu May 28 23:22:05 2015 UTC,"Okay I got another question!  Let's say you have an attack.  Then you drink the juice and it gets better.  Would it be wise at that point, to go for a jog in order to increase the circulation?  Or would that just move more of the uric acid to your problem area?"

MadMax,37mbxm,flynnski,2,Thu May 28 19:45:33 2015 UTC,"The ""160 days to cross"" equation, expanded upon /u/flynnski 's comment here: http://www.reddit.com/r/MadMax/comments/36o8a8/160_days_of_salt/crlqy8b  4 hours a day (stay out of the heat)   45 mph (reasonable offroad)   50 mpg (http://www.totalmotorcycle.com/MotorcycleFue.../1985-MPG.htm)  = 28800 miles, further than the ~25,000 mile circumference of the Earth  = 576 gallons of fuel, which would weigh over 3,600 lbs, not counting the weight of the tank, food, and water also needed."
MadMax,37mbxm,eff1ngham,1 point,Thu May 28 17:55:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah, 160 days is a long time. Figured they were hoping to find gas along the way."
MadMax,37mbxm,black_spring,1 point,Thu May 28 18:50:15 2015 UTC,"Well, for once I agree with the movie's plot point that turning around would be a better option."
MadMax,37mbxm,eff1ngham,1 point,Thu May 28 18:55:16 2015 UTC,Don't forget the extra fuel you need to pull that fuel (mileage decrease from the weight)!
MadMax,37mbxm,gthorpe92,2,Fri May 29 21:27:18 2015 UTC,"My guess is that if the countries are so desperate to destroy each other by the end of all the events leading up to this, that they would have bigger than 33 kiloton bombs.  I know there's a theoretical limit to how much material can actually be detonated, but I believe it's a pretty large amount based on some of the old cold war documentaries out there.  One other potential theory is that the oceans weren't boiled away by nuclear/atomic weapons, but actually evaporated by chemical or some other kind of weapon in an attempt to starve out other nations of their water resources and create man-made famine.  It's a bit of a reach.  My last though on it, is that not the entire ocean has been evaporated.  But only portions.  Remember that most of the people left in The Wasteland probably have not been to the coast in sometime.  The oceans may have receded, but not entirely been boiled off."
MadMax,37mbxm,Flyberius,2,Thu May 28 18:20:12 2015 UTC,"Evaporation requires energy, no matter where that energy comes from.  Evaporating water using chemicals implies the use of chemical energy, which would require orders of magnitude more energy than if you use energy-dense nuclear bombs to do the job.  The most likely scenario would be to intentionally drive global warming to the point that the oceans boil away due to the trapped solar energy, but there's no way ANY life would survive that.  Also, I anticipated that only some portions of oceans would evaporate.  It's still a ludicrous amount of weapons required.  I can't find a source for how much fissile material is in the world, but I'd bet you could spend the entire U.S. military's budget scouring the Earth for materials and manufacturing bombs for a lifetime and still not reach the required levels."
MadMax,37mbxm,skonen_blades,2,Thu May 28 18:54:12 2015 UTC,"Bill Nye's theory makes the most sense to me. Due to nuclear war, the Earth's atmosphere underwent a change that caused the displacement of water, basically shifting us towards a Mars-like environment. On Mars, water traces can be found, but underground. Keep im mind that in FR the only water we see has been pumped up to the surface by Joe."

Max or Furiosa?  I want to say Furiosa.  BTW, I think ""Razor Cola"" is the best name for a vehicle yet. Where did you read that?"
MadMax,37kksf,nemothorx,4,Thu May 28 09:53:03 2015 UTC,"Furiosa was driving. Max was hanging off the side of the rig, Nux was under the cab.    I read it on the Mad Max Movies forum where a few of the people who worked on the movie (people that designed and built some of the cars, etc) comment every so often. Interestingly enough, Razor Cola was originally going to be a character -- one of the Bullet Farmer's henchman, seen in this concept art on the right -- but he was written out and the name was given to the scavenged Interceptor.    Fun fact: of the 75+ main vehicles used in the film, practically all of them had names and backstories."
MadMax,37kksf,elsiniestro,6,Thu May 28 12:26:48 2015 UTC,"People Eater died from 2-3 bullets from Immortan Joe's pistol. One in the hand, at least one in the face."

MadMax,37hbuz,skonen_blades,3,Thu May 28 00:40:45 2015 UTC,I was wondering the same thing. I am just guessing its a different character. He does not appear in the next two movies after being the Toecutter. There is no background on him in Fury Road so you can make your own assumption. Maybe keeping it a mystery was done on purpose.
MadMax,37hbuz,spider_cereal,2,Thu May 28 02:59:55 2015 UTC,Like the autogyro pilot being portrayed by the same actor who would then go on and play the fixed wing aircraft pilot with a similar personality.
MadMax,37hbuz,Bestpaperplaneever,33,Thu May 28 18:56:00 2015 UTC,I thought there was something very essentially sweet about him. How many other post apocalyptic warlords would give their incredibly deformed child a shot at life?

MadMax,37hbuz,Doof_Warrior,3,Thu May 28 04:30:35 2015 UTC,Exactly. He has a side we didn't get to see much of. Perhaps in the prequel we get a little glimps of him tottering about on a calm Sunday morning.

MadMax,37hbuz,DiogenesTheHound,5,Wed May 27 18:14:56 2015 UTC,I'm hoping it'll be a prequel. Just so we can get the interceptor on screen
MadMax,37hbuz,herrsteely,5,Wed May 27 19:05:22 2015 UTC,Did it blow up? It was hard to tell because the gas tanker was shooting flames. It kinda got sandwiched and fell back. He could probably still fix it up.
MadMax,37hbuz,nemothorx,3,Wed May 27 20:23:25 2015 UTC,I don't know about that. The chassis would be screwed. I don't think even max could straighten out that mess. Besides the war boys had already messed with it. The supercharger was swapped for some oversized stack and the paint job was ruined!  Miller is a sick man. That's twice we've had to watch the last of the V8s die :(  Can you imagine being a star wars fan and watching chewy die in the empire strikes back. Get brought back in the force awakens and die 2 mins in?
MadMax,37hbuz,herrsteely,2,Wed May 27 21:23:39 2015 UTC,twice just in this movie!  'OMG you killed the Interceptor. You bastards!'
MadMax,37hbuz,Retlaw83,2,Wed May 27 22:28:55 2015 UTC,Yes your right! 3 times!   The humanity of it!  I don't know of another franchise that kills off a popular Co star 3 times!  Thinking about it. It's an interedting point. The interceptor is so recognisable and so popular. But it was only in mad max for the last 15-20 mins or so. In the road warrior it was destroyed and had only 1 chase at the beginning then spent most of its time parked up. Didn't appear at all in thunderdome and was destroyed twice and had 5 minutes screen time in the third forth!  Edit:whoops!  If it was an actor they would have been almost an extra!  Just goes to show how awesome it is. 30 mins of screen time in 7 hours of film and it's just as famous as the batmobile or the general lee!
MadMax,37hbuz,herrsteely,2,Wed May 27 23:17:00 2015 UTC,"The Interceptor in Fury Road is a similar, but different car than the one in Road Warrior. There's only one gas tank, and the headlight covers are different. It's also an Ford XB Fairmont GT while the original was a Ford Falcon XB."
MadMax,37hbuz,darksiderising,1 point,Wed May 27 23:28:53 2015 UTC,I imagine it was difficult finding Falcon XB GTs there aren't many left now and are very expensive. And i cant see the current owners of any stock XBs wanting to part with them knowing it's going to get destroyed.  That's probably why they used fairmonts   I think the original interceptor is in the US and is in pretty bad shape :( it used to be in the uk until a few years ago.
MadMax,37hbuz,SirCannonFodder,1 point,Wed May 27 23:41:40 2015 UTC,I thought the car that he dives/slides over when the Warboys are chasing him was his car being repaired or scrapped. I thought he hesitated because of that. Is that wrong?
MadMax,37hbuz,Slavicinferno,2,Wed May 27 23:21:03 2015 UTC,"That's correct, but later in the movie (around the time they're getting attacked by the People Eater in his gas tanker) we see it resurrected in War Boy fashion, with a monstrously large engine sticking out the bonnet, and the body sanded to its base metal."
MadMax,37hbuz,IdiotsLantern,3,Fri May 29 03:21:25 2015 UTC,There were still LOTS of warboys out there. And Gas town and bullet town to worry about.

MadMax,37hbuz,hydraEvolved,10,Wed May 27 19:59:32 2015 UTC,It was a perfect death. She hooked it to his mask and then chained it to the wheel. A quick and easy death to show just how mortal the Immortan was.
MadMax,37hbuz,compacta_d,10,Wed May 27 20:14:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah pretty much. Miller subverts a lot of tropes in the latest movie. so Immortan Joe's death was done and over with, no long monologue or fanfare."

MadMax,37hq4l,HoustonsSolution,2,Wed May 27 19:50:09 2015 UTC,Does the cloth on many of them help protect the parts or is it just an aesthetic decision?
MadMax,37hq4l,NoigelArcane,6,Wed May 27 20:43:13 2015 UTC,"It's almost entirely aesthetic.  Even on pre-apocalyptic bikes, there is more thought given to protecting the rider from hazards such as engine heat than protecting the bike.  The only common bike-protecting parts I see are bash plates, located at the bottom front of the frame, and hand guards to protect the controls.  In a desert, you would only really need to protect against falls, protect the air intake from sand (all bikes already have air filters that would work well enough), and protect the lights/rider from kicked up sand and rocks.  No one seems to care much about personal protection, though, and off-road bikes are tough as hell."

MadMax,37kyn4,IncogMLR,8,Thu May 28 11:40:34 2015 UTC,"probably a combination of reasons.  partially because they're a bit anaemic, partially because it protects against the sun, partially to emulate Immortan Joe who is sickly and wears powder to protect his skin, and partially as a religious observance."
MadMax,37kyn4,leonryan,9,Thu May 28 11:54:12 2015 UTC,"On top of what was already said by /u/leonryan, they have a sort of death-worship culture. Nux's face is not only painted like a skull, but it's also been cut into the appearance of a skull.  One of the wives mentions that Nux is 'at the end of his half-life', so Nux is dying and he looks like he's only in his late teens or early twenties, so they're a people who live all the time with death and are pretty obsessed with it. So in that context it makes sense to me that white corpse-like skin would be an aesthetic they would admire.  Plus, intimidation is probably another reason. They go out on a fury road against some enemy and that enemy sees a whole army of white and black painted war-boys coming at them, all eager to sacrifice themselves in battle. Some people would shit themselves."
MadMax,37kyn4,CoruscantSunset,4,Thu May 28 13:26:16 2015 UTC,Some people?
MadMax,37kyn4,Bestpaperplaneever,4,Thu May 28 20:24:24 2015 UTC,"Well, the people in the Mad Max universe seem pretty much unimpressed by everything!"
MadMax,37kyn4,CoruscantSunset,4,Thu May 28 21:28:33 2015 UTC,"It's powder/makeup.  Possibly a form of sunscreen, possible a form of medicine for the tumours.  It makes them looks like corpses and they're obsessed with the half-life Valhalla action so that helps.  It's also cool war paint.  From an art direction standpoints, it also helps differ them from the gastown boys dressed in black and the bullet farmer boys painted yellow."
MadMax,37kyn4,skonen_blades,2,Thu May 28 16:26:37 2015 UTC,"Just in case you didn't realize it, they ""paint"" themselves with white powder."
MadMax,37j8ax,morecomplete,5,Thu May 28 00:52:58 2015 UTC,that really annoyed me.  i loved the movie but in MM2 there was just a few guns in the world and nobody had any ammo.  in this Furiosa has a truck full of semi auto pistols.  i wish she'd had more clever boobytraps and makeshift weapons instead of pristine storebought handguns.  that's the one area where the creativity was lacking.  they could have had so many cool home made bazookas and crossbows and things instead.  things that operate on springs and wires and petrol and steam pressure.
MadMax,37j8ax,leonryan,8,Thu May 28 01:44:35 2015 UTC,"I kinda agree. I think the guns were somewhat justifiable because of who had them. The bullet farmers, members of the Citadel, and other members of power. They are more likely to be able to get their hands on guns. Max still lacked weaponry and so did other low ranking members."
MadMax,37j8ax,HoustonsSolution,7,Thu May 28 01:49:29 2015 UTC,yeah particularly when Joe and the Bullet Farmer were ex-military.  Maybe they dragged a cache out into the wasteland with them.  I hope the next movie has a little more imagination regarding weapons though.
MadMax,37j8ax,leonryan,5,Thu May 28 01:54:02 2015 UTC,Furiosa did have a hand crossbow. She used it in the beginning of the movie before her crew figured out she had deserted.  It doesn't appear again after that.
MadMax,37j8ax,cityratbuddy,2,Thu May 28 07:35:01 2015 UTC,"Also, the Buzzards had no explosives or guns at all"
MadMax,37j8ax,Turbofurball,2,Thu May 28 12:44:03 2015 UTC,"Are the Buzzards the ones with spiky cars, or the motorcyclists?  If the latter, they did have explosives - they kept tossing grenades."

MadMax,37j8ax,Turbofurball,3,Thu May 28 13:30:23 2015 UTC,"The War Rig is essentially their battleship.  It wouldn't make sense to have your most valuable resource defended with anything but the best.  Many of the other cars are equipped with nothing but a lancer and some makeshift explosions.  The Bullet Farmer is the one with all the guns, from the looks of what the Citadel has available, they are putting most of what they can afford to send out on the War Rig"
MadMax,37j8ax,eff1ngham,1 point,Thu May 28 19:13:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but out of all those guns they only had a handful of ammo it seemed."
MadMax,37j8ax,Forcedwits,3,Thu May 28 07:44:54 2015 UTC,"only in that one scene where they were taking inventory.  there was no shortage of it when they were actually using it.  i mean it's fair enough because the bullet farm exists so of course ammo is being produced and they don't have to rely purely on scavenging, but it still detracts from the hopelessness of the wasteland a little.  resources used to be rare and vital, and now guns and bullets don't seem to be bound by that rule anymore."
MadMax,37j8ax,leonryan,4,Thu May 28 07:51:45 2015 UTC,"I guess it's like in The Road Warrior, gas is hard to come by, but everyone is wasting."
MadMax,37j8ax,Forcedwits,2,Thu May 28 07:59:55 2015 UTC,"It's a bit silly if you stop and think about it. In the opening of the Road Warrior we see Max is so desperate for gas that he tries soaking up some with a handkerchief.  Then we see what Max does on a typical day - he drives around aimlessly, exploring and scavenging.  You'd think he'd switch to a better gas mileage vehicle if nothing else!"
MadMax,37j8ax,cityratbuddy,2,Thu May 28 14:27:47 2015 UTC,"Yup, and Humungus' gang just drive around the complex instead of positioning themselves at a safe distance."

MadMax,37j8ax,cityratbuddy,2,Thu May 28 07:35:56 2015 UTC,"Looks like I need to watch it again. lol. There was so much going on I must have missed the crossbows. As for the MP5, if it was a 70s version, I could see, or an AK. Appeared to be a more modern 90s version. All of this is explainable, just brought continuity into question. Nitpicky, I know. Just something I noticed that seemed sort of out of sync with the other movies."
MadMax,37j8ax,cityratbuddy,1 point,Thu May 28 13:42:52 2015 UTC,"I'm down with nitpicking.  Let's nitpick.  First off, here's Furiosa firing the crossbow:  http://www.imfdb.org/wiki/File:CrossBow_and_Grenade_Launcher_-_Mad_Max_Fury_Road.jpg  I checked imfdb, and it says that generation 2 & 3 glocks were used as props.  http://www.imfdb.org/wiki/Mad_Max:_Fury_Road#Glock_17  We have to wonder when the apocalypse happened in the MM universe.  If it's late 70s or early 80s (going by dates of the first 2 movies) then Glock wasn't available to anyone.  This could mean that the apocalypse happened in the 90s, after generation 3 glocks came out.  Is there any reason to think it happens any specific decade?"
MadMax,37j8ax,tortugaborracho,2,Thu May 28 14:25:17 2015 UTC,"""Is there any reason to think it happens any specific decade?""  Well yes, going by everything else in the wasteland, specifically, the cars. Where are the 80s and 90's vehicles?"
MadMax,37j8ax,eff1ngham,2,Thu May 28 14:58:17 2015 UTC,"I know more about guns than cars, so I'll have to take your word for it. That is a breakdown in continuity, but I'll forgive Miller."
MadMax,37j8ax,cloneboy99,2,Thu May 28 15:02:17 2015 UTC,"I suppose you could toss up the lack of 80s-90s cars to it being easier to maintain older-model, more mechanical engines as opposed to more complicated later model ones?  I'm not a huge car person, but didn't electronic engine controls really begin getting popular and common in the mid-80s. If we assume the apocalypse had some kind of atomic weapon aspect, possibly including an atmospheric detonation for EMP effect, then those electronic components would be useless, right?   The gun thing does irritate me. It was my first reaction when that Glock came out on screen to think ""What the hell is THAT doing here?"""
MadMax,37j8ax,LongHorsa,2,Thu May 28 16:50:51 2015 UTC,"Okay yeah, we could chalk it up to the older cars being easier to maintain, sure, or maybe even the need for older engines that will run on leaded gas. Still, the frames, bodies, and other spare parts from 80-90s vehicles would still be very useful.   I’m more of a car guy than a motorcycle guy but it would be interesting to see if there were any 80s or 90s motorcycles in Fury Road. Some of them did look more modern looking than their previous counterparts but like I said, I don’t know much about motorcycles.   In any case, I’m glad I'm not the only one who had that reaction to seeing a Glock on screen. Lol."
MadMax,37j8ax,cityratbuddy,1 point,Thu May 28 17:30:52 2015 UTC,"There are no 80's and 90s vehicles in Mad Max and Mad Max 2 because of the dates they were made (1979 and 1981 respectively).    Thunderdome is the move that takes place after WWIII in the series.  The majority of the cars are custom made from whatever people could happen to find.  Max's camel wagon most likely is a 75 Ford XB mounted onto an F-150 chassis for example.  Fury Road takes the customization even farther.  Even though many of the cars may have a modified body of one car, they are clearly just custom built from what's still available.  Nux's car is clearly not using an original 34 Chevy engine.  The Big Foot is running on regular 42 Dodge parts.  There are a few late model types of cars though, there's a 78 Charger, and early 80s Mack truck (cab at least), and the MAN Kat1 (the buzzard truck with the front end loader attached to the back) and the MAN 8x8 Doof Wagon are quite possibly from the late 70s early 80s.  One last though on why there's no 80 or 90s cars (an mentioned by tortugaborracho), anything from the 80s or 90s requires more mechanical upkeep.  A 60s or 70s V8 can be fixed an maintained with very little effort.  So yes while a Hummer H2 or even a Ford F250 might make a scary vehicle, you can essentially take an old V8 from any car in the 70s and make it work."
MadMax,37j8ax,LongHorsa,1 point,Thu May 28 19:07:55 2015 UTC,The entire Mad Max trilogy doesn't provide any dates except for one: 10th of September 1999. It is the day Captain Walker left The Crack In The Earth along with other adults from the crashed Boeing 747 in search of civilization. George Miller revealed in an interview [1] from 1984 that the events of the first two movies took place some odd 15 years from then. This would place the first two movies in the mid to late 90's. Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome takes place 15-18 years after which puts it in 2014 - 2018.    http://madmax.wikia.com/wiki/Timeline_of_events

MadMax,37j8ax,DiaboliAdvocatus,3,Thu May 28 06:13:49 2015 UTC,"The MP5 has been around a long time, but that particular model is from the early 90s. If the apocalypse happened in the 80s then it's a continuity error."
MadMax,37j8ax,Derpatologist_7,2,Thu May 28 17:09:28 2015 UTC,"If the apocalypse happened in the 80s then it's a continuity error.   There is no reason to think it happened in the '70s/'80s. A date was never given in the first movie. They use '70s/'80s gear but you can pass that off as either a quirk of when the movie was made, or as society devolving due to the resource war and being forced to use older equipment that is easier to maintain with local skills (eg no silicon foundry to build new engine control chips).  In the just released comics the oil wars are dated as 2001 and the water war as 2025."

You're definitely right about the cars escorting the Rig at the start, though; in the main trailer, if you pause right at 1:23 you can see what looks pretty clearly like a .50 machine gun on the car that was ahead of her, and the same flip is shown from the front at 2:06, where you can see the ammo box.

Haven't dynoed it yet but from what the stock engine makes (256hp brand new 20 year ago) + 7lbs of boost from the SC I'd say between 240hp - 260hp at the wheels.  Side pipes, neg.

The problem is when things are in a certain way because there is a political message behind it: and between chastity belts, messages on the walls, seeds at the end of the movie and the overall labeling of men=evil and women=good troughout the whole movie, it cant be denied there is a subtext."
MadMax,37gygd,Origami84,1 point,Thu May 28 16:09:51 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say that. Even the ""good"" people are pretty bad, Furiosa and Max have no qualms about brutally murdering people, neither do any of the Vuvalini. The only true ""bad"" person is Immortan Joe.

MadMax,37gygd,donvito,6,Wed May 27 18:55:44 2015 UTC,"Sorry but this is dumb.  Before a coworker saw the movie, he had read some article on a conservative website attacking the movie for all its political agendas or maybe feminism agendas or whatever they claimed.  My explanation was ""It's just a movie, you trade money for two hours of fun.  Not everything has an agenda.  You're not supposed to analyze it."""
MadMax,37gygd,bryanlharris,1 point,Wed May 27 21:16:14 2015 UTC,"Even without misterious secondary objectives, there can be a subtext that you really cant like. The constant labeling of men=evil and women=good was really cringy-worthy in FR. Oh well, at least the action scenes are good."
MadMax,37gygd,Origami84,0,Thu May 28 16:07:42 2015 UTC,"Maybe you're just reading too much into it.  All this talk about subtext reminds me of an episode of South Park where the kids write a book about disgusting acts and the grown ups think there is a hidden meaning (but there isn't).   https://en.wikipedia.org./wiki/The_Tale_of_Scrotie_McBoogerballs    Although the South Park boys wrote The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs simply to shock and offend people, readers delve too deeply into the meaning behind the book, finding hidden allegories and symbolism that the actual authors insist are not present.[4] People with conflicting philosophies, including liberals and conservatives, and pro-choice and pro-life advocates, attempt to claim that the same work conveys and validates their own ideology.[5] The script serves as a criticism of people who take such works of pop culture too seriously.[1][4][5] Although this is demonstrated specifically through literary criticism in the episode, the theme can be extended to film criticism and television criticism as well.[2][5] The episode suggests people are so desperate for inspiration, they are willing to impose their hopes and dreams into works of art, even if they completely lack those qualities.   Any of the stuff you're attributing to men=evil & women=good can be explained much easier by saying they just thought it would make the story work better, or that they wanted to appeal to female audience members, or that they simply didn't even think of it that way.  There's probably no hidden agenda.  TL;DR - Maybe the movie is just supposed to be fun."
MadMax,37gygd,bryanlharris,2,Thu May 28 17:09:49 2015 UTC,"You too have your reasons, but it cant all be imagined. Beside, the director for MM-RF also involved the activist and playwriter (vagina's monologue) Enler exactly to give it a feminist touch. It is possible, though, that some of what i saw in it was due more of all these articles online that are trying to dig into the movie, than what i actually saw on the screen itself. Meh."
MadMax,37gygd,Origami84,2,Thu May 28 19:31:15 2015 UTC,"Conversely Enler has been attacked by third wave feminists for not being a proper feminist.

It's feminist in the sense that Furiosa and the other women are actually given something to do in a blockbuster action film. They're not just there to stand and look pretty in revealing outfits.  Now do this for the majority of other blockbusters and let us know your results.
MadMax,37gygd,VforVickers,3,Thu May 28 05:46:24 2015 UTC,"Exactly.  An actress in a typical 90s Tom Cruise movie had one job: bang Tom Cruise to make him look straight.

In mad max universe if you have a talent you exploit it. Whether that's fighting, driving, fixing stuff, maths or sex.  Of course there'll be sexual violence but that would be on both sexes.  Eg mad max (original) the two in the hotrod that try to out run the gang. He's seen running away naked from the waist down. She's chained but clothed (probably as not to take away from the situation. A naked woman could sexualise the scene) but they were both victims of rape. Or at least that's how i read it.  I would expect the vulvani would keep male sex slaves if the situation was reversed. They would want to repopulate just like Joe. If guys weren't willing or trusted (they showed they didnt trust men) they would be chained up. It's just hard to portray a good guys gang having sex slaves."

MadMax,37gphf,vvarpidgeon,1 point,Wed May 27 23:20:41 2015 UTC,Thanks! The problem was that there are very few shots in the trailers that are long enough for that slower build up part.

MadMax,37gphf,HoustonsSolution,1 point,Wed May 27 23:49:16 2015 UTC,Ah ok I see.

MadMax,37gc0f,donvito,-3,Wed May 27 19:56:37 2015 UTC,I think they didn't understand the spirit of Fury Road. Instead of an action packed road battle with explosions and spikey cars they made some open world RPG where you have to build your car and scavange for parts and ... *snore*
MadMax,37gc0f,Othy,6,Wed May 27 13:48:28 2015 UTC,I think they captured the idea of the second film where we see max collecting gas in a pan and eating dog food. The idea of the apocalypse was more more prevalent in road warrior than fury road.
MadMax,37gc0f,EatADickClark,1 point,Wed May 27 18:38:12 2015 UTC,"Exactly this. The developers also said in some interview that wanted to try and separate the Mad Max game from the movies, and try to create their own Mad Max story.

MadMax,37gc0f,CurtBaboon,3,Wed May 27 20:11:31 2015 UTC,"They weren't going for Fury Road's atmosphere. This is more derivative of the Road Warrior/Beyond Thunderdome style as far as the world they depict goes.

The fact that he speaks well and clearly strongly suggests he did have jaw/tongue/teeth of some sort, but the fact that we never saw it definitely implied he was deformed in some way."
MadMax,37g0it,IDGAF1203,3,Wed May 27 11:04:44 2015 UTC,"I don't agree on the deformed part, maybe they are deformed or maybe not. It's Miller's decision to let us guessing.  I don't think it replaces any part because at the beginning we clearly see him wearing it, imho the face ripping occurs more for the grappling that Furiosa uses, she hook it to one side of the mask and with the force of the wheel it rips apart all the lower side of immortan face, the grappling does the ripping, not the mask. Of course Miller shows it like a whole, for us Immortan only wears a mask, only after he dies we see a deformed version of his face, i believe there's some thinking behind this decision."

Here's the actor who played the cop, Charlie, from the first movie who gets his throat injured: http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0507982/?ref_=ttfc_fc_cl_t29  No mention of Beyond Thunderdome in there.  Besides Pigkiller I know there was another slave who was shown two or three times but he's never named."
MadMax,37g0it,Keroman,2,Thu May 28 01:54:04 2015 UTC,"It may not actually be the case. My source is a question on this website:  http://www.madmaxmovies.com/mad-max-beyond-thunderdome/goofs-and-trivia/index.html   Is that Charlie (Mad Max 1) working in the underworld of Bartertown? Just after Max meets Pig Killer, he walks past another worker who looks amazinly like Charlie. What's odd is that this guy looks up and follows Max, as if he knows him - in addition to which the camera stays locked on him, instead of following Max. Check it out - I don't know for sure if it's the same actor, he doesn't have a speaking part, and doesn't appear to be credited.  Anyone know for sure?"
MadMax,37g0it,Bestpaperplaneever,1 point,Thu May 28 19:03:45 2015 UTC,"To be fair the camera lingers on several inconsequential people in the film.  There's like 3 different shots of a random mechanic looking guy wearing a cap and a surprised expression during the first Underworld scene, particularly during the methane embargo.  I think shots like that are just meant to be reaction shots to help set the tone for the audience, not to be like, ""Hey, recognize this guy? wink wink"""

Villains with hidden faces are not a new thing; its a well established trope used to de-humanize them (I.e. Horse teeth). Vader, Humongous, Blaster, to name a few. All of those also hid their faces to shroud deformities that might have made them more pitiable (burns, burns, and retardation, respectively).  I think a deformity is the only thing that would explain the mask's total encompassing of his lower face. Its ceremonial in some ways, like his armor, meant to hide his less-than-healthy features from his subjects in order to prop up his god status."

MadMax,37g0it,CoruscantSunset,2,Thu May 28 14:20:08 2015 UTC,"I think his face is whole, but the mask is indicative of the physical defects of him and his offspring. Maybe I missed it, but the only two people I remember calling him dad/father were handicapped. That was also possibly part of why the loss of a child that was ""perfect"" was such a blow to Joe and the son that wore the filter apparatus on his back. The fact that he was ""perfect"" was emphasized."
MadMax,37g0it,coyotetom,2,Wed May 27 20:42:02 2015 UTC,"This confused me also. When I first saw the scene where it was ripped off his face I thought that it was permanently attached and he needed it for survival.

MadMax,37kiqp,InjunJ03,-4,Thu May 28 08:53:31 2015 UTC,it could always be both.  say max goes off to be alone and one day weeks later spots a car on the horizon with buzzards circling it.  he goes to investigate thinking he might be able to scavenge something worthwhile and discovers one of the Brides dying in the car who tells him that Furiosa is besieged in the citadel against impossible odds and sneaked her out with a hang glider or something to look for help or weapons.  max is faced with letting furiosa fend for herself and possibly die or he can go back and assist.  a few more ghost visions guilt trip him into redeeming himself for abandoning them and there you have it.  perfectly good mad max story which still covers the fate of furiosa and the citadel.
MadMax,37kiqp,JimmyDaGent,4,Thu May 28 09:00:25 2015 UTC,"Not to criticize...but thats just too cliche of a storyline to fit the mad max world. Too many beaten to death tropes....id be surprised if we see the same cast again at all, I could be wrong obviously"

Toecutter and Immortan Joe are both played by Hugh Keays-Byrne, that doesn't mean that they're the same character.  This bit from an interview with Bruce Spence seems to confirm them being different characters (the part about Mad Max is at the end):   The stumbling block was finding a character that was like me but not me, as it was another story. Anyway I got the call and it was described to me as being sort of like the character I played in “The Road warrior” but not like him – if you see what I mean."
MadMax,37kiqp,InjunJ03,2,Thu May 28 09:57:11 2015 UTC,all it means is a siege in the most heavily fortified position in the wasteland.  if they let all the sick people below up into the towers they're set forever.  they can relax and feast on milk and lettuce while the hostile army below shoots at rocks and starves to death.

MadMax,37bong,Heksekongen,66,Tue May 26 13:13:12 2015 UTC,"This little fact in the title is actually not true. There's tons of CG, just most of it is 'invisible'. Making tires rotate when they shot on still vehicles. Moving arms. Even replacing Charlize Theron's mouth when they couldn't get the shot.   George Miller isn't shy about VFX. Even more post-happy than a lot of directors. The difference is he wants the final frame to feel real.   Let's not forget all the VFX guys who also worked on this amazing film!

MadMax,37bong,floatvoid,16,Tue May 26 15:42:12 2015 UTC,"Things like replacing a character's mouth or digitally painting out skies and harnesses and the like, or moving tires or that kind of thing... they really have nothing to do with the actual feat being performed on camera.   When you see someone dangling under a semi truck, there really is a person dangling under a semi-truck. When Tom Hardy is hanging upside down inches from giant rotating wheels, he's really there. That's a person and not a dummy strapped to the front of that car. That woman is clinging to the side of a real vehicle in a real desert.  There are obviously a lot of effects in the movie, but they are all used to enhance, rather then replace, the actual feats being performed by actual people.   What people forget about CGI is that it's supposed to be a last resort. It's what you fall back on when you have no other way to get the shot you need. The problem with falling back on CGI is people are so excited about being able to have everything that they forget that sometimes NOT seeing a digital double of the pregnant woman go under the wheels of the giant truck is more powerful then anything you could have put on camera."

MadMax,37bong,floatvoid,4,Tue May 26 23:14:34 2015 UTC,"I know you didn't, I'm sorry if I implied otherwise. CGI is all in how it's used. Max's CGI served to accomplish things that couldn't be done live, like Furiosa's arm, and make possible stunts that couldn't be done safely without some kind of harness there to make sure everyone was secure. That is using CGI properly.   Compare that to Jurrasic World, or the goofy Terminator Genysis trailer and you'll see the differance. Sometimes you really do just need to blow up the truck."

MadMax,37bong,TheKrakenArises,12,Tue May 26 17:31:03 2015 UTC,"There's a quote in the video I linked by cinematographer John Seale. Basically, there was a wide shot where George Miller liked the frame, but the dialogue was a different line, so they shot her mouth close and replaced it on the wide shot."
MadMax,37bong,floatvoid,2,Tue May 26 17:38:53 2015 UTC,"They did a similar thing in the final cut of Blade Runner. There was a moment in all of the previous versions where Harrison Ford's line didn't match his lips due to a change in the script made after the scene was already shot. So they took Harrison's son Ben, gave him a fake scar on the chin recorded him delivering his dad's line and then replaced Harrison's mouth with Ben's. It's a pretty small thing in the grand scheme of things, but for some reason I find it mighty impressive."

MadMax,37bong,reece1495,18,Wed May 27 01:05:09 2015 UTC,"I heard that while the latest Transformers movie had like 648 VFX shots, Fury Road had like 612.  So not too far away from Transformers.  The CG was just done WELL, showcasing the stunts and not replacing them.  Shoring up the actors and cars, not ruining them.  Immortan Joe's rock formation palace for instance was totally CGI, I heard.  Still very well done, though."

MadMax,37bong,NSNIA,16,Tue May 26 18:06:15 2015 UTC,I was watching 'Man of Steel' on Netflix yesterday (first time I've seen it since going to the cinema).

MadMax,37bong,damstr,1 point,Wed May 27 15:05:58 2015 UTC,I think the main thing is all the main action parts aren't 100% CGI. Using CGI for small FX to complete the scene is acceptable. For example people loved Alien and Aliens but hated Alien 3. Why? Because the Alien was all CGI in Alien 3. It didn't bother me too much but if you are going to to CGI everything better look fluid and realistic.   Avengers 2 opening looked so damn fake and unbelievable it was sad. It instantly set the stage for a movie that will be overloaded with CGI and made it disappointing. It wasn't even good looking CGI either!
MadMax,37bong,M3n747,3,Wed May 27 00:21:17 2015 UTC,"Actually, the alien in Alien 3 was a puppet. It looked fake because the light on the creature didn't match the lighting of the sets."

MadMax,37eig3,sstevenlynch,7,Wed May 27 01:16:13 2015 UTC,"Honestly, for me it was the car carrier that left the Citadel loaded with war boys and came back loaded with wrecked vehicles. It shows how expendable the war boys are (they brought spares!) and how nothing that can be reused/rebuilt is ever just thrown away.   In fact, the only material object in the entire movie that I can recall that was just discarded offhand was Max's muzzle, and even that was a garden fork that had already been rebuilt/repurposed."

Plus if you think about it this and Fury Road are possibly the two most connected pieces of media in the Mad Max universe. You've got the War Boys, the Buzzards, Immortan's son, Scrotus, heck even something called Thunderdome plus.  Just think of it as a mash up of all good things Mad Max.

MadMax,37btel,OnlyHopeIV,2,Wed May 27 07:12:01 2015 UTC,"A writer for Kotaku got to play some of the game. He said that the car driving was fun as was the customization, but as a whole, the game is really devoid of anything worth while. Lots of monotonous objectives to complete over and over again. Really low frame rate on some of the bigger car chases/battles. Empty plot/characters, bad combat mechanics, etc.  Granted, it is Kotaku, so take that with a grain of salt and it does sound like he played a Beta of the game, but it doesn't sound promising, IMO.  EDIT: I skimmed the article that I was referencing and upon reading it in better detail realized I had clearly misread the tone of the piece and also apparently saw or interpreted things that weren't true. My apologies for spreading misinformation. Paraphrasing something you skimmed is a bad move. I've also taken the liberty of downvoting myself for such practices. Thanks for calling me out on my bullshit, OP."
MadMax,37btel,Tidjay,6,Tue May 26 17:08:53 2015 UTC,"Hah I just read that article. The objective thing is in practically every game its just an achievement tracker which can be turned off in most games.  The fuck are you talking about ""bad combat mechanics."" The guy at Kotaku said: This is all too bad, because the hand-to-hand combat is really fun—basically the Arkham games with more brutal weapons and guns—and it’s quite satisfying to drive around smashing into enemy Warboys (who are way less entertaining when they’re mindless NPCs). There’s a ton of stuff to do, from chasing down enemy convoys to sniping baddies out of the back of Max’s car, but so much of it feels like it’s in the game to hit some sort of arbitrary list of features—look what you can do!—rather than to create a meaningful experience.  Sure the type of game won't appeal to everyone but you have to understand that this was a demo and he wouldn't have experienced the full deal plus its not even a finished game as of yet so ill let them slide on the frame rate stuff.  You're also a fucking liar because he didn't say jack shit about plot or characters.  You should never judge a game too early no matter if it seems good or bad but what youre doing is pretty shitty to make up details and blame them on the ""Kotaku writer."""

MadMax,37btel,-ArthurDent-,10,Tue May 26 14:31:40 2015 UTC,"I think it possibly takes place before but really it stand on its own, and I'm not sure if you saw rictus but the main bad guy of the game is actually his brother Scabrous Scrotus."
MadMax,37btel,eL3ctric,3,Tue May 26 14:59:27 2015 UTC,"I don't know if I like that Scrotus looks so similar to his brother. That said, I'm glad the Warboys are present in this game. They were great in the movie."
MadMax,37btel,vvarpidgeon,8,Tue May 26 15:30:16 2015 UTC,"The main baddie in the game is Scabrous Scrotus, the only Immortan Joe's son that isn't in Fury Road. I don't know if the games takes place before or after the movie, i need to find this out."
MadMax,37btel,reece1495,2,Tue May 26 15:19:34 2015 UTC,It takes place before Fury Road.
MadMax,37btel,vvarpidgeon,4,Tue May 26 17:05:46 2015 UTC,Its set in the wasteland with gastwon being one of the main places. Its set before the movie and that bald dude is another one of Immortan's sons Scabrous Scrotus.
MadMax,37btel,reece1495,3,Tue May 26 15:12:07 2015 UTC,"Its not Rictus, its Scrotos (who wasnt in the movie, so I predict he dies in the game).  The comic alludes that each of Joe's sons are somehow broken, Rictus has a strong body, but a simple mind. Corpus is intelligent, but has a pretty useless body, and Scrotus is said to be psychotic, so I imagine he'll be sadistic and cruel, while still being reasonably intelligent."
MadMax,37btel,Sunlegate,2,Wed May 27 04:14:45 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty excited for this game, and I adore the film, though I'm not sure they really need to show the backstory for everything. I suppose I like the sort of weird cultish mystique Immortan Joe has in Fury Road. I don't necessarily need to know that he's an ex-soldier turned dictator, I just need to know that his followers fervently believe in him, and that's what makes him interesting."
MadMax,37btel,iPadCamera,1 point,Wed May 27 04:45:32 2015 UTC,"It would be interesting to see if Scrotus was perhaps too extreme even for Joe and thats why he was sent away.  Now that I think of it the 3 sons all have one part of their father, strength, intelligence, and cruelty."
MadMax,37btel,Sunlegate,1 point,Wed May 27 07:46:25 2015 UTC,Did you see him die? I didnt!
MadMax,37btel,iPadCamera,1 point,Tue May 26 14:48:43 2015 UTC,"Damn, this made me less excited about this game :(  and I was really excited.  I agree with /u/skonen_blades in that the voice acting sounds like crap and the art direction/animation looked cheap.  Those are three elements that can completely ruin a game for me.    On top of that some of the clips seen in the gameplay overview video had me scratching my head, for example, head-on colision with a vehicle without even a flinch.  I don't want to feel like I'm in a tank going 300 mph.  I want to be scared that my Magnum Opus will be destroyed on impact.  Making it indestructible like that cheapens the relationship they are trying to create between Max and his car.  Also, the music choice was garbage.  The move soundtrack is one of the best I've heard in years.  Perfect mix between climactic drama and pure intensity.  This game music sounds more like a WWE wrestler intro.  I realize they're trying to set themselves apart from the movie but this is in the wrong direction imo."
MadMax,37crxa,srirachachau,12,Tue May 26 17:59:58 2015 UTC,"It seems like a valid argument. It's Max telling the story about how Furiosa brought some sense of civilization and potential salvation to the desolate life. It's all focused around Furiosa even when she's not in the story, it always revolves around how he came to be captured, escaped, then at the end he walked away leaving her and the war boys to their ""paradise"".  If it were told from Furiosa's perspective we would have more back story for how she came to decide to escape with the girls, we get dropped into the middle of her story."
MadMax,37crxa,natums,10,Tue May 26 22:31:38 2015 UTC,"The only thing I have to say on this, although I do think you make some great points, is that scene spoiler Where Max takes off on his own to take out the tank following behind them. He leaves, Furiosa explains the situation to the best of her knowledge, and then he walks back through the sands with a wheel and weapons. This scene completely abandons his POV."
MadMax,37crxa,Zefsidenic,10,Tue May 26 20:59:16 2015 UTC,"Even though Max is our storyteller, it's a story about Furiousa, just like the feral boy's story never takes the front seat over Max in Road Warrior. The narrative is about Furiosa but only using the information available to Max."
MadMax,37crxa,natums,7,Tue May 26 22:35:57 2015 UTC,"Hmmm, that's true, though the Feral Boy is absent for a good portion of The Road Warrior even though he's apparently the storyteller. Maybe you can chalk it up to that moment being something completely uneventful for Max because he's so good at killing? Haha"
MadMax,37crxa,Retlaw83,6,Tue May 26 21:09:49 2015 UTC,"Reminded me a lot of 2012's Dredd. For everyone else, the madness is the worst thing that ever happened to them. For Dredd, and Max in Fury Road, it's a Tuesday."
MadMax,37crxa,DanceFan24,5,Wed May 27 00:27:09 2015 UTC,"Would that explain why he doesn't talk much? He's more the fly on the wall as it's being exploded with napalm, observing the badassness of Furiosa?"

MadMax,37crxa,natums,3,Tue May 26 20:26:29 2015 UTC,"I thought the film was more from Furiosa's point of view, more her version of events."
MadMax,37crxa,jumpyg1258,6,Tue May 26 21:06:40 2015 UTC,It's Max telling the story of Furiosa's journey. If it were told from her perspective we would have seen the events leading up to her decision to run away with the girls. We get dropped in where we do because that's where Max joins the plot.
MadMax,37crxa,jumpyg1258,2,Tue May 26 22:32:54 2015 UTC,"Totally. In Road Warrior and Thunderdome, we're hearing epic tales about a hero that changes the course of history, all told through the eyes of another. In Fury Road, we get a new mythic hero (and a hero to Max) that drives civilization towards a better tomorrow: Imperator Furiosa."
MadMax,37crxa,natums,3,Tue May 26 22:47:18 2015 UTC,"Exactly, this is her tale of this stranger she met that helped her while trying to redeem herself by freeing these oppressed ladies and in the end the mysterious stranger with no name walks off into the sunset to not be seen again."
MadMax,37crxa,Bestpaperplaneever,3,Tue May 26 21:19:24 2015 UTC,"I think that's a totally valid read on it. My argument against that though is that Furiosa is never told how Max ran into her, but we're given that entire prologue with him and led all the way to where they meet. Really, the only thing she knows about Max is that his name is Max. On the other hand, everything we know about Furiosa is explained to Max."
MadMax,37crxa,natums,1 point,Tue May 26 21:41:38 2015 UTC,"In the Road Warrior, the feral kid has no idea about the events that led Max to arriving at the camp but they show those as well."
MadMax,37crxa,Bestpaperplaneever,1 point,Tue May 26 21:43:56 2015 UTC,"Fair enough and all we really see is Max getting captured, which Furiosa would've assumed. He does explain that he used to be a police officer though, which there isn't any reason for Furiosa to assume. Outside of Max wandering in the beginning of The Road Warrior, we aren't given any context to who he is. Feral Kid could've gotten the opening straight from the gyro captain."
MadMax,37crxa,Aleda2357,1 point,Tue May 26 21:52:02 2015 UTC,"Please correct me if I'm wrong, but outside of the first Mad Max and Fury Road, I don't believe that it's ever mentioned that he's a former policeman.   Also, it's been a while since I've seen it, but is the first Mad Max told from any perspective or is it a pretty straight narrative?"
MadMax,37crxa,CurtBaboon,3,Tue May 26 22:01:53 2015 UTC,Mad Max was pretty directly an origin story of Max... all other characters are antagonist in some way or another.

MadMax,37crxa,EsdrasCaleb,1 point,Thu May 28 01:13:09 2015 UTC,"That's how it seemed to me, Max was scared of becoming another ""fuel injected suicide machine"". I suppose not everyone was an antagonist but they were all props leading him down that road."
MadMax,37crxa,Bestpaperplaneever,1 point,Thu May 28 19:54:02 2015 UTC,Agreed.
MadMax,37crxa,Katamori777,1 point,Thu May 28 20:11:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you could probably argue that the perspective is at least 50/50, but my argument against that is that we're thrown into Furiosa's story and learn things about the conflict along the way in the same way that Max does. Furiosa's story began long before we got there."
MadMax,37crxa,Aleda2357,2,Tue May 26 21:23:37 2015 UTC,"Have you seen the theory where this max isn't even the same max as the original, it's actually the feral kid?  The major points of their theory is   Max mainly grunts and gestures in this movie  there is a similar if not the same music box in his possession found by one of joes wives when he heads out towards the bullet farmer and we don't see what happens he appears to be carrying a boomerang with him in addition to his other supplies he is reluctant to give his name and when he says it he sounds like he is trying to convince himself  time line doesn't work out since the original was prior to the apocalypse and the tattoo reads day 12045 along with other IDing info - max should be too old at this point in time for that to make sense additionally the tattoo says no busted limbs, original Max's knew was fucked max had an infant son not a young daughter   Not saying I buy it, but it's another explanation for the new style of story telling."
MadMax,37crxa,Retlaw83,6,Wed May 27 05:50:35 2015 UTC,"The big hole there is that the Feral Kid stayed with the Gyro Captain and the rest of the survivors after the events of Road Warrior, and eventually grew up to become the head of his tribe once the Captain died.   I just don't see him getting lost for a huge chunk of time cosplaying Mad Max in the Wasteland and then returning to his tribe to become their leader and eventually narrate Mad Max 2 as an old man."
MadMax,37crxa,Retlaw83,3,Wed May 27 07:14:02 2015 UTC,His opening monologue literally gives his back story.  Is not feral kid
MadMax,37crxa,Retlaw83,1 point,Thu May 28 04:45:20 2015 UTC,"This brings up an interesting thought: how did Feral Kid know Max's entire background (the death of his wife and child, for example) when he's telling the story of Road Warrior?"
MadMax,37crxa,EntsInTheNorth,1 point,Thu May 28 05:18:40 2015 UTC,"Hmmm, interesting. I was gonna say that that's never stated, but it is shown in the opening montage. You could maybe say that that's just a cinematic flourish to catch the audience up, but maybe that's a piece of his backstory that's carried on from legend to legend, which has some basis in his actual story. In Fury Road, you see a little girl get run over when it's established in Mad Max that he had a son. It is also totally possible that that's simply another story in Max's life that we haven't seen, but since my theory is that Fury Road is Max recounting one story, is it possible that Max told his tale at some point and the details simply got muddied through time via telephone game? People have met Max and have their version of events, most definitely spiced them up, but Max has his version too.   Like another thing I'd like to point out is that the dude that played the gyro captain in Road Warrior also played a similar gyro captain in Beyond Thunderdome, and you can certainly chalk that up to Miller just thinking that dude is a cool dude, but maybe there is some sort of important gyro captain in Max's history, but people aren't sure which story he's attached to.   This is getting so convoluted haha"

MadMax,37dx8m,thatashguy,5,Wed May 27 00:05:34 2015 UTC,it's probably Immortan Joe's calendar and he could have chosen any lunatic date he liked as the beggining of time worth recording.  maybe it's the day John Lennon was killed.
MadMax,37dx8m,leonryan,4,Wed May 27 03:19:37 2015 UTC,Probably his age.

MadMax,37dx8m,thatashguy,2,Wed May 27 02:38:26 2015 UTC,"It was released in 1979. 36 years ago.  Also, to try and give the time line any chance of working, he'd need to be about 40 in Fury Road. So I'm probably off base. It's unlikely it's day 0 of the apocalypse, because was about 24 or 25 when it happened.  As for precision, a couple of them probably know math and they might own a kitten calendar from 1993 or something."
MadMax,37dx8m,Retlaw83,2,Wed May 27 02:51:10 2015 UTC,"""The apocalypse"" is too vague of a term, I think. Where does the idea that he was 24 when the apocalypse happened come from? The idea that the first Mad Max was before the apocalypse? I don't know if that's true."
MadMax,37dx8m,EdgarsTeethAreDry,1 point,Wed May 27 03:46:15 2015 UTC,"Max is 25 in the Mad Max novelization, Mad Max 2 takes place about 2-3 years after Mad Max.  Nuclear War breaks out shortly after.  According to the novel timelines.  Also, the tattoo on the man in the first Fury Road comic states 2001 limited nuclear exchange, 2031 mass extinction.  If you assume Fury Road is a few years after, then the amount of days tattoo'd is about the same as the amount of days since the nuclear war."

MadMax,37f0un,HypoBear,2,Wed May 27 03:40:29 2015 UTC,"The Immortan is a 60+ year old man riddled with cancer. He'd most likely be dead before his son grew old enough to rule in his stead.  Knowledge is a form of power, and by educating them, he's giving them tools to rule and educate the future ruler of the Citadel.  I think the Immortan believed his own hype, assuming the wives would be nothing but grateful to be chosen as the breeders for the mighty-god-king."
MadMax,37f0un,BigTimStrange,4,Thu May 28 00:29:01 2015 UTC,"The Immortan Joe might have seen his wives not just as breeders, but as entertainment, like Japanese Geisha. He wanted them able to play music, and talk to him about intelligent things. He may have saved Miss Giddy because she said she would teach them these things, which would increase their worth. Miss Giddy then exceeded herself by teaching them everything she knew, making them repositories not just for the warlord's seed, but for whatever is left of the Old World's knowledge.   He also may have had them educated just so he knew which of them was the smartest. I'm convinced the reason Angharad was his ""favorite"" was because he thought she was the most intelligent and strong-willed wife, which meant her children would be the healthiest.   As for the books, I have no problem believing he saved them and kept them in the vault just because they were valuable. He didn't care if the Wives read them or not...although he'd probably enjoy the thought that they were, since educated women are rarer and more valuable.   My thoughts on the Wives in more detail"
MadMax,37f0un,IdiotsLantern,1 point,Wed May 27 08:52:39 2015 UTC,"Well I imagine 'school' consisted of the 20 books they had in a pile there, whatever random grab bag of books they were.

Driving 10 hours a day is pretty rough, especially on a motorcycle, and that's not even counting the heat, and the sun of riding through a salt flat.  They also didn't say it took 160 days to get across the salt flats just that that's what they had the supplies for.  They don't know what's on the other side of the flats or how long it is to the other side of them. No one they know has tried, gone and made it back.  But it's not like any of these people know a ton of people outside their groups (""shooting every one you come across"" as the oen Vuvalini woman said is not a great way to make conversational partners), It could take a month for all they know.  2 weeks.  They have on idea, it could be just far enough that whoever's on the other side doesn't think it's worth it to come over and make regular contact.  And we know on their side it gets progressively less ""civilized"" in terms of organized societies the closer you get to them.  We go from an organized, agrarian society in the Citadel that has settled to by the time we get to the Vuvalini living on the edge of the salt flats, they seem to be essentially nomads living like the bedouin, no fixed residence, using bait to lure people in and steal from them.  Before them are the stilt walkers, who seem to live by scavenging off a poisoned land.  The areas near the salt flats don't have groups of people who can build up the kind of surplus collective resources to attempt an expedition across it, they live marginally and presumably on a survival basis only.  The arrival of the war rig let's them get up enough of a collective surplus to attempt it."
MadMax,37ela5,Teantis,1 point,Wed May 27 08:15:33 2015 UTC,They also didn't say it took 160 days to get across the salt flats   I think that's the main point here. There's no way the Pacific ocean's dried up. Maybe a salt bank to NZ. But my first thought was that it was more or less SA which is one big salt flat.
MadMax,37ela5,themetr0gn0me,3,Thu May 28 21:18:35 2015 UTC,"""Max: Look. It will be a hard day. But I guarantee you that 160 days that way, there is nothing but salt. At least that way we might, together, come across some sort of redemption."""
MadMax,37ela5,Think_please,4,Sat May 30 15:23:47 2015 UTC,"They're not covering 1,440 miles per a day..."
MadMax,37ela5,Peanlocket,3,Wed May 27 04:15:40 2015 UTC,"Because guzzaline isn't gasoline, and every evidence in the movie points to guzzaline giving excellent mpg. With those monster V8s they were able to travel flat out over hundreds of miles without filling up constantly.   Yes they had the people eater's gas rig, but if you compare the gas mileage of racing v8s like were mounted in the vehicles to current v8 mpgs, they'd need to fill up every 20 or 30 miles or so considering the rate they were racing flat out. I'm not sure that his rig had enough to feed all the thirsty cars in the armada. Not to mention that when it exploded, judging by the size of the explosion, his rig had plenty of fuel in it still.  So lets say guzzaline gives about quadruple the mpg of gasoline  (I got the number because a big v8 will get about 5 or so mpgs when running flat out. And let's estimate that each vehicle has roughly a 15 gallon tank so on a regular gasoline engine you'd expect about 75 miles per tank. With about 20mpgs you'd be getting about 300miles per tank running flat out. The chase took place over 3 days so that's easily over 300miles at the rate they were traveling.)  So a bike that would normally get about 100mpgs on average life driving (alternating between city and freeway drivin) would now be getting about 800mpg (constant steady rate of travel at cruise speed will usually about double your mpg). You have about 4 or 5 gallons in a tank and a Jerry can or two strapped on (an additional 10-20 gallons.) we'll say that with all the extra weight we'll drop mpg to about 700mpg.  So on completely rough estimates, you could expect each bike to get roughly 17,500 miles before they'd run out.  Finally days of travel don't mean 24hrs a day of traveling but include time to sleep. No one is capable of riding a bike for 24hrs a day straight for more than maybe a few days before severe exhaustion takes its toll and you can't really eat, drink, or relieve yourself while riding so lets say they were on the road for about 9hrs a day. And lets assume they're travelling at around 40 or 50mph to maximize mpgs.  So they'd roughly be hitting about 400miles a day. So assuming they stick to the same thing every day and always hit about 400miles per day, they'd be expecting to travel about 64k miles. Granted 17.5k isn't quite close to 64k but we're assuming that they're traveling none stop every single day, and it's a lot closer than the rough 2.5k you could expect to get from regular gasoline.  So about 43 days of travel on guzzaline or about 6 days of travel on gasoline.  And that my friends is my shitty science post for you all."
MadMax,37ela5,Nicke1Eye,3,Thu May 28 19:54:39 2015 UTC,"And how do you reckon they'd cross the ocean?  Personally, the entire plan by Furiosa to ride across the salt flats for 160 days and Max later saying they won't find anything, was basically George Miller saying Furiosa's plan would just result in the women rubbing salt in the wound."
MadMax,37ela5,Hitzkolpf,11,Wed May 27 01:59:16 2015 UTC,The salt flat was the ocean
MadMax,37ela5,Hitzkolpf,4,Wed May 27 02:01:14 2015 UTC,"I've seen theories that it's the ocean, but I don't think it's even confirmed to be true, or even implied to be."
MadMax,37ela5,Teantis,3,Wed May 27 02:08:33 2015 UTC,Where else would there be that much salt? So much salt that nobody's seen the end of it?
MadMax,37ela5,horticult,4,Wed May 27 02:22:51 2015 UTC,Lake Eyre in australia is 9500 sq km of salt flats: http://resources3.news.com.au/images/2012/12/14/1226536/915099-lake-eyre.jpg  Here's a picture of it.  And like i said in my other comment on this thread it wouldn't actually take much for the characters not to know anyone who hasn't seen the end of it.  Information sharing between groups is presumably pretty low and most people concentrated on survival will only care about things that are relevant to that in the local area.
MadMax,37ela5,Yog_Kothag,3,Wed May 27 08:29:26 2015 UTC,The ocean floor might be salty but it sure ain't flat.
MadMax,37ela5,eff1ngham,3,Wed May 27 02:27:14 2015 UTC,"Wasn't before the bombs hit, anyway."
MadMax,37ela5,leonryan,2,Wed May 27 03:03:33 2015 UTC,"I posted this in a different thread but it's about the same subject:  I always assumed that the 160 days would account for days or even weeks of backtracking if the dried up ocean floor became impassable. I also assumed it accounted for their survival once they found somewhere suitable to grow new food and plants with the seeds. If they used 3/4 of their fuel to find a new home, they would still have fuel left to scout the new surrounding area, for example. I don't believe it's implied that they would be riding their bikes straight for 160 days. I always assumed it basically meant they had enough supplies for about 6 months worth of food to live on in addition to how far they could travel on the gas they brought"
MadMax,37ela5,Bestpaperplaneever,2,Thu May 28 21:18:10 2015 UTC,if the nuclear attacks were bad enough to have dried the oceans it's probably safe to assume the entire planet was irradiated.  there would have been a nuclear winter with the sky full of radioactive dust that settled pretty much everywhere.  australia is about the most isolated country on the planet so why would anywhere else be safer than it was?
MadMax,37ela5,leonryan,6,Wed May 27 07:48:52 2015 UTC,The energy it takes to boil the oceans would blow the atmosphere into space.
MadMax,37ela5,Bestpaperplaneever,5,Thu May 28 01:30:50 2015 UTC,was it ever suggested that the oceans boiled?  maybe the bombs opened a lot of cracks and it all drained toward the core.  Joe has obviously found a good underground source.  or maybe global air currents were altered and now it only rains at the poles.  maybe the ice caps grew and all the earths water is trapped in solid form.  maybe it just doesn't matter because the entire thing is metaphorical.
MadMax,37ela5,AfraidOfTechnology,4,Thu May 28 01:39:38 2015 UTC,"There's just not physically possible that nuclear bombs could open cracks that can drain the oceans, or that exclusive rain at the poles would somehow cause the oceans to dry up. The rain at the poles would just end up in the oceans again.  If the disappearence of oceans is explicitly mentioned in the films, fine, I can live with that. But as long as there's no on-screen evidence for such a scenario, I'm not going to assume that it's implied."
MadMax,37ela5,skonen_blades,1 point,Thu May 28 19:07:54 2015 UTC,I was wondering how they would be able to drive for 16o days without running out of fuel. How do they know if there are any fuel sources out there?
MadMax,37ela5,AfraidOfTechnology,1 point,Wed May 27 03:26:09 2015 UTC,I figured they each had a big couple of gas cans on the back of their bikes.
MadMax,37ela5,skonen_blades,1 point,Wed May 27 18:30:47 2015 UTC,"Would that last for one hundred and sixty days, though? It just seems like a long time... I know motorcycles get great gas mileage... But 16o days seems like a lot."
MadMax,37ela5,Bestpaperplaneever,2,Wed May 27 21:36:02 2015 UTC,Yeah.  I'm no expert on motorcycles but that does seem like an extremely long time even if you're carrying a lot of gas.  That's like just over four months.
MadMax,37ela5,Think_please,1 point,Wed May 27 22:09:35 2015 UTC,"There's an ocean between Australia and Hawaii though. I'm pretty sure it would be irradiated, as it hosts US military bases."
