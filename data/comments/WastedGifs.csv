The guy who hits the pole is a MONSTER who has been shepherding the overall leader the past 16 days.  The fellow lost control somehow, either brakes or something. Very rarely will they unhook their shoes from pedals.  Indication of something not quite right. In US haven't watched the stage yet, STUPID job... Anyone know if he is ok?"

WastedGifs,3dymfk,apinigis,20,Mon Jul 20 17:15:33 2015 UTC,Definitely not purposeful.   You have to realize how fast they're going into these corners... He just misjudged his line (she should have been towards the left of the roadway to start) and couldn't correct at that speed without crashing which is something you REALLY want to try and avoid when you're in the middle of the peloton (because everyone behind you is going to crash into you).
WastedGifs,3dymfk,xb4r7x,42,Mon Jul 20 18:58:46 2015 UTC,"It wasn't purposeful. Any rider who purposefully did that would get massive repercussions, not only officially, but more importantly he'd get shunned by the rest of the peloton.   Riding a bike race involves putting a lot of trust in your fellow professionals to stay upright. Accidents happen, but if someone did it deliberately they'd lose all the respect of their colleagues."
WastedGifs,3dymfk,NickTM,21,Mon Jul 20 18:18:11 2015 UTC,"To add upon this. When Joseba Beloki crashed on this decend in 2003, he never regained his former power due to breaking his femur, elbow, and hand. The crash can be seen here, it also features Lance Armstrong avoiding him and driving across a field.  There is nothing purposeful about diliberately crashing someone going 70 km/h down hill."

WastedGifs,3dymfk,PartyPoison98,6,Mon Jul 20 21:19:21 2015 UTC,"Warren Barguil (the rider out of control) said afterwards that he was bumped by Tejay van Garderen as they approached the corner and that his finger slipped off the brake lever. Van Garderen disputes this, saying Barguil was just going too fast.   Barguil has previously shown himself to be a very good descender and bike handler, and in the footage there is definitely contact before the corner, so I guess the truth is somewhere between the two accounts?  Edit: Added the video and also noticed TJVG is a bit late on the brakes himself and he almost takes out Quintana!"

WastedGifs,3cbu8j,xxdofxx,2,Mon Jul 6 19:31:28 2015 UTC,The move he was doing is called a suicide dive and usually involves being caught. What appears to have happened here is that the catcher was just too close to the ring so the diver goes straight over his head.   When done properly the diver would be able to push off the catchers chest with his hands bringing his momentum to a complete stop so he lands safely or alternatively both men go with the momentum and crumple together.
WastedGifs,3cbu8j,AMeowingCat,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:15:17 2015 UTC,"I think it's a barrier like this one and his head slipped between two of the vertical bits, as they sprang back around his neck after his head went between them. They're surprisingly springy/elastic given enough force, so would have easily bowed around his head shooting through them in the first place.  So still painful, but not quite the same as creating a head-shaped dent in a fully-solid barricade."

WastedGifs,3cbpmb,gyrowze,5,Mon Jul 6 20:42:33 2015 UTC,I know the parents and can confirm that it was a short step. They are also great parents who take VERY good care of their kids. While you can do everything to protect your kids you do have to let them explore and learn on their own too (to a point) -where this point of allowance is depends on parents and personal beliefs and preferences. They actually requested I make the gif for them because 1. Their kid was fine and 2. They thought this was hilarious.
WastedGifs,3cbpmb,HappyLeprachaun,-4,Mon Jul 6 20:49:03 2015 UTC,I get your point and it is very valid. Personally I can't stand when kids are messing around stairs especially when they're walking/running down them.
WastedGifs,3cbpmb,HappyLeprachaun,-2,Mon Jul 6 21:00:07 2015 UTC,It's still allowing the child to mess about in a place that they will inevitably hurt themselves. I'm not advocating wrapping the kids in bubble wrap but a little bit of common sense isn't too much to expect.

(titled Flying High! in Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Japan and the Philippines) is a 1980 American satirical disaster comedy film directed and written by David Zucker, Jim Abrahams, and Jerry Zucker and released by Paramount Pictures. It stars Robert Hays and Julie Hagerty and features Leslie Nielsen, Robert Stack, Lloyd Bridges, Peter Graves, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, and Lorna Patterson. The film is a parody of the disaster film genre, particularly the 1957 Paramount film Zero Hour!, from which it borrows the plot and the central characters,  as well as many elements from Airport 1975. The film is known for its use of surreal humor and its fast-paced slapstick comedy, including visual and verbal puns and gags.

WastedGifs,3aqlv7,Sympwny,1 point,Wed Jul 15 08:49:13 2015 UTC,"The plank would give and snap away from the force applied. This means the broken pieces are pointing away and there's no way you can get impaled on the broad side of a plank.  Secondly, because the weight of the wakeboard is distributed across multiple planks, it would require all of the boards to snap at the same time for the board to fall through the pallet. That is very unlikely. Not impossible, I'll grant you that, but very unlikely."

WastedGifs,3akb6z,DtotheOUG,10,Sun Jun 21 12:25:09 2015 UTC,"Really by both the ref and the standing fighter.  The fighter knows that the ref will jump in, but he's still got to get ready to throw that punch. It would be foolish not to set up the sure win. If he gets back up that's a lot of swings in both direction that could've been prevented. In some drastic turn of events he could even wind up losing the fight.  Good on the fighter for knowing to prepare to lock in the win but still giving the ref the chance to do his job."

The next is that I don't think I could bring myself to beat the shit out of an opponent who's already dropped and is probably unconscious.  I know the ref intervened here, and this guy may have slowed himself down intentionally or something to give the ref enough time to call it, but it doesn't always work like that and sometimes the unconscious guy gets extra fucked up... I understand the reason why, you need to make sure you've actually won the fight. It's just so brutal though..."

WastedGifs,3a0uag,bowhunter2995,361,Tue Jun 16 19:36:06 2015 UTC,"Story time! I'm bored none of you will probably ever read this.  Myself and a few of my friends ride, and one of our buddies brand new gsxr was stolen just a few weeks after he bought it.  Flash forward a cpl weeks I'm heading to work, already made it out of town (I worked in the next city over) and see a guy buzz by me on what I swear is my friends bike.   I called him to say dude I swear I just seen your bike. Now it's a gsxr and God knows there 5 million of the exact same bike out there.. but sometimes you just see ""your"" bike and know..   So another week goes by, and the same bike same road same time goes by my AGAIN. This time I speed up and stay behind him. Mind you I'm in my car.  So I follow him for a good 5 miles. He's going damn near 95 100mph and I'm in my Crx HF (fucker had I think 55 hp) he pulls into McDonald's to meet up with someone. I drive around the parking lot, see the stickers my buddy put on the fairings and tank STILL ON THE BIKE.  Somehow there are 3 state troopers at the circle k eating shit subway. I drive over there as fast as possible frantically explaining my friends stolen bike is over at McDonald's and the thief is inside eating.   They don't believe me but say whatever we'll go take a look.   Troopers drive across the street to McDonald's. One goes inside the others stay outside. Few minutes later the one comes out from inside and says he found a helmet and backpack stuffed in the bathroom. No sign of the culprits. The thief ran when he seen the troopers coming across the street. At this point it's obviously a stolen bike so the cops call in the dogs to look for these idiots. They ran into the woods next to the McDonald's and hid for 3 hours til the dogs found them.  My friend got his bike back, just had to fix the ignition.  There was also another stolen bike at the McDonald's, his friend he met up with was on a stolen bike. When they got to his home 3 more stolen bikes.  I must have recovered 15k plus in bikes that day! What a bunch of morons"

WastedGifs,3a0uag,Robbieallanswan,3,Tue Jun 16 14:37:38 2015 UTC,Actual question (not trying to be a dick); but how come I see a fair number of stolen bike stories? How do people get their hands on a working bike?  I'm thinking of purchasing a bike myself eventually and I want to try to prevent anything like this happening to me.
WastedGifs,3a0uag,semimedium,2,Tue Jun 16 14:49:47 2015 UTC,"It can be pretty easy to steal a bike because of how light some of them are. Two strong guys can push one up and into a little cart towed by a car. Or one guy can move it to a better location to grab it or mess with the ignition to get it to start if the bike's handlebars aren't set to ""lock"", because even if the engine is turned off in first gear, you can still get it to roll by pulling in the clutch.  Essentially, the easiest ways to deter people would be to put a cover over it and find a good chain and lock to hook it up to a permanent structure. Some also use disc locks or fancy anti-theft devices. A little more effort will stop some potential thieves. Also, many people will tell you to get comprehensive insurance because it'll cover you in case your bike gets stolen or tampered with."

Comparison with soap operas of article  Telenovela:       The standard American, British or Australian soap opera is of indefinite length, sometimes running for decades, with an ever-rotating cast of players and characters. However, most Latin American telenovelas have an average run of six months up to a year. The show's duration is pre-planned at the show's inception, with the overall story-arc and conclusion also known by the show's creators and producers at its inception. Mundo de Juguete is one exception to the rule, with a total of 605 chapters (1974–1977), and a few cast changes during the course of the serial. Some earlier Argentine telenovelas (most of them written by Alberto Migré) had also ran for a few years.

It survived the fall spectacularly, and after a little help up, performed really well and was actually quite graceful and impressive otherwise. There was actually an incident the next day where the robot lost its balance and recovered entirely on its own without outside interference.  The base machine is the robot ""Atlas"", made by Boston Dynamics, the makers of Big Dog and Cheetah. I think teams were also provided with some basic software. Teams designed custom manipulators and sensor arrays, and also significantly improved upon the performance of their software. Some teams built robots from scratch.  Anything else you want to know?"

WastedGifs,362ys0,Certified_Cunt,42,Sat May 16 02:48:26 2015 UTC,"That is really foul play, wasn't the referee watching for any of that?"
WastedGifs,362ys0,LinearSimcon,33,Fri May 15 21:09:20 2015 UTC,"This girl has probably been playing that way for years.  She knows who's looking at what and when to do what.  Living in the age of instant replay from almost every angle, it's easy to think that the refs see everything too.  But look at your computer screen while you're playing a game, see how much you can see in total, and think about what you can't see at all.  That's how a ref sees things too.  They're in one position on the field, looking in one direction, focused on a handful of things, with limited peripheral vision."
WastedGifs,362ys0,commentkarmawh0re,11,Fri May 15 23:27:04 2015 UTC,"A lot was on the ball though.  I mean, I've played all sorts of sports, but in all of them there's a ref watching the play on the ball at all times.  That being said, yes, things get missed.  But damn."
WastedGifs,362ys0,SirNoName,4,Sat May 16 01:26:56 2015 UTC,"Play number one looks off ball, but in the area.  The higher you go in the game, the more leeway you get, so I can see the punch (if it wasn't directly see by the ref) to be a give and take, but the rest of it is pretty intense.  My guess is that the ref was standing exactly where 15 was looking at about 0:22.  Ref may have seen the elbow, but likely not the extent of the punch because that should be a red card.  The other three plays before the hair pull depend on where you are on the field.  There are so many things that look like making plays at the ball when you're behind the fouling player.  You see her leg going toward the ball, your depth perception isn't great at a distance or at that angle, and you don't call it.  Generally, though, when these games get that chippy you have to blame the ref.  If it's a rivalry game or the teams have a history you have to call the game tight at the beginning or frustrations flare and things get out of hand quickly."
WastedGifs,362ys0,commentkarmawh0re,2,Sat May 16 01:35:52 2015 UTC,I think that crosses the line from foul play to assault. She shouldn't be allowed to play any more games.

Now, I'm not crazy to say all girls are the same, but there's a reason women are often called ""catty"". They can be incredibly vicious.   Girls schools have some of the strangest social environments I've ever seen. There's so much emotional bullying I just can't comprehend how friendships form!   Or ask a bouncer whether he'd prefer to break up a fight between girls or guys. Pretty sure they'd always answer guys. Men like to throw punches, assert dominance and be done with it. When women fight they basically want the other woman dead (at least that's what it seems like).   Men and women do (on average) behave differently, and I would agree that women can be more aggressive than men even if men are normally physically stronger."
WastedGifs,362ys0,MylesMad,2,Fri May 15 20:47:02 2015 UTC,"Pretty much exactly what I was thinking. I agree there is a difference. I don't really know what the cause is, it'd be interesting to look into."
WastedGifs,362ys0,irish711,-5,Fri May 15 21:08:23 2015 UTC,"I'll probably catch a little flack for saying this but:  Girls soccer is much more aggressive than guys. Since the skill sets and athleticism for guys is higher (please don't try and debate this point with me, a men's team will always beat a women's team), they can usually have a little more open play. Girls usually have to resort to a much more physical style of play. Starting in the rec leagues, the girls can be very abusive.  Source: I watch both men and women's soccer, and it's clear as day."
WastedGifs,362ys0,Xervicx,0,Fri May 15 21:38:58 2015 UTC,"Girls usually have to resort to a much more physical style of play.   If the girls are not on the same level as the guys as you say, then they wouldn't have to resort to anything because they're playing against each other and more or less equally matched. If there are things they just can't excel at as much as the guys, then wouldn't they still do all of those things, just a version that a little behind what the guys are capable of?  If the conclusion is mad that girls soccer is much more aggressive than guys soccer, I can't imagine that their skills are what influences it. The only thing I can think of is that there are differences in the ways males and females handle and deal with aggression, differences that have been proven to exist through studies and tests. And a person's nature will always influence their actions, especially during sports."

You get hit, fucking shove back, let the song finish, hug the person and move on. Dont wait on the side of the pit and punch someone who doesnt see it coming because you got shoved or punched.  Ive seen kids get pissed over little shit, and then it escalates quickly.  Im no stranger to it.  I was on the outside of what quickly became a hardcore dancing pit. Got hit in the face, and tried to go after the kid. Some bouncer stopped me and told me if I started shit id get kicked out.  I calmed down, waited and shoved the kid into a regular mosh pit and went about my way. Song ended and I talked to the kid and we laughed about it. Unfortunately not a lot of shows go that way.

He spun around and I put my hands up, yelled sorry, he just nodded, threw some casual horns and turned back around. Shit happens in the crowd, he understood.  Shoe mom outside the pit.

When you have an energetic band, it adds to the experience of the music. Imagine a song or a band that makes you want to move around to the music. Jumping around and pushing off of each other is a great release for most of the people. An important part of this is being respectful of others while having your own fun, which is what happens in 9 out of the 10 pits I've ever been in.  For example, if someone falls down, an entire group of guys will pick that guy up before continuing. If someone loses an item in the pit, someone will hold it up so they can find it, ect. Unfortunately, some of the last few big festivals and tours are where I've seen shitty behavior like crowd killing ( hitting people in the general crowd outside the mosh pit).  I want to stress that this gif is not at all emblematic of the entire culture."

WastedGifs,35rdce,vanquish421,34,Wed May 13 00:09:58 2015 UTC,"EDM is the umbrella term for any kind of electronic dance music (and anyone who says otherwise can suck it).  Genres in EDM are generally sorted by BPM and whether it's a four-to-the-floor (kick on every beat) or broken beat (kick in various places throughout the drum line).  Dubstep is 140 bpm, half time, broken beat.  So the guy above you is part of a crowd that hates the aggressive, robot sort of dubstep to the point where they don't think it should be called dubstep but instead the derogatory ""brostep"".  The funny thing is the song in the video is neither, it's actually drumstep, which is 170 half-time broken beat.  EDIT: The song in the mosh video, I mean."

Techno and house were their own distinct genres long before the most recent mainstream surge in electronic music's popularity and the spread of the term EDM, and still remain distinct. The culture and sounds of those and related genres is considered distinct from 'EDM', and EDM is often used as a pejorative.  If you think that is wrong or stupid that is fine.

WastedGifs,35rdce,oskatilla,1 point,Wed May 13 07:14:16 2015 UTC,"I don't necessarily think having an umbrella term for everything is that useful. We don't talk about ""guitar based music"" or 'GBM' to mean everything from folk to psychedelic rock to black metal.  I think that the subculture and sound of Techno/House is distinct enough from most stuff that identifies as EDM that they should't be grouped together. You won't find Avicii playing an underground club in East Berlin, just like you won't find Norman Nodge playing EDC Las Vegas.   I listen to house and techno and some ambient but I don't listen to EDM. Thats what I say when people ask me. Its a useful distinction. Some might find it elitist, and maybe it is, but I'd rather not be grouped in with festival kandi kids, furry boots, and bros just because I listen to electronic music (sometimes indirectly) made to dance to. I know what someone means when they say 'I listen to EDM' and usually it does not include Jeff Mills.

Also, any time you hear a song that you are unsure of the genre, open up a tap bpm and figure out what BPM it's at.

Fair enough, but the primary differentiator between genres in EDM is the BPM, and broken vs. 4-to-the-floor.  Look at ""house"" for example.  It's 4-to-the-floor 120-130.  There are a ridiculous number of songs that are house, people just divide them into subcategories, like ""deep"", ""tech"", electro"", ""bigroom"", etc.  It's all ""house"" because a DJ can easily transition from one track to the other without a ridiculous speedup or a sloppy sounding beat.  A dancer can keep doing the same moves, a guy doing poi doesn't have to change it up, etc.  And that's how I feel about ""dubstep"".  It's all 140bpm, half-time broken beat.  That's the important thing.  If we want to differentiate between emotion, then that's where ""chillstep"", ""brostep"", ""old-school dubstep"", whatever come in.

WastedGifs,35rdce,TomBradyGOAT,1 point,Wed May 13 07:36:53 2015 UTC,"I agree for the most part, but I think it's sometimes fuzzier with dubstep. The beats can vary a LOT more simply because they are broken, and with the increasing prevalence of electronic crossover genres, people get easily confused at the wildly different styles.  If you show someone a big room house track and then a minimal tech house track, they can still find common ground with the beat.  If you were to do the same with something from 2562 and say, Doctor P, I don't see how hell an unfamiliar listener would ever be convinced they are even in the same overarching genre.  In the end, I would honestly be fine if people accepted the different forms of dubstep, but the number of times I have been told what I listen to isn't actually dubstep and I'm a hipster for defending what OG dubstep really is speaks otherwise.  e. wrong example"

Most of it is dark, minimalist, and more about filling space than remaining constantly noisy. Sub-base (very low frequency) is an integral part of the sound, so I do suggest listening with decent speakers or headphones and a good subwoofer. By far and away my favorite artists are Kryptic Minds. Distance and Biome are close behind. You can't go wrong with any of the big UK labels like Deep Medi, Tempa, Chestplate, Dub Police, DMZ, etc.  The knowledgebase and other resources over at /r/realdubstep are a good start.

WastedGifs,35iat3,nofattiesplease,22,Mon May 11 00:45:48 2015 UTC,"Well, previously it was thought that obesity had protective factors when it came to bone density (because bones get stronger when under stress, such as weight lifting, but in this case, fat lifting); but this has been questioned because of the other habits present in an obese person.  When it comes to falls, obesity may increase the risk of falling related to poor balance and this makes sense when you see the gait of an obese person (waddle).  Furthermore, while not always true, often times, uncontrolled diabetes is present in long term obesity, leading to neuropathy, which decreases sensation in the lower extremities, making balance even more of an issue (try walking when your foot is asleep, feels like you're going to roll your ankle any second).  Then it becomes a physics problem, imagine the stress on your knees when you do a lunge, now pretend you have 350lbs strapped to you and instead of good form, you carelessly throw your foot out to catch yourself, but you can't feel your foot. You can replace any extremity here, but suffice to say a wrist will not support as much force as a leg.  Somehow malnutrition is often present in obese, in the form of suboptimal vitamin and mineral levels, although there is obviously excessive amounts of calories being consumed, those calories are in the form of sugary beverages or other empty Calories.  Comorbidities, hormone changes, sedentary behavior, an unusually cluttered living environment, and poor access to proper health care are added to the mix to cement the chances for increased injury from a ground level fall.  TL;DR: Intuition would say the fat cushions, which is true for a reasonable amount of fat, but when obesity has become so severe and chronic that organs begin to fail, kidneys stop filtering properly and proteins don't function well in the blood, then you have a recipe for risk far in excess of any protection fat may have offered."

WastedGifs,35iat3,kenabashi,5,Mon May 11 03:30:40 2015 UTC,"While I'm no nutritionist, it's when the food being eaten lacks nutritional value. Someone could get their recommended 2000 calories of their daily diet from Mountain Dew but it lacks the nutrients necessary for all bodily functions. It's more or less useless or ""empty"" calories from my understanding."
WastedGifs,35iat3,JoMich85,1 point,Mon May 11 15:28:14 2015 UTC,"Referring to any calorie that doesn't come with enough vitamins, minerals or phytonutrients to justify eating the calorie. Donuts, cookies, cakes, soda, sweet tea, non-dairy creamer and perhaps potaoes, corn or rice might be examples of empty calories. It means a person is consuming energy, but not other compounds conducive to good health, like vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, fiber, etc.  The issue is dire in America, with an abundance of calories (macronutrients), but not micronutrients, resulting in an overweight and malnourished person existing in the same body. Excessive sugar, fat and protein and insufficient vitamins and minerals."

Many people do this and indoor cats love it. First few times in the harness are hilarious and kitty will act like he's having a stroke or is dying, just takes some time to get used to it.  My cat comes running to the door as soon as I pick up the harness and forces his plump body into it when I lower it. He knows he can walk outside with his harness/leash and he loves it. Took a while but now it's just like walking with a dog"

WastedGifs,352nvk,CptCunnilingus,10,Wed May 6 20:36:40 2015 UTC,It's a small dog harness because he was too big for the cat harnesses they had at the store. :/ I had to get a little creative with how to put it on.
WastedGifs,352nvk,discogodfather6922,4,Wed May 6 20:45:09 2015 UTC,"You should start out with draping things around the cat like a harness. Once it gets comfortable with that, put on a loose harness. Then tighten it. Then put on a lead. Do this while giving treats and praise(don't overstimulate the cat with praise, though), and make every step into multiple sessions. Don't let the sessions be too short(the cat wouldn't become desensitized) or too long(the cat will stress). It should work out after a week or two with some consistency and effort.   It's great for about 50 reasons that you're lead training your cat instead of letting it roam. Kudos!  source: have lead trained multiple adult cats and love cats"

WastedGifs,352nvk,Midgers,2,Thu May 7 00:49:18 2015 UTC,Because on average outdoor cats live much shorter lives. They're at much higher risk for injury and illness. They are extremely harmful to native fauna. They act as disease vectors crapping in people's flower pots and kid's sandboxes.  If not fixed they can have kittens on a nearly non-stop basis.   They're downvoting because it's poor animal husbandry and irresponsible for the environment.

Driving now, I can see why she did it.. almost every stop sign in town is so far back that I can't see jack shit from there and have to creep halfway out into the intersection to see around bushes/longbox trucks/etc. But I creep out slowly so I don't run over any stupid kids.."

I just think you have an irrational idea of what hunting really is.   hunting(particularly birds) is done for sport, not food.    This is absolutely untrue. It is illegal to take a game bird and not eat it. Pheasant is some of the most delicious Fowl there is.   The only type of hunting that is done without indenting on eating the meat is predator hunting, which is done for conservation purposes to control numbers. Otherwise, taking a game animal and not eating it is called poaching, which 99.999999999999% of people who hunt are not, and are highly against it as it goes against their cause."

It's why the concept of ""fighting words"" exist.  Anyways, I was mostly addressing your claim that he wasn't being confrontational. You don't have to throw a punch to be confrontational."

WastedGifs,34i3h4,Akumetsu33,4,Fri May 1 19:38:24 2015 UTC,"Exactly. I'm late, but wanted to mention this: if you know that you are getting into situation where fight is possible, take out your hands from the pockets and place them away from your face. Don't make box stance (fists near chins,  hitting on your first will hurt you, cause no gloves) . Say: ""Wowowow, man, I'm sorry, let's have a drink"". A won fight is the fight that never started. But if the guy will strike you, you have two arms preoared for blocking and making an obstacle for the strikes."

WastedGifs,34i3h4,alecevans92,72,Fri May 1 12:18:10 2015 UTC,"Big enough that we had to launch an Ad campaign for ""King Hit's"" aka waiting til they turn around and punchin them in the back of the head.   I have worked clubs and Pubs for nearly 20 odd years, have seen AND received too many dickheads throwing a punch when the person wasn't even aware of what's coming. Thanks to dickheads like this guy's killer it's become more reported on and as such seems to be increasing. I can tell you with brutal honesty I've seen one not more than 30 mins ago when a drunk got knocked back at the club next to where I'm working right now. The bouncer's fine, the guy is in a Divi van as I type.  The main problem with a dead drop - the head hitting the ground at full force - is either 'Coup Countrecoup', a 'Subarachnoid Haematoma' like what killed Phillip Hughes (NSFWish) a while back, or my own personal fear, 'Subdural Haematoma.' I've actually had one of those, not pleasant."

Upon grabbing that hand he pulls it across the man's body turning the man onto his side. He then proceeds to pat the man on the back with his left hand a few times. Then he walks away. Unless his wallet was clutched in his hand while unconscious or affixed to the outside of his shirt on his back, he didn't take the man's wallet. The video is as clear as day."

WastedGifs,340ziq,el_matt,7,Mon Apr 27 21:34:41 2015 UTC,"More to the point, this is why you teach your children to ride according to the rules of the road before letting them out unsupervised.  It looks like this happened in a country where vehicles drive on the left hand side of the road. The kid basically did three things wrong here, and the driver probably did the best they could to react to them:  1) Travelling too fast around a blind corner  2) Riding on the wrong side of the road  3) Failing to indicate intention to turn into the side road  I appreciate kids need to be let out to exercise and have fun, and at a campsite the speed limit is probably 10mph so collisions like this will be less harmful than on a real road. Nevertheless, you still need to take as much care as anywhere else or shit like this will happen and it will fuck up someone's day."

WastedGifs,340ziq,xxdofxx,79,Mon Apr 27 16:11:52 2015 UTC,"Assuming that she isn't badly injured (if she is call an ambulance) , call the police,  get a police report,  the parents will be notified and come out to the scene,  you'll collect their insurance information.  Call their insurance company give them the number of the police report.  They will send an estimator out to value the damages and then you will take it to a shop to be fixed.  The parents of the child will pay their deductible and their insurance company will pay the remainder to the shop that does the repairs.  If they don't have insurance you can use your own insurance company to repair your car,  and then try to get the parents to pay your deductible and premium increase,  but the next step would probably be a lawsuit for reimbursement and damages."

Lucky for me, the kid (7 year old, NO HELMET) had his brother outside with him (he was  15/16ish).  Long story short, I broke the kids femur, but the brother told the truth to the parents, that it was the 7 year old being reckless.  The brother even said to me ""we've all told him this was going to happen sooner or later"", implying he was regularly reckless and helmetless on his bike - which pissed me off pretty royally.  I had some semi-serious PTSD after this.  What happens, however, is the homeowners insurance policy will cover whatever the auto insurance policy wont cover.  Lucky for me, the parents didn't file a suit against me."

WastedGifs,33e6xy,SweetSlowKiss,8,Wed Apr 22 00:04:27 2015 UTC,I'm guessing at least a free ball.
WastedGifs,33e6xy,mrhelios,6,Wed Apr 22 01:50:27 2015 UTC,not even. There still was a net :)
WastedGifs,33e6xy,WoodZ941,2,Wed Apr 22 02:52:32 2015 UTC,"I don't think the fact that the net was just there is super relevant when it didn't work at all.

WastedGifs,33e6xy,WoodZ941,0,Tue Apr 21 22:01:47 2015 UTC,"If the net isn't designed to protect people in the front row, why does it exist at all?"
WastedGifs,33e6xy,DHLucky13,4,Wed Apr 22 17:34:20 2015 UTC,"It is designed to protect the people in their seats, which is where you should be when the ball is in play. It is NOT designed for you to be standing with your head less than a foot from the netting where the people behind you can't see the game."
WastedGifs,33e6xy,WoodZ941,-2,Wed Apr 22 17:37:18 2015 UTC,"I know this is a pretty crazy concept, but your head is going to be almost exactly the same distance from the net whether you're sitting or standing. If the net is designed to only protect people who are sitting and leaning all the way back in their seat, that's a horrible design. What if you're sitting down and you sneeze, or cough, or drop your wallet and have to lean forward to pick it up, or literally anything else that would cause you to move your head closer to the net happens right as a foul ball is hit into the net? You're just a fucking stupid asshole for getting too close to it?"
WastedGifs,33e6xy,DHLucky13,5,Wed Apr 22 17:45:09 2015 UTC,"Actually it is a crazy concept, because that is not true. The net is designed to protect people who are sitting in their seats, leaning forward in their seats, or standing in place of their seating. The netting is NOT designed to protect someone who is walking in front of someone already in a seat, which is what the lady in the gif is doing. This is how much space there is between the seats and the net, and it's actually one of the smallest gaps I've ever seen at an MLB park. The netting at PNC Park is actually on the field side of a thicker brick wall, so add at least another foot. The net will give less than a foot when hit (more like 5 or 6 inches, but let's say a foot to give you the benefit). So, yeah, if you manage to get your head that close to the net while in your seat, then you're doing something very wrong."
WastedGifs,33e6xy,WoodZ941,-1,Wed Apr 22 18:07:26 2015 UTC,Unless she's doing some kind of weird limbo dance while she's scooting by everyone there's no way her head gets as close to the net as you're saying it needs to be.  Either way the point is that the net should be designed so that it's impossible for a ball to hit anyone in the stands. There's no reason the net has to be right up against the wall. They could just build it a foot or two away from it. Or not have seats that get that close to it.
WastedGifs,33e6xy,RagingAlien,9,Wed Apr 22 18:13:00 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure instincts might help keep your face safe. The guy right beside her moves his face away and puts his arm in front of it before the ball hits her.

Basically you can go up and down the stands immediately after a pitch is thrown and they're switching batters, or in between innings. While it is for safety, it's also just common courtesy. Some people don't realize how many people's views you block trying to get to or from your seat, and it's just kind of rude."

It's been more of an unwritten rule in ballparks since they first came around.   The security guards block people now so others who don't know about the rule (or just don't give a shit) don't ruin it for everyone by disturbing them mid play. All the action happens during the innings, and people can be rude when they just get up all the time and block your view."

Those are valuable milliseconds or action that I can't afford to miss, even if it means sacrificing the health of your bladder."
WastedGifs,33e6xy,rLeJerk,2,Wed Apr 22 17:36:37 2015 UTC,I think it's more to not have people blocking your view of the game when you stand up. That shit gets super old when the row in front of you is constantly getting up and down while the action is happening.

WastedGifs,33e6xy,ixodioxi,16,Wed Apr 22 03:15:41 2015 UTC,The net works just fine. It fully protects anyone seated behind home plate. Normally you have to wait in between batters to leave/return to your seat. The net has some give to it so as not to allow the ball to spring back and hit the players. Her getting hit is both her fault for not being aware of the ball and the fault of the usher who let her stand like that.
WastedGifs,33e6xy,WoodZ941,6,Wed Apr 22 04:01:17 2015 UTC,the fault of the usher who let her stand like that.   Aaand there's some season tickets.

WastedGifs,339tqh,Ralph_Baconader,65,Tue Apr 21 03:09:12 2015 UTC,He would've been fine if he actually committed to the stop
WastedGifs,339tqh,Likely_not_Eric,34,Mon Apr 20 20:45:48 2015 UTC,"It looks like the ice might have had a gouge there, too. You can see his left leg lose the ice, which is when he starts to tip to vertical and loses his balance. He then recovers his left leg too late as he's already going over.  He's he was essentially in a position where he was stopping on only his right skate and rather than just following through tried to get his left back in there and learned something."
WastedGifs,339tqh,baymandernamonia,22,Mon Apr 20 21:17:55 2015 UTC,"as an ice hockey player for 14 years I can tell you it doesn't look like it has much to do with him committing to the stop as it has to do with his skates being very sharp, and him not being heavy enough for that blade depth. If your skates are particularly sharp you will feel a jolty tug on the ice when you try to stop and that can and will happen to you. He should'v worn a helmet or better yet not tried that at all"
WastedGifs,339tqh,Snoopyalien24,3,Tue Apr 21 02:59:13 2015 UTC,I want to do what he did (correctly) any tips? I never know how to properly stop on ice
WastedGifs,339tqh,ColonParentheses,5,Tue Apr 21 05:18:52 2015 UTC,"Turn into it. This is the best way to get yourself familiar with the resistance your blade give you because of their sharpness. This of it like drifting in a car, where you slowly angle yourself into essentially moving in a direction perpendicular to your blades. From here you'll gain confidence and ""feel"" and you'll be able to do a full stop.   Note: When doing a proper full stop, it helps to go a bit faster so that you have more ""drift time"" as the resistance slows your down, giving you more time in general to keep your balance and stay in control. Given this, you should also push into the ice as you stop, keeping your center of gravity low so you down tip over forwards when your feet come to a stop.   Keeping this in mind, what this kid did wrong is he tried to do a proper full stop on his very sharp skates while being pretty light. This meant that he experienced a lot of resistance (from his sharp skates) and essentially stopped too early, his momentum carrying his body over his now stationary feet and into the boards. He did almost everything right, but he was very upright and therefore his center of gravity was very high, making it easy for his momentum to tip him forward over his stationary skates. He wasn't ready for this because he was going so fast, and didn't deal with it properly because he was too upright.   In the future, he should start by turning into the stop, as I wrote about at the beginning of this passage."

WastedGifs,32tkpf,MrMoustachio,12,Thu Apr 16 17:43:23 2015 UTC,"Highsider:       A highsider or highside is a type of motorcycle accident characterized by sudden and violent rotation of the bike around its long axis. This generally happens when the rear wheel loses traction, skids, and then suddenly regains traction, creating a large torque which flips the rider head first off the side of the motorcycle or over the handlebars.  The initial traction loss may be caused by:   locking the rear wheel through excessive braking applying too much throttle when exiting a corner oversteering the bike into the turn by shifting weight to the front wheel and using balance to drift the rear wheel sideways exceeding the lateral grip through too much speed (although, this is more likely to result in a lowsider), or too much lean an unexpected change in the surface friction (water, oil, dust, gravel, etc.) reducing the friction on the rear tire by scraping the bodywork of the motorcycle on the road surface   Highsides differ from lowsides as follows: during a lowside the rear wheel slips laterally and continuously until the bike falls onto its side (the side that's inside the corner), while during a highside the rear wheel slips laterally only briefly before suddenly regaining traction and flipping the bike onto its other side (the side that's outside the corner, and therefore the higher side of the motorbike).  As a result, highsides happen very quickly with little, if any, warning and are very violent.  If the wheels are not aligned in the direction of travel when traction is suddenly restored and the rear tire stops slipping, then a highside is likely, depending on how much the bike is turned across the direction of travel and how fast the bike is traveling when the rear tire stops slipping. If the angle is high enough, the bike is moving fast enough, and the rear tire slips and regains traction suddenly enough, the rider has no chance of preventing a highside.

You can see that the wheel starts pointing to the right when it makes contact, as a consequence loses ground contact again, the rider's steering forces are now uncountered so it turns violenty to the left just to touch the ground again with an even bigger angle, which induces an even bigger steering impulse to the right etc. and on the third cycle of that the bike highsides"

As expressed in article 13 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, it asserts that:   a citizen of a state in which that citizen is present has the liberty to travel, reside in, and/or work in any part of the state where one pleases within the limits of respect for the liberty and rights of others, and that a citizen also has the right to leave any country, including his own, and to return to his country at any time    The dude didn't know what he was talking about (shocking).

It has very racist origins that just so happen to coincide with lower levels of government. It was an attempt to say that the county sheriff had authority over the federal and state governments only because they wanted to continue segregation and discrimination. That's very anti-liberty (though a seemingly large number of libertarians do believe in it I'll grant you). That is the ""Christian Identity"" movement's origin, and Sovereign Citizens are born directly out of that.  Cliven ""let me tell you something else I know about the nego"" Bundy said repeatedly during the standoff that he does not recognize the federal government's authority and would only surrender to the county sheriff. You really can't divorce racism from sovereign citizens and so I don't want to lay the movement at the feet of libertarianism."

So then I decided to 'buy' my video back, by emailing them saying I wanted to use my own video (I emailed from another address) on a TV Show, they were going to charge me $350 for a TV usage license...   That's called business. If a TV show contacted you directly you could've charged them the same thing. The thing is there's no guarantee a TV show would contact you. So Jukin pays you up front. They're taking a risk. There's a chance they'll make a good profit, or they could lose the money they paid you.  Also, FYI, you don't have to sell the ownership rights to these companies. You can sell licensing rights, but retain ownership and get a share of the revenue generated from your content.  I know it's not something you were prepared for when it happened, and it seems like they were just trying to screw you, but you made some money as opposed to no money."

WastedGifs,319chu,gocks,1 point,Fri Apr 3 14:47:17 2015 UTC,"The Absent-Minded Professor:       The Absent-Minded Professor is a 1961 American film distributed by Walt Disney Productions based on the short story ""A Situation of Gravity"" by Samuel W. Taylor. The title character was based in part on Hubert Alyea, a professor emeritus of chemistry at Princeton University, who was known as ""Dr. Boom"" for his explosive demonstrations. The film stars Fred MacMurray as Professor Ned Brainard.  The film was a huge success at the box-office, and two years later became the first Disney film to have a sequel, 1963's Son of Flubber.  The original 1961 film was one of the first Disney films to be colorized (for the 1986 video release), and, along with 1959's The Shaggy Dog and 1963's Son of Flubber, it is one of Disney's few black-and-white films to be produced after 1941.

WastedGifs,30g36m,BlastedInTheFace,15,Tue Mar 31 02:35:35 2015 UTC,Sounds about right.  To make the US team it will take at least a 44 high outdoors.  This is an indoor race though so he can probably run a bit faster than this.  A 46.5 is might be good enough to make the Olympic team for a less competitive country.
WastedGifs,30g36m,Coldones,28,Fri Mar 27 04:31:01 2015 UTC,"He's also still in highschool, so he's likely to get faster as he grows into his prime."

WastedGifs,30g36m,Duckyyyyyy,8,Fri Mar 27 08:41:16 2015 UTC,"Does indoor vs outdoor make a big difference?  Edit: I assume there are differences, I just don't see how they'd make that big of a difference on time. I'm perfectly willing to accept that my thinking is inaccurate but ""wind and shit"" isn't an explanation."
WastedGifs,30g36m,DrProbably,17,Fri Mar 27 06:21:22 2015 UTC,the track is shorter so you have to make more turns.
WastedGifs,30g36m,workedog,-30,Fri Mar 27 07:14:20 2015 UTC,"This doesn't make any sense.  Edit: Okay. Their one sentence with no explanation or punctuation get's upvotes but my one sentence rebuttal gets downvotes. Sigh. okay fine, I'll spell out why it doesn't make sense.  All indoor tracks are shorter? Universally? Across the board? Something makes me doubt that.  Why does turning matter? 100 yards is 100 yards. A mile is a mile. I understand turning is marginally slower than top speed but is this really the only metric coming into play here? There's more to this and it's really frustrating how every answer I get is shitty but when I want more info, I get downvoted."
WastedGifs,30g36m,DrProbably,12,Fri Mar 27 10:55:55 2015 UTC,"Track is an extremely volatile sport when it comes to time, every factor can make a difference.  That's why people use blocks and spikes, because everything shreds a few seconds or tenths of a second off.  Smaller indoor tracks are typically 200m long, which is of course half the 400m of an outside track.  That means you're making twice as many turns inside, and the straightaways are shorter.  That gives you less time to really accelerate towards the end, and it can also slow your momentum quite a bit, especially in a race like the 400.  And we're talking a difference here of maybe 1 ~ 1.5 seconds, so it's really not all that much in the grand scheme of things, but for competitive runners it can make all the difference.  If that doesn't clear things up, google exists.  Source: I run meets every week in the 1, 2, and 4."
WastedGifs,30g36m,Big_Toes,2,Fri Mar 27 13:03:50 2015 UTC,Thank you for the real answer.
WastedGifs,30g36m,DrProbably,6,Fri Mar 27 16:37:40 2015 UTC,"The explaination was a bit off. Yes, you have more turns, which is slower than running straight, but the distance you run in a turn is equal for both indoor and out. However, the turns indoor are sharper, being slower to run than the wider outdoor turns."
WastedGifs,30g36m,Kirsham,1 point,Fri Mar 27 12:53:42 2015 UTC,In what situation is travel faster through a turn than in a straight line? I had figured this would be self-evident but apparently you have no common sense.

WastedGifs,30g36m,KirbyFTW,2,Fri Mar 27 06:07:33 2015 UTC,"Indoors is on a 200m track usually, as opposed to a 400m track.  Small track means tighter turns, which is more difficult to go faster.  That is why indoor tracks are commonly banked, but you still see slower times indoors than outdoors for sprints."

WastedGifs,30g36m,Isixpool,4,Fri Mar 27 06:22:45 2015 UTC,"Depends on the running distance, anything over 400m and the wind is mostly negated.  However, under 400m, like 100 and 200, the wind could be behind or infront which can take a second or two off the time depending on the strength"

WastedGifs,30g36m,Sylll,1 point,Fri Mar 27 09:10:45 2015 UTC,"He didn't say the man pushed her. /u/kaskrinj is guessing that because the man looks older, and because he had one end of the tape, that he was probably in charge of the finish line (or at least a somewhat higher authority). I think Kaskrinj also guesses that the man didn't alert the woman on the right soon enough that he was handing her the tape, and by the time he let go and she saw it falling toward the ground, she instinctively tried to retrieve it. Her confusion at being handed the tape and seeing it fall and knowing the runners are closing in is probably why she ended up getting hit. The woman should have been paying better attention, but the man also could have made sure she was better prepared.  Higher up, /u/TedFartass made a great point about impulse.   As much as her fault it is, I think we're disregarding impulse to pick it up. How often do you drop something accidentally and just leave it there? She merely acted on impulse and if you say at least a few of you wouldn't have done that, then you're dirty liars.   It's possible the woman was just dumb in the moment. I just don't like how it seems everyone's assuming she's a complete idiot for something that isn't entirely her fault. A lot of ""stupid bitch""-type comments."

WastedGifs,30g36m,xisx,9,Fri Mar 27 05:00:14 2015 UTC,"Many accidents are caused by things that are either easy to prevent or don't normally happen.  I'm just saying it was clearly an accident, and I don't think the young lady is a ""bitch"".  And if we're gonna be like this, ""Clear the fucking track"" - well, she was trying to. That whole thing happened pretty damned quickly. It's not like she was just randomly standing around in the way. It's like a car wreck where someone hits someone going through an intersection. ""Get out of the fucking intersection!"" is not a fair complaint when they were both moving through the intersection.  But if you just want to be critical of people, that's your right. I just thought your post was rather a bit overkill and unfair."
WastedGifs,30g36m,foolofatook29,-1,Fri Mar 27 03:18:13 2015 UTC,You are right it's like being at an intersection. One person has a red light the other people have a green light. Are you honestly going to tell me if you've got a green light and somebody pulls out in front of you you aren't going to call them an ass hole/bitch/everything in the book? If so you have much more restraint than I do and I applaud you for that.
WastedGifs,30g36m,theasianpianist,5,Fri Mar 27 09:06:06 2015 UTC,"I might be angry at them, but if I found out their foot slipped off the brake or something like that - i.e. it was an accident, as was clearly the case in the submission - then I couldn't be too angry...  I would be okay with getting angry at someone for doing something stupid, but I don't think this qualifies.  And it's not exactly like a red light / green light situation. Her subconscious instinct was to go after the falling object. I think she realized oh-shit-in-the-way and tried to get out of the way. Thing is, watching the gif a hundred times, it's easy to see how to prevent it from happening. In the real world, in the moment, it happens very very quickly, and there's not an ability to calmly pause for a few moments and reflect on how best to spend the next couple of seconds."

WastedGifs,305cnd,Jabrono,114,Tue Mar 24 17:48:41 2015 UTC,"Spoiler:  Rick's group finally made it to a new and reliable community called Alexandria. Trying to keep society intact like how it used to be, if someone acts and becomes a problem, they are exiled rather than killed, a mentality Rick has adopted after his time in the wild.  Meeting a nice woman, it's revealed that she is often abused by her husband who happens to be Alexandria's only doctor. Getting in a fist fight, Rick knocks out the doctor and explains to the rest of the community who deserves the safe haven of Alexandria.  At this point, Rick is looking like the bad guy and Alexandria's leader, Deanna, is considering exiling him. To avoid further problems / Rick doing something stupid, Michonne runs up and knocks him out."
WastedGifs,305cnd,Tkpwns,76,Tue Mar 24 18:34:54 2015 UTC,"A bit more: (Spoilers obviously)  Some members of a scavenging party were killed due to the Alexandria people being lacking skills and experience, one of them being one of Ricks group.  One of Ricks ranting points was also that they (in Alexandria) play at being civilized and living like in the world before, yet wilfully ignoring abuse within their walls for the sake of convenience. He also went to Deanna and discussed it with her, but her answer was pretty much ""We need the doctor, so we're gonna do nothing""."
WastedGifs,305cnd,VikingSlayer,8,Tue Mar 24 19:39:05 2015 UTC,"to elaborate a bit more (spoilers obviously):  One person who died in the scavenging party (ricks group) died because of one of Deanna's group. The same member who basically killed off one of rick's also (somewhat) killed off one of his own during the same attack by running instead of trying to save him.  This member happened to be Deanna's son.  That same member that killed the two off pinned all blame on Rick's group, thereby creating tension between Deanna and Rick.  This is somewhat important to know for when Rick announced his Ricktatorship before he got clocked."

WastedGifs,305cnd,StinkybuttMcPoopface,2,Wed Mar 25 00:28:11 2015 UTC,"For me, it was partially this, and partially Lori, Andrea, some of hershel's surviving family members, Shane, and other stupid characters living so fucking long while being SO FUCKING STUPID. Like, how stupid and annoying 99% of the people are is painful for me to watch. I honestly was at the point that if any of them had died I would be just fine with it. I know now that all of the people I listed are dead, but I know they keep introducing new stupid characters, and Rick is also a fucking dramatic idiot and it's just really tiring.   Also, it takes so long to resolve any particular issue. They constantly take the longest and most convoluted and stupid routes to solving any issue that it gets boring and irritating. This is actually why the Syfy show Z Nation is actually better to me than TWC.   If there is some murderous psychopath trying to kill them or put them in danger, they kill that asshole as soon as they get the opportunity. If a situation is unrealistically dangerous, they run rather than fight. They don't try to take the moral high ground at the extremely high risk of their own lives or the lives of others and always get betrayed or have some completely dramatic and easily avoidable bullshit happen to them. They also more often than not actually look at the risk vs reward of doing something rather than worry about being the good guys. If a character does something reckless and stupid, they very often die as they probably would realistically, rather than have some long, drawn-out, dramatic ""omg did they die, are they gonna make it!? will someone save them!?"" sort of episode. It doesn't take more than an episode to resolve a problem outside of the major story arc, and the ""bad guys"" don't have overly intense monologues that try to paint them as scary or badass when no one would ever do that shit in real life.   Even with all of the cheesy shit and stuff that sounds like a 15 y/o came up with it in there, it manages to be more compelling than TWC, and I actually give a shit about the characters. It's also not insanely easy to figure out what's going to happen next, like it is with the walking dead. It is often so off-the-wall that they don't adhere to stereotypes, or something will come up and be resolved so quickly there isn't a lot of time to build up some sort of unnecessary mystery problem with blatant clues that build up over several episodes and then still somehow manage to surprise the characters and then cause the characters to blubber and cower over the issue for several more episodes before actually solving it.  TLDR: TWC takes too long to do anything or hold attention, and the characters are dumber than a sack of wet shit."

I was essentially in a shoot out when the above situation happened, I would pop off a few rounds in their direction and sit back as they attempted to unleash hell on me. One of the kids then did a James Bond esque twirl away from his bunker. I watched in slow motion as a let off a single shot and it dipped lower then I expected. His high pitch cries of pain after the paint (which was yellow, comically enough) exploded on his poor crotch (there is no way to type that sentence without it sounding terrible).

Speedballers also use more brittle paint that requires a quality(expensive) gun and hopper. Brittle paint prevents long shots from bouncing off the target. It also hurts a lot less, so they don't care if their ears and mouth get shot. Speedball is also one of the dumbest sports and a huge waste of money and resources."

As for the legitimacy of the sport, while I'm a stock woodsball guy myself, that's not really a fair assessment. Speedball, at its core, is a distillment of paintball skills and athleticism, whereas woodsball has its skill based in fieldcraft and larger strategy over brief tactics.   Speedballers have their skillset, woodsballers have theirs - I wouldn't stand a chance on a speedball field, but I could probably get a barrel tag on a speedballer in a woods match. What's more, speedball is actually possible to watch (if you can spectate a woodsball match, you're doing it wrong), and due to the nature of the field and the skillsets involved it's fairly entertaining to watch.  tl;dr You know what's worse than speedball?

WastedGifs,2zwcrr,medioxcore,1 point,Mon Mar 23 08:54:47 2015 UTC,"The thing about pads is that people hit harder with them on. When you add ""safety gear"", players inhibitions about causing bodily harm to opposing players drops. Nearly every one of the hits in the video I posted were harder than OP's. Not to say it wasn't a hard hit, but the worst of it was how the dude landed. Not the hit itself."
WastedGifs,2zwcrr,TheFrank314,2,Mon Mar 23 09:56:12 2015 UTC,Yep it ain't the smash that did the damage - standard big hit. Like you said it's having your head smashed into the ground on landing that makes this a tough one. Hard to compare US Football and Rugby for tackles - they are completely different. I like them both and enjoy celebrating the differences rather than arguing over them. Edit: I love rugby more tho :P
WastedGifs,2zwcrr,cfj1992,-2,Mon Mar 23 12:21:17 2015 UTC,they hit SO much harder in football
WastedGifs,2zwcrr,TheFrank314,6,Mon Mar 23 08:02:33 2015 UTC,"Rugby fan here and yes the hits in US Football are harder. Players wear helmets and pads and are allowed to go straight through players with dangerous tackles - the higher injury rates show this is a more deadly sport. However, I think rugby is tougher. They might seem similar but are really different sports. US Football is insanely high intensity bursts of tactical planning where everyone is 100% suited to their specific role i.e. the guys who go whole careers without touching the ball with big guts just there to cancel out their opposite number. That's great - I love all that. Rugby is not based on stop-start plays and after you get tackled you have to get straight back up and do it again..  over and over and over. There are no breaks. If you're a 'kicker' in rugby then you still have be an overall player as well - take and make tackles and run. Mauls and rucks in rugby are great to watch. This might sound dumb but if anything I think the introduction of pads and helmets to US Football made it more dangerous due to the crazy spear tackles that are allowed and the way you are allowed to simply send a guy flying without worry if he lands on his head.   tl;dr - US Football hits harder and is more deadly but Rugby is tougher and more enjoyable... IMO"
WastedGifs,2zwcrr,Spaissy,-3,Mon Mar 23 12:31:19 2015 UTC,"If you're gonna base how 'good' a sport is based on the tackles, you obviously know very little about sports in general and therefore don't offer very valid input in objectional comparison between rugby and football."

Wasn't a high tackle. He was 90 degrees to the tackler and so there was painful looking whiplash thing. The tackler didn't dunk the dude just the size difference caused him to rotate super quick onto his head. Tacklers have the responsibility to bring a player down safely, but there was nothing that could be done in this situation."

WastedGifs,2zq61m,StickmanPirate,7,Sat Mar 21 00:14:46 2015 UTC,"Weird, I was gonna say this was terrible form. That's from a rugby perspective though.  Anyone who knows about both games, why are the tackling styles so different? Is it because American Football players have the padding so they can get hit harder? Or is there a technical reason, does one style of tackling require you to put more effort in or make it more difficult to recover from and so it better suited to each game?"
WastedGifs,2zq61m,manabanana21,12,Sat Mar 21 01:22:29 2015 UTC,"Its the pads thing, in addition to field positioning. In rugby field position doesn't mean much at all, while it is everything in football. In football you want the runner to stop. Them advancing makes it easier for them to score. However in rugby the main point is bringing them down. They don't care if that happens while the guy gets a couple more yards while that could mean everything in football."
WastedGifs,2zq61m,Slatts02,0,Sat Mar 21 01:31:45 2015 UTC,Field position doesn't mean much in rugby? What are you on about?  The whole point of the game is to work your way into the oppositions half and score a try.  Its very difficult to score a long way from the goal line. Players also kick regularly to push the opponents back.  Have you even watch the game?
WastedGifs,2zq61m,SockUnicorn,10,Sat Mar 21 02:00:37 2015 UTC,But you don't have 3-4 tries at a time to do so.
WastedGifs,2zq61m,manabanana21,6,Sat Mar 21 02:49:16 2015 UTC,What I meant was in football you only get three tries to get ten yards. In rugby you don't have those situations where one or two yards make a massive difference in the final score.

Without the full story you've got a guy standing there getting thrown to the ground instead of the true jackass trying to start fist fights in the city streets being detained aggressively.

WastedGifs,2yie9w,NapoleonBonerparts,2,Thu Mar 12 02:53:05 2015 UTC,"No, not unless his knees are terrible. This gif is dumb, because the guy being tackled is stagnant. It's not impossible to tackle someone standing, but tackling someone standing, expecting, and prepared is not something I'd do. Really, he should be running and she should A. either be in his position or B. running at him. From there, she can wrap the legs and use his own momentum against him or, and this is harder, but some fuckers can break leg tackles like nobodies business, put her should in his gut, lift, and drive.  Instead, she went for a hit, which is something safeties and other DBs do. It's effective, but you have about as much of a chance of injuring yourself as you do the other guy because it is pur collision. The other ways of tackling are much safer and effective, so long as you're strong enough."

These flips can get really hard to time until you start to get confident enough at them to straighten out your body to stop the rotation. It's kick hard-look for the landing with your head first then bring your body around and extend to stop rotation and reach out and stick the landing. Because you can stop the rotation by reaching out for the landing, you can actually get good enough to land 100% of flips without your timing being perfect for each jump; that's also what gives you the flexibility to do the trick on stuff that isn't a easy tabletop that you've done 100 times.   Anyway, I used to compete a lot in my youth and I love seeing people have the balls to learn new tricks!"

WastedGifs,2xwkdz,tacobells_cannon,4,Wed Mar 4 20:33:31 2015 UTC,"Yea he did. I guess the safest way to land into snow like that is on your back, but at an angle where your feet are in the air. I think he over rotated a little to where he was almost landing on his head, but for the most part that's the form these ""cliff jump""ers use to land in snow."
WastedGifs,2xwkdz,Pithong,1 point,Thu Mar 5 00:27:08 2015 UTC,Landing feet down would have shattered his legs and risk something like a broken shin impaling his head.  Light snow has great compression qualities and slows you down at a ramping rate.  Landing head first with no objects to hit is far safer in that situation when wearing skis.  The backpack wouldn't have done anything.  He may have been wearing spine protection under his jacket.

So still the helmsman fault but no speed was not a factor. Boats are not cars, you always have boats flat out; this guy just didn't leave anywhere near the space needed for passing other boats. Reckless. I've been hit from large boat wash before and it can get to 10ft. Hitting that at speed is just dumb, you can see it a mile a way."

WastedGifs,2xscre,j3utton,8,Tue Mar 3 18:19:11 2015 UTC,"I am pointing out that you said speed wasn't a factor and then said it was. I also think you need to reevaluate what a ""factor"" is. There can be many.     And yeah, it could be a factor. In that if speeds weren't so high the car changing lanes would have had more time to react and it may not have gone down the way it did. Or the result of the mistake caused more damage than would have happened if the cars were moving at a slower speed. Both results would list speed as a ""factor"" in the accident.    That being said, changing lanes on the highway isn't the same as going full throttle on a lake into the wake of another boat."
WastedGifs,2xscre,AngloQuebecois,-1,Tue Mar 3 18:37:33 2015 UTC,Looking at it it seems as if he recognizes his mistake and tries to drop the throttle but then loses his balance and puts it back up. He seems to be using it to support himself and he's very unsteady so that probably explains it.

It's simple physics moron. Mass times acceleration (or deacceleration in this case).  People ended up with concusions, broken bones and spinal injuries.  If he had been going slower, or knew how to drive a boat, that wouldn't have happened.  Police cited him at over 60-70 mph, a passenger claims they were doing over 100. Yea... speed wasn't a factor.

WastedGifs,2wnlvb,a_sloth,-11,Sat Feb 21 21:43:39 2015 UTC,In what world is calling someone's hair gay not derogatory?   It's implying that gay people have a set hair style  It's implying that anything but a person's orientation can be gay  It's implying that a guy can't have a certain hair style without being gay.  See this is why no one likes the GG fanbase. You're all a bunch of socially awkward fuckboys. Downvote me all you want but you're still wrong.
WastedGifs,2wnlvb,a_sloth,0,Sat Feb 21 22:05:18 2015 UTC,"Well if this isn't a prime example of someone being closed minded, I don't know what is. Quit being so black and white about how words can be used. There are plenty of ways where /u/a_sloth meant it in a positive manner. One such way being that he thinks Arin's hair is totally fabulous. Languages evolve constantly. Why do we say plenty of once derogatory/offensive/insulting/negative words in positive manners today or vice versa? The main point is that you don't know how he's using the word, but you seem so sure that he means it negatively. And then you go on to generalize a whole community. Well done."

The story is incredibly different than the TV series; like in-fucking-credibly different, but the main characters are still involved. Just read the first book, cover to cover, and you'll know what I'm talking about.  I got through the first two seasons of TWD series, when my brother introduced me to the graphic novels. I immediately made the transfer over to the books, stopped watching the show, and am 18 books in.   Carl still pisses you off in the books, like really pisses you off - but as the books progress, you gain a lot more respect for Carl than in the series. He's so much of a whiny little bitch in the TV series.  The series is literally a fucking soap opera in comparison to the books.  Disclaimer: The first TWD graphic novel was done by an incredible artist, and contained an excellent amount of detail; however, due to him requiring more time to produce the books than the publishers cared for, they switched to another (less detail oriented) but still talented artist. So don't be alarmed by the change in art from the second book onward, you're still reading the same series, just with a different artist."

Is that a reason for you to cry out and name call random redditors? It seems you brought it up initially after some guy said he didn't like the walking dead anymore. Did this hurt you because you like the walking dead? Are you now attacking a popular show in hopes of wounding those around you the way they wounded you? I don't think that will work.

WastedGifs,2wffbr,offtheclip,6,Thu Feb 19 19:07:22 2015 UTC,"This reminds me of a time when I was tree planting. It was the end of the season and we were having a going away party at the camp. There was this old Breaking Bad camper that was full of trash and drunk us decided to burn it down. We poured a bunch of gasoline in side it and filled a couple of plastic milk jugs with gas and placed them in the window, then another tree planter lit an arrow on fire and shot the milk jug. So that was all well and good, but we couldn't just have a burning camper so we decided to up the anti. My boss had an old shit heap of a beetle and decided that he would make it jump the camper. We made a pile off firewood and used a couple of walls from an old shed for a ramp. Then my boss aimed his car and jammed the gas peddle with a log letting her lose. It was beautiful, the car flew over the burning camper like the general lee escaping hell. The only problem was it kept going after it landed and since my boss didn't tie the steering wheel the fucking thing served all over the campsite flattening two tents before eventually crashing into the woods.   TLDR We made a beetle jump over a burning camper. It was glorious."

WastedGifs,2wb3im,Odinskriger,3,Wed Feb 18 19:36:40 2015 UTC,"I don't get it. Is it normal in the USA to share a room with other people in college? Here in Europe, everyone always has a room for him/herself."
WastedGifs,2wb3im,ColdCutKitKat,5,Thu Feb 19 02:11:41 2015 UTC,"It depends on the dorm. Many universities have cheaper ones with shared rooms and more expensive ones that are more like apartments (shared living room and bathroom, individual bedrooms). At my university, it seemed that most people lived in a cheap shared dorm their first year and then a nicer individual bedroom dorm the next year (almost like a rite of passage for being finished with freshman year). After that, I'd say the majority of students rented apartments off campus."
WastedGifs,2wb3im,Odinskriger,3,Thu Feb 19 03:12:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the situation in Europe is mostly like the second you described. The kitche, the toilet and/or bathroom will often be shared with roommates. The internet is often shared as well. Personally I prefer this sort of living than the rooms in the USA. I mean, you have no privacy in the American system. What if you want to masturbate? What if you want to talk on skype? What if the other roommate wants to stay up longer?"
WastedGifs,2wb3im,Doofe_N7,3,Thu Feb 19 03:23:18 2015 UTC,"What if you want to masturbate? What if you want to talk on skype? What if the other roommate wants to stay up longer?   To answer your first question, I did it in the shower or the bathroom. Your second, one would ideally just ask the other to leave the room for a bit; there are study lounges and common rooms where the other person could go. The third, you'd work it out between yourselves somehow. One roommate wants to watch TV, the second asks them to use headphones, etc. Teaches conflict resolution."

It's the same principle that makes people pass out during or after squats.  Always breath when lifting weights.

I then started to lose my vision, to which I thought ""I should probably kneel down."" I didn't have enough time, though. I fell out of the shower and smashed head-first into the wall across from me. I had to lay there for a few minutes before I could function fully enough to get up and walk back to my dorm room. I felt sick that entire day.

WastedGifs,2usr7y,najlepsza,23,Wed Feb 4 22:44:47 2015 UTC,"Not too good, as evidenced by her fall. When you get older your body simply cannot react as quickly as it could when you were 20. Your neurons deteriorate with age.  If she experienced a broken hip (which is incredibly likely depending on how old she is) the store has a massive lawsuit on their hands.  I never understood the prevalence of these doors. They are rather unsafe and ineffective as they take longer for people to enter/exit the store."
WastedGifs,2usr7y,Juan23Four5,23,Thu Feb 5 03:13:22 2015 UTC,"Actually there has been some research to suggest that you simply forget how to fall. Basically the premise is that as a toddler-teen you fall A LOT, and by the time your body has stopped growing you become very aware of how to stop falling, how to catch yourself and how to compensate for blows from things bumping into you.  But as an adult... you don't really trip. It is probably fairly common for an adult of 25-50 to never trip fall or get bumped into ever and by the time you are 60-70 you've simply never even thought about it. However around this time your senses start to deteriorate and well, you start to fall again. However now your bones are frail and weak and the falls can be devistating.   They actually put seniors on treadmills and purposely tripped them several times (While they wore harnesses and would never actually fall to injury) and after several sessions the elderly were able to better catch themselves when they fell. Just like you would expect from a much younger individual."

WastedGifs,2up6nu,Rainfly_X,3,Wed Feb 4 14:02:34 2015 UTC,"I got myself real good one time, not unlike in the gif. School trip in 7th grade. Smacked myself hard in the back of the head with the snowboard, thank god for helmets. I remember getting up, astounded that I could fold in half that way and take as little damage as I did, face and lungs notwithstanding. Got in a few more hours of snowboarding, then we went home.  I think it was two days later. Woke up with an excruciating pain in my neck. Jolts of electric pain, forcing me to keep my neck in a certain position. This actually woke me up early, and I spent the predawn hours locked in place, doing my best to understand how not to antagonize the nerves.  After a few times of my parents calling out for me to get ready for school (and me being scared to yell back), they finally came in to see what the matter was. I'd pulled some shit before, so they didn't believe me, and dragged me out of bed by my feet. My delicate head position was not only immediately disturbed, but I fell to the floor once I was far enough off the bed. And yes, I was screaming the entire time.  I wasn't taken seriously until I'd been on the floor crying for awhile. We were able to get me to the couch, and mom called me in sick, and booked a doctor's appointment. It felt like forever, waiting for the appointment time, waiting in the car...  It turned out to not be a broken neck. It was a muscle spasm. There was a muscle in my neck, on the right side, that was in a continuous state of contracting as fucking hard as it could. If I remember correctly, the main part of the treatment was muscle relaxants. Which, it's fun to take pills when you can't move your neck.  To this day, the right side of my neck is thicker from being so aggressively exercised about a decade ago. It's much less pronounced now. I suspect that eventually, maybe in another ten years, there will be no physical evidence in my body anymore. But holy hell, did it ever give me a good bar/reddit story."

WastedGifs,2up6nu,white_Steve_Nash,3,Wed Feb 4 03:15:07 2015 UTC,"It's not bad advice. He's not saying lean over at the waist, he's saying the guy needs to shift more weight to his front foot (or at least balance the distribution a bit better) during the turn. The guy in the gif was too far into the backseat to switch edges safely at that speed."
WastedGifs,2up6nu,BeefsteakTomato,1 point,Wed Feb 4 03:35:15 2015 UTC,An attempt to slow down heavy before leveling out and he would not have fallen. He brought to much speed matched with little experience to the flat and caught an edge.

WastedGifs,2up6nu,SquishyDelishy,2,Wed Feb 4 08:19:40 2015 UTC,"After a certain point, you can - and should - do whatever works best, but I've found beginners tend to shy away from the hill, put all their weight on their back foot to try and stay vertical, and then bite it when the front of their board becomes unstable. Forcing them to use their front foot more tends to help."
WastedGifs,2up6nu,BeefsteakTomato,1 point,Wed Feb 4 03:57:47 2015 UTC,If you put all your wait on your back end its practically impossible to bring your board around unless you're in pow.
WastedGifs,2up6nu,SquishyDelishy,1 point,Wed Feb 4 04:18:23 2015 UTC,not if you:  -Open your knees to shift your weight  or  -pop your board by using it's camber / your legs
WastedGifs,2up6nu,BeefsteakTomato,2,Wed Feb 4 08:58:10 2015 UTC,Well this guy isn't doing either and an easy way to fix it is just to put more weight on your front foot. Its an easy and simple way to learn to ride that doesn't require a lot of skill or a cambered board.
WastedGifs,2up6nu,SquishyDelishy,1 point,Wed Feb 4 10:45:49 2015 UTC,"You can ride like that, but you'll have a severe loss in edge control unless the snow is soft.  In general, ice ~ 70-80% of weight on front. Hard pack maybe 65%, soft packed pow, around 50-50? Once you start getting into the deep fluffies, then it becomes the opposite maybe 70% distributed to your rear foot.   Following this basic plan when starting will help you out a lot, but remember these numbers are over simplified for the purpose of explanation."

WastedGifs,2ufo8x,TheLunat1c,18,Mon Feb 2 05:51:39 2015 UTC,"This video is funny and all, this is really not that far off from reality to be honest. I have attended Korean middle, and some part of high school, this kind of thing happens every day, and each class has one or two kids they designate ""Punching bags"", usually picking on shy kids or some who has nothing special (like, academics, who won't be noticed by the teacher).  Korean school's so called ""Gangsters"" work like they are the shit and they pick on certain kids, who won't be able to get out of their status unless they move half way across the country because Korean school keeps 30-40 students in one class for a year, only rotating the set subjects and any class they advance to next year will have either the bullies or bullies' friends, so cycle continues.  The kicker is, there is no real punishment given to them. if the kid who gets bullied tells on the teacher, maybe the parents will be called with no real punishment other than having to apologize in front of the parents and the kid. All seems fine, but now the bullies will act even worse considering they have been ""shamed"", so most of the kids who gets bullied can't even consider reporting because they are afraid of paybacks.  I guess I just got kind of off topic. /rant"
WastedGifs,2ufo8x,crappysurfer,6,Sun Feb 1 21:56:35 2015 UTC,"I went to a private boarding school. With a large Korean population. One year, this ring of rather concealed bullying was exposed.

My highschool had some Korean students like that, who followed their parents to Kia factory in Georgia, and their attitude around American students were pure shit. I don't speak Korean well, but I understand them and all they talked about was pretty racial, how people looked(ugly, fat etc.). Of course, the number of them are pretty low and our school was known for big football team and there were atleast 3-4 really big football players in each class (who were super nice and always helps others), so any sort of foul behavior would result in their bad side"
WastedGifs,2ufo8x,TheLunat1c,5,Mon Feb 2 03:25:17 2015 UTC,After many years of working in a wide variety of Asian countries I can say that Asians take racism to a whole new level.   In Asia you don't just get racism based on nationality bit also based on a fairly complicated class system as well. Chinese Singaporeans don't like Malaysian Singaporeans but all agree that Malaysians are low. Hong Kong Chinese see main landers and second class and new territory residents are not much better but they are all better than other Asians and so it goes. Black people are lower than any Asian and white people are just above them.  Like everything they do most of Asia has perfected racism and taken it to a new level.  It always makes me laugh when an Asian accuses anyone of being racist.
WastedGifs,2ufo8x,OneSoggyBiscuit,4,Mon Feb 2 03:32:20 2015 UTC,"I have a friend from China. He tried explaining this type of racism to me. He summed it up with something along the lines of ""Basically everyone looks for a reason to hate each other."""
WastedGifs,2ufo8x,GoldenGlowEstates,4,Mon Feb 2 05:58:07 2015 UTC,"That hate runs deep. There is  basically a pecking order in Asia with Japan, China, Korea etc at the top and the poor nations at the bottom.

When Czech and Slovakia were one country (and not really a big one even together), Prague people had quasi-racist slurs for every area and ethnicity east from Prague, each was one or another flavor of ""Mongol"", for example the Hungarian minority in Slovakia was called ""pepper Mongol"", for the liking of spicy food. In return, Prague people were teased by calling them Swedes, because 400 years ago during the Thirty Years War Prague was occupied by Swedish troops who were apparently popular with the local girls because they made a lot of blond kids."

Good for big guy. No one got really hurt and I bet there aren't many kids willing to fuck with him after seeing this video.

WastedGifs,2ubvnn,TheSecondLaw,9,Sat Jan 31 22:32:14 2015 UTC,What. The. Fuck..  Her feet landed on the other girl's chest. How is that faked???
WastedGifs,2ubvnn,ThatScottishBesterd,19,Sun Feb 1 00:46:43 2015 UTC,"How is that faked???   The term 'faked' is thrown around by non-wrestling fans a lot. There's this pervading notion that just because the outcomes are predetermined that what goes on in the ring is a great deal of smoke and mirrors, and that there isn't much athleticism or risk involved.  They simple reality is that a lot of what these guys and girls do in the ring hurts. When someone picks you up and slams you down from six plus feet in the air, you can't really 'fake' that. Every bump you take does damage, and shortens your career (among wrestlers there's what's called a 'bump counter', which is the unseen, unknown, yet unavoidable counter-down for how many falls your body has left in it before it gives out).  The days of wrestling being two fat, greasy, out of shape guys slapping each other is one that's still floating around the mainstream despite the fact that it hasn't been accurate for decades. Modern wrestling is a fast paced, athletic contest where the real competition is trying to put on the best match on the card and make sure people get their money's worth.  A lot of wrestlers are willing to do crazy stunts to get that done, and they often get hurt doing it.  So the short answer to your question, ""how is that faked?"". It isn't. It's exactly as real as it looks."
WastedGifs,2ubvnn,Wail_Bait,11,Sun Feb 1 04:10:45 2015 UTC,"It's exactly as real as it looks.   The best example of that is the infamous Undertaker vs Mankind match. The first few minutes are just a generic scripted event, but shit goes crazy when Mankind gets off the stretcher and resumes the fight. It's not really a good fight because Mankind could have easily died at several points in the match, but there's no way you could watch that fight and think it was fake."
WastedGifs,2ubvnn,Bassdistortion,4,Sun Feb 1 05:45:20 2015 UTC,"Damn both of them took beatings! I hope they got huge bonuses for that performance, they went the extra 10 miles."
WastedGifs,2ubvnn,AMeowingCat,6,Sun Feb 1 08:09:27 2015 UTC,"Fun fact! The first bump that Mankind took where he came off the cell and crashed onto the table was scripted and set to happen.  The second bump on the top of the cage was also scripted (or at the very least called) but Mankind was not supposed to go through the cell. The cell gave way unexpectedly and Mankind fell to the floor, the chair falling with him which knocked a tooth into his nostril as well as knocking him out temporarily. A friend of Mankind (Mick Foley) named Terry Funk has gone on record saying he believed his friend to be dead in the ring after the second bump."
WastedGifs,2ubvnn,bengarrr,4,Sun Feb 1 15:28:11 2015 UTC,"Foley gets all the props for that match, which is fair. But Undertaker did the whole thing with a broken ankle. Most notable when he jumps down inside the cage you can see him hobble for a second."

WastedGifs,2ubvnn,sawasdee,1 point,Wed Feb 18 07:36:30 2015 UTC,"It's exactly as real as it looks.   No, their whole skill is to exaggerate damage while doing as little as possible.  Thats why when she jumps on the girls chest she does it in a way that her knees tuck in as to spread out the impact over a longer period of time instead of all at once just the same as suspension absorbs the shock over a longer period of time while transferring some of the energy into heat. Also when she jumps on the girls face she actually doesn't, she moves her feet to the sides of the girls head before landing otherwise you wouldn't be able to do that more than once or twice a year with a broken face.  Im not saying its lame or its not painful but saying its as real as it looks is just not true. I don't think anyone is denying that it takes athletic skill to pull off most of the moves and physical strength."

Professionals know how to make it look real without you having to break their skull in.  Edit: I realize I didn't write this very well. I meant to say that professionals can make the fake look real.

WastedGifs,2uabsk,Highw4ySt4r,2,Sat Jan 31 23:23:13 2015 UTC,"When landing downhill your front tire should contact the ramp first, or both at the same time. Landing on your back wheel downhill is not recommended because you can get kicked forwards like this or manual down the ramp and fall backwards. It was a good attempt though, the front flip is one of the tougher tricks in biking. I don't think it had to do with the ramp or being horizontal."
