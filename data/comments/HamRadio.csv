HamRadio,3e66jr,-Axon-,2,Wed Jul 22 06:54:22 2015 UTC,"Yes, in the US the regulation says every 10 minutes at minimum.  But usually when you listen to a CW beacon, the beacon transmits semi-continuously.  Usually something like: DE <CALL>/B <GRID> <keydown> <QRP keydown>.  Then a pause for a couple seconds and it starts over.  BTW, the more active sub is /r/amateurradio. Cheers."

HamRadio,3e42fj,franklloydwhite,5,Tue Jul 21 20:12:17 2015 UTC,"A 30w limit is recommended for non-voice modes to keep the final amp cool and/or to keep things like IMD performance in check. You can run higher or lower power levels, but keep in mind that the limiting factor is the heat generated in the PA during transmit. Digital modes are sometimes 100% duty cycle and the radio will not handle this at 100w. Nothing will stop you from doing this, mind you, but the radio will eventually stop transmitting due to an overheating condition.  If you really want 100w digital operation, you'll need an external amplifier or a radio rated for continuous output such as an ICOM IC-M710 marine HF radio. This one for example, can do 150w RTTY (or any other digital mode).  Don't let this discourage you, 30w on digital modes can go a long way. You might need less power with a long-transmitting mode like OLIVIA, and you could run more power in a short burst such as PSK63/125."
HamRadio,3e42fj,miningdroid,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:35:47 2015 UTC,"Great answer. Thanks for the detail.  If the limitation is within the radio and not the tuner, why would LDG put it in their specs? Why not just leave it up to the radio mfg to specify the limitation?"
HamRadio,3e42fj,hamsterdave,2,Tue Jul 21 20:50:31 2015 UTC,"Because a lot of hams disregard that advice and abuse their equipment, or they may have radios like the TS-480HX, which is 200w PEP and could probably safely handle 50-70w on digital.   Those hams would torch their tuner, and then complain about how it says 100w maximum. This puts the responsibility to know your equipment limitations on the user, not the manufacturer."

It is about anyone that wants to use satellite and/or HD antenna TV.

HamRadio,3cldtk,gwillen,-19,Thu Jul 9 16:52:42 2015 UTC,"Gosh, where to start. Okay, let me start with . . . you misspelled amateur. It goes downhill from there, my friend. Like riding a sled over a cliff. Do not transmit on any frequency even at very low power if the FCC mandates a license requirement for that frequency. All of the information necessary for you to become a licensed Technician class amateur radio operator is available to you for free on the internet. Or from your local library. Also for free. Or depending where you live, some ham radio clubs periodically offer free (or very low cost to cover materials) licensing classes for Technician. Or, the most expensive way to go, but not too costly, there is course instruction available from some for-profit websites. In other words, you put the cart before the horse in buying that cheap junky radio, and in doing so, it sounds to me like you're dead set on running the risk of incurring yourself a hefty fine. A final caution: If you bootleg on the local ham repeaters, hams will move heaven and earth to triangulate your signal, and if they ID you, and they will, they WILL turn you in to the FCC. And all hams who know about it, which means every single ham in your area, will shun you and will have nothing to do with you in the future. Ever. Word. Period."
HamRadio,3cldtk,I-Smell-Smoke,8,Wed Jul 8 23:00:50 2015 UTC,"And all hams who know about it, which means every single ham in your area, will shun you and will have nothing to do with you in the future. Ever. Word. Period.   I have a differing story. There was someone on a local repeater using a fake callsign to talk with people. It took us a couple of weeks to figure it out, honestly. He was being somewhat belligerent and a bit rude (which prompted us to lookup the callsign), and got grumpy when we started letting people know that they were talking with an unlicensed operator. They left the system for about a month, and then that person eventually got their license and is now back on the system, and is behaving much better. Nobody has called him out as being ""that guy who was using the system unlicensed"", but we all know it's him, and we're OK with that, because he's doing things the right way now."
HamRadio,3cldtk,efosmark,5,Thu Jul 9 00:11:50 2015 UTC,"The FCC has designated the MURS frequency set can be used by operators without a license, you misunderstood my question. The radio I purchased is technically not certified to operate on these frequencies, I wanted to know if this will cause an issue for me. I am opting to broadcast on the MURS frequency until I receive my license, which I am in the process of, because I am not licensed and would not like to cause myself problems. I'm not sure where you got the idea I'd be broadcasting on ham frequencies without a license, I basically am going for a glorified walkie talkie here.  P.S, If nitpicking at my common spelling of ""amateur"" makes you happy,  that's great, you will find much satisfaction in life as many English words have lost the french ""-eur"" ending in common speak."

HamRadio,3cldtk,kqvrp,-4,Thu Jul 9 01:34:19 2015 UTC,"In rereading my original reply to you, I now feel that I was heavy handed in my cautionary advice, which you openly solicited. Spelling aside, the point I was trying to make (and apparently failed at) was that I feared the temptation of owning a ham-capable radio might be the apple in the Garden of Eden, if you get my meaning. As for ""technically not certified"" I feel that speaks for itself with no need for further input from me. Question: Of the MURS users, who do you think is going to want to talk to you? Now don't take offense as I don't mean that about you personally. It's just that MURS users aren't sitting in their sunny backyards staring at their FCC approved radio, thinking to themselves, ""Oh, I wish I had some nice total stranger to chat away the day with."" Really, besides kids with Spiderman walkie talkies, I can't imagine there are any adult users looking for that kind of MURS radio satisfaction. Your intention as you describe it, is ham radio (and you don't have a license) or CB (and you don't need a license). Oh, and I'll clarify my criticism of your Baofeng. A lot of people buy them for various reasons, including hams, because they're cheap. Cheap being the watchword. Ever hear the expression: ""You get what you pay for?"" The Chinese translation of that is Baofeng. Seriously, if you can, get your money back. Start saving for a name brand ham HT and by the time you're licensed, celebrate by buying a high quality one. It'll last you for many years, unlike the Baofeng which may or may not last many days. (Yes, I know, I too was charmed, and I wanted a great radio for $30, and true, lots of people on the net brag what a great radio they are. But then I read the many other reviews, and read the many gripes. I particularly found it amusing when people bitched their $30 HT just suddenly crapped. Their $30 HT just crapped? Really? Hard to believe, isn't it? Okay, I've said my piece (again) and so here's where I say sorry, and I hope we're buds again. PS: bypass MURS and FRS and GMRS and CB and get your ham-Tech. The hobby is worth your time and effort and is also worth your discretionary money."
HamRadio,3cldtk,hvyhitter,8,Thu Jul 9 01:39:00 2015 UTC,"I actually disagree - I think the UV-5R is one of the best things that could happen to this hobby. As a repeater machine, it's capable enough, and taking any step (even a cheap and imperfect one) into actually using ham radio is waay better than being unwilling to jump into the hobby because of the price.  I actually like the buttons and audio from my UV-5R better than from my TH-F6A. Granted, it's a PITA to program without a cable, but the cable is like $5.  MURS usage from a UV-5R is technically illegal, but so is jaywalking. If you don't feel the need to be legalistic, it'll be fine. Just stick to legal power and follow good operating principles (no swearing, jamming, etc). I think you'll find the bands pretty empty, though, unless you've got a friend nearby who wants to talk with you.  Here's a semi-legit use for UV-5R and MURS: I'm going to Burning Man with a number of hams and non-hams, and between the hams, we have enough cheap Chinese HTs to hand out to the rest of our camp. We'll monitor the MURS channel for camp communication and use the BRARC repeater for ham-talk. :)"
HamRadio,3cldtk,I-Smell-Smoke,3,Thu Jul 9 05:23:09 2015 UTC,"I actually listened to a conversation on a 2m repeater about how bad the Chinese radios are. It was 4 guys and they went on and on for like 45 minutes. I was sitting on the dock July 5th after sleeping overnight on the boat because of traffic, listening to them with a cup of coffee 7am in the morning. My little handheld programmed for 2m, MURS, FRS, Sams Club and Marine frequencies too.   lol   I think I paid 23 dollars for mine on amazon. If it breaks throw it out. buy a new one. or keep a spare.

HamRadio,3cldtk,kqvrp,-2,Thu Jul 9 12:43:27 2015 UTC,"I won't debate there are some rave reviews on Baofeng products; your own is duly noted. Me, I'd buy one in a heartbeat if there was a way for me to tell the good ones from the bad. You too speak of technically illegal. I was trying to convey to OP the best way was the legal way, and not to cut corners. You know: good operating practices, all that stuff in Part 97 you might remember from your tests, and for him to do so from the get-go, even before he's licensed. And btw, did he strike you as having beaucoup disposable income? I stand by my belief that it would be to his best interest to save up for the radio of his dreams and wait to buy it after he is licensed. If for no other reason than, say, the blush goes off the rose with the amount of studying necessary for him to pass the amatuer test and/or he simply decides ham radio isn't for him. And yes, I was very concerned the temptation to bootleg would be too much to resist and he'd get in trouble. But now he can thank you for taking his side, and so, what possibly could go wrong if he bends the rules to fit his desires just a little bit. Well, anyway, one final thought and them I'm done with this. Take the kid with you to Burning Man so he has someone to talk to on MURS."
HamRadio,3cldtk,jmsnides,2,Thu Jul 9 23:17:41 2015 UTC,"Buy one from Amazon - they have 30 day free returns if the product is defective (and they won't quibble with you about what defective means - if it doesn't meet your needs or desires, send it back on their dime). I suggest a UV-B5 - they have nicer receivers and a rotary encoder, and they're only about $10 more. Do a quick test against your other HT with the same (or similar) antenna. I find the APRS frequency to be a good choice, because there will always be a few marginal signals that will open one radio but not the other. Then try talking into all of your favorite repeaters. At my old QTH, both the UV-B5 and the UV-5R could hit every repeater that I used (and all that my TH-F6A could). At my new place, none of them (nor my F6A) can hit any repeaters from inside. :(  As for the technically illegal bit - sure, I'll give that to you. Law isn't for law's sake, though, and it is completely separate from good operating practices. I've always felt that if you try to live life like a good person, you shouldn't worry about committing a few victimless crimes.

Also a monoband 700 MHz antenna may work locally but you will want multiple frequency bands for any trips away from home. So a multiband antenna should really be used.
HamRadio,3b30ca,molo1134,3,Thu Jun 25 15:57:51 2015 UTC,The only thing you would be reusable is the hole in the car. Everything else will need to be 4g specific
HamRadio,3b30ca,DeathByFarts,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:47:25 2015 UTC,FYI LTE uses a few different frequencies. The tower I pull my Verizon 4G off of is 800Mhz. You probably want to get a multi-band omni antenna. Something like this I found from a quick eBay search that gives 2 dBi at  698-960MHz & 1710-2170MHz.

HamRadio,3b1pna,applehat,2,Thu Jun 25 14:56:15 2015 UTC,"With 10m/11m (especially with the 4watt limit on CB) you need a pretty big antenna to get the gain you will be after. A simple dipole that can be hung and taken back down may be the best option, if you don't want to draw a bunch of attention."
HamRadio,3b1pna,applehat,1 point,Thu Jun 25 15:17:09 2015 UTC,Thanks. Would you be able to recommend some specific antennas? Perhaps one or two on the small size and one or two on the larger size that would get the gain I'd want?
HamRadio,3b1ddc,charliemic5,7,Thu Jun 25 04:31:38 2015 UTC,"It is unusual to find psk31 on VHF.  One factor is that it is designed to be used on a SSB radio while most VHF radios are FM only.   For weak signals on VHF, JT65 is more common. You will find terrestrial JT65 on 6m, and EME JT65 on 2m. Again this requires a SSB transceiver.   Remember techs have access to 10m digital as well. You will see more psk31 and RTTY there.   BTW, the more active subreddit is /r/amateurradio. 73"

HamRadio,3aronk,whipped_honey,8,Tue Jun 23 07:49:24 2015 UTC,"No you can not.  In order to transmit on FRS or GMRS frequencies you need a radio which has been certified by the FCC to transmit on those bands. The baofeng radios do not have that certification, and so transmitting on those channels with one is illegal.  GMRS has an additional requirement that the user must be licensed. There is no test, just a license fee.  Even if you have a valid ham radio operator license you still can not use that radio to transmit on FRS or GMRS bands because the radio is not certified for those bands, only ham radio bands.  In short -- there is no frequency on which you can legally transmit using that radio with out a license. With a ham radio license you can transmit on ham bands, but still not FRS or GMRS. You can listen all you want though. No licenses or certifications are required for listening."

If emergency preparedness is what you are interested in, you should learn to effectively communicate on the air.  Otherwise, you may not be heard or understood during an emergency!  If you would rather just turn something on and talk, look into CB, FRS or MURS radios.  They have a number preprogrammed channels, and are generally easier to just turn on and operate."

HamRadio,39cqcq,vegasmacguy,1 point,Thu Jun 11 20:47:29 2015 UTC,"Use the MURS frequencies until you get your license. Set the power to low for each station.  Once you get your license use repeaterbook.com to find local repeaters in your area. You can also check the sites for your local amateur radio clubs or just google <Your City> Repeater List. Two of the most common 2 Meter simplex stations are 146.52MHz, and 144.200MHz. In my area a lot of people use 146.55MHz since we have 146.52 Listeners scattered all over the valley. For 70 Centimeter the calling frequencies are 446.000MHz and according to ARRL 432.10 (I've never used that one.)  You can look up the ARRL Band Plans here for more information on what frequencies you should be using. For the Boefeng UV5R+ you should look at 2 Meter and 70 Centimeter bands. Use the scanning function of your Boefeng to determine what frequencies are popular according to the band plan for simplex operation.  Keep in mind that broadcasting without a license carries a very heavy fine and there are HAMs that are very good at triangulating a signal and have no problems reporting bad behavior to keep the bands clean. So do not broadcast on amateur bands without a license."

It costs almost nothing and doesn't require all that much effort to get a technicians license."
HamRadio,39cqcq,flickerfly,-12,Thu Jun 11 04:27:39 2015 UTC,"From the things I hear, the license is bullshit anyway. You pay for it and therefore can cheat, it's like taking a boating test online. I can have someone take it for me if I am ignorant enough to want to take it. Everything that's on these test you learn from doing.

HamRadio,39cqcq,skarphace,5,Thu Jun 11 04:57:05 2015 UTC,"TL;DR Few Dad's are going to hand over the keys to the car before teaching where the breaks,  lights and turn signals are. It just isn't smart.   Your SHTF sources are ill informed. When something really happens, just knowing a few frequencies will poorly prepare you to operate. Poor operating practice will result in you having problems with other operators, especially where pre-existing band plans exist. There are lots of people trained not only as Technicians, but as specialists in various disaster needs like passing formal written traffic, coordination of emergency services, search and rescue, weather spotting, etc. Having a radio on the frequency doesn't mean you can play an active role. These people have setup procedures that are used to be effective and efficient. If you don't know that, you add to the chaos and cause further problems.   In other words, you are welcome to invest yourself into it and learn all this, but skipping that knowledge isn't wise and giving it to you without training promotes abuse and chaos in true disasters. It also devalues the work of those who have already invested their time into this and continue to do so practicing on a regular basis to keep their skills sharp."

Oh and don't skimp on the power supply! Go for either a linear one or a clean switching (I've read good things about the Alinco DM-330 but I haven't tested it personally since I'm more into heavy and clunky transformer+rectifier+capacitors+regulator designs :-)  If you want to buy used check out shops first, they usually test their radios in lab, possibly realign them and provide you with some warranty.  I'd avoid really old radios, such as tube or early solid state. Even though SSB is 1948 technology, there's been some progress in electronics design. Less frequency drift, no more wearing out VFD displays, better integrated tuners... all things that can contribute to a less stressing experience as a newcomer on HF."

HamRadio,38669a,totorodad,7,Tue Jun 2 03:17:23 2015 UTC,I would suspect that by looking at how much of a shit job you did of cutting through the insulation you probably cut through most of the braid as well.   A far better picture would be if you cut a slot along the length of the outer insulation and peeled it back.

HamRadio,38669a,scubasky,1 point,Wed Jun 3 01:38:31 2015 UTC,Back in  the CB days the Radio Shack RG-58 was almost that bad. At one time I think it had about 15 strands of copper for the shield.
HamRadio,38669a,WB5QWN,1 point,Sat Jun 13 23:48:49 2015 UTC,"I'll chime in here. Coax specs are determined by center conductor diameter, dielectric type/thickness, and shielding percentage. We all know that an antenna radiates horizontally along the length of the conductor. By running the wire along the outside of the dielectric the center conductor is shielded from radiating along its length like 60% shielding would, however the effectiveness severely reduced and can also affect attenuation depending on the construction. It's terrible for shielding from external noise though. This cable is designed for use in OTA TV reception. I do not know the engineering/science behind it, though I probably should since I do this kind of stuff and get paid for it..."

Unless there is a complete break in shielding the element will not radiate because the outer shield is grounded. I work with coax and its properties more in a week than most here might in their lifetime. A single piece of wire, so long as it is properly connected at both ends, is enough to prevent signal egress in coax."

HamRadio,37xtt1,zootboy,2,Sun May 31 17:04:41 2015 UTC,"I think you accidentally a word.  If you're asking about calculating runtime, simply take the amp-hour rating of the battery and divide by the average current draw (which you may have to measure with a miltimeter).   For example, say I have a 5 amp-hour battery. My radio draws 200mA in standby (0.2A), so 5 / 0.2 = 25 hours. I take 80% of that for a safety margin, so I assume I have 20 hours of standby time.  Now let's say I want to include active time as well. I've measured my radio, and it consumes 1A while transmitting / receiving. So now I assume I'm transmitting / receiving for 10 minutes every hour, so I make an average: (1A * 10 min + 0.2A * 50 min) / 60 min = 0.33A. Redoing my calculation with my 5Ah battery, 5Ah / 0.33A * 80% = ~12 hours."
