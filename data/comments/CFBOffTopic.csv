CFBOffTopic,3e3zce,brobroma,8,Tue Jul 21 21:13:52 2015 UTC,"Because there's 16 other candidates that split the ""Fuck Trump"" part of the GOP. At the start of his campaign, he had a very high unfavorability rating, even amongst Republicans. That number has been going down since, though. However, the thing is that the minority who likes Trump is VERY supportive of him and are more likely to vote for him...but the other crowd is equally hateful of him. If the field were narrowed down to two candidates, Trump and ______, then I'd put money on the other person for most of the remaining GOP candidates. Trump will stay strong for a while and probably peter out as his media coverage dwindles. I wouldn't be surprised if he wins the first few primaries but then starts to dawdle.   Reminder that at this point in the 2012 cycle, Michelle Bachmann was leading the polls as the Republican favorite!"

CFBOffTopic,3e3zce,dubsdcarson,2,Tue Jul 21 22:04:33 2015 UTC,"Eh, almost all of the GOP candidates have some measure of electability concern going on.

CFBOffTopic,3e3zce,carpy22,5,Tue Jul 21 22:47:26 2015 UTC,"Some interesting discussions going on about this. Part of what is going on is also how you define a ""real"" candidate. The Washington Post has an interesting piece up that starts to ask why some people get to be ""real"" candidates and others don't and where we draw that line.   Whether you look at more mainstream candidates/""real"" candidates or all candidates, this is looking like a record year.   Republicans, as /u/vanished34 notes, are at 16 for main candidates (Bush, Carson, Christie, Cruz, Fiorina, Graham, Huckabee, Jindal, Kasich, Pataki, Paul, Perry, Rubio, Santorum, Trump, and Walker), plus 2 more potentials (Gilmore - he said he'll announce in August - and Ehrlich).   Democrats are at 5 (Chafee, Clinton, O'Malley, Sanders, and Webb).    But if you grab data from the FEC, things are even more absurd. As of today, you've got 124 Republicans, 83 Democrats, and 305 other candidates running (or who have filed officially with the FEC so far, some people may start their campaigns before doing so - see Trump)."
CFBOffTopic,3e3zce,StrawberryTea,3,Wed Jul 22 00:54:07 2015 UTC,"The sheer number of candidates is joyfully absurd. But, that article got me thinking about defining 'real' candidates. Even with the 'fringier' segment possibly represented on Wikipedia, not all of them are. Who really gets to say which candidate is worthy or not?"
CFBOffTopic,3e3zce,vanished34,2,Wed Jul 22 02:10:50 2015 UTC,"Yep, a fascinating question, I think. And there is this weird cascading effect going on. Wikipedia, as /u/vanished34 noted, makes it clear that they use the 5+ major poll rule, but what are the polls using? And the polls will decide who goes on the stage, at least according to what I've heard about the Fox debates for the Republican party.   I mean, you could also make the argument that media coverage affects the polls themselves, so that plays a role."
CFBOffTopic,3e3zce,StrawberryTea,2,Wed Jul 22 02:36:47 2015 UTC,"We're not doing a very good job with representative democracy. Arguably, we never have.   The fox debates are going to be a shitshow. I, for one, cannot wait."

To the Wikipedia community's credit, it is made fairly clear how they are determining which candidates to list on that page (""The following candidates have been listed in five or more major independent nationwide polls""), but that doesn't mean the line's not blurry.

I just want to see how many we end up with in the end   I am as well. The Washington Post article is from July 2. Then, as per the article, there were 104 Republicans, 73 Democrats, and 266 other (a total of 443). So we've gained 69 heh candidates in 19 days (20 Republicans, 10 Democrats, and 39 other). If we continue at this rate of ~3.6 new candidates per day, we'll gain 57.6 candidates (16.8 Republicans) by the August 6 Republican debate (the first, as far as I'm aware). After that I imagine we'll see some dropping off."

CFBOffTopic,3e4ptl,lady1876,2,Wed Jul 22 01:48:10 2015 UTC,"My mom has a green thumb, but at the same time is the most half-assed gardener you've ever met. I'd stick with what your grandmother does and do food over flowers."
CFBOffTopic,3e4ptl,Alphamazing,2,Wed Jul 22 01:54:58 2015 UTC,My grandma does both food and flowers. I mean seriously she can look at a plant at it will flower....  I tried my hand when I first moved into my house but I was working nights and sleeping days so trying to water in the middle of the day didn't work. Until I stop working 60+ hours I think I'm just going to stick to mooching off my grandma and learning her secrets.

CFBOffTopic,3e4ptl,Alphamazing,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:02:48 2015 UTC,I have an orchid that boyfriend gave me for Valentine's Day that I'm surprisingly keeping alive.
CFBOffTopic,3e4ptl,lady1876,2,Wed Jul 22 02:08:02 2015 UTC,Gardening is great!  It is peaceful and soothing. It's also so cool to watch life grow out from your soil.
CFBOffTopic,3e4ptl,forshiggles,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:23:39 2015 UTC,Agreed I've been around gardening my whole life. I've just never had a successful go at it.   But I better learn since my boyfriend wants us to live on a farm. Haha

When your dirt is black and starts smelling like clean earth, then you can grow anything. That's proper soil for your farm! I have faith in your future green thumb. By the way, my SO and I talk about having a farm all the time. Since neither of us are early risers, we're gonna need a lot of WWOOFers."

There's evidence to suggest Florida was settled nearly 10k years before this by people from what is now France. Also evidence suggests people from Samoa settled Oregon around that same time. It's mentioned in that article but the interviewee dismisses it outright.

We found out that the transplant was supposed to be happening from my aunt (my dad's and uncle's sister, not my uncle's wife) via text message late last night, and my parents drove down to be there when the surgery was supposed to happen this morning. He's still at the top of the transplant list.  I honestly don't know how to feel about all of this (except to wish we had heard sooner, but we never hear from him unless he needs something), since my uncle has been a raging dick to the point that it's not excused by his psychological issues every single time I have seen him since I've been older than about 5.

It's like Waffle House meets a cafeteria.  It's well-organized chaos and the breakfast burrito (which I think is available all day) is great.  It's not super gourmet, so you may find better options, but I loved it.  The food is only part of the meal there.  For hiking there are TONS of options.  You can do nature walks down by the Rio Grande, hike up the Sandias a bit, or go out to the petroglyphs (~600 year old pictures carved into stone).  River would be easiest walk."

I don't have traction control, but I have really nice tires and don't swap them for drag slicks. And I don't have ungodly amounts of torque, so it's not like a split second ""oh god, hello wall"".

Anyway, they totally overreached and fucked themselves over and stopped paying everyone they hired.

I never actually knew why and I just kind of went with it. I went to her funeral last Thursday. I'm not too devastated about it, she had a full life and passed quickly, etc. etc., but that's not why I'm typing this up. My parents explained to me that, when she was 8, she was involved in a terrible car wreck that left her and her dad injured and killed her uncle. We went through her things, and she had kept her uncle's wedding ring. She wanted to give it to one of us grandkids, but she didn't specify who. We think that she wanted to give it to me at my (eventual) wedding, seeing as I'm the only unmarried grandchild, but she died before that could happen. So now I have a wedding ring and a new family tradition that I can eventually pass on to my son or grandson.

CFBOffTopic,3e18ch,JeSuisAmiralAckbar,3,Tue Jul 21 05:30:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah I'm really surprised he couldn't foresee the invention of internet porn. I mean, the signs had been there for decades by the time he wrote the essay. We'll do anything for a cheap off and the fact that Weber couldn't visualize that is pretty shortsighted of him.  That said, I think he does make good points for that time period, but even then it doesn't really hold up. At that time you have political machines in America which revolved around money and following orders over determination and charisma. I think Weber was just a bit out of the loop on the evolving political climate."

CFBOffTopic,3e0c20,EastPowdermilk,8,Tue Jul 21 00:06:57 2015 UTC,I was introduced to twitch a few months ago and it still blows my mind that people just give donation after donation.

I know Reynad, one of the most popular Hearthstone streamers, made $72,000 in a 6 or so month period. I've never donated or subbed, personally, but I do think it's a cool setup. People can be entertainers, and the viewers that have the financial wherewithal can choose to tip them. Viewers that can't can be entertained for free."

CFBOffTopic,3e0c20,MX956,3,Tue Jul 21 02:20:37 2015 UTC,"Arumba and Quill are two of the best youtubers for CKII and EUIV. Arumba has a really good tutorial series for CKII, and Quill did a good tutorial for EUIV. Both have lots of EUIV runs on their channels with lots of good stuff.  DDRJake is the king of EUIV, but most of his stuff is extremely mechanics-heavy, so it may be overwhelming if you aren't familiar with some of the intricacies. He actually got so good at exploiting the mechanics of the game that Paradox hired him to work on the game."

CFBOffTopic,3dzw5e,JeSuisAmiralAckbar,4,Mon Jul 20 22:20:37 2015 UTC,"I certainly wouldn't eat off it, but it's (typically) not pressure treated like outdoor wood, such as fencing. As far as something hanging on your wall though, not going to cause problems. For fencing we process it by using a sanding wheel to knock all the age and buildup off to get to the hard clean wood underneath. Typically get a really nice grain pattern and consistent color."

I have a feeling being a total outsider plus a grad student will shelter me from the silliness.   I also haven't determined if there's a hate dynamic between the individual UC schools themselves. Like, am I supposed to actively root against Cal and UCLA in football, or do I cheer them on supporting a fellow UC school? These things need determining before the season starts!  I'm on a waitlist for grad student housing on campus. There's apparently a pretty bad backlog, so most folks have to wait a month or so. La Jolla seems great, and the cheap housing will be nice."

For the first question, answer with the format present-past-future.  Start by saying who you are and what brought you here, then talk about your background and how it's relevant, then talk about your future goals.  While the question is about you, talk about yourself in a way that shows the value you can bring to the company.    Answering the second question involves understanding the company's values and the direction the industry is headed.  Every company has a page on their website where they pay lip service to how they are doing their part to make the world a better place.  Do some research and find out what big projects are coming down the pipe for this company and mention them if you can.    You've already prepared questions, so you're ready on that front.    As other people have mentioned, meeting the recruiter is the easy part, so be professional and impress them and they will help you sell yourself to the employer.  Good luck :)"

CFBOffTopic,3dxj94,Alphamazing,8,Mon Jul 20 14:15:48 2015 UTC,"I did some golf stuff with /u/lAltroUomo last week, and made by far the best shot I've ever made. Also, nothing but luck. 183 yard par 3, downhill over a creek with a slight crosswind from the right, dropped and rolled to within 8-10 inches of the pin. The previous hole I launched two off immediately into the woods off the tee. Golf is a dumb game.  Headed down to San Antonio to spend some time with the girlfriend, and had a hectic but fantastic time. We taught her brother some basic knife and cooking skills while doing a make-your-own-taco night on Friday. He's normally the type of person who eats nothing but ramen, doritos, Mt. Dew, and fast food (I think he's very fond of Taco Bell), so we jumped on the opportunity to let him cook with us when he expressed interest in learning basic prep skills. With a little instruction he chopped garlic, seeded and diced jalapenos and bell peppers, diced a tomato, chopped an onion, and browned up some beef for us. We were proud! Just expressing interest in that whatsoever is a big step for him, I think.  On Saturday, she hosted (I sorta helped) a puppy birthday party at the local dog park and we had about 10 dogs show up with their parents. She made a birthday cake for the pups, we put lots of dogs in hats, and I picked up every dog I could, including the 95 lb rhodesian ridgeback and this 70 some odd pound doofus.   A quick change of clothes and we headed to a human birthday party out at Top Golf, where my 7 iron decided to give up on life and behead itself. I hate hitting of mats. Now even more so. I eventually did get the head back, so I'll reshaft the thing and all will be well.  While my girlfriend went to a bachelorette party for her future sister-in-law, where she had to come to terms with every conversation about sex with the bride to be was referring to her brother, I played it safe and went to see Ant Man on my own.   Sunday was a very hot day. We were stupid and went mountain biking at a place which we learned (about half way through) is not particularly friendly for mountain biking. I'm an experienced rider, but this whole place was nothing but a rock garden. It was excruciating, some parts entirely unrideable, especially for a less experienced rider like my girlfriend. We had to hike a pretty solid chunk of the 7-8 miles we were out there, since it was just way too technical for her. With the heat and not bringing water for such an extended trip out (8 miles is usually no big deal, but in this terrain...) it was pretty unpleasant. Seriously, the heat was brutal. I'm a little more drought tolerant than her, so I was able to suffice those hours   After finally getting back to the truck and rehydrating, we got cleaned up and headed out to the Alamo Drafthouse to watch a screening and quote-a-long of Airplane! I've seen this movie more than a few times, and this was by far the best experience. There's just something about watching it in a theater with everyone laughing around you as opposed to at home."

Basically, the chain went like this:  Manufacturing contact: Can engineering finish certain work by this date that's much earlier than the originally planned date and is ridiculously aggressive? Me: After moving things around drastically, our hours/schedule generator is saying we'll be able to hit a week after that. Manufacturing contact: Just for our information, we thought these parts were done before, why is it going to take extra time? Me: (after discussing with manager if we should even say this in an email) off the record, we should be able to make that date. However, the way the generator works we have to work through XXX amount of hours before hitting that point. Come project time, I suspect we can work around the schedule and make it happen, we just can't guarantee that at this time. Manufacturing contact: <no response, forward email to manager> Manufacturing manager: <forward to uninvolved manager> here is an example of an issue we have in <my department>'s methods that I'm going to complain about, even though I have no idea how they do their engineering. It's slowing down my schedule, fix this.  And then the uninvolved manager copied me in her lengthy response.   Am I wrong in being mildly annoyed by this?  Also, how be everyone else this morning?"
CFBOffTopic,3dxj94,ou77-am0,4,Mon Jul 20 13:03:27 2015 UTC,You should forward the response to some other uninvolved manager and just see how many random people you can pull in.
CFBOffTopic,3dxj94,aMiracleAtJordanHare,3,Mon Jul 20 13:36:26 2015 UTC,"Well, having dug into it a little more, apparently this is the manager in charge of the way the scheduling calculator is derived. So they are technically involved, if only slightly.  Just kind of annoying to me."

Of course, this all depends on your ability to live without that week or two's worth of pay.  Either way, I feel your pain and I know it sucks to be in that position. Right after college I had a job and they screwed me over and backed out of some promises they made after I switched work locations and took on more responsibility and a tougher job. They had promised me a raise and a promotion and then suddenly took both away. I ended up looking for a different job and when I gave job A my two weeks notice, they fired me on the spot. It really sucked because I was living pay check to pay check and taking care of my disabled mother.   It all worked out in the end though and I was better off getting away from that company but it sucked to go through at the time."

Good that you didn't actually throw someone up against a wall, but creepily aggressive that that's your first thought when someone does something you don't like.

CFBOffTopic,3dw0wc,atllauren,6,Mon Jul 20 01:51:14 2015 UTC,"Here's the Urban Dictionary definition of parachute kids :      (PAIR.uh.shoot kidz) n. Children sent to a new country to live alone or with a caregiver while their parents remain in their home country.     Craig, a high school senior, lives a fantasy most teen-agers only dream. He and his sister Zoe, 14, live in a sprawling San Marino ranch house, their one chaperon an elderly servant who speaks no English...Craig and Zoe are examples of a phenomenon so familiar in the Chinese community that there is a nickname for it: ""parachute kids"" — dropped off to live in the United States while their wealthy parents remain in Asia.  The parents, mostly from Taiwan, want their children in more open, less cutthroat U.S. school systems, in which the chances of getting into college are much greater.  Parents may place their children with distant relatives or paid caretakers, or simply buy a house for them and have them stay alone. Under these scenarios, the youngsters often live much as adults would, deciding when to go to sleep or attend school and whether dinner will consist of leafy greens or potato chips.    about | flag for glitch | Summon: urbanbot, what is something?"

And then I got senior enough to get one of the real fancy grad student offices, where I only had to share it with 2 other grad students and could close the door.  But at night I could sleep in those because no one else was around.  If you lived out of your lab, it would allow you to avoid your roommate!"

CFBOffTopic,3dt222,mriforgot,2,Sun Jul 19 12:27:40 2015 UTC,"I'm guessing that my frustrations with python right now have to do with the lack of type safety when I'm dealing with code that other people have written.

CFBOffTopic,3dt222,AnEmptyKarst,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:33:13 2015 UTC,"What is the difference between all of those, to someone with literally no programming experience?"
CFBOffTopic,3dt222,TheCid,2,Sun Jul 19 05:52:51 2015 UTC,"Java has a tendency to be very verbose and full of boilerplate, though that's not really a property of the language so much as it is the frameworks people build with it. Python code tends to be more straightforward. Everything in Java has to be in a class, whereas Python can function as if it was a script. If you write a script in Java you have to write a definition for the class you don't even intend to instantiate:  // Java public class UselessThing { // Define a class you don't care about     public static void main(String[] args) { // Define the main function         System.out.println(""Hello world!"");     } }   # Python - the main function is implicit upon entry into the script print ""Hello world!""   Every function specifies what ""type"" of argument it takes. Python has a tendency to just say ""meh, fuck it, let's see if this works"" and can result in you getting back nonsense, or a program that crashes midway through.  // java int double(int x) {     return x * 2 }   # python def double(x):     return x * 2   Java's version will not let you pass it 2.0 (that's a floating point number, not an integer), ""two"" (a text string), or anything which is not an int (or Integer, but let's not get into autoboxing, it's stupid). It will in fact refuse to even compile the program, telling you this is an illegal argument to pass to the function. Python's version will let all of those things happen, and the output will be based on what you gave it. Let's explore that in some detail.  double(2) # returns 4, as you'd expect double(2.0) # returns 4.0, as you'd expect double(""two"") # returns ""twotwo"" which you probably didn't expect double(someObject) # some sort of error when you run the program - but it's still considered a legal program!   As you can see, Python makes it easier to just throw stuff at it and make it work - the results of it simply may not be what you want. Thus, people who typically only work on small projects by themselves love Python, since it's generally less work. People who work on large teams full of Other Peoples' Code tend to prefer to write Java, since it clearly outlines how stuff is supposed to work. Oh, they'll bitch and moan about the boilerplate and deride the unnecessary layers of abstraction involved (fucking Factories everywhere, seriously), but in general APIs tend to be more cleanly defined in Java as a result. Until you get that one fuckwit who uses strings instead of enums and throws the type checker out the window."
CFBOffTopic,3dt222,AnEmptyKarst,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:38:36 2015 UTC,"Uhhhhh thanks, still don't undetsta much though. So each language is just a different way of writing the same thing, with minor differences?"
CFBOffTopic,3dt222,TheCid,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:54:31 2015 UTC,"It's an actual theorem in computer science that every programming language which is sufficiently advanced is capable of doing all the same things that another language which meets that criteria can do. This is called being Turing-complete, and it's unnecessarily abstract and academic and we don't really need to get into that for this discussion - Brainfuck qualifies and nobody's going around writing code that looks like that except as a joke or to prove a point. (One of our assignments at school was to write a Brainfuck interpreter, with its name bowdlerized as ""Mindwarp"". That is, we had to write a program that could run a Brainfuck program.)  Anyway, most languages since the '80s have all adopted many of the same basic concepts:   flow control - your if/then/else statements, for/while loops, etc function definitions - define code that can be reused rather than having to write it over and over again. That's what I did with double() up there. This is obviously too trivial a function to bother with in the real world, I just did it to demonstrate how the languages treat their arguments differently. some degree of ""object oriented"" programming - a Class is a defined structure for storing related data and functions together, so that you can make instances of it (called Objects). Usually, it's possible to have a Class inherit from a ""parent"" class and add on additional properties. This is done so that functions can take in arguments from multiple classes and treat them the same (as if they were the parent class). Look at my Java example earlier and imagine that instead of integer and float being special standalone types, they instead inherited from a Number type - then you could define double(Number x) and it'd work for both integers and floating point numbers, but still reject strings. (This is how Smalltalk does it, and how Java handles literally everything else. Java's treatment of a handful of special numeric types drives me up a wall with its inconsistency. Fuck that.)   So in a sense, trivial programs like ""Double a number"" will look quite similar in many modern languages, but the nature of the languages mean that larger programs will be considerably different in form. Python requires a lot more testing to be as confident in the code as Java, because of the fact that you don't have a compiler catching type errors for you. Java programs will require a lot more effort if you have to define a class or function that can handle multiple types of objects which aren't part of a related class hierarchy (this situation is referred to as ""Generics"" in Java) so it's a lot more tedious and usually requires people look up the exact syntax."

The subreddit about it is pretty active and one of the key researchers in the case posts occasionally over there.   I think it's fun to read about because its a lot more tame than some of these stories. It's not like reading about some missing girl who may or may not have been murdered or something terrible like that.

My radio is tuned to the old-school rap station, which was jamming Biggie at the time. Neither here nor there, but we were stopped at three lights together. Relatively side by side. At the third and what happened to be the last light, I finally just get fucking tired of it, and crank my shitty Honda stock radio all the way up-- reason being, if I'm going to get a headache from anyone's music, it's gonna be my shit.   He notices as he passes me up (he's going straight while I take a left) and that's when I get the bird.  Was it justifiable?   My coworker laughed and said yes, I indeed deserved the finger.
