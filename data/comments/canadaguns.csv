Whether or not you'll actually be charged will depend on if you draw attention to it at all, which is probably what the person at the CFP you were talking to was getting at.

canadaguns,3e31w7,BigBadSpice,6,Tue Jul 21 16:03:28 2015 UTC,That's a great first gun. You're also going to want an extra mag or 2. If you get the Buttler Creek 25 rounders get the steel lip ones.  You can print your own targets at home or buy some. Don't forget a cleaning rod and/or bore snake with some cleaning supplies too.
canadaguns,3e31w7,thelawnranger,5,Tue Jul 21 16:15:17 2015 UTC,"Cleaning rod, imo, is not optional. You should always have one because it's useful for checking for obstructions, and pushing them out. You can't clear a squib with a bore snake."
canadaguns,3e31w7,mrchenry,0,Tue Jul 21 16:42:39 2015 UTC,"Sure you can. Just shove the bore snake in as hard as you can, and find some sticks from the outdoor range and shove everything down the barrel real hard. If that doesn't free the obstruction, then just leave everything in there and fire another round. The increased pressure makes everything pop right out of there."

Do some of your own research, but I've found that Ballistol, bore snakes, and some old toothbrushes to get in the tight spots are all I've ever needed for cleaning. Get into the habit of cleaning after every range visit and you'll make it easy on yourself and prolong the life of your equipment."
canadaguns,3e31w7,mrchenry,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:30:22 2015 UTC,Cleaning too much can be detrimental. You don't need to run a bore brush every time unless it's corrosive ammo. Too much brushing can be bad for the bore.

A low power scope or red dot is a nice thing on the 10/22. Also a cleaning kit is a must.  You should also get a range bag to keep the following things in (they live permanently in the range bag, this way you don't forget them)   Ear protection Eye protection Allen wrench set Philips and flat head screw driver Knife Stapler & staples   Once you've shot it a few times and kinda know a little bit about how it works here's some good upgrades for the 10/22:   Auto bolt release (you can do this yourself with a file) Trigger (I have this) Stock (ATI sucks, don't get one) Heavy barrel (look up Dlask)"

Dlask has spring kits and different bolt handles and mag releases if you feel thats something you want down the road. Infact the whole 10/22 is able to be replaced as you customize it so dont worry about that all till you get to know it well enough stock.

canadaguns,3e0ppb,Cheese_Bits,8,Tue Jul 21 14:24:36 2015 UTC,"What firearms are a really good demonstration of is what happens when you lack property rights. At a whim a government body can decree all guns are evil, and must be turned into destruction, and we would be out of thousands of dollars of valuable property, many items which would increase in value over time.   The firearm issue shouldn't be approached with the hand of ""I have the right to bear arms to keep government in check, or as a civilian body to defend the sovereignty of the country"" as that isn't relatable to many Canadians who have never known hardship or tyranny. It should be approached with the hand of ""This is real property of real value, many items which are historically relevant now, and into the future, and are used not only for sport, but as a material investment that we use to pass value on to the future, and to our future generations. The loss of the value that many Canadians have suffered, in some cases the hundreds of thousands of dollars from Government prohibitions, is an example of what could happen to you if you don't help us get property rights encoded for all Canadians"""
canadaguns,3e0ppb,FalcodeDati,4,Tue Jul 21 15:12:14 2015 UTC,"You're nfa you should know that this has already been addressed. It is long dead, literally one of the first supreme court case on the subject after the laws were changed.  By Alberta no less.  There is no way in the world you can work up a more successful case than an entire province could muster.  It has already been decided that firearms are set apart from our meger property rights in and of themselves.  http://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/1794/index.do  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_Re_Firearms_Act"
canadaguns,3e0ppb,Cheese_Bits,5,Tue Jul 21 15:27:44 2015 UTC,"Yup, I do and I am familiar with the challenge by Alberta. But one decision and set back at a time when the world was dead set against us doesn't mean we stop fighting for it now. Through legislation or a major successful shift in public opinion followed by another court challenge with a more friendly court the way things are now could change. Policy and politics is always fluid and ever evolving. What hurts us is thinking it will be one major victory that will fix all our problems. With the past court decisions and legislation that has been passed we have to be in it for the long game."
canadaguns,3e0ppb,FalcodeDati,3,Tue Jul 21 15:43:04 2015 UTC,"It was 2000, not 1993. Wasnt that long ago and it wasn't exactly a different political climate.   Policy and politics is always fluid and ever evolving.    Not in this case. You will never wrestle firearms out of the control of the government as it is controlled not as property but as a public safety issue.  You will never argue personal property over group security when there are 2 and a half decades of proof that it works and improves public safety.  If you're going to ignore reality and waste donated dollars on a pointless and fruitless rehashing of a decided appeal then I must say you're harming our position by making us all look foolish and legally uniformed."

canadaguns,3dywbz,Styrak,3,Mon Jul 20 17:55:49 2015 UTC,"Should be the same as most any other gas system I would think, looks like a basic gas piston design.  Hole in the barrel redirects gasses to the piston."
canadaguns,3dywbz,hakb404,2,Mon Jul 20 18:00:47 2015 UTC,"Looks like, but I want to see if the mag tube is modified in any way. Is it blocked off from the receiver to not allow shells in, or is it a regular 870 with a different barrel and the piston system attached to the barrel ring?"
canadaguns,3dywbz,hakb404,2,Mon Jul 20 18:03:01 2015 UTC,"I wonder if they seal the end of where you load the shells, and have a o ring of some sort on the thread part near the top to prevent gas leaving."
canadaguns,3dywbz,alkali_feldspar,2,Mon Jul 20 18:12:50 2015 UTC,"Me to, i want to see if i can make one of these with a sks gas tube, prob not but who knows."
canadaguns,3dywbz,hakb404,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:11:42 2015 UTC,"You mean retrofit an sks gas tube onto a shotgun, or make a recoil reducer on an sks? The first is possible, but I'm not sure why you'd use a gas tube from an SKS, with the amount of work required you could just make a better one from scratch. The second is also possible,  I guess. If you made the piston heavier to the point where it just cycles the gun you would probably have some reduction in felt recoil."
canadaguns,3dywbz,alkali_feldspar,2,Mon Jul 20 19:34:39 2015 UTC,"Sorry, i was very vague. I want to use the piston from gas tube of the sks inside the tube, but looking at it, its much to small."
canadaguns,3dywbz,hakb404,2,Mon Jul 20 19:49:23 2015 UTC,"Ahh, ok. Well, what you need to do is get a simple cylinder of aluminium to act as a piston in the magazine tube. Then have a gas port cut into the barrel and a gas block to direct it into the magazine tube (the mounting block for the barrel would probably work). Then you need a vent hole cut into the magazine tube near the end of the reciprocation of the piston. Adjusting the mass of the piston would adjust the recoil, and there would be a magic weight which would be most effective."

canadaguns,3dzi6f,CheeseNBacon2,11,Mon Jul 20 20:09:47 2015 UTC,"My time with Canadian Tire came to an end this Saturday after less than two weeks at the job. They moved me from the Sports section, which I applied for because I know bikes and camping and guns, to the Hardware section that I have no familiarity with.   I tried to work in Hardware for a day and a half but was so unhappy my supervisor took me aside and let me know that I didn't have to stay if I didn't want to. Went home and talked it over with my gf and then my mother over the phone, and came in on Saturday and told the super that if I wasn't in Sports I wasn't working anymore. He talked it over with the owner and they let me know that it would be Hardware or no more job. So that was the end of that.  Or...so I thought. I talked with a few ex-coworkers after the meeting when I was shopping for some stuff, and they told me that it was a common practice to move staff to difficult and unfamiliar departments when management wanted them to quit instead of outright firing them. I was told just a few days before that I was doing wonderfully, so why get rid of a good and new employee that was working his ass off this way?  It really sucks because while that job was way harder than anything I've done in the last 10 years, the pay was garbage, the hours sucked, and it was a half an hour commute a day, I was looking forward to building a relationship with the company and move to the gun counter if/when I was needed or a position made available. Hunting season is just around the corner, and the two staff members who work at the gun counter currently are just going to be getting busier and busier. None of the other non-gun counter staff in the entire store know anything about guns to the level I did, and I was more than happy to be in a non-ideal situation for a few months as long as the gun counter awaited me at the end of the path.   So I am back to square one, in Victoria, no job, and a closet full of guns. But at least I have my lovely girlfriend, and a brand new Stack-On 10-gun cabinet bought before I quit.

canadaguns,3dzi6f,Dontellmywife,5,Mon Jul 20 20:34:22 2015 UTC,"Traveled over to Victoria for the weekend for the two day IPSC Match out at Victoria Fish and Game.  The event was easily one of the more enjoyable set of stages I have done. The level of difficulty was high enough that even the highest level of shooter at the event was missing targets. What I realized the case was that everyone trains to shoot at targets from roughly 7 - 10 meters, with the occasional target at 15 meters and beyond. What happened here is that all the targets were 15 meters and beyond, so there was nothing close to give perspective to the distance and force a slow down of our speed. The end result is that everyone blows through a stage as they normally would, but with a significant decrease in accuracy. The other factor is the heavy use of angles to trick the mind into seeing the same target multiple times, or not at all.  The second day everyone had caught on to this, and you could tell we had all slowed down, and match scores were back up. I shot extremely well, but a blown course where I executed all the hostages held my overall score down.  And of course a weekend full of IPSC wouldn't be complete without shooting alongside the coolest mom ever.

canadaguns,3dzi6f,FalcodeDati,5,Mon Jul 20 21:07:07 2015 UTC,"I shot the double IPSC qualifier at Victoria Fish and Game which is a very good range with lots of room to grow. It was their first IPSC event for 10 years and the organizers put a lot of work together to make sure it went off relatively smoothly.   As /u/FalcodeDati pointed out, it was a challenging event. The first day I totally sucked. I'm currently a C shooter and a performance like that first day would pull me back down to D. I was missing targets and totally forgetting other ones. The stages were well designed to punish anyone who hadn't worked out their plan and executed it.  The second day the organizers made some adjustments and so did all of the shooters. As a result, everyone shot much better and I was up to my previous standard with only a couple hiccups but nowhere near as disastrous as previous.   Had a great bbq Saturday night with /u/FalcodeDati , his mom and another member of our IPSC club and everyone was all smiles after the end of the event.   Here's a couple vids showing the difference between day 1 and day 2 on the same stage.   Stage 1 / July 18th  Stage 1 / July 19th"

Including handguns. Which I am now convinced I need to own. I finally shot a 92FS. Fit my hand perfectly. All my winter days in my basement shooting air pistols has paid off... All the shooters were impressed with my shooting handguns for the first time.

I went to Silverdale's big Make-a-Wish bash, got to shoot a watermelon with a Tavor, shot my first few rounds of trap ever which incidentally was the first time using my new shotgun.  It worked great and I impressed myself with 19/25 clays hit.  I even won a shooting vest from the prize bench.  It's a medium and doesn't quite fit but whatever.  Then on Sunday I took the mom and pop to the range.  My mom's first time ever at a range.  She had fun and thought it was interesting.  She was initally not a fan of me getting into guns but ever since seeing a Rick Mercer episode where he shot trap she's warmed up to the idea.  We even got her to fire a shot outta the .22 (gotta start small).  Dad used to be in the service so he's plenty familiar with guns.    So all in alla  good weekend!"

canadaguns,3dyusl,CheeseNBacon2,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:41:10 2015 UTC,"nope, it's legal.  Originally there wasn't any non-armour piercing ammo being made (or so is my understanding.  basically it was legal just the ammo wasn;t so no one was bothering importing them), but now there is so it's good to go.  In fact here's where you can buy one https://shopquestar.com/shopping65/shopdisplayproducts.asp?id=282&cat=FN+Semi-Auto+Carbines.  The US also has bans on AP ammo, but they can have FiveseveNs and PS90s, and the FiveseveN is becoming quite popular down there recently.  I'm really hoping that will increase the availability of the ammo."

canadaguns,3dvlgl,thelawnranger,17,Sun Jul 19 22:08:25 2015 UTC,Yay! Paint jobs for everyone!!
canadaguns,3dvlgl,The_Crover,4,Sun Jul 19 22:40:59 2015 UTC,"Since your the painting shit expert.   I picked up an early 1900s Model 94 in great working condition, but someone really cunted up a refinish job on the stock, and used what looks like tremclad on the metal. The wood i'm not worried about as I know an ace refinisher but what to do with the metal? Would the paint you use look ok or should I pony up and have it reblued? I know it's never going to be a collectible I just want it to not look retarded. Would you paint an old levergun ?"
canadaguns,3dvlgl,CreateBread,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:09:45 2015 UTC,"As long as it is vomit-inducing, I'd paint anything.   Part of the process of prepping the surfaces to coat them is to roughen them up with 600 grit sandpaper. This rough texture helps the paint adhere to the surface, and has the added benefit removing imperfections on the surface you are going to paint. So if that poor refinishing is rough, you could scratch it away while prepping for the paint.   Rebluing isn't something I'm familiar with, so research it if you'd rather retain that classic look."
canadaguns,3dvlgl,The_Crover,2,Mon Jul 20 00:57:09 2015 UTC,How much does it cost you to paint a rifle?   Do you just sand everything or use chemical stripper to get everything off? I have no idea how'd I'd sand things like the loading gate or hammer.
canadaguns,3dvlgl,CreateBread,4,Mon Jul 20 01:04:00 2015 UTC,"Full disassembly of the firearm is amust when painting or rebluing. You can't do it with the gun put together.  You can use a chemical stripper, if you are careful and follow safety guidelines. If it says do it outside in a well ventilated area, DO IT OUTSIDE IN A WELL VENTILATED AREA.  Once you've removed the old finish, I would still use sandpaper on all the parts or surfaces you're painting.  Have a read of my copipasta about it:  Lauer sells bottles of Duracoat that do 2 guns, three if you're careful and coat thin but evenly. Should come out to about $30-40, plus the fee to get the crooks from UPS to get it over the border (for Canada).   You can however call UPS once you have a tracking number and ask to not have the package delivered, instead you go to the distribution center and pick it up. The advantages of that are that you don't pay some of the bullshit fees UPS usually charges, and UPS doesn't leave your package on the front porch for any fuckwit to come snatch it. (They've left guns, ammo, and paint on mine, so this is really a must in my eyes).  The supplies to coat your stuff should not be more than $20 at your local Home Depot. Tape, 600 grip sandpaper, brillo pads, brake cleaner or some other light degreaser compound, and a couple of Pre-Val aerosol cans with the additional bottle system. So overall it would be ~$100 max to coat up to 3 guns, more like 2 realistically.   This is what you're going to do:   Disassemble the firearm completely and decide ahead of time what's getting painted. Using 600 grit sandpaper, roughen up the surfaces that are going to get coated. Smooth is not good for paint, so if the finish is parkerized you might not need to roughen it since parkerization is inherently rough. Using a non-chlorinated degreaser like Breakfree or brake cleaners, spray the surfaces that are going to get coated and scrub them with a Brillo pad. Either air dry or use an air compressor. Using masking tape or duct tape or whatever, cover or tape over whatever you don't want to paint. Use gloves, so that you don't leave residue or oil on the parts. Firearms have surprisingly tight parts tolerances, so I usually avoid painting the inside of the stock where the receiver/barrel/mag go, anywhere inside the action, where pins go, where parts fit around others.   You're now ready to paint. I like to hang the parts from my garage door. Wear a mask.  Light coats, maybe two feet away from the parts. Don't worry if the part isn't fully covered, the subsequent coats will get the spots. Try your best to make the coats light, you don't want runs or drips.  Wait a bit between coats, say 5-10 min. Two to three coats for light wear parts, three to four for heavy wear parts or if you want to never worry about it.  Dry time is about an hour for handling the parts. 24 hours for reassembling, and a couple of weeks for curing.  Lauer has a nice YouTube video that shows you what to do. Good luck and don't forget to post and do a write-up with pictures!"

So all the individual components separate do not make up ammunition, therefore making it legal to purchase separately without a license.

I can remember my mother crying as we watched the bodies being rolled out.    The legend goes that the Liberal Party of Canada took an R Nichols or MD Chralton catalog, a sharpie and just flipped pages putting X's on the pictures of guns.    The AK47 is a buzz word gun.  Banning it keyed in to the public's outrage and fear after Polytechnique.  IIRC the AR15 was on the chopping block too, but it got moved to restricted.    The Liberals got elected with gun control a part of their platform.  They used the fear of the nation to their advantage to gain seats and brought in laws that really didn't do anything to protect Canadians from these kinds of events.  Now we have stupid arbitrary laws that make no sense.    With a federal election coming up, and the fear of active shooter attacks in the nation's mind, gun control can be an issue for the voter.  It's something to consider when making your mark on the ballot this October."

canadaguns,3dq2k5,No6655321,14,Sat Jul 18 17:57:48 2015 UTC,Yes but that makes sense because the gun traditionally has a wooden stock so it cannot be used in a massacre. It's only black or assault weapons which can be used in mass killings. - proud liberal

The actual story of how the VZ58 was designed basically boils down to the USSR telling the Czechs to make what amounted to an AK without directly saying ""copy this thing, like every other country behind the iron curtain"" and the Czechs, being mad that they were stuck with the commies, decided to follow the specifications but fuck them up as much as possible by making nothing interchangeable, except the ammo itself. This is why we have a slightly different AK rifle for every former Soviet state, like Poland, Yugoslavia, and China. They weren't nearly as angry, or joined of their own free will, and it was much easier just to copy the AK."

canadaguns,3dq2k5,Rrrrbbbb,2,Sat Jul 18 22:06:22 2015 UTC,"That's literally it. They were built to do the exact same thing, with the exact same round, and the only reason they have different internals is that the Czechs wanted to do everything they could to piss off the Russian without suffering repercussions. There is no ""technical"" reason to ban one but allow the other. If you can convert an AK to full auto you can just build full auto AKs from scratch and convert almost any gun to full auto while you are at it.

(Think G20 police, or riot control cops)  What are you being taught? What's the approach they come from and teach you with?"
canadaguns,3dnrj4,Ashlir,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:45:27 2015 UTC,"The funny thing is. I am not taught the same thing by all the teachers. They all have their own view, their own methods. There are some protocol they all agree on, but even when it is ok to detain someone vs when to arrest is heavily devated among teachers. We actually had a large pool of students complain last semester about a lack of direction in the program, as many of us felt that 5 different teachers would tell you 5 different things.  Some teachers are all about helping the public, and why are you harassing them, what did they do to deserve you treating them like a criminal (the good teachers).. Vs some who show you every way to use the law to your advantage and turn  a simple traffic stop into searching the trunk. (The bad) example: every car in quebec needs a tire jack (dont quote me on this, it could have been a spare tire or something.. I dont recall), so an easy way to see someones trunk is ask where there tirejack is and then verify if it is infact in the trunk.   There is a clear devide between the two teaching methods.. One brings more arrests/info, the other is just a proper way to treat people.."
canadaguns,3dnrj4,thelawnranger,2,Sat Jul 18 14:58:38 2015 UTC,So you guys are taught to make shit up as you go right from the beginning. That seems to be the most consistent thing you are being taught. Better not rock that boat. Especially if you want that power for yourself.

No investigative detention is when they actually have you in detention in some fashion, say in the back of the cop car, cuffs, detained sitting on the curb etc. Gunpont is an active threat situation and if you were actually detained there would be no need for such blatant threats of force.   You should learn the law   Still waiting for you to look up the definition of assault there chief...  Heres a hint its ""the threat of force"".   They received a call about a man with a gun entering a commercial building.   No it was a gun CASE the fact it is cased has been acknowledged by our supreme court as an obvious safety measure as it virtually assures everyone else that while there us indeed a firearm, thay its in a case clearly shows no criminal intent on the part of the owner as there is no concealment. No active shooter caries a plano case into where they wish to commit mass murder. So give you head a shake and quit defending your assailants.

canadaguns,3dpoqo,bristow84,1 point,Sat Jul 18 06:27:46 2015 UTC,This thought crossed my mind. I didn't plan on shooting after dark but I figured it'd be nice to get clarification on that aspect as well.
canadaguns,3dpoqo,redly,1 point,Sat Jul 18 06:34:13 2015 UTC,Is it possible that that is covered under the Game legislation in your province?
canadaguns,3dpoqo,AdiposeFin,0,Sat Jul 18 18:51:52 2015 UTC,"So first off.... ITS TINDER DRY AND YOU""RE SHOOTING IN THE WOODS?!?!?!?!?!?!?!    Do you want a forest fire? Because that's how you GET forest fires.     He didn't seem to be extremely proficient with firearms laws   This is the case with most people, not just police officers. I don't fault anyone, because our firearms laws are so convoluted.  Most people 'think' they know the law, but really don't and are too lazy to actually look it up and read it.     don't have to be 40 metres away from the FSR.   If you read the Region 2 Hunting Synopsis you will see the no shooting areas around Chilliwack lake.  800M from either side of the Chilliwack Lake Road.    Also, Section 31 of the BC Wildlife act talks about shooting 'across a highway.'  So if you read further in to the Wildlife Act you will come in to Closed Area Regulations S.12, which says:   Road allowance no shooting or hunting areas  12  (1) For the purposes of subsections (2) and (3) and of section 31 of the Act, ""highway"" means every public road of two lanes or more that is maintained by the ministry of the minister responsible for the administration of the Transportation Act, and includes all other public roads of two lanes or more within the Province that are operated or maintained by the government of another province or of a territory or by the government of Canada.  (2) For the purpose of subsection (3), ""road allowance"" means the highway and that area on either side of the highway including the shoulder and ditch to the lesser of (a) a distance of 15 m from (i)   the midline of a road of less than three lanes, or (ii)   the nearest edge of the paved surface of a highway with three lanes or more, or (b) the boundary of private property as indicated by (i)   a fence, or (ii)   the limit of cultivated land.  (3) The road allowance of any highway is designated as a no shooting area, and for the purposes of section 26 (1) (c) of the Act there is no open season for any wildlife species in that area.   So there's the law for everyone to read and digest.    In the summer months, the red neck-ish places in South West BC get hit up with RCMP roadblocks.  Sylvester Road, Chilliwack Lake, Squamish Valley, West Harrison are all well know check points.  I have had zero problems with them.  I like that they are out there.  I hate the yahoo's and bozo's that go out in to the woods in the summer.  They leave a mess and More often than not, the people who need a little extra attention from the police get it, and those who know how to fly under the radar go undetected (like me!)  But when you come to these road blocks you never know what kind of officer you're going to get.  You could meet the nicest guy in the department, hunter fisherman who can chit chat and be a good guy.  Or you can get the guy fresh out of training, a chip on his shoulder and a french accent.  The key though is to pass that officers 'is this guy a dick' test.  If you fail that test, you're gonna have a bad time.    When you roll up to these roadblocks, you have all your shit ready.  Driver's license, PAL, hunting license, vehicle registration.  You have your guns in cases and locked up.  You don't have any booze. Your dog is wagging it's tail and you're smiling hello.  ""Hi guys! Thanks for being out here today, I'm going shooting/hunting today.  Here's all my paperwork, how can I help you out?""  It's not the time to take the typical anti-authority attitude I read on here ""Fucking pigs.  Hassling me and my rights. Who the fuck do they think they are, communist fascist assholes.""  You roll up to a roadblock with this attitude, and you're gonna have a bad time.  Every roadblock I've gone through, I take the positive approach and sincerely thank them for being there and keeping the idiots out of the woods.  Never had a problem.  Or you can be a dick, it's up to you."
canadaguns,3dpoqo,Fredarius,6,Sat Jul 18 16:29:33 2015 UTC,You don't need to have your non-restricted firearms locked up in your vehicle when driving. But it does reduce the hassle from police when they stop you.

If you read the Region 2 Hunting Synopsis[1] you will see the no shooting areas around Chilliwack lake. 800M from either side of the Chilliwack Lake Road.

I imagine you would save a few cents a round for 9mm, and a few more cents per round for .223. That being said you'll most certainly be able to reload match grade ammo for bulk grade cost, which is always a plus. I think how it usually works out is the higher the cost of factory ammo, the more you save when reloading.  Worst case ontario you have something to do while bored or watching tv.   Edit: plus you'll gain experience if/when you want to reload other calibres."

canadaguns,3dome5,Genesis38,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:47:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'll be gaining experience and will likely end up with better ammo, but I certainly don't want to end up paying MORE in components than I pay for bulk ammo.

canadaguns,3dome5,Rousis,2,Sat Jul 18 02:54:32 2015 UTC,Exactly! Plus its a life long thing so over time you'll make your money back every cent at a time.
canadaguns,3dome5,Nonrandomhero,3,Sat Jul 18 04:09:09 2015 UTC,"Everyone's definition of ""worth it"" seems to vary. Personally I'm just getting into it, and a large part of the reason is boredom. Worth it for me so I can stop watching crappy TV shows, also I'll be cancelling my cable, so yeah it will save me at least $90 a month even if I don't go shooting!  I'll be reloading 223, 308, 270 win, and hopefully 9mm by the end of the year if I can save up for a cx4 storm by then."
canadaguns,3dome5,TehObviousAnswer,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:02:46 2015 UTC,"Boredom is definitely a factor for me too. Having these ""what should I do now?"" moments made me think more and more about picking reloading as a hobby."

On my .223 trainer I save around 50 cents a round. 9mm? I only save about 7 cents a round but since it's super fast to load 9mm then I actually end up shooting more"
canadaguns,3dome5,TehObviousAnswer,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:37:12 2015 UTC,"That would be more than good enough for me. I think I'll enjoy a bit of reloading, and the saving will be a little extra. Just wanted to make sure I wasn't gonna end up paying more for my ammo, cause that would be a pretty shitty hobby IMO.  Thanks for the numbers btw. Mind telling me your cost for 223 and 9mm instead of your savings?"
canadaguns,3dome5,liesthroughhisteeth,3,Sat Jul 18 03:05:38 2015 UTC,"Ok I'll use current market prices and some reasonable assumptions. I'll break it down and sum it up at the end. Remember, I'm loading match grade bullets and powder, you can save 15-20% using regular components.  Brass=free (you can find hundreds at ranges) but lets say I paid 10cents for once fired brass and I can reload it 5 times so 2 cents a shot.  Powder = a hot load of 26gr of varget (match grade powder) assuming $40/lb and there are 7000grs/lb so about 15 cents a shot.  Bullet = 68gr Hornady bthp (match bullet) runs around $25 for 100  or $114 for 500 so about  25 cents a shot  Primer = Federal or CCI primers run about $35/1000 so about 3.5 cents a shot  So the total cartridge costs me 45.5 cents before any taxes and shipping.  Remember, this is match loaded ammo. I can buy 55gr fmjbt bullets for 11 cents instead of 25 cents and use dominion primers to save 1 cent and a cheaper powder to save another 2-3 cents. Using cheaper components would put me somewhere around the 28 to 30 cent range.  You can also order in bulk to save even further, I never buy any of my components individually anymore."
canadaguns,3dome5,liesthroughhisteeth,2,Sat Jul 18 04:23:08 2015 UTC,"Wow great cost breakdown, thank you very much for this. I think it's safe to say I'm gonna start saving for some reloading gear now."
canadaguns,3dome5,tletang,2,Sat Jul 18 04:26:24 2015 UTC,"No problem, bud. Before you know it, you'll be spending more time working on your loads than shooting...it can be very addicting!"
canadaguns,3dome5,TehObviousAnswer,2,Sat Jul 18 05:20:07 2015 UTC,"The biggest thing I found when I was shooting a lot was the fact I could afford to shoot a lot. I was also shooting 9 mil and casting my own bullets. My costs were ridiculously low and I was able to load very accurate rounds that were not going to beat my gun up too badly after thousands of rounds. When you are able to shoot a few thousand rounds without breaking the bank you find your skill level rises accordingly. This is a big thing for someone shooting say, IPSC as I was."
canadaguns,3dome5,cdnmr,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:14:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah I took a small look at casting my own bullets but that looks like it's a bit much for me right now. Either way I'd start with purchased bullets before giving casting a try.  I wouldn't bee surprised to find myself casting my own bullets a year or two down the road seeing how things went from 1 rifle, to 3 rifles and a handgun, to wanting to reload.... it's a slippery slope isn't it? XD"
canadaguns,3dome5,TehObviousAnswer,2,Sat Jul 18 22:41:56 2015 UTC,"it's a slippery slope isn't it?    Yes, but it's all for the best of reasons. :)  I loved shooting but I also really enjoyed reloading, figuring out different loads, bullet types, seating depths, powder etc etc. I was also able to buy a used electric pot, and a used sizer/luber for decent prices and that helps. Anyhow, good luck."
canadaguns,3dome5,cdnmr,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:46:39 2015 UTC,"Sounds about right, I use the cheapo components because I shoot it out of my AR, I've been using BL-c2 because it meters out of the Lee autodisk powder measure very nicely. Even using more affordable components and an auto disk powder measure I've found my group size shrink considerably compared to factory ammo."
canadaguns,3dome5,zod201,2,Mon Jul 20 17:51:38 2015 UTC,"9mm uses 11 cent bullets, like 2 cents of powder, and a 3 cent primer. The cases are free (range pickup) or about 3 cents if you buy them once fired but you can reload them over 10 times so the cost per shot is fractions of a penny.  Assuming you lost the case every time you fired it, you'd be in the 19 cent cartridge cost."
canadaguns,3dome5,neoconfection,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:26:39 2015 UTC,My buddy is trying to get me into reloading and claims he is reloading 9mm for 10 cents a round and 357 mag at 14 cents a round.  Is this close to the truth or is he full of shit?
canadaguns,3dome5,neoconfection,2,Sat Jul 18 23:37:48 2015 UTC,With jacketed rounds?  Not possible.  With cast lead bullets it's entirely possible. Lead rounds have velocity restrictions because they deform in your barrel at high speed
canadaguns,3dome5,neoconfection,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:23:48 2015 UTC,"OK, thanks...makes sense. Plan on picking up some reloading equipment in the fall to start reloading over the winter, sounds like it'll be worthwhile.  Budget friendly ammo will allow me to pick up some larger caliber rifles without worrying as much abut feeding them."
canadaguns,3dome5,Genesis38,2,Sun Jul 19 14:47:32 2015 UTC,I reload .223 and to me it is worth it. I'm going for precision and have a 1:12 twist bolt gun. 55gr match ammo is hard to find. Most stuff starts at 69gr and goes up to 80gr. If you're looking to make bulk plinking ammo it may not be worth the extra time. I don't bother with 9mm as I'm only really plinking. Easier to pick up a box or case and head out to the range.
canadaguns,3dome5,Quantis_Ottawa,2,Sat Jul 18 01:38:11 2015 UTC,"It will be cheaper eventually once you've loaded enough to offset the startup cost, and the ammo quality will be much, much higher. A competent reloader will make match-quality ammo. Also, my 5.56 handloads are about $0.35-40 a round, which is way cheaper than your $0.60.   However, if you hate reloading (it can be very tedious) and you are just looking for ammo that goes bang, the cost saving of loading 9mm is maybe not a sufficient offset from the other considerations."
canadaguns,3dome5,didnt_I,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:20:19 2015 UTC,"Thanks, 0.35-0.40 would be good enough for me to get to reloading, plus I'm thinking about it first because reloading looks like something I'd enjoy when I have nothing to do.  Not to mention the stuff I shoot ain't exactly top-notch so I wouldn't be against getting some great ammo for cheaper."
canadaguns,3dome5,Noorviko,2,Sat Jul 18 03:57:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah, man. When people do the math they sometimes say, ""Well I can get the Norinco stuff for $0.35 a round so why bother?"" and that is not a fair comparison. You need to peg your price calculation at hand loads vs mid-level ammo to match, depending on your skill."
canadaguns,3dome5,Noorviko,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:05:19 2015 UTC,"Depends on the people I suppose. If someone is perfectly satisfied with Norinco ammo then reloading pretty much is a waste of time I suppose.  Only shot a bit of it but I've had people tell me that like only ~25% of their brass is reloadable because of how off-center the flash holes are. Goes bang, but you get what you pay for!"

Perfect for the bullseye league in my area and great for learning to shoot. I was set on the Buckmark but this opportunity was too good.   Oh and I went into my LGS and they were just stocking the 22 back in as I got in (was half hour after opening). Got a brick of CCI standard velocity for non price gouge prices and they had a metric fuck ton.

Even had an old dude with an office to the side and white gloves to appraise stuff people were bringing in off the streets.  Took a while to get over all these people walking around the store with what we consider restricted & prohibited items.  Plus the regular counter was about 100m long and people were browsing and waving around handguns like it was nothing.  Meanwhile boxes of ammo were just steps behind them.  It was surreal, and a bit scary."

My suggestion(and theirs too) would be to resend the documents and call within 3 days to verify they can see it ok.  The fax coming in dark could be on either end. Send it again from your end and lighten it when you send it. You should have the option on the fax machine to do that.  Best of luck."

The pistol is now a ""buy it with my year-end bonus"" thing, but figured there was no way I wasn't buying something to take to the range after waiting that long, I sold an old guitar and used the cash to pick up this lovely 1953 SKS.  As a bonus, when I went to Canadian Tire to buy a cable lock, they had small paper packs of what I'm assuming was unboxed surplus combloc ammo. Label said 10 rounds of 7.62x39 for $3.50, but the size of the pack sure looked like 20 to me, so I bought 10.  Unwrapped one when I got home, and sure enough, 20 cartridges.  I might go back tomorrow and clean them out. Hard to argue with 17 and a half cents a round."

canadaguns,3dlm7a,VentCo,1 point,Fri Jul 17 07:15:33 2015 UTC,"It almost looks like it's never been fired, but it's got a few minor handling dings and scratches on it.  1953 from Tula, hardwood stock, serial numbers all match, but it's got a refurb stamp on the receiver cover, which might be for the bayo, because it's basically a black-painted, bayo-shaped hunk of metal, and it's about as sharp as the front end of a 1977 Peterbilt cabover.  My first project is going to be stripping the paint and trying to put an edge on it.  EDIT: Upon closer inspection, it looks like the gas tube and handguard cover were replaced. The handguard cover looks to be laminate, and I can see what looks like a very faded previous serial number under the new one.  I'll be taking it apart tomorrow to inspect and clean everything, but that's all I've noticed so far."

I think it looks pretty sweet, and have read two possibilities.  1) Recent refurb that used the black/blued bayonets that were originally intended for the early SKS (that last part is probably bollocks) 2) Apparently SKSs from the first half of 1950 used the black bayonet, but were quickly switched out for the silver ones. From what I've read the black bayonets on the refurbed guns might be from the original batch from back in the day, repurposed for the refurbs. (again, probably BS, but who knows!)"

canadaguns,3djvls,CeeZeeBoy,4,Thu Jul 16 22:03:53 2015 UTC,There were also a few given last Xmas.   Nice job snipers. Nice to see grown men reduced to wide-eyed boys on Xmas morning.
canadaguns,3djvls,Cheese_Bits,3,Thu Jul 16 22:59:02 2015 UTC,I have photos of my uncle opening the sniper svt40 I managed to score him 2 years back when they were on for 200 bucks and he was pretty childlike in aww.  Money well spent:)
canadaguns,3djvls,Kaffarov,4,Fri Jul 17 00:31:18 2015 UTC,Nice! Is that a black bayonet on it?
canadaguns,3djvls,steamBommer29,7,Thu Jul 16 21:31:28 2015 UTC,"It is! I always thought those looked kinda neat.  From the same factory, they meet at last."
canadaguns,3djvls,Cubiclehero,3,Thu Jul 16 21:39:55 2015 UTC,"i really like the look of the bottom bayonet. Seems more ""real"" to me.  Did you do something to it or did it come like that?"
canadaguns,3djvls,steamBommer29,5,Thu Jul 16 22:49:14 2015 UTC,"The one with the black bayonet is the one /u/KdF-Wagen just sent me. The silver one is the one I bought a few years ago.   As far as I know, they didn't originally come blued like that, I think it's something an exporter or someone did to it. /u/Cubiclehero would know for sure."
canadaguns,3djvls,Cubiclehero,4,Thu Jul 16 22:57:01 2015 UTC,Blued bayos are a part of some more recent refurb processes. No black bayos are ever original. I personally really like the black bayo loom.
canadaguns,3djvls,steamBommer29,3,Thu Jul 16 23:34:03 2015 UTC,Do you know how i could get that look on my bayonet? (the process they use)
canadaguns,3djvls,Cubiclehero,5,Fri Jul 17 00:45:09 2015 UTC,I tried to cold blue one before but it didn't work at all.  It's almost like a parkerized finish.  Easiest way to get it to look like that would be to use matte bbq paint haha.
canadaguns,3djvls,KdF-wagen,3,Fri Jul 17 01:16:55 2015 UTC,ahh haha alrighty  thanks!
canadaguns,3djvls,Cubiclehero,2,Fri Jul 17 03:02:17 2015 UTC,"That's what I thought, it's also got that matte ""BBQ paint"" finish.  I really like the black bayonet too, but could never do it to my own SKS."
canadaguns,3djvls,steamBommer29,3,Thu Jul 16 23:37:02 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure all the recent SKS imports are all molot. And therefore all will have the BBQ paint finish and from what I have seen, mismatched mags."
canadaguns,3djvls,BeaverNutz,3,Thu Jul 16 23:43:07 2015 UTC,"We have a bunch of sks's at our CrappyTire where I got this, some receivers are blued and some are black ""paint"", some of the bayos are bright and some are blued in various configurations, there seems to be no rhyme or reason. They let me go through about 10 of the 30 they have in the back before I found this combo."
canadaguns,3djvls,Trevyp0042,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:57:27 2015 UTC,"I guess that explains everything, interesting that they'd do that.  The magazine seems to match this one, the gas tube has been electro penciled though.   Something funny I noticed is that the trigger guard has a matching number, but seems to be stamped on a surface that's been filed flat. The last number seems like it's stampted on funny too."
canadaguns,3djvls,Red_1977,2,Fri Jul 17 19:46:06 2015 UTC,That is a older force match from a older refurb.

canadaguns,3djvls,YoungRudiger,2,Fri Jul 17 09:55:49 2015 UTC,Is this a secret sniper first?  I would bet it is.

canadaguns,3dl6df,LoydJesus,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:21:36 2015 UTC,Not 22. If this is similar to the others then 223 or larger/faster will work so 7.62x39 should work well.

canadaguns,3dlb92,airchinapilot,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:55:38 2015 UTC,Mission is a nice range. The very first range I visited in fact.  I enjoyed trying to hit the tank or whatever gong they have on the side of the mountain.

canadaguns,3dkw5w,Mcwalleye,8,Fri Jul 17 02:30:12 2015 UTC,Would strongly recommend avoiding a taurus have heard very little good about the company their quality control is unreliable at best. Also if you haven't shot handguns much or at all start with something a bit smaller I assume you where looking at the 45 lc model not the 454 casull.  Even 357 has a nice snap to it but would be a lot better for starting with.
canadaguns,3dkw5w,Devious17,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:14:26 2015 UTC,Thanks for the info!
canadaguns,3dkw5w,Devious17,3,Fri Jul 17 03:31:13 2015 UTC,And if you really want your hand cannon I would look at a ruger Redhawk in 45lc or 454 casull (you can still shoot 45 lc in the 454) but maybe go and try to rent something in one of those bigger calibers. 45 lc isn't terrible simply because a lot of it is loaded a bit light for use in older revolvers.  Also enjoy your restricted it's a blast hard on the wallet though.
canadaguns,3dkw5w,Cheese_Bits,0,Fri Jul 17 03:44:48 2015 UTC,"Ruger revolver qc is top notch and they take care of you as a customer. Their pistols are all super tough and excepting their airweight defensive revolvers will hold up to all the abuse you could put it to.  Fyi a hot ""ruger only"" .45lc load is more powerful than a .44 magnum :D"

canadaguns,3dkw5w,CruelHandLuke7,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:29:06 2015 UTC,686 or 586 is where it's at.  Also fyi you can run 38 spl out of any revolver chambered in 357.
canadaguns,3dkw5w,mrchenry,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:50:32 2015 UTC,"I recommend a .22 as a first gun. The ammo is super cheap and you can start perfecting the 7 basic principles of shooting. Once you make some range buddies you can try their guns and see what works for you before you buy.  I own 5 handguns at the moment and like each one for different reasons, but my SW 617 is the gun I am most accurate with."

canadaguns,3djyg1,Secretsniperburner,1 point,Fri Jul 17 07:41:47 2015 UTC,"Well in our case out magazines are special as they have to rivet them to accept only 5 rounds.  This means an extra step in the process, which limits the amount of magazines they make for us.  Quite simply if it was just regular capacity magazines we wouldn't have this problem as I am sure they have no shortage of magazines for the Sg 542 laying around to supply the Chilean army.  Had a good conversation with the owner of ERE systems about magazines.  Unfortunately they simply do not have the money to produce them themselves.  Which is weird as we have companies that produce .50 beowolf magazines in Canada, albeit polymer ones.  What's interesting is that ERE systems knows that the magazine prices are a problem as there is a limited supply.  They also know that serious buyers are looking at things like buying extra magazines and shying away from the purchase due to only having 2 magazines for both rifles at purchase.  Famae is looking into making some rifles for the US market, hopefully they catch on and we can benefit from US makers producing parts / accessories for Famae rifles.  But that still doesn't solve the problem today, only something to look forward for in the future."

canadaguns,3didyb,jon9613,3,Thu Jul 16 18:58:28 2015 UTC,"I've experienced it... It's a detonation, not deflagration. It's not the same as just burning powder in an unenclosed vessel, there is a loud crack indicating a supersonic pressure wave and thus, detonation. Also, the primer is a primary explosive and will always detonate and not deflagrate even when not enclosed."
canadaguns,3didyb,Red_1977,0,Thu Jul 16 19:10:48 2015 UTC,"The difference relates to the speed of burning and not the speed of the gases expanding from the casing.  While the primer is assuredly a detonation, the powder is not."
canadaguns,3didyb,dovanick,3,Thu Jul 16 19:13:53 2015 UTC,"Most of the powder is not burned at all. The primer detonates blowing apart the 22 case. It's the detonation of the primer that blows up the case for 22LR.

IMO it should have read something like ""It was determined there was no illegal action taken, therefore no criminal charges will be laid"" or ""It was determined these actions saved the lives of others and was justified, therefore no criminal charges will be laid""  It almost seems like they're saying, if we could of found something to put you in jail we would have, no matter if you deserved it or not"
canadaguns,3ddwjr,B33sting,10,Wed Jul 15 14:48:24 2015 UTC,"I slightly agree with what you're saying, but if you shift your thinking a bit, I think you'll find that you actually agree with the statement you highlighted more than you think.   The basis of our justice system is that guilt, while ideally an objective truth, is something that is determined by the courts  -someone cannot be guilty of something without a court ruling it so.   So to say ""no reasonable prospect of conviction"" is not just ""we don't think we would win"" (which would bug me too if I read it that way), but also, in a legal sense IS saying ""they weren't guilty"" - they were saying there's no way a court could convict him / find him guilty, therefore he likely didn't do it.   Courts like to stay away from ""what did"" vs ""what didn't"" happen. All they can do is demonstrate a court's findings, and that is taken an as a proxy for the truth.     I read ""no reasonable prospect of conviction"" as the same thing as ""didn't do anything wrong"""
canadaguns,3ddwjr,cleverun,9,Wed Jul 15 15:55:43 2015 UTC,"That was very well put.

canadaguns,3ddwjr,B33sting,3,Wed Jul 15 16:22:13 2015 UTC,Crowns love to have a high conviction rate. It's literally something they discuss amongst themselves during boardroom lunches.  This competitive mentality encourages plea deals on controversial cases and a lack of interest in pursuing difficult ones.  The new defense laws certainly complicate things as well and i believe there's a reluctance to test and affirm their validity and application.

I have no desire to pillory the security guard, and I trust the police and Crown when they say, essentially, ""It was justifiable self-defence.""  BUT I still think it would be in the public interest to release both a timeline of events and at least selected parts of the video (e.g. the beginning of the ""physical confrontation"").   Blur the guard's face, cut the released video before the gun comes out, continue not to release the guard's name, that's all fine.  But ""physical confrontation"" covers a lot of ground, and I'd like to see for myself where on the spectrum this incident fit; was it a full-tilt-bozo let's-jump-this-guy physical attack, or was it an accidental bumping-into-each-other?

On one hand I'm sure it's a relief to the individual, but when these things go to court it gives us all a chance to have our laws examined and discussed, both by the public as well as the judiciary.  Several lethal and sometimes questionable ""self defense shootings"" have occured since the modifications to our defense laws and to my knowledge they haven't been taken to court.

canadaguns,3de8v6,ri7ani,2,Wed Jul 15 16:38:01 2015 UTC,the boiling water will heat the metal so much that the scolding metal will evaporate any water droplets remaining.   you can also (just for the sake of it) wipe the parts with a cloth. wait a bit for the metal to cool and oil thoroughly.

Because the water made the metal so hot any residual water evaporated. I just sat  them on paper towel ad I was doing the rest and by the time I finished and was ready to lubricated they were all dry and cool.

canadaguns,3de8v6,mowens87,3,Wed Jul 15 16:28:59 2015 UTC,I am a little afraid of using WD40 because people have said if not removed it will become yellow and hard and discolouration will occur on the metal. I've never heard of windex being used before. What exactly do you use it as just a cleaner? Do you oil every part after fully cleaning the gun?
canadaguns,3de8v6,BoltActionBastard,3,Wed Jul 15 16:36:35 2015 UTC,"WD40 does a good job of dissolving the cosmoline, then windex does a good job of removing the WD40. The light coat of oil after cleaning (just some gun oil on a cloth is fine) will prevent rust. As long as you don't let the rifle sit dripping with WD40 for months at a time you're not going to have a problem. I just use it to remove the cosmoline.  Corrosive ammo is corrosive because the residue from the primer contains salts. Windex being water based can dissolve the salts and it contains detergents that help clean the carbon off. Boiling water also works, but I find windex more convenient. Regular gun cleaner does not dissolve or remove the salts."

canadaguns,3de8v6,Jeff_R,2,Thu Jul 16 01:41:04 2015 UTC,The aftermarket stock is in the plans for the future!
canadaguns,3de8v6,Philosaurousrex,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:33:47 2015 UTC,I love it ! The only issue with after market stocks are sometimes the handgaurd and stock will fit such that it's hard to close the gas tube release. I read you can either put the gas tube on before placing the barrel into the stock during assembly or file down where the contact is tight. I just place the hand guard on first because I'm not 100% where the handgaurd Is tight and I don't want to file away at any parts.
canadaguns,3de9dh,Barabarabbit,5,Wed Jul 15 16:18:59 2015 UTC,"I have.  I photographed their whole line a little while ago and got to handle all the firearms.  For the pricepoint, you can't go wrong.  They are incredibly well-made and the fit and finish is nice.   I haven't shot them unfortunately, as we didn't have the time, but it is on a short-list of pistols for me to buy."

canadaguns,3d9lk9,Slappy_MC_Garglenutz,2,Wed Jul 15 00:47:33 2015 UTC,"From the time I first picked it up I had to have it. The aluminum grips are just perfect for my hands (I don't have huge bear paws) the weight is perfect and the balance when you shoot is near perfect. The trigger is beautiful too, competition trigger so the creep is pretty far (you get used to it) but between shots you barely have to lift off the trigger. I always buy/sell/trade, this one I'll never let go of"

This Finnish gun is super smooth. It sports a blued bolt(lots of blue has worn away) which suggests the bolt could have been a German rework.  The gun still has the Czars Imperial crest acceptance mark on the receiver. Lots of them were ground off after the Russian revolution, so I feel this could have been captured by Finland before 1917.  The gun has a lot of old Tula parts, one Remington part and few Sestroryetsk parts.   The barrel looks new with super sharp rifiling. I'm told its been an excellent shooter.

canadaguns,3dagsd,cleverun,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:33:58 2015 UTC,"Thanks for sharing!  Quick question: If I'm looking to build an AR, what's the best way to start? I'm worried about parts compatibility, specifically, and also making sure I have all the parts, as silly at that sounds..."
canadaguns,3dagsd,AltC,3,Tue Jul 14 20:54:57 2015 UTC,"Personally, I believe the best way to start is to order a stripped lower. It's the only part that needs to be registered and transferred and not as many places sell them. It's legally the ""firearm"" all the rest can be sourced from many more stores. As long as it's milspec, pretty much everything is compatible.   The order I recommend: Stripped lower (Saskatoon gun works)  LPK (lower parts kit. Includes the trigger and all the pins and springs for the lower. Buffer tube kit. (Tube, spring, castle nut, buffer)  Stock  At this point you have a completed lower. That's useable on an upper. Now you want to figure out what kind of specs you want your gun to have, like barrel length and gas system length  Most commonly you are going to see 14.5, 16.5 and 18.5 barrel and carbine, mid and rifle length systems. Figure out what sort of hand guard you want, free flat or classic? Do you want a standard front sight post/gas block, or does it need to be low profile for your hand guard. There's a lot more stuff going on in the upper, but it's more about how much do you want to spend and what are your preference."
canadaguns,3dagsd,cleverun,2,Tue Jul 14 21:05:10 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the quick response.   I always knew / figured I would start there... I guess I'm still a little nervous (which is totally fine because I don't even have my PAL yet anyways, and I would start with a more simple project in the beginning)"
canadaguns,3dagsd,AltC,3,Tue Jul 14 21:08:54 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't be nervous at all. At first when you hear people talking about building an AR and all the parts it can be a bit overwhelming.  Realistically all you need for a lower is a stripped lower, lower parts kit, a buffer kit and a stock.  Watch this video and you'll see how easy it is.  If you don't have your PAL yet, you can buy everything you need but the stripped lower receiver.  The most important thing when buying all the parts is to check EE and every site imaginable that sells AR parts. The prices vary quite a bit from site to site. For example, my upper receiver was $220 on one site and $290 on another."

canadaguns,3dagsd,cleverun,2,Tue Jul 14 23:06:02 2015 UTC,ARs are super simple and easy. And I highly recommend building your own. And you can build it as you have extra money. A quality stripped lower by aero is 125 dollars.
canadaguns,3dagsd,AltC,2,Tue Jul 14 21:18:53 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice / encouragement.   What if someone wanted to do a high quality AR build... colt receiver, etc. Are there still any significant cost savings, or at a certain point is it just cheaper to buy the whole thing from a manufacturer, but people do it so they can get exactly what they want?   Sorry, I know this might be an annoying question to answer."

It is definitely heavier than the Tikka and Browning I checked out, which I liked as I will be mostly shooting from a bench.

A 0 stamp is a very accurate rifle generally assigned to ""sniping"" tasks where a stamp of 3 is quite a bit less accurate but still great for putting lead down range. It is a battle rifle and was meant to survive the worst conditions but in skilled hands it's a thing of beauty."

I have even seen a dude with a .338 at 50 yards? WHY?!! A: Fuck that place.

I have never once seen a charlie out that way checking licenses or even monitoring behavior. You'd be better off find a good long deep clear cut driving a few clicks down it in the same area and cleanup after your done... plenty of logging roads down that way just make damn sure they are not active back that way. Your other option is forestry trunk road (where crover's posse used too, still? goes) it's a bit of a farther drive but well worth the seclusion. Basically the rules say if it ain't fenced and it ain't grazing land you can use it back that way... obviously just ensure a good back stop and make sure the cut lines are not active when you are using them.  I still go to homestead once in a while but if I see someone being a twat I will only ask them once to correct their actions and then I will leave. I've had good days out that way, and I've had bad ones. Most people just need someone (usually the guy at either end) to take charge as a RO... just make sure people are clearing and hold opening their actions before walking down range, and if you see someone fucking about with their gun while you are down range yell ""CEASEFIRE MEANS DON'T TOUCH YOUR GUN""."

canadaguns,3d86dj,airchinapilot,5,Tue Jul 14 07:01:04 2015 UTC,"This was my first full on official multi-gun and although I do IPSC regularly I was barely able to keep up. I didn't do particularly well but I am committed to coming back next year. A great event with awesome hospitality from the match staff and the locals. I was impressed how much they put into the stage and the landscape they had to work with.   My crew came aiming just to have fun, hence the costumes. The atmosphere was very friendly and there were families and volunteers in abundance. So many great shooters too including a couple in my squad who I could only call martial artists with guns. Remember Equilibrium? Yes, Gunkata. It's real.    Things I learned (in no particular order):   Bring clothes for all kinds of weather. I got alternately sunburned and soaked by thundershowers.  Treat the stage walkthrough and briefing seriously. I got hosed by forgetting or not remembering when I was able to engage targets. Or if in doubt, go slow and take a look around before you dump your pistol. Carts carts carts. If you don't have a cart come with someone who brought a cart. Not lugging your guns around is not just a luxury, it is a necessity on a long day.  Always hydrate. In the heat of the day when you nod off your concentration goes and that's it. Also bring snacks. Shotgun capacity is a huge advantage. Guys with pumps with theoretically unlimited capacity have an inherent advantage unless the semi gunner has loading skill.  Practice long range to pick up steel shots. I felt I did pretty well with long range on rifle. On Stage 10 many spent a lot of ammunition trying to hit 50 yards on pistol.  Bring tools. I had to fix or adjust things almost every stage.  Economy of motion. The real competitors seemed to make big motions and the minimum of steps to engage the most targets. This is where IPSC is a great foundation.  Don't wear big fucking floppy hats.  I love those belt systems like the Safariland that allow you to quickly get items off and on your belt. This comes in handy when you're going to the outhouse. Here is how you shoot a Texas Star. Shoot from the top and as the star starts to turn anti-clockwise just let the targets swing up into your view. ping ping ping. You could chase it like I did but you have to be sure with your abilities.  In the end, you can be slow, momentarily stupid or have other problems but if you don't have accuracy you can't dig yourself out of whatever other hole you dug yourself into. So above all else, be accurate.   A wonderful event and highly recommended."

canadaguns,3d8c3d,icedesparten,2,Tue Jul 14 08:16:12 2015 UTC,I've handled and fired and thoroughly examined both. The cz858 does not have an adjustable gas port. Side by side you can begin to notice some of the differences. Mostly the cz 858 is the version originally made by CZ. It's almost identical to the Czech military models of vz 58. The csa is basically made by a company that copied the vz 58 and made a civilian legal version. To do this they needed to modify certain aspects of the rifle. The biggest thing that stands out to me is the feed ramp. The cz858 has a very wide and well angled ramp. Lending this rifle very good reliability.  The csa on the other hand has a much smaller feed ramp and this makes th3 rifle very picky about magazines.
canadaguns,3d8c3d,Atheist_gun_nut,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:12:07 2015 UTC,"picky about magazines.   How so? Considering that there really aren't any aftermarket ones. The surplus military ones are compatible with both 858 and Vz.58, are cheap and plentiful.   The biggest issue I have with the mags is because they are pinned, I can't seat a fully loaded mag (5 rds) with a closed action. If I try, the bolt carrier is jammed and I can't pull it back to load a round. However, this is due to the rivet, not the mag - if it was a fully loaded 30rd, there would still be space in the bottom of the mag to allow a fully loaded mag to seat and load."

On the budget side, Norinco has an interesting Sig Clone in 7.62x25: P762 or how about a nice basic 1911?  I could go on, but I'll just be living through your experience.

I did shoot a CZ Shadow and liked it, so maybe. I won't rule out an AR but right now I'm interested in a 1911 in .22. I've shot a GSG 1911, as well as the Sig.

canadaguns,3d5c3i,KdF-wagen,3,Mon Jul 13 20:26:32 2015 UTC,Regular ammo is useless in tactical situations
canadaguns,3d5c3i,HapGil,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:49:09 2015 UTC,Is this ammo non-restricted or restricted?
canadaguns,3d5c3i,HapGil,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:31:47 2015 UTC,Well #1) You can't 0p3r8 with regular ammo it's against operation rules and finally B) You have to have tactical ammo to hunt pterodactyls.
canadaguns,3d5c3i,downvotemeufags,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:36:59 2015 UTC,Hunting bullets wont hold up to the same conditions as tactical. Hunters take a couple shots through a relatively cool barrel. Tactical situations may require multiple shots on target through an increasingly hot barrel until the threat/s is neutralized. OR watch Bob Beck explain it
canadaguns,3d5wt0,MotoGuy82,2,Mon Jul 13 19:47:46 2015 UTC,"Have a look at ""Seating depth"" here:  http://www.nosler.com/news-and-articles/2013/6/4/beyond-the-basics-developing-your-own-loads"
canadaguns,3d5wt0,thingpaint,2,Mon Jul 13 20:12:59 2015 UTC,"Different brands have a different ogive distance, even in similar profiles (VLDs from Berger will be different than Sierras). There are many ways to measure the distance to the lands (google is your friend here) but it mostly boils down to using a modified case and a bullet seated loosely, measured with a comparator to give you the distance to the ogive.  A shorter leade (the area before the rifling starts) will give you more accurate results than a longer leade. You can definitely use a custom reamer for a specific type of bullet, as this is done in the precision rifle world.   Edit: The bottom of this page has information on leades that you might find interesting."
canadaguns,3d5wt0,TehObviousAnswer,2,Mon Jul 13 20:13:02 2015 UTC,Wasn't that the idea behind this guy's SKS? http://www.thefirearmblog.com/blog/2015/07/10/1moa-sks/
canadaguns,3d5wt0,thehuntinggearguy,2,Mon Jul 13 20:51:14 2015 UTC,"Sort of.  That gun is barely an SKS.  I'm just trying to understand at this point, rather than building it right away..."
canadaguns,3d5wt0,mrchenry,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:49:30 2015 UTC,"Seriously. It's just the SKS' action, and nothing else. And not even the complete action since it has no gas system.  That thing's an SKS in the same way that this 736HP 2.0L 16V Turbo car is a VW Golf MK 1."
canadaguns,3d5wt0,alkali_feldspar,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:02:18 2015 UTC,"There's no point chasing something better than 1 MOA with an SKS. The tilting bolt design just isn't inherently as precise as a rotating bolt. Also, 7.62x39 is really not designed for long range where you can use the sub MOA accuracy."
canadaguns,3d5wt0,alkali_feldspar,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:11:34 2015 UTC,"It's looking more and more like I need to know the dimensions of the bullet first, before the throat angle / seating depth can be calculated.  I have read here and there conversations about custom reamers.  Anyone actually do this, or have a friend who did?"
canadaguns,3d5wt0,alkali_feldspar,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:51:06 2015 UTC,"You need this, a modified case, and a bullet. And you can measure the required seating depth. It's really simple."
canadaguns,3d3bgs,LibrarianOfBabel,3,Mon Jul 13 04:38:49 2015 UTC,Looks like the safety and likely bolt cocking are the same as the Lee Enfield.  I expect that'll be appreciated by the rangers.
canadaguns,3d3bgs,douglask,3,Mon Jul 13 13:48:15 2015 UTC,Keeping the manual of arms the same? That's actually pretty smart.

canadaguns,3d3bgs,Devious17,2,Mon Jul 13 07:45:24 2015 UTC,Why is it so expensive
canadaguns,3d3bgs,mrchenry,9,Mon Jul 13 05:00:52 2015 UTC,"from what i understand, they are trying to offset some of the R&D costs, if you look at the price for the tikka ranger rifle its also hella expensive. Hell even the ruger Gunsite scout (which is essentially the same concept) goes for ~1000$ But i dont think it was designed to deal with the temperature changes that the rangers rifles experience, think about it, going from minus -40C to a nice warm shack or tent. moisture is gonna build up like a bitch, youre gonna need a well built rifle to deal with that."
canadaguns,3d3bgs,Devious17,2,Mon Jul 13 05:27:20 2015 UTC,"Yea the sako/Tikka for the Rangers cost 4000 per rifle or at least so they say but that includes a metric shit ton of ammo, a sling, nice pelican case and I think a scope."
canadaguns,3d3bgs,Dolinski_Von_Hoyer,4,Mon Jul 13 10:05:13 2015 UTC,"The $4K/rifle is basically the cost of the entire development project spread over each rifle. Research, development, production, licensing fees, all accessories, ammunition, and project administration overhead."

There is already a clear and proven bias towards fast tracking their friends and family.

canadaguns,3d08wx,caffelightning,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:53:00 2015 UTC,"I'm a member and have been for around 2-3 years now. So if you have an more questions, feel free to ask and I'll do my best to answer.    In general, it's never super busy. Because of noise (I believe), there are only 3 days a week that you can shoot centre fire though, so that's something to keep in mind.    The 2 busiest days are wed and sun. But I've gone on a nice sunday afternoon and been the only person on the short range.    I don't think I've ever seen more than 5 people shooting at a time on an individual range outside of an event. And if you shoot 22 on an off day, I can almost guarantee you'll be alone.    As far as fees, they may run you a little bit more than other ranges from what I've seen, but it depends on what you do. Each section has it's own fees associated with it. (IE. there is a base membership fee, and then you add the price for each section you want access to). The largest fee comes from the archery section which I'm also a member of. (If you want specifics let me know and I'll track them down, but to give you an idea, I have basically everything including archery and its around $400-450 a year from what I remember)    In general, I really like it and have no complaints. It's certainly my favorite range in the immediate area, but living in Ancaster, that may also be tainted by the fact that it's like 10 min's away."

To get the firing pin out on that model is a real cunt and there is a VERY good possibility you will damage the bolt getting the firing pin out.

canadaguns,3cxktj,CreateBread,3,Sun Jul 12 13:12:20 2015 UTC,"Its been years since I've played with one so I'm not 100%but IIRC you have to find a pin on the front part of the bolt, drift it out, then split the bolt like you would any other, then modify a flat screwdriver into a pinwrench of sorts, turn a nut out (if it will come out) pull that part out with the spring behind it and then remove the pin. Usually the part where you knock the crosspin out is so worn you can't find it or it wont come out or you damage the bolt ."

They love those Lee-Enfields - that environment is as brutal to equipment as anything on the face of the earth and the Lee-Enfields just do. not. fuck. up. Hope the Tikkas hold up as well.   EDIT: Love the yahoo in the article comments saying the rifle wouldn't hold up against semiauto rifles. Dumbass, try firing your tacticool AR covered in snow at -50 and see what happens."

canadaguns,3ct8t1,nope586,1 point,Sat Jul 11 01:07:43 2015 UTC,Are you seriously advocating giving surplus Russian rifles to Canadian Forces?  How well would that play in the media?
canadaguns,3ct8t1,elizabeth-the-second,4,Sat Jul 11 16:09:45 2015 UTC,Wasn't going to upvote... but the Chechen comment got me. Well played
canadaguns,3ct8t1,azemar117,4,Fri Jul 10 19:53:32 2015 UTC,"Also, the comment about 'Having the U.S. gun lobby in their back pocket' made me cringe inside. And of course, complaining that Harper is spending too much on these. If he spent less, they'd be whining about how he cheaped out. Spend too much? Yupp he's screwing Canada over as well.   Tell me again WHY do I scroll down to the comments ...WHY?!"
canadaguns,3ct8t1,mizzymo,3,Sat Jul 11 15:49:04 2015 UTC,"It's not even the firing you have to worry about. It's going in and out of cold/warm environments (ie. indoors and outdoors in winter).  There's a whole big part of Canadian Forces training that deals with how rifles are to be treated in arctic environments, and it's a massive pain in the ass. Specifically, it's how to manage condensation and build up of water/ice on the rifle, as well as the mitigation of rust. The lifetime and functionality of these rifles can be strongly effected.  If infantrymen thought they cleaned their rifles a lot normally, wait until you get to the arctic.  That's not even getting into the special lubricants you need."
canadaguns,3ct8t1,Leovinus_Jones,3,Fri Jul 10 19:03:49 2015 UTC,"I was sticking to a basic example but as I said, I'm from the Arctic. There's a reason Northerners mostly stick to ancient bolt-actions - try maintaining even a simple modern semi-auto under those conditions."
canadaguns,3ct8t1,suredont,2,Fri Jul 10 19:12:58 2015 UTC,Another reason why we're probably safe from a US invasion. Dem Texas boys don't know 'bout dat cold.

canadaguns,3ct8t1,Devious17,3,Sat Jul 11 02:42:00 2015 UTC,"Love the yahoo in the article comments saying the rifle wouldn't hold up against semiauto rifles.   Not only that but right on their website they give a description of what they do ""They provide patrols and detachments for national-security and public-safety missions in sparsely settled northern, coastal and isolated areas of Canada.""   I'm not in the military so maybe some one could tell me when exactly would you face semiauto rifles doing patrols or public-safety missions? they aren't going into war zones on a daily basis, they are more likely using the gun against wild life."
canadaguns,3ct8t1,Umedark,2,Fri Jul 10 19:25:11 2015 UTC,I know what you mean I work in the Arctic and know quite a few rangers they do like the enfield but I really think the Tikka will be a better gun it is designed to be a lot more accurate then the Lee and will be a lot lighter. Also the Canadian army trains in the Arctic and the c7s don't seem to care to much still deffinitly a pain in the ass. Definitely not a bolt action but still they hold up. One thing I hope they considered is the ammo being temperature immune. Also seeing the way those enfields get beat around in the planes I work on the pelican case they get with each rifle will be nice.

canadaguns,3ct8t1,sammy1022,-1,Fri Jul 10 18:08:05 2015 UTC,"I would think something like a Springfield M14 would have been a better choice, just it being semi-auto and the ability to use 20 round mags would make it much more practical.  Maybe it wouldn't hold up in extreme cold but I'd think it would do fine, they're pretty well built and have a reputation for being a hard use gun. With the right lube and everything it probably wouldn't have a problem, not sure why they prefer going with a bolt gun I guess just ease of use? Probly what the rangers are used to as well after so long with Enfields, and the maintenance that goes into semi-autos, I guess I answered my own question lol."
canadaguns,3ct8t1,YosemiteSam357,2,Fri Jul 10 20:52:35 2015 UTC,"Here's Forgotten Weapons take on how ""hard use"" the m14 is. Plus semi-autos have a habit of freezing up in extreme cold, so something like a bolt gun with fewer moving parts is more reliable. That, and the Rangers aren't a fighting force, they patrol and guide the rest of the military when we're up north."
canadaguns,3ct8t1,Z3X0,2,Fri Jul 10 23:56:21 2015 UTC,"Yea it makes sense, after commenting I was thinking about what I bring out with me when hunting in super cold weather or just being out in the bush when it's super cold and it's almost always a bolt action rifle. A wood stock bolt action rifle just seems to fit when you're out there surrounded by endless km's of wilderness, although a nice shotgun with slugs and buckshot is always comforting in bear country too.    On a side note, how awesome is full30? It's great to have so many of the best firearms channels in one place to just binge on videos for a couple hours haha.

canadaguns,3crxli,diablo_man,3,Fri Jul 10 15:37:36 2015 UTC,"Not OP but I recently bought one as well.  Having shot it for a while, and gone back to my SKS - I thought my SKS' trigger was broken, so long, mushy and softly-breaking it is.   In comparison, the trigger on the Vz58 is sharp, crisp and responsive. The rifle itself is accurate, rugged, dependable and elegantly simply in design - which is what I wanted.   If I had the option to purchase an AK in Canada for half the price, I would have. But I didn't, so I bought a Vz58.   Plus it has all the ammo-related benefits of an SKS (ie. you can shoot the cheap and ubiquitous 7.62x39) - it even has a stripper clip slot in the bolt carrier so you can load it that way if you prefer.   It's a nice rifle with a few drawbacks, but these are shared with the SKS so it's still ahead of the game:  Optics mounting.   I went for the factory-made side mount. It's made for the gun, by the same company. Requires zero gunsmithing, fast easy on-off with Zero retention for your optics. It doesn't block the stripper clip guide, and it is rock solid. The only downside is that a cheek weld with it requires a stock with a raised comb. Mine just has an M4-style collapsible stock. It still works well, but when sighting through an optic it doesn't feel as 'solid' as you having your cheek against the solid stock of an SKS. But it more than makes up for it in accuracy. Strongly recommend this mount over all the others.  With the exception of a forward scout-style mount which would allow you to keep iron-sights cheekweld, but would also require you to use either a red dot or a scope with very long eye relief.   It doesnt have rails, but there are options available. I kindof like the standard furniture (in black, not beaver-barf) and am just going to add an underslung rail section so I can mount a forward grip.   If you have big hands (like me) you may find the pistol grip annoying. The top of the grip is recessed (palm swell?) so much that if I hold the grip, my index finger's middle knuckle is what contacts the trigger. This is fiddly but not a dealbreaker. I'm hoping to get a Magpul AK grip and modify it to fit, as others have apparently done so with good success and its a lot meatier.  Disclosure: I bought this rifle because I wanted one good, dependable rfke that could do a little bit of everything - a General Purpose Rifle. Especially if it utilizes cheap and available ammo, itself an intermediate cartridge with applications for plinking, hunting and tactical shooting.   Is it expensive? Yes. Probably more than it should be. I expect the price of these rifles to go down a bit, as they seem to be flooding the market. The finish of some of the machining was surprisingly rough, though this is aesthetic and in no way impedes function.   Its freed up my SKS to become the 'truck gun' because I don't much care if it gets a bit beaten up. The price I paid for the Vz58, it'll be hard not to turn it into a safe queen; got to get out there and shoot regularly.   So is it worth it? Well, decide what $1,000 will do for you - could it otherwise be spent to enrich your life? How important is having a solid, dependable rifle? These are questions only you can answer."
canadaguns,3crxli,mooseKaboose,2,Fri Jul 10 13:06:00 2015 UTC,"Like you I just bought a VZ 58 for much the same reasons and I completely agree with your reasoning. However, I came into it with the mindset of wanting a non-restricted semi auto that fired .223, as I have never been enamored by the 7.62x39. Looking at it from that perspective makes it a steal! The ammo is so super cheap and the only other gun in that price range is the norinco type 97! Realistically I want an XCR but for now, the VZ provides a huge jump up form the sks and I don't have to spend $3000 on it :)   Also, I bought mine from frontier firearms, in desert tan with the new ATI stock and fore end installed, shipped to my door for about $1100!"
canadaguns,3crxli,diablo_man,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:26:29 2015 UTC,"Nice, yes I agree that was a big motivation; a semi-automatic non restricted. The price is as much about supply and demand - ie. that it's being exclusively priced as there aren't many alternatives and they are all more expensive. (Tavor, XCR, T97, etc.)"

Decided I'd rather bubba my sks instead of dropping over a grand. Going to spend that money on a shotgun and put the rest towards a lever action or pistol.  Not saying I didn't like the vz58, but at this stage in my firearm journey (I only own 3 atm) I decided to hold off for now.   Should also add that Reliable Gun has a used one at the moment. It's ""deep earth green"" colour, which I wasn't personally huge on, and it has a couple of very small cosmetic scratches on the barrel, but it's on for $799. I think it's been there a while so might be able to bring them down on the price, but I'm not sure how that usually works with used firearms at gun shops."

canadaguns,3cqyj1,Devious17,5,Fri Jul 10 02:43:04 2015 UTC,It is also designed for the pistol. Don't question our silly leaders obviously the know what's best.... On a serious note I think the 10 round in a handgun trumps the designed for the firearm as well I would have to go read the wording of the laws and it's too late for that maybe tomorrow
canadaguns,3cqyj1,B33sting,2,Fri Jul 10 03:14:21 2015 UTC,"I found the law. It's a specific law regarding handgun/rifle rimfire magazines. These laws are ridicules, not ridicules as is ""I'm oppressed"" because of them but ridicules as in absurd and ignorant. The longer I'm in this sport the more frustrating it is.   Does that mean the mag is illegal or can you have one and just not use it in the 715T?"
canadaguns,3cqyj1,Devious17,2,Fri Jul 10 12:09:41 2015 UTC,You can have it but it would have to be pinned to 10 it's the fact that it fits the handgun that's the issue the butler creek 25 round 10/22 mags had the same issue you can still have a 25 round magazine as long as it won't fit the handgun.

canadaguns,3cqyj1,LibrarianOfBabel,2,Fri Jul 10 13:07:22 2015 UTC,Same reasoning why Ruger's BX-25 magazine for the 10/22 is prohibited: It's advertised to work with the Charger pistol and is therefore also a pistol magazine so it must be pinned to ten rounds.

They did the same thing with a particular brand of 25 rnd 10/22 mags becuase it fit in the Ruger Charger Pistols.  Every other 10/22 mag is still good even though they fit in the Charger too, but becuase the one was advertised as dual use it got limited.  I'm guessing MOssberg has advertised the 715T mags as fitting in the pistol so the RCMP decided they're dual use."

canadaguns,3cor2e,AkitoI,14,Fri Jul 10 01:44:45 2015 UTC,"To act as the executor (liquidator of the succession) you  may generally possess firearms left in an estate for a  reasonable amount of time while the estate is being settled,  even if you are not personally licensed to possess them. If a  court has prohibited you from possessing firearms, you cannot  take possession of firearms left in an estate, but you can still  act as the executor in transferring the firearms to someone who  can lawfully acquire them. Heirs to the estate will require a  firearm licence before you can transfer any firearm to them.  This includes yourself, if you are also an heir   Meaning, who ever takes care of your death can hold onto your guns for a while without having an RPAL. But if they want to keep em, they'll need to get their license like everybody else.  But, they can sell them to someone else or take em to the police for destruction."
canadaguns,3cor2e,1leggeddog,5,Thu Jul 9 16:03:00 2015 UTC,"Having had to deal with several deaths and acted as an executor for an estate (although no firearms were involved), I can confirm this info (but you should always confirm with a lawyer).  The most important thing everyone should know is: WRITE A WILL! Without it you have zero say in what happens to your stuff when you're gone. Don't put it off until it's too late and your family is burdened by having to figure out your shit for you."
canadaguns,3cor2e,svodiwuejkxlkadfuiop,2,Thu Jul 9 17:59:40 2015 UTC,"This extends to almost any, if you have an R-Pal or a P-Pal your estate has the same ""pal"" that you did, so the executor has all the rights you to posses them.   But, they can sell them to someone else or take em to the police for destruction.   I'm not sure they could take them to the police for destruction. The executor can't willfully destroy valuable assets like that.They have a duty to the estate. If the executor turned in a $5000 collection for destruction the other heirs of the estate could sue."
canadaguns,3cor2e,thingpaint,6,Thu Jul 9 19:42:58 2015 UTC,"When I die, someone please tell my wife what my guns are actually worth.

canadaguns,3cor2e,AltC,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:57:47 2015 UTC,"If you own 'real property' or have a mortgage, then you need a will.  They can be quick and easy, just to name an executor.  Or more complicated.  Many lawyers can do a simple one up for a couple hundred bucks at the most.    Mine just names an executor, and says to sell off everything and give the money to a non-profit I'm involved with."

canadaguns,3cor2e,Cheese_Bits,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:45:54 2015 UTC,Simple solutions.  1) Make a will if you don't already.  2) Make sure the will is specific as to who gets which firearms.  3) Make sure everyone so named in the will has or gets their PAL and keeps it current.

canadaguns,3cmbfu,Sandman8,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:11:10 2015 UTC,You can't go wrong with a Canadian made Savage Mark II.  I prefer to shoot without a scope but it comes drilled & tapped for a scope so you're good to go.
canadaguns,3cmbfu,alkali_feldspar,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:34:29 2015 UTC,The Savage Mark II TR .22 is one of the nicest rifles for $600 I've ever held.

canadaguns,3ckgu2,neoconfection,4,Wed Jul 8 16:44:33 2015 UTC,"Tell me you guys aren't locking your stuff in an airtight container.. :)  Interestingly, there's nothing in the law that requires you to lock them up. All it says is:   People not authorized by the user must not be given unlimited access to the propellant powder, percussion caps or black powder cartouches.   That doesn't necessarily mean it's locked up, and locking it up doesn't necessarily mean you're complying with this requirement :(  I live alone, and my front door locks. Conceivably that meets the requirement, since you would have to break into my place to get at my stuff. But, even if I lived with other people, leaving it on an open shelf in a room that had a lock on the door would probably suffice.  Personally I do lock my stuff up in a specially constructed box, and also in my gun cabinet (I keep my rifles in their carrying cases and put shelves in the Stackon cabinet)."

canadaguns,3ckgu2,xXWaspXx,3,Thu Jul 9 03:54:03 2015 UTC,Yay for storage laws that force us to lock explosives in the same container with no room for expansion (makes big boom boom) in the highly unlikely event that it blows.

canadaguns,3clnqg,perotech,2,Wed Jul 8 22:47:13 2015 UTC,"Late response, but expect them to be even more than $1500 in Canada.  With the exchange rate $1500USD is around $1875CAD."
canadaguns,3clnqg,NinjaGinger666,4,Sat Jul 11 01:52:15 2015 UTC,They can be found. Fairly rare and usually expensive as hell. You just have to keep an eye out. The cheapest I've seen a G43 was about $1500 and it was fairly heavily dicked with. They usually go for 2-4000 depending on condition and such.
canadaguns,3clnqg,NinjaGinger666,2,Wed Jul 8 22:57:24 2015 UTC,"Wow, they are expensive. I guess this is one of the rarer WWII guns. Well thank you, and everyone else for the info. I do hope to get one, but for that price it's moved down the list slightly"
canadaguns,3clnqg,VentCo,3,Wed Jul 8 23:01:11 2015 UTC,Ya. I've been keeping an eye out for one for a while. Like everything military surplus the prices have been getting crazy in the last ten or so years.  My dad actually had one back in the day. But he sold the stupid thing for $200.  So what's next on the list then if you don't mind me asking?
canadaguns,3clnqg,NinjaGinger666,2,Wed Jul 8 23:09:06 2015 UTC,"Yea, I've been reading about the crazy upward price in military surplus, i kinda wish i had gotten my Pal much sooner then i did.   Did you ever get a chance to shoot it? if so how was it? I herd good things about it, as most of the German guns.   At this time its kind of a toss up, i want a Tuarus judge, but want to hold out in case the governor comes to Canada.  I think ultimately i'm going to get a bolt action rifle, .308 hopefully or a Stoeger’s double defense( hopefully not sure if it's allowed here or not ), not sure which one tho, both are nice looking. sorry for the long reply."

There's actually a double defense for sale at my lgs so they're definitely allowed and available. Price is $489.  Personally I'd go for the bolt gun, but that's just personal preference. What're you planning on using them for?  And I don't mind. Gun talk is fun."
canadaguns,3clnqg,Cheese_Bits,2,Thu Jul 9 00:22:08 2015 UTC,"Ah, I take it shooting runs in the family ! If you don't mind me asking what other guns did your father own?   That's a really good price ( I think ) , I saw it for the same price in the us.  I probably will go with the bolt action, I just have this love for the milspec 700 , something about it just talks to me. Atm I am unable to shoot, but when I do,I'm a glorified hole punch, typically paper targets.  I am looking into my hunting course,I want to possibly go hunting and get a thanksgiving turkey, but still on the fence.   Hbu?"
canadaguns,3clnqg,Aspenkarius,2,Thu Jul 9 00:48:21 2015 UTC,"Oh ya. It does. The only other thing i really give him shit for selling is a original, all matching German K98 sniper. He got $250 for that one if I recall correctly. This was also before me.  The 700 is definitely a solid choice. I've always kinda liked them as far as new manufacture stuff goes.  Personally I'm mostly into collecting and shooting old military stuff. But I do hunt, target shoot, and reload as well.  If you can spare the cash you should get your hunting licence. It's certainly a hobby that gets a lot of flack but there's nothing quite like it."
canadaguns,3clnqg,Cheese_Bits,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:49:54 2015 UTC,"That would have been nice to have, i didn't even know they had a sniper variant of it. Your dad had some nice firearms.  Do you collect a specific type ( WWII and older, bolt action only )? or just military stuff in general. Eventually i want to become a serious collector, but at this time i don't have the money to get what i would want to be the center pieces of my collection. I have ordered some reload stuff to get started, but still waiting on it.   I do want to try hunting, i did contact the gentleman i did my pal with to see when his next courses are. Yea hunting does get a lot of flack, but imo it's better then mass farming."

With the current exchange, online probably isn't cheaper anyways."
canadaguns,3clpg3,mrchenry,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:34:49 2015 UTC,"Bolle, and others I'm sure, make these sunglasses with an Rx lens insert. I think the upfront cost is like 200-300 for just the glasses, but the benefit is you just pay for new lenses in the insert rather than having to get new Rx safety/sunglasses when your Rx changes. In some of them you can also change the sunglasses lenses for different tints.  I'm trying to find them on the website, but one of my range buddies uses a pair and it came with 3 different tints, 1 clear lens, and the Rx frame. It also had straps so they could be swapped out to goggles instead.  Personally I might change to goggles like that because wearing glasses and ear pro for extended periods gets really uncomfortable.  Loblaws Optical actually carries them, or something very similar.  [edit] Kind of like these. I have no idea how they're $20 though?? I wonder if they ship to Canada.  [edit 2] These aren't the same glasses I was thinking of, the lenses don't seem to be interchangable. But they are safety glasses, and they do have an Rx insert. Nice alternative to the expensive one, that's for sure. I might try to get a pair, they seem really useful.  [edit 3] Yes, they do ship to Canada. No, you don't want to order from them because they're charging like $50.  [edit 4] Amazon.ca seems to be the best choice so far for these things, at least online. They run 20-30, plus shipping because they're not shipped by Amazon."

Matching number rifles go for a lot more.  You can also find sporterized K98s for around $300-350, though replacing all the parts brings them up to about the price of an RC K98. I think they usually match though, I guess because someone brought it back from the war and turned it into a hunting rifle."
canadaguns,3cl1dx,sean1256,3,Thu Jul 9 01:02:50 2015 UTC,The soviets didn't care about matching serial numbers when they put their K98 captures back together.
canadaguns,3ckxnt,dads-bad-news,7,Wed Jul 8 18:39:58 2015 UTC,"Yes.  That is perfectly legal.  Unloaded is the only requirement for transporting, unloaded and locked separately from ammo is the requirement for storage (non-restricteds).  Your trunk counts as a locked container.  So to be super sure:  trigger or case lock the gat, and locked case the ammo.  My only concern would be that trunks get really hot and humid in the summer time so that might cause some corrosion, but as far as the law is concerned you should be good.  Maybe don't tell your co-workers you've got a gun in the trunk unless you work at a place where people would be cool with that, but as long as stuff is unloaded and locked it's legal."
canadaguns,3ckxnt,CheeseNBacon2,5,Wed Jul 8 18:47:15 2015 UTC,"+1.   Keep it covered and out of sight, too. Reduces questions, or prying hands."

canadaguns,3ckxnt,perotech,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:23:07 2015 UTC,You can make an errand stop while transporting a restricted as long as it is reasonably on the way to or from your club. Must be out of sight in a locked case with a trigger lock and unloaded. That's for restricted.

Yet another edit: OP /u/farcry9000 if you are seeking help, and live in the Hamilton area, I would encourage you to go to St. Joseph's hospital and ask for help. They have one of the best mental health facilities in Ontario, maybe Canada. They are leaders in mental health and have both in-patient and out-patient programs at a couple locations specifically to help people like you. You aren't alone, this is why these programs exist.

Killing yourself is a permanent solution to temporary problems, OP.

canadaguns,3cit2n,mwmwmwmwmmdw,0,Thu Jul 9 07:34:50 2015 UTC,If you look at the bc law site now the line with the exemption is no longer there for PAL holders.  I don't know when this was removed but a 2011 version has it and the 2015 version does not.  EDIT: After much research...  Body Armour Control Act of British Columbia Section 2(3)(c) says that if you are exempt under regulations you are good to go. (This USED TO SAY if you are a PAL holder you are exempt)  Section 22 (2)(g) which covers regulations says that the Lieutenant governor can make a regulation about who is exempt.  Regulation 466/2010 as ordered by the Lieutenant governor makes PAL holders exempt.  TL:DR This means is that you are exempt as a PAL holder....  unless a new regulation is made to change that.
canadaguns,3cit2n,No6655321,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:12:33 2015 UTC,According to http://www.pssg.gov.bc.ca/body-armour/possess.htm  a PAL still works.

The line that used to be for PAL holders is Section 2 (3)(c) which was changed to read ""is exempt under the regulations.""  Without stipulating what regulations it refers.  Searching the firearms act of Canada which is linked on the page you posted does not turn up any results for the word Armour.  Either way if you can find it I would love that.  I was looking up the legality a few weeks ago and found this piece of legislation.  It was dated for 2011 (I think) so I looked for the most recent version and found that the line had changed.   I've had no luck finding anything further on this.  So I can only assume the site isn't up-to-date with current legislation but I do hope I'm wrong."

canadaguns,3cit2n,CheeseNBacon2,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:08:54 2015 UTC,That's the one from 2010 I was refering to that got changed (see top right corner).  But as you'll see in my other comments I found the regulation that it refers to in the updated version... it's so frustrating how our laws work sometimes.  This one is annoying too because it can just suddenly change without debate with the way it is now worded.
canadaguns,3cit2n,No6655321,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:18:01 2015 UTC,"That's not the old Act though.  The Act and the Regulations are separate documents.  The one you posted elsewhere is the same document I posted, just in PDF form.  Look at the top of that one, it says ""Approved Jun 24, 2010"". Scroll down to Schedule 2 Definition and Interpretation and compare it to the one I posted.  They're the same document, a separate document from the Act, not an old version of the Act.  The Act may have been updated and changed, but the regulation it references is still the same one and still in effect."
canadaguns,3cit2n,CheeseNBacon2,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:35:12 2015 UTC,Yes the regulation is the same one that was used to put the act into effect.   That's why it says 2010. That's the 466/2010.  The body armour regulation act is the one that has the 2015 date but still references the original regulation.  So it just looks like the act was updated but the regulation is the same.     Which is what I'm saying is annoying.  It was hard to find and can easily be changed compared to how it originally was.
canadaguns,3cit2n,No6655321,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:43:40 2015 UTC,"I feel like we're going around in circles here (which Canadian laws seem to do a lot).  But to recap, I posted a link to the Regs, which you replied to saying:   That's the one from 2010 I was refering to that got changed (see top right corner).  But as you'll see in my other comments I found the regulation that it refers to in the updated version   which you posted as a PDF in the other comment.  The thing is, that PDF is the exact same document I posted, just in PDF form, and it hasn't been changed.  The Act will have always referenced the Regulations.  'Act' and 'Regulations' aren't interchangeable terms.  One doesn't replace the other or anything, Acts usually have accompanying Regulations.  Like with pollution.  The Act may say that pollution has to be limited, it then specifies the governing agency and regulation.  The governing agency then develops the regulations which specifies the actual specific limit.     In fact I don't think the Act has changed.  Looking at the Table of Legislative Changes for the Act http://www.bclaws.ca/civix/document/id/complete/statreg/E2tlc09024 shows the only changes made since 2010 are to section 13: Offenses, not the Exemptions section.  You may just be remembering the Regulations, which it seems the PAL exemption has always been on.  Further, the 2015 date you are referring to doesn't say it was updated 2015, it says it is up to date as of June 17, 2015, which is probably when they updated everything after the legislative assembly went out of session in May. It's just saying it's as up to date as it can be, not necessarily that any changes have been made."

Do you want to hunt ducks and geese? Maybe hunt deer or bears in close? Shoot clays? Be some kind of tacti-cool range ninja?  Figure that out first, then go shopping.   Now everyone here likes to piss and moan about the current 870s, but I have bought two in the past 6 years and they're fine.  My friend bought an 870 and it is also just fine.  None of the guns like cheap #7 1/2 target load, but that's an ammo problem not a gun problem.  They do have a shitty phosphate finish on them, so they need to be cleaned and oiled before storage.  But that's not a big deal."

It came with 3 barrels (28"", 24"" with a XX choke, and a 24"" rifled cantilever barrel), and a set of 3 chokes, and I picked it up for under $500 on sale at sail. My cousin also has a weatherby PA-08 and he loves it. I can't comment on the winchester though.  Edit: I have thought about and tried to sell my mossberg 500 combo in the past, but never could get around to letting it go. It also has Realtree AP camo on it with a synthetic stock if that's your thing. I figure if I wanted wood furniture I'd get myself a Beretta Silver Pidgeon in the future or something."

canadaguns,3cgvbz,canucklurker,2,Wed Jul 8 02:24:52 2015 UTC,"Also throwing this out there since no one has brought it up yet, Benelli offers a very respectable firearm in its Nova line, however you will essentially not modify it any way since there are practically no aftermarket parts for it. Which in my opinion, is just fine, however even barrel swaps are expensive, as in, you may as well buy a second nova if you want a different barrel length/choke/contour."
canadaguns,3cgvbz,KdF-wagen,2,Tue Jul 7 20:59:23 2015 UTC,"Don't buy new production Remington, they suck. Look up ""Freedom Group Remington problems"" if you want more info.  Mossberg is solid, I'd go with this combo if you don't feel like spending too much. But I have to ask, why? Why the combo? Unless you live in an area that restricts rifle use for hunting or target shooting, the rifled barrel is going to be useless to you. Shotgun slug guns are nowhere near as accurate as rifles, the ammo is sometimes more expensive than rifle ammo, and unless you have to for legal reasons you will have no reason to use your rifled shotgun barrel.   If the Mossberg combo is the one with the 18.5"" security barrel and the 28"" vent rib, I would still just get a single 28"" vent rib barrel model, since those have removable chokes and the long barrel in the combo as a fixed Modified choke. You can buy a short barrel on it's own new or used.  If you feel like dropping more money on a similar quality shotgun, the Winchesters are good. Keep in mind that there is less aftermarket part support for the Winchesters, but they are slowly getting more stuff made for them.   If at the end of the day you want the ability to swap and use a large number of set-ups and types of parts, the Mossberg will be much better suited to your needs.  Or you could just post an ad on /r/canadagunsEE for an old Remington 870 Wingmaster and pimp that out :)"
canadaguns,3cgvbz,canucklurker,2,Tue Jul 7 20:45:17 2015 UTC,Thanks for letting me know about the remington!

If you plan on tinkering and changing parts out grab an 870.  The barrel combo's are great and if you end up not using them you can usually sell the extra barrels and break even or come out ahead.  If you have a rifle I'd skip the rifled slug barrel unless you are in a shotgun only hunting area.

Works like a champ, no issues at all other than it was a bit tight when I first got it, but shooting it a fair bit loosened things up so it's very comfortable now.  IMHO, a rifled bore is unnecessary unless you plan to spend a fair bit of time hunting big game with slugs.  For regular use, it's not practical, and ammo is more expensive.  I picked up a 2 barrel 500 combo, a shorter 18.5"" cylinder bore for indoor range fun, and a longer 28"" modified choke that is fine for clays and game.

While I was working at my LGS I saw way too many issues with new purchase 870s to want to recommend them to anyone. Failure to extract, broken ejectors, fail to feed... Certainly hunt ruining when after your first shot you can't open the action due to a stuck shell.  Sabotted slugs are more spendy than your standard rifled slugs, but do have more accuracy. If you are in an area which is shotgun only for big game, having that rifled barrel is certainly a solid way to go. I know Southern Manitoba, just outside of Winnipeg, this is the only way to hunt besides archery for white-tail."

canadaguns,3chffb,AltC,27,Wed Jul 8 13:54:37 2015 UTC,"Morality and/or fear of being arrested is what stops people.   There's no individualized serial number on each pill of oxycodone.  Clearly, someone could get a justified prescription for it, then, sell the pills to street junkies for huge profits, the police would never be able to trace its source. What stops people from doing this?    We live in a world where a certain amount of freedom is expected. That you assume most people will follow the law, and if they don't, they will be punished an made an example of. To have it any other way would make it sort of like a prison. Think; if I'm in a prison work program and want to use a screw driver, I have to sign it out under supervision, returning it after. In the interest of everyone's safety, because as an inmate, I have proven I did something to break my rights to freedoms. Some politicians want this with guns. The difference is, we did not do anything to prove we do not deserve these rights. In fact, we have jumped though hopes as legal gun owners to prove we are trustworthy citizens. The assumption here is, we ""might"" do something bad. But in that case, when you buy a new car, we would have to put breathalyzers in them, because you might drink and drive, and a lot of people are killed each you by that.  Edit: to add to the point  It's easy to say, the long gun registry was not that big of a nuisance, and helped with safety. The reason we as a society should fight things like the long gun registry. Is it's a stepping stone down a never ending slope. You need to at some point say no, that's enough. Though it may sound outlandish, it's true, that you would go from one registry to another, taking away a few more rights each time, using the last registry as its justification. Well fire arms should be registered, for safety, then all a sudden pellet guns are ""close enough"". Then, large hunting knifes should need a license to acquire.. It would be over a long time, but you would slowly but surely see more and more things become regulated in the interest of public safety. Like my example of having to instal a breathalyzer in your car, for the sake of public safety"

Oxy is a hugely destructive drug, but I feel like criminals having easy access to what should be legally owned firearms is a much bigger deal.   I see your point. A firearm used in a crime can be traced back to the store it was purchased, and to who bought it -- until the serial number is sanded off. If not, its still too late, after the damage is hypothetically done though.  That being said, both problems need fixing. What do you suggest?"
canadaguns,3chffb,Trevyp0042,8,Tue Jul 7 23:09:03 2015 UTC,"What can we do?

canadaguns,3chffb,achwas,4,Thu Jul 9 04:52:22 2015 UTC,"Laws cannot be used to stop a thing. You can make the laws as onerous as you want, the penalty as harsh as you want, it will never stop anything. It will probably reduce it, at least if it's a decently well crafted law that is actually needed. But not even the best law can outright stop something.  The only way to actually stop things you don't like is through society itself and social change to address the problem at the root. Why do so many people get addicted to drugs? Why do they do this thing that is so destructive? Obviously it's not simply because they're available. There are lots of dangerous things that are widely available and people don't abuse them at all.  Do I have the answer? Of course I don't, if I did have the answer I'm sure I'd be a very popular guy. Many things have been tried, social support, education, economic (dis)incentives, but the one thing we always seem unwilling to accept is that it may simply take time, either alone or in combination with the other efforts. And our level of commitment to those efforts is also rather questionable, and if they are inadequately pursued it will serve only to draw the problem out further. Laws may help in limiting the damage in the meantime, but they will never truly solve the problem."
canadaguns,3chffb,anti-apostle,3,Wed Jul 8 01:56:00 2015 UTC,"What makes you say criminals have easy access to legally owned firearms? For a criminal to buy a firearm without a license, there needs to be a firearms owner WITH a license willing to sell it. In other words, the first owner needs to be a criminal himself. To get the license, a background check as well as reference check is conducted, so at that point there is proof that this person is NOT a criminal. Why would you assume that such a person would suddenly take on a life of crime?  By that logic you might as well ask what stops me from robbing a liquor store myself. The answer is that I am a law abiding citizen. Unlike most of the population, that fact has been verified via background checks numerous times including when I became a firearms owner. We are statistically LESS likely to commit crime than the unlicensed rest of the population.   Rather than arguing for a long gun registry to be re introduced, after it has already proven itself to be both useless and expensive, how about we introduce licensing and background checks for other things that are being used in crime? Maybe a federal kitchen knife safety course? Didn't think so.."
canadaguns,3chffb,Krazee9,3,Wed Jul 8 01:29:54 2015 UTC,"the answer isn't penalizing those who buy/sell/and own firearms legally, the only solution is to make the consequences outweigh the potential gains; and the only way to do that is stiff penalties for anyone who circumvents the law.   The cases of people doing this are somewhat isolated because of the current penalties in place, and some of those are actually a bit lax. beyond firearms, committing a crime with ANY weapon could hold a more serious sentence so that the end of line criminal has reason to avoid weapons.   Of coarse crime is often a vice of desperation, and always of poor judgement, so there needs to be the additional deterrent for anyone who obtained a license for scrupulous reasons. Even a single occurrence of enabling violent crime should be treated as seriously as any potential crime that could be committed as consequence.   if selling a firearm to someone without a license would automatically land you a sentence equivalent to a murder charge, the cost of taking the risk would go up to the point that cost would outweigh benefit to the criminal.   Although I have entertained the question posed, it is important to realize that it is rare. the added cost of taking such risks means that firearms illegally obtained by other means ( burglary mainly) are cheaper to obtain for someone who wants to do bad things"

I Just recall reading an article that stated something to the effect of; the majority of handguns recovered, that were used in crimes had made their way across the border, but with the remaining minority and the majority of long guns being of domestic origins, that the majority of all recovered guns were stolen or ""lost"".

Creative monkeys will always find a way: when guns are banned it seems to me that criminals simply import or manufacture more guns. while there are some studies that suggest a correlating reduction in gun crime, there are also many studies that suggest no correlation between the laws restricting firearms, and a reduction in crime. In fact, in Canada I thought it was the opposite: gun crime dropped after the registry was dropped (there is no correlation?)"

The gun registry didn't put a physical barrier in place that stops straw buyers or selling to unlicensed people. The gun registry was simply useless if a firearm wasn't registered to begin with. The vast majority of firearms that are used in crimes were never registered to begin with, or are smuggled in, or stolen. So you have a very expensive tool, that doesn't physically stop crime, is ineffective at best because it targets the wrong firearms and people...oh and also was massively over budget.  TL;DR: If someone is intent on selling a firearm illegally, the registry wouldn't stop it"
canadaguns,3chffb,TheCapedMoosesader,4,Wed Jul 8 00:30:34 2015 UTC,"Although possible, this kind of crime is pretty unlikely to occur on a large scale when you consider the whole situation of illegal firearms.    Non restricted firearms are not practical for criminals. They're nearly impossible to conceal and transport discretely.  Individuals who can purchase non restricted firearms have passed a background check and are less likely to commit crimes (such as selling a firearm to someone who cannot legally posses it). You may assume a financial incentive exists for people to sell non restricted firearms illegally, but in reality this is either minimal or non existent. Restricted black market guns don't sell for exorbitant prices, so no logical reason exists for a criminal to offer multiple times the market value of a non restricted firearm to persuade a seller.  We can safely assume that the potential customer base for illegal firearms in Canada is limited, and this would be especially true for long guns with minimal criminal application.  The limited market and low potential profit for firearms of this type would require a regular flow of transactions to yield any notable profit. The resulting exposure significantly increases the chances of being caught by law enforcement.   Considering the entire situation (consequences of selling guns illegally, minimal profit potential for firearms of this type, undesirable nature of these firearms to criminals etc etc) its pretty unlikely to occur on a large scale. There are just too many more feasible crimes for some shithead who wakes up one day and decides to become a criminal."

For $239.99 shipped to my door I could not be more ecstatic. The wood furniture is gorgeous. The metal is a bit rough but appears to be very functional. Arrived packaged in a ton of oil (cosmoline?). Almost looked like a quality heirloom gun right out of the box. I must have fingered the thing for a solid half hour with the dumbest smile on my face. Can't wait to take it to the range!

Obviously they started a brush fire, luckily it only burnt a couple hundred acres. The RCMP found the guys trying to stomp out fire when it first started, unspent tracers and all.

canadaguns,3cdm81,phantom_purple7,7,Tue Jul 7 17:56:47 2015 UTC,I don't even know how this could happen unless he was shooting binary or something. Or just dropped a lit cigarette.
canadaguns,3cdm81,Devious17,11,Tue Jul 7 03:06:28 2015 UTC,"Bullets can cause sparking if they hit a steel target, or rocks behind the targets, gravel, etc."
canadaguns,3cdm81,diablo_man,3,Tue Jul 7 03:13:03 2015 UTC,Only if shooting steel core ammo though (which applies to a lot of the surplus ammo).  Lead and copper won't cause sparks.
canadaguns,3cdm81,achwas,3,Tue Jul 7 04:06:03 2015 UTC,Wrong. All it takes is an off chance so dont be so cavalier. Ive seen copper jacket fmj spark off steel regularly. Youve got a lot of kinetic energy here and so much as a divoted plate can produce the highspeed shrapnel to make sparks and fire.
canadaguns,3cdm81,Cheese_Bits,1 point,Tue Jul 7 13:22:56 2015 UTC,"Saw a .410 do it once. Person had a coke can, filled it full of gravel and was tossing it for the .410 to shoot, and one direct hit actually set the can on fire, visible flames and everything for a bit going on after it hit the ground for a few seconds."
canadaguns,3cdm81,diablo_man,2,Tue Jul 7 04:30:56 2015 UTC,"I can't wrap my head around the circumstances that allowed this to happen. Steel shot .410 is like unicorns, plus there's nothing flammable in your typical coke can/gravel combo.   This must have been like the ultimate freak occurrence, like the gravel happened to have a bit of oil spilled on it, and contained just the right kind of rocks that when they all jumbled up upon being hit with the shot, they sparked against each other."

canadaguns,3cdm81,Cheese_Bits,3,Tue Jul 7 03:36:50 2015 UTC,"There's lots of ways it can happen. Seen it lots at work. Tracer rounds are quite obvious, of course (and man have they ever started a lot of fires on ranges I've worked). Steel core would be next, but any projectile hitting a rock, or a steel target frame can start one. Trust me, working the butts I've put enough of them out over a lifetime in the army."
canadaguns,3cdm81,Ibmeister,1 point,Tue Jul 7 04:16:08 2015 UTC,"What's the difference between ""steel core"" and ""fmj""?"
canadaguns,3cdm81,mintychips,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:35:17 2015 UTC,"Google it up. Steel core is just that, the core of the bullet is made from steel instead of lead (or some other metal, like brass, etc.). They're made this way for better penetration. Fmj is a bullet made with a lead core but has another metal covering it, often times copper or brass."
canadaguns,3cdm81,Ibmeister,-1,Fri Jul 10 17:17:20 2015 UTC,I know withe tracers it is obvious but they are illegal. Steel core also would make sense. But I really didn't think copper/lead would cause many sparks hitting a rock but I guess it doesn't take much.
canadaguns,3cdm81,Devious17,3,Tue Jul 7 11:49:32 2015 UTC,"Tracer ammo is legal in Canada. From what I understand it's a no go for hunting, and your range may not allow it."
canadaguns,3cdm81,Ibmeister,-1,Tue Jul 7 12:16:17 2015 UTC,It is a very weird law anything incendiary is illegal but i guess you can still get them according to some Google fu but they appear to be very rare and hard to obtain.
canadaguns,3cdm81,Devious17,2,Tue Jul 7 12:29:27 2015 UTC,"No, thats not how the law works either. You cannot summarize laws like that.     Any projectile that is designed, manufactured or altered to ignite on impact, where the projectile is designed for use in or in conjunction with a cartridge and does not exceed 15 mm in diameter.    So phosphorus bullets that light whule in the air are legal, while incendiaries that light on or shortly after impact are illegal. This also means flares and tracers are legal as are other strange things like odd shotgun rounds excepting exploding rounds and flechettes as stipulated as prohibited in part 3 and 4."
canadaguns,3cdm81,Cheese_Bits,2,Tue Jul 7 13:42:25 2015 UTC,My mistake obviously it's been a while since I read that law. And I didn't have time at work to pull it up. Either way the things are almost impossible to find.

canadaguns,3cdm81,freewave,1 point,Tue Jul 7 04:40:01 2015 UTC,Just to be clear. What I saw on global was a cop said shots were reported in the vicinity of where a fire was later started. Unless something has changed they were making the assumption that the two things were related. I never expect unbiased opinions from a cop when it comes to civilian gun owners.

canadaguns,3cdpp7,wic99,2,Tue Jul 7 16:59:20 2015 UTC,Don't. If you want irons get a set that will go on the rail.  The wartak is a much better rail because it is stiff due to the lack of cut out and it is pretty thick.  Remember the rail will also act as a shell deflector. The rigidity also helps with keeping zero as it won't twist or flex

Later a muzzle flash is added in post-production.   Lately what pissed me off was Banshee. Decent show, full of guns, good cinematography. They'd usually get gun stuff right enough that I wouldn't notice that something was wrong, but during a few episodes it all went out the window and the muzzle flash was obviously CG, no moving actions, no spent brass, huge mags, etc."

canadaguns,3cbcju,alkali_feldspar,2,Tue Jul 7 02:06:15 2015 UTC,This is what is involved:   Turn the barrel down on a lathe until it's the right diameter for the threading die. Undercut where the threads end. Chamfer the end of the barrel. Use die to thread barrel. Re-finish barrel to prevent corrosion.   Unless you have the right tooling you'll need to find a gunsmith that can do this. I know someone who got a brake installed on their browning by Corlane's in Dawson Creek. They did it in about an hour and it looks great.
canadaguns,3cbcju,alkali_feldspar,2,Mon Jul 6 16:26:26 2015 UTC,great thanks for the reply. Corlane's is in BC I'll need to find one around me I guess.

canadaguns,3c9a5r,DISKFIGHTER2,6,Mon Jul 6 05:19:53 2015 UTC,"Having a PAL doesn't automatically mean you're adequately trained. The only officers that use the MP5 or the UMP are the special units like Toronto's ETF or any other SWAT and believe me, if anyone on a police force has the adequate training for it, it's those units in particular. A little plastic card doesn't mean anything when they have the training that they have and in fact I personally trust a member of the ETF with an MP5 more than the hunter with a PAL and a .308. A PAL, for the most part, ensures you're not a criminal more-so than proving competency with a firearm. Those who have their PAL here can attest to how simple the written and practical portions of the test are."

Fortunately, I got it on sale. So, I will probably send it in for warranty and then sell it for more than I bought it for or keep it for a later build.  I also think I will get another, shorter bipod as the one on it is a little long. I'm thinking a 6-9 extendable one and possibly a bottom-mount picatinny rail.

canadaguns,3c8yve,antikhaos,1 point,Mon Jul 6 11:32:49 2015 UTC,"Most of the brakes/hiders just push on via the three ""splines"", the castle nut is the only part the screws onto the threads. Like the original GI, Smith or Springfield ones. That's basically what I'm looking for, just it seems they are almost all only available in the States and either will not ship to Canada or the shipping is insane."

With wedding stuff depleting most funds,ijust barley scraped enough together to buy it when I saw it posted on cgn with little description and no pics.  I have a 1943 Izzy,from the 2012 Tulsky (tula) export. Scope number was ground off (can still see a 1 & 0 from old number) and not replaced with a new number.  This has been confirmed 100% legit refurb sniper by cgn and gunboards members.   All (force) machine except bolt and buttplate.  Scope mount matches scope, and it has ugly molot Tulsky export marks.  So far I have had it out once.  It was difficult to figure out how to use the adjustment screws on the Mount, but once I did I got it sighted in and shooting very nice almost one hole groups at 50yards.  Scope mount screws came loose as I was taking it out to 100 so I lost zero.  Didn't have loctite in my range bag so I will try it again next weekend.  Super impressed with this. Scope takes some getting used to, but the bent bolt is excellent and it is the nicest mosin trigger I have ever felt.  Stock it rivals a Finnish mosin trigger.

A couple guys in town who've spent too much money on their SKSs never got them to work right since, they both sold theirs and no longer SKS.  Changed to mag and they quit feeding right, changed stock to synth and they began to jam.  I kept mine bone stock, I might add a low power scope but that's it (DO NOT get the cover mount, look up S&K or westrifle has a decent looking mount where the rear sight goes), it works right every time and is cheap to feed.  That being said, if you want to spend more money than it originally cost and lots of time to perfect it, you can do loads with it! Perhaps find someone who bubba'd theirs and is selling it (because it no longer works right) so you get two or three items for cheap in a bundle and then work out the kinks the last guy didn't have the guts for.  If you can get an older one and a newer one you can make a best of both worlds SKS, the older ones (my bud's '51 for example) have chromed firing pin blocks but not chrome lined barrels, the newer ones are the opposite. Not that a chromed block means much, but bonus points are bonus points, unless matching numbers is a thing for you like they are for me.

As you said, this is tough for some to talk about, and well, this is precisely what an internet forum is designed for, so let's all bring to the table as many constructive and informative points as we can. Incoming rant.   How do we convince Mulcair to guarantee us that he will not compel his MPs to vote within party lines about gun issues?   Maybe I'm just in a more down kind of place, but I think the answer here is, we don't. I may be thinking along the lines of an extremist right now, but hear me out. I truly feel like we are reliant on a system that is out of reach and out of our control. When the system, at it's core, is populated by politicians who can NOT see a day past their own rise to power, you're left with a system that accommodates just that; rises to power, instead of honest-to-goodness change for the good of the people. I see the USofA struggling with this even worse than us, every day.  So, what happens until the general population refuses to stand by until it becomes ""too much""? Nothing. Nothing happens. A few good people stand up and write (hopefully) well-worded and insightful letters to the right people, but the vast majority (myself shamefully included) stand by and do nothing, until a violent revolt is finally required. I feel like those times when the people are united together in the streets are the only times we can ever get something done, the only times the very few people with very-nearly all the power actually raise their heads and listen.  So what do we do? How can we promote growth? We know how, but it's not working. Revolting in the streets would also be a very obviously flawed approach, so what is it exactly that we can do to fix our system now? FYI I'm not really talking about guns here anymore either, though the subject is certainly relevant.  I'm not sure if I'm actually asking you guys these questions or simply voicing my already-realized concerns, but at least it's some food for thought. I could go on for days about how Humans are what we are because of competition, and how that has been great for our individual survival thus far, but where does that leave us when we are now past the need to be so virulently self-centred?"

Hell, my MP is Elizabeth May, and judging by how much people around here love her, she'll be getting back in.  I did lighting for a Green Party rally recently (it's my job and was fun!) and actually got to talk to some of the campaigners about their stance on firearms. They pretty much stuck to party lines but a couple of them acknowledged that some of it didn't realistically make sense (specifically the semi-auto ban and reinstatement of the registry). This is either a good middle ground or just more typical waffling from the Greens, who knows.   It sucks that I have to consider firearms as part of my voting choice.

Many rural Canadians and First Nations people find the restrictions onerous and discriminatory. We need to better balance these interests without allowing guns to be prevalent in society.  Our Vision  The Green Party understands that it is time to get tough on gun smuggling across the U.S. border. Thousands of handguns are coming across the border and into our urban centres. We need to work with each of the US border states to press for action against gun smugglers and investment in tougher border measures to halt the movement of illegal firearms.  The risks created by having dangerous weapons in our urban centres are significant. We will introduce balanced and fair measures to ban handguns and semi-automatic firearms. However, the use of guns in our urban centres is typically not the same as the use of guns in our rural communities. We will ensure that law-abiding citizens pursuing legal activities in hunting with long guns are free from unreasonable fees and the threat of criminalization. The Green Party will keep the gun registry, but reduce the paperwork and bureaucratic burden for rural use, and for hunters and marksmen with no criminal history.  Green Solutions  Green Party MPs will: Provide increased support for Integrated Border Enforcement Teams made up of officers from the RCMP, Canada Border Services, U.S. Customs and the U.S. Coast Guard in their gathering of intelligence and arresting of gun smugglers.  Put strict measures in place for those who attempt to cross the Canada/U.S. border with illegal firearms. Ensure that gun smuggling is prosecuted as a gun crime of the highest order rather than as a customs violation. Fulfill Canada's obligation under international agreements (United Nations Firearms Protocol and the Organization of American States Firearms Convention) to mark all imported firearms, as recommended by the Canadian Association of Police Boards and the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police.  Ensure that gun crime charges are not dropped to facilitate convictions on lesser charges.  Work hard to create a registration system that is fair, free, and easy to use. We support the elimination of registration fees for hunting rifles and will ensure law-abiding citizens do not have their firearms confiscated.  Ban handguns and combat weapons including semi-automatic rifles and assault rifles. Eliminate their use through consultation and a full buy-back program. Consult especially with holders of collections to ensure guns are rendered non-functional to eliminate usefulness to thieves, and with target shooters to establish safe and protected locations where target shooting can be practiced. Streamline the gun registry in consultation with First Nations, and with gun sports and hunter organizations. Ensure the registration system is fair for all users.  (emphasis mine)"

We have had terrorist attacks in Canada.  We have had several plots foiled by the RCMP. We have Canadians traveling to conflict zones to engage in terrorism.  This is not an issue?  Lone wolf and small coordinated terrorist attacks on Canada is a very real threat to public safety and national security. This should be plain as day to anyone who looks at the issue.  Mulcair wants to pass the ottawa shooter off as some drug addict with mental health issues and Khadar as some victim of being a child soldier.  This couldn't be further from the truth.  The Ottawa shooter was a lone wolf terrorist motivated by a religious ideology.  Khadar was a full on terrorist engaged in combat action against our allies.  Was he shooting at Canadians? I'm sure if he had the chance he would have.  That's treason.    So what's the NDP's plan to deal with very real threat of terrorists and traitors?  $15 daycare and legal weed?  Fuck that.    Mike Harris anyone?   Roll your watch back a bit further.  Do you know how Mike Harris got elected?  Because of Bob Rae's NDP nearly bankrupted the province.  Are you old enough to remember their 'Social Contract' bullshit?   Then there's the NDP in British Columbia:  The Fudge-it Budget, where they just cooked the books to make it look like they were balanced.  Fast Cat Ferries, where the government tried to create an aluminium ship building industry by building three horribly designed ferries and lost hundreds of millions of dollars.  Bingo-gate, where the NDP out and out stole money from charity bingo games. Tuition freezes for post secondary, but no money in the education budgets to supplement the lost in funds for schools, so they all fell into disrepair.  The decimation of our Forestry industry, which was a completely renewable resource providing thousands of jobs, all gone under the NDP's watch.  The NDP is a HORRIBLE party to run the country.  They've shown quite well how bad a job they do.  But people never learn and get swooned with all their sexy promises and grand visions.  Then the NDP gets in to power, everything goes to shit, and people oust them in favor of either a Liberal or Conservative party.  Just wait for Alberta to sink in to the mire with the NDP's ineptness.  Then, there's the GUN issue, which is relevant to this sub.

canadaguns,3c2oqa,Skabeezy,1 point,Sun Jul 5 00:12:54 2015 UTC,"Domestic terrorism is a HUGE issue   No one said it isn't. The problem with your examples and specifically about the debate over whether or not Zehaf-Bibeau was a terrorist or a ""drug addict with mental health issues"" is one of semantics. He might have been a terrorist by the definition of terrorist, but whether it's convenient for your argument or not, he had mental health issues. The bottom line is that his motivation for shooting up the Hill has been over-politicized and frankly has no place in my deliberations about which MP to vote for. You want to give CSIS more resources to ""foil terror plots""? Sure, but don't compromise my fundamental freedoms in doing so. What was that Benjamin Franklin quote? ""Those who give up their liberty for more security neither deserve liberty nor security."" We on /r/canadaguns argue the same god damn thing day in and day out - it's more than a little hypocritical to support the Conservatives or the Liberals policies on domestic terrorism after pulling a stunt like supporting C-51.   Khadar was a full on terrorist engaged in combat action against our allies. Was he shooting at Canadians? I'm sure if he had the chance he would have. That's treason.   I have argued the same position as yours, specifically against the early release of Khadr in many other threads, specifically on /r/Canada; so don't feed me that bullshit line about taking my ""schtick"" back there. My view on Khadr is in line with American authorities and I believe he should be serving the full term to which he was sentenced - but that is not an opinion with which I require my preferred candidate to be congruent - especially considering that it was a Canadian judge who decided to grant him freedom on the basis of his likelihood to re-offend.    So what's the NDP's plan to deal with very real threat of terrorists and traitors? $15 daycare and legal weed? Fuck that.   Really? Are your political ideologies that disjointed from reality? No, it can't possibly be that bad. I'll give you the benefit of the doubt on this little doozy and chalk it up to an emotional outburst.   Do you know how Mike Harris got elected? Because of Bob Rae's NDP nearly bankrupted the province. Are you old enough to remember their 'Social Contract' bullshit?   Bob Rae? Really? You're going to bring up the most antithetical example of the NDP and label it as justification for not voting NDP? It's well known (albeit not in circles wherein grumpy social Conservatives plagiarize Harper's talking-points handbook) that Bob Rae inherited the province during a deep recession and took drastic actions against unions in an almost universally unpopular move toward austerity. You want to talk about the ""Social Contract bullshit?"" I give you Tim Hudak's platform for Ontario, had he been elected Premier in the last election: ""Lower business tax and cut 100,000 public service jobs."" Yeah, no joke, he actually had the balls to say that, and defend it. We learned from Harris's time in office that lowering taxes does not work- this trickle-down economic bullshit that people keep perpetuating is infuriating. It's also worth noting that Rae was a Liberal before & after his tenure with the NDP and completely alienated his voter base while in office. Why did Mike Harris get elected? Because he rode in on the coattails of an economic recovery, promising economic reform and low taxes as a method to lessen the deficit. What did we get instead? A stunted recovery of our economy, a massive attempted selloff of provincial assets (succeeding in the epic blunder that is the 407, which will end up costing the province tens of billions in lost revenue) and increased poverty/homelessness- to name a few. I do not know much about what happened in B.C. because I haven't done much reading into it, but judging by your misrepresentation of basically every other factoid in this debate, I'm sure I'll find it engrossing.    But people never learn and get swooned with all their sexy promises and grand visions. Then the NDP gets in to power, everything goes to shit, and people oust them in favor of either a Liberal or Conservative party.   This is the definition of every change in government. If someone never fucks up or becomes unpopular, they won't get voted out. Politics is cyclical, and the hilarious idea that you are attributing this phenomena solely to the NDP is indicative of your ingrained bias and it does nothing to help. Nevertheless, this is all verbose. Arguing past failures in governance is not a means to achieving an amicable solution for the future. I do not condemn Harper's PCs because of Harris, Nor do I condemn Notely for the actions of Rae. I judge candidates not by the colour of their campaign signs, but by their actions, their words and their own voting histories. The fact that I'm willing to post this controversial of a thread in an otherwise staunchly conservative sub and come prepared to defend my political position should convince you that I'm not just some lost soul, a bleeding-heart socialist intellectual without a clue.    Then, there's the GUN issue, which is relevant to this sub. It goes without saying that The NDP is the WORST party for gun owners in Canada.   The one fractional slice of your comment that is even remotely relevant to the discussion, and you're still missing the entire point of the thread. This thread isn't for you. ""an NDP or Liberal majority might even lead to more gun control legislation. If the buck stops there for you and/or you're a single-issue voter, the choice is simple.

It's also not just about firearm ownership it is about responsible representation. The LGR was dismantled because it had zero support in rural areas, it cost the government shitloads of money, all while doing nothing to prevent gun crime. Then Muclair says he wants it back. That tells me he isn't listening to Canadians, he isn't learning from history, and that his own personal moral beliefs outweigh the wishes of the citizens he represents. Wait, am I talking about Harper or Muclair?  Also, another big gripe I have is straight from the NDP policy book. Go to their website and look through it. On page 15, point 3.9 (I) states the following: Decriminalizing marijuana possession with the goal of removing its production and distribution from the control of organized crime. Like....what? How in the world is decriminlization supposed to take production and distribution out of the hands of organized crime? It doesn't. That is the stupidest statement in the world. The only way to take production and distribution out of the hand of criminals is to legalize the prodcution and distribution of marijuana.   https://www.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/35bg3c/dear_justin_trudeau_regarding_your_support_for/cr33u12"

Whether or not it's the right thing to do, I'd really not like to lose funding in healthcare, but I also like defense spending.

It's about time someone starts using a bit of common sense instead of emotion to determine our gun laws and which guns can be owned by law abiding citizens.  The sheer stupidity and ignorance involved in the laws as they stand would be humorous if it didn't affect all of us so negatively.

Pretty much everything beyond that is unnecessary bullshit.
canadaguns,3bz88b,VentCo,2,Sat Jul 4 03:49:01 2015 UTC,Same. I would even venture to say that allowing unpinned mags to sane people (me) should be fine. Front load the process as much as possible to keep society at large safe from the dumbasses and then just let me be.
canadaguns,3bz88b,the_blur,0,Sat Jul 4 04:29:29 2015 UTC,"That is great you're happy and I agree with everything else being bullshit but who gets to decide the content of the class and the test? How is it valid and not arbitrary? How is it not more of a burden to the poor than it is the rich that have more resources, both time and money, for it? What part of ""don't shoot at stuff that you don't want to be shot"" do you need a freaking class for? In other news, water is wet and fire is hot."
canadaguns,3bz88b,DrHappyFunTime,2,Sat Jul 4 07:51:09 2015 UTC,"It goes beyond ""don't shoot at stuff that you don't want to be shot"" though. You're taught about using proper ammunition, so you don't end up blowing your face off. You're taught muzzle discipline, so you don't end up blowing someone else face off.  This way, Johnny Dumbass knows not to jam .303 Savage ammunition into his .303 British Lee Enfield and wave it around the range ""Don't worry bro, I don't have my finger on the trigger""   And if Johnny Dumbass takes the test and fails then Johnny Dumbass doesn't get a gun licence until he understands firearm safety.   Yeah, it's all common sense, but not everyone has common sense. Every month there seems to be a post here about a police officer who manages to shoot themselves in the leg. It won't stop every incident of some idiot fucking up, but it teaches some people to not be idiots.   Besides up until now you could challenge the test, in and out.

Anyway, you didn't answer who gets to decide the content of the class/test, how it is valid, and how it is not arbitrary.

Once an idiot, always an idiot.   Okay, I'll word this differently. It teaches people what is stupid and what is not.   Anyway, you didn't answer who gets to decide the content of the class/test, how it is valid, and how it is not arbitrary.    I don't know who gets to decide, I'm sure you could look it up. I just think learning firearm safety is important before using a firearm. You know, so you don't accidently kill someone or yourself. If you think it's arbitrary then whatever, but I would hope we can all agree that we don't want anyone doing something dangerous and causing a preventable accident.    Knowing the subtle differences between all 30 caliber rounds in existence sounds pretty arbitrary to me.   I was using the .303 example because it was the one used when I took my class, it's not about knowing the differences between all the .30 calibre rounds in existence, it's about knowing what's safe and what's not. If you were a new shooter and you went to the store looking for a certain calibre of ammunition and find one with a similar name and think ""oh, it should work, it has the same numbers on it"" and stick in your gun, you're probably going to end up with a remodeled face. In the class you're taught ""only use ammunition that matches the stamp on the firearm"", and now you've learnt not to make that mistake.    Also, if Johnny doesn't have his finger on the trigger, there shouldn't be a problem. It sounds like you have more of a problem with imaginary scenarios and your feelings vs reality.   Maybe Johnny doesn't have his finger on the trigger, but maybe he's messing around the with the bolt and it slam fires in my direction. If only Johnny had been taught about slam fires, he would have known not to do that. Besides, I don't want anyone's gun waved in my face, I don't care if he says his finger's not on the trigger, or if he says it's unloaded. I'm not one to get all uppity about say ""OH YOU TOUCHED THE TRIGGER FOR A PHOTOGRAPH, DON'T POINT THAT AT THE CAMERA!! RABBLE RABBLE"" as some gun owners seem to, but seriously, just keep the gun pointed down range unless you're on your way in or out."

Im just curious how you feel they would hold up to an AR - im assuming no, they are stamped steel correct? I always get generally that older quality stuff can be of better production, especially given the ar180 american heritage for being known as 'alright'  legit question. not slamming the rifle, exceedingly rare and the only 'AR' platform non restricted in canada (and getting rarer with age)   quickly edited my valuation, they are generally 1000-1200 and not in as good condition as this seems to appear. Also note the rarity of these, thats assuming you can find one stateside. (Ive been eyeing these rifles a good while )"
canadaguns,3c0kzp,cheeri0,2,Sat Jul 4 00:54:20 2015 UTC,"I really enjoy shooting it. I have another one now that is in stock configuration that I shoot a ton. Way more than my AR-15. Compared to the AR I have (colt), it feels about the same quality level to me. I did ask my friend the same question and he said he thought the Colt was better quality because he felt the polymer lower on the 180B was cheap. So whether or not you're a fan of the lower is a matter of opinion I suppose. And yes you're correct the upper is stamped metal  Compared to something like the Colt Canada SA20, (I held one briefly at a gun store), I would say the quality is inferior. When I picked up that rifle the thing just felt super solid.  So to answer your question, I'd say it's about the same quality level as the standard ""run of the mill"" AR's. But the higher end ones easily have it beat. It really isn't all that easy to compare it directly to an AR though, because it is so different in its construction. If you buy it expecting an AR-15 you might be disappointed, because it's not an AR-15. But I really enjoy it for what it is."

canadaguns,3bzq1k,humanefly,2,Fri Jul 3 15:17:59 2015 UTC,Is that deal still on?
canadaguns,3bzq1k,Styrak,2,Fri Jul 3 19:21:50 2015 UTC,"regrettably, it's my understanding that the deal was Canada Day only. total was $1017 incl. shipping and tax. for 4,600 rounds total. It said the x39 was actually non corrosive. I sort of figured a lot of people think the CAD will drop so even if I don't use it, it will hold it's value better than my paper dollars?"
canadaguns,3bzq1k,humanefly,2,Fri Jul 3 19:52:45 2015 UTC,Pretty sweet deal. I couldn't find anyone to split it with me :( Yeah you'll be able to sell it roughly for what you've bought it for!

canadaguns,3bzq1k,humanefly,1 point,Fri Jul 3 20:14:04 2015 UTC,Ammo always increases in value.  My $320 case of Norinco 5.56 already increased by around 25% to $400ish or more in just a couple years.
canadaguns,3bzq1k,cdnmr,1 point,Fri Jul 3 20:05:48 2015 UTC,mmm my suspicion is that this may be related to the drop in CAD; the CAD has dropped @20% in the past two years. so it may not be that ammo increased in value; it may be that CAD decreased in value.
canadaguns,3bzq1k,humanefly,1 point,Fri Jul 3 20:11:17 2015 UTC,"Does it matter?  Ammo is more expensive now, across the board."
canadaguns,3bzq1k,humanefly,1 point,Fri Jul 3 20:29:25 2015 UTC,"well it might matter, in that if you think that the CAD has reason to go up instead of down; then it would make more sense to hoard CAD instead of ammo. my point is that ammo should not increase at more than inflation over the long term. It's not generally considered an investment in that over the long term, you can't profit by holding ammo. current shortages aside, I suspect that if the CAD were to go up in value against USD by 20% you would see an almost exact inverse relationship in the price of ammo"
canadaguns,3bzq1k,cdnmr,1 point,Fri Jul 3 20:39:31 2015 UTC,Ammo as an investment? Hmm...I like the way you think.  Edit: was trying to be funny.
canadaguns,3bzq1k,SilentRadar,1 point,Fri Jul 3 21:31:55 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't call it an investment! To my mind, and investment is something that you can hold, and it can be developed in order to increase value over time eg. owning stocks is owning business; ideally the business is developed and increases in value (faster than inflation). Owning real estate can be an investment, but only if you rent it out, and develop it; otherwise, when you factor in all costs/maintenance, it really only appreciates at the rate of inflation over the long term. So holding ammunition would be similar to holding gold, or cocaine, or money: I would consider it a store of value. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Store_of_value  In this particular case, I'm trying to diversify away from CAD a little; when CAD was high or near par, I bought USD in small amounts over time. CAD has dropped 20% against USD over past two years, so I'm not as interested in buying USD. Buying ammunition/firearms now instead of later, is a small hedge to protect the cost of my hobby in case CAD drops more. I'm trying to store some of the value of the CAD now before it drops later, that's all."

canadaguns,3bzaby,hakb404,17,Fri Jul 3 10:39:03 2015 UTC,"This isn't how ATIP works.  You can't take the shotgun approach and send them on a snipe hunt.You need to ask for specific things in specific ways.  First, ask for a copy of the FRT.  (I have a 4+year old copy on a disk somewhere) so you can get one too.  Just send in your $5 cheque and say ""I am requesting copies of the RCMP Firearms Reference Tables.""   You have to remember that there are THOUSANDS of guns in the FRT.  Think about every gun ever made, and all the variants and subtypes.  It's unreasonable to request information on why a gun is classified one way or another, especially since the definitions of prohibited, restricted and non-restricted firearm is already in law.  Once you have the FRTs, find the gun you want to know more about.  Probably the Blaze47.  So you make a second request that reads like ""Firearms Reference Table 12345q contains the Mossburg Blaze47.  It was published on June xx 2015.  FRT 12345q has classified this firearm as a prohibited firearm.  I am requesting any reports, analysis, pictures, video, emails, written notes, briefing notes, or other relevant information the RCMP has in its possession regarding the examination, testing and classification of this firearm.  Using ATIP is fun, and you can get all kinds of neat information using it.  There is nothing wrong with making a request, but you have to know how to make a request and be reasonable in what you're requesting."
canadaguns,3bzaby,AdiposeFin,7,Fri Jul 3 11:00:13 2015 UTC,"Thank you, this is why i posted this here,so i don't sound like a tool when i ask for a copy."
canadaguns,3bzaby,diablo_man,1 point,Fri Jul 3 11:07:07 2015 UTC,"I know you have done a number of ATIP requests, how has that gone in your experience? About how long did they take, were any not honoured or responded to?"
canadaguns,3bzaby,AdiposeFin,3,Fri Jul 3 23:16:13 2015 UTC,"I eventually get what I'm looking for.  I've done a few ATIPs for professional reasons with other Fed Gov't stuff, but the RCMP is a bit slower due to the sheer volume of requests they get.  This is why you have to be specific about what you want, and where it might be.     What happens is you send in your form and $5 cheque. Then about 3 weeks later you get a form letter from the RCMP saying they got your letter and they're looking for what you asked for, however it takes time to find it, so cool your jets.  The letter they give you also has a way to complain and demand prompt service.  I suggest to everyone to use it.  Then one day you look in your bank account and see the $5 cheque has been cashed and a few days later you get a little package in the mail with a letter from a corporal or sergeant explaining what they sent you and how to ask for more etc etc.    The whole process takes time, and you have to be very specific about what it is your looking for and you have to know its there in the first place.  So like, lets say I wanted a lab report from some fisheries scientist.  I'd send in the request for that specific report written by that specific scientist.  I can't just send in asking for reports written by the DFO about fish for the month of June 2015.  That's just not going to work.      People thinking that by sending in a form and a $5 cheque that suddenly the RCMP is going to open it's vaults of information and send in a team of researchers are barking up the wrong tree.  You have to be very specific about what you are looking for.  Asking for 'the reason why these guns are banned' is stupid an won't get you anywhere.  There's also reasons in the ATIP Act that lets them say ""Fuck you, we're not telling.""  I never put a request in for the original T97 rifles, but suspect that you would get this kind of response.  It might be worth $5 to find out for sure though.  ATIP is fun to play around with.  It's interesting to sometimes get out of context emails or see little doodles and scribbles on people's bench notes.  I had a grocery list in the corner of some lab notes once.  It was funny."
canadaguns,3bzaby,diablo_man,2,Fri Jul 3 23:43:34 2015 UTC,"Nice, thanks for the reply. So you would recommend doing the ""complain and demand prompt service"" part? I assume if you dont then your request gets shelved for an indeterminate amount of time."
canadaguns,3bzaby,AdiposeFin,2,Fri Jul 3 23:46:29 2015 UTC,"Iirc they have 30days to get you what you asked for.  You will never get it in that time, but it doesn't hurt to ask for prompt service."

We can agree that there are existing issues with reddit/administration as a whole, but given that CanadaGuns has very little to do with it, a shutdown is more likely to damage a small subreddit such as ours than anything else, we're inclined to avoid it.  Us moderators have all had differing experiences of forum administration drama before and frankly would like to avoid doing so again, especially over this topic. It would take this subreddit into the fray, where /u/Diablo_Man had intended this subreddit with every intention of avoiding that.

canadaguns,3bvsb9,jmf101,6,Thu Jul 2 18:52:07 2015 UTC,"I really like mine.  One thing I would definitely recommend is getting the FTU though.    Pros:  It's been very reliable, not picky about ammunition, it's light, easy to hold on target, very comfortable to shoot, easy to disassemble and clean, affordable.  Cons  stock aperature sights aren't great, no good optic mounting options without the FTU, controls are in weird places but easy to get used to, it's picky about magazines it likes metal ones but not plastic.  PCV beos don't work in mine, pmags need some filing, LAR and USGI work great.  Oh and not sure if its a pro or con, but it has a looong trigger pull, but it's light and consistent.  Some like that, some don't.  I personally like it. For a .223 NR black rifle, and a bullpup at that, it's definitely worth the $1k.

canadaguns,3bvsb9,DogfoodEnforcer,1 point,Thu Jul 2 23:55:54 2015 UTC,"Hmm not sure how to answer that.  Technically I did have the choice because both were available when I bought it and they cost about the same.  However a big a determining factor for me was that I'm a bullpup fan boy and that heavily swayed my decision.  I haven't ever held or fired an 858 but I have heard very good things about them.  I am hoping to buy the 958 someday (same gun but with a rail on top that should be coming out soon).   There is a lot to be said for the AR.  Tons of after market parts, mods, customization.  Tons of selection and manufacturers and available for pretty good prices.  If you only ever plan on using it at the range anyway and want something you can persoanlize AR is the way to go.  858 and T97 are pretty limited in mods you can make, but you can take em any where so... it really depends on what you want out of your gun."

However, i thought the t97 was awesome, and stanag mags is a big plus. In the end though i stuck with the cheaper ammo and more comfy, reliable rifle.

Just to add what others have said, people have complained about some of the ergonomics of the safety and mag release (I think it's supposed to be your main hand grabbing the mag).   As for mags, I heard they take most ar-15 mags and some of the polymer ones are finicky if you don't shave them down a bit. So polymer Beowulf mags might have some issues.

Also, I've noticed sometimes, that a magazine will tilt forward slightly and a round could get snagged up on the feed ramp.

Fix: Tap mags so that cartridges are seated as far back in the magazine as possible, have not had this problem since  Issue: Magwell varies between each gun. My case USGI Aluminium work best but don't drop free, LAR-15 fit well require a tug to remove, Gen 2 PVC Beo get stuck, P-Mags I have not tried.  Fix 1: File the mags down trouble spots are along the spine.  Fix 2: File/Polish the mag well. [THIS IS DIFFICULT, TIME CONSUMING, AND POSSIBLY DAMAGING]  Issue: Lefty eating brass. Fix: Attach a brass deflector. Get some aluminium bend it and attach behind ejection port with jbweld or an epoxy.  Issue: Mag release sucks. Fix: https://www.srcgunworks.com/catalog/index.php/t97-accessories/t97-right-side-mag-rel-black.html  Fix 2: Get creative (Not my content) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fih-L-vLgxM  Cheap fix: Personally I leave mine half unscrewed so its not loose but extends the release about 5mm.  Issue: Brass goes into space [May or may not also fix dented brass].  Fix: Your gas system may be set to fouled, switch to standard.  Fix 2: You can drill a hole in the gas system on the 3rd or off gas setting [again permanent].  Recommended upgrade get the FTU(Flat Top Unit) unless you have a thing for carry handles. A few retailers offer it pre-installed and they appear with FTU on the used market every one or two weeks.  The safety sucks. There is a lower hand guard in production with the first batch set to ship before the of the month. It adds a trigger safety, lower rails, better triggers (still have to deal with the take up on the action bar), lower rails, ar-15 grip compatibility (A2 style, does not work with high backstraps)  Flash hider is pinned on if you want custom brakes get a gunsmith to tap the pin out and thread it.  As for the gun itself its really fun to shoot, fairly accurate but not well suited for competition or long range accuracy.  Like others have said its remarkably well balanced. The trigger is not terrible but bullpup triggers are known for their long squishy take up. For lefties its not terrible but you do catch the occasional brass to the face mostly in cases where you are leaning in to focus on that one small target. Its the one gun in my collection that every new shooter I bring to the range wants to try out. In all its flaws I can't help but like it and I don't regret buying it at all."

canadaguns,3bwtu2,russelln,7,Thu Jul 2 20:20:35 2015 UTC,Savage Mark II is the best bang for your buck. Pretty damn accurate right out of the box and .22LR amo hasn't been too hard to find lately.
canadaguns,3bwtu2,gayguyfromcanada,4,Thu Jul 2 20:52:06 2015 UTC,This is probably what I'll end up going with. Thanks for the recommendation.
canadaguns,3bwtu2,Iamwomper,3,Thu Jul 2 22:26:36 2015 UTC,"If you are going .22, get a regular barrel, with iron sights.  Love my savage mark II but regret buying it with a scope already attached."
canadaguns,3bwtu2,daveburnt,2,Thu Jul 2 23:35:13 2015 UTC,"Shit, can you elaborate why not?   I was thinking of the scope combo to replace my ruger 10/22 w/scope. I shoot cheap 22 so i want to go back to a bolty, the ruger didn't cycle well with dirty bulk 22.  Before you get mad at me I got a swedish mauser for selling the ruger. lol"
canadaguns,3bwtu2,Iamwomper,1 point,Fri Jul 3 00:44:02 2015 UTC,"If you're looking for accuracy, get the bull barrel. But dont get a gun with a scope mounted.

canadaguns,3bwtu2,BeaverNutz,4,Fri Jul 3 20:54:23 2015 UTC,If you want 22 lr and bolt savage mark 2 or you could a 10/22 if you want a semi. If you want something centerfire and still reasonable to feed a savage axis in .223 or really any bolt .223 wouldn't be a bad option since ammo is still a reasonable price and can be had at most if not all gun stores.
canadaguns,3bwtu2,Iamwomper,3,Thu Jul 2 22:28:19 2015 UTC,"22 isn't that hard to find. I'd still recommend it, especially in that price range. A 10/22 if you want a semi, or a savage mark II if you want bolt. If you don't care about hitting things and just wanna make noise you can get an SKS in 7.62x39 too.  17hmr is neat too, but more expensive ammo. The 93R17 is the way to go there. Unless you want to spend the money on a CZ 455"
canadaguns,3bwtu2,kilikamyst,2,Thu Jul 2 20:44:22 2015 UTC,Sks can hit a deer at 100 yards. Good nuff
canadaguns,3bwtu2,BeaverNutz,1 point,Thu Jul 2 23:37:37 2015 UTC,"As long as I can get a hold of it, .22lr would be ideal. I supposed worst case scenario is that I have to order some online. Thanks."

They still had lots and had some specialty stuff such as Aguila subsonic <- Great stuff. Also if you want to get a cheap 10/22 Canadian tire has some cheap clones for 199.99, and they still take the 25 round buttler creek mags."
canadaguns,3bwtu2,alkali_feldspar,2,Thu Jul 2 22:04:53 2015 UTC,Interesting. I was at the Dartmouth crossing store last week and they seemed to be out of it.
canadaguns,3bwtu2,Rousis,1 point,Thu Jul 2 22:14:33 2015 UTC,"I've never had a problem finding 22, if you're after one brand or type in particular sometimes that can be a little trickier, but it always comes up eventually, and it's cheap enough that you can buy plenty when it does."
canadaguns,3bwtu2,alkali_feldspar,3,Thu Jul 2 21:12:25 2015 UTC,"A lot of people reccomend a 10/22 for a semi automatic .22lr, but I always say check out the Marlin 60 or Marlin 795. Less expensive than the 10/22, and a helluva lot more accurate! I own both a Marlin 60 and Savage MK 2 and reccomend both."
canadaguns,3bwtu2,Rousis,2,Thu Jul 2 21:13:01 2015 UTC,What makes the Marlin more accurate than a 10/22? I kinda doubt it's more accurate. Should be roughly the same between both guns out of the box.
canadaguns,3bwtu2,phantom_purple7,3,Thu Jul 2 21:36:27 2015 UTC,"Micro rifling in the barrel surely helps. The marlins also seem to have a much thicker barrel, and a precision crowned muzzle (crowned muzzle information off of their website). My buddy has a 10/22 so I can attest to the accuracy myself. While the 10/22 is a damn fine rifle, I found multiple times the Marlin was simply more accurate."
canadaguns,3bwtu2,Rousis,3,Thu Jul 2 21:59:11 2015 UTC,"I'd be interested to see a side by side comparison. Neither are going to be close to a MKII. With lots of parts and tinkering my 10/22 can do 1.25 MOA, but my savage is still better."
canadaguns,3bwtu2,GBU-28,2,Thu Jul 2 23:30:08 2015 UTC,"Oh no doubt. I picked up the Savage MKII F last year when it was on sale and my marlin was in the shop. Although I do need to spend a little more on a scope other than what I currently own, out to 50 yards so far its amazingly accurate. I have yet to bring it to 100 though.  As for the side by side comparison a stock 10/22 carbine vs a stock marlin 60/795 would be great."
canadaguns,3bwtu2,Rousis,1 point,Fri Jul 3 00:00:50 2015 UTC,"Yep, add a set of tech sights to the 795 and you have a very accurate and lightweight rifle for not much money."

Decent enough rifle, but if I were to do it again I would have bought a henry .22LR lever action. I love those things now and am debating if I pick one up instead of putting the cash towards the next gun on the list (which would be a pistol, NR black rifle, or big ass lever action)."

canadaguns,3bwtu2,alkali_feldspar,4,Fri Jul 3 01:53:03 2015 UTC,"I'll be the guy that everyone yells at for recomending a Mosin Nagant. As long as you're shooting surplus they are pretty soft shooting but still pack enough punch to get your freedom boner raging. Also they're cheap and will kill nearly anything. Also: bayonets are bad-ass. Check out the site sponsors on CGN for combo deals, avoid scopes and fruity after market stocks."
canadaguns,3bwtu2,alkali_feldspar,1 point,Thu Jul 2 21:19:05 2015 UTC,"Mosin's are super fun and can be good shooters but there's way too much variation between them. You may get a fine shooter or you might get one you can barely hit the target with at 100 yards, definitely add it to the list to get eventually but I just don't think they're the best starter rifle."
canadaguns,3bwtu2,ThundercockIII,2,Thu Jul 2 23:00:53 2015 UTC,"$600 will buy a Mosin, a bolt .22lr and enough ammo to get him rolling."
canadaguns,3bwtu2,ThundercockIII,2,Fri Jul 3 02:50:43 2015 UTC,"If budget is your worry, 22LR is your friend. It's not terribly hard to find, most local stores will have some and Cabalas routinely gets it in stock. Big box stores like Canadian tire or walmart seem to have stock issues, but that seems to be getting better.  As for guns, Savage MKII or Ruger 10/22 are excellent choices and within your budget.   There's not going to be much in the centerfire world within your budget that's really all the good that's not a military surplus."
canadaguns,3bwtu2,ThundercockIII,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:47:45 2015 UTC,"Alright, I'll definitely go with .22lr, and I'll have to take a closer look at a Savage mkII. thanks."
canadaguns,3bwtu2,death_hawk,2,Thu Jul 2 20:50:09 2015 UTC,"There's a lot of different variations of the MKII so you should be able to find on you like. I don't care for the 10 round magazines because if you load them beyond 8 rounds the apply too much pressure on the bolt and causes a 1.5 MOA POI shift. Also, realize that the MKII is very accurate, but the 10/22 is not, so it's not really good to compare them but they're both fantastic."
canadaguns,3bwtu2,Iamwomper,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:54:14 2015 UTC,Didn't know that about the Mk 2. Just forwarded that to my housemate.

Don't rule the lever action out, it's a straight shooter and is consistent.  Think long and hard on if you want to scope it or not. I scoped mine  and it went from being accurate to being really accurate."
canadaguns,3bwtu2,Iamwomper,1 point,Thu Jul 2 23:05:51 2015 UTC,Hmm I hadn't considered a Henry. I wouldn't be opposed to one and the price looks good.

Of particular issue is missing and murdered aboriginal women and whether the police have appropriately assigned enough resources to these cases.

Perhaps you're unaware of your latching onto this farcical social movement, but it shows exactly what matters to those that organize it and forward it; controversy and misdirected anger and pitty.   On the other hand I don't carry a firearm for ""protection"" because the police are a phone-call away and generally do their job well.   And do they teleport to you immediately? Or do you have to wait for them to show up, and hope it's in time? And you think your right to self defense is adequately replaced by a police force? One who has no obligation to your safety?   And what of your firearms at home? Clearly you don't need them either. Why would you need to go hunting when you can get food at the store?  Since we have already rejected personal responsibility what need do you have for them? They dont protect you or feed you in a ""civilized society"" after all.  You once again miss what the motivation for these individuals are becuase you've never met any. They want you gun free.

You know - going for the ha ha's. Sorry it made you upset.   It sounds like you know some pretty good people who don't fall into the scope of the joke but like the similar meme /u/BeaverNutz commented it's not unheard of. Maybe I just know a lot more of the superliberals who would get called out by it.  They are the same people who called for action about the Jefferson riots but don't seem to see a danger with also calling for the state to have a monopoly on force. I have seen the same people hold both positions. They want civilians to be disarmed - or at least be largely restricted - and then are upset when the state seemingly acts with impunity.   We shouldn't hold absolute positions. I have no problem with police having the tools to respond to certain extreme situations. For example, I have no problem with the police having armoured cars or military style equipment that is influenced by military. To me they are just tools. I have a problem with political decisions that put police in bad situations where maybe why those tools were deployed is the proper question not the fact they had those tools available to them.   And at the same time obviously I support civilian ownership of firearms. I don't want the state to have a monopoly on having these tools not for any silly reason like thinking we should have the power to overthrow the government but because in theory we shouldn't give up the ability to protect ourselves, to experience owning and using them as passtime and not divorce ourselves from our heritage. Just like I love experiencing hunting - even though I still buy steaks and burgers from grocery store - I don't want to divorce myself from the idea that we can and have been self-sufficient in the not so distant past.   Abrogating these rights and formerly well supported traditions is a creeping malaise in our society. We give up rights and power to the state or to other powers and then by consequence devolve control and power over our own lives. Some things I am happy to allow to others, such as medicine in the currently patchy way 'universal' healthcare is spread more equitably to most Canadians. Others, such as our personal security, even if it is just theoretical for the vast amount of Canadians, I am not as eager to give up.   Make no mistake. Many are. The main idea behind socialism - which I have no small experience in espousing in my younger days - is that the State knows better and we give up individuality so that resources are more equitably distributed. We give up rights in the hope that the State protects us from the powerful. Theoretically, we are the State. However, make no mistake, in this view, the State cannot be opposed and allowing individuals to have something like access to power such as personal ownership of firearms is a threat, it's a wild variable that threatens the ordered way of things. Peace is enabled because the State enforces peace.   Witness the way that Harper was pilloried when he stated that firearms in the tradition of his wife's rural roots were tools to aid in personal security. He was attacked for stating something as simple as this. No one made up this criticism. It was trumpeted in the media. This is because the majority of Canadians live in cities and are used to the idea that only police have firearms and their greatest tool is 911. Maybe none of your peers held this opinion - good for them - but I heard it and if you read /r/canada it was a vastly supported criticism of el Harper.  And then many of the same voices howled when it was revealed the RCMP is continuing the rolling out of their patrol carbines - guns that scream military and even worse were acquiring armoured vehicles and repurposing them for use by ERT. ""They're acquiring TANKS"".   And again the very leftist criticism over Canadian military actually engaging in fighting is contrasted with the halcyon days of Canada as a blue helmeted peacekeeper. That's a whole discussion in itself.   I'm not making that up.  It's there. To me it's an incongruity. To me, we should not give up our firearms or our theoretical ability to protect ourselves and yet we should not be overly critical of police having the tools to deal with extreme circumstances. And just because we as a country are peaceful doesn't mean we shouldn't employ our martial resources when the cause is right. Arguing about the cause is fine; but I have not heard any of the same voices ever saying any kind of cause is enough.   I'm sorry this idea was presented as an attempt at entertainment in the form of a meme but really, I just wanted the yuks. Sorry it did not appeal to you but I think I've presented some of my thinking behind that."

I think youve missed the mark though. Where do you think these people are from if not the city?   You may be confusing hippies or hipsters for social justice warriors and other equally misguided and uninformed ""POWER BY FEELZ"" individuals.  Its a liberal arts major meme, not a lot of them outside major urban centres."
canadaguns,3brqi1,Red_1977,2,Wed Jul 1 22:30:25 2015 UTC,"Oh there's plenty lots outside the city where I am. Perhaps this is more a regional thing? I don't know.   I'm speaking from personal experience from someone who lives in a community of dreadlocked lefties.  I can't speak outside of my experience obviously, but from my experience this is pretty off.     I could be wrong, but my suspicion is that there is a whole lot of stereotyping going on in this thread that is entirely driven from biased political assumptions, and not from informed opinion or personal experience."
canadaguns,3brqi1,kodemizer,4,Wed Jul 1 22:38:47 2015 UTC,My personal experience from the lefties is that they hate the guns and won't listen to any rational argument.   I don't even live in a major urban center.  So there we go.
canadaguns,3brqi1,Captain_Cthulhu,1 point,Wed Jul 1 23:26:06 2015 UTC,"Interesting. We must come from pretty different places!  To give you an taste of what people are like where I am, this book is all the rage right now: http://www.amazon.ca/The-Compassionate-Hunters-Guidebook-Hunting/dp/0865717702 .   It eschews labelling hunting a ""sport"" and prey animals ""game"", and instead seeks to cast hunting as a serious but intimate and compassionate process of life and death.   I know you're likely to see it as a bunch of hippie mumbo-jumbo, but I think perhaps it serves to illuminate some of where I'm coming from."
canadaguns,3brqi1,kodemizer,1 point,Thu Jul 2 01:44:42 2015 UTC,But how do they feel about black rifles?
canadaguns,3brqi1,Captain_Cthulhu,1 point,Thu Jul 2 02:47:29 2015 UTC,I don't understand... Context?
canadaguns,3brqi1,Red_1977,3,Thu Jul 2 02:56:30 2015 UTC,"A ""black rifle"" is a colloquial term that applies to a large array of rifles. These are typically more militaristic style firearms. such as the IWI Tavor, Robinson Arms XCR, and the infamous AR-15."
canadaguns,3brqi1,Red_1977,1 point,Thu Jul 2 03:35:47 2015 UTC,Are you on/near the west coast? I read an article several years ago about the non veggie west coast hippies starting to turn to hunting. I was very happy to see that.

canadaguns,3brqi1,kodemizer,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:55:55 2015 UTC,the other side of this is antigunners saying we're all redneck gun lovers.  It is just a fun strawman thing to do.  I try to see both sides of the argument but i'm biased.  I find it hard to justify owning my SKS.  The only point I can make is that it is fun and affordable to shoot paper-- to which people would say why not use a 22LR bolt action. but why own an impala when i could own a 78 trans am.  Shit is just bad ass.  but it's hard to make policies based on cool factor.
canadaguns,3brqi1,Rye631,2,Wed Jul 1 21:03:08 2015 UTC,"Sure but it's still a recreational sport. You don't need to justify your sks beyond ""it's fun"". By holding your firearms license you've proved you aren't a safety risk so it doesn't matter if you own a .50 or a .22 you still aren't going to hurt anyone with them."
canadaguns,3brqi1,GBU-28,1 point,Thu Jul 2 13:13:02 2015 UTC,"Of course, and anyone who says firearm owners are all rednecks should be corrected.   I'm glad to see you have a pretty fair opinion. Thanks!"

canadaguns,3btc83,ctcsupplies,1 point,Thu Jul 2 01:49:32 2015 UTC,I don't fully understand. Are you suggesting manufacturers bribe the RCMP for NR classifications?
canadaguns,3btc83,jmf101,2,Thu Jul 2 19:09:04 2015 UTC,"Nope the reason why the FRT database isn't publicly accessible is that the database is a packaged, commercial product sold by the RCMP.   The process of classification isn't commercialized, just the actual database of firearms is."
canadaguns,3btc83,ctcsupplies,3,Thu Jul 2 19:17:19 2015 UTC,Transparency is not something the Government is good at.  It's best that you do not know because it would only confuse and anger you.
canadaguns,3btc83,twist3d7,3,Thu Jul 2 01:08:32 2015 UTC,"It's terrible, any help would be great  *I am requesting a copy of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Firearms Reference Table ( FRT ) and any material such as but not limited to,  testing documentation, such as lab work done on firearms correspondents with firearms company explaining reasoning of classification documentation as to why firearms are classified as such, where testing was not conducted reason why firearms were refused for testing, if in fact refused.  I am requesting this material to better understand the classification of firearms.  it is unclear what firearms we can import into Canada from other countries, without this knowledge being in the public hands. The information contained in these records, should be allowed to be used by legal gun owners as reference information. Similar Databases for explosives do exist, and are accessible to the public for reference.*"
canadaguns,3btc83,hakb404,2,Thu Jul 2 16:05:47 2015 UTC,I'd love something like this to be available to us.
canadaguns,3btc83,Dusty514,1 point,Thu Jul 2 02:34:22 2015 UTC,You basically have to buy it from the RCMP IIRC.
canadaguns,3btc83,Wanhope,2,Fri Jul 3 01:47:13 2015 UTC,"I wonder if we can request a current FRT and all documentation regarding testing, and reasoning behind classification.

canadaguns,3btc83,varsil,1 point,Fri Jul 3 05:22:30 2015 UTC,"As for a full release of the FRT its been tried before, the RCMP's usual line is 'public release of the FRT would jeapordize the security of the country'. Its been stated by the RCMP after the same person challenged them that 'information on [the FRT]... was basically a compilation of information from various publicly available books such as Flaydermann's Guide.' and that the complete FRT was over 30,000 pages in total. There is a thread about this on CGN where there is more information but very little has come from it for the time being. I'm new here so im not sure if linking other sites is cool or not so I wont link it directly but the thread was ""Firearms Reference Table (FRT), anyone done an ATI?"""

canadaguns,3bv9fj,ri7ani,13,Thu Jul 2 12:56:04 2015 UTC,"If you leave the WD-40 on for too long it'll congeal into a thick yellow sludge, which then hardens into a yellow discoloration.  It's usable in a pinch, but it's designed for water displacement, not cleaning.  Sure smells good though."
canadaguns,3bv9fj,RMilca,2,Thu Jul 2 13:00:15 2015 UTC,there isn't any WD-40 left on the components anymore. i wiped the whole thing at the end and oiled with remoil.  what i did is i cleaned the parts with WD-40 just as i would've with action cleaner and found out it's just as good. it removed gunk very well.
canadaguns,3bv9fj,RMilca,2,Thu Jul 2 13:24:33 2015 UTC,"As long as you can get it all off, you are good.  I've used it once myself, many years ago on a bolt action .22 in lieu of having real gun oil during a particularly nasty grouse excursion. By day six it was a gunky mess, but I didn't realize that it was so shitty until I went to fire and the striker bound up in the bolt channel and did a light strike.  When I made it back to camp and took a closer look, the inside of the receiver was coated in a funky yellow stain, the bolt channel and mainspring were filled with a tacky grime.  Even now, all these years later, after many intensive scrubs with solvents and brushes the inside of the receiver still has a yellow sheen to it."
canadaguns,3bv9fj,RMilca,2,Fri Jul 3 00:14:41 2015 UTC,Fucking hell. Nah man i made sure there was none left.
canadaguns,3bv9fj,RMilca,2,Fri Jul 3 00:22:28 2015 UTC,I tried taking a picture of it but neither the lighting or the camera are good enough. It still retains the smell as well.  It was probably the second most depressing thing to happen to one of my rifles. The most depressing would be when one had a fall from up the tree I was in.  At least cleaning the WD-40 off is good practice for you.
canadaguns,3bv9fj,RMilca,2,Fri Jul 3 00:44:39 2015 UTC,Did you try boiling the parts?
canadaguns,3bv9fj,gayguyfromcanada,2,Fri Jul 3 01:11:11 2015 UTC,"The bolt, no, but it has been cleaned and is in good shape.  The logistics of trying to boil 8 inches or so of barreled receiver is more trouble than it's worth.  She functions fine, she's just a little yellow inside still."
canadaguns,3bv9fj,thingpaint,2,Fri Jul 3 01:16:08 2015 UTC,Cool. I'm a bit paranoid now lol i think i'll field strip again and make sure there are no residues left.
canadaguns,3bv9fj,DogfoodEnforcer,1 point,Fri Jul 3 01:22:57 2015 UTC,"The practice won't hurt.  I personally enjoy the ritual of cleaning, but up until the WD-40 incident I never bothered carrying a cleaning rod and supplies in my pack. Now I do.  Good luck keeping it all clean."
canadaguns,3bv9fj,Styrak,2,Fri Jul 3 01:36:42 2015 UTC,This. I hate WD40 for that exact reason. I won't let the stuff on my job site. Anyone sprays that crap on my tools and they're gonna suffer the rath of one pissed off boss (me).
canadaguns,3bv9fj,Bloedman,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:57:27 2015 UTC,Lol no worries. I made sure there's no wd40 left. Rifle is remoiled as i write this.
canadaguns,3bv9fj,NoxiousDogCloud,3,Fri Jul 3 03:49:26 2015 UTC,"I only use ballistol: http://www.ballistol.com  It dissolves fowling, corrosive ammo gunk, black powder residue, inhibits rusting, treats metal and wood. It's amazing stuff.  Downside; it stinks, like really stinks."
canadaguns,3bv9fj,alkali_feldspar,2,Thu Jul 2 14:55:08 2015 UTC,My fiancee likes the smell of it. It seems to go one of two ways for people.  1) Smells like an odd anise scent...gets sickly sweet after a while or 2) Smells like fermented garbage
canadaguns,3bv9fj,Notquitesafe,1 point,Thu Jul 2 22:28:07 2015 UTC,It has a licorice scent.  So if you don't like licorice...
canadaguns,3bv9fj,alkali_feldspar,5,Fri Jul 3 14:48:03 2015 UTC,"I think WD-40 would create more problems than it solves.  You think you got it all off, but whatever you didn't will harden in a yellowish shellac.  If you've run out of cleaning solution, like hoppes, just wait until you get some more.  In fact, I'd venture to you to re-clean with proper materials because wiping off WD-40 just doesn't sound like it's enough.  There's too many small moving parts that could get seized."
canadaguns,3bv9fj,Cheese_Bits,3,Thu Jul 2 22:04:27 2015 UTC,"WD-40 is a very mild solvent, and I suppose in a pinch it would do OK but it's really only good for removing water.   I use rem-action cleaner, hoppes, no8 and hoppes oil"
canadaguns,3bv9fj,BiluochunLvcha,2,Thu Jul 2 16:11:48 2015 UTC,i usually use rem-action cleaner and alternate between hoppes oil and remoil.
canadaguns,3bv9fj,FredBassdrop,5,Thu Jul 2 16:34:37 2015 UTC,"Nope. It doesn't dissolve corrosive salts from shooting surplus. I actually use windex followed by a light coat of oil on all of my firearms, or something designed to remove copper residue when I have a build up. Also, you don't really need to clean your firearms every time (unless you're shooting corrosive), leaving some copper in the barrel can help prolong its life."
canadaguns,3bv9fj,Styrak,5,Thu Jul 2 13:32:10 2015 UTC,"I use boiling water to clean the salts off then spray it down with Wd-40 to get the water residue off. So far never an issue, the whole yellow residue thing mostly applies to hunting rifles left for months at a time. Almost all gun oils start to have issues after a while"
canadaguns,3bv9fj,ElectricRyder,3,Thu Jul 2 14:37:42 2015 UTC,i use windex on my sks too but yesterday's cleaning was on a 22lr marlin 795. i sprayed some in the barrel and the black wd-40 coming out with the wd-40 was staggering. that's why i'm saying it did a pretty good job. i of course oiled the barrel at the end. there's no WD-40 on any of the components right now.

canadaguns,3bs9in,neoconfection,4,Thu Jul 2 01:40:45 2015 UTC,"“I’m still a Liberal senator, not independent,” Senator Mobina Jaffer said. “I’m still a Liberal. I’ve always been a Liberal. I’ve been a Liberal for 38 years.... I can absolutely campaign. It doesn’t stop me doing anything any other Liberal would do.”"
canadaguns,3bs9in,ctcsupplies,4,Thu Jul 2 01:52:29 2015 UTC,"Nice quote, but they're totally separated from all caucus activities on the Hill. Nothing stops them from being personally Liberal, but the caucuses are totally independent."
canadaguns,3bs9in,neoconfection,4,Thu Jul 2 02:27:28 2015 UTC,"Seems to me that some of the major changes proposed in the bill are:   Changing all instances of ""restricted"" to ""circumscribed"". Any idea why? So far as I can tell there's no real difference. Changing all instances of ""registration"" to ""inscription"". Any idea why? So far as I can tell there's no real difference. Multiple mentions to section 12(6.1), which I can't find the text of, either in the existing act, or S-231. You may only transport a restricted circumscribed or prohibited firearm through a ""carrier"", not yourself. Replaces instances of ""firearm"" referring to unrestricted firearms with the term ""hunting firearm"" Section 25(3) of S-231 appears to be incomplete, or showing great differences between the English and French versions. Can someone who reads French look at this? Adds the following text:  135.1 (1) A comprehensive review of the provisions and operation of this Act must be undertaken, every five years after this section comes into force, by the committee of the Senate, of the House of Commons, or of both Houses of Parliament, that may be designated or established for that purpose.  (2) The committee referred to in subsection (1) must, within a year after the review is undertaken or within any further period that the Senate, the House of Commons, or both Houses of Parliament, as the case may be, may authorize, submit a report on the review to Parliament that includes a statement of any changes to this Act or its operation that the committee recommends. All semi-automatic firearms are classified as restricted circumscribed. The above unless the firearm is prescribed to be a hunting firearm, in which case it will be considered to be a ""hunting firearm"". Adding a provision for anyone convicted of domestic violence to be prohibited from owning a firearm, and not a circumscribed firearm. Among others, a reference to section 346(1.1)(a) of the Criminal Code of Canada, which I can't find."
canadaguns,3bs9in,klipper76,5,Wed Jul 1 22:00:36 2015 UTC,"Celine Hervieux-Payette is a sneaky old bitch changing the wording to appear to be less offensive but in actuality make it more offensive.  Also, the more restrictive rules where gun owners are already pissed about the existing rules.    It would seem to me that they are really trying to go after the semi-automatics that do not appear at first glance to be hunting rifles.  This bill attempts to do so in a very sneaky and therefore dishonest way."
canadaguns,3bs9in,twist3d7,3,Thu Jul 2 01:01:38 2015 UTC,"Any idea why? So far as I can tell there's no real difference.   My best bet,  In order to purposely convolute the bill, thereby making it in it's entirety easier to slip through the cracks?  In addition one could argue that making a firearm Circumscribed seems like a word that degrades the rights and freedoms of Citizens less than making a firearm Restricted - even if it is functionally the same."
canadaguns,3bs9in,Valleywolf,2,Wed Jul 1 22:24:11 2015 UTC,"Could it be that the basis for the change is rooted in the French text of the act, and the having a poor translation to English?  The original term for ""restricted"" as used in the French version of the Act is ""autorisation restreinte"", which so far as I can tell translates cleanly to ""restricted"". Whereas the new term ""prohibition localisée"" seems to me to imply a more onerous term, perhaps denoting that the firearms have prohibited location allowance?"
canadaguns,3bs9in,klipper76,1 point,Thu Jul 2 03:46:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's most of it, it does make all semi-auto weapons fall under restricted though, and makes dealing with them a little harder.  But yeah the wording is strance. And the Inscribed is just a registry, she even said she used that word because of the negative connotations of registry....  It seems sorta loopy reasoning all around.  Almost as though the author of the bill has no idea how the current laws apply..."
canadaguns,3bs9in,No6655321,3,Thu Jul 2 04:34:15 2015 UTC,"(4) Dans le cas où l’arme à feu de chasse a été déclarée au bureau de douane et que le non-résident n’a pas rempli véridiquement le formulaire réglementaire ou que l’agent des douanes a des motifs raisonnables de croire qu’il est souhaitable, pour la sécurité du non-résident ou pour celle d’autrui, que la déclaration ne soit pas attestée, celui-ci peut refuser de l’attester et autoriser l’exportation de l’arme à feu à partir du bureau de douane.   My take on the translation:  In the case where a hunting firearm has been declared to the customs office (as opposed to officeR in the partial English paragraph) and the non-resident has not truthfully filled out the regulatory form or the customs officer (yes, officeR this time) has reasonable motives to believe that it is desirable, for the security of the non-resident or that of others, that the declaration should not be attested, he can refuse to attest and authorize the export of the firearm from the customs office. e attested"

Furthermore, they only take place as part of the Sunset Ceremonies in Ottawa, not as part of the regular Musical Ride that tours the country.  “ERT has been part of the Sunset Ceremonies in Ottawa for approximately 10 years,” RCMP spokesperson Harold Pfleiderer told the National Post in an emailed statement. “It is to show the public an example of the RCMP’s operational response capability in its role as Canada’s national police. The ERT demonstration is not part of Musical Ride performances anywhere other than at Sunset Ceremonies in Ottawa.”  Pfleiderer also stressed that the ERT demonstration only took a few minutes “of the more than two-hour Sunset Ceremonies and pre-show.”"

Ultimately, I decided to forgo it, but having seen this post I am now curious as to whether or not the community here would appreciate being updated when we have a particular sale/event happening?

canadaguns,3bmpq1,polale,12,Tue Jun 30 14:26:06 2015 UTC,"The problem isn't that the RCMP is doing it rather than the legislature, the problem is that the legislature needed to lay out clear guidelines for the RCMP to follow in terms of classification (e.g. requiring some level of functional similarity or interchangeable parts for a firearm to be classified as a ""variant,"" making it clear that ""turning a machinist loose for a day or two"" is not an acceptable test for something being ""convertible"" etc.) but didn't.  Yes, the RCMP is doing a completely incompetent job, but at least part of it is that the legislature gave them no guidance whatsoever - hell, they could even have told the RCMP to devise a set of guidelines and procedures that they'd then be held to, but they didn't even do that."
canadaguns,3bmpq1,carasci,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:38:41 2015 UTC,"""turning a machinist loose for a day or two""    This just in, blocks of high grade steel or aluminum are now prohibited firearms as they can easily be converted to fully automatic firearms."
canadaguns,3bmpq1,Golanthanatos,2,Fri Jul 3 11:36:39 2015 UTC,"Exactly.  If all you have to do is drop in some FA parts or poke it with a dremel, sure, that's ""easily convertible.""  If it requires tools, expertise or parts not available to an average guy in his garage (e.g. a CNC machine, extensive machining work or parts that are controlled/unavailable) then it may be convertible, but it's hard to call it ""easy.""  Edit: For that matter, I recall at least one case (don't remember if here or down south) where their test gun was such a mess that it literally blew up after a couple shots but they still argued it was ""convertible.""  No, it's not bloody ""convertible"" if the guy holding it is in more danger than the guy in front of it."
canadaguns,3bmpq1,carasci,1 point,Fri Jul 3 14:51:48 2015 UTC,"I hate to even mention it, but filing down a sear can turn anything ""full auto"", unsafe as fuck, and no way to do anything other than empty the mag, but pull the trigger once and away she goes."
canadaguns,3bmpq1,Golanthanatos,2,Fri Jul 3 17:10:04 2015 UTC,"Well, yes, there's that too, but that's half the problem with all these regulations anyways: the definitions are often ambiguous and completely ignore mechanical and technical realities.  It seems reasonable to include as a criteria that a ""fully-automatic firearm"" has to both fire multiple rounds upon pulling the trigger and stop when the trigger is released, but the existing CCC definition (""a firearm that is capable of...discharging projectiles in rapid succession during one pressure of the trigger"") isn't exactly clear on that.  Perhaps there's some sort of clarifying language somewhere regarding the interpretation like there is for ""semi-auto"" in the regulations, but more likely it's just another one of those cases where things won't be clarified until someone forces the issue.  It does open another question, though....technically, that definition would seem to permit a firearm designed to slam-fire which entirely lacked a trigger group (pull the bolt back and off you go), since it wouldn't have a ""trigger"" at all.  (Ignoring the legal side of it, that's still a crazy stupid idea and I wouldn't want to be anywhere near someone silly enough to try it unless there was some serious bullet-resistant glass in the way.)"

canadaguns,3bmpq1,echo_61,9,Tue Jun 30 23:52:19 2015 UTC,"This is a common misunderstanding with C-42.  The government has ALWAYS had the ability to reclassify firearms from non-restricted/restricted to prohibited by order-in-council.  Before C-42 the government **did not have the codified ability through an order-in-council to reclassify a prohibited firearm to restricted or non-restricted or a restricted firearm to non-restricted.  With C-42 it legally allows the government to make P firearms R or NR, and R firearms NR.  THIS IS A NEW POWER"
canadaguns,3bmpq1,ctcsupplies,0,Wed Jul 1 00:05:02 2015 UTC,"Agreed.  The OICs not being touched by the Conservatives are why we have the Swiss Arms issue.   I still stand by the fact that the RCMP didn't cause the Swiss arms issue, but that the conservatives did by allowing the flawed OICs to stand for 7 years.   That said, without the OICs there would really be no discretion at all in NR, R, P judgements.  The real bitch is the variant clause, which only exists because of the OICs that the Conservatives really should have dealt with over the last seven freaking years.   I fear that as any reclassification power gets used more and more, you'll see the opposition parties licking their chops to use it on the shopping list of scary rifles of the day."

Or the little bare bones crappy set of 4 tools that comes in the glove box of a motorcycle. Used that little shitty set to fix a buddies shifter on the side of the road after he wiped out and dropped when we were an hour from home.

When they can provide no reasons as to why something is prohibited, it's rather difficult to wonder why they garner no respect from the public and get their policy circumvented.  Similar argument on the radio yesterday as to how speed limits are set on streets. If they're set within reason, people tend not to break the rules. If a 50Km/h engineered street is posted at 30Km/h however, people flaunt the rule.  Or with stop sign implementation: Many should be yields, then when you NEED to really stop, nobody respects the sign. (nevermind revenue generation yadda yadda)"

Ugh, stupidly frustrating.  This all goes with why I believe metro areas should be city-states, then they can institute their layer of government properly for their needs as municipal by-laws obviously shouldn't be in charge of firearms, and the federal layer can relax as it doesn't have to try to cater to metro needs, as its concerns are for everyone, not overwhelmingly those in you-know-where.  Firearms being solely a federal issue needs to be fixed. We have a layered system for a reason. Want anything in a metro? Restricted since you have to use a range anyway. Outside of metro? You're shooting at a sand pit or outdoor club or crown land, so who cares.  Everybody can win here, I don't get the log-jam. I'm sure the OPP would love a metro gun control hard on, eww."

canadaguns,3bls3k,Decivox,6,Tue Jun 30 14:25:18 2015 UTC,"Tony Bernardo, executive director of the Canadian Shooting Sports Association, said he suspects the Mounties classified the Blaze-47 as prohibited because of its resemblance to an AK-47 assault rifle. . . . “They’re not remotely the same” as an AK-47, he said. “Racing stripes on a Mustang doesn’t make an Indy 500 car.”   This.  Again, we all need to push for sensible, objective, functional-criteria-based standards.  Pay attention in your ridings; whenever there's an all-candidate's forum, or whenever any of the candidates with a chance of winning is having a rally or an AMA of any sort anywhere, ask them this question:   Will you support using only sensible, objective, function-based criteria to classify firearms, to replace the arbitrary nature of the current classification lists?   [If any of you can think of a more concise way to phrase that, let me know.]   Under the new law, the cabinet now has the authority to remove restrictions on guns after getting “independent expert advice.” De Le Rue would not say who would provide that advice.  Bernardo said his association has recommended to the government the idea of creating a panel of experts, consisting of the RCMP and industry representatives, to make gun-classification decisions. “Certainly you want more than one opinion,” he said. “We need to apply the law equally and uniformly.”   YES!!!  This!!  And we should demand that this panel, whenever they classify a firearm or group of firearms, publicly release their reasons for that classification, so we can call them on any BS shenanigans.   However, government opposition critics have said gun-classification decisions should remain in the hands of law enforcement. Giving discretionary authority to the cabinet to classify guns opens it up to “lobbying by gun interests to make arbitrary changes, should it wish, for political purposes,” and jeopardizes public safety, NDP MP Murray Rankin said in the House of Commons last month.   On the one hand, that is a big potential problem.  On the other hand, while the problem would have one flavour under a Conservative government, it'd have another flavour under an NDP or Liberal government.  I don't want to see a system where either gun manufacturers/gun users/owners or gun control advocates can lobby for this or that classification."

canadaguns,3bls3k,CheeseNBacon2,-14,Wed Jul 1 05:05:22 2015 UTC,"I am going out on a limb here and saying that the Blaze 47 is considered prohib for the same reasons the m&P15-22 is considered restricted. The M&P15-22 is not just a look alike to a real AR15, it's a full on analog.  It has all the same battery of arms.  Why then does the Mossburg 715T not fit this?  Different battery of arms.   The Blaze 47? Well, yes a look alike AK.  But what is its battery of arms?  It is just a plastic shell around a regular blaze 22, or is there more to it?  We can all agree it doesn't make much sense when we look at the function of the blaze 47 vs a real AK.  But the wording of the prohibition orders is ""The firearm of the design commonly known as the AK-47 rifle, and any variant or modified version of i*"" For the restricted order, its the same wording only with M16 replacing AK47.    If we took a real AK47 and a Blaze 47 and showed them to someone asking them to point out the AK, most would probably say they're both AKs.  So yes, this is a design commonly known as the AK47.  Is it a variant or modified version of the AK?  Well I don't know the full battery of arms, but the magazines come and go the same, the safety is in the same position, it has similar sights.  So I'm leaning to the word 'modified' here.  The problem here is not the RCMP firearms lab being willy nilly and arbitrary, the problem is how the law is actually written.   It's easy for Stephen Blaney to blame 'un-elected bureaucrats"" and its easy to put the blame for the stupidity of the law on to the faceless RCMP.  Everyone eats this up with a spoon and asks for more.  But the RCMP is only working with the tools that Parliament gave them.  It's very obvious we need to re-write our Firearms Act that if there are to be restrictions on controls on what firearms Canadians can and cannot own, those laws are based on the function of the firearm and not some arbitrary list.    This is where thin ice starts to set in, and semi automatic, box magazine fed, pistol gripped guns might all become prohibited or restricted.  So be careful what you wish for!"
canadaguns,3bls3k,AdiposeFin,16,Tue Jun 30 11:55:12 2015 UTC,"its the same wording only with M16 replacing AK47.  If we took a real AK47 and a Blaze 47 and showed them to someone asking them to point out the AK, most would probably say they're both AKs  the magazines come and go the same, the safety is in the same position, it has similar sights.   By that reasoning all ARs are M16 variants and therefore prohibited.  Or the CZ 58/ CSA 858/ etc as AKs.  And for the second point, we're not asking just anyone.  We're asking the RCMP firearms lab, people who are supposed to be experts in firearms.  I could put a 10/22 in a Nomad stock and put it next to a legit G36 and the average person would probably think they are the same.  Doesn't mean they are.  And doesn't mean the RCMP firearms lab should think so.  It's their job to know better than that.  I would say that those features are immaterial to determining if it is a variant.  I would also think that a professional group of firearms expert would know that what should be significant is the receiver as well as parts compatability.  It has a different receiver and 0 parts compatability.  It is not a variant, not by any reasonable definition of the word.  It's like me dressing up my shit box to look like a sports car.  It might look coola nd fast, but under the hood it's still just a shitty 4 banger.  I 100% agree though that the Firearms Act needs to be re-written and clarified, but I think the reasoning used to ban these .22s as AK variants is thin at best and demonstrates 1 of two things.  Either the RCMP firearms lab is staffed by people who no nothing about firearms, or they are deliberately overstepping their bounds, because like I said; anyone with even a basic knowledge of firearms should recognize that this gun is by no reasonable definition of the word a 'variant' of the AK."
canadaguns,3bls3k,belisariusM,-3,Tue Jun 30 12:11:55 2015 UTC,"By that reasoning all ARs are M16 variants and therefore prohibited.     But that's not what the order days.  The order says they're restricted.   Or the CZ 58/ CSA 858/ etc as AKs.    But it doesn't look like an ak.  Of you put a vz58 beside an ak, its obviously different.  It's not the same design, its not a variant nor is it an adaptation.   I would say that those features are immaterial to determining if it is a variant.     There are three elements to the prohibition orders.  Design, variant and adaptation.  Everyone seems to fixate only on the variant part and forgets that all three apply.  Design being the key word here.  The blaze 47, m&p1522, or even the Gsg5 are all designed to look like the real thing.  It's not an aftermarket stock bolted on to the rifle.  That's where the sticky wicket is here.  It's very poorly written law that is the problem here.  Those who wrote it (The Liberal Party of Canada) had no idea about guns and just went ban happy.  So we got rifles like the FAL being prohib, but an m14 being nonrestricted when they are effectively the same thing, a 308 semi auto rifle.  Look at the swiss arms shit show.  What was the problem? The rifles were  the same design as the SG550, not the SG540.  Since the SG550 is prohibited by name, all the swiss arms were prohibited.  Now everyone wants to paint this as some arbitrary ruling from the RCMP, but that was not the case.  The problem is how the law was written.  We need a new firearms act, but this could be very dangerous.  How is that law going to be worded so that legitimate firearms owners can enjoy the hobby, while criminals are stopped from access to them?    There is going to have to be some ceded ground here.  Would anyone accept having all pistol gripped, semiauto, detachable box fed rifles with barrels less than 18.5""  be restricted if it meant you can own and shoot an AK?  Could that be a compromise?  What about semi auto magazine restrictions to 5rounds except at a gun range?  If there will be new law, or we want new law, the firearms community needs to start talking now and recognize that compromise will have to be made."

canadaguns,3bls3k,r_a_g_s,2,Tue Jun 30 15:47:10 2015 UTC,"But that's not what the order says. The order says they're restricted.   But the order says M16/M4 and variants are prohibited.  AR-15 are variants of M16/M4s and vice versa.  So what's the difference?  The receiver and how it's built/designed is the difference (from what I understand it's just an extra hole for a pin for the auto sear).    Or the CZ 58/ CSA 858/ etc as AKs.    But it doesn't look like an ak.   Sure it does, it looks a lot like an AK.  If all we're going on is where and how the mags go, and what the sights are like then sure it is.  But these are all superficial details when it comes to determining if something is the same design.  It's like saying my Cavalier is the same as a Sunfire because they're both painted black and look kinda the same. No!  It's because they both have the same frame and engine.    How is it actually put together, what parts does it use, the receiver itself, these are the things that determine if something is a variant, or design or adaptation of another firearm.  Hold up a picture of an 858 to someone on the street and ask if it's an AK and I bet most would say ""yep"". Which is kinda my point, are we seriously expecting 'firearms experts' to take a cursory glance at something and decide ""welp they look the same so they must be the same"" ?  Because that's basically what they're doing, and what you are saying is reasonable.   The blaze 47, m&p1522, or even the Gsg5 are all designed to look like the real thing.   Design is a key word, you are right, but look is the other key word there.  It's aesthetics, not the way it's actually built or functions,.  It's not designed to be an AK in anything more than a superficial sense.  It's not a variant of an AK because it shares no design characteristics other than looks, and it's not adapted from an AK because it shares no operational characteristics.  It's not an AK because it's not an AK receiver.  It's actually adapted from and shares design characteristics with the Blaze, which is NR.  It's a modified variant adaptation of the Blaze, not the AK.   I'm not disagreeing that the law is poorly written, I'm just saying that this is (yet a another) case where the RCMP is taking its vagueness and lack of definition for certain terms much farther than is reasonable or justifiable.  It's not the bad wording of the law that's the problem in this case, it's the RCMP's deliberately over zealous interpretation of it.   The Swiss Arms shit show was caused by the manufacturer repurposing full-auto receivers (550s) to semi-autos and importing them as the semi-autos (540s).  Someone noticed the different receivers, told the RCMP and the RCMP banned them all rather than just the repurposed ones, probably because that's just easier and more feasible seeing as the repurposed ones were basically mixed in with the purpose built ones and then they'd have to go tracking them all down and all that.  That's why they got banned. http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/swiss-arms-classic-green-rifle-ban-to-be-reviewed-by-government-1.2555746  I don't think we need to cede any ground or make a whole new law.  What we need is to add a definition of what 'variant', 'design' and 'adaptation' mean to the existing act.  That along with what's already been done with C-42 should (mostly) solve this problem.     We need a new firearms act, but this could be very dangerous. How is that law going to be worded so that legitimate firearms owners can enjoy the hobby, while criminals are stopped from access to them?   We can leave it all the same except define the categories.  P = anything full auto, easily converted to full auto, or pistols below a certain length.  R = pistols above the aforementioned length and semi-auto centerfire rifles below a certain length.  NR = everything else with a min OAL.  It's essentially the same we have now but with the fat trimmed.  No more banned by name or because the RCMP feels like it.  Any firearm is one of the three based solely on functional design characteristics, not on whims and aesthetics or deliberately disingenuous interpretation of 'variant'."

As much as I hate the current Conservative party, I wouldn't trust a rewrite of firearms law under any non-Conservative government.  But I think we can get a lot of progress done if we just push for a criteria-based classification system, which doesn't need a change in the Act, just a change in the regulations (which can be done by Cabinet, doesn't need Parliamentary approval).  Just remove all the stupid classifications (especially the ""specific model X or variants"" ones), put in a list of sensible criteria developed with input from law-abiding firearms owners and users, firearms manufacturers and retailers, and any gun control advocates who are capable of rational thought on the issue.  (As with anyone else on either side of any issue, some gun control advocates seem to just have their brain switch off when they get their steam up, and so what they say ends up not being very helpful.)  I mean, I'm looking at the list of criteria for the old US ""assault weapons ban"", and I'm asking, seriously, Exactly how do these criteria make a firearm more ""dangerous""?

I'm breaking the law but there's no way for anyone to enforce it, because I can drop out the mag and say I've just got it for when I have the normal stock on.   There's no way to enforce it.

canadaguns,3bl9hv,thehuntinggearguy,2,Tue Jun 30 03:26:13 2015 UTC,The poly receiver and hinge really is the weak point of the rifle.  I read somewhere that people who added the aftermarket hinge kit increased accuracy slightly.  Can't remember were I read that though.  If I win the lottery I would setup a shop producing these with some slight tweaks and it would be a license to print money.

I ripped the spring system out of there no problem, put on a railed pump, and slapped on a big 18"" barrel with proper chokes!

This is the biggest concern right here.    Let's face it folks, the PAL is like a lock, it only works for honest people.  It's a very simple document to forge, and there's next to no safe guard built in to it.  Take a look at your driver's license, passport, any currency and they will have all kinds of built in security features.  The PAL?  It has none, and would be incredibly easy to forge."

canadaguns,3blyu4,CheeseNBacon2,1 point,Wed Jul 1 06:55:55 2015 UTC,"Did they say why it's restricted?  It seems to meet all the criteria for NR.  It's overall length is fine, and being rimfire there's no minimum barrel length."

All we can do is wait at this point. I'm convinced we will see it as NR and its just a matter of time before its in my hands hehehe.

canadaguns,3bknso,mwmwmwmwmmdw,1 point,Tue Jun 30 07:40:44 2015 UTC,As of yesterday we are allowing 223/556 and slugs on range B only. As for the no ATT restricted thing it is to say.

canadaguns,3bjy04,DongFullOfFist,3,Mon Jun 29 20:54:33 2015 UTC,"It is my understanding that Remington encouraged owners of their shotguns to douse the trigger group with Rem-Oil as a means to ""cleanse"" them when cleaning the firearm. This may have been the preferred method of cleaning the firearm for you grandfather.  What this means is that the last time your granddad cleaned it, he sprayed the trigger group with the oil, and then put that shotgun away until you fiddled with it. It may be possible that the trigger group is gunked up to hell, meaning the mechanisms are bogged down with decades-old oil and dirt goop.  You can try to take the trigger group apart and clean the individual parts, but that maybe a little daunting or complex. Dipping the entire thing in an ultrasonic cleaner bath could work too. And if you don't feel like trying those methods, actually spraying the trigger group with a fresh can of Rem-Oil and ""washing"" off the old gunk could work too.  Hope this helps!"
canadaguns,3bjy04,The_Crover,2,Mon Jun 29 21:14:29 2015 UTC,"In a bind (the bind being fear of disasembling an unfamiliar trigger group) I find a liberal blasting of outers degreaser to be a quick and cheap alternative to the ultra sonic cleaner, and will do a better job of ""cleansing"" than the more oil solution.   Straight up hose that bitxh down with the stuff, tben lay it out in the sun till it all evaporates. Then you can be more tactfull in replacing the oil, and work the hammer a few times to get it into the work surfaces."
canadaguns,3bjy04,anti-apostle,1 point,Tue Jun 30 00:33:34 2015 UTC,Sounds good!
canadaguns,3bjy04,The_Crover,1 point,Tue Jun 30 01:54:24 2015 UTC,Mineral spirits would do the same thing as well. Breaks down oils and evaporates away to nothing.
canadaguns,3bjy04,MangoYogenFruz,2,Tue Jun 30 07:29:22 2015 UTC,"Remington also makes ""Action Cleaner"" which is basically an aerosol can of lighter fluid. It claims to be effective at freeing up actions without the need for disassembly."
canadaguns,3bjy04,JohnoTheFoolish,1 point,Tue Jun 30 00:59:29 2015 UTC,Oh good to know.
canadaguns,3bjy04,The_Crover,1 point,Tue Jun 30 01:55:13 2015 UTC,"Take the trigger group out (field strip, take barrel and bolt off, then push out the 2 pins in the receiver and the trigger group should come out). Take some non-blurry close up photos and post them here. Put your thumb over the hammer and release it, so you can take some detailed photos of the hammer as well.  It is possible that the hammer is hanging up due to a burr or due to being bent (I've seen this), and it is possible and maybe more likely that there is simply sticky oil residue and other gunk in there. Your hammer spring could also be stuck or sticky.  With the trigger group out, you can also possibly see yourself what is going on. It is safe to pull the trigger as long as you have something to stop the hammer (Let it snap against your palm or something)  If it is dirt or gunk causing the issue, the trigger group can be pretty much completely disassembled using basic tools like a 1/16"" punch and small pliers. The only exception is the hammer pin, which is riveted. Leaving a few parts that you can't take out without re-riveting that, which usually requires a new pin. There are lots of youtube videos showing this process as well."

canadaguns,3biocw,Tillwoofy,4,Mon Jun 29 15:32:45 2015 UTC,It is prepared... to drop cash at a gun store :) I already know what I want!
canadaguns,3biocw,airchinapilot,5,Mon Jun 29 15:38:07 2015 UTC,yes cash before credit
canadaguns,3biocw,alkali_feldspar,5,Mon Jun 29 15:50:09 2015 UTC,I get points for using my credit card... so I just spend everything on that and pay if off at the end of the month.
canadaguns,3biocw,alkali_feldspar,3,Mon Jun 29 16:04:43 2015 UTC,What are you going to get?
canadaguns,3biocw,Tillwoofy,4,Mon Jun 29 15:39:03 2015 UTC,"-Mossberg 500, or 590a1 (prefer the 590) -Savage bolt action in .223 Later on, things i'd love to get: -Lee Enfield -M1 Garand -k98 -beretta m92"
canadaguns,3biocw,airchinapilot,5,Mon Jun 29 15:52:12 2015 UTC,590A1 if you want a zombie gun. That thing is indestructible. I will never sell that one even if I hardly ever shoot it.
canadaguns,3biocw,alkali_feldspar,4,Mon Jun 29 16:13:50 2015 UTC,"I have the Mossberg 500 combo from Cabelas, and then put an ATI stock on it. It's a solid shotgun, and having 2 barrels is awesome. Savage is good, just keep in mind 223 might be too small to hunt with in some areas if you're interested in hunting. 308 may be a better choice, it's got way more power and range. Lee Enfield are awesome, I have 2 of them, but can be expensive. Same thing with the M1. K98's are nice too, but I'm a fan of any Mauser action. As for the beretta, look at the Girsan 9mm. It's a Turkish clone for 1/2 the price but is every bit as nice, or nicer than the Beretta. I have some friends with Beretta's but I ended up going with the Girsan."
canadaguns,3biocw,Tillwoofy,3,Mon Jun 29 16:03:19 2015 UTC,I don't have much interest in hunting. All of them are just going to be paper punchers and clay blasters.
canadaguns,3biocw,alkali_feldspar,2,Mon Jun 29 20:01:24 2015 UTC,"Coolio, just something to keep in mind. If you want to go past 300m to 500m you still might want to consider the larger caliber."
canadaguns,3biocw,Tillwoofy,3,Mon Jun 29 20:03:28 2015 UTC,I'll prolly end up with something in either .308 or 30-06 later on. Just trying to get started with something with some cheaper ammo to begin with.
canadaguns,3biocw,alkali_feldspar,2,Mon Jun 29 20:06:24 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. I started with a 30-06, then got a 22 for plinking and working on technique. I'd suggest the 308 over the 30-06. Performance is similar enough, but the 308 usually is a short action and tends to be a bit tighter."
canadaguns,3biocw,Bnspl,3,Mon Jun 29 20:09:13 2015 UTC,Excellent - nicely done.
canadaguns,3biocw,Tillwoofy,2,Mon Jun 29 16:10:07 2015 UTC,I called in to check my restricted application and they said they were backed up like 4-5 weeks :/
canadaguns,3biocw,neoconfection,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:28:42 2015 UTC,It's really not that surprising :( i budgeted about 3-4 months for it...
canadaguns,3biocw,neoconfection,7,Mon Jun 29 21:08:36 2015 UTC,Reloaded 100 .40 S&W rounds and 150 5.56 NATO. Broke in my Savage Mk.II FV and I'm very pleased with it. Bought reloading supplies for the first time in a while and I'm flabbergasted by how expensive it has become.  Still feel like shit but the range trip was a welcome distraction.
canadaguns,3biocw,neoconfection,4,Mon Jun 29 16:20:47 2015 UTC,Some much needed distraction is definitely a good thing.
canadaguns,3biocw,BeaverNutz,3,Mon Jun 29 16:27:37 2015 UTC,Definitely. Now sorting through old brass I thought was finished to see what can be salvaged. Sitting with a flashlight and examining every 6.5x55 Swedish casing I own is fun.   Bought a new ball trimmer since the last one was so dull it took 30 seconds to trim a single 5.56 casing. Found some random-ass headstamps in some range pickup 5.56- Israel Military Industries and the Portuguese state arsenal.   Some guy keeps shooting .338 Lapua at the 100yd range at my club and leaves his Lapua brass. I have about 40 of them now.
canadaguns,3biocw,neoconfection,3,Mon Jun 29 17:39:31 2015 UTC,Fuck - that Lapua brass is NOT cheap.   You can likely sell it for a couple bucks a piece.
canadaguns,3biocw,airchinapilot,2,Mon Jun 29 17:42:41 2015 UTC,Oh I know :) Next time I have enough brass in other calibers good for sale I'll put them up.
canadaguns,3biocw,airchinapilot,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:22:04 2015 UTC,Guess you gotta buy a 338 lapua now. Can't let that brass go to waste.

canadaguns,3biocw,airchinapilot,6,Tue Jun 30 01:45:12 2015 UTC,"Shot Tacmatch on Sunday. I prepared by bringing a cooler with lots of Gatorade and water. Turned out not so bad but all the hydration certainly helped and also our RO is a instructor with the reserves so we all dutifully drank up when ordered to 'hydrate!' I did pretty well by my standards until the last fateful stage. 5 shots in my AR decided to go bolt action. Ugh. 15 or 25 shots pulling back the bolt like I was in the Franco-Prussian war or something. Ugh. There went the entire match just like that. Afterwards my RO said why I didn't just take the penalties and save the time. Well, because I wanted to fucking kill those paper targets after that happened."
canadaguns,3biocw,airchinapilot,3,Mon Jun 29 15:43:13 2015 UTC,"Also I had a friend come over on Thursday and finally get my reloading press working. I've pumped out about 50 rounds now in a couple different loads. 3.8gr and 4gr for 147g bullet. I'm finding that I spend more time fixing mistakes than actually producing rounds, though. Some niggling things just not right with that press."
canadaguns,3biocw,ctcsupplies,3,Mon Jun 29 15:53:07 2015 UTC,Ugh - did you find out what happened? Was the gas system gunked up?
canadaguns,3biocw,airchinapilot,4,Mon Jun 29 16:09:22 2015 UTC,I broke it down in the safety area but really since it was my last stage I decided to leave it until later. It wasn't lube as it was pretty froglubed up. I'll look at it tonight. Probably gunked up like you said. I'll run a pipe cleaner through it.
canadaguns,3biocw,ctcsupplies,3,Mon Jun 29 16:11:59 2015 UTC,Blech - what a pain in the arse.  time to get a backup ar....
canadaguns,3biocw,airchinapilot,4,Mon Jun 29 16:20:09 2015 UTC,I have a backup AR. At one point I had three ARs. I never shoot my backup AR. Truth be told I'm going to the 3 Gun Championship in a couple weeks and I just can't see myself lugging another rifle with me. Space is at a premium on 'the team bus'.
canadaguns,3biocw,sushixp,2,Mon Jun 29 16:23:13 2015 UTC,Heh.   Make damn sure you clean the shit out of your match AR then - don't need it cocking up like that out of town.
canadaguns,3biocw,airchinapilot,3,Mon Jun 29 16:29:36 2015 UTC,hmmm I could bring a backup UPPER....
canadaguns,3biocw,pattrick613,2,Mon Jun 29 16:53:42 2015 UTC,THAT doesn't take much room ;)
canadaguns,3biocw,neoconfection,2,Mon Jun 29 17:07:32 2015 UTC,You can bring up one of mine as a back up gun
canadaguns,3biocw,alkali_feldspar,2,Mon Jun 29 20:01:28 2015 UTC,Or I could switch to one of the three Tavors shudder
canadaguns,3biocw,The_Crover,2,Mon Jun 29 20:02:34 2015 UTC,which all shoot left? you'd better bring my spare gun
canadaguns,3biocw,alkali_feldspar,2,Mon Jun 29 20:20:24 2015 UTC,Considering. ..
canadaguns,3biocw,alkali_feldspar,2,Mon Jun 29 20:29:40 2015 UTC,Man I really wished you got that on video.  It's a sign of things to come if any non gun friendly party comes to power this October
canadaguns,3biocw,CheeseNBacon2,3,Mon Jun 29 18:30:54 2015 UTC,We did get it on video but everyone was way too tired to take a look at it yet. If the funny factor overcomes the pain factor I'll put it up.
canadaguns,3biocw,CheeseNBacon2,4,Mon Jun 29 18:46:44 2015 UTC,Finally got to go to the range with /u/neoconfection this Sunday. It's been too long and I think it was therapeutic relaxation for both of us. It was pouring the entire time but we still had a blast shooting.  I'm particularly proud of my best 50 yard 5 shot group so far with my K31. The grouping.

This thing sounds dumb. No one is going to be switching around their shotgun configuration so often they need the extra complexity of a tool-less design. They have introduced so many potential fail points in an otherwise excellent shotgun design. Get the 500 combo from Cabelas, it's fantastic."

canadaguns,3big6e,polarbeer,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:54:41 2015 UTC,"This. Also, it's very impractical to have a dedicated pistol grip shotgun, just to shoot a few rounds before/after shooting clays. With flex you can have both."
canadaguns,3big6e,whatishapening,3,Fri Jul 3 02:49:00 2015 UTC,I bought a black 500 flex with a 28in barrel a year ago. Never actually ended up switching out any parts. But I like the shotgun itself. It will make a bit of rattling noise around some of the exchangeable parts if you shake it. But it is none the less sturdy in my opinion.

canadaguns,3bfu1n,Randomreditname,6,Sun Jun 28 21:14:32 2015 UTC,"You can buy all the parts yourself and build one in an hour. I built mine- very satisfying experience. I bought my stripped upper, lower, and barrel from SFRC and all the rest from /u/ctcsupplies .   The Norinco/Dominion Arms rifles are good if you don't know if you'll like ARs or not. If you're set on one and don't feel like building it, you can get a good carbine for under $1000.   I think the unreliability of direct-impingement (normal) ARs is vastly overblown and the piston ARs aren't worth the money. Normal AR-15 parts are long ago standardized and interchangeable across manufacturers. My AR is a hybrid of various manufacturer's parts, which is great because if something breaks it can easily be replaced. When you buy a piston AR, you are beholden to that manufacturer for repairs and replacement parts since the gas systems are unique to every brand. That is bloody expensive and inconvenient."
canadaguns,3bfu1n,neoconfection,2,Sun Jun 28 22:14:12 2015 UTC,Great point.  This was my major concern with the SR-556.  The standardization of all the DI parts is a big bonus.
canadaguns,3bfu1n,neoconfection,2,Sun Jun 28 22:19:19 2015 UTC,"The limitless potential to customize ARs is their main selling point. IMO, if you buy a piston AR you're losing the main advantage of the rifle."

I ended up purchasing a Smith and Wesson M&P 15 (MAGPUL Edition) from WEM Wild West Shooting.   By far the best decision I have made, and all the reviews based upon it have been nothing short of excellent. They have a sport model for around $800-900, and it is a reliable, accurate, well made firearm.  Take a look at them, you might change your mind, here is a link to a review.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YdpE6Lpw9E  Here is a link to the Sport model, great price also: http://gun-shop.ca/product/smith-wesson-mp-15-223-rem/"

canadaguns,3bfu1n,neoconfection,2,Tue Jun 30 05:29:56 2015 UTC,Any of these AR's in the 1k+ range are similar and will suit your needs. I bought a Sig M400 with the Magpul MOE kit. Its amazing and goes bang every time I squeeze the trigger.
canadaguns,3bfu1n,crenom,2,Mon Jun 29 00:02:52 2015 UTC,"Just to touch on the norinco/dominion arms ARs, /u/neoconfection made a good point about if you're not 100% sure, then it's a good rifle to get your feet wet with.   I bought one last fall when Canada Ammo had a sale and it's been fantastic. I've only put about 1000 rounds through it of various brands but i've had no issues whatsoever. It's not as pretty as your higher end ARs, it doesn't have a quad rail, or keymod, but i didn't need any of that for my first entry into ARs. If all you want is something that goes bang every time then you shouldn't have an issue with them. Plus, the extra money you save can go to accessories, optic, or ammo. From your history, it looks like you're in the prairies or else i'd say come out to my range and put some rounds through mine.  Rod from Civil Advantage had over 10,000 rounds through his before it finally quit on him earlier this year."

I asked a local guy at my range about them and he said that they were great for what they are, and that he has one and really likes his. Then he said, ""In retrospect I think I should've just bought something a little more higher end  to begin with and save myself the upgrade down the road"".  It's all just different ways to look at it I guess. I've been a subscriber to your YouTube channel for a while now.  That Canada Ammo end of world special unboxing video is a classic.

Now I know that /r/canadaguns has a real chip on its shoulder about police officers having special firearms rules for them, and many seem to suffer from Oppositional Defiance Disorder, but I agree with  /u/echo_61 in I also do not think that a law was broken here.

Apply for PAL  Hopefully recieve PAL  Buy guns  While you will need to renew your license (PAL) every 5 years, you don't need to take the CFSC again; it's like a drivers license, you dont have to take the road test again, you just have to pay to maintain your privledges."

canadaguns,3bc23p,AdiposeFin,2,Mon Jun 29 05:07:40 2015 UTC,Note that carrying a concealed weapon is not.  Which means if you have a sword cane you can't just pack it around with you on a day to day basis.
canadaguns,3bc23p,alkali_feldspar,1 point,Mon Jun 29 05:08:48 2015 UTC,"Yes, sword canes are legal to sell/own because they're over 30cm. Note that the 30cm restriction applies to the object, not the blade - a 65cm cane containing a 15cm knife is fine.   That said, you probably shouldn't carry one around, as it's hard to rationalize one as a useful tool."

So, you say that, but:  The amount of gun crime committed by licensed RPAL holders is pretty much nil.  The amount of handgun crime that has been traced back to legally owned handguns is pretty much nil.  Handgun crime in Canada is almost exclusively the domain of handguns illegally smuggled in from the US.  You can whine all you want about having to jump through hoops, but Canada's handgun laws have been doing a pretty fine job.  Our issue is the failure of the United States to enact similar restrictions."

It makes zero sense for me to not be able to get a handgun in .25 or .32 calibre (I know there are exceptions but this is the general rule).

Then shotguns / lever actions are what's left and they find an excuse to get those prohibited as well.  All because they don't think you ""need"" one.

While any classifications that happen during a Liberal government are strictly the realm of Those Dastardly Liberals™),  and most of the laws that people love to bitch about the most weren't enacted by the Liberals either.  There has been a Liberal government in power 60% of the time for the last 50 years:  We still own plenty of guns, in case you haven't noticed, and the number is on the rise.  Not trying to single you out, because it's not just you, but getting pretty tired of the usual unsubstantiated reactionary garbage and it's not even the height of election season yet."

Considering the NDP thinks we are shooing extinct dinosaurs with .223rem and both the NDP and Liberal party have made overtures in the past and recently about banning handguns and semi automatic ""military style"" rifles what do you think is going to happen?  The Liberal leader is worried about people packing heat in Canadian tire parking lots, reality is a hard thing to grasp for those two parties.  These people are pissed that gun owners exist, and the fact we have been slowly rolling back some of the shitty regulations.  Once in power they are going to try to make our lives miserable for owning property they deem we do not ""need"".  More importantly to them they see us as the ""enemy"" as we have been helped by the CPC, thus will come down on all of us hard as they think we are all conservatives and supporters (as naturally no NDP / Liberal voter owns an AR15 or a Tavor or XCR right?).  They will be assisted naturally as much as possible by the RCMP brass as well, as those dudes are fuckin pissed at us and are more than willing to assist them in their goals under the guise of ""Keeping Canadians safe"".  In the past NDP / Liberal party members had no problems tossing there own voters they represented under the bus for future political gains (cough cough Charlie Angus).  Making back room deals and suddenly miraculously being for something one day, and completely against it the next (I.e gun registry).  Both parties are not to be trusted but I trust the NDP the least due to the fact they campaigned on removing the gun registry in the 90's an had a change of heart when it came to actually doing something about it."

You get there, thinking the suspect might jump out of any shadow, so you pull your gun out of the holster and for some stupid reason put your finger on the trigger instead of on the frame, and in the excitement pull the trigger.  Stupid, we all agree.  But I can use a bit of empathy here.  Also, what kind of holster was it?  I've seen some local RCMP using a Safariland ALS versus the Safariland 070.  So maybe there is a training issue there.  I've also seen some wearing SERPA holsters.  The SERPA is an inherently dangerous design.

canadaguns,3bdtlj,CreateBread,7,Sun Jun 28 07:58:59 2015 UTC,"Negative Ghostrider, that would be illegal.  From Gryphon Energetics -  The Explosives Regulatory Division (http://www.nrcan.gc.ca/explosives/of...oratories/9921) of Natural Resources Canada is the government agency responsible for controlling and regulating the manufacture, import, sale, and use of all explosives in Canada. They occasionally create new regulations or amend old ones to fit the products and practices of the modern day. The Explosives Act and Explosives Regulations are the two pieces of legislation that give the force of law to the control of explosives in Canada.  It was determined several years ago that the Explosives Regulations were becoming severely outdated and did not provide for the introduction of new and novel explosive products that were being seen on the world market. Among them were the recently developed binary exploding rifle targets. ERD undertook a rewrite of the Explosives Regulations with consultation from stakeholders and industry. The result was the repealing of the Explosives Regulations and replacement with the Explosives Regulations, 2013 (http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/r...211/index.html). These new regulations took effect February 1, 2014.  Section 138 reads as follows:  Multi-ingredient kits   (1) A person who complies with subsection (2) may mix together the ingredients of a multi-ingredient kit.   (2) The person who carries out the activity must ensure that the following requirements are met:  (a) the kit must be on the list of authorized Footnote *explosives referred to in subsection 41(1);  (b) the mixing must be carried out at the place where the explosive to be manufactured will be used;  (c) precautions that minimize the likelihood of an ignition must be taken;  (d) if the explosive to be manufactured is classified as type F.3, the person mixing the ingredients must hold a fireworks operator certificate — pyrotechnician; and  (e) if the explosive to be manufactured is a special purpose explosive, the person mixing the ingredients must hold a fireworks operator certificate — pyrotechnician or a licence issued under the Firearms Act.  Note: Section 10 provides that a person must be at least 18 years old to carry out an Footnote *activity involving an explosive.  Note Subsection 2(e) states that for a special purpose explosive a user can hold a valid license under the Firearms Act - i.e. your PAL. This section was purposely written to permit for the introduction of binary exploding rifle targets.  So does that mean I can make my own exploding targets now?  No. Note that Subsection 2(a) above states that the product must be on the List of Authorized Explosives. Authorizing an explosive is a complicated and precise process whereby ERD will review an application and only authorize it if all conditions for that explosive type are met. It includes a detailed breakdown of all chemicals used in the product, bilingual labeling that follows specific guidelines for safety, reliability testing, etc. It is all done with the aim to keep dangerous and unsafe explosives off the market and as a result, Canada has one of the safest explosives industries and lowest rates of accidents and injuries in the world.  Manufacturing explosives is not something that should be undertaken by amateurs without extensive training and knowledge. You may put your life and property at risk as well as those around you. Please do not attempt to manufacture your own explosives."

I didn't notice that the one picture that was missing was of the back side of the receiver, well when the gun showed up the dickhead had scratched his name into it. The guy disappeared from the site and never answered my pm's about it, he was a cop too apparently.   What kind of asshole scratches his name into a gun, especially one like the model 94. If I ever run into someone with that name he's getting a swift kick to the nuts, the name is scratched into my memory now and will never leave. I guess it's still better than never seeing the gun at all though, I feel for you."

I have used interact a couple of times, both sending and receiving.  When I received money I had to choose what account to put it into.  I'm not sure if you bypass the bank entirely.  The other thing I wonder about, is the possibility of setting up the transfer, and waiting until the gun is shipped before providing the password to finish it.  How easy is it to cancel a transfer once it's started?  Might be nice to have some sort of escrow service that would handle the transfer of the money once the goods are received."

I later found a facebook page dedicated to the guy, who scammed others. His photo, address (residential), I had his email, his other mailing addy, etc.   I opened a case with the Police, and was told ""That's a small town, so the OPP deals with it"" I called the OPP, who told me ""The money was sent from your town, so your Police are the ones who should deal with it""  and so I was bounced back and forth. At one point I just got mad, sarcastically emailed the detective saying, ""I bet if it was a Bank that was scammed out of some $$ even overseas, you'd have no problem helping out"" and just left it there."

A older Sharps rolling block, single shot, will use the .40-90, as well as some newer production (1980's) rifles.  It's a black powder buffalo cartridge, that was developed after the buffalo had been decimated. They are capable of pretty good accuracy with moderate loads."

To some people a single boy being shot 10 years ago is enough of a reason, personally I'd call that an anecdote rather than a reason.

The vast majority of men between the ages of 20 and 30 are conscripted into the militia and undergo military training, including weapons training. The personal weapons of the militia are kept at home as part of the military obligations. However, it is generally not permitted to keep army-issued ammunition (compatible ammunition purchased privately by the individual is still permitted); Switzerland thus has one of the highest gun ownership rates in the world.  In recent times a minority of political opposition has expressed a desire for tighter gun regulations.  A referendum in February 2011 rejected stricter gun control.

canadaguns,3b6v9x,airchinapilot,3,Fri Jun 26 14:43:05 2015 UTC,I use the moulded plugs and Oakley eyes and love them both. Only time I use muffs over the plugs is if you're shooting in a covered shed and someone is beside you with big caliber rifles.
canadaguns,3b6v9x,cdnmr,3,Fri Jun 26 16:37:38 2015 UTC,"I have a few sets of the molded plugs (get a free pair at work every year), and they work great.

Going to check out Select Shooting Supplies in Cambridge after the range as they list a nice selection of glasses/plugs on their site and been meaning to try a new LGS.  Have a pair of Fuel Cells and Gascans but can't afford 3rd or 4th pairs for shooting.  If I can buy a gun for the cost of the glasses, chances are I'm getting another gun."

canadaguns,3b6v9x,BeaverNutz,2,Fri Jun 26 17:46:34 2015 UTC,"You don't know her family. Booze (and the inability to handle ones self while under its influence) is a major issue. As well as jealousy, bitterness, and generally not being fit for public consumption. Last time we took her mom out for dinner I ended up leaving because she was being belligerent and racist towards the servers. It's embarrassing, and she isn't even my mother!"

I've been with my fiancee for 14 years and can say she is nothing at all like her mother (except both are really good cooks). It's a case of ""we know who the father is, just not sure about the mother."" - Sorry....that was a bad dad joke from my Irish father."

I took a look at the price and was surprised because I thought they would not be as far off as they are. People ask me when I'm going to move back and between the same or lower nominal wages (i.e., the NUMBER of dollars, not the VALUE of the dollars), the insane property prices, the huge tax load and then on top of that the freaking high price for one of my two hobbies I say ""Yeah, no time soon.""

Do you know the serial number of your bicycle, smart phone, television or camera?   How would the police be able to list the item as stolen on CPIC without them?  It's not that hard to have a little notebook you write down your serial numbers in it.  Keep it with your tax returns, mortgage papers and life insurance policy.  When you get a new item, including guns, write it down in the little notebook.  IF these things ever get stolen from you, you can tell the police the serial number and maybe one great day they will find it and return it to you."

The fact that you're here posting about it makes me believe you will be reciting those acronyms like they were your new religion.  The first time is pretty interesting, handling some metal.. it's not difficult.  You will feel super awkward but don't rush through it.  Ask questions if you have them.  Don't worry so much about how it feels or how you're holding it.  Concern yourself with the aspects of safety involved in handling a gun and focus on that.   Always assume a firearm is loaded Control the muzzle direction at all times  Trigger - keep your fat finger off it See the firearm is unloaded - PROVE it safe       Point the firearm in a safe direction Remove all magazines Observe the chamber and ensure it is empty Verify the feeding path is clear of any ammunition or obstruction Examine the bore to ensure there is no obstruction   The best part of my PAL course was when this one dude could not handle looking down the bore of the gun.  His glasses were all screwed up and sideways on his face and he was flustered, just could not bring himself to do it.  He proved to himself that the firearm was unloaded and in its current situation wouldn't be loaded, but just didn't do well at the end of a barrel.  In that case they allowed him to use a bore cleaning rod to achieve the same result.  You didn't ask for it but my personal opinion is, if you can't look down the end of your gun, how are you going to do when you're out in the woods.. or at the range, getting sweeped by noobs?

canadaguns,3b493i,icedesparten,3,Sat Jun 27 00:43:33 2015 UTC,"This is a bit long, but I'm not really awake enough to try editing it down.  As far as functional classification, you've basically got four meaningful criteria:   Action type (bolt/pump/semi/auto/etc.) Caliber Cartridge type (non-cartridge/rimfire/centerfire) Fireable OAL   Everything else is pretty much a red herring.  Caliber is unimportant except perhaps on the upper end - it's reasonable to regulate a cannon differently than a pistol/rifle/shotgun, but there's no reason to separate a 9mm from a .45 or a 30-06 from a 5.56mm.  Action type can basically be divided into auto, semi-auto and everything else.  Separating rifles and pistols is largely unnecessary, because any pistol will by nature fall under any OAL limit that could conceivably apply to rifles.  There seems to be a relative consensus that FA guns should remain prohibited.  It's silly, but I agree that it's politically necessary.  Likewise, a fireable OAL restriction is probably among the more reasonable measures, in part because it neatly addresses the pistol/long gun classification - you simply have short guns and long guns, with an unambiguous measurement dividing them.  The OAL restriction should probably be either 26"" or 24"".    While it might be necessary to keep the ""sawn-off"" rule, the text should be clarified to indicate that part substitutions do not qualify: there's no reason why short-barreled guns or short guns in general should be limited to factory original offerings, so people should be able to swap in a shorter barrel or stock without that being a major legal issue.  Some people will argue that this creates problems with the existing or proposed classification scheme, but the same issue is present for people who register only an action or who assemble a firearm from a bare action and that doesn't seem to have caused any harm.  By the same token, the prohibition of bullpup stocks has to go - it's pointless, because any idiot with a hacksaw can obrezificate a gun in an hour or two.  Either way, it would be simpler and preferable to simply have a single length distinction and skip the sawn-off business entirely: a ""good"" gun owner will register the firearm and be in compliance the same way they would be if it were a factory piece, while a criminal will not register it, and can still be prosecuted because they now have an unregistered restricted firearm.  No matter how magazine restrictions are handled, they come out problematic.  There's no excuse to give up the existing rimfire capacity or non-semi-auto capacity without getting something big in return, because those are clearly the intent of the law and not some kind of unintentional ""loophole"" like the 5/10 or Beowulf issues.  Upping the centerfire limit to 10 for all centerfire firearms is an absolute minimum, because that brings us into accord with the more restrictive U.S. states and that size is widely available - as mentioned, that also eliminates the 5/10 issue.  On the other hand, it's impossible to eliminate the Beowulf issue without some very problematic and risky language.  From a public safety perspective, the core issue with capacity restrictions is that not only can any idiot with a dremel unpin a magazine, any idiot with a basement (or a 3d printer) can make their own no problem.  It's ridiculous to suggest that capacity restrictions will actually stop mass shooters, so it's better to talk about how to make changes palatable to people less familiar with the situation: perhaps suggest the possibility of a 10rd maximum but allowing higher capacity magazines as restricted devices.  Again, reinforce the fact that any idiot can convert, extend or even scratch-build a magazine - if anything, it's a relatively ""easy"" concession they could make that would make most gun owners incredibly happy.  At least personally, I'd be comfortable giving up NR non-semi >10 centerfire mags and even possibly NR >10 rimfire mags if that created a truly homogeneous standard which would eliminate all of the BS and confusion while allowing 10rd mags for general use and at least basic access to >10rd mags for things like IPSC.  (That said, no real reason to give up the existing rimfire exemption unless absolutely necessary - as far as distinctions go it's one of the least ambiguous and easiest to understand.)  Thus, I would suggest:   Prohibited: Full-auto firearms, explosive/incendiary ammunition etc. Restricted: All firearms <24""/26"", centerfire magazines >10rds. Non-Restricted: All firearms >24""/26"", all other magazines.   It's incredibly simple, eliminates 90% of the loopholes and confusion, but still doesn't throw the floodgates open in any meaningful manner.  As a separate point, I would strongly argue that the non-firearm prohibited weapons should be dumped in their entirety.  There's no public safety rationale or factual basis for the chosen items, and despite many of them being trivial to manufacture they're nonexistent in criminal use.  Nobody is running around with nunchaku, manrikigusari, shuriken, bladed rings, pistol crossbows, morningstars, blowguns or balisongs, and frankly nobody ever was - some idiot in the legislature was up too late one night watching ninja movies and was short on talking points for his riding, but common sense needs to kick in at some point.  The only possible exceptions there might be tear gas etc. and stun guns/tasers."

Handguns with barrels shorter than 100 mm (instead of the current 105 mm limit).  (This would allow Glock compacts.) ""Sawed-off"" rifles or shotguns (I'm OK with existing criteria of ""barrel length is less than 457 mm [17.99""] or their overall length is less than 660 mm [25.98""]"", but if you want to drop barrel length to 16"", say, explain why you think this would be A Good Thing). Any reasonable functional criteria to ban ""Saturday Night Specials"" other than just the .25 or .32 calibre rule.  (Anyone know more about what criteria could be used for these instead of this calibre rule?) Any magazine whose capacity is more than 10, for any firearm.  (Get rid of the 5/10 discrepancy, get rid of the ""rifle that takes a handgun calibre"" loophole, get rid of the ""100-round mag for .22, woo-hoo!"" loophole.) Leave the existing regs for non-firearm prohibited weapons (e.g. switchblades and brass knuckles).   Restricted   All handguns. Get rid of the rule making ""semi-automatic, centre-fire rifles and shotguns with a barrel shorter than 470 mm [18.504""]"" restricted.  (Doesn't this technically mean that any rifle/shotgun with an 18.5"" barrel is automatically restricted?  And if so, why?  18.5"" is a very common barrel length, why should it be restricted?)"
canadaguns,3b493i,xXWaspXx,9,Thu Jun 25 21:15:34 2015 UTC,"100-round mag for .22, woo-hoo!"" loophole.   This isn't a loophole.

These people are convinced that magazine limits are critical parts of a system that would ""prevent"" (or at least minimise the body count from) mass shootings.  I don't think it's currently politically feasible to completely get rid of all magazine limits.  And as for .22 rimfire, I'm not a pathological maniac, but give me a .22 with a 100-round magazine filled with hollowpoints and I could probably ""beat"" the tallies for Polytechnique or Sandy Hook.

canadaguns,3b493i,svodiwuejkxlkadfuiop,0,Thu Jun 25 23:25:46 2015 UTC,"It's me trying to understand all sides of the issue.  In an ideal world, no one would give a crap how big your magazine is.  ;)  In the world we live in, gun control activists look at the 2011 Tucson shooting and note that the shooter was stopped when he tried to change magazines; but he'd already caused a lot of damage because he had a 33-round magazine, and used those 33 rounds to kill 6 and wound 13.   Even before 2011, ""high-capacity magazines"" were a big target of gun control activists; note that the US federal ""assault weapon"" ban of 1994-2004 (which was itself inspired by the 1989 Stockton schoolyard shooting in which the shooter killed 5 children and wounded 29 children and 1 teacher, although I can't find out what size magazine he used) instituted a size limit of 10 for magazines for centre-fire long guns and handguns, and that limit persists in places like California.  So I ""get"" where the gun control people are coming from in terms of their demands for magazine size limits.  And after Tucson, it's gotten harder to argue against them; while that shooting was just one data point, it looms large in their minds.  I don't think it is politically feasible today to remove magazine size limits in Canada.  It might be possible to get the centre-fire long gun limit raised to 10.  Putting a limit on rimfire magazines might help that goal.  I appreciate everyone's contributions here.  I'm no expert, but I'll do what I can to make what improvements can be made, and to prevent more stupid and arbitrary laws and regulations."
canadaguns,3b493i,svodiwuejkxlkadfuiop,5,Fri Jun 26 01:23:26 2015 UTC,"The problem with magazine laws is that pinning a mag doesn't prevent a bad guy from unpinning it. I recognize that it sounds like a good idea to people that don't understand anything about firearms, but it really isn't a good idea. Bad guys are going to bypass magazine limits, end of story.   The shitty thing is that if the people calling for magazine limits really understood that, they would still want the limits implemented somehow, which probably isn't realistic, and would morph into some other shitty arbitrary restriction.

canadaguns,3b2lbf,Wanhope,1 point,Thu Jun 25 15:09:22 2015 UTC,"Yes, so the 47 version hadn't been classified yet, thus had no FRT.

On top of problems with finishes, their products are also plagued with other quality control issues such as poorly finished parts, broken parts, mechanical issues, safeties that cause the firearms to go off unintentionally, and other problems.  The Savage rifles have a strong reputation, and I have owned a number or them including an 111 Trophy Hunter XP in 30-06. I loved that rifle, and if you pick a Savage I'm sure you'll love it too."

canadaguns,3b4tsa,alkali_feldspar,2,Fri Jun 26 05:31:36 2015 UTC,"IMO the use of the M305 is the historical connection and the fun of a cheap-ish semi-auto magazine-fed large-caliber rifle.

Solid rifles to check out, Savage 11 or Axis, Weatherby Vanguard - there was a package with blind mag and scope for $600 a few years back, don't know if that's still around.

RCMP Fucktards  d. RCMP Shitpuppets  (Correct answer is of course 'b'.  Many may have been fooled by 'd' but that just means you watch too much TPB)
canadaguns,3b38x2,cdnmr,5,Thu Jun 25 22:02:39 2015 UTC,Definition of a variant:  Any fucking thing the RCMP deems a variant.  Hopefully that's changing with the new bill passed.
canadaguns,3b38x2,Styrak,2,Thu Jun 25 19:35:02 2015 UTC,"In the section with the show and the phone caller, you hear the host say, well the RCMP should be in charge. Which, in theory, sure, that makes sense. But in practicality, if the RCMP doesn't like people having guns, and why would they? Then it's easy for them to just say, everything is banned. It doesn't hurt them in any way, they still get their guns, they don't care if the general public doesn't like it, they aren't elected officials, and it might lead to one less murder a year in a round about way.  Why would you trust them in making a fair decision on classification? They gain nothing by letting things be non restricted.   When I hear about ""its with the RCMP lab, for them to determine classification""  I just think of 2 things, one; they ""Lab"" guys are there just shooting every type of cool gun, for free, as much as they want, and that's considered work. ""Hey, we need another 1k rounds of 7.62 to make sure this ak is still prohib. Holding back giddy laughter*"", ""it's very serious pew pew pew business""  Oh two; it's like when I worked retail in high school and an annoying customer would insist you check the back for an item. You would go back there for 5 minutes, shoot the shit with a fellow employee, then come out, ""sorry, we don't have any back here""  Just the RCMP is saying ""oh yeah, that's a restricted for sure."" Because they are clearly just glancing at the firearm, not actually looking into how it functions and what it's capable of.   As all of us know. The only ones that are being stopped by any of this, is the ones that follow the law. Because if you have bad intentions and want an ak47.. You can get an ak47. The RCMP isn't stopping that, they are stoping the people who have good intentions of use, and want to follow the laws."

I'd run the PRS or the MDT Skeleton if it's ever in stock.  If you're serious about a precision rifle build then definitely go with an adjustable stock.  If you're just plinking from a bench then go with whatever.      Perfect comb height and length of pull is very important for precision shooting.  Being uncomfortable while laying behind the gun will cause you to tense up and make it impossible to get any consistency with your shooting platform.  In turn, that could throw your shots off target and make it very hard to print sub-MOA groups.  When you lay behind that gun, you should have instant perfect site picture without any fiddling around and be comfortable enough to lay there all day.  An adjustable stock will allow you to have that.  Alternatively if the stock you pick can't adjust LOP then you can move your scope back and forth in the rings and on the rail until you get that perfect eye relief without shadows but you will have to level it again and it's a pain in the ass compared to getting a proper stock.  Your elbow will also probably support you at an uncomfortable angle if the stock is too long.  You can fix both of those with an adjustable LOP but stocks like the ACS and CTR have fixed positions where the PRS and MDT are infinitely adjustable within their ranges.      If the stock can adjust LOP but not comb height like the other stocks you're looking at, then you'll need to buy riser pieces and use the old method of building it up with foam, moleskin, leather, and/or a wood block.  You want your face to rest perfectly on the stock.  You'll know it's right when you lay behind it, look through the scope, close your eyes and count to 10, open them again.  You shouldn't need to move your eye, it should still be looking perfectly at your reticule.      This might all sound ridiculous to the average person but this is how you setup a precision rifle.  Realistically any shoulder fired weapon actually but it's more important for precision rifles to be as perfect as possible.      As for the LSS, I wouldn't do it.  It's nice as a little hunting chassis but the problem with it is it's not as stable as your typical precision setup.  The bipod mounts too close to the shooter and the AR15 stock compatibility increases it's base LOP by quite a bit.  If you're set on going with MDT then consider the LSS-XL or the HS3.  Both use a proper fixed stock attachment for the Skeleton or PRS which is shorter than the regular LSS.  The LSS also requires a fixed stock adapter if you want to run the Skeleton or PRS making it even longer.  Both the XL and HS3 also have a proper length fore end so the bipod can mount further out.  Having the bipod mount closer to the shooter means any movements you make behind the gun are bigger at the muzzle.  The LSS-XL and HS3 are much more stable platforms.      You should also look at the XLR Element and the Cadex Field Strike.  All roughly the same price once you buy all the same pieces except for the Cadex which is a little bit more expensive.  But a precision rifle is a buy once, cry once type deal.  Wait for the extra pay cheques and buy the right thing from the beginning.  I'm still running the shitty stock that came on my R700 AAC except with some modifications.  I filled the stock with epoxy and added an adjustable riser for comb height.  It'll work until I decide what to do for a replacement."

canadaguns,3b3kxw,Prettyniceguytoo,1 point,Fri Jun 26 20:15:59 2015 UTC,"The 30cm rule comes from this:   Any device having a length of less than 30 cm and resembling an innocuous object but designed to conceal a knife or blade, including the device commonly known as the “knife-comb”, being a comb with the handle of the comb forming a handle for the knife, and any similar device.   In other words, a knife-comb (<30cm) is a prohibited weapon, but a cane sword (>30cm) is not.  Presumably, this is because it's a lot harder to generally conceal something more than a foot long, and because you can pretty easily beat someone over the head with a cane even if it doesn't have an added pointy bonus inside.  That all having been said, the RCMP is flat-out wrong on this one: despite having the form factor of a credit card, the CardSharp doesn't at all ""resembl[e] an innocuous object,"" since it's quite obvious to anyone looking at it that it's a knife and not a credit card.

canadaguns,3b3kxw,MangoYogenFruz,2,Sat Jun 27 03:11:49 2015 UTC,"This brags up a lot of questions about knifes in canada. What is considered a concealed weapon? Is a Swiss Army knife in my pockets a concealed weapon? Is my multitool in its pouch a concealed weapon? If I have a 2 inch folding knife from Canadian tire in my coat pocked? If I wear a 3 inch fixed blade on my belt at the back in case I need to cut a gas line under a truck to mask my scent from a super Dino concealed? Can I have a fixed buck knife hanging from my belt?   I understand as soon as I commit a crime its instantly a weapon. But what are the ""rules"" if I get stopped by the police during a random search? They said ""under 30cm"" so is a machete ok to walk around with?"
canadaguns,3b3kxw,Kentzfield,2,Thu Jun 25 19:00:05 2015 UTC,"The article misstates the law.  The law the RNC is relying on relates to knives designed to ""resembl[e] an innocuous object"" but ""conceal a knife or blade"" - things like lipstick knives or comb knives, but not sword canes or other long (>30cm) objects.  The CardSharp in question shouldn't qualify, as it was not designed to conceal its nature and is really quite obviously a knife.  Designed to be conveniently carried in a credit card slot =/= designed to resemble an innocuous credit card.  While it's not enshrined in statute, Canadian precedent has largely been that for the ""concealed weapon"" statute to apply you have to be intentionally taking steps to conceal it (i.e. your coat inadvertently dropping over it wouldn't count) and be concealing it for a nefarious purpose.  Until it's used as a weapon (or it can be proven that you intended to use it as a weapon) a knife is a tool, and there's no law against carrying concealed tools even if they are of a type that could potentially be used as a weapon.  Edit: Doesn't mean the police can't still make your life miserable, but a judge should throw it out unless you're carrying a claymore for ""cutting boxes"" or something."

canadaguns,3b3kxw,ctcsupplies,3,Sat Jun 27 01:39:31 2015 UTC,"Read my post please. Canada knife laws are based on intent, and concealed laws are even weirder. Basically sword canes over 30cm are legal to own (concealed blade) but you'll probably get slapped with carrying a concealed weapon (not owning one) if you're in public with it. The under 30cm concealed are prohibited to own."

canadaguns,3b3kxw,derpyou,0,Thu Jun 25 23:26:11 2015 UTC,"Ok guys let me clarify this one. Credit card knives (knives that look like credit cards) are prohibited because they are concealed. As in literally a blade inside something that says visa etc. Some of the ones you find on amazon with the blade visible are not because the blade is showing, hence not concealed. (you must own it for the purpose of cutting boxes). Not sure where they found the picture of the black one, but that doesn't fit the legal definition of a concealed knife.  The hard card shaped multitools are a grey area. The clear ones are not concealed, again because you can see the knife, but the opaque ones are a grey area so I would stay away from those.   Regular multitools and regular folding knives are still fine, proceed as usual. (I own it for cutting boxes and fixing things etc.)"
canadaguns,3b3kxw,AdiposeFin,5,Thu Jun 25 19:00:28 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily - you would have to prove that the credit card knife is a weapon and not a tool.  CCC Section 90   Carrying concealed weapon    (1) Every person commits an offence who carries a weapon, a prohibited device or any prohibited ammunition concealed, unless the person is authorized under the Firearms Act to carry it concealed.    Is a credit card knife a ""weapon"", not necessary because it would be based on intent, if I carry a credit card knife for opening boxes, that would not be a weapon."

I'm sure importation is complicated and requires a lot of ducks in a row but I felt really left in the dark and cheesed off.

I've heard really good things about the savage mkII, but I haven't shot one myself. I went with the cz because it's got such a nice wood stock."

The law treated every person equally at the time that it was enacted.   Dumb law, but not infringing on equality.  EDIT: Your mistake is in thinking laws are writen as the comandments were scripted in the bible "" thou shalt not own cool guns"".

I just think it still infringes on equality   You don't understand, because my point is that it doesn't equate to inequality. The law it's self has the exceptions written into it, and is applied to everyone equally. Your argument that it's discrimination because you are not included in the list of exceptions doesn't make sense. If all things were equal in the sense that there were no exceptions to laws, nobody would have prohibited firearms; in fact nobody would do or have much of anything, because restrictions are placed on all matter of things using this same principal of law. When they write the laws they want to minimize loopholes, so they don't write them as ""X is legal unless ..."" they write them as "" X is unlawful (illegal) unless .... "" and in doing so, they limit the number of people that can argue "" but the law says I can have a machine gun and  X  is why I feel the exceptions don't apply to me""   as for a grace period, there's not really a reason to offer one. they made the firearms illegal to own, they are under no obligation to give everyone notice that they have 60 days to jump on the loophole. however laws don't pass overnight without a bunch of readings and debate, anyone who was of age and payed attention politics would have known that they were debating a law to prohibit the firearms, and would have had some time to decide if they wanted to roll the dice on whether or not in the aftermath they would be able to keep their automatics.   you can't make changes without stepping on a few feet, this time it's just our feet that got trampled."

Edit: I wan't to be clear that I feel a list of prohibited weapons is ridiculous, I'm not arguing for the law, just that your case for a human rights case won't hold water.

The nature of the registry meant that at least some of the information could be requested through the AIA (in redacted form, of course).  Naturally, when it became clear that the long gun registry was going to go belly-up a bunch of people filed AIA requests in the hopes of ""preserving"" as much of the data as possible, and the government seems to have responded by pushing the RCMP to destroy the data anyways.  Technically, that wasn't legal, but the government then basically legislated retroactive immunity for it - while in that case they were closing a loophole, it sets a troublesome precedent for certain other cases where it would have been less justifiable.  Here we have a similar situation with the Quebec registry data, which was originally preserved because of questions as to whether Quebec could keep it for use in a new provincial analogue (the answer turned out to be ""no, you can't""), and similar worries about the data being destroyed.  The court's response was to demand a copy of the data, ensuring that the data wouldn't be destroyed until all legal issues were fully resolved."
canadaguns,3axvlk,carasci,-3,Wed Jun 24 16:58:15 2015 UTC,"Totally destroying the registry data was a stupid idea. Striped of personal information this data can be useful for historians, statisticians, future gun debates, etc."

canadaguns,3ayyc5,ThundercockIII,3,Wed Jun 24 16:57:52 2015 UTC,I prefer small loop lever after using a large one.  The large ones are meant for gloves. There's to much extra room for a large loop and seems to add more stress to the first finger as it's the first to run the action before the rest. Just an observation from running it personally and comments I heard from people using it.

canadaguns,3ay940,alkali_feldspar,2,Wed Jun 24 13:56:25 2015 UTC,"Receiver is the ""firearm"" and regardless of state of build, still has to follow all the same rules as any other n/r. Do whatever you want with the barrel and stock.   Fun fact: a stripped lower ar15 receiver with no trigger, or guts inside, still counts as a restricted weapon and must be treated as such by law."
canadaguns,3ay940,AltC,-1,Wed Jun 24 15:54:58 2015 UTC,"Unless you remove the firing pins or disable the shotgun in a way (taking apart a gun doesn't count), you still need trigger locks on the gun when storing. As for transportation... what are you asking?"
canadaguns,3ay940,XSlor,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:54:08 2015 UTC,I guess I wondered if breaking down was the equivalent of removing the bolt  and it appears that is not the case. Older cases don't seem to have provisions for locks either as far as I have seen.
canadaguns,3ay940,AdiposeFin,2,Wed Jun 24 17:06:53 2015 UTC,"Here is the exact wording.  While the wording is clear about needing to have the bad half of the gun locked up, I too wonder if a judge would see a dissembled hinge gun as rendered inoperable."
canadaguns,3ay940,Nonrandomhero,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:17:08 2015 UTC,"IANAL. A non restricted firearm doesn't need to be locked while transporting it. Keep it out of sight and vehicle locked if you are not in the car.   If you mean in the case for storing it in your home, then yes put a trigger lock on it and call it a day. But I wouldn't  sore it in a case with foam for long term storage. The foam holds moisture and that will lead to damage to the gun.   If you have room pick up a gun cabinet or safe for storage. Even better if you keep that in a locked closet."
canadaguns,3ay940,XSlor,0,Thu Jun 25 04:44:06 2015 UTC,"yeah, as far as I know, breaking down a gun doesn't count. I'm pretty certain, for instance, a lower AR receiver is still considered a restricted item and must be treated accordingly - with trigger lock and in a case or in a safe w/o trigger lock. Same with pistols and other guns. Our laws are weird, aren't they?"

I have zero experience shooting at distance (or with a scope), but after sighting it in I put my last 4 shots right in the bullseye (all holes touching) at 100 yards on a gusty day. Couldn't believe it. That was using cheap Winchester target loads too.   Not saying it's the best, but as far as value for your money I am very impressed. It is also my first bolt action, so take that for what you will."
canadaguns,3aye0w,Gremlin87,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:43:35 2015 UTC,I second the vanguard s2. It's got a nice trigger and the synthetic stock is sturdy with nice grippy spots for handling.   The action is actually a howa made in Japan that weatherby purchases and puts their stock and name on.
canadaguns,3aye0w,DogfoodEnforcer,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:40:16 2015 UTC,I tried out a few when I bought this one. The others were too light and I like a bit of heft to my rifles since I don't hunt and usually shoot from a bench. The Vanguard was nice and weighty (in a good way).  I got the rifle and added a vortex diamondback HP scope (with leupold 2-piece mount and rings) and everything came in under $1200 including tax.

According to him, most of the Enfields that were sent in for service, or otherwise busted by the Rangers were because of bent barrels - bent from using them to lever out stuck Snowmobiles.   I genuinely wonder if something like this will stand up to the rough and ready lifestyles led by northern Canadians. For one, a plastic stock would have been a better choice in an environment where moisture and temperature swings (going in and out of warmth and into arctic conditions) will be large and frequent.   The Canadian Rangers require a hunting rifle for survival and self defence against large North American carnivores at ranges of 0 metres to 300 metres   No wonder they didn't bother with an optic.    6500 Rifles to be produced.   Fuck, they could've bought a few cases of SKS - and then a few more for spares and parts - and called it a day. Cheaper certainly, and probably more reliable."

That cartridge is by definition not as accurate, or effective at range as the .308 Winchester.

canadaguns,3avxci,BeaverNutz,1 point,Wed Jun 24 13:33:10 2015 UTC,If you really want a lever gun I would go with a 45/70 as for big bore lever guns it still has ammo availibilty it's not cheap but it exists. Marlin or winchester although I'm not sure on marlins new production guns.
canadaguns,3avxci,adaminc,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:10:07 2015 UTC,I think your best bet will be a Zastava M70 (M98) in 375HH or 458 Win... the rifles are sub $1000... they have a wonderful Mauser action... here's a great youtube review. tradeexcanada has usually a good selection of these... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOgfgEbRdRQ

canadaguns,3auzhs,hatfullofjimmy,4,Tue Jun 23 18:48:16 2015 UTC,"I'm probably the least qualified to answer but I'll give it a shot.  Gun laws are federal, so not much will differ in between provinces aside from where it's legal to shoot.  You'd need an RPAL to purchase/build an AR15, as far as I know, as it's a restricted firearm. AK's are prohibited, so tough luck owning one (unless you get a lookalike).  I'm assuming you took a look at http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/cfp-pcaf/fs-fd/storage-entreposage-eng.htm regarding storage/transport? Is there anything in particular you'd like me to try explain?"

canadaguns,3auzhs,alkali_feldspar,2,Tue Jun 23 19:17:09 2015 UTC,"Possible, but you can only shoot them at the range, so why bother since 300 blk is going to be way more expensive than 223."
canadaguns,3auzhs,alkali_feldspar,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:21:22 2015 UTC,well i love the idea of being able to switch the upper and have 2 calibres in the one package
canadaguns,3auzhs,-bk,3,Tue Jun 23 19:32:11 2015 UTC,"Yep, you can do that. You can also look at the Robinson Arms XCR. It's a multi-caliber rifle, but can be non-restricted so you can use it for hunting or on crown land. See: http://www.wolverinesupplies.com/Products/firearms/rifles/firearm-rifle-tactical"
canadaguns,3auzhs,achwas,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:40:36 2015 UTC,thanks :)
canadaguns,3auzhs,Jobbo_Fett,2,Tue Jun 23 19:44:41 2015 UTC,"Getting your RPAL is very a very similar process. It sounds like it'd be most efficient for you to go for both your PAL and your RPAL at the same time, based on what you'd like to own.  I took my CFSC/CRFSC together (the courses required before you can apply for your PAL/RPAL, unless you challenge the courses which is an option that is disappearing soon) at Silvercore. Take a look at http://silvercore.ca/courses/canadian-firearms-safety-course-slash-canadian-restricted-firearms-safety-course as it's a comprehensive knowledge/practical course that'll explain the basics of what you can/can't do in Canada with firearms.  And, just to make sure this is clear, firearms owners are responsible for using common sense in interpreting and keeping up to date with Canadian firearms laws. If you ever have any questions, certainly ask someone (whether it be the course instructors, the CFO/CFP, /r/CanadaGuns, etc.)."
canadaguns,3auzhs,alkali_feldspar,2,Tue Jun 23 21:23:08 2015 UTC,"For the AR15 you need an RPAL (restricted PAL). It's an extra day in the course and allows you to buy pistols and restricted rifles like the AR15.  To actually buy one you need to be member of a range where you can shoot it. You then need to apply with the CFO for a authorization to transport restricted firearms. They want proof of range membership and will then issue you a piece of paper that says you can transport restricted guns from your home to the range and to licensed gun smiths. So called LTATT. Then you can mail order the gun which involves waiting some more because the gun will be transferred (registered) to you before they can send it to you. Or you buy it in a store, in which case you additionally have to wait for another piece of paper that allows you to transport it from the store to your house.  Storage laws are the same in all provinces and will be covered in your course. For restricted guns it's basically locked, and locked in a gun cabinet. Or stored in an actual guns safe.  All variants of the AK47 are completely prohibited with the exception of some rare unobtainable valmet hunters. You can get visually similar rifles like the VZ58 though, which arguably are better guns anyhow. They aren't even all restricted."
canadaguns,3auzhs,Jobbo_Fett,9,Tue Jun 23 19:02:07 2015 UTC,"To actually buy one you need to be member of a range where you can shoot it.              Not true.  You do not have to be a member of a range to purchase and acquire a restricted firearm.  They don't like that answer, but it's not illegal."
canadaguns,3auzhs,death_hawk,5,Tue Jun 23 19:06:36 2015 UTC,The Alberta CFO won't issue you your ATT's or initiate a transfer without a club membership. I believe BC is the same. In 6 months however this should be a thing of the past.
canadaguns,3auzhs,death_hawk,3,Tue Jun 23 19:31:38 2015 UTC,"Well, technically if you don't have a membership you wouldn't need an ATT anyways, you'd have an STATT to bring it home (if it wasn't delivered to your house).              You'd also be completing a transfer, not initiating it.  Either way, it's not against the law but I doubt anyone that oversees the CFO (Lol) would step in to change that."
canadaguns,3auzhs,achwas,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:34:17 2015 UTC,"Well, technically if you don't have a membership you wouldn't need an ATT anyways, you'd have an STATT to bring it home (if it wasn't delivered to your house).     In BC, they won't issue you a STATT without a LTATT. I just went through it myself and they explicitly said that they won't do it. Luckily we have Silvercore Gun Club which is $30/year which can count towards a LTATT which means you can get a STATT.    I think C-42 changes all this but as of right now (or rather last week) it was current."

canadaguns,3auzhs,alkali_feldspar,1 point,Wed Jun 24 06:41:17 2015 UTC,"In theory yes, practically however you will have trouble getting it transferred to you and likely face delays. Also, without the range membership and att it's a paperweight."
canadaguns,3auzhs,alkali_feldspar,2,Tue Jun 23 19:31:51 2015 UTC,"My first restricted was obtained without a range membership.  The issue isn't about the troubles you'd get or delays, simply that it IS legal to acquire.  What you can do with it afterwards is a whole other issue."
canadaguns,3auzhs,alkali_feldspar,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:20:08 2015 UTC,thanks. you're very informative.
canadaguns,3auzhs,alkali_feldspar,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:21:07 2015 UTC,"The AR-15 is restricted, so you will need to get your Restricted PAL. Restricted firearms can only be used at CFO approved ranges and have stricter transport and storage requirements than regular Non-Restricted firearms.   As for AK's... They're all prohibited and you can have one. (Unless you drop $$$$ on one of the few Valmet's in the country)   i just don't really understand the wording on the rcmp website.   I'm guessing English or French isn't your first language is it? Owning firearms in the country is a bit of a tricky thing and unfortunately if you're having trouble with the RCMP website you may find the whole process a bit difficult to figure out. This is not good because breaking firearms law is a criminal offence and can land you in jail and/or deported, so take care to understand what you're doing.  If you have more questions we'll do our best to help you. The first step for you should be taking the CFSC and passing the non-restricted and restricted exams.

canadaguns,3au4ee,The_Crover,2,Tue Jun 23 16:34:37 2015 UTC,"How does this work? Do you select ""Public Land Use Zone"" under ""Land Use Management""?  So all the green squares when you zoom in are crown land? It seems to have phone numbers to contact the owners for the land? I thought if it was crown land that means the government owns it... Clearly I'm misinterpreting this map in some way lol"
canadaguns,3au4ee,C-FEFZ,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:01:56 2015 UTC,"Hey there, here is the deal with the map.  The green squares represent grazing leases.  These are dispositions on crown land that is administered by the government, but leased to individuals for grazing livestock.  The lessee is obligated to let you use the land (as it is public land) however, you are subject to the conditions set out and listed on the site."
canadaguns,3au4ee,Randomreditname,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:48:28 2015 UTC,"I see, so as long as it does not say ""no firearm discharges"" or something to that effect in the ""detail/attributes/activity data"" section it means I'm good to go?  Is there a way to filter the map to see not just leased crown land for grazing, but all of it?"
canadaguns,3au4ee,C-FEFZ,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:56:32 2015 UTC,"you will have to confirm with the lessee as to what is appropriate and is not. Generally just phone and ask permission as you would on private land.  As you can imagine if he has lots of cattle grazing, or doing work in the area he will not want folks shooting around him or their livestock.  As far as filtering, no you cannot do that on that particular map viewer.  Typically grazing land is the most appropriate for this type of recreating (hunting/shooting).   A PLUZ (google it) may also offer a place to shoot.  If you would like more information I would suggest contacting someone with Environment and Parks (former ESRD) or your local regional EP office and ask to speak to a CO."

Respects science, social safety net I can get behind. As I get older I'm more critical however at the charges levied at the government for pandering to big business. I'm no believer in trickle down economics but I'm a believer that there are big movers in industry that are levers of the nation's economic health that does benefit me.   I'm never going to be a 2 per center unless I hit the lottery (I don't play the lottery). I earn the upper bracket right now but that doesn't mean I'm buying boats. I don't even have a mortgage.

The NDP are going to have to earn my trust on the economy.    believes in a more equitable society.

I'm critical of the NDP because that is what I see from the policy and from what the leadership have said. Now I socially identify with many of the policies of social liberals just not all of them - I have even voted NDP and occasionally Liberal. But right now I am so far from identifying from a Political Party that it would take a lot for me to get defensive if someone said: oh Stephen Harper is Satan. I don't give a fuck because I don't identify with the PC party either.   You want to get defensive over the SJW label? That's all on you. SJWs or Tumberlistas or whoever spills their junk all over my Facebook all day with political image memes and that bullshit can suck my balls.   Maybe instead of me as an independent thinker who just happens to support gun ownership worrying about how to fit my image into whatever manipulative platform a political party wants I should be as critical as I want to some party that wants to be in power so bad it is loves labels and caricatures.
canadaguns,3apwhr,rush68,1 point,Tue Jun 23 03:52:12 2015 UTC,Do we have a party that supports gun ownership reform in a positive way? Seems the liberals and conservatives aren't safe bets either
canadaguns,3apwhr,CheeseNBacon2,3,Mon Jun 22 18:18:52 2015 UTC,"To be fair, this Conservative government has done more for gun owners than any other gov in practically the last 25 years.  Scarping the LGR, and passing bill C-42.  They aren't big changes, but it's the first gun laws in Canada I can remember that weren't more restrictions.  I'm no fan of Harper or the Conservative, but I do like them on this one issue."
canadaguns,3apwhr,rush68,5,Mon Jun 22 23:33:22 2015 UTC,I think the conservatives need a change in leadership.
canadaguns,3apwhr,RetartedGenius,2,Mon Jun 22 23:42:05 2015 UTC,"I think that would be a good start.  I'm pretty left politically, but with a few slight policy modifications and a change of leaders I might be convinced, just this once."
canadaguns,3apwhr,airchinapilot,-1,Mon Jun 22 23:47:46 2015 UTC,"bill C-42   Is it really good they scrapped their own common sense bill? It was a somewhat positive bill for gun ownership. Would have removed some paperwork and penalties for gun licensing and transportation, provided a six-month grace period for lapsed licenses and  gave cabinet decision-making power over how guns are classified.  They were small changes (and not all arguably perfect) but for the Conservatives to have scrapped their own bill was a big step backwards."
canadaguns,3apwhr,airchinapilot,2,Mon Jun 22 23:52:34 2015 UTC,scrapped?  when was it scrapped?  I thought it got royal assent thursday or friday?  In fact https://openparliament.ca/bills/41-2/C-42/ says it has received royal assent and is now law.

I think they just rotate staff around the whole store. The last time I was in there the kid at the counter had no idea about anything and couldn't even pronounce a lot of the brands. The only person I have ever seen working there that even had their PAL it seemed was a woman in her 50's who hadn't gone hunting or shooting in 15 years. CanTire is not a firearms store.

Come to think of it, the reason why I'm into guns is because I went to Vegas after my breakup and I resolved to do all the things I would never have done while I was in that relationship. I've gained a ton of new friends because of shooting too.   I chat with my ex now occasionally but she's in a different city. It takes a long time to feel like it's okay."

Plus I'm a board member so it would be easier to set up and I could give them the grand tour. There was a lot of enthusiasm but then my boss said we should put it to a vote and if anyone didn't want to do it because they were uncomfortable we would find something else to do.   So I knew it wasn't going to happen but I still made arrangements just in case and I let people know about the arrangements and how it wouldn't be super scary and I would make sure everyone felt good. There was an anonymous survey and of course it came back negative. One person said they didn't want to do it. One person out of 20.   So we'll probably have a bbq.

canadaguns,3aqgq0,Styrak,1 point,Mon Jun 22 19:26:19 2015 UTC,I know... but MFS: clean your gun before you're done shooting because it's so full of gunk the bolt wont cycle.   I've also been told by lots of people that the norinco stuff is still mildly corrosive.
canadaguns,3aqgq0,alkali_feldspar,3,Mon Jun 22 19:28:31 2015 UTC,"They are full of it.  It's either corrosive or it's not, there's no such thing as ""mildly corrosive""  Guns can however, still rust on their own, regardless of ammo type."
canadaguns,3aqgq0,TheCapedMoosesader,1 point,Mon Jun 22 20:04:41 2015 UTC,"MFS is that bad?  Yeesh.  I have some of the 7.62x54R and I've shot a bit of it.  Through a bolt gun though (Mosin).  Oh and the Norc?  What do you mean ""mildly"" it either is or isn't.  Either has a corrosive primer or doesn't.  And do you mean any or just certain calibres?"
canadaguns,3aqgq0,Styrak,1 point,Mon Jun 22 19:31:21 2015 UTC,Yep. Put 20 rounds through a sks and it gunked it right up. Still functioned but it had more soot on everything from that than shooting 200 rounds of surplus. It was such a mess to clean out.
canadaguns,3aqgq0,alkali_feldspar,1 point,Mon Jun 22 19:33:09 2015 UTC,"That's not corrosive though, that's just dirty.  Corrosive means the primer generates a salt on firing, which in turn accelerates rusting."

All purpose gun, go with a 3"" 870.  Older is better but the new ones aren't as bad as some people on gear make them sound.  There is a ton of aftermarket support for them.  You can grab one with a 26"" barrel and use it for hunting then throw on a plus 5 extension and run 3gun matches with it.  I wouldn't go 3.5"" pump gun as most of them have a longer stroke length which can lead to slower times or short stroking causing jams.  If you are set on a 3.5"" gun go versa max or m3500.  Both are 3.5"" so you can legally load 7+1 shells of 2 3/4.  Both guns will also reliably cycle light loads (versa max is a multi port self cleaning gas gun and m3500 is inertia).

canadaguns,3anzzo,alkali_feldspar,1 point,Mon Jun 22 02:28:34 2015 UTC,"Sherwood Park Fish and Game is nice and close, but there's a wait list to join. I'm also a member of the Consort range, but that's a hell of a long drive. I might join Edson next year."
canadaguns,3anzzo,bristow84,3,Mon Jun 22 03:30:18 2015 UTC,"For sherwood Park, there's pretty much a wait list to be on the wait list at this point, it's ridiculous"
canadaguns,3anzzo,tongarirohiker,2,Mon Jun 22 03:33:02 2015 UTC,"Sherwood Park has great facilities, except if you want to get into action shooting (IDPA, IPSC, PPC, 3Gun). Unless you're a LEO on their assigned range day, no holster draws except for on two bays. If this is in your future plans, check out Spruce Grove, CHAS, and Camrose. Camrose is only another 10 minutes further than Sherwood Park so it is a real contender."
canadaguns,3anzzo,alkali_feldspar,2,Mon Jun 22 12:39:30 2015 UTC,SPFGA just got a new 50m range for 3 gun. So hopefully that starts up this summer.
canadaguns,3anzzo,tongarirohiker,2,Mon Jun 22 13:24:28 2015 UTC,"I heard about the new 50m range, but they did not specify that it was for 3 gun during my orientation last month. The orientation leader said it would be anything goes as far as which firearms can be used (e.g.: steel core, pistols, rifles, shotguns could all be used there) but did not say anything about whether movement was allowed downrange. If movement is not allowed, then it's not for 3 gun. But, I'm willing to be proven wrong once it opens."
canadaguns,3anzzo,alkali_feldspar,1 point,Mon Jun 22 16:03:15 2015 UTC,"I was talking with some of the execs when they started construction this spring. They want to run 3 gun on that range, and are just looking for some volunteers to do it."

I was going to make a trip over, but I'm not sure I'd want to pay $50 (plus the $200 screw you fees for the ferry)."
canadaguns,3and16,death_hawk,2,Mon Jun 22 00:27:22 2015 UTC,"I'm going to get the membership, which makes guest passes $20."
canadaguns,3and16,death_hawk,2,Mon Jun 22 01:06:21 2015 UTC,Oh yeah if you live on the island it makes total sense. But for a meetup I might have to pay the drop in unless there's sufficient members to bring in guests. I'm not sure if there's a guest limit per member.

Then you also have to take there mandatory range orientation course, which basically is about 45 minutes long where you learn what you can and can't do on the range"
canadaguns,3and16,death_hawk,1 point,Mon Jun 22 04:33:33 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, I was thinking more for guests. Most other ranges (at least in Vancouver) are $10-$30. $50 was mostly sticker shock.    If you plan on living in Victoria then $130 is a fair bit cheaper than most ranges here. Heck even if you don't live there, if you plan on going more than twice you've basically paid for it."
canadaguns,3and16,Kaffarov,1 point,Mon Jun 22 04:47:47 2015 UTC,"Oh, for guests who are going with a member who are 18 and under its a $5 fee. Over 18 is $20"

canadaguns,3and16,DMoneyCDN,2,Mon Jun 22 04:32:10 2015 UTC,The drop in passes were increased to $50 from $25 this year. It helps prevent yahoos from visiting. There was a problem with that at one point.
canadaguns,3and16,Ibmeister,1 point,Mon Jun 22 05:37:22 2015 UTC,That's a strange reason IMO.  I wonder if that actually works.    EDIT: Whoops. I forgot there's a guest fee of $20. I thought it was $50 but that seems to be the non member fee. Yeah that kind of makes sense then. Kind of.

canadaguns,3ag3lo,steverino75,7,Fri Jun 19 22:23:11 2015 UTC,"It means that once your licence is renewed, the renewed licence will have the ATT attached to it as a condition of that licence.

canadaguns,3ag3lo,Glock1911,1 point,Sat Jun 20 00:21:22 2015 UTC,"I think the act also requires that an ATT issued for target practice or competition must apply to all recognized clubs in your province.   (1.1) In the case of an authorization to transport issued for a reason referred to in paragraph (1)(a) within the province where the holder of the authorization resides, the specified places must include all shooting clubs and shooting ranges that are approved under section 29 and that are located in that province.

The example our CRFSC instructor gave was going to a shooting competition in Thunder Bay.  It would take at least 15 hours to drive there from where I live.  It would be reasonable to expect that we would have to stop for gas, restroom breaks, maybe even overnight in a hotel.  It's basically a crap shoot as to what is reasonably direct and what is not.

canadaguns,3ag3lo,Cheese_Bits,3,Fri Jun 19 22:04:20 2015 UTC,"I live in Alberta.  There was nothing in C-42 that makes this sport easier or less intimidating.  Additionally, most of the proposed changes involve reducing the cost of the Firearms Act to Canadian taxpayers, i.e. the undoing of several sections of the act that should not have been written the way they were in the first place.  This whole process is taking forever and no one has even addressed any of the sections of the Firearms Act that sport shooters really find irritating."

canadaguns,3ag3lo,DanLynch,5,Sat Jun 20 00:28:32 2015 UTC,"There is the locking in RCMP classifications after a year so no more yo-yoing classifications, and the ability of the Safety Minister to downgrade classifications.  That's something.  At least it will be if they ever get around to un-prohibiting and un-restricting things."
canadaguns,3ag3lo,CheeseNBacon2,1 point,Sat Jun 20 02:42:52 2015 UTC,"Again, this is undoing something that should have never been allowed in the first place.  The RCMP may counsel the Government, but should not be the last say on anything."
canadaguns,3ag3lo,twist3d7,5,Sat Jun 20 01:48:13 2015 UTC,"Theres a whole lot in our gun laws that should have never been allowed in the first place.  This is the first step in undoing that.  This does address at least two things sport shooter find irritating.  1) RCMP reclassifying things.  This isn't new with the Swiss Arms/CZ 858.  The GP 22, the AK22, the AP80 all .22s that remotely resembled an AK, and used to be legal but got prohibited as variants.  and 2)  Getting rid of the prohibited by name category.  The ridiculous list of 'scary' guns that are banned for no logical reason.  They were banned by Order in Council.  Well now they can be unbanned by Order in Council.   Those are two big things.  They're big things that will take a long while to see the fruit of, but have the potential to be way more important than the ATT thing everyone else seems to focus on."
canadaguns,3ag3lo,CheeseNBacon2,0,Sat Jun 20 02:11:13 2015 UTC,"The list of guns that are banned will only get larger.  If you think logic will prevail, you don't understand the world very well.  They let the RCMP reclassify things, so the government would not have to deal with the situation.  The government was very sneaky and quite possibly unlawful in their actions.  Now that the reclassifications have been made law, what possible reason could the government have to repeal them?"
canadaguns,3ag3lo,twist3d7,4,Sat Jun 20 02:21:25 2015 UTC,"The list of guns that are banned will only get larger.   So what we had before C-42.  Except now there actually is a law saying it can go the other way.   If you think logic will prevail, you don't understand the world very well.   Again, the same situation as before C-42 except now there actually is a law trying to make it go the other way.  Maybe it's just them pandering to get a certain demographic vote, but hey if it helps us out I'm not gonna turn it down.   Now that the reclassifications have been made law, what possible reason could the government have to repeal them?   To pander to the gun vote.  That's the whole reason they even made C-42 to begin with.   The government RCMP was very sneaky and quite possibly unlawful in their actions.   FTFY   They let the RCMP reclassify things, so the government would not have to deal with the situation.    And yet here they've come out with a law that will let them undo the RCMP reclassification.  And did they 'let' them?  Seems like there was a lot of push back on that.  I mean, C-42 for example.  As much as I dislike the CPC, they do seem to be putting forth a modicum of effort into reforming our gun laws.  If they get another majority I can totally see them making more incremental changes.  It might be every election cycle but it's something. Bill C-42 definitely represents a shift in momentum for gun laws.  The LGR repealed and now this?  Thats the first two things any government has done in ~25 years to make gun laws in Canada less restrictive.  I may not understand the world very well, but at least I'm paying attention.  Acting like the the government that banned a bunch of shit by name is the same government that made it so that can be undone doesn't make much sense to me, as they are obviously different governments.  Now all that being said, if we get a Lib or NDP majority, or a coalition... well shit, then we're just one shooting away from taking two big steps back.  But in the mean time lets not let our cynicism cloud the fact that we actually for once have made progress.  It may be small, but it's something."
canadaguns,3ag3lo,CheeseNBacon2,0,Sat Jun 20 03:10:01 2015 UTC,"If you take 2 steps backward and 1 step forward you get nowhere.  You really don't understand why the government is doing what it is doing.  The LGR repeal and C-42 both save money, taxpayers money, that is all that they do."

And no, that's not all they do.  That's clearly not all they do.  Any one who's paid even a modicum of attention knows that's not all they do.  Admittedly they don't do much more, but it's something.    Those two steps back i mentioned were under hypothetical future governments.  Yes it will get us nowhere if next election the NDP wins and decides to make more laws.  If the Cons win, they have given every indication of being not anti-gun.  Maybe not exactly pro-gun, but it's pretty plain they are amenable to lessening restrictions.  They're the only part that doesn't have more restrictions as part of their official platform.  They have connections to and are influenced by conservative pro-gun groups.  Money and influence is the language of politics and groups like the NFA and CSSA have it.    Piece of advice;  don't go telling people they don't understand things and then immediately follow it by demonstrating that neither do you.  I know being all cynical and salty seems cool and fun, but you gotta take a break every once in a while."

canadaguns,3ag3lo,Dax420,6,Sat Jun 20 23:28:20 2015 UTC,The places approved for shooting restricteds doesn't change. So no you can't go to the bush.

But if that changes..."
canadaguns,3ag3lo,Dax420,3,Sat Jun 20 00:26:11 2015 UTC,You are mistaken. Section 19 of the firearms act very specifically lists where you can take a restricted firearm.
canadaguns,3ag3lo,NoxiousDogCloud,3,Sat Jun 20 00:34:16 2015 UTC,"I think the law may have been that ATTs can only be issued for approved ranges, and all those other places.  So while theres no law about discharging in the bush, there is a law about transporting it there.  ATTs aren't completely axed, they're just merged with the license and apply to all your restricteds, but the conditions of the ATT still apply, ie. 'only these certain places are ok to take it.'  At least that's the way I understand it.  I may be wrong.  I would love to be wrong in fact, that would be an awesome loophole."
canadaguns,3ag3lo,CheeseNBacon2,3,Sat Jun 20 04:31:57 2015 UTC,I really would like some clarification on this one. Does that mean I can go target shooting in the bush with my restricted firearms now?   No. Target shooting with restricted firearms is done at federally approved ranges only. Nothing about the conditions of the ATT and activities has changed at all.
canadaguns,3ag3lo,NoxiousDogCloud,-1,Sat Jun 20 01:46:28 2015 UTC,So where's the law that says where you are allowed to discharge restricted firearms? It doesn't exist. The only time restricted gets mentioned is the storage and transport sections.
canadaguns,3ag3lo,Dax420,2,Sat Jun 20 02:05:54 2015 UTC,"OK. So it doesn't say you can't shoot it in the woods. But what it does say is you can't take it to the woods. So if you can't take it to the woods, you can't shoot it in the woods.  Firearms Act, section 19   #19. (1) An individual who holds a licence authorizing the individual to possess prohibited firearms or restricted firearms may be authorized to transport a particular prohibited firearm or restricted firearm between two or more specified places for any good and sufficient reason, including, without restricting the generality of the foregoing,  (a) for use in target practice, or a target shooting competition, under specified conditions or under the auspices of a shooting club or shooting range that is approved under section 29;   And in case you ask, section 29 says   (1) No person shall operate a shooting club or shooting range except under an approval of the provincial minister for the province in which the premises of the shooting club or shooting range are located.   Since the woods is neither a range, a gun shop, a gun show, or your new house, you can't take it into the woods. Where or not you're allowed to shoot it in the bush, you can't take it there anywhere so it's kind of moot."
canadaguns,3ag3lo,NoxiousDogCloud,1 point,Sat Jun 20 03:39:30 2015 UTC,"Let's say I had a couple hundred acres of land, in an area where I could legally discharge firearms.  And let's say that land had a house on it, and the house was the address I lived at, and my restricted firearms were registered to that address.  Could I walk my AR15 to the woods on my land - same address, no transportation to another address involved - and plink away?  I can't find anything in either the Firearms Act, or the regulations enabled by the Firearms act, that would prohibit this.  Where's that firearms lawyer - /u/varsil ???"

canadaguns,3af2fe,Comanche6,3,Fri Jun 19 16:50:01 2015 UTC,"Did it come with a headspace gauge and do you know how to set the timing?  Brings me back to my C5 days in the Armoured Corps. I some ways, this MG is more reliable and durable than the FN MAG/C6 replacement. The heavier mass of metal in the receiver and barrel would dissipate heat better when we were rapid firing vs. the C6 which would overheat faster (seen glowing red heavy barrels). Slower rate of fire helped. The drawback to all that mass is it would retain the heat and we'd have cook-offs and runaway guns where, even with green flags on the range, your MG would start firing. The drill was to rip the belt from the gun! And then, buy drinks for the target party in the mess cause they were dodging your tracers! No wonder target parties started to go out on the range in M113s, at least they had some protection."
canadaguns,3af2fe,bamfrighthere,1 point,Fri Jun 19 17:55:59 2015 UTC,Did not come with a headspace gauge. I honestly have no idea how to set the timing.
canadaguns,3af2fe,AdiposeFin,3,Fri Jun 19 18:00:20 2015 UTC,"http://www.bmgparts.com/tools.html  You want a: ""Wrench, Spanner, Headspace""  Don't bother with a gauge, they're dangerous if not shooting military ball full auto. Basically, if headspace is too tight, the gun will run slow or not fire. If it's too loose, you can have an explosive cartridge failure and bad things can happen.  Timing is for open bolt guns. Is your's an open bolt? If not, don't worry about it. If not, the firing mechanism has to activate precisely as the bolt closes on the chamber. If not, you get weak primer strikes or misfires. Timing is a function of headspace but can also be tweaked by bending the firing bar, for instance.  In any case, if it works, don't fuck with it. But if you pull the barrel to clean it, you HAVE TO set the headspace or it's not safe.  Read pages 5 and 6 here: http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/ref/FM/PDFs/FM23-45.pdf"
canadaguns,3af2fe,alkali_feldspar,2,Fri Jun 19 18:17:48 2015 UTC,Closed bolt. Haven't pulled the barrel yet or really cleaned it quite yet.
canadaguns,3af2fe,Kennyclone,5,Fri Jun 19 18:23:22 2015 UTC,"Ok cool, the summary is: turn the barrel tight then back off 2 clicks (or more) until it will fire and extract. Good luck!"

How much training do you require to tell your agents to pick up the phone and say 'you don't need an ATT for that any more'.

canadaguns,3aehaw,hashiro86,2,Fri Jun 19 20:19:14 2015 UTC,"In addition to what kleptomaniac said, it also makes it so the RCMP, after issuing a FRT (Firearm Reference Table, basically the magic document that decides if a gun is non-restricted, restricted or prohibited) has 1 year to change it's mind.  After 1 year the classification is set in stone as far as the RCMP is concerned.  It also provides the ability for the Safety Minister to issue an Order in Council to move guns down a classification, previously to this they could only go up.  It's actually been a long time coming.  Back before Sandy Hook the government had got a group together to make recommendations for changing firearms law, and the group came up with a ton of recommendations.  Things like making licenses 10 years instead of 5, un-restricting and prohibiting things, doing away with ATTs and a whole bunch more I'm forgetting.  It basically covered about half of the ridiculous laws we all want to get fixed.  Then Sandy Hook happened and it got put on the back burner and trimmed way down into C-42.  So really in itself it's a great step forward, but compared to what it should have been it's kinda weak."

canadaguns,3afm6w,CyberEye2,2,Fri Jun 19 19:07:30 2015 UTC,I've been there once. The guy who runs it charges 15 bucks an hour to shoot plus ammo if you want to buy some. You can bring your own rifles or shoot any of the guns he has in the store (all non restricted). Most of what he stocks is for hunting or plinking. He has a 600 yrd range in the back but they have use of a 1000 yrd which is next door. Guy who runs it is pretty old and likes to talk to his customers. He also likes to see how good they are at shooting. When I went there I talked to him about how I used to shoot in 1000 yrd target events using apature sights. After he heard that he has to see how well I could shoot and paid for me to use his range. He brought out an old scoped savage .308 and wanted to see if I could walk the walk. He took me out to the 300 yrd mark and set up a pop can to shoot at. He's a pretty nice guy overall. It was a fun experience to say the least.

Step 3: Wait for transfer approval, depending on province 3 days - forever (not really, but apparently in Ontario it can take a bit)  Step 4: When transfer is complete get STATT from your provincial CFO to take the gun to your old man, or to the local post office if he doesn't live nearby and you need to mail it.  Step 5: Have old man wait for transfer paperwork/reg cert.  Step 6: Go to range, blap blap blap.

Store transfers are faster than private, which can take anywhere from a day to a month depending on the province's work load or the cycle of the moon or whatever their damn tea leaves say."

They still have to transfer the firearm, it just won't be going past the province (in theory) which should speed it up a little bit.   That said I remember all to well the days of the long gun registry when we'd register a gun and the person at the CFO would say ""it's gone for review"" and not offer us any further information.  At that point it could be a day, an hour, or a few months.    I think in the long run it will speed some things up, but there will be many hiccups along the way."

canadaguns,3ac0mc,Bnspl,1 point,Fri Jun 19 01:00:27 2015 UTC,"Really?  I hadn't heard that.  Last I heard they were requesting a sample from FNs manufacturer in the US, and then it got picked up by SOCOM which got it put on ITAR which meant no exports which meant no sample.    Now not knowing much about the internals of a SCAR, couldn't one do the same thing with an AR too?  Take a full-auto lower and put any old upper on it?  Plus wouldn't the lower be the firearm, so bringing in one that's already full auto has no bearing on a semi-auto one.  I mean if they could pull that, they could prohib any semi that has a full auto cousin."
canadaguns,3ac0mc,CheeseNBacon2,1 point,Fri Jun 19 01:30:36 2015 UTC,"uhh, yes. Hence swiss arms fiasco. The AR-15 is exempt because of the orders in council.  Importers have gone to great lengths to find semi-auto rifles like the CZ-858 that were manufactured with no commonality to a full auto version. When they found CZ had repurposed recievers from the full auto cousin and welded in the blocks for the semi auto it became a full auto conversion- hence the ban.  Similarly we are getting the ATRS Tactical hunter because even though it is an ar-15 in all but name, there is no way to possibly fit that AR-15 lower or upper to it."
canadaguns,3ac0mc,Notquitesafe,2,Fri Jun 19 04:54:10 2015 UTC,"But that ban only affects certain manufacturers during certain time frames.  The entire platform isn't banned, just ones coming from the factory and time when they were re-purposing full-auto receivers.  And that's what got them banned; the fact that they started life as a full-auto receiver.  It wasn't that you could put an upper on a full-auto receiver.  It was that the receivers being improted were re-purposed full-autos.  Before that happened there were full-auto receivers (not imported obviously) and purpose built semi-auto receivers.  The purpose built semi-auto receivers were always fine, despite the uppers fitting on both.  It doesn't matter what you can do with the upper, the upper isn't the firearm.  It's the lower that matters.  The only time the upper matters is in determining if something is a 'variant', hence the ATRS.  If it could take AR uppers, that makes it an AR, which makes it restricted.  But putting an AR upper on an M16 lower doesn't make an AR full-auto convertible because it hasn't done anything to the receiver.  What would matter is if you could take the M16 lowers internals and easily put them in the AR lower.  So that would have to be what they did with the SCAR.  They would have had to be able to get the full auto internals in the semi-autos receiver.  Or have the receivers be re-purposed full-auto receivers.  Now mind you the RCMP has gone and prohibited things as AK or other prohib 'variants' despite the things being .22s with no parts commonality so... I mean shit, I guess it's possible, but I'd love to see a reference on the SCAR 16s/17s being prohibited.  So far with all my googling all I've been able to find is that the RCMP was in the process of drawing up an FRT for the 16s/17s, confirmed it wasn't an FNC variant, confirmed barrel length was non-restricted and was asking for a sample to determine if it could take full auto sears and trigger groups, but then US exports got stopped and the whole thing ended up in limbo.  Plus it's not listed on the Regulations Perscribing blah blah blah http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-98-462/page-2.html#h-4"

The responding officers are going to do a very detailed check in the animal. If you need to use it do your damnedest to make sure ever shot is placed in the front so you can show it was running towards you. I knew a cattle rancher that had to put down a bear that charged him and fish and wildlife came. Took his rifle while they conducted their investigation. He was never charged with anything but it still took him almost a year to get his rifle back.

It is another great opportunity for friends and family unfamiliar with firearms to come out and get a feel for the sport. It is also an excellent opportunity for long time shooters to get acquainted with different aspects of the sport. Please share the flyer with friends and family.  Printable flyer found here

canadaguns,3ac9r7,colt1295,5,Thu Jun 18 22:53:13 2015 UTC,"Do not buy new production Remington products. They are plagued with quality control issues, such as broken parts, non functional mechanically, unfinished chambers, poor finishes that rub off and lead to rusting of the firearm.  If you're still looking for one, try Mossberg, or Weatherby.   3 1/2"" is available at any sporting goods store, and yes, there are slugs in that length of shell. But the question I have for you is, why?  Why do you want a shotgun that shoots 3 1/2"" shells? Are you hunting with it? Because that's about the only use for that many pellets. If you want a big boom, 2 3/4"" will do just fine."

Personally, it bothers me a bit when the old guys hand a noob a gun and say go for it, while they have a laugh with their buddies as the noob scopes himself or what not. (Not saying you do this, just an example.)  This is what happened to my best friend, but luckily he kept at it. Those guys (father in law and his buddies) let him shoot it a 2nd time even! Again hurting himself. He told me he just wanted them to show him what he was doing wrong ffs. but nope, you gotta be initiated was the mentality.   Personally I've never been put in that situation, but if i had, I could see myself not being a fan of the sport after that."

OK, I will recover, get scoped in the eye socket drawing blood? maybe that would be enough for them. I know i'd be embarrassed and not want to shoot anymore that day. maybe never again. glad that didn't happen to me. had many a bruised shoulder though and i'm fine with that. hell, i'll go out the day after and do it again!  why let someone have a potentially traumatic experience? the laughs? imo, it's not worth someone getting hurt / turned off from shooting.   all i'm trying to say is why potentially turn new shooters away from something we need to grow?"
canadaguns,3ac9r7,thefeelofempty,2,Fri Jun 19 18:49:27 2015 UTC,"Not bad, bruised shoulder. He told me after the 2nd round. Yes, this can shy people away, but luckily my friend knew me.  I would NOT Do this to others..."

We start them off with a .22 and they work their way up. Then we show them the round and tell them this is the initiation round. We have a folder with initiation round videos with all of our shooting buddies ;)
canadaguns,3ac9r7,Red_1977,1 point,Fri Jun 19 19:40:34 2015 UTC,"so it's more of a ""now your'e one of us"" things eh? that's not so bad. :)  .22 is the best way to start people with real guns imo. glorified pellet gun I tell them and makes new shooters feel a lot more comfortable trying anything bigger later on.   I recall an opposite experience i had once. my buddy had a pistol grip 12 ga and he hated it cause he hurt his wrist the first day out with it. all his talking(and the fact he's stronger than i) got me a little worried i was gonna get hurt. but he also really wanted me to try it, and lets be honest. so did i...  held on tight and it wasn't so bad! i would not outfit mine with this, but it was less  hairy than I was expecting (shooting 2/3/4 00 buck)  I fired my first slug a few weeks after. now that one i felt! glad it had a buttstock when i tried that. lol (it was awesome btw. wow.)"
canadaguns,3ac9r7,thefeelofempty,0,Fri Jun 19 19:54:07 2015 UTC,"Hogwash.  I've had a new production 870 express for 2 years now,  shoot clays regularly. I have a few thousand rounds through it with no problems.  The thing is a tank. Keep it clean and it will serve you well. Many of the ranges in our area use 870s as rental guns.  I have rented many for friends.  They all go bang and function well."
canadaguns,3ac9r7,pisan1,0,Tue Jun 23 19:49:03 2015 UTC,"Same here, mine was mechanically sound, but the finish rubbed off. It rusted. I duracoated it to keep it from failing further.  You got lucky I guess. Look it up, there are tales and anecdotes of guns coming out of the box already rusted."

canadaguns,3ac9r7,pisan1,2,Tue Jun 23 21:00:05 2015 UTC,"Are you looking for a good goose gun?  FWIW, the 3.5"" shells are great for getting a good punch of single B or BB through the thick feathers and down of snows and canada geese.  However, other than that purpose, it's a super heavy round that you won't really like shooting.   For ducks, guys shooting 3.5"" tend to skybust and take bad shots wounding birds and not knocking them down.   But if you just want a mule kicking, shoulder bruising, FLaK88 cannon of a shotgun... have at 'er bud!"
canadaguns,3ac9r7,AdiposeFin,2,Fri Jun 19 00:30:50 2015 UTC,FLaK88 cannon of a shotgun...   That line makes me want to get one...
canadaguns,3ac9r7,muttonchopBear,1 point,Fri Jun 19 00:46:36 2015 UTC,"All I want the 3.5"" shells for is shits and giggles really. I've wanted an 870 Express for some time now, so I figured why not look into the Super Mag for the versatility of 2 3/4"" all the way up to 3 1/2"" for the hunting I do it's not a necessity I just thought 3.5"" would be cool."
canadaguns,3ac9r7,achwas,2,Fri Jun 19 05:26:37 2015 UTC,"3.5"" chamber means longer stroke to pump the gun, and longer receiver. Both would be a clear disadvantage to me, so if you don't actually need 3.5"" shells I'd get a 3"" gun if I were you."
canadaguns,3ac9r7,thefeelofempty,1 point,Fri Jun 19 05:57:59 2015 UTC,this is good advice imo.
canadaguns,3ac9r7,DrJet,2,Fri Jun 19 16:03:48 2015 UTC,"You'll wish you had a 3 1/2"" chamber when hunting geese or even duck in a less than ideal blind setup  Of course using the proper choke is important, but simply having the extra shot  flung at the bird is helpful when dealing with birds that are coming in towards the outer limits of your range.  Also 3 1/2"" waterfowl loads are more than manageable; people just seem to forget that 12ga's have a decent amount of kick when using anything other than #8 target loads."
canadaguns,3ac9r7,sardaukarqc,1 point,Fri Jun 19 14:23:14 2015 UTC,"3.5"" shells are not hard to find, and yes there are 3.5"" slugs. That being said get the regular 3"" chambered 870, It'll be a bit lighter and possibly a bit cheaper. 3.5"" shells are so brutal they are absolutely not fun to shoot, so you will try one box and never try it again. The brutal recoil will also make you flinch like hell.   A super mag 870 was my first gun. Now I know that bigger is not always better."
canadaguns,3ac9r7,ematico,1 point,Thu Jun 18 23:07:29 2015 UTC,"Let me just put it this way: I had an 870 Super Mag. I am not a small guy and can handle fire power. I had bruises on my shoulder (through a t-shirt). Remember, it's a pump, so you're taking all the recoil. There's not gas system eating up some of the energy.   I used it to initiate my buddy on his first range trip. He told me he never wants to shoot it ever again. I sold it, since it was pointless. 3"" is more than plenty to take down geese and turkey."

However for slugs I think you'd need to get a different barrel than they usually come with."

canadaguns,3ac9r7,Duke_of_New_York,1 point,Fri Jun 19 17:46:22 2015 UTC,"another great option would be to get an older wingmaster. they can be had for about 350-550 depending on condition and seller.   to make an old 2 3/4 take 3"" you simply need a $20 extractor and a barrel that can handle 3 inch shells.  you would get to scratch that 870 itch and get a quality gun at the same time. :) I have a 70's wingmaster and it's a good gun. still like my ithaca 37 and mossy 500 better though."

You could compromise on the build and switch to a standard AR lower and 9mm ramped bolt, with a 9mm Hahn or Spike's Magwell block.    you could definitely come close."

canadaguns,3aaqfl,alkali_feldspar,8,Thu Jun 18 16:11:42 2015 UTC,"It is not easy to get an export permit. Use Irunguns. You'll have to get your uncle to give the gun to an FFL who will then ship it to Irunguns, who will then send it to Canada, and then will be mailed to you. It's gonna cost you few hundred bucks.   The alternative is drive across the border, but if you get caught by US border guards (and they do check) you may face 10 years in jail."
canadaguns,3aaqfl,Kentzfield,3,Thu Jun 18 16:17:23 2015 UTC,"I was always curious about this. We're allowed to take Canadian firearms into the states temporarily for competitions and other events like that, couldn't he just say he's returning home with it? I take it the only downside is that, on his way IN to the states, he didn't declare that he was bringing a long gun IN for a period of time, so they would likely have no record of that part when he returned to Canada."
canadaguns,3aaqfl,alkali_feldspar,6,Thu Jun 18 16:22:42 2015 UTC,"You need to fill out paperwork before going to the US, and then they approve your entry with firearms. I know there's some members here who've done this so maybe they can explain it better."

canadaguns,3aaqfl,NoxiousDogCloud,3,Thu Jun 18 22:47:22 2015 UTC,"He'd have no record of bringing the gun into the states in the first place, so there's zero way to bring it back. You need approval and paperwork to bring it in. Without that, you obviously can't bring it back."
canadaguns,3aaqfl,Notquitesafe,1 point,Thu Jun 18 16:39:23 2015 UTC,As a non-resident alien you need a form to possess a firearms in the US. If you try crossing the border without your form you will be hit with additional ITAR charges for exporting a firearm. Those charges are all federal and have mandatory minimums. think 3 or 5 years is the least you will get with a parole option somewhere around 2/3 of the sentence.
canadaguns,3aaqfl,alkali_feldspar,2,Thu Jun 18 17:20:16 2015 UTC,"Now i don't want to break any laws, i have just emailed Irun guns. Now the border crossing here is Canadian guards coming back into Canada, If i get to them and declare it, would they detain me? or is it if i get caught by US customs on there side? Also he is willing to come across the border with me, he lives like 10 min from the falls. Again i dont want to break the law, i want the rifle :("
canadaguns,3aaqfl,Golanthanatos,3,Thu Jun 18 16:21:35 2015 UTC,"Bringing it into Canada isn't an issue if you have your PAL (go read the RCMP website, it's pretty well laid out). The problem is leaving the US with the rifle in your possession, you're not allowed to do that. Your uncle may be able to bring it into Canada, but if I understand correctly he can't leave it here. Your only legal option will be Irunguns."
canadaguns,3aaqfl,NoxiousDogCloud,2,Thu Jun 18 16:29:25 2015 UTC,"if his uncle can bring it into canada, couldn't they drive up together and do the transfer essentially at the border, or is the problem that then his uncle would be stuck holding the proverbial bag?"
canadaguns,3aaqfl,Notquitesafe,4,Thu Jun 18 16:54:48 2015 UTC,"His uncle could bring it in, for his own personal use, not to leave behind. That would be exporting, and again, requires an export permit."
canadaguns,3aaqfl,NoxiousDogCloud,1 point,Thu Jun 18 16:57:50 2015 UTC,"A caveat here, if he has dual citizenship he could bring it into canada for personal use then gift it while here. The US has no ability to track or be aware of that type of transaction as a US citizen has no requirement to declare a personal use firearm leaving the country, and the CDN side will not bother a PAL holder coming over. This is a grey area but if no money is exchanged I can't see either side being bothered about it."

So she'd have to come to Canada, do the courses, do the test, do the paperwork, get a license, then come back to Canada with the firearm and that's assume this is even legal (which it most likely is not)."

canadaguns,3aaqfl,Comanche6,3,Thu Jun 18 17:03:24 2015 UTC,I don't think the export permits are available to anyone that doesn't have US citizenship - or if they are - they are prohibitively expensive.  I think the cheapest method is going to be through IRG.

I like Mulcair, but his cabinet is filled with idiots like Murray Rankin, I highly doubt he'll take the approach of keeping a leash on them if they get in power."
canadaguns,3a8wvi,badlife,4,Thu Jun 18 14:56:18 2015 UTC,"Yup. That's pretty bad. Not quite Elizabeth-May-vs.-WiFi bad, but pretty bad. No argument from me.

canadaguns,3a8wvi,kofclubs,3,Thu Jun 18 15:49:56 2015 UTC,"May is quite the conundrum, on one had she spouts Wifi nonsense and then tables a decent Lyme disease bill.  I'm not sure why the Green party still caters to some of the extreme views, it takes away from any good things they've done or want to propose.  It also drives away a lot of voters.  The problem is we need a central party with some common sense, sadly its looking like Ontario's election last year and we're choosing who isn't the worst."
canadaguns,3a8wvi,badlife,2,Thu Jun 18 15:58:47 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I think it's a matter of our perception. They are idealogues, and when the crap they spout agrees with our (rational, sober, well-thought out and clearly correct :) ) point of view, they make sense. Then when their crap runs to antivax or anit-wifi or anti-GMO, we scratch our heads and wonder why they stopped making sense.  It's the same thing on the right, where 'the market knows best' can become something of a religion. When it makes sense, it makes a lot of sense. When it doesn't, you get people living in the streets."
canadaguns,3a8wvi,kofclubs,2,Thu Jun 18 17:06:56 2015 UTC,"Thats where I wish science, studies and common sense would prevail over people's emotions, gun control and farming are 2 that are widely misunderstood so I'm pretty much doomed.  Politics essentially divides us and we never really fully agree with all a parties policies, I just wish I had some faith that its going to get better and one party would actually table something on facts and not emotions."
canadaguns,3a8wvi,Wanhope,2,Thu Jun 18 18:30:18 2015 UTC,They cater to extremist views because every extremist who shares those views will always vote Green party.

No party will put out a platform that 100% pleases everyone. You have to just weigh your options. For me, I already agree mostly with NDP issues, plus I can't stand Harper, and think the Liberals are poorly managed.   Like I said before, it's much easier to disagree on few issues rather than most."
canadaguns,3a8wvi,kofclubs,2,Thu Jun 18 15:19:31 2015 UTC,"Like I said before, it's much easier to disagree on few issues rather than most.   Well we can agree that no party has the perfect platform, but I would hope you would at least understand why an Ag scientist or a farmer wouldn't even consider the NDP even though we may agree with some of their other policies.  It actually surprised me that their Ag policy was worse then their gun policy.    I'd almost prefer whomever wins that they don't get a majority so we don't see the same debacle as we have in Ontario right now."
canadaguns,3a8wvi,Notquitesafe,3,Thu Jun 18 15:42:01 2015 UTC,"On the other hand- NDP has never been strong in rural areas for some time (70's maybe?) as they are viewed as union centric. With the possibility of some western candidates coming up in this election we might see some fast revision of those ag policies by candidates now in contention after the harper closure of the wheat board. Edit: http://nialkuyek.ndp.ca/about Alberta is looking pretty empty, are they not running in some areas? Looking at the amount of environmentalists in quebec and BC running maybe it's a forlorn hope. Looks like  the western provinces would be in for a rough ride under ndp :("

Most western farmers I've talked don't want the Wheat Board back, at least not in its monopoly form so I can't think they'll actually do that without a major revolt.  We're already seeing it in Ontario where an Ag policy can come from activism in urban centers and not the science with neonics, its also why we have a big divide between rural and urban.    Its also why I'm not going to chance my vote on a party that puts that in for their Ag policy for their platform, I expect better that from a national party, I'd expect it from the Green Party.  I'd be interested to see Nial Kuyek's comments on their Ag policy, I'm quite certain didn't write it but I can't imagine he's going to his fellow farmers and telling them that.  I think with all the C-51 talk going on some really are making it a 1 issue election, so guns, agriculture, healthcare and other issues might be taking a backseat.  I'm just hoping we don't end up with a bunch of activist MP's who throw science and logic out the window on certain issues, a minority might tame some MP's ideologies."

I think people forget how much of a beating the PC's took after Mulroney, no way Harper has only 2 seats after this election.    Maybe we're just considered old now."
canadaguns,3a8wvi,MWDTech,2,Thu Jun 18 19:20:06 2015 UTC,"I'm 32, maybe that's old now haha, I guess new voters that just want a change never see what the other parties did in the past, the simple fact is there is no right answer, they are all bad choices, the problem is the system itself is so old that what were originally cracks and loopholes are now common place areas exploited to corruption.  I truly feel the system needs to be rebuilt for the modern day as the current system is a relic of the ages merely updated and retrofitted for our current social and economic climates, you can only patch up so much before you need to rebuild.   The rebuild means to replace all the current players as well, they are part of the system and do not know how to behave differently. They all seem to be going through the motions and just playing the political game, this isn't what we need, we need a leader that isn't pandering to the crowds, one that tells us the nitty gritty, who tells us the truth, that it won't get better quick, we are in for tough times, there is not a quick easy way to get out of our economic issues without making the tough cuts AND taxing more, and then following through with it be-damned what the public opinion is ."
canadaguns,3a8wvi,kofclubs,1 point,Thu Jun 18 19:23:54 2015 UTC,"Well I'm 34 so I guess that's the new old.

Really we should just be able to vote online for policies, after all I can bank online, buy a gun, do my taxes, I should be able to vote for a bill.  I think maybe the concern is how many fanatics do we have and would common sense actually prevail, I see a lot of people who don't understand gun laws that feel they should be able to take them away from law biding citizens bc of a belief."
canadaguns,3a8wvi,AdiposeFin,4,Thu Jun 18 19:47:04 2015 UTC,"Guns issue aside, the NDP is a horrible choice.    They have shown in BC and Ontario how they spend money like nobody's business until eventually it catches up with them and the people realize how screwed up things are and vote them out.  They screw up business and industry with socialist pipe dreams over regulating and social engineering.  Their ideas always sound good on the campaign, but leave everything in ruin in practice.   If you don't like Harper, that is fine.  Harper is a 'devil you know' candidate.

The 75B or the 75B omega are a little bit more than the Sig but offer a bit more gun for your dollar IMO.  Could be worth a look.

canadaguns,3a909x,twist3d7,2,Thu Jun 18 05:32:20 2015 UTC,I tried my friends CZ but the curved trigger wasn't super comfortable. Is that something you just get used to?

canadaguns,3a909x,Ventghal,1 point,Thu Jun 18 07:47:28 2015 UTC,"I recommend that to people a lot. You get some extras thrown in.   Out of your original 3, go with the Sig.....I shoot Sig in competition and love them to death.   I've shot the Girsan before and thought the trigger was shit. If it's a difference of 200 bucks, it's money well spent.   If you belong to a range, ask around to see if anyone owns the ones you want and will let you try it out."
canadaguns,3a909x,CruelHandLuke7,1 point,Thu Jun 18 14:54:01 2015 UTC,"If you had to choose between the P320 and the M&P, which would you choose?  Both in 9mm"
canadaguns,3a909x,Ventghal,1 point,Thu Jun 18 22:08:31 2015 UTC,After having shot about 100 rds out of each ........the Sig. Hands down. The M&P has a trigger I don't much care for. The Sig is just an all round better gun.  I shoot a 226 in IPSC and the only other gun I would want is the 320.   Is there anyone you can ask to take you out and let you shoot either. When I work with new shooters I tell them to try before you buy. Nothing like spending money on a gun and finding out it doesn't work well with you.
canadaguns,3a909x,CruelHandLuke7,1 point,Fri Jun 19 03:25:47 2015 UTC,"To add: do you own a .22 pistol. Another option is to get a 9 that you can also buy a conversion kit for. Then you have 2 guns with 1 frame.  If you're just getting into pistol shooting, nothing beats thousands of rounds down range and .22 is as cheap as you can get."

canadaguns,3a909x,Styrak,2,Thu Jun 18 10:03:16 2015 UTC,"I'm sure other people have said this but....  Please please please do not buy a firearm based solely on cost, you get what you pay for, this doesn't mean drop a bajillion dollars on a gun but cheap guns feel cheap, there are exceptions but get a few friend with a few different guns and try them out, get what feels right in your hand, not on someones recommendation, that doesn't mean disregard advice but take it with a grain of salt, don't base decisions on range guns either, they are worn out and are usually loose and sloppy because of the abuse and amount of ammo they go through.  First hand experience is the best way to decide....  That being said buy a CZ shadow or SIG 1911 Super Target (it's a .45 though) haha jk this is just my opinion, take it with a grain of salt. I have a SIG 1911 and a glock 34, used to love the glock, but the sig 1911 feels amazing and great, the weight of an all metal gun feels solid, I know they are different calibers but it is only advice."
canadaguns,3a909x,kedirkin,1 point,Thu Jun 18 16:17:47 2015 UTC,"Take a look at a Jericho as well. Very reliable and have steel and polymer options.  Range kits will run you 650-750 depending on polymer vs plastic.  Its based off the cz75 and takes the same mags. Range kits come with 3 mags, holster and mag holster.    Polymer framed was my first gun but i have since decided I prefer steel frames so thats what ive got now.    Otherwise from your list, id go with the girsan."
canadaguns,3a909x,jeepeeQC,1 point,Thu Jun 18 06:01:01 2015 UTC,I like the Jericho (haven't handled one) but the trigger looks like the CZ which is curved and it wasn't very comfortable on the finger.
canadaguns,3a909x,Stealth0710,1 point,Thu Jun 18 07:43:25 2015 UTC,"Interesting.  I've never had troubles with the curved trigger.  If anything it helps give me a better reference point so I can ensure consistent trigger finger placement.  Were you shooting in both SA an DA? Because I know the DA pull is long and heavy on the jericho.  The SA is very light and short.  Best of luck with your hunt.   If possible, try out the guns at a local range before making your decision. Also nice if your LGS will let you dryfire (but many wont)."

canadaguns,3a8rho,airchinapilot,4,Thu Jun 18 05:05:55 2015 UTC,Well now you've had experience and know what to expect and since you've passed the first one and know what you did wrong there's nothing to be nervous about with the second.

canadaguns,3a4w8z,varsil,20,Wed Jun 17 06:34:07 2015 UTC,Are soft cases with a locked zipper and a pistol inside with a trigger lock considered legal transport?
canadaguns,3a4w8z,airchinapilot,12,Wed Jun 17 07:44:02 2015 UTC,"There's never been a case around this specifically, but you couldn't pay me enough to use one. You can get through a zipper in two seconds with a pen. In court it'd be absolutely devastating, and I'd expect a conviction."
canadaguns,3a4w8z,airchinapilot,6,Wed Jun 17 15:29:51 2015 UTC,Thanks. It just seems that every store sells a shit load of soft cases and you have to admit carrying a soft case is a lot lighter than a hard case.
canadaguns,3a4w8z,Donny_Brook,3,Wed Jun 17 15:33:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah.  And lots and lots of people tell me they use them.  I wince every time.  If it went to trial the best case is that you have an honest officer who demonstrates on the stand how you can get the gun out without breaking the lock very rapidly, and reclose the zipper to erase all signs it happened.  Judge would be likely to convict.    Worst case scenario is that you get a dishonest cop who does this at the roadside, and then testifies that your handgun (with a trigger lock) was just rattling around free in your trunk."
canadaguns,3a4w8z,cory61,2,Wed Jun 17 16:59:45 2015 UTC,The trunk statement has me confused. I can't find anywhere saying I have to keep my handguns in the trunk and most times I do use a hard case but have many times transported a single handgun in a soft case and sat it right on the seat opposite me in my truck. (Never unattended) I also shoot with a lot of cops and for the most part it's an even mix of soft cases or hard.  I understand the problems that can arise from a soft case and the ease of access but once a thief has your case they're getting in no matter what it's locked with.   Is there any law at all claiming I have to transport anything gun related (ammo or gun) in the trunk of a vehicle?  In a pick up truck that I'm behind the wheel of is there any way I can be charged if a soft case with a handgun in it is on the seat beside me?  Thanks for coming here and taking the time to respond to a few questions.
canadaguns,3a4w8z,death_hawk,7,Wed Jun 17 17:49:22 2015 UTC,"Not necessary for it to be in your trunk, unless the vehicle is being left unattended."
canadaguns,3a4w8z,death_hawk,1 point,Wed Jun 17 18:18:14 2015 UTC,Wouldn't a trunk be a loackable container suitable to store a gun in?
canadaguns,3a4w8z,death_hawk,2,Thu Jun 18 21:34:42 2015 UTC,Short answer:  Nope. You need another lockable container inside the trunk.
canadaguns,3a4w8z,DeadlyTedly,2,Fri Jun 19 06:19:16 2015 UTC,"I thought the ""ruling"" (I can't think of a better word) behind this was that anything that required a ""tool"" to get into counted as ""secure"". Wouldn't a pen be a ""tool"" in this case?"
canadaguns,3a4w8z,haun0002,4,Wed Jun 17 18:11:07 2015 UTC,"You can do it with a finger if you need to.  A pen is just easier.  Also, there is a case making mention of a tool, but I suspect it would be not followed where the tool is ""pretty much any stiff object"" and the amount of effort required is ""almost none"".    That said, a lot would probably hinge on the other circumstances, such as whether the accused was sympathetic.  A guy going to/from the gun range with a license and permits and all of that is a lot more likely to get a favourable ruling than the same guy who is also found with a kilogram of cocaine in the trunk.    Which is why the Crown will probably wait to push this issue until they find the ""kilogram of cocaine in the trunk"" case.  I say probably because they may well not."
canadaguns,3a4w8z,alkali_feldspar,1 point,Wed Jun 17 18:17:04 2015 UTC,You can do it with a finger if you need to.      Hmm. I've never tried that. I always thought a finger would be too fat to be of any use.     Thanks for doing this by the way
canadaguns,3a4w8z,1leggeddog,3,Wed Jun 17 18:33:09 2015 UTC,"It's hard, but it can be done.  Easier with practice, and the officer will practice it before he comes to trial so that he can make it look seamless.    The other thing that makes for a great tool for getting through the zipper is actually the gun itself."
canadaguns,3a4w8z,shorrty,1 point,Wed Jun 17 19:37:28 2015 UTC,That... seems crooked. Then again... most of these laws are crooked.
canadaguns,3a4w8z,Trees4All0420,2,Wed Jun 17 19:57:55 2015 UTC,"They do it fairly often with knife cases.  If a knife can be flicked open by a really strong guy doing something just right in just the right way, then you can expect that the officer testifying will be a gorilla who has logged twenty hours of practice with that specific knife to make it look effortless."
canadaguns,3a4w8z,WolfDrifter,2,Wed Jun 17 20:02:44 2015 UTC,"Not sure if you've dealt with this before, but Canadian Tire even sells Kershaw knives with rear rear assist.  Like this.  Have you ever heard of a case tried that got a conviction for these types of asssits?"
canadaguns,3a4w8z,WolfDrifter,1 point,Wed Jun 17 23:22:32 2015 UTC,"They're legal.  I own...  more than a few.  I've seen people charged for them, but have always been able to get those charges pulled before trial for my clients.  There may be convictions out there...  sometimes lawyers who aren't familiar with the laws on weapons plead their clients out for all sorts of stupid things, unfortunately."
canadaguns,3a4w8z,osmonde,3,Thu Jun 18 05:07:56 2015 UTC,I would love an answer to this.
canadaguns,3a4w8z,jeepeeQC,1 point,Wed Jun 17 12:41:30 2015 UTC,Yes. Asked CFO they said it was good.
canadaguns,3a4w8z,Andrewrox96,12,Wed Jun 17 13:55:51 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't take the CFO's legal advice. They aren't qualified to give it, and have repeatedly told me things that are blatantly wrong."
canadaguns,3a4w8z,Andrewrox96,4,Wed Jun 17 15:34:17 2015 UTC,"Wait, a CFO that doesn't know their own law they were put in to uphold?  no way...  # sarcasm"

canadaguns,3a4w8z,mintychips,12,Wed Jun 17 18:46:17 2015 UTC,"If a member of a household, who isn't a firearm owner, is caught with drugs (marijuana - personal use) are the legal firearms of others in the home in jeopardy of being seized? Or do the charges / seizures start and end with the drugs?"
canadaguns,3a4w8z,MetricMachinist,10,Wed Jun 17 15:05:25 2015 UTC,"If that member gets a firearm prohibition, they can seek to remove firearms in the house belonging to other people. Fighting this requires showing that the prohibited person cannot gain access. Which usually means above and beyond storage regs. Also, if they search the house for drugs they may seize firearms belonging to others in the sweep. Sometimes those other people may end up with careless/contrary to regs charges."
canadaguns,3a4w8z,svodiwuejkxlkadfuiop,2,Wed Jun 17 12:19:44 2015 UTC,What would happen if said person caught with drugs had a valid firearms license? Would he still be charged for the firearms even if they were stored properly?
canadaguns,3a4w8z,crenom,2,Wed Jun 17 15:36:56 2015 UTC,"Assuming they had all the licenses/documents/etc, and there were no firearm-related laws being broken, they'd likely seize all the firearms under the 'public safety' grounds in the Criminal Code, and then seek to have them forfeited to the Crown.  If they succeed at that they go directly to Her Majesty's Royal Chop Saw."
canadaguns,3a4w8z,DeadlyTedly,7,Thu Jun 18 00:36:14 2015 UTC,"Hello, I live in B.C. Is it true that in Canada you can't use your gun for self defence of an intruder is in your house? Is this true for pistols or rifles? I am getting my PAL soon and people keep telling me this in an attempt to deter me from getting my licence."
canadaguns,3a4w8z,mintychips,16,Thu Jun 18 05:05:23 2015 UTC,"Not true.  However, using firearms for self-defence is very tricky.    The first thing to keep in mind is storage of the firearm.  Your firearm must be legally stored when not in use (and keeping it by your bedside for ""just in case"" is storage, not use).  Most legal storage means make it difficult to access a firearm rapidly in a situation where you might need it.    Assuming you can get your gun out, the next thing to consider is that nearly everything you might do with it is illegal from the outset.  That includes loading it in your house, pointing it at an intruder, discharging it...  your justification would need to be self-defence.    Self-defence itself (and the boundaries of it) is an incredibly complicated topic that is incredibly dependant on the specific facts of the case.  As a general rule of thumb where the use of a firearm is concerned is that if you have any option but to fire, you shouldn't be firing from a legal perspective.  If you're sitting there wondering about the legal ramifications, you're probably not at a point where you can legally shoot.    Keep in mind that the ""intruder in the house at night"" scenario is actually really rare.  Burglars usually prefer to avoid people.  They rob houses during workday hours to avoid encountering anyone, and often case a house to be sure it'll be empty, including ringing doorbells to check occupancy.  Other burglars prefer home invasions, and those generally begin with a knock on the door and an immediate attack on the person who opens it--either incapacitating force or else a lethal threat--so as to gain control of them."
canadaguns,3a4w8z,CruelHandLuke7,5,Wed Jun 17 06:38:14 2015 UTC,"Thank you very much! I doubt I will ever be in that desperate of a situation, just wondering."
canadaguns,3a4w8z,stayedclassy,2,Wed Jun 17 06:49:34 2015 UTC,"What do you think the results would be if during a home invasion you scared off the intruders by having a firearm at the ready, but not taking a shot? Say you have a loaded shotgun pointed at them and they run off. Are there going to be ramifications for having that loaded weapon pointed at someone, even though you believed yourself to be in danger?"
canadaguns,3a4w8z,stayedclassy,6,Wed Jun 17 08:21:51 2015 UTC,"You may end up charged with pointing a firearm, careless use, and potentially other charges.  Whether they'd push for charges and whether they'd stick would depend a lot on circumstances."
canadaguns,3a4w8z,SidneyCanadas,5,Wed Jun 17 17:18:48 2015 UTC,"To be honest, if I ever have to do that, I would then simply store the gun back and don't tell the cops about it."
canadaguns,3a4w8z,SidneyCanadas,8,Wed Jun 17 18:23:15 2015 UTC,What if someone where stabbed with a sks bayonet and the sks was trigger locked and the action removed. Or beat up with a stock. Would it be just a weapon or still a firearm incident?
canadaguns,3a4w8z,JohnoTheFoolish,5,Wed Jun 17 21:45:52 2015 UTC,"Still a firearm incident under the law, though there might be an angle to craft new law with respect to the charge and its appropriateness under those circumstances. In the case of the action being removed things get a lot more complicated, and will depend heavily on the specific facts of the case."
canadaguns,3a4w8z,1leggeddog,3,Wed Jun 17 14:26:31 2015 UTC,Interesting that sort of settles a debate I had with a friend.
canadaguns,3a4w8z,1leggeddog,8,Wed Jun 17 15:44:16 2015 UTC,What is your opinion on the legality of .50 Beowulf mags and using .223 in them?
canadaguns,3a4w8z,zod201,9,Wed Jun 17 16:55:51 2015 UTC,"As the law is written, fully legal.  A magazine is either legal or prohibited, and does not change classification based on how you use it."
canadaguns,3a4w8z,death_hawk,5,Wed Jun 17 15:05:34 2015 UTC,"Is it legal to store a pistol inside a case like this:  http://www.costco.com/Sentry%C2%AESafe--QAP1E-Quick-Access-Pistol-Safe.product.11755573.html  ...empty gun with no trigger lock, but next to a loaded magazine, which is also in the locked pistol safe?  Also worth mentioning it has been bolted to a chest-of-drawers and can't easily be removed from it."
canadaguns,3a4w8z,death_hawk,7,Wed Jun 17 16:31:39 2015 UTC,"This should qualify as a safe. So yes, that should be entirely legal storage.   As an aside, I own exactly that model of safe."
canadaguns,3a4w8z,death_hawk,2,Wed Jun 17 09:53:15 2015 UTC,"Wait, I thought that ammo must be stored separately From the firearm? So would a loaded magazine in said safe next to the firearm not be improper storage?"
canadaguns,3a4w8z,death_hawk,1 point,Wed Jun 17 15:38:01 2015 UTC,"For anyone interested in this safe, here it is on Costco Canada's website:  http://www.costco.ca/Sentry%C2%AESafe-Quick-Access-Safe.product.100014292.html"

canadaguns,3a4w8z,Northwesthip,7,Wed Jun 17 16:07:24 2015 UTC,"As others have noted, this is perfectly legal storage in a safe, which the above should qualify as. No need for a trigger lock in a safe."
canadaguns,3a4w8z,bw11011,1 point,Wed Jun 17 10:12:45 2015 UTC,Good taste.  I have almost the exact same thing.  I figured that was the easiest way to comply with the law and be accessible.
canadaguns,3a4w8z,Golanthanatos,6,Wed Jun 17 15:39:02 2015 UTC,"But it's a safe designed to hold firearms (it's marketed as a quick access pistol safe), so would that mean that it doesn't need a trigger lock/cable lock?"
canadaguns,3a4w8z,Golanthanatos,2,Wed Jun 17 23:25:28 2015 UTC,"That's the US site, so it's design and intended purpose is more likely in line with US law. The other posters were right in saying that you still need a lock.   However, that doesn't stop you from using a combo lock, setting it at the combo and just leaving it ready to open for quick access. Is that ""legal"".......not really.......but if there was an intruder the police will see the safe and the lock on the ground.   If you're that concerned about an intruder, buy a nice short barreled shotgun. NR's have much less stringent storage laws.  Nothing says ""I mean business"" like the racking of a 12 gauge pump."
canadaguns,3a4w8z,Golanthanatos,5,Wed Jun 17 10:23:47 2015 UTC,"The problem is that your trigger locked NR shotgun can't be stored ""readily accessible"" to ammunition, which usually means the ammunition needs to be in another room.  Nothing says ""Not yet ready for business"" like getting up,  removing a trigger lock, running to another room and only then being able to rack that pump.    It's easier to have a handgun in a 'rapidly available to use' form, while still complying with all of the legislation.  Get a small pistol safe (should be a security safe, not a fire safe, IMO).  Handgun can be stored (unloaded) in that without a trigger lock, and with a couple of charged magazines (not inserted into the firearm) in the safe with it."
canadaguns,3a4w8z,Golanthanatos,6,Wed Jun 17 12:10:47 2015 UTC,"Verified to the Mods. /u/varsil is a Firearms Lawyer in Alberta, and confirmed through personal contact."

canadaguns,3a4w8z,Jobbo_Fett,4,Wed Jun 17 20:33:28 2015 UTC,"My Halifax, Nova Scotia CFO Office (Chief Firearms Office) told me that I must belong to a gun club before they will allow a transfer of a restricted firearm I intend to purchase from a dealer in another province into my name. The Firearm's Act DOES NOT STATE THAT and the Firearm's Act is federal as we all know which overrides any ""personal beliefs"" any officer has.  I was told by fellow Reddit members and others to get a refusal/denial in writing (a letter), take it to court and when the judge sees it, I automatically win.   Well my question to you is, since I am in Nova Scotia, could I go to court on my own without a lawyer?, if so which court (small claims or provincial)?, also I have never done this before so how do I go about getting a court date?, what forms do I fill out?, how does the CFO officer know I am taking them to court?, any fees?, if I win (which I should) what do I do after I win (to get my transfer approved)?.  Also after Bill C-42 becomes official law, will my present RPAL licence have the automatic ATT permits on it? or do I have to renew it before it becomes automatic?. Presently I don't have any paper ATT permits and never had any.  Thank you.  Sidney  Nova Scotia"
canadaguns,3a4w8z,alkali_feldspar,5,Wed Jun 17 20:58:35 2015 UTC,I intend to use my restricted firearm at any of these free 23 or so DNR shooting ranges (provided by our tax Dollars) which are approved by the Dept of Justice and ATT permits are easily obtained as I was told numerous different times by different DNR conservation/wildlife officers:  Updated list of the 23 or so free DNR shooting ranges:  http://novascotia.ca/natr/srbs  http://novascotia.ca/natr/srbs/ranges  http://www.gov.ns.ca/natr/hunt/Range_Locns.asp  http://web.archive.org/web/20080531033334/http://www.gov.ns.ca/natr/hunt/Range_Locns.htm  http://www.atlantichuntered.ca/ns/ranges.htm  Sidney
canadaguns,3a4w8z,Wanhope,3,Wed Jun 17 11:15:34 2015 UTC,"Just FYI, some of the DNR ranges do not permit restricted firearms, have various limitations on calibre, or are set up in a way that makes firing certain types of weapons difficult or impractical.  e.g. The Sibley Road location has a 100yd firing point with a bench and a wooden baffle. The range rules state  that all weapons must be discharged from the bench with the projectile passing through the baffle. This would make handguns and shotguns impractical for that location (it also specifically prohibits handguns and calibres above .308).  The DNR website lists province-wide rules for public ranges and some of the individual ranges' rules. Your best bet is to check the conditions of the ranges you intend to use as there should be a sign posted (or try calling the local DNR office)."
canadaguns,3a4w8z,Jobbo_Fett,5,Wed Jun 17 12:30:27 2015 UTC,"There's no ""automatically win"" in court. The first hurdle you'll encounter is that they've adopted a strategy to try to prevent court challenges by refusing to issue proper denials/refusals. I've currently got a court case going on around that issue to try to force them not to do this.   If you get a refusal in the proper form it'd include details about how to challenge it. That'd be in provincial court.   You show up at the courthouse, fill out the forms, pay whatever fees the province sets for that (I don't know NS court rules), and they set a date. If you win, the judge orders the CFO to issue the relevant docs.   After C-42 becomes law any new RPAL gets the ATT condition, as does any renewal. It doesn't automagically apply to every RPAL already issued."
canadaguns,3a4w8z,Wanhope,3,Wed Jun 17 14:58:06 2015 UTC,"After C-42 becomes law any new RPAL gets the ATT condition, as does any renewal. It doesn't automagically apply to every RPAL already issued.    Apparently that's not true:   To clarify, and this comes directly from the Minister Blaney's office: ""The phrase 'upon renewal' just means that as long as the person has a license and is in good standing, they are authorized to transport to the approved locations.""   I just read that from the Facebook page ""Caliber""."
canadaguns,3a4w8z,Jobbo_Fett,3,Wed Jun 17 15:57:25 2015 UTC,"Minister Blaney isn't really a good source of legal information either.  The law as written is pretty clear, and contradicts that, as any license that is renewed must have these conditions added to it.  Until you get a new license that has those conditions on it, then you don't have the conditions."
canadaguns,3a4w8z,Krazee9,1 point,Wed Jun 17 18:24:49 2015 UTC,Minister Blaney isn't really a good source of legal information either.   ... wow if the poeple in charge aren't a good source of legal information...  sigh  love this country more and more everyday...
canadaguns,3a4w8z,Wanhope,3,Wed Jun 17 18:45:47 2015 UTC,"Politicians should be generally presumed to know absolutely nothing about the law.  Which is why you have MPs in Parliament talking about how Bill C-42 will allow you to move guns around with no restrictions whatsoever, or to get guns without a license, and other complete horse puckey."
canadaguns,3a4w8z,Wanhope,1 point,Wed Jun 17 18:49:24 2015 UTC,How does this effect the CFO's simply not issuing licence renewals for people that lack memberships to gun clubs?   My father lapsed on his gun club membership and the CFO (in BC) refused to renew his licence until he did.
canadaguns,3a4w8z,IrenaeusGSaintonge,1 point,Wed Jun 17 19:38:38 2015 UTC,"This is something that should be challenged in court.  Unfortunately they've been playing a silly game with trying to avoid issuing proper refusals (""We're not refusing you, sir, we're just not granting your application"").    Something I'm currently fighting with them about in court.  Won in Queen's Bench, now they're trying to appeal it to the Court of Appeal."

In context, a person without a PAL may operate firearms as long as a licensed individual is within a safe controllable distance. I have heard earshot, 5 meters, and an arms length from the Feds, CFO office, and master instructors respectively.  I would like to know if this term has ever come up in a court of law and how it was defined/handled."
canadaguns,3a4w8z,MondoStud,3,Wed Jun 17 18:14:11 2015 UTC,Haven't seen any case where it's come up.  The burden would be on the Crown to show that it was not such a distance.    In terms of what I personally feel comfortable with when teaching people I generally go with the rule of thumb that I should be within range to grab them if they start to do something stupid.  Arm's length is the smartest play there.  Keep in mind that one of the easiest ways to show not a safe controllable distance is to show a failure to intercede.  Think about what you'd be able to do if your friend decided to peer down the barrel while holding their finger on the trigger.

canadaguns,3a4w8z,GBU-28,2,Wed Jun 17 10:02:27 2015 UTC,Is there anything legally to contradicts my understanding that my semi-automatic belt-fed firearm can legally be used to hunt in the province of Ontario (Or elsewhere in Canada)?
canadaguns,3a4w8z,Ryesagain,6,Wed Jun 17 16:32:25 2015 UTC,"Not sure about Ontario, as hunting rules are provincial and I'm in Alberta.  In Alberta this is a legally grey area, due to the rule saying you can't hunt big game with ""an auto-loading firearm that has the capacity to hold more than 5 cartridges in the magazine"".  A belt fed with a 5 round belt might be viewed as legal by a judge, or the judge might view the ability to add more links to the belt as forbidding it."
canadaguns,3a4w8z,Jobbo_Fett,3,Wed Jun 17 08:05:21 2015 UTC,But a belt isn't by definition a magazine. Though I imagine arguing that would be difficult.
canadaguns,3a4w8z,1leggeddog,6,Wed Jun 17 13:53:46 2015 UTC,"In AB most definitions of things are imported from the Criminal Code and Firearms Act. And the definition of magazine from the Firearms Act includes belts. Yes, this is stupid, but it is the legal definition.   I'll have to check later and be sure that magazine is one of those imported terms, but I'm pretty sure it is."
canadaguns,3a4w8z,TheGuyWhoLikesPies,2,Wed Jun 17 13:59:39 2015 UTC,Why wouldn't it be allowed? The only restriction on capacity or hunting specifically in Ontario is on shotguns against migratory waterfowl.  So long as you are also meeting the calibre requirements and aren't using FMJ's you'll be fine.
canadaguns,3a4w8z,Wanhope,3,Wed Jun 17 16:09:52 2015 UTC,"Mostly curious, to be honest.  Also, the thought of hunting deer with a WWII LMG just seems funny in a ridiculous way."

canadaguns,3a4w8z,SNIPE07,2,Wed Jun 17 14:10:43 2015 UTC,The bolt handle sticks out very far and at a right angle to the pistol grip.  Makes it impossible to hard case it.  Easy to remove the barrel though!
canadaguns,3a4w8z,stelos,1 point,Wed Jun 17 14:18:19 2015 UTC,"No need to hard case it, a gun sock is considered a legal case by the hunting regs. As long as it fits in a gunsock, or you go out only during daylight hours, you're fine."

canadaguns,3a4w8z,marcusmatrix,7,Thu Jun 18 05:03:56 2015 UTC,"Pin it again immediately, if not sooner.    There is case law to the effect of ""If your gun/etc becomes illegal due to mechanical failure"" (so, a gun that suddenly becomes full auto, a magazine pin failing, etc) then you have a reasonable period to fix that.  Reasonable here is a 'right freaking now', not an 'I will get around to it'.    Practically speaking, if your rivet falls out at the range and they catch you with it on the way to the Home Depot to pick up a new rivet, you may well get charged.  You'd likely be able to beat that charge in court, but it would not be a fun process.    The other option is just to smash the magazine with a rock.  But, here's the fun thing:  If you dispose of or destroy the magazine as it has become a prohibited device, you are required to report that to a peace officer, firearms officer, or chief firearms officer."
canadaguns,3a4w8z,super_opera_boy,3,Wed Jun 17 14:57:39 2015 UTC,"I had a problem with a regulation 5 round magazine and asked the U.S. manufacturer for a replacement. Even though I pointed out to them that I needed another 5 rounder, they sent a 10 rounder to me. Rather than go through the hassle, I threw the 10 rounder in the garbage (before anyone asks, it was cheap Kel-Tec garbage so it was no big loss). Did I break the law?"
canadaguns,3a4w8z,super_opera_boy,4,Wed Jun 17 16:30:58 2015 UTC,"Technically yes, yes you did.  Not by getting the 10 rounder sent to you (you didn't apparently intend for that to happen), but by failing to report the loss/destruction of a prohibited device."

The second I have a PS90 the magazine can be finicky and I cannot remove the spring and follower without removing the pins, can I remove said pins and replace with a threaded bold and lock washer? or is this illegal? (I'm guessing it is)"
canadaguns,3a4w8z,hakb404,1 point,Wed Jun 17 19:41:44 2015 UTC,"1:  So long as you can't fit a sixth cartridge into the magazine, good to go.  2:  The law:  (5) For the purposes of subsection (4), altering or re-manufacturing a cartridge magazine includes  (a) the indentation of its casing by forging, casting, swaging or impressing;  (b) in the case of a cartridge magazine with a steel or aluminum casing, the insertion and attachment of a plug, sleeve, rod, pin, flange or similar device, made of steel or aluminum, as the case may be, or of a similar material, to the inner surface of its casing by welding, brazing or any other similar method; or  (c) in the case of a cartridge magazine with a casing made of a material other than steel or aluminum, the attachment of a plug, sleeve, rod, pin, flange or similar device, made of steel or of a material similar to that of the magazine casing, to the inner surface of its casing by welding, brazing or any other similar method or by applying a permanent adhesive substance, such as a cement or an epoxy or other glue.  So, assuming a steel/aluminum case, you'd want to add a weld/braze/etc to that bolt and lock washer combination."
canadaguns,3a4w8z,hakb404,2,Wed Jun 17 19:48:19 2015 UTC,"Let me clarify a little as this seems a little confusing to me still.  The reason for a bolt with lock washer is so that it can be removed to allow for cleaning/adjustments as needed (the rounds in a PS90 rotate 90 degrees to feed so the follower is an oddity), the bolt with a lock washer would show it would not be removable without a tool (so no wingnuts :))"

Audit the Bank of Canada’s effect on inflation and gradually phase out government control over the money supply      . Significantly decrease the bureaucratic burden for refugees and asylum seekers and Create sponsorship guidelines whereby organizations and individuals can sponsor immigrants if they are willing to financially support them.   My mother is a retired Canadian Diplomat that worked for CIC, I also had the change to work for various embassies as an intern and can tell you that this policy would without a doubt render all checks and balances in place to stop some of the worst scum of the earth from coming into the country."

You will get some bad eggs, sure, but a society with a functioning legal system deals with these people. We shouldn't let an irrational fear of others prevent people from coming here.  Canada should open wide it's doors for immigrants and refugees.  Absolutely let whoever wants to come here do so.  Anybody who wants to escape the corrupt regimes or brutal poverty of their birth should be welcomed. Immigration is great for a society and great for the economy. I enjoy experiencing a cultural mosaic and I benefit from the division of labour economy. And if they choose to use violence, force and fraud then we'll deal with them but to deny untold tens of millions an opportunity at a wonderful new life here in Canada just because of what might happen is a terrible tragedy."

The system we currently have in place is specifically designed to weed out the dangerous, and those who have nothing to contribute to our society. You have also incorrectly lumped refugees and immigrants together. I was specifically talking about the immigration policy, refugees fall under a completely different umbrella of laws and standards.

With the right legal framework and economic system in place (libertarian, ldo) a massive influx of immigrants would be a tremendous boom to our nation and to these people. It's not like there is any shortage of land here.  We're the second largest nation in terms of land mass with a population roughly the same size as Tokyo. There's also national security implications.  If we had a population in the hundreds of millions or even of a billion people then should heaven forbid we ever get attacked by another powerful nation we'd be much more able to defend our country than if we have only a population of 40 million. Obviously the more people in your country the larger an army you can produce. And the more productive your nation the more tanks and aircraft you can produce. So if we have hundreds of millions of people here, working and trading, and especially if we abandon the economic intervention, inflation and taxation that so hinders economic growth, we could be far wealthier than we are presently especially within the frame work of laissez-faire."

canadaguns,3a69du,spergery,2,Fri Jul 3 18:22:02 2015 UTC,They really should end the bank of Canada. It's just an inflation making machine and each year they adjust the way inflation is measured to justify printing more money. The winners are bankers who get first crack and the newly printed money. The losers are everyone else in the economy. The BoC was only created to lend to the gov't on easy terms. Private banks love it because it removes their need to worry about having their notes accepted at par to other banks (not that they issue them anymore).  Libertarians also believe in the free movement of human beings. Hence why they want to let more immigrants in.  Edit: meh who cares. not sure why i went on this rant sorry.

canadaguns,3a7rya,AltC,2,Wed Jun 17 22:36:58 2015 UTC,I do have a magloader but it is still impossible to load the 10th with it. I have to use my thumb for the last one.
canadaguns,3a7rya,cargonet,5,Wed Jun 17 22:38:30 2015 UTC,Is it the loader that comes with the gun?  This is a real speed loader   http://www.amazon.ca/gp/aw/d/B001HBHNHE/ref=mp_s_a_1_1?qid=1434580910&sr=8-1&pi=SY200_QL40&keywords=maglula&dpPl=1&dpID=41QkD2BM-eL&ref=plSrch
canadaguns,3a7rya,cdnmr,2,Wed Jun 17 22:42:41 2015 UTC,Yes I have the speedloader that comes with the range kit but it looks very much the same as the one you linked.
canadaguns,3a7rya,Red_1977,3,Wed Jun 17 22:45:26 2015 UTC,"The mag loader that comes with it does work for the 10th round, however you have to brace the mag against something and push down hard. It's a pain, but it saves your thumb...and gets a bit easier over time."

Unlike the others it won't drop in with that thing, you'll have to push down on it with some muscle, put your bullet in then press/push it to the back, should work just fine."
canadaguns,3a7rya,diablo_man,5,Thu Jun 18 19:50:02 2015 UTC,"This is a problem with 10 round mags, or mags that are pinned to 10 rounds exactly.  Mags that hold 10 rounds should be pinned to 10.5 rounds to have space to put the 10th round in, and to have space to insert it into the pistol easily."
canadaguns,3a7rya,mwmwmwmwmmdw,2,Wed Jun 17 22:33:54 2015 UTC,"I suppose you could fix that by pulling the pin, filing down the back of the follower a couple millimeters where it hits the rivet pin, then reassembling and use a riveter to put it back to canada spec.  A little mod like that to the follower shouldnt hurt the mag, or cause feeding/binding issues, if done cautiously."

canadaguns,3a7rya,bristow84,1 point,Thu Jun 18 00:31:42 2015 UTC,There are a few youtube videos on how to fix this. I'm on mobile right now but they involve taking the mag apart and filing parts of the follower. It worked for me.
canadaguns,3a7rya,Xeon06,1 point,Thu Jun 18 00:34:22 2015 UTC,The key is the speed loader also Google mods to make them easier I cut the springs in mine and trimmed my followers
canadaguns,3a7rya,Stealth0710,1 point,Thu Jun 18 01:11:58 2015 UTC,"I find that it is easiest to load the first 9 rounds with the speed loader and the last by hand. It seems to be impossible to get the last one in with the speed loader due to it being designed for 10.0000000001 rounds.  There is a mod that can be done. Basically you (carefully) grind down the bottom of the follower. This gives it just that extra bit of room. Some say to also shorten the mag spring. I'm doubtful about the effectives of this, though.  There are videos on YouTube about how to do the mods. Note that I have not actually tried this yet, so I cannot comment on real world effectiveness.  I personally want to take a look at pulling off the extended floor plate to see if it is possible to make a bit extra space for the follower that way."

canadaguns,3a5uzk,RcNorth,7,Wed Jun 17 16:18:51 2015 UTC,"Legal and smart are two entirely removed things.  Further the train likely has a ban on firearms, but I'd have to confirm that."

Our jails can't hold that many people.  If the train doesn't have a ban on firearms then there was another reason, other than carrying a shotgun, that they took him into custody for.  Last summer there was a guy on the Edmonton LRT carrying a long rifle, .22 I think.  I heard lots of comments from the other riders about calling the cops to have him arrested."

canadaguns,3a5uzk,Cheese_Bits,2,Wed Jun 17 15:46:22 2015 UTC,At that distance it probably wouldnt matter for the detained individual by shear force and would still pose significant injury risk to the officers.  Also the shotgun is not a stereotypical less lethal marked gun and much more likely was drawn from the cruiser if the reported story is the call they received. A carbine would be much more appropriate if that were the case but you use what you have.
canadaguns,3a5uzk,hakb404,2,Wed Jun 17 16:23:03 2015 UTC,I think at 10 ft or less ( could be wrong) all less lethal ammo will warn you that it becomes lethal or at least very likely lethal.

Meaning no separate application for it.   EDIT: Found the relevant part of C-42 that changes the Firearms Act:   Subsection 19(2) of the Act is replaced by the following:  (1.1) In the case of an authorization to transport issued for a reason referred to in paragraph (1)(a) within the province where the holder of the authorization resides, the specified places must include all shooting clubs and shooting ranges that are approved under section 29 and that are located in that province.  (2) Despite subsection (1), an individual must not be authorized to transport a prohibited firearm, other than a handgun referred to in subsection 12(6.1), between specified places except for the purposes referred to in paragraph (1)(b).  (2.1) Subject to subsection (2.3), an individ­ual who holds a licence authorizing the individual to possess prohibited firearms or restricted firearms must, if the licence is renewed, be authorized to transport them within the individual’s province of residence  (a) to and from all shooting clubs and shooting ranges that are approved under section 29;  (b) to and from any place a peace officer, firearms officer or chief firearms officer is located, for verification, registration or disposal in accordance with this Act or Part III of the Criminal Code;  (c) to and from a business that holds a licence authorizing it to repair or appraise prohibited firearms or restricted firearms;  (d) to and from a gun show; and  (e) to a port of exit in order to take them outside Canada, and from a port of entry."

My guess would be that the procedures for ATTs out of your home province would be the same as today: Call the CFO's office of the province you'll be travelling through and get a STATT for the time you're in there. Same for if you're moving, but since your ""province of residence"" will be updated when you call in, you won't need to get a new LTATT for your new home province.   The word ""province"" now looks weird thanks to semantic satiation..."

canadaguns,3a2sa8,SidneyCanadas,1 point,Tue Jun 16 21:57:25 2015 UTC,"This brings up a whole big interesting question though. So earlier this year I had to pay 80 dollars for their ATT course, and do 4 probationary shoots.  I can't see silverdale just walking away from that money (or any range really, since they all required one) so will they now say if you wanna bring a restricted there, you must take the course?   Previously you could have had an ATT from another range, and bring your restricteds there with the letter off their site. But maybe now they won't be happy that no ranges get this money or safety completion.   If this need is just out the window, I feel like you are going to see some pretty pissed off RO's at certain people's lack of safety practices."
canadaguns,3a2sa8,ctcsupplies,2,Tue Jun 16 22:45:12 2015 UTC,"Meanwhile, I'll be happy that I won't have to pay money to do CFO-mandated safety courses that are unique to Ontario and Quebec that I have to work my schedule around, no matter how arbitrary they may be, and instead I can just go to the range and shoot like the people in every other province.  The safety course is Ontario-only (Quebec has a similar, but independent system), just like the club having to apply for your ATT for you. I don't hear about tons of shooting accidents on ranges out west where it's not a requirement. I honestly feel the courses are a detrimental hurdle to getting into shooting."

And I'm assuming they mean it's a more iron clad written classification.   A lot of our classifications have been somewhat ambiguous. Example: to say ar15's and ar15 variants. Really armalite and colt make the only ar15's legally because they own the rights to the name. But the name itself has come to mean that style of rifle, in every day talk. So the government used the catch all, ""ar15 variant"" so we can assume the norinco cqa counts, because it looks and shares most of the same specs as a true ar15. But legally speaking, that's pretty open ended. I'm sure someone uninformed would argue that little plastic .22 mossburg plinkster that looks like an ar15 can be counted as an ar15 variant, ""because they look the same.""   By creating a statutory category, we'll see more iron clad lists of what is non restricted, and thus, making it much harder to take something from that list, and move it to another list.

There is simply too much racial representation in the crime stats in the US to ignore them as not having some sort of play in the issue of crime.  There is a disproportionate amount of Black and Hispanic people involved in Crime in the United States. Here in Canada, there is a disproportionate amount of First Nations people involved in Crime.  Something is seriously wrong with that. What is it that is causing this? Is it a lack of education, a lack of economic opportunity, a break down in community, a loss of family values, or who knows?.  But there is a serious problem with the over representation of certain races in Canadian/US criminal justice stats.    Not accounting for those problems of over representation, and then trying to compare the US with a homogeneous country like Finland just doesn't work.

Because of our awful historical treatment of the first nations people they often fall into the poor and under educated demographic. Race isn't directly related to crime.

Its a conflict with other individuals, the community, or the state.  Knowing that it is conflict, and not acknowledging the roles which race and culture play in that conflict is absurd.  Race has everything to do with it.  White people just feel bad and guilty when talking about race because white people are historically responsible for handing non-whites the shitty end of the stick.  So they don't want to be labelled as a racist, and anyone who looks at race as a factor to anything is quickly refuted as a racist.

We don't need any more of that here in Canada.  We have 2 Senators retiring this year, including Government Leader Marjory LeBreton. So that would be an extra election for Ontario and for Quebec.  2016 brings 4 Senators retiring, 2017 brings 8 retiring, 2018 brings 7 retiring, 2019 brings 7 retiring, and 2020 brings another 7.  That is a lot of elections in 5 years.  On top of that, there is no proof that an elected Senate would be any better. It might be even worse, now that the Senate has an actual mandate to do what it wants, instead of the convention of mostly going along with the will of the House.     theoretically all their bills would be sent back because the libs and cons control the house and not enough senators would retire for them to be able to have enough seats as it is   A theory requires a modicum of evidence.

Certain cars shouldn't be allowed to anyone, while others should only be available to government officials, the military, or law enforcement.        Carbon fiber should be illegal, it makes cars look black and menacing.  There's no research or evidence to support the previous claim, but that doesn't matter.          Certain models or manufacturers are illegal.  The capabilities of the car don't matter in these cases.  Cars that are similar to currently banned models may also be subject to bans or restrictions at any time, even if internally they are incompatible.          Certain changes to cars are illegal.  It is illegal to change a car's stereo without paperwork from the government authorizing such a change.  The exhaust system, or suspension, may not be modified in any way.             Along with modifications or upgrades, a car cannot have more or less cup holders than the manufacturer's factory standard.   If a cup holder is broken or damaged, it must be replaced.      Licensed individuals may only purchase a sedan, hatchback, or station wagon configured vehicle.  A second, harder-to-get license is required for an individual to acquire and possess an SUV or Van.  Sports cars, Muscle cars and Motorcycles are prohibited and may only be purchased by those individuals with the appropriate license.  One may only obtain such a license if it is grandfathered to them.              I'm sure there's more, whatever."

The military does have access to vehicles that Canadian civilians aren't allowed to own.  Certain changes to cars are illegal.   The car must pass a safety inspection, so it can't be broken or damaged.  There are all sorts of special licences for vehicles. Motorcycles, semi trailers, multi-axle vehicles, taxi/limos, buses.  I dunno, it seems like there are some similarities."

The military does have access to vehicles that Canadian civilians aren't allowed to own.           Sure, if it's weaponized military tech.  Civilians (as far as I know) are allowed to own de-militarized stuff like tanks, APCs, armoured cars, etc.   See: Private ownership of WW2 aircraft and tanks            Tinted windows always seemed like a weird thing to make illegal.           Safety inspections the way you put it sounds more like QA from a manufacturer.   I don't feel it applies, but that's just me.         There are all sorts of special licences for vehicles. Motorcycles, semi trailers, multi-axle vehicles, taxi/limos, buses.

canadaguns,39ztr5,Jobbo_Fett,1 point,Tue Jun 16 15:21:23 2015 UTC,"Very important difference. All laws to cars only apply once you take it on a public road. You can do whatever the hell you want to a car on private land.   Speed Limits? Nope  Safety Inspection? Nope  Drivers License? Nope  Insurance? Nope.  The difference is that the laws apply to you always with a firearm, and only apply when in public with a vehicle.

canadaguns,39ztr5,hms11,2,Tue Jun 16 17:40:52 2015 UTC,"The speed limit is 110 at best on Canadian roads, so any car that can go faster than that needs to be illegal, or have a rivet installed in the accelerator pedal. Given the rules of the road, there also is really no legitimate reason to own an assault sports car, so those should be prohibited or restricted, to be driven to and from licensed race tracks only (sports car = any car that has a spoiler, vents on the hood, or more than one exhaust pipe). The same obviously applies to motorcycles, which have no legitimate use at all, and are popular tools of criminals. All motorcycles with more than 497cc displacement are prohibited.  Certain cars that have been featured in movies are prohibited by name. This includes all models and variations of the cars seen in the ""Fast and Furious"" series of movies. This one just makes total sense - hundreds or thousands of people have died in Honda Civics, for example, so it makes sense to make this type of assault vehicle illegal.  Getting your drivers license requires 2 character references, a signature from your ex-wife if applicable, and a background check that takes 4 months to complete. If your license expires and you still have a motor vehicle, you are a felon subject to 10 years in jail."

A second, harder-to-get license is required for an individual to acquire and possess an SUV or Van.     This should actually be a thing too.

Cars are the real killers here, has anyone not seen maximum overdrive.  edit i made a custom table on statcan,  edit2 if statcan link is not working, i uploaded screens to imgur.   http://imgur.com/a/hv6KY http://www5.statcan.gc.ca/cansim/a47 https://www.tc.gc.ca/media/documents/roadsafety/TrafficCollisionStatisitcs_2011.pdf http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/pubs/fire-feu-eval/t2a-eng.htm"

canadaguns,39x5ab,ctcsupplies,7,Tue Jun 16 21:45:23 2015 UTC,"Invited Bob Sopuck, Conservative chair of the Hunting and Angling Caucus and member of the standing committee on the Environment and Fisheries to Metro Vancouver. Gave a great speech at a partisan fundraiser at Rivers Reach Pub as he gave some great insights into C-42, optimism to gun owners and how the Conservatives plan to hold the majority. BCWF took him sturgeon fishing on Saturday and then he was the keynote speaker at the PCDHFC Annual Game dinner and talked about the government's accomplishments protecting hunting, sports shooting and angling in Canada. So much great food, delicious wild game, good time with lots of friends and some great door prizes by some great sponsors.   Also managed to fit in a bike ride to the Trout Lake farmers market and Italian Day at Commercial Drive.   Good weekend."
canadaguns,39x5ab,Metcarfre,2,Mon Jun 15 15:19:24 2015 UTC,"So - after hearing him speak, what is your feeling about firearms legislation in the future?"
canadaguns,39x5ab,airchinapilot,4,Mon Jun 15 15:27:28 2015 UTC,"Great speakers have a way of making you feel good about yourself and Bob is a great speaker.  His optimism is very refreshing and he laid it out pretty simply.  Shooting is a growing sport and changes with firearms legislation is a slow but going in the positive direction.  He reminded us the the largest growth in shooting sports are women, and non-traditional shooters (young urban professionals, vegetarians, etc) and that we should be welcoming and open to them.  As well there has a been a significant shift in opinion about gun control.  People realize it's not the gun that causes the problem, its the person behind it.    Case in point - the Moncton shooting of Cst Ross, Gevaudan, Larche and more recently the Edmonton shooting of Cst. Woodall.  We all are aware that we are pretty much one mass shooting away from the expected mass prohibition of firearms. However with ALL the past tragedies nothing has happened.  The voice of gun control has been silenced so far.  Even the mayor of Edmonton had to backpedal from his LGR response.  He echoed Wayne Easter's comment that the LGR cost the Liberals 60 seats.  The Conservatives don't want to burn a big number of seats, so it goes slow."
canadaguns,39x5ab,Metcarfre,2,Mon Jun 15 16:31:17 2015 UTC,"I think the part that needs to be reinforced, is that we need to be welcome and open to ALL shooters.  None of this fudd vs black gun vs ipsc vs whatever.  It's splintered in a way that can only harm"
canadaguns,39x5ab,ctcsupplies,3,Mon Jun 15 16:36:38 2015 UTC,"If there were a way of getting in to the sport other than ""know someone who's already in to it"" it would be great.  A Canadian Appleseed or ""intro to shooting"" courses/days at ranges would be great."
canadaguns,39x5ab,airchinapilot,5,Mon Jun 15 17:43:24 2015 UTC,"I've heard the same desire expressed a lot. A Canadian appleseed without the propaganda would be great.   A bit related, I know at our club we've had some issues with the Scouts organization. Various Scout groups would like to come up and shoot and be introduced to shooting but the Scouts organization as a whole will not allow them to sign waivers. They basically want the Club to take on all the liability which we will not do. It's unfortunate because we've even had parents come up and say they would like to do it. There may be a way just not as an organization like that.  And then we see idiocy on a national level like when the Navy League said their kids would no longer be allowed to parade with anything that looked like a rifle because of the optics of it. Uhh.. yea the kids who are uniformed like they are in the military.   Having a formal - intro to shooting - type affair would be interesting. One factor that must be considered that is part of the Scouts issue is that anyone who is providing 'instruction' per se is opening themselves up to liability. If you provide instruction and not just 'allowing someone you know to shoot your gun' you could be liable if they then go on to have an accident and point the finger back at your instruction."

We had roughly 40 people show, and it was a high energy event with a good MP and everyone had a lot of fun. We talked gun politics, current efforts and future efforts, and things that we want to see. The minister is a man that truly gets it, and we had a great time chatting with him and trading stories.   Saturday was the POCO Game Banquet dinner. The food was fantastic, the company was good, and Sopuck was able to do a great speech for the club. My girlfriend and I stuffed ourselves so much that we didn't eat again until late Sunday evening, and only a half can of soup. A big thanks is deserved for my mother, who planned and organized the banquet this year, and put on a damn good show for everyone.  Overall, a really good and successful weekend."

I won a Colt Canada range bag that's better than my previous eight or so range bags. I realized I have like 20 different bags for one thing or another. That comes from having a previous photography hobby, as well.  (Thanks to all of our sponsors!)  Sunday I practiced reloading my Mossberg JM Pro so I am not completely inept for an upcoming Tac-shotgun match (this Saturday) and for the Lone Butte 3-Gun Championship in July.

I don't know if they understand ""resisting confiscation"" in this case means shooting cops.   Some 20something girl at the bench next to me was very intrigued with my AR and asked to shoot it. Her fudd commander dad seemed to take issue with this and fudded his way over to talk about my ""assault rifle"" being ""deadlier than his .270"" and then opined on why nobody needed more than 5 rounds in a magazine."

Still though, when you consider that I bought a flat before tax for $64, and how 5 rounds of skeet or trap is half the flat, and 5 rounds is easy to shoot in an afternoon, and there are many afternoons in spring/summer/fall where you'd do that, it's pretty clear why they say shooting sports aren't cheap. It all adds up. And the gun is the cheap part of it all, really."
canadaguns,39x5ab,tletang,2,Mon Jun 15 15:33:34 2015 UTC,$64?   You are getting a free round.  $70 anywhere near me.
canadaguns,39x5ab,tletang,2,Mon Jun 15 19:19:57 2015 UTC,I got it at SAIL. It's weird - the signs say $72 on sale for $64! - but this sale has been going on for at least a year.  They must have bought like 5 billion boxes of target loads or something.
canadaguns,39x5ab,NoxiousDogCloud,2,Mon Jun 15 19:25:11 2015 UTC,"I just bought some at SAIL, Burlington on Saturday...signs in the store have been at $69.99 for around a year now.

canadaguns,39x5ab,Cubiclehero,2,Mon Jun 15 19:53:36 2015 UTC,Cambridge is a bit of a pain in the ass to get in/out of. And the store is pretty much exactly the same as Burlington. I'd say if Burlington is significantly closer to you it's probably worth the extra $4 a flat.

canadaguns,39x5ab,BeaverNutz,2,Mon Jun 15 15:27:45 2015 UTC,It's incredibly easy to shoot a flat worth of target loads on a very good day at the range.

Trying to work on speed > accuracy, but I'm all over the place.  I also tried out my latest acquisition, a High Standard Field King. It's not really mine, it's a gun that belongs to my club. But because of how the club is set up, we can't store firearms at the club house, so Range Officers get assigned a pistol that new members can use. ANYWAY. ... I think I chose poorly because a few rounds keyholed. I took it apart and it looks OK, it has bore, doesn't look pitted or otherwise damaged. But keyholing."

Wait till it shows as received/processing in their online system, then about a week or two later call, ask them about it.  For rPAL they likely will want interviews so get the reference number and have your people call in.  For me, I forgot to write my name on the second photo so they had to send it back to me, and me back to them again, so that probably added 3 weeks right there.  Other than that it's really a crap-shoot.  Could be in a month, could be a year and everywhere in between.  I've heard of people with spotless backgrounds getting it in a month, and people with questionable (but ultimately harmless or irrelevant) things having it take forever.

The tabs on the action bars that interface with the bolt carrier are different, and at least my Norinco HP9 bolt wouldn't quite fit into a real 870 receiver and vice versa. Very tight, could have probably been fixed with sand paper and a file. The trigger group did fit, as did the barrel"
canadaguns,39x1po,f-tac,1 point,Mon Jun 15 17:50:59 2015 UTC,That is an issue even between some of the new and old remingtons.  It's a 2 min fix with a dremel but as long as you use the same action bars on the same bolt you are good to go.

My advice is not to get something that you're not 100% happy with, because you'll just want to upgrade later on.  The gp100s are good too. And can be a little cheaper, but if I were you I'd hold out until a 686 shows up for the right price."

canadaguns,39upa1,Red_1977,2,Sun Jun 14 23:49:29 2015 UTC,"I don't reload yet, though I'd like to get into it after I pick up a precision bolt gun. I've got 1200 rounds of Norinco 7.62x39 for my SKS, so all that goes in one can, plus a few boxes extra that don't fit.  Generic 7.62x54r surplus has its own can, it's all from the same spam can so no worries there.  My .22 is a few different brands but the boxes all stack in the can as opposed to being loose like the others.  12GA is either buck or 7.5 shot, and the buck has clear hulls while the birdshot is red, so I don't feel bad mixing those together loose in the can.   As I get more calibers/a variety of ammo I'll have to revisit it I'm sure, but at that point I'll re-purpose my StackOn into a dedicated ammo cabinet by adding a few shelves and find somewhere else for the guns.  The .50 cans do stack pretty well, though I'd imagine getting the bottom one out with another on either side of it would be a real chore if they're all fairly full."

So I was thinking that I could just make my own puma (M92) with a ranch hand and a stock, seeing as how the ranch hand is fairly easy to come by."

canadaguns,39tct2,ikidd,1 point,Sun Jun 14 16:25:29 2015 UTC,Agreed on Western Gun Parts. They're basically the only Canadian provider of Cooey parts but they work bankers hours and are not the friendliest people in the world.

canadaguns,39s6yn,-bk,6,Sun Jun 14 06:16:45 2015 UTC,"the 870 express that you will see in the shops may still be a decent gun, but they arent as good as they used to be, the old wingmasters, etc that got a solid reputation. modern 870s have more trouble with QC and poor finish, something to keep in mind.  Ive been pretty happy with my winchester sxp, little pricier than the rem and moss, but a way smoother pump, better fit and finish. less rattle as well.  I would recommend a two barrel combo, typically something like an 18 inch non choked barrel and a 28inch swappable chokes barrel than you can switch between and cover all shotgun bases with.   The mossberg and mavericks are good for this. Mavericks are also pretty solid guns too, and at a great price. My wife's 20 ga is very nice, and very affordable.  Dont be afraid to ask to hold all the guns you are looking at. Shotgun buying is more about fit, than discussing stats and specs. if it swings nicely, and it brings up naturally to your cheek and you can point it well, then buy it.  as for .22, semi auto, bolt or lever? any thing else you like, style, etc?"
canadaguns,39s6yn,diablo_man,3,Sun Jun 14 06:24:26 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply!  I've come across many people warning against getting a modern 870 due to the QC issues in my research, which is why I started leaning towards the Mossberg. I'll definitely look into the Winchester SXP! At a glance, it does seem to be priced higher than  a Remington or Mossberg but sometimes paying more = better quality.  Interchangeable barrels is definitely something I'm looking for. Any suggestion as to what length I should start out with if I end up going for a non-combo to start?  Is it true that going for a 20ga is something you'll regret? I've seen people say starting off with a 12ga is much more practical as you won't become bored of it as you will with the 20ga.  Agreed -- As a newbie, I frankly don't care about specs. I want something that feels right.  For a .22, semi auto is what I'm looking at. Something that's proven and looks sleek."
canadaguns,39s6yn,diablo_man,4,Sun Jun 14 06:34:01 2015 UTC,"Well, biggest reason to go 20 ga is over recoil. If you can handle 12ga recoil( i like it) it is the better option in most cases.  It is the cheapest(oddly, despite being bigger than 20 ga or 410) because it is so common, and all sorts of loads are available for it. Much much more limited even in 20 ga, and what is available is likely not gonna be at local stores, even if they carry specialized 12ga stuff.  Plus, bigger bang!  If you want a single barrel, i would go with a longer one, 26-28 inches, with interchangeable chokes. This allows for clays shooting, duck hunting, etc etc.  the 18 inch(or shorter, 870s especially have 12.5 and 14 inch ones that fit on standard models) are more for fun times, wilderness defense etc. Less widely useful, but fun and loud.  Looks sleek? wood stock, pistol grip, traditional shape, etc?  My suggestion is just to get a Ruger 10-22 carbine, simple short and handy, and by far the most aftermarket for 22's. Other options are more accurate out of the box though."
canadaguns,39s6yn,diablo_man,3,Sun Jun 14 06:45:03 2015 UTC,"I think I'd rather get used to a 12ga out of the gate than get a 20ga and regret it. And, like you say, bigger bang!  I'm torn -- you say longer barrel for clay shooting/shorter barrel for fun times... Both are appealing to me, haha.  Sleek is my preference, hands down. No desire to go with a pistol grip.  Most are recommending the Ruger 10/22. Mind shooting me a link if you've got any idea as to where I should be looking store-wise/price-wise?  Thanks again!"
canadaguns,39s6yn,Humon,3,Sun Jun 14 06:50:28 2015 UTC,"hmmm, wouldnt know of any good deals, my 10-22 is from the 60s, not recent. ive seen them for sale in local stores around 250?"
canadaguns,39s6yn,blobenspiel,3,Sun Jun 14 06:58:31 2015 UTC,I'll have to keep my eyes open and do some more digging.  A quick search reveals Two at ReliableGun and this one at Cabelas.
canadaguns,39s6yn,blobenspiel,6,Sun Jun 14 07:03:30 2015 UTC,"I bought a 10/22 not too long ago...unless on sale, the price is north of $300.00  In this case, this SS at Cabelas is a fair deal."

canadaguns,39s6yn,Nonrandomhero,3,Mon Jun 15 04:38:15 2015 UTC,"I'm not a pro, but I'll put in my opinion anyways.  The biggest problem with getting a reliable 22LR rifle is that 22LR isn't the most reliable round out there, if you want a really reliable gun get a centerfire rifle.  If you really need a reliable .22LR, go for a bolt action rifle like the Savage MK II BV, but if you are willing on having a few magazine and feeding issues, get a Ruger 10/22, it's worth the issues cause of all the extra fun!  Also, shotguns seem pretty reliable, just don't get anything tactical!"
canadaguns,39s6yn,cdnmr,3,Sun Jun 14 06:28:45 2015 UTC,"I have owned a Ruger 10/22 for 30 years.  I can not recall it ever failing to feed.  As far as I am concerned, it is the only .22 semi out there"

canadaguns,39s6yn,Desmau5,2,Sun Jun 14 16:25:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah.....any make/model can certainly be a lemon.  But man, I know a lot of people with 10/22s, and they all love them.  I admit I am not familiar with the Browning Buckmark rifle, but I do like Brownings.....a P 35 High Power pistol was my first love.  :)  But a Buckmark rifle costs twice what a 10/22 would....."

canadaguns,39s6yn,SoldeviOfTW,2,Sun Jun 14 22:01:20 2015 UTC,"Probably lots of guys here with more valid opinions than mine on makes/models.    I picked up an old, used Cooey Model 60 that was cheap and accurate as hell with iron sights.  Shoots 22, shorts and 22lr and you can usually find them for $120-ish.  My buddy just picked up a Savage MkII with Accutrigger (other posters here have mentioned the MkII) and he loves it (paid $230-synthetic stock), good lower priced gun.  I have a Savage 93 BTVSS (17HMR) with an Accutrigger and love the trigger.  I have a new CZ455 22lr arriving Monday.  Chose the CZ after reading several positive reviews/comments here and on CGN.  Canadian Edition was $495 (plus rings and scope).  Obviously I haven't shot it yet but have read tons of positive reviews.  CZ also sells 22WMR/17HMR barrel kits that can be swapped out with the 22lr and vice-versa.  Chances are there are a few guys here who own or have shot all of these and more who could provide informed opinions."

canadaguns,39scqj,DogfoodEnforcer,3,Mon Jun 15 03:11:33 2015 UTC,"Well since you mentioned you're alright with a centrefire, ya can't go wrong with a surplus SKS. Massive supply of em, cheap, and very easy to take apart. They go around $200-$300, and the surplus ammo is extremely cheap (400 rounds for $150, the Chinese stuff.) The surplus though is typically full metal jacket steel core, so you can't take it to an indoor range, but outdoor ranges should be fine.  Just a heads up, surplus SKS often come caked in cosmoline (a rust preventative) that you'll have to clean off. Removing the rifle from the stock and using Krud Kutter works wonders. Then rub down in gun oil to protect it.  Also, because the surplus ammo is corrosive, you'll have to clean the rifling thoroughly after each shooting session, though you can buy the more expensive non-corrosive stuff.  Hope this helps."
canadaguns,39scqj,AdiposeFin,1 point,Mon Jun 15 04:08:07 2015 UTC,"I'm honestly surprised that you're the first person to suggest and SKS.    But you're right on all counts, and I have considered one.  I just wanted to see what suggestions people have."

Shawn and Riflechair appear fairly knowledgeable and seem to have a good grasp on what needs to happen. I don't know much about the situation, even having watched these videos, but I think I'd feel comfortable buying a membership if they were able to get all of this stuff ironed out. An organization of this size is nothing to scoff at, and I feel like it would be easier to try and clean things up & move forward than to collectively say ""fuck it"" and make a new organization."

canadaguns,39o7kn,AdiposeFin,6,Sat Jun 13 05:46:34 2015 UTC,"I'm new to this, what is the track record of NFA? Are there alternative organizations and what did they accomplish?"
canadaguns,39o7kn,calix,3,Sat Jun 13 06:17:56 2015 UTC,cssa i an alternative but they aren't without their faults. A big one being that they are not active enough in politics and in the public eye.  To give you an idea the NFA are the PETA of gun lobby groups in canada.
canadaguns,39o7kn,Jarlath_Drake,3,Sun Jun 14 01:51:37 2015 UTC,"CSSA isn't active enough in politics? Or doesn't scream and yell at politicos? CSSA may not be belligerent enough for some people, but don't assume they aren't active because they don't adopt a confrontational, in your face, doctrine of operation.    In the public eye, unfortunately neither NFA or CSSA have much traction. (NFA implosion doesn't even warrant a blog entry by anti's)"
canadaguns,39o7kn,calix,1 point,Sun Jun 14 12:30:14 2015 UTC,well i keep seeing the nfa show up in the news around me but rarely do i see the cssa. I would like it if they had a more active presence in the media. I know the cssa does stuff politically behind the scenes but imo it is not enough. They should make more of an effort in regards to legal challenges. one thing that the NFA does well that the cssa does not is mobilize voters. The NRA for example is the most powerful lobby group in the usa because of its ability to mobilize voters.   perhaps we need both the cssa and the nfa. one to talk to the public without sounding crazy and one to mobilize voters (though i think the NFA's extremism alienates a lot of fudds and the more causal gun owners which is something that needs to be changed). i have been drinking so i will correct spelling errors grammar and remove craziness/stupidity tomorrow if i remember
canadaguns,39o7kn,Jarlath_Drake,2,Wed Jun 17 03:15:40 2015 UTC,"CSSA - Incremental approach and tries to educate and work with politicos. Over 23K full members.    NFA - Adopted a ""No Compromise"" campaign recently, demanded significant changes, 14K-17K full members, some 58K who are associated thru insurance only.    CFI - Does ZERO politically, but has a few thousand members.    There are some newer fledgling orgs developing from the schism occurring in the NFA."
canadaguns,39o7kn,nikobruchev,1 point,Sun Jun 14 12:36:53 2015 UTC,"The thing is, those numbers are still pathetic, in my opinion.  I'm part of a provincial non-firearms organization. It has 17K members and we're not even at 20% saturation of potential members. There are similar provincial organizations that have similar or higher numbers in almost all provinces except the Atlantic provinces. Then the national organization has its own members separate from the provincial organizations. If you assume the provincial organizations all represent 17K members, and then take on even 10K separate members for the national organization, that makes approximately 180K members represented by the national organization.  Even barring the fact that firearms owners make up a small fraction of our population, we're at an estimated 2 million strong. How are our national organizations barely past 100K members collectively? I really believe that we should focus on getting a more united and representative set of organizations out there."
canadaguns,39o7kn,AdiposeFin,1 point,Mon Jun 15 03:09:28 2015 UTC,"The NFA is a self important Non-government Organization that runs on donations from it's 'members.'    It has not posted any financial report in several years, so nobody really knows where the money is going.  But like all NGO's, most of it is going to pay for the NFA to exist and solicit more donations.    They sell people on the idea that they're the voice of firearms owners and that they have all kinds of political clout, when really they haven't had anything more than a back bencher read out a  petition in parliament.  Their goof ball lawyer Solomon Friedman got to the Supreme Court of Canada trying to argue that a pellet gun was not a weapon, the Chief Justice laughed at him and his arguments.    Then there was the scum bag move last summer when they tried to exploit the murder of three police officers in Moncton before the killed was captured or the bodied were even cold.    Much of their media and press releases are poorly worded and seem to be written either by an uneducated xenophobe or a first year community college student.    Now there is all this infighting as the group self implodes and the rats are all fighting for the last piece of cheese.    Don't give them any of your money.    If you want to be politically active in your area, /u/falcodedati wrote up a guide on how to get involved.  If you don't want to do this, the easiest thing to do is just write your MP a letter or go to their office and speak to them face to face.  You don't need to join the NFA to do either of these things."

At least I am pretty sure it is, my french isn't great and my french leaglease is even worse.   EDIT: I would just like to point out that even though tannerite is legal there are a lot of laws concerning it. Some of these laws carry life sentences. so RTFEA or go on cgn they have a good summary of the laws that apply.   EDIT2: for those demanding proof: /u/ftac /u/adaminc /u/hakb404  http://www.sq.gouv.qc.ca/services-en-ligne/explosifs/explosifs.jsp http://www2.publicationsduquebec.gouv.qc.ca/dynamicSearch/telecharge.php?type=2&file=/E_22/E22.htm http://www2.publicationsduquebec.gouv.qc.ca/dynamicSearch/telecharge.php?type=3&file=/E_22/E22R1.htm  Basically from what i understand, the portion of the law concerning the different classes of exo's was more or less copy pasted from the old federal regulations so tannerite is still on the list. (not as tannerite because that is just a brand name). This law came into effect in 2012  EDIT3: Might have been wrong about it coming into effect in 2012. I read that in an faq for companies. it seems like the law has been around in one form or another since the 80-90's.

The Tannerite website specifically says it is available in Quebec too, as does Gryphon (canadian company).  Really, the only way to know for sure would be to contact the Quebec CFO."
canadaguns,39nwcf,adaminc,2,Sat Jun 13 05:40:28 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure the CFO can only limit use on ranges (like they have done in Ontario)
canadaguns,39nwcf,f-tac,1 point,Sat Jun 13 12:49:13 2015 UTC,i was going to point out that cfo's really only have jurisdiction over firearms but in my attempt to find sources i have found out that the sq department that does firearms also regulates explosives.
canadaguns,39nwcf,calix,1 point,Sun Jun 14 00:50:54 2015 UTC,"ERD Canada regulates ammunition and explosives only, RCMP is responsible for firearms. i believe the CFO can only ban/limit Tannerites use at ranges or with use with firearms."
canadaguns,39nwcf,hakb404,1 point,Sun Jun 14 12:53:16 2015 UTC,Any proof? I've never heard of provincial explosives regs and have several related courses through work.
canadaguns,39nwcf,f-tac,1 point,Sat Jun 13 12:37:46 2015 UTC,"l as per the explosive act of Canada, I am able to hold explosives within my level of training, i believe this one is covered under my pyrotechnics card and i would be allowed to posses it anywhere in Canada. Im even positive it gives certain authority over firefighters and non-explosive trained police in a work scenario, again could be wrong , got my card 4 years ago, with my display grade fireworks card. edit i can even store them and have them at home, drive with them( i have a transportation of dangerous goods certificate or card thing ),as long as i follow all steps and procedures, for example certain types of things cannot be transported in the same vehicle, some can only be driven with 1 person in the car. I recommend taking it if you can."
canadaguns,39nwcf,hakb404,1 point,Sat Jun 13 14:34:20 2015 UTC,"well this law only came into effect in 2012 so you probably wouldn't have learned about it. Also could you give some more info on this card? What it allows you to do and where i might get one, or even just a link that would let me do my own research."
canadaguns,39nwcf,calix,1 point,Sun Jun 14 01:08:51 2015 UTC,"I have a pyrotechnics license issued by ERD Canada, there are limits as to what I can do and use it for but it is a federal card and is transferable in some states even. I also have a display fireworks card which is different but issued by the same people. Now I know Tannerite  has a use in pyrotechnics.

canadaguns,39ldmo,BeaverNutz,1 point,Fri Jun 12 16:35:29 2015 UTC,Hoplite tactical had some in but they're sold out now. They should start showing up everywhere else pretty quick I imagine.
canadaguns,39ldmo,AltC,2,Fri Jun 12 16:38:41 2015 UTC,Niiiiiice. What's their price point here? I assume they are riveted?
canadaguns,39ldmo,BeaverNutz,1 point,Fri Jun 12 16:40:27 2015 UTC,I think they were $22 a piece.
canadaguns,39ldmo,Vissry,4,Fri Jun 12 16:53:07 2015 UTC,I kinda sorta impulse bought a 45-70 after shooting my buddy's the other weekend:D

canadaguns,39ldmo,airchinapilot,1 point,Fri Jun 12 15:33:06 2015 UTC,The funny thing is that I only got the rash on my arms and I sprayed my legs too. Ditto with the sunscreen. So dunno.
canadaguns,39ldmo,Leovinus_Jones,1 point,Fri Jun 12 15:35:47 2015 UTC,Any chance it's a reaction to powder/primer debris? New to you load or type of ammo?
canadaguns,39ldmo,airchinapilot,1 point,Sat Jun 13 00:41:54 2015 UTC,No. Still shooting my bought ammo right now. Same stuff for at least a year.
canadaguns,39ldmo,alkali_feldspar,1 point,Sat Jun 13 01:54:09 2015 UTC,Lots of people are allergic to bug spray. I personally just hate the stuff and don't wear it as much as possible. Get one of these: http://www.thermacell.com/mosquito-repellent/appliances/mosquito-repellent-appliance-in-olive
canadaguns,39ldmo,BeaverNutz,2,Fri Jun 12 15:30:59 2015 UTC,You could look at permethrin too if the deet doesn't agree with you. You spray permethrin on your clothes ahead of time and it soaks in. I've found it works pretty well.
canadaguns,39ldmo,airchinapilot,1 point,Fri Jun 12 15:35:54 2015 UTC,"Yea it might be that. I do have a Thermacell and also the cheaper Clip on Off! one. I find the Thermacell works very well when you stay in one spot. The Clip on OFF! one I don't know if it does any good, really."
canadaguns,39ldmo,Cheese_Bits,1 point,Fri Jun 12 15:34:39 2015 UTC,How would you say these work for hiking or canoeing?
canadaguns,39ldmo,airchinapilot,1 point,Fri Jun 12 16:39:57 2015 UTC,The Thermacell it seems works slower than the Clip on OFF!. The Clip on OFF has an active fan whereas the Thermacell just burns. Just from my anecdotal experience if you are staying in one spot the Thermacell keeps them away.   I've never had any luck at all with Citronella.
canadaguns,39ldmo,NoxiousDogCloud,2,Fri Jun 12 16:54:26 2015 UTC,"those Off! clip-ons basically don't work as well as sprays   Although Off Clip-on initially reduced the number of mosquitoes near our testers, two of them still received one bite each during their first session. That's far less protection than the 7-plus hours of complete protection we've seen with many skin-applied repellents. By the third session (2 hours after the device was activated), we had stopped testing on all four subjects because of bites."

This is a feeling that security experts call “perfect security.”"

There really isn't anything wrong with it."
canadaguns,39m8le,AdiposeFin,2,Sat Jun 13 05:50:22 2015 UTC,What's the rifle?  I've got essentially the same thing except mines a Marlin X7 in .270 with a Redfield 3-9x scope on it.   Gotta love the accuracy and power of the .270 cartridge inside of 400yrds.
canadaguns,39m8le,Mr_Bignutties,2,Mon Jun 15 14:09:15 2015 UTC,Savage 11/111. The scope came with it which is half of why I bought it. I seriously love the bolt on it. So damn smooth!  My latest achievement with it is hitting 2 water jugs at 200 yards.

canadaguns,39j514,mwmwmwmwmmdw,17,Fri Jun 12 02:12:26 2015 UTC,Very well said. I've never understood how people though an ATT being a condition of a license suddenly meant that restricted/prohibited firearms were now free to roam the streets without consequence. I still remember the bullshit that the liberals posted on their Facebook page about restricteds being in shopping malls and parking lots.
canadaguns,39j514,Tech1240,5,Fri Jun 12 05:00:58 2015 UTC,You said it yourself with the Liberal example. The parties against this bill have been shameless in lying about what it does. People usually believe what supports their biases so they just ate it up.
canadaguns,39j514,Speed-Wolf,2,Fri Jun 12 18:16:51 2015 UTC,"I was actually surprised when the liberals put it up on their Facebook page. The vast majority of the comments were on our side, very few supported what they were trying to peddle."

canadaguns,39iv9d,InFlammen,6,Fri Jun 12 00:54:09 2015 UTC,Anticipation was fucking killing me but no flinching on your end.    I think I flinched a little bit on the 3rd one...
canadaguns,39iv9d,cdnmr,3,Fri Jun 12 02:02:56 2015 UTC,Thank man. I really appreciate that. =)
canadaguns,39iv9d,BoltActionBastard,4,Fri Jun 12 02:43:50 2015 UTC,"Practice pulling the hammer back with your left thumb (like you were) but without lifting the muzzle in the air. I have a long barrel S&W 44 Magnum and used to lift it the same way.   Then I got an earful from an old timer at the range about how my bullet could fly over the backstop and kill someone a mile away. And you know what? He was 100% right. Accidental discharges occur with your finger both on and off the trigger.   Practice at home with your revolver. Try to keep it absolutely still while cocking the hammer. You'll be safer at the range, and your accuracy will improve.   Have fun. There's nothing like a high calibre Smith."

canadaguns,39iv9d,384445,3,Fri Jun 12 02:45:48 2015 UTC,Haha. Nary. I like you.
canadaguns,39iv9d,hiltzinator,3,Fri Jun 12 02:47:48 2015 UTC,Watching the video I just realized I firmly exhale after every trigger pull. Meaning I must be holding my breath during every shot. I never realized that before. Is there a proper breathing control method that I should be aware of?
canadaguns,39iv9d,cargonet,4,Fri Jun 12 02:52:16 2015 UTC,"It depends who you ask. Some people say just breath normally, and try to fire during your natural pause at the bottom of your exhale. Others might suggest controlled breathing, and to fire after a deliberate exhale.  For me, it kind of depends what I'm doing. If I'm doing IPDA, I generally don't even think about it at all. When I'm doing bullseye, I try to dump most of my air before the shot. So inhale, fully exhale, shoot, inhale."
canadaguns,39iv9d,Cheese_Bits,3,Fri Jun 12 02:55:38 2015 UTC,"Thanks. I'll try that with my 22 next time I'm at the range. Although the range is closed Fri, Sat, Sun for a pistol competition. So no shooting this weekend. I might go watch some of the competition though."
canadaguns,39iv9d,Red_1977,4,Fri Jun 12 03:00:04 2015 UTC,"What kind of competition?  Only other advise I've got is watch your muzzle direction.

Sure, the beer is cheap as hell compared to Ontario and you can land yourself a ticket by making a right at a red (ridiculous law btw), but to the uninitiated it's just a province with a different language. But when I actually started giving it an objective view & started to seriously compare my Ontarian values with Quebec culture I started to seriously disdain Quebec.  It's bad. Really. Quebec is almost like a parody of how American media tends to frame socialism: overbearing, nanny-like and seemingly deliberately derisive toward the idea of personal freedoms. I honestly think that a good portion of Quebec's culture is the byproduct of a constant attempt at being the exact opposite of how they view the average American; a Parisian delusion, constructed around thinly veiled contempt for the English language."

Ok, I'm going to start from the top.   ""Better access to firearms ensures better security""  I guess she's referencing the need for firearms in isolated communities? Let's be fair, most of us don't need a fire arm for securities, most of us don't live in isolated communities. I shoot for sport. It's a hobby. Is there dangers? Yes. But a lot of hobbies have dangers. Even canoeing is dangerous if you don't wear a life vest. If I tripped and broke my ankle while portaging in the middle of Algonquin park, I may very well die. I often went days without seeing people, and you don't get cell reception. That's one example, I could give you many Canadian hobbies that are dangerous. Ice fishing, snowmobiling, atv, motorcycle. In the summer twice a week I hear on the news a motorcyclist has died.. And that's just coverage from my surrounding cities. Lots of hobbies are potentially dangerous, such is life.   Limit the term hunting firearms for firearms that are actually used for hunting. So could we get the ar15 classified as this? Currently we can't use it for hunting. But Americans seem to think it's a great hunting rifle for varmint, coyote, and hogs. Almost all firearms can be used for hunting if you are so inclined to do so. And why is hunting an acceptable hobby, but target shooting is not? I'm sure most Canadians who hunt, do not need to do so to survive. I know a lot must, but I'm speaking of the majority here.   Restricted firearms ARE currently only useable ""at or in"" a licensed shooting range.   Limit the transport of (let's just say restricted, because every time I read circumscribed, I read it as circumcised) To transporters. It already is? Or are the looking to take canada post out of the mix?  Commissioner of firearms?  Is that something I don't know about, or are they talking about the chief firearms officer, and they just prove they have no idea what they are taking about by not even using the right name?   Undo all the provisions of c42.  But, how can they argue with the provision that you can no longer challenge the exam, you must take a course? This seems like it's on their side."

We lived in a rough neighbourhood for awhile; the last person who lived in our apartment was a drug dealer. So random people (drug addicts) would ring our doorbell at random hours, we quickly learned to ignore banging and doorbell ringing, because our friends had our phone number and they would call first.   One day the door bell started ringing, only it didn't stop. The banging on the door took an unusual urgency. I looked out the window and there were cops everywhere; we figured it had nothing to do with us, and the safest thing to do was stay inside.   It took them quite awhile: I would say about 10 minutes to get through both steel doors at the entrance, come up the stairs, and begin pounding on our door.  It turns out that there were reports of a woman being stabbed, AND THEY HAD THE WRONG ADDRESS. So, they wasted at least 10 minutes at our address; I always wondered how much longer it took them to find the woman being stabbed, and if there was anything left besides hamburger."

With two sided tape on them  Edit: I googled it to get a rough idea of price, and the ones that came up were over 200, so the two stack ons are the cheapest option I can easily find."

You even said it in your article - the police told your gun-hating friends that they were complaining about legitimate use - no story there. And shooting livestock is a serious offence - blaming the neighbours because they have guns is slanderous.  Responsible firearms owners condemn irresponsible behaviour but gun-haters paint all of us with the same brush. How about just saying no to cars as drunk drivers kill so many? I suspect you know of far more young people killed by cars than by guns - so why do you people always focus on the guns?  Edit: Formatting.

You can't make this stuff up.  Buh, OK:   According to 2003 health statistics there were a total of 792 deaths in Canada that involved a firearm. (latest year figures were available), Among these, more than three-quarters (78%) were suicides, 17% homicides and 3% accidental discharges of a firearm. Firearm-related homicides account for less than 1 in 5 fatalities involving firearms. The remaining 2% were due to legal intervention (i.e. police shooting) or undetermined intent (Statistics Canada, 2003).   Source  So if we discount the obvious suicides and homicides there's only 5% left, and at least some of those are police shootings. But let's just go with 5%. So 39 people died in ways other than suicide or homicide. And 3% of those were children. Ok.. so about 1.17 children died (maybe) as a result of negligence.  Oh. Actually, apparently you can make this stuff up."

That seems high, and it's a little odd to use stats from 12 years ago. I digress, she says of the 740, 3% were children in accidental deaths. Now, the way that's worded, it sounds like she's says 3% of 740. But is she saying, 3% of the % that's classified as accidental? Which I was told is something like 10% (the bulk of gun deaths being suicide) I would love to see the source she is using.   I agree that gun owners need to be responsible.

canadaguns,39bz5o,AltC,8,Wed Jun 10 20:22:16 2015 UTC,I don't think it would even be classified as accidental shooting at that point. I think it would be negligent homicide. I would really love to see her source.

Lever action shotguns as well as pump action rifles are ok though. This law totally makes sense if you think about it... Just kidding, it's the most idiotic thing ever.

One of the things I like, is that a handgun or target shooting licence requires you actually attend a range and use it a mandatory amount of times r it is forfeited."

If you don't use your target shooting licence it is forfeited and someone else gets a chance to buy a range membership instead of you.  I am not sure how ownership of actual firearms is handled in that case, I knew of no-one who had a licence who let it expire by not using it. I would suspect it is like having your RPal expire in Canada, your expected to sell firearms your not legally allowed to own."

canadaguns,399zgq,JohnoTheFoolish,4,Wed Jun 10 09:12:57 2015 UTC,This seems like a mistake. I thought that the original reasoning behind the moncton locaton was that it was a central maritimes city that would put the majority of the population within a (long) but reasonable drive. A halifax location is going to pull quite a bit of buisness away from moncton. They are going to cripple one of their own stores.   I guess atleast theres a closeing sale to look forward to.
canadaguns,399zgq,anti-apostle,3,Wed Jun 10 10:28:27 2015 UTC,"I don't think it will have a huge impact. Very few people will make the drive to Moncton from Halifax on a regular basis; the round trip takes most of the day and you'd expend a lot of fuel (even in an efficient vehicle), plus the $8 for the Cobequid Pass.  It's an impractically long drive if you live in the South Shore or Digby area. The only potential for robbing Peter to pay Paul is Truro and the northern areas of NS, though I will cede that Fredericton and Halifax would have made a much better geographic pair as far as store placement goes, but Halifax is the most populous city in the Atlantic provinces so a store here makes a lot of sense.  Shooting, whether for hunting or sport seems to be on the rise in the region as well. Canadian Tire spent many years whittling away at it's firearms selection but many of the newer stores have a much expanded inventory and the older stores are remerchandising to increase or create shelf space for ammunition and firearms. Even the Walmart in Dartmouth Crossing has a display case with ammunition inside. Sure the .22 shelf is perpetually empty, but if you want lead shot in 2 3/4"", there's no where cheaper that I've found in HRM."
canadaguns,399zgq,anti-apostle,1 point,Wed Jun 10 12:40:02 2015 UTC,"Very few people make the trip on a regular basis because there is nothing for them to travel to. while I have no doubt that the Moncton location was failing to tap the majority of NS shooting population, a Halifax store will definitely chew into that part of the market from Truro to Amherst that could have their shopping trip swayed by something as big as a Cabelas/basspro  combo. I was honesty doubtfull that the store could make it past the 3 year mark to begin with, this will just make it harder.   hopefully they can keep the doors opened based on camo hoodies and browning decal sales."
canadaguns,399zgq,downvotemeufags,3,Wed Jun 10 19:24:35 2015 UTC,"They are going to cripple one of their own stores.   If opening a store 3 hours away is going to ""cripple"" the store in Moncton, then they have other problems."
canadaguns,399zgq,anti-apostle,1 point,Wed Jun 10 16:48:40 2015 UTC,"Its the Maritimes that has problems, not Cabelas. We have a fairly small population big specialty stores like this have to bank on a certain population, and really we have whole Provinces that are in the population range of big cities."

Also if i could avoid their online service to home delivery, that would be amazing. Free shipping for store pickup baybee!"

I respect your opinion, and at least while learning I won't be putting rounds beside each other in the cylinder.  My only point has ever been that I feel like I'm going to be a responsible 500 owner. I've shot, and controlled boxes and boxes of shots out of a 460. My friend who owns a 460 will be with me while I learn on my 500. I understand the dangers of a double shot, so I'll be taking precautions. I have a good chunk of spending money so I will be shooting and practicing with this gun often.   I agree with your reluctance to let people who are new at shooting big guns from obtaining 500s without understanding the dangers, or the power. But I'm telling you I can control the 460 without issue, and am not worried about what the 500 will bring. I'll be careful, and will take it slow. Since I got the gun I've been practicing dry firing it. When I go to the range I'll be staggering live rounds with empty chambers ensuring I don't flinch when I pull the trigger on an empty cylinder.  I don't know what else I could do to make me a more responsible 500 owner, yet you've done nothing but speak to me like I'm everything wrong with Canadian gun owners.  Now that I've cleared that up, I really don't care about your negative opinions. I don't give a fuck if you think I should have a 500, and I don't give a fuck if you think it's unsafe. I've educated myself, I feel confident moving forward. I can't wait for my papers to come in so I can bring this monster to the range.

canadaguns,398gke,mwmwmwmwmmdw,-5,Wed Jun 10 09:58:49 2015 UTC,"You just compared two stocked guns to handguns firing vastly different rounds.  A 1022 is designed for 22 and has a 22 recoil. 1911 22s have an odd recoil due to their need to boost the energy of the 22 with a reciprocating weighted chamber. This odd recoil makes them a poor choice to learn on to begin with. To compare that to a .500 sw hand cannon which has and will continue to kill much more experienced individuals than op who has absolutely no experience owning such a beast of a gun and no business doing so is ludicrous.  He will at best simply fuck up his ability to accurately shoot any future handguns because hell anticipate the recoil  of this one.  But hey, whats the worst that will happen when op kills himself?  Itll only shut down a range for hundreds of other people... itll only bring massive heat around the rest of our collections... it's only one life that could have been saved by not giving into stupid ego driven needs to shoot the biggest thing you can as fast as possible.  And really?  Comparing a da backpacker to a revolver that has a known bumpfire problem? Last i checked the da doesn't  have a known history of climbing its bire axis and depositingnits next round in the users soft pallet.  Remember when we had that last debate and i said you're better than your poor arguments?  I know you're better than these poor attempts and I'd really like a good well argued debate on this, but youve got to step up the game and apply the logic i know you're capable of. You can handle antigun arguments great, apply some of that skill here and prove me wrong. I doubt you can as its a known issue but id like someone to try something more than weak name calling."
canadaguns,398gke,Cheese_Bits,4,Wed Jun 10 10:17:14 2015 UTC,you keep trying to give this pep talk like you are on some moral high ground we can have diagreements that doesnt just mean one person is right and the other is wrong. i personally wouldent move from a .22 to .500 S&W but if op wants to and has shown he doesnt kill himself in the first shot that why is it our problem if it forms shitty (but not unsafe) habits.  one of the guys i watch on youtube is in france and the first gun he bought was a deagle in .44 which i thought was odd but some people want to own those large handguns because the like the badass factor of them
canadaguns,398gke,canadianrangeofficer,-5,Wed Jun 10 10:22:26 2015 UTC,"Trying to save op from killing himself  is not the moral highground then?   we can have diagreements   Absolutely,I'd just rather one where logic and actual debate was the intent jnstead of delicate feelings overriding sense and safety.  Actually a deagle in .44 would be  much more  manageable given its a semiauto and much of the recoil is used to cycle the direct impingement bolt and slide.  That and it can easily be switched to a more reasonable calier and frances restrictions made that a less insane choice.   forms shitty (but not unsafe) habits.   Personally i don't want to be at the range next to an idiot closing his eyes and squeezing blindly with a gun capable of killing those without enough respect for it, or worse someone else. Shaking arms and a lack of awerness of ones actions combined with the stout recoil will produce nothing but unsafe habits.  Idiots like op are the type who send rounds over the backstop amd get ranges shutdown. Look at the baffles at Silverdale, they are a direct repercussion to this type of shooter. THAT is why it's our problem. We don't operate in a vacuum, we opperate under a microscope and this guys just going to hurt everyones hobby."

canadaguns,396oji,airchinapilot,1 point,Tue Jun 9 23:04:18 2015 UTC,Colt Canada is owned by Colt. It may not be directly affected by a Colt bankruptcy as Colt's defence production was spun off into a separate company about a decade ago and I'm not sure which is technically the parent company.
canadaguns,396oji,JohnoTheFoolish,2,Wed Jun 10 01:23:59 2015 UTC,I wouldn't worry too much about Colt Canada anyway. They're the shpplier for our military and as such id imagine the government will keep them afloat.
canadaguns,396oji,alkali_feldspar,2,Wed Jun 10 05:27:43 2015 UTC,"The rate of replacement is probably fairly low on C7 & C8s. Every one I've handled has been manufactured before 1990. The wiki page for the M-16 claims 90% of the 8 million manufactured rifles are still in service. If our numbers are proportionally similar, there are probably about 100 000 service rifles owned by the CAF (based on the peak non-wartime size) with approximately 1000 replacements ordered per year due to wear and tear.  I suspect their civilian sales outstrip government contracts (if not Colt specifically, than AR platforms in general). Recently, an article was published featuring a 'next gen' service weapon. Even though the weapon featured was fairly impractical looking, it indicates that they are working towards replacing the C7 and C8 sometime in the ""near future"" of government procurement, so Colt Canada's future as a government supplier is not that steady either."

This is a new movement that has important implications for both lawyers and notaries. It is not just another fringe group in society. Freeman-on-the-Land is listed on the FBI’s domestic terror watchlist (www.fbi.gov/stats-services/publications/law-enforcement-bulletin/september-2011/sovereign-citizens). People who have been linked to this movement include Terry Nichols and Timothy McVeigh (of the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing).  According to the FBI: “Since 2000, lone-offender sovereign-citizen extremists have killed six law enforcement officers. In 2010, two Arkansas police officers stopped sovereign-citizen extremists Jerry Kane and his 16-year-old son Joseph during a routine traffic stop on Interstate 40. Joseph Kane jumped out of the vehicle and opened fire with an AK-47 assault rifle, killing both officers.”"

I also hope this is not used a fodder to feed the fear mill and escalate the already rampant levels of FUD coming out of Ottawa. It's all too easy to forget that violent crimes have decreased substantially over the past couple of decades and the need for more militarization of our police forces and the use of such a militarized force to serve warrants and make arrests is not the best way to foster good relations between the community and the police forces sworn to protect it.
canadaguns,394ca8,kilikamyst,2,Tue Jun 9 08:06:52 2015 UTC,"What a drag, I may not agree with some of Canada's laws but we've got it  pretty good.  Largely due to men and women like this.   Edit: in addition, worrying primarily about the effects shootings like this may have on firearms regulations when it is so recent makes our community seem obnoxious and small minded.

canadaguns,392hwa,Cheese_Bits,3,Tue Jun 9 08:10:14 2015 UTC,"Right, but the seal hunt is very location-specific, it mostly happens in norther-coastal Quebec and Labrador.  Even if the feds deregulate their use (which is basically what taking away their prohibited status would amount to) the provinces still control hunting regulations.  I would almost guarantee that the BC government would change the hunting regs to prevent you from using them.  Maybe Alberta too given the results of the last election there."

canadaguns,392hwa,thingpaint,3,Tue Jun 9 00:14:48 2015 UTC,"From my perspective in Western Canada, the governments here would probably not be happy with silencers being legalized.  Provinces control hunting regs, so I see BC and Alberta banning silencers right from the get-go.  SK probably wouldn't touch the issue right away, but might sneak in some legislation later.  I don't know enough about politics east of that to make an informed guess, but something tells me that Quebec would not be happy with it either."
canadaguns,392hwa,CrazyLeprechaun,3,Tue Jun 9 00:20:17 2015 UTC,But why ban silencers for hunting? What's the justification?
canadaguns,392hwa,thingpaint,3,Tue Jun 9 00:37:09 2015 UTC,"Something something unfair for the animals?  I don't know, I am sure they will come up with something.  Why do semi-auto hunting shotguns need to be plugged at 3 rounds?"
canadaguns,392hwa,CrazyLeprechaun,6,Tue Jun 9 00:44:45 2015 UTC,"I don't get why people assume they'll automatically ban silencers for hunting. They don't ban subsonic rounds, which are quieter then suppressed super sonic rounds, or bows. You can still hear the shot from a suppressor, it just doesn't deafen you.    Why do semi-auto hunting shotguns need to be plugged at 3 rounds?   To stop people wounding game with irresponsible shots that have a very low chance of hitting. It actually has very little to do with ""being fair."" If you don't hit the animal with your first 3 the odds are exponentially in favour of you wounding the animal over killing it."
canadaguns,392hwa,thingpaint,3,Tue Jun 9 00:49:22 2015 UTC,"I didn't know that.  That being said, I still suspect that many of our provincial governments would ban them out of ignorance just because they wanted to stick it to the federal government.  Government policy never has to make sense, it just has to get enough politicians to support it."
canadaguns,392hwa,CrazyLeprechaun,1 point,Tue Jun 9 01:02:09 2015 UTC,"Supressors are already banned for hunting in NB, despite them being prohibited anyway. A kind of proactive measure perhaps?

canadaguns,392hwa,thingpaint,1 point,Tue Jun 9 00:50:39 2015 UTC,"I was just giving an example - I remember someone posting the same response a while back about what possible opposition would there be to silencers and it could be one of the reasons some administrations would oppose them. It's a bit more valid than ""hurr durr wannabe hitman"" so some administrations might prefer a potentially more reasonable reason for opposition"
canadaguns,392hwa,nikobruchev,-1,Tue Jun 9 00:53:11 2015 UTC,Best. Strawman. Argument. Ever.
canadaguns,392hwa,Jobbo_Fett,2,Tue Jun 9 01:01:30 2015 UTC,"It was not intended as a straw man. I was simply hypothesizing that instead of an administration potentially being ignorant and opposing silencers/suppressors because ""hurr durr wannabe hitman"" - utilizing a common misconception propagated by media - they might err closer to something they think sounds more reasonable, such as a concern for poaching. Regardless of poaching being a valid argument for or against the usage of silencers/suppressors, it is an argument that may have been, or will be, used by an administration to oppose the usage of silencers/suppressors.

Supressors could keep the noise down and be more ""neighbourly""  I went to the Bisley shooting center in the UK and there is actually a store that sells them for that reason.   It is viewed as smart and polite and safe to make your rifle less damaging to your hearing.  I know here in North America we constantly associate supressors as a assassination tool.

canadaguns,392h2m,alkali_feldspar,2,Tue Jun 9 08:01:35 2015 UTC,"I said I wouldn't reply anymore but let me point out a few things out because you're maintaining the guise of being concerned for OP's safety.   We can all agree that it's negligent to hand a gun like this one to someone who is inexperienced with heavy recoiling handguns, and there have been accidents from not respecting that.   The notable fatal incident that occurred with this firearm was by an inexperience young lady had this gun put into her hands by some asshole.   However according to OP (and we might as well take him at his word) someone in his shooting group also has a fairly powerful revolver and he's comfortable enough with it that he's put a good amount of rounds through it.   He's  mentioned that he's already talked to his shooting buddy (i'm assuming the one with the .460) for advice on how to properly shoot it, and i'm sure he'll be around when OP decides to touch one off for the first time. There is a risk, just like with anything, but it's being managed, unlike the fatal incident where someone decided to pray on a beginner for laughs.  When I came into this thread the first thing I did was give him practical advice on what he can do to minimize risk, as there certainly is the possibility for harm if you stick a goddamn cannon like this one into the hands of someone who doesn't have a clue what they're doing.   Where as you strolled into here and proceeded to call everyone who disagrees with you an idiot and just in generally flamed harder than a fuck boi in a studded leather thong during pride week- all without offering a single piece of good advice on how to shoot a revolver like that properly.   I took a cursory look through some of your submissions and as I suspected they all have one thing in common, you're always right, everyone else is incompetent, and it's always straight to the potty mouth and insults.    Try and have a little more class, this isn't a huge sub and i'd like to think we have a pretty good group of guys here.  Put the thesaurus  away and chill out, you're not going to impress me by using the pretext of being concerned for our friend to belittle everyone.   Last reply you're getting out of me and you really shouldn't have been fed any at all."

That doesn't look like the hand of an ""inexperienced young lady"" its the meatey hand of a large male who works for smith and wesson demonstrating the flawed mechanics of the firearm.  Read the comments, experienced owners admitting that the firearm is poorly designed and contributes along with their own complacency  ( which OP has in spades) results in near fatal accidents.  Also cute how you jump to homophobia while attempting to claim the moral high ground. You're a real piece of work, and I'll be glad to point it out when ever i see stupidity on this sub, especially dangerous stupidity.  As for the thesaurus comment; lol! I guess I'm using too big of words?  Thats really a ""you"" problem that you can fix by reading some books.

Oh, and for rifles I've shot 22, 30.06, 223, .556, 300 win mag, and 45/70 magnum loads.  Have i shot one of these before? No. Will this be the biggest gun I've bought? Yes.

Shooting someone elses handgun does not constitute having any experience with centerfire handguns when it comes to comparing to OWNING the .500. You have done nothing but waste your money.  You will now either develope a flinch from scaring yourself with this and never shoot any other handgun correctly again, or you will simply beat yourself up once and then take a severe loss when you try to resell this.  The fact that you are enumerating the tiny handfull of firearms you've shot on a boys weekend to the range in order to attempt to defend your foolishness is cute, but ultimately proves my point.   No. I'm not an idiot.   Really? Because that's what the salesman took you for."

You have nothing but an overzealous desire to defend the collective idiocy of op and the other groups defending his poor and dangerous choices.  That you don't even understand the negative repercussions to ones shooting form that such an abusive round will undoubtedly cause shows how little you actually know about firearms and how little experience you have, if any. You can  continue to act like a fool, those here that actually matter have made our opinions known and if you'd been here long enough to recognize any names you'd understand that.  You're a nobody and your opinion is worth exactly nothing as it has no basis in anything more than your own ignorance.

canadaguns,392h2m,384445,2,Wed Jun 10 06:16:04 2015 UTC,"How does regularly shooting someone else's gun not count as experience?  When I go to the range I go in a small group, and we all bring our guns. We each buy the ammo we plan to shoot, so I regularly buy boxes, and boxes of ammo for other people's guns, and they do the same for my guns.   How does that not count as experience?  It's not like I've never shot anything similar. I've put dozens of boxes down a S&W 460 before. And probably at least 100 slugs through the pistol grip shotgun. I'm not claiming to be an expert. But I didn't go from shooting a 22 directly to buying a 500 with nothing in between.  I've shot a 460, and feel confident trying a 500. I'm not saying my first shot will be perfect, but that is what practice is for.   I don't understand your problem. I'm happy, and confident. I have plenty of experience with similar handguns. I don't know you, won't be shooting anywhere near you, you are completely removed from the situation. Let others be happy with their decisions, instead of crapping on someone's excitement, and eagerness to share."
canadaguns,392h2m,Cheese_Bits,-7,Tue Jun 9 02:50:21 2015 UTC,"How does regularly shooting someone else's gun not count as experience?   Because by nature of it bejng someone else's you cant have possibly put enough ronds through it to actually know what youre doing. Ill bet 20 bucks you shoot with your eyes closed now, your only going to get worse by abusing yourself with the .500.   But I didn't go from shooting a 22 directly to buying a 500 with nothing in between.   That's exactly what you did...   How does that not count as experience?   Does renting a full auto in vegas count as experience? Or is it just a fun time? Because you seem to be operating under the impression that a one time experience suddenly qualifies you to move up to the big toys without any workup. The utter definition of a newbie looking to hurt themselves.    I'm happy, and confident.    So is the dog chewing the electrical cord, doesn't mean hes not about to hurt himself...   you are completely removed from the situation.   No actually, we all pay when you kill yourself at a range out of sheer stupidity and ego.   Let others be happy with their decisions   You're happy now, you won't be once you fire it and hurt yourself.   Let others be happy with their decisions, instead of crapping on someone's excitement, and eagerness to share.   Ok,  be happy in absolutely ruining any chance you ever have of shooting handguns well. I hope you don't kill yourself, but I would really love you to share the pictures of you all fucked up after you take the handgun to the bridge of your nose.  Remember it moves up and to the left.

Would need a parent Lee-Enfield, not sure if the bolt or barrel could be salvaged out of that. Could go with a different caliber that is more compatible with an Enfield bolt and barrel, something in the .30 cal range. I'm not set on .45, if 9mm was easier I'd be ok with that too.  I wonder."

canadaguns,390ylg,autowikibot,3,Tue Jun 9 21:19:19 2015 UTC,I spent all Saturday setting up for an IPSC match at Poco and then I fucked it all up by zeroing a stage on match day. It was so hot both days my head was just zonked. Plus they squadded me with two of the best shooters and I tried to keep up and shredded my accuracy. Dumb.
canadaguns,390ylg,ClutterRuck,1 point,Mon Jun 8 14:36:36 2015 UTC,How did you zero a stage?  Was it a DQ?
canadaguns,390ylg,airchinapilot,2,Mon Jun 8 15:20:02 2015 UTC,I hit 3/4 no shoots and also got one mike (a miss) which means I got no points on one stage out of seven. It was for a decent pile of the total match points too so that basically put me down in the bottom third of competitors in my division. I would have had to shoot an amazing remaining stages to resurrect that and I'm not there yet.
canadaguns,390ylg,The_Crover,1 point,Mon Jun 8 15:35:20 2015 UTC,Dang - that really sucks.   Good learning experience though - especially being paired with two excellent shooters.
canadaguns,390ylg,airchinapilot,2,Mon Jun 8 15:40:58 2015 UTC,I'm just holding together my accuracy when I combine it with speed. I can move decently fast and can come up with a good strategy and I can hit the target but put it altogether the accuracy drops. I suppose that is the point of the game. Watching the better shooters you realize what never falls down for them is accuracy even when they mess up either strategy or movement. So when I practice again I'm going for accuracy.
canadaguns,390ylg,The_Crover,1 point,Mon Jun 8 15:48:33 2015 UTC,Repetition builds speed and accuracy also.  But watching how experienced shooters work under pressure and match settings can definitely help elevate your game.

I tried the whole line of Glock Pistols available in Canada minus the Glock 21 and different types of firearms including a Desert Eagle in .50 AE and a Norinco Type 84s. Before going there I wasn't a fan of Glock pistols until I shot a Glock 19. Once I figured out where to hold it was accurate and light on the hands.

I was watching a show and I heard shouting three floors down. I got out on my balcony and saw Vancouver police stacked up on someone who was just out of view yelling at him to ""get down on the ground!"".   This is basically a block away from their main station so whatever this guy did, he definitely chose the wrong place to do it.   Within a minute two ATVs and a couple other cars arrived and a plainclothes officer got out with a shotgun and joined the stack. They gave the guy one more warning and the officer shot him with a beanbag round. Evidently he was still up and about so they gave him another chance before shooting him a second time. Then they all rushed him.   Since the guy was out of view all I could see was the 'stack' of officers and I never got to see the effect of the beanbag on him. It wasn't a loud shot so I assume the beanbag round is underpowered."

I'd bet my money on seeing it come from South Korea or Japan because they're pretty technologically advanced and they need something to beef up their small, in comparison to some of their neighbors, military.

The upper of the AR isn't considered a firearm, and as such is unregulated. There are no legal requirements regarding purchase, transport, or storage. Importing it should be simply a matter of declaring value and paying any applicable taxes (but that wouldn't happen if you're moving).  However, you'll need to get export paperwork from the US before exporting any ITAR components. Failure to do so can land you in serious hot water with the ATF and CBP."

No trigger locks needed, but still a good idea because it's really just a cabinet to keep kids out and keep you legal."
canadaguns,38yhlo,Rousis,1 point,Tue Jun 9 14:09:59 2015 UTC,"I'm out in BC. Interesting nonetheless.  I noticed the little 8 gun stack on cabinets are on sale at CT for $89 this week, so might grab one for the short term, then convert to ammo storage once I get a more formidable safe for the firearms."
canadaguns,38yhlo,Albertabound,2,Tue Jun 9 16:30:00 2015 UTC,Ah darn no sale on the 8 gun model. I want to buy one cheap and transform it into a neat little ammo storage with wooden shelves
canadaguns,38yhlo,DogfoodEnforcer,1 point,Mon Jun 8 02:04:23 2015 UTC,10 on sale is cheaper than the 8 not on sale.    I bought an 18 for ammo storage since I'm buying a Costco safe.
canadaguns,38yhlo,Rousis,2,Mon Jun 8 02:12:10 2015 UTC,I was hoping for the 8 gun to go on sale at less than 100.
canadaguns,38yhlo,jordanimal69,2,Mon Jun 8 04:16:35 2015 UTC,where did you get it? I've seen the Costco safe and want one but all the Costco's in my area are out.
canadaguns,38yhlo,-retaliation-,1 point,Tue Jun 9 00:55:04 2015 UTC,I haven't picked it up yet. It's on my list though.    You could ask them at the front desk to see what stock looks like. It might only be one store near you that's out or they could have pulled it and are waiting for a suitable replacement.
canadaguns,38yake,Cheese_Bits,1 point,Sun Jun 7 21:43:31 2015 UTC,"I couldn't find a single one when I had my takedown. And with the custom lug system for the takedown, to get a custom one made was super high priced, would have been much cheaper to chomp down the original barrel, except for the whole legal crap.  Ended up selling my takedown to get a normal one with a sweet 10"" barrel Good luck tho!"
canadaguns,38yake,bw11011,1 point,Mon Jun 8 03:01:47 2015 UTC,Is the lug system different on chargrs?

canadaguns,38yake,bw11011,1 point,Mon Jun 8 08:56:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but is it any different than the rifle takedown?   I could understand it being so for the us with its sbr laws but we would have no issue with such a swappable system and the included takedown bag suggests they intended to sell multiple foreends."

canadaguns,38vt55,elendal,2,Sun Jun 7 06:37:06 2015 UTC,"Seems almost exactly like the SATS trainer we use in the CAF. It's useful for teaching fundamentals, because you can directly see how various issues in your technique affect your shot. It's also a handy way to get some pretty realstic trigger time without hitting the range. For personal use though, seems a bit pricey, and not terribly helpful without an instructor who can point out the minute details of your technique. Although I could be wrong."
canadaguns,38vt55,Z3X0,2,Sun Jun 7 08:37:10 2015 UTC,I'd dump that money into ammo. If you're looking for cheap trigger time you can do at home buy a target air pistol like a Daisy 717. It's safe to shoot indoors (make sure you buy or make a proper back stop) and is cheap as hell to shoot.
canadaguns,38vt55,alkali_feldspar,1 point,Sun Jun 7 18:17:05 2015 UTC,"I have an older model, it worked great while I was doing competitive shooting to save money on ammo and to practice in my living room.

canadaguns,38u07b,Steve_Media,9,Sat Jun 6 20:28:19 2015 UTC,"You know what's more dangerous then terrorist acts in Canada? Vending machines falling on people. So let's back burner this bill, and start one that specifically regulates that vending machines must be securely anchored to a wall. It would have the potential to save more lives than this bill would. No act of terrorism has happened because various agencies didn't have to right access to information or tools at their disposal. All the successful acts I can think of mostly could have been stopped if various agencies had just done their job.  Well consider the Ottawa shooter a terrorist, because people were terrorized. In his case, I'm not even going to list the warnings to what might happen, because there are too many."
canadaguns,38uci4,Tomato13,5,Sat Jun 6 22:10:37 2015 UTC,"Yes  Edit: Ok I'll explain.   When you buy it from a store, you'll pay for it, and they will set that exact gun aside (they need it's serial number). They will apply for a transfer with the CFO. This could take some time, you'll hear horror stories. In my case, all 3 I own got approved within 1 business day (in Ontario). At the same time, if this is a store pick up, the store will have requested a short term ATT. (STATT)  Generally it will be good for a couple weeks, but covers only from that store to your home, one time, and that is all.   If you buy online, which I think is convenient, then the store will ship it when the transfer is complete and it will arrive at your home, and that is that. (People will argue you need a STATT to get it from the post office to your home if you miss the delivery, I won't get into that, but if you decide you do, then you'll need to call the CFO, and they will email it to you within 15 minutes of the phone conversation.   If at any point you need to move. Call the CFO a couple weeks ahead, give them your move date and new address. They will update your pal info and email you a STATT for your move date from your old home to your new home.  I did this, the CFO lady asked if I had joined a range yet, I said I was still weighing my options and wait listed for a couple, she said ok. No hard time, no further questions.   Now for the important question..  What are you looking to pick up? :D"
canadaguns,38uci4,AltC,8,Sat Jun 6 22:15:51 2015 UTC,Christ so much work. I was going to pick up a CZ shadow. :)
canadaguns,38uci4,Donny_Brook,7,Sat Jun 6 22:31:35 2015 UTC,"No work. Pay for it, wait a day or two and either answer the door and say thanks to the postie or go pick it up. I've never waited more than two days for authorization after paying."
canadaguns,38uci4,svodiwuejkxlkadfuiop,4,Sat Jun 6 22:35:44 2015 UTC,It's actually not that bad at all. The bottleneck is the transfer with the CFP (whether bought in store or online).   All restricteds I've bought have been cleared through in a matter of a couple days. Then it's either pick it up or wait until it's dropped off at my door.
canadaguns,38uci4,AltC,3,Sat Jun 6 22:36:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah. It might sound like a lot, but the retailer takes care of it all. The hardest part is paying for it. Calling the CFO is literally a 3 minute call if you even need to, which in most cases you don't. Only like when you move.  Buy online. You then have all stores in Canada to shop for the best price. And a week later (or less) it's at your door."
canadaguns,38uci4,HanzG,3,Sat Jun 6 22:50:20 2015 UTC,I'm moving in 2 weeks. I just called yesterday. Spent 12 minutes on hold and 3 minutes getting the att emailed.  Be aware if you're moving you have to wait again for a new Long Term ATT. I called now asking if they could issue me a new one. Nope. Move first then apply.
canadaguns,38uci4,AltC,3,Sat Jun 6 23:12:51 2015 UTC,"What province? And what time? I learned, no point in trying anywhere around lunch. I guess everyone calls on lunch break"
canadaguns,38uci4,HanzG,3,Sat Jun 6 23:29:15 2015 UTC,"Ontario, 12:15.  This is the first STATT I needed as my restricted's were all mailed directly to me."
canadaguns,38uci4,AltC,2,Sun Jun 7 01:26:05 2015 UTC,"12:15  You would be surprised, if you call at like 2pm, you don't get put on hold, right though."
canadaguns,38uci4,twist3d7,2,Sun Jun 7 01:52:38 2015 UTC,Not really a big deal.   I bought my first AR15 in Edmonton a few months back. Tool 5 days for my first restricted.   STATT and LTATT were issued automatically.
canadaguns,38uci4,twist3d7,1 point,Sun Jun 7 03:17:05 2015 UTC,"I got a Shadow, good choice.  Interestingly enough, I bought it in the best way, from my club.  In this way, I bought the CZ and got to shoot it minutes after.  After shooting it, I returned it to the sales counter and they stored it waiting for the firearm transfer and my ATT request to complete.  I didn't give a damn about when these pieces of paper arrived at my door, because I intended to store the pistol at the club anyway.  My membership includes the storage of 2 guns.  As such, my 2 pistols never have to leave the club and I never have to worry about transporting them or storing them.  On range day, we like to have breakfast before shooting and coffee and shopping after shooting.  We couldn't do any of this if we had to transport the firearms, so having a club that doesn't store the firearms would definitely be a deal breaker."
canadaguns,38uci4,DoublePrizes,2,Sun Jun 7 18:20:21 2015 UTC,"Sweet I pulled the trigger yesterday.   Do you need another ATT if you stay over at a friends house before you go to the range? Like my parents place is 5 min from the club and I want to crash over there the night before, shoot in the AM and then go back guys lunch.  I swear ATT are a total waste of my tax dollars. I want to meet the bone headed idiot that thought this was a good idea."
canadaguns,38uci4,AltC,1 point,Mon Jun 8 11:11:13 2015 UTC,"It sounds like you're gonna get in trouble.  An ATT is specific as to where you can go.  Usually it's home to the range and back (no detours, no stops).  Traveling to other people's homes would be a really special ATT.  All this ATT transporting crap is why I leave my pistols at the range.  I really don't have the time or patience to deal with any of it.  I usually go to the range with friends and sometimes I do the driving, so I pick everyone up.  Transporting the pistols at the same time is impossible.  Then there's breakfast before and coffees after, shopping, or other random fun places to go... All impossible to do while transporting... So I don't."
canadaguns,38uci4,DoublePrizes,2,Tue Jun 9 01:08:18 2015 UTC,"So... If I wanted to own a restricted firearm, but I don't belong to a gun club because there aren't any for miles and miles... I could still bring one home and it would be legal to possess?"
canadaguns,38uci4,AltC,2,Sun Jun 7 01:12:04 2015 UTC,Yes. You can collect fire arms and never shoot them. Around here we would call that a safe queen.
canadaguns,38uci4,DoublePrizes,1 point,Sun Jun 7 01:50:45 2015 UTC,OK so what are the regulations for firing a restricted firearm on your own property? I have a range about a mile from any road on my land.
canadaguns,38uci4,mrchenry,2,Sun Jun 7 15:05:46 2015 UTC,"You can't. Must be an approved range by your provinces CFO. Someone on her looked into their home made range being approved, he had lots of land, and heavy excavation equipment for making brumes and such , and talked about how it was pretty much impossible."
canadaguns,38uci4,SaskFirearmCourses,1 point,Sun Jun 7 20:45:50 2015 UTC,Hahah I figured it was too good to be true. Thanks for helping me man!
canadaguns,38uci4,xXWaspXx,5,Sun Jun 7 23:41:13 2015 UTC,The ATT you got to bring the gun home from the store is not the same ATT you use to take it to the range.
canadaguns,38uci4,AltC,5,Sun Jun 7 01:58:26 2015 UTC,"This will depend on what province you are in. You are always more than welcome to purchase the firearm, but if you want to legally transport it (take it home) you will need an ATT.  In Saskatchewan the CFO will not approve any ATT without proof of gunclub membership even to take it home. I've heard special circumstances, but this is the norm here."
canadaguns,38uci4,SaskFirearmCourses,3,Sat Jun 6 23:23:01 2015 UTC,"Will those random CFO rules matter once C-42 goes through? I live in Ontario so this is not an issue for me (surprisingly) and I was able to buy my m&p before getting a range membership, but it would be nice to get rid of those ridiculous rules."
canadaguns,38uci4,BoltActionBastard,1 point,Sun Jun 7 00:41:20 2015 UTC,"Yes it will do exactly this. An ATT to all the legal places will be built into the license. You already jump though a lot of hoops to get the rpal, so it makes sense that you shouldn't have to go though the monotony of making yet another phone call.   Though I'm not sure how this works for moving :S  Probably still have to make a call for that? You need to change your address anyway, but you can do that online."
canadaguns,38uci4,SaskFirearmCourses,1 point,Sun Jun 7 01:56:51 2015 UTC,"I am uncertain. They have not made an amendment to needing a valid range membership. I have no idea how or when they will verify this one the paper ATT is gone. I would say at renewal time, but they are possibly changing those also."
canadaguns,38uci4,AltC,2,Sun Jun 7 03:03:35 2015 UTC,Ever notice that little swipe strip on the back of your card? RCMP will scan it and see if you have a reason to be taking your gun around
canadaguns,38uci4,Donny_Brook,1 point,Sun Jun 7 03:49:44 2015 UTC,That doesn't seem reasonable. The strip has the same info as the card and the RCMP doesn't have the infrastructure to scan it. There would be no point.
canadaguns,38uci4,bbqwoa,3,Sun Jun 7 06:56:42 2015 UTC,I don't know that I have ever even seen an RCMP officer besides on TV. So I'm not thinking I have to worry about an RCMP officer swiping my pal
canadaguns,38uci4,AltC,2,Sun Jun 7 13:46:19 2015 UTC,"You can not transport a restricted gun without an authorization to transport, that said, the store you make the purchase from should get you the STATT so you can take it home. If you make the purchase online they'll do everything necessary and one day the bell rings and you've got a gun.   The range you join will get you the long term att for travel to and from the club."

canadaguns,38ugzh,cecilkorik,3,Sat Jun 6 22:59:13 2015 UTC,"It's random. Sometimes it ships immediately. Sometimes, it languishes months, or forever. There is no logical deductions that can be made, no outward indication which one the Cabela's ""Wheel of Misfortune"" is going to choose for you. You just have to buy, wait, hope, and see.  Most stuff I've bought has shipped immediately, or within a few days at most. Some of it though... not so much. Calling their support line may help to move your order along, and they are very pleasant and they want to be helpful, but don't expect them to be able to provide any helpful information. They don't work at the black hole that is Cabela's warehouse. When they see that your order is still waiting for ""processing"" at the warehouse, they will not have any explanation either, and will be just as confused as you are."
canadaguns,38ugzh,cecilkorik,1 point,Sun Jun 7 00:39:56 2015 UTC,It's amazing that any store nowadays takes as long as they do to ship. I mean... I'm literally putting an order in at Amazon right now for delivery tomorrow (which is Sunday). SUNDAY.    Everyone should be forced to send their stock to Amazon for fulfillment. I can guarantee that if I order by X that it'll be in my hands by Y.
canadaguns,38ugzh,humanefly,6,Sun Jun 7 01:03:03 2015 UTC,Actually I think it's the reverse that's amazing. Amazon is amazing. They are like magic. It's hard to believe they are actually a real thing.
canadaguns,38ugzh,humanefly,1 point,Sun Jun 7 01:08:28 2015 UTC,"I can't argue that. I remember back in the day when Amazon Canada was a joke. Now every other retailer in Canada is a joke, especially considering the selection Amazon has. They have basically everything.  I'd love to see what's in their warehouses.    I mean... I ordered an ice machine. A freakin' ice machine. It was like 80lbs. The option for next day air was there. For $4. $4 freakin' dollars. I'm sure you can figure out the rest. It came. Next day. I'm pretty sure they paid more for shipping the damn thing than I paid them.   I do like 1.5 orders a week now. They're like the first place I look for anything. Hell they even have firearms supplies. I might order a scope from there because I can."
canadaguns,38ugzh,Seven65,3,Sun Jun 7 01:13:54 2015 UTC,"ya but amazon.com is so much better for firearms related supplies than amazon.ca. I do buy a lot of stuff on amazon now; mostly because I don't like shopping and it saves me time. saving me money is a nice bonus,"

I ask her why it shows as in stock when it is not in stock and they are not even expecting new inventory anytime soon.  Sorry, I have no idea she replied.

I ask her why it shows as in stock when it is not in stock and they are not even expecting new inventory anytime soon.     Yeah that's messed up. I could maybe see if they were miscounted so the ""one"" that was in inventory or something is showing as stock.

They received my defective rifle on April 27th and after numerous calls say they will be sending it out tomorrow. It took them OVER a god damn month to even get my replacement in the mail.

I called in a bunch of times after that to see where the last 2/3 of my order went and they said it would be here soon. Took another week to get my .45.  I also overcharged by $7-9 so I eventually got a $15 gift card for that, but they said that due to their new warehouse screwing up I wouldn't get the last box of 500 because inside the box of 1000 there are two boxes of 500 that they opened up and sent off instead.  Took another month to get a half refund for the missing 500 rounds.  Also, the box of ammo broke open and I had bullets everywhere. Luckily I didn't lose any of them but damn was hand counting 500 bullets a pain."

(I thought consecutive clays in the air but it would be too hard to keep consistent for people)  Timed pool rounds using the scrambled balls target. http://www.targetz.com/fun01.htm.

With optics you're looking at about a $2000 to $2500. The chassis or any other bedded stock is absolutely worth the money. There's also a lot of after market stuff for the 700's."
canadaguns,38tksh,alkali_feldspar,1 point,Sat Jun 6 18:57:16 2015 UTC,I'd highly recommend a remington 700 in 223 with upgraded ltr stock and trigger job.

canadaguns,38tksh,pyxis,1 point,Sat Jun 6 20:21:24 2015 UTC,"If money is an issue, go the Savage route, buy a 10/110 or 11/111 on the cheap and a chassis system then invest in glass, rings and bases. The Savage's come in a huge variety of calibers and there are so many aftermarket drop in barrels that you can buy and install yourself with a barrel vice, head spacing gauges and boom done.  If you want to go a more expensive route, go the Tikka, there are more and more aftermarket parts for them and they are gathering quite a following in the long range world now.   Caliber choice depends on a few things, how far you want to effectively shoot, how much you are willing to spend and if you reload or not.  If you want to goto 1000 yards and don't reload, .308 is fine, if you want to shoot a mile and you reload you will probably want a 6.5 creedmore or a .260 rem... So many to choose from.  I'd suggest watching Sniper 101  seen here it is an amazing tool for beginners and even for a veteran shooter has amazing information."
canadaguns,38tksh,another_unique_name,1 point,Sat Jun 6 19:52:42 2015 UTC,Sorry to kinda hijack the thread a bit but do you know much of anything about the savage ba-110? Would you consider it a good buy. Handled one at the gun store and liked it but not too sure.  Edit: spelling
canadaguns,38tksh,pyxis,1 point,Sat Jun 6 21:03:09 2015 UTC,It's on my radar but I haven't handled one yet. I will if I get an opportunity.
canadaguns,38tksh,pyxis,1 point,Sat Jun 6 21:10:56 2015 UTC,"I haven't seen one in anything but .338 lapua magnum & 300 win magnum. .338 lapua mag is extremely expensive to shoot even if you reload, I think I heard somewhere it is 6 bucks a shot to buy or 1.50 a shot to reload.  While 300 win mag is a great round it is also fairly expensive to shoot without reloading. I pay somewhere around 55-65 bucks a box when I had my 300 WM. but the round was amazing.   But, from all that I gather, the 110 BA is a great rifle but building a custom rifle will still be better.   Have you looked at the Savage [http://www.savagearms.com/firearms/model/10FCPSR](10 FCP-SR)? It has a lot of really good starting features you pay a premium for and if you aren't an experienced long range shooter it is a great platform to start from everything I've read. Comes in two barrel's w/ .308 20"" or a 24"".  Beautiful thing about Savage is that even if you buy the .308 caliber change is as easy as a new barrel and maybe a new extractor."
canadaguns,38tksh,pyxis,1 point,Sat Jun 6 22:29:15 2015 UTC,"So - I am happy to chime in on this.  I will use some copypasta from another thread asking the same questions:   Budget? Long action or short action? Single feed or repeater? (I also have this answer) Application you will be shooting (I think I have the answer here)   Once I have an idea of those things - I can steer you in the right direction!   Essentially - a decent R700 will get you MOA or less in most cases with factory, which is good enough for sniper matches.  There are a couple other things that can be done to get good value (accuracy-wise) for the money.  Bed the rifle and reload."
canadaguns,38tksh,pyxis,1 point,Sat Jun 6 20:24:41 2015 UTC,"Budget - ~$2000 seems good, I can be a bit flexible with this. Luckily I love Kraft dinner.  Long or short - I honestly don't know the difference between the two or their merits. From what I've read I gather short has more aftermarket support, but I'll have to do some more research on this.  Single feed, I'd prefer a bolt action for this kind of shooting. Semi works, but I find I start spraying and don't focus on accuracy after a bit.  Application - sniper matches, putting holes in far away things really. I'll get something else like an M85 for a bush gun. I want this one to be my range baby."
canadaguns,38tksh,echo_61,6,Sat Jun 6 20:33:10 2015 UTC,"Ok - so 2k doesn't leave a lot of wiggle room for optics, but it can be done.     Long action and short both have the same sort of aftermarket support especially with Remington.    I should have clarified single-feed.   Bolt action, no mag vs bolt action with a mag.  So - it will be tight but do-able.  Here is my suggestion:   LH Remington 700 of your choice but pick a heavy barrel (new or used)  ~$700 Bell and Carlson stock est $300 Bed the rifle with devcon or pay a gunsmith to do it Buy a good optic with the remaining 1k - Sightron, Vortex, used Leupold etc   This is something that can be a work in process as it stands and you can A) try it out and see if you really like it and B) upgrade parts as you go along (rebarrel with a match barrel, true the action,  etc).  If you can't reload yet - don't cheap out and buy shitty ammo to practice with, it won't give you a realistic view of where the issues lie with accuracy and precision...you won't know why your rifle prints 4"" groups at 100m - is it ammo, is it the shooter, is it something else.   Match ammo will eliminate that piece for training.  It's not cheap to get match ammo if you go with Federal Gold Medal Match - but if you grab something like Hornady competition ammo - it won't break the bank and can be had for around 38 bucks a box.    If you are flexible on budget - we can tweak this somewhat, by cutting back a bit on the optics to $750 or so and throw in a match grade barrel.  In that instance, all you need to do is find an action - which can be had, used for $500 bucks.    So in a nutshell there are many many routes to take.  **really?  Downvoted for advice?  What the hell."

The way things are spun through the lens of almost (if not) all Canadian news sources say that these should be prohibited rather than restricted/highly regulated.  Maybe a more reasonable and easier to explain petition should have been suggested.  One that didn't open up magazine restrictions to all class owners but simply said non restricted licence owners are allowed 10 round magazines and restricted would have access to all other limitations.  Perhaps also instead of looking to de-restrict the AR15 look at something smaller instead like .22 caliber pistols for hunting and look at the amount of registered .22s used in crime and compare that to the amount of .22s used safely and properly by legal gun owners.  Maybe I'm just crazy though and all guns should be legalized all at once, I dunno."

canadaguns,38qr0h,KneebarKing,19,Sat Jun 6 02:55:24 2015 UTC,"Since  I am assuming you are primarily referring to concealed carry, every indicator shows that people with CCW licenses are extremely law abiding, committing crimes at a small fraction of the general population, per capita.  Info from Texas, since I looked it up for a discussion on their laws some weeks ago.    According to the Texas Department of Public Safety, CHL holders are extremely law abiding people, committing crimes at far lower rates than the general population  http://www.txdps.state.tx.us/RSD/CHL/Reports/ConvictionRatesReport2013.pdf  Data for texas. It shows how many were convicted for a certain crime, in total, and how many of them were concealed carriers, and then percentage of total convictions that were CHL license holders.   As of 2013 there were 708,048 people with a CHL license. 26.059 million people in texas makes it 2.717% of total population, but given 17 million for adult population(people 21 and over, as you cannot get a CHL until you are 21), about 4.16% of the adult population has a CHL. So for the ""CHL holder percentage of total convictions"" stat on the right side of that document, any percentage lower than 4.16% indicates that CHL holders are less likely than the average person to commit that crime.   Murder shows 0.8242% for CHL holders, for a total of 4 murders in 2013.  This number was 1 murder in 2009, 4 murders in 2010, 3 in 2011, 1 in 2012.   Manslaughter it is 0.0000, there were no manslaughters committed by CHL holders in 2013. This number was 0 manslaughters in 2009, 1 in 2010, 0 in 2011 and 0 in 2012   In other words, in 2013 CHL holders committed murder at about 1/5th that of the average person. And over the last 5 years averaged even lower than that.  There has only been a single manslaughter committed by a CHL holder in those 5 years. 13 murders over 5 years by CHL holders, meanwhile Texas has about 1200 per year.    Most other crimes listed there are very under represented by concealed carriers. You can change the url date to 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, etc if you want to look at the trends over the years. 2013 is the newest. Murder/violent crime stats remain low. Overall crime rate by CHL hlders is shown at the bottom of the page to be far far lower than the average person.  Doesnt seem like there is much to worry about. Going by the numbers, you are 5 times more likely to be murdered in a room full of random texans than you would be if everyone in that room had a concealed carry license."

I would prefer to see ""Prohibited"" classification gone or make it so that anyone can get it, but falls under higher scrutiny. IE: what currently exists between a Non-Restricted and a Restricted owner.          ATT paperwork is being eliminated, last I checked, so moot point.              If concealed carry existed in Canada, and a proper training was mandated or suggested (some people hate mandated shit), I doubt it would create some apocalyptic reaction and a spike in gun violence.

I love guns and believe that people should have the ability to own firearms, but   There is no ""but"".  If people should have the ability to own firearms then the government has no right record the serial numbers or keep track of what I own.

While open carry doesnt provide the protection to the whole of society that concealed does, it still introduces a level of protection to self and others not currently available. 13 minutes reaponse time after all, and that in the densest urban sector of Canada, it only gets longer from there.  If 1 in 10 people has a concealed firearm on their person you don't want to try to victimize anyone on the premise they may be armed. Open carry doesn't provide the same blanket protection to those unable or unwilling to carry that concealed carry does.  That said, that we can not even open carry for predator defense on our own property is ridiculous and shows how ridiculous our laws are. 7mm win mag is fine on my property, yet even a 22 pistol is too dangerous for the public.    My suggestion is that in Canada, you can't possibly feel threatened enough to warrant carrying.    Nice you feel safe, considering you've already ""claimed"" to have military experience we can hardly consider your internet persona an average representative of canadian society.  What about your mom? Can she fight off a rapist with some judo and a whistle? That nice  paraplegic gentleman down the street thats been robbed 6 times this year?  Where exactly do you reside where there's no crime? I know a few people that wouldn't mind moving.   My suggestion is that in Canada, you can't possibly feel threatened enough to warrant carrying.    Funny the government thought to include it in our laws as a legal avenue of self defense then... atc permits exist already, but only to the politically connected."

And CCW or not, my mother would never touch a gun.   And again, the crime stats in Canada just don't make a good argument to carry for self protection. Anecdotes are not Stats.   Would you feel comfortable with people walking around in Home Depot with long guns at the low ready? Would you feel comfortable knowing a guy is drinking at a bar with a concealed firearm?  I've spent time in lawless societies where everyone has, and needs a gun. Not once in Canada have I ever felt the need to arm myself to go about my day, it just isn't that dangerous here.

The Islamists charged the car as it pulled up and they were shot just as they got there. The officer has just enough time to kick open their door before they had to start firing.

canadaguns,38mbq7,reddelicious77,9,Fri Jun 5 14:18:46 2015 UTC,"In theory yes. But lots of guns are prohibited just because of what they are, meaning that people see them and instantly assume that it is an evil device used only for senseless slaughter of children. People who are educated with firearms know that no gun is more dangerous than any other and that law abiding gun owners who are trained/educated wouldnt use any firearm for any wrongdoing.   There are 2 rifles off hand that are a big issue right now. The cz 858 and Swiss arms rifles are guns that were originally designed to be full auto but were permanently modified to disable auto to semi auto only. They have been re classified to prohibited because someone high on who knows what decided that they were too easy to convert to full auto. So therefore everyone will do it, right? Even though converting it would make it prohibited anyway. Basically though the Canadian firearm classification system is pretty arbitrary.   Rambling, I know."

canadaguns,38o7k1,drift1122,1 point,Fri Jun 5 17:44:32 2015 UTC,Just have to be careful. Same with any purchase of anything. I purchased a $2100 shotgun there. Wasn't an issue as I insisted on an in person meet up and inspection of the firearm first.  I sold a rifle on cgn in the past. After a lot of thought neither the buyer or myself wanted to meet at our own residences.  So we narrowed it down to a police station parking lot or a firearms store parking lot.  We ended up getting permission from a neutral firearms store to do the transaction there.  You wouldn't send a Craigslist seller or kijiji seller cash over basically untraceable email transfer and hope they send something after payment on the honour system.  No difference.

I talked with the guys on the phone a few times and the only thing I made sure of is that the phone # had the right area code for where they said they lived. I had the RCMP verify their licenses (and had to for 2 restricted transfers) and it all worked out. If you got bad vibes, walk away or simply insist on PayPal or COD. Either provides security to recover cash or your firearm. However, I've also accepted and sent EMT, cause I trusted the guy. Call me lucky, but it has worked."

I also took out my AR and put a few rounds of PMC .223 down range that I picked on on Canada Ammo's last sale.   Update: Canada Post is garbage as usual and didnt even try and deliver my package. They didnt even buzz my apartment just left a slip. I tried to stop the truck as she was pulling away then went inside to call customer support. 20 mins on hold.. and talking to 2 different people to get them to turn around.  Update 2: K31 arrived. It looks amazing. No troop tag behind the stock ( last one had one) but the metal and wood on this is really good looking. Normal wear and tear that id expect but no gouges out of the wood. Even came with the muzzle cap.

canadaguns,38on88,The_Crover,3,Fri Jun 5 16:28:17 2015 UTC,It wasnt on paper out of the box ( same as my last savage unfortunately) but she loves the Muddy Girl and was enjoying learning how to sight in a scope. She calls going to the range our stress relief/ couples therapy cause we are always relaxed on the way home lol. All in all it was awesome but I wish we could have stayed longer but had plans for this afternoon.

My GF was scared the first few times but everyone at my range is super friendly and tried to get her to shoot their guns. She loves the pink/purple .22 and wants to get a bipod like my Savage 11.

canadaguns,38oy9z,Styrak,1 point,Sat Jun 6 16:36:12 2015 UTC,Is it a sporter?    Is it unmolested?    Is it a No1 or No4 or some other model?   Is it in good condition?    Is the barrel in good condition?  Many other questions...
canadaguns,38oy9z,REM_Qc,1 point,Fri Jun 5 17:33:07 2015 UTC,"A sporterized, functional Lee-Enfield goes anywhere 150-200$. It loses value if the barrel has been cut, or if there are missing parts or obvious problems. In  many cases, they have been pierced for scope mounts, or have sights replaced with a rail. 300$ is a bit steep."
canadaguns,38oy9z,sean1256,1 point,Fri Jun 5 17:36:27 2015 UTC,That increases the value some of the decent NON sportized rifles I have seen go up to 600
canadaguns,38nr11,NoxiousDogCloud,3,Fri Jun 5 12:11:18 2015 UTC,"All this mag cap business is all just bullshit anyway. Only hurting people who are honest and want to do things legally.  People will even pay these crazy prices and wait on a pre order to be able to legally put 15 rounds in their gun. Half of what the standard magazine actually holds. And look, we can't even do that.   This especially doesn't make any sense for an ar15 mag. It's a restricted rifle. Make a standard mag cap a restricted item at least."

canadaguns,38nr11,Styrak,1 point,Fri Jun 5 15:13:36 2015 UTC,"No, it's not, but it should.  A 5 round mag should be a nr item. A 30 round should be a restricted. Put a sticker from the RCMP or something on it. Treat them as any other restricted, must only be used at a range."
canadaguns,38nr11,AltC,3,Fri Jun 5 15:42:37 2015 UTC,"No, mags shouldn't be restricted at all."

canadaguns,38nr11,f-tac,2,Fri Jun 5 12:52:05 2015 UTC,"They did not say much of anything, just that they didn't think they'd be imported."
canadaguns,38nr11,AltC,2,Fri Jun 5 13:24:22 2015 UTC,I'm still waiting on the proof the other company had that said they are rcmp approved.  They have also changed their story from they work great with 223 to they are only for 50beo
canadaguns,38nr11,yankeeskypirate,2,Fri Jun 5 12:52:55 2015 UTC,"It's a standard 15 dollar mag, that "".50 cal"" is stamped on the side, and they charge 50 dollars for. Shit, they should charge 60 and give the RCMP a 10 dollar cut. It's all a big racket anyway."
canadaguns,38nr11,thehuntinggearguy,2,Fri Jun 5 12:59:35 2015 UTC,yeah i suppose when you put it that way it's pretty dumb. But my AR15 is hungry and I need to feed it as fast as possible.
canadaguns,38nr11,ctcsupplies,1 point,Fri Jun 5 13:25:18 2015 UTC,Does your AR not play nicely with the PCV mags?

canadaguns,38nr11,ctcsupplies,-2,Fri Jun 5 16:52:52 2015 UTC,"So can anyone show us a picture of these magazines?  Specifically the feed lips and follower?  Then can we compare them to a standard USGI 5.56 magazine?  I'm curious if there is an actual physical difference between the magazines.  Or are these just 5.56 magazines that have had .50beowulf stamped on the side?  Now the usual gang of idiots would like you all to believe there is some secret backroom conspiracy to ban these magazines.  But after ATIPing the Swiss Arms report, I learned that it was just unscrupulous firearms dealers that lead to the prohibition.    So I'm going to go out on a limb and suggest that these magazines were never purpose built .50 Beowulf, but either restamped 5.56 mags OR they are modified 5.56 mags.  The importer has been given opportunity to show that they are purpose built magazines, but they cannot.  So the mags will never be imported.   Of course they will probably never admit this and throw eggs at the RCMP firearms lab, which people will find easier to believe than an unscrupulous firearms vendor was trying to pull a fast one in order to make a buck."
canadaguns,38nr11,AdiposeFin,4,Fri Jun 5 16:59:50 2015 UTC,"The Barton's ones appear to be purpose built. http://www.huntinggearguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Mag-front-700x276.png  Note the circular cutout for round clearance and factory finish applied afterwards. That's not standard on their other magazines and appears to be done from factory specific for the 50. The follower is a stock 223 item, but so is the AA version.  The ones from Bullseye appear to be modified/remanufactured (poorly) afterwards.  In terms of legality/RCMP approval, here's a quote from Northern Republic Magazine from when they tried to get approval on some newly manufactured, 50-beo specific mags in late 2013:  I'm afraid this project will not be leaving the prototype phase. The RCMP have deemed our .50 Beowulf magazine as a ""dual use"" magazine because both .50 Beowulf and .223 Remington cartridges fit in it. Our hands are a bit tied on this one because despite changing the feedlips in our design to optimize cycling .50 beowulf, .223 cartridges still fit in the mag, and will essentially always fit in the magazine due to the shape of the .50 Beowulf cartridge and the limitations on magazine shape imposed by the lower receiver of an AR15 rifle, which was designed for the .223 Remington/5.56x45mm cartridge(s).  Please note that this statement only affects Northern Republic Magazine's .50 Beowulf submission to the RCMP. I cannot comment on other designs, including OEM Alexander Arms magazines."
canadaguns,38nr11,ctcsupplies,1 point,Fri Jun 5 17:23:19 2015 UTC,huh just ordered a few C-Products mags from Bartons and have a few on pre-order still with another vendor. Thanks for all the information.
canadaguns,38nr11,AdiposeFin,0,Sat Jun 6 00:13:53 2015 UTC,"Thank-you for the excellent photos.    So what do these 'un-importable' magazines look like?  Do they have a similar notch cut, is it factory made? Or are they just modified 5.56 mags?  It seems pretty straight forward that one can't just take a 5.56 mag, cut a notch in it and electropencil .50beowulf on the side then all it legal.  It's the exact same issue as with the swiss arms fiasco.  They took 550s, modified them and said they were 540s.  Then they got caught and the cat was out of the bag.  We will never get a straight answer from these importers or manufacturers as to what these magazines really are.  They'll just whine that it's the evil RCMP firearms lab and it's back door dealings that's preventing these the import.  People eat this up, because it's beyond their own reasonable thought to think that maybe, just maybe, a firearms vendor is being a bit unscrupulous and is trying to make a fast buck.    I think we're going to see this time and time again in Canada.  Firearms vendors try to push the limits, find loopholes and circumvent the laws.  When they get caught, they want to whine and complain about it.  Forget it, they're the ones shooting themselves in the foot.  They're the ones left holding the bag."
