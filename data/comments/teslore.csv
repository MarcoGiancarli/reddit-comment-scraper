Speaking realistically, though, lore and game design happen simultaneously, feeding into each other.  There's no reasonable workflow where they sit and design all the lore, all the plot, and then craft a game that captures it without making any changes.  Likewise, there's no way they could design their game entirely and then tack on a compelling lore without ever changing how the game works.  Lore and gameplay go hand-in-hand for games like TES, such that the central themes (freedom of choice, the feeling of reality and weight to the world, exploration, mystery, the nature and variety of power) are supported by both.  I would be astonished if nobody at Bethesda ever said, ""Hey, I have this lore idea that I thought of when I realized I could make the game do this..."" and I would likewise be astonished if nobody at Bethesda ever said, ""Hey, I have this gameplay idea that I thought of when I realized we could make the lore do this..."""

teslore,3e3de4,patchgrabber,3,Tue Jul 21 17:39:35 2015 UTC,"The overarching storylines seem to be decided upon well in advance, during the game's pre-production. Smaller nuances are probably filled in during/after the game's core development.  As an example, the Oblivion Crisis was hinted at during both of Morrowind's expansions. There is a priest in Mournhold who mentions that the jaws of Oblivion will be opening soon and a time of great strife will occur, and there's a similar hint about TES:IV in the ending of Bloodmoon. Even the base game hints that Uriel Septim is probably going to die soon (though that was due to health reasons, not assassination reasons).  Still, even during development of TES:III, Bethesda knew that the next game would involve the death of the Emperor and an invasion by a Daedric Prince by way of Oblivion Gates. They might not have filled in all the details about the Amulet of Kings or Mankar Camoran, however."
teslore,3e3de4,JaxMed,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:02:24 2015 UTC,"Was the lore for the games written before the games and worked into the mechanics or was it expanded upon during game production?   The answer is: both. Some ideas may predate the making of the game. For example, it is obvious that the plot itself have to exist before you start making game so you sit down and write a design document. Some ideas come to mind when the process is already going, like omg we totally have to implement this!  In fact, there is time needed to write down quests, dialogues, books, etc. A.k.a. game development. Of course, it goes as the game develops itself. During production, yes.  So, first, the idea, second, the expanding and implementation (and new ideas), third, the features cutting."
teslore,3e3de4,Scarab-Phoenix,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:41:04 2015 UTC,"From what I understand of Bethesda's game making and world building, their games usually begin based on a single idea or piece of concept art and build from there. For instance, in Skyrim Todd wanted to do a game with Dragons, and the location, lore and storyline were kind of built up around that original concept, and the concept art that was made around it.   Some of the lore books in Skyrim were mainstays from previous games, like Daggerfall and Morrowind, and they were there to flesh out the universe and make it seem more consistent. Others were new, like the Red Eagle cycle and all the Great War stuff. I'm sure their main focus was the quests and storylines in the game itself. Book-writing is a side project, but very much a hallmark of the series, so it's something they never neglect."

teslore,3e20vn,Mantled,4,Tue Jul 21 21:25:48 2015 UTC,"I would consider the possibility of the crystals being a natural mineral growth resulting as a byproduct of the mushroom growth. In other words, as the mushrooms grow into the towers, they consume certain minerals in the land. The process of expelling the waste from consuming these minerals results in the crystalline growth.  Perhaps certain towers don't have crystals because the soil doesn't contain those minerals. As well, maybe the little mushroom huts don't have the crystals because the spores used wouldn't produce them.   EDIT: Also maybe the wizards can control how these crystals grow. This could explain the crystal chamber in the Telvanni Council House, which does not seem to be coincidental."
teslore,3e20vn,BanditoWalrus,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:45:28 2015 UTC,"This is the best theory IMO. Crystal formations actually aren't all that uncommon as a by product of organic reactions, salt and other such minerals being an example.

The Ka'Po'Tun worship Dragons so they probably have minority cults but don't openly worship Daedra (except maybe Peryite but I think Tosh Raka is the star of the show). Maybe the Tsaeci worship Molag Bal because they're ""vampire snakes"". They may not actually be vampires though. The Kamal are ""snow demons"" so maybe they could be some form of Daedra. I'm not too confident that has any sort of truth to it though. I'd say the Tang Mo are Daedra free because they're supposed to be generous, good people... or monkeys. If anything they worship Azura, but I can't say for sure.  No one can say anything for sure because of how little we know about Akavir. I doubt that anything I said above is actually true."

I would assume that the akaviri have their own pantheon much like the rest of nirn and that there is some recognition of the daedra there but the rest I cannot say with any concrete proof.  Sorry I'm unable to answer your question."
teslore,3e0hlx,pike184,4,Tue Jul 21 01:21:36 2015 UTC,"I've always assumed that Akavir (at least the version we know of in the current Kalpa) is much more ""mundane"" than Tamriel, and as such, it holds much less interest to the Daedra.  Consider that just about every important ""mythic"" event happens in Tamriel. The Aedra convened at Adamantia Tower on Tamriel. Lorkhan's Heart was cast down to Tamriel. Every Tower (that we know of) is in Tamriel.  Other continents always seem to end up lost, forgotten, or unimportant. So my conjecture is that the Daedra only really like to cause mischief in Tamriel, because that's where all the interesting stuff happens.  In a future Kalpa, Akavir will take over as hosting all the important mythic events, and Tamriel will just be some long-forgotten boring mundane continent (that is eventually lost?) that the Daedra don't care about."

And the number of times the Imperial Island has been the center of some kind Daedric attack or plan to bring Mundus into oblivion says something of the presence of Towers in relation to Daedric Activity.

Towers just help mortals focus mythopoeic influence into material change on Mundus; they're probably not as crucial to the stability of Mundus as is popularly supposed.  The focus on White-Gold is because it's an extraordinarily special structure that mirrors Mundus entirely, and thereby has much more power over it than other Towers.  This goes back to the main source for Tower lore:   Though the Ayleids gave theirs a central Spire as the imago of Ada-mantia, the whole of the polydox resembled the Wheel, with eight lesser towers forming a ring around their primus. To dismiss this mythitecture as being a mockery of the Aurbis is to ignore an important point: this same ""jest"" gave White-Gold Tower a power over creatia unalike any on this plane(t). It was a triumph of sympathetic megafetish, and the Start of the [Threat! To! Empire!] that brings me to this Council.

I'm not entirely familiar with dunmeri views on Talos, but I think it was slightly positive so it probably wasn't written by a dunmer.  I guess greed is being compared to ice slowly freezing around something, but that's the best I got.  The drain strength one seems to be referring to Morrowind's slaves or maybe even the ashlanders.

It was posted here and accumulated over 200 upvotes,  here's a link for reference: http://dwarfchieftain.deviantart.com/art/Tamriel-Map-2014-443838165  Your map looks a bit like,  pardon the expression,  a knock off of mine.  Sure,  nobody prevents you from creating art,  but the fact that you also used Saderan tutorial, as I did, that you also put Talos statues on the sides,  as I did,  that you have the divines placed in the upper/lower borders,  as I did and the fact that your map in general is very similar to mine.  Almost uncannily. Did you intentionally try to replicate my map or just happened to draw and place it almost the same as I did?  I'll repeat myself again that I'm absolutely not against your work.

I will be sure to credit you since you pointed that out, but to be horribly honest I had forgotten why I put those there. If you want me to remove them I will. Originally the Divines and race symbols weren't there and it was the warrior, the mage, and the thief. Those I came up with on my own because I liked ESO's race symbols. Sorry if that looked to much like yours, but I promise I did not not copy yours in any way.  As far as Saderan Map Tutorial goes, I didn't even know you used it. That wasn't in your post.

I don't really think they were all Heroes or Shezarrines, either (since I don't think making someone Dragonborn is a botnet thing).  It's also possible that it works the other way around:  It might not be that being Shezarrine makes you a Hero so much as you have to be a Hero before you can be Shezarrine.

These 'wandering Ehlnofey' became men as we know them. It's mostly legend that states that man was created atop the throat of the world.   Being created on Tamriel in its entirety however, I believe is true. Hell maybe they were actually FIRST created there. They were created and either became Aldmer/other beings or began to wander, only to return to Tamriel by various means(Atmorans, Yokuda, etc etc).  On the seas forming from wars, I do not know. Maybe the entirety of the Ehlnofey fought, thus causing them, but my knowledge doesn't extend that far."

Everyone coming back to Tamrielr meant the end of the Era of Mer, but now men are fracturing again."

Atmorans were the wanderers (not men really yet at this time) that left to go north to become the 'giant' men we know them as.

Though, the war that tore nirn up was the ""War of Manifest Metaphor"". It happens in the Dawn Era to determine whose metaphor will form the conventions of this turning of the kalpic wheel. The two sides were the Time Dragon Ald and his soldiers who later became elves, and the Serpent Shor and his soldiers that would become humans. It ends with Shor's death, and Kyne, his war-wife, crying the first rains, forming the rivers and oceans.

If you ignore that, it becomes patently obvious that this isn't Malacath we're dealing with.   First: Nords ""worshiped"" Orkey all the way back during the Aldmeri rule of Atmora, long before Trinimac was transformed.   Second: Orkey, the word, is a pretty clear corruption of ""Arkay"", especially if you're trying to vilify your enemy-god, changing the name like this is a good way to do it.

The only pre-Septim era game that we have is ESO, and as far as I know, the currency is just called ""gold"" there, or sometimes ""drakes"". The name ""drake"" is also employed in TES III : Morrowind, so we can suppose that the Reman empire currency was the Dragon, aptly named from the dragon-in-a-diamond printed on the coins. Drake would have been a familiar name for it, and a name that sticked even when the third empire of Tiber changed its name to ""Septim"". What helped was that the septims still had the dragon symbol on one of the sides of the coin.  Another question is : why is the gold coin used as standard currency ? How comes for gold to be so common that it's common enough to buy a beer with it ? To me that's a gameplay oversimplification, but nothing in the known lore, alas and as far as I know, indicates that silver and/or copper coins are a thing."

Both of these obs were archived simultaneously by the weather observer on station at 0755 Cyrodiil time.  First issue is is the winds. Let's look at the first ob winds: 03006KT. Looks pretty normal, right? Winds out of the NE at 06 knots. No biggie. But wait! It's the morning! Tell me how winds are out of the NE in the morning? Wayrest sits right on the sea! Historically, we know that during Frostfall, Wayrest experiences morning winds out of the SW because of a seabreeze effect.  Next issue is the sky condition. FEW110 SCT110 BKN008. Few cloud cover at 11,000ft above ground level, then a scattered deck at the same height? How can you have two different cloud layers occupying the same altitude? Okay, then a broken layer at 800ft AGL? What? It makes no sense. I'd be inclined to attribute this to an encoding error, except nearly every ob is like this.  Lastly...the airtemp is 36 degrees? Are you kidding me? It would never be that hot during Frostfall, especially that early in the morning. Even if you factor max heating, there's no way it would ever reach 36.  Let's quickly analyze the second ob. First of all...it's archived for the same time as the previous ob. Impossible. Second, the weather is totally different. 5 statue miles visibility with light rain showers? That sounds a bit more accurate as for as what the weather might have been that day, but you can't have showering rain and no rain at the same time, can you? The sky con is also totally different from the previous ob, but at least the cloud layers make sense. Temp is fine. But the remark section? NUM S MOV NE? I don't even want to bother trying to figure that out.  Okay, let's take a look at their neighbors on the opposite end of the bay - Sentinel, Hammerfell.  VSEN 104518C 00000KT M1/4SM FU VV001 A2989 RMK SLP087 LTG DSNT NE  The time block makes no sense at all. 104518C. 10 Frostfall...4518 Cyrodiil time? No such thing. I can't even begin to try to figure out what the observer was trying to say.  Everything else there seems fine. The point is, the time is absolute gibberish. And I've got about 300 of them like that, just for the first couple hours of the observing period.  Now, let's set the Warp in the West aside. Imagine 1E 1200 - 1E 2208...1008 YEARS worth of obs exactly like what you see above. Contradictory weather information, impossible time blocks. How can I possibly be expect to produce accurate climo reports? What, am I just supposed to omit an entire millennium as a statistical anomaly? How can I be expected to produce an accurate forecast with this kind of stuff clogging up my climatology and happening with an annoying frequency?  It's no wonder ""strange weather"" plagued the expedition into Ionith. We can't even track our own climatology properly - WHY did the Imperial expedition think they could do it properly in Akavir?  I don't want to dig out the rest of the obs because they make my head hurt. But I think it's safe to say that, yes, every possible weather condition was at least reported to be observed.  I, however, will remain skeptical as to the accuracy of the reports."

Bretons I'm not sure about, but they are rather snobby, idk about them.  Despite a few very very very very powerful men and women looking to line their pockets, they still would be supporting an organization that is very literally trying to wipe men off the face of Nirn and go back to pre-convention. And would also have to deal with their own people hating them.     Even if the Thalmor take control for a long while and are buddy-buddy not stabby-stabby with very powerful figureheads. Redguards would hate them, Imperial's would hate them more so, and half of Skyrim would rebel all over again even if they lost the first time. It's not a combined front, but it would be multiple everywhere, until men were just either finally able to cooperate to defeat them or fail and have all Towers fall.

They were never really mortal, maybe CHIM allows one to be a god in a changing of Kalpas or in their own amaranth(speculation on only my part), but as for being mortal in what is widely accepted lore, no they were not ever mortal.

I.e. the shivering isles Golden Saints  There's a book somewhere that explains that you can never truly defeat Oblivion, everything just comes back after a while. This includes all Dremora. As for actual Princes, they can't really 'die' as they aren't really 'alive', more so changed. Like Trinimac becoming Malacath. Or Jyggalag becoming Sheo.

Trade, allies and loyalty are all secured through marriage. And not having an heir would be a massive insult to your ancestors.

That's why the current TES universe included some things from the previous universe, things like the Hist I believe: the Godhead can bring elements into their new universe that are from their own universe - at least at the moment of Amaranth-ing - because familiar things are the raw material of dreams. (Though it's up for debate whether these ""new versions"" are related in any way to the ""old versions"", or whether they're just interpretations, because dreams are usually made of familiar things behaving strangely, interpreted through the mind of the dreamer.)

You wouldn't really take that seriously, would you? And if you did, you likely wouldn't be able to achieve the goal, because you have to completely reject all logic.   But I digress. Zero-summing is a part of the process. Not a fail-safe, not a thing to overcome. It simply is. You either do, or you don't zero-sum in achieving CHIM.   I should add that I am totally not a reliable source on this. I am hoping someone will correct me if I am wrong.

And eight imperfections rubbed into precious stones, set into a crown that looked like shackles, which he understood to be the twin crowns of the two-headed king. And a river that fed into the mouth of the two-headed king, because he contained multitudes.      Vivec called to his side the Hortator and this was the first time that Nerevar had ever been to the Provisional House. He had the same vision that Vivec had so many years ago: that of the two-headed ruling king.  'Who is that?' he wondered.  Vivec said, 'The red jewel of conquest.'

With the Stormcrown gone, Hjalti could not shout ""any more"" (really, he never could, it was always the Storm that was shouting). So, to cover both his sudden inability to Shout, and his assassination of Cuhlecain (one of the necessary steps to divinity, btw, echoing ALMSIVI's murder of Nerevar, and Trinimac's murder of Lorkhan), he slit his own throat. From that day on, Tiber Septim always spoke in a whisper.  It's likely that Hjalti wasn't dragonborn, and couldn't Shout on his own, until after he ascended to godhood and gave himself those powers.  Without Hjalti, with Cuhlecain surviving, the mythic recurrence of this pattern is broken:  Hjalti // Zurin // Ysmir assassinate Ruling King Cuhlecain and become TALOS  VEHK // AYEM // SEHT assassinate Ruling King Nerevar and become ALMSIVI  Trinimac // Auri-El // ??? assassinate Ruling King Lorkhan and become ???"

The 2nd Era was a tumultuouse time full of strife and saw a great decline of many technological and magical progress. The unification of Tiber Septim stabilized things and perhaps a bit of progress was made, but it didn't last long and after the fall of the Septim Dynasty, a series of world-scale destructive events has continued to stymie progress in magical and technological progress. Perhaps Tamriel will see a Reinaisance of sorts once the elves and men solve their conflict one way or the other."
teslore,3dp3z6,Maering_Bear-Poker,19,Sat Jul 18 03:07:16 2015 UTC,"This is really the case. The Empire serves as something of a plug, stopping the 'sophistication' and knowledge from slipping away, and it seems that on the whole EVERY race of Tamriel has been in a slow technological and ideological decline for thousands of years. The Mer remain the most advanced, particularly in magical studies, but various events have diminished them as well.   The only two peoples who really moved forward at any time were the Dwemer (and we know how THAT went) and the Dunmer (which seems to have been quashed by ALMSIVI)."
teslore,3dp3z6,Lachdonin,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:14:39 2015 UTC,"Agreed.   Regarding the Dunmer, the daedra kept the Dunmer on their toes and wanted them to advance, even if they can be antagonistic about it. In essence, they embody the idea of ""The Testing,"" that people need to struggle and they turn out better for their challenges. Those challenges and struggles allow for growth and ALMSIVI ignored that. Instead, they wanted there to be no struggle, but no struggle or challenge means stagnation and decline. They didn't understand cause and effect.  With ALMSIVI, the decline is apparent when you compare several notable details: Sotha Sil has a clockwork city and notable electronic creations and creatures, yet technology of Morrowind as of the late third era is stymied. Morrowind also has numerous political and economic problems due to ALMSIVI's intervention and refusal to allow cultural change. Morrowind still relies on slave labor when numerous other places in Tamriel have had it banished. House Indoril has turned into a full-on religious extremist cult who attack anyone who is dissident or ""profanes"" their armor by wearing it. Any trade with the Empire and travel between Morrowind and other countries is heavily monitored aside from Solstheim. This insulation and refusal to allow normal cultural exchange causes numerous stagnations.  In terms of politics within Morrowind related to religion and ALMSIVI, there's essentially a Big Brother-esque situation regarding the Ministry of Truth and how any heretics are persecuted. The information regarding the fall of Nerevar leads to the persecution of dissidents, even though the dissidents are right. And I'm in agreement with the theory that ALMSIVI betrayed Nerevar, considering that Vivec, when you speak with him about what gave him the right to do his actions, says how it is not a mortal's place to dare to question a god instead of denying that he betrayed Nerevar.   Now, if you are familiar with religious apologetics, that is essentially a bluster and deflection. It's an argument of authority, that a mortal can't question a god or their morals and that they should just shut up or else be severely punished for daring to think for themselves. (Indeed, someone being a heretic essentially means 'interpreted our religion differently from the head priests/established system of belief.') This appears in numerous religious systems in real life and is a line of argument used for those who dare point out that a deity, assuming that given deity exists, is a horrible piece of shit who needs to die for doing x/y/z. Usually, in such a pointing out, it's pointing out that the deity supports slavery, genocide, torture, rape, or some other clearly grievous evil. To dare to question a god's teachings or actions is considered blasphemy and considered a grievous sin in numerous systems of belief.   Of course, Vivec is not a god, just a supercharged mortal who stole energy from Lorkham's heart, but he will try to still make himself out to be a god and use that line of apologetics. It's a bluff that you can call by killing him. (One of these days, I want to play the back path because I want to kill his ass for being a total dick throughout Morrowind's history.)  As for progress overall, the banning of levitation spells and teleport spells cause far more problems, even if someone above treats it as a magical standardization/advancement within Tamriel. It isn't, because those spells allow one to traverse long distances and across otherwise uncrossable boundaries. Those spells can be used to help spread knowledge that the spellcaster has, if they travel to new lands. Without that, then they must travel by more unreliable and/or more risky means."

teslore,3dp3z6,Rusty_Shakalford,5,Sun Jul 19 16:55:35 2015 UTC,"I'm going to make a real world analogy here. Not because these things are the same as in the real world, but because they are comparable. Here's how I see it...   The Merethic Era is equal to pre-Roman times. In the early days it would of course be similar to prehistoric Earth.  The First Era is very much like the time of Classical Greece, that being before the Reman Dynasty, and the Roman Empire, during the Reman Dynasty.  The beginning of the Second Era, during the time of the Potentate, would be comparable to the later years of the Roman Empire when it started to collapse and experienced a dark age. After the Potentate, that is the Second, Third, and Fourth Eras would be the Middle, or ""Dark"" Ages. Although there isn't really a historical equivalent to the Septim Dynasty.   So to answer the question with that bit of context, Tamriel as a whole is in a state of stagnation. This has been going on since the end of the Potentate. Things aren't getting better either, they're getting worse. Mysticism has disappeared from Magic Schools, the Mages Guild is gone, the Elder Scrolls have disappeared from the White Gold Tower, Tamriel is once again divided and warring. The Septim Dynasty didn't bring about a renaissance, but it did help to bring a mostly peaceful era. When the Septims were wiped out things became much, much worse. I think that later in the Fourth Era, perhaps starting during TES VI, Tamriel will experience a sort of Renaissance. Maybe not, but it would be interesting to see how that unfolds."

teslore,3dp3z6,Watosh66,3,Sat Jul 18 19:11:21 2015 UTC,"Well, if the transition of Imperial naming convention we see in TES:V from largely Latin-esque to more modern Italian names is anything to go on, it would seem that linguistics at least is evolving in the empire. And a shift in language (or at least etymology) might also imply a continued exploration of scholastic pursuits. That is perhaps a stretch though.  There are other signs of continuous cultural developments elsewhere as well. The most notable Nordic population in TES:IV, the townsfolk of Bruma seemed to still revere the old Nordic pantheon of gods, whereas Nords in Fourth Era Skyrim in TES:V seem almost universally dedicated to the Nine Imperial Divines. Whether this is a progressive shift or not would depend on who you ask, but it certainly shows that, in some aspects, society in the empire is certainly not stagnant and prone to change.  Science and technology are a different matter. But, while mages are able to study the mysteries of the arcane freely somewhere in the world, the pursuit of knowledge will continue and with it ""scientific"" advancement.

The Mages Guild insured that those intelligent enough would have access to magical studies. The down side of this was that non-magical advance became stagnated, while magical studies continued to progress, and magical law became more standardized (the banning of Levitation spells and warp spells are signs of this).   When Ocatato revoked the Mages Guild charter, the public access to magic and magical learning decreased. This allowed for more technological development. The water-mill is a sign of advancement, and cannons are even been used now in place of mages, when typically only the Redguards (who deeply distrust magic) used them."

Think of our society; because we do not posses magical abilities (however that may be defined) we had to resort to other ways of harnessing our environment in order to advance and improve life for the human race. I realize that not everyone in Tamriel is magically inclined, but there are many who are and those people are often seen as the ""holders"" of information/scholarly pursuits. Sick? Cast a spell. Need fire? Cast a spell. Can't put those heavy barrels into the back of your ox cart? Have your mage buddy levitate them in for you. That's pretty much the reason why.  The Dwemer are an interesting exception to this, as they seem to have developed quite a great deal by harnessing the force of magic itself and using it to power machines. Alas, they're long gone, and I'm not sure anyone else is willing to take up their mantle because there simply is not enough of a drive to."

I would suppose it's possible if that's the direction Bethesda want to go in, but I would imagine dro-m'athra to be more spiritual-based than physiological-based problems. Though that's not to say they couldn't become them.  I like the idea of the Void Nights causing stillbirths because it gives us a nice, clean, simple result; but I don't mind the alternative of them becoming weirdly shaped monster-like beings from it, it creates its own story at that point."

It seems that the most common healers rely more on alchemy than Restoration magic, and those that practice Restoration tend to be rather limited in their powers.   The more potent 'Healers' can shale flesh and do things like Magical Abortions, but the majority can't reliably treat mortal wounds, let alone fully mask scars. In this regard, it doesn't seem like there's a difference between physical injury or the product of Destruction Magic."

There are a few in-universe references to healers doing certain things, but it's mostly gameplay mechanics that we see, which areterribly unreliable.   Wel also have very limited information on actual magical effects and interactions. Lots of high-brow theory on greater mechanics, very little on low-level application.   I do think the idea of magical injuries being different, and leaving visually distinct characteristics, is an interesting one though. Maybe not the scar patterning, but it's colour?"

Until there's more information its almost impossible to distinguish candidates from one another. A presumed high age makes an elven cabal more likely, but we could just as easily have a group of men in Yokuda for the same timeline.  Then there's more fantastic possiblities. I'm sure a bunch of people would love for them to be some previous kalpa weirdness because its you know weird and lets you know how magic worked all the way back to the begining of the Merethic.

teslore,3dnxcs,abdomino,4,Sat Jul 18 02:26:43 2015 UTC,"This is definitely an interesting theory. I would have to play through the section you mentioned so that I can get an idea as to the context of pretty much every scrap before I can give a more synthesized answer. HOWEVER.  I'm not entirely sure how possible it is to create a new Daedric realm post-Convention. Even Tiber didn't make his own plane(t) when he ascended, with the Aedra remaining 8 (plane(t)s) and 1 (Tamriel--not even the whole of Nirn...--which Tiber made his).  Stemming from that, I feel like it would be easier to make yourself Aedra, a la Y'ffre, than it would be to create a new plane of Oblivion. So, I think that the Soul Cairn was already there, very possibly an offshoot of the Dreamsleeve. To use some theological analogy, the Dreamsleeve is the conglomeration of all possible afterlives (Sovngarde, the Far Shores, 'Aldmeris,' etc. etc.), and the Soul Cairn is something akin to a Limbo where forlorn souls reside.  Now, of course, if the Soul Cairn is actually a sub-portion of another Prince's realm that has been delegated to the Ideal Masters, then I could see a chain of events in which a sect of very powerful Ayleidoon necromancers usurped its seat. Shit like that happens all the time.  [edit] Now, you might consider looking at Mannimarco.

teslore,3dmuft,TBray96,58,Fri Jul 17 15:36:10 2015 UTC,"I'd wager that yeah, the LDB totally could. And furthermore I'd bet the dragons resurrected would switch loyalties without much issue. Dragons are absolute beings that respond to power in absolute states- there's no gray area with them, it's either ""I AM STRONG"" or ""I AM NOT STRONG"" when compared to another entity. Dragons are absurdly strong in general, of course, and dragon souls (or in the case of the LBD, soul clusters) are really the only things they respond to in terms of recognizing greater power. Alduin's Thu'um was strong; the LDB's was strong enough to kill him. AND Miraak, depending on player choices, which only adds greater weight to the power argument. Essentially, the way I see it things would go like this:  LDB wakes up dead dragon.  Dragon rises, expecting Alduin but recognizing a different Voice, one with a lot more strength to it.  Dragon's ""Speak, if you have aught to say worth listening"" instinct kicks in, and they hear out the LDB, either in common tongue or (likely) Thu'um, the latter of which would look like a fight but is literally just a conversation as far as a dragon is concerned.  A new ally for the LDB rises."
teslore,3dmuft,GuerreroDelAura,11,Fri Jul 17 17:18:24 2015 UTC,"That was my line of thought, that Dragons would behave very similarly to most other pack animal mentalities.  The strongest would be selected as the leader, this would be Alduin.  However, because the LDB has defeated Alduin he is now the strongest of the Dragons, and by right the new leader."
teslore,3dmuft,GuerreroDelAura,22,Fri Jul 17 17:42:10 2015 UTC,"Basically? Though I feel a need to draw a line between the dov and basic pack animals. These things are immortal and massively intelligent, and the fundamental chord (spelling intended) to their being is the basic duality of ""If X is stronger than Y, X dominates Y."" It doesn't matter what X and Y are, though the odds of X being anything that isn't a dragon are absurdly slim. You need power levels pushing demigodhood to rein in these guys. You're not just going to see Sven the Nord who's managed to kill a few, or even several, standing in the middle of four dragons like Chris Pratt in Jurassic World. They respond to not just the deeds, but the fundamental tonal architecture of the things around them.  Let's say Sven and the LDB had both managed, in separate hypothetical worlds, to kill off a hundred dragons. Sven still wouldn't be able to pull off that alpha dog move for two reasons: A, he never actually killed any dragons, because their immortal, insanely powerful souls remained, surviving long past the destruction of their bodies and eventually even being able to reconstruct themselves in one way or another. He beat them to kingdom come, which is inarguably impressive, but they weren't killed. This leads to the Dragonborn's advantage, which is B: Dragon souls absorb, collect and stack within other dragon souls that defeat them. So the dragons would look at Sven and think ""Hm, might want to be careful, I've heard some stuff about this guy"" but ultimately go ahead and still try to kill him with little concern beyond that. In the LDB's case, however, the dragons would sense within him the immense power of the hundred dragons slain and fused together to make this single wildy powerful being standing before them. That would resonate within them deeper than rumor or even having seen Sven in action, and move them to react in the way I described earlier.  TL;DR: Power, while mutable, is a fundamental aspect of being in TES Universe, and it's the one to which the dov most readily respond. In this case, they'd see the dragon souls as effectively one giant dragon, and act accordingly."

Their bodies can be reconstructed around them, however, which is what I think Alduin is doing.   That said, it's theoretically possible that the LDB could learn it, but it might be difficult, since they don't necessarily know much about how dragon bodies are constructed.

teslore,3dmorn,proweler,6,Fri Jul 17 15:36:03 2015 UTC,"Both detail how the forest people were unable to keep their shape, and different ways on how they attained the ability to keep a shape.   Keep in mind that given the context, the forest people are not the Bosmer. The forest people were the spirits of Mundus before there were any rules to keep things in a single shape. These rules weren't set until Y'ffre died. As such the forest-people, weren't people living in a forest, they were forest-and-animal-and-....-and-people people.  Also note that the Monomyth features a period in which the spirits of the early Aurbis exist without fixed shape or form. It shouldn't be a surprise that Mundus being amongst other things a return to the early Aurbis reflects that state of being for at least a little while.  It would appear that the Bosmer can break the shape shifting rules in their wild hunt due to their study and association with Y'ffre rather then as a race having been in a primal state that no other race experienced. The idea of Bosmer exceptionalism is interesting but doesn't work well with the concept of all mortals being limited et'Ada."
teslore,3dmorn,MareloRyan,10,Fri Jul 17 20:37:39 2015 UTC,I think that's supposed to be reflected by this bit from /u/banana_pirate's comment:   Before bosmer were bosmer   But I would agree that calling Khajiit a subgroup of Bosmer is inaccurate.

This is developed in ESO, and /u/queenayrenn has spoken about it at length on the sub.  This is why it's just the Bosmer and the Khajiit that talk about the Ooze, as opposed to every culture.  Edit:  Found some discussion on the matter.  I've also made some arguments myself that I'm trying to dig up."
teslore,3dmorn,proweler,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:52:45 2015 UTC,"That is a bummer.  One of the ideas/themes/implications/suggestions of the Monomyth and associated material is that the same story repeats at different scales. To allow this sort of recursion it requires that everything exists in the same domain.  E.g. the Aurbis is a dream, which dreams up et'Ada who are also dreams and inside one of those dreams we find a miniature Aurbis, who's history is that of the Aurbis except for scale and is as such populated by lesser et'Ada with their own internal lives.   This sort of Bosmer/Khajiit exceptionalism invalidates that. Perhaps there is a reasonable out written in to it but I'm not going to dig through another persons posts to find out."
teslore,3dmorn,MareloRyan,2,Fri Jul 17 21:13:38 2015 UTC,"Tracked down the argument I'd made before.  I understand your aesthetic objection, and it's obviously yours to make, but I disagree with it, personally.  I dislike the idea of an ordered Aurbis that obeys that kind of structural consistency.  Symbols and their power, in my vision of the metaphysics, are there to be taken advantage of by the perspicacious, not to impose themselves from the top down.  I don't see a reason that Mundus has to mirror the wider Aurbis.  It's just that, when it does, there's power in that.  But there is also power in forging new symbols."
teslore,3dmorn,proweler,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:22:10 2015 UTC,"Thanks for looking it up but that is a post in a chain of posts. Those discussions become intractable really fast for anybody but the participants.  Anyway its not really a symbolism thing. It's about how we talk about the Elderscrolls.  Consistency at a fundamental level is an extremely nice property for a fictional universe. It allows us to make extrapolations about what would happen even if we've never heard about it before. Call them fundamental laws of the Aurbis if you will.  Without these you can not make any meaningful predictions and extrapolations; any coincidences are just that, happy little accidents in the apparent shape of a tree but without further meaning. At best our discussions become re-statements of what we already know.  This doesn't mean new symbols can't be created but they have to be created in such a way that they absorb the existing knowledge as part of a greater framework. The new ideas still have to explain the old observations."
teslore,3dmorn,proweler,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:48:07 2015 UTC,Slightly different tack now.

What I'm trying to say is that the concept of beast races isn't something as clear cut as human or mer, but rather a societal construct to dehumanize races that don't share the traditional values and cultures of either humans or elves, they are outsiders (or, according to some sources, the original inhabitants of Tamriel)."

Beast Races of course refer to themselves as their own race rather than the umbrella term ""Beast Race"" because unlike humans and elves, there's no unifying culture between them, they were just lumped together because they are seen as inferior, bestial or uncultured by the rest of Tamriel."

Based on what we see with the Soul Cairn, and what can be drawn from the 'spirits' there, enchanting and the fact the Ideal Masters consume something from souls, I think we're talking about at least 2 components. The creatia that animates a being, and the actual mind of said being.   If we interpret the Dreamsleeve as an infinite well of possibility, of infinite consciousness and ever-present chatter, it could serve as a source of, and returning place for, the identities which we typically associate with souls.  The creatia which animates that identity is collected ambiently through their life, and upon death it is seperated. The 'mind' returns to the Dreamsleeve (basically data-storage) while the collected creatia is divided up and used to generate more identities. It would explain why Mundus never seems to suffer any real loss of equilibrium despite the Brotherhood, Enchanting and Daedra all taking souls. If it was a finite system, they'd have run out by now, but if it's a constantly cycling 'agriculture' where only the animating energy is recycles, it is a bit more sustainable."

But judging good and evil is very subjective. Who are you to judge what is good or evil? If someone has a moral code and lives by it, that's enough for me.  P.S. If you were to take the common stereotypes of each race, Yokudans are not the most morally good. Many people see them as overly violent and destructive (genocide against everyone on their home continent, which the SUNK). I would say the Khajiit are morally good in that they do not perform actions that they see as evil (but they see different things as good/evil, e.g. property is ambiguous), whereas almost every other race will perform an action, even if they consider it to be evil. Argonians are rather loyal to the Hist, so they won't perform actions that break their moral code/religion."

The castle that they are in has exits to the outside of Solitude as seen in the Dark Brotherhood questline. If Ulfric decides to siege the city the bulk of the forces will be in the main gate due to Solitude's strategic placement. Having the Legion come out through the secret exits would surprise the Stormcloaks and they would lose morale. If the Legion instead was outside the city, the most likely place for them to be stationed in would be the fort Legion players are asked to clear out. In case of a siege or attack they would have a day's journey at least to reach Solitude and the rear guard would most likely see them approaching and warn the rest of the army and then they would have the uphill advantage in the fight and the Legion would have a major defeat in their hands and probably speed up the end of the war if the people inside see the battle and will want to surrender instead of risk their lives against the Stormcloaks   Edit: Although having the Legion split between the fort and the city would have a greater strategic effect cause while the Legion stationed in the city begin their attack the Legion stationed in the fort could come and the would surround the enemy and probably kill of many or all the troops.

When he was in the Legion he was stationed in Cyrodill fighting against the AD so there was no need for him to know about it in Cyrodill. Also it's important to remember that he left the city through the main gates, putting himself in a great danger of being captured, which shows he had no knowledge of those exits or he's just plain dumb which I doubt even if I am pro Empire I admit the man is a genius"

teslore,3dlihg,SamLarson,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:52:35 2015 UTC,"I also highly doubt she came up with those decisions herself. I think what happened was the Legion shows up with all these reports and shows it to Elisif, her being new to this asks advice from her thanes and they say it's tactically advantageous to have the Legion in the city. The exact same thing happens with Whiterun, the Legion shows up and gives Balgruff a few reports and he sees its a tactical advantage to have the Legion in Whiterun. The difference is that he's a warrior and knows about battle tactics and she wasn't. But if we go with she's ignorant cause she had the Legion in the city then Jarl Balgruff is also ignorant for letting the Legion in the city. As for a threat of removal, you have to remember that not everything in TES is black and white and that there's that juicy grey part that we love. Thinking black and white the Empire would say if she's not letting us in we just have to remove her to get someone who is our puppet and they will let us in. This line of reasoning would lead to a very precarious position for the Legion in Skyrim, as in they are fighting a civil war and if the Holds aligned with the Empire see that if they don't listen to them then the leaders are removed and replaced with puppets. This would lead to more rebellions in an already fractured society and the Legion does not have the time or forces to fight the Stormcloaks and more rebels. So the most logical thing for Tullius to do is just find a fort to station the men if it gets to the point of Elisif ruling to not have them inside.   TLDR; Elisf has the sense to know when to listen to the advisors. The Empire wouldn't risk two rebellions in one province by removing Elisif from power"

teslore,3disn7,ArcaneRedguard,15,Thu Jul 16 22:02:40 2015 UTC,"Yes, because assigning the same skeleton to Argonians and Khajiits as the rest of the playable races is less resource intensive than making four alternate skeletons (one male, one female, two races) and then hundreds of extra armor models to properly fit them.  In Morrowind, both Khajiit and Argonians were digitigrade, both had differently shaped heads, and Argonians didn't have breasts.  For that game, rather than make new boot and helmet models or other equipment to take the place of boots and helmets, they simply didn't allow Khajiit and Argonian characters to equip them at all.  For Oblivion, there were fewer equipment slots, and thus each one counted more; presumably they decided to switch to a universal skeleton to allow for these characters to wear boots and helmets without dumping tons of resources on new models and equipment types.  Both games had their tradeoffs centering on this problem.  Skyrim obviously continued the trend of fewer equipment slots, and so it makes sense that they used the same solution.  As far as breasts specifically, it would be possible to adjust the female Argonian skeleton to be the same as the male, and thus have them use the same armor models.  But they're already compromising to get to that point, so they might as well save even more time and just come up with an interesting lore reason for the presence of breasts (or trust that people like us will)."

They're within Mundus.  Whether or not the Souls of the common folk go through the Dreamsleeve depends on what the Dreamsleeve is. If it's a feature of the Dream its self, and not a mechanism of the Aubris, it's easy, because it's basically an infinite possibility and memory storage. All the Dreamsleeve then would do is strip off the 'mind' from the collected aetherial energies of the soul.   To sustain the ever shifting balance of Mundus, particularly with effects like Sovengarde, the Daedra and Soul Cairn, the 'harvested' energy of the process is likely divided and used to energise multiple new souls, which then repeat the cycle of growth (and this power acquisition) death, division and reuse.

Maybe the Sovngarde we see in-game has all the cool souls in because the LDB qualifies for top-tier access, but mooks like the Stormcloak soldier usually get put with the other scrubs in z-list Sovngarde.

teslore,3dlera,Lachdonin,5,Fri Jul 17 11:09:07 2015 UTC,"OP, your idea that Morrowind is in ruins and in need of humanitarian aid is false. House Redoran rebuilt Morrowind. They're actually on the way up again. You can read about some of these events in this series.   While the Dunmer and their Great Houses are still technically Imperial citizens, they're more or less running their own country with minimal Imperial intervention. The pro-Empire house Hlaalu has been disbanded, and the more traditional Redoran runs the Council. The best thing Cyrodiil can do is to stay out of their way and not pry in their affairs."

teslore,3dl2fr,raskolnikova,13,Fri Jul 17 03:27:11 2015 UTC,"In order:   House Telvanni has weakened since the Oblivion Crisis and the eruption of Red Mountain, also known as the Red Year. They still exist, but are much weaker than as seen in Morrowind. Most fled Vvardenfell during the Red Year, either to other countries, the mainland of Morrowind (which was being invaded by Argonians, who seized an opportunity to take back land from the Dunmer in their moment of weakness), or to Solstheim.  House Redoran stepped in as the most powerful force against the opening of Oblivion portals during the Oblivion Crisis, and lead most of the forces against the daedric invasion. Morrowind was hit particularly badly by the Oblivion Crisis, far more so than Cyrodiil, mostly as a result of having all Imperial troops called back. Morrowind had no standing army of its own, and they were seemingly doomed. House Redoran quickly assembled an army to fight the invasion and the invading Argonians several years later. As a result, they became the most powerful Great House.  House Hlaalu was disgraced and eventually removed from the Grand Council of Morrowind and replaced by House Sadras. Early in the 4th Era, the Empire released Morrowind. This came after the Empire pulled all of their troops out of Morrowind to defend Cyrodiil, leaving Morrowind with no standing army. After all of this, Morrowind was a hotbed of anti-Imperial sentiment, and Hlaalu had the strongest ties to the Empire. Resentment grew so much that their status as a Great House was revoked.  The Dunmer in Morrowind have resented the Empire ever since the Oblivion Crisis. The ones within the country and colonies owned by Morrowind are still known to be anti-Empire, as referenced by the quests you receive in Raven Rock to undermine a Hlaalu plot. However, outside of these areas, it varies. The Dunmer in Windhelm are less resentful of the Empire, and are even glad if the Empire wins the war and takes over Windhelm. However, this is because Brunwulf Free-Winter, who replaces Ulfric Stormcloak as Jarl if the Empire wins, is far fairer to the non-Nord citizens of Windhelm. Little is known about the current sovereign of Morrowind and how much power they hold. Morrowind's current capital, Blacklight, is Redoran-dominated, and the ruler is almost certainly associated with House Redoran. They could be making their own decisions, or be a figurehead of House Redoran, the ruling house. Political parties in Morrowind are better defined as the Great Houses. Slavery was outlawed in Morrowind sometime between Morrowind and Oblivion. There is no information on the current state of the slavery market in Tamriel; if it exists, it is an entirely underground, black market operation. There would be few records saved by underground slavers to pinpoint exactly how large the illegal slave operation would be."
teslore,3dl2fr,SarahTheJuneBug,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:43:52 2015 UTC,"I actually asked this question a couple weeks back when I returned. The lore on Morrowind in the 4E is pretty vague, even after Dragonborn.   Brand-Shei being the last member of House Telvanni   You are right, Brand-Shei is most definitely not the last living member of House Telvanni. however it wasn't a hicup on the part of Bethesda, it was a certain Lymdrenn Telvanni's misinformation. For a great elaboration on this I suggest reading [this].(https://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/3a42df/so_what_happened_to_house_telvanni_in_4e/cs98eo0)   What about House Hlaalu?   House Hlaalu was stripped of all their land after House Redoran took over. House Sadras took their position and probably their land. The Hlaalu then fell into two categories, at least from what we see. Either they retired and went on to being normal people. Or they kept living on trying to overthrow House Redoran and take their land and titles back.   How Westernized is the average Dunmer now?   I'm not sure what you mean by this. Tamriel has no such thing as westernization, everyone is at the same point of technological advancement and cultural development. If you mean how well off they are they're doing fine as of 4E 201. Vvardenfell is being resettled (although there are a bit too many settlements right now, but that's not really a big deal) and mainland Morrowind is in the process of being rebuilt. The Argonians haven't taken any land from Morrowind, at least in my opinion. That's debatable but I point to the fact that it is referred to as an attempt at expansion. House Dres is also still on the Grand Council and they surely would have been conquered if the Argonians took land. After all, the Dres capital is Tear, Morrowind's southern most city.  The Empire holds little influence over Morrowind. House Redoran isn't too find of the Empire and the Empire removed all its legions from Morrowind during the Oblivion Crisis. There isn't anything that says Morrowind seceded. If it did you think that would have been mentioned, thus I think the Dunmer are still a part of the Empire but they're almost completely autonomous. While Morrowind probably still has a King of Queen they would have virtually no power at this point since the Empire is gone. To be honest we just don't know the current status of the Dunmer monarchy.   does that mean that slavery probably still exists underground in Morrowind?   I would assume the Dunmer still hold Khajiiti slaves. The Argonians slaves are mostly, if not all gone due to the invasion.  All in all Morrowind is doing alright, but they're still doing the worst of any province. That's not really bad though, no province is doing all that bad. Well except maybe Cyrodiil, but they've rebuilt by now."
teslore,3dl2fr,Watosh66,4,Fri Jul 17 04:27:58 2015 UTC,"Sorry -- in Morrowind Imperials are often referred to as being from ""the West"" and Morrowind is referred to as ""the East"" -- I don't mean ""Westernization"" like we usually mean here on Earth.

teslore,3dl2fr,Rosario_Di_Spada,3,Fri Jul 17 06:13:02 2015 UTC,"You're right to do so.

teslore,3dkpa3,Rusty_Shakalford,8,Fri Jul 17 02:29:30 2015 UTC,"Just poked around the imperial library for a bit. Closest reference I could find to dwarfism was from ""Horror of Castle Xyr"".   CLAVIDES: There is a suspected necromancer at the college named Kena Warvim we arrested last night. We don't know what he was doing at the college, but it was something illegal, that's for certain. Was that the kena who borrowed the book? A little fellow, a cripple with a withered leg?   But it's tenuous, as ""little fellow"" who is a ""cripple"" could be interpreted a thousand different ways.  Still, don't see any reason you couldn't have a human with dwarfism. Or mer for that matter.    Edit: I really shouldn't post at 1 a.m. I was searching for every term I could think of as a synonym for ""disability"" or ""short"" (""dwarf"" turned up too many unrelated results to use). They way Baloth-Kul refers to the unnamed Kena is really messed up, but it's the only reference I could find that could be interepretted as dwarfism.  Granted, I am assuming that dwarfism is seen as a disability in Tamriel. If not, it might not even a warrent a mention in a person's biography. Reman himself could have been a little person for all we know.    Edit Edit: I forgot about the 500 companions! Buried right in the middle is ""Dlunga the Dwarf (not that kind)""  So yes. There have been individuals in Tamriel with dwarfism, and at least one is considered among the honored warriors of the past. My earlier assumptions were lazy and narrow-minded so I wouldn't have to search through 20 pages of unrelated Dwemer stuff."

teslore,3djp7j,middleman35,10,Thu Jul 16 22:19:03 2015 UTC,"True. And considering that any old guy that kills a shady guy in a basement or the owner of an orphanage will do, 10-20 isn't unrealistic at all."

They may be the most boring, one dimensional murder-cult in the setting, but people seem to love them because 'Oooh, their edgy' and 'Lucien Lechance is so dreamy' or whatever.

The biggest, most glaring difference is that in the real world, it takes a new species millions of years to evolve. Nirn is only around 7000 years old. Many of her races have appeared within the past 3000 to 4000 years due to magical and divine tampering. The thing Men and Mer have in common is common descent from an ancestor, which is also a concept in Evolution. Their common ancestor was the Ehlnofey, who then split into two distinct groups.

Besides, if the Ehlnofey split into two different groups / subspecies / species, there's no way the offspring could be fertile.

teslore,3djbvs,Rosario_Di_Spada,2,Thu Jul 16 21:11:41 2015 UTC,"Clearly, a great many things in this and other fantasy settings just don't. I listed common descent as the only obvious thing TES evolution had in common with ours. The rest of it's pretty much ""a wizard/god/hist did it""."

That's one of the things that really disturb me in this setting, as much as I love it otherwise. Replacing logical and / or scientific study and handwaving it with a magical / divine explanation hurts my heart of scholar. I think even magic and divine elements should be submitted to a thorough logical study (and by this I mean finding an explanation that makes sense in-universe, of course, not trying to explain magic with our world's science)."

You are expecting the games to give you a laboratory study result, which they do not. They give you legends and bits of evidence, but, as in real life, things are as they are, and you need to really dig and theorize to understand.

I'm not ""bitching"", whatever that word means, I'm only expressing an opinion. You don't like it ? Feel free to tell me, but politely, please.  Anyway, my answer is :  1) There are many areas left unexplained, and the mechanisms of evolution of species are part of those, unless you consider the Notes on racial phylogeny to be a complete and accurate essay, which they're clearly not.  2) I'm not trying to explain everything with Earth science, but some things, and so far the explanations I've drawn from that stance are quite satisfactory (to me) and do not create problems. It is also a mental exercise I like doing. Also, if you read me well, you'll have seen that I wrote ""and by this I mean finding an explanation that makes sense in-universe, of course, not trying to explain magic with our world's science"". So far I don't have seen any explanation that makes sense in-universe, so I'm trying to find one.  3) I'm not expecting anything from the games, only from the lore. And what I expect is to find elements who can help me find explanations, not laboratory study results.  4) You said : ""things are as they are, and you need to really dig and theorize to understand.""

I meant what I said not in an angry way, but in an explanatory way. My vocabulary is always like that, not just when I'm mad. Bitching is a synonym for complaining (maybe it doesn't translate to french). I didn't downvote your comment, BTW. I'm not going to go through the work of going to your profile just for that.  To answer your points:   The reason they're left unexplained, is because that's realistic. In the 1700s, before evolution was even a theory, there weren't essays explaining how everything came about, and so most people believed in a faith that explained it. TES is the same way, except gods are real there, and actually do do a lot of things. So it's much more realistic that essays about evolution aren't found on every bookshelf. There are explanations that make sense in-universe, but they aren't always readily apparent. Again, with the analogy. No one handed Darwin the theory of evolution and said ""this is the explanation"". He examined evidence and drew conclusions, creating the theory. So don't expect everything pre-explained. That's what theorizing on TESlore is for. (BTW, there is an in-universe explanation already. It's the wandering ehlnofey turned into men, yadda yadda, read a book). In the games, you see a slice of the world. You need to extrapolate and theorize, not simply take it at face value. They give a small fraction of what you would be able to research IRL, and thus we do not have the complete picture. You complained that people are hand waving without explanation.. That's not what they're doing. I simply said that you should dig and theorize about that stuff if you want an explanation, because so little of the world is actually explained."

Nothing in the lore really contradicts this premise, and if you find something that does, feel free to bring it up and discuss it.    Mer and Men belong to the same species : the Ehlnofey. The differences are :  — The split between Old and Wandering Ehlnofey, which set the Man / Mer distinction. It may have been a begun process of speciation, and drew the main differences we know today (mainly lifespan, fertility and shape of the ears). But the speciation wasn't complete : as you pointed out, Man / Mer offspring is indeed fertile, and with the globalization Tamriel has since known, it makes sense for the process to have stopped at some point.  — I very much like your idea of most of the racial features being gender-dependent, which could explain the fact we observe without contradicting the laws of evolution. That also allowes for the existence of Manmer / Bretons : the mixings between Nedes and Altmer happened during literally centuries, which is largely enough for two different populations to blend together.  — Some of the racial differences are explained by mythical / godly interference, the two main examples being Orsimer and Dunmer. It might be an example of the genetic manipulation powers of the Daedra : these new features seem to have perfectly integrated in the whole ""transmitted by the mother"" thing.  — I consider the affinity for magic as more of a cultural trait than a genetic one. Inter-individual variation of magic potential is stronger than inter-""races"" variation, in my humble opinion.  — Khajiits are another example of godly interference, and the second by Azura alone (well, Azurah). Did the incorporation of feline features made it enough for it to be considered as a speciation, and are Khajiits and the rest of Man / Mer fertile ? The Real Barenziah, in its uncensored version, mentions that having sex with Khajiits or humans makes it much more likely for a female Mer to get impregnated, which teaches us two things : a) Khajiit are still Mer and still belong to the Ehlnofey species, and b) the low or high fertility of Man and Mer is mostly determined by the male's seed.

teslore,3djbvs,OctagonalHumanist,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:42:33 2015 UTC,"I think the general consensus is that, yes, Men and Mer are different cultural distinctions of the same species, which is just commonly referred to as ""human"" with a lower case h. From what I've read, both Dunmer and Orcs are described as ""human"" in Morrowind and even in ESO the Khajiit use the word ""inhuman"" to describe Daedra as if the standard applies to them as well. Obviously Elves are not Humans (with a capital h) or Men, and Men are not Elves, but they belong to the same species of humanoid mortals."
teslore,3djbvs,Lorkhaj,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:23:36 2015 UTC,"To put it simply, the sun is a whole in hell. Science as we know and more specifically DNA isn't a thing in TES. So speciation is not the same. Men can interbreed, and can mate with elves. A 20 foot tall tiger-shaped senche-raht can mate with a housecat sized Khajiit. I don't believe they could breed with a human, though, because Azurah blessed them with the ja'Khajay, which might not be compatible with human biology. Argonians are just lizards that grow into different shapes because they get super high on sentient tree sap. So they can't mate with the other races."
teslore,3djbvs,cthulhuh00p,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:25:56 2015 UTC,"An individual species is defined as ""who can mate and produce offspring who are fertile."" Men and mer can produce children together, so by that definition, they are the same species, albeit with different races and variants. Those different races include aesthetic variations (like our definition of race being based on pigment) and some inborn resistances/weaknesses like Breton being resistant to magic (not like our definition of race)."
teslore,3djbvs,PhantomofaWriter,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:01:26 2015 UTC,"This produced a phisically strong race adept in magic and there also called Manmer.   Elven ancestry = magical adeptness is false, and affinity means a natural liking by the way, not an innate superiority. Anyway, that is as descriptive as saying Nords have an affinity for battleaxes. Every race has the potential to be adept with magic given the way magic functions in TES - it's basically omnipresent. Game mechanics are for the sake of the game and pocket guides are hardly detailed. Magical proficiency is a matter of them bothering with it, and Bretons have very little 'elven blood'. They have breed with humans since the early first era.   I would argue the significance of their elven ancestry is cultural - seeing how High Rock was the last place of elven dominance on the mainland - than biology, similar to how breeding wolf-dogs with wolves and with more wolves over the generations will make their domesticated dog ancestry moot. It was not until ESO that slight points in their ears became an option. Notice how UESP does not provide a citation for Bretons having faint elven features. An innate resistance to magic is not in the lore either, unless one considers video game descriptions to be lore. I do not.  And prior to Morrowind, TES biology functioned like ours. There is a Dark Elf in King Edward 'disproving' King Edward having elven ancestry on the grounds he did not look half elven.  But to ancestry the question, yes. They are different subspecies."

I wasn't intending to be passive-aggressive with the brevity of that answer and I'm sorry it came across to you that way, but I feel like it could only be viewed as passive-aggressive if one has skipped the rest of the FAQ.  You mentioned many of the answers come across that way -- which are the others? Snarkiness is the last thing the FAQ should have and I'd love to change it!"
teslore,3dji2o,Prince-of-Plots,7,Fri Jul 17 00:05:38 2015 UTC,"Saying No to that question is completely honest. What would you rather have it say? Yes there is and then explain it. That answer would be dishonest. There is no summary of the entirety of Elder Scrolls lore. Try summarizing it all without having to write a book. Even then there's so much speculation and vagueness to be truthful in many areas. Maybe there should an elaboration, but saying no is enough in my opinion. I think people can figure out enough about what the FAQ is trying to say in that question without having to give an explanation.  Most of the other answers in the FAQ are a few sentences or more and give a thorough explanation. I wouldn't call that passive-aggressive.  How to Become a Lore Buff is linked in the first sentence in the FAQ, so I'm not sure what you're referring to."

I'm rather knowledgeable with this stuff, relatively speaking, and I know jack fuck about vast swaths of Tamrielic history and culture. It's just inevitable. Everyone is a specialist because there's just too damn many lines of inquiry to pursue. It's not like how all Dragon Age stories are ultimately ruminations on the role of magic in Thedas. Every TES game introduces a dozen different themes worth investigating.

The only way to do it in any manageable volume is going to leave out so much detail it'll be just about worthless.   It's far more reasonable to have summaries of specific periods, cultures or concepts rather than trying to summarise it all at once. We're not talking about Warcraft here, or even Warhammer (which is hefty in its own right) but a universe on which most of our information is both contextual and contradictory, leading to competing explanations and interpretations.

I also don't like it because it seems conveniently quiet. For beings  fromanother universe they are pretty damn normal, breeding and lessening in power and forgetting everything about higher realities. As degenerate et a da it makes a bit more sense because less knowledge is lost over time by comparison.

teslore,3dji11,Sakazwal,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:32:25 2015 UTC,"Would that not then disagree with the ehlnofey as subgradient et'ada,   Yes.  But that's kind of the core supposition of the idea, that descent from the et'Ada is a mistaken picture.  I wouldn't call that ""breaking"" the lore so much as just...  the point of the idea in the first place.   therefore the road of Amaranth is no longer to go to go down through gradients to the lowest because the et'ada never did this as the ehlnofey.   Not necessarily.  First of all, ""gradients"" are mostly metaphorical representations of capacity for self-reflection.  They aren't actual structures that everything fits into in a series of descent.  Second, I wouldn't even agree that gradients are all that relevant once you get to the level of et'Ada and mortals.  Et'Ada are already just as capable of self-reflection as mortals are.  They just have less impetus to pursue immortality since they aren't mortal in the first place.  Et'Ada and mortals alike are already at Amaranth's doorstep, in my view.  Ehlnofey are just spirits that started their existence outside the Dream of Anu.  They can still follow the roadmap laid out by Lorkhan as well as any other spirit of the Aurbis.   I also don't like it because it seems conveniently quiet. For beings fromanother universe they are pretty damn normal, breeding and lessening in power and forgetting everything about higher realities. As degenerate et a da it makes a bit more sense because less knowledge is lost over time by comparison.   I mean, you say it's quiet and not pointed out, and totally forgotten, but we are talking about a story, presumably handed down over time, that depicts their origins as being outside Anu's Dream.  You're also assuming, by calling them ""pretty damn normal,"" that spirits from another universe wouldn't adapt themselves to work by the mechanics of the universe they travel to.  They don't necessarily get to carry their old physics with them.  They probably have to become compatible with the new physics in order to exist within it at all.   Uhh actually it occurs to me now: by ehlnofey in this contextwho are you referring to, the ancestors of mortal species (my assumption above ) or the earthbones, or another?   Mortal ancestors.  Not Earthbones."
teslore,3dji11,MareloRyan,3,Sat Jul 18 03:15:54 2015 UTC,"The elves are (nominally) descended from the Ehlnofey a part of the et'Ada that helped make Mundus. Now given that time only starts with the Convention its entirely possible that entities ""not created yet"" could have front row seats to their own creation because concepts like ""linear"" do not exist yet.   From there those became the mortals of Nirn simply had to tell their kids.   Alternately... someone pulled it out of an Elder Scroll."
teslore,3dji11,SolomonBlack,3,Thu Jul 16 20:22:56 2015 UTC,"All spirits are born from Anui-El, so the et'Ada must have known about it. Perhaps they knew of it from birth or from Anui-El, but we'll probably never know. The Ehlnofey are et'Ada who became the Aldmer after Convention. Past that point it must have been passed down via oral tradition, and eventually written about. It has probably been distorted in truth over the generations which is why it's so vague and myth-like."
teslore,3dji11,Watosh66,2,Thu Jul 16 20:23:00 2015 UTC,"The Anuad is known by the Altmer because of their obsessive record keeping, most particularly their record keeping of ancestry.

teslore,3dhini,JaggedJack,13,Thu Jul 16 09:06:41 2015 UTC,"Fairly versatile, but crude, I imagine. You don't seem to be able to shape the Thu'um as easily as magic, which makes intuitive sense: Shouting is forcibly inserting new notes into the Song. You could probably light or put out candles, but not make a Fire Rune.  Sound is integral. If you can't speak, you can't Shout, as shown in Skyrim's introduction.  It's not magicka; it's the ability to force concepts to exist, once you know them. It's an issue of intelligence, knowledge, practice and, in the case of dragons, inborn ability. Yes. Jurgen Windcaller ""swallowed"" enemy shouts.    Shouts are powerful and dangerous, just like magicka - even the Greybeards can accidentally kill an ordinary person with a whisper. Users of all forms of magic are rare, which is good because one crazy omnicidal Tongue would be a terrible threat.  As for Mirmunir, removing the gameplay from the equation, he undoubtedly did kill many guards. However, they were spread out - he could only Shout one out of existence at a time, whilst being pelted with arrows. Also, Irileth and the Dovahkiin there - as an experienced warrior and a dragon respectively, they had enough force of I AM not to be killed outright by the Thu'um. Also, Mirmulnir wasn't a particularly strong dragon.    Almost entirely gameplay. When the Greybeards teach you Unreleneting Force and you have to demonstrate it, the cooldown is cancelled for the purpose of the quest, showing that, in lore terms, you can Shout indefinitely.    There would be some element of fatigue - Shouting clearly takes cognitive effort - but not as shown ingame."

teslore,3dhini,Rosario_Di_Spada,3,Thu Jul 16 12:18:48 2015 UTC,"I'll answer only partially :  3- I think it refers to the fact that the Dragonborn has an inner ability to comprehend and use the Thu'um, not like standard people. It may be a reference to the strength of their will (which would explain the differences of power between dragons).  4- I think so. Two Tongues shouting ""Fus Ro Dah"" at each other would probably partially counter each other.   when he could have hypothetically destroyed them all with a word?   Remember you have to be targeted by a word to feel its effects.  5- Mostly gameplay, I'd say. Sure, using Thu'um must be very exhausting, but more like D&D magic, I'd say — you need to rest at the end of the day, not after each shout."
teslore,3dhini,Cyclenophus,2,Thu Jul 16 10:26:33 2015 UTC,"Thanks so much for your answers. If you could indulge me a little more, what do you mean when you say you have to be targeted? Would someone have to say a word with you specifically in mind? Could they not target multiple people at once?"
teslore,3dhini,badluckartist,5,Thu Jul 16 10:59:14 2015 UTC,"The guards were spread out, specifically to nullify the Dragon's ability to spew fire at them all at once. Ireleth had never fought a Dragon before, but was aware of the legends of their abilities. All the Nord guardsmen from Whiterun seemed to know what to expect, too. So they spread out, and attacked Mirmulnir from multiple directions at once. Not a bad strategy, really. Only a few Shouts we know of could have attacked the group in that way, including Storm Call, but this particular Dragon chose to try to kill them one by one with fire, ice and physical attacks, in its arrogance, and paid the price."
teslore,3dhini,Cyclenophus,2,Thu Jul 16 11:08:38 2015 UTC,"I know there's a good few factors that go into a dragon's strength relative to other dragons, but I like the idea of weaker dragons having greater arrogance. Limiting their own vocabulary because they think it's easy to win an argument with mortals."
teslore,3dhini,badluckartist,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:13:19 2015 UTC,"Right. Couple that with the fact that Dragons are immune to fear, and are therefore not likely to retreat under normal circumstances, and you have a recipe that spelled doom for many of them when mortals decided to fight back. Mirmulnir had wisely hid himself away for centuries, surviving both the initial Dragon War and the Akaviri purges, only to let his latent arrogance prove to be his undoing. Perhaps he was emboldened by the return of Alduin, but he fought sloppy. He didn't even consider the presence of a Dragonborn."
teslore,3dhini,MareloRyan,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:11:08 2015 UTC,Wait Mirmulnir hid himself away? I figured he was just another temporarily-dead goon of Alduin's who just happened to be one of the first resurrected.

teslore,3dhini,Rosario_Di_Spada,2,Thu Jul 16 21:09:37 2015 UTC,"Basically what Cyclenophus said. If you're not on the trajectory of the shout (be it fire, ice or a Death shout), you won't be affected."
teslore,3dhini,pike184,2,Thu Jul 16 11:12:32 2015 UTC,"I guess this ties back into one of my original questions, but does a shout have to have a trajectory? If a dragon utters the word for kill (which is what I realise I meant when I talked about the word for death, sorry) could they, for example, make whoever hears the word kill themselves instead of having it manifest as a projectile that kills you if you touch it?"
teslore,3dhini,MareloRyan,2,Thu Jul 16 11:52:30 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure. You would have to have additional words in order for ""Kill"" to mean ""kill yourself upon hearing""."
teslore,3dhini,xXxcock_and_ballsxXx,2,Thu Jul 16 13:08:31 2015 UTC,"My theory around this is that it would take an extremely powerful tongue or dragon to utter the word krosis and actually kill the target. In the game, the ""marked for death"" shout contains the word for death but does not directly kill the target but weakened it. I would assume that the LDB did not either have the willpower or the understanding of the word to kill it.   This could be partially supported by the dialogues with parthurnax where he helps you to ponder the true meanings of a few words making them more powerful."
teslore,3dhini,Siniroth,3,Thu Jul 16 16:17:39 2015 UTC,"My own answers:   As versatile as the Tone-Concept the word represents, which is the real power behind a Shout.  ""Fire"" could create fire in many forms, but to snuff it out, you would probably need an additional Tone to modify the overall meaning. I think it depends on the intent.  Whispering while Shouting ""Fire"" would probably light a candle just fine, but not roast a bandit.  Thu'um works by conveying inner meaning through outer actions; if your meaning is powerful and overt, your actions probably have to reflect that in order to carry it into the world.  This also means that you can't Shout without performing the actual action of Shouting. Strength of understanding and will.  Definitely not magicka or some other fuel.  The thing about the Voice is that it's not about the words.  The words are just carriers of Tones; mastering Tones is what you need to Shout, not just knowing the words.  Even dragons have to meditate on them. As above, it's not about just knowing the definition of the word and then saying it.  It's a matter of willpower, of ability to gather that Tone in your mind and shove it out into the world to change what is real and what is not.  As for competing Voices, you'll want to read about Jurgen Windcaller. Almost entirely gameplay mechanic.  Notice that other Thu'um users in the game do not have this restriction.  It's not hard to imagine that it's possible to over-exert your mind and throat while using the Thu'um, but it almost certainly wouldn't be a matter of every Shout requiring a rest period.  You'd probably just have to rest when you're done."
teslore,3dhini,SolomonBlack,2,Thu Jul 16 13:49:48 2015 UTC,"1: Shouting is a crude form of tonal architecture, that is changing the fundamental tones that make up the universe. The rest of this i'll work into Question 2  2: Sound is important, but at the same time I don't think it's required to alter tones. I believe that the Actual aspect of shouting solidifies the idea of the tone in a single moment. It's a fundamental part of the technique used by dragons (and by extension mortals who learn it), but I reckon if you had sufficient grasp the idea of say, fire, you could achieve the same effect without any sound escaping your lips. It's unlikely that anyone actually knows how to do this.  3: Willpower and understanding the ""tone"" of the words. As per answer , shouting is crude, it's essentially forcing something to happen because you will it. It's essentially limitless, but there's a glass ceiling in how much dragons and mortals can understand of the tones.   4: Absolutely. It's a battle of willpower and knowledge, one of the reasons the greybeards can kick your arse. They don't have TLD's raw power and talent, but they have much more intimate understanding of the words so they can apply them better.      The answer to this one would mostly explain how, once any practitioner learns the word for 'kill'     This is because, few would have an intimate knowledge of the tones of death. Dragon's wouldn't know as they're immortal and death is an entirely alien concept to them. Mortals only have the chance to aquire an intimate knowledge about death when they.. die. they aren't around to apply that knowledge afterwards.   5: Because the technique used by dragons and mortals is based around breathing, I'd say it's mostly gameplay. I think it would be more realistic if it generated fatigue. You can shout a whole load but after a while your throat hurts, you start running out of breath ect. there's also the extraordinary amount of willpower required that would be very mentally exhausting. You're literally forcing your will onto the universe."

Namely, a specific action being required on the part of the caster (in this case shouter) in order to cast the spell.   IIRC, a character wonders why she needs to form her hands a certain way to weave magic, and she mused about someone having enough willpower to weave spells without any hand movements or formations.  I imagine it would be something like that, if anything. Hypothetically possible, but difficult to the point of pointlessly weak if done at all"
teslore,3dhini,SolomonBlack,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:48:41 2015 UTC,"Mine own 2 septims:   1) Tiid Klo Ul will slow down time, and Iiz Slen Nus will freeze you solid, but Slen Tiid Vo revives a dead dragon. If word can have more then one meaning presumably they can have more then one Shout. That said it would be akin to learning the word over since you need to absorb its concept in a different aspect, which might also interfere. I presume the other words of a shout, shaping rather then making, help make this easier.  2) Seems you need to speak, Tiber Septim was apparently near disabled after the death of Cuhlecain where he came out with Emperor Zero's crown and a slit throat. I would given that you are essentially loudly affirming a concept with words that the only whispers would be sufficiently quite ideas. You might whispher to start a candle... but not a firestorm.  3) Same thing as anything else probably, its technically a skill being Dragonborn just allows you to cheat. 4) There's support with Jurgen Windcaller swallowing the voices of the 17 Disputants in a 3 day battle/debate. This could be particular to him as a master Tongue and found of the Way of the Voice, and sounds a lot like a morality lesson where he was stronger because his heart was pure. Also while thu'um is powerful we've ample evidence its not magical genie shallow where you can just say ""die"" and they die. You must take the concept the word incarnates into yourself and know it and comprehend it. This is why dragons can't learn Dragonrend, its a shout of mortality and they are eternal. You really could know death well enough to just shout someone dead... you'd probably die.  5) Alduin uses Fire Breath while Dragon Storm Call is active. So much shorter than in game mechanics, though remembering how it works I'd say spitting ""YolYolYolYolYolYolYolYolYol"" would be about as effective as a kid trying the windmill punch. In general its an energetic art, I'd tag wearing yourself out to similar to fighting or other high energy physical activities."

The Missing God is always related to the Mortal Plane, and is a key figure in the Human/Aldmeri schism. The 'missing' refers to either his palpable absence from the pantheon (another mental distress that is interpreted a variety of ways), or the removal of his 'divine spark' by the other immortals. He is often called Lorkhan, and his epitaphs are many, equally damnable and devout."

She found herself in a very sensitive political situation. She needed to keep the Nords as her allies, but they were (at that time) fiercely opposed to any adoration of Elven deities. On the other hand, she could not force her subjects to revert back to the Nordic pantheon, for fear of another revolution. Therefore, concessions were made and Empress Alessia instituted a new religion: the Eight Divines, an elegant, well-researched synthesis of both pantheons, Nordic and Aldmeri.

Some form of him appears in every faith, just like Akatosh, who appears in all save that of the Dunmer.   I've never heard of Lorkhan giving himself up as a lesson to the Aedra, but it seems far more in line with human beliefs, where he would be known as Shor, which isn't what you are looking for."

They are like the mortal plane in that they are temporal and subject to the bounds of mortality; in fact of this, the moons are dead and died long ago. The moons used to be pure white and featureless, but today their 'skin' is decaying and withering away. Their planes are likewise dying. Mortals perceive this as the moons being spheres with patches of their 'surfaces' completely eaten away; as the moons spin, they seem to become slivers or ragged crescents. These are not caused by shadows, because you can see stars through the black patches of the lunar spheres.

teslore,3dfj0a,DuIstalri,18,Thu Jul 16 00:10:02 2015 UTC,"The ancient aldmeri religion from which modern merish beliefs descends did not recognize the dragon god of time as the harbinger of endings. They viewed him as the first moment, the time of beginnings. Auriel they named this god and via their emulation of him they sought to return to that beginning.   So I would say that elves do not believe in Alduin or any sort of Alduinish type of deity because the focus on death that Alduin represents as the end of time is a very mannish one. Human cultures put a huge emphasis on death because life is short, in less than a century you are gone. Their time god aspect reflects this well.  The elves on the other hand have a naturally longer lifespan and as such their focus on death is very different. When they think of death they see as merely another part of the movement of the spirit, and their ancestors are to them an example of what they strive to return to: the past, the beginning. Back to Auriel, return to the stasis of everlasting perfect divinity.  But that's quite esoteric and really, most men and elves don't give a rat's ass about it. They believe what they are raised to believe and it doesn't go much deeper than the surface of that, even for the very pious.

If Lorkhan introduced mortality and death and the mannish beliefs tend to venerate Lorkhan, perhaps they came to embody his ideas of mortality."
teslore,3dfj0a,hoosierdaddy163,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:57:19 2015 UTC,"I'd assume it had to do with being the wanderers. The Ehlnofey who stayed put had access to greater standards of living and technology, so they didn't have to keep breaking themselves down in order to survive and so had longer lives while the Wanderers kept losing power, dying earlier on, so they breeded faster to compensate, and over time magickal evolution just sort of stuck as they continued to subgradient.   The idea with Lorkhan's influence isn't bad though, but I could it more as him being the catalyst for their continued movement, the one who goaded the wanderers to wander, and then through what I said above they lessened in stature. In that way his influence is still there, but not because of mannish beliefs which, IMO, wouldn't make much sense in the context of the Old Ehlnofey."

Wreck the casbah, become Godbeings, stop humans being so fuckin' annoying about having a god of their species, I mean, come on, Aedra is literally 'Our Ancestors', you're not special, humans!  But then this dragon shows up, and then apparently a bloody Dovahkin pops up, with the Voice, something associated with the man-god Talos a bit, according to some of our intel. Suffice it to say, we were all ""what the bloody Sheogorath's waxy cheeses is going on?"".  Then reports came in of normal folk killing these dragons, pretty much without much effort. This Dovahkin sometimes appeared, but after a while (this 'Alduin' appeared to have been stopped, somehow?) dragons became manageable.  We proceeded with our plans. It seemed a bit irrelevant to our goals beyond self preservation if and when one dragon does pop up near us.  Whoa, it resets the world a bit, with the Kapa thing??

The Thalmor didn't have any idea what was going on, as per Diplomatic Immunity. Alduin wasn't trying to eat the world during the events of Skyrim. If he was, that would have been that. He certainly wouldn't have been dicking around resurrecting dragons and such. He was trying to conquer everything, as he had before.

Akatosh wishes to preserve the current kalpa rather than destroy it, but he needs an excuse. This is when Alduin returns from the Dragon Break at Snow-throat and resumes his plan to rule over the world rather than consume it. Akatosh decides this is the perfect time to end the kalpic cycle, splitting off a piece of his oversoul to create the LDB. When exactly this happens is up for debate, but I'd assume he did this in advance, as he does have control over Time as do all Aka aspects.

Of course, killing a God is more complex and metaphorical than just stabbing it or whatever, so in typical MK manner, Shit Gets Weird.  That image is Jubal Iun Sul and his friend standing on the surface of their moon looking down on the smashed remains of Nirn, with the ""wheels of lull"", aka Sotha Sil's ""clockwork city"" exposed.

Huge wheels providing the skeletal structure of Nirn that get exposed after numidigeddon.  Sotha Sil's Clockwork City was either part of it, or some way to access it.    Their name comes from Ramon Llull, a Catalan troubadour, poet, author, mystic, logician, missionary, martyr, and Beatus (in roughly that order) who invented an ""irrefutable"" method of converting the Moor to Christianity, which he called his Art.  This Art used logic trees and visual maps to establish universal truths, from which to logically derive Catholic doctrine. This gets him called the Godfather of Coding.  He tried it out in North Africa and was mortally wounded via public stoning.    The practice of this Art revolved around the Wheels of Lull, a mnemonic device to help missionaries defeat the paynim with logic.  One wheel listed the attributes of God (eternity, power, wisdom, will, etc) and wheels within wheels listed other accepted truths in other fields of knowledge.  These wheels were rotated to prove Christian ideas through their intersections.    I'm not sure what they're doing in Nirn, exactly.  Maybe as the memory-gears in the clock that keeps time.  Maybe as a computational system to prove God.  Maybe as a method to derive thought from objective truths."

teslore,3dbk8j,SolomonBlack,3,Wed Jul 15 00:23:05 2015 UTC,"If they could do that there'd be zero need to summon anything.  In terms of magical theory remember your talking about opening a hole in existence and pulling something through. While there are of course only arbitrary possibilities it makes a certain about of sense that you could only perform this in fluids or vacuum because the energy of the spell is not suited to you know actual phsyical force which it still has to manifest as to sever a solid object. Or the portal is there but nothing can get through because its a solid wall of whatever in the way and you don't have enough force to pull anything through that.  Except of course in stories were this is basically the best way to cut something because you magically create an infinite distance between two points.   (For a third possiblity if in creating the portal you warp space like relativity you'd sort of suck anything through without necessarily cutting anything and the dimension of the object would simply contort weirdly because its still locally in its own solid space)  Remember there is no such thing as ""must be"" when it comes to fictional abilities. The ""internal logic"" of a setting is the gimp basement slave woken up to service its master the story. The rules are invented to suit the story not the other way around, so if an ability isn't supported... then there's actually probably a ""reason"" it can't be done not is totally possible and everyone just doesn't think of it.   Telling us all of these would simply be a waste of time more often then not."
teslore,3dbk8j,ArcaneRedguard,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:03:17 2015 UTC,"Yes I was following a similar line of thought, I didn't anticipate that there would be anything specific listed in lore and don't see why anything would be- it would be a very specific thing to write about. It was just an idle thought. If it were possible I speculate that only a very powerful skilled wizard like Divayth Fyr could do it (someone who can travel Oblivion at will would be skilled at tearing open holes I imagine) and someone that powerful probably wouldn't need to do anything as flashy as that. The guy does have a full set of daedric armor and weapons - he hardly needs to summon any more! Picturing it I can only imagine it as a very dramatic way to assassinate someone. Anyway thanks for another well thought out, well reasoned comment. ( I wasn't expecting the gimp analogy though!)"
teslore,3dbk8j,raikage3320,2,Wed Jul 15 02:42:24 2015 UTC,"Just a guess but when the mage opens a portal for the weapon to come out of, effort might go in to clearing the space for the portal, whether that is transporting/destroying/moving aside the matter that was there already. Doing this with solid objects would require a lot more work than doing the same to thin air."
teslore,3dbwbz,Rosario_Di_Spada,2,Wed Jul 15 01:51:09 2015 UTC,"Nirn doesn't really follow the same geographic rules that Earth does. For example Earth is spherical, Nirn is probably not. In my opinion Nirn is a flat plane that runs infinitely, but mortal minds perceive it as spherical and finite (that's why C0DA depicts Nirn as such). Just like the Divine's planes appear as spherical, its what mortal minds perceive them as. That said Yokuda can't really be Akavir nor can they be close to each other. You sail west of Yokuda you're not going to find Akavir, and vice versa.  However, what you will find is another continent if other continents are past and future Kalpas. So you sail east of Akavir, you'll find a continent that reflects the Kalpa after Akavir. Well actually that's only if you're a part of the Akaviri Kalpa and not the Tamrielic Kalpa. I'm starting to get a bit to metaphysical here. If you want to read more about this then I suggest you check out this exceptionally well done explanation.  To explain how there are Akaviri influences on Yokuda I point to the first Akaviri invasion. This invasion is mentioned very briefly (literally two sentences) in A History of Daggerfall which can be found in Daggerfall. It states that, ""Indeed, the number of people in all areas of the Iliac Bay was halved once in the First Era by the Thrassian Plague, once again by the War of Righteousness, and a third time by the invading Akavari. If Daggerfall had not spent its first thousand years preparing for the battles of the next thousand years, it is indeed conceivable that the Iliac Bay today might be Akavarian."" My point here is that if the Akaviri sailed to High Rock, not to mention the westernmost point of High Rock, then surely they could have also sailed to Yokuda. Maybe their fleet retreated from Daggerfall to Yokuda after this failed invasion. Or maybe they had already established contact with the Yokudans at that point and invaded from Yokuda. Who knows?"

I choose to make this the basis of my speculation only in order to provide a somewhat common ground, but I'm well aware — and I thank you for recalling it — that there are many other possibilities.  Akavir could indeed have invaded by going north (and that's why I suggested a south route as well). I like your take on it."
teslore,3dbwbz,IAmAHornyHobbit,1 point,Wed Jul 15 10:50:05 2015 UTC,"IMHO, Yokuda is a previous kalpa, with the Yokudan Isles being remnants from the LDK, and Akavir is just another continent, not another kalpa or a different Dream (I am of the belief only one Dream exists at a time and the new amaranth would overrwrite Aurbis)"

(If there's explicit mention please source it for me)  Now this may seem self-evident from the example of Red Mountain... but is actually odd because other towers are Mer constructs both in fact and in the general narrative. Falmer didn't build a mountain right, so what exactly did they do? And if not them then what and how?   Course simply leaping for anything that might vaguely fit isn't really arguing from the facts but to them in a misplaced appeal to Occam by tidying things up that can't really be said to go together for an organic reason.   Mine own personal theory is that its the Cave and I've located it! If you follow the river downstream from Ivarstead or Pinepeak Cavern you'll hit a troll and have some fords across the river. Only thing out there is a Wispmother and some ruins with a path down that end. And no markers, you can actually have an empty radar for 360o of all things.   I submit (as pure CHIM willing it to be so) that the Cave is someone in the empty sector north of Pinepeak and south of Hillgrund's Tomb.

MK created a lot of the TES universe we see today and he has been contributing to it frequently since. He's not paid by Bethesda, and he doesn't walk into their studio every day, but he still builds on the series for them. In other words he does work for Bethesda just not in the traditional fashion."

Perhaps Snow-Throat was already deactivated before the game started (which could very well be possible judging by the words of the prophecy), or perhaps the LDB's actions in other quests (such as the civil war or DB) results in it's deactivation.  I do agree, however, that the cave could refer to both the reality of Mundus and the reality of pre-mundus.

TES:Skyrim has Merethic and 1E ruins aplenty but no sign of late 2E towns like Hroldan where there is NOT enough room in the topography for anything but the inn, yet a famous battle was fought there (well predating the development of the Skyrim the game btw)  I could go on and on (ever seen the Arena Imperial palace?) but point is nothing you see is the way things ""really"" are so don't expect adherence in visual depiction beyond anything nessecary for current quests in the game you're playing.

teslore,3db5f9,Rosario_Di_Spada,10,Wed Jul 15 00:53:35 2015 UTC,"Zero-summing is failing to achieve CHIM. I'll quote a great comment I hadn't saved the source at the time :  When you meet the Godhead, you say to him, ""I AM."" This is represented by a positive, in this case the positive number ""1.""  The Godhead, however, is dreaming you. He knows this, as strongly and as certainly as any fact of the universe. He says ""No, you aren't. You're just my dream. You don't exist."" This is a nullification, a negative, and a negative number ""-1.""  The two of you stare each other down. And instantly you recognize the logic of the situation. ""1 + -1 = 0."" You don't exist. The Godhead's assertion and the simple basic Truth of reality proves it. So you become ""0,"" you zero-sum.  Except what if you could somehow deny the basic laws of the universe? What if you could argue with truth itself ? Either through sheer force of will, massive ego, or complete insanity you instead believe, completely, that ""1 + -1 = 1."" A patently false statement. The idea that you exist is just as impossible as basic math.  That is CHIM. The ability to place yourself in an impossible state where you stare your own non-existence in the eye, and yet you persist. It's hard to stay there, because of the incredible will required.  Edit : of course this ""dialogue"" with the Godhead is here for the sake of understanding, I don't think attaining CHIM happens with a literal chat with the Godhead which isn't even self-aware anyway.  Edit 2 : the Wheel is a symbol for the Aurbis, the universe. It has a center — Mundus. But when you cast yourself out of the universe and get to see the Wheel from the side, what do you see ? A ""I"". A symbol of a tower. But this is really far out of my metaphysical knowledge, sorry : this is just what I can recall on the moment."

This is how I've described it in the past:   Basically, zero-summing is what happens when you find yourself experiencing the fundamental unity of everything within the Aurbis, but don't manage to maintain your individuality. Imagine a cloth, and every fold is a person; then, one day, one of the folds extends its perception to all the rest of the cloth, but, because it lacks the fortitude to remain a fold, is pulled flat. That fold is gone.   As for whether Lorkhan zero-summed, no, he did not.  He didn't even attempt CHIM in the first place, at least not to the point where zero-summing was a danger.  Instead, he ""failed so you might know how not to."""

Circular reasoning perhaps but once a thought gets in your mind, that's it. It's like farting in the wind.   Where is the contradiction (or truth or whatever)? Or am I...I don't know."
teslore,3db5f9,Rosario_Di_Spada,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:19:23 2015 UTC,"This is a handy and helpful explanation.  That said, both the term zero-sum and the representative math always bothered me a little.  Winking out of existence does not seem to be the sum of ""I AM"" and ""I AM NOT""; but rather ""I AM NOT"" winning out.  In the ""1 + -1 = 0"" analogy, what is the conceptual difference between -1 and 0?"
teslore,3db5f9,ASAMANNAMMEDNIGEL,2,Wed Jul 15 16:07:56 2015 UTC,"You're right : at this point, the math doesn't make sense, this is just for the sake of explanation. 1 is affirming your existence. -1 is the denial of your existence because everything is a Dream. Again, you're right : ""zero-summing"" is in fact -1 winning, and CHIM is in fact the balance state, the -1 + 1, the 0.  In order to make things make sense, I propose this : ""1 + -1 = 0"" is when your existence (1) is counterbalanced, erased, by the Dream and the existence of nothing (-1). So your existence now amounts to zero, nothing, and you zero-sum. In this way of seeing things, CHIM is now a state of perfect recognition and cohabitation between the two facts : both 1 and -1 are equally true at the same time and there's no need to oppose them. So CHIM would be 1 U -1 or {1 ; -1} (not sure of the exact formulation)."
teslore,3db5f9,ASAMANNAMMEDNIGEL,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:27:54 2015 UTC,"Lorkhan did not zero-sum, nor achieve CHIM. The Divines and the Daedra, and anything of their 'level' of gradience of divinity are incapable, as they are too metaphysical to do so.  Lorkhan saw the world for what it was, he saw the I in the Circle of the Aurbis, and he knew what it meant, but he could not realize its full potential.  So he came up with the Idea of the Mundus/Nirn, willing the Divine into the mundane, so that they might rise higher than the gods that begat them.  Two are known to have done so. Talos, and Vivec."

There's also Niruin, in the Thieves Guild in Riften, telling he lived in a vineyard domain in Valenwood, so the Pact may only be applied in the parts of Valenwood really covered by forests (i.e. the verdant hills bording the ocean in the south are out)."

Skyrim is getting it's ass beat by Tullius, the war would've ended in the intro if it wasn't for Alduin, and the war can only go the Stormcloak way if LDB chooses to be his walking deus ex. Without a full legion, being forced to recruit locally, and maybe a few months into the insurrection, Tullius is already winning and bringing back the peace to Skyrim. If you join the Stormcloaks you're only weakening Skyrim and the Empire. Look at every Stormcloak jarl, and the toadies they set up after they take Legion territory. Really look at them, then ask yourself if they should rule the country."
teslore,3d9omr,Protostorm216,0,Tue Jul 14 19:32:57 2015 UTC,"This isn't true, both are tied in unit numbers and cities controlled with Whiterun  the only not claimed city.

teslore,3d9omr,Protostorm216,1 point,Wed Jul 15 07:33:46 2015 UTC,"Whiterun wasn't loyal until pushed to choose a side. The two major families in the town supported different armies. The Jarl had sent no troops one way or another to help anyone. I am sure that a full force Empire vs Skyrim should win but yes they are having a had time managing and moving their troops due to the Dominion  threat. I also understand an ambush is not all luck but its different then say a normal Battle or military victory. It doesn't prove the empire in Skyrim is stronger it just proves they had good intelligence. Which is also important, but we do not know if executing Ulfric would have ended the war right then. It may have just made the Storm cloaks rally behind a Martyr, but as for what is the best decision I think that is still up in the air. If the empire losses some of its Providences it would have less lengthy boarders to protect which might make it easier to defend Cyrodil. Also I think we have to stop and think what is happening in the dominion there seems to be unrest in Valenwood and could be uprisings there and I do not know whats going on in Elswyr. Also it should be noted that the Thalmor are still dealing with fighting in Hammerfell meaning they are obviously not as strong as they once were. Possibly splitting into  many factions would draw the Thalmor too thin, or  Splitting into many groups could just weaken all the groups and cause to much internal chaos I can not say. I just don't simply think it is so black and white."
teslore,3d9omr,FuckYouJohnW,7,Wed Jul 15 15:56:20 2015 UTC,"I gotta agree with Protostorm here, Ulfric was dumb enough to start a rebellion and walk into an ambush near the start. Not to mention the sorry state of Windhelm under his rule. Overall if the Rebellion were lead by someone less self serving, and less arrogant about their skill, it may have had some footing. However Ulfric challenged an obviously weaker opponent, and one that respected him at that, to a duel to the death. The man talks a big game about his ""honor"" but he could have simply talked Torygg into doing something, rather than walking in and murdering the guy. If Skyrim were to succeed from the Empire, it would have best been done under Torygg. This is very clearly Ulfric abusing the Talos ban to grab power. Maybe out of a sense of guilt, but he is still grabbing power like a child. Not to mention what would happen after he gains control of Skyrim would surely be the Dominion marching in unbound by any political treaty and with no Imperial support."
teslore,3d9omr,XanZayora,3,Thu Jul 16 13:34:34 2015 UTC,"It never backed up Ulfric, never claimed independence from the Empire either, and pretty much stayed as an Imperial hold up until Ulfric attacks. That sounds like the definition of a loyal hold, minus a reluctance to send men out for the war effort.  Only one of those major families has any power, the Greymane's have what? One dude working the Skyforge? Big deal, from their dress to their attitude, Whiterun is a Legion hold. Everything you said sounds like something youd want a united Empire around for, so they can take advantage of possible uprisings in the AD."

teslore,3d9omr,FuckYouJohnW,8,Fri Jul 17 16:02:25 2015 UTC,"An independent Skyrim is far better for the Dominion then an Imperial Skyrim. Divide and conquer. A united Empire would be far stronger than four separate human kingdoms fighting the Dominion each on their own. You could say that they'll ally even if Skyrim goes independent, but this is highly unlikely. Hammerfell and Skyrim wouldn't join with Cyrodiil, the very people they seceded from. Good luck trying to get the Bretons to even work with each other. Hammerfell isn't exactly fond of Skyrim either, and Ulfric is too proud and foolish to accept an alliance. Despite what many would say the Dominion would have little trouble defeating the Nords and invading Skyrim. After all they've had Thalmore Justiciars patrolling it since Ulfric's rebellion began. That's enough time to gain enough information about the terrain to be able to invade.  So in the end it's better to have four kingdoms united willing to work together to beat a common enemy than it is to have four independent realms not willling to work together, each being defeated by the Thalmor until none are left to resist."
teslore,3d9omr,Watosh66,9,Tue Jul 14 20:45:25 2015 UTC,"Despite how often this comes up, it's one of my favorite topics.  I'm going to completely ignore the faults or merits of these two factions when it comes to morality or legality, and focus completely on who is better for fighting the Thalmor.   I personally like to look at it as an imperial versus feudal conflict, because we have real-world examples. One of the strengths that Rome had over opponents was the fact that soldiers were loyal to the state, and not to individuals. Marius later changed that, but it's not applicable to TES, so I won't go into it.   However, if you look at the Stormcloaks, you'll notice a particular weakness. They're running on a feudal system, which you'd see in the celts, or later Medieval nations. The problem here is that the soldiers are loyal to Ulfric, specifically, which makes him a potentially weak link.   If you kill Tulius, the legion fights on. If you kill the Emperor, the legion fights on. If you wipe out the entire imperial government, the legion fights on. There will always be some portion of the very clear command chain left to pick up the pieces. The legion fights for the empire, not for the emperor.   Stability is next.  The empire is quite stable, despite the knock-out punches they've eaten. The Stormcloaks are the only rebellion they're dealing with, and even that only took half a province. Returning things to the status quo would be a lot easier than what the Stormcloaks will be facing.   Ulfric needs to not only take Skyrim, but then stabilize it. He's going to have a lot of damage to repair, and insurrection to put down. However, unlike the empire, he can't just draw in resources from other territories.   Finally, raw military might.   There's a lot to consider here, but the most important thing is logistics, as always. The empire has just one legion fighting off the Stormcloaks, with several more available to them. I wouldn't dare try to put a specific number on it, but we know there are several legions, and that a few are probably giving the Thalmor funny looks across the border.   Ulfric can't even manage to beat one legion, which again shows the weakness of a feudal system. Feudal armies handled small, local threats fairly well, but they just can't match the power of a large and organized state. Ulfric can obviously whip up a pretty sizable force through gravitas alone, but he's never going to match what the imperial conscription system can muster.   In closing, I think the Stormcloaks could probably defend Skyrim, but they could never gather the numbers necessary for beating the Thalmor out in the field. Siding with the Stormcloaks would weaken the empire, which is the only other nation with the logistical capacity to raise armies that big. Honestly though, whoever the Dragonborn sides with is going to win. He or she has the potential to become an unstoppable killing machine that can shout down city walls, bind dragons to their will, and slow time."
teslore,3d9omr,Mantled,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:15:31 2015 UTC,"The dragon born is only such as long as we are the protagonist. After the events of Skyrim come to a close he is as subject to an end as any other persons in TES.   However, I agree for the most part. Asking what's worse for the Dominion is an interesting question, but the question of what's better for Skyrim is easier to answer. A free Skyrim could likely defend itself. But could a Skyrim bound to the empire defend Cyrodil? It isn't as likely, and the defeat of an imperial force in the field by the Dominion would mean a nock out blow. But two separate military entities? The Dominion may likely beat the empire, but then to march on to Skyrim? It would be arduous, and i believe its ultimately beyond their capability."
teslore,3d9omr,juswolf,6,Mon Jul 20 17:26:49 2015 UTC,"I realize you didn't explicitly give this as an option, but I think an independent Skyrim allied with the Empire would be ideal. Ulfric would be perfectly willing to help kill the Thalmor if not more willing than the Empire itself and Skyrim would be far more unified if it was free from the Empire.   Edit: In defense of the possibility of an alliance, I really don't see why it would be so unlikely. Times are desperate. The Thalmor are an ideological enemy to both sides and I doubt Ulfric or any ruler of Skyrim would be foolish enough to let the Thalmor take the Empire without a fight considering what that would obviously lead to. Say what you want to about Skyrim, but it isn't as if they can't use common sense. Such an alliance seems entirely possible and shouldn't be so quickly dismissed."
teslore,3d9omr,-MelonLord-,3,Wed Jul 15 10:30:12 2015 UTC,"This has always been my thought. Politically, it works well because the Empire could just shrug off the treaty which bans Talos worship, yet trade and military aren't put down too much."

teslore,3d9omr,juswolf,3,Wed Jul 15 21:55:18 2015 UTC,"An independent Skyrim would be more unified, making them able to fight the Thalmor more effectively as a result and less susceptible to further rebellions the Empire really can't afford to have. Killing Ulfric would martyr him and leave resentment among the Nords. It would drive home the point that the Empire doesn't care about them and I suspect that would lead to further rebellions or possibly the Stormcloaks turning into a smaller version of the Forsworn in a way ironically enough.   The way they would see it is that the Empire caused them to die in mass for a war where they gained nothing, sold out their gods, and let the Thalmor run free in Skyrim doing horrible things to anyone who worships one of Skyrim's greatest heroes. Ideally this wouldn't result in a rebellion and the Nords would just bide their time, but that isn't the reality of the situation sadly. If the Empire killed Ulfric it would only make things worse in the long run and reinforce and further radicalize the view that ""The empire might have been good for us once, but it isn't now."" I'm not a huge Stormcloak fan, they have their fair share of issues, but overall I think an independent Skyrim would be more stable and, as a result, better equipped to fight the Thalmor."

teslore,3d85db,pike184,3,Wed Jul 15 01:23:00 2015 UTC,"I'm under the impression that Bretons are a special case of cross-breeding because their Nedic ancestors were basically sex slaves to the elves for generations.  So in one-off scenarios (a random Redguard woman reproducing with a random Imperial male always leads to a Redguard child, for example) you don't get many traits from the father.  But after many generations it is possible to end up with a truly ""biracial"" child.  In Nirn, that constitutes a new race.  I think beast races can't reproduce with men or mer, even though they seem to be able to get it on."
teslore,3d85db,ReadyThePies,3,Tue Jul 14 17:07:19 2015 UTC,"Don't know who the author is, but i liked their way of looking at it:    Oh, but of course!  It’s High Rock.  If you can’t kill them, marry them, that’s the motto of Bretons.  In Skyrim, many people can trace their lineage back centuries and they’re not descended from anyone who came from further away than the next hold, but that’s not the case in Daggerfall.  When foreigners come to High Rock, they’re very confused because they see women with snowy, olive, sepia skin and they think, “Oh, I see a Nord, I see an Imperial, I see a Redguard,” but they’re all Bretons.  In Daggerfall, being a Breton is not about what kingdom your ancestors came from.  It’s all about hating the kingdoms you aren’t in now.   Just a thought.  Some Bretons are Manmer, but for others its a choice.  Some Manmer are Bretons and others are not."
teslore,3d85db,Taleta,2,Tue Jul 14 19:37:10 2015 UTC,"While the Breton race is manmer(more mannish than merrish though), if the Bretons are 50/50 than the offspring of two races is more 90/10, less than that probably. Children of interracial couples inherit the mother's race with some trait of the father. It isn't a 50/50 split."
teslore,3d85db,WodinazDeKoos,2,Tue Jul 14 08:37:45 2015 UTC,"The way I work it out is that children always take 3/4 of their ""genetic"" information from their mothers instead of 1/2.   So a Nord and Redguard would either make a somewhat tanner Nord child with curly hair, or a Redguard child with somewhat lighter skin than their mother and slightly less kinky hair."
teslore,3d85db,kingjoe64,4,Fri Jul 17 16:23:27 2015 UTC,"For example, if a Nord and a Bosmer have children, is the child born a Breton?    No, because Breton is a specific nationality. Bretons are humans from High Rock. They have their own accents, their own culture, their own religion, their own history. A High Elf and a Nord making a baby doesn't make a Breton any more than a Spanish person and a Mayan making a baby makes a Latino. The baby will be bi-racial, and in TES will look more like the mother, but he won't magically be born a Breton."
teslore,3d85db,Cyclenophus,2,Tue Jul 14 07:48:51 2015 UTC,Well breton are not a Nationaltheatret. A nord born in high rock is not classefied as a breton. So other than that the race if the child is whatcha mother is with a few minor things from the father
teslore,3d85db,LordElantri,3,Tue Jul 14 14:29:43 2015 UTC,"A Breton is a white person raised in High Rock in accordance with High Rock culture. A Nord is a white person raised in Skyrim in accordance with Skyrim culture. A ""Nord"" born in High Rock could absolutely consider themselves a Breton if they so chose."
teslore,3d85db,ladynerevar,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:32:38 2015 UTC,"The nords in high rock could consider themself a chair, but they would be no more a chair than a breton. They would be nords with a breton culture nothing more.  A Breton is Also called manmer, mostly human but with an extremly low % of elven blood.  Breton and nords are more than just culture. Compare them to dunmer and Altmer both are Elven, but an Altmer raised in morrowind does not become a dunmer. A dunmer raised in aldmeris does not become an altmer. Breton and nords are both human, but a breton raised in Skyrim does not become a nord, and a nord raised in high rock does not become a breton,"
teslore,3d85db,LordElantri,2,Wed Jul 15 10:15:12 2015 UTC,"The comparisons to Elven races don't really hold true, because those cultures revolve so much around bloodlines. We should look at this from the angle of how various cultures in TES identify themselves. The Altmer identity is fundamentally about who your family is, and what your body type is. That's not the fundamental quality that informs the Breton identity, or the Imperial identity. The Redguard and Nord identities are a bit closer to the Merish ones, but still closer to the other human ones.  Being a Breton can be about blood, but only a little bit. If an Imperial family has lived in High Rock for six generations, has intermarried several times with native Bretons, has the accent and wears the clothes, they'd might as well be Bretons. Doesn't work with people trying to be Altmer or Dunmer for the reasons I stated previously. Those races are a LOT about what you look like and who your parents were. Bretons, not so much."
teslore,3d85db,Cyclenophus,0,Wed Jul 15 10:54:32 2015 UTC,"I agree on the part with internaried in high rock 6 times would be pretty mutch as good as a breton, but a nord orphan born from nord parents and just raised in high rock is still a nord.   Remember the child is the race of the mother but can get a few traits from the father. It holds true for elven/human relationships, but it Also holds true from a breton/nord relationship. Is the mother is breton then the kid is breton. If the mother is nord then the kid is nord. What one identify as have nothing to do with this. One can be imperial and think one is a nord but it does not make one a nord."
teslore,3d8hdk,Vazeyaro,10,Tue Jul 14 09:28:46 2015 UTC,"Well, the book doesn't appear in ESO, but even if it did, our only response would be ""anybody's guess"" because some books have time-traveled into ESO.  None of the claims date the book other than ""Once Ada'Soom Dir-Kamal, a king among demons, attempted to conquer Morrowind, but Almalexia and the Underking destroyed him at Red Mountain."" which implies it was a long time ago, not just a few years, and ""When natives of Tamriel think of the Akaviri they think of the Serpent-Folk, because one ruled the Cyrodilic Empire for four hundred years in the previous era."" which implies that the book was written in the Third Era.  The other events, (the eating of the men, the dracochrysalis of Tosh Raka, the Tsaesci enslaving the Red Dragons) could have occurred at any time before the book was written some time in the third era.  TL;DR -- We Just Don't Know."
teslore,3d8hdk,Samphire,2,Tue Jul 14 10:46:58 2015 UTC,"It was supposedly written by Akaviri scribes for some Emperor in the Reman Dynasty. At least, that's the in-universe explanation I'm most familiar with, and I'm sure I have some good reason for believing that. Might have been an old forum dev comment or some interview tucked away at TIL, but I definitely remember reading that.   So yes, before ESO, by a fair clip. The Akaviri advisers for Reman and his successors were from the Tsaesci invasion of the First Era. The second Akaviri invasion ten years before the events of ESO was led by forces from Kamal, a different Akaviri kingdom."
teslore,3d8hdk,Cyclenophus,5,Tue Jul 14 10:45:13 2015 UTC,"Sorry, but the text itself dates itself to the Third Era by saying that Tamriel was ruled by Tsaesci for 400 years in ""the previous era"", placing its writing pretty firmly in the Third Era.  Probably as a reconnaissance document before Uriel V's invasion, if I had to guess."

I made it up one day after awakening from a fever dream and thinking of it, and it seemed both plausible and awesome enough so I frantically wrote it here on an absolutely godawful cell phone keyboard.   https://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/1wjula/you_will_die_by_a_thousand_cuts_unseen_for_i_am/  The crux of the idea is that Sermon 22's enigmatic Treasure Wood Sword refers not to Mephala's Ebony Blade, but to the Dark Brotherhood's Blade of Woe, which is of course also a magical murderous blade made of ebony. Running with that you can sorta see where Vivec-as-Night-Mother comes from.   I don't know if I buy it completely. Most days I think the Night Mother is just Mephala. But it's a fun alternative."

There is an ancient legend among this one's people of the Raj'na - the Khajiit who fought during the Time of Gates. The Raj'na were Thoghatts of the Mane in Rimmen and when the gates opened they drew their blades and flooded in with the battle lust few have ever witnessed - and none survived. There they fought the Daedra in their own realm and were burned by the fires of Dagon.  These Khajiit did not close the gates - they invaded the Prince's realm. They stayed until the Covenant of the Septim cast them from Oblivion. This one tells you not a one had any hair left - it had all been burned from their flesh. The Raj'na were held in great esteem and there are some - we do not speak of it - who will undergo the Raj-purgation that they may enter the realms of the Princes and not fear their fire.

These specialized gut flora are surprisingly sensitive to change; one of the most common causes of death in pet rabbits is ""Gastro-Intestinal stasis"". The bacteria experience a massive die off due to a change in environment, sometimes via sickness, but often due to improper diet. This puts it at odds with the generalized scavenger behavior that the trolls otherwise engage in.  Is it possible that the grass is used as a laxative/digestive aid (in a manner similar to dogs and cats) as opposed to nourishment?"

And Lyranth the Foolkiller:   Second, you make the common mortal error of conflating the craven et'Ada who fled creation to Aetherius with the foolish et'Ada who sacrificed their power to create the Mundus, that theater that serves as their cemetery. But foolish or no, the so-called Divines who created the mortal theater undoubtedly wrought order from chaos through a great act of will, which is a brutal coercion we Daedra must admire.

It appears that the city itself fell into disrepair and ruin after the Dragon War and was must have been scavenged by the locals at certain dark periods in Tamriel's history. I believe that the underground sections of Bromjunaar are but a small section of the once mighty city. The bombastic entrance to the underground sections appear to have been built into the stone itself and not had the surrounding mountains brought down upon it. Certainty if that was the case I would have expected to find very little passage, if such a collapse had occurred.   I hold that large sections of the city that we expect to find above ground have been lost to time, the layout of the underground sections do not seem to contain the necessary infrastructure to be the only livable part of this capital city.  While your theory conjures up fantastic images of retribution done to the evil city, I don't think the evidence supports it. A pity so little information has come down to us from the Dragon War. Perhaps further scholarly research will confirm our idea's one way or the other.  Imperial Scholar Lucius Flavius"
teslore,3d59zb,ddaybones,4,Mon Jul 13 20:09:47 2015 UTC,"Dear Lucius,  First and foremost, I am rather intrigued by your ideas. And I must say that I think your argument about the infrastructural properties of the ruins is as solid as the forehead of the local Nords of Winterhold (which is very solid - to think that the local Nords still think that the College caused the Great Collapse!)  Though I still think that the Tongues would have played a vital element in the besieging and defeating of the Dragon Tongue capital, one way or another (one could imagine that they could have been hugely helpful in defeating Morokei himself).  Your letter inspired me to do further research on the subject, and I too found this little wooden mask. My investigation of Bromjunaar have merely begun, it seems.

teslore,3d70wm,SampsonRay,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:46:04 2015 UTC,"How many Towers are their/what are they called?   Several towers have been identified at the moment.  Ada-Mantia: The place where Convention took place, and as such is the oldest tower.  Red Tower: Red Mountain, but it's Stone was the Heart of Lorkhan, so now it is inactive.  White-Gold: The Imperial City. While it was physically fine during the Oblivion Crisis, the Amulet of Kings was it's stone, therefore it is defunct.  Crystal-Like-Law: In the Summerset isles, but was destroyed during the oblivion Crisis.  Snow-Throat: The Throat of the World presumably. There's a lot of speculation there, so I won't even touch on it, but it is active.  Green-Sap: Graht Oak that resides in Valenwood. I haven't played ESO yet, so I'm not sure what lore has been elaborated on the subject.  Orichalc: Tower in Yokuda. Presumably destroyed with the rest of the continent.  Walk-Brass: The Numidium. Once again, not even going to open that can of nihilistic worms.   Are the Wheels of Lull actual things?   From what I understand, they're something proposed by MK, but I like the idea personally, so to me they're canon.   Does anyone else besides the Thalmor know about them?   Academics and scholars. It's pretty esoteric knowledge to begin with.   Why do the Thalmor want to destroy them?   They believe that destroying the towers will lead to Nirn unraveling, and allow them to return to their Primordial state, where they were immortal. However, this idea in inherently flawed since the Towers don't hold Nirn together.   Was Sotha Sil/Divayth Fyr involved in them?   They both presumably knew very much about the subject, and surely communicated with each other on the matter. Fyr more or less probably stuck to his own business and hobbies that keeps in 5000+ year old elf occupied.  As for Sotha Sil, we have no idea what he was really working in the Clockwork City.   Do any Daedra/Aedra deal with them?   Ada-Mantia is the only Tower that was created by the Aedra. All others are merely copies.   Are the stones that keep the Towers together always physical objects?   The stone for Snow-Throat is said to be a cave. But a short answer is probably no.   Were the Wheels of Lull created by the Aedra, or were the made by mortals?   I'm sure it's implied that the Wheels of Lull are the framework that Magnus used to place Nirn upon.   Does anything control The Towers or the Wheels?   If a people are in close proximity to a tower, they can change the land around them. That's one of the established theories behind why Cyrodill is the way it currently is, versus the endless rain forests it is described as in some texts. Otherwise, not that I would think.   Did the dwemer do anything with them?   Preaching to the choir here. Maybe. Maybe not. They'd definitely be interested in the Wheels of Lull, but whose to say if they fucked around with them.   Why is it not more popular or casual knowledge?   Why does the common person in real life not know more about how the universe works? It's relatively obscure and esoteric knowledge in the Elder Scrolls universe. Even if people knew about it, what would they really do with the information? It's like a dog chasing a car.   And finally why has there been no game/dlc/quest/dialogue (as far as I know) about The Towers or Lull?

They followed Aka into Lorkhan's deal and were very grateful, so they became a servant/scribe/son to Aka, depending on who you ask, and they picked up the tone of cycles. Cyclical things are the sphere of Arkay/Tuwhacca/Xarxes/ja'Khajay IMO: the cycle of life and death, the cycle of the seasons, the cycle of the moons, etc. Ar'kay was a mortal who later achieved apotheosis similarly and merged with that Aedra, giving it a new aspect.  Y'ffre is as you said, the first earthbone, and is about stability. During the chaotic, time-crazy dawn times the most obvious and most needed stability was that of NOWness. People needed a sense of present in order to function as they descended down their personal gradience of power into lesser forms that were incapable of dealing with the craziness. Y'ffre became that stability, he stopped the changes and gave people the ability to live in the present rather than changing through all time in their quirky godly way.  That's my intepretation on the matter."

The Daedric Realms were formed on much the same principle: padomaic powers using aetherial refuse to build their void-territories.   Here we've got a Moth Priest who seems fairly confident that the Daedric realms are built out of magicka/creatia.  But here is the real point:   They really just don't seem to be natural residents of Oblivion.   And this seems valid to me, especially since the Ideal Masters discuss in Battlespire what it was like to be mortal once (or rather, that they don't remember it anymore).  However, I don't think this means they aren't ""Daedric.""  Meridia is exactly what you describe, not a ""natural resident"" of Oblivion, but she is considered Daedric all the same, as are Malacath and Mehrunes Dagon."

Just that the adjective ""Daedric"" is probably broader than is being used here, since we know that not all of Oblivion's denizens are et'Ada who always lived there.  Then again, we also know that some of Oblivion's denizens aren't considered Daedra at all.   The limited imaginations of Mundus’ inhabitants are very amusing. There are as many types of servants as stars in the sky. Daedra, as you call them, are but one of the more useful. The Knights of Order are yet another. My Lord Jyggalag is partial to their lack of creativity and independence.   In the end, I think it's probably just muddled by the use of ""Daedra"" as both a metaphysical category (immortal denizen spirits of Oblivion, not tied to Mundus) and a political distinction (""not our ancestors"").  For my part, I tend to go with the metaphysical distinction, as in, any spirit that lives in Oblivion, can't be killed, and isn't part of Mundus, I'll call a Daedroth or near-enough-as-makes-no-difference, as contrasted with the Aedra, which are part of Mundus, and the Ge, which live in Aetherius.

That leaves a few options:   Sheogorath made them mortal for laughs, or because he felt like it. Someone else  made them mortal. They're from the future of the Tamriel we see. They're from the past or present of the Tamriel we see, tucked away in some hidden or otherwise unportrayed place/time.  (It hadn't occurred to me until just now, but this would include Lyg.) They're from Mundus, but not a version of it that we've seen, which is to say, another kalpa. They're not mortal at all, but simply made to appear mortal for some reason.

teslore,3d3mqe,DuIstalri,19,Mon Jul 13 06:47:24 2015 UTC,"Absolutely depends upon the vampire.  In terms of strength, definitely more powerful and stronger then your average human; loading screens note that Dawnguard weapons have a special property of causing greater harm to vampires, so it isn't just regular steel.  Your run of the mill vampire would probably be basically as powerful as any mortal who has gotten talented with magic, or whatever skillset they use.  But, when you start towards the older vampires, you'd start running into beings powerful enough to threaten entire towns, or even cities, single-handed.  And when you get to Vampire Lords, like Harkon, we are talking a serious powerhouse. Dragonborn are astoundingly powerful for mortal beings, based on Miraak's feats. Over the course of a three day battle with a regular old Tongue (albeit probably the greatest mortal Tongue to have ever lived), Miraak split Solstheim off of Skyrim, possibly by accident, and forced it out to sea. And this wasn't even Miraak at his absolute peak.  Harkon, being the end-boss of Dawnguard, is in theory roughly equal in power to the Dragonborn at the time. While at this stage in the Dragonborn's adventures, assuming the main stories were completed in order of release, the Dragonborn is not yet as powerful as Miraak, but is definitely getting there. I would expect Harkon, acting alone, to be a match for entire armies, if we speak in terms of 'lore', as opposed to gameplay limitations.  As for the strains of vampirism, this doesn't seem to matter too much, with the exception of pure-blooded vampires, like Harkon or Serana. In terms of what happens to their soul, we don't know, but it likely goes to the Daedric Prince responsible for their strain, which in nine cases out of ten would be Molag Bal."

teslore,3d3gy0,Milkpulp,7,Mon Jul 13 05:37:01 2015 UTC,"why would Lorkhan align with Men instead of Dwemer?   ""Men"" is a more after-the-fact description of his followers. His original people were the Wandering Ehlnofey, ancient spirits who evolved over time to become humans. The Old Ehlnofey - those who didn't follow Lorkhan - became the elf races, including the Dwemer.   That being said, He would probably hate the Dwemer, or at least end up their enemy. They aren't just anti-elf or anti-Daedra, they're anti-everything. They are the race who stood up and said NO to Lorkhan's plan for mortals. They created a god to bash his lovely little creation to pieces. The Dwemer are about as anti-Lorkhan as they come."

For some reason I was compelled to thinking Dwemer were the most dynamic of races, and shared some ideas with Lorkhan that reality as it is, is not substantial enough. They were like the mortal Sithis that just cut too deep into everything and found nothing to live for. I feel sad for the Dwemer, denying everything, because the Daedra were overtly manipulative for their own causes and Dwemer knew them as the cosmic horrors they are. The Aedra were just natural law to Dwemer and could be bypassed. They were as orphans in a nightmare with no benevolent guiding force and missed out in learning CHIM by falling into their existential depression. If only someone could've taught them that they were made to usher in the new Amaranth...sadsads"
teslore,3d3gy0,ckorkos,3,Mon Jul 13 17:59:53 2015 UTC,"reality as it is, is not substantial enough   You're completely right. They ask the same question as Lorkhan, but they arrive at a very different answer: destroy what exists, rather than shape it into a path for others to follow.   I feel bad for them too. They're the necessary sacrifice to allow for something greater to occur. That's a shitty role to have, especially when they were the closest of all the races - except maybe the Dunmer - to achieving CHIM first. They understood Lorkhan's plan, but they wanted to break it rather than use it.   Now that I'm thinking about it, it's interesting that the Dunmer and Dwemer seem so completely opposite when they possess very similar knowledge regarding the Wheel. Dunmer, the devoted of the two, have too many pantheons to keep track of, while Dwemer play the rebels and try to break down all of the gods. It's a bit ironic that the two races with the best access to the Heart of Lorkhan and all the power it possesses created opposing ideologies in order to war over it, rather than working together to understand it. Tamriel really is the Arena.   Edit: And yes, I would definitely attribute the pessimism of the Dwemer to the Daedra's meddling. They're probably the main reason the Dunmer and Dwemer ended up hating each other, too."
teslore,3d3gy0,ckorkos,2,Mon Jul 13 18:23:17 2015 UTC,"I think I'd a attribute their hatred of each other to Boethiah and Mephala guiding the Dunmer (most especially the 3 Pre-Tribunal Gods) as they embody the worst aspects of a trust worthy people and conspire to cause war and murder. The Dwemer had already settled Vvardenfell and were busy figuring out the AE then the Velothi came, as the champions of the evil gods the Dwemer hated.  I think the animosity between Dunmer and Dwemer was most definitely sparked by 3 Daedra because the Dwemer refused to worship and so the Daedra sent in the Velothi to exterminate the ""too smart for their own good"" Dwemer. The Dwemer saw through the facade of everything and the universe attacked them for it just as they were on the cusp of overcoming it all."

But that's something you have to decide for yourself.  Interpretation is as we make it.  As others have mentioned, Lorkhan and his followers came first.

It fits into Lore quite good. It neither bending nor ignoring the text. It makes more sense than your way of argumentation that numidium doesn't need a aspect of Lorkhan to function because you refer to a source which contains several discrepancy and is heavily influenced by politics. In addition to that your argumentation has gaps:   1)The numidium doesn't need to be corporal connected with Lorkhan's heart. Like Vivec/Dagoth it can be hundred miles away and still get it's power/energy.   2)You say that the heart was just a sort of transient energy which job was it to activate the numidium. After that the collective dwemer soul would pilot and supplying the numidium with power/engery. But you cant say that this is true because the numidium would be still linked to Lorkhan's heart. The connection between the numidium and Lorkhan's heart doesn't break up after (in your assumption) the collective dwemer soul takes over the control.So you never has a moment when numidium functions and isn't powered by Lorkhan or his aspects.   I don't find [it] aesthetically pleasing   I am okay with it when someone doesn't accept something because he doesn't like it. Just say it. But presenting my theory as ""ignoring the text to the breaking point"" and ""bending"" is something which i cant accept."

In TES:Oblivion, corpses are just, well, summoned. If I had to speculate about Skyrim, I'd say the devs probably just thought headless corpse-minions would be too graphic. I mean, there are no decomposing zombies in Skyrim, none. There's more gruesomeness in ESO then their is in Skyrim. Again, that's an ASSumption on my part.  [Made-Up, More Interesting Answer]: A headless zombie usually takes ritual preparation to reanimate, which is where many of the enemy headless zombies come from. The PC summons their pre-bound corpses directly from the Soul Cairn, a form of necromancy entirely different from the traditional reanimation of the dead."
teslore,3d1ozx,Alveryn,4,Sun Jul 12 23:38:08 2015 UTC,"RE: your point about just summoning undead, it's interesting that every TES game before Skyrim worked in this regard. Even in Morrowind, ""necromancy"" (summoning skeletons, bonewalkers, etc) was functionally identical to summoning Daedra.  Skyrim came along and made Necromancy the actual raising of bodies, but with the Dawnguard DLC, one of the mechanics of the Soul Cairn was finding rare spell tomes that would let you summon undead. Serana comments that ""raising dead bodies is child's play, being able to summon undead is much more potent"".  So it makes me wonder if this really is just a change in gameplay mechanics, or maybe the tomes in the Soulcairn are throwbacks to the older TES games. Maybe Conjuration by the time of the Fourth Era is just harder to do than it used to be. We see the same thing with the likes of Enchanting; where mages used to be able to enchant items on the fly with any number of enchantments their soul gem could fuel, now mages require the aid of a workstation, and only the most skilled of mages can put even two enchantments on a single item.

The 3000-ish years between Miraak and Reman is good and sufficient time, especially as there were probably a number of other ones between them. That's good and sufficient time for beliefs to disseminate. I point you to Mongolian Christianity from IRL history for just one example of the sort of odd turns things can take. Not that I believe it was so straightforward I'm just pointing out there isn't really a ""logical"" need for this to be explained.   Perhaps the real answer is that this sort of thing is unimportant because Akavir is supposed to be mysterious so it doesn't make sense to explain how they know what they know, because then the mystery is gone. Of course a blank canvas like that is fertile grounds for any theory one likes, that's part of the point too its unknown so you can freely put down whatever you like without further complication.  Also I don't know that Miraak is so important in the grand scheme of things, his significance is ultimately subsumed by old Herma Mora's squamous tentacles. He's less the archetypal standard all DB should aspire to, and instead the flawed early prototype that ended in failure."
teslore,3d1w4r,SolomonBlack,2,Mon Jul 13 00:59:03 2015 UTC,"I'd say that Miraak is important in that his failure to fulfill his destiny as Dragonborn allowed for the Prophecy of the Last Dragonborn to come into fruition, and his eventual defeat by the LDB helped create a Dragonborn more powerful than any other before him, and possibly the most powerful being in all of Nirn."
teslore,3d1w4r,TrueAvion,2,Mon Jul 13 02:09:57 2015 UTC,"Well I wouldn't go so far as to say the LDB is the most powerful being on all of Nirn, or even more powerful than Miraak. If you're not counting entities like Talos or Vivec then there are others who are comparable in terms of power. I can think of the Nerevarine off the top of my head, but I'm sure there are others. The Nerevarine may not be as powerful, but I'm sure he's comparable. I mean he fought off Numidium, of all things to fight he fought Numidium. That's basically the robotic equivalent to Alduin while he's eating the world.  In my opinion Miraak might be more powerful than the LDB. I say this because Miraak spent thousands of years held up in Apocrypha doing nothing but studying the Thu'um and plotting his escape. The LDB had been using the Thu'um for a couple of months or maybe a year. Miraak even invented a couple of shouts, including one that has four words and kills Dragons instantly. Not even Dragons have four worded shouts. While the LDB may have been steamrolling over Miraak before Herma Mora took him out, I think it's worthy to not that Mora could have tampered with Miraak before the fight making him weaker. That's not based off anything other than the fact that the LDB destroyed Miraak. It seems unlikely that the LDB so easily defeated him over and over again until Mora finished him off without some help."
teslore,3d1w4r,TrueAvion,2,Mon Jul 13 04:52:05 2015 UTC,"That's why I said possibly ;) Also, I meant most powerful amongst mortals (again, possibly)  And whether the LDB or Miraak is more powerful is, while very debatable, ultimately doesn't matter because the LDB defeated Miraak and absorbed his soul, and with that all of his power.   As I've seen other people on the sub explain it, Dragons are ""divine shards"" of the Aka oversoul. As the Dragonborn consumes more dragon souls, he collects more of these shards, and makes them part of his own. And Miraak was the Holy Grail of dragon souls. Miraak, along with the Aedric power of every dragon he had slain, became part of the LDB."
teslore,3d1w4r,TrueAvion,2,Mon Jul 13 05:07:38 2015 UTC,"Quite true. A post Miraak LDB is extremely powerful. I didn't think of that. Perhaps that's why the LDB couldn't absorb Alduin's soul. Alduin is already a full fledged shard of Aka, well sort of. I might be incorrect in saying that."

Another strange strain is one from Valenwood that does not suck blood, but instead dehinges its jaw to swallow victims whole like a snake, complete with horribly distended throat and stomach as they stretch to fit a full sized human.

In TES, they're more akin to... well... the beast races, in a way. They have a deep, rich culture and history, but most people are ignorant to it and view them as a threat.

I remain unconvinced Sithis is a real thing as the Dark Brotherhood believes because it feels too ""neat"" and easy for TES especially given how relatively new the Dark Brotherhood is.   That said there's any number of oddities around that suggest something is going on. Oblivion had a Shrine of Sithis for example. And of course something is responsible for the Night Mother. That something (I've heard Mephala and Boethiath in disguise considered) might be responsible.   The other idea that comes to mind is that of the Tree Minder martyr actually fueling it himself through his own sacrifice. No other entities actually involved. I don't know of any certain precedent for that sort of thing though to confirm its possible, but seems like it ""should be"" given the nature of things."

Padomay (et al) certainly exists, but my own impression is it is more like say gravity then Zeus. Actively ""doing"" anything except in some very round about ways where its a metaphor for a more impersonal action. And granting a miracle of helping for any reason is very much doing something.   (While simply tapping into a force of entropy is a complicated symbolic dance for a preserving action)"
teslore,3d1w11,redditrules54,4,Mon Jul 13 22:55:49 2015 UTC,You are misunderstanding the argonians relationship with sithis.  Argonians born under the sign of the shadow are hauled off to become shadowscales and work with the dark brotherhood. If the aldmeri dominion were to kill off an entire group of possible shadowscales this would mean less souls for the void.   Sithis wouldn't like that would he?

We had basically nothing about this conflict before. ""Noble Families of Cyrodiil; House Tharn of Nibenay"" shows us that Jagar Tharn's ancestors have been up to dubious stuff all since around 1E 200 and were involved in the Maruhkati Selectives in 1182. In 1E 874 and 907, the invading Ra Gada drive the Orcs from Hammerfell and invade High Rock, respectively. 1E 1029 -- Empress Hestra incorporates High Rock into her Empire. And defeats the ""Grey Host"" of a Vampire King. Basically, she's a badass. 1E 2704 -- Early in his reign, Reman tried to tame the Reachmen 1E 2843 is the specific date of Reman II's death. 2E 406 -- A whole bunch of new stuff from Valenwood's politics that we didn't know is revealed in  ""The Rise of Cormount"" 2E 431 -- the date of the second sacking of Orsinium 2E 467 -- the orcs move into skyrim, but are driven out by ""Hakkvild Yashnag-Slayer"" All the stuff about the Longhouse Emperors and the three factions and their leaders is new The Soulburst The actual events of the game"

For me a lot of ESO's lore is poorly written, dull, and often expands on things in a way that just isn't worth it. But then it adds cool things about Memory, planes of Oblivion, some untold wars. So it's worth looking through to extract the decent stuff. I could say a lot more about ESO's lore if you wish but so far arguments over ""quality of lore and writing"" are something I don't see much here and I have no idea how that would pan out.  ESO certainly adds a lot of lore. As others have mentioned, it adds more books than any other TES game but from my experience it quickly becomes an issue of quantity not meaning quality. In a functional sense, we have no idea if Bethesda is just going to overwrite Zenimax's ESO stuff in their next game (in which case, ESO will just be another dream, another timeline, whatever typical coping mechanism we use for lore). ESO lore is still not discussed anywhere as much as main series lore, for several reasons. Still some decent discussions going on with its lore though when they happen."

teslore,3d09fs,hornwalker,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:23:36 2015 UTC,"Well just from some casual searching of the list I see any number of tomes that are new in Online. There are also books not seen this century and in unmatched numbers, so if you want to find and read these books in a game there's apparently no better place.   As for importance of the texts? I've not found any major completely new revelations but we now we have say texts discussing the Towers (Ex#1, Ex#2) which I believe was only previously available in the apocryphal texts. We also have some fleshing out of events like the Middle Dawn.  And then there's this little gem.  From a lore perspective I would say ESO is decently important. If maybe can't add all that much because the mythos is pretty fleshed out at this point, but it can explore and confirm various things.  Game events might be another matter. Anyways its a bit dicey whether anything you can do in any of the games is how something ""really"" happened (consider the Civil War battles in Skyrim in particular) and this could I'd imagine only be even more so with an MMO. Just the nature of the beast when you have countless ""protagonists"" and a format that will presumably be ongoing for some time yet. Bonus points for being set in the past so there are certain limits at play. That said I don't play online games so I can't judge ESO first hand.   (Wouldn't surprise me if TES VI ignores it even more then usual if only just to give ESO the creative freedom to do anything they want)"

Nope, if you actually read the books about that it's a good improvement. There are debates over it in the in-game books. Lady Cinnabar of Taneth thinks it's White-Gold's controllers having some form of influence over the lay of Cyrodiil due to the metaphysical importance of that particular Tower while Phrastus of Elinhir is the one who gives the ""transcription error"" argument (which Cinnabar says is dumb, like she says about most things Phrastus says)."

Bethesda isn't going to make a TES game that excludes four of the previously playable races.

I believe that once Bethesda runs out of settings on Tamriel its off to Akavir. There are only so many provinces.  I don't think we'll ever see the Sload like we do other races. They'll just make a cameo here and there like in Redguard. If the next game is on Summerset Isles then they'll most definitely show up, but in the same way the Maromer appeared in ESO. Thras wouldn't be an exciting place to visit in my opinion. Visiting a bunch of islands filled with giant slug people might not sell well.  I love to speculate about the Lilmothiit. In my headcanon the Kamal and Tsaeci took the last survivors back to Akavir during the last invasion. In return the Lilmothiit work for the Akaviri, but not as slaves. That's just speculation though. Maybe we'll see them if a future TES game takes place on Akavir."
teslore,3cy2an,Acer132,6,Sat Jul 11 21:22:28 2015 UTC,"I also doubt that we'll get a game set in Thras but maybe we'll see some Sloads in Summerset or Hammerfell. I'm just sick and tired of ""Oh look, here's ONE Dwemer! Oh look, here's ONE Falmer! Oh look, here's ONE Sload! Oh look, here's ONE Kothringi!"" I like your Lilmothiit theory but I highly doubt we'll get a game set in Akavir. It would make no sense for Bethesda to suddenly break the pattern of every game being in Tamriel. Tosh Raka's invasion, on the other hand might make sense. I'd like to see some Asian influence. Katanas like Dragonbane and oriental dragons and such."
teslore,3cy2an,Cyclenophus,4,Sat Jul 11 22:12:27 2015 UTC,"Cloudrest in Summerset is a city built by the Sload. Maybe if TES VI is in Summerset Isles (that would be amazing!) we'll get to see some Sload there and lean a lot more about them. I think we'll see Akavir once Bethesda runs out of places to go to on Tamriel. I mean, you can't really keep doing the same places over and over again. It would also add a lot of new life to the series. A game set on Akavir is like taking the lore that's there and duplicating it."
teslore,3cy2an,CosmicVomit,2,Sat Jul 11 22:41:13 2015 UTC,"I disagree. I think it would start an outrage amongst people who aren't so into Elder Scrolls lore if we just completely changed the game's setting. And like other people are saying, it would ruin the mystery of Akavir and its people. I also think that Bethesda can, in fact, keep doing the same places because there is a lot of interesting lore and different events in each place. We still haven't touched mainland Morrowind and it would be great to see something happen in Argonia, especially with the thousands of islands they have down south."
teslore,3cy2an,herrcollin,1 point,Sun Jul 12 14:57:12 2015 UTC,"We have High Rock, Hammerfell, mainland Morrowind, Black Marsh, Elswyre, Valenwood, and Summerset left. So either Bethesda stops making TES games after this point, or they decide to do Akavir (or they just keep doing the same places over and over). I think Akavir would be a welcome change especially so to those not invested in the lore. I say that because after so many TES games with the same races and setting over and over we all get somewhere new to start. Some people might complain because they can't play their favorite race, but I think most people will enjoy getting some freshness into the franchise after however many TES games were made on Tamriel."
teslore,3cy2an,SolomonBlack,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:57:00 2015 UTC,"I think there's a fine line between getting some freshness and taking everything people know from a series and changing it. The people who aren't so knowledgable about lore will simply think that everything familiar about TES is gone. If you made a game called Akavir and didn't tell them it had to do with TES, they wouldn't know the difference. And again, what makes Akavir so alluring is the fact that it is so mysterious."
teslore,3cy2an,valzilla2000,2,Sun Jul 12 22:57:45 2015 UTC,"We didn't see the Imga in Online for some reason, so I don't know about them.   It's really strange that we don't see any, because it's pretty clear from the cut content that you'd find at least one Imga village in Grahtwood and talk with multiple Imga npc. IMO, they are saving it so they can give the Imga more polish if they come with a dlc region, like Tenmar."

teslore,3cy2an,th30be,6,Sun Jul 12 07:49:53 2015 UTC,"I could never say anything definitively, but after seeing such a variety of locales in Skyrim+DLC (Beyond mainland Skyrim you also saw Blackreach, the Soul Cairn, Solstheim, etc.) I'd wager the next installment in the series will, at some point, send you someplace or have you interact with someone that's not necessarily related to the province (Like Oblivion and the Oblivion realms, or Skyrim and the Soul Cairn ((at least, as far as I know, these places are not exclusive to the locale)))  So, in short, I seriously doubt we wont see at least a minor race included (excluding the Dwemer cause, honestly, their ruins are always present and that's fantastic for me)  Who we'll see is an excellent question. As much as the mystery of the Dwemer disappearance is interesting, I hope they either leave it as a mystery or go full out and let you explore whatever realm they went to. Exploring an Oblivion realm that's merged with Dwemer architecture would be a helluva lot of fun, but overall if they don't want that then I'd prefer it stays a mystery.  Or perhaps they'll go to Hammerfell.  I remember, in Morrowind, some NPC mentions a large portion of the Dwemer left for and settled Hammerfell before the Battle of Red Mountain, and then they disappeared like the rest. Maybe they'll give us a look at some ""different"" Dwemer.  I kind've have a thing for the Dwemer.  Beyond them, I've always been very curious about the Dreugh."

teslore,3cz2te,QuiMoritur,4,Sun Jul 12 02:14:55 2015 UTC,"As best as I could:   -As per the name, can there only be one Triumvirate at one time, or can multiple reiterations of three-man Nightingale cells exist?   Not really stated, but I don't think there would be multiples at one time   -What kind of criteria does Nocturnal typically look for when she creates a Nightingale?   A good thief who is loyal would do   -What kind of powers (outside what was presented in Skyrim) do Nightingales typically possess that are only granted to them because they are part of the Trinity?   I would say enhanced stealth powers, with a bit of dark magic, perhaps even shadow magic if that is possible   -Are there any records of the ""first Nightingales?""   Not that we are aware of   -Is Nocturnal the only entity capable of making or unmaking a Nightingale?   A nightingale yes, since the definition of a nightingale is "" highly skilled thieves dedicated to the service of Nocturnal"", though other entities could be easily capable of granting similar power to followers   -Would Nocturnal see a certain sense of irony in a Nightingale stealing from her, and not condemn him/her to death? (Take Mercer Frey, for example. It wasn't Nocturnal who ever expressed a desire to have him dead, it was Karliah, Brynjolf, and the rest of the Guild.)   Perhaps, perhaps not, to daedric princes, they are but playthings.   -Would a Nightingale be able to use Nocturnal's artifacts in ways that normal people couldn't? (e.g. Messing with the limits of an artifact, or having greater command over Nocturnal's sphere of influence.)   Pretty likely I think   -In the same vein as the previous question, could a Nightingale destroy an artifact of Nocturnal? (Most Daedric Artifacts are difficult to destroy in the same way that the One Ring was difficult to destroy, and even then, it's still going to re-form. Would a Nightingale be able to destroy its form for a longer period of time, or even prevent it from recorporealizing?)   Unlikely, daedric artifacts are notoriously hard to destroy, if you could do it, I don't think being a nightingale matters.   -Can Nightingales ""feel"" and influence luck? That is, can they see the aid that Nocturnal gives them (I think of Nocturnal's ""luck"" like a constant, ever-present flow of energy that's concentrated around the Nightingales or whoever she favors) and manipulate it to suit their needs?   Perhaps, Nocturnal does have many subtle influence in the world, so, it is not inconceivable for nightingales to at least have something in that vein.   -Are Nightingales granted any kind of supernatural longetivity because of their status and place in the Trinity?   Not that we know of, but it hardly matters when you are a nightingale since you being that powerful almost would guarantee you to find a way to elongate your lifespan   -Would it be entirely far-fetched to say that some, if not all, of the holders of the Grey Cowl could have been Nightingales? (Personally, I have a headcanon that Corvus Umbranox was a Nightingale.)   It might be pretty far-fetched, holding the Grey Cowl and submitting to Nocturnal is quite different, and I would say the ritual of becoming a nightingale still needs to be done   -Does Nocturnal place any stipulations on the power she gives the Trinity other than ""when you die, you guard the Sepulchre?""   Well, you are basically dedicated to the services of Nocturnal when you become a nightingale, so I would imagine that is the stipulation.   -Would Nightingales be able to travel easily to the Shade Perilous, the Evergloam, and other realms of Oblivion under Nocturnal's control?   I wouldn't know whether it is easy or not, but it might be easier than most people    -Like Daedric Artifacts, would Nightingales be able to recorporealize if they were destroyed/killed? (See the next question before you jump down my throat about Gallus and Mercer.)   Well, their souls aren't sent to the dreamsleeve, so yeah, perhaps it is possible   -Is it possible that Nightingales can only be truly killed by each other? (Think Gallus being murdered by Mercer Frey, and Mercer eventually being murdered by the LDB.)   Extremely unlikely, since after death, all of them goes to Evergloam regardless of how they die   -Would other Daedric Princes who were opposed to Nocturnal seek to corrupt, capture, or kill her Trinity, or would they see that as starting an all-out war?   Maybe, it is possible, but killing them would just return their soul to Nocturnal, and she is the Ur-Dra, therefore they wouldn't contend for the soul without some seriously good reasons.   -Did Nocturnal ever command her Nightingales to participate in any of the major crises of Tamriel? (e.g. Oblivion Crisis, Planemeld, Warp in the West, etc.)   Not that we know of, there was a involvement with the staff of chaos, but that is not the case. Besides, I don't think Nocturnal gives a damn unless her interests are being threatened, which is quite unlikely.   -Can the title of Nightingale be hereditary (for example, the Nightingale Drayven Indoril passing it down to his daughter, who passed it down to Karliah Indoril)?   I would imagine you have to actually perform the ritual   -Does someone necessarily have to be a thief to be named a Nightingale?   No, but most are thieves   -Does Llewellyn the Nightingale (a bard in TESV Hearthfires) have any relation, large or small, to the Trinity? Could it be argued that he's part of another Trinity?   I think that's just a name.   -Has anyone outside of the ten continental Tamrielic races ever been named a Nightingale?   Not that we know of   -Does Nocturnal purposely associate herself with one Thieves' Guild over the rest (say, the Cyrodiilic one over the Wharf Rats in Anvil), or is she just a general patron of all thieves?   She is just a patron to all thieves   -If a mysterious person (certainly not me, what a silly idea) were to introduce a Garrett-Master-Thief-esque character into Tamriel for roleplaying purposes, would he/she fit the bill for a stereotypical Nightingale?   Yes   -Since Nocturnal is the Ur-Dra and gets first dibs on souls in the hierarchy of Daedric Princes, is she simply a powerful DP or a bit of something else? I know she claims to be either a part of or somehow related to the Void and Sithis, but is there any truth to that, or is that basically just propaganda to make her look more important than she is?   Her ties are most likely political, but we know very little of how it works in oblivion"

TL/DR: The first Nighingale was the decedent of the Crow Mother and a Dunmer. He was sent to Mundus by Nocturnal with the Skeleton Key to unlock the Ebonmere that sealed the portal to Evergloam. After doing this, he married into house Indoril and took the name Drayven. He became a famous thief-bard, and went by the pseudonym, ""The Nightingale."" This is where the order gets its name from. Also, this explains Karliah's eye color, purple, when every other Dunmer's are red."

This interview mentions that the Knights of Order are not Daedra, and it seems unlikely that they're Ge or Aedra.  I would include the spirits Reman and Alessia as well.  And of course all mortal life,which was trapped on Mundus but not incorporated in the way that Aedra were; this would also include ghosts/the denizens of various afterlives.  The dro-M'athra might be Daedra or they might be something else entirely; ESO is purposefully vague on that point, but leans toward something like ""corrupted souls of dead Khajiit.""  The more I think about it, the more examples come to mind!  The key idea is that every being in the Aurbis is a spirit, and there's great variety and malleability in this, and so categories are very hard to pin down as definite things.  Broad strokes, sure, but there are exceptions all over the place.  I would agree that Trinimac is not an et'Ada, though maybe for different reasons than you suspect.  Most Daedra, Aedra, and Ge are et'Ada, simply by virtue of being ""original"" as in, among the first spirits to form.  Then they did various things with respect to Mundus (like being trapped in/creating it, mocking it, and fleeing it) and were split into those categories.  Trinimac, however, is among a class of beings that I would call Aedric aspects, which are distinct from the actual Eight Aedra.  I've explained more about this idea here.  Specifically, I wouldn't call them et'Ada because I see them as having formed after the formation of Mundus, and thus not among the original emergent spirits."

teslore,3cwcmo,QuiMoritur,19,Sat Jul 11 09:26:53 2015 UTC,It depends on the question how you define Godhood. You definitely can say that Tribunal if/when connected to heart of Lorkhan has the same potential of change/power as gods.Does it makes them gods ?. I would say no since their divinity comes not from themselves. They are still mortals ( at least sotha sil and almalexia). Vivec is a other topic.

We're forgetting that human civilization is ten thousand years old, and prehistory dates back several times that long for us. There have been many, many interpretations of what a god is, pretty much since humanity first developed a theory of the afterlife early on.   Some of the more ancient forms of worship revolved entirely around totems, figurines or other fetishes like necklaces or staves. The gods associated with these objects drew their power from them. The god and the object were inseparable. They were thought to be one and the same. The Tribunal easily fit this definition of godhood."

teslore,3cwcmo,ProfessorShnacktime,5,Sat Jul 11 18:46:19 2015 UTC,FAQ covers it in a concise way.
teslore,3cwcmo,Bladelord,2,Sat Jul 11 18:48:22 2015 UTC,"As long as Almalexia and Sotha Sil are using the heart they aren't mortals, once they stop then they're mortal. So I would say all three are gods up until the moment they stopped harnessing the heart which provided them godhood (excluding Vivec). A god is someone who has powers that go above that of normal humans and is worshiped. When Almalexia and Sotha Sil were tapped into the heart they were people who had superhuman abilities and were worshiped by almost all Dunmer."
teslore,3cwcmo,Watosh66,12,Sat Jul 11 19:41:18 2015 UTC,"I would say that they had the same overall potential as gods, but because of a lot of stipulations, they are not.  They relied on the Heart of Lorkhan for their divinity, and as such had to visit it on a regular to make sure that they maintained their level of ""godhood"". The Divines exist no matter what; they don't need to constantly access some well-spring of power to maintain their divinity.  In that sense, even though they have immense power, they are still effectively mortal, and subject to the rules of existence.  Vivec is another thing though, because he had divinity through the HoL, in addition to having achieved CHIM. To me, that puts him at the level of a god, or higher considering the fact that he's a lucid dreamer within a dream.  But yeah, all immesely powerful, yet flawed by their mortality in more than one sense. First being obviousy the fact that they are indeed mortal beings. Another distinction, which really is just my own pet theory, is that the Tribunal shows what happens when mortals, with mortal flaws, gain divinity.  Overall, the Tribunal led Morrowing through a Golden Age, but you always notice cracks in their armor along the way. Eventually they all succumb to their worst personality traits, and everything goes downhill.  I believe Sotha Sil was more saddened by losing access to the HoL, not because it meant losing Divinity, but being unable to finish his works and help his people. His altruism got the better of him, and he hid himself away.  Almalexia went full paranoia on everyone. She probably thought about every possible solution to retain divinity in some sense,, and in her mortal mind she deduced that betraying her people and killing one of her closest friends was the best option.  Vivec, despite having achieved CHIM, and basically Nirvana, still worried for his people, and wanted to help them. But, he knew that they would not love him if they knew the absolute truth of everything, so what oes he do? He creates his Sermons as an attempt to reach out, but as everything with Vivec, everything is hidden behind allegories, double-meanings, and prose. So when his hidden pleas goes unanswered, he simple slips out when no one is looking.  To me, the Tribunal can't be gods, because of their humanity, so to speak, limits them."

Achieving CHIM means that you become aware that you are part of that dream, yet you continue to exist because you keep your individuality.  Achieving CHIM means that you've basically gained the ability to change the dream while from within. This is how Talos retroactively changed Cyrodil from endless rain forests to what it is now."

The Tribunal were certainly gods in the eyes of the Dunmer. Beings of great power and longevity, who ruled over their subjects from on high, existing on a level above the petty politics of mortal life (seemingly abstaining from inter-house politics), instead musing on the abstract intricacies of existence, striving to unlock the secrets of the universe or acting as mother to an entire people and nation.  But, the Tribunal never wholly escaped fundamental elements of mortal existence. Two thirds, at least, were doomed by one crucial element - the inevitability of death. Sotha Sil was murdered by his female peer and later Almalexia, his murderer, met a similar fate at the hands of the Nervarine (Vivec's fate is obscured). Despite all their power and majesty, in the end, Ayem and Seht died violent deaths as mortals.  Only through sapping the power of the Heart of Lorkhan were the Tribunal able to appear divine. But, this was only borrowed divinity rather than true godly transcendence. They never really shed their mortality, only temporarily avoided it.  Some argue that Vivec achieved what the others could not. True godhood through CHIM, but this is fairly up in the air depending on what you believe and what your Nerevarine does at the end of TESIII."

You know how ""Fisher"" and ""Smith"" are fairly common names? (I suppose that depends on where you're from). Well many of those names were given to people that otherwise didn't have surnames, as they were reserved for the elite. Their name was given to them based on what they do.  Now, we had valid reasons to keep those names consistent, but the Argonians may not. So names are kept until they aren't relevant, and maybe they're passed down and the parent's name is still relevant to their offspring.  In any event, it could be as simple as ""This is what I know you by, this is what I'll refer to you as,"" and it sticks. This could also mean that Argonians have different names to different people, which would be fairly likely given the fact that we do despite putting far more emphasis on individuality.

teslore,3cw8d4,Cheesecake_Delight,23,Sat Jul 11 21:54:03 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily an answer, but in the Argonian language of Jel there is no such thing as past or future tense, and speech most resembles thoughts. So, realistically, their names describe them presently, and they don't really feel conscious of previous names they may have had. So Three-Toes doesn't ever think of a time when he was Five-Toes because he isn't Five-Toes, he's Three-Toes."
teslore,3cw8d4,zakii,18,Sat Jul 11 14:14:03 2015 UTC,My language doesn't have past or future tense either. That doesn't mean my entire culture can only think in present terms.

Bear in mind how important the idea of time is and that the Hist which created the Argonians are a CHIM achieved being from another Kalpa, so they especially would have a disregard toward the idea of linear time."
teslore,3cw8d4,zakii,4,Sat Jul 11 15:50:32 2015 UTC,"My culture is also Buddhist. I'm inclined to believe the lack of tense in the language stems from Buddhist thought of the past and future not truly existing in any real way.   That's a very different thing from not recognizing continuity within phenomena / not recognizing the past selves (which are certain not our current selves) as causally connected.   The past isn't real, but all that has ever happened is implicit and manifest in the present moment.   I see what you're saying, but it comes off as basically trying to present a culture as far more alien than it actually is."

Writers of the lore are particularly interested in Dharmic faith, so that philosophy in Buddhism may have been their inspiration for the Aurbical Now. Time in this universe is malleable, both in order and what is (and isn't) real.  Like I said about the Hist, they come from an entirely other existence. The linear time of Nirn and Oblivion is something which is entirely alien to the Hist themselves, and is something they know isn't real (and hence are at big risk of zero-summing, so instead they try to achieve Amaranth). As Argonians are drawn from the Hist, they are definitely alien to the other races in Tamriel, if for no other reason than the fact that they have no connection to the Ehlnofey, unlike Men and Mer, or Daedra, like most other sentient races (ignoring Akavir, which is barely known about)."

teslore,3cw8d4,zakii,17,Sat Jul 11 16:05:24 2015 UTC,"I always figured it isn't their real names. Like the Native Americans had secret birth names and told white people their name was Runs-with-Bison or whatever. Pocahontas ('Playful One') was born Motoaka, for instance, but Chief Powhatan didn't want the English to know her real name. She only told the English her birth name during her baptism into Rebecca Rolfe.   The Argonians likely have birth names in Jel, but in common language use these monikers."
teslore,3cw8d4,animuseternal,8,Sat Jul 11 15:33:05 2015 UTC,"I imagine that Argonians change their names whenever it becomes appropriate - when some life-changing event necessitates a re-evaluation of their identity.  An Argonian's first name change would probably occur either during or shortly following their coming-of-age ceremony, when they first taste the Hist sap... the name given to them by their egg-mother would no longer hold meaning to them, as they become awakened to their role in the greater scheme of things.  Argonian communities would be highly attuned to changes in the names of its members, potentially to the extent of being able to correctly name any individual without the need to be consciously or explicitly told of a new name... many such subtle forms of group consciousness are expected to be observable amongst Hist-bonded Argonian communities."
teslore,3cw8d4,T-Husky,2,Sat Jul 11 18:41:07 2015 UTC,I would say that it is very possible that argonians change their names multiple times during their lifetime due to the nature of their language: the jel. It is said that jel is the closest to pure thought as mortally possible and that there is hardly any emphasis on past or future tense. Considering that lack of tense I would say that an Argonian probably changes his name to whatever his profession or occupation is in a particular time period.   My only source for the jel is the UESP. the rest is conjecture.

Taking that ability away could have interesting effects if ESO's Valenwood lore is any indication.  For example, Snow-Throat is the story of Skryim, Red Mountain the story of Morrowind, etc. If all these stories become concluded, then something odd may happen to the Nirn.  I don't know if that makes any sense, I'm really bad at conveying my thoughts."

This is very interesting. On a meta writing level, Morrowind the Province was destroyed because TES III: Morrowind was a complete work that didn't need further elaboration -- MK requested it.  Because the story of Morrowind is over, Red Mountain is destroyed.   Because Red Mountain is destroyed, the story of Morrowind is over."

I'm getting a lot of different answers, from the Hist Trees to ""Black Marsh doesn't need a tower because Talos.""  Speaking of which, did Talos actually ascend and become a full-blown Divine, did he just die and was canonized post-mortem, or did he pull a Tribunal and steal divinity?"

teslore,3cwksy,Watosh66,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:43:24 2015 UTC,"Only two of the Towers are meant to keep Nirn stable. They are Adamantine and Red Tower. Adamantine was the Tower which initially stabilized Nirn and caused linear time. Red Tower was created so the Divines did not have to remain on Nirn for it to remain stabilized. The other Towers have different purposed than the original two. The Merethic Elves created them to emulate Adamantine or Red but didn't know how the Towers functioned, so their Towers ended up doing different things like focusing Magicka.   Talos is also sort of a Tower because he is the only thing keeping Nirn from falling apart since the Nerevarine disabled Red Tower.  So Black Marsh doesn't need a Tower to remain stable. If a province or region needed a Tower every province except High Rock and maybe Hammerfell would be in a non-linear timeline or simply unstable beyond belief. If Black Marsh does have a Tower the only thing I cold think of it being is the Hist. Maybe the Argonians are its stone. However seeing as the Hist was around since before the current Kalpa or maybe the Aurbis itself I'd say that's unlikely."
teslore,3cwksy,Watosh66,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:53:08 2015 UTC,"After reading a lot of these replies, I'd imagine the Hist would be the local stabilizer for Black Marsh, if it needed one. But how could the Hist exist before the Aurbis? Is it some massive extradimensional entity, represented through the trees?  (And on that note, would the Argonians have a claim to being descended from gods, like the Altmer do?)"
teslore,3cwksy,pike184,0,Sun Jul 12 01:36:48 2015 UTC,"What I meant by they might have existed before the Aurbis is that they might have been from the twelve worlds created by Anu and Nir. That's probably not true, well in my opinion its not, because I don't think there's much credibility to the Anu and Padomay creation myth. This myth comes from before the creation of the Aurbis so there's no way the original telling was corrupted in some way throughout the eras. MK said the Hist are about as close as you can get to aliens in the Aurbis. I think that he means that they've survived from another Kalpa, or perhaps have survived all Kalpas to take shelter in the next. So there were Hist in Yokuda and there will be a Hist in Akavir, unless the Hist is killed on Tamriel. It might be the same Hist that's been travelling through Kalpas or it might not.  The Argonians aren't descended from gods. Hist aren't gods, a Hist is just a very knowledgeable being. The Altmer have a claim as being the descendants of gods, as do all Mer, because the Aldmer were lesser spirits when Convention happened. The Argonians were probably just created by the Hist."

There is a bookseller, so I'd wager there are printing presses in Leyawiin.  As for Bravil, well... there's a reason it's the poorer city. I think they have at least some agriculture, probably a lot of rice."
teslore,3cudam,Rosario_Di_Spada,6,Fri Jul 10 21:46:50 2015 UTC,"Regarding Leyawiin, I'd imagine the proximity to the Tenmar's outer reaches (from the Trans-Niben acquisition) would allow for fruit plantations run by companies in Leyawiin and the Imperial City, exported via the East Empire Company. I say this because of the use of Blackwood bananas in ESO food recipes. Some may make illicit revenue from the Moon Sugar trade (again due to the Trans-Niben acquisition, the soil in the outer Tenmar now considered Cyrodiil is capable of growing Moon Sugar). Leyawiin's port to the Topal and accessway to the Imperial City would make it important for the East Empire Company to conduct business with well, the eastern Empire, and back to Cyrodiil City. Cyrodiilic goods would be exported and other goods imported from bordering provinces.  Anvil would likely trade sugar and rum from plantations and brewers around Stros M'kai and Stirk, in addition to spices and other goods from Hammerfell, Valenwood, and beyond the Cape of the Blue Divide to the Summerset Isles.  Anvil is also likely to have a presence of furriers and hunters of stoats along the Gold Coast, given the ermine motif on the Anvil banner."
teslore,3cudam,Iceflame542,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:09:26 2015 UTC,"Anvil's definitely a big trading town, being the most prominent port city in Cyrodiil and all with the exception of the Imperial City itself. Supposedly, you can get ahold of a lot of items in Anvil that are hard to come by in other parts of the empire. Many of the vessels which dock there set sail to exotic locations, like the Archipelago remaining when Yokuda sank, or to Thras. Thus, it's logical there'd be a higher abundance of rare foreign materials and goods in Anvil than in other places in Colovia. Redguard stuff is common everywhere in Colovia,but genuine Yokudan goods, not so much."

Sutch is a city that appears in Cyrodiil according to lore, and was also a winery.  Bravil still confuses me though, but it does have water access. However, it isn't really doing too Well, is it?"

teslore,3cudam,pike184,3,Fri Jul 10 22:29:05 2015 UTC,"Bravil and Leyawinn are parts of Nibenay. The PG:1 says about Nibenay ""Restrictions against certain kinds of meat-eating, coupled with the sentiments of the blossoming animal cults, soon made agriculture and husbandry nearly impossible. Thus, many of the Eastern Cyrodiils were forced to become merchants, which, over time, allowed the Nibenay Valley to become the wealthiest city-state in the region."" This definitely doesn't hold true as it once did, but it's a guide for looking at Nibenese Economics. Leyawinn is a rich, beautiful town; cultured, with a thriving Mage's Guild and a huge book shop. It has a lot of commerce; notably, Zenithar is the patron Divine of the chapel in Leyawinn. Bravil was probably a settlement sacred to the Nedes for some cultural reason. It doesn't seem to do much in terms of production, though perhaps fishing is their thing. It's a port town, and was likely somewhat wealthier in ancient days."

Whether or not that's the same Bravil I'm unsure, but with that, it likely was just and always has been, a port town. Serving as a stop-off for ships enroute to the Imperial City."
teslore,3cudam,MultiBoomBoomMan,3,Sat Jul 11 06:08:30 2015 UTC,"Chorrol: Probably service or a small produce industry. The fact that the main chapter of the Fighter's Guild is situated there makes me lean more to the former.  Anvil: Like you said, a port town. It has a lot of contact with Hammerfell and the remains of Yokuda, which makes it a good gateway to the Cyrodiilic market.  Kvatch: there is not enough left of the city to make a reasonable guess. Probably something similar to Skingrad?  Skingrad: Again, like you said, an economy based on luxery products. Wine, meat, garments, anything of higher value.  Bruma: Probably a trade centre for Nordic goods. It is possible the Bruma economy revolves around Nordic crafts like smithing and fresh imported fish, but Oblivion doesn't shed much light on it.  Cheydinhall: a gateway for Dunmeri goods. Telvanni bug musk, Dwemer artefacts (how illegal thet may be), Dunmeri books, you name it: it all goes through Cheydinhall into the rest of the Empire.  Leyawiin: Leyawiin is a port town. It controls the mouth of the Niben, and has a land connection to both Elsweyr and Argonia. If ships don't lay there, they probably have to pay a toll to get to the IC.  Bravil: Initially a port town, but pretty much left on its own because of its proximity to the IC and Leyawiin. Nowadays, most of the trade is illegal, being a centre for Skooma and Moonsugar trade due to its proximity to Elsweyr.  Imperial City: Everything. It is a major port town, and due to its good connection to the rest of the province and the Empire, it functions as a nexus of trade and services. Plus, this would be the place most of the taxes end up."

Similarly, the area around Bruma would be fit for mining (if there is anything in the ground there, but again, the games don't show it).

Also, Chorrol is a trade hub connecting Hammerfell to Cyrodiil. Merchant caravans of the Redguards often pass through.

teslore,3cudam,Maering_Bear-Poker,3,Sat Jul 11 12:11:26 2015 UTC,"The Nibenay cities are prosperous in trade due to their locations. The Imperial City and Chedynhal produce the finest silk in Tamriel, includng Ancestor Moth silk. Chedynhal also would have access to the iron rich Valus mountains. Bruma and Chorrol are also likely to produce great deals of raw ore and timber. I wouldn't be suprised if Bruma was a trade hub between Cyrodiil and Skyrim. Bravil is probably overshadowed by Leyawin and the Imperial City, but I'd imagine a trade network still exists between Blackwood and the Weald through Bravil. They may also have a market for alchemical supplies, spices, and dyes. Leyawin also probably has dyes and alchemical supplies. Kvatch and Skingrad are large agricultural resource produces: animals, grains, wines, cloth. Anvil is a great trading port and probably has a decent agricultural base as well."
teslore,3cudam,MultiBoomBoomMan,2,Sat Jul 11 22:43:49 2015 UTC,"Overall, everything has to do with trade and the profit from that alone when nothing blatantly obvious is there, like Skingrad and wine. There's a reason why all Imperials (Colovian or Nibenese alike) are all known for being renown merchants.   Also, heart of the empire, surrounded by each province. Bravil, Leyawinn, and Cheydinal, are the first to mind with not much to them; so the Dunmer, Khajiit, and Argonians likely trade bizarre items for various Imperial goods."
teslore,3cudam,Maven_of_Minecraft,2,Sat Jul 11 06:13:15 2015 UTC,"One thing that is pretty much a given is that nearly each city acts as a trade-hub for the adjacent Province.  -Anvil would [generally] trade mostly with Summerset/ Alinor (depending on the times), but also a lot with Hammerfell. -Kvatch might well trade with Hammerfell. -Sutch [&/or Skingrad] trade with Valenwood. -Chorrol trades with High Rock -Bruma trades with Skyrim -Bravil is inclined to trade [mostly] with Elsweyr. -Leyawiin is inclined to trade with Black Marsh/ Argonia [& southern Elsweyr]. -Cheydinhal trades with Morrowind.  Some things to note: 1) Anvil is a major Port & Naval city. It would be ìmportant for military reasons as well as large shipments. They also should have good cottage industries, fabrics/textiles, & probably wheat/grain production.  2) Kvatch is probably great for [wild] game, animal husbandry, mining, & probably lumber.  3) Skingrad [& Sutch] seem more inclined toward luxury goods often like wines, furs, wool, & fruit.  4) Chorrol would be great for mining, craftsmenship (Ex: smithing), lumber, & possibly contracting jobs (a great example is the Fighter's Guild there).  5) Bruma would be great for Mead & other drinks, animal hides, smithing, & Nordic goods including food products (Cheese, Sweet Rolls/Desserts, & 'Mustardish' {what I call MK & others' Nordic ""Wasabi,"" basically Mustard Horseradish}).  6) Bravil seemed to be a prosperous fishing town & inland Port for some time, but seems to have turned into a smuggling hub. The place teems with underground business, drug & alchemical trade, & Skooma dens. There is more to the area, but this is much of what impacts Bravil.  7) Leyawiin gets many things from Argonia & Elsweyr. Alchemical ingredients, fish, exotic pets, [tree-based] agriculture (fruit), & imports like Argonian ale would be major economic activities. Outside of that, bookmaking, shipping, & military (Naval) operation would also be economic drivers largely from their strategic location at the mouth of the Niben & Topal Bay.  8) Cheydinhal would be the place to get goods & services from Morrowind. Plants, fibers, building materials, & more would come in from resourceful Morrowind. In addition, Ebony would largely pass through as imports & local [iron] mining would occur. Cheydinhal would be a great supplier for war materials & help land-based mobilization.  9) The Imperial City acts as a Nexus of trade, ideologies (Cults & worship[/non-worship] included), & political activity. Many merchants would dream to make ìt big here, & entertainment sich as the Arena is also huge. Anything in the Empire could theoretically find it's way here."

The distinction here are more political, so at the same time he's of the same basic nature are all the et'Ada that spawned the Aedra and Daedra. Ultimately a being of the same order, in a separate category.  Perhaps more substantially to distinguish Magnus he doesn't have say a plane of Oblivion like Daedric princes do. He arguably should have lost something of his power in his limited participation but that's simply speculation on my part.   Magnus is definitely not the highest power, he's not appreciably known to be above his nominal peers the Divines (least as the used to be) and Daedric princes. I'm not sure there's much to indicate he's still interested in mortal affairs at all, or at least it escapes my searches.   The highest power... go read up on CHIM and the Godhead. That is more of a passive thing though, as are Anu and Padomay, for active presences that ""do something"" you don't get higher in formal  cosmology then the Aedra and Daedra."
teslore,3culps,SolomonBlack,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:38:43 2015 UTC,"Another important part of the Magnus is that he does not directly intervene in the affairs of Mundus. The Daedra are very actively involved, and the Aedra often chime in (as with the avatars of Mara and Talos met in Morrowind, and the dragon of Akatosh at the end of Oblivion). The Magna-Ge supposedly only appear during Dragon Breaks."

teslore,3culps,Underkiing,3,Sat Jul 11 05:38:26 2015 UTC,"It depends on your definition of win. Gods can't technically die. Lorkan was split in half but he still has influence in Mundus. Trinimac was devoured then was shat out but still retained a corporeal from. They never 100% died like just poof gone but they have become shadows of their former selves.   Something that many writers use in popular modern fiction is that when there is a god who has their own plane of existence, not unlike the Daedra, then they are most powerful on their specific plane. Elder scrolls is different though because at one point the CoC defeats Jyaglaygg in single combat in the Shivering Isles. Granted Jyaglaygg wasn't at full power because Sheogorath was still around but to restate, a mortal defeated a Daedra but still could not kill him.   Also, when Talos ""died"" he never truly died did he? He more or less ascended. Right? My theory is that depending on where these gods fight will decide the outcome. On Molag's plane Talos might lose but on Nirn he has a better chance of winning and even if they do fight neither will truly die.   Disclaimer: I'm not extremely well versed in the lore though I have been lurking for about a year now. I think I know a lot about the common beliefs of the Et'Ada and the pantheons in general but there are others who have been here longer and know much more than me.

So I do not support this intepretation. Its broadly inconsistent with Tiber Septim and Vivec who at least in theory struggled. I would speculate that while hypothetically one could do anything with CHIM the act of reaching it demands a lot of assertions about your own nature. You scream ""I AM {XYZ}, therefore I AM NOT {QRX}"" at the heart of the world. Doing anything would in this context be a lot like being everything, thus being everything you have no distinct identity. Bang your everything, and thus nothing. Congrats!

Anui-El, and its opposite, Sithis, known in other religions as Anu and Padomay, Akel and Satak, and Anhurr and Fadomai Anui-El self-reflects into all the et'Ada, from Auri-El to Kyne to Magnus to Y'ffre to Mephala to the ancestors of all Men, and Mer. Anui-El does not really exist outside its ""offspring"". || Sithis either takes on the name, or ""gives birth"" to, Lorkhan a.k.a. Shor, Sep, Sheor, and Shezarr   When the creation of mundus is complete, the ""children"" of Anui-El are stratified into categories, and Lorkhan is ""dead"".   The residents of Aetherius: Magnus and his get, the Magna-Ge. They are beyond Mundus, and their only ""influence"" is the radiation of magic, solid change, down to Nirn's surface. The residents of Oblivion: The Daedra Lords and all other species of Daedroth. They have little to no power over Nirn, but have vast agency outside it. The Gift Limbs of Mundus: The Planets. They were weakened to make the Mundus. They have some external agency, and are able to make other realms within themselves, but retain god-like powers over Nirn. The Earth Bones of Nirn: Y'ffre and other unnamed spirits. They ""died"" to make Nirn, giving everything to it. They exert great power over Mundus and nowhere else, but we observe that power as ""natural laws"". Mortal Life: The spirits trapped on Mundus became mortal, and had to learn how to become immortal once more by reproducing, leaving a legacy. They became Life.   So, the truth of it is thus:  Power is only worth something if you can wield it.  The further you get from Mundus, the less power you have over it.  All the children of Anui-El are equally powerful within their own spheres, give or take, but until the advent of CHIM, only the Gift-Limbs could exert enough noticeable power over Mundus to be called ""Gods"" or ""Powers""."

Magnus is a Magne-Ge (not a Daedra), those who ripped open holes to Aetherius to avoid losing all of their power during the creation of Nirn. He is in no way the highest power in the universe.

The King gets toppled by the Rebel, as the Observer watches (and might or might not get maimed as a result).  The Observer also decides who is the King and who is the Rebel, without him nobody could ever really know.  The reason why it is so embedded because Anu and Padomay, according to the Annotated Anuad, take the place of King and Rebel. The Observer in this context is trickier, though many people think it is Nir from the Anuad, and some people think it is Lorkhan who wanders out of the Aurbis to see the world, Anu and Padomay, as it is."

teslore,3cpgqc,Cheydin,5,Thu Jul 9 23:31:37 2015 UTC,"Creation in this case refers to Mundus not the Aurbis. The scrolls are most likely Magnus's work, not Anu's.  In the Gray Cowls case, the scroll itself did not break the curse.  The knowledge that it imparted broke the curse."

teslore,3cpgqc,MareloRyan,8,Fri Jul 10 03:36:47 2015 UTC,"The problem with any glossary project is that plenty of these terms are disputed territory, completely open to interpretation.  Just going down the list, I would heavily disagree with aspects of the definitions given of AE, Aedra, Aetherius, Aurbis, CHIM, Daedra, Daedric Prince, Dreamsleeve, God/Godhead, Magicka, Mundane, Mythopoeism, Nirn, Numidium, Oblivion, Plane, and Towers.  I can also tell you right now that I'll disagree with whatever definition you put in there for mantling!  It will always be far easier and less of a hassle to just explain how we are currently using the terms if someone is confused.  (Also, ""hypnogogic"" is just a misspelling of ""hypnagogic"".  It's not even a TES-specific term.)"
teslore,3cpgqc,MareloRyan,3,Fri Jul 10 00:53:50 2015 UTC,"You're right, exact definitations are quite difficult because the concepts are subject to scholarly interpretations (e.g. Ysmir) and often very vague ... since certitude is for puzzle-box logicians. But if this glossary or even encyclopedia proposal would become a broader community project, I'd propose such a scheme:   Name - short text explaining the essentials (neither one word nor a long uesp article, ideally referring to the existence of different interpretations) - sources / links to further theories - sigil of the scholar who wrote the article."
teslore,3cpgqc,Trials_and_3rrors,2,Fri Jul 10 03:33:20 2015 UTC,"I think you're on the right track with trying to establish a writing convention for the glossary.  In many/most cases a single word or sentence is simply not going to suffice, but an article's worth of text also defeats the purpose of providing an easily accessible reference guide to lore.  To provide a concrete example of how much text and degree of detail we should aim at, I suggest the TESLore glossary be modeled after philosophical glossaries: example.  I think this model is especially fitting to our needs since each of the terms listed in the example can be the subject of its own book because of interpretation, but people have still managed to provide concise definitions for reference.  Links to sources and theories, like you said, would also be quite helpful."
teslore,3cpgqc,sovos_thoughtpan,5,Fri Jul 10 15:37:21 2015 UTC,"Could you go into more detail?  I think many of the terms you mentioned are fairly well defined.  I admit the definitions I threw in are not all the best, but I just wanted to get some in for the time being.  Some I pulled from the wiki, some I pulled from my ass...but I was hoping people more knowledgable than me could help fill in the missing pieces."
teslore,3cpgqc,sovos_thoughtpan,2,Fri Jul 10 03:35:20 2015 UTC,"But, since you asked, I'll give the short version of what I personally disagree with in your definitions so far:   AE - This is a word for identity, for the self.  It's not ""all existence"" except in that all existence can be construed as an identity, if you squint (the point of Amaranth is giving up your own identity to create others).  Each soul is comprised in part of an AE that is their personality, memories, mind.  It's not a universal force that acts on the Aurbis or its occupants. Aedra - Didn't create Mundus.  They, along with Nirn and the Earthbones, are Mundus.  They became it.  Hairsplitting, yes, but important, because the Aedra do not exist at all except as part of Mundus. Aetherius - Aedra don't come from Aetherius in any sense that doesn't apply to the rest of the spirits of the Aurbis, and the Nine Divines is not a list of Aedra.  Talos is neither an Aedroth nor from Aetherius.  Also, it's more than just the source of magicka.  It's the opposite of nothingness, which is to say, it's stuffingness.  More on that part in my reaction to your definition of magicka. Aurbis - First, you've misspelled it.  It's aurbIs, not aurbUs.  Second, it's not in anyone's imagination and Anu is not ""dreaming"" it.  Amaranth is an act of self-transformation.  Anu is the universe; it's only called a Dream as a metaphor.  There is no such thing, for example, as an Amaranth waking up. CHIM - Aurbis, as above, is not actually a dream, and individuality is not an illusion.  It's all real.  And, again, there's no waking up the Amaranth.  The danger of achieving CHIM is zero-sum, and that danger only applies once, and it lies in connecting yourself with the rest of reality, the question being whether you have the force of Will to remain connected and yourself at the same time.  Once you've established that Will, you never lose it.  At no point is it the case that you or anything else is unreal or illusory. Daedra - Not all of them take part in Mundane affairs, and they'd laugh at you if you told them that they have to!  Then probably kill you. Daedric Prince - Princes and their realms are not the same thing.  Their realms are things they have built around themselves, and they occupy them and have great control over them, but they are not identical with their realms. Dreamsleeve - Not a plane.  Not even part of the Aurbis.  Far more than a method of communication.  It's the conceptual space between universes, an infinite river of white noise.  I doubt magicka can travel through it except by translation into another universe. God/Godhead - Godhead and Amaranth are different.  The Godhead is the sum of all Amaranths plus the Dreamsleeve.  It is a word for everything that exists, full stop.  Not an identity or being, and so it doesn't have a mind or imagination. Magicka - Far too simplistic.  Magicka is basically a form of creatia, which is to say, the raw substance of possibility and material being, solid change.  Everything that exists is magic. Mundane - In a TES context, there isn't anything at all that has no magic in it.  This is because matter itself is magic.  ""Mundane"" means of Mundus.  Nothing more.  Mundus is full of and made of magic. Mythopoeism - Only applies to Aedra.  Defines personalities and access to power, but doesn't actually confer power.  The power is already there, pumping magic in through the nine beating Hearts of Mundus (Eight Aedric stars plus the Heart of the World that once was Lorkhan's).  Mythopoeia just describes what Aedric aspects can do with it. Nirn - Wasn't created for mortals, except from Lorkhan's perspective.  Mortality was sprung on them by surprise.  That's why they punished Lorkhan. Numidium - Not powered by the Heart of the World. Oblivion - Not a singular plane, and it's not what Nirn is made of, but rather the region in which Mundus (as well as the other plane(t)s of Oblivion) hangs.  It's basically outer space with different physics. Plane - Can't remember since you seem to have removed what was here. Towers - There are Towers outside of Tamriel, and even allusions to Towers outside of Mundus.  They do not allow it to exist or connect it with the rest of the Aurbis.  They simply confer broad cultural control over local reality and Aedric aspects, and they can be manipulated by individuals for more specific efforts.  The thing that keeps Mundus from collapsing, aside from its own inherent realness and stability as a plane(t), is the unassailable moment in which Convention takes place, created by Adamantia and the Zero Stone.  As Flaminius Auctor says, ""The Mundus is no flimsy tissue of conjecture; the gods wrought well when they made the world, and it is not so easily unmade.""  It's doubtful that it will ever stop existing except by anything but utter brute-force destruction, even if the unassailable moment were somehow undone.   Again, bear in mind that these objections are based on how I see the setting.  I know there are people who agree with most of this, but I also know there are people who would completely disagree and have an entirely different metaphysics to present.  None of us is wrong; we just use the words differently because we interpret the setting differently.  I very much doubt you'll get a glossary at any point that satisfies everyone as accurate and reliable, except by being so general as to be somewhat useless.  After all, as soon as one of us uses our more specific and esoteric definition, we're just going to have to explain what we mean anyway!"

Be careful though, some people might want you write what's essentially an essay on each term as they'll feel you're not giving the true girth of the topic. Ignore those.   I feel like a lot of people have been wanting a clear cut glossary of concepts, notable people, and other things. UESP tends to stray from most out-of-game sources. (It might be cool to define those kinds of terms too since OOG is used sometimes). I also feel like people here might want to keep the lore as an adventure; something with no clear guidelines or starting points, no boundaries/paths set, whatever it needs to be to keep that sense of being a learning experience. While I'm tempted to disagree, it's been pretty good times. However, stuff like ""AE"", ""Chronocules"" and ""Hypnogogic""? Yeah...that needs definition and it needs it bad.

Paarthunax eventually decided Alduin was going too far from what his true purpose was (to wait until it is time, and consume the world to start the next kalpa).   Paarthunax recognised that he alone wouldn't be enough to dislodge Alduin from his ill-gotten rule, so he allied with Kyne, to teach mortals how to Shout, effectively turning humanity into an army under his indirect control; he isn't leading them, but his goal aligns with what they would do the moment they had such power.  Along the way, he befriended some of these humans; he still considers the three long dead humans who defeated Alduin to be some of his closest friends, according to his dialogue. Somewhere along the line he learned of the Way of the Voice, and realised the incredible power that it had. Being a dragon, he is drawn to power, and he sought to Master the Way; and in doing so, became a pacifist. The Way of the Voice both conflicts and supports dragon philosophy; gain incredible power, but don't use it.   Paarthunax then is able to reconcile this post-game; by dominating the remaining dragons, and forcing them to listen to the Way of the Voice. He comes full cycle in this regard; his goal to stop Alduin from dominating mankind is complete, he now dominates his fellow dragons, and mortals can take care of themselves."

My knowledge of the dreamsleeve is a little unclear, but many cyclical religions have consequence built into the idea. In my understanding of the bhuddist and hindu religions, your actions in the current life play a heavy role in scripting the situations you must deal with in the next. The point to all this being life is meant to teach you , at least as I see it. To bring things back to TESlore, in my view Alduin's purpose is indeed to eat the world and it's souls, but also fulfills a secondary purpose in giving the people of Nirn an opportunity to transcend some normal mortal limitations via the way of the voice and forge their own destinies.  That's my take anyways. I don't mean to impose it on any others if it's taken that way."
teslore,3cqifw,Bladelord,4,Fri Jul 10 14:54:39 2015 UTC,"Souls do not seem to be a finite resource. And even Gallus indicates that a souls residence in their Daedric patron's realm isn't permanent, so it's possible they eventually fade back into the Dreamsleeve as well.  Whatever the case, from what we've seen there doesn't seem to be a limit on souls.  I personally think that Mundus is something of a perpetual energy device. Aedra are conceptual entities and impossible to entirely destroy, and Mundus was designed by Lorkhan to constantly draw power from those concepts within it, and use that energy to draw possibility from the Dreamsleeve. It's a soul-engine fueled by the power of indestructible ideas.   As for why...The Mundus is constructed for the purpose of Amaranthe. That's why Lorkhan orchestrated its creation, to discover the truth that he could not. The PURPOSE of mortal life is to achieve CHIM, and from there move on to Amaranth. If you fail, as the overwhelming majority of individuals do, you get reset and try again."
teslore,3cqifw,Lachdonin,2,Fri Jul 10 12:52:35 2015 UTC,"Huh, the whole resetting thing reminds me of buddhist (I think?) reincarnation cycles. Keep retrying, reborn repeatedly, until you succeed in achieving the Enlightenment analogue."
teslore,3cqifw,Bladelord,3,Fri Jul 10 13:36:48 2015 UTC,"That depends on if you like Michael Kirkbride.  To him the point of existence is to allow beings to achieve CHIM.  Mortality is a way for souls to keep trying until they're able to do that without getting bogged down in one experience of life.  It's kind of a buddhist concept actually, except that Buddhism believes all creatures have the same souls and you move up and down a chain of progression toward enlightenment.  I don't think in TES you run the risk of becoming a fly or deer if you don't live a good life - though you do run the risk of giving up your soul to a daedra if you make bad choices."
teslore,3cqifw,Bladelord,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:15:42 2015 UTC,"If you take C0DA to be canon, Mundus exists to give rise to a being who can achieve Amaranth. Everyone else who lives and dies is solely to facilitate this end, which gives everything else meaning as a result."
teslore,3cqifw,jebuswashere,4,Fri Jul 10 15:11:28 2015 UTC,"Varieties of Faith has always indicated that Alduin's purpose was to eat the world. This was expanded in the Seven Fights of the Aldudaga in which the first chapter outright explains Alduin's role and responsibility. This was an out-of-game text but it was supported by the Greybeards in Skyrim, indicating it's probably the 'Official' take on things.  Basically, Alduin eats the world and forces a hard reset, keeping Nirn from spiraling out of control and decaying into entropy. It's generally assume that this failsafe keeps things like Landfall from happening.   For some reason, Alduin didn't do his job this time. When he appears, it's supposed to be chow-time, but... he didn't. I personally don't think this was Alduin's choice, and something is PREVENTING him from doing his job, but that's an interpretive thing. At the end of the day, Alduin dominates by destroying. It's unavoidable and implacable. But for some reason, he ruled this time around, and eventually Paarthy decided enough was enough."

The other dragons look to him and flock to his side at the denouement of the storyline.

That doesn't mean there will never be another Republican President, merely that GWB was the most recent.

Veloth told the Chimer ""Fuck that, Creation is a great opportunity, and these Daedra can show us how to make the most of it!""

teslore,3cone9,ArcaneRedguard,12,Thu Jul 9 18:10:25 2015 UTC,"I don't believe that at all. Shalidor and Azhidal are two of the greatest mages Tamriel's seen, and they were both nords. Tsun even mentions nordic respect for clever men. The Oblivion Crisis, coupled with Aldmeri battle mages are the cause of the recent superstition. But until recently, only the ragada seem to've really had a problem with the arts."
teslore,3cone9,Watosh66,3,Thu Jul 9 18:41:38 2015 UTC,"only the ragada seem to've really had a problem with the arts   They have more of a problem with Conjuration and Illusion, which are not the only magic around. People forget - or just don't know - Crown Prince A'tor had a mage adviser, the Mages Guild was present in Hammerfell, the Redguards tolerate the type of magic to keep their tombs relatively safe from necromancy (see the Ash'abah), and do not bother trying to drive out the mages in the Alik'r (see Wind and Sand)."
teslore,3cone9,ArcaneRedguard,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:02:16 2015 UTC,"yes but shalidor was a long time ago. The Nordic society has lost their respect for magic even Tsum said this   ""The Nords may have forgotten their forefathers' respect for the Clever Craft, but your comrades throng this hall. Here in Shor's house we honor it still""  I'm not saying their aren't cool nordic casters out there I'm just saying their society has been anti magic for some time much like the Redguards of Hammerfell"
teslore,3cone9,Watosh66,7,Fri Jul 10 02:14:15 2015 UTC,"They had ""forgotten their forefathers' respect for Clever Craft"" two hundred years ago, not a thousand. I believe that was mentioned several times in Skyrim. The Oblivion Crisis was what drive the Nordic hate of magic more than anything else. It makes sense too, seeing as the Dremora used magic and such to destroy cities and kill entire families. There are plenty of Nordic mages in ESO. I can't speak for Morrowind or Oblivion though, its been quite a while since I've played them."
teslore,3cone9,ArcaneRedguard,3,Thu Jul 9 19:08:30 2015 UTC,"They had ""forgotten their forefathers' respect for Clever Craft"" two hundred years ago, not a thousand.   This. A Nord mage in the College of Winterhold - as well as other members - explicitly say the Great Collapse caused a great distrust of magic amongs the Nords, which is widespread in Tamriel actually. The Mages Guild throughout Tamriel was disbanded, not just in the 'magic hating' ones.  Anyway, the Colovians view the Nibenese with suspicion because of their magic; magic outside of the temples is largely distrusted by Dunmer [source]; and conjurers have a history of persecution [source].   Besides, you hear Nord guards being accepting of Destruction and Restoration, which are magic. Good luck having a military worth their piss without Destruction and temples worth visiting without Restoration.  Edit:   There are plenty of Nordic mages in ESO   And there are plenty Redguard mages in ESO too, mostly in the High Rock guilds. I also have a head-canon Forebears are generally accepting of magic compared to the Crowns given the former's long history of acceptance of Imperials and Bretons. Anyway, it is sort of - actually is because I said so - hinted at here"
teslore,3cone9,ArcaneRedguard,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:29:57 2015 UTC,"I forgot to mention the Great Collapse, thanks. Still the Nords only didn't trust magic until around that time, I think the Oblivion Crisis planted the seeds for their hatred of it. Such as how the Mages Guild was eradicated as of the early Fourth Era. I think Nords are accepting of Restoration because they can see it brings good things. Destructiuon though... Well just walk up to someone with the fireball spell in your hand and anyone, not just the guards will say something against it.  For the most part it's Conjuration magic, as it always has been in Tamriel.  I haven't played the DC yet, so it's interesting to know that the Forebears accept magic. I hate the Crowns so much..."
teslore,3cone9,IAmAHornyHobbit,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:07:51 2015 UTC,"Destruction magic's fine, just don't go burning down any buildings   What I based that claim on, and what is almost always left in Nord and magic discussions are the court mages who are not driven from town.  And the Oblivion Crisis did do a lot in the hate department. Brelyna explains how most elves left the college afterwards.   it's interesting to know that the Forebears accept magic   That's my interpretation of it, although the pocket guide for ESO claim both hate magic, even though they specified the Crowns in that image linked and have Julianos as a Divine (very brilliant display of consistency and taking things to their logical conclusions) for the Forebears - established pre-ESO.   I find my head-canon better thought out for reasons of arrogance and because it has sensible conclusions."

teslore,3cqo4e,SolomonBlack,13,Fri Jul 10 00:19:24 2015 UTC,"You're thinking about this is brute power terms not metaphysical underpinnings involved. While a plane of Oblivion might be ostensibly similar in scope this is only a superficial resemblance as the internal workings will be vastly different.   Imagine say a small island surrounded by aircraft carriers. Does the surface area of the island versus the carriers make it less permanent? Which would be more difficult, building an island from scratch from the sea floor, or building a big boat?"
teslore,3cqo4e,MareloRyan,8,Fri Jul 10 02:17:22 2015 UTC,Creating a plane(t) isn't what costs so much.  What costs so much is when the plane(t) in question is designed to strip away your agency and make you vulnerable to mythopoeia.
teslore,3cqo4e,Watosh66,5,Fri Jul 10 01:03:00 2015 UTC,"Oblivion and Mundus (where Nirn is) are two very different dimensions. Mundus was once part of Oblivion, but the Aedra and Magne-Ge created Mundus within that space which was Oblivion. Keep in mind that Mundus is not part of Oblivion nor is it a plane of Oblivion as a certain Camoran would claim.   That said creating a plane of Oblivion and creating a Nirn are two very different things. When the Daedra created their planes they didn't create something which would require sacrifice, just their own little world to preside over. In other words it didn't require their whole being to be created, or even part of it. Oblivion works completely differently than Mundus, so creating a plane in Oblvion works differently than creating a planet in Mundus. Nirn required this sacrifice. With Nirn you're creating something out of nothing essentially, and then you fill the void of the nothingness. So the Aedra became the nothing (hence the Earth bones and the Divines). As /u/MareloRyan said, Nirn required its creators to be striped of all their power and being in order to be created."
teslore,3cqo4e,Samphire,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:47:02 2015 UTC,"Before the Mundus, the spirits that would become Aedra did just the same as the spirits that would become the Daedra; they made realms within themselves, never looking outward, only in. Selfish and vain. Unchanging.  When Lorkhan convinced the Aedra to create the Mundus, it was an act of cooperation. Each involved were bound to sacrifice their whole (the earth-bones like Y'ffre) or at least a part (the eight gift-limbs), for nothing worth creating comes at no cost.  When it was over, only the Gift-limbs, the Aedra we know, existed simultaneously as fundamental parts of Nirn and as distinct entities still capable of the inward self-reflection that forges realms."
teslore,3cqo4e,dinwenel,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:54:48 2015 UTC,The Daedra are said to have created their realms within themselves. The Aedra cooperated to make a synthesis of many spirits. Seems to me that the idea here is that creating together requires a lot more sacrifice than creating alone.
teslore,3cqo4e,MareloRyan,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:15:04 2015 UTC,Maybe losing agency was the only way to get the spirits to stably stick together...  Otherwise they'd fly apart in fits of ego?
teslore,3cqjzg,Knightsdawn,17,Thu Jul 9 23:46:28 2015 UTC,Short answer:  No.  Long answer:  Really hard to know all of something that is constantly being added to and modified and reinterpreted to individual taste and through individual and collective effort.  Like asking how many birds are in flight on Earth.   then how do you know if any of the lore is conflicting?   The secret is that lore conflicts all the time and it's not regarded as a problem!

The residents of Tamriel have their own agendas and biases and prejudices, and this comes out in famously conflicting in-game works such as The Biography of Barenziah vs. The Real Barenziah, or A Brief History of the Empire vs. The Arcturian Heresy.  And that's before you get to the actual differences in how lore gets interpreted by we the readers and players.   Now almost certainly Bethesda has an internal guide that says ""ok, this is basically how things work in broad outlines"" for its new employees. But I'd bet it spends a lot of time talking about the need to leave certain things ambiguous so that the lore can naturally continue to develop in its uniquely open way."

It will always seem conspicuous that such major events aren't referenced in later eras, but the developers can hardly reference plots that haven't even been written yet.

It was only once you traveled there once with Serana guiding that your character really knew about the castle and could see it.  Common folk, Thalmor, etc., still wouldn't see or know about the castle, and the Dawnguard also don't know about it until you lead them there (wittingly or unwittingly)."

No seriously Molag's daughter consorts with an atronach so he tortures her for it. it's a quest in morrowind.  But as far as a Daedra consorting with a mortal I find that a bit of a stretch. I mean even the Daedra who actually have a definable gender like the Masken and Dremora look upon mortals with disgust. The Masken and Golden Saints especially as they view men as inferior.  Although! This little tale does remind me of the story of a scholar who managed to win the love of a nymph. He was never heard from again... In a good way though he just ran away with her.

In the tragedy in black a bound Dremora tricked the child who summoned him into breaking the binding and killed and soul bound said child and went searching for the child's mother.  Another thing. I don't think Daedroth in particular have gender. Mos Daedra don't. The three I listed earlier are the few who do. Most Daedra function as aspects of various ideas and concepts. Molag Bal= Domination & Brutality. Hircine= The Hunt. Azura= Destiny and the Twilight. etc. I think the only prince that actively seeks out mortal pleasures is Sanguine because his aspect is passion... Both the good and the bad.

In the Provinces, it's highly unlikely, as they didn't really recognise the legislative or administrative authority of Cyrodiil. Only Skyrim and parts of Highrock were even really members of the Second Empire, and the control was never particularly strong. The other provinces may view it as a  Cyrodiilic Interregnum, but they wouldn't likely call it THE Interregnum.   As for Cyrodiil its self... Again, it doesn't seem likely. Based on the information in The Emperor's Guide, and Abnur Tharn's attitudes, it seems that the educated members of Cyrodiil's society still very much consider it's government intact, despite the lack of Imperial Dynasty. The lower rungs of society do seem to recognise a major breakdown of the central authority of the Second Empire, but they're likely not educated enough to understand what an Interregnum is.

teslore,3clzxi,SolomonBlack,3,Thu Jul 9 05:41:52 2015 UTC,"More to the point, we're talking about a universe where all the possible outcomes of an event can and sometimes do happen simultaneously. We're talking about one where the past is not set in stone, let alone the future.  From that point of view, I think MK's out-of-game commentaries are authoritative, but I'm reluctant to consider them as definitive. Which is to say that he knows what he's talking about, but what he writes could still turn out to be wrong."

My main reasoning behind this is the ""Ancestroscythe"" that the Numidium used on the Altmer. Correct me if I'm wrong, but didn't this erase the idea of Altmer from existence in the past, present, and future? If that's the case, then the fact that we see Altmer in the TES games means that they are not retroactively erased at any point in the future. Meaning that, in the timeline that the games take place in, Landfall does not occur.  Well, that's a bit misleading... I would say it does occur, but in a separate timeline that's split from the ""main"" timeline. So if that's the case, then yes, I would say a Dragonbreak (either a future one or one we know about) has already prevented Landfall.  Or perhaps the very nature of Landfall itself (the permanent sundering of Linear Time) broke itself off of the main timeline. If the very idea of Landfall and C0DA is that, with a permanent Dragonbreak in effect, all possible outcomes can occur, then the very instant Landfall occured, another timeline was created where it also didn't occur."

Their presence in the games doesn't rule out this event in the future of the game timeline for that very reason.  In that case, we'd just be experiencing things ""before"" the Ancestroscythe, just as it had to happen in order for them to be wiped out."

Theoretically, something like a dragonbreak occuring right before Numidium, and when Numidium arrives, it gets caught within some sort of paradox time rift, and sent to another time/place/whatever before it causes damage.  It would have to be extremely epic, last of the TES games because nothing can top it thing, but I can see it now, ""Lets wreck the world up so much we save it""."

The Aedra that have planets, i.e. the ones who didn't give everything to creation, are just as capable of making realms within themselves as daedra lords, that's what the planets are.  Trinimac, having not being tricked into becoming an earth-bone, was there at the Trial of Lorkhan. If you were at Convention, you were a survivor, and could exist outside Nirn  to be clear, Aedra != Earth-bone. Some forgotten Aedra became Earth-bones, but (apart from Y'ffre) the Aedra we know of didn't, only gifting limbs, thus continuing to exist outside Nirn as well as within it, and having realms of their own (planets)"

What I meant is that Malacath is unlike the Aedra in that he isn't comatose or inactive, but is closer in nature and power to the Daedra, key difference being missing fragments of themselves to creation. Of course then we get into debate on the Aedric aspects inactivity, on whether its their nature or a limit of their power. If its nature, then my spiel is pointless as Trinimac's nature was simply changed. If there is a power difference, then there has to be an explanation on Malacath's ""wholeness"", as what I've said in my post, which is basically that other kalpas Trinimacs that were corrupted filled Malacath's missing limbs by mantling or soul stacking, as Princes are unaffected by kalpas."

I tend to think that the Tsaeci were trying to become Dragons by eating them. Or, at least, gain their power by it. When they got to Tamriel, and encountered Reman... They encountered someone who has acheoved their grand goal, a mortal who had the power of a Dragon. They weren't specifically looking for a Dragonborn, but rather trying to BECOME Dragonborn."

Whatever your goal gotta have a world to achieve it, self-preservation writes checks for considerable sums.   That aside seems to me you're assuming a pretty high degree of unity and consistency with regards to Akaviri identity and goals in Tamriel. I personally take everything about Akavir but ""that's where the swords and Blades came from"" as written on water. For example how snake-y the Tsaeci are.  As for any conflict of interest between dragonborn and consuming dragons...well unless dragons were a lot more plentiful then is apparent this idea could not have been as straightforward as every member of the Dragonguard expecting to eat a whole dragon much less more then one. Once you move beyond that toward a more spritual approach of course they revere the Dragonborn, these are clearly the chosen ones who can do what they can only attempt.  Heck to CHIM up my own further submission out of pure speculation... this eating business scans pretty well as a collective walking way to emulate the Dragonborn.

teslore,3cky8q,The_Last_Minority,5,Wed Jul 8 18:44:02 2015 UTC,"First of all, keep in mind that the Thieves Guild as we see it in Skyrim is a Nocturnal Cult. They parrot her propaganda about her being unknowable and the source of all luck. What actually happens is much more explainable. At some point the Thieves Guild of Riften gets their hands on the Skeleton Key and offers it to the patron. Ya know, because they are a Daedric Cult and so safeguard their mistresses treasures. Seriously, her taking over that bunch of morons was brilliant.  Then, Mercer Frey nicks the Skeleton Key and basically spits in her eye. She gets royally pissed and unleashes a tide of bad juju on the TG. Her sphere may be unknowable, but she knows how to ruin thieves just fine. Curses are tricky things, and thieving is delicate work. Brynjolf wasn't entirely wrong; their luck has been shit lately. However, it is because Nocturnal is screwing them over for what they've done. She makes them a little more clumsy, a little louder, makes the things around them a little looser or creakier, makes the guards a bit more alert. Yes, it takes a lot of energy, but she's been betrayed by her cult, and the ur-Daedra has the power to spend when she wants to make a point. Plus, once they are worried and scared, they become more likely to make mistakes. All she has to do is wait. Either Karliah succeeds and Mercer gets his and things go back to the way they should be, or everything continues to go to shit and Mercer eventually gets his and somebody who isn't a dipshit gets the Key. Either way, Nocturnal wins.  The player character basically becomes a champion of Nocturnal, and she gifts them with powers worthy of their station. All of that Nightingale rubbish is just trappings for mortals so they feel special.   And yeah, she gets her stuff stolen all the time. The downside of being the 'unknowable' is that everyone tries to prove something by getting to your secrets. When scholars do it its basically just them mentally masturbating about how they figured out some big dark secret that's probably wrong anyways, but when some oh-so-clever thief keeps nicking your eye or your key or your robe or your fucking underwear, eventually you just get fed up with it."
teslore,3cky8q,The_Last_Minority,2,Wed Jul 8 21:11:37 2015 UTC,"I'm a bit confused. Are you saying the guild gave her the key? The key is of her blood. And that also doesn't explain the fact that without the key the souls of the Nightingale are severed from the evergloam (one of the most boring afterlife's possible)  What I was trying to get at is the purpose of the key is radically different from Oblivion to Skyrim. It's extra powers would be fine if it weren't for the ""we must protect the key!"" nature of the nightingales. Their damned from the moment they strike the bargain because theirs nothing stopping Nocturnal from just taking the key and giving it to some random bloak who does her a favor."
teslore,3cky8q,ArcaneRedguard,5,Wed Jul 8 22:22:03 2015 UTC,"I'm saying that the Thieves Guild and the Nightingales are unreliable narrators.

My theory was that the TG uses the Key as an object of veneration, so its theft was a direct insult to her.  And yeah, the guild are chumps. I don't think it makes the quest bad though, just creates a nice double layer of meaning. They do pretty well for themselves by the end, once they've gotten their patron's blessing back.  And yeah, Nocturnal holds all the cards. That's often the case in Daedra Cults."
teslore,3cky8q,MareloRyan,2,Wed Jul 8 22:32:00 2015 UTC,Ah a fair argument. I was always skeptical when the Dunmer lass says nocturnal doesn't want worshipers. ALL Daedra want worshipers. Even the nice Daedra like Lady Azura can do some damage when pissed off. cough Dunmer! cough yeah it would make a lot of sense.  And I'm not saying I don't like the guild's quest I'm just saying I'm not too keen to sell my soul for some nice armor and some money in exchange for an eternity in a boring ass limbo. Seriously I'd rather become a seeker in Apocrypha!

They came into the Void, and Time began. As Anu and Padomay wandered the Void, the interplay of Light and Darkness created Nir. Both Anu and Padomay were amazed and delighted with her appearance, but she loved Anu, and Padomay retreated from them in bitterness. Nir became pregnant, but before she gave birth, Padomay returned, professing his love for Nir. She told him that she loved only Anu, and Padomay beat her in rage. Anu returned, fought Padomay, and cast him outside Time. Nir gave birth to Creation, but died from her injuries soon after. Anu, grieving, hid himself in the sun and slept. Meanwhile, life sprang up on the twelve worlds of creation and flourished. After many ages, Padomay was able to return to Time. He saw Creation and hated it. He swung his sword, shattering the twelve worlds in their alignment. Anu awoke, and fought Padomay again. The long and furious battle ended with Anu the victor. He cast aside the body of his brother, who he believed was dead, and attempted to save Creation by forming the remnants of the 12 worlds into one -- Nirn, the world of Tamriel. As he was doing so, Padomay struck him through the chest with one last blow. Anu grappled with his brother and pulled them both outside of Time forever. The blood of Padomay became the Daedra. The blood of Anu became the stars. The mingled blood of both became the Aedra (hence their capacity for good and evil, and their greater affinity for earthly affairs than the Daedra, who have no connection to Creation). On the world of Nirn, all was chaos. The only survivors of the twelve worlds of Creation were the Ehlnofey and the Hist. The Ehlnofey are the ancestors of Mer and Men. The Hist are the trees of Argonia. Nirn originally was all land, with interspersed seas, but no oceans.   If you compare both stories with each other you will see that jubal is anu, the numidium is padomay and nirn is nir. In the end of the story the repetition starts from a new. Vivec takes the role of nir, Jubal is still anu. Since anu has a fucked up mind Vivec will die and jubal is going to dream a broken amaranth.

Probably the most generic ones I've come across are smugglers, and even then, in any culture or historical period, there are going to be smugglers. Laws are made to be broken, especially if you want an interesting fictional universe.  As far as Skyrim goes, all of the Civil War-occupied forts don't fill up with soldiers until LDB clears out the bandits first. I would imagine there wasn't much stopping the brigands from taking over to begin with. Naught but the odd bear or random serving lady that never leaves.

There are no generic bandits or highwaymen. And there are some things you can draw from those names. For example, the really long last names of the people you find out in the wilderness that end with ""bibi"" or ""alit"" or others can be categorized as ashlanders based on where they are in the world and their names. If you play through the game for a while, it kinda fills in some info on the people you find and as the player, you can sort of attach a story to each group of people you come across.  Like ""OK, these women are gathered at a campfire, they're extremely hostile, and they use magic on me. Based on what I've learned about this world, they must be mabrigash, or ashlanders, or both."" Then they have a motivation, you know why they're attacking you, and why they're using magic. That's one thing I always felt Morrowind did very well that the other games didn't.

But from an outside perspective, there's no ""present Mundus"" to refer to in the first place, just a continuous series of events, branching and cohering.  Like, think about reading a book; are you forced to see it only one page at a time?  Or can you see all the other pages as well, and examine them at your leisure, regardless of their intended reading order and internal logic?"
teslore,3ckd6p,MareloRyan,3,Wed Jul 8 19:44:18 2015 UTC,"That makes sense. But what about being able to see multiple kalpas? Say, if one of the princes were to try to view and interact with Nirn in the next kalpa, how would it go about doing so? While they are able to view Nirn from multiple points in its timeline, surely they can't interact with kalpas that have already ended, or have yet to begin; the entirety of Nirn exists within one kapla, right? I'd be like you trying to play as character who's save you've already deleted; you remember the events of that character's timeline, but you can't interact or affect him/her because they no longer exist in any tangible medium.  I may be looking at this wrong, I'm fairly new to the subreddit, and I've been having some trouble wrapping my head around the metaphysics of the Aurbis."
teslore,3ckd6p,TrueAvion,2,Wed Jul 8 20:25:18 2015 UTC,"Think of kalpas, from the outside, not as phases of Mundus, one after the other, but rather branches from a central point (that point being Convention).  From the inside it appears that they come one after another, because of causal links between them, and this is the sense in which one can say there's a ""next"" and a ""last"" kalpa.  I've written a bit about this here.  But from the outside, it would appear more like an explosion than a sequence, all the different kalpas happening in parallel.  Maybe this will clarify:  I would define a kalpa as a period of linear time starting at Convention (which is the unassailable real moment from which linear time begins).  The ""turn"" of a kalpa isn't the erasure of that timeline, but rather, its end from the perspective of those moving through it linearly.  They either end with their kalpa or find a way to escape into another kalpa (or outside the system of Mundus entirely).  If they escape into another kalpa, their very presence in that kalpa is what designates it as ""next"" after the one they came from.  That other kalpa also started at Convention, as did all the rest.  As for how a being outside of this branching system of linear time would actually perceive the various branches, I don't think that's something we could possibly say, not being in that position!  Edit:  Just for clarity's sake, I want to point out that /u/Watosh66 is describing their own views, not mine.  I do believe, as discussed above, that Daedra can perceive other kalpas just as clearly as the one that the games take place in."
teslore,3ckd6p,MareloRyan,2,Wed Jul 8 22:52:43 2015 UTC,"The Daedra don't see future or past Kalpas. This is because the Godhead can only remember past Kalpas and is perplexed by future Kalpas (because he hasn't dreamed of them yet). So the Daedra can only remember past Kalpas, and I assume they speculate on the future Kalpa, maybe plan for it or something.  I think of it as looking as three apples on a table. The apple on the left is taken away (Yokuda), the apple in the middle stays whole (Tamriel),  and the apple on the right is cut up into little pieces (Akavir). This is how I see it. To be honest I could be completely wrong. The Daedra are a mystery, as is Oblivion."
teslore,3ckd6p,Watosh66,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:07:54 2015 UTC,What about with regards to Trinimac? From a linear perspective he was an Aedra and now is regarded as Daedra in Malacath. Does Malacath reset to Trinimac at that point?
teslore,3ckd6p,Drewlicious,3,Wed Jul 8 20:39:23 2015 UTC,"That's a tricky case.  I would say that there are many Trinimacs in many kalpas (since he was present at Convention), but only one, the one from this kalpa, became Malacath, and that one is no longer part of Mundus and thus not subject to kalpas.  But another kalpa may well have a version of Trinimac running around."
teslore,3ckd6p,MareloRyan,2,Wed Jul 8 22:37:44 2015 UTC,"No, Trinimac got changed something fierce, and the status of Aedra nd Daedra re somewhat...flexible. He can carve himself a new role in another kalpa or try to regain his status as Trinimac, but he doesn't get a magic reset button."

teslore,3cks0b,Siniroth,4,Wed Jul 8 18:09:56 2015 UTC,"I think he will come back too. Mythic roles are very important in tes, a fact which makes sense in a world where can belief has fhe power to even alter deities. Much as the manifestation of the HoonDing will always make way for the Ra Gada and cannot be stopped whilst fulfilling his mythic role, so too might the World Eater be unstoppable whilst, well, world-eating.

teslore,3cks0b,Vermax,5,Wed Jul 8 19:29:01 2015 UTC,Which makes you wonder what Akatosh is doing to Alduin to ensure he does his job and nothing else. I'm tempting to speculate some sort of temporary lobotomy but I don't think Akatosh would do that.
teslore,3cks0b,sovos_thoughtpan,2,Wed Jul 8 19:50:37 2015 UTC,"There is a school of thought that it was the creation of Akatosh that altered Alduin so he would desire rulership rather than his mythic role. AKA is broken something terrible, who knows what's going on up there."
teslore,3cks0b,The_Last_Minority,2,Wed Jul 8 21:27:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's definitely a theory I liked but at the same time Akatosh seems to have enough sense to help Martin out and send a Dragonborn to counter Alduin when needed. And now it's being stated this is the LAST Dragonborn, as in Akatosh is yet again aware enough to ensure Alduin will do his job. Or perhaps Akatosh knows Landfall is coming. There seems to be some sanity and awareness going on, but who knows? Akatosh is part of the same mess that decide to give all dragons an urge to conquer, which contradicts what he wanted Alduin to do in the first place."
teslore,3cks0b,sovos_thoughtpan,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:37:00 2015 UTC,"Well, Akatosh is not AKA. Akatosh is solidly pro-existence due to the Selection, while AKA (or Borhamu, to use Paarthurnax's word) is neutral at best. It is possible Akatosh intervenes and sends Dragonborns, on top of his very existence changing Alduin and interfering with AKA's eventual plans for world-eating."
teslore,3cks0b,The_Last_Minority,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:48:43 2015 UTC,"Oh, I know. I probably worded it badly. I was implying that Akatosh suffers instability as well from AKA(who I referred to as ""the same mess""). For the most part, there seems to be a system that the shards of Aka are at least nodding to and Akatosh seems to have come to some solid conclusion on what's going to happen next despite how unstable everything is up there. He seems to be in charge of the Dragonborn business and he's always helping mortals adjust to some cosmic strife.  I was also under the impression he wasn't too much against Alduin's fundamental purpose since another theory states that Lorkhan's involvement in the whole thing may have led to Alduin's role as a world eater, which may help give more opportunities for mortals to achieve realization as well as help stabilize things. Right now there's a lot of varying theories on the whole Aka business and exactly what each part of Aka ultimately intends. I felt Akatosh was more aligned with Lorkhan so if Lorkhan did indeed support the idea of multiple kalpas, Akatosh would too. Whether or not he's to blame for Alduin's change, I don't know. He waited a long time to introduce an attempted solution to Alduin's greed via Miraak. It sounds like Akatosh stepped in only when it was clear the world wasn't going to be eaten (something which might have happened soon since this kalpa was supposed to end long ago.)"
teslore,3cks0b,sovos_thoughtpan,2,Wed Jul 8 22:19:57 2015 UTC,Agreed. I enjoy the idea that the parts of AKA are in conflict with each other. Schizophrenic Time Dragon indeed.
teslore,3cks0b,The_Last_Minority,6,Wed Jul 8 22:24:52 2015 UTC,"I hate this theory.  There is no evidence whatsoever to suggest that Alduin as seen in Skyrim is not the World-Eater. Paarthurnax explicitly states that the threat in question is the end of the kalpa, and indeed this is the crux of his argument that stopping Alduin might not be a good thing.  You can't stop the World-Eater, true, unless you happen to be the Last Dragonborn, driven by prophecy, in which case you are in a sense his kryptonite."
teslore,3cks0b,LogicDragon,3,Wed Jul 8 20:41:17 2015 UTC,"I disagree, sort of.  Paarthurnax and the Greybeards believe that he has returned to eat the world, but that isn't what he is doing. Once again, he is looking to rule. So, he is infinitely weaker than when he is performing he mythically appropriate role. If he decided in the middle of the Main Quest to start eating the world, we would be fucked. However, he doesn't, but continues with his previous plan to rule rather than consume. I have my theories on why this happens, but the crux of it is that he is acting against his role, and can be defeated. We don't consume Alduin's soul because it is above our own. When he decided to rule he crippled himself to achieve that, but all his defeat means is that he returns to AKA for now. He still has a role to play."
teslore,3cks0b,The_Last_Minority,2,Wed Jul 8 21:17:41 2015 UTC,"Alduin is the World-Eater, but in Skyrim he is not eating the world, which is why you're able to defeat him at all. He's resisting his nature, like how Mehrunes Dagon is the ultimate destroyer, but if he tried to create anything it would be doomed to fail. Alduin isn't meant to rule the world, he's meant to obliterate it and the Aldudagga makes it pretty clear that NOTHING can stop Alduin once he decides to end a kalpa. He EATS the WORLD, and only the Towers can remain.   Actually that last part is an assumption on my part. In the Aldudagga, the top of Snow-Throat and Red Mountain are stated to be the only parts of the world left when Alduin is done, but that Lorkhan had secretly been ""hiding"" parts of the world to bring into the next Kalpa. Possibly, these were the artificial towers, such as White Gold and Walk-Brass, which strengthened Nirn's connection to Mundus, and made it progressively more difficult for Alduin to consume with each passing kalpa. (I believe Kirkbride likened the towers to pins keeping a map up on a wall. The more pins, the more secure the map, take away too many though...)  Thus, perhaps the change in Alduin's actions may be a result of the Thalmor's systematic dismantling of towers. Maybe he feels that eating the world now would not be ""filling enough""? Maybe he acts out of some sort of warped benevolence, trying to defend Snow-Throat tower by claiming total dominance over it. I'm not sure, and frankly Alduin's motivations are some of the most frustrating parts of the lore for me, because I refuse to believe he was just an asshole who decided to rule the world one day."
teslore,3cks0b,Narokkurai,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:09:48 2015 UTC,I was going to point out in reference to the Thalmor thing that Alduin is doing what he did back in the Merethic so if its twisting it went back through time...  But I had the more interesting thought to add to this that Alduin is actually doing the opposite of World-Eating in the 4E. Because what's he doing? He's going around ressurecting the dead to set up his dominion over everything. He's world building a draconic empire.   So no wonder at all he's so weak.
teslore,3cks0b,SolomonBlack,2,Thu Jul 9 06:49:34 2015 UTC,"Eh, I disagree with that simply because the Alduin we see in the games does not try to eat the world. Paarthurnax can say whatever he wants, but the point is, Alduin was trying to subjugate the world, not end it. If he's not eating the world, then he's not the world-eater. If the Alduin we see truly was the world-eater, then he would've eaten the world back in the Merethic Era, and the ""Dragon Cult"" would never have even been a thing.  Alduin was ignoring his primary responsibilities in favor of having a go at this ""ruling"" and ""subjugation"" thing, and so Akatosh sent some Dragonborns to slap some sense into Alduin. Once ""Alduin the World-Subjugater"" was finally dealt with, there's no more need for Dragonborns. Hence, the one that finally finishes Alduin is the Last one."
teslore,3cks0b,JaxMed,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:46:43 2015 UTC,Two lines from Paarthurnax in the epilogue   Alduin had flown far from the path of right action in his pahlok- the arrogance of his power.  His doom was written when he claimed for himself the lordship that properly belongs to Bormahu - our father Akatosh.   Definitely looks like he was trying to rule rather than end the world.
teslore,3cks0b,PowerPlatypus,11,Fri Jul 10 15:10:43 2015 UTC,"I was always under the impression that 'last' in this context meant 'latest' or 'most recent.' As in, s/he is the last Dragonborn in recorded history up to that point.  There may be some hints that it's the end of the line, but it doesn't seem logical to me. Before the Last Dragonborn, the last Dragonborn was Martin Septim, who was an illegitimate son of Uriel. I find it hard to believe that, across two dynasties, beginning in the First Era.. that every illegitimate child across those many many centuries, from everyone in that bloodline was accounted for and assassinated in the Third Era. Simply doesn't add up, imo."
teslore,3cks0b,animuseternal,9,Wed Jul 8 19:22:58 2015 UTC,"Being a Dragonborn has nothing to do with genes, it's a blessing from Akatosh."

If a curse can be passed down, a blessing should Also be able to be passed down. That Also fit with what Tod howard said about us being from a forgoten line of dragonborns.

teslore,3cks0b,LordElantri,1 point,Thu Jul 9 07:38:01 2015 UTC,"My Dragonborn was an Argonian, it's impossible for him to have been related to the Septims. There is no known genetic ancestry between Miraak, Alessia, and the Septims.    The LDB is the last because of two reasons. The first is that mortals wrote in the prophecies that Alduin's return would be accompanied by the Last Dragonborn, so the force of mythopoiea manipulated Akatosh into making it so, the Last Dragonborn accompanied Alduin. Secondly, there is no need for further Dragonborns as the Amulet of Kings is gone, and Alduin has no longer strayed from his mythic role as the world eater, so Akatosh will create no more Dragonborns."
teslore,3cks0b,RideTheLine,0,Thu Jul 9 07:49:08 2015 UTC,"Well, i like the idea of it both being a blessing and hierretary. Somewhere it have to start, with a blessing.

Remember that because one thing is true does not mean the other is wrong. ^"
teslore,3cks0b,LordElantri,0,Thu Jul 9 21:05:56 2015 UTC,"Why would Akatosh make it both? That seems pointless.    The point of creating Dragonborns was that they serve a purpose, which was usually to wear the Amulet of Kings. If an Emperor had 5 sons, they wouldn't all be Dragonborn, because only one would likely go on to be Emperor. Even Mankar Razored himself into being a Dragonborn so he could wear the Amulet. The LDB was a special case where Alduin needed to be reminded of his purpose, and that's what makes him/her the Last Dragonborn, the Amulet of Kings is gone and Alduin was defeated, there is no further need for Dovahkiin."

Maybe even setting u on the path to dracochrystalis  https://www.reddit.com/r/GodheadModel/wiki/dracochrysalis And sutch changes as they are so big could quite possible affect the decendants of said person maybe latent untill they do something of note like getting the amulet of kings around your neak or kill a dragon or something similar."

teslore,3cks0b,RideTheLine,0,Thu Jul 9 22:49:09 2015 UTC,"As i just said. Because a person who becomes dragonborn goes thru so drastic changes that it could easily be one of the sideeffects.  As for the two if them contradict eachother. I disagree, i think they fulfill eachother. The book itself states: ""But we know for certain that the early Cyrodilic rulers were not all related. There is also no evidence that Reman Cyrodiil was descended from Alessia""  it does not take in acount that there might be other lines put there that might be dragonborn without knowing it, and one of these lines claimed to be Septims too and proven it. It says because it was broken several times therefor it shurly cant be hereditary.  And we cant take the book for gospel ether as alessia is not the forst dragonborn but miraak is. So we cant already see that the book is wrong at some points, so why not others."
teslore,3cks0b,LordElantri,0,Thu Jul 9 23:11:36 2015 UTC,"But your protests of possible side-effects and lost bloodlines are unfounded. We don't have any texts that say becoming a Dragonborn can transfer into your children, nor is there evidence of the LDB being related to previous ones, especially considering the LDB can be an Argonian, and thus unrelated to previously documented Dragonborn.    That very book also seems to be a big Chekhov's Gun, and the granting of Dragonborn status can be easily deduced as a result of Mythopoiea."

And I don't believe anyone says that Tiber Septim was the previous Dragonborn.  Just that he was the last person called by the Greybeards.  I've got my position on this question in detail here.

I don't think this means the Last Dragonborn has a right to the throne, though.

teslore,3cks0b,UnknownDaedra,2,Thu Jul 9 16:45:51 2015 UTC,"What makes the last dragon born special is that he permanently stops the return of alduin.   The Dragon born is able to absorb the soul of the Dragon essentially wiping that specific dragon from existence and that is exactly what the last dragon born did to alduin.   When alduin was first banished from mundus, he was set adrift on the currents of time NOT killed because he was too powerful to be defeated even in his mortal form as rendered by the Dragonrend shout. . He was very much alive on his journey and did not come back from the dead as many of the nords of skyrim believe that he did.   As for the dragons that he raised from the dead during his return, they were defeated but not rendered nonexistent as their immortal souls were still alive even though their bodies were dormant and buried.   The last dragon born rendered alduin mortal AND absorbed/destroyed his immortal soul so that he can never return again.   The reason that the last dragon born is the last is a matter of debate but my theory is that they are no longer needed to defend the world against alduin. I believe that the dragonborns were sent to mundus to defend the world again his return since no one not even the daedra and aedra knew when he would return as he was cast adrift through the use of an elder scroll(a fragment of the dream itself making it above the power of even the divines). The dragonborns were existent for so long so that there would always be someone able to defeat him upon his inevitable return.

A snippet from the UESP wiki's article on the skyrim quest ""dragonslayer"" I believe the specific in game objective is to ""put an end to the world eater""   While the last dragon born may not absorb the soul into himself he does destroy the soul.   So if the UESP is correct (which I assume it to be as its my source of lore outside of the games.) alduin is ended and there is no chance of his return making a dovahkin irrelevant because without alduin the dov will never return to tamrielic barring some ridiculous event that someone way cooler and more imaginative than me would have to make up.   This is just my theory.

In that case, presumably the Staff of Magnus being needed to control it is more or less a co-incidence and the Augur called the orb the ""Eye of Magnus"" simply because he foresaw that the staff would be instrumental in resolving the crisis.

She was originally a mining droid built to extract some equivalent of Vespene Gas from the plane(t) of Kynareth, who was struck by a wayward blast in a battle between the Hist and the servants of Akatosh. Because this sector of space was so war-torn, the normal fabric of space-time was particularly weak, and KINUMNE got kicked into the first era. The original text doesn't state that she escaped and became queen of the Aldmeri, but the completed comic posted on Kirkbride's website does. Who knows if the original quest designer knew of Kirkbride's revision, or if they ever intended it to be related at all. Saarthal was a fairly significant location in the 1st Era. As it stands, I'd be willing to believe The Eye of Magnus is not KINMUNE, but the machine Ysgramor created to imprison her. He was a fucking dragon after all, apparently."

Furthermore the narrative creates a discrepancy because the game presents the Nords finding the orb in Saarthal already there, while the Ayrenn narrative puts it well into Ysgrammor's reign so ostensibly after the Night of Tears and following Falmer war.   One can squirm around these of course by adding caveats and complications but the primary argument for this theory is the nominal simplicity of not needing two mysterious artifacts in the ruins of Saarthal.  Further shenanigans needing explanation in this theory include if actually Dwemercraft why is it marked in unknown writing and no brass like in the pdf? Why the specific nature of the Mzulft results showing only the Eye and Staff? If its say just the prison because the occupant has long fled why does it have such power? Even if one doesn't take Ancano's threats seriously. If she's there why no communication despite being established she could at that point?  And its rather bad form to have the whole questline be essentially lying to the players since it would have been simple to fix... call the Eye of Magnus anything else.

It could have been plausibly discovered in Saarthal and then used to imprison KINMUNE. Actually, in many ways I find that more plausible than them creating a suitable containment device, considering what it needed to restrain.  However, If we assume that the device by itself is not a source of enormous power, then it does still leave the question as to what is inside generating all that mana.    I think I'm tending towards some more temporal shenanigans. Maybe releasing KINMUNE and sending her back in time to fulfill her role as Queen Ayrenn was the Psyjiic's way of neutralizing the Eye.

It requires opening a new contradiction in the description as dwemercraft from MK... to resolve why it doesn't match dwemercraft styles. That ""works"" but it lacks simplicity and once you start picking an choosing the false information you have an unfalsifiable argument. KINMUNE wasn't in Saarthal, that's the misinformation!  What is the real core argument for this theory? Well KINMUNE was in Saarthal... hahahah its obvious now isn't it! The thrust of this is that it doesn't require us to have two mysterious artifacts and tidies things up nicely.  Except consider the bias that goes along with that. We consider Saarthal a not-particularly-large ruin because that's the dungeon we dove into. But the reality is that is was (when these events took place) a city. Now cities well compare to Bromjunaar which has multiple dungeons of what only distant relation? How about the Blackreach complex? There could well be more to Saarthal its all just presently iced over. Heck what did the Eye have to do with that weird room with all the sarcophogi, apparently nothing, it also apparently had a later unrelated addition with the Gauldur son for a boss.   But back to Saarthal as a city, compare it too modern Skyrim cities. What are the odds that a city in Skyrim would have Dwemer ruins, political socio-economic intrigue, Thalmor inquisiton, and two separate Daedric artifacts with active princely connection but no actually interlocking schemes? Actually... pretty damn good right? And that's not the only case, locations often have lots of stuff going on that other then maybe some general themes don't have any connection to one another.   I like this theory, its kinda fun and KINMUNE has a certain appeal that say the other robot from the future doesn't, its sounds like the sort of reference the creators might well do, just in the end I have to conclude it factually doesn't pass muster. It wants to be a clean simplifying explanation... but introduces problems to get to that goal. Contradictory that."

There are very few recorded instances of people born with both testes and ovaries. You may be thinking of people who are intersex: born with a configuration of genitals that does not place them in strictly the male or female binaries. Just FYI. Hermaphroditism is an inexact and sometimes hurtful term. Intersex is much more common.   It's tough to talk about what it would mean to be transgender in TES as well, because gender has many different connotations in Nirn than it does on Earth. Even on Earth different historical cultures have treated gender identity and gender expression with wildly varying consequences for the people effected.   There's certainly no character I can think of who has a 'Transition' dialogue topic and then tells you about the stress of growing up and always feeling like something was off, and eventually realizing they were born with sex organs that didn't match their identity, so they had to seek out, at great expense, a wizard who knew obscure, dangerous, stressful magics to help them become outwardly the person they are inside.   That doesn't mean trans people don't exist in TES. There's always going to be people whose gender is different from the one they were assigned at birth, and I want these games to represent that. The games are just interpretations of the lore and necessarily scale everything down. Hopefully there's some in ESO, and hopefully in the next game. Vivec is kind of a stand-out character and hopefully we see more such characters and fewer of them gods and more of them just average people.

But, being ""male and female"" is rather odd, as the two genders ""male"" and ""female"" are built to be exclusive. Of course, (next to) nobody is 100% male/female, we're are a mixture of them, but with a tendency that characterizes you as ""male"" or ""female"".  If your mixture of male/female is something like 50/50, for me you're an androgynous, a ""third gender"", your own kind of gender. You can call that ""bigender"" too, I guess. I also read ""intergender"" on that wiki. But honestly, for me it's all the same under different names: you don't fit in the male/female dichotomy. It's just being picky on the words.  Having the two genders at the same time, is like being calm and upset at the same time, it's impossible. The majority of our behaviors are considered as ""masculine"" or ""feminine"" (and some neutral), and generally, when a behavior is considered ""feminine"" the opposite behavior is considered ""masculine"". That's why I can't figure someone with the ""two genders"" at the same time, because that means you have two opposite behaviors at the same time.  After that. I speak only in a occidental point of view. I heard that some cultures have something like 4 or 5 genders, that's different. In occident, you are either a ""man"" or a ""woman"", and in few countries (like Germany) you have a third category for those who don't fit. And gender-wise, Tamriel is based on the occidental model."

teslore,3cjaxe,lady_freyja,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:52:45 2015 UTC,"Well... For taking a very stereotypical example:  Being fashionable is considered ""feminine"", and if you don't care about fashion, you're ""masculine"".  In that case, experiencing the two genders at the same time means that you are fashionable and not at the same time. It's impossible. That's what I understand with that expression of ""having two genders"", that simply doesn't make sense. (But, as I said to gro-Muluk, it's probably a terminology issue; other people don't interpret the expression ""having two genders"" in the same manner as me)  You can be androgynous, or ""intergender"", or ""third gender"", or ""bigender"", or whatever, because after summing all your behaviors and tastes, you notice that either ""man"" or ""woman"" doesn't work for you. And that's totally fine.  But in that case, you're ""in between"" masculine and feminine, you are not the two at the same time.  That's how the ""masculine"" and the ""feminine"" were built, as two opposites. Like black and white. And between the black and the white, you have a ton of shades of grey.  Most people tend to stick near either side, and thus define themselves as ""woman"" or ""man"". And a few are near the middle, they define themselves as ""androgynous"" or whatever you can find as name. (the LGBT are very creative when it comes to naming things :D )  Hopefully, thank to the feminism, more and more behaviors and tastes become gender-neutral.

As for ""third gender,"" there are nonbinary genders, but the term ""third gender"" itself is a specific thing-- it's only for native south-east Asians, because it's a direct translation from some of their historical nonbinary genders.

teslore,3cidee,Mr_Flippers,16,Wed Jul 8 06:53:59 2015 UTC,"There's tons of Buddhism and Hinduism in TES if you look deeply.   If you ask me, CHIM is comparable to Nirvana or Moksha. A certain insight into the world which allows you to transcend it. The feats the Buddha was capable of in the stories - he'd have no trouble stopping a meteor in its tracks. Also I find the character of Vivec as being morally reprehensible but still worthy of worship by virtue of being a god very reminiscent of Krishna and Shiva. The laws of men do not apply to gods. The Tribunal also reminds me of the Hindu Trimurti, a name for the three gods Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva, who together form the Supreme Godhead or Brahman - a near monotheistic concept. This is similar to Almalexia, Sotha Sil and Vivec (possibly) being the same oversoul. However, the fact that ALMSIVI used to be mortal is reminiscent of a Chinese religion: Taoism, in which many gods such as the god of war Guan Yu are deifications of actual historical figures. However, Krishna is also based on a historical figure.  Vivec is a lot like Krishna in many ways. They're mischievous, immoral, and overly sexual in ways that their followers would never acknowledge as erotic, but would explain away symbolically. Furthermore, Krishna went into a great battle as the servant of the prince Arjuna. However, reading the Bhagavat Gita now, Arjuna basically worships Krishna, who reveals a lot of esoteric knowledge to him - even showing his true form as an avatar of Vishnu. Now, two historical characters, one subordinate to the other, but in myth the subordinate becomes godly and teaches his master... What does that remind me of? (A: Nerevar and Vehk) Although the dark-skinned Krishna (his name means ""Black"", ""Dark"", or ""Dark-Blue"") is often depicted as a composite deity with his light-skinned consort Radha, Vivec mimics that other dark-skinned Hindu god more: Shiva, the ash-smeared god who is, together with his golden-skinned consort, sometimes depicted as one person half dark and half light... and, not unimportant in Vivec's case, half male and half female.   The weird thing is that, if you'll forgive the mixing of TES, Hindu, and Buddhist terms, is that basically, Vivec first became an ""ordinary"" (though incarnate) Hindu god through the use of the Heart, then later achieved CHIM and became Enlightened and a Buddha (or Arhant).  Vivec is a God-Buddha, an Enlightened God. I have no doubt that there's not a person in TES more powerful than him.  EDIT:   Some tales about Krishna that could come straight out of the 36 Lessons of Vivec Krishna.  The young boy Krishna saves his town from the angry storm god Indra by lifting up a mountain as an umbrella.  Krishna conquers the great snake Kaliya, who'd been poisoning the river of his home town. Modern alternative.  Krishna's mother Yashoda sees the entire universe when she opens Krishna's mouth to see if he's been eating sand.  Krishna and his white-skinned brother Balarama easily kill some gladiators.  Krishna breaks his promise of not fighting in the war. Now, to Krishnaites, Krishna is the supreme deity in a monotheistic, pantheistic sense. Him breaking his promise is a big deal, but he's allowed to do so precisely because he is this enormous deity. That smells Vivecy to me.  And one of my favourites, Krishna steals the clothes of some bathing shepherd girls and climbs a tree, and doesn't give them back until they show their boobs."

teslore,3cidee,SoulMuffins,2,Wed Jul 8 12:04:56 2015 UTC,"i believe so as per this definition of intersex: ""Intersex ... is a variation in sex characteristics ... that do not allow an individual to be distinctly identified as male or female."" i wouldn't say the term intersex is lore-friendly, but i would also say that use of the outdated and now-considered-derogatory term ""hermaphrodite"" in vivec's sermons is because of not knowing better on the out-of-game writer's part, or not wanting to use something that invokes the clinical/medically advanced imagery of the term ""intersex."" i would speculate that the same goes for using ""he"" for vivec in game. that was surely easier for the writers and/or they did not think to or did not want to use non-normative pronouns, although it would have been an intriguing writing choice (like khajiit and aegonian speech patterns). same for the ""male"" character model; contemporary examples of androgyny tend to be skinny and masculine if not represented through prepubescence (i.e. physical stage prior to development of secondary sex characteristics that imply primary hormones).  intersex doesn't imply one's sex fits into a m-f gradient or that they are outside of m-f or that they are or aren't both. still, i am only using it as what i believe to be the closest concept we have irl to what i interpreted vivec's ""hermaphroditism"" to be.   i definitely think that this unusual aspect of vivec is a huge part of what makes hir so ""godly,"" for lack of a better word. a huge part of deities is mystery and being beyond the comprehension of laities, so hir transcendence of gender, race, sex, etc is a physical manifestation of ascension. (i'm using these pronouns out of respect for op's use of them.)  this is a very interesting discussion to me but derails a bit from the op, so maybe another thread is called for, although i am frankly startled about how aggressive people get when discussing fictional character gender and sex. :-/"

teslore,3cear7,FuzzyBlumpkinz,21,Tue Jul 7 06:14:46 2015 UTC,"It's alright, we were all new to the lore once--and honestly I still feel very new to it. There's something to learn new here everyday.  First of all, dragons aren't descended from Akatosh. Rather, that is just the way that Alduin/Parthuunax communicate with your character who, with their origins in crossing the border from Cyrodiil, is most likely not familiar with mythopoeia and divines outside the Alessian compromise. When the Aedra gave themselves to the creation of the world, they were rendered dead/comatose and in doing so became in a sense like a part of it. By becoming tied to the world in this way they became malleable through the beliefs of the people inhabiting it--men, mer, etc.;as each of these groups began to believe in their own interpretation of the Time Dragon AKA--the one who ""died"" after the creation of the world--those aspects were literally shed from the husk of the Dragon and became their own own separate entities, or shards of AKA, including Alkosh/Alduin/Akatosh/Auri-el. In that sense, Alduin and Akatosh are ""equals"" in that they are both aspects of AKA shed through varying cultural beliefs. This process is referred here as mythopoeia. The ""Akatosh"" that Paarthurnax and Alduin is actually AKA, who in their language is called Bormah--literally father, for all dragons, including your character in Skyrim, are also shards of AKA, although quite a bit smaller and less powerful than the formerly mentioned ones. (that is, of course, unless your LDB ate enough souls to become a bigger shard, but that should be left for another thread. It should also be noted that mythopoeia also happened to the other seven Aedra that have various cultural aspects (Kyne/Kynareth, Jhunal/Julianos, etc.)  Yes, you are correct in that dragons did both exist at Atmora and that they came with men to Skyrim. Ysgramor was either a Dragonpriest or a dragon himself, and the Dragon Cult were at the front line of the war between the Atmorans and the Snow Elves. They did not rule over the rest of Tamriel as far as I know, as the dragons seemed to expand with their Atmoran subjects and the First Empire of the Nords was founded after the Dragon War, and even then it only covered at its height Morrowind, Skyrim and High Rock.   Nafaalilargus, the dragon that Cyrus killed, was one of the survivors of the Dragon War, like Mirmulnir. And yes, if you read the ""Atlas of Dragons"" that Esbern has, you will find that there were dragons that fled from Skyrim and lived in Red Mountain in Morrowind for example.   Tosh Raka is a Po Tun who achieved apotheosis through mantling whatever the Po Tun's aspect of AKA is according to MK. Mantling is probably better explained by this post, but in essence it is taking the sphere of influence from a divine through yourself through some method including the fourth walking way. But yes, since he mantled whatever the Po Tun's Akatosh was he became a shard of AKA and therefore a dragon...maybe. Assuming the laws that we know of in Tamriel work in Akavir...  In terms of major metaphysical events that happened outside of Tamriel, I don't really know. When the dragons and their cult left Atmora, time stopped there--after all, dragons are biological time machines in essence--and I suppose Tosh Raka's mantling could be considered an event as well. However, there IS metaphysical significance in the continents themselves: Tamriel is considered the present, Yokuda is considered the past (either a past kalpa or even Amaranth or memory of an amaranth or something else) whilst Akavir is considered the future (either a future kalpa or Amaranth or memory of an Amaranth or again, something else)--sun rises in the East and sets in the West and all that jazz. Aldmeris doesn't even exist--it's just the Aldmer's nostalgia-fueled fantasy of a past that was never real--whilst frozen, now timeless Atmora is a metaphor for the bitter defeat of men and their Hero during the Dawn and the past as lesser spirits they left behind after the creation of Mundus. Tamriel is also where we get our perspective of practically every bit of lore from, and also the Starry Heart of the World, so it should be no surprise that most of our knowledge comes from this continent.  The Redguards brought tales of Yokuda and its culture with them, as did the Tsaesci who would go on to intermarry with Cyrodiilic Nobility and rule the Second Empire after the fall of the Reman dynasty. From the Yoku we have the origins of the ""Warrior Wave"" that would go on to conquer Hammerfell, the sword-singing culture and the use of incredibly powerful tonal architecture to literally shatter a continent as a few facts about their homeland and the aftermath of its fall--after all, an entire group of men who inhabit a large chunk of Tamriel came from there.   If I got anything wrong, please forgive me. I don't want to mislead you :/"

Nor anyone speaking from authority to confirm anything.   As for the Ysgramor the Dragon(priest) idea? Well he was a nominally a king and by anything I can find was pre-Dragon War so applying a bit of logic it would be essentially mandatory for him to have some connection to the Dragon Cult since he'd very likely need assorted ceremonial blessings and so forth to reinforce his authority. Full fledged priest well clearly nobody told this guy he was supposed to put his mask on.   As for dragon, well its not out of the question to mantle various roles with heroes of Ysgramor's stature but I would view that in more of the way say the Last Dragonborn is ""a dragon"" rather then literal scaly and flying and what not. And THAT is still a speculative it just happens to dovetail nicely with other characters in the lore having other mystical aspects... but unless I missed a supporting reference it remains unsupported speculation. Even that Ys Gra Mor requires one either mangling draconic a bit or UESP needs further additions. Wouldn't be the first time someone had a dragon name while not one though so its still very circumstantial.

And so on.  The last paragraph:   With the Morag broken and sent into the eastern slush, we finally caught sight of Snow-Throat, and knew that our journey was near its ending again. It was the World-Eater’s-Waking that broke shore first, Shouting our victory and doom, whose Boat-Thane was Ysmaalithax the Northerly Dragon, his first-clutch-sons Tsuunalinfaxtir and St’unuhaslifafnal, whose Tear-Jills were Vorramaalix, Jarliallisuh, Alleirisughus, and the Dewclaw Widow Who Foreswore Her Name, whose Void-Jills were Eljaalithathisalif Hate-Fire and Ingridaaligu who lost her minutes in the mending, and Mjaariliaalunax Half-Fire, whose Earth-Jills were none awoke, and whose Aether-Jills were none survived, and whose Magne-Jills were Shanu’ujeneen the Star-Woven and Jaalhngithaax Whose-Name-Stays-in-its-Egg.

If Ysgramor was indeed a ""dragon"", most likely he was a Dragon Priest - in the Late Merethic Era, it would be unlikely for a leader of Ysgramor's reported stature to be unconnected to the Dragon Cult. But connecting the Nord hero Ysgramor with the now-reviled Dragon Cult is of course anathema to those who favor chauvinism over historical truth.  Other possibilities are that Ysgramor was not an individual but an amalgamation of several people - his reported exploits encompass an unreasonable amount of time for a single individual. At the time, anyone of high stature or great prowess in battle would have been considered a ""dragon"" (the highest compliment imaginable). This does not mean that Ysgramor was in fact an actual dragon, but I have no doubt that the literal-minded among us will not hesitate to jump to the most obvious conclusions. True scholars will of course be more circumspect.    But this is still posted as his in-universe moniker, and Hasphat Antabolis certainly wasn't all-knowing if my memory of Morrowind serves me.   Also, there are a multitude of random dragon accounts that have only posted on the thread, likely created solely for the purpose of doing so. Since MK and KK already were in the thread, and dev rps are not unknown to these forums, those dragons could very well be people of importance or alternate accounts of the former too. And I think this paragraph corroborates well with Ysgramor as a dragon:   They were frozen. They could not grow. Of the mortals, the pale-skinned Nords, as you would call them, none remembered that they could grow, that they could change - at least not that they could tell. Their bones knew, though, yearned for the metamorphosis they could no longer make, and chafed at the glory and power of the dovah above them. Even the eight dovhahdrim that had come across the seas lost themselves; they fell into sorrow, madness, and tyranny under the sorrow-yoke of their eternal cusp. And in this land of sorrow and separation where the dov could not grow, is it any surprise that they were eventually overthrown? That it was Alduin and his cadre against whom the kendoval muz fought is only incidental; any dovah would have done the same, to such ungrateful subjects, to mortals who could not even remember whence sprang their resentments.  So. You overthrew your overlords; you threw off long millenia of aspiration and instead forced the tragedy of your eternal mortality down the throats of dovah in their own Voice. And you were successful; the dov dwindled, and even Alduin himself choked on your bitter cup."
teslore,3cear7,Vermax,7,Wed Jul 8 08:59:15 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure the dov came from Akavir. Tosh Raka was one of the tiger people (I forget the actual name… Ka'Po'Tun?) who turned into a dragon through drachochrysalis. He is just as much of a dragon as the ones in Skyrim are.

teslore,3cear7,Sexual_Thunder,3,Tue Jul 7 12:40:46 2015 UTC,"Dragons seem to have been everywhere st one point. Tamriel, Akavir and Atmora, at the least, and barring any information to the contrary I would presum Yokuda as well. They didn't really spread, but rather were spawned into existence as sapient moments as linear time solidified. Remember, Dragons are not biological entities, but rather fragments of time, with free will and bodies.  The fact that Dragons seem to have existed in Tamriel and Atmora, well before the Dragon War, indicate to me that the whole subjugation and drove to rule is not as simple as Skyrim portrays...  Anyway, we know that the worship of Dragons, in the form of the Dragon Cult, came with the Atmorans, along with their other totemic priesthoods. This seems to have developed into the standard Nordic pantheon sometime after the Dragon War, and that shift could even have been partly the cause of it. But while none of the Meri civilizations on Tamriel worshipped Dragons, they were aware of their existence, imndicating that the Dragons were present long before the Return."

There is dragon in Blackreach so i thought they contested with others. But i assume they like northern colder places and didnt go south. About Tosh Raka not very much are known. But he is the leader of one of the major species in Akaviri(Ka Po Tun aka tiger man) and  claimed to be turn into a dragon. Dragons came from Akavir as Dragonguard(Blades) so they lived on other continents. That dragon is a hiding one like Paarth. He serves Tiber Septim.  This is Tamriel's kalpa so it is the center. Also you cannot say if others on other continents know very much about Tamriel.

They can try to mimic it in their current form, but no matter how many dazzling towers or beautiful cities or excessively complex and bureacratic systems of government you build, there's just nothing you can do to achieve that state of perfectly hierarchical crystalline energy, an ultimate union and order of fractalized spirits all resonating the pulse of Anuiel, while you're stuck in a body and mixed into the fluid house of chaos and entropy that is existence in the mundane realm."
teslore,3ccxpa,ginja_ninja,9,Tue Jul 7 02:10:47 2015 UTC,Aldmeris is nowhere. Nominally anyways.  According to Nu-Hatta (Intercept #5) and seconded by Michael Kirkbride (Q&A) it didn't exist its just the jostled memories of the earliest days of the mer before they developed distinct cultures. Or basically a nostalgic myth for something that never was.  If somewhere has to be Aldmeris it would be just whatever spot the elves happened to be standing on when the Convention was over and everybody woke up with terrible hangovers. Somewhere on Tamriel though again according to Nu Hatta. Best guess is either Summerset or the Isle of Balifera simply for convenience.

If the mist engulfs Aldmeris and thus Aldmeris becomes Pyandonea, then the Maormer or anyone else can never return to Aldmeris. I will try to find out if that is true though.  I found it here. I think this is just altered history by the Altmer thinking that Orgnum was exiled like I explained in my original post."
teslore,3ccxpa,Renegard,3,Tue Jul 7 01:38:22 2015 UTC,"Warning: the following is pure conjecture and mildly buzzed ramblings  Orgnum having control of a tower isn't that farfetched. The Stone of Crystal-Like-Law is said to be a person and I think it's likely that person is Orgnum. We know that all the known stones of towers are myth echos of Lorkhan (except the perchance acorn which we know literally nothing about) The Impossipoint of Convention, the Heart, the Amulet of Kings (pelinal's heart), the Mantella (heart of zurinwulfharth), the Mane (only appears when the two halves of lorkhan's flesh divinity are joined) The Cave (Shor son of Shor). If this pattern holds true then Orgnum would be the living representation of Lorkhan.  Looking at the only known image of Orgnum we can see that he's basically the wizard Merlin. So who was Merlin? The Merlin we know is actually an amalgamation of multiple real people, Ambrosius Aurelianus a Roman-British war commander and Myrddin Wylit a Welsh Druid/madman. He's literally the fusion of pure order (roman empire) with pure chaos (madness) It could be extrapolated that Orgnum himself is a sort of mix between the concepts of Anu and Padomay much like Vivec was. To add further evidence that Orgnum was based on Merlin I would like to point out the town where Myrddin Wylit was born was called Moridunum, literally ""Sea Fortress"". A Sea Fortress is exactly what Pyandonea is.  Continuing even further than that, one of the most famous stories of Merlin is the story of Vortigern's Tower. A local king named Vortigern was trying to build a new tower, but it always collapsed before completion. Vortigern called on his mages to figure out what was happening, they suggested to sacrifice a boy with no father on the site. The boy they found just so happened to be Merlin who told them the reason why the Tower was collapsing. He led them to a hidden pool under the tower where two dragons slept. Honestly it reads like TES apocrypha without even changing anything. He was a prisoner born of uncertain parents, who built a tower by witnessing the battle between twin dragons. He's like Pelinal, an insane personification of two forces that are simultaneously contradictory and exactly the same."

teslore,3ccxpa,PADOMAIC-SPECTROMETE,2,Tue Jul 7 22:37:29 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if Shezzarine would be the right word for Orgnum. If you read a bit about the Dawn Era you'll see that the gods are described as living breathing people who walked the face of Nirn. Trinimac, Auriel, Xarxes were all living mortal beings. I've had this theory for a while that the aldmeri gods were once kings of the various tribes of Aldmer who later grew into godhood as part of the Aldmeri tradition of ancestor worship. If that's the case Orgnum may very well be Lorkhan himself or rather some shattered aspect of him, maybe even his spirit."

I say this, because an enantiomorph in elder scrolls involves the three parties you mentioned with two opposite 1s mingling together to create a synthesized 2. In this case the ones would be Padomay (black, solve, solar, acting upon) and Anu (white, coagula, lunar, acted upon) coming together to form Aurbis and its grey area of possibility.   Also though not necessarily relevant I figured that I’d point out that the same principle is displayed in Morrowind’s logo.

The tower can be 're-created', but it is not the same as it was before. (This is speculation on my part) 1 Tower, 1 Stone. The caveat you put forth is definitely a possibility. We don't know much about CLL Yes. The Towers (save for Red Mountain, Snow-Throat and Direnni) were created by Mer in emulation of the original 3. It's my understanding that they DO in fact solidify reality in their general locale, namely, their province. One tower, one province, really. Save for Orsinium, and Black Marsh. A dismantled tower weakens reality as a whole. Two towers are needed to keep (Nirn, or the Mundus) stable, and the two towers left are Direnni tower, who's stone is convention (the first impossipoint, the zero stone) and Talos is a tower who's stone is the Mantella I believe.

Also, Snow-Throat was natural, a 'mirror' of Red Mountain (even separated by a 'line of symmetry' mountain range) and it's the midpoint on a possible path the Heart could have taken (though Time wasn't solidified until it landed so there's no way to know for sure), as indicated by the ebony veins.  This suggests Snow-throat is important in some way and is the Third Tower of the Three. It's also the only other natural Tower, and its stone is a source of contention.

A stone could literally be a connected/entangled collective (items, mortals, ideas).  -If there are towers outside of mainland Tamriel, there could well be some in Akavir, some that exist[ed] in Atmora, & anywhere else (Perhaps both mortal-built & natural ones). Perhaps Aldmeris to Merish populations could contain a tower [of emptiness]? Also, this could mean that Nirn is not entirely Tamriel-centric as Imperial [& possibly Thalmor [propaganda]] media would want one to thìnk.  Also, in regards to the Dwemer, the Heart of Lorkhan may have actually been an anti-stone & the Dwemer became a stone in consciousness/ideation. If this is the case, the Dwemer really did attain some aspect of diffusion/disappearance/Zero-summing (maybe a paradox of both existing & not simultaneously).  -Finally, there is a possibility to revise/treat a tower, though ìt would really not be the same. This would result in entropy that may be very similar to our own Universe & it's ending (thìnk Laws of Physics: Thermodynamics {neé finite energy, limitations, exchanges}).

teslore,3c7oiv,Cheydin,20,Sun Jul 5 17:46:19 2015 UTC,Well the first thing I picked up on was the last sentance of the first quote about heating and cooling. That is exactly how the radiative heat transfer is calculated (Q = (Boltzman constant)*T4 ). So we know radiation of heat works in a similar way to our own universe.
teslore,3c7oiv,MakutaFearex,9,Sun Jul 5 18:02:16 2015 UTC,"The manner by which the diastolic pressure of any two scarce commodities   Magicka passing through the sun and stars and into Mundus and because diastolic refers to arteries, Aetherius and Mundus is metaphorical for the heart with magicka being the blood, the essence of life in a sense. Perhaps some vague reference to the Heart of Lorkhan can be found.   However, starting with a grid of complex numbers that more than covers the unit circle and three cube roots of one, we can backtrace, by uptracking the negative ʺhalf numbers,ʺ and create an infinite basin with dual natures of blackness and whiteness.   Negative half numbers are the clockwise values of the unit circle - hence uptracking as clockwise tracks up at the curve's nadir. When someone calls upon a spell, they must reverse the process to dispel it.   There are an infinite amount (infinite basin) of numbers between 'zero' and pi and pi and two pi - 'not zero' - and three cube roots of one represent every point on the circle being an equal distance from center, always one value. The 'center' in this case is the mage drawing, at will, any given amount of magicka available to them at that time but never more than they can grasp. You will always have a different number along the circle but never more than the circle allows and neither number further from the center than the next - you will have to dispel as much as you drew to cast.  The dual natures of blackness and whiteness are both distinct, like zero and not zero, but the same in their being when the situation demands it, like two pi being zero and not zero and blackness and whiteness being indistinguishable without light. The mage knows blackness and an absence of light are not the same for they can see black in the presence of light. Magicka is the 'light' - from where it came as far as mortals can perceive it - that allows one to see where the absence of it would leave the indistinguishable for an absence of magicka is the absence of being as all is connected to magicka, and an absence of being is being indistinguishable from the indistinguishable - how can that which is not be separated from what is? Being indistinguishable is an odd notion - a sour mix of words - as life without magicka is absurd.  Make of that what you will.   The rate of adiabatic cooling or warming in unsaturated air can thus be made directly proportional to the fourth power of its absolute temperature.   The magicka flowing from casting and dispelling places one beyond their base being thus magicka carries an inherent danger that requires preciseness of some form.   When white light is passed through a gas under a medium dense gas at a high temperature, a dynamic thermal instability occurs.   Air is always around the caster and the magicka - the light - given purpose disturbs it, from the crackling of a bolt or flapping of flame that leaves the air thick with smoke and an odor of cooked meat when landed properly and the manipulation of the perception of senses to the 'opening' of Oblivion - moving the air and causing a change in temperature where the veil now stands - and the manipulation of magicka itself, a spell of mysticism.  To manipulate that which came from the stars and sun is to manipulate warmth itself.   Since magicka is usually a very faint source of illumination, gases, under much greater pressure, are forced to combine with degenerated matter, creating dual forces, beyond and beneath. The end result is a quasi-horizontal chonolith composed of anastomosing ductoliths, whose distal ends curl like a harpolith, thin like a sphenolith, or bulge discordantly like an akmolith or ethmolith.   The degenerated matter is the mortal or things of 'substance' in this case. The mortal's fleshly being is magicka fallen - some mages exploit this lingering presence - twisted into something else and yearns for a return, a quasi-horizontal (should be cylindrical) chonolith. Its anastomosing (an intensifier for literary purposes) ductoliths are magicka given purpose, lingering and drawn. In fact, lith is what many mages call magicka as that is the sound many hear in their minds during their casting.  Harpolith is what a mage sometimes experiences but cannot truly describe to those who have not studied the interconnected flowing of magicka for some time. It is labeled as a thing for simplicity. The best description would be an orgasm that is nearing but never releases, ever pleasurable and taunting, and nothing is more taunting than having a multi-spelled scroll burst as you were imbuing the last 'words' - more like reminders of intention - of the last spell on the parchment. If a mage thinks they understand multitapestrial wordsmithing, they do not understand multitapestrial wordsmithing.  A sphenolith is the smallest amount of magicka possible to engender an effect. Mages can warm their bodies or bath water, although a sufficiently bold mage will just embrace the cold, or they could fell a tavern. Akmolith and ethmolith are the amounts of magicka to be concerned about. Akmolith will harm the target. An ethmolith will harm the caster and everyone around them.   There are thus five elements that must be contributed towards a universal confederation of what Galerion Vanus called ʺgray matterʺ – perception, evidence, essense, morality, and extraction.   Five elements - water, fire, air, dark (shadow), and light, earth being an amalgamated result of these in some form and thus not a separate element - are for simplicity as an infinite basin contains an infinite amount of alterations of the elements, partly due to the infinite variations in the amount of magicka that can be drawn between none and the mage's resource pool. Gray matter is so named because magicka is at its core all of those infinite possibilities until an amount and an element is 'selected'. Selection requires observation (perception and evidence) in order to know what to select, magicka (essence), and morality (open to interpretation but oft-considered to as will) and ends with an extraction (the desired spell in the palms).   All of these are affected by the five elements - and the nature in which we interact with the elements, which in turn changes the elements in some manner and how much specification in selection we can have - and our preferences for certain elements thus some view perception, evidence, essence, morality, and extraction as gray matter. Galerion Vanus is often misquoted as seeing gray matter as such.   Lith - magicka *Chono - flesh (matter depending upon context or when referencing non-sentients) Ducto - harnessed Harpo - ambivalent Spheno - thin, named after spine, although a spine is not exactly thin Ak - Those with a dark sense of humor claim it is named on account of a target's yelp when struck but it means battle ready Eth - Dangerous for all   Edited for grammar and stuff."
teslore,3c7oiv,ArcaneRedguard,5,Mon Jul 6 06:32:28 2015 UTC,"Good find, too bad we didn't know about this for the ""math in TES"" thread a week or so ago.  In particular, the math in the first excerpt is quite modern in real-world historical terms. Roots of unity and the units circle are concepts that weren't really nailed down until the mid 1700s, and even the basic concepts of cube roots and variables to the 4th power generally were a middle ages phenomenon. Previously there was a fair understanding of squares and cubes but (as the names imply) this was more a geometric than algebraic thing. But you need it for the Stefan–Boltzmann law, as /u/MakutaFearex points out.  Now from a dully real-world technical perspective the paragraph as a whole is basically gobbledygook, but it nonetheless involves some concepts which show that Tamriel in the Daggerfall era is fairly mathematically sophisticated.  The second paragraph is even more interesting. It starts with a description of absorption spectroscopy and then goes off the rails a bit. What's particularly interesting to note is the explicit connection between magic and light. The sun in the sky is of course actually the hole torn by Magnus, and its light is magicka. In our world, absorption spectroscopy performed on sunlight led to the discovery of a previously unknown element - helium. The excerpt from the second paragraph could be taken as a hint along those lines. ""Gray matter"" would be a new element, not well known or understood in Mundus, but discovered in and through the light of Magnus."

The Dunmer really only began enslaving Argonians after the Four-Score War ended, and the Argonians wouldn't have wanted the Akaviri to win its war with the Nords and Dunmer.  In fact, if Heita-Meen and her vision from the Hist can be believed, the Akaviri probably would have won if the Argonians hadn't joined in the fight against them.  So, to answer the question, the alliance was largely about ending slavery, and it looks like the Dunmer ceded some territory to the Argonians as well.  And no doubt we'll hear more about this Keshu's role in it when the update rolls around."

He is the ultimate Thu'um master, save for maybe Talos (but CHIM helps). Miraak not only devised the Bend Will shout, but was powerful enough to create a Thu'um with 4 syllables (Ziil Los Di Duu), that instantly subjugates the soul of the dragon it is used on. Even Dovahkiin grow better with practice, and Miraak had millenia. It's merely fate (read: Herma-Mora) that allowed him to be defeated by the Last Dragonborn.  Edit: Compared to regular magic, it's incredibly powerful. As a form of Tonal Manipulation, that is, singing the world-song as you see fit, it is nearly, if not actually, limitless in potential in strength. As for dragon souls, they are consumed for their knowledge by the conquering dragon or Dragonborn. In their conversion to knowledge, the souls are ""destroyed"" and returned to Aka (probably/arguably)."

It's more forceful and less intricate, and involves shouting the world itself into changing according to your own will. The prevalent theory is that the Aurbis is built entirely out of manipulable tones, and there are many instances of techniques such as this throughout the races."

Namely the reshaping of reality to your will, which is what all of them do. Even regular old alteration. A fundamental separation of these powers entirely should only come with the clearest of sources because metaphysically if they all look like ducks, quack like ducks...  Also this not being the case would raise troubling questions like whenenver a mage plays around with Dwemercraft and gets a result at all how that could be possible if these lines were clear and distinct.  As for the ""who is stronger"" contest aspects we don't have much of a baseline on what a ""regular"" Tongue was capable of back in the day just the epic heroes who's names are worth remembering for thousands of years. Sure a regular mage isn't that impressive but what about say Mannimarco or the Psjics? For that matter Zurin Arctus and Wulfharth in theory got something like a mutual kill against each other in the Arcturian Heresy."

Talk to Paarthurnax about rotmulaag and you'll see that even dragons have room for improvement.   How powerful are they when compared to more standard magic?   This question doesn't really make sense, as it's too broad, too nonspecific.  What do you mean by ""powerful""?  It all depends on what you're trying to accomplish in the first place.  But I will mention that Thu'um is a form of Tonal magic, which is analogous to applied quantum physics, whereas the use of magicka is more like applied Newtonian physics.  A difference in potential sophistication, yes, but when you get down to it, sometimes you don't need more sophisticated means to do what you want.   Could new ones be invented by a Dragon or Dragonborn?   Yes.  The invention of a Shout is a central part of the main plot.  Granted, by mortals, but there's no reason a dragon couldn't do the same.   What's up with dragon souls? What happens to them after a Dragonborn gobbles them up? Are they just gone?   Ideas differ.  I would say that they are merged into the soul of the dragon that ate them (whether Dragonborn or not).

I don't doubt your knowledge, but would you mind giving me a source that says Aldmeris was to the south of Tamriel? I couldn't find any literature on it at TIL, so I sought elsewhere.  I found this map (taken from this reddit thread), which was, in turn, based on this thread by LN.  Of note, in that thread it mentions that the Lefthanded Empire was roughly 3x that of Tiber Septim's, and Tiber's was 3-4x the size of the Roman Empire.  Given the sheer size of Yokuda, could it be that the Lefthanders came from southern Yokuda, sailing NNE to Aldmeri? This would still leave room for the Ra-Gada to come from the west, providing they resided in the northern parts of the continent.  I hope you don't think I'm disagree with you just so that I don't have to admit fault in the idea. I do, however, want to know if the theory can be reconciled before I have to dismiss it."
teslore,3c75a5,SolomonBlack,3,Sun Jul 5 17:29:12 2015 UTC,"You're arguing there's a simple answer in the series that loves its complexity and hidden meanings?  Furthermore you touch on that there's actual lore evidence that Aldmeris never existed. My own read of Nu-Hatta is that he's saying not so much that its a ""concept"" which can be very real things in Tamrielic lore, but rather a true myth of dubious reality and heavy on nostalgia. AKA like learning about the USA by watching Leave It to Beaver.  Regardless this evidence really needs to be argued with counter evidence that Aldmeris was very much real (artifacts, accounts of its geography, etc) and that it can also be tied to Yokuda.   Mythic similarities don't mean terribly much here. Vanished beneath the ocean is a simple and easy way to rhetorically dispose of a location in a story you can't find in reality. And they aren't actual evidence anymore then pyramids all have a similar shape.   (Also ""lost"" continents are kinda the rule not the exception in Tamriel, nobody is in contact with Akavir and Atmora for example, though I understand the latter underwent dramatic freezing over)"

I'm not arguing for a simple yes/no, but I am wondering how well it holds up to scrutiny with things we already know or don't entirely know. It is exactly the fact that I understand that this series loves its complexity and hidden meanings that lead my thinking here.  At the end of the day, I also wanted to talk about the idea. No definitive answers need to be reached. It was something I was interested in talking about."
teslore,3c75a5,Watosh66,1 point,Sun Jul 5 17:35:36 2015 UTC,"There's a difference between an answer being inconclusive and an answer being unfounded.  One can always speculate other alternatives. What separates being Yokuda from Aldmeris being a plane of Oblvion, a piece of another kalpa, a flat out other reality, or say a flying continent? Most of those have other similar things I can point to in the lore even. Of course far as I can tell they are also unsupported.  That Yokuda was also destroyed doesn't even help because Yokuda was only destroyed within the historical period around 792-808 1E well after elves were established in Tamriel. So if its simpler to have only one destroyed continent how is is simpler to have it destroyed twice?  Against all that we have a pretty definitive statement that Aldmeris is just a myth, that is seconded by MK. Which is further supported by it having virtually no details so we can actually be pretty conclusive. The only counter to the info is that since the sourcing is apocryphal (albeit very important) it thus can be abandoned freely if the next game wants to go let you dive its ruins.  Which incidentally is not the case for Yokuda. (Example 1,, Example 2) so you can see the contrast.  All things are possible, relatively few are likely, and without something to go on unfounded speculation isn't really something to discuss because everyone is free to make their own with equal ablity."
teslore,3c75a5,Jordoom,1 point,Sun Jul 5 19:51:38 2015 UTC,"I like the idea that Aldmeris was a mental concept more than a physical one.   There's absolutely nothing we really know about Aldmeris, and we'd know even less if it was a continent. I see it as the Aldmer were the elves on  Summerset that spread across Tamriel during the Merethic Era. Summerset is where they built Crystal-Like-Law, not Aldmeris. I think Aldmeris is the name for Merethic Tamriel or Merethic Summerset. That's why the Maormer refer to their original home as ""Aldmeris"". Because they were exiled from Merethic Tamriel. It fits the timeline better, even if the timeline is very, very vague and unknown. It also fits that Aldmeris is an idea better. Aldmeris is the idea of a Tamriel under elves, without the presence of man.  If Aldmeris is a physical continent then it should be to the far south, not west. There also aren't any mention of Redguards in Altmer or Maormer mythology. If the theory that Yokuda and Akavir are reflections of previous Kalpas then this theory would suggest that Mer came from a previous Kalpa in a way, and are not native to this one. That wouldn't really fit the whole thing about the Mer taking part in the Aedra's war when they were still spirits, because that happened in this Kalpa."

There is of course the possibility of the LDB going on an expedition to Yokuda. As we know abandoning your homeland right before it gets obliterated has become a common trend. Another reason it might not happen is because the Falmer are scattered across Skyrim, so they can't really establish communications with each other and emerge simultaneously. One Dwemer ruin's worth of Falmer isn't exactly enough to bring down all of Skyrim. Then there's the dragons which could defend Skyrim. I say this because either A. the LDB used Bend Will on all, or at least most of them, or B. They don't want to have any pesky Falmer snooping around.  I like the idea that the Akaviri will invade. There was a lot of content regarding the Akaviri in Skyrim, such as Sky Haven Temple. They haven't invaded since the middle of the Second Era, around a thousand years ago. You'd think that an invasion is overdue at this point. Perhaps that's why the Nerevarine traveled to Akavir."

How about one Blackreach's worth? Complete with a Dwarven City full of Falmer and several other linked ruins?   I also think that the Falmer have means of traveling between places that we either don't understand or for some reason can't use. There's at least two cases where they've broken into a place through the basement from an otherwise sealed cave system. They must have had some way to get in there in the first place, so I wouldn't rule out some sort of co-orindation.  Imagine if all the ruins connected to the Blackreach started spewing Falmer and Charus while at the same time Markarth was overrun from beneath. It would be a good day to be elsewhere :)  [edit]  And yeah, TLD is going to have to be elsewhere for a while.

I for one subscribe to the theory that Nirn's climate does not operate in the same way Earth's does. For example, Atmora isn't cold because it's so far north, it's cold because some force has caused it to be such. Because Skyrim is the closest to Atmora its northern regions are cold.  Maybe Atmora has a Tower that's causing this. The Towers reshape the surrounding land based on the ideal climate of whoever controls it, or at least post-Convention towers do. Perhaps the Kamal invaded Atmora and took control of its Tower, causing the land to become uninhabitable to all except the Kamal."
teslore,3c4wag,Maven_of_Minecraft,4,Sun Jul 5 04:13:15 2015 UTC,"It could be a combination of things: natural reasons, Kamal, a [corrupted] tower (maybe from times where Elves left Altmora), ancient curses (undead/ dragons), or a Dragon Force (possìbly several, but one main one; could be known as Dovahsebrom/Drogdoiiz).  Any combination of such forces could compound the problem, which could seem evident given conditions in Atmora & how quickly ìt worsened.  In the end ìt froze essentially everything. Ìt is likely there are evil forces, dragons, undead, & more [frozen in thick ice]. It is said that things froze in more ways than one, suggesting even time [& space] froze there (almost like a black hole).  -I would highly suggest look up some fanfiction on this (fanfic.org ; Expedition to Atmora)."

teslore,3c4wag,CreamWafers,28,Sun Jul 5 13:01:34 2015 UTC,"The reason is the Civil War. Beth have always tried to leave the lore ambiguous whenever it involves the PC. But they can't really talk about events in Skyrim post-TESV without declaring that one side or the other won the war.     The Empire could collapse and make it all irrelevant.    Skyrim could become independent after the Empire found maintaining (or attempts to ) control to be costly. That could be interpreted as:   The Empire winning the civil war but having to fight numerous minor rebellions, leading to discontent with the jarls and the people as the Empire was using Skyrim's resources to fight the Stormcloaks and thus High Queen Elisif declaring independence with Skyrim at her back. The Empire would not have the advantage of friendly territory. A Stormcloak victory, one that involved Ulfric but was not truly realized with him. He died before becoming High King in battles against the Empire that sent troops from Cyrodiil to reclaim it and further conflict began to drain the Empire, thus they let Skyrim go. Or maybe he did become High King in someone's story and died from old age with the Empire straining itself.    Those could also be influenced by Titus Mede II's death - whether by assassination or natural causes that could be still believed to be an assassination - his death leading to the Elder Council making bad decisions about Skyrim, which would fit either interpretation, and if you want to be pedantic about it, the Dark Brotherhood was ran roughshod over - at some point - with both choices so who knows what happened. Maybe Amaund got to Commander Maro and the Mede was killed regardless.   I think people who are pro-Empire will just have to accept Skyrim being independent as it was hinted that the Empire could not afford to fight a rebellion, especially with their soldiers as that would have left them vulnerable to the Dominion."

teslore,3c4wag,Fatal_Burnz,13,Mon Jul 6 10:05:01 2015 UTC,"I'm convinced the events of skyrim are going to culminate in a sort of dragon break or other temporal weirdness similar to the Warp in the West where all of the player's choices end up getting validated, and simultaneously not, until the abnormality collapses (read:chaos) and you get a stable timeline again. Reality ends up consilidating itself around possible fixed points in space and time.   So, Hadvar really did watch some random prisoner morph into different races and faces until they culminated into the fateful hero, the emporer, civil war, and several other timelines end up in flux until resolved by an event done by individuals that have a stake in each branch of each timeline. Thalmor and falmer both seem like likely candidates to take advantage of the chaos, but I think in this scenario you'd also see a few surprises. Perhaps a stubborn holdout of General Tullius' band in the west while the stormcloaks (Would Ulfric even still be alive? I always liked Ralof...) are busy keeping the thalmor away from their borders.  I haven't posted on this sub very much, so I hope my thoughts are not too eggregious or innaccurate.

teslore,3c4wag,BlesstheGains,2,Sun Jul 5 00:20:36 2015 UTC,"The only thing that doesn't change in skyrim is the main quest. That establishes several things:  1: Alduin is defeated. This is the purpose of the Last Dragonborn, and is the only quest that cannot be refuted as it is able to be completed by whatever Dragonborn exists in that world. Whether the player chooses to complete it or not, it is a constant in the lore because it is the Dragonborn's purpose in Tamriel.   2: The Blades are Re-established. As a side effect of Alduin's defeat, Delphine and Esbern unearth Sky-Haven Temple and begin to rebuild the blades. Whether or not you decide to kill Paarthunax, the blades are now a present faction in Tamriel, and more akin to the Dragon hunters their ancestors started as as opposed to bodyguards for the imperial emperor. This is cannon because in vanilla skyrim, Delphine and Esbern--the only two characters needed to claim the blades are rebuilding--are essential.  3: The Dragon Elder Scroll is Discovered.  Its fate can change, between being housed at the college of winterhold, sold to the Moth Priest in the Dawnguard content, or simply staying in the Dragonborn's inventory until he or she dies, but the scroll has been recovered and read. I'm relatively new to the lore, but the scrolls are obviously immensely important, and it is worth noting that this is an outcome of the main quest.  Other than these things, unless I'm missing something, the entire world is malleable to the player's decisions."
teslore,3c4wag,Mr_Name,12,Sun Jul 5 14:20:21 2015 UTC,"I don't think the Dunmer will invade Skyrim. If they've rebuilt somewhat when the next game releases then I would've thought they'd try to reclaim their territory back from the Argonians.   Since the Imperials basically ignored the Dunmer when they needed help the Dunmer have resented them ever since, so they won't come to the Imperial's aid. They're also too proud to accept help from the Altmer, and I they'd prioritize their lands above all else."
teslore,3c4wag,Cyclenophus,6,Mon Jul 6 12:32:44 2015 UTC,"I would say that the Civil War is by no means concluded. There's still an Imperial presence in Skyrim, post Civil War (albeit, diminished). Or if the PC helps the Imperials, Stormcloaks still remain. And no High King is chosen and an independent Skyrim is never decided or insinuated.  Regardless of what the PC chose, Bethesda could easily say that, after continued resistance, a larger Imperial force was sent to deal with the uprising in Skyrim. Or the same for Stormcloaks if they wanted to write Skyrim as independent, ie the violence against the Stormcloaks just served to inspire more volunteers to the Stormcloak rebellion.  Nothing has to stay status quo until the next game and nonspecifics can still encompass all possible choices. They can say both Tulius and Ulfric died in the Civil War and it could easily be canon if specific times aren't given.  Edit: Another calamity isn't out of the question, though. Things seem to be getting steadily worse for the people of Tamriel.  I like the idea of an invasion from Akavir. It's a nice time to attack."

Creating an external event to nullify both arguably makes the choice even more pointless because everyone's resolution is irrelevant. Furthermore I'm not sure the previous games have left a dangling thread equal in magnitude to the Thalmor, what they intend, and give you no way to appreciably inconvenience the group as a whole.   That all said... if its done given that TES VI will hopefully be set somewhere in the southern parts of Tamriel while also dealing with said dangling thread. If they aren't going to pick a winner I think the nullifying event has to be Tamriel-wide in some way to feel important enough. Low hanging fruit would be Great War II: Thalmor Bugaloo with some lines like ""though initially unable to send forces as a result of the Stormcloak Rebellion the viciousness of the Dominion soon convinced even the most hardline of rebels there only chance lay unity"" though you can't even mention a High King/Queen as an abstract so its still a mighty dance.

Well, yes, I agree. I think the aim is to invalidate the player choice gracefully. What I think they need to avoid is having people say ""But I didn't do that!"" I mean there are players still upset that Sheogorath is still in the game after the events of SI.     That all said... if its done given that TES VI will hopefully be set somewhere in the southern parts of Tamriel while also dealing with said dangling thread. If they aren't going to pick a winner I think the nullifying event has to be Tamriel-wide in some way to feel important enough.    I suppose that's a fair point. There's no reason the event has to be confined to Skyrim.

Even more direct methods don't need to be province ruining per say. An act of magical terrorism at a meeting of most of the Jarls could sweep the field and leave only Balgruuf the Greater by chance to lead Skyrim.

Tht way you can funnel resources to the insurgents and make them think it's their idea.  For advisers, the best thing might be if they could find Dunmer born in Summerset who served in the Dominion army. (Probably as auxiliaries, admittedly) .

Many may still resurrect without a physical Alduin & some only live by their violent nature even despite examples of the opposite.  --Vampires also may be bad for Skyrim. Not only would they prey upon many innocents & worsen the casualities/ danger of Skyrim, the very prophecy Harkon & others desire fulfilled will be very damaging.  --Draugr: we see in Skyrim that Draugr seem to be all over the place in Skyrim. Many dungeons contain them in Skyrim in all sorts of places. It gets so bad that many are even annoyed. Besides gameplay, ìt appears that with Dragons returning, so are the Undead more than what may be inferred from before. How many Dragon Priests & Draugr Lords awoke from slumber? Perhaps more than you thìnk. They should be watched somewhat as well, since nobody wants Skyrim becoming a land of undead horrors.  --Climatic Chaos/ Famine is also very likely to occur, much of ìt stemming from conflict-imposed damages [to many goods & services]. War can become bad for business & Skyrim hints that this could be a problem with the sparsity of traders [outside of Caravans]. It is also quite possible that Dragons &/or Vampires could not only damage [food] supplies, but also the weather (moreso if the Tyranny of the Sun prophecy comes true & likely Storms ensue).  --Instability/ Splintering Factions/ Banditry: when Civil War factions get weak or one side is destroyed, ìt is likely many more will come or some splinter groups will form, particularly if they are Rebels. Bandits also could easily turn into a larger problem if given the chance. The Mede Dynasty started from Warlords not far beyond some bandits, so this is plausible.  --[Falmer] Invasion could occur, but would likely be over a longer span of time. They would be by themselves & only have minimal progress if any.  An invasion from High Rock may be an unexpected but plausible story if anyone was to potentially ally with the Dominion/ get more political power. I say High Rock as well since most of their population is Breton, coming from Elven & [mainly] Human lineage. Bretons could be dealing with identity issues given recent conflicts such as Talos worship/the Skyrim Civil War, so ìt would not be surprising to see some ally with Mer & Thalmor. They also have issues with other neighboring races such as Orcs & Redguards (which Skyrim gives a lot of attention to). Invasion from anywhere else may be unlikely. -Much like an invasion from High Rock, Forsworn & Reachmen also pose dangers in their own right. They could ravage the Reach [around Skyrim] & maybe spark trouble in High Rock as well. Forsworn will likely continue fighting Nords for some time to come, even if they take back Markarth & the Reach. It is unlikely they could or keep ìt for long, so they would continue their scorched earth campaigns, thus worsening famines, shortages, & disasters around Skyrim.  -Finally, while the Dragonborn may defend Skyrim, they might end up travelling somewhere far away like Atmora & return at an unknown time. The leaders of Skyrim would either die or live cautiously untìl they passed with age or assassination. All major leaders will probably die, disappear (often legendarily), or fade away from history."
teslore,3c4wag,DewiMorgan,1 point,Sun Jul 5 05:19:55 2015 UTC,"I thought about Vampires.  The trouble with Dawnguard is that, like the Civil War, it presents the player with a choice.   In the past, quests have tended to be framed as Do or Ignore. That's useful from the Lore point of view since we can say with some confidence that Mannimarco was defeated due to the sacrifice of Hannibal Traven and possibly note that some accounts suggest the involvment of the Champion of Cyrodiil.  With Dawnguard though, while we can say with certainty that Harkon was destroyed, we can't really say whether his entire faction was wiped clean by the Dawnguard, of whether it was the Dawnguard themselves that were destroyed. Of course, any (non-vampiric) Civil War nullifying event will probably render that particular point moot as well.  So, if we're talking about Auriel's Bow and Bloodcursed Arrows then that's probably going to mean the bow being stolen. Which could work.  The problem there, of course, is that there's no reason to suppose that the the effects of the Bloodcursed Arrows are local to Skyrim. So any resurgence of vampires would on a global scale. So we can't use that to destablise Skyrim without doing the same to the Empire and the Dominon both (although they may be in better shape to weather the event).  Still, it would provide a reasonable excuse for the Akaviri to invade :)"

Bretons could be dealing with many identity issues given recent conflicts, so ìt would not be surprising to see many ally with Mer & Thalmor.    What?!  The Bretons are damn near human, practically human. Their culture has been absent of Altmer veneration since - arguably since they've existed. A few gods do not equal veneration.   They also have issues with other neighboring races such as Orcs & Redguards (which Skyrim gives a lot of attention to)   Not sure about the Orcs but if you are referring to the situation in Crown Dragonstar, that is one city-state, unless Skaven and Elinhir decides to get involved.   --Climatic Chaos/ Famine   Plausible. Atmora unfreezing in time, if that is a thing, and some vengeful remnant of Tiber Septim or whatever comes with an undeadish army to conquer Tamriel as war between the provinces...I've been watching too much GoT, as shitty as season give may have been."
teslore,3c4wag,n60storm4,1 point,Sun Jul 5 06:17:42 2015 UTC,"I do see you have some points. Regarding Bretons & them being very much/mostly Human, one must not forget how divided & violent High Rock has been. If there is something that could set them off, ìt could be as fundemental as their lineage & beliefs. It seems hard to thìnk that they would all-but abandon veneration & appreciation of their Elven ancestors, especially given the rise of Mer about Tamriel. One must remember that the land of Hjalti Early-Beard/Tiber Septim/Talos is on Thalmor minds, whom wish to diminish if not erase his legacy. While many Bretons would abhor this and staunchly oppose, others would not care, & still some others may actually acknowledge Thalmor views. It is hard to say how this can turn out or who/how many take sides.  Something as simple as heritage can be an influencing factor in how some Bretons act versus others. An example of an inherited culture that seems to venerate the past would be Reachman populations. While they may be seen by some as savages, they clearly have had trouble adjusting to change. Reachmen are not only violent in Skyrim, but have even been similar within the borders of High Rock. There may be more populations that share the struggles of Reachmen around High Rock as well.  Bretons are very competitive, so some may try & use anything to gain the upper hand, whether that be allegiances/outside influences, [society-wide] propaganda (where amount of Elven heritage & tension over political/spiritual issues like Talos worship get heavy), & espionage.  The possibility of more direct Direnni descendants are quite plausible to still exist & could carry out some old customs. These populations may also by chance have ancestor worship (not unheard of in Elven cultures; like Dunmeri), but in any case may still find some reason to sympathize with Thalmor & resent the Empire. Such things are likely known by the Thalmor, whom want to find every chance they get to weaken the Empire, Talos worshippers, & the eventual obsolesence of humankind.  Finally, regarding other races/non-Bretons, areas of conflict you mentioned could very well resurge violently. Trust & cooperation between Bretons is already thin without adding outsiders like Redguards. There also would be at least some [minimal] population diversity in High Rock, given what is seen in other Imperial provinces, which some natives may not like. High Rock would host some number of Nords, Imperials, Redguards, Orcs, & maybe even [very remote] populations of Falmer/Snow Elves among others. This could actually amplify issues amongs citizens of High Rock. In all, High Rock is not somewhere one could easy find conclusions to, but is somewhere one might get lost in."
teslore,3c4wag,dryarmor,2,Sun Jul 5 08:26:25 2015 UTC,"If we don't get to kill Thalmor in the Next game we will see a book depicting events from when the empire and the thalmor clashed. Human Armies with their backs against the wall, the something happens and that something turns the tide of the battle and is then ascribed to the holy influence of Talos.  That Book would say that the armies of the humans would be from the 4th empire of men. It won't be specific how that came to be; either Ulfric won and he knew the thalmor would attack and so he'd court anything that could be courted into an alliance against the thalmor. Which would then be several Kingdoms under one Crown, kinda like an empire. I figure ulfric doesn't have ambitions to be emperor, his sight doesn't extend eastmarch by much... If the imperials won the civil war, the Empire would pull itself together and consolidate power.

At the very top, encompassing all else, I place the Godhead, the blank dreamscape, that which all else distinguishes itself within. It has no inherent concepts except the rules that enable Dreams.

teslore,3c4r3c,andyysplash,3,Sat Jul 4 21:20:06 2015 UTC,"does that mean cross-Dream travel or communication is possible via Dreamsleeve? Obviously there may be language barriers   Funny you should mention that...   Trans-Amaranth Travel as a Whopping Big Memospore  In Part II, I discussed Trans-Amaranth travel as making use of the symbolic ties between Amaranths, which are formed through Memory.  But I wasn't very clear on the mechanics, because, at the time, I didn't have a solid idea as to how it would work.  Imagine yourself as a Trans-Amaranth traveler, and the continental symbols as giant I/O ports, matched up by their symbolic similarity.  You're sailing for a distant port, more distant than anyone who doesn't understand the Godhead could realize.  But what does the ocean symbolize?  The Void between Amaranths, the Dreamsleeve.  Crossing the ocean is integral to the process of Trans-Amaranth travel, because it symbolizes crossing the Dreamsleeve, just as the points of departure and arrival, the continents, symbolize the Amaranths.  The whole time, you're pushing this symbolism out into the the Dreamsleeve.  It's forming a transient orderly system within the Dreamsleeve, a giant bolt of a memospore, a coherent beam of information that homes in on its most similar point out in the Godhead, the receiving symbol of the destination Amaranth.  For the duration of the bridge, those Amaranths are joined as one, by a shining laser of ideas."

Reality is actually hard to call fake because its the yardstick by which you measure reality/fantasy in the first place. To be ""fake"" is either invalid logic, or demands and external perspective that is ""real"" to contrast with the fake. For that matter being in the Matrix isn't really a problem for your own basic existence if your aware of Descartes, because you are clearly still real by default and must be to be experiencing the dream.   Coming to terms with actual fakeness is rather more poignant in the meta-narrative. You must either accept you are not your PC... then assert that doesn't matter you still are because screw reality  So in all this zero-summing is also... refusing the meta-narrative's existence as just as important."

Most people think its Anu as the world of the Arena is a place of war and sorrow and death, as would reflect a heart-broken man. In consideration with the story of Anu and Padome and Nir. Now granted the Anuad is allegorical, but think of deism. Deism is the belief that you can understand the nature of God by understanding the nature of his creation. As we know the Dream is the Godhead, it makes sense that the Dream should reflect him. The only story we have of the universe before ANY creation, not even Aurbis existed yet, in the void was Anu the Everything, as he is named. Plus, it's just a romantic story to have a world plagued with rife and death to be the reflection of a man who lost his love and was betrayed by his brother. And we love romantic stories."

There's going to be more than a few updates to old Lesson commentaries in the New Whirling School thanks to this. I'm not too far in, but one passage I particularly enjoy:   I see a gray rock face along which I sink into great depths. I stand in black dirt up to my ankles in a dark cave. Shadows sweep over me. I am seized by fear, but I know I must go in. I crawl through a narrow crack in the rock and reach an inner cave whose bottom is covered with black water. But beyond this I catch a glimpse of a luminous red stone which I must reach. I wade through the muddy water. The cave is full of the frightful noise of shrieking voices. I take the stone, it covers a dark opening in the rock. I hold the stone in my hand, peering around inquiringly. I do not want to listen to the voices, they keep me away. But I want to know. Here something wants to be uttered. I place my ear to the opening. I hear the flow of underground waters. I see the bloody head of a man on the dark stream. Someone wounded, someone slain floats there. I take in this image for a long time, shuddering. I see a black scarab floating past on the dark stream.  In the deepest reach of the stream shines a red sun radiating through the dark water. There I see - and a terror seizes me - small serpents on the dark rock walls, striving toward the depths, where the sun shines. A thousand serpents crowd around, veiling the sun. Deep night falls. A red stream of blood, thick red blood springs up, surging for a long time, then ebbing. I am seized by fear. What did I see?   Is it Elder Scrolls relevant? Here's a hint: the head is the head of the hero Sigfried, the famous Germanic hero archetype, who must be killed so that the next generation may take its place."

But in the good way, I guess, cos I hung out with cousins and did an MTG draft with friends and talked more extensively with family members and such and such. Also I just came back from my brother's Bar Miztvah party, which was fun.  Anyway, other stuff. You may have noticed alongside the not having done much with the 30K thing and not updating the compilation we've also kind of ignored the whole reddit-wide blackout thing. Prince and I literally have not exchanged a word about the subject so I'm not exactly talking from any official or professional capacity here, but I like to think that we view /r/teslore as more of a semi-isolated community that uses reddit as a platform than part of reddit proper and its community, and as such didn't really think to join the protests.

And once he is ready, he travels to the surface of Masser to do the deed of ending the Numidium’s life. (https://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/2osikn/numidium_the_prisoner/)   If it is true my theory becomes much more likely . In coda: Lorkhan ( Numidium + heart) is the limit which hinders jubal to become the new amaranth. The numiduim isn't the Godhead , it is the corrections officer Lorkhan.     2Edit : Lorkhan as a correction officer makes sense since he wants to maintain the prison of mundus. Jubal's new amaranth ,however, would destroy the kalpa cycle.  The contradiction between refugee (jubal) and correction officer( Lorkhan) leads to a fight. Let me explain:  Lorkhan had to damage Nirn's defense system (races,heroes) because alduin was too weak to start a new kalpa. Mundus isn't a self-preserving system meaning that souls are to escape for example by worshiping a daedric prince. By and by too many prisoners were able to flee. On the other hand technologies advanced in way which allowed mortal to defend themselves efficiently against dragons as well as other threats. In addition to that a mortal life become longer and longer due to technologies. The Goal of Sithis's house was it to kill ideas so that new ideas can life. (In this regard)Technologies brought more static into Mundus.  Moreover: A prison which has no prisoner doesn't make any sense"

Creation ain't a big deal to them, or to the Daedra.  It's the cost involved with Mundus in particular that scared them off of it.  That said, ""Star-Made Knight"" could also refer to Aedric aspects, if the title is using a more general definition of ""star"" that includes other celestial bodies, like plane(t)s.  Poetic license, and all that.  The question of who actually made Pelinal is hard to answer.  All we know is that he's from the future and was sent by Kyne in response to Alessia's prayer.  As for your actual question:   Still, how did Lorkhan's soul end up inside a synthetic being? Robots aren't born, they are made.   Being a fashioned robot doesn't preclude you from having a soul, especially not in a setting like that of TES.

One of the Emperor's heirs impersonated him, had his father killed (on the old man's own orders) and left a double to be removed, tying up loose ends.   The line of succession is freed from the burden of Mede's signing of the Concordant, Montierre is outed as a Dominion spy who arranged to have the Emperor murdered and is unable to argue otherwise, and the Emperor is given an open reason to start the War without looking like the aggressors."

There are also likely many who survived the war in Cyrodiil who are not looking forward to living through that again. Not EVERYONE condemned Mede for signing the concordant, and there are always political forces that have to be dealt with when conducting any war.

He has schemed, scrabbled, murdered and betrayed his way up the ladder and acheived the 'Better Self' that Veloth envisioned when he seperated from the stagnant Aldmer.   On a personal level, Vivec only loves himself, and Nerevar (and his incarnates...). But he very much stands by the concept and the ideal of the Velothi people, because he is living proof that they are right."
teslore,3c34xt,Lachdonin,10,Sat Jul 4 08:54:37 2015 UTC,"Vivec's love is tough, but he does care about the Dunmer. He allowed Baar Dau to fall because he believed such a catastrophe will in the end reshape Dunmeri society for the better. Asshole or not, it's Vivec we're talking about, and he knows what he is doing. Does he regret what happened to his people? Knowing him, the answer is probably both yes and no. ""Vivec knew that his doubt made him the sword of the Triune"". He probably thought twice before making the move. I also believe Red Year was Vivec's way of warning the Dunmer of the dangers of disbelieving. Know love to avoid the Landfall.  And let's not forget Vivec is the only deity to have spoken to mortals about CHIM and the Tower. While most of the Lessons aren't easy to decipher, you don't need to decipher all of them to get the main message. ""Proceed only with the simplest terms, for all others are enemies and will confuse you."" are Vivec's own words on this matter. Some of the Sermons (Sermon 21, for example) are surprisingly straightforward, so straightforward that even a commoner could tell Vivec is a whole different kind of god, greater than the others. The Dunmer were privileged, yet strangely ignorant of their god's teachings."
teslore,3c34xt,War_Psyence,9,Sat Jul 4 09:13:25 2015 UTC,"Vivec honored the Dunmer people with the ability to suffer and evolve. Stagnation is death. He said himself in TES III that Redoran was his favorite House. Don't believe me, fire up the game and ask him yourself. All this was intentional, and it makes the Dunmer stronger.   edit: also  “Later, and by that I mean much, much later, my reign will be seen as an act of the highest love, which is a return from the astral destiny and the marriages between. By that I mean the catastrophes, which will come from all five corners. Subsequent are the revisions, differentiated between hope and the distraught, situations that are only required by the periodic death of the immutable. Cosmic time is repeated: I wrote of this in an earlier life. An imitation of submersion is love's premonition, its folly into the underworld, by which I mean the day you will read about outside of yourself in an age of gold. For on that day, which is a shadow of the sacrificial concept, all history is obliged to see me for what you are: in love with evil.”"
teslore,3c34xt,Cyclenophus,4,Sat Jul 4 14:19:24 2015 UTC,"Vivec is a horrible person in almost every regard. However, I believe he does genuinely care about the Dunmer people, or at least he did pre Dagoth Ur. He's done a lot for the Dunmer. He led the Dunmer resistance against the Imperials in the Four-Score War, he avoided war with Tiber Septim while at the same time preserving Dunmer culture and autonomy, he's fought against Daedra trying to destroy parts of Morrowind, and he's done more still.  However, once Dagoth Ur returned I think he turned his attention to himself. He helped the Nerevarine primarily because he knew Dagoth Ur had the ability to overtake him eventually. He abandoned the Dunmer people by leaving Baar Dau to fall to Vivec which caused the Red Year. So from my perspective he cared about the Dunmer people right up until the point where he was in danger. He probably still does care for the Dunmer in a way, but now he's what matters most."

As a person who was first drawn to Skyrim because of the Dovah language (and the alphabet in particular), I was rather disappointed to see just how closely Dovahzul words are mapped to English ones.  For example, let's look at how the word ""that"" is used in The Song of the Dragonborn:   And the voice, he did wield, on that glorious field / Ahrk fin zul, rok drey kod, nau tol morokei frod That when brothers wage war come unfurled! / Tol fod zeymah win kein meyz fundein!   These are two completely different meanings of the word ""that"", and yet they are translated using the same word in both cases, and with sentence structure identical to English.  You can do similar comparisons with other common, multipurpose words (for example: to=wah, at=ahst, for=fah, of=do), and find that there often seems to be a one-to-one mapping between words, when really it should be many-to-many.  On a plus side, this does make the language a lot more accessible, for example by allowing for automatic translation. It also appears that the thuum.org people are attempting to add some more unique features to it, however.  ...and grammar notwithstanding, it still looks and sounds ster-reym, and I don't think I'll ever get The Song of the Dragonborn out of my head."
teslore,3c4agr,MareloRyan,1 point,Sun Jul 5 21:36:15 2015 UTC,"What I meant by that was that the vocabulary has no formulaic transformation from English to Dovahzul, as in, there's no way to know what a given English word will be in Dovahzul without an example.  The phonology and morphology aren't mapped in a consistent, predictable way, which means you can't just automatically know how to say something in Dovahzul by knowing how to say it in English, as the person I was responding to seemed to think."

To make it, they did map certain English phonemes to certain Dovahzul phonemes, or at least a very few of them, specifically in order to make the text both rhyme and fit the meter in both languages.  But they apparently did not continue this practice for the rest of the Dovahzul vocabulary, nor did they respect those mappings elsewhere.  And even within the song, this breaks down; for becomes FAH, whereas fore- becomes PROD, and for- becomes MAH, just for example.  And, to be entirely fair, they did have a game to make, as opposed to a fleshed-out conlang :P"

He considers himself an artisan. An absolute master of his craft. Better at sorcery and especially necromancy than anyone else, especially any human. He is, in fact, very very powerful as a mage. When he's fighting you on his turf, without any disadvantages, he should be harder to take down than the toughest Dragon. He can teleport. He can throw up powerful barriers. He can poison or paralyze with a touch. He can magically Silence you. He can summon and reanimate the undead again and again, better than any other mage ever could.   2 - He's not just ""bwahaha evillll"". Don't write him as a cartoon super villain. His main motivation in life has been to destroy the Mages Guild that Galerion built, because of ideological reasons. He feels they are holding Tamriel back, magically/scientifically, in their narrow-minded bans on Necromancy and other forms of summoning and dark arts. Just because they were disbanded early in the 4th era doesn't mean his crusade is quite over yet, by the way. None of the existing magical schools on Tamriel with the exception of those of the Sload live up to his ideals of freedom of expression and experimentation. His crusade in mortal form against censorship and closed-minded thinking is his main motivation as a person.  3 - His reasons for becoming a god were not entirely selfish, to that end. He merged with the Necromancer's Moon to create a new god, and make it easier for mortal necromancers to create Black Soul Gems. While necromancy does make these people more powerful, and their worship of the black moon makes Mannimarco more powerful as a god, there is still the ideological reason. His hatred for Galerion is only eclipsed by his hatred for the righteous Divines, especially Arkay, whom he detests above all others. He truly feels Arkay is a wicked spirit, whose closed-minded refusal to allow mortal spirits to be captured without black soul gems holds back the perfection of sorcery as a discipline. Thus, Mannimarco the god is seen as a rebellious scholar's deity of sorts. The more articulate of his followers will argue that he represents not only power, but the advancement of knowledge that could benefit society as a whole."

There is no evidence they could have intervened in the Argonian Invasion. The Daedra are largely seperated from their mortall followers because of the barriers of Mundus. Even when they cam be summoned, they are not all powerful.  Azura, at least, DID attempt to save Dunmer lives prior to the Red Year, in the only way she could. She sent visions to her faithful, to gather as many as they could and flee to Skyrim. We're told this by one of those very priests at the Azura shrine in Skyrim.   You are also seeming to miss the core social identity of the Velothi. Betterment through adversity. The Daedra showed them that Mundus is a place of trials, of struggle and pain and conflict, but it is also a place of purpose. You face adversity, and of you survive, you become stronger. The entire culture of the Velothi is centered around living in the harshness of Nirn to become better than what they were.   The Tribunal coddled them. Protected them out of a misguided love or indulgent ego. The Daedra don't treat them like children. They (mostly) treat them like students. They are expected to find the answers, and is that struggle that defines them. The Daedra give them the tools, but figuring out how to use them to survive is all on the Velothi.   Look at Vivec. Of the Tribunal, he is the only one who acheived more. Why? Not because he was content and pampered. Because he rose through adversity and agony. Almalexia and Sotha Sil were both highborn, but Vivec was not. He knew how to scrabble and pick and stab his way to the top. He understood what the Daedra teach, and he is the only one who truely acheived greatness, by first struggling through adversity and SURVIVING."

She may have only been able to send these visions to a few people, so why not the Grand Council or House leaders? They have the power to evacuate Vvardenfell.  I do agree that the culture of the ancient Chimer is centered around survival on ones own, that's not always turned out to be the better for the Chimer/Dunmer. Being treated like children by the Tribunal certainly did more to help than being abandoned by two out of three of your gods. Under the Tribunal the Dark Elves did become better than what they were. It was a time of goodness and prosperity (excluding the Four-Score War and the late Third Era).  In a perfect world the Dark Elves could have kept following the philosophies of Velothi culture and have been prosperous - but it's not a perfect world.

She may have only been able to send these visions to a few people, so why not the Grand Council or House leaders? They have the power to evacuate Vvardenfell.   First off... The transformation of the Chimer into the Dunmer was before Vivec worked his mojo, violated Azura and locked her out of Mundus permanently. All she can do any-more is talk to people, she can't manifest or interact in any way. She couldn't even retrieve her own Star from a mortal. Second... how do we know she didn't warn the Great Houses? All we are told is that she warned many, and some listened. Considering the rather well known egotism and indecision of the Great Houses, it's possible they just didn't listen. In fact, they seemed unable to respond in any way against the Argonians too, until Redoran finally stepped up and regrouped.    Being treated like children by the Tribunal certainly did more to help than being abandoned by two out of three of your gods.   Did it? They became the very things they hated. They became Aldmer, driven by tradition and orthodoxy, riven with stagnancy. Even the Morag Tong, their main institution for political change, was often frowned upon or outright banned. Just because people are well fed, live long and are at peace doesn't mean they're better off. Better off is defined by your social ideal, and the Velothi were anti-stagnancy, but under the Tribunal all they HAD was stagnancy.   Vivec was successful because he knew how to survive, yes. However, he was one person who achieved godhood, not an entire race abandoned by their old gods torn apart by war.   But consider how Vivec was part of the reason WHY the Velothi stopped following the practices of their ancestors. He was, for a good portion of his reign, part of the problem. And then, towards the end, he seemed to realise that he was wrong. That he was responsible for the stagnation of the Velothi and part of the reason why only he seemed to have achieved their goal.  The Tribunal were the reason that Vivec was alone in having achieved godhood. And he realised this. He even set the stage for changing that mistake."

The reason the Great Houses did not respond to an Argonians invasion was because they had no standing army. The Legions of the Empire had withdrew leaving Morrowind extremely vulnerable. As for the Great Houses not listening, at that point they had renounced the Tribunal as their gods and started worshiping Azura again, so why wouldn't they listen? Besides, there's no evidence Azura had sent them visions. it would be more in character for a Daedric Prince, even Azura, to send visions to the most faithful or some such nonsense.   Better off is defined by your social ideal, and the Velothi were anti-stagnancy, but under the Tribunal all they HAD was stagnancy.   Under the Tribunal the Dunmer mostly eliminated Velothi culture.

A guess you could say it was for revenge, but if he'd realized his mistake then he wouldn't have done what he did to Azura, because in the end it would have benefited the Dunmer.

Their ideal hadn't change though. It had just been subverted by three egotists who told them that they could achieve divinity THROUGH the Tribunal. Which was patently false. The Tribunal lied to the Dunmer to feed their own thirst for adoration, stifiling the Velothi drive for betterment under falsehoods.   If Vivec had realized this wrong doing and wanted the Dunmer to change, why did he let Baar Dau still fall?    Because it was just what the Dunmer needed. It ended the dominance of ALMSIVI and portrayed the Tribunal as false gods of finite power who had held the Dunmer back. Even 200 years later, there are still those in the Temple who favour the Tribunal, so it's not like, even with the display of Baan Dau, the power of ALMSIVI persists, albeit as a shadow of its former self. Vivec understood that he would have to permit, even facilitate, horrible things to put the Dunmer back on track. And that included cutting them off from the one Daedra who had shown a tendency to protect them. Plus, he's a dick and didn't like her, so it had the added bonus of feeding his ego."

teslore,3bztbj,YodaGandalfDumbled0r,12,Fri Jul 3 14:10:02 2015 UTC,"There was recently a discussion on different types of governments in Tamriel here that you might find interesting.  I think the closest thing Tamriel has to a democracy or republic is post-Tribunal Morrowind. After the Red Year House Redoran took over and now leads the Grand Council. The Grand Council is the governing entity of Morrowind made up of officials from all the Great Houses. Currently House Redoran, House Indoril, House Dres, House Telvanni, and House Sadras are on the Grand Council. As far as I know Morrowind has no monarch and is ruled by this group of people, so it is similar to a republic or oligarchy. However, these officials are not elected, but rather earn the position by being a member of a Great House.  While Cyrodiil has the Elder Council, they operate under the Emperor, who is a monarch. That said I wouldn't really count the Empire as a democracy or republic. Think of them as England when the monarchy still held most of the power.  Morrowind in the Fourth Era is the closest thing to a democracy in my opinion. That's quite a feet considering that not 250 years ago they were ruled by three fanatical, power-hungry, tyrannical gods who had nearly unlimited power over Morrowind."
teslore,3bztbj,Watosh66,6,Fri Jul 3 14:34:31 2015 UTC,"While Cyrodiil has the Elder Council, they operate under the Emperor, who is a monarch.    Not to mention they aren't elected officials. The Elder Council represents the different monarchs and nobility throughout Tamriel. The Jarls, the King of Bretony, the Great Houses, the Counts of Cyrodiil, and I presume the other regional leaders all appoint councilors to represent them. It's more like the House of Lords in England than the House of Commons.   Also, Morrowind has a King, who is basically a figurehead for the Great Houses, who are unelected."
teslore,3bztbj,cfmacleod,1 point,Sat Jul 4 00:02:40 2015 UTC,"I've heard that Morrowind had a vassal Imperial king when the Empire still had legions there, but as of the Fourth Era I don't remember any mention of this."

His power is derived from his bloodline. The Empire backed the current dynasty, the decedents of Barenzhia, but they still have power in their own right. There is no reason to think that the King has been done away with. Unless there is specific lore that says he is gone, I imagine this isn't the case."
teslore,3bztbj,cfmacleod,1 point,Sat Jul 4 00:44:50 2015 UTC,"True, but as indicated in Dragonborn the Grand Council has all the power and the monarchy had very little.

teslore,3bztbj,Watosh66,2,Sat Jul 4 01:25:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah, probably. It's more like the way the way the monarch of England was circa 1600's, when the House of Lords was running things. The King still has some power and respect I imagine, unlike today where almost no one cares."
teslore,3bztbj,cfmacleod,2,Sat Jul 4 01:41:23 2015 UTC,"Morrowind could also be comparable in some ways to changes found in Japan. Starting as few tribes coming into Morrowind & Resdayn, they initial were small, but some collectivized & others (Ashlanders) apparently kept to themselves leaning more towards Democracy than their peers. Newly formed Houses grew into great ones as many wars ensued, many of them with Dwemer & Nords. When some of their greatest enemies fell back, Morrowind fell under Dictatorship by the Tribunal (the most powerful Lords, especially Nerevar). Morrowind truly united, eventually getting a ""King"" & then rule by the Emperor of Tamriel. This somewhat mimicks the changes in Japan from Fuedalism, to Daimyo（大名）/Shogun-style（将軍の政府） government (Federalist Military regime), & then into a Monarchy/Empire.  Now into the 4th Era, the Empire is essentially gone from Morrowind, some Great Houses get politically removed, & a Council of Great Houses resides & fills in any power gaps left over. Some Houses may even run more Democratically [than another House/time] by voting for various policies; they may also elect their representatives & Council Members/leaders. This is similar in some regards to early-modern Japan, which was ran largely by military Generals & high officials with respect given to a largely figurehead Monarch. Even that said, Japan did grow into a Parliamentary Governing System, much like a Democratic-Republic Monarchy.  -Perhaps given some time, Morrowind could progess even more as a society & their people gain more a voice alongside growing Freedoms/Rights."

The main problem with democracy is that you need to a) educate everyone enough to be able to vote properly and b) get everyones vote somehow, which is really hard without large scale messaging system. I can't see any of the provinces becoming democratic, and also, I really don't want it to.   What ever happened to the Arena? When did Tamriel move from a crap hole of death and war to an idealized, white washed fairy tale? Everyone seems so happy, and rich, and well fed. If any country became democratic, I would probably block that from my head canon."
teslore,3bztbj,cfmacleod,2,Sat Jul 4 03:05:50 2015 UTC,"One can often forget that when a land becomes Democratic, many problems of Government can still remain. There is such thing as tyranny of the majority. It is also safe to say that Tamriel would still stay as an Arena, even if one land did become a Democracy.  Corruption, inside conflicts, foreign powers, & inefficient Administration can all lead to instability. Things would still be chaotic at times.  -Also, has the Empire (united & all) kept Tamriel from conflict & intrigue? Definately not, with High Rock [before the Warp in the West] being a prime example."

Highrock is great example of how ""progress"" is often a nominal occurrence."
teslore,3bztbj,cfmacleod,3,Sat Jul 4 23:36:32 2015 UTC,"Basically, there are hints of democratic principles in some institutions of the nobility in various places (the Moot, Grand Council, Elder Council, etc.), but there's no recognition of the people as sovereign in Tamriel. No recognition that all people are created equal. That's essentially a prerequisite for achieving widespread democracy.  There is one exception that I know of: according to Schick, some Ashlander tribes will choose their new Ashkhan/Wise Woman by voting. That seems to be the closest thing to a democratic way of life in Tamriel which has been revealed thus far."
teslore,3bztbj,Minor_Edits,3,Fri Jul 3 15:03:00 2015 UTC,"As Skitterleaper already said, there is a difference between democracy and a republic. I'm gonna go even further and say that they actually have nothing to do with each other at all. The Elder Council is a non-democratic, representative body, which is filled with members appointed by Tamriel's nobility. On the other side, small towns historically elected a patron elder, but definitely had no representatives. That being said, Tamriel does have a form of democracy, though it's not what you'd expect.  Because there are no conscripted armies in the Empire (or none that we have seen), you can fight for whomever you like. When you join the Stormcloaks, you are declaring yourself for Ulfric. It may not be the civilized form of democracy we have today, but in many ways it's just as fair. It basically boils down to, ""every sword is a vote."""

If I may add to this, ìt could also be each resource or every Septim (Money) is really the [biggest] vote.[?]   Absolutely, this is why tax-funded armies were the first stepping stone to democracy. When you were paying for war, you cared a lot more about how it was being conducted and why.    figures like the Last Dragonborn would/could play very important roles in the political Arena other than through fighting (Popular Hero & role Model, politician, or tyrant).   I would say this is already the case. The true advantage of having the LDB isn't in his/her fighting. He/she can only be in one place at a time, and a group of 30 men could still take him/her out. The real advantage would be the symbol. It's why Ulfric fought on the front line at the Battle of Solitude, and Tulius at the Battle of Windhelm. Like Galmor said, they want the story, not just to pump their ego, but also as a tool to govern. Most people will never meet the LDB, or Ulfric, or Tulius, but they will hear the stories, and the stories will keep them in line."
teslore,3bztbj,cfmacleod,3,Sat Jul 4 23:44:04 2015 UTC,"Republic  Democracy   Pick one.  Ahehe. Sorry, common misconception; a Republic and a Democracy are actually different government types. In a Democracy all government decisions have to be ratified by essentially calling a referendum and asking all voters how to proceed; there is also usually a minimum voter turnout (or ""Quorum"") required as well.   You may notice that this is a terrible way to govern anything larger than a small town, so most so-called democracies actually prefer a Republic, where the voters elect representatives to vote on their behalf. In this way, we can actually get things done, but it's vulnerable to said representatives lying through their teeth in order to be elected and then going against what their electorate want... but then again, as we find out from Ancient Athens, even in a true Democracy this happened anyway as especially persuasive politicians were able to cause the masses to vote in their favour through deliberate misinformation, charismatic speeches or just outright bribery.  The herd mentality is a hell of a thing.  Anyway, Classics lesson aside, I thought that during the events of Oblivion at least the Empire was a form of republic, with the High Council making decisions overseen by the Emperor. Depending on the level of power the Emperor wielded this could be anything from a feudalistic monarchy right up to a Constitutional Monarchy like the current UK government, where the monarch is technically the head of state but is still beholden to the whims of Parliament."
teslore,3bztbj,Skitterleaper,3,Fri Jul 3 20:26:28 2015 UTC,"Not so; historical definitions are irrelevant to modern definitions. By modern definition a democracy is any form of government including election or elected officials; this includes republics, but is not limited to them. Classical Athens is a long way from what we would recognise as democracy anyway, considering the harsh limits on who had the right to vote."

Something like this will make it easier for us as players to learn that there's going to be a boss at the end of most dungeons. This is actually a good design idea on the part of Bethesda."

That said, given the low Imperial presence and the Dunmer proclivity for old ways, I'd say it's likely that slaves are still kept in some places. Probably much fewer Argonian slaves though...

Also as I said before funny that this is brought up as for my RP, I have a Dragonborn turned Lich who realizes with decay will come the loss of his ability to use the Thu'um as he would no longer beable to inhale air from the lack of lungs and a tongue so he seeks godhood via reloacating the Heart of Lorkhan as a cure to his seemingly unwanted lichdom."

That's hardly what you'd want as a vampire, so for all intents and purposes they do require blood to keep their humanity intact.

Her tomb sounds like it's meant to be some kind of cryogenic chamber rather than her literally sleeping. So she would be in some kind of stasis, therefore not needing blood since she's in suspended animation. As for game mechanics - she's meant to be a follower and followers can't really just go off and feed. Firstly because that would be something else to add to the game (and deadlines cut loads) and secondly because followers are meant to just sorta be there.

The Walking Ways are more potent than mere life-extension, but, by way of the Second Walking Way, you could get so good at whatever method of life-extension you use that you transform into something truly immortal.  As for what can provide life-extension short of apotheosis, that would include vampirism, and both Restoration and Necromancy, as you've mentioned.  But there are probably also alchemical routes, which might fall under Restoration or Necromancy, depending on how you classify things.

This would make sense, since they're acting as enforcers of the will of the Mundane gods of Time, who try their best to apply Time to Mundus and its occupants in a way that makes sense, at least to them.  Numidium and other large-scale breaks were probably just too much for them to handle, which is why they're known as breaks in the first place instead of as business per usual.

The void is as irrelevant to the Aurbis as the space beyond the universe is to real-world astronomy. It's just not really a thing, even in a metaphorical sense, the pretensions of the Dark Brotherhood notwithstanding. Sithis is the active principle of Padomay, and basically acts as entropy in the Mundus. It is not sapient, but it is embodied by Lorkhan, who very much is.   It's complicated, but think of it as a descending scale from Idea to Manifestation to God. Death is the idea, a corpse is the manifestation, Hades (or whoever) is the god. None of these things are the same, obviously, and it's the same way with TES.   Stasis and entropy - the ideas - are Anu and Padomay.   Preservation and decay - manifestations, among others - are Anuiel and Sithis.   And the gods of order and chaos, who personify the above yet are not synonymous with them, are Auriel and Lorkhan.    he has to be sentient in order for the Aurbis to exist   Exactly the opposite. God - whether the unnamed and unknowable Godhead or Anu who locally supplants it - is by definition not conscious because it is dreaming. Indeed, and this gets into territory beyond even my knowledge of TES mysticism, the process of renouncing and transcending personal consciousness, which is slightly similar to the Buddhist notion of Nirvana now that I think about it, is integral to becoming an Amaranth and usurping the role of the Dreamer."

The ones who actually accompany you to tombs or mention the tombs definitely have a problem with looters.   Thing is, they don't exactly police them, because they have built-in defenses, and are filled to the brim with the walking dead. It's not immediately obvious to someone in a small village if the sword or ruby you're peddling off to them was looted from a 6000 year old tomb of some Skald king or Dragon priest, either. It's not like there's a big sign on it saying ""this was up a dead dude's butthole."""
teslore,3by0z3,Cyclenophus,2,Fri Jul 3 02:35:49 2015 UTC,"How can a guard see you in a barrow? They don't wander away from their positions unless there's a threat to the hold in close proximity (bandits, vampires, a dragon etc.)"
teslore,3by0z3,Indelvarn,3,Fri Jul 3 08:45:02 2015 UTC,"But in Ivarstead you do a service to the town by killing the crazy ghost guy who thinks he's destined to guard the barrow. Also, as said in a comment by /u/Minor_Edits, looting is part of your payment for agreeing to delve into a drauger-filled dungeon to find a rusty family sword for some guy you barely know."
teslore,3by0z3,Indelvarn,14,Fri Jul 3 12:06:39 2015 UTC,"Looting was how soldiers and mercenaries got paid back in the medieval days. You may have received a salary or contract price, but it was understood that raping and plundering was like your bonus commission. That was standard operation procedure for far later in history that some may think, and there are still parallels to be made in modern warfare. When someone sends you into a ruin to perform a typical quest, there's a good argument to be made that they expect and understand that you will walk away with as much treasure as you can carry. I recall a quest or two in Skyrim where someone remarks on you looting their ancestors, but they don't really stop you, which is telling.  Maybe this is more like pillaging than grave-robbing. The theory I've been going with is that the draugr do some mining or other value creation, and the Nords treat them as sort of a renewable resource. The draugr collect goods from the ground or from failed adventurers, and eventually some better adventurer comes around to clear the place out, getting some valuable training at the same time. Then, another shift of draugr rise to repair their brethren and begin the cycle again. The Nords may not be wiping out the draugr because they have better things to do; it may be because they're using the draugr as a sort of quasi-labor force."

No TES game I've ever played has tried to make the Bosmer pretty Orlando Blooms; in Oblivion they are pretty much on the same potato level as everyone else, but most male Bosmer characters in that game are foolish, irritating, or otherwise impossible to tale seriously.

Also so I'm going to get a bunch of unique options for character design for Bosmer males but toggle the binary gender slider and they disappear... this totally gives me a reason to play Bosmer females in particular.  Not that I think such would survive to implementation in a game. Just look at the Khajiit. All that moon phase stuff is mildly interesting but in practice its hard to keep straight, we know jack squat about many of the types, and for what... you can take the trouble to understand Elseweyr only to then fully appreciate how little of it you actually get.   Of course my sympathy for the developers on not implementing that. I'd imagine that would be a lot of work for what is (lets be honest) one of the less important races and a human audience is quite naturally going to gravitate toward humans anyways. And what the differences are going to be purely aesthetic, nobody really cares if you're a jaguar-man or an anime-import? Yeah that's not immersion breaking.  (Note: I'd rather they'd simply have ignored Arena/Daggerfall Khajiit not try to cram them in. People have been ignoring TOS Klingons for decades perfectly well, that silly virus made things worse not better)  Anyways I could probably rant all day, short-ish version I think lots visual diversity is one of those ideas that sounds better on paper then in practical implementation.

Oblivion is set in a world just as deep and rich as Morrowind's. You have to dig a little deeper to see it, but it's there. The different architectural styles of the buildings in the various cities are just one of several ways the setting is more varied than Morrowind's was, IMO. Morrowind gets all the credit for having the most different aesthetic styles in it, and that's true for clothing, armor and weapon styles, but if you observe the building types in both games with an unbiased lense, there's a lot more different stuff in TES IV, and that aesthetic is part of the lore/story in and of itself."

IMO the setting isn't really more diverse - I love Cheydin's Hall, perfect location for me - but in terms of architecture, I felt a greater difference between Telvanni, Hlaalu, Redoran, Velothi, Imperials, Mournhold etc than between Skingrad and Cheydinhal.

For what it's worth, I don't think it was supposed to be subversive in any way. Anyone that thinks it is unusual probably hasnt paid much attention. You already mentioned fantasy, but it's common in literally every form of media. In this case it's just specifically designed and amplified to be this way to draw attention to this weird standard, rather than done just because that's how it's done. As another fwiw, it IS going against the general trend of making elves beautiful and androgenous. Sexual dimorphism of this scale is typically found in fantasy beast races. Other elf designs get to this idea by making everyone uniformly 'weird' looking (spawning hundreds of beauty mods in the process).  If I really wanted to, I could also read it as a reflection of the media's (and society in general's)  treatment of Asians -- women are highly sexualized, men are entirely de-sexualized. I don't think it was written as that, but it could be read as that.  Maybe it's not any kind of glamour or anything, but pure Tamrielic prejudice at play here.

It definitely ties to how the Bosmer, mostly Bosmeri men, have been treated in the past few games - maybe not so much in Skyrim or ESO, but especially in Oblivion, where there's a lot of Bosmeri characters who are supposed to be jokes on their own. I've been actually thinking about this lately, and noticed that a lot of that also had much to do with portraying the characters' mental illness as a joke, sometimes even going as far as to giving them a joke name based on it. I don't know, it always bothered me in Oblivion a lot - everything seemed fine until I noticed there was an entire fictional race most of whom I'm supposed to laugh at, ""because they're short and weird""."
teslore,3bwvmo,ladynerevar,4,Sat Jul 4 04:25:05 2015 UTC,"I think it's a fundamental misunderstanding of the Fargoth meme. He lucked into his status.

If you give it back, the game actually encourages you to steal it back. It's pretty obvious that he would become a Thing. Tribunal lampshades him with Geanor, who you think is a Fargoth-like character but then turns out to just kick your ass (Tribunal also had the naked Nord who just liked to be naked, so it's not just the Bosmer who got this treatment).  Oblivion then just kind of... ran away with it. It's like someone missed every other bit of characterization and decided that Bosmer = Funny Memes. Which led to just overall bad writing in all kinds of ways. Luckily Skyrim seems to have realized the error of their ways - I was very glad to see that the one big Bosmer character was not only not a comic relief figure, but actually a pretty big badass in his own right.  I think having bosmeri men be viewed as comical and annoying in-universe could be a cool thing to play with and against, but having them be treated like that out-of-universe by the devs is not.

There were several ""weird"" characters in Morrowind who happened to be Bosmer, who stood out enough to gain popularity, but the characterization in Oblivion was simply taking it too far without really thinking about it too much. Also, I remember it being established that Bosmer living in big Cyrodiil cities, especially in the Imperial City, were particularly vulnerable to mental health problems, caused by being too far away from the forests and feeling anxious among walls and tall buildings, which is why we encounter so many Bosmer NPCs who suffer from some sort of delusions. I suppose it had a big part in how the Bosmer were characterized in Oblivion, and it's also why it really pains me how negative the portrayal of that is, how much it's played for laughs. I imagine something like that is a very real and serious problem for the Bosmer living in the cities, and I wish the topic had been brought up in different way than ""hey, this is funny, you're supposed to laugh, look at these weirdos"".

teslore,3bzb5x,proweler,1 point,Fri Jul 3 15:57:10 2015 UTC,"Figuring out who the dreamer is would certainly be an important part of how one enters the dream. But the point remains that entering the dream is conceivable, based on the scant evidence available."

Of course we've read about such travels between the worlds before, I always had the impression that this is one of the more, um, how to say, maybe ""fanfiction""-like aspects of the Witcher universe. At least it would feel like this to write Ciri into our ES setting, there are more metaphysical reflections on what the Aurbis is and how other worlds may relate to it (Digitals, some slight breakings of the fourth wall here and there etc)."

The next human now comes with a breathing device. The food doesn't contain nutrients and such, but most likely Magicka. So, you get it, the human dies.  And so on. The inhabitants of Nirn have vastly different bodies, which require Magicka. Unless this alien could transform their own body, or was otherwise immortal, they would be fucked."

teslore,3bxfyb,Watosh66,3,Thu Jul 2 23:40:07 2015 UTC,"There are sort of examples of democracy in Tamriel, but none of them are really full blown democracies. Cyrodiil is partially ruled by the Elder Council, similarly to England before the Crown lost almost all its power. Morrowind has a Grand Council made up of all the Great Houses. Post Tribunal Morrowind, at least as far as I know, has no monarch(s), only the Grand Council. However, the councilors are not elected, they earn the position by being part of a Great House. Skyrim’s Moot could be considered similar to a parliament, but their only job is choosing the next High King. Very rarely is there any difficulty in choosing a new High King as the eldest son or daughter would inherit the throne like any monarchy. They just need the Moot’s nearly guaranteed approval.  Whenever High Rock unites they likely share power between Kings, maybe like a republic or an oligarchy. Besides Emeric in the Daggerfall Covenant I've never heard any mention of a ""King of High Rock"". Correct me if I'm wrong.  The Argonians are a collective. Virtually all Argonians answer to the Hist. Whatever the Hist says to do or to not do the Argonians will obey. So if the Hist said to kill some random Argonian in Helstrom the Argonians would do it. Black Marsh has no real governing body because the Hist is the one governing it. Therefor Argonians are a collective as in they are a group that act the same way in all cases, with very little disagreement in most cases.  High Rock, before joining the Empire, was a collection of many city-states that hardly ever united into a proper High Rock. During the First Empire Colovia was divided into city states as well, separate from the rest of Cyrodiil. Before the creation of the Elswyre Confedeeracy the Khajiit had city states. Rimmen is and still may be a city-state, Khenarthi's Roost was as of the Second Era, and I could be missing some others as well.   You could say that the Ashlanders are an anarchic society, as they are collection of independent tribes. And what I mean by Ashlanders are anarchic is that they don't answer to the government of Morrowind, the province which they inhabit."

They deified the hawk, wolf, snake, moth, owl, whale, bear, fox, and the dragon. Every now and then you can stumble across the broken stone totems in the farther reaches of Skyrim.

They were erected in the ancient past to hold Mundus together. Each of them has a Stone, like a metaphysical battery. The Dragonfires helped hold the barrier between Mundus and Oblivion up. These divine fires were created by White Gold Tower being ""active"". Its stone/battery was the Amulet of Kings, which had to be worn by a Dragonborn to work. It was shattered by Martin, whose blood conjured Akatosh forth, and after that, the new Akatosh statue took the place of the Amulet. So no. Martin is not a god. The Towers and the Divines have things in common, but they're two different things."

teslore,3bxypp,cfmacleod,2,Fri Jul 3 02:34:56 2015 UTC,"Well if the White Gold Tower was the barrier between Oblivion and Mundus, and it was deactivated, how is Oblivion separated from Mundus now? If Martin became its Stone it could still function as intended to keep Daedra out of Mundus (other than by summoning). The Towers hold up the stability of Mundus, so it' s possible the White Gold Tower kept Mundus's stability by creating a barrier between Mundus and Oblivion. Without a Stone that's immpossible, so Martin became the Stone, thus it's possible.  Most of that is simply speculation, but I think it could hold up."

The Dragon Fires are the thing that keeps out Oblivion. White-Gold was built by Daedra worshiping Aleyids, so I doubt they would want to keep out Oblivion, or reinforce reality. In fact, I think somewhere it says White-Gold was the means by which Aleyids transcended mortality.   If anything made Martin into the stone, I would say it was Akatosh. We think he wants to keep the world going, and not let it be destroyed. Maybe it was just the only way to get Mehrune Dagon out and keep the gates shut."
teslore,3bxypp,cfmacleod,2,Fri Jul 3 03:06:53 2015 UTC,"The Towers are what keep Mundus stable, so it's reasonable to think the White Gold Tower achieved this by separating Oblivion from Mundus. Towers can be repurposed, so this is likely what happened when the Imperials took over Cyrodiil. When Akatosh gave Alessia the Amulet of Kings it became White Gold's new stone, and thus the Tower was repurposed. After all, we know that a Tower changes based on whoever controls it."

They ARE part of an older network of dimensional barriers, but theres nothing to indicate that they are intrinsic to the stability of Nirn."
teslore,3bxypp,Lachdonin,1 point,Fri Jul 3 06:57:06 2015 UTC,"No, they are not required for the stability of Nirn, but they are part of keeping it. The Nu-Mantia intercept shows no mention that Post-Convention Towers (as in towers created after Red Tower) do not contribute to the stability of Mundus like Pre-Convention Towers do. Correct me if I'm wrong. If Post-Convention Towers were the only Towers holding up Mundus, then Nirn should have already been dissolved. I say this because Red Tower was created so that the Divines did not need to be on Nirn to keep it from falling apart. Red Tower was deactivated by the Neravarine."
teslore,3bxypp,Watosh66,1 point,Fri Jul 3 09:53:32 2015 UTC,"Talos is the only reason Nirn didn't collapse when the First Stone was removed. He replaced it as the divine presence of the Mundus, rendering the Red Tower largely obsolete.   There is absolutely no evidence that the Meri towers function in the same way. In fact, the Nu-Mantua indicates that they are designed to collect Creatia (generally viewed as synonymous with Magicka) to power alternative methods of 'Escape', as opposed to reinforcing the fabric of reality.  This non-stabilizing characteristic is reinforced in ESO which outright (in one source, anyway) states the Towers shape, because they are unable to create.   Of the Towers we know of, only Sap was not created by a Meri population seeking a way to either escape, or destroy the Mundus. Crystal, White-Gold, Bronze and Snow were all built by cultures who wanted to tear down the prison, not make it stronger, so why would they ever build something to stabilise it?"
teslore,3bxypp,Lachdonin,1 point,Fri Jul 3 10:16:59 2015 UTC,"Ah, I see. I had to go back and read the Nu-Mantia intercept again, its been a while. Thinking on White Gold the Dragonfires is what kept Oblivion from Nirn, not the Tower itself. Martin Septim became the replacement for the Dragonfires when he sacrificed himself, at least that's how I see it."
teslore,3bxypp,Watosh66,1 point,Fri Jul 3 10:44:33 2015 UTC,"I don't know.. The whole thing is very strange, since we were told the Daedra were now locked out, but we can see they aren't in Skyrim, and Umbriel mentions that the Dragonfires are gone completely... But if the fires are gone and the barrier with them, what was the point of all of that anyway?  Then we have MK indicating that Martin mantled Akatosh, others theorizing that he unleashed the Dragonborn souls of the Emperors, others saying he outright turned into a Dragon...  I honestly don't know what to think about the Dragonfires and Martin. I'm more sure I know who Tall Papa is than what happened in that fanned temple."

teslore,3bxypp,merupu8352,4,Fri Jul 3 02:23:32 2015 UTC,"I don't see how you could limit the scrolls being the Divines themselves. The number of scrolls varies as they flit in and out of existence. In addition, the  Cult of the Ancestor Moth seemingly has collected and read hundreds (or whatever) of Elder Scrolls over time. I don't get how you could connect the Divines and the Elder Scrolls, when the latter can't even be committed to one number?"
teslore,3bxypp,RideTheLine,1 point,Fri Jul 3 03:08:20 2015 UTC,If the divines are the scrolls then why would they have to have a set number. Why couldn't they be as many as they wish whenever they wish and exist in as many places in the world or time as they choose.
teslore,3bxypp,HarveyNico456,1 point,Fri Jul 3 12:43:30 2015 UTC,"The Divines, apart from Talos, are a concrete number of Anuic et'Ada that participated in the formation of Mundus as we know it. In fact, they appear to the inhabitants of Nirn as the moons, planets, and stars in the sky. Seeing as how they already have a physical manifestation in the mortal plane, I really don't think that they are also the Elder Scrolls. The Scrolls themselves are some byproduct of creation, to be sure. But to put them as the Divines themselves is a bit of a stretch."

teslore,3bxypp,ryleih,5,Sat Jul 4 11:37:15 2015 UTC,"Nine of the ten divines have plenty of statues erected in their honor. So why don't they communicate in the same manner when they need to.     The act of Creation rendered the Aedra comatose, unable to maintain themselves, and they now float about the heavens in what mortals perceive as other planets. The Aedra are molded into aspects by mortal belief, a phenomenon known as mythopoiea, and are different across each culture (which explains the similarities and differences between Kynareth, Kyne, and Khenarthi, they're all from the same KYNRT oversoul, but are independent beings).    The Daedra do shit because they're not comatose, they did not take part in Creation and are thus unaffected.    Talos is a different story, since he's not an Aedra."
teslore,3bxypp,ryleih,1 point,Fri Jul 3 03:00:23 2015 UTC,"Well in my opinion don't trust the Pantheons of Tamerial, because the mortals will never know the truth.  There are the 8 Aedra and indefinite amount Daedra.  The Princes make themselves known to Nirn, but they are examples of ""Lords of Oblivion"" who don't make themselves known to Nirn. And there are a couple stragglers like Y'ffre and other powerful beings.  One thing you should know about the Relationship between the Aedra and Daedra is the fact that the Aedra are weakened from the creation and the Daedra call them fools for even putting up with Lorkhan's idea, but the Daedra are jealous that the Aedra created something so good.  Talos and Vivec are simply people(s) who achieved CHIM and became very powerful on par with the daedric Princes before creation.  The Elder Scrolls are what they are called, really dam old scrolls from possibly outside of the ""Dream"".  My theory is that the Scrolls are not from creation of the Godhead, but something outside it. They aren't ""Divines"", but they are more or less artifacts that are part of something bigger.  Comparing the Scrolls to Daedric artifacts, they both minds of their own, but they are connected to ones who created them. For the Elder Scrolls, they are connected to something we cannot comprehend, outside of the Dream."
teslore,3bxypp,ryleih,0,Fri Jul 3 03:07:28 2015 UTC,"First about Martin, he is not that powerful. Talos has couple of traits that makes him powerful, Martin doesnt. And i read that scrolls were schematics of the Nirn made by Magnus, Lorkhan and Aka( 3 original one). The scrolls we see are copies of those 3. One broken, one missing, one left(which makes you mad like Akatosh). They have every possible outcome in them because gods designed Nirn and all the actions in it."
teslore,3bxypp,taw,0,Fri Jul 3 11:44:53 2015 UTC,And the only reason Martin wasn't that powerful was that there were no dragons or dragon speak. Teachers (besides the reclusive Greybeards) to teach him. He was dragonborn.
teslore,3bxypp,taw,2,Fri Jul 3 13:27:14 2015 UTC,There is no evidence that he was dragonborn. Reason Talos is powerful is not only being dragonborn. Enantimorph and CHIM made him powerful.

teslore,3bxypp,twilot_spankle,0,Sat Jul 4 12:51:37 2015 UTC,There is no prove for that. As far as we know being a dragonborn is a soul thing not blood and Martin comes from Tibers brothers line.
teslore,3bxypp,KalTorack,2,Sat Jul 4 13:55:48 2015 UTC,Being dragonborn has to be a genetic thing. We are told that they are dragonborn because they have dragon bllod running through their veins.

The conflict is between the King and the Rebel, with the Observer being wounded as a side effect.  Read the character creation questions from Arena, on the UESP, and see which answers go with the Warrior, Mage, or Thief. Notably, the Mage is neutral, preferring to observe the world rather than take decision, which the Warrior and Thief do. The enantiomorph roles aren't bound to the W/M/T, but the roles warriors, mages, and thieves tend to correlate with the roles, as I said with the Mage being scholarly and observing, ever notice most mages organizations(Psijic, Telvanni, College of Winterhold), tend to remain OUT of the political spectrum? Granted, some mages don't, but the archetype, The Mage, does. The Warrior is a face, is honest, and leads, like an archetypical king. The Thief is sneaky, deceives, isn't out for his people, but himself, with some correlations to the archetypical rebel. Can magic-users fit the role of the Thief more than the Mage? In personality and actions, yes.  Its their roles within the specific enantiomorph. Vivec was the Rebel in one but the Observer in another. Basically the enatiomorph is the action of the Rebel usurping(or betraying) the King, with the Observer being maimed. Sometimes one cant tell the difference between the Rebel and the King, but the King usually holds the power and the Rebel betrays. Hjait wanted Wulfharth' soul and betrayed him thus. Hjati is the Rebel. Wulfharth is the King. Arctus is the Observer because he watched them and was maimed as a result.  If you think about the archetypes of kings, rebels, observers, warriors, mages, and thieves it will begin to make a bit more sense why these trinities are often connected."

As soon as ecclesiastic music became canonical and professional musicians started appearing, folk melodies stopped being used and reused for formal usage in the west. We know that professional music exists on Tamriel (from the Bards' college and from the books dedicated to music), so in terms of real-life musicology it seems very unlikely that a folk tune of the Dunmer would be reused as a piece for the legacy of the Septims, or vice versa.  And honestly, those pieces sound way too cinematic to have been composed from outside of the Hollywood influences. They're not very believable as in-universe music, unlike pieces like Sovngarde."

As an example, Georgian anthem is a picked melody from a famous Georgian opera ""Daisi"", but with new, anthem-appropriate lyrics. Taking a melody and changing the lyrics is a standard procedure for anthems.  The idea of anthems is modern, established in sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. A continent with a single, generally undivided empire would not realistically have anthem traditions, due to the lack of need for distinction.   It could be possible that the Dunmer did accidentally end up adopting a fanfare from the empire, but at that point we are talking about the imaginary folk and fanfare arrangements of the tune, not what we've heard on the soundtracks. Nerevar Rising, as on the soundtrack, is definitely not a creation of folk process, at least by the real-life musical standards."

Ecclesiastic music is no exception - on the contrary, many hymns began life as popular chants, and Masses - with their inherent re-use of lyrics and fairly rigid structure - are as much folk arrangements as they are original compositions.  I'm not trying to start an argument, so please don't take this as a provocation. You've clearly studied music history - but the claim that re-use of folk melodies disappeared with the rise of religious music is one of those music school falsehoods that simply has to go."

Especially considering the way that the Bushido system functioned compared to the Orcish system we see in the Skyrim strongholds (We know very little of Orsinium's customs, as they are noted to be slightly different in some aspects). For example: In the bushido system, Samurai were very strong warriors who served the Shogun as defenders, and the Shogun had political power over the entire kingdom. In Orcish culture, you fight if you can swing a blade, and if you cant, you damn well better hope you can do something else useful. There also is no Shogun. The chief system in the strongholds is very different from that (and in my opinion not an accurate representation of how the strongholds would function in reality). I doubt the customs of Orsinium would be much different than the strongholds, perhaps some sort of ""Grand Chieftain"" of Orsinium, who is essentially the most politically and militarily intelligent of the populace.  It's also worth pointing out that Malacath probably wouldn't line up very close to Bushido ideals. I don't know enough about them, but Malacath is not as focused on honor as you might think. He's much much more concerned with strength, both individual and group, and both physical and mental (see: The Cursed Tribe quest in Skyrim). Also, the Old Orcs are probably unique to Skyrim. The sheer numbers of them that would be present in Orsinium would make ""honorable deaths"" like those very messy and very public, which is not really a system you can have in such a society. Feel free to ask any questions!"
teslore,3bvcs5,elderscroll_dot_pdf,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:25:57 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the clear and complete answer.  By the way, what do you think would an orc do if his opponent defeated him (not permanently maimed nor crippled), but then refused to kill him and just left? And if he was instead rendered unable for ever to fight?  Would he in any case commit (ritual) suicide, in your opinion?  Oh, and in my headcanon the strongholds system portrayed in Skyrim and Orsinium's social structure are very very different."
teslore,3bvcs5,elderscroll_dot_pdf,2,Thu Jul 2 17:28:57 2015 UTC,"Hmm... it depends. Can the Orc get help? They won't immediately resort to death if unable to fight, especially if they are still relatively young. They would likely be able to return to the stronghold and begin learning a new skill like working the forge or similar."

teslore,3bvcs5,Aerathnor,2,Thu Jul 2 15:53:00 2015 UTC,"The in-universe explanation for the Samurai weapons in Morrowind, stated by NPCs and books in the game, is that they're leftovers from the Akaviri wars. They're not native Dunmer weapons, but adopted from foreigners."

(see the books)  What I don't get is why they didn't mine it, they already mined a whole complex in it so why not just mine the entire rock and spread out the material so the impact is spread out  nooooo instead they build a giant jet engine powered by human and mer souls."
teslore,3bs2hs,banana_pirate,17,Wed Jul 1 18:36:39 2015 UTC,"I'd imagine they would sell off the pieces as holy relics.  If each piece regained it's velocity when the engine failed it would have caused some interesting results, especially if they had been placed in amulets/earings/rings."
teslore,3bs2hs,Aerathnor,11,Wed Jul 1 18:51:03 2015 UTC,"Would suck if some of the bricks in your house were made of stones from it.  could be worse though, there are worse places to have a suddenly accelerating ring for instance.  Question is though, do those parts gain their velocity back when removed from the whole? or do they wait until every bit does at once?"
teslore,3bs2hs,banana_pirate,6,Wed Jul 1 18:53:56 2015 UTC,"Was wondering that myself. I'd imagine it would be whenever the whole regained it, otherwise removing the rocks from carving out the ministry in the first places would have been deadly."
teslore,3bs2hs,Aerathnor,8,Wed Jul 1 20:07:39 2015 UTC,"Continuing to mine it would probably have worked.  Clearly, pieces can be taken off or out, so just slowly chip away at it and hollow it out over time."
teslore,3bs2hs,MR1120,14,Wed Jul 1 18:45:26 2015 UTC,IIRC it impacted with the full velocity it had before it was captured.  Even moving it a tiny bit would not have stopped the destruction of the city and likely would have caused Red Mountain to go crazy anyway.
teslore,3bs2hs,Aerathnor,8,Wed Jul 1 18:26:50 2015 UTC,"Yep. They had no way of knowing whether attempting to move it would be successful, or would just cause it to plummet into the city. The safest route was to keep it afloat."
teslore,3bs2hs,LeeJP,6,Wed Jul 1 18:39:05 2015 UTC,Did anyone else think this was going to be a Spongebob joke? And yes the only way to really stop it would be to completely mine it instead of keeping it as the Ministry. Vivec and the Temple would probably have objected though

As for mining it, I'm not sure if this was a real option - Certainly not as long as Vivec was there to object and I doubt that you could mine the whole thing in any less time than a hundred years or so (Depending on its actual size of course)"
teslore,3btm00,Watosh66,8,Thu Jul 2 01:19:27 2015 UTC,"As they were the most powerful of lesser spirits in the ages after the Convention and eager to emulate what they saw, the Aldmer began construction of their own towers. That they built more than one shows you that they were not of one mind."
teslore,3btm00,MareloRyan,1 point,Thu Jul 2 01:33:01 2015 UTC,"The Adamantine Tower was also in Daggerfall, and it looks very different. I think we should go with Daggerfall's for now, simply because Zenimax most likely copy/pasted the White Gold tower there until they would expand upon it in the game. Obviously Daggerfall is more recent that ESO, and I doubt their different looks in game are due to ""changing through time"" as much as simply being redesigned for the game; or in Zenimax's case, just putting the WG tower there."
teslore,3btm00,MightyDebo,3,Thu Jul 2 03:51:37 2015 UTC,"BOTH are likely correct. The Adamantine Tower has a facade built around it that has changed over time. The Direnni controlled it around the time of ESO, thus it is an elvish-looking tower. At the time of Daggerfall, likely it has a different facade. And a bunch of mutilated corpses and vampires inside for some reason."

teslore,3btm00,jogarz,-1,Sat Jul 4 02:47:43 2015 UTC,"Quite true, Zenimax has managed to completely disregard the lore of the TES universe in many aspects. Examples being ""Dwemer Ore"", the placement of cities in zones, and just outright making up things for the sake of a quest. I wouldn't be surprised if the the Adamantine Tower was in a similar case in ESO."
teslore,3btm00,mojonation1487,7,Thu Jul 2 04:34:03 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't go so far as saying they're disregarding lore so much as they just used WGT as a placeholder.   Btw I accidentally reported your post. Mods, if you see this, obviously ignore it."
teslore,3btm00,MareloRyan,5,Thu Jul 2 05:40:45 2015 UTC,"making up things for the sake of a quest.   As opposed to, what, consulting reality?  All of the games are made up for the sake of a quest.  That's kind of the point.  If you mean that Zenimax should be shackled to only use pre-existing lore in the creation of their game, that would make for an extremely boring game, in terms of lore...  And that's not what ESO is, thankfully."
teslore,3btm00,MareloRyan,2,Thu Jul 2 13:17:57 2015 UTC,"That is a fair point, and I should be more clear on what I meant. As in they are overwriting pre-existing lore with their own in some cases. This isn't a regular recurrence throughout ESO, but it does happen. Examples being Dwemer Ore, the design of Cyrodiil (which is understandable, but still lore breaking), the Elder Scrolls being kept in Keeps, Orsinium is still around for some reason, the Argonians and the Hist actually caring about the rest of Tamriel, etc.  There are examples of these things in some quests as well. Don'y get me wrong, I love the game, I just find it to have broken the lore in many regards.  Edit: Coincidentally enough while playing ESO I came across a lore book called Subtropical Cyrodiil: A Speculation. This book gives a reasonable explanation as to why Cyrodiil is designed as it is in ESO, and quite a good one at that. It also brings in some new information about how Towers work which is very interesting."
teslore,3btm00,alanwpeterson,6,Thu Jul 2 21:36:35 2015 UTC,"I think if you dug into the rest of those examples, you'd find that they are also either reasonable on the face of it or have pretty interesting and/or thorough explanations given.  Just off the top of my head, the Dwemer ore thing has already been explained (it's just a name based on  similar qualities; they aren't the same metal) and Orsinium has been razed and rebuilt multiple times in the course of Tamrielic history anyway.  It's certainly not a common perspective among the people who make a hobby of lore analysis around here that ESO has actually ""broken"" anything in terms of lore; given what a contentious lot we are, I think it says something that we mostly agree that it's fantastic.  It certainly helps that we are allowed to ask questions and often get very interesting and satisfying answers.  Beyond that, though, it's really nothing new to ESO for the games to overwrite previous lore with new ideas and accounts.  That has happened in literally every single one of them to date, save Arena, which got the ball rolling.  And I'm glad this is the case, because if it stagnated and had no weird wrinkles or new perspectives, it'd be really, really boring."
teslore,3btm00,tombobbishop,2,Fri Jul 3 01:42:51 2015 UTC,"You make good points here. I do agree that the majority of the game is lore friendly, I just have those complaints about it here and there, mostly with plot points in quests. I'm sure for many of those there are reasonable answers, but I have yet to find them. Like with Cyrodiil, Zenimax does often offer very good reasoning for these types of things. I personally think that ESO has overwritten lore more than any other TES game to date, but that isn't always bad thing. Like I said, my complaints are usually with the story of in-game quests. The majority of quests in ESO are not lore breaking though.  Sorry if I was too vague with my original comment on ESO, I should have clarified more on what I meant.  And I do stand corrected on many of the points I made, so I thank you for that."
teslore,3btm00,CHIM_ERA,5,Fri Jul 3 02:04:58 2015 UTC,I think they just put a copy of white gold there for now to take the space and will change it when they add it into the game
teslore,3brdw4,Guerinus,19,Wed Jul 1 15:15:58 2015 UTC,One more awesome thing drowned out by the games not showing the true divide between Colovians and Nibenese.
teslore,3brdw4,Vermax,10,Wed Jul 1 15:30:51 2015 UTC,"I wish TES4 portrayed more of this division. It would make Cyrodiliic lore more complex and Empire more diverse, moving from typical Roman legion style to a mixture of late Eastern and Western Empire."
teslore,3brdw4,Samphire,18,Wed Jul 1 15:44:33 2015 UTC,"Yup, pretty much.  For further context; Here you can see a ""Colovian Arrow-catcher"" helmet  and Here you can see the Oloman style from Anvil, as well as the Kvatch style"
teslore,3brdw4,Iceflame542,8,Wed Jul 1 15:47:26 2015 UTC,"Oloman is interesting, it seems to denote the style of Bendu Olo's lineage of kings of the Anvil colovian estate; the Oloman dynasty. Under Bendu Olo and his heirs, Anvil county would be considered the Oloman kingdom/Colovian estate. It would have been nice to see more of that style in Oblivion's Anvil. Another aspect of influence in Anvil (other than the seafaring culture and Hammerfell influence) would be the Colovian hunting culture, as evidenced by the ermine pattern on Anvil's flag."

teslore,3brdw4,pieguy221,4,Thu Jul 2 09:15:47 2015 UTC,"Upvoted, and here's a bump. Interesting topic that this newcomer knows little about. Fascinating that a culture with a name so fluid and warm has Slavic influences. ""Colovian"" is just a pretty word."
teslore,3brdw4,into_darkness,5,Wed Jul 1 15:24:15 2015 UTC,"Moravia comes to my mind. It's in Czech republic, so it's western Slavic and also if you compare architecture of the Colovian cities there are some similarities. This could be one of the possible influences."
teslore,3brdw4,Vermax,2,Wed Jul 1 15:39:52 2015 UTC,"In my vision Colovia has influences from a lot of real world cultures; Tuscan countryside and cuisine, Basque or Scottish mountainous and independent highlanders, Tuscan clifftop fortress should dot the land, the obvious pseudo-Nordic nobility, the Scottish-inspired accent, the sort-of-Slavic names and architecture in a few places, the Roman/Spartan martial focus, the warlords etc. etc.   The Morrowind mod Province: Cyrodiil is attempting to flesh out Colovian culture in a much more ambitious way than What Oblivion did. For a time we even had separate Colovian and Nibenese races, but I think we're sticking with just different faces and hairstyle (as well as dialogue and names of course)."
teslore,3brdw4,into_darkness,3,Wed Jul 1 21:40:54 2015 UTC,"Ive been following this Morrowind mod for a while now, and safe to see what is good. Please continue with the good work you've put in to bring Junglediil back to this glorious game."

teslore,3brdw4,Maven_of_Minecraft,3,Thu Jul 2 14:29:54 2015 UTC,"Don't worry, the Nordic pantheon will be featured. Most heavily in the eastern old holds, and the more rural communities, but also in the daily life of the average Nord. The western holds are more inspired by southern religion, especially because of a larger Imperial population as well as travellers and merchants. The Imperial Cult has prominent shrines in Markarth, Karthwasten, Haafingar, Falkreath and Whiterun, as well as in various Imperial fiefs and Legion forts.  We'll also include other religions; the Yoku pantheon will be showcased in the Crown half of Dragonstar, as well as in the general Redguard population and insurgency. The Orsimer mountain tribes have some bloody conflicts as a result of the Malacath/Trinimac schism. The Reachmen tribes are practising a myriad of different more or less primitive belief systems, and their witch cults means potential danger for any traveller straying from the relative safety of the Reach's cities and roads. The Direnni ruins found in the Reach will probaly show some evidence of their religion as well. Add to that the various travelling preachers, Daedra cultists and so on."
teslore,3brdw4,into_darkness,3,Thu Jul 2 15:31:29 2015 UTC,"I can agree on which inspirations you see for Colovia. They definately have Western Slavic traits, likely from Nords also appearing Slavic-like (Atmorans probably more Viking & Slav inspired {Russian-esque} ). These Nords were mostly from the Reach, but there may have been some from other parts of Skyrim as well.  Aside from Nords, Colovia also shares a border with Hammerfell, which also likely had some influence on their culture. Most influences Hammerfell may have may be in seafaring, armor/weapons, food, & perhaps a few other things like a few naming conventions. Anvil is probably the place to see more of this culture.  Southern Colovia should retain some of those cultures, but with a little more Elven influence (Bosmeri). This may somewhat explain the [architectural] styles of Kvatch & Skingrad, which also seems similar to the Cheydinhall style.  Finally, Colovia is part of overarching Cyrodiil & has it's own take on Imperial Culture, which sometimes involves crossovers with Nibenay. Cities like Chorrol, Skingrad, & even the Imperial City could show this."
teslore,3bqsy0,docclox,39,Wed Jul 1 12:04:22 2015 UTC,"they can't be the ghosts of the Dwarves. For one thing, if they were, any halfway decent necromancer could command one and ask it what happened to the Dwemer.   They totally are the ghosts of Dwarves. But they probably wouldn't be much help -- Yagrum has (ostensibly) no idea where the others went, and it's likely that any specters are just as clueless. Especially considering that really old ghosts tend to have serious brain-farts.   Also, for just about all the theories about the Disappearance, I don't think there's any of them that would allow anything resembling a spirit or soul or really any trace of identity to remain.   The usual answer is that they died pre-Disappearance so their souls didn't go with the rest, perhaps because their souls degraded to white.   And as a related matter, how does Arniel Gane fit into it all? Is his fate a reflection of some flaw in his experiments? Or does it suggest that the Dwemer are not as gone as some might suppose?   It should be pretty clear that Arniel's Endeavor was way different than Kagrenac's. All he did was smack a soul gem with just one of the Tools (and its enchantments weren't even working right). If there is anything that can be taken from it, it's that the Dwemer are just as gone as we think they are. Their collective soul bound itself to the nearest soul gem that could hold it, the Numidium, and Arniel's soul did the same. In his case, the soul gem was the LDB."
teslore,3bqsy0,Prince-of-Plots,7,Wed Jul 1 12:39:52 2015 UTC,"This is  a very good answer in my opinion, the only answer needed really is: the specters are Dwemmer who died pre-disappearance, and the disappeared ones didn't die, at least not to leave specters behind."
teslore,3bqsy0,Fanscope,12,Wed Jul 1 15:46:11 2015 UTC,"Also it's very likely a ton of Dwemmer died right before the disappearance, considering they were in the midst of a war.  That explains why there are specters around that no one bothered clearing out."
teslore,3bqsy0,docmedic,2,Wed Jul 1 20:29:22 2015 UTC,"[I had a reply for this yesterday and was about to post when we had a power cut.

But they probably wouldn't be much help -- Yagrum has (ostensibly) no idea where the others went, and it's likely that any specters are just as clueless. Especially considering that really old ghosts tend to have serious brain-farts.   OK, the links are compelling. (I never did get that far with Tribunal for some reason...)  Still, it's not really very satisfying, though. Not to knock your argument which seems pretty unassailable, but it feels like there's something missing from the lore. I mean they can't all be either brain dead or ""I-just-work-here-guv"" jobsworths. You'd think that, with all these mighty wizardly brains obsessing over all things Dwemer, that someone would have attempted some sort of systematic series of interviews. And probably published the results, with a list of transcripts with everything from the incoherent to the banal to those that offered some rare glimpse of insight.   The usual answer is that they died pre-Disappearance so their souls didn't go with the rest, perhaps because their souls degraded to white.   Possibly even better as an explanation: maybe the Disappearance only took those with the Dwemmer view of the universe. That would mean that any specters remaining would, by definition, not be able to explain what happened. It would also require that the Dwemer started exterminating members of the race who refused to embrace Orthodox Dwemer Epistemology, but that doesn't sound entirely out of character for them.  Even then though, I'd expect there to be things we could learn from the specters. Language; culture; how the automata were made (I'm assuming that the non-dwemer ones in Morrowind were refurbished rather than created from scratch); what those giant machines are actually doing and why they need so much steam power to do it; even setting the Disappearance aside there are many mysteries on which the ghosts could shed some light.   It should be pretty clear that Arniel's Endeavor was way different than Kagrenac's. All he did was smack a soul gem with just one of the Tools (and its enchantments weren't even working right).    I'd have said it was pretty damn close, myself.  He set out to try and recreate Kagrenac's experiments on a small scale and where Kagrenac disappeared his entire race, Arniel just disappeared himself. If anything, I suspect it worked way better than he was expecting.   If there is anything that can be taken from it, it's that the Dwemer are just as gone as we think they are.    Oh, I'm not arguing otherwise. I mean the value of the Dwemer lies in them being an unsolvable mystery. They'd be far less interesting if someone brought them back and there were suddenly dwarves on every street corner.  Still, were I able, I would very much like to be able to summon Arniel's shade and ask it where it went."
teslore,3bqsy0,MareloRyan,12,Thu Jul 2 11:09:20 2015 UTC,"Basically, Dwemer died and left ghosts behind for hundreds of years before the Disappearance.  That easily explains the presence of Dwemeri ghosts, and the lack of knowledge to be gained from said ghosts; they weren't part of the Disappearance, and thus have no knowledge of it.  Can't get blood from a stone."
teslore,3bqsy0,MareloRyan,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:22:11 2015 UTC,"There's still a lot they could tell us about things unrelated to the disappearance. Their culture, their songs, that sort of thing.

Any specter with half its faculties ought to be able to tell us that."

Not a lot of people know Dwemeris, and there's no reason to think the Dwemeri ghosts would be up-to-date on common languages hundreds of years after their deaths, especially considering how isolationist Dwemeri culture was in the first place.  That said, the games and various apocrypha actually have provided quite a lot of insight into Dwemeri culture.  But, again, this is a rough sketch designed to leave an impression.  Maybe in a future game we will see even more about Dwemeri culture.  (ESO has already expanded on them, and probably will continue to do so, just for example.)

We don't get a Speak With Dead spell in game (no point since most of the dead wouldn't have anything interesting to say, and the ones that do can be handled by plot devices) but it seems reasonable to assume some sort of translation mechanism.  Or, worst case, someone like Beladas Devnameni soul traps a specter into a soul gem, releases it into a binding circle when he gets home, and then spends the next five years holding up items and saying ""what is your word for this?""    That said, the games and various apocrypha actually have provided quite a lot of insight into Dwemeri culture. But, again, this is a rough sketch designed to leave an impression.

The AE is one's personality, one's identity, something that makes you you, the spark is the vessel of the soul itself, a power source so to speak. What if, upon the event that lead to the the dwemer's disappearance, all of their soul's AE went to form the godskin, but their sparks remain and became the specter?

I can't believe no one has thought to try that, so I'm guessing that it doesn't work.   Who says they would know?  Not every member of a race is aware of everything going on with every other one at any one time."
teslore,3bqsy0,Fluffguck,1 point,Thu Jul 2 01:54:27 2015 UTC,"Well: if they were ghosts of the disappeared, they could at least tell us their perception of where they went; their memories of Disappearance Day;  if they were really aware of any of it at all for that matter.  If they aren't ghosts of the disappeared, there's still a ton of questions  they could answer. I mean Arniel learned much of his process by studying gears, Edwina obsessed over Dwemer tubes, Dyvath Fyr was interested in any Dwemer artifact. If such mundane items carry so much arcane information - there must surely be someone haunting one of those ruins who can explain the basics in terms an outlander can understand."
teslore,3bqsy0,Tx12001,1 point,Thu Jul 2 11:54:24 2015 UTC,I think those Dwemer ghosts are bound to the Numidium and return to his Skin once banished. Arniel must be bound to the Dragonborn in the same way.

Or at least their perception of where/what they are when they're not haunting old ruins.  I think we probably have to accept that the specters are the ones that didn't disappear. Otherwise some enterprising necromancer would have solved the whole thing and published the results. Pseudononymously if he had any sense.  I wonder if there's something about the Dwemer that makes them particularly specter prone? I mean the ghosts in Dunmer tombs are there because the Dunmer so bind them, but the we don't see Aleyid specters in Morrowind, for example. At least not with the frequency that we do in Dwemer ones in Morrowind anyway. Maybe it's something about Vvardenfell?"

There are a lot of healers on the front lines (gameplay=/=lore).

Restoration magic can in theory heal pretty much anything, but powerful wizards are quite rare."

It's not a religious thing like in DnD or other fiction where there's a distinction between Arcane magic and Divine magic. All magic in TES is the same.   2nd question - There are plenty of healers on the frontlines in lore. Don't confuse gameplay with lore. If there's one thing people who make topics like this really need to wrap their heads around, it's this. Take the time to read the books and talk to people. There are three or four people in Skyrim who specifically mention having been healers during wars."
teslore,3bq1r5,redditrules54,45,Wed Jul 1 05:53:29 2015 UTC,"Probably. The disappearance of the dwemer isn't really a mystery, just extremely esoteric, and Herma Mora LOVES his esoteric knowledge. The dwemer got all tangled up in the Numidium. What exactly that means is difficult to define, but there are a handful of people in-universe who have a rough idea of what happened to the dwarves, if not exactly. Kind of like how Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle states that you can know an object's exact position or its exact momentum, but never both at the same time, you can either know exactly what the dwemer have become, or keep all of your brain from liquefying and dripping out your ears, but not both at the same time."

His realm isn't called Apocrypha just for fun - every theory, even those dreamed up by madmen and skooma addicts, is just as valid to him. The ""true"" story may be in there somewhere, but Mora doesn't discriminate - real and fake are subjective to him, he cares only for information.  Mora's entire approach to data analysis is quite alien, and impossible for mortals to comprehend - because he is not an archivist of fact, merely a collector of mortal theories. This is why he keeps hopelessly insane Septimus Signus around for so long, and why he pursues the ""secrets"" of the Skaal - a tribe with no significant lost knowledge. Stories are more flavorful to him than solutions."
teslore,3bqt1d,Rein20,12,Wed Jul 1 12:05:32 2015 UTC,"Okay, let me answer as best as I possibly could.  Dreamsleeve is really such an abstract concept that we have no idea what it looks like, and to be honest, we aren't even exactly sure if it exist physically at all. Unclaimed soul go to dreamsleeve where they are essentially stripped of all personalities and recycled into a new body, this is more like energy (or soul) conservation rather than an afterlife, so I would steer clear of any dreamsleeve. To be short, going to dreamsleeve basically mean you are dead, end of the road. So I would not recommend having dreamsleeve in your mod as it is kind of pointless from what we know of it  Vampires usually go to the realm of Molag Bal, the coldharbour, because it is their patron god.  Dunmer should go to dreamsleeve (as I said previously, you are essentially dead at his point) if they have no allegiance to any patron gods.  This is Tu' whacca  and this is what Far Shores look like as represented in ESO.  Hircines' hunting ground is where worshippers of Hircine go to after death where they are subjected to an eternity of being a hunter. It looks kind of like a forest, nothing too foreign, here is a shot in ESO  Malacath's realm is described as consisting only of dust, palaces of smoke, and vaporous creatures: ""anguish, betrayal, and broken promises like ash filled the bitter air"".Levitation and magical breathing are necessary to survive there.  The Hist are basically really advanced and psychic trees linked to the Argonians, here is where you can read more"

But I wonder, some of the races go to special places and have a chance of life again. Like the nords. You go to Sovngarde and you can get out of there (as you are a Dragonborn). Is there any way the other races can escape death? Like the Altmers, Bretons , Dunmer ?"
teslore,3bqt1d,zbzszzzt123,3,Wed Jul 1 13:26:15 2015 UTC,"Well, since you are dragonborn, even as Altmers, Bretons and Dunmers, it would not be very hard I suppose, the dragonborn is perhaps one of the most powerful individual ever existed really  Unless if you are asking about non-dragonborns, which is unlikely seeing we are talking about a skyrim mod here."
teslore,3bqt1d,zbzszzzt123,2,Wed Jul 1 13:35:21 2015 UTC,"Yes I mean that, when you play as one of the other races, you must have some chance to escape death and that probably means not going to the Dreemsleeve. But then where do you go as Altmer, Breton , Dunmer and so on?"
teslore,3bqt1d,alanwpeterson,3,Wed Jul 1 13:43:43 2015 UTC,"Ah, I see.  Okay, let me see if I can answer this  If one worship a daedric prince, you are most likely bound to their realm after death, and you might want to escape from there, so yes, I would say that's one way to do it regardless of race. (But note this, due to the power of LDB - the last dragonborn, it is generally agreed that the princes would not have access to his soul after death, so that might not work, although LDB should be able to decide where his soul can go after death)  Now for race specific options:  Dunmer, a culture where daedric worship is widespread, so that's a way as mentioned above, beside that, I think you might find this thread very helpful  Here is a brief excerpt   When Dunmer die, their bodies are given to the fire, so they may return to the ash from whence they came. Then their ashes and bones are deposited in a family ash tomb, unless certain pieces of bone are required for the ghostfence. In Morrowind, it is sacrilege to bury the honored dead or leave them to rot inside a sarcophagus. Offerings of ash yams are given as a way to symbolize life emerging from death. According to Dunmeri religion, death is not the end, it is only the beginning. I believe most souls, when they are released from ancestral service, probably end up in Azura's plane of Moonshadow.   Khajiit afterlife can be seen here:   When true cats die, their souls are lifted by Khenarthi and flown to the Sands Behind the Stars, to play and prey until the Next Pounce. When bent cats die, their souls are dragged down by Namiira into the Dark Behind the World, to serve the Heart of Lorkhaj until their tails are straight.   Source  Altmer, Breton? I would say Aetherius is a good bet if they are not thrown into dreamsleeve, it is the realm of magic and a good fallback option for any race really.

Is true that each PC has a different race, but what they all have in common is their dov soul, so when they die, they are leaving behind all physical properties. I know every race and culture in TES lore has different perceptions of the universe, but since you are practically taking about a dragon soul you could do an afterlife related to akatosh.  Hey! what about letting the players become dragons in this mod?

Does a nord that has become a nightingale and promised to defend the twilight sepulchre in death do so or do they party in sovngarde?

We normally wouldn't know their last name either but say I have a quest to gather 30 big gulp cups across the magical land of Toledo and then return them to Bob. Well now we've run into a problem because we've got more than one guy named Bob in Toledo so if we simply make the Bobs have different last names the PC can easily think, ""Oh Bob Smith!

They are physically a small piece of the Prince they represent; Mephala mentions that the Ebony Blade is a small portion of her power. However, their presence in Nirn is quite real, and with proper interference, people on Nirn can either destroy them (which causes them to take years before they reform in Oblivion), or break them, trapping them in Nirn, as was done to Mehrunes Razor."

For example, Lorkhan's body appears as two moons, oblivion is the night sky, etc.    Perhaps the daedric artifacts appear as those weapons, partially due to the Princes' magic, partly because of the same ""mental stress""-the dissonance of the mortal mind confronted by the divine."

Volendrung, for example, Malacath's artifact, was originally forged by the Dwemer, so it is definitely a real hammer (that's even where Hammerfell gets its name from)."
teslore,3box6x,elderscroll_dot_pdf,3,Fri Jul 3 00:02:59 2015 UTC,"They are essentially pieces of the Daedra themselves. They manifest their influence into an object, and that usually has something to do with their preferred method of expressing their sphere. Sheogorath's Wabbajack is a good example. The Mace of Molag Bal is another. It doesn't always work perfectly like those, but it all really depends on the Daedra."
teslore,3box6x,cfmacleod,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:35:02 2015 UTC,This brings up an interesting question. I heard somewhere that how Oblivion looks is more related to how you perceive the sphere. Is it similar with the Artifacts? This might explain how it appears different to a bunch of different characters.
teslore,3box6x,elderscroll_dot_pdf,2,Wed Jul 1 04:49:50 2015 UTC,"Hmm... I doubt it. The spheres is more along the lines of how a mortal can conceptualize infinity. The Daedric artifacts are known to simply be very powerful, normal items, even if unique."
teslore,3box6x,cfmacleod,2,Wed Jul 1 04:55:14 2015 UTC,"There also implied to be sentient to some degree. Also, if the story is to be believed, then the Cowl of Nocturnal was literally a part of her(her cloak technically, but I doubt that's an actual cloak). But still, your probably right. They are in Mundus, and so must be mostly physical."
teslore,3box6x,elderscroll_dot_pdf,4,Wed Jul 1 04:59:57 2015 UTC,"Depends mostly on the artifact, I think. At least, that's the first thing that comes to my mind. Mace of Molag Bal sending people into a blood rage. The Ebony Blade whispering lies to its wielder until they kill a loved one for uncommitted crimes. The Oghma Infinium leading readers to an early grave in the form of Apocrypha. But then you have Spellbreaker being just a really really cool shield. The Saviour's Hide just being really sick armor. It's variable, really."
teslore,3bq3i9,Watosh66,5,Wed Jul 1 06:14:16 2015 UTC,"Probably not. The Hist are, it seems, physically connected by the roots. That means that both the one in Oblivion, and the one in Cold Harbour, are separated from the collective.  We also know that the Hist in Lilmoth seperated it's self just before the Umbriel Incedent. It's outright stated that this is exceedingly rare, and implied that it's only ever happened once before. I personally think that one time is the Hist we see in ESO, but there's not anything concrete to support that.   ESO also seems to indicate that young Hist are seperated from the collective, until their roots are fully established. It leaves them unable to properly communicate with their Argonians, as well as leaving them unable to tap into the Hist.Net."

If the blood of the Missing God is ebony, how very likely it could prove that his own newly-formed cavity (Sheogorath) lines itself with ebony as well.

But for this particular instance i'd say a connection probably would be present.. But Surely Ysgramor(or Yngol depending on who spoke to Sheo, if that is the case) did not want to turn the Falmer into rabbits, sweetrolls, dremora or even heal them.   Assuming Sheo was summoned, the summoner must've asked for something specific. Something that would truly give them the bloody vengance he/they craved."

Very little is ever explicitly stated in the games or something like that. Wuuthrad is likely not connected to Sheogorath or the Wabbajack, purely because it doesn't make much sense for them to be related. Sheogorath has very little to do with the Nords in general, so for the greatest weapon of the Nords' greatest champion to be a gift of Sheogorath makes very little sense."

Besides, Sheo doesn't bother much with people who don't bother with him. And Ysgramor probably wouldn't be too fond of the Mad One.

I don't claim to be know even half of the ES lore, but c'mon.. As I replied to /u/davidtheginger there's no way Ysgramor even if he'd agree to use a staff, would want to use wabbajack's powers on the falmer. That'd just not make any sense.   Ysgramor is the model Nord, and that means he probably wouldn't take help from anyone short of their gods   He's in great grief at this point, and perhaps Ysgramor would not even be aware of a daedric presence, seeing as Yngol is the one to forge the weapon. But all of Saarthal had just been raided and slain and as such one can only assume desperate measures was considered."
teslore,3boklm,Scarab-Phoenix,3,Tue Jun 30 23:38:31 2015 UTC,"I really don't think that they would have turned to Sheo for help with the Falmer. They rarely associate with Daedra at all, really only Herma-Mora, and they HATE him. Especially considering the Nordic Old Gods are possibly living manifestations entirely and known to very frequently aid the ancient Nords in battle. Shor, Kyne, Tsun/Stuhn, Ysmir...

I can see that being ""the joke"" but I expect the plane was named without that much thought put into into it.

teslore,3bop1q,SolomonBlack,2,Wed Jul 1 01:53:18 2015 UTC,"Well, the Greek ἀπόκρυφος, apókruphos, means hidden, which would support the forbidden knowledge aspect. Furthermore, an apocrypha is of unknown authorship or doubtful authenticity. In the case of Apocrypha the realm, the books contained are stacks of unmarked black books, that do not display a title or author on the cover.  This obscurity would contribute to the aforementioned doubtful authenticity. The other aspect of the definition, that the information is not to be considered canon, is certainly interesting, but I believe the former is what supports the name and the realm."

When one enters, ìt is like going down the rabbit hole. While some information could be unreliable, is ìt really? This is a place where things & fate have just been, since any idea of a begining could exist or even before. All starts, realties, & ends are essentially equal/undefined truth & farse, no matter what pattern ìt follows & of its objectivity.  -On a side note, there are several meanings for Apocrypha. One is a book/chapter in Biblical texts, another could be within what some thìnk as any number of scripture/liturgical work, & even more beyond, such as quality/scholastic Fan-fiction [for TES works]. Overall, ìt is derived from the Greek ""Απόκρυφος"" like others have said, if not mistaken."

It wouldn't take much more system resources to make the world 100 bigger - it was realistic in Daggerfall - the problem would be to fill this world with content. In realistically sized world when it would take several in-game days to get anywhere you'd have to force unrealistic number of encounters to keep player entertained.

I feel that for some major plot and setting issues, retconning my world with convoluted lore explanations would just turn it into another Marvels Universesque mess.

teslore,3bknzb,Tharghor,19,Tue Jun 30 14:04:40 2015 UTC,"I would question a population of millions. Modern metropolises can support such populations because of the train and truck networks that can move an enormous amount of resources around from the countryside.  The simple logistics of transporting enough food would bring the horse-and-cart freight systems we see in Tamriel (okay, Skyrim in particular) to its knees. Not to mention water supplies (does the Imperial city have freshwater pipework? Water treatment plants? Or is water shipped in?), coal, timber, fresh fruit, livestock etc etc.   Magic-powered freight might provide a high priority, high speed courier-like service, but could never supply food for the masses.   While I'm aware our own world is very divergent from Nirn, some populations of real-world historical cities can be found here."
teslore,3bknzb,WombleCat,5,Tue Jun 30 07:57:46 2015 UTC,"Magic-powered freight could provide food for masses. But we would have to speak more about magickpunk/magitech or, in this case, dwemers."

As someone else commented, a million is not the same as ""millions,"" but I don't see how it would've been impossible.  I don't see any reason why the Imperial City wouldn't have freshwater access. I imagine that Lake Rumare is brackish but we don't know that. Regardless, Cyrodiil has rivers and presumably has groundwater. if the Romans could transport water in via aqueducts, I see no reason why the Imperials couldn't.  We don't see evidence of it in the game, but it's a game. It's not designed to be a realistic city with clear support systems. Bethesda has never put any real effort into explaining the logistics that make their world possible.  Cyrodiil itself is particularly fertile, and the Imperial City has a huge port and great access to shipping. Beyond that, as you mentioned, magic could have provided a boon to logistics. Why couldn't a shipping company have warehouses with mages casting recall to bring crates of food to marked locations?  Ultimately it's a fantasy world. If you can't expand on reality to view a huge population as possible, then you're just not using your imagination."

teslore,3bknzb,Neizir,2,Tue Jun 30 03:26:08 2015 UTC,"Hmm what's your basis for that? In the games, gravity seems to behave as you'd expect from RL physics. People aren't significantly taller or shorter from a stronger or weaker gravity well. Therefore we can postulate that Nirn has a similar mass to Earth's.   We don't have any evidence of magnetism, so we can't infer that Nirn has a rotating iron core or make further assumptions about its density. But without evidence to the contrary it seems reasonable to assume Nirn is of a similar size.   I wonder if it's possible to study the movement of the moons and other visible celestial objects, to get a better understanding of their masses. Again assuming gravity and orbital mechanics hold up."
teslore,3bknzb,OldResdayn,7,Tue Jun 30 04:17:53 2015 UTC,"Nirn experiences auroras, which means it almost certainly possesses a magnetosphere.   As for the size question, Nirn may actually be significantly smaller than Earth but it may have a far greater density - we'll never know how big Nirn is, but it's pretty likely that it's somewhere between Mars and Venus in terms of volume but has a significantly greater density than Earth, and because the density is significantly greater than Earth but the volume is significantly smaller, it has a similar mass (Mass = Density x Volume)."

Otherwise you could get permafrost on one side of a mountain and rich sunny plains on the other. And no day/night cycles.   So if Nirn is clockwork powered, maybe having it rotate relative to the sun was a design criterion.   But if Nirn was built before Magnus made his escape, I got nothin'. Unless we return to RL theories of gravity and spinning of satellites."

It's arguable that The Last Dragonborn is being aided, either indirectly or directly by Talos. It's arguable that the Last Dragonborn, with his connections to Shor/Ysmir and Talos by extension, is Talos helping the world.  The HoonDing is more difficult to speculate on. Personally, I'd speculate it's saving the Make-Way for when the Raga need a Way away from the Brass Walker come Landfall."
teslore,3bk9f1,Alveryn,9,Mon Jun 29 22:47:01 2015 UTC,"I don't consider Talos the same kind of thing as the 8 Divines, they're all dead and he's as alive as he wants to be. He CHIM'd Cyrodils lands and all that for the sake of men, but inexplicably dies or whatever after then just blesses whomever prays to him.   CHIM is used through Love, and his Love is love of mankind right? wouldn't he simply be able to CHIM away any real threats to mankind then or at least help the defeat of the Thalmor since they want to unmake him/mankind/mundus/Lorkhan? I think he's likely playing the role of an Aedra, playing dead while stabilizing the world and providing negligible blessings because he's tired of existing."
teslore,3bk9f1,Alveryn,9,Mon Jun 29 23:15:16 2015 UTC,"He's not as dead as the 8, no, but he's still bound in a similar way they are. He's sacrificed his active self to the Mundus, a la the Aedra, in order to sustain it. I's important to remember Talos=/=Tiber Septim. Tiber Septim is dead, and his soul is only a part of Talos. Talos isn't an ascended Tiber Septim; it's the fusion of three Shezzarine souls by a God-machine that smashed the souls together until they formed something close enough to Lorkhan that it couldn't tell the difference. The extent of his ability to use CHIM anymore is arguable, in my opinion. CHIM is something that requires mortal perspective, and though Talos knows of it the same way Molag Bal and Dagon know of it, I would argue he lacks the ability to truly use it as a Divine. I'm open to other perspectives, though."
teslore,3bk9f1,LeeJP,7,Tue Jun 30 00:45:38 2015 UTC,"I would disagree. Mind, ""Divine"" is an arbitrary term invented by mortals, and means little beyond ""a God worshiped by the Imperial Cult"". Talos may be a Divine, but that does not imply any similarity between him and the Imperial Aspect-Gods that are worshiped alongside him. Talos sustaining Creation does not necessarily entail any sort of sacrifice in the vain of the Aedra, and evidently Talos existed as a divine entity long before Tiber Septim's ""mortal death"": while the mantling of Lorkhan may have occurred later, he achieved CHIM and thus divinity long before he chose to leave the mortal world."
teslore,3bk9f1,Alveryn,2,Tue Jun 30 01:25:36 2015 UTC,"When I said he sacrificed his active self a la the Aedra, what I meant was that his attention and focus is almost entirely focused on his purpose, which is similar to the Aedra giving all of their Selves to Their purpose.

Note, their Aspects are not they themselves, but cultural beliefs regarding them given life.   other than his existence itself serving as a sort of tower   His existence alone is not what fortifies the wheel of Convention and stabilizes Mundus: he actively does this, because he cares for the world and his people.    The Hoon Ding seems to be the only god that actually actively cares for the mortals as more than amusement, everyone else is in it for their own ego   Not really, no. The Hoon Ding is less a God and more a persistent cultural force that manifests under certain conditions, and many if not most Gods actively aid their constituents in their own way out of genuine care.

teslore,3bjm2r,tombobbishop,-1,Tue Jun 30 20:43:08 2015 UTC,That's not what happened. The Imperial Cult replaced the Old Nordic Religion after the events of Oblivion. It's stated very explicitly in Skyrim in the quest where you hunt the animal ghosts or smth.

Since they gave themselves up to create Mundus they are very much an integral part of it. But because each civilisation sees the Tones and Aspects of these Aedra differently they take on different identities through mythopoeia. This results in variants of Time gods, of Commerce gods, of Love gods etc.  They are controlled by the belief of the people of Nirn rather than by themselves. It's like taking a load of clay, breaking it up into small bits and telling 10 different people to make a pot out of it.

The Selectives created Akatosh out of Aka (the overall Time God was Aka-tusk) and I reckon Dragon Breaks have damaged Aka-tusk as well.  As for the others, they follow standard rules of mythopoeia. Since the Aedra gave themselves up for Nirn and are effectively part of Nirn their Spheres are influenced by mortals and since no two faiths are the same each Sphere is perceived differently by different faiths; thus different Gods.

The College did not just anyone entering, thus they would build a guarded walkway to keep nomads, barbarians, the nosy, & those who held animosity toward them (rivals, angry locals, rabble, etc.) out.  Winterhold probably also had a time of urban sprawl [& maybe some shoddily built shelters judging by how much got swept out], so the College may have wanted distance from that as well.

teslore,3bheo5,HearshotAtomDisaster,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:42:58 2015 UTC,"Personal opinion, based on the appearance of the bridge supports and character dialogue:  Two reasons for the structure:   Tactical/Architectural: The ground, pre-Collapse, rose from Winterhold to a set of mountain ridges separating it from Skyrim's northern coast of the Sea of Ghosts (presumably there was some port access, likely to the east, now shattered and washed out to sea).  The College was likely built on a flat ridge-top (or a mountain top was flattenned -- these are mages, after all).  The slope allowed a ramp to the north, but the eastern leg was better suited to a column and arch bridge due to uneven ground.  This would also bottleneck any invaders, making for a nice straight field of fire for defending mages. Magical/Strategic: Constructing the ramp/bridge where it is places the three outdoor mana pools firmly under College control.  Ramp = straight line from Winterhold to the first pool.  Bridge = straight line from the first pool to the second and third pools.  Sound strategy requires control of supply lines, and the only supply mages can't conjure up in times of need is magicka itself.  For that same strategic reason, presumably the three pools were tied into (and perhaps even required to sustain) the College's wards.  Thus, when the Great Collapse occured, the pools and the amount of physical structure needed to maintain their connection where preserved.   Again, just a hypothesis, but it seems to fit the appearance and known lore."

In contrast, the straightness of the stone likely was not part of the curvature of a hill, and the fact that it goes downward into the ""ground"" makes it even more unlikely, as that thickness of foundation for a path that short is unnecessary (to my unprofessional knowledge)."

As this sub has seen, lore of TES is open-source and built upon by many other authors instead of being close to interpretation like ASOIAF, we built this world just as much as Bethesda did, our work is essentially not that much different from adventures players had in DnD, this is something that made us unique. As much as I like to joke about ""c0da makes this canon"", it has in fact, opened up TES to many different interpretations and this is what made the series stood out and this is what made the game's lore community active even after all these years.    This is also the difference between TESlore and our apocryphas, our written pieces itself does not constitute as a world, it is a single-piece of fiction told by your character, just like ASOIAF, and this separates it from the world-building of TES, so in short, even though in your case, people have written fanfictions close to your work, its nature is vastly different than this community writing works on the premise of TES."

I mean, the games come with a modding toolkit, for chrissakes!   I see TESLore as the ""extended universe"". It's all rather different from fanfiction.net stories such as ""two characters experience romantic tension in unlikely circumstances - intercut with lyrics from Evanescence songs!""     From the way he speaks of fan fiction writers, George R. R. Martin seems to view any kind of third-party work as equal to teenage scribblings. I certainly don't care for his tone. He is in the business of providing stories to entertain and tantalise readers. God forbid some young budding writer be inspired to expand upon his work, right?

So:   whether we should give it up   You should not.    whether we can even claim to be authors of our own work here   You most definitely and unequivocally can.  This officially licensed GoT video game is a hell of a lot more ""fan-fictiony"" than anything I've ever read on this sub. This community has its own quality control: a communal canon (""monkey truth"") ordained based on a general consensus of which submissions are quality additions to the world, plus a very liberal amount of leeway for different interpretations.   I'm highly biased, of course, but I think the system we've got going is far superior to Martin's, and the collective body of TES ""Apocrypha"" is of a higher average quality than A Song of Ice and Fire.

Both of those are abolished by HBO, by comics, games, etc. etc. made of his work. HBO is ""abusing the people of Westeros,"" often in ways that GRRM didn't himself, and D&D could just as easily have bettered themselves as writers by making an original TV series. Even if GRRM oversees everything D&D do, he most certainly doesn't oversee everything done by every other licenser. The Telltale games series, for example, has GRRM's assistant as a ""story consultant,"" but makes no mention of GRRM himself being involved in any sort of capacity.    I'd also like to point out that, while he admitted to writing some kind of 'pure' fanfiction back when the term wasn't popular, he seems to have forgotten to mention that he got paid to write fanfiction-as-we-know-it in the form of the Beauty and the Beast TV series.

This is because the protagonist(s) of the game(s) are quite up to interpretation, to the point where by merely creating a player character in-game you are creating fan fiction in a sense. This 'lack' of traditional protagonists along with the support Bethesda provides that you mention, as well as the sheer size of TES accompanied with the various gaps that we fans can fill with Apocrypha, means that what we do here is not only welcome, but an integral part of fulfilling our insatiable hunger for experiencing the lore of our favorite fictional world."

teslore,3biaf3,andyysplash,6,Tue Jun 30 12:47:00 2015 UTC,"I think that Stephen Fry summed it up best at the talk he did at the (2006?) iTunes festival (ironic, right?) - he talked about how all media was once free and that stories were essentially public domain and passed around and embellished by anyone and everyone who heard them and had a knack for words.  Unfortunately, capitalism dictates a requirement for ownership and that anything and everything must be marketable and profitable. Therefore copyright and IP become issues, along with patents. These were meant to be to protect the original author from 'stealing' or using another's works and claiming it as original content in order to make money from it. The problem is that publishers and even some authors have reached the point where they are thinking more about their IP and its worth than the storytelling and its (non-monetary) worth.  There is nothing wrong with using a pre-established canon as basis for one's own works. There is nothing wrong with referencing or using others' IP as long as it is credited or properly recognised and acknowledged as per the requirements of the license said IP was released under. And writing about a canon and adding Apocrypha and other fan-derived stuff to it in the form of presenting your work to other like-minded people for them to read and assess it to see if it fits into their view of what said canon/universe should be is perfectly fine and should be encouraged.  I think it's important to recognise that Everything is a Remix and that as long as we respect the creators of works that are not our own then there's nothing to worry about. You can't own a concept, only the claim to the first idea. And that's only if you are the first to publicly announce the concept, or can prove you thought of it first in court.  I think GRRM is too worried about his bank balance and people 'trashing' his characters. A lot of fanfiction IS written badly, but there are some gems out there. Also, fanfic is one of the easiest genres for a budding writer to get into since it's self-published and depending on the canon chosen much of the groundwork has been done, leaving you free to weave your story within the provided framework and to think up additions to that canon rather than having to come up with everything from scratch.  The only difference between a piece of fanfiction and a novel by a published author is the lack of publishing and the canon chosen. And even then there are books published that use another canon (including warped ones such as the Barry Trotter series).  One last thing - fanfiction proves that the books you wrote were engaging enough that people wanted to immerse themselves in the universe (loosely defined) you created and write their own stories in it. If people didn't enjoy your books then there wouldn't be much fanfiction dedicated to it.  Honestly, the only thing to watch out for is crediting people where appropriate and monetising any fan-created works. Fanfiction never degrades the original works. It either doesn't work and proves the fan's incompetence at writing something befitting of that canon or it adds to the original works. The amount of work IFW has put into Uutak certainly adds to TES for me. I love it. There's multiple new races, an expanded island archipelago and entire timelines with full and detailed backstories for all the races, political alliances and buildings etc. There's probably more in Uutak than in Dishonored. The Dishonored wiki is literally just game dialogue put on separate pages. There's nothing to it. No elaborate backstories or extra information. No Dragon Breaks; no Dawn Era. No Sunbirds and no Tower-dancing monkeys.  Praise fanfiction and the freedom of expression!!!!"

One thing I note that GRRM doesn't make time to discuss is his use of material he did not invent, and material clearly derived from other mythological and historical material. Examples being Dragons, Chivalry, Knighthood, his inspiration from the Wars of the Roses, the Doom of Valyria, Valyrian Steel, and the considerable influence of the Zoroastrian Faith in the religion of the Lord of Light.  I think your points regarding fanfiction have pretty considerable merit. There were times when I was reading GRRM's comments I felt it seemed very legalistic."

I also find his discussions regarding his attachment to his world and some of his points about breach of intellectual property powerful.   Additionally, I don't know anything about the Roger Ebert debacle, but I would be interested in hearing about it."
teslore,3biaf3,andyysplash,1 point,Tue Jun 30 12:26:06 2015 UTC,"Roger Ebert once famously asserted that videogames were not works of art, to paraphrase, and the Internet fell on him like a pack of piranhas. It was an older gentleman expressing a fundamentally flawed, biased view of artistic expression.  GRRM is trying to claim a type of ownership here which does not and has never existed, and the distinctions he's making are artificial. His characters are not wholly original, just as the things he took inspiration from were not wholly original. The concern he highlights in particular here is consent, but I believe it's clear that the kind of consent he's seeking is implicitly given upon publication. This is the case for all artists across all media, so he really needs to just get over himself. I think his position is indicative of a domineering narcissism bordering on psychosis.  The whole ""open source TES lore"" concept is pretentious and irrelevant, imho. It's a way to get people to be more amenable to the premise of unofficial lore (to put it generously). While I applaud this motive, I find this means of promoting it to be misleading, even disingenuous. TES fan fiction is no different in principle than any fan fiction. It can be entertaining, and an effective way of conveying one's ideas. It's not inherently more significant in the context of TES, though circumstance and Bethesda's own encouragement has had the effect of making it more prominent for their franchise than is typical. But if individuals want to adopt fan fiction into their own visions of TES, they shouldn't do so because they've been (mis)lead to believe that the rules on ""canon"" are somehow different in this context, or because of which fan wrote it, or because the fan fiction itself said it was okay. They should adopt a work of TES fan fiction for the same they would adopt any work of fan fiction: because they think it is fucking awesome. It's not any more complicated than that, and I don't see any reason for pretending otherwise.  While I may not aggrandize fan fiction, yes, authors are a credit to the community, yes, your work is your own, and no, never give up until you're out of stories."
teslore,3biaf3,ikar100,2,Tue Jun 30 19:09:42 2015 UTC,TES' very nature encourages fan-fic/apocrypha.  But more importantly:  how can you not include A Khajiit C0DA and Requiem in your list?!?!?  Blasphemy!!!  ;-)

But judging from your post, my thoughts:  GRRM can't stop people from writing fan fiction but it's up to him if he wants to encourage or discourage it. I understand if he wants the setting he created to belong to him more than the community.  But I wonder if it's kind of self-fulfilling. I mean, if the people behind the Elder Scrolls weren't so supportive of the world-building we do, would we have so much of this stuff we call ""Apocrypha"" and ""Monkey Truth"" or just trite and sub-par fan fiction?  I think in a shared lore sort of system like we have, taking inspiration from others is great because it links things together. Of course it's always good to be courteous by giving credit in such cases."

However there are some great stories out there, and that's the best way to view it. If we ignore the typical x and x slashfics designed to sate the author's obscure fetishes then we're left with people telling stories using assets from an already functioning world. Great. Let's see how good their storytelling ability is.  Furthermore, coming off fanfiction.net and onto this sub we find submissions that aren't really ""just fanfiction"" anymore but expand on lore we don't know much about or take TES in a whole new direction. This freedom to write about anything to do with TES and have the community choose themselves whether they wish to take it into their own personal headcanon or not is a fantastic idea. There's some really high quality writing here - check out IceFireWarden's Uutak Mythos. It's amazing.  There's plenty of good stuff here that either expands main TES motifs or carries the lore off in a new direction (part of the point of MK's C0DA)"
teslore,3biaf3,andyysplash,2,Mon Jun 29 20:56:51 2015 UTC,I don't know... I am very weary of expanding lore that way. I like to keep things in order. I am fun at parties. XD
teslore,3biaf3,ObsidiusAnhedonist,2,Tue Jun 30 07:53:15 2015 UTC,I can imagine ;) I just think the concept of open-source lore and freedom of expression within a fictional universe is the best approach as it accommodates everyone - even people who only wish to believe the 'canon'/what Bethesda writes and publishes in their games (but not any of their OOG stuff).  The fact is we pick what we individually want to believe by how much we like it and it encourages good writing to be created. Having lore written and accepted based on merit is a great concept.

And it's also possible to paint an 'inaccurate' picture of the world if you aren't inside the author's head, and since characters are a part of the world I'd argue there isn't much difference between the two.

teslore,3biaf3,War_Psyence,3,Tue Jun 30 21:01:26 2015 UTC,"As I know, GRRM would prefer that people created their own fantasy world and characters because that's the more creative path. What he seemingly ignores is that most of the fanfiction writers aren't looking to become skilled or even professional writers. They just write the fics because they really love ASOIAF. Hell, people write fanfiction because they love a particular fictional world that much. Sure, some fanfiction is bad, but I couldn't care less. Go create something from scratch? Why would I do that if all I want is to write a story about characters I already love set in a fictional world I love more than I'd love my own? Yes, as a fan, I don't care about writing my original fiction when the fiction I'm a fan of is so much better than anything I could come up with.   Another thing. The writer isn't the only one investing time into his work. The readers do that as well, and they often attach themselves to the characters more so than the writer. Because of this they are entitled to write whatever kind of fanfiction they want. TES takes this to a whole other level. Tamriel belongs to each one of us. That's the best approach to this issue there could be, and lucky for us, it even makes sense lore-wise.   I'd say that we are in the right. No reason not to be. And as long as we credit each other and all that, it's all fine."
teslore,3biaf3,ikar100,2,Tue Jun 30 01:15:13 2015 UTC,"One of the things I mislike about fan fiction is its NAME. Truth is, I wrote fan fiction myself. That was how I began, when I was a kid in high school writing for the dittoed comic fanzines of the early 1960s. In those days, however, the term did not mean ""fiction set in someone else's universe using someone else's characters."" It simply meant ""stories written by fans for fans, amateur fiction published in fanzines."" Comic fandom was in its infancy then, and most of us who started it were kids... some of whom did make the mistake of publishing amateur fan-written stories about Batman or the Fantastic Four in their 'zines. National (what we called DC back then) and Marvel shut those down pretty quickly.   The rest of us knew better. Including me. I was a fan, an amateur, writing stories out of love just like today's fan fictioneers... but it never dawned on me to write about the JLA or the Fantastic Four or Spider-Man, much as I loved them. I invented my own characters, and wrote about those. Garizan, the Mechanical Warrior. Manta Ray. The White Raider. When Howard Keltner, one of the editors and publishers of STAR-STUDDED COMICS, the leading fanzine of its day, invited me to write about two of his creations, Powerman and Dr. Weird, I leapt at the chance... but only with Howard's express invitation and permission.   Are you sure GRRM is ignoring the mindset of fanfiction authors?"

teslore,3biaf3,ObsidiusAnhedonist,1 point,Fri Jul 3 21:56:24 2015 UTC,"I'm under the impression that he doesn't empathise with his fans enough.    Whilst that may be the case despite his statement stating - what? - your rationale behind fanfiction and the possibility of him having got so invested in his world that making fanfiction is a vestige of a memory being probable, the problem may also be this:   I were an author, I wouldn't be this possessive of my characters.    How would you know? Are you an author/creative/etc? By trade or at heart being irrelevant.   I get the impression GRRM has a point about fanfiction - generally speaking - given many of the fans do not seem to understand a creative's attachment to their work. In addition, many fans give off this idea that authors are obligated to accept fanfiction and make statements that seem to imply their imagination is being slighted or hindered. If they feel they are as imaginative as their outrage at an author's dismissal of their work lets on, perhaps they should invest that time making their own stories - separate from his - which is his point.   Your emotional attachment to your work does not make it worthy of acceptance, and if acceptance from the from author is not important, why the fuss?   If that is too harsh, perhaps it is best you are not an author. GRRM has been kind in his wording, and that does not mean I agree with him entirely either. In fact, I do not agree with most of his position. I can just empathize with him."

(Like, Uriel VII was like ""get a group of guys when you're working on our fake Nerevarine, it'll draw less attention that way"") And ideally I want the players to venture by necessity to the other provinces to show how expansive the Elder Scrolls universe is while still defining the importance of the Nerevarine and defeating Dagoth Ur. If there's a gap in the lore for everywhere else, I suppose I can just make things up, provided they make sense with the lore we DO know. I want as honest a representation of Tamriel as I can make."
teslore,3bios2,Samphire,11,Mon Jun 29 17:23:32 2015 UTC,"one of the players as the Nerevarine and the rest of them as support   Singling out one of the players as the ""real hero"" is generally a bad move in Tabletop Games. Gotta shine that spotlight on everyone.  I recommend instead doing it as ""one of you guys might be the Nerevarine, but we don't know which. We'll work it out as we go.""  Perhaps even invent other mythic roles for the non-Nerevarines to fulfil so no one feels left out when the real Nerevarine is revealed. Everyone gets to be something special.  It might not be 100% lore friendly, but it makes a better game. Which makes it 100% Nord friendly."
teslore,3bios2,Redwheeler,2,Mon Jun 29 17:34:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I've agonized over that decision lots. I thought about doing it so that they're ALL the Nerevarine, like... collectively, but that is a little too complicated because if one dies early on, then the whole thing falls apart.  I'm basically drawing inspiration from something a DM I played with did with a tabletop rendition of Baldur's Gate with the Bhaalspawn. All characters are considered ""main characters,"" and if they ALL die, game over. I could use that to determine who the Nerevarine really is, so as to avoid favoritism, keeping it mostly random. The one who's left = Nerevarine. Which is basically what you suggested, sort of.  Basically the Nerevarine can't defeat Dagoth Ur and the 6th House on his own (even though Lorewise he can) and so having the benefit of a group for fighting House Dagoth with makes it a little more believable. Only the Nerevarine can wear the Moon-and-Star and must complete the Trials with the aid of his friends, who were assigned by chance, but by DnD mechanics, he's one facet of a group.

And there has been multiple nerevarines before and (if you take C0da into account) at least one after the events of Morrowind. I'd just say that the whole group is doing stuff that is in later accounts absorbed into one person, just like Hjalti, Wulfarth, Zurin Arctis et al. have had their deeds subsumed into Talos."

That fear of failure makes success that much more exhilarating   There are two things to ""fear"" in a PnP RGP. OOC the player may ""fear"" losing a beloved character and either being removed from the game or forced to shoehorn some other character into the setting. IC the character obviously ""fears"" death. A passable player has no problem feeling the second and a good game doesn't punish the player for the GM's mistakes or bad rolls.  I've found that if you need the threat of character censure to motivate the players then either they are having issues separating IC and OCC or you are in a GMing a player vs GM game style, which in my experience sucks. Because the GM can, at any point ""rocks fall everyone dies"" which invalidates any and all player risk.    Morrowind itself is a story-centric RPG and it's incredibly easy to die in that game   Actually it's completely impossible to die, there is no point whatsoever in Morrowind where the player can't simply start an encounter again.

They are playing characters and in the interest of virtual realism, if they die, they die, and I only do what the dice tell me to.  edit: It's not about ""DM vs Players"" it's about ""The Game World vs Players,"" and the DM is simply describing and constructing the world in a way the DM considers accurate. Which brings me back to my OP. I came here for accuracy's sake.  edit 2: And my goal is not to make my game conform to anything that happens after the events of Morrowind. I am not going to force my players to be the Nerevarine and vanquish Dagoth Ur in the exact way the game describes, nor am I acknowledging any lore past 3E427. As far as I'm concerned, my game is an alternate timeline where the players have complete control, should their characters succeed in their endeavors. They can take Akhulakhan and attempt to conquer Tamriel in the same fashion Ur wanted to, if that is their wish.

teslore,3bios2,Sul-Matuul,5,Tue Jun 30 18:28:50 2015 UTC,"Why don't u do it just before the Nerevarine prophecies take place? and just after the warp in the west? I find the gap between Daggerfall and Morrowind would be an optimal time setting for a D&D campaign and you can use events that took place in Daggerfall as examples of what is going on in Tamriel as well as events mention in morrowind.  This way you can have numerous choices for the player in terms of who they may worship or follow. Selecting it after the Warp in the West gives numerous choices for instance a player can choose to worship Mannimarco or the Tribunal or Dagoth ur even as this is the only time gap where these 3 parties exist as deities to follow at the same time as Mannimarco had just become a deity and Talos is still an option that you can choose without a group like the Thalmor trying to end you although they already exist but are not as present as in Skyrim.  It also opens up numerous factions the player could be associated with such as the Fighter's Guild, The Blades, the Order of the Black Worm, The Tribunal Temple, The Twin Lamps, The Companions, The Mage's Guild, one of the great houses of morrowind, the Morag Tong, A Vampire Clan, The Glenmoril Coven, The Cammona Tong, the Buoyant Armigers, the Dark Brotherhood are at their peak so that could be an option, The Theives guild would have the gray fox most likely so they would be at their peak, the Ashlanders and if one is willing even the 6th house and the option for a player to contract corprus and perhaps even become an Ash Vampire or somekind of demented corprus beast if you want to include things like that.  If you intend to actually make a campaign based off of ES you must first remember the way the Elder scrolls universe functions in comparison to the D&D universe, a lot of it is very different for instance in ES soul gems are quite common and Demi-Lichs don't appear to exist and Dragons despite being 4 legged in D&D are Wyvern shaped in ES and their breath attacks are shouts."

And now he's finally dying of age and illness. A coward's death. They say Ocato makes the real decisions. They say Uriel's heirs are really Daedra or shapeshifters planted by Jagar Tharn.

One is a simple adjective meaning ""Changed"", as the Chimer were changed as compared to the Aldmer. The other is a sacred syllable connoting royalty, starlight, and splendor, and also an achievable state of divinity. Beyond this, the Chimer becoming the Dunmer had nothing at all to do with CHIM. Vivec didn't achieve CHIM until well after he and his fellow Tribunes had tapped the Heart.  More often than not, a blue curtain doesn't mean anything: it's just a blue curtain."

It's all in there. It's perfect.  As for the Greedy Man, he's Lorkhan. Being partially trapped beneaht Red Mountain is a reference to the Heart of Lorkhan.

teslore,3bgsrr,PocketWocket,3,Mon Jun 29 08:00:02 2015 UTC,"there's this link   I'll cover the main points: 1.) These are farmers, and all of them have either both soul gems or books on deadra. 2.) Years before the land was barren, and now it is the best producing land in Skyrim, able to grow crops not normally acclimated to the harsh climate. 3.) There was a Rorikstead in the 1st Era shortly after the Dragon War in roughly the same area. 4.) Bleakwind Bastion is near, there is a Hargraven, a shrine, and two bloody rock-Cairns. Also the burial mound of Nahgliivv is very close. 5.) There were old Nord ruins but in Dawnguard DLC turned into a Master Vampires lair. It's pretty close to Rorikstead up the hill.   Now, one thing that isn't being talked about is ""There once was a hero named Ragnar the Red, who came riding to Whiterun from ole Rorikstead!"". It is the generally accepted theory that Ragnar is actually the Headless Horseman.   Second, I think I that (4th Era) Rorik's best friend Jouane Manette who is a ""healer"" is no healer at all. He's a necromancer. This explains lots of things really well. A.) It now makes sense why there are soul gems next to everyone's bed. B.) The Deadric book The Spirit of the Daedra reads like some sort of manifesto. There's a necromancer cult going on here. C.) 1st era Rorik is the same as the 4th Era Rorik. They are Necromancers and able to live forever. Further the Spirit of the Daedra makes lots of references to long revolutions of time, stuff things coming and going in each passage. If this is a manifesto it makes sense that the Necromancer cultists are immortal and watch the world turn. D.) Vampires live forever and the Dawnguard DLC created a Master Vampire lair with a sacrificial cairne -- a believable mechanism for immortality via vampiric sacrifice. E.) The Headless Horseman is from ole Rorikstead. If this ghost is from 1st Era Rorikstead that supports the notion that there were Necromancers or some sort of fishy deadric vampiric cult. F.) I think the old Nordic ruins that were turned into a Master Vampires lair used to be 1st Era Rorik. No evidence, only drawling logical lines. It makes sense. G.) Veeery heavy conjecture here: There could be bodies buried underneath the farm -- these are victims and ""storage"" or whatever. Bodies release a lot of carbon and nitrogen, which is exactly what creates a good farm. Farmers IRL actually use bone meal/blood meal as fertilizer. H.) LASTLY, there is a Restoration skillbook called ""The Exodus"". This skillbooks story is about a family searching out a healer. The family ultimately ends up with a group of ""healers"" who turn out to be Necromancers who resurrected their own son into immortality. This shows that it's been done before, and it also links the term ""Healer"" with Necromancy. It's also worth noting that the necromancers in The Exodus more than likely killed the family -- The Spirit of Deadra (Roriksteads Manifesto) references humans as prey, much like what happened in ""The Exodus""  TL;DR Rorikstead is a cult of immortal Necromancer, deadric worshipers, who exhibit vampiric tendencies as a mechanism for immortality. Rorikstead from the 1st Era and Rorikstead from the 4th Era are made up of the same people."

The Hist sap is the Hist's soul made physical and consumed by an Argonian. Argonian souls return to the Hist when they die and apparently Argonians gain souls from the Hist when they lick the tree. They are one and the same thing.  It would not be entirely wrong but would be somewhat of an oversimplification to compare the Hist and Argonians to the geth with their platforms and data hubs. Or, to the Hist as massive soul gems.""   I asked him for his source and he said ESO, but I never played ESO. So whether you consider that game canon or not.....  Also if they dont come from the Hist, then where did they come from? You said from another Kalpa, but source?"
teslore,3bh245,SolomonBlack,2,Mon Jun 29 06:28:03 2015 UTC,"The ""source"" would be any reference to the Hist as survivors of another world crossed with kalpa aspect of the mythos.   Or put another way the mythology is more confined if the Hist are from a previous kalpa then needing to add other worlds/Godheads to the mix.   Also since this is non-linear time anyways speaking of ""previous"" is actually a lie anyways you can't have a previous from a non-linear perspective, rather properly it would be the Hist that have experienced a previous kalpa but an infinite number of kalpas can be said to be happening simultaneously and at the same time not at all.   So you could well take a position of Q: Are the Hist from another universe or a previous kalpa? A: Yes!"
teslore,3bh245,MareloRyan,1 point,Mon Jun 29 14:51:53 2015 UTC,"From a conversation with Tree-Minder Deyapa, a ghostly Saxhleel:   It is more than sap, it is the Hist tree's soul.  When an Argonian is created, it is said the sap becomes the Argonian's blood ... its essence ... its spirit.    The spirits are what, exactly?    ... are made from the essence of this Hist tree.  As long as the spirits remain outside the tree, its essence is fragmented.  When the Dominion boils this essence to create their foul brew, the torment to the tree and the spirits will be unbearable.   Later:   Our ritual was a success-a bitter one, to be sure.  We died, but our Hist tree lives.  As we return to the Hist, so will the tree heal.  Someday, there will be a new clutch hatched here.  If ever you return, they will remember your courage.   So there's that.  Seems more and more like the Hist are actually simulating a universe in their little tree noggins, and sending pieces out into the outside world in the form of Argonians (mostly Saxhleel).  They're Matrixing.  If it weren't for all the violence they've done to the outside world, I'd say this is a more peaceful way of achieving the Endeavor, or an approximation of it.

teslore,3bg0u3,muhammadli,7,Mon Jun 29 02:22:18 2015 UTC,"Seven Fights of the Aldudagga are the most detailed documents on Alduin's power. In these texts Alduin is literally consuming the world and physically grows large enough to casually scoop up countrysides in his mouth. It's also the first fight where you see Alduin curse the Leaper Demon King to become Mehrunes Dagon. Not so much a fight, more like Alduin overwhelming Dagon and changing the entire personality and intentions of another being. Be careful in interpreting this though. While it's tempting to measure Alduin's power by the feat of producing a Daedric Prince, there's room in this story to say this is false.  It's never stated that the newly formed Dagon was instantly a Prince. It's implied he was turned into a daedra since his home is now Oblivion. However, this leaves plenty of room for Dagon to rise in power among the other daedric creatures and eventually rule over them as a prince.   For more examples of Alduin's power you can read the Five Songs of King Wulfharth. It states that Orkey summoned Alduin's ghost to consume the very age of the Nord people, reducing them to children as it stole their years away. Just a ghost alone is enough to nearly doom an entire race! However, the problem with this is that Nord mythology is a complete mess full of intentional lies. Nords sit around and make up stories, using iconic figures and events as toys to play around with. Then there's the reliance on oral history which is still debatable in its reliability.   So it's up to you, as with most of the lore, on how to take in all this information. Some may say it's all metaphorical or symbolic while others will say it's safe to take things literal. Some may say that ALL lies are based on some truth."

Anyway, you've heard of mantling. Well, why can't there be an opposite to mantling? Where a collective begins to believe something about an individual until it becomes true.

The how and why is unimportant, but it will happen, and nothing can be done to stop it, just as nothing can be done to stop the Big Crunch/Freeze in the real world.

teslore,3bg0u3,Lorkhaj,3,Sun Jun 28 23:43:40 2015 UTC,"Alduin's power and size in his current form likely stem from the number of alternate bodies/lesser clones/Dovah he controls. The Seven Fights states that he's ""spread out like a carpet flame"" across the cardinal directions. One interpretation of this is that he is physically so huge he fills the sky. Mine is that he controls the sky by controlling other, lesser shards of AKA in the form of his ""little brothers"", the Dragons.   His power thus comes on two fronts. The civil war in Skyrim (and other wars in the ancient past) provide souls for Alduin to have the exclusive privilege of consuming in Sovngarde, increasing his spiritual potency. On the other hand, his lieutenants control the sky in all known directions, owing their allegiance and loyalty to him. This literally increases his size and political power, as if he were a whole world within himself. When you think about it, all the AKA shards/Dov are lesser manifestations of Time. Alduin is the ""firstborn"". He's the strongest and most willful of them all. The others are mere extensions of his personality, but they still have Free Will to resist, which is why they develop alternate personalities in his absence.   When he's in absolute control, he covers both Mundus and the spirit world, since he can eat souls that are meant to be recycled or preserved for the final battle. He weakens his enemies and speeds along the end of the Kalpa in doing so. Each soul he consumes is another who could have helped hold Mundus together in the end, and now they're gone forever. Alduin eats it all. One small bite at a time. None shall survive. There shall be no Revolution to overthrow him. (Suck it, Dagon.)"

teslore,3be88t,chrisonabike22,26,Mon Jun 29 11:39:32 2015 UTC,"""Cosmology"" says about the moons that one infinite mass of infinite size can be smaller than another. It's paradox, yet possible. Even if they were created all in the same moment, Alduin can actually claim that he's the Firstborn in a hierarchy of creation.   In Dante's ""Convivio"", for example, it's expressed that the rebellious angels fell in one moment ""as soon as they were created"", yet Beatrice later explains to him in Paradiso (""Commedia"") that it happened ""before you could count to twenty"", suggesting that there was actually something like a period of time relevant to their Fall. It is, however, not impossible to combine both perspectives.   If Creation, Dawn Era, happens in one instant (from our linear perspective), in the endless myriad impossibilities of untime, there's still a hierarchy of events, the narration of the monomyth. Same for the birth of 'ada - they're from untime and yet Alduin is Firstborn by hierarchy and narration. He now exists in a world of time, so being Firstborn would grant an aspect of the Dragon God the greatest legitimacy.   On the other hand, if you don't see Creation as one instant and prefer Dawn Era as a gradual Dawning process (not ended by a sudden ""time shock"" when Auri-El shoots the Heart into the East, followed by a Mythic Era of stabilization), it may be possible that the Akaspirit called Alduin (the World-Eater, necessary for some reasons) was born when the first manifestations of linearity showed up in the Dawn.   So I think it depends on your perspective on Creation."

teslore,3be88t,CreamWafers,3,Sun Jun 28 20:20:19 2015 UTC,"""Cosmology"" says about the moons that one infinite mass of infinite size can be smaller than another.  It's paradox, yet possible.   Honestly, I think it's a lot less paradoxical than people around here make it out to be.  It's an extremely common and straightforward concept in mathematics.  How many real numbers are there between 0 and 1?  An infinite amount.  Is this more or less than how many real numbers there are between 0 and 9?  Neither; it's the same amount, even though the bounds of the latter are larger than the bounds of the former, and indeed contain the former.  (Bonus:  Is this quantity more or less than the number of whole numbers?  More, actually, and demonstrably so.)  For a more geometrical example, consider circles, and line segments.  How many points are in a circle?  Infinitely many.  How many points are in a line segment?  Infinitely many.  And yet you can very easily put eight line segments within a circle.  This holds true in higher dimensions, as well.  Put squares inside spheres, spheres inside prisms inside tesseracts, etc.  They all have the same number of points, and straightforwardly so, despite some being arranged to fit inside others.  (And from certain dimensional vantage points, those squares inside spheres could appear to be line segments!  And the same is true of all the other shapes, depending, again, entirely on your dimensional vantage point!)  Whether something is truly infinite just depends on whether you can reach its end, or rather, whether it has an end.  It has nothing, inherently speaking, to do with size or volume or any of that.  There are all kinds of logical ways for infinite things to fit inside each other, no contradiction necessary.  So, while Cosmology does specify ""infinite mass and size,"" and then claims that the planets are thus ""impossible,"" that it does so is mostly just...  incorrect, and yet another of the reasons I tend to dismiss Cosmology as a whole.  It's a very straightforward thing for infinite qualities and quantities to be rendered within finite bounds, especially in the context of sapient observers.  It doesn't admit of a paradox any more than a number line does.  (There are unavoidable paradoxes in Cosmology, however, which is another of the reasons I throw it out as a source.)"

Leyawin was taken by Whet Fang, most of Cyrodilic vampires of Anvil (and Kvatch if that matters) were massacred by Valenwood bloodlines as well by Meridia followers. Chorrol remained mostly unharmed, although, a little sacked by vampiric armies from Hammerfell coming to the aid to Mannimarco. The city still supports worms. Prince of Bruma was killed protecting Mannimarco and the new one made the pact with College of Whispers. Also city stands as the main power base to invade Skyrim and its influence has stretched all the way to Morthal. Cheidinhall nominally follows Molag Bal, but the populace mainly consist of Vainashazi dissidents. Most of the old body of the Order (including Sybille Stentor) fled to Riften and currently wish to seize Solitude. Imperial City still stands as bulwark for Cyrodiilic Order, mainly due to the integration into the institutions of mortals. However, many of its inhabitants perished in the flames of Dagon.

Actually, now to think about it, almost every continent other than Tamriel is mysterious to us.  Plains of Oblivion: Although we have definitely visited many realms belonging to daedric princes in the past games and heard even more in books, there are still a few that we don't know. Azura' Moonshadow is likely to remain a mystery after the Trials of Vivec when it was forbidden entry by the prince, Namira's realm, the Scuttling Void is without acoounts at all. Besides realms commanded by the daedric princes, there are countless other pocket dimension that we have no idea of, some of which is pulled entirely from Tamriel, such as the Hollow City and the Lost Village  The dremora castes and daedric princes: We know very little about the dremora society, how they function and their political systems, a brief glimpse is seen here and there in books and in games, but the truth is, we know almost nothing about the dremora social infrastructures. And to add to that, we also know little about the political intrigues of the daedric princes.  The depth of Black Marsh: yup, the Argonian homeland, the very depth of Black Marsh is a mystery to any outsider, mainly due to the extreme danger in travelling across the place.  Valenwood: the bosmer homeland is, too, shrouded in mystery, not to mention the connection of the bosmer and the Green,the wild hunt, the ooze, the green pact or the Silvenar and the Green Lady, the province itself opens up a lot of mysteries. The tall trees, thickets and vines made it so that hiding beneath it is very easy. There is a village that returns from another realm to Valenwood every hundred years or so to elect a new leader and then completely disappears again, and few in the world knows about it, who's to say that these hamlets and villages does not exist elsewhere in the forest?  Other creatures and races: despite what we think, we know very little about other semi-sentient and sentient creatures on Tamriel and Oblivion for that matter: are the nereids anything more than water spirits? what are the wisps and wisp mothers? Frost giants? Trolls? Karstaag? What the hell are Ogrims? Are they related to Ogres?

It can be inferred they're not Daedric Princes, as they all have physical remains and coffins somewhere within the Soul Cairn. I suspect they're simply powerful Necromancers from some ancient cabal who pooled their resources and power to create a pocket realm in Oblivion or either borrow or barter for one with some entity like Bal or Vile, who trade in souls. A lot of people believe Mannimarco is one of the more obvious members of this cabal, and it's logical to believe that."

I mean the giant floating soul gems with the life draining effect all seem to be suspended over some sort of mausoleum, certainly. But I didn't think it was established that the gems were the Ideal Masters, much less that the mausoleums contain the physical forms they might have worn in life.  I mean it's a cool theory, but does it have any actual support?   A lot of people believe Mannimarco is one of the more obvious members of this cabal, and it's logical to believe that.   The timing for that to happen is a little bit tight. Judging from previous discussions on the subject most people reckon Mannimarco as starting his studies in Second Era - at about the same time that Valerica was sealing Serana away with her Elder Scroll.  It seems reasonable that Valerica would exile herself to the Soul Cairn promptly thereafter.  So if Mannimarco was a founding member of the cabal then, at the time Valerica got there, the Ideal Masters would be brand new. Well, give or take a hundred years anyway. The trouble there is that Serana and Valerica speak of the Ideal Masters as being ancient. Granted, there's no reason that Manni couldn't have joined an existing cabal... except that the Ideal Masters don't seem like to sort to entertain applications, if you see what I mean.  Still, that only applies if we're talking about the Mannimarco, King of Worms. Mannimarco as the God of Worms has been around since the very beginning (courtesy of the Dragon Break).  Reading up on the subject, it seems that the Necromancer's Moon is likely Mannimarco the God's own plane(t).  If so, maybe Soul Cairn is what that plane(t) looks like from the inside. Maybe those giant floating soul gems are all Mannimarco.   Of course, we could have it both ways. Soul Cairn is the home of the God of Worms and the Ideal Masters are his High Priests ascended into Necromancer Heaven. Looked at that way, the King of Worms could even be one of them. The Church of the Worm (or whatever they call themselves) are probably the only group who would open a portal to the Soul Cairn to bury a fallen leader as well, so the physical form argument can still work.  [Do you ever set out to point out the holes in a post, only to end up mainly agreeing with it? It's most disconcerting ...]  I still want to know what he/they buy with all those souls though.

teslore,3bcv6p,hornwalker,13,Sun Jun 28 13:35:45 2015 UTC,"The Tower. Not the Towers, but the one Vivec was talking about in his dialogues. It has something to do with ""I"" and The Wheel, but beyond that, I have no idea."
teslore,3bcv6p,cfmacleod,11,Mon Jun 29 11:09:55 2015 UTC,"The Tower is merely the shape of the universe when seen from an outsider's perspective. The only person who's ever actually seen it in this way is Lorkhan, when he ventured beyond the bounds of the Aurbis shortly following his emergence.  It's synonymous with ""I"", which is synonymous, in a fashion, with God. Everything in the universe of TES is a subordinate manifestation or component of the dream of God, or an Amaranth of another Dream who has previously usurped God (in our case, Anu.)  Lorkhan took this poorly. He didn't want to be little more than a subroutine in the mind of a vast and unaccountable deity. But he wasn't strong enough to do anything about it. So he created Mundus in order to train a new class of beings, who would be beset by mortality, pain, entropy, and division, and from these limitations would transcend anything the et'Ada could ever imagine. This is a familiar principle in both art and sport: constant fighting against limitations, against boundaries, is the only real path to brilliance. No eternal spirit could ever achieve CHIM or Amaranth in the same way that no couch potato could ever win a 30,000-person marathon race."
teslore,3bcv6p,Mdnthrvst,3,Sun Jun 28 06:54:28 2015 UTC,"I know the story, I just can't wrap my head around it, mainly because the version given to us is through Vivec trying to explain it. The biggest problem I have is one most people gloss over. Everyone seems to forget that Anu and Padomay aren't characters. I wouldn't even go so far as to call them beings. They are forces, the Is and the Is-Not. So when you say that Anu is ""dreaming,"" what does that really mean? What does it mean for the literal embodiment of Stasis to be ""dreaming,"" or to have joined with the Amaranth?   As for the Tower, I know it's an analogy for CHIM. The Tower is the knowledge that you are shaping yourself, that the elements of the ""dream"" have control over the ""dream."" Then it gets confusing. Mainly, how does one ""steal"" the Tower?"
teslore,3bcv6p,cfmacleod,7,Sun Jun 28 13:40:18 2015 UTC,"Our Anu is not a character. He is the Godhead of the current Aurbis, and this is why he isn't conscious or really a person, per se. The Anu of the previous Dream, in a story outlined by the Anuad, certainty was. He became an Amaranth by sacrificing his ego to dream forever of a new world.   Furthermore, the Tower is not an analogy for CHIM. The Tower is simply the superstructure of all existence. Stealing it, or usurping it, is the analogy for CHIM or Amaranth (more likely Amaranth) that you're looking for."
teslore,3bcv6p,Mdnthrvst,2,Sun Jun 28 01:37:11 2015 UTC,"The Anu of the previous Dream, in a story outlined by the Anuad, certainty was   My main point of contention. The Children's Anuad is admittedly a dumbed-down version of the event. Furthermore, I see no evidence to the effect that there can be multiple Godheads. This seems to come from the interpretation (which I think is wrong) that the Dream is anything like an actual dream. Rather, all the reading I've done makes it seem like Anu (the force of stasis and being) joined into the Amaranth in some way. To Amaranth is to lose your ego entirely, and forfeit yourself to the Dream, which is persisted by it's own nature and beyond your control. I see no logic in the idea of multiple Godheads. One being/force that has transcended all forms of self could not be differentiated from another. If the main distinction between the two Dreams is that one is Anu's and the other is the Godheads, then I would even argue there is but one Dream. Statements to a ""previous"" Dream are most likely referring to the Dream before Anu's involvement."
teslore,3bcv6p,cfmacleod,1 point,Mon Jun 29 11:07:26 2015 UTC,"I think the idea that there can be multiple godheads came from MK stating that someone achieving Amaranth would be leaving Tamriel in their ""rear-view mirror,"" which would imply that one can leave their native dream and enter/become a new one.  I agree though that something seems to be off with the way people interpret the Amaranth. My own personal theory is that the so called ""Kalpas"" that occurred in the past were really failed Amaranths, and they weren't distinct from each other much like what you are saying."

Would that be the optimal situation in a perfect Skyrim? No. Is it understandable when a god damn civil war is tearing through the province, and Ulfric actually has to be picky? Yes.   This is a fictional universe where there's no concept such as jus soli or jus sanguinis. This is a universe (mostly) inspired by a period in history where kings didn't rule kingdoms that had geographical boundaries and administrative regions set in stone, but ruled over a group of people - King of the Normans, not King of Normandy, et cetera. I'd love for there to be implemented reforms after a Stormcloak victory that moved Skyrim in a more modern direction, granting Skyrim's subjects citizenship regardless of race (and when we're on the subject of race: unlike in our real world, where race is used as a sociological term for a group of people who happen to identify with one another, the races in Skyrim are objectively and biologically very different), and hell, in my headlore, that's exactly what happened after the Dovahkiin started ''advicing'' Ulfric behind the scenes.  Imperialists love to talk about Ulfric & his gang's supposed racism, but seriously. Racism is a serious accusation. A few ''blasted elves''-comments clearly aimed at the Thalmor do not constitute what I see as racism.  Another point Imperialists/non-Stormcloaks like to bring up is the Grey Quarter. Yes. The Grey Quarter. In a fictional universe where there's no equivalent of our world's UN, where there are no refugee quotas or international obligations, the Nords of Skyrim opened their gates to the storm of refugees coming from Morrowind - demanding nothing in return. They gave away what seems to be a god damn quarter of Windhelm to the Dunmer. With roofs over their heads, beds to sleep in and walls to protect them, the Dunmer sit in their corner of the city and talk shit about the Nords. It seriously grinds my gears when people refuse to acknowledge any racism coming from the Dunmer - because the Dunmer in Windhelm alone alone have talked more shit about Nords than I have heard Nords in the whole of Skyrim talk shit about the Dunmer."

I sincerely believe a united front of independent provinces against the Thalmor - Skyrim, Hammerfell, and ultimately an isolated High Rock - is feasible, mutual hatred being a nice thing to have in common. I think Nords and Redguards generally get along better than most other races in Tamriel get alon with one another, as evident by the amount of Redguards in Skyrim, the two provinces' proximity, and a shared cultural admiration of martial prowess as opposed to the more magically inclined elven and Breton cultures.

While they did lose far more men than they could have anticipated, ultimately the war was a resounding success. The Dominion had gone into the conflict initially only wanting to carve some pieces from Hammerfell, and ended up bringing an Empire that was commonly thought to be invincible to its knees.   That said, the Dominion does not occupy any Imperial province, and thus it is not at all a drain on their manpower. Justiciars and their military escorts are only active in Skyrim due to the Civil War, and even so, do not make up any appreciably large force: their purpose is to arrest and imprison worshipers of Talos in Empire-controlled Holds rather than actively fight Stormcloak rebels, and as such they are relatively few in number.

Except that their casualties weren't nearly on the same level as the Empire, and we have no sources stating that Mer breed so slowly that it would make that great a difference.

They wouldn't: the Dominion don't aim to conquer Tamriel entirely, they aim to defeat the Empire and reduce their opposition to squabbling independent states that pose them no threat. The ultimate Thalmor goal is an unmaking of Mundus: this does not require that they conquer the known world, only that they eliminate any potential threats to this endgame. The Empire, being the only world power that even remotely matches them politically or militarily, is one such threat. An independent Skyrim, on the other side of the continent with no navy and barely any fighting-age men left alive, would pose no such threat.   Not even regarding possible aid that might be sent from their human brothers in Hammerfell, who I'm sure would offer some kind of assistance due to a mutual enemy.   Everyone seems to ignore the fact that Hammerfell is bitter over the fact that no others went to their aid after the Great War: they aren't simply bitter toward Cyrodiil, they're just as bitter toward High Rock and Skyrim. Besides this, two provinces (one of which has nearly exhausted its supply of potential troops, the other of which is still rebuilding from vast damage sustained during the Great War) are hardly enough to defeat the Dominion, and High Rock and Cyrodiil would not at all be on friendly terms with Skyrim in the event that they had sent their sons and daughters there to die for nothing."

Right now, the Empire is dumping money and man power into a guerrilla style war their soldiers were never trained to fight in. Even after the death of Ulfric and his top men, Tulius would still be facing countless guerrilla groups and public unrest. Unlike with a strict military hierarchy, militia groups don't simply disband after the death of their leader, some will certainly, but others will keep fighting. Also, the Empire will be facing the issue of being an occupying force in a foreign land.     The point is, long after it has been re-unified officially, Skyrim will still be a drain on the Empire, potentially for years to come.

A couple of Nords talk about them loving Skyrim under the empire before the civil war happened. Wouldn't unifying it under its (former?) rulers, the Empire, be easier? I guess it could be roughly compared historically to the whole American colonies ruled by the British Empire and the desire to separate from it."
teslore,3bbuea,cfmacleod,2,Sun Jun 28 00:02:33 2015 UTC,"I guess it could be roughly compared historically to the whole American colonies ruled by the British Empire and the desire to separate from it.   I hadn't even thought of that, but yeah. That would be a great comparison.  The war I was talking about was the Skyrim Civil War. You don't see the kind of battles an army like the Legion would be best prepared for, or the conditions that would allow for such battles to take place. Instead, you get hit-and-run attacks on guard patrols and occasionally camps. It's not until after the battle of Whiterun that either side tries to take forts and control regions.   As far as Nords being used to being a part of the Empire, I would say yes. They are used to being a part of the Empire, but not being occupied by it. My working theory on the relationship between the Empire and the Provinces is that the local rulers (Counts, Kings, Jarls) have guards that watch their lands and fight for them, while the Legion protects the roads, keeping a few forts manned to help them do so. It was the same way with ancient Rome in the later centuries of its existence. The legion guarded the roads, because the main point of the Empire was trade. So, seeing your local Nord guard replaced by an Imperial troop, would, I imagine, be uncomfortable.    Wouldn't unifying it under its (former?) rulers, the Empire, be easier?   Early on, absolutely. This late in the rebellion however, it's a dead tie. If Ulfric takes Solitude, he'll have to Imperial command center, cutting off the head of the chicken. This is a flaw in strict military hierarchies. A chain of command is good when you have multiple, complex orders being handed down. Take away the orders and the unit can't function.   The Stormcloaks seem to have a much loser organization. If Windhelm falls, they could still do raids and attacks on patrols. Don't get me wrong, they would never be able to take back a city without some way to re-organize, but they can cause a lot of trouble none-the-less."
teslore,3bbuea,Protostorm216,2,Sun Jun 28 00:51:54 2015 UTC,"You seem to be arguing from how things run in the game but the war as depicted is not the war from a lore perspective much like how Whiterun should have a couple thousand people not a couple dozen. And a lot of the civil war questline was left on the cutting room floor, but apparently still is still there in the data because a there's a mod that restores a lot of it. Anyways point is the game is not an ""accurate"" depiction of the war so its nigh impossible to analyse as tactically.  Given what ""really"" happened is essentially pure speculation until/unless TES VI goes into detail with books.   I'd tend to think its results that matter we have to imagine the actual events that led to them. For example if things seem quite before the Dragonborn picks a side... well the game also starts with the Civil War all wrapped up but for a deus ex drakon setting Ulfric loose. Unless you suppose the Imperial just got luck (which Tullius' presence in the field argues against IMO) then that ambush you hear about probably didn't just happen but was the completion of a campaign. And Ulfric of course had whatever plans he was running kinda dashed by getting captured. So it makes sense nothing big is going on as the Dragonborn enters the fray, both sides have to regroup.   Now for others parts yes after Imperial victory there are plenty of Stormcloaks still around as Tullius will tell you (seems to be a missing quest to wipe out the camps, they tell you to but don't let you kill the commanders) he's going to be in Skyrim for a long time after the victory, Elisif's throne isn't secure, etc, etc. Insurgency is never fun but without a central leader there is only so far things can go.  On the other hand once Ulfric goes independent... well he's probably going to have an economic meltdown happen while all the new trade agreements are worked out. And suppose the Empire gets petty and leans on the EEC to pull out of Skyrim or just installs high tariffs?  Ulfric conquers that more difficult task and launches some golden period for Skyrim. Well for Tamriel its still a net loss. The Thalmor don't have to do anything in Skyrim... they go to now isolated High Rock and chop the Empire down to one province with some scheme. Then its time to march on the Imperial city. Ulfric he's what in his 40s, the elves can wait a few decades and then go after the never-quite-adequate successor with their even bigger resource base. Or wait until they have the rest of Tamriel.   Long term enough Ulfric looses. Unless one really believes Ulfric could not simply rule Skyrim but revive the Nordic Empire as a competing power and start swallowing up the Empire's corpse for himself. I doubt with its iced coast Skyrim has the makings of a great naval power so he's can't take the fight to the Thalmor otherwise.   (Game changer to all of this is Hammerfell of course, but indications are they are pretty rekted themselves thus not in a position to lend alliance for an offensive war)"
teslore,3bbuea,cfmacleod,2,Sun Jun 28 14:48:56 2015 UTC,"You seem to be arguing from how things run in the game but the war as depicted is not the war from a lore perspective   True. You definitely need to take into account the gamy-ness when theorizing, but here, the presentation sort of fits. It is logical that a rebellious group of Nords, farmers, miners, exct. would use guerrilla tactics against the well-trained Legion. Just like the colonialists did against the British in the American Revolution. If Ulfric were 1% a good strategist, that's what he would do. Open combat is what armies like the Legion are good at. Guerrilla war-fare is their weak point.    well the game also starts with the Civil War all wrapped up   I don't see this at all. The game starts with Ulfric being captured, but asides from that, very little military progress has been made on either side. I would actually argue the opposite. It seems the war is in it's early days. To go back to the American Revolution idea, people were fighting for several months before Lexington and Concord. This looks to me like a similar situation.   Keep in mind that early on, even after being captured, Ulfric is still trying to call a moot. The only holdout is Bulgruff of Whiterun. The two sides dance around for what I imagine is close to a year or more. Like two sword fighters testing each others weaknesses, prodding and jabbing, until one final commits, leaving himself vulnerable to attack. This is what you see leading up to the Battle of Whiterun.   After the Battle, each side would want to make quick use of their momentum, which is why it could be seen as things ""really get[ting] going.""   that ambush you hear about probably didn't just happen but was the completion of a campaign.   Maybe this is the case, but I don't think so. It happened at Dark Water Crossing, squarely in Stormcloak territory. I don't think it was luck, or the end of some campaign. Most likely, it was carefully thought out and planned. Ulfric wouldn't want to move around with too many men, as this draws attention and slows him down, so an ambush would work well. Tulius is obviously the architect of the capture, and it plays well with his delusion about the current climate. He still thinks Skyrim is just plagued by a rebellious Jarl, and killing that Jarl would end the fighting. He doesn't understand the depth of the problem. Him making a move to take out Ulfric directly, seems plausible.   On the economy, yeah, Ulfric is screwed. The entire rebellion is an idealistic circle jerk that will result in massive trade problems if he wins. If the EEC is modeled after the real-world East India Company, then that would mean they were basically government sponsored. When the Empire leaves, they would soon follow.  As far as the Thalmor go, I imagine they're already at work in High-Rock, trying to sow instability. From a general anti-Talos stance, it doesn't make sense, but it's a good political move. Remember though, that the Thalmor and the Dominion are two different things. One is a nation trying to gain land, and the other is a political party with a secret genocidal plan (Nazis vs Germany). The Thalmor have no interest in conquering Tamriel. Sowing chaos is a move to weaken the Empire and retake White-Gold.  Long term enough, all men lose. Sometime, hundreds or thousands of years down the line, the Thalmor succeed and wipe men out of existence, and all future existences. They destroy Talos and Numidium returns to destroy Nirn."
teslore,3bbuea,Renegard,2,Sun Jun 28 16:23:54 2015 UTC,"Right now, the Empire is dumping money and man power into a guerrilla style war their soldiers were never trained to fight in.   I don't believe that, the Legion's men come from all over the provinces,and they're even recruiting local nords who know the landscape and local fighting styles better.   Tulius would still be facing countless guerrilla groups and public unrest.   I could see maybe the Silverbloods rising up, but there's no other Stormcloak supporters in Skyrim with the resources or charisma to keep things going. They'd be isolated bandits doing raids at best.   Empire will be facing the issue of being an occupying force in a foreign land   They're recruiting locally, and it's not a foreign land. Skyrim and Cyrodiil are basically states in the country of Empire, if that makes sense. I dunno why people think the Empire's England, and Skyrim's a Revolutionary era colony. Skyrim is Minnesotta, and the Empire's it's US."
teslore,3bbuea,HomageFoE,2,Mon Jun 29 02:24:17 2015 UTC,"I dunno why people think the Empire's England, and Skyrim's a Revolutionary era colony. Skyrim is Minnesotta, and the Empire's it's US.   There is no evidence to this effect. Localized control is much higher than any state benefits from in America. Futhermore, America is a cultural mixing pot of immigrants, not a foreign body coming into a culturally distinct territory. At best, the Empire is the EU, though even this is a weak analogy because the EU was made up of willing nations, and the Empire was conquered. Skyrim submitted quickly to the Empire, but still, they were conquered. It's definitely nothing like the US. The England analogy is appropriate. Much better than that: The Roman Empire."

teslore,3bbuea,karmakeeper1,1 point,Sun Jun 28 21:11:44 2015 UTC,"Either one. In reality, you have to realize that the Dominion is severely weakened, and not nearly as strong as they'd have you think. Their forces in Cyrodiil were completely wiped out, and if Emperor Titus had taken the fight further, there's a good chance they might have won. Aldmeri armies were driven out of Hammerfell by Redguards alone. Alone. What's more is that Elves do not breed nearly as quickly. If the Altmer took as many casualties as the Empire (they did, probably even more than the Empire), then it will take the more than twice as long to recover from such a devastating war. At this point, they're barely managing to hold it together, and the Empire is just letting them regather their strength, when they could actually defeat the Dominion if they got the support of Hammerfell and the Nords, who I'm sure wouldn't mind staying a part of the Empire if they got to take the fight to the enemy.  What's more is that it's much harder for the Dominion to actually get into Skyrim if they become independent. Hammerfell is blocked off, and they have no presence in Argonian-occupied or independent Morrowind. They'd have to go through the Jeralls, and it's very likely that if the Nords can win independence from an Empire, they can hold off attacks from an already weakened force. It would be like Hannibal crossing the alps for the Thalmor to get into Skyrim in the first place, and it will be even harder than Hannibal since the elves have to travel a much farther distance and then find a way to make their way through the heartland of a nation with many strong warriors, when they have no reinforcements and a long way to travel if they want any. And there's also a possibility that Hammerfell might decide to help out the Nords because of mutual hatred. But that's just politics and mindsets, it's impossible to tell what would ACTUALLY happen. So that's just my hypothesis."
teslore,3bbuea,Scarab-Phoenix,1 point,Sun Jun 28 17:26:14 2015 UTC,"And don't the Thalmor enforce pogroms/genocide to maintain the ""purity"" of Altmer bloodlines? (Rising Threat IV mentions it.)

The Dragonborn - between being the de facto ruler of dragons and knowing Bend Will - easily has the power to assume the mantle of Emperor.  Additionally, the Thu'um cannot be overstated as battlefield control. Miraak's Voice split Solstheim from Skyrim; the LDB is far more powerful than him, having killed and absorbed him. With the LDB and the Dov calling down storms on Dominion forces, hampering their movements and chipping away at their forces, the LDB could be a decisive factor in winning another war against the Dominion."

For example, at the bottom of the page ls with the Remanada on, you have a picture of Whiterun on it's hill; halfway through A Dance in Fire you have pictures of Dunmer for some reason;  the drawing of Uriel Septim VII from PGE3 halfway through The Wolf Queen; in The Firsthold Revolt you have Solitude; the Shrines of Azura, Boethiah and Mephala from Dragonborn opposite Mysterious Akavir.

Some of the grades are but 'satisfactory,' and that's because I put absolutely everything into studying for one particular subject - History - yet the grade I received for that subject made me ecstatic, so I see any lost marks from the other subjects as small sacrifices.  My summer break isn't going to be very long - school starts again in sort-of-early-August. So I'm going to be reading a couple real life lore books (one about the origins of WWII right now) to keep myself in the right mood, and there will be enough projects to complete that I will not be able to travel anywhere for more than a couple days. This school system is not kind. Still, the lack of actual school to attend for the month of July means that I will be able to focus more on the mod I'm working on.  I'm posting about this mod on a different account as kind of a fresh start, and so far folks haven't noticed that it's me, which is kinda cool (Edit: Is that not allowed?

teslore,3bdngp,MudMupp3t,3,Sun Jun 28 05:53:11 2015 UTC,"Okay, first of all, I love your mod, congratulation om winning the /r/skyrimmods 's contest  Second, to your question, note that I am in no way an expert at this and there might be mistakes:  The Dreamsleeve as we know currently has two functions:   1.To recycle souls and put them into newborn babies  2.To act as a communication tool for the people of Tamriel, or more commonly referred to as ""magical internet""  This article here makes up most of my source  Now from what I gather, the short answer here is: No, I don't think entering the dreamsleeve is very possible.   The reasons: the dreamsleeve is like a sea of abstract information and concepts, it's  not really a tangible thing, or as the post I linked described it, a infinite river of data. Any soul not claimed goes to the dreamsleeve, at which the identity of the soul is lost (i.e who you are), or scrambled in the vast sea of data, and its spark, its carrier (i.e the power of soul itself) is sent through dreamsleeve waiting to be recycled.  So, in actual fact, I don't think it is very possible to physically travel through dreamsleeve."
teslore,3bdngp,zbzszzzt123,2,Sun Jun 28 06:57:19 2015 UTC,"In my quest, I kill the player, which-after they are sent to the Dreamsleeve for an unforeseen reason (I could tell why if u want, but why spoil it). There, the player discovers that in order to escape, they must uproot the overlords that keep the Dreamsleeve alive, gather the pieces of the Heart of Lorkhan, ascend to become essentially an et'Ada, and then escape (ofc there will be other ways, but more on that later).  Is this lore friendly enough to be loosely plausible?  Oh and glad u liked Apotheosis :)"
teslore,3bdngp,zbzszzzt123,4,Sun Jun 28 07:17:13 2015 UTC,"Ah, okay, let's see.   The player is the dragonborn, whose soul actually don't go to Dreamsleeve after death (because he is incredibly powerful), so that might require a bit more explaining, although I see no reason why it is impossible. And in dreamsleeve, most common opinion is that the soul are white-washed and basically recycled, but I could really how the dragonborn could managed to keep his soul together as due to how powerful it is, so, that again, is pretty much plausible. Now about the pieces of the Heart of Lorkhan and ascending to the rank of an et'Ada, I am not sure how one could ascend the ranks of an et'Ada, but I don't suppose its very far-fetched to at least have close to their power.   The thing I most worried about is that Dreamsleeve isn't exactly a physical place, I think what you are looking for is more likely to be Aetherius, have you thought of looking at that instead of Dreamsleeve?  Regardless, with the C0DA and everything, I don't see how it's implausible for the quest to pan out that way"
teslore,3bdngp,zbzszzzt123,2,Sun Jun 28 07:26:29 2015 UTC,"This is gonna be a spoiler, but in truth it will be the guiding hand of Sithis that orchestrates the entire thing. Sithis will place the player on a path of darkness, cloud their judgement, in the ultimate purpose of killing off the et'Ada, to consume them by having the Dragonborn do it for him. In the end, his wish is to restore the world and all of creation into the void as it was all meant to be (according to him)."

Its the 1s ans 0s that work behind the scenes in every line of text, every map, every character...  Establishing a persistence in the Dreamsleeve seems possible (part of how I invision the Far Shores works...) But actually ENTERING it... That's something else entirely..."

teslore,3b9132,Sakazwal,3,Sat Jun 27 02:51:22 2015 UTC,"Very well put together. I particularly like that there are several dating systems as well as thorough sources.  One thing that mildly perplexes me may just be the early timeline, particularly regarding the Falmeri (Snow Elves)/Falmer line & events dealing with Atmorans (migration/ settlement).  It seems especially odd that Ysgramor would somehow be back in Atmora centuries after he was supposed to have died & buried (unless ìt was his spirit or he was resurrected). There probably could be a range of explanations that could fit the bill.  From what I have seen & researched, ìt seems that some Atmorans may have had a longer lifespan around the migration than  later on. Yet in any case ìt also can be estimated/speculated that Ysgramor made his return at least within the last 2-3 centuries of the Merethic, if we account for the Dragon War of Skyrim & Merethic figures such as Miraak. There would have been at least a good number of years to fight Snow Elves, settle Skyrim, & fend off Alduin & other dragons.  Of course ìt can be difficult to fill in some parts of the timeline, even more recent events. Overall, this is an excellent resource & is greatly appreciated."
teslore,3b9132,Maven_of_Minecraft,3,Sat Jun 27 06:23:41 2015 UTC,"It's already stated in the Pocket Guide that most of the deeds attributed to Ysgramor were probably one of his thirteen heirs before Harald. Since he's essentially a deity to the Nords, many of his deeds are mythic and greatly exaggerated deeds of multiple people condensed into one narrative. It's impossible to pinpoint exactly which historical deeds were actually Ysgramor, or actually historical for that matter."
teslore,3b9132,Cyclenophus,2,Sat Jun 27 08:19:37 2015 UTC,"What I have seen in these comments does make sense. I can see that figures as Ysgramor get many mythic traits given over time, but perhaps the Nords may have also thought that those in Ysgramor's line were almost an extension of Ysgramor himself?"
teslore,3b9132,Maven_of_Minecraft,3,Sat Jun 27 22:19:56 2015 UTC,"That's how personality/culture hero cults usually work, yeah. An entire dynasty takes on its own personality as a kind of avatar for that culture. A good modern example is the Kim family in North Korea. People believe they're all avatars of the same immortal god-king."
teslore,3b9132,Cyclenophus,3,Sun Jun 28 01:39:53 2015 UTC,"Untill Wulfharth's time in the 4th Century, it is said that Nords lived as long as Elves, but then Orkey got Alduin to eat all the years of the Nords and it got so bad that the Nords only lived until they were six.  But Wulfharth summoned Shor, who kicked Alduin's arse and shook all the years back onto the Nords, but Wulfharth was directly beneath and got showered with a bunch of years and aged too much and died.  All that said, the dates given in the Five Hundred Companions or Thereabouts are super dubious."
teslore,3b9132,Maven_of_Minecraft,4,Sat Jun 27 14:16:10 2015 UTC,"That certainly does make sense, though there even some dubious parts could be possible in unconventional ways.  In any case, regarding the lives of Atmorans/Ancient Nords, ìt would be interesting to see if their curse[s] with aging/lifespan had occured more gradually (even having roots in Atmora [/ something to do with Mer]), or if ìt was more sudden. It is as well clear that Atmora was dangerous, so many likely died young anyways. There is so much to be said of original Nordic settlement on Tamriel both pre & post-Return.  Ìt would also be interesting to know which famous figures may have emigrated after the Return/ Conquest of Skyrim & perhaps who was the last to do so (besides Talos theories)."

teslore,3badmm,ryleih,6,Sat Jun 27 08:28:15 2015 UTC,"You're not wrong. Akatosh has the final say in who can wear the Amulet of Kings. Common folk assume it was a bloodline thing, but the fact that the three major dynasties weren't related to one another by blood in any way is strong proof against this. In fact, not all of the Emperors in the first Dynasty were known to be related, either. There's no proof Hestra or Shor-El were related to one another or Alessia. There was clearly some divine intervention involved in their ability to wear the Amulet."
teslore,3badmm,Cyclenophus,6,Sat Jun 27 09:43:24 2015 UTC,"Akatosh has the final say in who can wear the Amulet of Kings   If that's true, it's interesting that Mankar wore the Amulet only for Akatosh to stop Dagon's plan."
teslore,3badmm,Prince-of-Plots,9,Sat Jun 27 10:49:26 2015 UTC,"It is, isn't it? I guess Akatosh doesn't have any obligation to suit the narrative we'd like him to. He's literally insane. If Mankar had the force of will to reshape his Nymic and use Mehrunes Dagon in a plot to conquer Tamriel and make himself a god-king, that doesn't technically violate Akatosh's sphere of ""righteous rule through Divine might.""  edit: Also, whoever won, one Hero would have slain another and taken the red heart representing Covenant. The mythic symbolism of this shouldn't be lost on any of us. To mortal eyes, Mankar and his plans may have seemed evil, but to Akatosh, who represents power and legitimacy, Mankar's brand of genocide and thievery aren't significantly different from what Pelinal did in the First Era."

teslore,3b9xtl,Thufir_Hawat_,11,Sat Jun 27 04:48:46 2015 UTC,"I don't think so. As I understand it (and please feel free to correct me) shouts are a form of tonal architecture and not magic. So when one shouts they're changing an aspect of reality by understanding its most basic and abstract qualities. Whereas when one uses magic, they're manipulating the energy that flows in from Aetherius from the sun and stars. So shouting is reality alteration and magic is energy-bending. Wraith guard protects from the effects of energy bending and not reality changing. But I could be completely wrong, this is just how I understand it currently."
teslore,3b9xtl,heyduro,3,Sat Jun 27 06:35:51 2015 UTC,"I'm not very educated on tonal architecture, but perhaps shouts are magic. Probably a game mechanics thing but, in Skyrim, Spellbreaker's enchantment offers resistance to magic. This includes dragon shouts. Again, it's a mechanic that probably disagrees with the lore but an interesting note if nothing else."
teslore,3b9xtl,_Ralchire,4,Sat Jun 27 18:09:47 2015 UTC,"It depends on what definition of ""magic"" you're going by. By our real-world definition of the term, Thu'um is certainly magic. However, in-setting, magic is more specifically the manipulation of magicka (energy that radiates from Aetherius through the Sun), whereas Thu'um is Tonal Architecture, a manipulation of the fundamental ""tones"" that comprise reality to bring about otherwise impossible effects.   That said, Resist Magic enchantments decreasing damage from Shouts is gameplay. For the same reason that they also decrease damage from lava or ignited oil/gas, which are not magical in the slightest."
teslore,3b9xtl,LeeJP,4,Sat Jun 27 18:52:11 2015 UTC,I figured it was that resist magic is a very broad defensive enchantment that insulates against pretty much any form of energy and while shouts aren't magic a thu'um based blast of fire is still fire etc..
teslore,3b9xtl,Electric999999,2,Sat Jun 27 23:54:33 2015 UTC,"I can think of at least one lore-book (""Reality and Other Falsehoods"") that says at least as far as Alteration magic goes no you are indeed altering the illusion that is reality, and if not exactly a CHIM text going in that direction. I'd tend to think that's actually true of all the schools which seem organize more towards their end effects then any true difference in methodology. Ergo magic is altering reality, albeit in a very well defined way.  I'd suggest that any difference between magic, Thu'um, and Tonal Architecture is not anything fundamental but rather in scope, mastery, and application. To compare it to using a computer, Tonal Architecture is like being a master programmer who can write his own code and have it work while using magic is just being a mildly savvy users with some useful apps. Maybe a script kiddie from a hacking perspective. The difference from a computer's perspective between these users is essentially non-existent though.   Does that mean a ""resist magic"" enchantment would work on any of those, well probably not. Because the actual Nirn methodology is almost certainly more complex then game mechanics. Like you don't just resist magic you create a spell-enchantment that causes incoming magicka to disperse breaking apart other spells. No magicka, no resistance. But if you made a resist fire enchantment that deflected heat it wouldn't necessarily care how the heat was created be it vanilla fire, magic, or high grade Tonal Architecture.   Or not."

teslore,3b9xtl,JaxMed,1 point,Sat Jun 27 06:14:57 2015 UTC,"If we go purely by game mechanics, probably so. In Skyrim, any sort of magic resistance does lower a Shout's effectiveness. Enemy mages can use Wards to negate the effects of a fully-charged Unrelenting Force, and the LDB can use Wards to block Dragon's fire/ice Thu'um.  Outside of game-mechanics, we have this from the 36 Lessons:   YSMIR, the Dragon of the North, who always appears as a great bearded king, had powers innumerable and echoing. He was grim and dark and the most silent of the invading chieftains, though when he spoke villages were uplifted and thrown into the sea. The Hortator fought him unarmed, grabbing the Dragon's roars by hand until Ysmir's power throat bled. These roars were given to Vivec to bind into an ebony listening frame, which the warrior-poet placed on Ysmir's face and ears to drive him mad and drive him away.   Tonal Architecture or not, everything I can find seems to point to the implication that artifacts like Wraithguard would provide an adequate defense against the Thu'um."

NOT writing down what your LDB or Nerevarine did and who got off with Serana etc.) and then anyone can contribute to the core TES we recognise and the games is based on through headcanon and Apocrypha, but having infinitely possible iterations of the world allows for fan-made stuff to exist in its own little place if people don't want to include it in with the 'main' stuff and it doesn't warrant a place as a C0DA...though I'm not sure if it devalues the idea of kalpas.....Probably does tbh"

The Thalmor, and arguably all Altmer, hate Talos first and foremost because of Tiber Septim and what he did to their homeland. In the dying light of the Second Era, the newly formed Third Empire had reached a tenuous peace with the Aldmeri Dominion because Septim and Arctus knew they didn't have the manpower or tech to conquer the Isles in the way they'd taken Hammerfell. Though he'd been prophecied to be the first to rule all of Tamriel, Septim was originally content to resign himself to owning the provinces of men and coexisting with the Altmer.  Then Vivec gave him access to the Numidium. And everything changed.  With the power of Walk-Brass and the souls of Wulfharth-Arctus mingled with his own fueling it, nothing could stand against the might of Septim anon Talos Stormcrown, a fabrication made into reality and registered unto the firmament by a stolen god. Not even the oldest and mightiest civilization on the planet, previously so content and secure in their objective superiority, could do anything but despair as it crossed their threshold and imposed ultimate destruction, demanded  absolute capitulation.  And so in less than a day the ancient, proud, and noble denizens of Alinor were forced to bow before their conqueror, a human, with the only alternative being rendered into a roiling time-wound in the sea.  Over the next century, they were forced to watch this man they could only consider a war criminal venerated and sanctified all the way to the status of a god, elevated to the station of Lord of the Divines as a reward for his thievery and warping of the cosmic order. They watched generations of men live, die, and forget as the story became more and more twisted and the atrocities remembered less and less until this conqueror was the greatest hero of all mankind, absolved of any wrongdoing by the ignorance afforded by generational legacy and selective memory endemic to the very nature of man.  Now remember how long Altmer live for. It's been a little over six hundred years since the beginning of the Third Era. There are plenty of Altmer alive in 4E201 who were around to experience Tiber Septim's conquest firsthand. He isn't some ancient figure of legend to them. Hell, he's younger than a good number of them. Are you beginning to grasp how infuriating it must be to watch generations of humans live and die and spawn and pass on selective knowledge to their spawn that conveniently leaves out everything bad Talos did to achieve the greater good? To watch a bunch of foolish, barely-literate Nords beat their chests in vehement defense of a megalomaniac they only remember from the romanticized stories of their almost-certainly-illiterate grandfather's grandfather's great-grandfather?  The metaphysical justifications come second, and are a compound effect, abstracted by Aldmeri philosophers and theologists to further strengthen the oppositional rhetoric. First and foremost though, they want revenge. They want to right the effects caused from when they were wronged. They want to stop the momentum of those effects reverberating forward through a genealogy. But it becomes a complex issue since the enemy they're fighting is a progenic proxy. Their true enemies are all dead of old age. They're fighting a legacy. The only enemies they have now are arguably innocent, unable to truly understand due to their short lifespans.  Yet still they believe. And that belief is the true enemy. The real target of the Altmer's vengeance.  So it's this really mixed-up, messy issue of how do you exterminate belief from an entire populace that's been wholly indoctrinated by it without becoming the bad guy? Maybe it's unavoidable. But when you look at it from the Altmer's perspective, it's still really difficult to feel like they aren't actually justified in doing so now that they have the chance after centuries of being forced to bend the knee."

His presence fortifies the Wheel of the Convention, and binds our souls to this plane.  2) Remove Man not just from the world, but from the Pattern of Possibility, so that the very idea of them can be forgotten and thereby never again repeated.  3) With Talos and the Sons of Talos removed, the Dragon will become ours to unbind. The world of mortals will be over. The Dragon will uncoil his hold on the stagnancy of linear time and move as Free Serpent again, moving through the Aether without measure or burden, spilling time along the innumerable roads we once travelled. And with that we will regain the mantle of the imperishable spirit.   Talos is a god of Humanity, and the Thalmor hate Humanity.  The Thalmor want to return to a permanent Dawn Era, but Talos, being a Human God, also helps to hold the Mundus together, because he likes his Home and his people. The Thalmor hope that stopping his worship will somehow weaken his powers.  Some speculate that Talos ""mantled"" Lorkhan, the cage that binds the Dragon into Linear Time.

This frustration has led to Hatred in the Thalmor's case, and they want to remove man from the ""pattern of possibility"" (even though they would also ""ascend"" if the Thalmor succeeded) because human beliefs are part of what is binding reality into its linear form.

With those things in mind, and since I can't recall any other Prince having children in this sense (though I'm probably wrong here that Bal and Malacath are the only two examples), I think it stands to reason that Princes who were not originally Daedra can still create life.

Yes.” His throat expanded and he huffed. “They were speaking Ehlnofex?”  “No, but it was enough like it for me to understand it.”   It seems that in Oblivion, the ehlnofex isn't a dead language like in Tamriel, but it's still a living language."

It's not that they don't have the facts, it's because they don't want to see Tamriel go in the certain direction that MK is going in. I, for one, love MK's works, but a lot of people don't and I can appreciate that. The same goes for the books. The impact in the books is not as big as the impact in MK's works, but you could argue that since you don't see the city in any of the games, an neither i it mentioned, it's not official canon. But then again, MK's non-Bethesda works aren't mentioned in any of the games, so maybe they aren't canon. It depends on what you want to believe. A good example of this is this"

Like the example used with Erik of Rorikstead the average peasant wouldn't be able to afford food let alone to send their daughter off to play hero. The only reason the main character is special in any elder scrolls game is because they were born of greatness and were in the right place at the right time to fulfill a prophecy or were sent by the Emperor to save the world. The women who were mages, served in the military or as adventurers most likely came from high class families (city merchant class or higher) who could afford to provide them with what they needed. Being able to light a fire with the twirl of a finger doesn't do you a bit of good if you don't have enough food to feed yourself. The average Imperial Citizen wouldn't have money for bread let alone a suit of armor to save the world.   If your dead set on having a female protagonist from the Niben Valley, at least make her the middle daughter of the ruler of Bravil (roughly 16, shes old enough that she isn't going to be married easily and the family has a younger daughter to marry off to see that the middle child can be safely forgotten about, or rather want her to be forgotten, so they encourage her dreams in the hopes she gets killed so there is no disgrace brought upon their house), so that way the story would actually make sense economically and politically. They would have enough money to supply her, enough clout for her to be taken seriously and the ability to salvage the political situation when she is unable to fulfill her duty to her family and be betrothed to the Duke of Kvatch's son because she is off playing hero and killing slaughterfish for a fist full of coin."

Her father would want rid of her, and since marriage wouldn't be an option the only other choices are kill her (which is frowned upon), or send her off to hopefully kill herself. Her father would gladly give her the means to adventure if it meant there would not be disgrace upon their house. Her father would supply the gold to start out her adventures, her family name would give her enough clout to keep her from being laughed out of taverns and town halls when seeking ""adventurers work"", and due to her sudden dismissal of her family titles it would work out for her father politically.

King Eplear Camoran declared the 1st, Versidue Shaie declared the 2nd, Tiber Septim declared the 3rd, and Uriel Septim VII/Martinius Septim declared the 4th.

Morrowind decimated by ash storms and the Argonian invasion, The Imperial and Providential armies decimated by a war with the Thalmor and each other, Skyrim is crippled from a civil war between The Empire and the Stormcloaks, the Thalmor look on from the darkness as the opposing sides fall. The Emperor is assassinated by the dark brotherhood and the Empire lacking a leader and still recovering from the war with the Thalmor. What I predict will happen will be the fall of the Empire. The Thalmor will finish off the empire by breaking the White-Gold Concordat and instill a High Elf ruler. what the game will consist of may be entirely subjective to what the devs decide will be the most riveting story. It could take place in driving the Thalmor rulers out after hundreds of years of captivity and high elf dominion, or it could be entirely disjointed from the Empire storyline all together and take place  in a far off land like Morrowind. Personally, I believe that the Empire has been in the throws of death since the ending of the Septim Dynasty and will be a shade of a ghost of its former self if it exists at all by the next Elder Scrolls game."

They sort of just decide on when the Era will change based on the rulers. The End of the First Era coincided with the fall of the Reman Dynasty. Tiber Septim declared a new Era after uniting Tamriel. And the 3rd Era was ended by Octato out of respect for the Septim line. Without the Empire, there are no Eras. The death of the Potentate and the start of the Interegrum really should have signaled a new Era, but there was no one to do so."

After the huge gap in time between Oblivion and Skyrim and the looming inevitable second war between the Mede Empire and the Third Aldmeri Dominion, the next game won't be set too long after Skyrim 4E 218 maybe? Regardless of whether Skyrim left the Empire or not it will be seriously weakened and the war this the Third Aldmeri dominion will destroy it (apart from its presence in Cyrodiil) but my prediction is that it will also ensure that there is mutually assured destruction. The end result will be a political clean slate for all of Tamriel's provinces.

I woulden't say it'd cause the end of an era, and the whole dragon thing is mostly isolated in Skyrim, what really matters in terms of what the player has done is Imperials/Stormcloaks, and if they complete the Dark Brotherhood. Killing the Emperor is like, seriously the biggest thing that you can do in the game. Its huge (As yunno, its assumed the Imperials or Stormcloaks would win without us), and that would probably continue to weaken the already very fragile empire.  However, siting with the Imperials would lead to Skyrim unifying, and the citizens of Skyrims hatred for the Thalmor (along with everyone else's), it might cause the end of them and a more peaceful union. If the Stormcloaks win, then its a little more up in the air as we really don't know how Ulfric will do, or if Skyrim would get gobbled up eventually or form alliances with the other independent regions.   I do wish we got to see more of Oblivions impact, theres a lot of implication on how it was like a miniature apocalypse around all the regions but we never really see that too much.  Im going to say it now that they probably keep a lot of it up in the air intentionally so they can work out whatever stories they want in the future while have the players choices still matter. So we don't really know. It seems that despite what we did, the world can shift in a number of ways without our control (we are just one person, after all).

teslore,3b4du4,ATPsynthase12,16,Thu Jun 25 21:39:31 2015 UTC,"Skyrim indicates that the Imperial Legions have been rebuilt, and are ready for war. House Redoran has restored order and stability to Morrowind. Highrock seems to have been largely unaffected by the majority of ongoing strife.   Even in the event of a Stormcloak victory, the Empire loses very little in terms of standing power. Long term viability, maybe. It may even necessitate sending an actual army to retake Skyrim.   It's important to realise that the Empire, as it stands, has sent virtually none of its power to deal with the issues in Skyrim. Based on Thalmor concerns, the Empire is, currently, more prepared for another war than the Dominion. It's possible that, should they lose Skyrim, they may launch an immediate offensive against the Dominion in order to capitalise on their superior position.   As for the Empire's fall... it's been falling since Uriel's incompetence, decades before the end of the Septim line."
teslore,3b4du4,Lachdonin,12,Thu Jun 25 21:54:51 2015 UTC,"As much as I lean pro-Imperial, I would disagree with the notion that they are at all prepared for the inevitable Second Great War, although they have surely been preparing for it to the best of their ability.   It's important to remember that the Empire lost a great deal more during the Great War than did the Aldmeri Dominion, and not just in manpower: large swathes of Hammerfell and Cyrodiil were razed and major cities (including the Imperial Capital) were sacked, causing immense damage to the internal infrastructure and logistical capabilities of the Empire. Granted that this was, by the time of Skyrim, a few decades ago, but damage on such a scale is not so easily or quickly reversed. Beyond this, the Imperial Legion only barely managed to reclaim portions of Cyrodiil by the end of the war, is implied to have suffered far greater casualties, and generally proved inadequate in the face of Dominion military power: mind, this is an Imperial Legion that was able to draw recruits from High Rock, Cyrodiil, Skyrim, and Hammerfell, and had not fought a major war in earnest in centuries. The Empire's military might prior to the war was lacking, insufficient to manage an outright defeat of the Aldmeri Dominion.   In brief, the Empire suffered much more damage than did the Aldmeri Dominion, and while the Dominion has been able to rebuild (and has had to rebuild to a lesser extent) in relative peace, the Empire has had to do so absent the men and coin provided by Hammerfell, and hampered by the financial drain provided by the Civil War in Skyrim. It's also important to note that while Morrowind may have never seceded outright, it's heavily implied that they are no longer de facto an Imperial Province, especially considering that House Hlaalu was stripped of its status as a Great House, and the remaining Great Houses despise the Empire for abandoning the Dunmer during the Oblivion Crisis. The Empire is generally a declining state, and in order to defeat the Dominion, would need to surpass its pre-Great War military power with less men, coin, and infrastructure than it had at the time.   Again, I am generally pro-Imperial, but I doubt that the Empire has any realistic chance of victory against the Aldmeri Dominion unless there is some form of miracle in the form of a Hero, Divine Intervention, or some other unforeseen, mystical event."
teslore,3b4du4,LeeJP,9,Fri Jun 26 01:32:27 2015 UTC,"All of that is true, but the indications in Skyrim paint the Empire, at present, as a much bigger threat to the Dominion than they may outwardly indicate. Their preferences in the Civil War, for example, and the rather dramatic steps they are willing to go to in order to keep it going.   There is also the Empires unwillingness to directly step in and deal with the Stormcloaks. This indicates either a total lack of ability, or that the conflict in Skyrim is not detremental enough for them to be concerned with a speedy resolution. Tullius and several Legates indicate that the REAL Legions are sitting on the Dominion border, indicating that the second is the most likely. The Empire isn't even willing to commit real forces to the conflict because they don't perceive it as a serious issue.   They also do not seem overly hurt on resources, bribing Balgruf, supplying Solitude with extensive provisions (if the Court Mage is to be believed) and having sufficient surplus to bring supplies up through Rotten should it he captured.   Most of the Empires problems seem to stem from a lack of political cohesion and support for the Emperor, and not depleted manpower and resources. Meanwhile, while they are posturing, the Dominion seems far more concerned about the Empire now than they were at the time of the Concordant, indicating ashift in the balance of power. This is also a common theme with the conflict between Man and Mer... Man recovers far more quickly.   The Empire may not surpass the Dominion, but they are recovered enough to give the Thalmor pause, which indicates at least a far more even footing.   As for the Dunmer... Titularly, they seem to still be Imperial, but I agree, I highly doubt the Great Houses see it that way. Their involvement, one way or another, strikes me as unlikely. The only possible support I could see from them would be under the edict of Boethia, but even that's unlikely."
teslore,3b4du4,Lachdonin,4,Fri Jun 26 03:23:35 2015 UTC,"All of that is true, but the indications in Skyrim paint the Empire, at present, as a much bigger threat to the Dominion than they may outwardly indicate. Their preferences in the Civil War, for example, and the rather dramatic steps they are willing to go to in order to keep it going.    Oh, of course. I didn't mean to imply that the Second Great War would be at all easy or quick for the Dominion, only that it's likely that (absent any unforeseen/unknown factors) the Dominion would win in the end. Given Imperial tenacity and the Legion's skill in the profession of arms, it would likely be a bloody and drawn out conflict, as the first Great War was. You're right that the Dominion clearly see the Empire as their greatest threat, and I believe they are: even if they've been defeated before and are severely weakened, they're still the only state in the known world (the great kingdoms of Akavir being a long way off) that is capable of challenging them militarily or politically.   There is also the Empires unwillingness to directly step in and deal with the Stormcloaks. This indicates either a total lack of ability, or that the conflict in Skyrim is not detremental enough for them to be concerned with a speedy resolution. Tullius and several Legates indicate that the REAL Legions are sitting on the Dominion border, indicating that the second is the most likely. The Empire isn't even willing to commit real forces to the conflict because they don't perceive it as a serious issue.    I would think it's more due to the fact that, while clearly significant, the Civil War in Skyrim is of far lesser priority than deterring any potential Aldmeri invasion. The Imperial leadership have no idea when the Dominion is going to strike, but everyone knows another invasion is inevitable: if the Empire pulled Legions away from their borders with the Dominion, it might provide a window of opportunity for invasion forces to exploit the gap and form a breach. This is not to say that the Civil War in Skyrim isn't costly both in terms of men and in terms of coin, but rather that the cost the Civil War presents is lesser than the perceived cost of presenting an appearance of weakened security to the Dominion Army, and risking a potential invasion.    They also do not seem overly hurt on resources, bribing Balgruf, supplying Solitude with extensive provisions (if the Court Mage is to be believed) and having sufficient surplus to bring supplies up through Rotten should it he captured.    Scale is important to remember. While the Empire might be greatly wealthy and possessing of vast assets compared to the Stormcloaks, on the state-wide scale and compared to the Aldmeri Dominion, it's lacking. The Civil War in Skyrim is an asymmetric war, and the Empire visibly tries to expend as little as it can in resolving it: only a single understrength Legion fights to quell the rebellion, and it largely recruits locally. A nation can be in a poor state compared to its contemporaries, and still present a powerful impression when quelling unrest.    Most of the Empires problems seem to stem from a lack of political cohesion and support for the Emperor, and not depleted manpower and resources. Meanwhile, while they are posturing, the Dominion seems far more concerned about the Empire now than they were at the time of the Concordant, indicating ashift in the balance of power. This is also a common theme with the conflict between Man and Mer... Man recovers far more quickly.    Honestly, I do think it's more than a lack of political cohesion. Logically the Empire would be lacking in manpower as compared to the Dominion, considering the great losses it suffered during the Great War, the secession of Hammerfell, and the Civil War in Skyrim (while legionary casualties may be relatively low, every Nord of fighting age that died was one less potential soldier that could be levied for the Empire). While it may not necessarily be lacking in resources, I don't believe that the span of time between the Great War and the start of Skyrim would have been enough to reverse the vast damage dealt by pillaging Dominion hosts to Imperial infrastructure and logistical capability. While it's fair to say that Man recovers more quickly, it's important to remember that the losses incurred in the Great War were far from equal: the Empire had much more to rebuild than the Dominion, whose home territories were untouched, and who suffered notably less casualties. As to the fact that the Dominion is far more concerned now as opposed to prior to the Great War, this can be answered by the fact that they were going into the Great War comparably blind, while now they are familiar with the threat that the Empire and its Legions pose considering what defeats they suffered. One could argue that the Dominion was far less confident going into the Great War due to the Empire's military reputation, considering the fact that their initial campaign goals did not stretch far beyond swathes of Hammerfell: it was the ease of their initial conquests and the relative weakness of the unprepared Legion that emboldened them, and perhaps led them to believe that they could feasibly conquer the whole of the Empire."

teslore,3b4du4,cfmacleod,8,Fri Jun 26 00:10:34 2015 UTC,"I'd go further still.   The Empire is dead. It died with Martin Septim.  There's a few ways to look at this  Prophecy  I can't find the references, but I seem to recall that the Empire was prophesied to fall with the Death of Uriel Septim. I believe it was referred to in Morrowind on a couple of occasions. Also seem to recall Uriel Septim himself saying so, having seen it in one of his visions.  Mehrunes Dagon  It seems to be generally accepted that the aim of Mehrunes Dagon in the Oblivion Crisis was to conquer Tamriel/Nirn/Mundus/Whatever, and that he was thwarted by Martin's sacrifice in the the Imperial City.  What if that's exactly backwards?  Suppose that Dagon's aim all along was the Destruction of the Empire. After all, that's his brief as a Daedric Prince.  In that light, Mankar Camoran is a useful dupe used to kill the Emperor and his known heirs. This allows the opening of the Oblivion gates which, coupled with the Empire's inability to offer a an adequate military response, acts to destabilize the empire's control of the provinces and is directly responsible for the loss of Elsewhyr, Black Marsh and Summerset and emboldens anti-Imperial factions everywhere. Finally, by manifesting directly, Mehrunes Dagon forces Martin Septim to give up his life to protect his people. In doing so Dagon destroys the Amulet of Kings,  ends the Septim Bloodline and drives a wedge between the Empire and the Blades, arguably one of the Empire's most potent forces for stability.  The Septim Emperors  I'm going out on a limb a little here, but I think it's easy to underestimate the importance of the Septims as Emperors.  Intuitively, the Septim Emperors have always seemed more like Priest Kings than secular rulers.  At first glance, this may seem like an odd proposition. The descendants of Tiber Septim have been a mixed bunch, most certainly, and apart from the lighting of the Dragonfires, it's hard to see what any of them have done that wasn't secular and political. The Amulet of Kings can be dismissed as historical loot; the dragon blood as being largely symbolic in an age without dragons.  But I think a case can be made for the Septim Emperors as the chosen of Akatosh; semi-divine rulers who ensured that the divines looked upon the Empire with favour and greatly contributed to its durability and longevity.  Now granted, most of them haven't chosen to pursue that role. I don't see that necessarily mattering once the Dragonfires have been lit. I think their presence had a ceremonial, maybe a ritual significance that went way beyond the deeds and misdeeds of the various Emperors.  And I also think that Uriel with his visions and his sometimes eerie foresight, and Martin with the feats of magic he performed during the Oblivion crisis - I think these two at least show what the Septim Emperors were capable of becoming.  In short, I think the Septim Dynasty provided the Empire with a level of divine favour that was a significant factor in the Empire's resilience over the years.   We might go further and consider that maybe the Empire had a metaphysical role in the universe as well as a political one.  And that with the death of Martin Septim, that ceased to be the case.  The Empire in the 4th Era  In this light, the Empire of Titus Meade is not the Empire of Tiber Septim and is barely deserving of the term ""Empire"" at all. What we have is a Kingdom of Greater Cyrodiil, one that claims the mantle or Empire even as it sheds its provinces.  It retains a number of assets from Empire proper, most notably the Legions which remain a potent fighting force. But whether military might on its own will be sufficient to stabilize the remnant of Empire remains to be seen. Based on the evidence so far, it seems unlikely.  In Summary  I think Mehrunes Dagon's scheme was wildly successful. I think the whole attempt at conquest was feint aimed at destabilizing the Empire and drawing out any remaining Septim Heirs.  I think the Prince of Destruction in one bold stroke ripped the heart and soul from the Empire and that all we have seen in the Fourth Era is a two hundred year death rattle.  And all this time, Mehrunes Dagon sits at home in the Deadlands and laughs himself silly every time some poor fool in Cyrodiil tells the tale of how Martin Septim defeated him during the Oblivion Crisis.

I keep thinking that, in this world at least, it's possible to imagine a cult that existed only in order to perform one ceremony a year. At the Winter Solstice they'd perform the ritual to make sure the Sun came back and didn't vanish forever.  I can imagine the Empire operating on the same basis. One gigantic cult dedicated to ensuring that once every generation the Dragonfires are relit.   And much as we could imagine that the Winter Solstice cults might get supernatural aid from those powers with a vested interest in seeing the sun rise once again, we can imagine that the Empire received support from Powers interested in seeing the Daedric Princes kept to their own realms.  Of course, with Martin's sacrifice other arrangements are in place, and preserving the Empire as a purely political entity.  (It also occurs to me that the Empire as  cult with all citizens being lay members by definition is a very Gloranthan way of doing things. I suspect MK would approve ;))"
teslore,3b4du4,ikar100,6,Fri Jun 26 20:40:37 2015 UTC,"Well, it seems obvious that at least some part of the Elder Council is making a power play. Killing an Emperor is a monumental move, so I think they must have a plan. Historically, the Council had most power when; a) there was no heir, in which case the High Chancellor would rule as Potentate; or b) the heir is to young, in which case the Empress rules as reagent, but the Elder Council actually runs the show. There is a third possibility though. If there was a contested claim to the Ruby Throne, the Elder Council would have the power to choose from the candidates. So, unless there was a severe miscalculation on the part of the conspiring Chancellors, the future of the Empire will most likely be in their hands."

teslore,3b27br,Kurufinve,6,Thu Jun 25 11:20:18 2015 UTC,"As far as I've seen, Sharmat is a term given solely to Dagoth Ur and never to anyone else. According to Sermon 15 we could interpret Sharmat to mean ""false dreamer"" but in the end this is only written as an association to what Dagoth Ur is rather than a definition for ""Sharmat"". According to Sermon 11, we can interpret Dagoth Ur as a similar breed of being as the Hortator. They both unite and destroy but the Sharmat is seen as false, the terrorist to the theorist. So Sharmat is often equalized to ""The Devil"" or ""The Dark One"", a long lasting and specific enemy.  Anti-CHIM is an interesting concept but often left unexplained. He has the power of Lorkhan's Heart. However, Sermon 11 does state:  ""There is no true symbolism of the center. The Sharmat will believe there is. He will feel that he can cause years of exuberance from sitting in the sacred, when really no one can leave that state and cause anything more but strife.""  It's hard to describe exactly where Dagoth Ur stands in terms of the dream. The center sounds like Mundus but it could refer to the self - in context of the Godhead. If it meant Mundus then it means that Dagoth Ur attempts to be more than he can by relying on the world created by the Aedra; already limiting what can be done on greater levels(such as CHIM). He is powered by Lorkhan and indirectly Akatosh. He wishes to rule using the powers of those who cannot achieve CHIM. He wishes to awakened the Second Numidium and reject all that isn't an extensions of himself.  If it means the Godhead then it means he solely focuses on himself as the dreamer, as the Godhead himself and that nothing else is relevant as all will become like Dagoth Ur. Denying the Godhead in this manner goes against the idea of CHIM, which acknowledges the Godhead but still acknowledges individuality. Dagoth Ur closes off any possibility of acknowledging the Godhead for it is he. He does the dreaming and thus all comes from him. So he is Anti-CHIM from an ideological standpoint but not from a metaphysical standpoint, so he gains no powers from it.   All in all, he's just a confused person."

BTW, from what I know, there is no text nor dialog which says that the Thalmor wants to destroy the Towers. It's only a very (very) popular theory among the fans.  In fact it's kind of amusing, because if you read in details Nu-Mantia Intercept, it is said that the towers where created for refusing the world (and the Numidium is the most extreme of them). Only the Red Tower and the Ada-Mantia has a real power of stabilization. The other towers were build for changing the world, and even more for destroying/unmade it.   The Towers built on the Mundus, since the lands around them congealed in the absence of the gods, were unable to match the capriciousness of the Lords of Misrule.  The Elves were dividing; some, like the Altmer, did their best to advocate ""the will of Anuiel"" and so embraced the chrysalis of the Convention; others, like the Chimer, refuted all orderings and aedric measures, following their prophet to ""the Stone that is not a Stone that is."" The most nefarious Tower, Walk-Brass, refuted even more, refuting unto dis-creation  White-Gold Tower is a conduit of creatia, aad sembia sembio, built to bring about a reversal of the congealing spiritual bleed caused by the Convention.  If the Ayleids made their own Wheel within the Wheel, were-web aad semblio, what would happen if they plucked its strings?   Those towers were build by the Aldmer, who want to re-achieve the divine, recusing the Convention.  That's the true goal of the towers : re-achieving the divine, and some (the White Gold and the Numidium specifically) are meant to literally destroy the world."

By contrast, when vampires abstain from feeding for any period of more than a few days, they lose skin/scale/fur tone, and generally appear more corpse-like, and it is in this state that they are unlikely to be capable of hair growth... furthermore I predict that a prolonged stay in their 'starved' state would cause any remaining hair, as well as finger & toenails and non-fang teeth to grow extremely brittle and fall out."
teslore,3ayqvc,Kriegerbot01,5,Wed Jun 24 16:22:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah this is the best explanation I feel. Once the disease runs its course and the metamorphosis takes place, the individual undergoes massive biological changes. Their systems operate in a completely different way in terms of deriving energy and nourishment. While it's not directly supported in-game, I like the idea of a well-fed vampire being able to maintain healthy hair and skin, while a starved one gradually transforms into a gray, hairless, Nosferatu-looking motherfucker.  Higher vampires/purebloods likely have the ability to control their appearance at will though as we see in Dawnguard."

Not really related to the topic but to make something clear with some of the other comments so far... Vampires are undead just like a draugr is but a vampire is kept in a state of ""standstill"" via the curse of Vampirism which causes time itself to have no effect on their bodies causing them to not decay and rot like other undead thus maintaining a body that can potentially still support a mortal life as it is still in pristine condition and not rotted and decayed with the case of a lich or mummy (That's why they seem so close to being alive despite being an animated corpse and If you want a possible answer to how they can be cured its right there) as for them feeding unlike other undead, well that is apparently a part of the curse, they don't actually need it to exist they just have an unnatural addiction to it that may or may not allow them to maintain their sanity and without blood they basically lose their sanity and become bloodfiend like or as in Janus Hassildor's wife's case, fall asleep."

On top of that, in philosophy, this question doesn't have to do anything with chickens and eggs, this is merely stating: If one thing is dependent on the second and the second on the first, what became first? Where is the start of the cycle?  Clearly, with evolution and species, we know the answer. But there are still a lot of natural phenomenas that doesn't work like that. Like cyclical idea of universe.

Well, physiologically, a men/mer/beast are different on a body stature level, and then more so for beast when getting into the inner workings.  All of that probably would lead to differences in style, and large differences in appreciation. With Elves generally being more lean often times(there's a source out there for that and what is to follow, I just am lazy, nor do I think it's largely necessary to quote), the khajiit being cat-like, and nords being a bit more burly, then this would likely lead to a large gap in styles regardless of lifespan or time needed for mastery levels for just being able to move differently.  A breton won't really ever be able to jump as high as a khajiit, and a normal elf won't really be able to do a loud 'ritualistic stomp' of a burly nord. An argonian might wonder while everything isn't doing with a lot of fluidity. Going 'backwards' it might be different, a khajiit might see appreciation in NOT doing high jumps, or just question why they aren't jumping high enough.  Racial Phisiology(?) is a book in-game that says race is passed from mother to child(no orc baby from a nord mother), but that traits from the father are present(a dunmer is dunmer from mother, but has huge muscles from a nord father). Depending on how mixed the world of Tamriel is, there is a varying degree for such differences.  Music is another story, but again, burly nord bellowing vs a more refined Altmer hitting some highnotes. Or an orc being able to hit their large drums made from thick-rawhide that a smaller bosmer can't flick.  Gender-wise, its different again. I say burly nord, but a nord woman might be able to hit really really high notes, while playing the lute."

Kind of like that, except Cthlulu is a giant brass golem for which Cartman/Tiber has the remote control. ""Make him not exist ... and her ... and, oh, definitely him...""  I think this is all tied in with how Tiber may or may not have become a god, thus we're not going to get a definitive answer. However, I think it's possible that future ESO DLC will further flesh out the matter.

Cyrodiil at this time was certainly more a jungle than ìt would be later; Tiber Septim likely terraformed more than changed the climate too drastically (Climatic changes from Atmora could very well influence Tamriel of not most/all of Nirn).

teslore,3ay0td,zbzszzzt123,4,Wed Jun 24 12:21:05 2015 UTC,"I'm shocked to see such a poorly-written article by the wise Gabrielle Benele. Usually she's much more competent at research.   Even a rudimentary look into the lurchers present in Glenumbra, Bang'korai, and elsewhere would show that they are corruptions of dryads.Their base form is that of the dryad, twisted and enlarged by dark magics, such as those practiced by the reachmen. In fact the Wyresses have rituals to convert the lurchers back into their original, Dryad form, or to free the soul of the Dryad trapped within.   I am not certain of what forms the lurchers of Valenwood, but I'm quite confident the Breton Benele has no idea either. It's likely they are also corruptions of a sort, made by the magic of Valenwood or by Bosmer mages. The original creature, the dryad, does not seem to enjoy the form of the lurcher (even if it is stronger), hence the word ""corruption.""    Your hypothesis about the insects that form the locomotive force and possibly even soul of the dryads/lurchers is interesting. It is possible that this magic occurs naturally; however I doubt very few mages would be able to understand oversoul construction sufficiently to do it intentionally."
teslore,3ay0td,Thallassa,2,Wed Jun 24 15:13:36 2015 UTC,"Interesting how the ignorant would assume that of which they do not understand to be dark magic and corruption of the wood. If one were to pay attention to the essay, one would know that magicka and the so-called corruption could of course animate the creature, however, the focus of the article is certainly not centered on that method.  The oversoul method is not theory, I have seen first hand and helped with a bosmer with his creation of Lurchers from wooden frames, and I have made several variants of it. Practical research such as this are essential to a mages studies, of which the author is lacking in entirety.  If the author of this particularly ignorant passage were to spend as much time as I did studying in Valenwood and interacting with the local bosmers, and less time challenging respected scholars, he or she would certainly author less incompetent work such as this."
teslore,3ay0td,Thallassa,2,Wed Jun 24 15:24:58 2015 UTC,"Your ad hominen attacks will avail you of nothing. Unless you have support for your claims (which you do not, because they are false), it is a wonder anyone believes you.   Here is an image of a Dryad spirit emerging from the body of a dead lurcher, after a Wyress ritual to cleanse the land from the corruption of the bloodthorn cultists that I observed myself.   (You could argue that the Reachmen's magic is in fact not corrupt, just another way of altering the natural order of things, but that's a philosophical discussion for another day).   Likewise, the Lurchers that exist in Bangkorai were created in a similar fashion. Here is an image of a spriggan that Wyress Shannia assured me was infected with a malignant disease that would convert her into a terrible lurcher. Speaking of practical application, I slew several lurchers myself and was able to cure the spriggan. Autopsy of the corpses was entirely consistent with the Wyress's claims.   The lurchers in High Rock attack all around them regardless of whatever faction they might be associated with. The are clearly not created to protect - rather to destroy. It would surprise me if the bosmer variations are so different.   As I said, I claim no expertise of the magics that exist in Valenwood. However, I think it is notable that the lurchers that occur there almost entirely occur in areas with a high concentration of dark magic, and very rarely around settlements (which is entirely contrary to what your essay would suggest)."

His reputation even came to the ears of nibenese brass monkey theorists. I've collected some quotes from one of their official publications about the glory of Wulfharth Ash-King. They call it an ""Arcturian Heresy"":    With his god destroyed, Wulfharth finds it hard to keep his form. He staggers out of Red Mountain to the battlefield beyond [...] Wulfharth adopts and is adopted by the Nords then [...] But through Lorkhan he lost his national identity.   Well, let it be Truth that Wulfharth is the Hart-King, the undead Wolf-Deer which ripped King Borgas apart when he tried to impress the Empress by crusading beyond southern djungles. This demon of the Wild Hunt was adopted by the Nords and thus gained his national identity, but he lost it again when he was stretched in a single red, broken moment across all atmoran skins of possible seas and star patterns, almost in the same manner as he had stretched Borgas Broken-Born's guts and bones across the elden roots ...   Anyway, don't forget that we Nords never gave much about theoretical Truth if it only makes a good and necessary story in the right situation. For example, I've heard stories about anti-thalmor resistance in the Raga deserts. Maybe we should make some of their heroes Honorary Nords for the moment and celebrate their deeds in our songs to make sure that they'll be definitely Nords when all Companions have to stand united in thoom and doom at the Kalpa turnaround. It wouldn't be the first time either - do you remember Derek the Tall from the ballads about the conquering sky children and their roaring Voice? I recently had the dubious pleasure to read Melarg's history about the original Redguard hero, some ""Derik Hallin"". He could sing a curved sword into existence, that's probably why he was accounted ... but look what became of him! He's now a true atmoran Companion and drinks with Wulfharth until the World-Eater wakes again.    Ulfgrim of Ystralond"

Guess what happens if a mage from the 2nd Era enters Apocrypha? The very same 9th Era spell tome will be among the infinite piles of books.  If knowledge enters Apocrypha, it is and was always in Apocrypha.

Not everything needs a detailed explanation.  Sometimes, what works best is, ""An unknown hero or group of heroes killed that goblin chief.""  Adventurers and mercenaries are canon, not to mention knights errant, Ordinators, constables, etc., etc.   For big lore events, all you need to say is ""The Vestige"" did it; if people ask who ""the Vestige"" is, no one knows.  It's worked for literally every other game.  Daggerfall needed a Dragon Break because it had different possible endings, not because it had multiple potential protagonists.

Many alliances formed and fell during this time, which is why the war of ESO is an obscure topic in later games. However, the extent of these unsteady alliances are impressive given historical tensions. Near the end of the Interregnum, we see Nords allying with Bretons at Sancre Tor (and then splitting up after the battle when the Nords joined Tiber Septim). Tension and distrust between the provinces of the three banners would likely be the cause of the end of the Ebonheart and the Daggerfall Covenant, but the Aldmeri Dominion has been successful in reforming itself multiple times, including near the end of the Interregnum. Arugulably, however, none of them held a long or legitimate claim to the throne, but there have been pretenders from these factions. The First a Aldmeri Dominion most likely outlived the other two factions, however. Tiber Septim is ultimately successful in his conquests to unite Tamriel and end the Interregnum."

Another point is that there is an extensive use made of soul gems in dwarven automatons, and that to me clearly alludes to the use of ""standard"" magic (Magicka if you prefer).

I simply chalk his personality change up to him being older and more eccentric than before, and having less competition and fewer responsibilities makes him a less stressed out and grumpy character overall, allowing his more humorous side to shine through. I wouldn't read too much into his current staff fetish. A guy as old and smart as him probably goes through a different obsessive phase every few decades.

Of course, he's old enough to have Made Arrangements and then moved on to new interests.  Personality wise, it seems to me that while he still talks a good game, Neloth has come down in the world. Rather a long way in fact. I mean he was lord of Tel Naga. He has a citadel packed with retainers situated in the center of the Vvardenfell seat of Telvanni power. Now he is out in the wilderness, with three followers and a starter mushroom that's smaller than Tel Uvirith was in Morrowind.  In short, I think he's had a difficult lesson in humility. He's not exactly meek and mild, but I think that having to make do for a while has rubbed a few of the rough edges off. I expect they'll come back fast enough once he returns to Morrowind and returns the life to which he was once accustomed, but for now I think we're seeing him at his best.

People who are not vampires can utilize this magic as it's known to be illusiory and draining (beguiling, absorb health, charm, drain stamina, etc.)  If by shadow magic you mean something more like Nocturnal's magic.

Also that list isn't even close to being correct, I don't even think Jyggalag is in it or any of the daedra for that matter. if Vivecs power is measured in being an A-hole to his people then he would be at the top, he held the ministry of truth above vivec city as a threatening message to his people to why they should love and worship him because if they didn't he would drop it on them, then there was that time he flooded vvardnfell he ended up drowning half the population in the process, I believe that is mentioned in ESO."

As for extra-mundrial travel, from the 3rd PGE:   Visits to Aetherius occur even less frequently than to Oblivion, for the void is a long expanse and only the stars offer portal for aetherial travel, or the judicious use of magic. The expeditions of the Reman Dynasty and the Sun Birds of Alinor are the most famous attempts in our histories, and it is a cosmic irony that both of them were eventually dissolved for the same reason: the untenable expenditures required to reach magic by magicka. Their only legacy is the Royal Imperial Mananauts of the Elder Council and the great Orrery at Firsthold, whose spheres are made up of genuine celestial mineral gathered by travelers during the Merethic Era."
teslore,3arqtj,cthulhuh00p,4,Mon Jun 22 23:50:00 2015 UTC,"Alkosh is just one of many Aka aspects, it would be more correct to say Aka is to Anui-el as Lorkhan is to Sithis. The second part is incorrect. Akatosh is the conjoining of parts of Auri-el and Lorkhan, arguably half Anuic and half Padomaic. Shezzar is just the cyrodillic name for Lorkhan, so unlike Aka, the different names are just names, not aspects, so Lorkhan is the same as Shezzar. The correct analogy would be Anui-el is to Anu as Sithis is to Padhome. And I think it is plausable that Aka and Lorkhan are opposites. Shezzarines are not mantling Lorkhan (at least i dont think so), they are just people with his soul, basically the Lorkhan varient of Dragonborn. As for Talos, I am also a bit confused on that, so the following bit will be conjecture heavy. Talos is three people, Tiber, Ysmir, and Zurin. Ysmir was a Shezzarine, Tiber was a Dragonborn, so maybe it isnt that Tiber was both, but that when all three souls came together to form Talos, he is both. Or maybe it is possible to have both, the universe the game takes place in is in the parts where stasis and chaos overlap and come together, so maybe you can have both the soul of Akatosh and Lorkhan at once.  Coc is not a Shezzarine, LDB might be. We have nothing but hints and logical conclusions on whether he is or not, I personally believe he is, the evidence points to it.  An Akatoshine would be Dragonborn."

Him being a Nord is a misconception. Talos might be 1/3rd Nord, but there'd be no reason for the Nords to revere him over Ysmir himself or over Shor/Lorkhan. Really, it depends on who you ask, though.    Point being if you asked MK, of course the Nords wouldn't have forsaken their own pantheon for the Allessian one at all, and of course Tiber Septim wasn't a nord.

Furthermore, I don't see that these writings would interfere with any profit- based restrictions the game may have, since they don't affect the gameplay or anything else. They could've been just there... quiet and silently... but still there."

The Nordic pantheon might have been in there, assuming that with his help it would have won against the naysayers.    Oblivion... I really don't know. I know what he would have liked to make it (more pge1), but I don't know how much of it would have survived the general game creation process.

teslore,3aowyp,TooManyToosters,3,Mon Jun 22 14:34:15 2015 UTC,"In my opinion it would've been interesting to see the Dragons be more of a threat/presence to people in Skyrim. What we got in the game was one destroyed village and ""dragon attacks"" that aren't even on cities, that can be dealt with a few parties of guards and the occasional Dragonborn showing up.  It would be interesting to see the Dragons start to take over entire cities and enslave the people of Skyrim just like in the past, and have some sort of resistance movement/revolution-type event with the LDB leading hordes of Nords to overthrow the dragons and destroy Alduin for good.  On a side note, what if the Stormcloaks not only had to put aside the differences with the Imperial Legion, but beg for help from Cyrodiil to defeat the Dragons as one? The Nords of Skyrim couldn't do it on their own, and the Empire knows that the Dragons would swarm all over Tamriel if they're not contained and dealt with immediately. It would call for some large-scale battles, something we don't see too often in Skyrim."
teslore,3aowyp,andyysplash,2,Mon Jun 22 17:10:51 2015 UTC,"That would be amazing. One of my LDBs forms a movement with Whiterun and Falkreath along with a few other forces from different factions, ends the Civil War to put Balgruuf on the throne (as a semi-puppet) and rampages on the dragons, Bending their Will and killing those who won't obey. Lots of large battles and different classes fighting."

One could see exceptionally powerful dragons enslave & takeover Folk [of Skyrim], but for ordinary dragons that should take months if not years.  While I see the execution of Dragons having room for improvement, ìt could still fit in. Ìt may have been nice to see more struggling with dragons (even accounting for world/skill scaling). Ìt is not too much to think that the most that the general population could do is hurt or critically wound a decent dragon, any more vulnerabilities & ìt is more of a fledgling grunt than a proper dragon. Ìt is also clear that there could have been more types of Dragons beyond most if not all being Wyrms.  In all seriousness, even given such a fast rise of Dragons in Skyrim, ìt is likely that there are many more in Skyrim Alone than we may tend to see in game. Also, while there is not always devasting dragon attacks (which would be interesting to see more of), there are at least Dragon attacks one may encounter in towns & cities time to time."

Most of these guys left or got fired after the game though. Although, Ken Rolston seems to have been responsible for making Oblivion boring (he was lead designer) which is pretty odd considering stuff he did in Morrowind, but apparently he had very strange quirks if Douglas Goodall's interview is to be believed.   And ofcourse there is Kurt Kuhlmann and he is still around, but he seems to be ""hostage"" of marketing forces. There are some guys in Bethesda who tend to stay in shadows and these guys hate good stuff and have no sense of style. They seem to be those guys who do entertainment purely for money. I don't want to go as far to name them, but one was around even in Morrowind vetoing Kirkbride's cool designs. People blame Todd Howard too much really.

Rather than an underground tunnel, this would be the canopied street described above. With the new space in the Temple District proper, the temples to the many cults of the Niben can exist. Each would be quite unique. The Chantry of Julianos, for example, would serve as an imperial library and 'School of Athens' for Tamriel's philosophers and mathematicians.

Almalexia herself retained a huge chunk of her original power, and it had been centuries since she was able to replenish it. Both her power and the power of any artifacts she blessed was ""borrowed"", or more accurately stolen from Lorkhan. He did not have a say in this theft, and once the Incarnate freed his Heart from the enchantments laid on it by the Dwemer scientists, I see no reason to assume those items wouldn't eventually become just regular pieces of armor again, even if it takes centuries. Look at Keening in Skyrim. It's lost almost all of its original power in just 200 years."
teslore,3aocuf,Cyclenophus,3,Mon Jun 22 06:19:59 2015 UTC,"Keening is probably a questionable example, altogether. Its part in the act of freeing the heart could've weakened it.

They became living gods, set up the Tribunal Temple as a place of worship for themselves, and led the Chimer into becoming Dunmer. Replacing the original Chimer worship of Deadra, with the worship of themselves. Now, even after their demise and even when the Dunmer restored the aforementioned worship of Daedra, and even when the Dunmer no longer considered the Three as gods, and instead as saints. Any enchantments or blessings should not have lost their power. As the power of Lorkhan's heart is not cancelled out simply due to their passing or no longer being worshipped."
teslore,3aocuf,TakadiurgaUK_AUS,3,Mon Jun 22 06:01:03 2015 UTC,"The main quest of Morrowind was all about finding a way to remove the Dwarven enchantments on Lorkhan's Heart. Those enchantments bound it physically in one place and allowed the Tribunal and their relics to draw power directly from it. Since the Neravarine freed the Heart, it isn't obligated to allow power to be stolen from it any more unless it wants to. I'll bet those relics begin to gradually lose power the moment those enchantments are removed."
teslore,3aocuf,Cyclenophus,3,Mon Jun 22 06:18:03 2015 UTC,"That's a fair bit of guess work though? I don't see any reason why the enchantments would disappear simply because the Tribunal ended. While I'm sure they would lose power if the enchantments were 'removed,' OP asked whether or not the enchantments themselves would lose power, and as /u/WodinazDeKoos stated,   The Hands of Almalexia armor in Tribunal retain their enchantments after her death. So yes.   However, if I am wrong, please do inform me. I was fairly certain I was correct in my hypothesis."

Look at most Christian holidays, for example. Just pagan holidays repainted slightly, with a sprinkle of Jesus thrown in. The Tribunal, ALMSIVI, did something similar. They appropriated worship of Azura, Boethiah and Mephala when transitioning the Dunmer people into their new existence. They assured them that their old gods had not gone away, and they they completely approved of this change of status quo.  See, Azura never left. She was just the placeholder for Sotha Sil all along, and now it's his turn to take over. Of course, it's just propaganda they made up to comfort and misguide the Dunmer, but it worked pretty effectively. In fact, the Daedra were not happy in the least about being supplanted, and the dark skin and red eyes of the Dark Elves was a curse, but the Tribunal sold them a line of bullshit like the slickest used car salesmen you've ever seen. It was beautiful to behold."
teslore,3al0p4,lumpy999,37,Sun Jun 21 06:04:10 2015 UTC,"As for Dremora themselves, we actually have a story about it. As you can see, the Dremora have a strict military hierarchy. This individual was demoted because his direct superior just assumed he was sleeping on the job and shirking duty. It probably wouldn't go much differently in other situations. The Dremora are loyal to Dagon (or Bal, depending on the situation) in theory, but they respect their own societal ranks and regulations more than anything. They're like the DnD Hobgoblins of the TES Universe. ""Lawful Evil"" to the extreme, so to speak.  edit: Obviously, not all summoned Daedra belong to the Dremora castes, but the situations would be similar. Golden Saints and Dark Seducers have similar cultures. Xivilai and Vermai are both too independent and wild to care to report to anyone unless they felt they had to. Atronachs are either unintelligent are too uncreative to attempt to communicate. Scamps, Hungers, Clannfear and similar creatures are little more than mindless animals. Daedroth/Crocodile Daedra are intelligent and capable of speech, but very selfish and lazy. Aurorans may report to Meridia, as they seem the most competent and loyal of all the Lesser Daedra when it comes to directly serving their Prince. Winged Twilights are loyal to Azura, and Spider Daedra are loyal to Mephala, so either of these may carry juicy tidbits back to their Prince. Anything not already listed is highly suspect."

From Morrowind to Skyrim though, there's few to no instances of a Daedric being with sufficient power, motive, and even opportunity to intervene.  I feel like what's implied with this question is ""are there any plotbreaking moments in this game wherein a Daedric summon with knowledge of a certain past event could have mobilized a response from Dagoth Ur or Mehrunes Dagon, thus altering history?""  I argue no.  This is the best counterpoint I can make against myself: take for example when Martin is in transit between Kvatch and the monastery, or Cloud Ruler Temple.  You use a summon scroll.  The daedra would have to remember where the stars are or identify a landmark, relay this information through the ranks to basically a god, who would have to feel powerful or motivated enough to ambush you.  What we know: 1. Dagon targets the priory and obtains the amulet of kings, so he's pretty plugged in already without the help of the most inadvertently opportunistic summon ever. 2. Dagon gets his ass handed to him during the invasion by Argonians, so he is not omnipotent.  Therefore, 3. by the time he ever learns of the significance of Martin, he's already safe in Cloud Ruler, which can withstand all but the greatest attack.  Therefore: even when the most important plot point is at its most vulnerable, there are SO many hoops to jump through to relay the single most important detail through the noise of an all-front war to an already self-absorbed deity.  In every other instance besides the Martin transportation, there is never (a.) an action the hero takes of plot-changing import (b.) that is foreseeable based on a couple of in-game hours (c.) by a summoned creature with no preparation for espionage (d.) that a semi-omniscient Daedra even gives a fuck about.  In lore, yes they can ""spy,"" or at least provide eye witness primary sources.  Mechanically, it makes no difference."

teslore,3akeon,Ghrimn,9,Sun Jun 21 02:16:41 2015 UTC,"But if it produces such an exaggerated reaction, couldn't we analyze the possibility that the target might have memory loss to some extent? It's a common symptom of people who suffer from extreme rage fits to remember nothing or very little about what happened during the incident or his/her actions.  We can agree that Frenzy does not ""wipe"" the memory of those affected, but I think such a pure and undiluted emotion achieved by the aid of Illusion could possibly suffer from some of those adverted effects I mentioned."
teslore,3akeon,giulianosse,5,Sun Jun 21 05:08:12 2015 UTC,"This seems like the like most likely scenario to me.  The spell doesn't specifically wipe memory, but the state of insane rage it causes would likely be very difficult for the victim to remember. As mentioned, it's not uncommon for people with severe anger disorders to ""black out"" during an episode and have no idea what they did during it.  Also, while this might be more headcanon then anything else, I always imagined the Fury spell's effect being less like how it works in the game where the victim simply goes hostile towards those around them, but rather sends them into a wild frenzy more akin to a 28 Days Later rage-zombie. Like, they lunge at the nearest living thing and try to tear it to pieces like a rabid beast."
teslore,3akeon,MrIncorporeal,9,Sun Jun 21 21:02:02 2015 UTC,"The spell itself doesn't cause memory loss.

teslore,3ai4op,Kastoli,87,Sat Jun 20 11:59:02 2015 UTC,"Is it a genetic 'acclimitisation' from living in Skyrim?  No, it's actually an acclimitization from living in Atmora, but they retained it by living in Skyrim instead of moving south like the imperials.   Are their bodies simply warmer, and better at generating heat?  For a real world example, people who come from northern climates develop a layer of tissue under their skin, which generates a low level of ambient heat over long periods of time by burning carbs. It's not just that they're creating more heat, but also that it's coming from just under the surface of their skin. That tissue helps to insulate them as well, just like a walrus or bear.   Just how susceptible to the cold are they?  Scandinavians and Russians frequently go outside in sub-freezing temperatures, and can handle dips in icewater pretty well. I'd say Nords are comparable.  The more they're subjected to the cold, the thicker that insulating tissue gets.   Are we talking a race of Icemen?  No, probably not.   Or is the cold still as dangerous, it just doesn't hinder them as much as others?  It's probably still very dangerous. I doubt even a Nord wants to get caught out in a blizzard at night. They do build large fires to heat their homes, after all.   Compared to an imperial, they may as well be whitewalkers. A race or species that is adapted to its climate can seem incredibly resilient. However, nothing is immune to too much heat or cold. They'll freeze to death just like everyone else, but the thresholds are different.   I recall a story about roman soldiers under the command of the legendary Marius meeting Cimbri(sort of german) tribesmen at the foot of the alps. The Romans were in full gear and freezing their balls off, but the Cimbri were bobsledding through the snow on their shields, naked.   Edit: Cimbri, not Cantibri, who were from modern spain."
teslore,3ai4op,MrIncorporeal,19,Sat Jun 20 13:50:07 2015 UTC,"As a person of heavily Scandinavian decent, I can totally confirm the cold weather bit. I would be perfectly happy and comfortable sitting inside a big refrigerator all day. And as an added bonus, most of the girls I've dated have said they enjoy snuggling with me because my body is practically a furnace.  Though the double edged sword of that is I can't handle hot weather to save my life. I start pouring sweat if it gets above 70º, and I get heat exhaustion and even heat stroke very easily.  Edit: Also, to add to the topic of discussion, I always figured that the Nords' frost resistance was a mixture of natural acclamation/adaptation to the cold as well as a magical one (Remember, this is a world where magic and biology are closely intertwined). So it's likely beyond that of a real world northerner, but not drastically so. Perhaps they're similar in what they find comfortable, but are more resistant to the harmful effects of the cold like hypothermia and frostbite (similar to many cold-climate mammals)."

teslore,3ai4op,faerakhasa,3,Sat Jun 20 22:35:21 2015 UTC,No active volcano but there are hot springs. This would imply volcanic activity underground.
teslore,3ai4op,hornwalker,3,Sun Jun 21 00:31:01 2015 UTC,"Red Mountain is the tallest volcano on Tamriel. ""Tallest"" suggests that there are shorter ones out there somewhere."
teslore,3ai4op,Xhylorekihel,6,Sat Jun 20 21:20:13 2015 UTC,"I'm going to suggest that it is an inherent magical resistance and has less to do with them being descended from Atmora and more akin to the other races inherent magical properties.   So in other words, its less biological(being warmer to survive the environment) and more magical(some Aedra gift or something left over from creation)."
teslore,3ai4op,Cyclenophus,11,Sun Jun 21 00:30:29 2015 UTC,"Well, since they technically came from Atmora, a frozen continent in the North, I would assume that their resistance to frost was an acclimatization, but became genetic overtime as they lived in Atmora, then migrated to Skyrim, where it is still very cold."
teslore,3ai4op,Protostorm216,17,Sat Jun 20 15:09:44 2015 UTC,"Atmora wasn't always frozen, though. The ""freezing over"" was fairly rapid, and was the main reason the Nords moved away to Tamriel in waves over several centuries. Atmora at its peak was described as ""the land of the distant green summers"", implying it was a temperate continent. Old legends and stories from Atmora are invariably about hunting or fishing, as well. I'd wager it was far from the current frozen wasteland for the majority of the time the Nords' ancestors lived there.   edit: Of course, this could still be plenty of time to magically influence the Nordic racial ""evolution"". Such a mechanic would presumably work very differently on Nirn, which is a magical world of somewhere between 6,000 to 8,000 years old, in comparison to our own mundane world which is probably 4.6 billion years or somewhere in that neighborhood, based on the best current scientific understanding. We have many legends of how the various Elven races evolved on Nirn, and all of them did so rapidly due to divine or otherwise magical means. We know less about the divergence of the races of Men, especially how the Yokudans and Akaviri split apart from their Tamrielic cousins. I'd assume magic influenced their evolution, too, except presumably in a different way, since Elves and Men are pretty different, though related distantly."
teslore,3ai4op,Cheydin,3,Sat Jun 20 12:22:50 2015 UTC,"Bout as much as someone born in the baltics I'd say, but I don't think it's ever been expanded on.

I dunno about tanking ice spikes, but they could probably live through Cyrodiil's snowball looking frost spells."

teslore,3ai4op,Lorkhaj,1 point,Sat Jun 20 20:11:11 2015 UTC,"It's basically they can ""shrug it off"" much better than the other races. A Nord would have no problem going shirtless on a brisk day, hell they'd be comfortable. They're able to move much better in snow and survive longer in a snowstorm than other races. Frost-based attacks still hurt them, but to a far less severe degree than others.  Basically while they're not impervious, they're extremely resilient. Cold just has less of a detrimental effect on them. I feel like a naked Nord would be able to trudge through a blizzard for at least the better part of a day before keeling over, and if they found a cave to get out of direct exposure they'd likely die of starvation before cold."
teslore,3ai4op,ATPsynthase12,1 point,Sat Jun 20 20:23:50 2015 UTC,What I'm more curious about is why they have Shock resistance in Morrowind but in no other game.  And what in the hell is a Star of the West?
teslore,3ai4op,ObsidiusAnhedonist,1 point,Sat Jun 20 17:56:06 2015 UTC,"it is acclimation, but biologically they would lose this acclimation in a few generations of living outside of skyrim.

What if you shouted ""Slen Qeth""? Or just ""Slen"" with the intention for one of the shouts and then again meaning a different shout?"
teslore,3aima5,iizmiraak,3,Sat Jun 20 19:29:04 2015 UTC,"Much of the power in a shout comes from the next words, using only one or two would not produce the same effect (as is shown by the games). That's what a shout is, powerful words."
teslore,3aima5,elderscroll_dot_pdf,7,Sat Jun 20 19:37:30 2015 UTC,"Well, considering we know precious little about either Flesh Magic or the creation of Rotmulaag, I can't really confirm or deny anything. Surely a skilled enough Tongue with a good understanding of Flesh Magic could pull this off, but no normal person would be able to use these shouts, that's for sure. They probably wouldn't want to, either."
teslore,3aima5,elderscroll_dot_pdf,3,Sat Jun 20 15:32:00 2015 UTC,"interesting idea, what you are implying is that the thu'um is a tool you could use for the desired discipline. Much like durnheviir did, he started to learn about necromancy, using the thu'um as a tool to amplify the power he gain from knowledge.   This can also apply to miraak, who learnt ""bend will"" from herma-mora, basically herma thought him how to bend time, and since dragons are time shards, he use his knowledge in the form of a thu'um to control them.  This could be applied to create awesome dargonborn charcters, just imagine a moth priest dragonborn! the thu'um combined with the insight of the elder scrolls.   You have give me a lot to think about, thank you very much!"
teslore,3aima5,avalon1805,6,Mon Jun 22 02:23:20 2015 UTC,"I think these could work, but I also wonder if the final action word you have should be moved to the front? For example ""krenok slen qeth,"" instead.  In Skyrim, the first word is usually what guides the remaining words-- for example with Fus Roh Dah, Fus is a force, Roh balances it, and Dah pushes it further/enhances it. But the initial word, Fus is what's actually happening. That way, if someone were to only say the first word in one of your shouts, say krenok, there would be some guiding influence for the results. It would maybe divide the target into two, less specific pieces. The following words would define what they're divided into."
teslore,3aima5,gro-Muluk,5,Sat Jun 20 19:51:04 2015 UTC,I agree.

To me, Pastafarianism is entirely satirical of religion, particularly Christianity, and the Jedi Temple (never heard of this before your post), I would suspect, is just a group of Star Wars fans. All those people are probably atheists at heart.  Similarly, I'd doubt that anyone in the real world believes in/worships/has faith in the Divines or the Tribunal or the Daedra as divine beings in our universe. Often, within the context of the lore or when roleplaying, people might say ""I swear to Talos that X, Y, and/or Z"" or ""Nine Divines? Surely, you mean the Eight."", but nobody has a real-world religious faith or zeal for any of these gods.  Besides, there are enough troubles with religious disputes/persecution in the real world with the limited amount of major religions we currently have. We don't need more."

I hope not, and if a TES-based religion were to exist, chances are we would have heard of it.  The TES world structure particularly borrows a lot from gnosticism. The Thalmor belief system according to which the Atlmer should escape the trap that is the mortal world, is also quite similar to gnostic philosophy. And there's more. The concept of gnosis, secret knowledge is pretty common in TES, also notice how both gnosticism and TES mythology are not based solely on beliefs or dogma. Part of what sets TES metaphysics apart from other fictional and even real-life myths and meta concepts is that it's not just ""this god is that because we say so"", all is explained or can be explained. I think gnosticism is the religion that best resembles TES myths. Not many gnostics out there though, and gnosticism is hardly an organized religion as far as I know.   On a different note, there are a lot of interesting belief systems in Tamriel, and some of them could be regarded as inspiring."

teslore,3aect9,cthulhuh00p,34,Sat Jun 20 16:18:35 2015 UTC,"People seem to be saying ""Yes"" due to the fact that his domain is addiction and the violence in debauchery and clouded judgement. But domain is just one thing, actions speak stronger. After all, there are Princes with non-Evil domains (Hunt, Knowledge, Order, Life) still are ""evil' for how they act out those domains (though perhaps I'm the only one who thinks Meridia is evil).  So Judging Sanguine by his Actions: He has appeared in three games, Skyrim, Oblivion, and Daggerfall.  In Skyrim he orchestrates a drinking contest and some late-night but ultimately rather harmless debauchery. Not really that bad.  In Oblivion he strips a dinner party hosted by a pure evil woman naked. Again not bad.  His actions in Daggerfall are likely the worst, as EVERY Daedric Prince wanted you to murder someone for a usually morally questionable reason (hell, Azura wants you to murder a man for SAYING RUDE THINGS ABOUT HER). Yet Sanguine is one of the few who's request for murder seems... reasonable. He wants you to kill a priest, a zealous priest who burned several Sanguine worshipers alive. So Sanguine seems to have an affection for his followers, and a sense of justice when someone harms one.  Lorewise:  Martin Septim states that he and his friends got in over their heads in the Cult of Sanguine and a bunch were killed in some sort of accident. So a mark against Sanguine for encouraging the sorts of actions that probably lead to this accident.  Sanguine's cultists in Oblivion view him favorably. And why not?? He's the guardian of minor sinners, those engaged in sloth, lust, drunkenness, and debauchery.  The most interesting action Sanguine has taken is the creation of many powerful items only to give them to Mephala for use by the Morag Tong. At first, it's not obvious why these two entities would co-operate, but then there is overlap with Mephala's sphere in sex and Sanguine's sphere in debauchery and hedonism.  Overall, I'd say he's VERY comparable to Namira. Both could be said to be evil for they encourage their followers in to dangerous and sinful practices. But on the other hand, both seem to be actually interested in protecting and/or avenging the sinners they reign over.  So I'd say he's not that bad. There are always going to be hedonistic people living dangerous lifestyles, so it's good that they have someone out there protecting them, at the very least."
teslore,3aect9,BanditoWalrus,10,Fri Jun 19 14:52:53 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure Sanguine is necessarily acting out of a sense of justice. It's maybe more likely that, since the cultists were his, he just absolutely cannot stand anyone damaging something that he's claimed for himself. He'd be happy to let his worshipers burn if he was the one doing the burning, but someone else doing it is an affront, a challenge to his power. He can't let that go unanswered. So it's less a sense of affection or justice and more a schoolyard bully lashing out at someone who insulted him. My understanding of daedric princes is that they tend to be extremely self-absorbed and incredibly jealous of their own spheres, and any interference with what they see as theirs would be met with swift retribution. It just so happens that in this case that because the insult would also be a crime, punishing the perpetrators meshes with our notions of justice."

Also,  if we look at Sanguine's Daggerfall dialog, we have evidence contrary to your idea:   (monk's name) is (his) name and (he) burned my lovely worshippers to crisps.   Sanguine considers his worshipers LOVELY. He doesn't view them as mere playthings like Sheogorath, but cherishes them."

My interpretation is that more importance should be placed on ""my"" than on ""lovely,"" and that the thing which makes the worshipers lovely is that they are his. Their loveliness in his eyes is nothing to do with themselves or any of their inherent characteristics, they are lovely because they're his. He doesn't care for them as individuals, as people the way we might. They're cherished, but only because they enhance his position. When they're burned the loss is not of precious, irreplaceable individuals with cares and hopes and memories, the loss that he laments is the decrease in the number of worshipers that he can claim. It's an entirely selfish motivation. At least that's how I interpret it."

So a mark against Sanguine for encouraging the sorts of actions that probably lead to this accident.   Given how prone the Sanguine Rose is to malfunctioning in Oblivion (the Daedra it summons turn on you pretty frequently) it seems like a likely candidate for a fatal accident.  Side note: I would give anything to know exactly what sort of quest Martin had to do to get the Rose.

That makes you an incredibly valuable (if ever-difficult to control) pawn, and thus they won't treat you as badly as an average mortal. This isn't to say that average Daedra-worshipping mortals don't get some perks from their choice of deity, it's just that they generally get the bad stuff as well, unless they can prove themselves as pawns of similar value to a Hero.  So while Sanguine might seem to be a rowdy, jolly bloke to the COC or LDB, an average worshipper of him can probably expect to get hooked on a variety of drugs, engage in orgies that leave all of their orifices non-functional for weeks, and die young even by Tamrielic standards."

If your reply is ""fuck those people"", you'd make a good Sanguinite.  I think its enough for someone to enjoy themselves as they will, in a fashion that avoids unnecessarily inflicting it on others. It is also necessary for those others to avoid going out of their way to expose someone else's good time they don't approve of.

The temple considers worship or adoration of any daedra a form of unenlightened paganism, bordering on witchcraft depending on the form the adoration takes. It's not looked upon kindly, even if the adoration is of Azura, Boethiah or Mephala. The Ordinators and priests would sternly warn you that such alien deities are not worthy of worship, and that the kindly, living gods of the Dunmer vanquished them for a reason.   If you're an Ashlander, or it's your first offense, you may be spared. Otherwise, they'll stick you up on a spike and roast you like a pig faster than you can say ""N'wah"". They'll make sure you suffer if the Daedra you're caught worshiping is one of the House of Troubles, especially the nefarious Sheogorath.

teslore,3aa0f7,LifeOnMarsden,84,Thu Jun 18 12:20:06 2015 UTC,"Dragons do not die when killed by anything without the blood/soul of a dragon. Their soul remains firmly tied to their body, hence the ability to be revived by Alduin.  Durhenviir is different because he sold his soul to the ideal masters of the soul cairn, tying himself to their realm of oblivion, unable to return to Nirn/Mundus."
teslore,3aa0f7,ASAMANNAMMEDNIGEL,20,Thu Jun 18 13:28:25 2015 UTC,"About that what if someone like Mannimarco came across a dragon, he don't have a dragon soul but do you think he could kill them permanently? he is the most powerful necromancer the world had ever known and could probably find a way to separate the soul from it's body."
teslore,3aa0f7,Tx12001,28,Thu Jun 18 13:56:16 2015 UTC,"I think with a sufficiently powerful soul gem, it should be theoretically possible to soul trap a dragon.  We've seen that the Mantella can soul trap extremely powerful Shezarrines, the Amulet of Kings is supposedly a soul gem that contains the souls of numerous Dragonborn emperors, and Azura's Star can soul trap gods like Vivec and Almalexia. So while we've never seen an actual dragon being soul trapped, I bet an extremely powerful necromancer/conjurer with a powerful soul gem could pull it off.  If you were able to successfully trap a dragon's soul upon its ""death"", I think that would permanently kill the dragon. Or more likely it would send the dragon's soul to the Soul Cairn (IIRC there are multiple dragon skeletons scattered around the Cairn, and the Keepers all wear armor made of dragon-bone, so maybe those are all the results of people who had previously soul trapped dragons in the past?)  At the very least, it would prevent that dragon from ever being risen again."

If it were possible to trap their souls or to otherwise permanently kill them without being another dragon or a Dragonborn, it would certainly have become a huge deal.

Dragons are arrogant enough to use it as a threat, you know, ""I'll be back someday and take revenge on your children's children, so do as your told to save them!"". That kind of thing.   Or there is the fact that the war with the dragons was going on already for some time before Alduin was sent through time. It is possible the dragons were already being resurrected after death.

The dragon war occurred in the same era as Pelinal, the arrival of men from Atmora(where dragon's already ruled), the creation of the Great Houses, and after the building of the White-Gold Tower. If all that history can be kept, no reason they couldn't have kept the information about dragons?

Also she posits that:   ""Dragons aren't just coming back, they're coming back to life""   Even having been explicitly told this she doesn't believe it until she see it for herself.

Well that only serves to prove my point that people did remember that only a dragonborn or a dragon can permanently kill them. The blades remembered it, the Greybeards know it. Even the guards that comment on you being a dragonborn during the quest Dragon Rising mention the fact that Dragonborn steals the soul of dragons. I never claimed that everyone in the whole world knew it, only not entirely forgotten; it certainly wasn't forgotten by the individuals to whom it was relevant, i.e. blades(who were dragonhunters) and the Greybeards(who teach dragonborn) as well as anyone else who simply had an interest in ancient legends or history."

The point is a secretive organisation that is anti war and run by a dragon and one singe blade who was not well respected knew about this. Hence I think it's very unlikely that the information was common enough for anyone to care about it when dragons were being hunted as, at that time, dragons seemed to be dying just fine without any need for any additional mystic input."

He didn't sell his Soul to the Masters: he sold his service, but after centuries within Oblivion, his physical form could no longer bear to live outside of it.

He is not held there by anything more than the fact that his body, made dependent upon the Cairn through centuries of service, would not survive for long outside of it. He does not grant the Last Dragonborn any unique or magical ability that provides him the ability to escape to Nirn, he simply gives him the right to call his name and summon him briefly in battle: he would not have reason or opportunity otherwise."

There are only the Eight: even the Aspect-Gods shed from them are not themselves Aedra, but only Aspects of Aedra.

And of course, even so, we have no way of knowing that Dragons helped shape Nirn to begin with.

As far as i seem to have grasped dragons, they are all merely shards of Akatosh? So, in a way they might be considered gods, well, mere fragments considering that there are quite alot of them, and used to be more.  And why do you say that daedras can be killed in their own realm? I assume your talking about daedric princes, as they are the only ones with their own realms. And where did you get info that they can be killed in their own realm? I find that highly unlikely, and i have never read something that implies this is even remotly possible, considering that the realm is their bodies  And the dragon cult is long gone, or should i say dead.

teslore,3acta1,Kestrellius,3,Fri Jun 19 03:01:28 2015 UTC,"Apples and oranges. The average dragon is more powerful than the average daedroth, because ordinary daedra are pretty much just like mortals or animals that can't permanently die. Daedric Princes are a whole different issue. They're way more powerful than the average dragon, and seem to be more powerful than Alduin as he appeared in Skyrim.  However, Skyrim!Alduin was different from WorldEater!Alduin, and presumably much much weaker. Alduin was originally responsible for Mehrunes Dagon being Mehrunes Dagon in the first place, in fact.

I would rank them: Average Daedras (weakest) > Your Average Dragon > Daedric princes and possibly alduins officers (Not sure of their powers) > And Alduin on the top  We can speculate how much we want on why Alduin was so weak in Skyrim, if its because he havent absorbed the dragonborn, or akatosh punished him for trying to break his destiny and the cycle.   Anyway, we know that Alduin is the one who made dagon the prince of destruction, so we know for a fact that he is more powerful than daedric princes, or atleast assume this by that fact, but the reality is completely different.  We have no idea if Alduin can kill Daedric Princes, or defeat them, as the only referal point we have is that he ""slapped"" dagon, but there is yet no concrete evidence.  Also, by saying average daedras, i typically mean low ranked ones. Im pretty sure there are some higher up in the rankings that possibly could take on a dragon, without being a dragon."
teslore,3acta1,Kestrellius,1 point,Fri Jun 19 16:02:31 2015 UTC,"Well, I'd say it depends on your point of view.

Angels would easily qualify as gods, but there's someone more powerful who decided to keep the title to himself.)

Keep in mind they were not agents of the Imperial government, and didn't serve non-Dragonborn Emperors. Their one goal in life was to serve the Dragonborn, whoever he or she may be at the time. The Septims institutionalized them into an espionage network primarily. Reman and his heirs utilized them more as warriors, who trained the Legions in advanced Akaviri warfare, giving them an edge over other armies in Tamriel and helping them conquer most of the continent."

teslore,3aaa9k,Javascap,70,Thu Jun 18 13:55:05 2015 UTC,"You do not 'read' the Oghma Infinium, you fall into it.  The moment you open it and behold its contents, the words and illuminations start to fade away. You will flip frantically through it, searching for chapter titles related to knowledge you desire. Each sentence not only provides knowledge, but hints at the vast fathoms of further lore still yet to be uncovered. A swordsman will see tantalizing accounts of forbidden blade styles, and whispers of the Pankratosword. Rogues will find almost-completed formulae depicting impossibly potent poisons, and powders that can cloud the senses or allow for chameleonic and silent movement. Mages are given lists of lost books, and half-remembered maps that show where Galerion and Mannimarco sat together to record their first forays into the arcane. And of course, in the margins, are the notes about how these are the least of the secrets contained within. Further chapters, the reader knows, contain such vast depths of secret knowledge that even a glimpse would make them a master of their craft such that they would be known across Tamriel.  And then, as you flip the pages, the book is gone. It fades even as you will it to stay for just one more secret, and you hear the smooth, slimy voice of Hermaeus Mora thanking you for whatever service you have done him. And you are his. Any who would read the Oghma Infinium must have a burning desire to improve. After reading it, they will never again be at peace. They now understand exactly how much is hidden from them, and they know where that knowledge is hidden. All that is needed is to seek out old Mora and strike another bargain. Surely he will give them just one more glance, one more peek.   Just one more?"

He knew Septimus would be able to figure it out while Mora gets to have a little fun with him in the process. So Mora put it there and asked Septimus to get it out, Septimus became obsessed and when you get it open Septimus zero sums and Mora decides to choose you as his next champion."

The Princes are enormously powerful yes, but they aren't entirely omnipotent when it comes to how much power they can exert over/in Mundus. There has already been a precedent before of the Princes having their artifacts stolen and being unable to take them back or move them.  Just a short list of cases were the Princes were unable to retrieve things they created themselves:   Nocturnal's quest in Oblivion to retrieve her Eye. Vaermina's quest in Oblivion to retrieve her orb, as well as her quest in Skyrim to retrieve her staff. Clavicus Vile's quest in Skyrim to retrieve the Rueful Axe (granted he was weakened at the time). Mephala's quest in Skyrim to get the Ebony Blade. Meridia's quest in Skyrim to get the Dawnbreaker from her temple."

So, mostly agreeing with you, but not sure 'unable' is exactly right. They were able. They did it."
teslore,3aaa9k,The_Last_Minority,2,Thu Jun 18 19:56:16 2015 UTC,"well, able in the sense that they got mortals to do it for them.

teslore,3aaa9k,MrFyr,1 point,Thu Jun 18 21:03:54 2015 UTC,"Odd thing is he had access to it long after the dwemer were gone, so they certainly didn't put it there."
teslore,3aaa9k,Electric999999,3,Thu Jun 18 21:12:09 2015 UTC,"This is all conjecture of course, especially with Mora being one of the less known Princes, but it could have been put there at some point by someone other than a Dwemer? It has been over 200 years since Oblivion when it was last seen and then disappeared. At the end of the quest Mora even states that the book was sealed away and that he wanted that undone. Maybe he was lying, but if he wasn't, the only explanation would have to be that it was sealed away between the events of Oblivion and Skyrim or is some kind of time manipulation. It could be that it was sealed away before the events of Oblivion without altering the hero's use of it in said events. Mora is seemingly capable, at least from the perspective of people in Mundus, to be able to work around time. Some of Neloth's dialogue:   ""Where the Black Books actually came from... no one really knows. Some appear to have been written in the past, others might be from the future. Apparently time is more malleable if you're a Daedric Prince of fate and destiny.""   So maybe the book being locked away could have been done at any time in the past, without him being able to move it, yet still able to give it to us in Oblivion?? Mora's mystery, and apparent complexity, is why he's my favorite."

Also, Balgruuf mentions Wulfharth being Dragonborn, AFAIK, aside from the fact that it would have been stupid for him to answer the Greybeard's calling if he hadnt been Dragonborn in the first place. But to the question: It's because they mantled Lorkhan through it. And CHIM. And the combination of their souls. And worship. Heck, Talos is actually such an overkill, he is the only thing able to stop them both. We're not taking him into account here."

teslore,3ac161,FidelTheBosmer,12,Thu Jun 18 21:45:06 2015 UTC,"""Alteration"" is a bit of an arbitrary category invented, like the rest of the Schools, for the convenience of discourse.  Alteration is not itself a well-defined set of capabilities.  The individual effects have just been grouped together as a kind of archetype.  That said, yes, it is very possible to change your species, and presumably race and gender, through magical effects.  There are at least two examples in the games of someone's physical form being changed to that of another species, one in Redguard (I believe) and one in Skyrim.  Doing so permanently would probably involve tinkering with your own soul, though, which is getting into Walking Way territory rather than mere manipulation of magicka."
teslore,3ac161,MareloRyan,7,Thu Jun 18 21:51:28 2015 UTC,"Permanent change is not necessarily outside the realm of ""mere magicka"". A tree is still ash after Fireball fades. Some Alteration magic might wear off, but other examples don't, such as Transmute spells."
teslore,3ac161,LogicDragon,7,Thu Jun 18 22:34:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's kind of what I was trying to get at with the first paragraph.  It's hard to say one way or the other, because it depends on the spell, rather than the mere fact that it could be regarded as Alteration magic.  Fair point on the analogy to Fireball.  Where I was coming from there was the idea of the soul as determining the body, rather than the other way around.  But I suppose it's perfectly possible for a ""Dunmer"" soul, for example, to be permanently stuck in some non-Dunmer body, just as one's body can be warped and scarred by other forms of magic."
teslore,3ac161,MareloRyan,5,Thu Jun 18 22:39:56 2015 UTC,"Exactly.   For instance, a Dovahkiin is a Dov soul in a mortal body. Soul gems contain souls that obviously used to have different containers.   A soul doesn't have to be in its original shell."
teslore,3ac161,LogicDragon,1 point,Thu Jun 18 22:46:43 2015 UTC,"Dragonborn are a special case, I would say.  Dragons aren't just scaly flying lizards in this setting, but rather, any spirit of Time, regardless of form.

In the ""Interview with Three Writers"", Carlocav claims that there are actually ""very old warriors, survivors of Uriel V's ill-fated invasion"". So I like the idea that the Amulet was rescued directly from Ionith, but it's also believable that he wasn't wearing the Amulet at all. In Uriel's case, the man himself is the ""Conquering Diamond""."
teslore,3a9mj5,Cheydin,3,Thu Jun 18 20:40:23 2015 UTC,"If it's not stated otherwise anywhere, we could guess that it returned to Sancre Tor. It seems to like doing that, considering that's where Varen Aquilarius and Tiber Septim both found it during the Interregnum. Considering also that Sancre Tor is where the Amulet reappeared in the world (in the brow of the baby Reman), it could be said that the Amulet was ""re-conceived"" or reborn at Sancre Tor, and is thus bound to it in a manner not fully understood."
teslore,3a9mj5,Alveryn,3,Thu Jun 18 09:24:54 2015 UTC,"Uriel V and his brave, but battle weary bodyguard were the last who fell at Ionith after eight hours of fighting. The Conquering Diamond himself was eaten by Vershurin Septimian, the young Snake-Captain of the Immortals who took this name in triumph after he had destroyed the imperial colony of Septimia earlier this day. Vershurin wore the Amulet when he travelled westwards over a dragon'd sea with a group of loyal knights, veterans from Ionith and the great Dragon Hunts, only to arrive at Pale Pass in the late years of the First Era. Maybe he was on some obscure quest to find the Hero of Prophecy to become him or help him to defeat the Black Dragon Tyrant they had finally driven out of Akavir. In any case, Vershurin handed the Amulet to Reman - delibaretely, not in surrender, even if a fight was necessary - but the Cyrodiil was not yet the prophesied savior. After the end of Reman's line and Vershurin's own Potentate rule over Tamriel, the Amulet disappeared along with him for the time of Interregnum. Some say that he joined Hjalti as Chevalier Renald in the northern west, others claim that it was at Sancre Tor or even later in Nibennium where they met as Zurin and General Talos. But it was again this immortal Snake-Captain who granted Talos the Amulet and thus allowed Uriel V, most worthy heir of the Conqueror, to wear it on his expedition to Akavir. Perhaps it was the oversoul of Emperors which forced the Snake-Captain to return the Amulet to its nexus, but I doubt it, for I remember the full and ceremonial name the Emperor took in triumph: Tiberius Septimian, Imperator-ut-Cyrod."

Hell, the Last Year of the First Era would imply the ALMSIVI aren't really that powerful(of course it is historical fiction), but read over that if you get a chance. Sotha Sil seemed to gain a stronger perception of the world and possibly its metaphysics, we kinda have to count out Vivec because of CHIM, and Almalexia never seemed that powerful. She could bestow blessings but never really made a grand show of power. Still, they had at least enough power to banish a Daedric Prince and to garner enough respect to forge a Nirnwide bargain with 8ish Daedric Princes to insure they couldn't be summoned by a novice. As for feats, I would include the construction of the Ghostfence(at the waning of their power it consumed most of their strength) which was basically a giant force field. I would try to compare their power to Dagoth Ur as he had the same power source, but the player's encounter with him was when he was directly feeding off the Heart without stopping(the Tribunal took power from the Heart on yearly pilgrimages) and I don't think is close enough to compare their abilities.

Nerevarine with his countless number of artifacts. Dragonborn as a Vampire Lord and after having absorbed Miraak. The Champion of Cyrodiil as the Divine Crusader, as Sheogorath it might take both Sotha Sil and Almalexia to defeat him as mentioned by ""MareloRyan"" it took both Almalexia and Sotha sil to take on 1 Daedric Prince."

A good deal of the conflict comes from the fact that, from what we know of the Kalpic cycle, it only affects Mundus and not Oblivion or Aetherius... But at the same time the Daedra are said by some to have been present at Convention, which seems to imply that during resets they would be drawn back to Mundus for that event."

It merely starts a new Dawn Era on Mundus (although all dawns are the dawn and can't be differentiated) before the world is created again.  The Mundic Kalpa is an echo of the grander World Skin cycle. Sep designed Nirn as a miniature model of the World Skin cycle; the wheel within the Wheel. We do not yet know whether its creation has halted or affected the grander cycle in any way.  But those spirits that invested themselves in the Mundus are now trapped, and will never be able to Walkabout when Satakal's hunger begins to consume the current World-skin.

He terrorises Sovngarde and devours the souls of Nordic heroes there. Whether Sovngarde is part of Aetherius or elsewhere is up for debate, but we can say with some certainty that it is not a location in the Mundus.  So, if Alduin's devouring of everything to allow ""the world"" to be born anew is the ushering in of a new Kalpa I would say that planes beyond the Mundus are affected by the coming of a new Kalpa as well.

While it is certainly possible that the Daedra are affected, or rather that the realms outside Mundus are affected, it isn't definitive. The Princes have mentioned what amounts to previous lives before, but it seems like that can be an entirely separate event from the Kalpas or anything similar. The Princes seem capable of ""resetting"" themselves at any time, possibly by will, sometimes against it. Consider the cycle of the curse put upon Jyggalag that turned him into Sheogorath.  Or that Skyrim Sheogorath mentions exploits from Oblivion; did the power of Sheogorath take over the consciousness of the Oblivion hero? Or did he change and possibly start another ""life"" as Sheogorath again?  The Kalpa cycle might very well affect the Daedra, just as easily as it might not; the Daedra (or at least the Princes) are already embodiments of change upon themselves and the world(s) around them."
teslore,3a42df,twilot_spankle,21,Wed Jun 17 01:48:30 2015 UTC,"This bugged me way too much when I found out. We got a pretty close look at the Great Houses and it's obvious leadership is not inherited. It's true that noble families comprise the upper echelons, but that nobility is earned as much as it is inherited. Hell, 2/3 of the leaderships are reached by the player duelling the present leaders to the death. And nobody involved had the surname Hlaalu, Redoran, or Telvanni.  It seems that Great Houses began as ""family houses"", so maybe somewhere down the line leadership was inherited. We don't learn about the fate of the founding families of Hlaalu and Redoran, but we do learn a little something about the Telvanni -- that they were killed out long ago through internal power-grabs. In the present day, we see just how little Telvanni cares for nobility. It's the only in-game Great House whose Council is not comprised of nobles. Not only that, but all of the councillors (barring the ones you invite later on, Divayth Fyr and ""Badass"" Demnevanni) have dropped their family names. It's likely they were never from notable families, they're just really powerful wizards. Telvanni respects power alone, and they don't make it a secret.  In order for that journal to make sense, I think we have to assume that ""Lymdrenn Tenvanni"" meant that Brand-Shei was the last living member of the Great House (rather than the family which is both long-dead and irrelevant to the command structure of the Great House). If there are no others living, Brand-Shei would carry Telvanni's spirit into the future -- but he wouldn't inherit any actual standing.  Lymdrenn was wrong, though. He said Telvanni had fallen and named his son the last one left, yet in Dragonborn we meet Neloth, who says Telvanni has holdings on Vvardenfell too. Lleril Morvayn lists plainly the five Great Houses of 4E201 and Telvanni is still one of them.  TL;DR: Brand-Shei is only the heir to hopes and dreams; Telvanni is alive and well.  I won't hide the fact that this isn't about putting together the jigsaw pieces, it's about jamming this particular jigsaw piece into the complete picture so we're not left with an extra. Beth-bashing is old hat but I feel like this quest's writer was disconnected."

It's hard to punch holes in something so spread out and disjointed. I'm sure many magisters survived simply because the Argonians couldn't levitate up to their inner chambers.

Maybe the author believed what they wrote, possibly they weren't in a particularly rational frame of mind at the time. It's hard to see how it could be true though."

Perhaps Brandyl is the last living person from family Telvanni of House Telvanni.  Again, no actual clue, I never played Morrowind [watched lps and read the books though]. This is just a possibility I'm throwing out."
teslore,3a42df,BanditoWalrus,1 point,Wed Jun 17 03:06:20 2015 UTC,"So, this is an assumption on my part, but I'd say that Bryndon is possibly the last person with the SURNAME Telvanni. The last person ""Telvanni by Blood"" rather than ""Telvanni by virtue of being a badass wizard."" It's really the only way the book makes any sense other than being a developer error, or maybe an elaborate prank staged by another Telvanni.  I think House Telvanni is doing fine for itself. Based on Neloth's dialog, the mainland Telvanni are still doing quite well. I seriously DOUBT (based on the personality of every Telvanni ever) that the House as a whole even cares that their original bloodline is dead.  Although Neloth's presence in Solstheim makes me wonder... he could just be there due to wanting to research there. But, then again, he remotely researches the Briarhearts, so wanting to research things found on Solstheim doesn't necessitate his being there.  In the Morrowind House Telvanni questline, Master Aryon mentions to the player his desire to stack the Telvanni Council with newer blood (Including Baladas Demnevanni and the Neravarine) to cancel out the influence of the more old fashioned members like Gothren and Neloth. Assuming the Telvanni plotline occurred in canon, Gothren is dead, and two more ""New School"" Telvanni are a part of the Council. This would mean Neloth and the other ""Old School"" Telvanni are no longer in charge. Perhaps he has secluded himself in Solstheim, thus, for political reasons.  Or maybe it's just to stop all those damn kids stealing his artifacts."

That's why Balgruuf is so hesitant to join the Imperial forces outright - he knows if he allows Imperial forces in, the Thalmor would surely follow.   After he does allow forces in the city - after the battle - Heimskr is supposed to be jailed. However, it is a known bug that this doesn't always happen. (From the UESP: ""Sometimes, when the Imperials get control of Whiterun during the Civil War, Heimskr won't be sent to jail. ""). So it's possible your game was just affected by this bug."

But the vanilla games are buggy as a compost pile - there's stuff that was clearly intended/written that never got programmed in. Like, the giants were supposed to be recruited to the Stormcloaks, and the mage's guild. But the quests to do so were cut - there's a hint of them (a quest with the name in the files, I think?) in the vanilla files, but no way to activate them without mods.  Which is another reason why trying to determine what is ""canon"" by only ""what is in the games"" is ludicrous. There is so much more that could be in the games that isn't, for technical reasons as much as lore reasons.   It still amuses me greatly that many lore mechanics clearly started as gameplay mechanics. Besides Convention, there's the whole no-half-bloods thing (taking the race of the mother, clearly designed so you don't have to model a bunch of varied half bloods), dragon breaks (ok not totally, but still), and probably some others I've forgotten."

The only part of in-game lore largely unhindered by mechanics and time limits is the books - and if you're looking at text based sources, might as well also look into the vast ocean of clever, well written texts by those unaffiliated with Bethesda.  As I see it, the games are each their own source and there is nothing absolute or holy about them. They offer comprehensive and excellently delivered information, but they should be viewed in terms of their values and limitations just like any other source.  Edit: UC, your analogy is flawed in every way - a huge false dilemma that assumes a point I am not making and meanwhile ignores 90% of what I was trying to say. I'd be happy to hear your argument if you at least attempted to understand mine. Also, a suggestion: don't 'Oh god' me or anyone else.

There is even a quest to assassinate Jarl Elisif for Boethiah in the game, after you become her Champion.  One modder claimed to have restored it, but I've not tested it myself.

You'd think that they would be heavily focused on stomping out Talos worship in those cities, yet they remain absent.

The longer the Imperials and Stormcloaks are in a stalemate, the better for the Thalmor. The last thing they want right now is for the Civil War to swing in favor of either side.  Right now, Balgruuf is doing a phenomenal job stalling things in favor of the Thalmor by ""staying out"" of the war. Both the Imperials and the Stormcloaks are desperate to take Whiterun for themselves, so as long as their attention is distracted towards that end, the Thalmor can more easily operate under the radar.  What would happen if they marched right up there with a detachment of Justiciars and arrested Heimskr? Balgruuf would be outraged, and would likely turn to either Ulfric or Tulius in a heartbeat to do whatever it takes to keep Whiterun safe from the Thalmor. They would be forcing Balgruuf's hand to pick a side in the war, which would give a massive advantage to whoever he sided with, and could ultimately lead to the end of the Civil War.  Balgruuf and Whiterun are already perfectly suiting the Thalmor's needs. As long as this continues, the Thalmor will remain hands-off."

Regardless of whether the Imperials or Stormcloaks win, the Civil War is going to end in 4E201. Of course we don't know what side will end up winning, but ultimately, it doesn't really matter when you think about both outcomes.  If the outcome of the Civil War is even mentioned at all, it will probably be something like this: The stalemate was eventually broken when the Stormcloaks laid siege to Whiterun, both Ulfric and General Tulius end up getting killed at some point or another (the exact details are lost to history), regardless, Elisif remains Jarl of Solitude and will probably either end up as the High Queen or she'll be assassinated by Thalmor.

Balgruuf is also said to worship Talos in secret.  If the Empire wins the battle for Whiterun, Heimskr is eventually relocated to Dragonsreach Dungeon.  I like to think that this is actually for his protection because Balgruuf allowed him to preach all day every day prior to the battle.  The Thalmor can't touch Heimskr if the local authorities are demonstrably enforcing the White-Gold Concordant. This shown because since the Thalmor patrols in Skyrim exist ostensibly because local authorities can't or won't enforce the ban.  EDIT: Corrected the spelling of Balgruuf's name."

Also, the staff could not be destroyed, only sundered, just like Numidian(which was powered by the Mantela, a pseudo-Heart of Lorkhan), and the Staff had it's power drained into a giant soul gem, which was called ""The Gem of Fire""(fire having connections with Lorkhan visa vi Red Mountain)"
teslore,3a2f60,cfmacleod,2,Wed Jun 17 06:42:16 2015 UTC,"the Marukhati Selectives, with Tharn, underwent the Dance of the Selectives to make Akatosh.   Slight correction:  The Selective's stated goal was to remove elven influence from Akatosh, as seen here:   Scholar-priests of the Alessian Order tamper with the Dragon God of Time.  A fanatical sect of the Alessian Order, the Maruhkati Selective, becomes frustrated by ancient Aldmeri traditions still present within the theological system of the Eight Divines. Specifically, they hated any admission that Akatosh, the Supreme Spirit, was indisputably also Auriel, the Elven High God.  Newly invented rituals were utilized to disprove this theory, to no avail. Finally, the secret masters of the Maruhkati Selective channeled the Aurbis itself to mythically remove those aspects of the Dragon God they disapproved of. A staff or tower appeared before them. The secret masters danced on it until it writhed and trembled and spoke its protonymic.   And here:   It is the first of the Exclusionary Mandates that the Supreme Spirit Akatosh is of unitary essence, as is inconclusively proven by the monolinearity of Time. And clearly, the Arc of Time provides us with the mortal theater for the act of Sacred Expungement. Thus it is our purpose upon Mundus to reverse the error of Sanctus Primus and restore Ak-at-Osh to humanadic purity. To say otherwise is vain and empty persiflage.  Therefore let the Staff of Towers be prepared for the ritual that will cleanse the protean substrate of the Aldmeri Taint.   The theory of outright, retroactive creation (as well as the shoving-in of Shezarr) is not established in the actual texts describing the goals of the Selective.  To my knowledge, it was invented to explain the two heads of Akatosh in a stained-glass window in Oblivion, for which there is already an alternate and more apparent explanation.  As for Jagar's ultimate goal, the actual topic of your post, I don't have much insight.  I don't think the Staff of Chaos must have the same capabilities as the Staff of Towers, though.  It doesn't seem to be made of symbols of Towers, for one thing, so I don't think it has an intrinsic link to them."

He may have had a number of things to drove him towards his usurping the Empire, but what he likely wanted was power & a desire to fulfil his own ego & beliefs.  Often times with such a postition, the one with the title wishes to impose & coerce, while avoiding as many consequences as possible. Ironically to do this, Jagar may have put himself in an even greater predicament likely because he wanted short term gains & security. Jagar probably went fairly mad with power, so he made a shot at covering himself up by 'destroying' powerful artifacts such as the staff of chaos.  Overall, there was likely even more to this than just Jagar alone, & probably with bounds of conspiracy. The Empire of Tamriel did have a fair share of problems largely due to the ideologies of the 'rulers.' Any sort of environment this tense surely had impact on Tharn, no matter how he came into the government & politics.

What we know is that the Champion was told by Sheogorath that the mantling, and attempting to stop Jyggalag, had never happened before, that the entire chain of events was completely new:   You'll change that. Break the cycle. You'll stop Jyggalag, and I'll have My Realm to come back to. I've never actually tried that before.    Once I'm gone, things usually get bad quickly. Lots of defections. Lots of carnage. But with you at the helm, things will be different!    But, this is all new! A fresh idea! Something I hadn't thought of, until I did. It's sure to work, even though it might not.   That, we now know, was a lie.  Haskill himself underwent the same process, and the implication is that others have done so as well.  The Champion was also told that they would be powerful enough to stop Jyggalag merely by virtue of having mantled Sheogorath, and that this was the factor that would make the difference this time around:   You'll be my champion. You'll grow powerful. You'll grow to be me. Prince of Madness, a new Sheogorath. Or you'll die trying. I love that about you.    But, for all intents and purposes, you'll be Me. A Me to fight the Him. Since I won't be around. It's simple, really. If you don't think about it.    You're going to stop the Greymarch by becoming Me. Or a version of Me. You'll be powerful. Powerful enough to stop Jyggalag.   So, nowhere in Shivering Isles is it suggested that the mortal who mantles Sheogorath normally loses, precisely because the Champion was lied to about whether the mantling had happened before at all.  In the absence of information suggesting that the Champion's mantling and fight with Jyggalag were different somehow from Haskill's or others', it seems fairly reasonable to assume that the Champion's run wasn't different at all.  However, there is Jyggalag's speech to address:   Enough! I am beaten. The Greymarch is ended. For millennia this drama has unfolded, and each time, I have conquered this land, only to be transformed back into that gibbering fool, Sheogorath. It was not always so. Once, I ruled this Realm, a world of perfect Order. My dominion expanded across the seas of Oblivion with each passing era. The other Princes, fearful of my power, cursed me with Madness, doomed me to live as Sheogorath, a broken soul reigning in a broken land. Once each era, I was allowed my true form, conquering this world anew. And each time I did, the curse was renewed, damning me to exist as Sheogorath. Now, though, you have ended the cycle. You now hold the mantle of madness, and Jyggalag is free to roam the voids of Oblivion once more. I will take my leave, and you will remain here, mortal. Mortal...? King? God? It seems uncertain. This Realm is yours. Perhaps you will grow to your station. Fare thee well, Sheogorath, Prince of Madness.   Here it would seem that Jyggalag himself is of the opinion that he always conquers the Shivering Isles, and that his failure to do so against a mantler of Sheogorath is the factor that leads to his freedom from the cycle.  But, again, that actually isn't true, because it's predicated on prior statements from Sheogorath that Jyggalag has never had a mantled Sheogorath to fight against in the first place, that Jyggalag always wins because he fights unopposed by anyone of comparable power.  But since we now know that Jyggalag actually does fight a mantler at least twice (probably more), here's the question that sinks his whole speech into unreliability, as well as the idea that the curse persists solely because the mantlers keep losing:  If he really thinks losing that fight sets him free, why wouldn't he allow the mantler to win before now?  Instead of the Prince of Order and Logic doing the straightforwardly logical thing that leads to his freedom, he shows no acknowledgement that he's ever fought a mantler before!  At this point, it seems more likely to me that it's all part of the curse for Jyggalag to forget that it has played out this way before, to think he's free, only to descend once more into Sheogorath's madness (perhaps even forced to do so as a direct result of remembering what has really happened each Greymarch; Sheogorath seems to remember, certainly).  This is exactly the kind of cruelty that the other Princes might be inclined to enact on Jyggalag!  In the end, it may not even matter whether the one who mantles Sheogorath wins the fight or not.  We certainly don't know which outcome is normal; only that the mantling has happened before, that the Champion was lied to, and that, as a result, we have no solid reason to assume that Jyggalag was right about being free, because, otherwise, he would have freed himself before the Champion got involved."

teslore,3a2g6y,MareloRyan,1 point,Thu Jun 18 08:04:44 2015 UTC,"Very vague ones that are easily dismissed!   I'm a mad god. The Mad God, actually. It's a family title. Gets passed down from me to myself every few thousand years.   This is usually taken as implying that the Champion was named as Sheogorath (permanently) by Sheogorath-that-is-Jyggalag, but notice that he says it happens multiple times, whereas, if we take the events of Shivering Isles at face value, it should have only happened once.  However, throw in Haskill's testimony, and it looks like Sheogorath-that-is-Jyggalag passes the title to his mortal mantles, and then takes it back, perhaps along with some memories of their time as mortals (Haskill has trouble remembering his own mantling of Sheogorath, which I'll get to in the next bit), which accounts for Sheogorath in Skyrim acting like his old self and saying that he passes it down to himself multiple times.   You are far too hard on yourself, my dear, sweet, homicidally insane Pelagius. What would the people do without you? Dance? Sing? Smile? Grow old? You are the best Septim that's ever ruled. Well, except for that Martin fellow, but he turned into a dragon god, and that's hardly sporting... You know, I was there for that whole sordid affair. Marvelous time! Butterflies, blood, a Fox, a severed head... Oh, and the cheese! To die for.   This is also usually taken as a reference to the Champion and events they can take part in during Oblivion, but it can be accounted for by the mere fact that Sheogorath would be perfectly able to be present for those events regardless of whether he was the Champion.  But notice, too, Haskill's memory loss that I mentioned earlier; if Sheogorath takes some of their memories when he kicks them out of the throne, who's to say he didn't take some of the Champion's memories, too?"

I mean, pretty much every single ""Hero"" in TES is a walking whirlwind of change and destruction, but that doesn't make them all Mehrunes Dagon worshipers.  Many people who are ""mad"" may turn to Sheogorath, but that is not the case for everyone. If you are ""insane"" you are certainly more likely to be susceptible to Sheogorath's influence, and thus you are more likely to seek his aid, but that doesn't mean he has automatic claim over your soul or that you need to worship him.  I also do not think that Sheogorath is necessarily the cause of all madness. I mean, take Dagoth Ur and Almalexia; both of them ended up pretty much batshit insane, but that was mostly due to their use of Lorkhan's Heart."

Sermon 2, where Vehk's mother is blinded by interaction with Mephala, is called ""The Enantiomorph"" in the Scripture of Numbers (Sermon 29), as /u/RottenDeadite noted. Interesting implications, does this make her the blind witness of Egg-Vehk's enantiomorph with Mephala?"

There's another metaphor, the ""deaf witness"", which reminds me more of sound and hearing.  So the numbers as deaf witness (""The presence of deaf witness, this is what the numbers are. They hang onto the Aurbis as the last nostalgia of their godhood."") work the same way as the dying/blinded enantiomorph observer? The shield-thane sees the enantiomorphic interaction and is blinded instead of realizing godhood/birth-death, the numbers are deaf because they're a mere nostalgic presence, messages which you would carve in stone much like Hrol's shield-thane did with some words before he died, but inable to realize the union and make something really new?"

You'll have seen in the Shivering Isles how the landscape is divided into two halves - Mania, and Dementia. Both are rather stereotypical ideas of insanity, but Mania is far more so; the whole 'random' thing. The landscape is meant to be split evenly in half, but New Sheoth is actually much closer to the Mania half of the isles, then the Dementia half; probably because that's the half that Sheogorath's whims currently support. Considering what we've read about some of Sheogorath's darker acts in the various texts, I wouldn't be at all surprised if this were the case.  As for the whole Princes being insane thing; from a mortal perspective, they all are; because they embody individual concepts, which from a mortal perspective seems like a psychologically breaking obsession. Sheogorath being a caricature of 'madness' makes a great deal of sense, especially considering that that's only one of his titles. He's the patron god of the Arts as well, for example.  As for the metaphor; it runs deeper then you might have realised. The Shivering Isles is basically an asylum, and I mean this in the nicest way possible. Everyone there is completely mad (even if it is in the crude 'random' sense of the word), yet society functions. More then that, it thrives. Sheogorath's realm gives the mad a place to call home; hidden away from Nirn entirely, under their caretaker, Haskill.

They are not released until they have enough experience to overcome great obstacles by strength or cunning or guile. Then the third eggshell is proving yourself to the wider world. It's a tribal initiation process that reinforces Hist worship and loyalty to, above all, the Hist that hatched you.

Also note that PGE3 places Topal's voyage itself in the Merethic:   It was about this time that many Aldmer left Summerset to settle the mainland of Tamriel. There was probably no single reason for this second exodus of the Aldmer, but some evidence, such as the famed Ramoran Tapestries — the very ones that show some of the creatures mentioned above — show how untouched and beautiful the mainland was considered to be by the Aldmer. Expeditions, such as those taken by Topal the Pilot and others, had painted an image in their minds of a great land where even workers at the lowest end of the Summerset hierarchy could live as kings. The Prophet Veloth was among those who led a group of discontented Aldmer away from Summerset to a new promised land.    In what historians called the Merethic (or Mythic) Era, the years before formal historical reckoning, the Aldmer came to Tamriel from a legendary mysterious land called Old Ehlnofey or Aldmeris. They settled in Summerset Isle, and then began to spread out eastward.  ...  The Aldmer changed over time culturally according to their new environments, being at first temperamentally and then physically very distinct ""races"" separate from one another. The ones who stayed in Summerset became known as the Altmer; in Valenwood, Bosmer; in Morrowind, Chimer and Dwemer; in Cyrodiil, Ayleid; and in High Rock, a mix between Nedic and Aldmer birthed the Bretons. The Orsimer or Orcs were also created at this time; Aldmer warped by the destruction of their leader Trinimac, who it is said became the Daedra Prince Malacath."

For example, from Before the Ages of Man:   During the early Merethic Era, the aboriginal beastpeoples of Tamriel -- the ancestors of the Khajiit, Argonian, Orcish, and other beastfolk -- lived in preliterate communities throughout Tamriel.  In the Middle Merethic Era, the Aldmeri (mortals of Elven origin) refugees left their doomed and now-lost continent of Aldmeris (also known as 'Old Ehlnofey') and settled in southwestern Tamriel.    So Trinimac->Malacath happened before the settling of Summerset.

Hircine is the most important deity in their pantheons, though these vary from tribe to tribe. From a loading screen in ESO: Reachmen are considered vile heathens by the civilized peoples of Tamriel: they renounce the Eight and mock all of the Aedra, singing praises to the Daedra instead. Worship varies from clan to clan, but the most popular Daedric Prince is Hircine, the source of their dark nature magic.  The only other Princes that are named specifically for their rituals are Molag Bal, Malacath, Mehrunes Dagon and Namira. Not saying they definitely don't worship Azura, but that's not based on anything from any game. I'm guessing you got that from Shoddycast or ESWiki. My best advice is just don't trust those sources. They make a lot of random shit up. They're not trustworthy.  If you wanna know about direct help the Princes give the Reachmen, Hircine helped the Hagravens with their transformation into beast-women, and it's his magic that sustains the Briar-heart warriors as well, since those magical briars are plants from his Oblivion Realm, the Hunting Grounds.   Also note that I keep calling them Reachmen. That's because this is the accurate racial name for these people. The Forsworn are a group of guerrilla fighters in the 4th Era.

The forswarn do seem to have some connection with Dibella though, they defile shrines and statues of Dibella and they were attempting to do some sort of ritual involving the new Sybil of Dibella.

Dibella is a goddess of sex and base impulses. Blood makes loins swell and allows us to indulge in carnal passions. What better sacrifice for the god of sex than an offering of life-blood.  It is also worth noting that there is a well looked after shrine to Arkay in Druadach Redoubt, home-in-exile to Madanach, the King In Rags, and headquarters of the Forsworn Rebellion. (image link) That's not gonna be there unless they revere him or they, at least, want to placate him. Arkay being a god of life and death, someone they cheat every time they produce a Briarheart."

They probably aren't too fond of Arkay, either, what with the whole Briarheart thing."

But to be honest, I was one of those people who hopped on the Skyrim bandwagon a few years ago, and I thought that those two sources were the most in-depth, since I had to prior history to TES lore. Where would you suggest I go?"
