BetweenTheBuriedAndMe,3e5z33,FugginIpad,4,Wed Jul 22 07:53:09 2015 UTC,Great review. I'm also not blown away by Rapid Calm :) I wonder which songs they will play live from the new album.
BetweenTheBuriedAndMe,3e5z33,Sizzlesazzle,3,Wed Jul 22 11:52:55 2015 UTC,"I really enjoy Rapid Calm. The way it builds from the distant vocals and instrumentals all the way to the ""one last search"" part is fantastic. That ending is easily my favourite part of the album.   But I can also see why some people wouldn't like the song as much. It's not nearly as structured as the rest of the songs on the album."
BetweenTheBuriedAndMe,3e45a9,fckth3systm,17,Tue Jul 21 20:32:42 2015 UTC,"Honestly, BTBAM is the one band that I really don't pay attention to the words. It's just a really sonically pleasing experience to listen to. I love them and they're my favorite band, but, like you, aside from clean passages and some phrases, I don't pay much mind to the specific lyrics. More the rhythm and tone. I would say we have a very similar listening experience with BTBAM."

I joined this sub expecting to get into discussions behind the theory and sonic themes of their music, and while there is that I just had no idea people dissected the lyrics so much.  Can't say I should have been surprised in retrospect."

BetweenTheBuriedAndMe,3e45a9,rndzvs,10,Tue Jul 21 21:19:41 2015 UTC,"I'm with you. People here put way too much of their attention into lyrics. But I supposse it's difficult to do otherwise: communicating instrumental sections or interesting harmonies is more complicated through text.  I declare myself to be a total BTBAM fan: I know all the instruments from memory from all their records, and fuck, I've been listening to them non stop for years, but I confess that I don't know shit about the lyrics. Only the most notorious parts, like the choruses, songs highlights, and clean parts. Also, I find the whole concept behind Parallax very interesting, yet I don't know much about it. Maybe I should go read those ""guides"" that get posted here from time to time."
BetweenTheBuriedAndMe,3e45a9,rndzvs,6,Tue Jul 21 22:25:19 2015 UTC,"Exactly this!  One of my coworkers is a huge BTBAM fan and after Memory Palace was first released we shared our impressions.  She immediately began talking about the lyrics and I immediately began dissecting the tone and specific passages.  When she asked what I thought it was about I had to admit that I didn't remember a single word which she couldn't believe me because I was easily able to recall specific key changes and harmony intervals.  I've always known it, but that's when it really drove home that everyone listens to their music differently, even when they have extremely similar tastes."

I mean, if I feel like reading some interesting stuff, I better go read some poetry or a novel, but music is for… well, music! And BTBAM does fucking sublime music.  But on the musical level, as you noted, I get very, very excited in certain passages, like 2:30 of Turn on the Darkness, which is simply fenomenal…"

If you watch the older in studio videos for the past albums, Blake always seems to work from hand written notes that resemble a tempo / time sig track and have no actual notation on them.  There are a few Pro level Guitar Pro tabs out there that have the drums notated, but I can't attest to their accuracy."

BetweenTheBuriedAndMe,3e0s5g,bethesdurr,2,Tue Jul 21 16:13:53 2015 UTC,I assume that when they write as individuals this is what they do too.

I can't be entirely sure but I think this song may be depicting the one photograph of the four hooded, torch-bearing men in the desert. The song literally mentions Black Ashes, Flames, and 'The Torchbearer'. Also it seems like the cloaked men have some sort of magical or otherworldly abilities.

BetweenTheBuriedAndMe,3dbmqw,Dunsel_,2,Wed Jul 15 17:47:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah, which means ever since Colors he's wanted the band to get heavier. Meaning he probably also wishes Colors was heavier.   And I think TGM and Parallax 2 are less heavy than Colors. Hypersleep at least has those tasty Augment riffs. P2 has Telos, which is pretty fucking heavy at times, but that's the only song on those two albums I'd classify as truly heavy."
BetweenTheBuriedAndMe,3dbmqw,ImAJerk420,3,Wed Jul 15 17:56:45 2015 UTC,He said heavy again. TGM is equally as heavy as Colors IMO
BetweenTheBuriedAndMe,3dbmqw,Dunsel_,2,Wed Jul 15 18:05:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah, heavy again. Since 2007. Meaning he wants them to sound like they did before Colors. They've never gotten to how heavy they used to sound before that album, though there have been songs here and there. I'd say P1 was a step in the right direction, but we all know how they feel about that album now.  And I disagree about TGM. Outside of some parts of DIM, and a part here or there in Swim, there's nothing remarkably heavy about TGM. Colors has Decade, Prequel, White Walls, kind of Gluttony."
BetweenTheBuriedAndMe,3dbmqw,ImAJerk420,3,Wed Jul 15 18:44:18 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, I've been with them since Silent Circus and to me personally they've been plenty heavy since, but I just don't look for how heavy a band is, as long as it's good music. I actually like Coma Ecliptic the best since Colors. I really disliked P1, but hey different strokes."

BetweenTheBuriedAndMe,3dbmqw,Dmoney7117,2,Wed Jul 15 22:47:46 2015 UTC,I don't mind this at all. In the grand catalogue of BTBAM we have a vast majority of screaming vocals and a vast majority of heaviness.  Do I hope the next album is heavier? With more screaming vocals? Absolutely. But I can't help but feel a little selfish when BTBAM has given us hours of the kind of material we wanted on Coma Ecliptic already. When you finally understand what to expect from Coma Ecliptic after a few listen-throughs it starts to stand on its own. I'm beginning to find enjoyment in the singing/more melodic songs. They are starting to take on their own character.

BetweenTheBuriedAndMe,3daad9,RTB668,9,Tue Jul 14 18:48:42 2015 UTC,"This sums up one of my favorite aspects, not just of this album, but their music as a whole:   Yeah, definitely. Obviously, our music is not for everybody. They’re really long, complicated songs. There’s a lot going on. We know that in one listen the song isn’t going to be stuck in your head. [Laughs]. We try to write music that takes a little effort to listen to and understand; something that you can listen to a year from now and pick up something new out of it. So many albums are great, but you listen to them a few times and then you’re like, “That’s it.” I think we try to write music that is more timeless. You can listen to a lot of times over a large span of time and get something new out of it every time.   I've listened to Colors, TGM, and the Parallax albums dozens upon dozens of times, but I still discover (and rediscover) things about them. It's music that stays not just entertaining like pop songs or simple rock songs can do, but interesting. It gives you a reason to keep coming back beyond just the simple enjoyment that comes from familiarity."
BetweenTheBuriedAndMe,3daad9,neogohan,3,Tue Jul 14 20:52:03 2015 UTC,"Yes. That is exactly it. Paul's statement and your thoughtful comment are the perfect encapsulation of what draws me to BTBAM. There's just so much information woven into it all with each part, instrument and voice creating such a deep tapestry of sound. Some aspects jump out right away and others may reveal themselves more gradually or even force you to actively dig them out. I know that sounded pretentious and definitely don't mean it to. That's just how their music overall is for me and I suspect for a lot of other Between the Buried and Me fans."

Our venue also had a really sweet balcony.  Being first in to run up and grab a seat on the front would have been sweet.. i probably would have done that had i known about it before i got in there.

I think that the first verses talk specifically about about the idea of humans eating animals who are also living entities.        In the verse that begins ""The fifth resonating host"" (with an animal as the host), the patient finds himself experiencing reality from within the body of some unnamed grazing animal who is being hunted by humans, possibly early hunter / gatherers. The patient is self aware as both human and the animal host as the lines ""sweaty palmed inside"" (aware of himself as a human) combined with ""constant alert"" and ""Blinking around the bubble of the paranoid"" (like grazing animals periodically looking up and around) seem to suggest.  The patient views and mourns the depth, degree and consequence of worldwide animal slaughter.  ""Anchored mind wind... across the fog. We disgrace the pupil’s sight"" may mean that the purpose of multiple lives is to learn and grow with each of them but in consuming other animal life (as stewards / higher animals) we are perpetuating a barbarism that divides us from other animal life.  I imagine it as a cross between veganism and the old quasi sci-fi movie Altered States if you've seen that.  Anyway, that's my take on it. Who knows..."

I've been in love with BTBAM for years, I first started listening when Alaska was released. Personally I love the direction that they've taken with each new album, I feel like they've grown without completely losing touch with their roots and they don't get stuck in some ""mold"" or standard that makes their albums sound the same. Coma Ecliptic is my favorite BTBAM album to date, it is absolutely astonishing (IMO).  Welcome to the community my friend! We're glad to have you!"

I also think I can agree with you musically, I used to love ABR in high school, found BTBAM a bit before I graduated around the release of TGM and have adored them since. Over the years I've severely cut back on metal, it's a lot of Radiohead, Primus, and Beck nowadays, but I still try to listen to everything I can and find new rock/folk. BTBAM is one of three metal acts that I still listen to consistently.  As for the album. I agree this needs to be viewed on it's own. Every piece of work they've put out is vastly different. CE is nowhere near the top of my list, if I had to order them, but for what CE is trying to do... I think it accomplished that. It is worth noting that I love Pulse and Modern Noise to death, so the obvious similarities aren't bad to me, but they feel somewhat out of place."

BetweenTheBuriedAndMe,3d2qsp,crocoperson,4,Mon Jul 13 01:47:53 2015 UTC,"It's certainly a very different album (from their previous stuff) going in a different, but still distinctly BTBAM-y, direction. Personally, I love it because I'm a big prog metal fan where clean vocals are emphasized and utilized to add to the overall theme of/build up a song. This album reminds me a lot of Haken, for example, but they're not everyone's cup of tea.  As with all their stuff, give it a few good solid listen throughs. If you're not a fan this time around, nbd it makes sense! Their ""heavier"" stuff is definitely amazing. But I found myself liking the new album more and more with each consecutive listen, and certain songs really stood out. And I'm still not sold on a few parts to be completely honest. It's complex (but when are they not!) so maybe you gotta find the parts you enjoy."

I'm refreshed they're continually pushing towards an artistic goal that they have as a group. It's sounding like they're not in sync with what you're needing musically at this very moment.   Future Sequence resonated with me more recently than it did at time of release. Seeing them live on the Great Misdirect tour gave my interest a sharp, focused boost, followed by a crashing...well, crash. Perhaps you've just over done it for now?  As others have said, I'm glad that they're not just making the same record over and over, regardless of whether it immediately resonates with me.

I loved Colors, it was my intro to the band, and I loved the rest of their discog before that too. TGM came out and I really liked it, but I grew tired of it quickly, and it just wasn't on the same level as their other stuff. Parallax I was alright, but it was only three songs, so I didn't listen much. Parallax II was a whole other story, I think I've listened to it about 10 times but I can't remember anything but Astral Body, Telos, and unfortunately Bloom from it - it feels way too long and has way too many recycled musical ideas on it. I was just totally burnt out on their approach. It felt like THEY felt that the majority of theirs songs HAD to hit at least 8 or 10 minutes, and I think the writing suffered for it.  But Coma Ecliptic has changed that for me. I love that they've switched their focus to writing with the songs in mind, and that many of them are shorter, more focused, more varied musically, and more emotional. It's what I've been wanting from this band for years now, another big shake up to their sound, but I gave up hoping that it'd happen.   Honestly, OP, you might be feeling something similar - plain fatigue of their style. Leave the band alone for a while, maybe even a long while, and maybe one day you'll find yourself itching to hear their music again. Maybe a new album release will trigger that, or it'll just be a random feeling, but it'll come. And then you'll love them again."

It's almost like they combined their influences to make a unique album that still sounds like them, just like all their other albums and every other (prog) band in existence. And the vocals are literally never off key, with how polished this album is that's kind of a ridiculous claim. To each his own, but to me this is their best album yet and I've been a fan boy since Alaska"
BetweenTheBuriedAndMe,3czra5,ian92293,0,Sun Jul 12 18:36:23 2015 UTC,I'd prefer if BTBAM just sounded like BTBAM. The 70s and early 80s progressive scene ended for a reason. There is nothing left to do. It's saturated and we need something different.
BetweenTheBuriedAndMe,3czra5,ian92293,4,Sun Jul 12 20:00:42 2015 UTC,"Luckily they're not only influenced by 70s and 80s prog bands, and maybe I'm clueless but as far as mixing those influences with extreme metal I'd say it's relatively untreaded territory. Plus it's been 30-40 years since a lot of those bands were at their peak, seems like more than enough time to put a fresh perspective on it, and to me it DEFINITELY does"

The truth for me is that I really never enjoyed any BTBAM album the first few times I listened to it because their music is so complex it takes several listens just to begin to understand what the hell you just listened to.  Therefore, I think that Coma Ecliptic needs to be out for at least a few months before people can really start to criticize it."

My biggest issues lie with the absence of any really catchy melodies and the guitar tones. I guess I like my super heavy / super pretty BTBAM of the past and this new, milder configuration is just not doing it for me.   I'm hoping they return to form on the next album but this is by far their weakest showing IMO."

Arguably the greatest things about BTBAM is their instrumental breakoffs and it felt like there were hardly any on CE.  No Selkies/Ants of the Sky/Swim to the Moon/White Walls/Mordecai climactic moments that just blow you the fuck away.  But idk maybe it will grow on me, their albums always do."

Almost any single riff and singing part of this song is better than every song on Coma Ecliptic."
BetweenTheBuriedAndMe,3czra5,fckth3systm,3,Sun Jul 12 21:58:46 2015 UTC,"So I've been thinking about this ""issue"", if you will, since I've listened to the album. Don't get me wrong, I do agree with you. I just want to know why it sounds like Thomas Giles and co. rather than Between the Buried and Me.  They're growing as musicians. This is an obvious fact. Tommy stated that he wrote Modern Noise while on tour with Btbam. ""It helps keep me focused"" or something like that, he said. So,  combining these two statements, it's only logical that the new Btbam that Thomas Giles is in will have him doing music that has influences sounding like MN.  TL;DR Musicians grow, their style grows with them.  However, to play devil's advocate to my own argument, the music itself (not just vocals and keys) also sounds like MN. This, I cannot explain... Maybe Tommy wrote that entire song for the album? Which goes against everything Btbam has said about themselves; being that  I have only known them to write their own parts, with help/ideas from the other members.  Tl;dr I could be completely wrong."
BetweenTheBuriedAndMe,3czra5,vandamninator,2,Sun Jul 12 14:55:57 2015 UTC,There are songs that Dan and Paul have completely composed on their own.  Dan says in a podcast that he showed up with Goodbye to Everything and Astral Body expecting them to be changed but they kept them as written.
BetweenTheBuriedAndMe,3czra5,Stupidog,6,Wed Jul 15 02:53:06 2015 UTC,"I miss the classic btbam super heavy,  but really intelligent guitar work.   This album feels like everybody is there to support the vocals. Whereas in their previous albums I felt the instruments were the focus.   I've read waggoner touting  discipline while playing, how there's no need to be so riffy or shreddy all the time.  Well that should go for the direction of an album too. Don't go so far prog and soft just because you can. The disciplined thing to do would be for them to realize what people love about their music and try to incorporate it.   Don't get me wrong, I like the album. But it doesn't have a lasting impact . but I can go listen to colors or tgm right now and still be blown away and get goosebumps.   I feel like they were to busy trying to compose this album that they didn't just let the songs become a sum of their parts. I feel like they forced a vision, all in support of Tommy.   But I still like it. I guess I'm conflicted as well."

BetweenTheBuriedAndMe,3czra5,ImAJerk420,3,Tue Jul 14 15:49:28 2015 UTC,"It's certainly a tough pill to swallow, but I've made my peace with it: they ascended the long-vacant prog-metal throne. There are parts on Coma Ecliptic that sound like their contemporaries, like the Safety Fire and other mediocrity (I've only listened to Haken's The Mountain and utterly despised it). There are too many examples on Coma where Paul's leads have that same nauseous Petrucci legato; I won't even go into the sweeping. To me, Blake was one of the most original prog-metal drummers, but he sounds an awful (and I mean an awful) lot like Portnoy on some parts with those lame cymbal subdivisions on some riff repeats (e.g. 3:45 in ""Famine Wolf,"" 5:36 in ""Memory Palace,"" and I'm pretty sure it's elsewhere on the album). Sure, I'm nitpicking, but it's ""progressive"" music, which certainly invites analysis.  It's bad enough that a lot of this record has a lot of Dream Theater timbres, but they did that Prog Nation tour years back (where I first heard them, walking in on ""Viridian"" + ""White Walls"") and they got the glimpse of their future. Look at their tour packages: excluding that Deafheaven + Intronaut tour, it's mostly bands that sound like BTBAM, or are listening to and influenced by BTBAM. It's all marketing, unfortunately: Come to the PROG show! It was very subtle in Parallax I, which I loved, but I can't help but feel as if the major-label signing impacted their direction. I still really enjoyed most of Parallax II—the vocals entering ""Astral Body"" is easily my favorite  BTBAM moment—but I could tell that this was their path. It's safe, it's secure. They're family men now, which is awesome! These guys come from the hardcore-punk background and they've struggled plenty. Ultimately, I applaud them for how far they come. I prefer that this ship—my fandom—sailed so swiftly with my distaste for Coma rather than them making more albums in which I'm left ambiguous solely because I don't want to betray my faith in them.  In the end, I'm just a dude behind a keyboard and these are just five dudes making music. And if this album gets them some new fans, ones who are curious about the rest of BTBAM's discography, then I'm all for it.  /rant"
BetweenTheBuriedAndMe,3czra5,Ssnapcase,2,Tue Jul 14 17:03:23 2015 UTC,"They were going for less prog on this album than they're known for. I remember them saying that this is their ""rock opera,"" so I'm not really surprised that it's less BTBAM-esque than old BTBAM. They're covering Bohemian Rhapsody on this tour so they obviously love all the old stuff that they're sounding similar to. I love all of their stuff, but I try to listen to each album as it's own and not compare it to their previous releases. As far as an album goes I dig it, but you're right, if you were looking for prog metal BTBAM then it is a tad disappointing."

When I meet with BTBAM on this tour i'm gonna be sure to let them know the unprofessionalism of this company they work through, and how many others seemingly agree.  The only place even worse than this company (to me) would be Metal Blade's preorder system. There's been so many times that the release date came and went and i got no word from them on what was going on. WHen I preordered Job For A Cowboy's newest album Sun Eater, the vinyl had apparently been delayed. I was never told this, so of course i contacted them flipping out a bit after a month went by and i had no vinyl in the mail yet. Then there was the Live At The Fidelitorium bluray i ordered through them... That took a while too, as it was ""out of stock"" even though i preordered it only a few days after it was posted.. I'm a bit of a BTBAM nut.. I have one of the most complete media collections of them to date lol. I get mad when things prevent me from expanding it!"

BetweenTheBuriedAndMe,3cvhjk,Borktista,3,Sat Jul 11 03:53:17 2015 UTC,I actually think Life in Velvet swerves you. It makes you believe he chose to live but radically changes and he chose death. Velvet could be the casket lining as others have suggested
BetweenTheBuriedAndMe,3cvhjk,lukneuns,2,Sat Jul 11 05:55:20 2015 UTC,In a Q&A yesterday(?) someone asked about the velvet/gold reference and Tommy confirmed they are metaphors for death/life.

BetweenTheBuriedAndMe,3cvhjk,Borktista,2,Sat Jul 11 08:50:42 2015 UTC,The lyrics.
BetweenTheBuriedAndMe,3cvhjk,ByrGenarHofoen,2,Sat Jul 11 09:45:31 2015 UTC,"To elaborate; The first half of the song is all about him feeling fresh air and the smell of the living. Eluding to him awakening from his coma, but then devolves into the second half which picks up and is heavier. The lyrics state his knees crash into the velvet rope, now most times there's a velvet rope, it's because you're in line to enter some place. In this case, I imagine it's his form of afterlife. It states dark worlds forming, so maybe that means he's enter hell. I don't know fully yet, but the two halves of the song vary drastically so I consider it a swerve upon first listen."

BetweenTheBuriedAndMe,3cvhjk,ragefan999,3,Sat Jul 11 15:29:43 2015 UTC,"I'll post my theory since nobody has put in any opinion on the song yet. I theorize that much like Parallax 2, Coma Ecliptic starts off at the end of the story, and that Node takes place after Life in Velvet. As of right now I think it's talking about the protagonist after he has chosen death (velvet). I think the lines ""the dance has lost its step"" and ""the teeth will be shown no more"" are referring to his loved ones. The dance being their everyday life, it has lost its step because they've just lost someone they cared for deeply, and their teeth aren't being shown because they are grieving and obviously not smiling.   I think also the lines ""the world has lost, our minds roam free"" refers to the fact that the world has lost the protagonist, and that the minds of all of his past lives are now no longer confined to his body or the coma.   As for the rest of the lyrics I'm not really certain, but maybe ""turn the knob to reveal the light, stare across the empty night"" could maybe mean his loved ones pulled the plug on him while he was in a coma? That ones a stretch but it's the best I can think of."

BetweenTheBuriedAndMe,3ct3gq,Icarus-V,4,Fri Jul 10 15:57:02 2015 UTC,"take one headphone out and you will see that it is the 8th note snare hits in LIV that make it sound syncopated. They will not mesh perfectly, but that's not the point. The point is to show that the album is actually open-ended.  LIV (life in velvet) is actually death, but death is a new life in a velvet room (box).  Caskets are lined with velvet (not glass).   Anyways the point is this.  The musical hooks placed in The Coma Machine point you to the ending of the record where everyone thinks it's the end, but it actually points to this: NOW REWIND, which leads into the steady polyrhythmic meter (listen to the mini china beats at 6:50 to distinguish the flip flop/cycle of eternity), which is the musical concept of eternity.  The beat flip flops over and over.  Your new life in a velvet box below between the buried and me is not the end.  In the words of DT: ""Death is not the end, but only a transition.""

BetweenTheBuriedAndMe,3cq594,Budaroo,2,Fri Jul 10 01:53:36 2015 UTC,"""An ancient figure clouds my focused path  His lightening bolt eyes, creep through my sight""  Could be related to  ""Fixed socket threat  Binocular vision  I see all I hear all  Superior Intellect""  I always imagine a massive robot space owl as the weapon that the night owls urge the people to create in order to fend off the threat in Cloud Mountain. The ancient figure could be the remains of the night owl weapon. I could totally be off with this so take it with a grain of salt."

On a snarky note, I'm tempted to say that even though he wrote it, Tommy is entirely wrong about any ""small lyrical connection to one of the songs in the parallax"" because /u/ImAJerk420 has explained several times over how there is absolutely zero connection between Coma Ecliptic and the Parallax story."

The balance will be better in the back-of-house (where the venue's speakers aren't competing as much with the acoustic sound of the drums and the raw signal from the amps) and a raised vantage point will give you a better perspective from which you can watch the band do their thing."

From what I hear their touring next year playing the new album in its entirety so I guess that will be when I hear it. And for what it's worth, they MAY have a Setlist ""A"" that they play it on. All speculation on my part, but this was apparently Setlist ""B"""

BetweenTheBuriedAndMe,3bmtql,TheErez,3,Wed Jul 1 23:07:53 2015 UTC,Is that normal for BtBaM?  I go to and have been to dozens of shows and I would say pretty confidently that playing an album from start to finish is something that doesn't happen unless it's explicitly stated that it will be.
BetweenTheBuriedAndMe,3bmtql,offworld92,2,Tue Jun 30 23:13:00 2015 UTC,"Yes, they write and record them with the intention of being listened to from start to finish, and being the stand-up guys they are, (usually) treat their audience to the same experience. Watched them play Colors and Parallax II start to finish, and they also played some of their ""classics"". TGM they did not play in it's entirety, for whatever reason, when I saw them, but they did play many Colors songs that night, which was what the people wanted. I don't know what to expect this time around, but there are very few songs I wouldn't want to hear them play from any of their albums."
BetweenTheBuriedAndMe,3bmtql,Dissentia,1 point,Wed Jul 1 00:06:59 2015 UTC,Like you I'm quite certain that they will not play Coma Ecliptic in it's entirety on this upcoming tour. They didn't do it immediately for Parallax II on the first tour of that album but obviously they did later. I'm sure it'll be the same with CE.
BetweenTheBuriedAndMe,3bmtql,RTB668,1 point,Wed Jul 1 12:23:47 2015 UTC,"I don't think it makes a difference to the band's bottom line. I can't imagine a scenario where someone who was planning on buying the album instead of torrenting it would download a leak and then refuse to buy the album, so I agree with you that there's probably not a noticeable difference to the band's revenue. But I think it does make a difference in principle and in sentiment.  In principle, you are paying for an album that is slated for release on a certain date. Those are the terms of the agreement. That is what you paid for. End of story. By acquiring a free copy early you are subverting that agreement. I consider myself beholden to the terms of my payment; if you don't choose to respect yours, so be it.  In sentiment, I deeply respect BTBAM. They collaborated with Metal Blade to settle on a release date. That is the release date that they endorse. If they wanted to release it as soon as it was done on a pay-what-you-want basis, they would have done that. Instead, they choose this means of release, on this date. I respect them, so I respect that release date. I choose not to let the decision of some employee at some music publication to leak the album usurp the decision of the band. If you're not moved by any of that, then I don't think there's much I can say to sway you. It's like I said before: nothing about the fact that some person unaffiliated with BTBAM chose to leak the album presumably against their will makes it okay to suddenly listen to it early. It's just suddenly more convenient, and apparently much easier to rationalize."
BetweenTheBuriedAndMe,3bmtql,eigenpants,1 point,Wed Jul 1 02:49:50 2015 UTC,There's no way I could wait knowing the leak was out.  There's only a few CDs that I've purchased over the last few years and 99% of them were BTBAM albums.

Right after Tommy sings ""A trapdoor locked from the inside"" in the last pre-Chorus for Melting City (About half a minute before that Drum and Bass break), Paul starts the soloy-riff thing wrong and confuses himself until it repeats again.

I remember leaks that had were significantly inferior to the official releases (Out-of-order or completely different samples, unfinished mixing, rough unfinished editing on intros/outros), so I'll wait till I can listen to the album in full.   I understand some people aren't thrilled with this album, but if Memory Palace (It's the only one I've listened to) is the weakest of the three singles they've released then I think I'll like Coma Ecliptic.

BetweenTheBuriedAndMe,3b6l26,roberoonska,7,Fri Jun 26 11:34:20 2015 UTC,"This is a very interesting thing to think of, and a very tough question to answer as well... I'm 100% fine with your list, it really gives a good idea on the path they've traced. But I'm going to try and give what I think could be a good summary of BTBAM's sound, as well as why I chose those songs:  Aspirations --> Ad a dglgmut --> Selkies --> Ants of the Sky --> Obfuscation --> Lunar Wilderness --> Melting City --> Turn on the Darkness  This feels the most true list to me. Even though almost every song on my list isn't my favourite from that album/LP, I feel like they summarize the album quite well.   Aspirations is to me one of the best crafted songs on self-titled, it features every element the album has and it doesn't wander off too much like Shevanel, in my opinion. Ad a dglgmut catches the vibe of Silent Circus better than Mordecai does in my opinion, being extremely heavy throughout the song with a very beautiful section in the middle, going heavy again towards the end. Selkies is definitely the song that depicts Alaska for me, even though it's not even near my favourites from that album (All Bodies, Alaska, Backwards Marathon and The Primer have a very special spot for me). Trying to define Colors' brutal awesomeness in one song is really something impossible, but I will have to go with Ants of the Sky. I could go with White Walls, really, but Ants of the Sky feels like it incorporates everything Colors brought to me - the heaviness, the beauty, the innovation, the musicianship. Obfuscation is the closest to a summary of Great Misdirect as it can be. It really just lacks a soothing part, but other than that, I think it represents quite well the direction they've went. Even though most people hate this album and especially Swim to the Moon, I love them so much. Lunar Wilderness is just flawless for Hypersleep Dialogues. It combines everything they had to offer in an 8-minute bowl of awesomeness, from the beautiful parts at the Intro/Outro to the insane heavy and skilled parts at the middle. It also gives a good idea on what's about to go on with the next album. The vibe change from this EP to TGM is just astonishing and this song describes it perfectly for me. Melting City is a personal favourite from Future Sequence, but I really believe it does a good job when it comes to feel the vibe from this album. If I had to pick another song to do it, it would be either Extremophile Elite or Silent Flight Parliament, but I think Melting City is a better candidate for this. Turn on the Darkness was a really hard choice for me. I could either stand with the heavy Famine Wolf or the tranquil Rapid Calm, but Turn on the Darkness is in the middle of both and it pretty much gives a quick idea on everything Coma Ecliptic has to offer. This album is sincerely great, I've been listening to it three times+ everyday ever since it leaked.   I got a bit long on these, but since I loved your idea of ""summarizing"" BTBAM's sound, I felt like a proper feedback was needed. Cheers!  (EDIT: I wrote LP instead of EP, fixed)."

BetweenTheBuriedAndMe,3b6l26,danielmartinsq,1 point,Sat Jun 27 01:20:38 2015 UTC,Concerning Swim to the moon: it's a love/hate thing. You either think its 'epic' or way too drawn out. I've always been in the second camp. I've always also hated how there's one line in the song sung by a shitty guest vocalist. Why?!

He sings for a band called Gut Feeling, used to be in a bear-themed Misfits tribute band called Nightbear, and also played bass for Orbs at one point. I dig what they were going for with his guest spot but I don't think his voice fits the production of TGM very well."
BetweenTheBuriedAndMe,3b6l26,swimtothemoon1,2,Fri Jun 26 21:39:44 2015 UTC,"I would tend to disagree about swim to the moon. I think it's the pinnacle of their greatness tied into one song. Obviously P2 is their greatest accomplishment as an album, but STTM is IMO, their greatest singular song by far. And easily my favorite song of all time.   There are moments of STTM I absolutely hate. The second verse after the first chorus pales in comparison to what they did in the first verse. But then they bring in the 8 minute instrumental section that blows my mind, literally every time I hear it. And then I realize that the instrumental section would not be effective as a peak, if it wasn't preceded by the mediocre second verse. Peaks and valleys are what BTBAM live and die on.   I'll be honest and say that they first three times I heard STTM, I fucking hated it. It was long, drawn out, incohesive, who the fuck is that vocalist at the beginning-he sucks. But the fourth time I listened to it, when the structure of the song was cemented in my mind, I had goosebumps throughout the entire song; never has a piece of music affected me in such a way.    And I think that's why TGM is better than Colors. I know that might be sacrilege on this sub, but it's my honest belief. Colors is a great album, a much better album than TGM. But TGM is a much better collection of songs. The individual songs on TGM: Obfuscation, Swim to the Moon, Disease, Injury Madness, and Fossil Genera, are all better songs IMO than anything on Colors besides maybe Ants of the Sky and White Walls. We'll exclude Desert of Song because it fits no where in BTBAM discography. Good song, just not a good BTBAM song. While Colors demands chronological listening, TGM showcases the best of that style of music before they delved into the prog-parallax era.   Anyway I'm drunk and rambling and forgot what my point was. Swim to the Moon is the best song ever."

BetweenTheBuriedAndMe,3b6l26,_Dobis_PR,2,Fri Jun 26 20:09:40 2015 UTC,Agreed. It might be the most typical BTBAM song (whatever that means) in CE. I would go with either King Redeem or Turn on the Darkness.

Except you can have breaks in between songs that transition scenery and atmosphere, like /u/musics_smarts_laughs pointed out in his original post. This would be such an original and awesome idea to further spearhead this Rock Opera concept, that they are trying to achieve in this album.  I also feel this would work since there is much dialog between characters in this album, much like their last album The Parallax II. But still enough lyrics in between lyrical dialog that shows what our main character, (let's call him The Patient) is going though experiencing this odd predicament he has himself in. I am absolutely in love with this concept that you are implying here!   Further more, it would make for a pretty f**ed up ending to a *music movie.

I watched them load in a the Theater of Living Arts in Philadelphia when they were touring playing The Parallax II in it's entirety, but didn't have the balls to say anything to them. Starstruck I guess. I'll never forget the first time i saw them though. It was 2006, at the Chameleon club. They were touring for their new album Alaska. I was front and center (as I always am :D) and during the song ""Arsonist"", Tommy did something very rare. He held the mic to the crowd in front of him. Right in front of me. And I got to scream my favorite lyric line off the self titled album. ""The Angel sleeps in her blood"". Ugh, i still get chills from that moment. 17 hours though dude that's crazy!

The band members were really cool when they totally didn't have to be. You as the fan didn't want to bother them too much when you easily could have just stalked them all day.  Just a lot of people trying to be nice to each other.  This is a pretty great time to be a BTBAM fan. I'm digging the new album and looking forward to seeing some of these songs played live.

Is it my favorite BTBAM album? No, but it's incredible nonetheless. It was a big step for them and it will definitely create a rift for some of their fans. However, in my mind, they can do no wrong. This album in my opinion features Tommy at his finest on the keys and the drum work is subtle, but incredible when you really focus in on things. Easily the best release of 2015 thus far and I'm already excited for what the next album may sound like!"
BetweenTheBuriedAndMe,3av34v,metaljunkie17,4,Tue Jun 23 23:01:50 2015 UTC,"I don't think Tommy is a tremendous keyboard player by any stretch (I'm inclined to think he'd agree, by the way). At times, the keyboard work just sounds plain corny. I have no idea what the hell they were thinking for some of this. I will give him major props for going so far out of his comfort zone vocally. It took a lot of balls to record some of the vocal parts on this album, and even though I don't think he knocked them all out of the park, they're all very high-energy.  Blake is the only thing keeping me interested in certain parts of the album. How he manages to squeeze so much drumming into this music completely blows my mind."
BetweenTheBuriedAndMe,3av34v,FirstProspect,1 point,Wed Jun 24 01:36:47 2015 UTC,100% agree. It's a shame they pulled back the drums and gave this album such a sterile mix.
BetweenTheBuriedAndMe,3av34v,MusicalVegan,6,Wed Jun 24 03:16:33 2015 UTC,"It's inevitable that there would be a split in the fan base with this release, just like some people prefered pre-Colors BTBAM. It's crazy how some of us will love Coma Ecliptic and others will be let down, and yet we all probably love Colors. That's just a testament to how diverse this band is; it sucks that they went in a direction that some fans didn't want, but it's awesome for those of us that like it."

BetweenTheBuriedAndMe,3av34v,StripedPangasius,17,Wed Jun 24 19:50:41 2015 UTC,"It sounds more similar to a Thomas Giles album than a BTBAM album, and I'm not just referring to the clean vocals. The music is less dynamic than previous releases, time signature/tempo changes seem forced and come off as jarring as opposed to previous releases where changes felt fluid and natural. I'm also hoping I'll ""get it"". For the first time I'm contemplating skipping a tour."
BetweenTheBuriedAndMe,3av34v,malloc_more_ram,5,Tue Jun 23 20:09:41 2015 UTC,"I'm more or less in the same boat. I've listened to it probably a dozen or so times, and I'm only really starting to ""get it."" The album does get better as it goes on, but almost every song has some parts that just plainly do not go together (i.e., the band makes a full stop with no interlude into a new section).   This is not what I have come to expect from this band. The album does have a sense of catharsis, as do all of their albums from Colors onwards, but I'm beginning to feel more and more like this album is a parody of itself (or they just got lazy). Songs have the same bones as their much beloved stuff, but they're missing refinement.   For example, ""Coma Machine"" is a hot mess. I think it's one of the worst songs this iteration of Between the Buried and Me have released. There are some nice melodic parts, but they're stitched together with these bizarre, unsettling prog-sturbation interludes.   I understand that they feel the need to change. As good as Colors is, they just can't release that album every two years and hope to stay relevant. But this album doesn't feel like their best effort. I see flashes of brilliance in some of these songs (looking at you ""Turn on the Darkness"" and ""Memory Palace""), so clearly they still know what the hell they're doing. Here's hoping their next release will be more up to what we expect of them because, honestly, this is their worst album since the self-titled.  EDIT - Unless they're playing the whole album start-to-finish, I'll be at the tour screaming every word and throwing my hands up in worship."
BetweenTheBuriedAndMe,3av34v,mynameisuncommon,4,Wed Jun 24 01:30:10 2015 UTC,"Totally agree. ""Less dynamic"" is exactly what I was trying to say. Still, I will 100% not be skipping the tour. It's not so bad that I don't want to see them live, as they always put on a great show no matter what. And their summer tour with Contortionist and Animals as Leaders is just too good a bill to pass up."
BetweenTheBuriedAndMe,3av34v,jonpacker,2,Tue Jun 23 20:38:13 2015 UTC,"I'm so glad I'm not the only one who thought this...  I love Giles too as well. Well I loved Pulse, a lot. I actually was not a fan of Modern Noise. Well there are a few songs I like, but overall I didn't like the sound.  Coma Ecliptic feels more like an extension of Thomas Giles than Between the Buried and Me. And it is really really disappointing.  It is all the things like the weird vocals, the lack of really heavy guitar, inclusion of way too much keyboard, more rocky and less metal sound. Even his clean vocals has changed so much from all the clean vocals he has done from the start up to about TGM. From then on it sounded more and more Giles-like.  Some songs even sounded My Chemical Romance-esque.  It is more rock-opera now? I really don't understand where BTBAM are trying to take themselves. It seems more like Tommy experimenting... At the expense of the bands sound.   I think he should keep his experiments to his side project and let the rest of the band drive the music as much as he does... Who knows, maybe that is the case and the entire band likes the direction they are going."

BetweenTheBuriedAndMe,3av34v,jack-whitman,6,Tue Jun 23 20:59:07 2015 UTC,"The only thing i was slightly disappointed by was the lack of the Penultimate song   I had come to expect the (WhiteWalls Swimtothemoon SilentFlight) type of song to conclude their albums.  Btbam is my favorite band, so bias will bleed through,however this feels like a natural progression for the band.  While the album also lacks the major build ups previously seen on ""releases"". They more than made up with it with the overall transitions and progressions within the actual songs... the way they reprise themselves also took a giant leap forward. Additionally the way Tommy is able to drive the music with his Key playing really show great growth within the chemistry of the band. Through much internal debate Turn on the Darkness is my favorite song on the album. The lyrics are vivid and thought provoking. Further, any song that has Paul singing is going to be a win in my book!  All of which are encapsulate by the ""they wont take notice"" (I think that's what he says) Outro breakdown    That bass groove in ectopic stroll though  Lastly, Blake deserves a fucking award for this album. His intricacies leave me utterly speachless. Blake has the ability to have sex with high-hat while finger the ride ever so gently creating a 3-some of cymbal coitus.  Parallax series (I consider it one fluid piece) Colors Alaska Coma TGM (Swim to the moon is the best thing they have ever written,ever, i will fight you) BTBAM Silent"
BetweenTheBuriedAndMe,3av34v,Dunsel_,3,Wed Jun 24 14:48:41 2015 UTC,"I agree with a lot of people here. When I first listened to the album, I was actually really let down. However I kept playing the album because each time I did, I'd notice something new. Having listened to it for the past week or two at least once a day, I can say that I've come to like it the more I've listened to it. Do I think it's their best? Not by a long shot. Parallax 2, in my opinion, was their best and a work of fucking art, so it would've taken quite a bit for me to put Coma above it."
BetweenTheBuriedAndMe,3av34v,theartofficial,4,Thu Jun 25 22:02:41 2015 UTC,"You pretty much described my thoughts exactly. The 'release' has lost value because there is less death metal and more climax on this album. I thought Parallax 2 was just incredible and couldn't believe how they just kept making great music that was similar yet different. I was expecting something else from Coma Ecliptic.   All musicians need to evolve to create a new sound or else it would be the same CD over and over again though... I appreciate the change even if I don't like it. It's cool most people do, but I guess I've become pretty critical and attached to a certain sound that BTBAM carries since I've been listening to them for so long. I don't feel 'let down' because they have so many other albums to listen to, and I like some of the songs (Coma machine and Famine wolf, like you said), but some tracks do get very repetitive."
BetweenTheBuriedAndMe,3av34v,Dunsel_,2,Tue Jun 23 23:58:05 2015 UTC,"It's weird, this album actually wowed me the most since Colors. Between this album and Colors their other releases had to grow on me. I'm at a point in Coma Ecliptic where I've listened so many times that I'm now finding things I don't like. I'm going to take a break with it until I miss it I guess but what I'm trying to say is that I love this album. That being said I can understand fans not liking it that much."

BetweenTheBuriedAndMe,3av34v,kyrannasaur,2,Wed Jun 24 03:24:01 2015 UTC,"I can understand where people are coming from when they say this, but I disagree. Personally this is my favorite album since Colors. I really wanted to love Parallax 2, but I just didn't. BTBAM had grown ""stale"" to me. Since Colors, my favorite albums have been Orbs Asleep Next to Science and Tommy's Modern Noise."
BetweenTheBuriedAndMe,3av34v,TheHandoftheSchwing,3,Wed Jun 24 01:08:42 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, I think Coma Ecliptic is very evocative of the Parallax LP. Both have very a prog-rock feeling to them, but Coma Ecliptic is missing the aggressive edge that their earlier stuff has.  I'm kind of surprised someone could like CE so much without liking the Parallax LP."
BetweenTheBuriedAndMe,3av34v,Orikons,2,Wed Jun 24 01:39:23 2015 UTC,I really enjoy the album but it definitely feels like it was a rushed effort by the band. I'm hoping this is a transitional record into a great follow up and not setting the standard. I'm thinking this will be the Alaska to their next colours.
BetweenTheBuriedAndMe,3av34v,tukus,2,Wed Jun 24 04:11:46 2015 UTC,"I would say the thing that let me down with this album is the majority of these songs aren't cohesive enough which is pretty reflective of the entire album not being very cohesive. They did a few reprises but it just didn't flow right and the ending seems very anti-climactic musically. These guys could be the greatest band in the world if they wanted, wish this had the same sort of song writing that made colors and parallax 2 so well. the changes in each song off both of those albums give a flawless listen through on both of those where as this it just doesn't have that same flow."

BetweenTheBuriedAndMe,3av34v,chrismetalrock,2,Sun Jun 28 13:42:04 2015 UTC,"I like the album, but I think the song structures and the layering melodies are very similar to Parallax II. To me, it is pretty similar to Parallax II, although they did branch out to more rock sections and less space-themed bits. I like the synths and the different sounds, Parallax II was very samey in tone. At the same time, there isn't really a whole lot of heavy chugging or hard hitting metal sections that were very welcome on Parallax I, The Great Misdirect, Colors, and Alaska. Although I think there was too much chugging on Colors however it was broken up with really great experimental sections.  There's a nice slow and hard hitting metal section in the middle of King Redeem - Queen Serene, but it's slower than the usual staccato sound blasts you typically hear in metal. I enjoy some of the bluesy/rocky sections such as at 2:30 in Turn on the Darkness, but others such as the blues solo over the acoustic guitar towards the end of that song is really basic and boring. They could have put something much more interesting in but in deciding for the simpler solo, I think they went too far. Even rock/blues solos like that one that have basic note choices have better rhythms.  I like the vocals, the singing is nice because it's more accessible and the layering of the vocals is also nice. I don't really have a problem with any of the vocals.  I like the riffs like the start of Memory Palace, but when the drums pick up it was just like the fill in the start of Astral Body. To me, the song is very similar to Astral Body in structure and cadences, however with a very heavy 7th to octave feel. This gives the song a bluesy/stoner metal theme which is powerful even at a slower tempo, but at the same time isn't as interesting as the more exotic harmonies on Astral Body. I like to think of the album as what would happen if you took the song writing style with constant leads and layering like Parallax II and use the tones/harmonies/atmosphere of The Great Misdirect. It's nice, but it also doesn't seem as fresh as Parallax II was when it was first released since it borrows so much in style from it.  I also feel like the more notey leads of Parallax II make it simultaneously more metal and also more muddled. I like it, but it also doesn't let the notes speak for themselves as much as they do in Coma Ecliptic. Plus, the chugging of Parallax II has pretty much left or been slowed down a lot so as to lose a metal tempo.  I thought Parallax II was a very accessible album to new listeners, but I think Memory Palace is even moreso. It definitely shied away from the very abrasive and aggressive parts that metal fans love and non-metal fans hate. I think they still have a ways to go before they can get that perfect balance of heavy metal that isn't too off-putting for the fans that like them for prog and not metal."
BetweenTheBuriedAndMe,3av34v,7stringsoflove,2,Fri Jun 26 02:32:15 2015 UTC,"The album, while I liked on the first hearing, has grown on me and I'm loving it now, but one thing is for sure: I fucking loved that outro song, ""Life in Velvet"", from the moment I first heard it."

BetweenTheBuriedAndMe,3av34v,Ssnapcase,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:07:35 2015 UTC,Listening to it now for the first time. Four songs in. I have never been the biggest BTBAM fan. However Colors is one of my all time favorite metal albums. I am digging this thus far. I feel like its BTBAM with Dream Theater added. If that makes sense.
BetweenTheBuriedAndMe,3av34v,mlslgn,1 point,Sat Jul 11 01:44:32 2015 UTC,"I'm in the same boat.  I like @wherez_da_bacon's comment about how no other band scratches the BTBAM itch.  For me, nobody comes close.  They're just so...BTBAM.  I hardly even listen to any heavier metal anymore.  Frankly, anything with screams and growls tends to get skipped by without a thought more and more...and yet I listen to BTBAM DAILY.  Daily.  And they never get old.  No other words to describe it.  I'll throw their self-titled on for a kick once in a while.  Colors quite often.  Both Parallax albums constantly.  Alaska.  Every album holds its merit in their discography.  Save one.  The Great Misdirect.  This album seems even less like what I love of them than TGM...but it's better than TGM.  TGM was never a hit for me, and it freaked me out to see them put out their first (and still only) total bummer of an album.  What freaks me out more, however...is that their entire style has changed.  In Coma Ecliptic they sound like a group of extremely talented musicians who love BTBAM and seek to emulate some of their style.  They don't sound like themselves to me.  And I worry that they'll continue in this direction and I'll never get another ""what I look for"" BTBAM album.  It isn't as deep nor heavy hitting in the heavy parts.  And it isn't a poetically beautiful in the soft parts.  It's like they molded all of their abilities into a ball rather than molded each piece into each other.  Even the way they ""attempted"" to make this album gapless in places it doesn't need to be bugs me.  11 separate tracks that aren't gapless....cool, do it.  You're BTBAM, and I trust your judgement.  Why the hell did you create wonky track endings/beginnings to try and form two tracks into one?  I.E. the ending keys in The Coma Machine transitioning into Dim Ignition.  The repeated note from Dim Ignition that starts up only to detract from the songs ending...and help to transition it into Famine Wolf...where it awkwardly ends ~20 seconds in with an attempted mask of guitar to distract you from the fact that they should have never been there to begin with.  IDK.  The whole thing feels off.  But it's definitely still a great album.  It just isn't ""them"" anymore...and doesn't scratch the BTBAM itch."
BetweenTheBuriedAndMe,3av34v,EffThatFace,-2,Fri Jun 26 15:40:15 2015 UTC,"First, anyone that says that this is the worst album since Self-titled has absolutely lost their mind or is 16 yrs old.  Self-titled was BTBAM coming out of an era of harmonic minor scale influenced bands such as Undying and PFC, when sXe was a thing and the sXe dance crews started back-flips and windmills. Self-titled showed that they were going to introduce clean riffs with heavy, and progress out of distortion only and screaming only.  Self-titled has more technical and catchy riffs than CE, and many genius parts that have made BTBAM who they are.  Will Goodyear defined the clean vocals that are so prevalent 16 years later.  There are technical parts and melodic riffs in Self-titled that cannot be rivaled.  Self-titled defined BTBAM, and if you can't see that, you were probably 5 when it was written.   I listen to CE, but the biggest problem I see, and this is what makes me wonder why they did it, is pulling off the vocals live.  I can't tell you how many live shows I've been to where the vocals were intolerable because it would be every live show I've ever been to.  Singing is not Tommy's gift.  It was Will's gift, but not Tommy's.  There is so much autotune in the album it's going to be hard to pull it off live without the cringe factor.  If you can't hear that, you're probably tone deaf.  It's like being color blind, there's no cure.   As far as the guitars go, it's just laziness, or old age, or whatever, I get it.  Your fingers get fat and slow and sausage-like. Blake is the only redeeming talent in this album, but in my opinion they progressed themselves out of anything technical or satiating with CE."

BetweenTheBuriedAndMe,3ajwan,TwoSunsInTheSunset,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:12:11 2015 UTC,"I'm hearing multiple influences in this album as a matter of fact.  The beginning and ending sections of Turn On the Darkness are very much reminiscent of Alice in Chains in their hay-day. Much like you said.  The beginning parts of King Redeem remind me of a lesser known alt-rock band by the name of 10 Years. Especially when the song starts to build. You might know them for their song Wasteland.  At 3:14 of Coma Machine we hear a sort of fusion jazz, progessive sound remnant of a 1970's band by the name of Kansas. At 0:54 seconds of Option Oblivion you hear these influences again. It maybe just the guitar and keyboard working together to fool my ears, but I swear I hear violin/fiddle like sounds.  At 2:42 of Node we hear the Rock Opera sound that everyone's been waiting so long to hear. But if you ever listened to any power metal in the 80's, then you might be familiar with a band by the name of Queensryche. Well turns out they did a Rock Opera as well by the name of Operation: Mindcrime. To be more exact a perfect example would be Anarchy X, right about at 0:51.  Edit - fixed Queensryche genre."
BetweenTheBuriedAndMe,3ajwan,djlenin89,2,Sat Jul 4 13:23:39 2015 UTC,Could be where the Coma Machine is actually located? Or perhaps a central area that the protagonist returns to during the coma dreams...

And then this room would be a central hub to all his dreams like thunderbottom said before. I think the 'please I need help' line could just be referring to the fact that he's realized the velvet cloaked guys are really bad and that he's gone too far in now and there's no way out."

Start there, give it a few listens to grow on you, and if it does, go to Colors and be blown away.  If you like Tommy Rogers vocals, you could also check out his side project, Thomas Giles.

BetweenTheBuriedAndMe,3aj7iy,roberoonska,2,Sun Jul 5 05:05:41 2015 UTC,"Listen to the second half of Mordecai and Selkies (the lead singles of btbam's first two albums, 'The Silent Circus' and 'Alaska', respectively). They are melodic and beautiful; a great intro to the band and how I discovered btbam.  Back when I first heard btbam I didn't like growls either. But slowly, they started to grow on me. I listened to singles from Alaska and loved the crazy riffage and occasional athem-like chorus. But I always found the growls too harsh.  That is, until I discovered Colors. To this day this is still the best album btbam has ever made. It totally changed my taste in music and taught me that growls weren't just angry screaming, but instead an instrument in their own right. I'd reccmmend that you give Colors a good shot all the way through, and then maybe another 10 times. The intro will teach you to love growls. If it can't... then there is no saving you.  After that, listen to some other songs from Alaska if you wish, then proceed through their discography in order. The Great Misdirect is just more general fun. I've always found Mirrors + Obfuscation to be the perfect balance of light and heavy. Swim to the moon will show you just how wanky and drawn out btbam is willing to get. Paralax I is by far their heaviest release, and it is almost entirely ominous grinding heavy-as-fuck riffs and jazz-fusion. A lot of people hate on it, but they have bad taste. I'm sure by this point you will agree with me. Anyway, they changed direction in Parallax II, where they decided to change up the routine and inject a lot more melody. Listen to Astral Projection to see what I mean; its like happy metal , a backwards rush intro meets death growls. That being said, there are still some real skull-crushing songs on this album, the foremost being Telos. Holy fuck it's so fucking heavy. Listening to the album from beginning to end is meant to feel like an interstellar journey, so take it in a couple times.  Coma Ecliptic is the lightest stuff that btbam has done, but I don't recommend you begin with it. They sprinkle growls throughout all the songs in a way that will just be annoying if you haven't already learned to appreciate their nuance. Would you rather merely put up with the growls, or actually appreciate them? It feels like this album is the result of the band's evolution and I think its clean vocal styles can only be understood in the context of their harsher back-catalog.   With this advice, I hope you can come to appreciate btbam entirely.  tl;dr start from the beginning and learn to love growling along the way"
BetweenTheBuriedAndMe,3aj7iy,sscf_,-1,Sun Jun 21 07:59:51 2015 UTC,"I'd advise The Great Misdirect. Colors is their best album imo, but it's kinda difficult to get into. You'll probably get hooked into Obfuscation and Fossil Genera, that was what had happened when I really started to like BTBAM."

BetweenTheBuriedAndMe,3abjvd,heavyshark,1 point,Fri Jun 19 02:12:33 2015 UTC,"In an Ideal world I would agree, but I think everyone has different frequencies they need to boost to get their preferred sound."
BetweenTheBuriedAndMe,3abjvd,MusicalVegan,1 point,Sat Jun 20 04:55:06 2015 UTC,"Studio speakers are tuned flat so engineers have a zero point in which to start boosting or subtracting specific frequencies.  They do this in order to ensure that the speakers themselves are not adding color or artifacts to the captured audio.  During final mixdown, playback and mastering you can bet your life that the engineer has a high quality eq, or several typically, that they are using to dial in the best (well broadest really) frequency range they can.  To clarify, engineers and producers do not release flat audio, they use flat response speakers in order to correctly reference the audio frequencies.  All this being said, there is not magic best EQ setting.  An EQ is added to a stereo system to literally compensate for the shortcomings of the speakers attached to the stereo receiver, and the shortcomings of the acoustics of the room in which the stereo is in.  edit:  so by adjusting the EQ settings on any stereo, you are trying to bring the audio back to that sweet-spot that the engineer(s) mastered at.  Some albums are mastered to sound better loud, some soft and some in between.  Typically metal is listened to at louder volumes, so the sweet spot can be found at a higher volume."

I don't know how many bands your equalizer has or how adjustable it is but for a fuller sound I would boost slightly in the lows and low-mids(somewhere 80-160hz maybe), and add a bit in the 2k-4khz for clarity. You could also scoop the mids so all the highs and lows are highlighted. Personally I like to keep or even boost the midrange, but that's just my weird self haha.

It's not like your fingers are able to tell the difference in diameter when you switch to heavier gauge strings.  What you are feeling is the difference in the tension it takes to tune that string to pitch.  Heavier gauge strings put more pull-force on the neck making the the force required to fret the string higher.  With the perfect setup in C# tuning, .11 gauge strings can feel like butter."

So i'm curious how you can get an .11 gauge set to feel like butter in C# ? The strings just have no tension, it's so hard to play things that need tremolo picking, especially the thicker strings. Even full pull offs are a lot more difficult because of the lack of tension. They are just so floppy -_-  Unless you're talking about a custom set like Dustie and Paul use or something ... ?"

As long as your guitar CAN be used for metal, there's no need for new pickups. strings alone will do the trick for the distortion tones. As for clean, you're kinda screwed. Not only are their pickups better than what most people use, but their amps and cabs are also built for that clean tone. Probably a $4000 investment to get their exact clean tone."

Then I learned to enjoy music that was completely different just as much. Btbam is very techinically impressive, but they aren't the best when it comes to mood, lyrics and general dance-a-bility.  Try listening to some post-rock, or indie or hip-hop. Or even just other types of metal. Expand your music interests and music will  become interesting again. That's my advice."

Impressive.  On the other hand, I think Tommy adds an element different than what you might normally be used to. I believe each member of their band is equally important. They are creating an over all experience - not a backdrop of tune for a singer to wale over. Once I realized this, there was no going back. They can play whatever genre of music they wish, they just choose their style of progressive metal and god bless them for it.  10 + years of nothing but love for me.

You're correct that many bands exist that quench the technical riff thirst or the speedy blast beats. BTBAM has very much evolved past their grungy beginnings into a more dramatic and whimsicle journey. Perhaps for me, the vocals have become a familiar part of the package, amongst their continued transition and shapeshifting.

Could definitely be interpreted differently though. It is 25 total eighth notes at 160.   In the second part, he's displacing the china cymbal so that it's being played on every fourth 8th-note, giving the illusion of a 4/4 half-time feel. Absolutely unreal."

BetweenTheBuriedAndMe,3a4tov,BigBurgerBonanza,2,Wed Jun 17 06:20:18 2015 UTC,"Alright this is the best explanation I can come up with after listening to that part a fuckload of times to try and figure out what was going on.   When Blake first comes in at 0:47 hes hitting the cymbal every other 16th note starting on the first beat of the measure (this gives it a 4/4 feel); however since 25 is not divisible by two, if he wants to hit the cymbal every other 16th note at the START of every measure of 25/16, he has to eventually break the pattern of hitting the cymbal every other 16th note and hit it two consecutive 16th notes in a row. The first consecutive 16th note is the 25th 16th note of the first measure, and the second one is the 1st 16th note of the second measure.   Before I was able to pick that out, the end of every measure would confuse me and make it hard to keep track of when he was hitting the cymbal because he's completely breaking the 4/4 feel hes establishing from the beginning of the measure.   As for the second part where he accents the cymbal straight over that whole part, the explanation is (hopefully) much simpler and easier to understand. He's accenting the cymbal every four 16th notes starting on beat one of the first measure, and after 4 measures of 25/16, the accents line back up to beat one.     Idk if this will make any sense to anybody reading it, but this is the best way I could find to put it in words  EDIT: that guys picture gives a visual explanation of what I was trying to describe"

So it's 5/4,3/4.5/4  That's generally how it's read but you can add them and make 13/4 or 26/8 or 52/16 if you want but it's not really practical from a composition standpoint.  Just because he changes his cymbal accents to 1/2 notes doesn't mean that the time signature of the part has changed, only the accent.    Edit: For clarity, when the part starts at 0:47 just count along with his Cymbal hits.  The guitar parts hover a bit as a few of the notes are linked or ghosted between the measures, but they are still in the same time.  It gives a part a poly-rhythmic feel without actually being in multiple time.  Meshuggah uses this trick a lot"
BetweenTheBuriedAndMe,3a4tov,sue_poftheday,1 point,Wed Jun 17 16:37:20 2015 UTC,"If it were 5/4 3/4 5/4 that means there would be 26 eighth notes. Which is wrong, since there is 25. If you look at the chart that I posted at the top and follow along, you'll see what I mean.  When he moves to doing half-notes on the china, you can hear the overlap and that it's not even."

BetweenTheBuriedAndMe,3a2jxb,meltingcity_,2,Tue Jun 16 19:32:46 2015 UTC,"I agree.  They pretty much say this after every album, with the exception of Parallax II, since it was deliberately a second part of a whole.  I think people just tend to project what they already know onto something knew but why would you spend a bunch of time and energy creating an entirely new and challenging concept, only to go back to the old one?"

Oh no, Tommy said the word ""machine,"" he must be referencing EE and not the fucking ""coma machine"" that makes this whole album possible.   In all honestly, this is probably due to the fact that writers will focus on certain subjects, and while even doing two completely different things, reference those things in completely similar ways.   From what it sounds like, the coma machine is this tank like thing that isolates you from everything, complete sensory depravation. No night owls, no prospects, just a guy going through his past lives and coming to terms with his own life."

Also, in other song we can hear lines   I can't hear a thing, I can't see a thing.   I know about sensory depravation tank and I can't say it is all about Night Owls, Prospects, etc..

On the theme of teeth and hunger and the rest in this song, I think the run part in clean vocals afterwards could be ""run and devour"", with the end of ""devour"" not stressed, trailing off. OR it's completely wrong. I also think the ""kids"" is ""can't"" in the ""replace their souls"" line."
BetweenTheBuriedAndMe,39yv84,curtainmuglamp,2,Thu Jun 18 13:06:34 2015 UTC,"I definitely am hearing ""all that's left"" now!  Still not sure about the second line...I almost want to say it's ""we move beyond..."" but I clearly hear ""we will be..."" something.    Yeah, I hear either curse or maybe crush    You could be right about ""run and devour"", it at least fits into the rest of the lyrics.  And I used to think it was ""can't replace their souls"", but that doesn't fit into the line well, but maybe I had another part wrong?  Anyway, edited with all of these, thanks!"

BetweenTheBuriedAndMe,39yv84,DoctorBlaine,2,Wed Jun 17 14:37:12 2015 UTC,"My 2 cents - in Option Oblivion it sounds like he may be saying ""Enter the new ache"" which could make sense with regard to the previous line about suffering and the following line about pain. Also the line after ""new air opens my mouth"" sounds like ""gasping new breath."" Also I always heard ""Swim without limbs"" not ""with the land"""
BetweenTheBuriedAndMe,39yv84,Renovarian00,2,Wed Jun 17 18:33:43 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure it's ""wake"" there, fitting with the theme of being in a coma/waking from a coma. The ""new"" wake is death."

BetweenTheBuriedAndMe,39w5yn,geltoid,5,Wed Jun 17 03:15:05 2015 UTC,"In my mind, the album is divided into ""movements"", each one interconnecting with the album as a whole, and each one phenomenal in their own rights.

BetweenTheBuriedAndMe,39w5yn,roberoonska,3,Mon Jun 15 14:05:05 2015 UTC,I'd agree. The second movement is the best one.
BetweenTheBuriedAndMe,39w5yn,Crossover523,5,Tue Jun 16 02:12:55 2015 UTC,"I really like the section with Paul singing in Turn on the Darkness.   I agree that the end of Life in Velvet is also awesome, it makes for a great album conclusion.   I definitely notice how the additional keys parts on the album sound a lot more like Tommy's solo work than any of their previous albums did as well. Particularly in, Dim Ignition... It sounds like that one could be straight off Modern Noise."
BetweenTheBuriedAndMe,39w5yn,EyePeaEh,5,Mon Jun 15 12:14:39 2015 UTC,Dim Ignition sounds like it could have been on the Tron Legacy soundtrack and done by Daft Punk. I'm really enjoying that song.

BetweenTheBuriedAndMe,39w5yn,DoctorBlaine,4,Mon Jun 15 19:44:50 2015 UTC,"I cannot get enough of this album. Like many of you, it too took me quite a few listens to really click with me, but thats what this music is about. You aren't supposed to listen to it once and understand the concepts and intricate sounds immediately. This album is meant to provoke thought and most importantly tell a story. BTBAM showcased their story telling ability coherently with Parallax 1 and 2, then perfected it with Coma Ecliptic.  It may not be as hard hitting as Parallax 2 (or Hypersleep Dialogues for that matter), but I would argue that the story here is much more coherent than anything they have ever done. Overall the more I listen, the more I understand. BTBAM are musical geniuses and this album is a masterpiece."
BetweenTheBuriedAndMe,39w5yn,roberoonska,3,Mon Jun 15 14:01:01 2015 UTC,"I feel like you need to have a certain mindset to really enjoy it. If you just think of it as a 70 minute prog-metal Bohemian Rhapsody you'll like what you hear, but if you're looking for heavy as fuck classic btbam you might be disappointed.   I agree with others that the sound was a little too 'tommy-esque' at times (dim ignition being the biggest culprit). It reminded me of his solo albums and 'The Black Box' from the Parallax 2. I would have preferred the album without these Muse-like parts.   Overall, I'd say that I most enjoyed the middle of the album, from 'Famine Wolf' to 'Rapid Calm'. The best song on the album is 'King Redeem - Queen Serene'. I'm still not the biggest fan of 'Memory Palace', although 'The Coma Machine' is much better in context."
BetweenTheBuriedAndMe,39w5yn,Approval_Guy,3,Tue Jun 16 02:24:38 2015 UTC,"This was an album I was almost completely blind-sighted by even though I had been heavily anticipating it since its announcement.  I was a huge fan of Tommy's harsh vocals and the general crushing feeling this band often gives off.  Upon hearing that it would be more keyboard oriented, and the vocals would be cleaner than before, I assumed the worst and nearly wrote the album off.  But as soon as Node kicks off to the end of Life in Velvet I was floored.    Everything about this album, at least in my opinion, works.  It is a well oiled (coma) machine that rocketed me past my poor expectations into a world of beautiful, heavy, and laser precise rhythms and riffs.  Everything feels in its right place, and nothing that defines BTBAM is missing.  In fact, I believe that in the future this might be the album to define the band.  Whereas Colors introduced a new era for the band that included jazz breaks, long-form songwriting, and even wilder genre bending than before; this album takes all that they've learned as a band and streamlines it into an album that redefines what BTBAM is while retaining everything that makes them adored by so many.  I'm hesitant to give it a personal score, but I love this record.  In what has been a spectacular year for music so far, this album stands proud with the best.  It will be really interesting how it stands up against the rest of their discography in the coming years."

I'm sure I will get downvoted to hell, but this album doesn't really make me want to start it over with each listen. I started with TGM, then fell in love with colors, then Alaska and so on... But when parralax 2 came out, I was convinced this band could never let me down. The fact that when it ends, I am excited for it to begin again is still so amazing to me. I think the new album is awesome in the fact that it's another change of pace, and the band keeps evolving, but at times, to me, it feels like ""Tommy and friends"" more than BTBAM as a whole. It's less prog and more watered down muse meets NIN at times. I have only given about 15 listens so far, and while I fucking LOVE a few sections (most of those which have been mentioned already) I honestly think this is my least favorite album to date. I will continue to see them live, and I will no doubt know this album by heart, I just feel like the songwriting was a bit more rushed than usual. Am I the only one who feels this way?"
BetweenTheBuriedAndMe,39w5yn,obi-wanjewnobi,4,Sat Jun 20 09:04:16 2015 UTC,"Good on them for trying something new. It was a little underwhelming, sure - Underwhelming for BTBAM. I just wasn't ready for the aesthetic they are going for...you're right it's very Tommy-centric, but I think they were going for more of a driving concept record (rock operatic), focused on story and atmospherics. In that situation you really have to let the vocalist have the spotlight more, which is a tricky thing to do for such a immensely talented band. They've done this in the past to an extent, but with the more melodic approach comes a different take on the BTBAM excitement and tense juxtaposition of the songs' many working parts.  I'm keeping the album in my car and am going to just let it grow on me. I'm perplexed by this thing, but in a great way."
BetweenTheBuriedAndMe,39vwmk,TheFamineWolf,14,Mon Jun 15 05:54:28 2015 UTC,I love it. It's honestly what I thought the whole album would sound like when they announced it was going to be a rock opera.   Though it doesn't have anything on Man Land.

BetweenTheBuriedAndMe,39vwmk,Lankeysob,4,Tue Jun 16 16:07:53 2015 UTC,"Love it! I may be way off here but there's a part in the first ""verse"" where the music changes very suddenly for a few bars before returning to the verse. I think the lyrics are ""please stop I need help - my walls are covered in velvet"" and it's almost like the character is momentarily waking up from the coma and the song  reflects this. Again, until the lyrics come out it may just be an unfounded interpretation but it sounds awesome either way!"

It's going to be a while before I make my final decisions, as there is a lot to digest here. But from the very beginning, I knew this one was a contender for best track on the album. I'm also partial to King Redeem/Queen Serene.
