spotify,3e51du,It-Wanted-A-Username,10,Wed Jul 22 00:34:24 2015 UTC,"Spotify has finally done it. There are so many companies and apps and music services that look at what you listen to and then build playlists and recommendations based off your preferences. The first time Spotify really impressed me in this aspect was the playlist they generated based off my listening patterns from last year. Now though they've one-upped themselves.  I'm about 12 songs into this weekly playlist and every song I've added to my constantly growing ""starred"" playlist. I've loved every single one and they're all new to me. The most impressive part to me is that these songs branch multiple genres and I am a person that loves tons of different music.  TL;DR: Spotify's recommendations are on point"
spotify,3e51du,z0mbiassassin,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:02:59 2015 UTC,Agreed. My playlist has been incredible so far (about half way through it) and most of the songs I have added to my master playlist.
spotify,3e51du,ItsaGDtravesty,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:53:08 2015 UTC,"I've found it to be hit or miss. Unfortunately, I've been getting a lot of recommendations for artists I've only listened to a little bit and don't really like.  I still ultimately prefer last.fm suggestions (I use Spotlistr to make playlists easily), but this is definitely a step in the right direction for Spotify. They have so much listening data at their fingertips that they could really become a definitive source for music discovery if they wanted.   I hope that it continues to improve and exposes more people to music they wouldn't have otherwise heard."
spotify,3e51du,CynicalRabbit,2,Wed Jul 22 01:53:29 2015 UTC,It's been great for me! It's still new so I expect that it'll keep improving overtime.
spotify,3e51du,LifeinParalysis,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:14:39 2015 UTC,I've liked a few of my recommendations. I'd like an option to customize. I listen to many random songs during the week that I don't necessarily like but am too lazy to flip from.

You could easily search for tracks in a certain BPM range and genre using EchoNest and then lookup the Spotify ID.  Also, not exactly what you're looking for, but a site where you can make Spotify playlists by BPM : https://walk.jog.fm/"

spotify,3e3ybi,jackbrux,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:23:26 2015 UTC,I don't think it was really intended to be used this way but rather as a personal recommendations playlist. It will change each week so you have to save the playlist to preserve it (it updates on Mondays).
spotify,3dyl4d,SummoningSickness,22,Mon Jul 20 16:17:22 2015 UTC,Listening to mine for the first time. I don't typically follow playlists but this will obviously be the exception to that rule. So far so good. I think it's one of the best ideas Spotify has had in a long time.
spotify,3dyl4d,lameredditusername,10,Mon Jul 20 18:02:41 2015 UTC,"The playlist they generated for me is pretty solid! really bummed that I forgot headphones at work today.   I remember reading in one of the articles that the more you listen to it, the better it gets at guessing. Anyone know how they do that? you cant rate the songs, or delete them from the playlist, so Is it just based off of whether you skip them or not?"
spotify,3dyl4d,sassafrassquatch,6,Mon Jul 20 17:30:26 2015 UTC,"The wired article gives a bit of insight into the process, but it looks like it's mostly automated based upon what you listen to regularly.  http://www.wired.com/2015/07/spotify-perfect-playlist/"
spotify,3dyl4d,caust1c,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:46:57 2015 UTC,"It's collaborative filtering, based on what you listen to (for more than 30 seconds or so it counts, otherwise it doesn't count -- also depends on the context, like listening to radio or playing off the discover page doesn't count as much so it doesn't feed back into its own recommendations).  So if you listen to A and B a lot, and lots of other people listen to B and C a lot, you will likely get a recommendation for C."
spotify,3dyl4d,a1k0n,8,Tue Jul 21 14:41:28 2015 UTC,"Got it on the web player, really cool in my opinion! Don't know how one gets it back if they un follow it, not that I have.  Looking forward to next weeks because this weeks is good!"

I was never really a fan of the discovery playlist you could find on the browse page but this feels completely personalized and almost every song I've listened too from it so far is really good.

spotify,3dyl4d,zacktheman,5,Tue Jul 21 19:04:54 2015 UTC,"Loving it, reminds me a bit of the End of 2014 playlists they did because of how much I love the music it picked for me. It's like it knows exactly what you haven't heard but would love. Really prefer this over the Apple Music everything-for-everybody approach of curation, though that has its merits too. Hoping Spotify keeps the updates rolling, we've been waiting a while for these new features they showed off earlier this summer."
spotify,3dyl4d,REDDIT_RAMPAGE,2,Mon Jul 20 17:41:41 2015 UTC,I just noticed it in my playlists today and have been listening the past hour or so. I think it is pretty fantastic so far. It's really nailed my taste. 10/10 will listen again.

Spotify app is present across multiple platforms with thousands of devices and a variety of circumstances which may effect the application in a desktop environment.

However, my upload speeds are comparable on both Apple Music and Spotify. It may be an iOS issue. I'm uncertain, though, as a search of the community forums basically turned up nothing. Have you tried completely removing the app+cache and resyncing?   Sometimes low space can cause it to be slow or moving the app to the background. However, since AMusic works fine, this is unlikely.  Beyond that, you'll probably need to contact support. @SpotifyCares is fastest."

If a particular song comes that starts your day off right. Sometimes customers come and start singing along to the song and it makes them happy and it starts their day off perfectly (which is kind of my job as a barista).

Do you have volume normalization turned on? You can find it:  edit > preferences > show advanced settings > ""set the same volume level for all tracks""   Barring that, you need to verify that your volume in the Spotify app is turned all the way up. Check your Window's volume mixer to verify that the Spotify volume control isn't turned down."
spotify,3dr2ou,engrey,3,Sat Jul 18 17:37:08 2015 UTC,I remember Spotify many months ago had an app update that made it sound like the songs played softer. When playing music from Spotify on my iPhone I had to constantly adjust my phone volume to max and then to say 20 out of 30 or so on my car audio. In comparison with Apple Music (setting on iPhone being the same volume) I only need to move the car volume to 10-15 and that is just as loud.  For whatever reason Spotify plays softer for me or sounds like it has for a long time.  Not really scientific but I do remember reading others having to crank their volume for Spotify regardless of bitrate.
spotify,3dr2ou,engrey,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:45:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's exactly what I'm experiencing, almost word for word.  I noticed the effect on my car audio system because I was having to crank up the volume outside my normal range for what I consider to be loud. Perhaps I'll contact Spotify and see if I can get an exact answer. I started using Spotify in April and its been like that ever since."
spotify,3dr2ou,mitsuhiko,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:02:04 2015 UTC,Good luck getting a direct answer from them about it. If you go to the Spotify forums and look it up there I bet you will find a lot of people saying the same thing or have for months.
spotify,3dr2ou,avickthur,1 point,Sun Jul 19 08:16:13 2015 UTC,Songs are intentionally not as load sonthat they do not suffer from compression. Look at loudness wars if you care about the details. Spotify uses replay gain later to remix the volume consistently later.

Then contact Spotify through their website constumer feedback form asking to delete your account and give the reason 'I want to make a new account'. They specifically put this option in for people who registered through Facebook first (there was a time when that was the only option) and decided they wanted a truly separate Spotify account later.
