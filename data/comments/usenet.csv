usenet,3e45x5,Kenzo86,6,Tue Jul 21 20:37:14 2015 UTC,"1) If you set your qualities and read the forum stickies on how to use the watchlist functions, you should not run into any missing snatches. If there is a missed snatch, we can easily debug and see what the problem was.  2) VideoSort is nice, it uses the guessit library to rename which works for 99% of the stuff out there. DNZB headers are also sent along with the download so that VideoSort can more accurately ID the movie/show (if it was properly identified on DOGnzb)  3) I wrote NotifyPlex which does a targeted refresh of your plex libraries after a successful download in NZBGet and depending on the category, it will know which type of library it is.  4) There are some other PP-scripts you can use to send you push notifications after the download succeeds (pushbullet, pushover, etc.). Take a look at the nzbget forums under extension scripts. Hopefully the forums are back up after that sourceforge disaster.   If you need any help with anything, feel free to PM me"
usenet,3e45x5,mannibis,2,Tue Jul 21 22:03:26 2015 UTC,"Legend. Thanks very much, and thanks for the plex script. Regarding #3 - How does nzbget separate TV shows from Movies? Currently sonarr sends the file to a sort folder which moves the file to a ""TV"" folder which plex reads and adds into the TV library...I would preferably like to have 2 parent directories on my NAS (TV) and (MOVIES).  Is the only way of checking that the download failed via nzbget? is FailureLink script necessary? Also regarding an issue of payment since you're staff. https://dognzb.cr/board/index.php?/topic/2600-buying-and-upgrading-account/"
usenet,3e45x5,mannibis,4,Tue Jul 21 22:22:01 2015 UTC,"For NotifyPlex to automatically detect the type of media, you need to set up categories in NZBGet. I call one ""movies"" and the other ""tv"". When the DOGnzb watchlist sends an nzb to NZBGet it passes along the category (TV > HD for example). So what you do is define aliases for your ""movies"" category, which should be something like ""movies*""  and ""tv*"" for your tv category. This means that NZBGet will place the download in the defined categories and NotifyPlex will then know what libraries to refresh.  FailureLink is a great tool to use if you don't rely on other apps to do the failed download handling for you. I find it a bit more efficient in that it directly contacts the indexer for another download. If you're going to move to this type of setup, I highly recommend using it."

usenet,3e0aql,Betrayedgod,4,Tue Jul 21 00:09:06 2015 UTC,"This is a slightly modified repost.  A service disclosing user download data or article availability publicly would do irreparable harm to the few remaining providers.  This would increase legal expenses, speed up takedowns on all providers, and escalate consolidation even further..     Untrustworthy users will scrape this data if disclosed  Announcing user downloads and article availability is damaging in various ways.  There should not even be a question if data will be scraped, it will happen. Long term, disclosure of article availability will harm all providers resulting in faster takedowns.   Just because you can implement a feature does not mean you should implement it.  The host of this data could be a ripe target for law enforcement and copyright organizations  A host advertising a treasure trove of user download data is ripe for the picking by law enforcement agencies and copyright organizations.  If the host charges a fee (or accepts donations) and also provides NZB, then this could be interpreted as facilitation of copyright infringement putting the host admin and staff at risk of criminal and civil penalties.  Servers could be subpoenaed or seized and give law enforcement and copyright organizations unrestricted access to database records (user, IP, datetime, download, provider, etc).  Logging this data could also lead to civil or criminal penalties for users submitting reports (log of copyright violations).    Bulk data collection: why open access to some distributed user data is a very bad idea  Industry contractors are well known to monitor indexers.     our team that monitors over 17 indexing sites   Data made available by indexers to their own users could easily be downloaded, scraped, logged, cited and or subsequently used by various copyright holders.  A website offering data on availability of articles would be performing a sizeable amount of bulk data collection for hostile organizations and their contractors by offering this ""feature"". Ultimately this would end up damaging any variance and uniqueness of NNTP services as automated bots, scraped this data, then submits claims faster to all providers.    Failing to think about ramifications  Developers (usually indexer sysadmin/software devs) are failing to consider the ramifications of their feature development.  They are increasing liability for providers, which will ultimately harm the viability of the very services they depend on.   Why are more providers automating takedowns? Why are more providers increasing the speed of takedowns? Why are more providers removing articles (messageID) without review? Why are more providers selling out to Highwinds?   The answer is simple; providers are experiencing increasing liability from continuous legal challenges combined with external pressures (legal, political, users).  Ever so often now, developers and indexer staff are creating more liability issues for various parties by promoting illegal activities and developing ""features"" that create more liability issues than they solve.  KISS (Keep it simple stupid) applies here.    Developers are crossing lines that should not be crossed."

On a personal note, I can't remember the last time I was unable to complete a download due to missing files, are people still experiencing this on a regular basis?  If its happened to me once in the last 6 months I honestly can't recall.  I run a Highwinds primary with XS News & Astraweb backups.  I do automate but even when I start downloads manually I can't remember having an issue with completion in at least the last 6 months and certainly nothing that I couldn't acquire by simply trying another NZB file."
usenet,3e0aql,FlickFreak,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:55:41 2015 UTC,"I'm currently diversified with Supernews+Blocknews&Tweaknews, and I had a third backup previously. You must be lucky enough to only get new files, or files that haven't been DMCAd.  Well trying a different release is exactly the benefit, much like downloading a file to check for passwords, or STAT completion checking.  This is all a convenience to ""keep it simple"". =)  All it takes is one indexer.  Newznab was started by a couple people porting net_nntp and it looks like nZEDb started similarly.  They both use open databases, and one can be trivially branched."
usenet,3e0aql,FlickFreak,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:31:25 2015 UTC,It probably is a combination of luck and automation that is working for me.  In all honesty if you were going to get any support from the index devs it would likely be from the nZEDb team.  They seem to like cutting edge features and seem to be more open to change.  The Newznab dev team is pretty tight knit and trying to get new features implemented can be a tough sell.  Seems these days they are only fixing bugs and are not too worried about additional bells & whistles.

If I use thetvdb it tries to rename them correctly but it doesn't get the episodes right. and if I take anidb it renames it to ShowName - 000 - EpisodeName.ext which results in the same problem. But this does work for other shows. Thanks for reminding me :)

usenet,3dxwd4,TalothSaldono,2,Mon Jul 20 19:06:22 2015 UTC,The problem is that the anime title expects an explicit format to avoid incorrectly parsing normal TV shows using the 101 format.  Anime format normally is [subgroup] series title {abs}...  Normally it's followed with codec and a hash but iirc that's optional. But the subgroup in brackets is critical.  If possible try keep a backup (hardlinked for example) while you're playing around with it.
usenet,3dydxc,hatefax,6,Mon Jul 20 15:25:30 2015 UTC,"First you need a Usenet service provider (Astraweb, UNS, UsenetBucket, etc.) This is where you'll be downloading the articles from and you configure this in Sabnzbd.  Next you'll need a few good indexers (that scour usenet and provide you with the nzb files which are just pointers to the articles). You configure these in Sickbeard.

usenet,3dydxc,DarthEru,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:25:14 2015 UTC,"The free ones can be fine, but it depends on how much you use it. Most free indexer accounts are pretty heavily rate-limited when it comes to how many times you can use their API per day, as well as how many nzbs you can download in a day. (The API is what the Sickbeard or Sonarr apps use to talk to the indexer to find nzbs. For example, a single search would be one API use.)   Paying isn't a huge deal either, it's often a single payment of $10-20 for a lifetime account. I'd advise trying a bunch of indexers for free to see which ones have the kind of selection you're looking for, then consider paying if your usage is likely to go over their limits, or if you simply want to support the site."

usenet,3dqu10,ComputerSavvy,2,Sat Jul 18 18:50:25 2015 UTC,"Provider: Easynews  Internet: Rogers 250Mbps  DL Speed: ~36MBps sustained  I suspect the issue isn't your USP but your router (unless you're connected directly to your Hitron gateway).  When I upgraded to the Rogers Ignite 250 service I had to upgrade my router to something capable of greater WAN-to-LAN speeds.  My previous router was the Linksys E4200v1 which I ran tomato firmware on.  With the tomato firmware my E4200v1 would max out at roughly 115 Mbps downlink (or 14 MBps).  I was able to max out the connection with the OEM firmware due to a feature called FAST-NAT that is not enabled in most third party firmware.  The cost of using the OEM firmware though is that you sacrifice lots of features compared to tomato (or DD-WRT).  The solution was to replace my router with a newer dual-core ARM SoC based router.  The Linksys EA6500v2 proved to be a decent replacement and was available from Canada Computers as a refurb for $69.99.  Bonus, it supports DD-WRT and is fast enough to max out my connection even without FAST-NAT.  So if you have an older wireless router or are using a third party firmware such as tomato or DD-WRT on your older router then it may be time for an upgrade.  That or try changing back to the original OEM firmware to see if performance is any better.  A second possibility is that your network card or router network ports are 10/100 fast ethernet and not gigabit.  Make sure all of your network hardware (router, switch, desktop, notebook, etc.) is equipped with gigabit network ports.  This issue could slow down your service even if you are connected directly to the Hitron gateway and are not using a third party router.  Remember, your connection will only be as fast as the weakest link in the chain.  Lastly, if you're downloading over a wireless connection you may not be able to max out your connection.  Make sure all speed tests are conducted with a hard-wired connection to ensure reliability of the results."

Thus it would essentially be anonymous as far as the actual purchase is concerned.  FWIW, in my case it wasn't actually a card, but just a code on a receipt.  Oh, and it was incredibly hard to come by.  On their website they have a map that lists places that sell paysafecards by you, but I called probably more than 20 of the ones listed and they had no idea what I was talking about.  I finally found a small cell phone store where the owner knew what it was and understood how to process the transaction.

These guys are quietly and very efficiently moving towards having a monopoly on the usenet business. The fact they're making mass acquisitions while keeping it on the DL doesn't bode well for the future. Once they have a firm grip on the vertical, their service will be as good as any other business that doesn't have competition- service gets worse and prices increase. A few months back another redditer tested an upload (legal) vs takedown time for most of the major providers (if I remember correctly, he tested all but one). HW/resellers had slightly eased up on takedown time to a roughly 2 hours vs 60-90 minutes they had been historically. IMO anything is better than HW or giga."
usenet,3d6aj5,thomasmit,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:21:42 2015 UTC,That must have been months ago because I think it's like almost 24 hours now and has been for a little bit so they seem to listen to users or competition.  I know this has been debated to death but highwinds didn't buy anybody not willing to sell so it took two to tango.  Something made the seller sell or think getting out of Usenet was the right time so we will never know if whoever they bought would even still be around if they didn't get bought.

You could do the math and see if it works in your favor for block account over unlimited.  If you don't wanna worry you could just pay the $50 for the year on frugal Usenet and be done with it.

It's so easy to write a plugin for NZBGet and have it do whatever you want both before and after a download. Otherwise, there are tons of plugins already written that may already suit your needs.  NZBGet is very lightweight because you tell it exactly what you want it to do. The things you don't like about NZBGet (such as the auto categorization) is just a option you overlooked.  In fact with NZBGet you're not restricted at all to the number of categories you want; you can create as many as you like.  Click here for a Category Example. Not only can you make as many categories as you want, you can have your plugins called in different orders (or some not at all) based on the category detected.  So it's actually really powerful in that sense."
usenet,3d30mb,lead2gold,9,Mon Jul 13 19:05:12 2015 UTC,"From a developer perspective NZBget is inferior if it comes down to integration. Mainly because it does not have an API key. This means a 3rd party needs to have your full credentials and can therefore also read out private data (such as news server credentials) or alter settings.  Even if my application has no malicious intent, I do not trust myself to write an application that others might not use as an entry point. So in essence every 3rd party integration with NzbGet is another attack vector.  Sabnzbd even has a restricted API key that only permits adding new nzb's  So from the perspective of an external application developer SabNzbd is the better option in terms of security."
usenet,3d30mb,boran_blok,7,Mon Jul 13 11:07:42 2015 UTC,NZBGet has RestrictedUsername/Password and AddUsername/Password which work the same way as API key.  https://github.com/nzbget/nzbget/wiki/API#authentication

usenet,3d30mb,boran_blok,4,Mon Jul 13 12:27:55 2015 UTC,I was on SAB for a few years but switched to nzbget because of completion issues and a better backup server implementation.  The latter basically took care of the former after swapping to nzbget.  In SAB I was getting stuff that wouldn't complete yet the same nzbs worked fine in nzbget.  I submitted some logs to the SAB devs who were nice but in the end I just needed it to work.  My NAS does a lot of other stuff and nzbget is far lighter on resources.

usenet,3d30mb,daschu117,2,Mon Jul 13 16:17:01 2015 UTC,"As a Linux user, I was always unhappy with sabnzbd's use of Python and having to make sure that all of the modules matched. And running on archlinux required making sure that everything was installed properly, including several items from the AUR.  Nzbget is a compiled service and is much nicer to run under archlinux because it's included in the default repos and doesn't require making sure that all of the dependencies are at the correct version.  Any other differences between the software have long since been forgotten or glossed over."
usenet,3d30mb,TheCrach,2,Mon Jul 13 21:19:47 2015 UTC,No idea why but when I use Sabnzbd I get 20-30MB/s. But with NZBGet I get 90-120MB/s
usenet,3d30mb,z1lt0id,2,Mon Jul 13 23:05:50 2015 UTC,Cause nzbget has more hipster cred. On a serious note I always found nzbget to be more reliable with obfuscated releases than Sabnzbd.
usenet,3d30mb,FlickFreak,3,Mon Jul 13 03:06:15 2015 UTC,"There used to be a feature gap between the two but in some recent releases (and alpha releases) SABnzbd has bridged that gap.  SABnzbd now supports failed download handling and server priorities (as of 8.0alpha2) amongst other features.    NZBget should be lower on resources but that only matters on low powered devices such as you NAS and some other SoC or APU powered devices.  This would only impact download speed and would have no benefit for par repair or decompression actions.  For most computers built in the last 4-5 years you'd be hard pressed to find much difference in performance.    I personally like the postprocessing capabilities of SAB better and I dislike the history management of NZBget.  I also find that SAB is more widely supported from an integration standpoint.  So no, you aren't really missing out on any big features (provided you're using the most recent SABnzbd alpha release) and if you're happy with your software then there is no reason to switch.  As some others have alluded to, the grass isn't always greener on the other side."

usenet,3d30mb,mc747,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:22:48 2015 UTC,It was quite some time ago and I lost interest nor do I have time to mess with it so I don't recall. Script errors if I recall.   Maybe again some day but I have bigger issues to deal with these days.
usenet,3d30mb,djgizmo,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:59:46 2015 UTC,"I started out with sabnzb+ and even though it had a lot going for it in terms of a lot of good config options. Even with just one thing downloading, I found the main UI slow to respond. It was a nightmare if it had 20 in the queue. (Surprisingly, though, it barely uses any resources. It's comparable to nzbget for me.)  I switched over to nzbget after a while. The speeds were the same. Sonarr took care of post-processing and sorting because I kept finding the scripts finicky and often not working at all (a problem I never had with sabnzb+). With Sonarr (and occasionally filebot) helping out I could forgive nzbget for the scripts not working for me, because the UI was great and fast.   However, down the line my downloads kept disappearing from the queue and I'd have to start entirely from scratch again since I was never able to find a solution. Whereas sabnzbd+ has a restore queue function in cases of technical hiccoughs.   I just switched back over to nabnzbd+ since nzbget started acting strange and only downloading at 1kb/s regardless of what ports I used. SAB started at my full speed and hasn't dwindled.  There are some small differences where I prefer SAB over Get. Things like download statistics displayed without having to go and manually check; seeing which severs pull the most (or maybe I haven't figured out how in Get); api key like mentioned by boran_blok; easier file handling/post-processing."

I am currently paying 10/month for Usernetserver so saving 20 bucks seems reasonable even if its just the same level of service.

The only changes I made were to remove markdown formatting. For example: on line 686 I modified body = '## %s ##' % self.nzbname to body = '%s' % self.nzbname, but I customized this only because Pushover doesn’t parse markdown and it just shows ## Download.Name.S01E01.HDTV-rlsgroup ##.   On line 716 ' * Download Size: %.2f MB' % stats['download_size_mb'] I removed the asterisk. I did that as well for “download time,” “transfer speed,” etc.  I’m not sure, but I think Pushover supports HTML. I hope this helps a bit. :)"

The first thing I'd try is setting the ""incomplete"" folder as a subfolder to your watched folder, and set it up as a named category. AFAIK you can't just set up multiple watched folders without the additional ones being categories. My guess is this it'd work to get things downloaded, but it'll probably screw up any other automatic processing from Sickbeard, CP, Sonarr, etc.  Setting up some sort of task scheduler like /u/sureguy said is probably the best way to avoid issues if you're already using categories (or using the same move/processing if these downloads are always the same category anyway)."

In that case, you're probably best off just getting a second usenet provider, and then setting up dedicated routes for each usenet provider. ie giganews would go over your comcast connection, and use newshosting or whoever on your fiber connection...

If you can you can create a static route for the IP of giganews with next-hop to your first connection and create an other static route for the ip from newsbin with a next-hop to your 2nd uplink.

CPU / memory should not a problem.  Spots are a very nice alternative and cost far less resources.

usenet,3ckkfq,BogativeRob,6,Wed Jul 8 17:09:58 2015 UTC,"Unless you are on a Black Friday deal then you are probably better off with a different provider.  NewsDemon's ""unlimited"" has an invisible cap and once you go over it then you run the risk of being cut off.  As harveyharhar says there is lots of discussion on this sub regarding ND and their cancelling or losing of accounts.  If you want true unlimited then you are better off with a provider than one of their resellers (NewsDemon resells Highwinds).  UsenetServer, Newshosting, Easynews, Supernews and Astraweb are all providers (owned and run by the backbone owner) and have unlimited accounts available for $10 or less per month.  If you are on a Black Friday deal then abuse that account while you can and move on when they finally do terminate it."
usenet,3ckkfq,FlickFreak,2,Wed Jul 8 18:55:04 2015 UTC,"Sorry but that is wrong.  UsenetServer, Newshosting and Easynews are all providers, not third party resellers.  They are owned and operated directly by Highwinds (putting them in the same category as a tier 1 provider like Giganews or Astraweb) and are not subject to the same invisible limitations that a Highwinds reseller (such as NewsDemon or Newsgroupdirect) would be.  Supernews as well is a provider that is wholly owned and operated by Giganews themselves and are not reselling the service as a third party.  Because those 4 and Astraweb are not bound by third party resale agreements they can and do offer truly unlimited service without any invisible caps.  You could also buy from Giganews (Tier 1), Eweka (Highwinds), Tweaknews (Highwinds) and XS News (Tier 1) who are also owned and/or operated by the backbone provider."
usenet,3ckkfq,FlickFreak,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:22:02 2015 UTC,"Sorry but that is wrong. UsenetServer, Newshosting and Easynews are all providers, not third party resellers   Incorrect.  The businesses named haven't been independent providers by the strictest definition in roughly 10 years.  Highwinds is the provider, and the businesses you listed are more or less subsidiaries offering services off of Highwinds storage platforms, which can be consolidated over time for efficiency and cost reduction synergies.  Once your traffic passes onto Highwinds network, it can be routed internally over private fiber to any of Highwinds global datacenters. Highwinds employees are the only ones that could verify where their NNTP operations are located and currently structured.  Example:  Easynews was a NNTP pioneer with base operations out of Phoenix, AZ.   Easynews sold out to Highwinds around sept. 2006.  Highwinds still maintains some datacenter operations out of Phoenix, but there is no guarantee that current Easynews services are being provided from that location.  Similarly, there is no guarantee that easynews, newshosting, usenetserver, etc are still running off independent and isolated storage platforms.    Highwinds does retain one US NNTP platform in Ashburn,VA (this is a huge east coast internet POP).  Highwinds also retains one NL NNTP platform hosted by Eweka in Amsterdam.  It is a strong possibility that Highwinds has another NNTP platform hosted in Frankfurt, Germany.  After that things get murkier.   As Google and a few other large CDN service providers have shown, it does not make a lot of financial sense to keep more than three sets of identical data online.  Maintaining petabytes is expensive.  Highwinds may acquire competing NNTP businesses and absorb storage platforms into their CDN operations, but this doesn't guarantee that hardware and storage can't be re-purposed for other hosting services.  So while you may be connecting to an IP assigned to Easynews, Newshosting, UsenetServer, Readnews, Tweaknews, or Base IP BV (assigned by ARIN & RIPE respectively) at some point Highwinds could decide to route traffic internally to any of its existing platforms.  Technical example:  news.easynews.com [69.16.179.38, 69.16.179.39]  This hostname resolves to two IP address assigned to AS29798 Newshosting, Ltd. registered now in Winter Park, FL (Highwinds global HQ).   Perform a traceroute on either IP and you'll see ICMP traffic passing over Highwinds Network Group (hwng.net)"
usenet,3ckkfq,anal_full_nelson,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:37:55 2015 UTC,Semantics.  I use the term provider to mean a usenet service that is owned and operated by the transit provider.  I use the term reseller to mean a third party service purchasing access to the transit providers network that is not owned or operated by the transit provider.  Seems pretty straight forward.  Would you prefer primary reseller vs secondary reseller?
usenet,3ckkfq,FlickFreak,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:01:21 2015 UTC,"1st party reseller or subsidiary is more accurate terminology as all of the companies named are no longer independently owned.  In some rare cases Highwinds businesses have continued to run NNTP storage platforms many years after being bought out (eweka, being the one primary example).  In Eweka's case it made sense, this acquisition was part of Highwinds initial expansion into Europe.  I'm not trying to grill you hard or be overly critical, rather I'm conveying that things aren't so clear and easily discerned when dealing with a large global CDN with shell companies, multiple datacenters, and POP (20+ for Highwinds).  Over time it becomes increasingly difficult to attribute systems directly to subsidiaries when identifiers are no longer unique."
usenet,3ckkfq,anal_full_nelson,1 point,Mon Jul 13 11:00:21 2015 UTC,"Agreed, especially once you start talking about the Highwinds network it becomes a complete and total mess to explain.    I just figured that for the everyday average usenet consumer too much detail might just confuse the situation and make purchasing usenet service even more confusing than it already is.    I understand that you were just trying to be as clear as possible but I was following the KISS method (Keep It Simple Stupid) and that doesn't lend itself to exhaustive detail very well.  No worries.  You are right though, subsidiary would probably be the more correct term to use."
usenet,3ckkfq,FlickFreak,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:32:13 2015 UTC,Yeah I had used giganews since the early 90s and just never branched out until about a year ago when the DMCAs got to be too much and realized I have been being raped on the cost the whole time.  Doing all of that research now.  I have a 150-180Mb/sec connection so that eliminated a couple of the smaller guys.
usenet,3ckkfq,FlickFreak,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:51:40 2015 UTC,"In terms of speed its hard to match the Highwinds and Giganews based services, especially if you're in North America.  The speeds they are capable of is just crazy.  Once you start getting into speeds like you have, 150+ Mbps, then you really have to consider if the provider can provide that speed.  I have 320 Mbps service and I have found that I can max out my connection pretty easily with Easynews or Supernews but I went with Easynews because they provide more connections.  I don't need them but its nice to have the flexibility.  NewsDemon is great in that they offer 50 connections and have tremendous speed, the problem is they haven't proven to be very friendly to customers that require loads of bandwidth on a regular basis.  As long as your account stays active they'll be great the problem is that one day without warning you are likely to find yourself without service."
usenet,3ckkfq,anal_full_nelson,3,Wed Jul 8 22:48:13 2015 UTC,"Surprised this needs to be reposted so frequently.    Unfortunately, the main thread about NewsDemon most people would point to and cite was deleted awhile back and no longer returns in search results.  Good summation by mod /u/stuff      [–]stufff mod/superuser 55 points 7 months ago*  So for anyone who is keeping score:  Newsdemon has a billing software ""bug"" that bills monthly users every 29 days instead of monthly  Their ""non-expiring"" block account expires after 1 year  Newsdemon users report that discounted ""unlimited"" accounts are speed capped  Newsdemon closes ""unlimited"" accounts when they use too much  and   suggest that heavy use of an unlimited account is a ToS violation  Newsdemon cancels user account for ""unknown abuse"" and refuses to explain why  And now this, they just happened to have all of their heavily discounted account information on the same billing system disk, that disk just happened to fail, they don't have a back up (of their fucking billing system!) so previously discounted users must sign up for a new plan.  Fuck Newsdemon. They are obviously running a fucking bait and switch operation where they offer heavy discounts and then cut off users who use the ""unlimited"" service too much or try to trick users into higher tier plans."

I manually search for the books, then once downloaded Calibre snags the file and moves it to a library stored in a Dropbox folder. Calibre acts as a server, so can be accessed by many apps (Nook, Kindle, MoonReader, Aldiko, etc.) from outside your network. It takes some elbow grease to get the outside connectivity working properly, but once running does quite a good job.   I am currently having some issues getting past my router, so I found CalibreBox, an Android app that can find and parse your Calibre library in Dropbox. CalibreBox downloads the book files to the device where the reader apps can then add them to their individual libraries. I'm pretty much exclusively Android, so this solution will work for me until I can find a better method.  I wish there was a Sonarr/Plex-type solution for books!"

Then if I simply dump it into the right season folder it picks it up when I click update series info and I can click rename which it does without a hitch.

If you have no credit on a block account this may let you continue without holding up the downloads.  Lately (5-10 years) fewer internet providers offer usenet access and there may be an alternative for retries in the new server priority list, I'm not sure.

It doesn't mean it's one party's ""fault"" although Comcast could certainly route you differently.  They just don't/won't because money.  You have not mentioned who you use, but I haven't seen the issue with Supernews and Comcast.  Do a traceroute while on and off the VPN to determine what backbones are being used.  In the server hosting world, using cheaper services means using Cogent, which can get congested going to Comcast.  As a result, I pay for better services which are more expensive but come with other internet backbones which don't get congested.  In the short term you should see if your VPN provider allows proxying, and use that for Usenet.  This is a quickie solution with minimal configuration and overhead.  You'd force the connection to their server, which has a better route to both."

usenet,3c1y42,ZebZ,0,Sat Jul 4 02:48:05 2015 UTC,"Actually, from my understanding, this topic (throttling) is an area where the difference between SSL and VPNs matters very much.  An SSL connection from point A to point B authenticates and encrypts all traffic between the 2 points, but an observer can still see that your machine (point A) is connected to an NNTP server (point B).  With a VPN, all your traffic (even non-usenet traffic) goes through the encrypted, authenticated tunnel, and it ""pops out"" at the VPN provider (could even be in another country) where it is then routed to the final destination.  With a VPN, an observer would just see a bunch of encrypted traffic between you & your VPN provider, even though some of it is going to google, to your NNTP server, to Amazon, etc. once it pops out.  Since throttling is based on the endpoint, it would be easy to throttle traffic going back & forth between you & Giganews, Supernews, etc.   Your ISP wouldn't know if you're downloading midget porn or a Linux distribution over SSL, but they could still block it.  (I've deliberately kept this simplified to get the key point across, without adding a bunch of details, notes and disclaimers.)"

usenet,3brj8r,z1lt0id,0,Thu Jul 2 17:43:30 2015 UTC,This is the correct answer.
usenet,3brj8r,SirAlalicious,2,Wed Jul 1 18:14:58 2015 UTC,Most people are using a 10m connection at least.  It's not a speed issue on our end.  Maybe they should put the money people spend on it towards beefier servers or more throughput like other indexers do.  From what I remember nzb geek use to be speedy before they changed their UI.  I could be wrong I guess but it seems like they gave all these nice features but dont have the hardware/speed to support them fully.
usenet,3brj8r,homingconcretedonkey,4,Thu Jul 2 17:38:34 2015 UTC,Their api is quite slow as well. Sometimes have issues with it on nzbmegasearch. Had to adjust timeout to 40 seconds
usenet,3brj8r,drakus72,3,Thu Jul 2 08:02:05 2015 UTC,"Of my 20+ indexers, the normal default of 12 seconds seems to be totally fine for all of them.  NZBGeek is the only one that struggles, and even with the default setting of 20 seconds specifically for ""slow"" indexers it fails almost every time.  I manually changed it to 30, but it still failed fairly often, so I broke down and bumped it to 45.  Think I'll try dropping it to 40 and see if I can save those extra 5 seconds.  The problem is Geek is a good indexer, and I want their results.  It's just a hassle to get them.  Anybody else and I would have ditched them ages ago."

usenet,3br3mf,ksryn,2,Wed Jul 1 17:38:38 2015 UTC,"Correct.  The issue is not what is named, but the context in which certain things are said. Openly discussing how you intend to break laws, or have broken laws is the primary issue.    Stating any of the following is against Rule #1 and Rule #5   ""I want to download [X movie] can you help me?""  ""I just downloaded [X tv show]..."" ""How can I successfully avoid DMCA and download X...?""   The clear difference with this thread is OP's intent isn't to break the law, but to test and observe how false positives impact removal of content which may in fact be legitimate.  /u/xxhdss performed a similar test months ago, and there was some resulting discussion and commentary based on that.  Clearly some contractors and rightsholders are overstepping.  Having a trademark on a narrow type of property does not equate to having license to perform takedowns where the only proof is random text matching without verification of content."

Poster asks ""Hey I'm looking for indexers with shows from XXX!"". Post gets removed per rule #1 though it only mentioned a content network name. Poster asks ""Hey what shows on XXX should I look out for so I can load them into Sonarr to watch later?"" Post gets removed per rule #1 even though they only mentioned a content network name (plus it's also not usenet-related). Poster asks ""Why do shows from XXX keep getting DMCA'd?"" Post gets removed b/c it contains specific content network name. Plus technically it might be a better discussion for /r/Piracy, considering they are really asking about copyright trolls & such.

usenet,3br3mf,ksryn,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:59:31 2015 UTC,"Basically, according the the mod mentioning any show name or content network name is against Rule #1.

Now, what would be even more interesting is how to structure this whole experiment. First of all, because of the restrictions imposed in this subreddit, I hope it is ok if I do this as a live experiment on www.theloadguru.com and publish the post here. Not to appear too pushy promoting my cute, little under-construction website, but I feel a simple blog article would be a good way to make this public, or do you think otherwise?  Secondly, I'm really thinking about how to structure the whole thing. I want to do it in several steps, each increasing in subtleness, to really see how well these bots are in only sending out legitimate takedown notices.   According to darylzero, it is mostly HD versions that get taken down, and not SDs. Can you guys confirm that? If anyone has more detailed information about what exactly gets taken down und how fast, you're very welcome to post this here.   To the mods: What exactly would you say can be discussed here, and what is pushing the boundaries a little too far?"
usenet,3br3mf,SirAlalicious,2,Wed Jul 1 18:23:14 2015 UTC,"I'm sure the bots are just running Newznab like every other indexer.  So if your posts are able to get indexed, they'll be removed, and if they aren't able to be indexed, then what's the point?  Also, if you do discover a scheme that avoids removals, won't publishing it on Reddit ensure that it immediately gets added to the filters, thus negating its usefulness?  Not that I'm against the idea of trying to figure this out, and I'd be curious to see your results, but I'm just stating the obvious."
usenet,3br3mf,SirAlalicious,6,Wed Jul 1 18:44:11 2015 UTC,"Actually, this is not the point of it. I want to show how takedowns can affect legitimate files, and possibly debunk the myth that every takedown necessarily means that the file was copyrighted.  These guys do as they please, and the results of my questions to Usenet providers show that no manual review takes place at all: http://theloadguru.com/usenet-email-answers/  This is unacceptable. The copyright mafia has gone too far, and it is time to collect some evidence of that, and be it only to create some reports on a few forums or blogs (or maybe it goes viral and forces them to, at least, answer some inconvenient questions).  If they only go through Newznab, so be it. Would still be an interesting result."

More or less Goldman communicates how difficult it is to fight off abuse of DMCA claims.  Although in some rare instances of incompetence, it is possible to win. [Giganews vs Perfect 10]    US law in particular has an absurdly high bar for holding parties that submit false claims accountable.  A party has to ""knowingly"" be submitting false claims.  Proving this in court is almost insurmountable, unless a complaint moves past a preliminary hearing, into discovery, and evidence is encountered [emails] that shows clear intent.

What is your block account or service tier? - 20 connections, I think thats what you mean, unlimited   A service tier is the type of package you paid for.  Some service tiers are advertised as limited/capped to a particular speed.   What server do you connect to? - Los Angeles, CA?   lol no..  You would respond with the server hostname you connected to  Example:  news.giganews.com"
usenet,3boqg2,mannibis,2,Wed Jul 1 20:05:51 2015 UTC,"Who is your provider? The peering (route) between you and the provider could be temporarily screwed up. I would give it a day or two to see if things go back to normal. If you really want to make sure, grab a trial with another provider and see what speeds you get.  You can also try changing the usenet provider port for shits and giggles. Most usenet providers offer various ports (i.e. 563, 443, 8080 for SSL)"

usenet,3bm99w,DarkCisum,1 point,Tue Jun 30 11:52:52 2015 UTC,Sometimes paypal play silly beggers with Usenet providers so it could be PayPal being PayPal or there just having big payment issues across every form  They will reply at some point but yeh their not the speediest

Now their billing company does not take CC's and will not accept my visa through Paypal. In the process now of finding another provider.  Here is the response from astraweb..... ""Multicards no longer accept credit cards. You can reactivate your account directly through the members page when it expires at the end of your billing period. Thank you.  Your E-mail is much appreciated.  Best Regards,""  Maybe when it expires I'll get a magic button that will fix everything ;)"

usenet,3bpdxm,TheJonesy,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:30:00 2015 UTC,"This + the money/effort issue. If you do not want to learn how to use torrents or usenet but enjoy music and series and are willing to pay for it: Netflix, Spotify etc. People who have kids also often use Netflix too because it is so easy and it entertains the kids for hours. Only very few friends (mainly geeks) use usenet. Torrents (and recently: Popcorn Time) are an easy method for less geeky folks and geeks who don't want to spend money."

usenet,3bklmd,drakus72,2,Tue Jun 30 11:16:05 2015 UTC,What's wrong with Ubuntu?
usenet,3bklmd,asdfasdafas,-5,Tue Jun 30 00:46:42 2015 UTC,"Canonical  it was originally forked/designed to be a windows replacement, not a server. Keep in mind, they had a whole release (I think it was Saucy) that had to be pulled due to security/bugs and didn't work for crap. to many bugs and security holes.  not a very good fork of Debian. IMO - a lazy man's OS. I guess I am just old school and prefer original Linux OS's compared to forks. Canonical reminds me of RedHat used to be good, but they strayed away from the original goals so they can make money instead of implementing options/software into the free, they only add to commercial side.   Now you understand why I do not like ubuntu."

usenet,3bki5k,stuart338,1 point,Mon Jun 29 23:44:40 2015 UTC,alright well atleast i know its not just me. Dog is having a rough couple of months
usenet,3bki5k,stamm1609,1 point,Mon Jun 29 23:47:02 2015 UTC,I suspect their troubles of the last couple of months are a precursor for all the indexers who's business model is pay once for lifetime membership. I'd be interested to know if those who've upgraded to the doggpass have experienced the same issues as their lifetime members?
usenet,3bki5k,Bent01,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:37:59 2015 UTC,Lifetime memberships won't work in the long run and they will either suddenly vanish or start asking for yearly subscriptions. Though lots of people refuse to understand this.
usenet,3bki5k,IP1238765,1 point,Wed Jul 1 08:44:48 2015 UTC,Shouldn't be a problem if they did the yearly half price promotion like the old newzbin did.
usenet,3bki5k,Bent01,1 point,Thu Jul 2 01:50:00 2015 UTC,I don't remember what they did. Renewals were half price? Might work. Otherwise you need to keep letting new people in.

usenet,3bfzet,TravelingTom,1 point,Sun Jun 28 23:39:18 2015 UTC,"For those of us with larger libraries (subjective of course), this would prevent us from having to (a) buy a ton of drives and possibly another NAS/server to back up the library,   If you care about your data, it should be backed up anyways. If it's worth something to you, you should have at least two copies. Aside from that, I like the idea.   I know Trakt gets a list of my collection, so maybe that could be used?   There is a way to set up a personal SQL database that has the same functionality of Trakt. However, I hate fucking around with databases because they make my brain hurt, so I didn't try very hard to get it working."
usenet,3bfzet,hooah212002,2,Sun Jun 28 22:14:15 2015 UTC,"I'm a big backup advocate (I back my PCs up to 2 locations), but at some point, it just becomes cost prohibitive for the majority of us. A Synology box with 7 6tb drives is already a pretty hefty investment for a ""home"" user. And online backup is just so slow :(  SQL terrifies me too, I feel you on that one!"

usenet,3be85r,TheCrach,2,Sun Jun 28 11:52:20 2015 UTC,I think binsearch does that but their retention is around the 1100 days mark.
usenet,3be85r,ksryn,1 point,Sun Jun 28 12:33:02 2015 UTC,Thanks for the suggestion but the retention is a little low and the sites search is rubbish imo.
usenet,3be85r,ksryn,1 point,Sun Jun 28 12:47:07 2015 UTC,"search is rubbish imo.   I guess it depends on what you're looking for. If you're only interested in a couple of groups, it might make sense to roll out your own solution (download the headers and nfos).  I suffer from NIH syndrome, so if I were to go down that path, I would build something on top of the NNTP library that is part of Apache Commons (Java). Guess other platforms must have similar facilities."
usenet,3be85r,ksryn,1 point,Sun Jun 28 13:00:50 2015 UTC,"Ok thank you, maybe if I explain a little more on what I'm trying to achieve you will be able to help.  The main reason I asked for another search engine with the option to search within the NFO is a problem with NZBClub's RSS. It doesn't include the searches within the NFO.  Do you know how I could include the NFO search with RSS."
usenet,3be85r,mannibis,1 point,Sun Jun 28 13:14:11 2015 UTC,"Do you know how I could include the NFO search with RSS.   I don't. Never felt the need for something like that.  If you're downloading something that a standard indexer would index, I would bet that the indexer is parsing the nfo as well to generate its results. There's a list of free indexers (and paid, if you really need it) available at /r/usenet/wiki/indexers.  If you're downloading something not indexed by the regular indexers, something like binsearch with the ability to search nfos should hopefully give you the results you're looking for."
usenet,3be85r,ksryn,1 point,Sun Jun 28 13:43:47 2015 UTC,"I'll check those indexers out, I wish I could search using just ""*"" on nzbclub but I'm guessing that would affect their search engine.  Another thing say something was named ""LR3294fjhfd834r32nbf8"" and it was a specific movie how much chance is their of one of these indexers having that movie. How do they figure out what it is.  Or do they just have that has a proper title."
usenet,3be85r,IL17A,1 point,Sun Jun 28 14:17:35 2015 UTC,"Indexers have various ways to de-obfuscate titles. Chances are, if there is an obfuscated post somewhere, there is also an indexer out there who has it decoded."
