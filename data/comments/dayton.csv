dayton,3e58ky,drfrev,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:33:10 2015 UTC,"I had a friend that lived there around 10 years ago.  Steeplechase was planning to pave the parking lot and supposedly notified all of it's tenants.  The day the parking lot was paved, Steeplechase hired a towing company to tow all the cars that were still parked in the parking lot. There were several cars still parked in the lots -- none of the tenants knew the parking lot was going to be paved that day.  The towing company, and Steeplechase, probably made a ton of money  -- or so my friend speculated.  My friend complained to the managers and they claimed that they gave everyone notification that this was happening two weeks in advance.  I've heard from others that have leased there that they do not maintain some of the apartments very well and they will try to take your deposit for things that were wrong with the apartment before the lease was signed.  I knew someone else that lived at Steeplechase and they had mold in the walls around the shower/bathtub in the bathroom.  This person never received their deposit.  I have always avoided Steeplechase, but I'm not sure if others have had experiences like the ones I have described -- the majority of tenants that lease from Steeplechase may have had a positive experience.  But, my impression was negative from what these people that lived at Steeplechase described."

The other friend didn't get their deposit back because the mold around the tub -- which supposedly happened while they lived at Steeplechase.  The maintenance people took a long time to fix that issue, too.  This person was slightly irresponsible and may have lost the deposit for another reason IMHO. They may have been angry they lost their deposit and they were trying to blame it on Steeplechase -- I can only speculate.  I have another friend that had to replace blinds that had been damaged supposedly, but my friend seemed to think the blinds were in good shape.  I have another friend that had no issues whatsoever (I texted them)."

It is a Virginia Battle Flag, flown by a couple hundred in Gen. Robert E. Lee's Northern Virginia Army (which is why it was chosen to be on the Dukes of Hazzard's General Lee).  As a side note, while the war may have been a lot about slaves, Gen. Lee opposed slavery, and he's the main guy who flew that flag.    So, actually, it is not a confederate flag that was flown by a man who viewed slavery as evil and morally wrong.  Sure, the Klan used it for some evil shit, but a lot of symbols that had no intention of being good or bad have been used like that.  Hell, the Klan also burned crosses, should we protest to have those removed from churches?  The cross was a torture device, then used as a symbol when killing people who were not Christian, then used as a symbol (for white protestant men) to burn while the Klan hung blacks.  Now it is a symbol for good, wholesome Christians (and some that want to persecute gays).  Right, wrong, who gives a shit.  You want to fly that flag, have fun.  Want to fly a Nazi flag, whatever floats your boat.  None of that shit affects my life, have at it.  I was against the S.C. Civil War memorial flying the flag because it was the wrong fucking flag. This is a Confederate Flag, and is what should have been flown there.  That'd be like flying the ""Don't Tread on Me"" Navy Jack over the WW2 memorial and saying that's the American flag they fought under.  No it's not, it's a battle flag that a lot of them didn't even know."

I usually got 1-5 MB/s below what i paid for. If you want TV, the Uverse guide/UI in general is far superior to what twc gives you.  Phone customer service for ATT is terrible. They try to upsell when you are cancelling your service. Its not a personnel issue, its policy.  Twc has a store at the dayton mall, so you dont have to deal with their phone support.   Ive used both companies twice over the past 8 years or so. Ive had good experiences and bad experiences with both. Neither are great, but i think twc has been the least painful to deal with.

My experience with SCP was horrible. I stopped by for an oil leak problem. At first they said they could not see any leak until I pointed fresh oil to them. Then they somehow worked on it made it leak even worse and lost some under-the-body covers of my truck. The worse thing about it is that they report WRONG mileage of my truck to carfax?!

I do all my own work but every now and then I'll use them. They charge fair market price IMO.   With that said in the last few years they've become big on preventive maintenance or notifying you of any flaws (lots of mechanics do this now to boost their income). It's in the gray area really. They'll (any preventive maintenance mechanic) tell you a belt has some cracks and needs replaced. In a perfect world they're right but in the real world a few cracks on a belt mean little to nothing. In a perfect world where money isn't an object you should replace it once it gets a few cracks and flush your transmission every time the fluid gets ""dirty."" But no one has the money for that and I don't know of anyone who has done everything they need for their car.   With all of that said they're not a rip off or a scam artist they're just preventive maintenance mechanics. Much like a doctor that wants you to get an MRI for light arm pain. They want to fix your problem but they also want to make money.

Weather has repeatedly delayed the effort of crews to ascend the antennas and replace the equipment but we are anticipating the signal for ABC 22 to be full-strength -- and even better than before -- by Thursday morning.  Work will continue on the FOX 45 tower, which was begun after ABC 22.  On Thursday, viewers using antennas should rescan their channels to find the new channel position for ABC 22. It will be moving from 51 to 18.  When the work is completed on the FOX tower, a second rescan will also be necessary.

For all the media hypes up 3d printed guns, it's mostly bullshit. I had about 30 hours in printing the liberator than another 5 cleaning the prints and assembling them.

dayton,3d3o6f,wizzo89,1 point,Mon Jul 13 07:05:45 2015 UTC,"With a few exceptions, there's not much hunting going on right now. But fall is where it's at. Deer hunting is a bit involved and you can sink a good amount of money into it and, if you happen to get a deer, you would have to take it to a butcher unless you want to figure out how to butcher one yourself.   So give upland game hunting a try (which is pheasant (mostly), quail, grouse, woodcock). All you really need is a hunting vest with some orange, a good pair of (ideally) waterproof boots, a shotgun, and, although it's not required really, some brush pants, as you're going to be crashing through some pretty high grass and blue jeans don't always do the trick. The ODNR releases pheasant in the fall for the express purpose of hunting. If you go on their website they have a schedule of where and when they release them. I've had a lot of luck around Spring Valley and Caesars Creek."
dayton,3d3o6f,Fimus86,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:27:36 2015 UTC,"So this is going to sound stupid but you're saying I can essentially wandering into the woods with a gun a go hunting (I know you need a permit and know about hunting seasons)? I guess my biggest question is how do you know where you can hunting? I've gone hiking and have seen ""No Hunting"" signs. I've never seen ""Hunting"" signs."
dayton,3d3o6f,Fimus86,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:19:00 2015 UTC,"You need to get a permit. Check out the ODNR website for details, but I'm not sure about the requirements since it has been twenty years since I took the test, so it may have changed. It cost $20 or something like that so it's pretty inexpensive.   As to where you can go hunting, you're probably not going to see any designated hunting zones around hiking trails. Depending on where you are, check out the websites for local state parks and state wildlife areas. Caesars Creek has a number of areas that permit hunting, mostly on the northern part of the lake. The Spring Valley wildlife area has a number of sites as well where I've had a lot of luck."

Regardless, I've always recommended that anyone contemplating going out on their own really owes it to themselves to check out their local SCORE Association chapter. The Service Corps of Retired Executives, which is pretty self-explanatory, is a nationwide non-profit that exists to provide mentoring relationships between experienced business leaders and those looking to start their own. They're a great resource for people serious enough about business that they're both willing to put the required time into research and planning and brave enough to seriously consider positive and negative feedback.

The streets in Dayton aren't even that bad, I've lived downtown and work downtown, and IMO the streets are pretty darn good, especially when compared to, say, Cleveland's roads. This isn't about that anyway, or about 'public safety'. It's only about the extra money they brought in, and who knows how that was really appropriated?   but officers will now be placed at locations where the traffic cameras are located.   There was another article on /r/news about this, and I spoke up and said that there should be officers present and they should be the ones writing the tickets. A camera can't tell if a driver is being a danger to other drivers...only a cop can."

dayton,3c9138,HeresTheThingGracie,1 point,Sat Jul 11 14:45:53 2015 UTC,"Well, that's kind of a loaded question.  Is it just you?  Or do you have kids?  Do you have hobbies or  night life that you would want to keep within driving range?  How do you feel about traffic?  Are you already a Dayton local - do you know about the sketchy winters we've been having?  How long/many miles of a commute are you willing to tolerate?  I ask this because if you've got kids and are willing to deal with surface street traffic, I'd recommend Kettering or Centerville...  you'd find a decent place on the high end of your range and could drive 725 into Miamisburg.    If it's just you and don't mind a drive, I'd suggest something north of 75, but then you'd have highway traffic and 75 construction to deal with.   If you have hobbies or something you'd like to stay in close distance to, that could be your decision point.  Springboro seems to be the most happening area South of Dayton, but like I said the traffic is lousy.  I'm not sure how much of a house you can get there, the whole supply/demand has real estate out of whack there right now.  Bellbrook isn't too far from there either, it's south of Centerville with a small town feel to it.  I could go on...  It's all about your tolerance to certain things and where you spend your time, honestly.  I live in Troy and the housing market here is bipolar.  My boyfriend owns his home, but he has 3 kids that are rapidly growing and we need more room...  to meet our requirements and stay within a decent distance of the kids' schools we're looking at a minimum of 150, closer to 200, unless we want to buy an older home and rehab/remodel it.  Troy has great schools though so that's why he's here."

dayton,3c138m,UCgirl,5,Fri Jul 3 23:26:02 2015 UTC,"I went to their page.  I copied the text as I'm too lazy to do a screen shot.   ----------Begin Quote ---------------  A group of physicians at Wright State University is enabling infamous late-term abortionist and partial-birth abortion pioneer Martin Haskell to keep his abortion facility in Dayton, Ohio open and running.  Ohio law requires all ambulatory surgical facilities to have a written transfer agreement with a nearby hospital. Dayton hospitals refuse to give Haskell such an agreement. However, Haskell has found a way to skirt this law through a contract with the Wright State Physicians Women’s Health Care group (WSPWHC).  Get more information on WSPWHC's collaboration with Haskell. WSPWHC and Haskell:  WSPWHC is comprised of the faculty members of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Wright State University Boonshoft School of Medicine. In November of 2013, WSPWHC signed a back-up physician service agreement with Haskell’s Women’s Med Center Dayton abortion facility. The people:  The following Wright State University Obstetrics and Gynecology professors are members of WSPWHC and complicit in Haskell’s killing of innocent children:  Janice M. Duke, M.D.  Josette D’Amato, D.O.  Sheela M. Barhan, M.D.  Michael Galloway, D.O.  G. Theodore Talbot, M.D.  Jerome L. Yaklic, M.D.  Steven R. Lindheim, M.D., M.M.M.  Wright State Physicians CEO Alan P. Marco (M.D., M.M.M.) is also a signatory to the contract between WSPWHC and Women’s Med Center Dayton.  The Plan: Expose Haskell's Enablers  We'll send letters to all the doctors of Wright State Physicians group asking them to sever their relationship with abortionist Haskell. See sample. We'll distribute postcards to expose these abortion enablers.See sample. We'll display signs on our ""Truth Truck"" in Dayton and neighborhoods where these doctors live. See samples.  ------------- End Quote ------------  Holy cow displaying the trucks where the docs live.  ""Mommy, why do you kill babies?"""
dayton,3c138m,UCgirl,6,Fri Jul 3 23:30:12 2015 UTC,Holy hell.  I saw this the other day and didn't realize it was focused at WSU.    I thought it was a bit graphic for general audiences.  I'm thinking 6-8 year old kids.  Old enough to read but not old enough to read that and see the gore.  They don't have the mental capacities to interpret it the same way as an adult.  Now if a parent chooses to take their kid to a protest and they see something like this - well - I feel bad for the kid.

Dayton is pretty intimate, so having a network of people that know people is damn near mandatory for getting your foot in the door anywhere around here (if you don't have all that much experience, that is).    Take the 6 month hit and intern your last semester of school, it will really help your career trajectory in the long run.    Alternatively, if you don't want to take the wise road, there's always reyrey."
dayton,3bzcgk,mahTV,5,Fri Jul 3 13:11:56 2015 UTC,"Former ReyRey employee here. (8 years) For all the Flac that ReyRey gets, they do offer one thing that most other employers in the area don't. Entry level positions that are truly entry level. I worked there from 2007-2015 (quit last month) and it is a great company for someone starting out. Most ""Entry Level"" jobs out there require 2-3 years experience or some other crap. I'm not a ReyRey fan boy, but I will say, they are a great stepping stone to a career. Just don't make your career there. Get 1-2 years experience and bounce. There is nothing there for lifers (myself included). Yes they don't pay well, but that's because they don't expect much. Their Data center ops and Network ops teams are basically just a team of people that watch for blinking lights and call someone when it blinks. BUT! When you put on your resume that you have 2 years experience in Data center operations or even network administration, that looks a hell of a lot better than 2 years at a factory that probably paid more."
dayton,3bzcgk,pantera975,-4,Fri Jul 3 17:02:03 2015 UTC,"Here's the thing: ReyRey is ALWAYS hiring for entry level IT.  I can't remember the last time they have not been.  That is not a good sign regarding the work environment and/or hiring practices.  I've applied there several times.  Twice I've taken that ridiculous test.  I assume I didn't pass it but they don't have the decency to tell you why they won't proceed with an application (probably SOP for most places, but still scummy).  Even assuming the test is passed, they have a cult-like health Nazi environment and have been known to turn people down for not looking like the perfect picture of health.  There are simply too many accounts of what goes on there to make it a palatable place to work at.  When you factor in their hiring process which is tailor designed to filter out people who aren't fresh out of high school, there's no chance."

dayton,3bzcgk,pantera975,3,Fri Jul 3 14:55:14 2015 UTC,The reason they pay that is because they hire non-developers and train them their way. They aren't too fond of hiring someone with years of experience. I was a software engineer there for years and most of the people that came on to my team where people with very little to no programming experience at all. They want people that they can mold into their idea of a developer and not someone that already is set in their ways. Last person I saw that got hired into SWE was a musician that never programmed a day in his life. But their test said he was a good match for being a programmer so they put him in my team.

I've collaborated with the internship coordinator at my college, but beyond her giving me a few leads to some Cinci companies (which I never got a call or reply from), there's been nothing.  I'm willing to travel a bit since I'm already travelling as far as Mason to work as it is (the pay would have to be decent to compensate for gas and wear/tear on car).

Also a group of us are looking to put together a club/flying group and a few of the metro parks down south would make excellent flying spots.

dayton,3bu1ut,FishBoneFredd,-4,Thu Jul 2 18:50:34 2015 UTC,"""a lot"" is quite a stretch  Dayton has a handful of good restaurants, and maybe a dozen or so better than average restaurants."
dayton,3bu1ut,batjams,3,Thu Jul 2 19:48:15 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry you think that. Food is one of the great things of Dayton I enjoy, and craft beer is exploding along side it.  Everyone's tastes are different, but here are some of my my favorite non-franchise restaurants: Golden Nugget, Slyder's, Fat Backs, Old hickory, Elsa's (on Linden), Kettering Grill, Dublin Pub, China Cottage (on 48), Tank's (inconsistent), South Park Tavern...  Going into Centerville area you got Centerville Pizza and BBQ. This dude makes some serious food. Try anything chicken, ribs or pork, and he makes some mean subs and pizza (mushroom steak sub and BBQ pizza). Double Days is good, although a bit expensive, but they have a huge menu.  Franchise wise, BW3's on Wilmington is consistent. If you want something simple, Skyline on Kingsridge is the best. Submarine House on 728 is really good. Milano's by UD and 741 is decent, but sometimes inconsistent.   I know I'm forgetting a few, but I need to stop before I paint myself as a 600 pound man. I hope you try a suggestion that you enjoy."

I seek out new places to eat constantly and consider eating/dining/food to be my primary hobby and my life's greatest passion. I work in the restaurant industry, and have in some capacity or another for much past 16 years. I know Dayton and it's food scene quite well. The problem here is that people will look at a mediocre place with mediocre food and call it great because the bar is so incredibly low here. Sorry, Dayton isn't a great restaurant city. I wish it was, I really do."
dayton,3bu1ut,batjams,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:39:51 2015 UTC,"What are places that others may consider great here that you consider so mediocre? I have heard similar things from people, and when I mention even casual places like Shen's, Mixteca, Siam Pad Thai or CJ Chan's they've rarely been. I have as well traveled a great deal, and when I travel I try to experience both the ""best"" places and the most off the grid hole in the walls, and still consider the options here in Dayton to be fantastic overall for a city it's size. Yes, it's not New York or Chicago, but I would not say it's mediocre by any stretch comparatively."
dayton,3bu1ut,millionslivio,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:40:21 2015 UTC,"I've been to all the places you just mentioned except Shen's... and mostly because I've heard pretty poor reviews about Shen's from people I consider to have good taste. I won't let that keep me from going eventually, but my cravings for americanized Chinese foods don't come around often.  Those places are all good for their style relative to the area, but only Taqueria Mixteca is actually what I would think of as ""good"" if you picked it up and moved it to another city of equal or greater size.  People talk up old stodgy restaurants here that serve ancient food to people with ancient tastes. Pine Club, Paragon Club, Oakwood Club... ok, they're stuck in the 80's.   We don't have any fine dining restaurants left here.  Like I said: There are a few rather good locally owned upscale restaurants... easily less than a dozen.   I admit that I was exaggerating when it comes to ""ethnic"" restaurants and holes in the wall. We do have some of those, and some of them are quite solid... but most are just so-so if you compare them to places about an hour away. Often there is only one good or even passable version of a particular ethnic cuisine here. Very few times am I sitting and thinking about going out to dinner here when I don't just think ""it's just not worth wasting the money or the time"". That's because I don't have a lot of both and instead I wait until I can maximize my use of those resources on something that I think ranks as better than just ""Good I guess... for Dayton"""

Note the beautiful large houses that still dot the neighborhoods around the North Main/Salem avenue area, and also the first mall in Dayton (Salem) was built in that area of town as well, not to mention country clubs and high end retail.  There was a lot of community pride and money invested until the 1960's and ""white flight"" south and east to the newer more affluent suburbs that exploded in the mid 1960's."

For the past five years,  I've been doing home visits for low income clients and have found that the race division is true but that it's also a class division. There are lots of poor white people on the west side (drexel, college hill) and lots of poor black people on the east side (twin towers, linden heights). There are also parts of the west side that seem more white than black (Belmonte park).   My point was,  from this map,  many other cities seem just as divided.

Places geared towards industrial applications like Copp are an option but probably will just charge a lot and not help much.   The real problem usually, as you mentioned, are a lot of parallel hard surfaces and nothing aside from renovation solves that. Before considering additional acoustic treatment you need to evaluate whatever gear you currently have installed and make sure its presence isn't contributing to your problem. I can almost guarantee that if you had DMX/muzak/any jukebox company put their gear in there then it is making things worse. Not just because it's shitty equipment (it is) but because they're almost always pretty one-size-fits-all and don't take into account the room itself for position and placement.   If you want to PM me the name of the place I can probably stop in and take a look, if I haven't been there already. Always happy to see new places opening."

dayton,3b2fqf,pateras,3,Thu Jun 25 12:45:30 2015 UTC,Will someone explain exactly what this means? Does it mean if this thing passes even if people vote to legalize pot it won't be because this trumps it?
dayton,3b2fqf,ripperx95,22,Thu Jun 25 14:02:33 2015 UTC,"This is actually a really good thing.  Currently, the initiative is being sponsored by a few investors who up until this point have done everything in their power to fight against legalization. Now they realize the tide can't be turned away, so they wanna cash in on it. This bill would make so that ONLY these investors can sell or operate dispensaries.  The measure passed in the House essentially states that this business behavior constitutes a monopoly on the marijuana industry, as it sets up the potential for price fixing and business exclusion zones.  It does not exclude people from voting on subsequent marijuana measures, it means that the industry as described in this measure constitutes a monopoly, and thus the measure cannot be legally voted on.   Trust me, the current worded cannabis bill is bad news. You don't want these people controlling the business. Strike it down and hopefully next year someone will introduce a measure that will allow citizens to run the industry, instead of fatcats.  I just moved to Denver from Dayton, and it works really well here. I hope you guys can get the same deal."
dayton,3b2fqf,Servb0t,3,Thu Jun 25 14:18:25 2015 UTC,"Just curious, as I had the same question as ripper did, were you able to read the legislation anywhere?  I didn't see any mention of bill names in the article and I'd like to be able to take a look.  The wording of the article is pretty vague as to what the recently passed bill looks like, as well as the proposed ballot initiative."

dayton,3b2fqf,dermal_denticles,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:14:17 2015 UTC,Would the anti-pot issue have any effect on the Ohioans to end Prohibition bill proposed for 2016?
dayton,3b2fqf,TenaciousC89,2,Thu Jun 25 14:25:20 2015 UTC,"It shouldn't, because it looks like the 2016 bill would allow citizens (and not only investors) to grow, cultivate, and operate. The sheer scale of the market would make monopoly moot.  This already looks like a way better bill. Shame I didn't hear about it before leaving :("
dayton,3b2fqf,Servb0t,3,Thu Jun 25 14:32:07 2015 UTC,"Pretty much. The Responsible Ohio initiative is backed by corporate investors. This ""anti-pot measure"" is intended to block corporate interests from bringing forth amendments. So if the latter is passed, the former is rendered illegal.   As the article suggests, the RO amendment is written to the benefit of the corporate backers. Whereas in Colorado, pot revenue is taxed by the state, this amendment would let the investors controlling the 10 growing sites keep it for themselves.   As disappointing as it sounds, it might be better for the RO amendment to fail and a better option brought forth."
dayton,3b2fqf,benemal,1 point,Thu Jun 25 14:24:59 2015 UTC,"So, to put it simply the corporate backers will be getting a larger portion of any funds produce by pot sales than the state?"
dayton,3b2fqf,ripperx95,1 point,Thu Jun 25 15:29:00 2015 UTC,Basically it gives the legal ability to grow and sell marijuana to a hand full of people. Anyone else doing so would still be illegal.

dayton,3b2fqf,tks944,9,Thu Jun 25 15:04:14 2015 UTC,"Same. Picture if you will an alternate history in which alcohol prohibition ended the same way RO aims to end marijuana prohibition. Say goodbye to all your favorite microbreweries. Your choices are miller lite or bud lite, each for about $32 a six-pack and if you don't like it tough; Anheuser-Busch et al. have their own personal amendment in the Ohio constitution. But its ok because that protects consumers. If we let just any fly-by-night startup brew and sell beer, why, they'd probably put anti-freeze in it or something! There would be ABSOLUTELY NO WAY TO STOP THEM! AAAAHhh!! /sarcasm."
dayton,3b2fqf,casact921,2,Thu Jun 25 15:32:03 2015 UTC,Sadly our state gov is so inept they have to write backdoor ass saving legislation like this instead of taking a lead. Pot is going to end up like the casinos because they are too cowardly to put there names on legalizing legislation.
dayton,3b2fqf,Huegod,2,Thu Jun 25 14:28:29 2015 UTC,I think you are misinformed. This bill is specifically to prevent pot legalization to end up like casino legalization. It's an anti-monopoly bill. It has no language at all that addresses marijuana.
dayton,3b2fqf,casact921,3,Thu Jun 25 15:21:48 2015 UTC,No thats what I'm saying as well. My point is that instead of stepping up and writing proper legalizing legislation they sat back until they had to do this sad maneuvering. Which i think will fail because it will be painted as anti-pot instead of anti-monoply. If they'd taken the lead on this and gambling it might have been much better for the state.
dayton,3b2fqf,Huegod,5,Thu Jun 25 15:41:49 2015 UTC,"I still think this bill is a positive development. Would it be great if the legislature took a stand and passed humane bills that fixed what's wrong with our state? Yes. But given that politicians don't generally work that way, this is a good bill to force voter initiatives to focus on the issues instead of giving selected corporations competition-free markets in perpetuity."

dayton,3avcn0,Knhyqls,0,Tue Jun 23 20:19:21 2015 UTC,That's an insane price for one room and shared everything else. It honestly should be a third of everything you pay since there are three bedrooms. You're telling me you pay $1200 in rent and utilities every month?    Reason I'm saying this. There are plenty of one bedroom apartments around for this price without having to live with someone else. I for one had a 2 bedroom apartment in Kettering for $490. $40 more and only electricity as a utility and paid heat.   I'm only saying it because if you actually want roommates you should cut your price in half.

We're on a slight hill and the water had pooled up on our back porch then started to flow into the garage under the back door. It started to pool up towards the front of the garage until I opened the garage door and it flowed out down or driveway. We've been here for 13 months and have never seen it do that.
dayton,3aimi7,Laceyfrommeetup,11,Sat Jun 20 15:30:14 2015 UTC,"Whoever told you fireworks are mostly legal here was incorrect.  You must transport all fireworks purchased in Ohio out of the state within 48 hours of the purchase. The only items that can be used in Ohio are designated ""trick and novelty,"" which smoke, pop, and/or sparkle. In Ohio, use of 1.4g fireworks (fire crackers, bottle rockets, etc.) is illegal."
dayton,3aimi7,jezebelseven,5,Sat Jun 20 15:46:18 2015 UTC,"I should note, that that doesn't stop some people. Your neighbors might call the cops on you. A cop might drive by and see you. You might get a warning, you might get more, I suppose it depends on the cop. You might have neighbors who don't care. You might have neighbors who are setting them off, too. Not so much in September, though, and that might annoy more folks than normal (as well as being a bit of a beacon to passing cops).  I'm personally of the opinion to leave it to the professionals, since I had my yard catch fire one year from a neighbor who decided he'd be just fine. Some old folks in Proctorville died last year because a stray firework hit their roof and they didn't get out of the house in time when it went up in flames. Not to mention it freaks the fuck out of my pets, and I have to work early so I'd rather not hear it at midnight.  (Now, get offa my lawn)"
dayton,3aimi7,jezebelseven,0,Sat Jun 20 15:53:47 2015 UTC,"The funny thing is, the biggest fire hazard and the most dangerous 4th of July item is Sparklers.  It's a metal stick that burns at 1200-2000 degrees F, that we then give to children.  You don't give a child a Bic lighter, because that would be dangerous, a lighter that has a small flame that burns at 1500-2000 degrees.  But a sparkler that burns as hot or hotter, throwing sparks in every direction, that's a child's toy on the 4th."
dayton,3aimi7,RandomUser72,5,Sat Jun 20 19:21:55 2015 UTC,"Mostly true, but, there are many cities in Ohio that it is legal to set off fireworks, actual fireworks.  The problem is, you have to have a permit, and to get a permit, you have to have insurance, and that shit is costly.  But, if you stay outside larger cities and more in the country, no one really cares.  If you do decide to do that, don't waste your money at Phantom or TNT, go to Richmond and hit up Shelton's, very first exit off I-70 across the Indiana border.  They have the rule that you must transport the fireworks out of the state within 48hrs, but the front door is actually in Ohio while the checkout lines are in Indiana, so you will go across state lines just by leaving the store.  Phantom is decent, but they're too far away from Dayton area.  TNT is in Drexel, they are overpriced and sell junk, mostly crap like smoke bombs, black cats and other junk.  At Shelton, they have that junk too, but they have massive amounts of aerials like mortars, rockets, and cakes.  Plus they have a deal where you spend certain amounts and you get a percentage back in credit to spend on more fireworks.   Spend up to $149 receive 10% more in free merchandise. Spend $150-199 receive 15% more in free merchandise. Spend $200-499 receive 20% more free merchandise. Spend $500-999 receive 25% more free merchandise.   My family pools money together for a huge show, usually around $800 or so, end up with over $1000 worth of stuff to light up the sky for a good 45 minutes to an hour."
dayton,3aimi7,RandomUser72,7,Sat Jun 20 16:35:58 2015 UTC,"Not much more than sparklers, pop-its, and glow worms are legal in Ohio, but the law so completely ignored on Independence Day that it mainly serves as an excuse to stop you if you annoy your neighbors or as an add on charge in case you do something stupid.

Vic thought delivery was the future and Marion disagreed. I know less about Ron's but I do know the pizza tastes pretty damn good."

I was incredulous when I took my wife to Marions for the first time and she told me it was ""just ok"".  I had spent the whole drive to Dayton telling her how it was the best thing in the history of anything.  Of course, she's from Cincy and is a devout La Rosa's girl. And the worst part is my son doesn't like Marions either.  But you summed it up perfectly, whenever I eat there it's a fond memory of eating there as a kid with my grandparents and extended family."

But while there are foods I grew up with that I enjoy more for the nostalgia of the experience than for the actual flavor, I'm pretty sure none of them are as objectively nasty as Marion's.

Dayton is hiring for a full time collections representative! Also, did you apply at Costco?  Do you have ANY IDEA what they start out making?  Oh my gosh.  I have a friend that works at the new location in Sugarcreek.  She says she likes it. I worked for Krogers for a little bit as a cashier.  HATED paying union dues, as I was there for just less than a year, and was NEVER part of the union.  ::grumble grumble:: They called me once at home to say ""Your drawer is short $10.00"" When I came in the next day, the manager that was above the idiot who called me, told me my drawer was fine.  He just didn't count a roll of quarters that was in the drawer. Don't take the drama home with you!  It's in every job! Clock out, and don't think about it! Since that idiot manager had been a dick to me previously, the next time I saw him, I said ""I'd like my apology in writing, please."" WOW HE WAS PISSED. But I wasn't getting paid to talk to him when he called me.  He shouldn't have called me at home.  I was never a manager there. That was a jerk thing for him to do.  Calling me at home to see if I might be able to come in early is one thing, but calling me with the purpose of inquiring why I thought I was short?  I wasn't even the only person who ran on that register that day! Like I said.  I could let all that get to me, and get all pent up about it, but I let it go, because I knew I didn't have anything to hide.  I KNOW I didn't take it.  I don't steal.  So I had nothing to worry about. Whatever job you get, there's always going to be stressful moments.  The key is not letting those moments bother you.  When you let them get under your skin, it's way too easy to walk home with those problems, and way way to easy to get frustrated about your work life.  Listen to some awesome tunes on your way home, and when you get home, tell yourself that everything that happened at work no longer matters!  :D  :D  :D  :D  GOOD LUCK!    EDIT: Right now, I'm working what most people would think is a REALLY stressful job counting money (for another major grocery chain).  I'm never stressed out.  I just don't take it home with me.  I have 2 million other things to worry about.  That stress can just stay at work.  Before leaving I open my locker, throw my nametag in in there, and then shove my hand in my pockets and dig out all the ""stress"" and throw it in there with my nametag, and lock my locker back up so it can't follow me home!  HAHA!  Little tricks like that, anything that makes you laugh, or anything that makes you forget, help you to wash away that stress and worry.  You aren't being paid to take all those awful feelings home with you.  So leave it.  I feel like I'm beating a dead horse.  So I'll shut up now."

dayton,39z8i0,BumSkeeter,7,Tue Jun 16 00:02:44 2015 UTC,Water Street apartments has fiber thanks to Extra Mile Fiber.  They are looking to build out more but as far as I know they are only there at the moment. Edit: No fiber there yet but it is coming.
dayton,39z8i0,RonnieHasThePliers,3,Tue Jun 16 00:27:25 2015 UTC,"There is, at present, no real local availability for either fiber or 100Mb cable at the consumer level. Much has been made of the impending service at Water Street and a second nearby location, however thats future tense. Time Warner advertises the hell out of 100Mbs service but it's not anywhere nearby.  TW Business Class fiber is available in a lot of areas, or can be set up, depending on the area and just how serious you are about having that level of service. It varies from reasonable to $10000, depending on whats required for install."
dayton,39z8i0,M3Pilot,3,Tue Jun 16 03:37:30 2015 UTC,"I just got 50 Mbps service from Time Warner yesterday, after getting rid of cable.   Runs around $75 a month, and I was getting speeds around 55 Mbps last night."
dayton,39z8i0,Ericovich,2,Tue Jun 16 11:22:33 2015 UTC,"I think this is what I will be stuck with. I talked with a TWC rep today for the appt complex I was looking at. He seemed to think there were TWC fiber areas, he said he talked to ""some guy"" and apparently there are none. Quoted me the same price too.   It just sucks going from my 100mb connection to 50.."
dayton,39z8i0,Ericovich,1 point,Tue Jun 16 20:58:30 2015 UTC,I feel like I quit calling a drug dealer when I got rid of cable.   50mbps is pretty good as far as it goes around here.

dayton,39z8i0,insomnyuk,2,Tue Jun 16 21:35:45 2015 UTC,"I talked to a couple AT&T technicians about this and they have all told me that they have fiber out to pretty much all the colo boxes in many neighborhoods in Dayton, but from there it's all copper pretty much everywhere. They both told me there is one newer development in Beavercreek I think near the Beavercreek Municipal Golf Course where the whole neighborhood is wired for fiber. I'm not sure exactly which neighborhood though.  Also, in downtown Dayton there's a company called Datayard that basically resells ATT fiber lines in the area primarily for business. You'd be looking at minimum 300 bucks a month for the service. Ouch."
dayton,39z8i0,BoxcarHobo,3,Tue Jun 16 15:51:29 2015 UTC,There is no fiber to the best of my knowledge
dayton,39z8i0,microwavepetcarrier,3,Tue Jun 16 00:16:58 2015 UTC,There is definitely fiber in Dayton.
dayton,39z8i0,thisisnotaworkacct,3,Tue Jun 16 03:19:12 2015 UTC,Glad to know there is fiber 2 blocks from my house and the fastest speed I can get is 3 mb.
dayton,39z8i0,Ericovich,3,Tue Jun 16 13:26:31 2015 UTC,That map is fascinating.  Burkhardt Rd and Findlay Street? That would be LAST place in the city Id expect a fiber line.
dayton,39z8i0,jvoosh,2,Tue Jun 16 13:45:32 2015 UTC,"Those are undrrground trunk lines that likely follow the easiest/cheapest path through existing service tunnels. They're not meant to provide consumer/residential service directly, so they really don't care about what markets (neighborhoods) they pass through/near."
dayton,39z8i0,Ericovich,1 point,Tue Jun 16 20:51:52 2015 UTC,Are there like tunnels big enough to hold a person?  Because that sounds terrifying fun.
dayton,39z8i0,jvoosh,2,Tue Jun 16 20:58:51 2015 UTC,"Probably, same tunnels are used for electrical, telecom, steam (back in the day), etc.  Most of the really cool tunnels (actually meant for human use on a regular basis) are in the central downtown area."
dayton,39z8i0,microwavepetcarrier,2,Tue Jun 16 21:52:54 2015 UTC,"Im not saying you should...but there is definitely a network of tunnels large enough to walk through under Dayton. Mostly to deal with water. If you decide to explore, make sure there is NO rain the forecast for days and it hasn't rained in a week or so. Those tunnels are designed to deal with storm water, and you will die if you get caught down there during a downpour.  Seriously. We once walked from one of the tunnel ""entrances"" (exit really) on the river near UD, through a network of tunnels and ended up under the Sunoco at Wayne and Keowee.  There is also one near the Findlay St bridge."
dayton,39z8i0,Ericovich,1 point,Wed Jun 17 15:11:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Ive seen the tunnel entrances at Eastwood Park (the side facing Springfield Street).  Its very interesting to me. Im fascinated by Daytons engineering history, so to find old tunnels like that would be neat.   Ive traced quite a few of the old hydraulic canals that originated on Findlay St. at Dayton Hydraulic (now by where 1st St. Metal Salvage is) and used to crisscross the East Side."
dayton,39z8i0,microwavepetcarrier,2,Wed Jun 17 15:22:01 2015 UTC,"A friend of mine went to the Dept of Public Works and asked for maps of the storm drainage system.  He told them he was an engineering student at UD and was working on a project.  They bent over backwards and gave him maps of the storm drains, the old steam tunnels, and the sewers too.  We could get from South Park to the old power plant without going above ground.  These were pre-9/11 days though...not sure you could just ask for maps like that these days."
dayton,39z8i0,microwavepetcarrier,2,Wed Jun 17 20:50:01 2015 UTC,Yep. I'm stuck using DSL. ewww.
dayton,39z8i0,thisisnotaworkacct,2,Tue Jun 16 13:44:55 2015 UTC,Tell me about it.  Half the time the line doesn't even work right.
dayton,39z8i0,jvoosh,1 point,Tue Jun 16 13:47:45 2015 UTC,"Page lists Enterprise and Carrier sales, are you sure this company offers residential/consumer fiber?  Strictly speaking, I'm sure there's fiber-opric transmission lines all over Dayton - I know Oakwood installed a fiber backbone that connects all the city infrastructure a while back - but OP is looking for fiber to his home, which is very different."
dayton,39z8i0,microwavepetcarrier,2,Tue Jun 16 20:48:59 2015 UTC,"Sorry to confuse.  I didnt mean to imply there was residental fiber available, just that the fiber exists. We can't have it.  My new house (haven't moved in yet) maxes out at 15mb DSL but practically backs up to one of these existing fiber lines."
dayton,39z8i0,jvoosh,2,Wed Jun 17 01:20:10 2015 UTC,"No worries. Sounds like we're ultimately saying the same thing.  The fact that fibertech advertises any access AND lists  a contact for Carrier Sales could be seen as at the very least encouraging.  It would at least seem that they were open to providing access to a ""last-mile"" provider/isp who would be willing and able to provide residential service (and have a business model to support doing so*).  *In Dayton, especially the closer you get to Downtown (where many of the lines are located) this is the core problem.  I'm sure there are fiber-optic lines literally all over the place, the trick is finding a market that is both geographically accessible AND includes enough buyers to justify the considerable last-mile build out expense. Without a generous wealthy benefactor (like the folks from Mountain View) to underwrite that cost, I suspect the vast majority of Dayton residents are several years away from gigabit/fiber internet."
dayton,39z8i0,microwavepetcarrier,2,Wed Jun 17 01:42:49 2015 UTC,"If you build it, they will come.  Damn catch 22s."

dayton,39z8i0,thisisnotaworkacct,2,Tue Jun 16 02:52:39 2015 UTC,I disagree.
dayton,39z8i0,colmusstard,3,Tue Jun 16 13:26:57 2015 UTC,It's only useful for people that regularly do large file transfers. Most consumers benefit much more from lower latency than they do greater bandwidth above 15mbps

It sounds like you're having difficulty differentiating between sex and nudity. Nudist resorts/clubs are entirely non-sexual environments (well, most are, some are actually adult oriented, and thus obviously 18+). Anyone doing anything overtly sexual would be thrown out immediately, most likely with the police being called.  Think of it like a public pool or rec center. Any behavior (except taking off your clothes) that is not acceptable there is also not acceptable in a nudist setting. As such, people are comfortable bringing their families, because nothing sexual or inappropriate is taking place. Of course, children must be supervised by their parents at all times, but that's true (or at least it should be) of any public setting.  I'd recommend going. I think you'll see immediately that it's really not an issue. Within 5 minutes you forget that everyone is naked, and it's just like a day at the pool (except you don't have to deal with a wet swimsuit)."

Salem Mall is where my Great Aunt worked, at the jewelry counter in Lazerus, so we would frequent the mall around the holidays for my Dad or Grandpa to pick up gifts for their ladies (this was the early 80's).    I remember that terracotta tiled fountain in the center, it seemed so huge when I was a kid, begging for pennies from my parents to add one more shining glimmer of copper to the bottom.    The entrance closest to the movie theater was unique, so many round light globes, it's also where I saw my first theater film (The Goonies), when I was six years old.  They would keep the mall beautifully decorated around the holidays, with a huge, two-story Christmas tree, present boxes, and poinsettias at the center.  I also recall the downfall of the Salem mall, the area had declined considerably in the early 90's, and stores were coming and going, it seemed the stores changed with every visit, save for the big three.  Finally the shooting that occurred in the mall (maybe 98?) hammered the final nail into the coffin of the once great Salem Mall."

In the 90's I would take my son there shopping early on Saturday.  I made the mistake of going with my husband and son on a Saturday night and there were roaming groups of unsupervised kids just looking to start problems with each other or other patrons.  It was loud and there was a lot of pushing and shoving. My husband was very uncomfortable and we left the mall very quickly.  This was about the time the military guy, at the mall with his family, was attacked and severely beaten by a group of teens.

This was back in the mid-80's so the photos were all very rough and grainy and definitely homemade, no professional photography.  There were lots of polaroids.  No kids....thank goodness.  I remember sifting through them as I sat in my locked car wondering what in the world I had found.  I didn't recognize any of the people or the locations.  I give them to my husband when I got home, not sure what he did with them.  If I remember I'll ask him."
dayton,39t6vw,mission_transition,5,Mon Jun 15 04:06:55 2015 UTC,"I remember going there as a kid when it was packed and all the stores were occupied. My friend's father owned the McDonald's franchise there and we would go there for free fries when I was a teenager. I remember buying cassettes in the music store there, and later CD's.  Then our parents told us it was dangerous and we weren't allowed to go there, we had to go to Fairfield Commons or the Dayton Mall if we wanted to shop."

dayton,39t6vw,CincyRed81,6,Mon Jun 15 09:28:32 2015 UTC,"I grew up on Shiloh Springs by Main Street. Let me warm up my typing fingers...  NRM had an awesome selection of music and magazines, and that guy who I think had a flat top and could identify just about any song if you hummed a few notes.  The electro-globes in Spencers were freaking awesome.   Walden Books was on the lower level by the fountain. They were later bought out by Borders, and then that went under. There was a kiosk across the walkway from them with a bunch of pamphlets and such from a local Catholic church or organization.  If you exited the book store and went left, there would be a wing to the left side. The most important thing about that side was Babbages, which, for you young whippersnappers, was pretty much a 1980's GameStop. We had to return a few games back to back because they didn't work, and the guy at the counter was a douche and said they didn't support piracy. Douche.  I'm pretty sure there was a pet store right next to Babbages in the late 80s / early 90s, too.   The candy store was well stocked. The tobacconist shop smelled incredible and sold pewter and crystal wizard-and-dragon stuff. I don't like coffee, but the coffee shop smelled like cherry vanilla coffee happiness, and they made a mean hot chocolate. KB Toys was across the hall. I don't remember much of interest either up or down the escalator past KB, although there was another music store for a time on the lower level.   The food court had sky lights and plants and birds would get in. In the end, Mark Pi's and the soul food place outlasted McDonalds, and rightfully so - Mark Pi's chicken wings and the soul food place's ribs were phenomenal.   Man Alive had those Orbitz drinks in the window.   Seeing Rush Hour in the theater was a bad idea.   The official party line is that the mall suffered due to competition from the Dayton and Fairfield malls, but that's only half the story. It kept getting more and more dangerous; I remember one gang fight where the mall had to be evacuated due to the amount of pepper spray used to break it up. Shortly thereafter, the shooting happened and someone died. It was a ghost town after that; no one wants to shop at the murder mall. With no shoppers, businesses packed up as their leases expired. The owners then jacked up the rates on the remaining businesses to make up the loss, and that was the nail in the coffin. A DMV corner office and ""4 Brothas Apparel"" was not enough to keep the mall standing, and now it's a parking lot."

dayton,39t6vw,PointPruven,2,Mon Jun 15 02:42:20 2015 UTC,"Salem Mall actually plays a large part into my childhood. We weren't the richest but at least every other week or so we would go there and buy some pretzels and popcorn, check out the fountain and stores. We would sometimes eat lunch in the food court. I saw most of movies growing up there in their cinema.   I did all of my school shopping there for shoes, clothes etc. If I got money and Toys-R-Us didn't have what I wanted. I would go over to KB Toys and pay their high prices.   When I got older, it I went there for books from the book stores, clothes, over priced $27 CDs, and video games. I went there to hang out with friends and grab food from the food court. I did that up until the police built a sub station inside the mall and if you were under 18 and went near a guard rail on the 2nd floor a security guard or cop would come storming at you screaming to get away from the guard rail and ask you were your parent was.  It was a lot of fun and has a lot of great memories for me, up  until it started falling into disrepair. Then it just became a sad skeleton of itself and I think the last time I went was 2000 or 2001 for some school shoes. The entire second floor of the mall was closed off, and empty. 80% of the first floor was closed off and empty (even the fountain was empty) you really couldn't go into the mall anymore. You had to get into the mall from Sears and there was only 3 stores open and they were all shoe stores. There wasn't any shoes I liked, so I left and never went back. Not long after that it closed down. Now it's torn down as everyone knows and Trotwood can't decide what they're going to do to the property."

dayton,39t6vw,CincyRed81,2,Mon Jun 15 09:26:58 2015 UTC,"My mom lived close enough that I ended up walking to the mall frequently as a teenager.  We lived north, so the best path was cutting through the farm on Westbrook.    I remember the original layout, then the various additions and expansions over the years.  I still sort of miss funway-freeway, but that was long gone before the mall started dying.  My friends and I climbed onto the roof a few times, which was kind of neat.    Frozen yogurt at chickfila or ice cream at baskin robbins, a visit to the bookstore (or stores, later on), browse the record shop, play a few video games, and generally just wander around.    Because I was there so frequently in the 80's the downturn was visible long before the stores left.  The people walking around weren't as friendly, it never seemed clean anymore.  The ""kids looking for trouble"" stuff started in earnest about a year after the JC Penny addition, which brought the food court.     My most vivid memory is my mom leaving me at a puppet show and not coming back for an hour after it ended.  I was prolly 5 or 6.  She wasn't good with time, and my sisters kept her busy shopping.  I got picked up by some wandering teen-aged girls, and delivered to security.  She was embarrassed, but I stayed pretty bitter about that for a long time.    Children's palace was next door, then toys-r-us showed up across salem.  There was also a wilkie's books a little further up salem, if I had time to kill I would walk the grand circuit before heading home."
dayton,39t6vw,Halafax,2,Mon Jun 15 16:59:58 2015 UTC,"We would go there every Sunday. It was the 60’s so pretty much the original layout and stores. There was a small diner in the back of the store just outside of Sears that you could enter from the outside or thru the back of the store who’s name I can’t remember. It must have been inexpensive because we ate there often. Every Christmas we went to see the giant tree, Santa, elves and fake snow. The place was packed. My favorite stores were East East, in the corner by Waldenbooks, of course Waldenbooks, and Spencers Gifts. My least favorite was Elder-Beerman. I was young and could hear the silent alarm they never turned off. My mother would have to drag me past the front of the store by my arm. Man that alarm hurt my head. As the years went on I began to go there to see films with friends. I took my mother there to see Star Wars the week it came out. She loved it. She liked the restaurant just to the right of the main entrance. What was it’s name? When I was married they added the new two storied section and it really breathed new life in the old place for a bit. It was a good place to shop. Then I moved away and did not come back for years. Finally one day I read it was dying and decided to go see for myself. That was sad. There were two stores open in the whole mall. The new addition was completely boarded off. There was however one restaurant left in the food court so I ate there and thought of the hundreds of times I had been to this mall."

It was great working there, JCP had plenty of young sales associates and a lot of hung out after work. Toward the end of my tenure there was when it started getting rough on Saturday evenings in the food court area. Guys in the middle of summer wearing long, heavy trench coats, lots of fights, etc. I was a young white guy who was dating a beautiful young black girl at the time and we were getting harassed constantly when we went to lunch together.  Anyway, for the most part I enjoyed working there and hanging out."

There are some good parks with hiking trails in the area. Some of my favorites:  For longer hikes:  Glen Helen, John Bryant/Clifton Gorge in Yellow Springs, Sugarcreek metropark, Germantown metropark, Twin Creek metropark  Smaller parks with shorter trails, but nice: Charleston Falls Preserve, Cox Arboretum, Grant Park  Further away but worth a visit: Hocking Hills, Fort Hill"

dayton,39s6u5,tks944,2,Sun Jun 14 14:37:16 2015 UTC,"As for public transportation in that area, those are considered county wide busses and don't run as frequently as the city wide ones (just in Dayton).  Honestly, you'd be better off driving around there."

I'll say from my time here without a car.... ehhhhh... You probably will need it more than you would like. I don't have any recommendations for parks, but I'm guessing you're health conscious since you like biking, hiking, etc.? You should try Christopher's Restaurant in Kettering. It's really affordable and tasty :D"
dayton,39s6u5,bunnylover726,2,Sun Jun 14 17:02:46 2015 UTC,"You shouldn't have much trouble finding cheap apartments for less than $600. I know Creekwood Apartments (in Kettering/Beavercreek area) have one-bedroom places for under $500, water included. They aren't huge places, but if you're alone, they're more than enough.  I can't help much for public transportation, but I frequently see a lot of people in the Kettering area biking (I personally go running). There is a bus schedule that goes around the city, but the Dayton area really isn't that difficult to maneuver and you can pretty much drive anywhere within 20 minutes.  There are a lot of great parks in the area. Just Google Dayton Metroparks, and they'll give you a list. While some of them have biking trails, my personal favorite is the Narrows (only has hiking/running/walking paths), although it's about 5 miles outside of the city.   I'm not too sure about camping in the area, but there's definitely camping spots within an hour or two drive from Dayton. Hocking Hills near Columbus has great campgrounds and great cabins, and you can't really beat the hiking there."

Nearby are Costco, Aldi, Whole Foods, Fresh Thyme and Earth Fare (like a mini Whole Foods), and it has an excellent library system. Centerville is a newer neighborhood than Kettering.

dayton,39r3w4,WhosThatGirl_ItsRPSG,1 point,Thu Jun 18 06:50:27 2015 UTC,"Sounds like you have a handful, an adolescent dog can be pretty rough to live with sometimes, and training is certainly important.  The only thing I can stress is positive reinforcement...again and again.  Leash training for a dog that is not accustomed to it can be tough, but again, positive reinforcement.  Have some treats on hand, and try the leash out in an environment the dog is already comfortable in (the living room), just put the leash on, and reward good behavior, then try walking around a bit, and again, reward.  Never let the dog treat the leash as a toy, he needs to see that it is a tool, and when it is on, it is time to work.  The Dayton Dog Training Club may be a good resource for you, beginner classes (the dog, not the human) are typically informal, more about socialization for the dog, but very helpful.  I've never dealt with the Club, but they've been around for quite some time, have a solid reputation, and are in your neck of the woods.    Dogs have short attention spans, try to keep your training sessions short, but frequent.  Again.  Positive reinforcement.  I can't stress that enough."

I wanted a dog with a fairly lengthy life span, something that was trainable, but not too crazy (working dogs can be a real pain in the butt, if they don't get the proper attention and challenges), and something that can still work a sleeve (Schutzhund).  Unfortunately, it can be tricky to find a reputable breeder for such a popular breed, this is where homework comes in (or google-fu).    Standard Poodles can be some pretty awesome dogs, they are incredibly intelligent (this can be a problem), have a strong working drive, if bred correctly, and are great with kids.  They can be in the ""medium"" size, and are one of the most popular ""hypo-allergenic"" dogs out there.  It would be a solid choice.  I would suggest searching for ""water fowl dog breeders"" and checking out the poodles from that pool.  I find that folks who breed dogs for working applications are NOT puppy mills, and have a genuine love for the breed and all of their characteristics.

Each location has three sites with each individual site large enough for two small backpacking tents. These are primitive backcountry style campsites that can support up to four to six hikers per site depending on the style of the tent. Each location also has an outhouse along with a common area for cooking and hanging out that support the three individual campsites.    Cedar Ridge campsites Pine Ridge campsites Oak Ridge campsites    A backpacking permit is required for all overnight use of the backcountry. Permits for all overnight backcountry use must be obtained by calling 937-277-4374. More info on permitting. Maximum stay per camp (Oak Ridge, Cedar Ridge, Pine Ridge) is two nights.

They always did nice things for their staff like many corporate companies.  I did billing entry and to be honest - I was working from 8am to midnight between both jobs. I was wore out and not keeping up with their stats so I elected to quit. One thing you want to get clear is the hour situation. If I had known that my request to leave by 10 or 11 wasn't suitable for their needs I would have possibly thought about working elsewhere.   They never said I was doing bad but I did get coached several times - and I'm a bit of a perfectionist so when I realized that my lack of sleep was causing a lack of attention to detail I knew I wasn't a good fit for the company.  If it were my only job I feel I would have performed better."

I recently looked at them for a marketing position, unfortunately they have a very one-size-fits-all application process where everyone needs to do a lengthy application through their third-party HR portal. They DO have a lot of employees in many states and that industry has enormous turnover with people moving between companies, so thats probably the reason, but for managerial and upper-level positions that you're looking for additional info on it can be a bit off-putting."

He had nothing but good things to say about the company when I signed up, and I've come to mostly agree. My opinions so far:  As a company, they are a great employer. They offered a fair salary (even taking the profit sharing out of the equation) and, from what I understand, the benefits are good (I opted out of most benefits at the moment). I feel that they do actually care about the people working there. I don't know exactly what the other departments are like to work in, but they seem to be good (I know one person in HR who likes their job, and I haven't heard anything negative).  The only negative things I've come across relate to friction around specific people, but it's very minimal compared to previous jobs; it definitely doesn't put me off enough to polish up my resume.  Overall: Yes, I'd recommend pursuing the job. As /u/M3Pilot pointed out, the application sucks. IMHO it's still worth taking a shot."

dayton,38fxxf,psjoe96,1 point,Thu Jun 11 14:06:01 2015 UTC,"I recently moved twice within in Dayton. First was the initial move to Dayton. I got a 3 month lease 1 bedroom apartment for $599 per month(normal price is lower for a bigger lease). Then I found the apartment I want, and moved in a week before the first lease ended. To me this was a great idea, because it left a little breathing room for finding the ideal apartment and finding one available. Also incase something didn't workout with my new job, I wouldn't be out too much money. I like the dayton towers, but the only issue I had was large furniture. They do no have a freight elevator. Luckily I only had one piece of furniture that was too big, a 90 inch sofa.  This problem can be over come, but you will have to hire the elevator company to literally lower the elevator one floor, so your furniture would go on top of the elevator. I was told the cost would be $250 dollar or so. One way, so if you move out, you have to pay it again. Besides this, I love my place, and I have no regrets.  I just moved into Dayton Towers which is incredibly close to the Oregon. You can see the ""Dub Pub"" and one end of the Oregon from building.  Two other options are St.Clair Lofts and The Cannery Lofts.   Stonehenge Apartments 3 month lease, this was not downtown. Dayton Towers  St. Clair Lofts Parking costs $30-50 per month.

They did not break anything, thankfully, but I was very afraid they would.  They were cheap, which is why we used them, but if you can afford it, go somewhere else. IMO, their name says it all. They seemed to be two random guys (not professional movers) that learned to drive a truck."

dayton,383swl,jcole0502,7,Mon Jun 1 17:29:40 2015 UTC,"Okay, well good news.  Dayton is hella cheap and you can get an apartment for (sometimes significantly) less than $700 no matter where you go.  Other than that, feel free to checkout the Where do I live thread, as well as the subreddit's history for a lot of good information!  If you want to live close to downtown, I highly recommend St. Anne's Hill or South Park...both are super community driven, affordable neighborhoods within walking distance of downtown.  The Oregon District is even closer, and slightly nicer, but is going to be more expensive as well.   Kettering and Beavercreek are much more suburban in feel, but are very nice places to live."
dayton,383swl,Houndie,3,Mon Jun 1 18:36:35 2015 UTC,"I agree with Houndie on this one.  I've lived in two different houses in South Park, for like 2.5-3.5 years total and I really like the area. It's really close to the Oregon & it doesn't take too long to get to Beavercreek, The Greene, or 75.  South Park is really hodge-podge, so depending on exactly where you live, you might be right next to some millennial hipster-types, trashy folks, an abandoned house, or a really nice historic house.  St. Anne's hill is kinda like a more...consistently nice version of South Park. It's really close to SP, so it's just as close to all the other stuff I mentioned before, just a little more up-scale. I'd guess that since you don't have the same kind of chance of getting stuck next to an abandoned building or trashy neighbors the rent will probably be a little higher there, but seeing as how Dayton was rated one of the most affordable cities it shouldn't be too hard to find something that fits your budget. I'd probably prefer living in SAH if I was going to be staying in Dyt/ looking for another place here, it's just really pretty and it feels like being in Savannah or something (lots of greenery, gardens, & cute/ colorful houses.)  Good luck! Feel free to message me if you have any questions.  edit: forgot stuff"

dayton,383swl,Kelsflyerud,1 point,Mon Jun 1 19:23:20 2015 UTC,I'd say your best bet would probably be somewhere downtown like St Annes or Southpark(as suggested) or Kettering. I'd much rather go out drinking/socializing downtown over the Greene. I'd honestly probably rather spend time in the Fairfield Commons area over the Greene. Beavercreek is a nice area though and takes 5-10 minutes to get downtown.

It's so early, and all that's come out of any candidate really is a bunch of political buzz words. There's nothing to get behind so far. Why should I, both as an American citizen and a resident of the state of Ohio, care enough this far in advance to do anything to assist a candidate who's already getting plenty of attention?  Edit: To anyone who downvoted me, I provided more specific feedback."
dayton,37rf94,Ildri4,5,Fri May 29 20:45:17 2015 UTC,"There's nothing to get behind so far.  ...all that's come out of any candidate really is a bunch of political buzz words.    I agree that there aren't too many details yet, but Sanders' values are quite clear and uncompromising.  The issues he says he's mainly interested in are income and wealth inequality, getting big money out of politics, and climate change.  Actions he's taken on these issues are listed in the second two links, his values on the first can be seen from his voting record.  He'll only succeed with a significant grass-roots effort behind him, and if he gets that he won't need to take campaign money with compromising strings attached.   It's so early... Why should I, both as an American citizen and a resident of the state of Ohio, care enough this far in advance to do anything to assist a candidate who's already getting plenty of attention?   Attention will not win him the election, and it's not as far in advance as you think.  See /u/throwaway's post about this.  There are many unregistered potential voters who would be very excited to see a president as progressive as Sanders take power, and about 9 months left to register them before the Ohio primary on March 15 next year.  Developing a team of people who go door-to-door to shepherd the voter registration applications and then absentee ballots of poor and disenfranchised people is a way Sanders could win, really the only way I imagine, since Clinton will always be able to outspend him.  But it will take time and a lot of work for it to make a difference.   To anyone who downvoted me, I provided more specific feedback.   Yes, and it is welcome. :-)"

Sitz case, the Court found that the intrusion and inconvenience of to individuals who are stopped is outweighed by the government’s interest in curbing drunk driving.  https://www.ohiobar.org/ForPublic/Resources/LawYouCanUse/Pages/LawYouCanUse-582.aspx"

They are remarkably inefficient.  ""What’s more is the enormous expense of sobriety checkpoints. While each roving patrol costs roughly $300, it can cost over $10,000 per checkpoint. Such excessive costs are difficult to justify considering the dire straits of many state and local government budgets.""  They are a waste of money. Stop wasting money so people can feel safer when a roving patrol would do more for much less.

Also, you could call local real estate offices and I'm sure you could find an agent to help you find something if you can't yourself. Just a disclaimer, I live in the city of Dayton and nowhere near Eaton so I wouldn't be the one to help you personally, despite my username"

dayton,37oiou,ThinkZink-Realtor,1 point,Fri May 29 05:00:46 2015 UTC,"Agents get paid by the landlord/seller in 90%+ of transactions, but for renting they usually get paid first month's rent by the landlord unless they don't cooperate then they will go to you for the money.  They can only get money from you if you sign an exclusive right to agency.  I would do that because it makes them work for you harder because then they know they will get paid no matter what and you are a serious renter and will put you on the highest priority.  Like I said, you most likely won't have to pay them at all, but just to be sure give a call to a company and ask for an agent/call an agent you know of and confirm how they would be reimbursed for helping you!  Hope that helps!"

dayton,37oiou,Chouette4u,1 point,Fri May 29 05:12:06 2015 UTC,"I strongly disagree with the advice that you should sign an exclusive right to agency.  It's controversial enough if you were buying, and I think it's pretty ridiculous if you're just looking to rent.  You will lock yourself into having a responsibility to pay your agent, and there is really NO NEED to do that in this area (places like NYC/NJ are different).     Agents get paid by the landlord/seller in 90%+ of transactions   That is really only true for a property that is listed on the MLS and the landlord already has their own contract with an agent.  What happens if you find a place on Craigslist or decide to rent in an apartment complex?  They sure won't be paying any commission toward your agent, so your agent would come after you for whatever amount is in your contract.    And as a renter, the service a real estate agent provides is not worth ~1 month's rent.  I have rented using an agent before (paid for by the landlord), and it was not any different from when I rented through Craigslist other than we signed the lease in the agent's office and didn't actually meet the landlords until after we moved in.  It's not at all like buying a house when having your own agent is a lot more important."

dayton,37nrjq,peppermint_red,1 point,Sun May 31 18:15:05 2015 UTC,So I know it's not Threading and that many people do threading because they are afraid of waxing. But if you've never been waxed before and you're afraid because other people have told you it's the WORST -- try it. I've done both in the past and the best thing I can compare it to is the difference between pulling off a bandaid  owowowow sloooooowwwwwwlllllyyy and YOUCH pulling it all off at once. A skilled person at waxing won't even make the youch that bad. Amanda Miniard at Salon Ventures in Beavercreek and Sherry down at Tudor Day spa are both incredibly good aestheticians and very skilled at waxing with great results and little pain. :)

dayton,37dzwq,MajesticFlounder,5,Tue May 26 22:57:22 2015 UTC,We had a discussion last week about Troy here.
dayton,37dzwq,SoupCanNort,3,Tue May 26 23:06:10 2015 UTC,"Welcome! Best bet for someone in your situation would be to live right downtown. Specifically someplace like Webster Station (so Cannery, etc.), the Oregon District, St. Anne's Hill, or South Park would be best. Nothing between Troy and downtown meets your criteria that well, although Tipp City, Troy, and Vandalia are all nice places in their own ways. Troy may be a suitable alternative if you really wanted a small town with some YPs (looks like you don't), Tipp would not."
dayton,37dzwq,OHKID,1 point,Wed May 27 02:12:10 2015 UTC,"If living within walking distance of bars and restaurants is important do as others have suggested and find a place downtown. Otherwise there are some nice quieter apartments in fairborn, even quieter and I think the best option is Tipp city. If you're not sure about an area feel free to message me I have a lot of opinions."
dayton,37dzwq,GreenPlasticJim,1 point,Wed May 27 05:56:36 2015 UTC,I agree with the suggestions of living downtown. Other than than you would need to be north of town in the Englewood/Clayton or Vandalia areas.
dayton,37dzwq,s010sdc,0,Thu May 28 14:33:24 2015 UTC,"Where is the job exactly?  I'd avoid living in Troy if the job is on the south side if Dayton, that rush hour traffic can be rough.  What kind of places are you look for?  Bars?  Trails?  Been here since 1997.  I'm 27 now.  Any questions hit me up!"
dayton,37dzwq,iam8up,-3,Wed May 27 04:17:05 2015 UTC,"I would personally suggest, if you have the credit for it, to go for a house and pay a mortgage and that will be a much better investment in your future than paying rent in an apartment, you could even get roomates to cover the mortgage payment.  As my dad always said, ""your whole life you will be paying a mortgage, it just depends if you are paying it for yourself or someone else."""
dayton,37dzwq,ThinkZink-Realtor,2,Wed May 27 00:47:58 2015 UTC,"Since OP is new to the area, it would probably be a better idea to rent for awhile to get a feel for the area. It's a lot easier to move out of an apartment in a neighborhood you don't like than to sell a house.  Sounds like close to Dayton would be good for you since you want to be near the city. I really like the South Park and St. Anne's neighborhoods. They're charming and a good bargain as long as you don't mind living in an ""up and coming neighborhood."" The Oregon District is more established (more amenities, more expensive, great neighborhood) and also near/in downtown. I'd try padmapper to see what's available in those areas. Some of the neighborhood pages also list rentals.  Troy is a nice town if that's what you're into, but I don't know much about housing options there."
dayton,37dzwq,Epic_Mile,2,Wed May 27 03:09:43 2015 UTC,"I would also suggest renting first.  Troy property has held pretty well, mortgages are awfully expensive when compared to rentals."
dayton,37dzwq,iam8up,0,Wed May 27 04:16:41 2015 UTC,"What a wonderful suggestion. Dayton is, of course, a continually expanding and growing city, with lots and lots of businesses moving in, and I'm sure that the housing market will skyrocket."
dayton,37dzwq,Unoriginal_Man,1 point,Wed May 27 19:55:31 2015 UTC,"... Sarcasm aside, housing prices in Dayton are the best they have ever been for buyers recently and that, with the combined interest rates, make it a good place to purchase.

That's just how I have learned it over the years, that it is almost always better to own than to rent.  But I agree I don't know enough about OP or their situation to really determine what would be best for them. It was just a suggestion, and a very disliked one at that."

dayton,3779oe,eng_pencil_jockey,1 point,Mon Jun 8 15:31:23 2015 UTC,"Believe me, I gave them many chances. While it seems trivial, repeated over the course of years makes it frustrating. When you only have so long for lunch and you call it in only to wait for 10-15 minutes while they make your food and then NEVER give you plasticware without having to ask for it, I quit going. Also, make sure they actually include your salad dressing with a lunch meal. One of these things, if not all, happened every time I went there during lunch.  Great food though. If you have time to wait, it is worth it. I just stopped going at lunch when I am on a tighter timeframe."

dayton,36s886,SoupCanNort,2,Thu May 21 19:42:21 2015 UTC,"Judging from your username, I'd recommend Toxic Brew and Warped Wing Brewery. They're within a couple of miles of each other. Jay's Seafood is a landmark, and they've got brews on tap from both aforementioned breweries. Jay's and Toxic are both in the Oregon District (bars, restaurants, other attractions)."
dayton,36s886,Hootinger,1 point,Thu May 21 22:06:23 2015 UTC,"For apartments, there are several options in Troy, but if your income can handle it, I would suggest living in the apartments downtown(shit holes can be rented for $400, while some NICE newly renovated lofts are around $1000), or on the West side of Town (two story, two bedroom townhouses ran about $700).  The Troy Park is nice, close to downtown, and on the levee.  Nice place to jog or just get some air.  Remember though, Dayton is only half an hour away from Troy, and has some really great night life.  The Oregon District (the hotspot in our area) and the Masque (best club, but may not be for you) are fairly close together, if you want to venture out of the Troy comfort zone."

dayton,36s886,BrosenkranzKeef,6,Fri May 22 11:27:30 2015 UTC,"I spent my mid 20's in Troy, lived downtown ON the square, loved every minute of it.  Rode my bike to work, walked to the local watering holes (several bars in the Downtown area), and had no issues meeting people of all kinds.    Hiking in Miami County is pretty decent (Brukner Nature Center), but not great, I was more into motorcycles and bicycles (great bike trails), live music was always to be had at at least two of the bars (Leaf and Vine, and the Brewery, although I hear that the Brewery live music scene is now dead).  Troy has a fairly vibrant cast of characters in your age range, as it employees younger people at both Honda, Hobart, and even brings in students to the Hobart Wielding School.  If you are coming from a larger city (population over 250k), you may find the activities Troy has to offer disappointing, but speaking for a small, middle class community, Troy has quite a bit to offer for its size.  The places I would suggest for you to go to meet like minded people would be:  Leaf and Vine (Bar and Cigar room, often live music)  Sakai Japanese Bistro (Best damned sushi I've had in a long time)  Club 55 Bistro (may have changed since I've been there, but nice)  Submarine House (Best subs, and good beer)  Dunaway's Pub (My old stomping ground, but it's a dive bar.)  I currently live South of Troy, but am always looking for homes in the area, as it is a good town, schools are decent (I'm old), and much safer than places closer to Dayton.  The only thing I would warn you about, are the Troy Police.  This town suffers from the Small Town Mentality, there is a fairly large police force, for nothing really to do than give young people a hard time.  Keep your nose clean, and you'll have no issues, get in to trouble once or twice, and they know you.  Source:  I lived in Troy from 2000-2011."
dayton,36s886,captainpixystick,2,Fri May 22 02:14:38 2015 UTC,This is all great information. I will try to quickly check out a lot of these places today when I visit. I am not terribly worried about getting to know the police but that is good to know. Thanks a lot for your response.

I know a bunch of early-to-mid 20s people from there and they've all had sex with each other at some point and they seem perfectly okay with that.  Got a job in Troy? Fine. But don't live there or you'll hate yourself. Especially if you're single."

The best on pricing I can say is expect $100+ visit if it's all around checkup plus shots (not sure what you need). If your pet hasn't had a checkup in 3 years I would expect more. I've never really heard of a ""cheap"" vet, just different levels of expensive.   I take my pets there because of the vets. Dr. Beck is especially awesome vet."

She charged me $80 for a full visit with shots and then threw in some heartguard for free that had been donated for a dog my size to her shelter but they didnt take large dogs so she gave it to me.

dayton,36efrb,kpyle,1 point,Tue May 19 03:54:25 2015 UTC,I've always used North Main Animal Clinic. I dunno how there prices compare to others around in the mainly cause they are really close to me.   Also since your dog hasn't been to a vet for a while as another poster has said you'll be paying easily 100+ on the visit. Also by I think Montgomery county law your dog has to have current rabies and distemper vaccines I think.
dayton,36efrb,Jinzodefiler,-1,Thu May 21 07:03:14 2015 UTC,"I use Banfield, specifically the one inside the Petsmart on Feedwire, I don't find their prices to be too bad compared to my last vet (Bigger Road Vet Clinic). They generally can get people in within a few days.   You could also try a mobile vet clinic - I've recently seen them at Jack's and Tractor Supply, both in Beavercreek. Maybe one of those places has another event coming up soon?"

Don't stop and look at everything on your way to the back wall, just walk relatively quickly to the very back of the museum.  This'll give you a sense of scale for just how big the museum is and will help you budget your time for how you want to spend it while you're in there.  By doing this, you'll prevent yourself spending all day in the first hangar and then realizing when it's time to head out, you still have two more hangars to go.  You could spend weeks in there and still not read everything in all the exhibits."

They have plans to relocate the Presidential and Research hangers to the museum itself, but I don't know when it is supposed to happen.  If you enjoy the rest of the museum, it will be worth a return trip to see the new (to you) exhibits.  Song's Sushi is located nearby and has really good Korean cuisine.  They also have Japanese dishes and sushi, but I've only ever had the Korean."
dayton,364bhf,Senbonbanana,2,Sat May 16 12:22:02 2015 UTC,"The 4th hanger is currently under construction. They'll close the existing presidential and research exhibit (it's on base) sometime in October and begin moving the planes. They plan to have the new exhibit open in the spring of next year.  They were running limited shuttle service to the on-base exhibits, but they've stopped that for the time being due to the current elevated threat level. When the threat level goes back down, they'll probably resume tours."

What I find funniest about her comments is her saying that her opinion posts are all on her personal page, not her business page.  She doesn't seem to understand that she has her posts set to public, not friends or even friends of friends.  And she also says, ""If everything I say is so annoying to you feel free to de-friend me and if our different views force you to boycott my business that is fine with me as well.""  It's not like I'm going to do background checks on the owner of any business I'm thinking of patronizing, but there are enough places out there that if I know the owner's crazy, I can go somewhere else."

We haven't officially announced it yet, but next month but I (and the other board members in our organization) are starting a weekly swing dance at Ned Peppers Bar in the oregon district on Tuesday evenings, starting at the end of June.  You don't need to know how to dance or have a partner, there'll be a free beginner lesson before the dance and everyone rotates partners.  Obviously we haven't started yet so it's hard to determine who will show up, but the venue is 21+ and swing dancing today tends to be the most popular with those in their 20s and 30s so it's right in the age range you're looking for.  Anyway if you're a thing you're interested keep your eyes open here...I'll make a more official announcement about it when we get our website up and running.  If this is something that interests you, let me know and I can let you know about other swing events in the greater area as well.  Badass example of swing dancing for those interested"

They host a bookdrive each year with the goal of collecting 5 books for each elementary school student in Dayton Public Schools. The average child loses 2.5 months of literacy skills if they don't read over the summer, and many Dayton public school students don't have access to books at home, and might not have a caretaker who can bring them to the library due to work, etc. The idea is that by sending each child home with a few books for the summer (that they pick out at a book fair held in the school the last week of classes, so that they are excited about reading them), they will experience less of this regression. They prefer new books, but will take very gently used books.   http://learntoearndayton.org/bookdrive/"

Descend older trade in and the people that work they all ride. I don't know if you just want a mountain bike to ride or if you want trail riding, but if it the latter then you should check out MVMBA on fb. They have volunteer days to make new trails and clean up the rest sometime people are not nice. And I know a couple of people that ride out there, and if you would go and volunteer at one of there clean up days. Don't be blatant about it, it will come up in conversations about what type of bike you ride, and say you are looking to get one. You can figure out the rest. Other then that craigslist."

dayton,35313g,CCwind,16,Wed May 6 18:05:01 2015 UTC,"In general, no, there is not a rampant crime problem, although it depends on where you go.  The North-west side of dayton (Five Oaks, University Row, etc) is where the worst part of town is, so I would tentatively avoid that part of town.  Any gang activity that occurs typically is up there, although if you're REALLY strapped for money you can get by as long as you don't stick your nose into other people's business.  Non-historic east Dayton is fairly poor, but there's not really much violent crime that goes on out there, just a drug deal or two.  Your best bet is one of the historic districts in Dayton, or downtown proper.  Those are typically the safest part of Dayton proper.  These are also the most expensive part of Dayton as well, but housing costs there are still laughable compare to the costs of housing in the rest of the US.  I've lived in St. Anne's Hill Historic District for 4 years with absolutely no problems, and like it a whole lot."
dayton,35313g,Houndie,8,Wed May 6 18:30:19 2015 UTC,"The North-west side of dayton (Five Oaks, University Row, etc) is where the worst part of town is   I grew up in the west side and pretty much the rule of thumb is if you mind your business and don't mess with people you'll be fine. Those areas have high crime because it's where the drug dealers hang out; namely the projects. The actual home owners around the west side and around the projects tend to respect their homes and neighbors.   My parents have a home in west Dayton for 40 years now and never been broken into or stolen from nor have their cars.   However, a friend 6 blocks over growing up had nothing but trouble but he was always missing with drugs and the like. With that said there's not really ""gang"" activity on the west side. It's a bunch of late teens and mid-20 year old dudes that think they can make it hustling drugs in life. As far as the drugs go the only thing around the west side really is Weed and crack. West Side people don't mess with coke or Heroin like East and North does.  Granted it's not a beautiful part of town but in reality it's only bad if you mess around with the wrong people. I go to mow my parents yard the neighbors say hi to me, there's kids playing on the street. Violent crime isn't happening all day long. If you do hear gun shots or sirens or the like it's normally on the weekends. Granted the gun shots are rare, the sirens not so much. Sirens don't always indicted violence. A lot of time it's older people on government income who can't afford to live any where else. They fall or need help and call the police.  If someone said ""you can have a free home on the east, north or west side of Dayton and not in one of the outlying greater area towns"". I would take the west side before the North or East side. IME the North and East side have just as much crime however, the neighbors don't respect each other.   I've seen and known neighbors on those sides of town to go to a pot luck dinner at their neighbors house and while there they're scoping the place out to break into it later in the week.   Most of my friends are from the West Side. Once I moved out and started working with and making friends from other sides of town. East Side residing people always seem to have their home or car getting broken into seemingly weekly.   People on the west side tend to respect their neighbors and their neighbors property. East and North side people tend to only be worried about themselves. Basically, the west is the best of the below average."

dayton,35313g,MrsFunner,2,Wed May 6 19:18:37 2015 UTC,"I agree that the suburban hospitals are best for emergency care in most cases. Miami Valley does have a level one trauma center,  though,  and routinely accepts transfers from all the other area hospitals for trauma care.  So for a major emergency,  you wouldn't find me anywhere else.  We also choose to have our son there because of their level three NICU."
dayton,35313g,NoBoobsAcctForWork,4,Sat May 16 04:31:57 2015 UTC,Health care is the second or third biggest employer in the area. Miami Valley is typically fantastic.
dayton,35313g,katelveis,2,Wed May 6 20:10:46 2015 UTC,I think the only one badly rated is Greene Memorial. Kettering and Premier hospitals I'd say are about equal in quality though I've only ever been to Premier because my mom works for them.
dayton,35313g,inclassfuckingbored,6,Wed May 6 23:24:26 2015 UTC,The pissing match between the two major hc providers has resulted in pretty good quality hospitals in the area. I'd throw the hospital in Springfield in as the other poorly rated facility.
dayton,35313g,borhoi,5,Wed May 6 23:45:33 2015 UTC,Work for one of the two. Can confirm there is a gigantic pissing match.
dayton,35313g,clutchied,1 point,Thu May 7 02:15:15 2015 UTC,I also work for one of the two.  It's quite amusing.  Although it has resulted in massive availability of healthcare.
dayton,35313g,borhoi,3,Thu May 7 04:17:21 2015 UTC,Oh yeah absolutely. I think our heavy focus on patient experience stems directly from being in competition with another provider so it's great for the community.
dayton,35313g,dermal_denticles,3,Thu May 7 04:21:44 2015 UTC,A search of the specialists I'm searching for shows there are lots of options at the hospitals you mentioned.  Looks like it shouldn't be a problem.
dayton,35313g,dermal_denticles,3,Wed May 6 23:36:32 2015 UTC,"Basically what Houndie said.  There are decent parts and less decent parts, but on the whole I think it's a good place to live.  Some neighborhoods are even on the upswing.  If you're curious about what people think of where they live, there's a link on the side bar that has a decent amount of comments.     If you want to live in a city, then you'll have some crime, but I wouldn't guess that Dayton's any worse than the average.  I too have lived here for years and have had zero problems with crime."

dayton,35313g,harnaldo,7,Fri May 8 01:38:59 2015 UTC,"You have to be careful which ""Dayton"" you're viewing statistics for.  Or which ""Dayton"" the makers of any given chart used as their source.  Technically, Dayton as a city name refers to downtown, parts of which are just as bad as everything you've ever heard... similar to pretty much any other bigger city.  If you mean ""the greater Dayton area"" then it's not nearly that bad.  The surrounding communities are all vastly lower crime, and I would recommend living in any of Beavercreek, Kettering, Centerville, or Bellbrook to my little sister or senior citizen mother.  (Don't live in Riverside, it's almost as bad as downtown.  Fairborn is kinda skeezy too.  Oakwood won't let you in unless you're descended directly from God but with more money.)"
dayton,35313g,ObscureCulturalMeme,6,Wed May 6 18:54:37 2015 UTC,Fairborn is patchy. Perfectly fine so long as you stick to the nicer areas.

dayton,35313g,suchacrisis,3,Thu May 7 17:25:55 2015 UTC,"Aside from the occasional property crime the residential areas in the core of downtown are very safe, the police presence is very strong... Additionally, the city has (whether fairly or not) pushed out the handful of bars and clubs in downtown that were associated with crime. Would I recommend walking in poorly lit alley areas or poking your nose around in abandoned structures at night? No (though I frequently wander along the riverscape area and trails at night and there isn't anything to be concerned about there), but should you be afraid to live in or patronize downtown, absolutely not. It's also not nearly as pricey as people make it out to be, especially when compared to housing in Beavercreek."
dayton,35313g,NoBoobsAcctForWork,1 point,Fri May 8 05:54:03 2015 UTC,"Even with Riverside it depends on which part. The city is so chopped up.

But yes, a lot of Riverside is to be avoided."

However, if you are used to suburbs like I have been all my life, the beggers are extremely jarring and annoying. They pretty much ruin the experience of wanting to just take a walk downtown. While most when you tell them no will leave you alone, they have these ridiculous stories that go on forever. One younger guy seemed pretty angry when I told him no and I was concerned for a minute, but nothing happened.  Just beware of that crap is all I am saying."

dayton,35313g,SpanishInfluenza,2,Wed May 6 23:28:46 2015 UTC,"There's actually not much to do in proper Dayton except visit the Oregon district which is a single street basically. Most of the things to do/see are in surrounding suburbs like the malls, theaters, restaurants, etc."
dayton,35313g,OHKID,1 point,Thu May 7 01:15:25 2015 UTC,Dayton and the surrounding burbs turn into festival madness from now til Fall.  You'll be traveling around for activities.
dayton,35313g,Jinzodefiler,1 point,Thu May 7 04:19:53 2015 UTC,"The reality is Dayton is a very small town and to get anywhere to do anything in any of the suburbs is only going to take you 10 to 15 minute drive to get downtown.   Where are you moving from what are you expecting out of your lifestyle there are a lot of ways any of us can help you find what part of Dayton would actually work best for you  don't rule out the suburbs in Dayton because they really are only 10-15 minutes outside of town,  I live in Columbus now which is just a little over an hour away from Dayton and I really miss Dayton.. There are things to do in every part of the community in Dayton."
dayton,35313g,jbs3600,0,Fri May 8 13:24:30 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, it's often the case that people live in the suburbs and stay in the suburbs for activities.  Don't get me wrong — there are some great things to do in Dayton.  But it remains a city whose economy has suffered greatly, and there isn't so much happening there that it is a consistent lure for those in the suburbs."
dayton,35313g,jbs3600,4,Thu May 7 00:01:25 2015 UTC,"I'll have to disagree. A lot of suburban people do stay in the suburbs, sure, but more and more are coming downtown frequently. They already have been coming in droves to the Dragons games, and now more come for festivals downtown like the Celtic festival, as well as the great brewpub scene, the bike trails, kayaking/canoeing, the arts, the shops in the OD, and the great restaurant scene. Lots of stuff you can really only get downtown, and a number of things done better downtown than elsewhere in the region also."
dayton,35313g,sonicblew,3,Thu May 7 01:28:14 2015 UTC,"Again, there are some really nice things in Dayton, but if ""bike trails"" and ""kayaking/canoeing"" make your short list for downtown-specific activities that people don't have access to in the suburbs, I think that suggests there's a problem.  That some parts of the city (most notably the Oregon District) have rebounded is encouraging, but white flight has a price, and the fact is that much of the allure of Dayton has moved to its periphery.  Doesn't mean the place is without its charms.  While surely the economic struggles of Dayton have been a net negative, one benefit of its hollow center is that getting places is a breeze.  Maybe there aren't as many places to go in downtown Dayton as in other cities of comparable size, but you can get there in a timely fashion, and sometimes you can even park your car.  And if you decide to pop across the city to see what's going on in one of the suburbs, you generally don't have to sit in traffic for a frustrating eternity.  So sure, stuff is more spread out, but you can actually get there.  I think Daytonians should just lay claim to the entirety of the suburbs as an extension of the city proper; it's not like you have to plan out an itinerary to make use of them."
dayton,35313g,thisisnotaworkacct,0,Thu May 7 01:51:45 2015 UTC,"I hear ya, and I don't disagree, but those suburbs aren't going to exist without a core. They are suburbs for a reason, they exist because Dayton exists. So if we want them to do well, the best thing we can do is support not only them but the city proper too. nd fortunately, more and more people are realizing this, or realizing that it's actually really nice downtown, or whatever else is making a lot more people decide to come downtown than 10+ years ago. Downtown used to close up at 5pm, now there's at least some pockets that are open. With some luck and support, downtown may become a 24-hr place to be."

After thinking about the topic for a while, and taking the survey myself, I've decided that I would like to see DPD utilize body cameras, but not in any location where there would be an expectation of privacy (not on private property, in private homes, etc.).

dayton,34ck96,sick937,1 point,Thu Apr 30 14:52:28 2015 UTC,"To play the Devil's Advocate here:  What about when you are tinkling in a public bathroom?  Cops have to use the bathroom too. They come into a bathroom where you are tinkling. Guess what? The camera is still rolling. Now, the press decides to do a story on how cops spend their time, so uses a FOIA request to get a copy of the video. Just how many people are you okay with seeing a video of you tinkling?  Yes, this is an extreme case. Perhaps the video might just be of police having a discussion with a jewelry store about how exactly their alarm system is set up instead.  What resources are there going to be to go through a massive pile of video and decide what should, and what shouldn't be released under FOIA requests?  Don't get me wrong, honestly I think cops should be wearing cameras, but there are a lot of issues to be resolved in terms retention of said video, and the release of said video."

But, the conclusion that I came to is that echoed in the sentiment of other commenters. Probable cause and the correct procedure for a police officer to ever invade your private property have to be present for anything in that video to incriminate you. The same thing that could point out illicit activity could also prove the evidence useless if the officer was just snooping around because the he didn't like the jib of your suite. I also expect that the video be kept secure and confidential less it actually be needed to be reviewed for probable cause of the witnessing officer or an inquiry is made. And, someone isn't just combing through footage trying to find you doing bad stuff while the officer was looking somewhere else.  It's a strange time."
dayton,34ck96,rydogg707,2,Thu Apr 30 05:26:17 2015 UTC,"I commented at the end of the survey that all videos should/would be kept confidential and private, unless they were used in an official police report.

dayton,34ck96,MorfiusX,2,Thu Apr 30 14:54:56 2015 UTC,"It's a strange time, for sure.  I just don't like the idea of video record being collected when there hasn't been proof or reasonable probable cause that a crime had been committed on private property, in the public though, I say fair game."
dayton,34ck96,TheyShootBeesAtYou,1 point,Thu Apr 30 06:10:29 2015 UTC,"But having the video of them entering your private residence will prove either way if they had probable cause or not. If they are always recording, they might think twice and hard about what is probable cause or not."
dayton,34ck96,The_Great_Grahambino,3,Thu Apr 30 14:50:30 2015 UTC,"Personal privacy is fine, but not when an officer is serving the public.

It is bad enough you can't make a judgement call or ask for information from someone who doesn't want to be drug into something in the vicinity of the cruiser as it is.  Cop shows up for an anonymous domestic, has the decency to park the cruiser at the end of the block and asks a few questions I have no problem telling him which direction he needs to head.  Do the same with a camera the meth head neighbor can get to see the footage from in court? 'Sorry, just got home & I'm not feeling well'  Take the money and hire some cops, don't spend it giving the cops another reason to avoid intervening in things that are suspicious."
dayton,34ck96,pouncer11,2,Fri May 1 01:43:13 2015 UTC,This does nothing about the cops being lazy at their jobs.  A fair number of crimes in the city are treated as if they are not crimes.

So they're covering their costs more than likely.   Personally, I'm going to stay off the Internet during the fight.

The NFL wants to know how many people you can seat and how the square footage of your bar / restaurant and they charge you according to that. It can cost some places up to $30k to show the super bowl legit. I'm betting boxing costs even more because of how rare big fights are and how costly the PPVs are.

Probably the best place for any outdoor activities in the Miami Valley.  It's worth checking out some of the cool spots in Yellow Springs nearby if you've never explored there.

dayton,34bpzh,SockPuppetDinosaur,2,Wed Apr 29 21:46:10 2015 UTC,"Not a lot of choices for ISPs around here.  It's either ""the phone company"" or ""the cable company"" so if you're going to get a telephone landline to your home, bundle broadband with the phone service, otherwise look into whatever's on offer from (sorry) Time Warner.  Kettering and Beavercreek are both good places to live.  Beavercreek has no city income tax but the city services cost a ton more and there aren't as many of them.  Fairborn is cheap but kind of skeezy these days, Riverside is a slum, and Oakwood only lets you in if you have royalty in your direct bloodline and drive a solid gold jaguar.  Centerville and Bellbrook are both supposed to be pretty nice towns also, they're a bit further south.  Technically, ""Dayton"" is also its own city, but it refers to downtown.  When looking at cost-of-living and quality-of-life charts, ""Dayton"" typically means that specific stretch of downtown, about six blocks wide and twenty blocks long, and it's horrible.  Walk ten minutes south and you're in a gorgeous section of Oakwood, but that doesn't count as ""Dayton"" for a lot of demographics, so pay attention.  Of course, all these places are all lumped in to Dayton once you get more than fifty miles away.  :-)  Yellow Springs is awesome to visit but don't live there unless you really prefer weed over pretty much anything else ever.  Good places to eat are a bit tricky.  There's a ton of stuff in and around the ""greater Dayton area,"" but a lot of it is the same uberchain restaurants you can find anywhere else.  Finding the local chains (Figlio, one store here and two in Columbus, all owned by the same couple) or single places (Christopher's, Mama DiSalvo's, Archer, Sima) is totally worth it.  If you're at all interested in anything that flies, the Air Force Museum is amazing.  Cox Arboretum is gorgeous at the right time of year.  edit:  forgot how markdown works"

I think I'd rather take the risk and wait for something better to be proposed."

It either takes a huge, very organized grassroots movement, or a smaller well funded organization to get enough signatures to get things like this on a ballot.   Right now, we have the money that's pushing this one along. I totally hate that the first year, at least, will be a monopoly. But, with that said, I hate the war on drugs much more. It ruins lives that don't need to be ruined, and I'm not sure when we'll have a chance take our stance against that war again.   It's totally your choice, obviously, and I respect that. Just wanted to share my thoughts on it."
dayton,346ha6,GuzTathums,1 point,Tue Apr 28 20:57:23 2015 UTC,I agree. I'm on the fence as well. However part of me looks at it in the frame of mind that there can always be adjustments. The Constitution was our 2nd attempt at getting a working government in place after the first system failed.   The biggest hurdle is getting the idea passed...work out the kinks and perfect the system once we know what doesn't work.
dayton,346ha6,dougsbeard,6,Tue Apr 28 21:04:49 2015 UTC,"Adjustments to laws like that are not easy. There are a few ass backwards beer laws in Ohio that still exist despite much effort to change them:  A) Beer over 12% ABV is not allowed to be purchased or sold in the state of Ohio. I can't purchase Dogfish Head's 120 Minute IPA ($10ish for a 12oz bottle) because it's 18% ABV.  If I'm looking to get hammered, I'd much rather spend that $10 on a 12 pack of Bürger beer and a pint of cheap vodka. Instead, I have to drive myself to Kentucky and spend my money there. Which I do, fairly regularly.  B) Belmont Party Supply - a world class rated beer store (100/100 on Beer Advocate and 5/5 stars on Ratebeer) cannot legally have a growler filling station because we don't sell enough wine.  This puts us at a competitive disadvantage in the market. Arrow Wine and Dorothy Lane Market (both super respectable places - I'm not complaining about them) can fill glass jugs of to-go draft beer. We would loose our license if we did it.  Figure that one out."

dayton,346ha6,chiefbootkn0cker,3,Tue Apr 28 22:14:40 2015 UTC,"I'm guessing most peoples' problem with responsibleohio is that the proposal doesn't allow for private growing enterprises outside of the investor group. The regulated monopoly (oligopoly?) is kind of necessary as long as weed is illegal in other states.  Otherwise, our state will be open to outside growers (possibly, but not necessarily, funded by gangs) who grow and then export the weed to states where it is still illegal and untaxed at a higher profit margin - this goes on in Colorado.  It is true - this law will ruin quite a few otherwise law-abiding and peaceful black market growers and dealers - this is why your dealer/grower is telling you that it's the worst idea in the world.  But if we are serious about taking marijuana out of the black market, we either need something like this law that prevents, or at least restricts marijuana from being exported to illegal states, or hope for a nation-wide legalization effort."
dayton,346ha6,macKditty,2,Wed Apr 29 23:43:00 2015 UTC,I'm glad you mentioned the proposal isn't perfect but if anyone is interested in a better plan that would benefit a lot of people check out http://responsibleohioans.org/.

You people best read what this proposal is before even thinking of voting on it. DO NOT be desperate to legalize. This is the worst option out there.   Here's a question OP: if ohioans can not even come together and get active for a REAL medical marijuana bill how you think they will ratify the responsibleohio bill if it gets passed?

Overwatch on the other hand looks pretty nifty."
dayton,346qjo,FearAndLawyering,2,Thu Apr 30 02:11:19 2015 UTC,"If you only compare HoTS to Dota or LoL your first reaction might be to feel like the game lacks depth.  But if you try to look at it as a different experience you may find yourself really enjoying the game for what it is.  What I really enjoy about the game is how fast team fighting starts and I've noticed I'm way less stressed out when I play HotS vs DoTA or LoL.  I play all 3, and when I'm just looking to have a great time with friends and laugh and spam abilities and not worry too much about whether I win or lose I'll log onto HoTS and almost always find myself having a great time!  We currently have LOL events at our LAN center twice a week and a lot of people have been asking for a HoTS night so they have something a little more casual to show up to and have a good time.  If you want to give the game another chance come hang out with us and try it again."

My other main complaint with HoTS is that despite growing up on Blizzard games, none of the characters really appeal to me. I don't like any of their post Warcraft3 character designs basically (compare SC1 Raynor to SC2 Raynor, D1/2 Diablo to D3 Diablo, etc).  Thanks for the feedback though, I'll give it another shot again with fresh eyes and try to see it as its own thing as opposed to some watered down other thing."

It's much more appealing to a person like me who loves MOBAs but hates the amount of time I have to spend learning crap to actually start to enjoy the game.  HOTS takes away that learning curve and puts it back on team composition and team fights.  The games are shorter and are exciting from 20 seconds in until the end.  There is definitely tons of strategy, but it's more focused on team comp, team fights, pushing lanes, and objectives.  I guess the differences can definitely push people away, but I've been loving it.  I can pick up the game, play for an hour and have gotten 2-3 games in while having fun the entire time.  There is no really dedicated ""laning"" phase, which makes the game much more fast paced. Supports and assassin's actually play like their name intends because you don't get punished for leaving your partner in lane.  Give it another shot :)"

dayton,33undg,cartomize,2,Sat Apr 25 20:50:54 2015 UTC,I know where there is a first year Kay bass for sale in very good condition. I think the first year they were made was 32? It was the fathers of a violin players in the philharmonic. I think he told me he would take 1800 for it. Very worth it I just could not afford it.

dayton,33undg,Ildri4,2,Sun Apr 26 00:03:07 2015 UTC,"You are going to want to rent an instrument, trust me. Classical instruments aren't even playable until around $1600 for a basic student cello, even more for a double bass, and they appreciate in value over time,  not the other way around.  After a ton of research and reviews I would check out Baroque Violins. Their website sucks really bad but they are the best around. It's really cheap to rent there, and every dollar you spend can add towards an eventual purchase.  Also, bowed string instruments are one of if not the most difficult instruments to learn to play, so I recommend starting weekly lessons as well. It all sounds like a lot of work because it is. Guitar is absolute cake to learn to play in comparison."

Hit F10 when starting (should say it at POST).  If on Windows 7, disable SecureBoot (uncheck it) and make sure Legacy is enabled (can't have both).  If you're on Windows 8, settings should be Native UEFI and Secure Boot disabled.  then restart the computer.  When you change that in BIOS and restart, it should warn you that you are changing it and make you enter a password it provides, do that and your computer should be fine."

I would suggest trying out the Kettering Rec Center at Indian Riffle Park across from The Greene. I assume it draws in a younger population. Fairborn also has a YMCA that might be worth a shot.   And last but not least, if you are into cycling, PM the moderators over at Dayton Biking or post a thread to get an idea of how they do biking meetups.

dayton,33a1zh,sniktawekim,-14,Tue Apr 21 00:31:41 2015 UTC,"What? People don't haggle over prices any more? I'm just trying to get rid of them, that's why I made it cheaper to get them together. I know how much both of the cards cost. I just put a price out there to see if anyone would bite and be willing to give me a counter offer. Yes, you can get it from Newegg, but I will have it to you sooner than them too."
dayton,33a1zh,DrStephenFalken,14,Tue Apr 21 02:25:52 2015 UTC,If you offer close to a fair price people will haggle. But when your prices are in outer space people aren't going to even spend the time trying to get you to come down. The thought is that you won't come down much or if you do come down it will still be over priced.  I looked on eBay: GTX 750Ti SC sells for $75-$90 used all the time. GT 640 sells for $35 to $60.  But best of luck with your sale.

dayton,3365nf,DrStephenFalken,5,Sun Apr 19 23:34:47 2015 UTC,"You can get rentals starting at $600 with most homes averaging around $750-$900. Honestly, Oakwood would be accepting of you. However, the old guard that lives there may be a bit snotty towards you but would never be outright mean;  but they're a bit snotty to everyone that isn't old money.   Beavercreek on the other hand is progressive in that fact that it doesn't judge people on looks or sexuality."

The east side has a larger population and just about everybody there is overstretched on their mortgage and overextended on their credit cards, so it's not really an issue for the most part.

dayton,3365nf,OHKID,3,Fri Apr 24 15:27:11 2015 UTC,Seconding oakwood. House prices seem to be getting higher right now. 90% of people would be very accepting of a same sex couple. The schools are tops in the area and ranked nationally.
dayton,3365nf,SoupCanNort,3,Mon Apr 20 00:10:14 2015 UTC,"I would think that South Park would be a good bet, along with Oakwood. Also Kettering would be good too, as would Patterson Park, St. Anne's Hill and Belmont.  From what I have heard, I don't know about Dayton Public Schools, although there is DECA and South Park seems to have a decent charter elementary school. So that would be one big benefit of South Park vs. other places."

I went to both, although this had been many years ago (and I'm sure they've not gotten better).  Going North a little is fairly nice, Tipp City have good schools, and a commute to Dayton wouldn't be bank breaking on fuel.  As others have said, heading South is a good option too, to the Oakwood area."

dayton,3365nf,Ildri4,2,Mon Apr 20 11:39:42 2015 UTC,"Kettering is pretty solid in that regard, about 10 minutes from downtown and really good school district (I went through Kettering Schools). It seems to be a mostly laid back area, pretty accepting of everyone. That could also be who I tend to hang out with, though(we're mostly a group of mid-20s nerds/weirdos). We have a two year old and the school district is one of the reasons I wanted to stay in town (though Beavercreek, Centerville and Oakwood also have good schools as well). The neighborhoods tend to be safe and quiet as well. I've lived in the area all my life, so if you do have questions on it you can respond and I can tell you what I know.  If you're looking to buy the city also has a program that gives you money towards a down payment in the form of a loan that is forgiven if you stay in the house for a set period of time (I think like 5 years). You can find some houses near The Greene for around $60-80k. Not huge (like 800-900sqf), but pretty affordable."
dayton,3365nf,ohiotaylor,3,Mon Apr 20 18:23:25 2015 UTC,"At least visit Yellow Springs.  It's got great schools, but you might feel like no body even notices you are a tattooed lesbian because your neighbors might be too.  Seriously, it's a mixed bag.  There are all types here. Anecdotally, the local high school has a gender/sexuality club which is way more progressive that where i grew up.  I just bought cookies at their bake sale.  It's great to see kids with the freedom to figure out who they are AND have a bake sale to fund their organization without any harassment."

dayton,3365nf,scienceonly,2,Mon Apr 20 17:45:22 2015 UTC,"I know you said you want to be in the city, but I'm going to throw this out anyway.  Troy.  I just moved there about a month ago from West Milton, where I fled to when I just couldn't take the crime living in Dayton anymore  (I lived by Children's Medical Center).  Anyway, I am pleasantly surprised by Troy.  It's way more progressive than what I thought it would be, being a large rural town.  The schools are top notch.  My boyfriend has 3 kids in the public schools and we have no complaints.  There are tons of things to do here, the downtown area is booming and the city is very, very supportive of small businesses.   What sealed the deal for me was watching how the community bonded together to raise money for funeral expenses for a family that lost 3 girls due to carbon monoxide poisoning.  I mean it was unbelievable.  Several businesses and the schools got involved.  It was quite moving...  I think because you could tell that it was because the community was supporting one of their own.  It is a bit of a pain in the ass if you want to go to a mall...  30 min drive to do that unless you want to go to the crappy Piqua mall (yeah, dont).  Huber is about 20 mins away, but Troy has a lot of what you'd need for day to day living.  Kroger is building a Marketplace there right now."

dayton,3365nf,SgtNovember,6,Sun Apr 19 23:32:57 2015 UTC,"I have two kids that I have raised in Dayton. We sent them to a charter school for the first 6 years and while it was safe, it has its own problems, like overly conservative elements. My daughter will be a senior at Stivers next year and my son will be entering the 7th grade there. I can not say enough good things about that school or the kids that go there. It is an art magnet school with a great ratio of graduates going on to college.     I raised my children in st. Annes Hill and just outside where I bought a house paid for in five years. Dayton is not nearly as bad as it used to be. In 17 years living and working in the city limits my family has had no problems. Just pick one of the better streets and you will be fine. South Park, and st. Annes Hill,  are both great neighborhoods."
dayton,3365nf,Sackman_and_Throbbin,2,Mon Apr 20 02:51:11 2015 UTC,"If you want to be near a city, Oakwood is your option. Nothing else is as close and yet still good for a family. Yes it is expensive.   If you want to drive 7 minutes farther, Centerville is also good for families, great schools, a little less expensive.  Kettering has good parts and bad parts, but the good parts are really nice. Depending on your salary it can be break even with Centerville (more property tax less income tax) or cheaper. Schools are good, but I believe behind Oakwood and Centerville.   For families, unless you want to send to one of the private Catholic schools, your options are Oakwood, Centerville, Beavercreek, Kettering, Springboro.  I have kids out here, and my wife is from the area too.  These things are not written in stone, but just to my understanding from my school experiences and from my wife's info."

I've been to boo-n-brew many times where you're allowed to drink in the streets during that and it's a fuck of a mess that's only fun if you're drunk as well.

But I think closing the street to cars between Patterson and Wayne on weekends (if not everyday) would be a fine idea (especially if outdoor drinking will be allowed). Even without outdoor drinking I don't drive down Fifth on Friday/Saturday nights. Avoiding it takes ~2 minutes, hardly an inconvenience.

They will rip you off, and make your car worse than it was when you brought it in. Those fuckers wanted to charge me almost 1000 bucks for two rear struts.

They sell comics, board games, and have another store just a few doors down that sells video games and computer-time for tournaments and casual play. Typically they have open gaming nights with quite a few D&D/Pathfinder/other RPG campaigns going on. Also, check out their bulletin board that normally has sign ups for new games about to start.  If that doesn't fit you, check out Meetup.com for a gaming group in the area, there's quite a few.   Also, check out /r/DaytonGeeks , they are mostly dead now but people check it every once in a while.  If all else fails, check out Roll20.com and find a group that is friendly to new players, it's online/skype but better than nothing."

dayton,31med5,fish2193,1 point,Mon Apr 6 20:37:51 2015 UTC,"Here is what I've found looking for a group in Dayton:   The Geek Club (subreddit: /r/DaytonGeekClub) - I'm pretty active in this group. Some members have talked about starting a group. Come to a meetup, meet some people, and express interest in joining a D&D game (or add a post to our subreddit). We have several people that have played in the past and expressed interest in a group. The Dayton RPG Meetup Group  - I'm not really active in this group, but I follow them. When I was first interested in a group, I emailed the organizer and he made some recommendation and was willing to help me find some people. Epic Loot - Others have mentioned it, but worth expanding. They run Encounters every Wednesday evening (I think they started a new season a few weeks ago). I would contact the store for more details on Encounters. They also run monthly Expedition games. You have to sign up for those on Warhorn. This month requires you to have a level 5+ character (which had to start at level 1). It sounds like they want to start running Princes of the Apocalypse soon, which will accommodate lower level characters. Bookery Fantasy - Right now they are also doing Expeditions, Encounters, Princes of the Apocalypse. They are also doing Paragon Tier Living Forgotten Realms (4e) still. See their Warhorn for more details or to sign up. Pathfinder Society - I'm not involved with them at all, but I know it's an option if you don't want to do 5e. Most game stores in the area have a bulletin board with people looking for games, and you can either contact those people or post a flier of your own (especially if you're looking for a certain edition). You can always hit up /r/lfg to see if anyone is in the area."

That's true of all of Dayton, actually. Sadly the bar scene in Dayton turns out to be a pretty difficult place to meet single ladies if that's what you're looking for. Dayton is a wonderful place to be 40 with kids and enough money for the burbs, but young and single can be a challenge. I'm young and single and live in Belmont and I actually love it, but I definitely have to go out of my way to enjoy a young single person's life. Hating on Dayton is always in vogue, and for some reason people  subscribe to this sub and yet do nothing but hurl insults and make jokes about Dayton. It's what you make of it and it's a damn order of magnitude better than a lot of other places. You can get anywhere in fifteen minutes, if you don't live immediately North or West of downtown and practice common sense you'll generally be safe, cost of living is dirt cheap, and u less your degree is in underwater basket weaving or you don't have a degree it's not hard to find work. Drinking and eating are just about all you can get for nightlife though, without driving to Cincy or Cbus. Make some good friends, you'll need them - single and friendless is hard here."
dayton,31kuiu,NoBoobsAcctForWork,3,Mon Apr 6 04:03:44 2015 UTC,"From all of the people I have met form Dayton they all hate on it. But as I have gotten older I have realized, as you said, its what you make of it. I have also lived in Cincinnati, which as I say it its ironic, which is pretty bad in most areas around the campus. But I am safe and used to it, so I can handle incidents.  I am not one to go out and meet people at bars, especially women. I generally hate big loud bars and clubs, but sometimes I just my mind for a night and then change it back the next morning. I plan to meet people by joining pickup soccer leagues and different events in the city (concerts?, trivia night, things like that). Also I think I will meet a few people through my work. So hopefully I can find some friends."
dayton,31kuiu,NoBoobsAcctForWork,2,Mon Apr 6 04:27:38 2015 UTC,"If you aren't a douchebagnightclub kind of person then ignore the Greene, the night life there is essentially one big peaked-in-college-frat-bro-circlejerk. Most of the places in the Oregon are genuinely nice, clean, friendly, enjoyable spots.  You can very easily find the things you mentioned, no more than a twenty minute drive. Concerts are limited to local bands at bars (very hit or miss, honestly), music for the middle aged and up at Fraze Pavilion, or whatever comes through the Schuster Center (the Dayton Philharmonic is actually very good). For the most part you won't find any big names (or medium for that matter) playing in town.   If you like cycling, you're in luck because there is a vast network of excellent bike trails. Like kayaking? We've got five damn rivers (not all quality but they're there). Hiking and nature shit? The Metroparks are aweeeesome, and there's Glen Helen and John Bryan in Yellow Springs. If the natural organic free spirit thing is you, Yellow Springs cannot be beat. Beer? Like I said before we like to drink, we've got some pretty good breweries and we're only getting more (check out Warped Wing, arguably our best at the moment). Urban Crag is a great place to rock climb. There are usually a lot of decent small fairs and festivals in the summer.   It's there, you've just got to look.   Edit: if you're of the nerdy persuasion, we've got gaming of all kinds galore.   Since you say you like new construction and want to rent, check out the Cannery, or the places right by the stadium downtown (near Patterson and First I think, by Canal street), or even the apartments at the Greene if you can stand the traffic and the one dimensional demographic of people who go to the Greene. I lived in Centerville and it sucks, one big strip mall filled with traffic. There might be newer places in Fairborn by WSU but I'm not sure, and it also sucks there IMO. Moraine is where all the auto workers lived so it's all poverty now (and smells like actual shit 100% of the time from the sewage plant). West and North of downtown is nothing but crack and heroin (a result of white flight which corresponded with the downturn of the Midwest). East Dayton in hit or miss, stay South of Wyoming St for the most part. The southern and southeastern burbs are very nice. Beavercreek is boring as shit. Kettering is very big and mostly nice if a bit vanilla. Englewood and Vandalia are also nice, vanilla burbs. Trotwood has its good and bad.   The city is starkly racially divided right down the middle, which is a shame in my opinion. The east side of downtown is actively being gentrified and the West (read: where the black people live) is sadly being ignored."
dayton,31kuiu,cartomize,7,Mon Apr 6 06:04:24 2015 UTC,"St. Ann's, Oregon district, South park, and the Cannery are all good places to live op if you like the city life. If you are more of a suburbanite I would recomend Beavercreek."
dayton,31kuiu,MetalFemur,4,Mon Apr 6 02:10:54 2015 UTC,"kettering and oakwood are very nice suburbs of dayton, if your looking to live near where you work. the east side of smithville road has a good community. It all depends how far you want to commute or if you want to live in the city."
dayton,31kuiu,Jordanjm,3,Mon Apr 6 01:26:53 2015 UTC,"I would live in Beavercreek since you'll be at the base, the night life is almost non existent but it's a good area and you won't be far from yellow Springs and downtown."

dayton,31kuiu,chemcalfarmr,3,Tue Apr 7 14:02:06 2015 UTC,"I didn't forget about you! Work just got really crazy yesterday!   They are close to the main bus stop... Which is good and bad.   So some of this is personal issues, others are apartment issues. I move every 6 months for my job so I was not able to physically go and look at the place before hand.. It was blind renting.    I put a deposit down on an apartment. One of the larger Kettering layouts. A week later, they called to tell me they made a mistake and had given the apartment to someone else even though I had put down the deposit. Told me I was sol and that I could take a smaller model and this was good bc it would save me money! No. Sorry... I don't care about the money I want the bigger apt. They told me I could either take it or leave it. Being on a time crunch... I went ahead and took the smaller apt.  I personally hated the layout. Just straight back.. Reminded me of a trailer in a way. There was also a large pole in the middle of one of the bedrooms... I could barely fit my bed and dresser in there comfortably. Small closet space, no storage space (for sheets and towels)  The big floor to ceiling Windows are kinda cool... But extremely drafty.. Also, mine were facing another building and alleyway...  During the summer... There were constantly people in the alleyway at night... Potentially hooker types. Someone definitely got stabbed one night. I am pretty sure every weekend I heard at least one instance of a firecracker or gun shot...  Constantly being asked for change when I leave the building.  Paper thin walls.... I could hear conversations on the room next door.  Maintenance was a joke. When I moved in, the dishwasher didn't work. Had to call 3 times before it would 'run' gave up bc most of the time the dishes were not clean so I just had washed them. They never fixed my ice maker, one sink drained slowly... And the knob on my washer broke twice. Both times had to wait days for them to repair. The door lock was always 'tricky' to open.  I personally hated grocery shopping. If you parked in the back lot ($30/month from outside company) you could either walk around the building or go up and down a set of stairs to get in the building. The front door does not have stairs but even from the bus station you would have to walk around. (this was a problem when I used one of those personal cart thing- this is more of a convenience issue ;)  Carpet was low quality and just.. Idk. I didn't like it. Many of the light bulbs provided were a specialty type. Also general lack of Central lighting. There were lights along the hallway, in the bathrooms, and the special over the cabinet ones in the kitchen.  Not a whole lot of cabinet space... And one of the cabinets was difficult to put things in and out of bc it's right over the bar... And the doors don't open to 180 degrees. If I would hop up on the counter I could reach the whole cabinet.  When my Internet was plugged into the living room, the signal would not reach my bedroom so I had to put a wireless router half way down the hell to get wireless down there.    That's what I have for now.... Some of these things might not bother you at all... But they were all issues for me! Feel free to ask any questions you have! I did not check out the landing so I could not say.   Other people I worked with lived in Beavercreek and liked it there but that's about all I know about that area :)"
dayton,31kuiu,rocky24682,2,Wed Apr 8 08:55:52 2015 UTC,"Wow thank you so much! I've mostly only heard good things about the place (even people who liked it mentioned the walls), so it's good to get this other viewpoint.   I didn't consider the fact there may be sketchy people right around the building or that I would have to carry my groceries quite a distance. Thanks for the extra input!"
dayton,31kuiu,chemcalfarmr,2,Wed Apr 8 11:34:31 2015 UTC,"Hey no problem :)  I actually copied a comment I sent to someone else too! Honestly, if it's the best location for you please go check it out.  Of course this was just my experience and ymmv.  Good luck with finding a new home :D"
dayton,31kuiu,chemcalfarmr,2,Wed Apr 8 12:30:28 2015 UTC,Oh not at all! It's going to take me a minute to type it all out on my phone though :)  I will be getting back to you today!
dayton,31kuiu,tdubbs1010,6,Tue Apr 7 14:53:38 2015 UTC,Sounds like a loft at the Greene would suit you. Plenty of restaurants and bars within short walking distance. Not sure about their price and what you are looking for. Oregon district will also give you plenty of food and night life options.
dayton,31kuiu,jcpianiste,2,Mon Apr 6 03:21:39 2015 UTC,"Beavercreek checking in!    I live at Mallard Landing over by the Fairfield Commons mall, 10-15min drive to the base depending on where you're going and traffic.  Lots of stuff nearby, I'm paying like $965 in rent for a 2br/2ba 1000sq ft apartment with a balcony and cathedral ceilings, and they let you have pets, in case that's important to you (if it is, make sure to inquire first - a lot of places around here will ""allow pets"" but only up to 25lbs or something ridiculous like that).  Onsite fitness center, pool, and tennis courts, and there's no bullshit which/how many parking spaces you're allowed to use.  I think they also rent out townhouses for a little more than that.    Friend of mine lives at the Enclave which is also close, slightly smaller but also cheaper, and he seems to like it, I think they have social get-togethers at the clubhouse too.    The Promenade seems nice from the one apartment I've seen, and I think The Lofts at Willow Creek are pretty new with some neat amenities, although they'll probably be a little more expensive depending on what you're looking for.    Downtown is probs ~15mins from any of these places, maybe less."

I prefer the urban setting of the Oregon District, St. Anne's, or South Park, but it depends on your taste. Of course, living in the city comes with more crime, but I find suburbia to be fairly bland. I can help more if I know about your tastes and budget."
dayton,31kuiu,Epic_Mile,1 point,Mon Apr 6 03:40:21 2015 UTC,"I am not sure what my budget would be specifically, maybe $1200 +- $300 a month tops. I have lived in corn fields most of my life so a rural area is not an issue, but I want to be close to some sort of city scene maybe a 10-15 minute drive at the most. I definitely do not want to be in the city because of crime and crowding, also I would assume it is more expensive."
dayton,31kuiu,monkyboy74,10,Mon Apr 6 04:13:52 2015 UTC,"You can live like a god here for $1200 rent.. hell, you can easily buy a place for that amount of money."

If you want somewhere less expensive with access, try the Miamisburg/Centerville area. It's a 15 minute drive from Oregon up 75 and you can find decent aparments for not so much around here. Plus you've got easy access to a good variety of eateries and a Whole Foods in a few weeks, if that's your thing."
dayton,31kuiu,AnimeJ,1 point,Mon Apr 6 14:32:35 2015 UTC,"Miamisburg/centerville will pretty much guarantee you'd be taking the interstate to work every day. Probably 675 and not 75, but you'll be waiting to get on base from 675 in the morning."

You're correct that Ohio law superscedes local law, however, there's also a division at some level saying what states are allowed to regulate and what local laws get to govern.  This judge is saying that the red light camera law is a violation of these rules...that this camera law should be left up to the city to govern, not the state.  This is, unfortunately, simply the first step in the judicial system working as intended.  The next step would be for someone who is caught by a red-light camera to appeal this beyond the local municipality level and have a higher court determine if this law violates the rights of Dayton to govern."
dayton,31c6hx,Houndie,6,Fri Apr 3 20:04:06 2015 UTC,"Just remember, if it's not at an intersection with a light, Dayton isn't following city law. That means it's not a valid civil ticket.

dayton,30w75u,Drainclog,2,Tue Mar 31 13:29:49 2015 UTC,That sounds like a disk is bad.  Not sure why it would BSOD though.  ORC in Troy is affordable if you just want it done.
dayton,30w75u,iam8up,5,Tue Mar 31 13:31:55 2015 UTC,"A failing disk will cause a BSOD because the OS is reading data, depending on the data in a certain way, and it's getting bad data from the disk and causing a crash. If the data is malformed (because it's corrupt/not read back correctly) that can cause any number of weird issues including BSOD."
dayton,30w75u,FearAndLawyering,1 point,Tue Mar 31 17:55:47 2015 UTC,"Both times it crashed yesterday I had a flash drive in and was copying videos to it. I've since reset the disk to normal and there've been no crashes. I ran checkdisk on it and there didn't seem to be any errors (unless I missed it, that's my first time ever doing that.)  Could a bad flash drive be causing the crashes like that and cause the raid0 to show as failed?"
dayton,30w75u,FearAndLawyering,1 point,Tue Mar 31 19:40:59 2015 UTC,"Raid0 implies 2 disks, do you have 2 drives? Half the data is stored on one, half on the other, this means it reads (roughly) twice as fast. The caveat being if one drive goes out you can't get any data back. You would need to ASAP copy that drive and replace it or be unable to recover anything.  Faulty usb devices can cause BSODs as well, but it wouldn't be causing a raid error message.  How many physical drives in it? Do you know if you are using a RAID setup?"
dayton,30w75u,DrStephenFalken,1 point,Tue Mar 31 19:47:32 2015 UTC,Yes there are 2 drives. The highlighted one was saying failed yesterday.  http://screencast.com/t/K3YiuuWil
dayton,30w75u,FearAndLawyering,2,Tue Mar 31 19:52:47 2015 UTC,There's one thing you can try. Is putting a new cable in. When a SATA or PATA cable goes bad it often gives you bad disk errors when in reality it's the cable. Buy a new cable and try that.

Guide to replacing a hard drive:  Buy a new hard drive the same size or bigger. Make sure it has the same connector on it (probably SATA).  Buy/find a usb to SATA controller cable (http://www.amazon.com/USB-SATA-5-25-Cable-Adapter/dp/B000YJBL78 if you find one USB3.0 it will make the process faster).  Find a guide online for making a 1 to 1 backup of your current hard drive to the new one connected on the cable.  Swap your old hard drive out for the new copy you just made.  If you or someone else can do that you can have it working 100% for ~$100. Most shops will charge $50-100 to diagnose, then labor and parts to replace."

That said, if you're having a raid controller problem on your motherboard, that's no bueno. But if you're not that tech savvy I can't see why you would have a raid array set up.    PM me and let me know if you want to swing by. Please don't be a dirtybutt with a gross PC though :)"
dayton,30w75u,mahTV,1 point,Tue Mar 31 18:47:35 2015 UTC,"Hey there. Is there any possibility a bad flash drive could cause a raid array to show as failed? And yes, I'm not that savvy when it comes to hardware but this is a prebuilt machine and it came with the raid arrays like that.   Why I ask about the flash drive is both times it crashed yesterday I had a flash drive in and was copying videos to it. I reset it to normal and there haven't been any new errors or crashes.   My HD is 1.8 TB btw."
dayton,30w75u,mtodavk,1 point,Tue Mar 31 19:20:27 2015 UTC,"From your explanation, if you do have a RAID array and not just a single 2TB HDD, it sounds like you have a RAID0 array. A USB drive could cause some kind of an IO issue, but the error you got sounds like the 1st HDD in the 1st RAID configuration had an issue (either through the RAID controller on the board, or a bad HDD cluster). RAID controllers and flash drives funnel through the same chips on your motherboard, so you're best scenario is the flash drive causing the issue.  RAID0 (data striping) is very volitle dude, if you lose a drive in that array, your data is as good as gone. RAID issues are also hard to isolate. If you want a quick test to see if you're array has some bad sectors, download Ccleaner and do a ""free space"" wipe. If it crashes again, you can rule out the flash drive."

My recommendation is for you to figure out how much of that hard drive space you are using, create an image with Acronis onto some type of external storage, and delete that RAID array so you have two drives / restore your image on one of the drives.    You're playing with fire having RAID0 on two drives that big, it's really only viable on operating system drives or for developers testing huge datasets. Offer is open if you need help, just let me know, I have the tools."

As another user has said, make a backup of any important files you have immediately. And as another user has said, a bad hard drive can cause BSODs."
dayton,30w75u,AgentFreckles,1 point,Tue Mar 31 18:40:03 2015 UTC,"Well, it's a DIY work but I guess you need to get a spare computer. Then  First backup all you personal files.  Second, try to get an image of your hard drive. It may fail as bad sector on hard drive or the drive itself may fail in middle of imaging. I use redo backup/restore. There are some other good tools too. Chose whatever you like.  Third, open the case and swap the hd with a new good hd. It's just like lego game nowadays. The tricky part might actually be open the case as proprietary latching/locking mechanism.  Fourth, if you successfully did No.2, use same software to restore the image. If your No.2 failed, re-install OS and then restore personal files from No.1."

Like another commentor mentioned: they invented it here and even did some test flights here. They just wanted a softer landing for a longer flight.   Ggggrrrrrr

dayton,30i1nf,bigdump,3,Sun May 3 22:07:28 2015 UTC,"I went to the Dayton Aviation Heritage National Historical Park here in downtown Dayton. I thought that it was interesting to see that they put a lot of qualifiers (all accurate) on the Wright Brothers' invention. Their claim is much more specific than ""first in flight"" like we hear so often. But then people like to hear short, simple explanations that are easy to remember.  What the Wright brothers claimed, and what they invented, was controlled, powered and sustained heavier-than-air human flight (Wiki). And there is an emphasis on the fact that these things were all necessary for practical flight.  There is no proof that either of the inventors you mention achieved that before the Wright brothers. And that is what is truly important. The Wright brothers' invention is what made flight practical as something anyone can do and as a business.   To me, that's what's truly important, not who got there first. But in this case, if you focus on a machine that has all the elements that make flying more than a curiosity, then the Wright brothers did get there first. They did invent flight, and Dayton can claim to be the birthplace of flight.  And if you have proof otherwise, put it in the Wiki and let it be peer-reviewed."

It used to be a runway for heavy planes that couldn't take off without a boost from going down this massive hill. It takes about three minutes to run from the bottom to the top at a jog.

They have a 2 year/24,000 mile guarantee on all their repairs- if something goes wrong with it they will fix it for free.  I will definitely return to them should I need more auto repair done.

Second, I apologize for the website. It started as a blog site for Leigh and I to exchange industry information between us and hopefully educate some in the area as to what should be available here.  With the ribbon cutting for the Water Street project last week (which is our prototype installation), we didn't anticipate the fervor we would receive from the press. While we are absolutely excited at the interest, it caught us with the website unprepared. As you can imagine, tons of emails, phone calls, inquiries from all over the state, and more press interest, the website is a priority and will be fixed soon.  Please go to extramilefiber.com and sign up for the newsletter. As I will be working on some formatting of the site today, please excuse the mess when you visit!

It just doesn't benefit the ISP's enough to make the investment. The reason they are doing it here is because they have to install the lines anyway, so they may as well make it fiber because its a selling point"
dayton,302up6,colmusstard,1 point,Tue Mar 24 17:09:37 2015 UTC,"I think it definitely will benefit them enough to make the investment. I think your number is wrong.

The connection to each individual home doesn't make financial sense because most people don't want to pay extra for additional speed they'll never use. It'll take years to make the investment back, and they'll only make it back by raising prices.  Its not about what's best, it's about what is best for profits  Edit: extra mile not last mile"

Oregon Express is good for live music and has great pizza and an awesome rooftop patio with a great view of downtown, but doesn't have the best bar in the district (as far as selection).  Salar, across the street from the OE, is more of an upscale bar lounge. Used to be known for their martinis but don't know if that's still the case.  Newcom's is forgettable.  Blind Bob's is more hipster/college age. Decent bar and good food. Usually has bands on weekends and can get crowded. Standing room only.  Ned Peppers is also forgettable. I'd personally avoid it as fights and crazy drunkards acting like fools seem to be the norm rather than the exception. Lots of motorcycle enthusiasts seem to gather here.  Hole in the Wall is pretty much like it's namesake.  Toxic Brew is great for local craft beers.  Tumbleweed is a fairly standard bar. Two levels and a nice upstairs patio overlooking 5th. Usually has live music.  Lucky's has great food and a fantastic bar selection, but can get busy.  Trolley Stop has great music, pretty good food, and a better-than-average bar with decent craft beer selection. Awesome patio as well.  And lastly, the Dublin Pub is a fantastic irish restaurant/pub - recently expanded - with awesome food, awesome patio, and a bar to die for. Frequently has live irish, celtic, or rock performers."

If you want to try their beer, Lucky's will definitely have their stuff on tap - http://www.luckystaproom.com/)  http://toxicbrewcompany.com/  Enjoy!"
dayton,2znacz,shizitz,2,Fri Mar 20 00:50:21 2015 UTC,"Awesome, thanks!"
dayton,2znacz,TheR1ckster,2,Fri Mar 20 01:26:24 2015 UTC,I'd really recommend one of our many taprooms/restauraunts with a good selection. A lot of the breweries are going to have their taprooms closed on monday-tuesday. This way you can have a great selection of Dayton AND Cincy beers.  Barrel House is downtown off 3rd and I've heard good things about them. But someone might be able to recommend an even more SOHO regionally place.
dayton,2znacz,shizitz,1 point,Fri Mar 20 01:29:45 2015 UTC,"No problem. Things are going to feel a little dead on Monday night, but the beer should taste the same. If you're in to IPAs, Ohio has a couple that are stellar and fairly easy to find. Brew Kettle's White Rajah and Rhinegeist Truth. I'm always looking for 3F ZD and GH and can have Truth and Rajah waiting for you at the 5th St. Brewpub if you want to make a trade."

dayton,2znacz,GuzTathums,1 point,Sat Mar 21 15:25:21 2015 UTC,"To me, Zombie Dust is very overrated. White Rajah is pretty amazing. Any more info on the Trolley Stop thing? I was talking to one of the guys that works at BPS about it but didn't get a time or anything."
dayton,2znacz,cs0290,1 point,Sat Mar 21 23:33:50 2015 UTC,"Sure! Trolley Stop hosts our beer tastings on the first Wednesday of each month. It starts at 7pm, features nine beers as explained by the Belmont crew, and has some small snacks and door prizes included in the $20 ticket.  We always have a nice spread of beer styles represented and try to include a couple more rare, hard to find beers when possible."

dayton,2znacz,cs0290,1 point,Sun Mar 22 06:21:36 2015 UTC,Three Floyd's is fairly overrated.  They have a great environment at their brewpub but if their supply was higher here I don't think we would hear as much raving about them as we do now.  I just went up there this weekend and it was just okay.  I have a better time getting a growler and going to Olive.

dayton,2znacz,CurtMoney,1 point,Tue Mar 24 05:35:17 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's that, but rather their limited beers are just harder to get here. Other breweries are catching up and surpassing their more widespread offerings. 3 Floyds was also the king of this region and was top tier for so long that a lot of that still carries of to present day.  I still think they are probably one of the better breweries, but a lot of people tend to give some of their beers a lot more credit just from the name thank they deserve."
dayton,2znacz,monkyboy74,1 point,Tue Mar 24 06:37:17 2015 UTC,"Their supply ""issues"" seem to be on purpose and a major driving force in the brands popularity. Never understood the crazy, hipster appeal of ZD..."

dayton,2znacz,sick937,5,Fri Mar 20 11:08:07 2015 UTC,"Warped Wing produces great beer. Yellow Springs brewery is a close second (but 45 min outside of town). Carillon Brewery is a unique experience (historical 1900's brewery), but the beer isn't so good - great german food though. On a Monday though many of these places are closed.  I highly recommend you stop at Belmont Party Supply on Smithville Rd they have an amazing collection of single bottles. You can stock up and bring them back to Chicago. Plus their knowledgable staff will help you find the right stuff. You can buy cans of Warped Wing and get beers from other regional breweries. Cincinnati has some great ones, Rivertown (any of their sours), Rhinegeist (great stouts and IPAs/Pales). Other Ohio brewery's you can't get in Chicago I highly recommend are Rockmill (great Belgians), and Jackie O's (especially the limited release bottles).  Lucky's is a great bar across the street from Toxic, they always have a good selection of local/regional beers."

dayton,2znacz,OHKID,2,Fri Mar 20 01:54:55 2015 UTC,I liked carillon brewery. Pretty cool old fashion brewing. All natural unpasurized unfiltered. Thought it was a cool atmosphere.

dayton,2znacz,ryanatworldsend,0,Fri Mar 20 02:01:09 2015 UTC,"Sure!  My reason is the fact that there's not all that much to the bar. It's more of a pub/restaurant style atmosphere, so more tables. And the bar itself is very open, so it would probably be a blast if it were a Saturday night or something, but on a Monday night you'd be better off with someplace like 5th St. Brewpub. Ironically, it's probably our most famous brewery despite the fact that Carrillon is amazingly unique and IMO should be more well known. Here's NPR's write-up on 5th St: http://www.npr.org/2013/06/12/191070348/city-life-snapshot-daytons-5th-street-brew-pub-co-op"
dayton,2znacz,collsers,2,Fri Mar 20 02:40:34 2015 UTC,"That's tough, because we have several REALLY good ones. My top choice, if you must have one, would be Warped Wing. Mostly because they have some more adventurous brews. A very close, almost tied second would be Toxic. Coming up behind would be Yellow Springs Brewery and Eudora Brewing."
dayton,2znacz,ryanatworldsend,2,Fri Mar 20 00:35:47 2015 UTC,"I'm surprised no one is suggesting Dayton Beer Co. Unfortunately their new location downtown isn't open yet, but they have won a few awards lately."

dayton,2znacz,robber80,2,Mon Mar 23 13:09:51 2015 UTC,"Dayton Beer Company is by far the best Dayton brewery in my opinion.  Yellow Springs and Warped Wing are easily the biggest right now, so you're going to get a crap ton of responses in this thread recommending them. YS is a little out of the way if you were planning on having some kind of day downtown.  Dayton Beer Company has a little something for everyone.  Also, a couple of the suggested breweries if I remember correctly are closed on Monday's for some reason, so definitely check their Facebook out before you make the trip."

There are dinners and good times with neighbors. The houses are lovely but old and need some investment if insulation and modern work have not been done before. Walking distance to downtown (just jump across the bridge). Close enough to ride a bike somewhere. Immediate access to highway. Close neighbors with McPhearson Town (historic neighborhood) which is also very lovely.   There are some people that would say both areas are ""too close to trouble."" However I will say that I've never encountered any kind of trouble and the neighboring areas have nice people (no matter what their financial situation is).  The only thing that I would like to change is the commute to a grocery store. There aren't a lot in the downtown area but then when I think about it...not everybody lives right next door to a grocery store so I guess a drive isn't that big of a deal anyways."

Lots of Cape cod style houses. Which look small but are a very good use of space. I'm a 6 minute drive from work (downtown). I couldn't be happier.  Good luck.

Recent Turkish (?) immigrants have remodeled a lot of the houses, some of which look beautiful and some of which look like they can't possibly up to code.

The good: the prices, the convenience, the proximity to everything. I'm a self-employed dude.. I can literally wake up, brush my teeth and be sitting at my office downtown 10 minutes later. That is awesome.  Buying in Dayton was one of the best decisions I've ever made.. but it is not a life that your friends will admire when they're driving down your street looking at the unkempt houses.

Traffic on Arbor is insane. The blocks are really hit or miss in that area though.  That particular house (good looking wood work one?) I'd argue is over slightly priced, think you could get it in the mid-70s. Those areas back there are very much becoming mostly rental properties.. I'd stick to closer down town.

We have had an issue with petty car break ins lately, but that's come and gone a lot over the past 30+ years.   Yes, there's foot traffic, but where we are it's mostly neighbors out for a walk or Belmont kids.  So I don't necessarily think that's such a bad thing.   You mentioned Montessori and vouchers in one of your other posts... where can I get more info? I had a Montessori education and loved it.

dayton,2yviw7,pibroch,1 point,Fri Mar 13 19:46:25 2015 UTC,The added bonus is that you can take the money you save on your mortgage and use that towards private school education for your children so they don't go to DPS.

Even with the housing market on an upswing the school districts, crime and uncertainty about the business situation in Dayton makes it a risky venture. My family had to walk away.   We moved to Kettering and are much happier. The house may be smaller and not as nice, but I can comfortably let my kids play outside and am not worried about them getting a quality education any longer.   Shop for the neighborhood first, and the house second. You can always improve the house, but the neighborhood is what it is."

Centerville has an incredible school system as well and you can find homes from the 1800s.   You are coming into prime buying season, more are coming up for sale every day.

The neighborhood association is very active and they host a picnic every year as well as a few other neighborhood events (Easter egg hunt, fun run) that are pretty well attended.  Crime is low, the streets are well-maintained, and the city just planted a bunch of new trees for us to replace the ones that we lost due to the elm diseases over the last few years.  We're kind of sandwiched between Kettering, Oakwood, and Belmont so crime is pretty non-existent.  To me it's the best of both worlds, the peace and community of the suburbs combined with the visual interest and proximity to urban areas.  If you're seriously interested in living in the city limits, I would recommend taking a look - there's always a few houses up for sale here and the prices are very reasonable."

The one that wasn't got snatched up while we were exploring other options. I'd love to live in that neighborhood, but decent houses there are only staying on the market for a week or two. We wanted to look at three others, but they were all pending by the time we found them."
dayton,2yviw7,Ericovich,3,Fri Mar 13 17:50:19 2015 UTC,Yeah they do go fast. A lot of those foreclosed houses get snapped up by flippers and are back on the market 9 months later though.

I would encounter lots of hookers and bums working the streets in the area as well.  We regularly had heroin junkies steal from us, or attempt to steal from us. I would say just about all the people living on our block across from us were junkies, with the exception of the guy on the corner.  It was generally not a good idea to walk around at night alone, especially through the alleys. I never got fucked with personally but there is tons of shady shit going on around there all the time.  I also encountered the pickup truck meat salesman of course.  If you live in Dayton, and have kids, and want them to have a good education, don't send them to Dayton Public Schools. Period. So the money you save on housing you will have to budget for private schooling.  Don't expect a fast response time from the police.  If you are single or a couple and have no plans to have kids, by all means, live in Dayton. Otherwise, I'd think twice. And definitely don't live on or near 3rd street between Linden and Smithville.

dayton,2yspih,Str8_outta_mordor,3,Thu Mar 12 20:38:40 2015 UTC,"Fast? If you have an iPhone there is an app name Robinhood -- I highly recommend it.    https://www.robinhood.com/  There is also loyal3: https://www.loyal3.com/  I don't know why they offer IPOs to beginning investors.  Research 10 stocks that you think will do well over the long-run  -- make sure that they are in fact doing well.  Having around 10 stocks will protect you from non-systemic risk -- you're not putting all your eggs in one basket.  Systemic or market risk is impossible to avoid -- the beta of the overall market is 1.  Betas less than 0 usually indicate that a stock will move in the opposite direction of the market or will not directly correlate to the market.  Betas greater than 1 mean the stock price is more volatile than the market.  If you're younger, then you can afford to pick riskier stocks -- like bio-techs and bio-pharms.  The payoff is higher but so is the risk.  Look at the companies financial statements.  You can use the PE ratio, the PEG ratio, market-cap, beta, etc to gauge how well a stock is performing.  Your goal is to buy stocks that are undervalued and have the potential to become great -- but use due diligence.  You may want to read The Intelligent Investor by Ben Graham -- it changed my life.  http://www.amazon.com/The-Intelligent-Investor-Practical-Counsel/dp/0060155477  I don't recommend daytrading for the average investor -- typically daytraders lose money.  RRD has a high dividend yield and they have a history of paying dividends regularly -- RRD has been around since before the American Civil War. So, that's why it's sexy to me.  I am going to keep this for the long-term (really for the dividends).  Usually when a company is paying more than %3,or more in dividends, it can mean that the company is not experiencing growth--but they are steady.  I am not a financial adviser. This is not a comprehensive guide. This is the basics. DISCLAIMER: This is not financial advise."

That is if you're comfortable with programming in Java and J2EE frameworks.  Have you tried Care Source -- they might have some networking internships or Tier 1 helpdesk jobs (it beats not having a job).  If you're good at math, and can pass Reynolds & Reynolds aptitude test, they are always hiring interns, too.  I got some good Tier 1 helpdesk intern experience there (Rey Rey doesn't pay employees very well, but it's experience).    Try checking Wright State's or UD's employment database (you have to be a student or alumni to have access to both) -- I found some great internships through both!  I moved back to Dayton from Columbus (without a job) and I forgot how bleak the job market is around here (not having a job is like not having experience around here).  I'm hoping the job market in Dayton picks up soon or I'll have to leave, but I digress. You may want to look for a summer internship in Columbus, Cincinnati, or elsewhere.   Some other employers you may want to check out in Greater Dayton: Teradata, Lexis-Nexis, Hobart (in Troy), Fifth-Third Bank, Standard Register, Midmark, Innosource.  EDIT: With A+, Net+, and Sec+ certs you'll probably only be able to find tier I, or tier II, help desk jobs -- especially in Dayton.  The US government does really like the Sec+ and Net+ certs -- so you may want to try contractors at Wright-Patt or USAjobs.gov. I am not sure exactly what your career goals and aspirations are, but you may want to get a CCNA or CCERT if you want to go into networking -- YMMV.  The CCNA and CCERT are more centered around problem solving skills whearas the Comptia Test are really more rote memorization -- again YMMV.

The COMPTIA certs are exactly what I'm looking for-- a step into helpdesk. After doing some helpdesk and entry level IT, I'd like to figure out where and what I'd like to specialize in, hence why I'm focusing on the basics at the moment.  I'm not overly good at maths, as discrete maths and calculus were hardly passable for me, and I only have an introductory (first year) level of java training, so while I would look into it, I doubt I'd be qualified.   Care source sounds like something I'd be possibly qualified for, and certainly interested in. If Rey Rey math aptitude test lingers around college algebra level, I may qualify, but maths have never been a strong point.  My current goals are to get A+, Net+, Sec+, and then figure out from the jobs those qualify me for, whether to move into linux or microsoft sysadmin, or into the realm of CCNA/Juniper networking. I really painted myself into a corner with a Liberal Arts degree, and am attempting to add some semblance of practicality to my education, such that I can find a job.

Also, if you do not respond to the ticket, they assume this is a waiver of your right to contest it, and thus you are now obliged to pay the ticket.  Now, having said all that. This is not criminal and the only thing that they can actually do is charged you fees up to X amount in addition to your original fine, and then transfer it to a collection firm and try to hurt your credit."
dayton,2ynxma,thisisnotaworkacct,2,Wed Mar 11 15:22:31 2015 UTC,"To my understanding (and I am not a lawyer) these are civil fines and not legal fines so your ability to fight it is somewhat limited, and is the city's ability to force collection. Unlike a real ticket they can't suspend your license or refuse to renew your registration, if you are a habitual offender (like 10+ outstanding camera violations) and the city happens to run your plates and sees that when you are parked along a street or on city property then your vehicle may be impounded. Otherwise, it seems like not much can happen to you."
dayton,2ynxma,DoctorMeh,2,Wed Mar 11 15:12:33 2015 UTC,I would pay.  They can put a hit on your credit for non-payment.  An $86 dollar ticket is better then .5% more on loan you take out because you have a non payment on your credit.
dayton,2ynxma,eng_pencil_jockey,2,Wed Mar 11 15:19:48 2015 UTC,"I'm saying if you don't pay it there isn't much downside. By existing law the citation was legally issued, and there should be a mechanism where you can request video evidence for the citation for the purposes of fighting it, but you still might not win even if you are right. It won't go on your record as a moving violation and for just one ticket the city will not work hard to get you to pay your fine. In some places unpaid fines can go to collections, but I don't know for sure if Dayton does this.   It all depends on how much time you want to spend on the bureaucracy. Contesting the fine has to be done in a very short window of time so if you want to at least try to fight it you need to act quickly."

dayton,2ynxma,thisisnotaworkacct,1 point,Wed Mar 11 15:40:44 2015 UTC,"The tickets are not issued through traffic court, therefore your ticket will not show up on your record when a cop runs your tags unless the courts have issued a bench warrant.  To illustrate how this system is being abused;  A friend of mine (Dan) this winter was traveling down 35 towards Dayton from the Troutwood area. Due to the slippery roads, he slid through an intersection, causing no harm to anyone else. The camera caught the act and issued a ticket from his license number. Dan decided he would fight this seeing how the weather was a major factor. Calling a number listed on the ticket to contest the charge, he was told to meet at a private building during working hours. He showed up to an empty building, waited around for half an hour and left, all while taking time off work without pay. Calling the number again, he had to leave a voicemail and did not hear back for several days. When Dan did receive his call back, he was scheduled another meeting during working hours and asked to come back. Rather than lose another half day of work, Dan paid the ticket. We can hold our government accountable for all of this but private business plays by different rules."

If you can make it to brown street there's some good spots there too.. Dewey's pizza is awesome and you make good money.  I've alway found with restaurant work it's best to lay out a large net as opposed to trying to look for and follow specific leads.

dayton,2yekf6,flyerfanatic93,1 point,Mon Mar 9 05:09:43 2015 UTC,"Certainly.  Your pay will end up being substantially less than your industry peers.  For example, my programmer friend was offered $30,000 when he applied but ended up taking a job on base for $45,000.  My other friend worked in the TAC (Technical Assistance Center), said she LOVED the people, but didn't make much money (I never asked her salary), thought the training was good (it is great btw especially for salespeople), but didn't feel like it was a career choice plus she was bored most of the day.  This actually surprised me because my experience in sales was that I was overworked, underpaid given how much I made for the company, and completely micromanaged to the point where it was stressing me out.  Those are just a few examples from people I know including myself.  I would encourage anyone interested in hearing more specific examples to read the Glassdoor.com reviews as they provide innumerable accounts from areas of the company all across the country."

dayton,2yekf6,OleBenKnobi,6,Wed Mar 11 02:14:54 2015 UTC,"I got turned down for a job there. Something in their digital marketing department. I had an acquaintance who turned me on to the opening and supposedly put in a good word. I had to do a ridiculous amount of testing beforehand - it was like taking the SAT again. A week goes by, no word, then just a quiet email saying I wasn't right for the job. My acquaintance was dumbfounded - from my resume alone he thought I was exactly what they needed. I was perturbed for a while but then he informed me that the person they ended up hiring has no professional experience,  types less than the requisite WPM, has never used any of the necessary software, etc. I guess their priority was less about the skillset/experience and more about personality type. Judging from the myriad responses both here and elsewhere,  I think I dodged a bullet."
dayton,2yekf6,OleBenKnobi,3,Mon Mar 9 15:25:07 2015 UTC,"There is A LOT of emphasis placed on how you score during your personality assessments.  I knew a few people like your friend who didn't make the cut even though they were good candidates on paper.  Recruitment was one of the few departments I didn't know anyone in so all I know is they are always hiring due to turnover and according to rumors your psychological profile/IQ tests determine your ceiling of advancement.  Intramural sports and after work drinking sessions were always ripe with commentary especially if a pre-buyout employee decided to drink/speak.  Also, your friend's ""good word"" was him submitting your name/resume to Recruitment.  Had you been hired and stayed on long enough he would get a hefty cash reward while you would get the job.  A lot of people bring in friends because the referral bonus is good, they want to hang out with pals, and for most everyone a job is preferable to being unemployed so they felt it was a win-win.  Recruitment put posters up all over the building telling people to submit referral forms.  The bonus for field sales reps was substantial, as in thousands of dollars, but the shear amount of encouragement to bring in new people was unsettling especially since working there kind of sucks."

The person they hired could barely type and had virtually no experience with basic computer programs (like Microsoft office stuff), let alone some of the more specialized software the position uses on a daily basis. I did not get hired despite all that experience, due to the testing results. Honestly, I think the testing worked the way they wanted it to. I wouldn't say I have a problem with authority but I also don't take orders blindly and I'm not afraid to speak my mind if I think things are being done in a less efficient/absolutely stupid manner.

I also agree some of your experience is dependent upon who you work under/what department you are in.

That depends on where you're working in the company and how good of a supervisor or manager you have. Does the ""company"" have certain political views? Absolutely. It's a private company, and you sign in your initial agreement that they can pretty much align themselves however they want, but they don't force you to change your political views.  My bills are paid, I've got pretty good health insurance, and access to a free gym.

You are shackled to their manual and have to note every single step that you did or else you get dinged on your performance review. You will not get a raise, because they will find something on your performance review to pick at. You will be on the phone, especially if you're in hardware because they are the first layer of tech support and if something goes wrong on a mass scale, that's who customers call. And things do go wrong -- sometimes on purpose, but nobody tells Tier 1.. they just find out when it happens and get to look stupid until management figures out that an update went out that changed or broke a major feature!  This and more, working at Reynolds. Did I mention that before I left, they had moved all of the older folks to Level 2 -- they had people that were there for less time than I had been there training newbies. They want to make sure that obedient newbs are training new recruits -- older folks know shortcuts and have learned ""bad habits"" and this takes money out of B-Rock's pocket.

dayton,2ydsub,BlondieMcG,6,Mon Mar 9 00:13:23 2015 UTC,"Belmont is a pretty good neighborhood. I grew up there, and still work in the area. Some people who aren't intimately familiar with Belmont or haven't actually lived there often group most of East Dayton into Belmont. It's adjacent neighborhoods of Eastmont and Hearthstone are also pretty nice, the three have a joint community council that meets monthly. However, the neighboring east side areas of Burkhardt and Linden Heights are a little rougher. Here is a website you may want to check out   http://www.areavibes.com/dayton-oh/belmont/livability/  They rate all the neighborhoods in Dayton and give crime and demographic stats."

dayton,2ydsub,ChloroformScented,3,Wed Mar 11 14:31:17 2015 UTC,"I lived there for a couple years.  As most here have said, it's got its good parts and not-so-good parts, but honestly, in my opinion, the vast majority is not too bad.  If you can afford a place in Oakwood, Centerville, Bellbrook or some of the nicer parts of Kettering (where I now live), they are clearly preferable to most people, but if you're looking for a place this isn't terribly expensive but that you can still walk down the street at night (in most parts), Belmont is a good place to look.  Also, they have Belmont Party Supply, so there's that."

dayton,2ydsub,TheOriginalGK,6,Tue Mar 10 22:04:03 2015 UTC,"Right. First off, I never said give up on improving. Second, I never said that there weren't worse places in and around Dayton. But go hang out around Belmont Park and watch the stream of people raising a ruckus, drinking and smoking weed and remind me again of how Belmont's a great area in the same vein as Centerville or Beavercreek or Huber.  There's nothing wrong with Belmont in general, and there are definitely areas that I'd be fine living in.

As for the other cities you mention. They are other cities, not really Dayton neighborhoods. And HUBER!?!?! Really?? Im guessing you don't spend any of you Huber time south of I70.   If you want to get technical, they're townships, not cities. And with that being the case, they're townships of Dayton. Belmont's just a smaller version of that.

dayton,2xz3ue,mynameisnonsequitur,15,Thu Mar 5 13:37:24 2015 UTC,"I would recommend continuing to look in Yellow Springs for something. It might take longer, but it will be worth it! Yellow Springs is a quirky, tight-knit community with people passionate about all sorts of things, and every other weekend is a festival/event/block party. The businesses downtown are diverse, locally owned, and rich with arts and culture (live music, pottery, glass, a small but very nice movie theater)--plus numerous good places to get coffee, food, or a drink. Fairborn is not as well organized as a town, doesn't have the same sense of community, and is poorer. Downtown Fairborn doesn't have many businesses, nowhere good to eat (mostly fast food), and there aren't any places to get together with friends for the evening. That all said, Fairborn would likely be cheaper and there are still some exciting things to do occasionally; Foy's is an amazing set of Halloween stores and October is a really fun month around there. However, Yellow Springs is considered among the best small towns in America for a reason! Good luck finding what you're looking for."
dayton,2xz3ue,PhinFrost,3,Thu Mar 5 02:36:02 2015 UTC,"There are a couple of good places to eat in Fairborn, namely Ticket's, a restaurant/bar that has pretty good American and Greek food, and Giovanni's, an Italian restaurant that was recently remodeled. Fairborn is also pretty close to Beavercreek where there is a multitide of decent eateries."
dayton,2xz3ue,kyp44,2,Thu Mar 5 17:47:43 2015 UTC,"That's true! But Tickets and Giovanni's don't equal Sunrise Café, The Winds, Ha Ha Pizza, Peach's, Williams Eatery, Underdog, Spirited Goat, the Tavern, the Indian place by Corner Cone, Aleta's--crazy how many non-chain places there are for the size of YS!

dayton,2xz3ue,0149,3,Thu Mar 5 03:24:49 2015 UTC,"I would second this. The timeframe can be stretched with imagination.   For example, AirB&B has several listings for stays in Yellow Springs.

dayton,2xz3ue,rachnea,5,Mon Mar 9 04:40:49 2015 UTC,"I was born and raised in Yellow Springs so obviously I'm biased but Fairborn isn't very walkable if thats your thing. Chances are if you live in YS you can pretty much walk/bike ride anywhere. I know YS is expensive but I would personally prefer living there over Fairborn.   However, you aren't going to find a large grocery or any chain/corporate places in YS (other than Subway). You would have to drive to Fairborn or Springfield.   Crime is considerably (violent crime almost non-existent) lower in YS than Fairborn and YS has more character of the 'small town' feel.   But, Fairborn has more options for food, closer to the mall and other big box retailers, and groceries.   If you have any other questions about YS or want any suggestions let me know! Also, why can't you find an apartment? Price? Availability?"

If you haven't already - try looking here: http://ysnews.com/classifieds#rent   Hawthorne Apartments DO allow pets. I believe Twin Coach apartments do as well but you would have to call to verify.

Although I miss having a lot of restaurants and shopping nearby, I'm pretty close to 675, so it's quicker to get to Beavercreek and other points south of here.  I live in a new housing development just off of Yellow Springs-Fairfield Road, so I'm only about 10 minutes away from Yellow Springs, which is a great little place to visit when the weather co-operates.  It's a military town, and an old town, so it's a bit shabby in places, but the water & trash are better and cheaper than in Huber.  The rents/house prices seem to be a bit more affordable, too.  If you can find a nice apartment or house to rent here, I'd say go for it."
dayton,2xz3ue,SleepyConscience,3,Thu Mar 5 04:31:37 2015 UTC,I just moved out of my apartment in fairborn. It was like a 400sqft studio with a balcony. $375 a month and the neighbors were all quiet. Pm me if you want some info
dayton,2xz3ue,Mmiklase,3,Thu Mar 5 03:23:01 2015 UTC,"I work in town as well. I like the community so I wanted to stay. My company put me up for a couple weeks while I was looking. I held out because I really like Yellow Springs. As /u/rachnea mentioned, the ysnews.com site has classifieds and dunphy usually has some listings. You might try posting something to the ""Yellow Springs Area"" Facebook page. Sometimes people have rooms available.  If you need a place ASAP Fairborn is reasonable, though personally I'd look at the places in Beavercreek. Also, I have a friend at work who drives from Cedarville and he likes it there."

Oh yeah, thats annother thing. I hope you don't mind living next to an airport, haha. you get used to it, but the noise is hard to hear over every once and awhile. There are a few fastfood places, some local diners, and down town has a nice selection of local buisinesses, but it realyl is like everyone else has said- sleepy. Our Halloween festival is incredible, but the rest of the year is pretty boring, and there isn't anything interesting within walking distance. There are several nice parks, but again, you can't compete with having John Brian right next door, haha."
dayton,2xz3ue,spunknugget,2,Thu Mar 5 14:47:43 2015 UTC,I wouldn't move to Fairborn.  I lived there in the late 90's and was glad to move when I did.  It's been on a decline ever since.  I would recommend Xenia as well because you could just drive up 68 and get to Yellow Springs.

dayton,2xz3ue,stulogic,3,Thu Mar 5 23:24:30 2015 UTC,"I would recommend moving to Channingway. It's technically a part of Fairborn, but separated from most of it by the interstate. It's where I lived when I first moved to Dayton. It's nice, safe and relatively new (most things in Fairborn are fairly old, but not good old, 60 and 70s old). It's also right next to the road that takes you into Yellow Springs (it's about a 10 minute drive). It's also within walking distance of the grocery store and a sports bar and close to I-675. I'm not sure their rates now, but when I lived there in 2011 a one bed was $599/mo. That said, Yellow Springs is probably my favorite town in the whole Dayton area, and if you can find a place there I would live there. You could always just do a 3 or 6 month lease at Channingway to tide you over until you find something."

Not sure what your budget is but Brinley Place is near channingway and would only tack on an extra mile to YS. That end of fairborn is on the outskirts of town so it's not anything like downtown.

dayton,2xz3ue,mulberryred,1 point,Thu Mar 5 13:21:40 2015 UTC,"Thoughts: You might fare better if you move your search out of fairborn and towards beavercreek/wright state area. There is a ton more shopping/night life, though it is less residential. If you are looking for a hometown-like feel fairborn works well, but if you're looking at commuting anyway, Beavercreek has a TON of apartments and is easily accessible from the highway. Fairborn is cute but also doesn't have a ton of businesses and can leave you feeling a bit stranded out in the middle of nowhere, even if you're five feet away from something. That is, unless you're cool with driving. Also, Yellow Springs has rentals that aren't really marketed on the internet since the community is both more quirky and the real estate market has a faster turnover."

dayton,2xvjau,scienceonly,5,Wed Mar 4 12:24:52 2015 UTC,Actually Food and Entertainment would be where those jobs would be lost.  The thing I am interested in is whether they used Dynamic Scoring or the Current CBO scoring method.

Those then laid off employees will be receiving assistance from the state and federal government which ends up costing the government more money.  I'm sure it isn't this clear cut, but that's how it looks to me being someone who has no knowledge of economics.  Someone correct me if I'm wrong."
dayton,2xvjau,ZapfBrannigan,3,Wed Mar 4 12:39:29 2015 UTC,"This is the most civil macro-economic thread I have ever seen on Reddit. The issue is that everyone is both right and wrong in the assumptions they make. No statistical study will ever be free of assumptions; meaning we will never have a black and white answer regarding macro-economics.   Personally, I would rather see companies paying minimum wage to pay into a state run fund providing education and services to get people out of the poverty hole. For example, have McDonalds pay an extra $2/hr to a fund that provides tuition assistance to Hobart Welding or a Sinclair CC rather than giving it to a teenager whose parents earn over $75k a year"
dayton,2xvjau,dirething,2,Wed Mar 4 18:11:39 2015 UTC,"The issue with your suggestion would be that either every company pays or it is still an incentive to drop minimum wage employees.  The former we already have with taxes paying some portion of education financing and job training, employment, etc.  I think you could accomplish something if you turned out the other way around though.  Combine welfare for the able with a work program that has monetary incentives for companies to take on less than stellar applicants.  That model seems to have worked for the disabled, I don't see why it couldn't be applied here."
dayton,2xvjau,scienceonly,0,Thu Mar 5 01:50:27 2015 UTC,"Some businesses, sure. But other (if not most) companies' wage levels will increase because of more people being able to afford their products.  Both of my comments are just speculation as well."

Math says that negatively affects 3% of people potentially, while overwhelmingly benefiting 97% of people affected? Sounds like a great deal. 97% of people affected would be getting an (up to) 25% raise.   Historically, people making minimum wage don't save as much of their money (uh, they can't?) which means over 600k people spending 25% more money that will go right back into the economy."

dayton,2xe7s5,atoms_and_humans,6,Sat Feb 28 07:32:07 2015 UTC,While I agree the war on drugs is futile and the legalization of marijuana is needed. Having unregistered automatic firearms is not ok! That's why I don't agree with your title that they wasted money. The people who were in possession of those weapons should not be walking the streets in my opinion.
dayton,2xe7s5,Chknchknchkn,10,Fri Feb 27 21:50:46 2015 UTC,Wanna bet that these weapons turn out to be semi-automatic?
dayton,2xe7s5,fractuss,7,Sat Feb 28 00:25:44 2015 UTC,"If they weren't having to act illegally to ply their trade, chances are they wouldn't have automatic weapons to protect themselves against other scumbag criminals (or to shoot at the police). Gotta love all the organized crime prohibition leads to."
dayton,2xe7s5,uglyslob,5,Fri Feb 27 23:05:37 2015 UTC,"Why is it that you champion an end to the war on one particular type of contraband, but advocate a continued, but equally ineffective war on another?"
dayton,2xe7s5,DoktorKruel,1 point,Fri Feb 27 23:48:42 2015 UTC,Can I ask what contraband you are referring to?  Because I support the use of many illegal drugs to combat medical problems and the pursuit of a different plane of consciousness. Like the work of the MAPS program in California. However I do not think a person should own an unregistered automatic weapon.
dayton,2xe7s5,Chknchknchkn,-1,Sat Feb 28 00:25:22 2015 UTC,"Unregistered semi-automatic is okay, then, per current law?"
dayton,2xe7s5,yourhometownsucks,7,Sat Feb 28 01:16:27 2015 UTC,Yes. Semi auto weapons don't have to be registered unless they fall under other NFA restricted categories.
dayton,2xe7s5,YFC,1 point,Sat Feb 28 02:05:18 2015 UTC,"So by this logic, if the NFA ceased to exist then you'd be okay with the private, non-regulated ownership of select-fire firearms, correct?"

dayton,2xe7s5,Chknchknchkn,-4,Sat Feb 28 02:58:55 2015 UTC,"So is the reason that firearms should be banned and marihuana legalized simply because you support marihuana and not firearms? If so, that's dumb. Supporting and end to the ""war on drugs"" is reasonable on the ground that it's not possible to eradicate supply or demand for a product that people want. The argument is the same for pot and guns.   Similarly, it's reasonable to oppose criminal penalties for possession of an item that is not inherently dangerous. Again, the same is true of guns and marihuana.   So my challenge is for you to put forward a valid reason WHY you think that possessing and using pot for a purpose that doesn't harm anyone else is okay, but possessing firearms for a purpose that doesn't harm anyone else should be banned."
dayton,2xe7s5,Mmiklase,1 point,Sat Feb 28 04:31:56 2015 UTC,"To begin, I don't believe firearms should be banned and I don't see where in my comments I allude to that.  Firearms are dangerous though and require a large amount of respect for what they are capable of ,which the majority of owners have. With that in mind I have no qualms with the licensed ownership of automatic weapons for personal use, they are exciting and I understand why people enjoy firing/ owning them.   But IMO The possession of any weapon with the serial numbers filed off raises a major red flag on the intentions of the owner and should not be taken lightly."

Here's a list of (I think) all of the non-profits in Dayton. Do you have any grant-writing or fundraising experience?

I don't know how often/if they are hiring, but if you're in Dayton and there's nothing else opening up, you could volunteer there as a way to get your foot in the door. They also have a ton of other projects like Erma's House (a supervised visitation center for parents and kids) that might interest you."

dayton,2wtaw6,ftw7969,4,Sun Feb 22 23:53:46 2015 UTC,The thing about this though is that it's like the casinos where only certain people will be allowed to grow. These licensed people will be useful in funding the bill but I don't think it's a best case scenario   Still need to pass it though
dayton,2wtaw6,elatedwalrus,3,Mon Feb 23 14:27:23 2015 UTC,You can't even grow your own?  Or you have to be licensed to sell?  I'm ok with the latter.
dayton,2wtaw6,friends_not_food,2,Mon Feb 23 16:03:46 2015 UTC,In another article about it it sounded like the individuals that were licensed to sell would be the only ones to be licensed so they would sort of have a monopoly (of course they compete amongst themselves though)   idk about growing it yourself I'll read the bill more to see if they talk about it Edit: these individuals would be growing it too- the article was about how land was being set aside for this  Edit 2: it talks about how any person 18 or older is allowed to grow and distribute.  It also talks about licensing so I may be wrong about it all
dayton,2wtaw6,elatedwalrus,2,Mon Feb 23 16:15:17 2015 UTC,"It should be noted that the bill linked in this post is hopefully going up for vote in 2016, and this bill is different from the one promoted by Responsible Ohio, which is up for vote this year. The Responsible Ohio bill grants a monopoly to 10 growers. Vote no this year, vote yes next year, basically.  It doesn't help that both these groups have similar names. This is by design, because my theory is that the Responsible Ohio people who are aiming for a monopoly are actually trying to kill any legitimate legalization effort by causing confusion and proposing an absolutely awful bill."
dayton,2wtaw6,insomnyuk,1 point,Tue Feb 24 19:22:52 2015 UTC,"But really how great would a monopoly be for these growers? Eventually (maybe soon) marijuana will be legally federally and people will be growing all over the place.

dayton,2wtaw6,elatedwalrus,1 point,Tue Feb 24 21:03:45 2015 UTC,It would be pretty great for them considering legal mj in Ohio would be a billion dollar business or more. If it passes it becomes part of the constitution and is then very difficult to repeal or change.

If the data wasn't being stored, it wouldn't be an issue, but there are no laws regarding the storage of the data.  ""But they track your cellphone movements!"". And along with that, almost every car built since ~05 has OnStar or some other built in system based on GSM (cell phone tech). Yeah, and they need a warrant to access that information, and as far as I'm aware it's not sold to third parties.   OP mentions it's an unmarked car. It kind of is a big deal private companies start monitoring the movement of private citizens. There's no consenting in this instance.

If the authorities want your location, they're going to get your location, regardless of what services you have turned on.  The more 'plugged in' you are, the easier it makes it.    These plate scanners are no different from having a cop sit at an intersection and read/write down/look-up every license plate that drives by.  It just automates that process, it's nowhere near an invasion of privacy, and it isn't spying.  Technology progressess and makes every single facet of our society more convenient.  This industry is no different.   I'm all for the anti-cop and anti-spying circlejerk, and I'm usually the first to complain, but I don't think this is illegal or wrong.  It's just reality"

They have a very large selection of jewelry, as well. My guess is they can accommodate any budget - they even sell loose stones so you could perhaps create a ring that maximizes the stone and minimizes the band if you wanted.  They are definitely worth a visit."

dayton,2wjwfh,dry_cocoa_pebbles,5,Fri Feb 20 18:04:29 2015 UTC,"Please, please, please do not buy from James Free!  They are trying to tear down the houses in our neighborhood to add parking for their store, even though its only needed two or three times a year. If this passes, it will set a precedent in our city that residential lots can be annexed for business purposes and create a lot of future issues.  They've also treated my neighbors awfully, parking in front of their houses instead of parking in the big empty lot across the street.   They have a lawyer who speaks for them at all the council meetings, but they have never even come up with concrete data on how many days they need the new parking lot.  They might be a fine jeweler, but they are terrible neighbors."
dayton,2wjwfh,juanqp,6,Fri Feb 20 21:45:42 2015 UTC,"This says they are just trying to rezone and demolish a single home to expand their parking. It also says that they already own the property. That would help them to reduce on street parking. I don't consider DDN reliable, what are they missing?  http://www.daytondailynews.com/news/news/local-govt-politics/kettering-weighing-jewelers-request-to-expand-park/njKTh/"
dayton,2wjwfh,dry_cocoa_pebbles,-2,Fri Feb 20 22:08:24 2015 UTC,"They own the first property by outbidding the family that wanted to move into it several years ago. Its a two story with a basement- which is exceptionally hard to find in Kettering. House is about 85 years old.   There are future plans to expand parking even further, up to two houses deep along the Far Hills corridor, but this is the first step- set the precedent, make it easier.   This does effect home values, especially the house which will now be next to a parking lot. Unfortunately, neither James Free nor the city council have bothered to do any studies on this. As I said above, James Free has also not provided anyone with any kind of research on how often this parking lot would be utilized.   If you've ever been to the area, there is a shopping center across the street with ample parking, where James Free claims their employees park, but this is not so. They have their employees park in front of the houses in the neighborhood, which if you're familiar with the neighborhood each house utilizes the street in front of their house. You can see at any time of day, their lot is basically empty and their employees are lined up on the street.  I have not lived in the neighborhood long enough to know all the details, but I've been told of a fair amount of ""bullying"" on James Frees side when it came to the house being put up for sale. Even now, there is a bright light they shine on the side of the house, I was told they put it there before the family moved out and that they would routinely park blocking their driveway. Other nearby neighbors have complained of blocked driveways and trash left in their yards by employees but have been treated rudely when bringing this up to management.   In any case, stories be true or not, it just seems a shame to tear down a beautiful house in a family neighborhood for a parking lot."
dayton,2wjwfh,alethia_and_liberty,4,Fri Feb 20 22:38:07 2015 UTC,They own the first property by outbidding the family that wanted to move into it several years ago.

dayton,2wjwfh,dry_cocoa_pebbles,-3,Sat Feb 21 02:14:34 2015 UTC,"How cunning of you. Yes, they outbid them. The point was, they paid more for the house than what it was worth with the sole intention of turning it into a parking lot.  Scoff all you want, but things like this matter when you buy a house and invest in a neighborhood. No one wants to live next to an empty parking lot, and no one wants a rude business that thinks they can do whatever they want as a neighbor."
dayton,2wjwfh,jvoosh,2,Sat Feb 21 03:33:23 2015 UTC,I would also point out that parking in the shopping center across the street would require employees to cross Far Hills Ave - a 5 lane road at that point.

Since on street parking is legal, I really don't see what the issue is.  I'm always a bit amused when people ask me if they can park in front of my house. I tell them yes, and hide my amusement to be polite. The street doesn't belong to me. I have no authority to tell them they can't park on a public road they may have helped to pay for."
dayton,2wjwfh,dry_cocoa_pebbles,2,Sat Feb 21 18:28:24 2015 UTC,"I really feel like it makes more sense as a business to move to a location that can better suit their needs. They have already stated they expect to need more more parking in the future even if they are able to tear this first house down and build a lot. Why a business would make so many long term decisions expecting to tear down houses in a neighborhood is bad business. I am all for businesses in our city, but there are plenty of other, larger locations with ample parking available.  The problem with them using the street, is that the people who live here now have nowhere to park. This is a residential neighborhood, not a city. James Free also comes into every meeting assuring that they do not park in front of people's houses and that they do not litter in their yards, but none of that is true.  Everyone in this thread can be against the neighborhoods view on this, and that is fine, but I'm willing to bet most of you have not purchased a house and invested in a neighborhood only to find that a business is wanting to expand into the neighborhood which will lower property values.

A quick look at Google Earth shows plenty of off street residential parking her house with most having garages to park cars in. The street doesn't belong to individuals and anyone can park there. I wouldn't live near a major road if it bothered me to have people park in front of my house. It looks like we have a difference of opinion and we won't see eye to eye on this."

Mike & Rosie's Deli makes fantastic sandwiches. The Summer Arts Festival is free and usually books good entertainment (just bring a lawn chair!)   Someone mentioned the Westcott House, and it's an interesting tour. There's a nice new ice rink. When it's warm, the city hosts a lot of functions at City Hall (bands, food, etc)   There's a dog park. ""Wiggly Field"", heh. Buck Creek State Park has a large lake that can accommodate boats, has many picnic areas, and a beach. There's also a pair of bald eagles who have taken up residence there.  Kuss Auditorium books plenty of good shows. I saw Jake Shimabukuro there last year. If you're a golfer, Reid Park has a great course. (the North course, not the South). Hole 15 is one of the hardest I've ever seen.  On the negative side, they have an overabundance of rednecks, drug addicts, and people who suck at driving. Most of the bars who used to feature live music have either closed or stopped booking bands, the cheap pricks.   So there's good and bad just like everywhere else. I'll stay where I am though.

dayton,2w3088,iphone4Suser,11,Mon Feb 16 15:34:00 2015 UTC,Troy and Tipp City are good towns with plenty of apartment options. They are in the middle of your work and grocery choices and are one of the more affordable locations in the area. I have personally rented apartments and owned a house in those cities.
dayton,2w3088,IWishIWereFishing,1 point,Mon Feb 16 16:23:02 2015 UTC,"I second Tipp and Troy. I have grown up in Tipp. Nice homey community, great schools. Walmart, Kroger and Target all within ~10-15 minutes, and a grocery in town as well. Troy is also a nice place to be. A little larger, few more restaurants and further way from Dayton. The Dayton area is great because you're a relatively quick drive from anything you'd want to go to. Except a beach, or mountains lol."
dayton,2w3088,empiredude,5,Tue Feb 17 03:45:38 2015 UTC,Sidney is ~ 40 minutes north of Dayton. You might want to consider looking at areas in the north of Dayton like Vandalia and Englewood. You'd be closer to work but not too far from Dayton itself. You'd also avoid downtown traffic on your commute and be closer to the airport.
dayton,2w3088,Dr_Winston_O_Boogie,1 point,Mon Feb 16 16:03:54 2015 UTC,Yes I am considering apartment options in north of Dayton. Basically in and around the intersection of I75 and 70
dayton,2w3088,mission_transition,6,Tue Feb 17 10:14:19 2015 UTC,"I agree with the advice already given....Vandalia, Englewood, Troy or Tipp would be better choices than Dayton proper."
dayton,2w3088,iam8up,3,Mon Feb 16 18:06:41 2015 UTC,Troy is 20 minutes from Sidney and Dayton.  There are many options here.  Are you looking for yourself or a family?  What size place?

dayton,2w3088,Anne657,1 point,Tue Feb 17 01:43:44 2015 UTC,Look at Troy. It is a good compromise between commute and amenities. Tipp and Vandalia are good for similar reasons.  Don't rule out Sidney altogether. It is nice if you are going to purchase a home -- our house was easily 30% cheaper than similar homes in Montgomery or sothern Miami counties. A five minute daily commute with a 40 minute trip 4-5 times a month is cheaper and gives you a lot more time with the family.
dayton,2w3088,wheresmyshiba,1 point,Wed Feb 18 00:14:04 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, Dayton is not very close to Sidney in terms of commute, which could be 45 minutes to an hour depending on traffic. But on the other hand, south of Dayton (Miamisburg/Centerville area) has two Indian grocery stores, Shree-G on Lyons and Bombay Bazaar on 725. I'm not as familiar with north Dayton or Sidney, but I think those two might be your only options for the area unless you want to drive to Columbus or Cincinnati.  If you're okay with a longer commute, there are lots of apartment choices in Miamisburg along 741 south of Dayton Mall that are close to 75, only 5-10 minutes drive to the Indian grocery stores and larger stores like Meijer, Target and WalMart. I believe there's a small Indian community in this area as well.   Preserve at Sagebrook Apartments Hunters Chase Apartments Hidden Lakes Apartments Conifers Apartments   I don't have any personal experience with any of these places, but I'm familiar with the neighborhood. Feel free to message me if you have any questions! :)"
dayton,2w3088,ZapfBrannigan,1 point,Mon Feb 16 21:18:38 2015 UTC,"A good estimate for distance is 1 mile per minute (when you factor in highway vs city speeds).  Vandalia is I-75 exit 63, and the main Sidney exit is 92[*], giving you at least a half hour commute each way. I-75 between Sidney and Piqua/Troy tends to have some issues when winter weather strikes, so consider that as well.  If you only need to go to the grocery store once a week or so, it may make more sense as far as gas consumption and sanity to live closer to Sidney.  I wouldn't recommend living around or south of downtown, but there are some newer apartment complexes north of town off exit 94.  Sidney has several groceries, including a Walmart.  Troy (20 min south) has a Meijer (which tends to have a larger international section than most places), and Dayton would be 45 minutes to an hour to get to, depending on which part (which if you only had to do once or twice a week wouldn't be so bad).  The tradeoff is there isn't a lot of Indian people or restaurants up that way.  Most restaurants in Sidney/Piqua/Troy are chain American (and the obligatory hometown Mexican place).  And depending on if your wife plans to get a job, she may have more opportunities closer to Dayton, making it more favorable to live a little farther south.  Just some things to consider.  [*] Exit numbers correspond with the mile markers, in case you didn't catch that."

dayton,2w05kx,kennedysleftnut,2,Sun Feb 15 20:48:32 2015 UTC,Canal Public House has 'co-op night' on Tuesdays and it is effectively their open mic. Once had a two or three week wait to get on the list though I'm not sure it is that way anymore.  South Park Tavern's open mic is on Wednesday and signups are on their website. Spots are generally filled up a week in advance and there is often a decent sized listening audience though not always.   I've played Trolly Stop's and Blind Bob's open mics on Thursdays but wouldn't recommend those unless you simply want a stage to stand on with a mic as it has been my experience that no one is generally listening. Show up that night to sign up for those two.   There are others of course and most are advertised in the free Dayton City Paper that rolls out every Tuesday all around town. I'm partial to SPT's open mic and met my current bandmates there. We still play (as a three piece now) almost every Wednesday. There's a showcase there Friday Feb 27 highlighting some of the artists who cut their teeth at open mic and now play regular gigs.  Also check out Todd the Fox on FB. I believe he's started back up his weekly 'Your Song Here' show that is essentially an open mic but with the option of having him and a drummer and bass player back you up. It bounced around a couple different venues last year but is a lot of fun if you're comfortable playing with others.  Good luck.

Wind mills have seen some success north and northwest of Dayton.  Are you looking to optimize your overall savings or just interested in solar?  Money in this area is usually best spent on insulation, windows, doors, infiltration reduction, HVAC, and appliance improvements.  If you want referrals for any of those things or a good electrician, I am familiar with quite a few in the area."
dayton,2vqbc0,erethenn,3,Fri Feb 13 10:08:10 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply. Actually, I have a home in Greene County that I only occupy during the summer. The rest of the year it's empty.

dayton,2vqbc0,DrStephenFalken,2,Fri Feb 13 10:28:27 2015 UTC,It's my understanding the panels will need replaced long before you make the money back that you paid for them.  We have maybe another decade before this tech becomes viable.
dayton,2vqbc0,dsteele713,3,Sat Feb 14 02:14:13 2015 UTC,"Normally, I would agree with you. In a normal used every day home you're right. But OP is a special circumstance IMO. The home isn't going to be used for 9 months. That's nine months of the minimum powering being used if at all. OP is in a good spot to sell a bunch of electricity back.   At the very worst OP sells power back and it ends up in the long run being a discount on his purchase price then it's worth it.   For example (all theoretical numbers) buy the panels for $15k over 20 years sell $700 back annually to the company. Use only solar power in the summer while there. Then you only spent $1k for the panels and electricity. Far less then you would spend buying power all year for the home over 20 years. Also they add value to the home. So if OP goes to sell. Then he may make a profit on the panels depending on the buyer."

dayton,2vqbc0,phanza,2,Fri Feb 13 21:14:59 2015 UTC,To be honest even in your usage case It isn't worth it In my opinion. Cause for one cost upfront is huge. Secondly you still will have an electric bill for just them to keep the service ran to your place. You'd be essentially paying a few thousand dollars to save a few hundred a year. You would better off having the power shutoff and paying the one time fees each time then having the panels.

Really will vary depending on exactly where you end up, Although there is a dedicated trail route by the base to the larger trail network. (The regional network has 300+ miles of trail.)

dayton,2vjvda,ThomasCleopatraCarl,3,Thu Feb 12 15:50:38 2015 UTC,"They are close to the main bus stop... Which is good and bad.    So some of this is personal issues, others are apartment issues.  I move every 6 months for my job so I was not able to physically go and look at the place before hand.. It was blind renting.     I put a deposit down on an apartment.  One of the larger Kettering layouts.  A week later, they called to tell me they made a mistake and  had given the apartment to someone else even though I had put down the deposit.  Told me I was sol and that I could take a smaller model and this was good bc it would save me money! No.  Sorry... I don't care about the money I want the bigger apt. They told me I could either take it or leave it.  Being on a time crunch... I went ahead and took the smaller apt.   I personally hated the layout.  Just straight back.. Reminded me of a trailer in a way.  There was also a large pole in the middle of one of the bedrooms... I could barely fit my bed and dresser in there comfortably.  Small closet space, no storage space (for sheets and towels)  The big floor to ceiling Windows are kinda cool... But extremely drafty.. Also, mine were facing another building and alleyway...  During the summer... There were constantly people in the alleyway at night... Potentially hooker types.  Someone definitely got stabbed one night.   I am pretty sure every weekend I heard at least one instance of a firecracker or gun shot...  Constantly being asked for change when I leave the building.   Paper thin walls.... I could hear conversations on the room next door.   Maintenance was a joke.  When I moved in, the dishwasher didn't work.  Had to call 3 times before it would 'run'  gave up bc most of the time the dishes were not clean so I just had washed them. They never fixed my ice maker, one sink drained slowly... And the knob on my washer broke twice.  Both times had to wait days for them to repair. The door lock was always 'tricky'  to open.  I personally hated grocery shopping.  If you parked in the back lot ($30/month from outside company) you could either walk around the building or go up and down a set of stairs to get in the building.   The front door does not have stairs but even from the bus station you would have to walk around.  (this was a problem when I used one of those personal cart thing- this is more of a convenience issue ;)  Carpet was low quality and just.. Idk.  I didn't like it.  Many of the light bulbs provided were a specialty type.  Also general lack of Central lighting.  There were lights along the hallway, in the bathrooms, and the special over the cabinet ones in the kitchen.   Not a whole lot of cabinet space... And one of the cabinets was difficult to put things in and out of bc it's right over the bar... And the doors don't open to 180 degrees.  If I would hop up on the counter I could reach the whole cabinet.   When my Internet was plugged into the living room, the signal would not reach my bedroom so I had to put a wireless router half way down the hell to get wireless down there.     That's what I have for now.... Some of these things might not bother you at all... But they were all issues for me! Feel free to ask any questions you have! I did not check out the landing so I could not say.    Other people I worked with lived in Beavercreek and liked it there but I don't know anything about short term lease... Sorry :/"
dayton,2vjvda,chemcalfarmr,1 point,Thu Feb 12 18:36:17 2015 UTC,"I just checked out a Kettering over the weekend... Did your neighbors share your sentiments? Also, if your neighbor's TV was on could you hear it from your bedroom?"
dayton,2vjvda,wegottops,2,Mon Feb 23 14:37:39 2015 UTC,I honestly don't know.   I am somewhat of a shy person so I tend to not talk to my neighbors!   As for hearing their TV... No.   Did you visit St.  Clair lofts yet? I had a two bedroom and slept in the bedroom furthest away from the living room... So I couldn't hear their TV when I was in my bedroom... But then again I doubt they had a TV in their bedroom.  I could hear their dog barking from somewhere in the apt and also their bed squeak and such when they were in the bedroom.    Hope this helps!

dayton,2tv90l,Mougli-SherKhan,6,Tue Jan 27 18:42:30 2015 UTC,"I moved here 18 months ago from California where there are no townships, and this whole township vs city thing confused me (and still does, to some extent) greatly.  A lot of my example are going to come from Centerville/Washington Township just because that is where I live, but this is the basic explanation, and if anyone else knows better, please correct anything that is wrong:  Geographically, if you live in the city of Beavercreek, you also live in Beavercreek Township.  Parts of Fairborn and Xenia are also in Beavercreek Township.  Then there are parts of Beavercreek Township that are only in the township (unincorporated) and are not a part of any other city.   A township (the kind of we have in Ohio, it is different in other states) is a subdivision of a county.  It is governed by a board of trustees; there is no mayor.  A township provides its residents various services and a local government, but its government is still part of the county.    A city can incorporate an area of land.  A city has its own government that is independent from the county.  It has more control over its affairs and in Ohio it can impose an income tax on its residents.  It can have its own police force, utility services, etc and just all around more control over public works compared to a township.    If a township is entirely incorporated (like Kettering and Huber Heights), it essentially dissolves.  Here are examples of how the services work in Centerville/Washington Township:   City of Centerville residents pay 1.75% income tax The township and the city each have their own respective zoning and planning boards/commissions Centerville has its own trash and recycling pickup, township residents have to arrange their own through private companies Both share the Washington Township Recreation Department (city doesn't have its own) Share fire department City has its own police force, township uses county sheriff Parks district run by township Separate leaf collection Separate snow removal"

The city wanted it torn down and bundled with a surrounding lot to sell to Krogers (IIRC), but some historical preservationists fought them for almost a decade over the building.  The end result was the building was torn down, Krogers backed out, and the lot is still empty 5 years later. During this decade stalemate, the entire area went to crap because everyone thought their homes were going to be bought.  A lose-lose-lose for everyone. At least Dayton isn't painting art the front of abandoned buildings anymore."
dayton,2tpmtt,FishBoneFredd,3,Mon Jan 26 15:48:08 2015 UTC,"They knocked down the Wyoming Theater at about the same time.  That one, however, was probably too small/decrepit to use for anything on its own. Even if you'd bought the houses on either side- and whose to say the owners would sell?- you'd have just had a tiny building with some pretty tile.  ...but I loved driving by that place, and I sorta wanted to refurb it into a residence of some sort."
dayton,2tpmtt,Captain_Trigg,2,Mon Jan 26 16:17:13 2015 UTC,"The Ecki building was the same. A fire gutted it years prior and it was one strong wind from falling down. My memories are a bit fuzzy, but I think the owner owed a lot of cash in back taxes, too.  It was a bad case for all involved."

dayton,2tpmtt,HeresTheThingGracie,18,Sat Feb 7 10:41:47 2015 UTC,"Look, I'm all for saving the Arcade as much as the next person.  I live downtown. I love walking by it, looking through the glass, wishing it would open again.  You can't reasonably expect a city to ""save"" all of these vacant, historic buildings, or any vacant building for that matter, if the inhabitants and surrounding population refuses to come downtown and spend their money.  So, I'd like to ask the author, when was the last time he left his southern suburb to come have dinner downtown? Catch a show? Bought something from a local shop?    Dayton has done a phenomenal job trying to get businesses and schools to invest in the downtown area, and has seen some remarkable success in the area's rejuvenation.  But you can't expect this success to continue unless people come back to the city to spend their money.  And you can't save the buildings without the people."
dayton,2tpmtt,riiight_meow,5,Mon Jan 26 15:20:17 2015 UTC,"I agree.  Considering the scale of the abandoned buildings, Dayton does a decent job, but more can be done (easier said than done). Each building is it's own special case with years of problems wrapped up in it.   The issue is much deeper than some banker in NY. I would love if all the buildings could be saved, but that's impossible. The preservation groups are noble, but those ideas can be harmful to the community, too. Take the Ecki building that was on Wayne and Wyoming. No one won that battle but the surrounding community suffered.  I'm not saying those preservation groups are bad. I would like to see a little more forethought before trying to save a condemned building that would take more to remodel/refit than building a new structure twice the size of the original."

Also, this probably won't be a popular opinion, but I think one of the factors keeping growth down in Dayton is the city's high municipal income tax rate."

dayton,2tpmtt,collsers,3,Wed Jan 28 18:31:33 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Every few weeks it seems another Buzzfeed article about the old Cincinnati public library makes the rounds on facebook and reddit, and everyone bemoans that it was torn down. What the articles fail to mention is  that the building was literally crumbling from the inside out, because the stacks space was built of iron that was too heavy for the building to support. Add in that it was a public library where none of the books were accessible to anyone with mobility problems, and demolition was really the only solution.   It would be great if these old buildings could be preserved, or transformed to new uses. But the fact of the matter is that it is much, much more expensive to retrofit and restore a building that has laid vacant than to construct something new."
dayton,2tpmtt,sethstorm,1 point,Mon Jan 26 16:29:49 2015 UTC,"Not exactly the best excuse to erase history though.  For those that have gone full-speed to erase history (UD aside), I doubt they have much connection to the city.   Regarding the NCR buildings: Building 26: Torn down after a UD alumna gave the words Curran wanted.  Never mind that actual history happened there. Building 29: Burnt itself down in the late 1970's-early 1980's. Building 30: Torn down due to asbestos issues. Building 31: The current Cox Media Center. Livery building:  Torn down to make way for the Media Center. EMD4: Repainted to match UD livery.  Was part of a larger building that was demolished. Old River: Closed off for indeterminate reasons, small portion given to shut up Oakwood critics.  May open in a more restricted-than-NCR form. NCR Headquarters: Curran's trophy (as seen in UD's own alumni magazines).    Exact building numbers may be off.  If someone has one of the older diagrams, link them."
dayton,2tpmtt,scienceonly,1 point,Mon Jan 26 19:30:04 2015 UTC,Old River Park is owned by UD and going through extensive renovations to make it okay for their insurance (no drunken students falling into the moat) and remains locked up unless there's a kayaking class or something similar going on.
dayton,2tpmtt,sethstorm,1 point,Mon Jan 26 20:06:13 2015 UTC,"While I wouldn't count it out, I'm not so sure that it'd be drunken students, but the occupants from the ""Red Barn"" nearby.  It's quite far from nearly all student housing, while UDRI and such are right within stumbling distance of the moat.  I'd like to think that it's liability, but that excuse wears thinner if they have no problem giving a chunk off to mollify Oakwood.  If it wasn't so close to other buildings, I'm surprised that they didn't try to hand the whole thing.  I still stand by my above explanations."
dayton,2tpmtt,scienceonly,1 point,Wed Jan 28 18:02:16 2015 UTC,UD wants it because they want sheer land mass.  There's a fence around it because of their insurance.
dayton,2tpmtt,sethstorm,1 point,Thu Jan 29 03:14:59 2015 UTC,"Old River park was severely reduced while NCR AT&T still owned the property for insurance reasons. When NCR sold off the property Old River transferred to the NCR retirees association where they tried to turn it into a park and charge admission.    Aside from one event, the place has remained closed. The only change made was for UD to signify that it was still closed and to offer Oakwood the land equivalent of hush money.  Just out of spite, I'd be more than happy to have paid the fee just to visit Old River.     Last I heard that was still the case, though its not that nice of a park (the Five Rivers Metroparks are MUCH nicer, and free).   From words of someone that never was there.     The properties that have been demolished are now being used for actual productive purposes either building new buildings, or using the land for UD's extracurriculars.    Such as giving UD students a direct path to GE while requiring Wright State students to go through an intermediary like CBTS (with no certainty of a direct job, but the non-certainty as a contract hire).   Don't get me wrong, I value Dayton history. But we shouldn't be holding back Dayton's much needed economical advancement because some of these buildings once held a special place for someone decades ago... Its time to look to the future.   If you want me to agree on somewhere in need of demolition, then can it be the Fairgrounds?  Of all the things to remove, it would be much higher on the list to convert into something more useful.    On the other hand, you're doing it wrong if you have Turner, the community in general, and other UD alumni to join the existing interested parties already against you - despite whatever words may come from UD spokespersons.    That said, has UD ever lost a controversy between them and the greater community around them?"
dayton,2tpmtt,sethstorm,1 point,Thu Jan 29 12:08:21 2015 UTC,"For what its worth the park was open to NCR employees and families.    That puts me in the latter category.  Unlike many, I had legitimate access and enjoyed it.   Ive been there times. It was a dump, outside of cutting the grass it went completely unmaintained by NCR.    Thank AT&T for that one, since it wasn't always that way.  Until the merger or thereabouts, that place rivaled the larger city parks.  If not for UD's Manifest Destiny for NCR land in the way, Oakwood would have had a good shot at improving it.  AT&T messed things up through the merger, the City of Dayton contributed to NCR's departure, and UD thought that history wasn't important enough to preserve (to the point of where they pit alumni against each other).   The Metroparks are by far much nicer than Old River park.   Unlike more than a few of the Metroparks, Old River is in a relatively low-crime area.  Beyond that, an accurate comparison of Old River would require a (non-UD) restoration."
dayton,2tpmtt,thisisnotaworkacct,3,Fri Jan 30 18:08:50 2015 UTC,The main problem with old building is are they economically viable.  In most cases they are not.  Another problem is people want to save everything and something just aren't very historic.

You start at the YMCA in Xenia, head east and then loop around and come back.  It's both on bike path and roads.  Not the most picturesque race but it's well supported and inexpensive.  Also, the full marathon is the oldest active marathon in Ohio.  If you wait until the fall, the Dayton River Corridor Half Marathon is definitely worth running.  It starts in Moraine and is mostly on the Great Miami bike trail.  I would also recommend checking out some of the other races that ORRRC puts on during the year.  They are of differing lengths (from 1 mile up to 50) and most are free with a membership to the club.  Happy running!"

I think they quoted about $500 to extend a gas line 15 feet thru a wall and such.  Also, if you plan to install the furnace on your own - check with the Kettering inspector before venturing on that - any HVAC work requires an inspection and permit, which will cause problems if not done when you goto sell the home.  On that note - also check with HVAC companies to install just the line. Brockman is a good one to start with."

dayton,2sxfaj,BKGPrints,9,Mon Jan 19 16:15:34 2015 UTC,"The thing I question.. is the articles previously mention they've shelled out THOUSANDS to this neighbor already, and jack shit has been done.  What happens when they give the neighbor more money and nothing happens?   Why didnt they use the 15k and hire a real estate lawyer to begin with, instead of just letting the neighbors handle it?

dayton,2sxfaj,Chouette4u,3,Mon Jan 19 23:05:17 2015 UTC,Sooooo...have they bothered getting the police involved? Sounds like there's plenty of evidence to suggest the neighbors are actively preventing you from accessing your home. I'm not sure about the laws on the situation but it sounds like a criminal case at this point. You can also present your various efforts to make payments and their continuous refusal to accept your offers.  Apparently you guys have taken some legal steps but I think you need to talk to the cops or a lawyer more. Your neighbors aren't very far off criminal actions.

dayton,2sxfaj,didnotwanttoregister,3,Tue Jan 20 03:05:14 2015 UTC,"Shared driveways usually exist because it's impossible or very difficult to create a separate one for one of the properties.  Then there is an easement in place to allow passage through one neighbor's property so the other neighbor can access the street.  In this situation, both properties border the street, but the creek runs through them which might be what necessitated the shared driveway.  Creating a new one might be impossible or would likely cost a lot more than $13k."
dayton,2sxfaj,DrStephenFalken,7,Tue Jan 20 12:41:10 2015 UTC,"If there isn't an easement and they want to act as if they don't have to let the Clarks pass through, then the neighbors aren't in any position to ask for any money.  But there is just no way those houses have existed since the 60s and been sold multiple times without an easement in place for the driveway.     showing that any other option is impossible.   Even if there is another option, if there is an easement, it's literally their RIGHT to pass through the neighbor's property.    I don't disagree that there is another side of the story. The Clark's are responsible for their half whether they have the money or not.  This blockading and possible overspending business is more questionable."
dayton,2sxfaj,TheLuckyMrsD,6,Tue Jan 20 03:02:21 2015 UTC,"I pulled their deed, and they definitely have an easement for egress through the neighbor in question's property.  They also curiously took out a second mortgage for $30,000 in September...but for some reason they haven't mentioned that on their GoFundMe page."
dayton,2sxfaj,jvoosh,2,Tue Jan 20 03:31:58 2015 UTC,Seems like they made a HUGE mistake buying the house in the first place.   The easement would have been the first red flag. The 2nd Mortgage is ultra suspicious.

dayton,2sxfaj,MashedPeas,5,Tue Jan 20 03:53:37 2015 UTC,shared driveways usually exist because it's cheaper for the contractor to build one bridge    FTFY. I worked construction in the past. Things like this are because the contractor was being cheap.
dayton,2sxfaj,theWgame,6,Tue Jan 20 04:10:48 2015 UTC,"In this particular case, I think it's because there is not proper visual clearance on their property for the township to grant their own driveway apron."

There are still some areas here and there that I don't have a good data connection, but it's much better now than it was a couple years ago.  Over all I'm satisfied with Sprint.  (I've only ever had Sprint so can't compare to other carrier's service but I'm sold on unlimited data)."
dayton,2siy2y,deshende,2,Thu Jan 15 16:30:43 2015 UTC,"Cool, thanks for the reply. So what happens if you're in rural Ohio and roaming. Do you get a certain amount if roaming minutes or do you have to pay if you're roaming?"
dayton,2siy2y,deshende,1 point,Thu Jan 15 16:52:27 2015 UTC,What I was told is roaming calls count against your minutes.  All plans are probably worded different but on my plan there are certain kind of calls that don't count against minutes (cell to cell calling for example).  I'm still kind of fuzzy on how roaming data works so I try to avoid using that.

The only place we go where I get no service at all is the Hocking Hills area in eastern Ohio. And, for some reason, inside the Boonshoft Museum :) .   I would definitely recommend Virgin Mobile for anyone who doesn't talk on the phone a lot and has moderate data use - $35/month unlimited talk and data (though they slow data if you use too much - I've never gone over but it wouldn't be good for someone who watches a lot of movies on their phone) with no contract. You do have to buy your own phone."

In my experience, verizon has the best coverage. However T-Mobile has 90% of the same coverage if you stay nearby/south of 70, for much less $$. You can get unlimited talk & text & 3 GB data for $50/month. My wife and I switched over after we got quite tired of Verizon's customer support, and 2 years later still think it was a great decision (and have saved $1000 overall)."

What kind of people hang out there?: Different kinds of people, I've seen all age groups represented.  They have bands some nights so that will attract different crowds depending on the music.  Are children allowed at certain hours?: Yes, kids are allowed, I've seen them many times for dinner with families, but keep in mind it's a bar so earlier might be better.  Anything else?: It's been a while for me, but Mondays used to be half price pizza there.  It's a nice little place but can fill up quickly some nights.  Also they have bubble hockey."

Anything else?:  This place is just beautiful.  They'll be celebrating their first anniversary this weekend and have already made huge plans for distribution.  Special-release brews are sold out in days.  The place is almost always packed every single night it's open.  The staff are so helpful and courteous, and there's always growlers to be taken home.

Are children allowed at certain hours?: Yes. Kid friendly, for a bar. I see kids in there every time I go, but you'll get some patrons who get a little sloshy. I've been a regular for a decade and never seen it get rowdy.  Other: Wonderful staff. Locally owned. You'll see the owner working the bar most of the time. They do have a small kitchen, so if the place is packed (which it's not very big), service can be a bit slow. Prices are very reasonable. My wife and I can eat and drink (craft beer) for $35 vs. the same meal and less beer at BWW (or similar) for $50+.  edit: format"

They also allow you to bring in whatever food you want or order from the nearby restaurants. Pappa's Pizza next door will bring your food right to your table inside.  What kind of people hang out there?: People who love craft beer.

A lot of cities are facing people wanting to demolish mid-20th century buildings for new development, but hideous though some of this architecture may be (especially brutalist architecture, like the convention center), its mere existence tells a story of our past. Between 20th century ""urban renewal"" projects and highway construction, cities lost a lot of character neighborhoods and downtowns in a short time, and they're probably wise to use historic overlays to keep buildings from being lost on a whim.  That being said, this is probably mostly about trying to get the tax incentives, as everyone knows that office towers are money pits."

dayton,2rvtyk,OHKID,1 point,Sat Jan 10 22:36:04 2015 UTC,"If I had a few million laying around, I'd be leveraging that in a way that opens up Old River.  Have a partnership between UD, Oakwood, and Dayton that opens the park up beyond the existing Oakwood property.  Ideally, develop it back into something that attracts year-round residents as well as students to UD - even if it means rebuilding the pool.    If things go well enough, go for the gold and make cash offers on the Red Barn until UD relents."
dayton,2rvtyk,sethstorm,1 point,Mon Jan 12 01:15:04 2015 UTC,"Not surprised in the least.  One unusual historical building decision deserves another.   This is the same city that had UD summoning their alumni, the Earth and beyond to ensure that a historical building would not receive a formal declaration.  Never mind how much of the original building still stood, it would only take one overly friendly firm in Indianapolis to help erase history1.  1: Not completely erased, but who's going to notice a few bricks in a back corner of a museum?"

dayton,2robyd,MTGothmog,2,Thu Jan 8 00:53:51 2015 UTC,"There definitely was. See, it was originally a legit aquatic club, then it became something else. There was a swingers bar less than a mile down the road at the same time. My friends converted the Swim Club into a restaurant in '03. It was actually a Greek supper club, and the band members lived in those rooms you see. The rooms were actually upstairs and the pool was downstairs. The first room he shows was downstairs though. Servers did their silverware rolls etc in there. Became a strip club in '04, and they were busted for prostitution later in the year. Now it is a strip club called The Harem. The tables actually were over the original pool that was filled in with concrete in '03."
dayton,2robyd,mynameisnonsequitur,6,Wed Jan 7 22:38:06 2015 UTC,"Well where this video is from is not the Harem. The Harem biulding was a PADI certified scuba diving school, named CJ's if I remember correctly, that did indeed have a very deep pool for classes. The building in the video is from further down Dixie Drive right across from the cop shop. (You can see it on the left in the begining of the video) Source: I was a northridge kid that grew up riding my bike around all the strip clubs, massage parlars, and swinger clubs in the area. Also I was certified as an open water diver at CJ's scuba I 1984 when I was 13. I think ITs is still there which can place the video as well."
dayton,2robyd,paulmoody,3,Wed Jan 7 22:45:19 2015 UTC,"Yes, CJ's...the swingers club was the Swim Club. You're totally right! We filled in CJ's pool. The whole IT thing threw me off at the beginning as that was across the street. Thanks for correcting me. Yes, very deep pool that took a lot of concrete. I think it was called C&J Scuba if I remember."
dayton,2robyd,joliedame,4,Wed Jan 7 23:05:39 2015 UTC,That was it! C&J scuba. Christ thats been a while.

dayton,2rompu,HammerCurls,3,Thu Jan 8 00:22:10 2015 UTC,"Have you considered other towns in the general area?  West Milton and Union are pretty close to the airport (10 mins north of Englewood).  They're both small towns with not much to offer, pretty rural, but usually have houses to rent rather than apartments.  Because it is in the ""country"" the lease terms tend to be a bit more open because people out this way tend to have dogs, cats...  my neighbors have Llamas in their front yard and they rent.  There's also Brookville a touch further west and Tipp City east of   Milton and Union (still rural) and  have more apartments and houses to rent...  the rent for houses in these areas tend to be on par with what you'd find in places like Kettering and Beavercreek for a 1 to 2 bedroom apartment.   Troy is about 20 minutes north, still kinda rural but have all the amenities that you'd get in the suburbs (restaurants, Meijer, Walmart, Kohls, gym, good schools) and a few apartment communities that may be better accommodating for dogs.  I'm a city girl, but got tired of the increasing crime and city drama, so I moved to the country back in March.  My general expenses, blood pressure, and car insurance all went down.  Some lifestyle changes were needed (still are, my hatchback coupe isn't adequate in this weather) like making scheduled trips to the grocery and not being able to run out to any given fast food joint on a moments notice and friends don't visit often, but the peace of mind makes it worth it."
dayton,2rompu,HeresTheThingGracie,2,Thu Jan 8 00:25:06 2015 UTC,I have looked but haven't had much luck finding much. Where would you suggest? I'd be completely ok with living in a more rural part. I'm not picky.

I thought the crime had gone down a lot?"
dayton,2rompu,brandilion,1 point,Thu Jan 8 18:10:43 2015 UTC,"Yes.  I lived near Children's Medical Center.  My car insurance was outrageous, and my agent said it was all because of living in the city.  When I moved into Miami County it dropped probably 25%.  I'm a runner, and I never felt comfortable running downtown.  I would drive into Kettering and Oakwood to run.  A friend of mine - I won't say what he does but works closely with police - specifically told me not to run in the neighborhood I lived in.  The only place near downtown that I felt any sense of ok with was near UD, and that was because there's cops around there all the time.

So I don't scare easy, at the same time I won't put myself in a place of possible opportunity for shit to happen.  I guess the nail in the coffin for me on downtown was when I watched the decline of Wayne Ave and Smithville.  That area always stayed fairly decent, as the border between Kettering and Dayton.  As I watched criminal element work it's way up Wayne and Wilmington and into Kettering, I noped the hell out of the city."

dayton,2rc7dj,2rideascooter,25,Mon Jan 5 21:05:57 2015 UTC,"Couldn't come to a lease agreement, a.k.a. The Greene has had enough douches throwing up on the sidewalks."
dayton,2rc7dj,DrStephenFalken,14,Sun Jan 4 23:38:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah I'm not one to judge. But Adobe Gilas was the worst part of the green. It was very much a ""bro"" place and was a very nasty bar. I can't think of any bar that I dislike except for that one. I never went in there and had a good time."
dayton,2rc7dj,geekygirly,6,Sun Jan 4 23:39:58 2015 UTC,The WPAFB security information for the Dayton area specifically called out adobe's as a place base employees shouldn't visit. Because of the fights and drug arrests.
dayton,2rc7dj,airrore,3,Mon Jan 5 01:14:34 2015 UTC,They were right to do that.   ...calls to 78 Plum St. average four times the number of calls per year of any bar in downtown Dayton. It’s also believed to be among the most in the Miami Valley.
dayton,2rc7dj,Ericovich,0,Mon Jan 5 06:04:48 2015 UTC,"...which is funny because other than being a ""bro"" bar its not really that bad compared to a LOT of the places out there. It was just kind of grungy for the Greene's upper-middle-class aesthetic.   I always saw a lot of base people at W.O. Wrights when I went to WSU."
dayton,2rc7dj,DrStephenFalken,2,Mon Jan 5 18:40:03 2015 UTC,"I prefer the Oregon for drinking but I love a good dive bar and Adobes was really a shit ran bar. It was dirty, had bad customer service, people looking to fight or get black out drunk are the only ones who seem to visit it. I've had some great times in some really bad places. Adobes wasn't one of them. I went 5ish times because some out of town friends would want to experience all of the greene. I tried to be objective every time and it never ended well for my group."
dayton,2rc7dj,geekygirly,2,Mon Jan 5 19:27:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I still went to adobe's when I wanted really really terrible cheap beer. It wasn't that bad.   WOs is a weird mix. Right after work, it's all base employees. Then 2 or 3 hours later, it's full of too many freshmen and awful live music. But still, it's better than Tuty's was when I was in undergrad."
dayton,2rc7dj,Ericovich,3,Mon Jan 5 19:07:17 2015 UTC,"Isnt Tutys the one that caught fire and re-built?  We'd sometimes hit One Eyed Jacks in that shopping center, but by the time my wife got her Masters we were in search of better drinking holes."
dayton,2rc7dj,geekygirly,3,Mon Jan 5 20:10:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's Tuty's. But one eyed is down further, by the nutter center. They have good sandwiches and are a great place to grab a beer before walking over to a concert. But it's definitely not my kind of place for grabbing a drink at night. Little too loud for my tastes"

dayton,2rc7dj,DrStephenFalken,1 point,Mon Jan 5 19:48:14 2015 UTC,When you bump into someone and they're wanting to fight. Large groups of dudes yelling and letting everyone know they have testosterone. Lots of dudes in popped collars and tapped-out shirts. You walk up to someone to talk they'll tell you to get out of their fucking face.   Compared to a nice bar where your bump into someone and apologize and that's that. You can walk up to and talk to nearly anyone. Everyone is friendly for the most part. The bar is clean no one is yelling all the time.

When they need volunteers: Usually weekdays  Why this place is good to volunteer for: You have to register to volunteer in advance so when you get there someone will already have a job prepared for you.

When they need volunteers: always  Why this place is good to volunteer for: in my situation (treat baker) it's ideal because I can bake the treats on my own time and post my hours. I am a student and also work part time, so it's difficult to find hours to volunteer sometimes, and my schedule is not always consist. Every week, Bonnie sends out an email letting the volunteers know what treats they need, and if your treat is on the list you bake! You also need to deliver them to the shelter or the market.  Regardless of what type of job you do for them, it's for a great cause and everyone I've met so far has been very kind.   https://www.hsdayton.org/get-involved/volunteer.html"
dayton,2rcxv5,Ericovich,6,Mon Jan 5 03:24:08 2015 UTC,I volunteered there for a summer as a teen.  Great place. I miss the wall of cats that would greet me hungrily every morning.
dayton,2rcxv5,kieratea,3,Mon Jan 5 12:19:19 2015 UTC,"Just wanted to add that HSGD is a good place to volunteer because there are so many different programs/volunteer opportunities.  It's fairly easy to find something that works for you no matter how much time you have to dedicate to volunteering.  Some people keep a specific schedule - coming in multiple days a week to kennel maybe, and some people just come in whenever it's convenient and socialize with the animals - walk dogs, play with kittens, brush bunnies.  Or you could foster, bake, teach classes, attend events... Lots and lots of options!  Also, kids 10 and up are allowed to volunteer (with a parent) so it's a good choice for families."
dayton,2rcxv5,Houndie,2,Mon Jan 5 13:56:01 2015 UTC,Do people of all ages volunteer there?  Would a mid-20s dude be out of place?
dayton,2rcxv5,crazyanne,3,Mon Jan 5 22:24:03 2015 UTC,I don't think so. If you wanted to be a baker you'd never really need to interact with other volunteers unless you wanted to. I can't really speak for other jobs since I've only been a baker.
dayton,2rcxv5,Houndie,2,Mon Jan 5 22:31:30 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your feedback!  I'd probably be looking for something with a bit more animal interaction, but I appreciate you getting back to me with what you know."

Due to the nature of the organization, this is also one of a few places that you can have sort of an immediate gratification for volunteering because you are usually working directly with people who need help."

If you don't have the time to help in person, they are always looking for people to organize donation drives or to host a giving angels tree/adopt a family during the holidays so there are some unique volunteer opportunities here."

Why this place is good to volunteer for:  This is one of my heart volunteer organizations although I can't drive as often as I would like!  If you're an animal lover, there is really nothing quite like being a part of a cross-country train of 50+ dogs all heading to new shelters and fosters and sometimes forever homes.  Plus, the dogs are always so grateful and the volunteer drivers are just like one big family.  It's hard to explain how exciting it is to get the email updates on Saturday morning as they head out from Missouri and make their way to you... then you continue to get updates after your leg of the drive until the dogs arrive at their final destinations.  Often the group posts updates and pictures on Facebook so you're really a part of the transport from start to finish.  It really is a very rewarding experience."

Why this place is good to volunteer for: because it feels good! :) Volunteers may participate in activities such as playing cards, reading the newspaper, painting nails, companionship and conversation with patients and families who are in the hospice program. This may come in the form of visiting someone in the evening after work or sharing coffee on the weekend, as examples. Each opportunity is different.

dayton,2qnx68,curmevexas,5,Mon Dec 29 00:46:27 2014 UTC,St. Charles in Kettering has a growing young adult group. They are doing 'spirits and spirituality' every month through the winter. They've been meeting at BW3's in Kettering. Pretty decent group.  BTW- Both priests there are great and give amazing sermons. One of them is a former engineer who decided to go into the priesthood in his late 30's or something. Worth checking out.
dayton,2qnx68,spice_taster,3,Mon Dec 29 12:48:45 2014 UTC,Have you tried Ascension?
dayton,2qnx68,rootbeerslam,3,Mon Dec 29 07:05:27 2014 UTC,"My husband and I are in our late 20s, and have been parishioners at Emmanuel for a few years now. It is a more traditional mass, but Father Angelo and Father Ken are great (the deacon, however....tries really hard, but just is not the best homilist). The music is also on point. The parish is about 33% old people, 33% young adults (most with children, but not all), 15% UD faculty and students, and 15% international Catholics (there are a number of Rwandans in the parish).  It is definitely the most diverse parish of the ones I have tried in the greater Dayton area.   Incarnation in Centerville does have an active young adult group, but I did not enjoy mass there. It's been a few years so I can't remember why, but we only gave it a few weeks before we decided to keep looking.    Our back-up parish (when the mass time at Emmanuel is not convenient--they only have one Sunday mass) is St Charles Borremeo in Kettering. Architecturally, it is not my style--there are no kneelers, so you stand during the eucharistic prayer--and the music is definitely of the kumbayah/Gather genre, but the priests are excellent and it's always well attended. From their bulletin, it seems to be a very active parish with a lot of activities for different groups."
dayton,2qnx68,collsers,1 point,Mon Dec 29 15:00:42 2014 UTC,"Ah, I like Deacon Baldwin. He may not have the friendly, personal touch of Father Angelo, but he gets and transmits orthodoxy. After a childhood of hand-holding hippy crap, it's nice to find clergy that take it seriously."
dayton,2qnx68,TheyShootBeesAtYou,2,Mon Dec 29 21:16:33 2014 UTC,"I like him, it's just that he tends to go a little heavy on the cute stories about a little boy named Johnny or Billy that he finds on the internet."
dayton,2qnx68,collsers,3,Mon Dec 29 21:36:10 2014 UTC,"Another single 20-something here.  Never been to it but I've heard that Immaculate Conception in Belmont has a young adult group.  The campus ministry at Wright State is pretty active. Masses are at 11a (every Sunday) and 630p (when classes are in session); the public is welcome. Jenna, who runs the office out there is a UD grad who seems to know what a lot of the area churches are up to; she'd be a good contact to have.  St. Peter in Huber Heights has like three priests and a deacon, so it must be somewhat active (compared to the many parishes around that have to share a priest with someplace else); and, their liturgies are fairly reverent.  I went to St. Anthony for a while—it's a nice community, but didn't feel like there was a lot of YA/single outreach.  On Thursdays when Theology on Tap isn't in session, there's a small related group called Catholic Life that meets at Panera Bread and studies saints, devotions, and that kind of stuff."
dayton,2qnx68,wheresmyshiba,6,Wed Dec 31 04:42:24 2014 UTC,"Might want to check out Theology on Tap. It's a young adult group that meets throughout the year for...well, theology and beer.   I find that the more orthodox churches tend to have more young adults then, say, the more Vatican II minded, kumbayah singalong churches, which trend more retired Baby Boomer. Check out Emmanuel if you want a well done, EWTN style Novus Ordo mass, or if you're feeling adventurous, Holy Family is a traditional Latin Mass parish, but the folks there don't come across as particularly immediately inviting."
dayton,2qnx68,TheyShootBeesAtYou,2,Mon Dec 29 01:03:10 2014 UTC,"Looks like ToT won't be happening again for another few months, and even then it's only 6 weeks. However, that might be a decent place to see where there is a good young adult community.  I'll check out Emmanuel (though I still mainly associate it with high school masses). Incarnation and St Francis in Centerville have some groups directed at young adults that looked good."
dayton,2qnx68,TheyShootBeesAtYou,3,Mon Dec 29 01:24:12 2014 UTC,I'll check out Emmanuel (though I still mainly associate it with high school masses).    CJ alumnus detected.

dayton,2qnx68,DoktorKruel,4,Sun Jan 4 06:16:34 2015 UTC,I would venture a guess that UD has either a church or at least a chapel that appeals to a younger audience.

dayton,2qnx68,collsers,2,Mon Dec 29 02:01:15 2014 UTC,"UD does have a chapel on campus, though it is currently closed for renovations (I believe it will reopen in late 2015 or early 2016). The mass there is pretty meh--it is definitely geared towards students, and the quality of the homilists varies greatly."
dayton,2qnx68,jimbolauski,2,Mon Dec 29 14:53:06 2014 UTC,"I almost feel you are talking about my church, St Luke, the Christmas homily was more repetitive then his usual, all his homilies follow that same pattern of repetition until the clergy is glossed over."
dayton,2qnx68,jayman288,3,Mon Dec 29 02:37:31 2014 UTC,"Nope. St. Albert, but I'll make a mental note to avoid St. Luke.  The priest seems nice enough, but he rambles even with it written down. He's admitted during a homily that people have told him to cut back on the length but he's going to continue to ignore their advice.  It's a shame really, the some of best homilies I ever ever heard were from an elderly priest who kept them under 3 minutes and could consistently finish a mass in 35 minutes. The 16+ minute homily from Christmas Eve had some good points but they were lost in Browns references and talking about bringing live cattle into the church (you could tell everyone was getting restless)."

If you are interested in Catholic churches specifically, the churches south of town have larger congregations for the most part so they are more likely to have dedicated funds for that kind of thing and will have a larger community to pull from. Immaculate Conception is neat because they have a contemporary mass on Sunday at 6pm. That and Father Satish is pretty cool. I haven't been to Incarnation in recent memory, but they were a really impressive church. St. Anthony's downtown and Our Lady of Rosary are probably two of the most beautiful churches in the city."

Because the law is the law. then we got a black mayor of beavercreek saying shit that his town isn't racists because the town has gone from 92 precent white to 88 percent.  About as dumb as the people that have called america post racial since we elected Obama. Yet in my very very white collar job I still hear who dislike him use racial epitaphs to make fun of him.

The kid had a troubled past and was killed during a robbery. In any logical synopsis of his life it would be stated, he had problems and they continued to get worse until he was eventually shot and killed during a robbery. That is what happened in his life, escalating violence and increasing consequences.  The largest, most violent, most destructive crime.. came at the end, but everyone says ""Oh he was getting better."" No, clearly not. He was at his worst, by definition, at the end.  People have to learn there are consequences to your behavior. Punch a cop, you might get killed. Rob a guy for shoes, you might get killed. Denial of facts doesn't help anyone.. he was killed making the worst decision of his life, and there were signs of bad decision making leading all the way up to that moment.  Some people are going to take issue with this statement, but even in death, his parents are saying his problems weren't that bad and getting better. Sad all around, but he was a child and his parents should have been more honest with themselves about his dangerous behavior and taken it more seriously."
dayton,2q4vnw,sick937,3,Tue Dec 23 16:05:36 2014 UTC,"I don't fault his parents and family for saying ""He was a good kid"", they obviously have blinders on, and let's face it, this young man was their child, of course they are going to speak highly of him in his passing.

They had heard that there had been a shooting, checking the news today, I see what it was about, and it is ridiculous.    Apparently the kid pulled what appeared to be a pistol on a man who had just purchased the shoes, unbeknownst to the teens, the man was carrying a concealed weapon, and didn't care much for the idea of being robbed for some sneakers."

I mean, I get that if you have your CCW you need to be ready to defend yourself with deadly force but shooting the robber in the back after your life is no longer imminently threatened just feels wrong to me. Don't misunderstand me, I have very little sympathy for a punk kid pulling a gun on some dudes at the symbol of suburban safety, but if I were the guy being robbed I wouldn't feel right about shooting them as they're getting away. It's just a pair of shoes.   Edit: My comment is based on a description of events provided to me from a Middletown citizen. After rereading this article and the initial WHIO article I'm having difficulty verifying the story as it was told to me and I'm starting to question my source's reliability."

dayton,2q813i,jimbolauski,2,Wed Dec 24 01:52:56 2014 UTC,The private club must be a nonprofit organization and the building must be free standing with no other business in it.
dayton,2q813i,RandomUser72,2,Wed Dec 24 02:00:35 2014 UTC,"No.  There were 2 types of smoking ban law that were voted on, one was a complete ban, one was a ban but private organizations could choose wether to adhere to it or not.  The second one came from a group that collected R. J. Reynolds as a sponsor, so people voted for the other one as it was not backed by ""big tobacco"".  What people didn't get, is RJR is also the largest donator to thetruth.com (the people with the gross commercials), American Cancer Society, and many other anti-smoking advocate groups.  The two laws were titled as ""Public Smoking Ban"", and ""Workplace Smoking Ban"" (One banned it in public, but not private, the other banned it wherever people are employed)  The ""Workplace Smoking Ban"" was the law that got voted in, states all business except privately owned homes, family owned businesses with no non-family workers, outdoor patios, designated areas of nursing homes, and some smoke shops.   Privately owned clubs are not exempt.  But since they are hard to enforce (not many inspectors, some of those clubs do not allow access to public i.e. members only), some clubs just ignore the law.    A bar I used to frequent kept a jar on the bar like a tip jar.  It was the smokers jar, you smoke, you donated.  Donations went to paying the fine if they got busted.  That went on for about 5 years until the bar sold to someone else and they banned smoking (btw, the new owner went out of business after 18 months due to lack of customers)  As far as Diamonds, I'm willing to bet if you lit up a cigarette, no one would care and someone would probably bring you an ashtray.  The question of whether it is legal is easy, no, it's not.  I just don't think they care.  There's only like 6 of these inspectors in the state, they usually only come out for complaints."

I really liked her the couple times I saw her, and a friend received a lot of help from her and a therapist in her practice named Tina (I think) regarding his depression and anxiety. In my experience, Brenda does not coddle her patients, so if you don't want a reality check or someone to tell you how it is without a lot of sugar coating, this probably won't be a good fit.

dayton,2pgyri,PRGuyHere,7,Tue Dec 16 14:36:15 2014 UTC,"You'll get a lot of people who say the City of Dayton is bad for families, but I disagree. I've lived in one of the historic districts for 13 years, our neighborhood has lots of kids, and everyone loves it here. If you want a renovated 100-year-old house, Grafton/McPherson Town (near the area he was considering) are great. Super close neighbors, lots of neighborhood gatherings, everyone looking out for each other. Almost all young-ish professionals, with a few old-timers who have been there through the good and bad decades. These neighborhoods also attract a certain kind of people - outdoorsy, involved in the community, social, into history, etc. And I feel very safe - we routinely walk the dog late at night without a second thought. I guess it depends on an individual's tolerance for ""characters"" - we like living in a neighborhood with a few goofy people in it. Over the time we've been in our house, most of the rough edges have been smoothed out (some drug activity, some shady renters, etc.). If you/he want to PM me I can point out some specific houses for sale to consider.   As far as the Dayton city schools, they are generally bad. We are looking at schools for my daughter right now, though, and think we have some decent choices. River's Edge Montessori is very popular with families in our neighborhood - their ""ranking"" numbers are low because they do have poor families and they also are the English as a second language school for the district, but our friends feel their kids are getting a great education there. We also have friends with kids in the Catholic schools, which we are going to consider, and also look at the Miami Valley School. If you love where you live, you can make the schools work.   If he wants to be super-duper-extra safe but still find a cool old house, Oakwood is probably the other place to look. You can find a great house for about $150, in a walkable neighborhood with lots of kids. Schools are outstanding. There are lots of great things about Oakwood, but we have chosen not to live there.... I grew up there, and did not want our daughter to have to deal with the rich-kid snobbery-based bullying and rigid social structures the kids in the schools impose on themselves (though perhaps these things have improved in the last 20 years).   Sorry, that was more that you probably wanted to know, but I love promoting the Dayton historical districts, and get annoyed at people bashing living in the city. There are parts you wouldn't want to live in, but the nicest historical districts are seriously great."

dayton,2pgyri,dermal_denticles,6,Wed Dec 17 14:37:52 2014 UTC,"Yeah, I have to agree with Chouette4u.  That area is getting nicer and nicer as more of those (admittedly amazing) houses are being renovated and the area is being gentrified, but it's still in the fifth district and still has Dayton Public Schools.  If I were childless I'd look at living there, as I know some folks who are very happy there and it looks like it's on the way up, but for kids and a family it's too close to Five Oaks for my taste. Sadly any of the areas that have the nice old houses are gonna be downtown and not as safe (South Park, St. Anne's Hill), the suburbs are mostly newer construction.

There are a number of wonderful neighborhoods in Dayton: the Oregon Historic District, St. Anne's Hill, Huffman Historic District, and Walnut Hills all have some very nice options.  Regarding schools, everyone loves to point out that the Dayton schools are horrible, however, there are many schools in the Dayton area take EdChoice vouchers, which are either based on income, or for any family who lives in a failing school district.

dayton,2pg07u,brandilion,2,Thu Dec 18 21:12:08 2014 UTC,Is it only at night or during the day too?    I read an article a while back about places/business that at night use high pitched noise that is out of the hearing range of most adults to deter kids/young adults from loitering around outside the business.  The reason given in the article was primarily excess trash being left outside the business and I think one incident of tagging but I could be wrong on that last part.  It was a year ago that I read the article.  My co-worker used to troll me at work this way.  He would play high pitched noises that no one else in the office could hear except for me.  At first he didn't believe that I could really hear it and he would play it randomly.  Then he decided it was funny and kept doing it for about a month.  He would only play it until I told him to knock it off at which point he would giggle like a mad man.

dayton,2p6c9d,Stephjephman,1 point,Thu Jan 15 20:37:45 2015 UTC,Any idea what they charge for catering? The more I try to find a good catering company the more I lean towards zombie dogs. They're delicious and probably more affordable than most.
dayton,2p6c9d,katelveis,1 point,Thu Jan 22 16:03:15 2015 UTC,Not really sure. I would just send them a Facebook message and ask :)

We ended up having our ceremony a Walnut Grove Country Club (her mom is friends with some members there) and it was beautiful.  We had our reception at the Arbor Hall and it went pretty well too."

Great building, great spaces, easy parking, easy to get to, cool outdoor spaces for photography (and you can easily sneak over to the DAI to take photos there too). And a big plus (at least when we got married 10 years ago) was how cheap it was compared to other places we looked. The food was good - not super fancy, but we didn't want to spook our families with anything too exotic anyway.   I'd also look at Cox Arboretum and the downtown Engineer's Club - we've been to very cool weddings at both those locations."

Masonic Center has a beautiful ballroom for receptions, and also has two other rooms, auditorium and a chapel of sorts on the third floor, for the ceremony.  Also can use a grand marble entrance or outside grounds for ceremony.  Memorial Hall has a gorgeous historical atrium, and a banquet hall in its basement.  Dayton Art Institute is also another gorgeous location; I have no experience with them myself but beware that they are usually booking at least a year and a half in advance.

The wedding I went to had the ceremony and reception in the same room with just a short mingling and drink hour for the chairs to be rearranged. Plus the ceremony was performed with the bride and groom on a balcony which was really cool and gave everyone a fair view of the ceremony, even in the back row :)   Not sure if that's standard or just for the one wedding I saw there, but I liked the place a lot!"

That, or ask my uncle who knows how to do framing to show me, and then help you. When were you planning on doing it? I get off work every day at 5:00, so I could help any time after that, and then all day on my days off. Is 10 dollar an hour ok?"

Dayton has some amazing eats,south park tavern, wheat penny,  cocos, olive an urban dive, etc.   The corn mazes are wicked fun in the fall.   Second Street market,  my god we loved that market on Saturday mornings for breakfast and grocery shopping.   AF museum.   Huffman prairie.

I have done this by myself but all of the women I have ever been with have never really been bus riders and I've always told them that I want to take them on a date just hop on the bus and ride it all day just to watch people but none of them have ever been about it. Now I have been married to my wife for a while and been with her for almost a decade and she was never a bus rider either. So I think that I should take my wife on a bus ride completely West completely east and back it'll be a hoot

The classes are small and the instructor asked me what I wanted out of the class and why I was taking it. I told her I wanted to feel more comfortable if I was out with the family and someone became belligerent and I felt I had to defend my family.  She catered the class to some common situations one can find themselves in.  I had a great time   and learned alot.  She had some basic cardio training in there which is important in a fight.  I'm starting back up after Christmas so if you go I'll probably see you there.  You don't have to join the gym to take the classes but pay for the class each time you take it.  Hope this helps.

dayton,2o5vcp,SleepyConscience,8,Wed Dec 3 16:00:40 2014 UTC,I don't have any suggestions for you but as a fellow TWC subscriber I'm curious...  What plan are you on that has a 5gb cap? I know they have been testing caps but wasn't aware they are active.
dayton,2o5vcp,SchmosWorld,3,Wed Dec 3 17:28:31 2014 UTC,"They call it the ""standard internet"" on my Time Warner online account. When I first got the package I think they described it as 7 mbps. I think it's one step above their budget package. I tend to order the second cheapest thing in this sorts of situations. I called them about this cap and apparently they instituted it back in September but I've had an ""introductory grace period"" and that's why I didn't notice it. A 5 gig cap is absurd for a home internet connection. I mean, my phone gets almost that much. I have a wifi hotspot on my phone included as part of my standard package and I'm tempted to just up the data on that and cancel the cable altogether. It would have to be truly unlimited for that work though. Apparently I used 194 GB last month."
dayton,2o5vcp,Dapke36,6,Wed Dec 3 17:50:30 2014 UTC,"I pay $35/ month, full price, no contract, for 15/1 Mbps with TWC. Kettering/Centerville line. By no means am I singing praises of TWC, as we have had our fair share of frustrations, but this service in the last year has been reliable and without caps. You may want to consider paying $5-10 month more for this level. Sounds like you use the internet heavily."
dayton,2o5vcp,knoid,6,Thu Dec 4 00:54:58 2014 UTC,"Middletown here. I don't have cable TV, so can't help you there, but for internet I switched to Earthlink after Time Warner decided to up my rate to $60/mo. Currently paying $30/mo for a promo period of 6 months, after which it'll go up to $42 - and will apparently stay there indefinitely, which I very much like. 15Mbps plan, by the way.  No usage caps either, and I'm using the same modem I had with TWC.  Prior to TWC I had AT&T, but got hit by their usage caps pretty soon after their introduction.  [edit] Meant to say that payment for Earthlink is still through the TWC website, so you should be able to do it alongside your existing cable. It may well get you out of this 5gb monthly cap ridiculousness, too, although you'd have to ask Earthlink about that. [/edit]"

dayton,2o5vcp,joebo3001,3,Wed Dec 3 20:58:28 2014 UTC,I'm sorry you're having issues. I'm not praising TWC but they are the best in the area. I'm waiting for either Google or Verizon FiOps to come here. That will be a while though so we have to deal with the suck.
dayton,2o5vcp,gamergump,3,Wed Dec 3 18:03:52 2014 UTC,We are much more likely to convince Cincinnati Bell fioptics to come to Dayton. They already have some infrastructure here so they already have many rights of way. They are almost priced as well as Google Fiber at least for the first year.

Tried different routers, all that jazz, nothing.  We pay for their 45mbps plan and get between 15 and 20mpbs at most."

I appreciate both of your inputs. I've had a couple people at work tell me UVerse was great and the price they were paying was definitely way cheaper than I'm paying, but I also read a lot of bad reviews about them on the internet, so it seems like the golden child might not be so golden depending on where you live."

I dropped AT&T like a bad habit when they introduced overage fees a few years ago.  As for a phone hotspot, I don't think any company does unlimited data for that.

dayton,2o5vcp,sethstorm,2,Wed Dec 3 19:25:53 2014 UTC,"South east fairborn, TWC is our only option, can't even get DSL much less Uverse.  We had TV, DVR, etc + standard internet with an 8mbps down / .8mbs up until about two weeks ago for $210.  We've had that service from the first day it was available here in maybe 2001?  Never heard anything about caps, but we have to be into hundreds of GBs a month and haven't yet had an issue.  Two weeks ago we went down and talked to them at the office near the dayton mall.  I wanted the 50M service, same basic TV plus HD and Sports tiers we already had.  Have no use for their phone.  Wound up on a plan for $180 that includes whole house DVR with 3 HD TVs, 50M internet, and their phone (which we haven't even hooked up).  Bunch of pay TV channels we didn't have before.    I can confirm the speed really did increase that much as I have nightly backup processes to and from offsite servers that are running 5X as fast.  Deal is only good for 12 months so I have to go back and talk to them again next year -- no clue what happens at that point, but worst case I'll keep the internet and dump everything else and go with DirecTV if they can't cut another deal."

And where are you originally from? Because I'm surprised living that close you don't know what to expect.  Edit: I live an hour north of Dayton. Went to school in Dayton.

dayton,2nzna3,theLoDown,10,Tue Dec 2 04:27:20 2014 UTC,"I grew up in a suburb of Dayton, but have lived in Cleveland for nearly 2 years. Dayton isn't even close to being a substitute. The Oregon District is cool, but there's only so many options before you're in a rut and just doing the same thing every weekend. The Art Institute is cool, but again, you can only go so often. Honestly, the amount of art-related events in the area is usually pitiful."

dayton,2nzna3,maninthehighcastle,3,Tue Dec 2 04:34:05 2014 UTC,"I'm from Cleveland, which I consider to be a 'small big city'. I work in Dayton now. I've also lived in DC and a few other truly big cities. Dayton, as far as urban cities go, is several orders of magnitude below places like Chicago. But like most cities in Ohio, it has a long history and is over-endowed with cultural resources in certain areas. It also has pretty decent weather and amazing cost of living. For a young designer, my totally unqualified opinion is that you apply elsewhere, unless you really want to put roots down in Dayton.  You mention Cleveland and Chicago, but these are very different comparisons. If you want urban life, lots of arts activities, and a thriving singles scene, Chicago is just better, period. Between Cleveland and Dayton, I could argue why Cleveland is better, but if you already work around Dayton, it's basically down to your preferences and existing connections. The real divide is between Anywhere in Ohio and first-tier big cities like Chicago, NYC, LA, SF, etc. There are non-huge cities that have special strengths and focuses, but for art? You generally want to go big while you're young, don't you?  I am a big defender/booster of Cleveland, donating member of the outstanding art museum, independent cinema, etc, etc but after a few weekends in Chicago, I was floored at the array of under-the-radar, completely awesome activities available to me in Chicago that would basically never be in Cleveland. Not only are there far more bars, restaurants, and theaters, but there is generally more happening. I was able to go online and get a ticket to something I'd never even heard of that turned out to be one of the best shows I'd ever been to. That can happen elsewhere, but it will not happen as often.  Living in Ohio has a lot of advantages, especially for those who want a somewhat more serene lifestyle. You can call your own shot, basically, and arrange your life as you please. You can own a nice house in your 20s or 30s. Traffic is totally reasonable. But there are fewer people, fewer new things, and, critically, less economic opportunity and fewer networking opportunities. If I were you and I had a chance to get a design job in a larger city, I would take it. You can always come back to Dayton later. You don't have to go to NYC or LA, you can go in-between and go to Cleveland, Pittsburgh, Austin, whatever.  And I'm not bashing Dayton. I like the Oregon District, I adore the Art Institute, I like the bike trails, and the cost of living is - quite literally - the lowest for an urban area in the state, and possibly the United States. OHKID's posts is pretty good on resources, but think for a long moment about how set in your priorities and values you are - if you're still open to new possibilities or not sure, it's better to seek out as many other young creative people as you can and you'll all help each other find your way."

dayton,2nzna3,ParanoydAndroid,10,Tue Dec 2 21:44:01 2014 UTC,"I'm in the same boat. To put it simply, YES!  Dayton is actually a great place to choose for an urban lifestyle. Why?   - Good community downtown, in the OD, and South Park  - Rents (or buying, if you have the $) is cheap  - Decent nightlife scene in the OD (or UD, if you'd rather hang there)  - There are tons of ways to get involved, meet people, and have a good time.  Also, both Columbus and Cincy are only an hour away.  Here are some good resources to get you started: http://www.downtowndayton.org/ https://www.facebook.com/updayton https://www.generationdayton.org/ mostmetro.com http://www.daytoncitypaper.com/ http://www.oregondistrict.org/ http://www.historicsouthpark.org/  And to answer your last question, I have always seen Dayton as more ""urban"" than ""large rural"". Appalachian culture is still strong, especially on the east side, but overall if you go downtown it feels like an urban city, not like a large town."
dayton,2nzna3,OHKID,8,Tue Dec 2 00:15:03 2014 UTC,"Man, I have to really disagree.  As someone who's lived in major cities (say, metro area pop > 1 million) Dayton is not even close.  It's by no means a bad place, but if you're specifically looking for ""urban life"" then Colombus would be significantly better if you want to stay close by and obviously places like Chicago would have much more to offer."
dayton,2nzna3,OHKID,1 point,Tue Dec 2 17:44:01 2014 UTC,"To each their own, I guess.  I like Dayton for what it's worth, but I also know there is 1) Low demand for the graphic design field, and 2) As a result, you'll likely not have a choice where you want to live unless you're willing to be unemployed for a significant period of time.  So if someone gets a graphic design job in Dayton, I'd advise them to take it! At least they won't be in a high cost of living metro where a graphic designer salary would have about the same purchasing power as a minimum wage job here."

That's not to say that if you were really interested in making a life here that you would be unable to, but if you are looking for a ""bigger city feel"" with a thriving arts community that you don't have to dig your heels into in order to really get a lot out of- I would recommend checking into the available jobs in Cincinnati to see the kind of market down there."

dayton,2nofqy,BrosenkranzKeef,5,Fri Nov 28 17:13:28 2014 UTC,I wonder if that correlates with the construction of 675 somehow.
dayton,2nofqy,ptfreak,10,Fri Nov 28 17:51:47 2014 UTC,"I wouldn't call Xenia a suburb of Dayton. It is included in the metro are but is its own thing. It's own lame, poor, stuck-in-a-rut kind of thing. I wouldn't recommend it to anybody, ever."
dayton,2nofqy,GreanEcsitSine,5,Fri Nov 28 22:40:56 2014 UTC,"I think Beavercreek's incorporation and growth has significantly contributed to that. Beavercreek has only been an actual city for 35 years or so, prior to that it was just a township. From what I know, Xenia, Fairborn, and maybe someone else were planning on splitting up the township and annexing it, so they incorporated to protect themselves from that. I think at that point, the city really started to grow, as it was ripe space for new development. It grew 13% from 1990-2000 and 19% from 2000-2010. I'm sure that even if Xenia and Fairborn wanted to grow and develop, it was just easier in Beavercreek.  Someone else mentioned 675, and that was built in the late 80s, which I'm sure helped, as it cuts right through Beavercreek, and dumps traffic off onto 35, with the first few exits being right in the middle of the town. And the tornadoes thing isn't a joke, I lived in Beavercreek for most of my life, and all the tornadoes hit Xenia and mostly completely missed us. It's bizarre.  But Xenia did get namechecked in Orange is the New Black, even if Beavercreek would have made for great lesbian jokes."
dayton,2nofqy,GreanEcsitSine,3,Fri Nov 28 22:37:51 2014 UTC,The last two major tornadoes (1974 & 2000) originated from the Bellbrook area and worked northeast towards Xenia.
dayton,2nofqy,FuschiaLucia,4,Sat Nov 29 04:13:07 2014 UTC,"Xenia is a commuter town about 20 minutes out from Dayton. Property values are low because of the struggling school district. The best places to live tend to be on the outskirts of town rather than in the downtown area. Almost all of the main shopping outlets (Walmart & Kroger) are now on the western edge of town but there is a small grocery store on the north side on Detroit St.  Xenia gives off a small blue collar town vibe most of the time... it's fairly safe as far as places go around here, but it's a bit far from the rest of the Dayton area, and it's not a up and happening place at all.  I used to live in Xenia and I still have family there, but I'm not sure I'd recommend it over somewhere else like Beavercreek, Centerville, or Kettering."

dayton,2nhbz2,stemm,11,Wed Nov 26 14:49:18 2014 UTC,"It depends on what you want to spend as well.  If you want to live downtown there are some really nice places popping up, condos and higher-end apartments that would make your commute essentially walking distance.  Right downtown is not bad at all, just the normal urban stuff to deal with like bums and whatnot.  Not terribly cheap though.  Further out you have Oakwood, the most expensive but probably nicest suburb, right next to UD and within sight of downtown.  If you can afford it this is usually preferred, but it's a little too swanky for my taste.    If you move either east or west from downtown you're gonna have a bad time.  Those are the most run-down areas (albeit cheapest).  I wouldn't recommend that unless you are pretty strapped.    I live in Belmont, which is still Dayton proper to the south (technically) but borders Kettering.  It's affordable, safe, etc.  Probably the only part of Dayton proper I would live in aside from maybe downtown.  I work right downtown and my commute is 3 miles/10 minutes.  Kettering is a nice suburb, as are Beavercreek, Centerville, Bellbrook...those last three are a bit further from downtown though (15 to 30 minutes via highway) so it really depends on what you can deal with drive-wise.  Also, if you have kids or think school district might be an issue in the future I would avoid Dayton proper and look at one of the suburbs.  People also tend to forget about the north, but Vandalia and Englewood are OK from what I understand, my wife went to school up there and said it was very nice.    Honestly you have a lot of options.  Depending on your lifestyle any one of them could be good for you.  You may want to get something short-term until you can feel the city out if that's feasible.  Also if you're interested in something specific that wasn't listed by any of us just ask.  We'll fill you in.  Welcome!"

I wouldn't recommend that unless you are pretty strapped.   I must say North Dayton isn't much better really. South Dayton or bust is the real answer
dayton,2nhbz2,DrStephenFalken,6,Fri Nov 28 06:50:46 2014 UTC,"First off, here's some answers from past times this has been asked:  https://www.reddit.com/r/dayton/search?q=live&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all  That said, here's my take on the situation, and you have to decide if you want to live in the suburbs or closer downtown.  Living in the Suburbs  A lot of people live in the suburbs of Dayton.  The best grocery stores are also out in the suburbs, and most of the suburbs are very safe.  However, suburban living (weirdly) is probably going to be more expensive than living downtown.   Popular suburbs are Kettering, Beavercreek, Centerville, and Miamisburg, but really anything south or east of downtown is fairly nice. I would stay away from the immediate northwest of dayton, as it's a bit more dangerous...you're probably fine if you mind your own business, and take basic safety precautions (there's not usually like random driveby shootings or anything incredibly drastic like that), but why take chances if you can afford to live elsewhere.  Living in Dayton  Dayton has some pretty cool things within the city limits...several good bars, a public market, indie theatre, and access to a million bike paths to name a few.  Living in Dayton would also put you within biking distance of your work as well, making your commute every easy.  If you lived in Dayton I would recommend the historic neighborhoods--South Park, St. Anne's Hill, the Oregon District, Huffman--or downtown itself.  If you're looking for housing in those districts, you'll actually probably have some good luck on Craigslist. Again, as above, I would stay away from the northwest side, unless you're really looking to save money.    Personally, I live in Dayton (St. Anne's Hill specifically) and I love it...I love easy access to the bike paths, to the Oregon District and to everything else.  That said, I know city living is not for everyone and we've got some pretty cool suburbs around here too.  Good luck on your housing search!  I'd love to answer any questions you might have."
dayton,2nhbz2,Houndie,2,Wed Nov 26 16:16:44 2014 UTC,"Thanks for the reply! Could you tell me more about St. Anne's Hill? I have heard that downtown gets a little dead at night, no easy access to a grocery store, etc. Also, do you find it pretty safe? Thanks!"
dayton,2nhbz2,Houndie,1 point,Fri Nov 28 02:25:59 2014 UTC,"Sure!  St. Anne's hill is one of the four historic districts in dayton, so the neighborhood has a lot of character.  Although I've never gone (I tend to travel a lot), the neighborhood holds parties once a month, as well as events a few times a year like a historic house tour and a neighborhood yard sale.  Recently a neighborhood brewpub as opened up, owned by many of the people that live in St. Anne's Hill.  South Park is probably pretty close to St. Anne's Hill in tone, whereas the Oregon District is slightly nicer, slightly more expensive, and also adjacent to the bar disctrict so has slightly more traffic.  I've lived in St. Anne's Hill for 3 years, and never felt unsafe (although I'm a mid-twenties white male so keep that in mind).  I had my car gone though once when I forgot to lock it, but nothing was taken so I don't know what's up with that.  I've never felt that downtown was deader than any other city at night.  Areas around bars still have traffic until they close.  As for grocery store access, that's only a half-truth...there is a Kroger within easy distance of towndown.  However, it's not the greatest Kroger in the world and sometimes the produce there isn't the greatest.  The 2nd street market is open thursday-saturday which helps make up for it somewhat, but we could still use a better grocery solution downtown."
dayton,2nhbz2,mrkhiggz,7,Fri Nov 28 02:40:48 2014 UTC,"I just moved to Dayton 2 months ago and currently live in the Kettering/Oakwood area. Kettering and Oakwood seem to be the areas a lot of people try to live in as well as Centerville, but Centerville will be a slightly longer drive for you. Trotwood is really cheap to live but not very nice to live in so I would recommend staying away from there. Beavercreek is also pretty nice but some of its apartment seemed too college for me since they are so close to Wright State University. As far as living in Dayton goes, the places were either way too expensive or in a bad/run down area.   I love the area I am in(Edge of Kettering and Oakwood) . I work right across the river from downtown and my 4.5 mile commute normally on tskes about 15 minutes. As far a surface street traffic goes I have no complaints. I never drive on the highways during rush hour so I cannot comment there. If you have anymore specific questions let me/the rest of us  know."
dayton,2nhbz2,DrStephenFalken,1 point,Wed Nov 26 15:15:04 2014 UTC,Trotwood is really cheap to live but not very nice to live in.   If you stay out of the part of Trotwood with aluminum siding homes (free pike / salem / Gettysburg area) and move into the area of true Trotwood where it's all brick homes it's actually not bad neighborhood. Lots of old people live in those homes and there's not much crime.   Source: I grew up in an aluminum sided home Trotwood. Parents still live there.
dayton,2nhbz2,DaytonRentals,3,Fri Nov 28 06:53:04 2014 UTC,"I grew up north and south of Dayton and can second a few of the Kettering/Oakwood nods if you're looking for suburb living and you have kids. It's a little further from downtown, but Vandalia and Tipp City are both very nice, quiet areas close to 75. You can get downtown in reasonable times, even in rush hour.   However, if you're younger and looking to be closer to work, lots of nightlife options, good eats, and parks/Dragons' baseball downtown, I'd recommend living in Oregon (right downtown, but a little more costly) or South Park (about a mile from the center of downtown, but not far at all). They houses are historical (100+ years old) and full of character.   The issue here is the public schools are not great, if you have kids, and the area can be a little ""rougher."" It's not really anything violent or life threatening, but there can be some whackadoos in the grocery and the occasional car break-in if you aren't careful with your stuff. It's not bad, by any means, but it's more of an issue it will be in the suburbs listed by myself and others.   But, it's part of the cost of city living and being close to work, activities, and nightlife. In South Park, you're surrounded by University of Dayton, Miami Valley Hospital, some cool bars that aren't too rowdy, a cool coffee shop, and easy highway access to anywhere else you need to go. I love the area.   All that said, I am biased; I own and rent out homes in South Park. There are so many great houses with history and character, combined with its close proximity to downtown and so much to do, that it's a place I love.   Either way, you can't go to wrong with any of the advice given by those here. If you're from Cleveland, Dayton won't be a real shocker. It's a place with ups and downs like anywhere else, but it's a fine, inexpensive place to live.   Best of luck!"
dayton,2nhbz2,kiersten813,6,Wed Nov 26 18:40:38 2014 UTC,I second the endorsement of historic districts in Dayton. Walnut hills / Ohmer Park have some nice historic homes that aren't as pricey as Oregon or south park would be.
dayton,2nhbz2,monkyboy74,3,Wed Nov 26 20:14:13 2014 UTC,Third for south park. Love it here.
dayton,2nhbz2,suchacrisis,3,Thu Nov 27 00:34:07 2014 UTC,"Fourth for South Park. Kettering here, but I see myself headed to SP after my lease is up!  EDIT: Kettering is really nice though, I love it here."
dayton,2nhbz2,insomnyuk,0,Thu Nov 27 16:37:20 2014 UTC,"Alright, show me what I am missing. South Park looks extremely run down and only a few houses that are nice with character. What am I missing? Some of the homes in South park are even priced at 30k range or even below that..."
dayton,2nhbz2,cr8rface,7,Fri Nov 28 16:23:57 2014 UTC,Despite what some on here might say do not move to Trotwood or West Dayton or Northwest Dayton. The cheap rent is not worth it.

dayton,2nhbz2,thisisnotaworkacct,5,Wed Nov 26 17:45:20 2014 UTC,"What is your price range for an apt?  Also, some of the cities have an income tax too. I know Kettering and Heuber Heights has one, at 1% if memory serves.  FWIW, I live in Beavercreek and can help with questions about the creek."
dayton,2nhbz2,Rabnudj,7,Wed Nov 26 15:17:49 2014 UTC,"the city of dayton has a 2.25% income tax, so they will be paying all of that.  City income tax goes first by where you work (ie I work in kettering which is 1% I think) but live in dayton so I pay the 1.25% to dayton, and 1% to Kettering.  edit:  Just looked up ketting it is 2.25% so I pay it all there.  Dayton: 2.25% Kettering: 2.25% Huber Heights: 2.00% Oakwood: 2.5% Moraine: 2.5% West Carlton: 2.00% Miamisburg: 2.25%  I think bevercreek is the only city in the area without a income tax."

Does anyone have any thoughts on The Cannery or The Landing specifically (both downtown), or the desirability of the surrounding area? I don't care much about night life. I'm focused on safety and access to things like grocery/parking."
dayton,2nhbz2,PRGuyHere,1 point,Fri Nov 28 02:39:23 2014 UTC,"If you don't care about night life, then I would definitely recommend Oakwood or north Kettering area. It is a very easy and quick drive into downtown and there are plenty of grocery stores around. I have never had parking issue while living there either. From where I live I have 1 Walmart, 2 Kroger, 1 Meijer, and a Trader Joes all within 3 miles of my apartment. Oakwood is probably one of the nicest suburbs of Dayton and it is the the closest suburb to downtown. Kettering is also one of the nicer suburbs of Dayton and borders Oakwood. I have only lived in this area for 2.5 months but so far I am loving it."
dayton,2nhbz2,theWgame,1 point,Fri Nov 28 03:56:20 2014 UTC,"The cannery is nice, though the rent there tends to be higher than I think it really should be... Building is controlled access, the parking options are good and heating costs are reasonable. Walking distance to the Oregon District and 2nd Street market... Downside with the cannery other than price is that the units in close vicinity to Therapy are not suitable to a person working a first shift job and you should really should pay for one of the secured parking areas as there is an above average amount of property crime on the streets north of the building.   If you live downtown I'd recommend doing your grocery shopping in Kettering (the Trader Joes and Kroger Fresh Faire are both at the corners of Stroop and Shroyer and there is a Meijer with an excellent produce department further west on Stroop) because as others have mentioned the Kroger on Wayne is a little lacking in selection and atmosphere."
dayton,2nhbz2,Tapeleg91,2,Sun Nov 30 06:28:56 2014 UTC,"I just bought a house in Centerville, near the mall.  It's a great school district, safe area, and a 4-bedroom in good shape with an attached garage (but no basement) ran us about 170k."

dayton,2nhbz2,clutchied,-3,Thu Nov 27 15:04:48 2014 UTC,"Dayton is not a real happening city, the majority of people that I know live in the suburbs. The area to avoid is defiently the West side of Dayton. Basically west of the Miami river. The most interesting part of town that I am aware of is the Oregon District. There are some nice restuarnts, bars, and some breweries are popping up in the area. My recomdation is to look at some of the suburbs just south or east of town for an apartment to rent until you get a lay of the town. Maybe check out Kettering, Beavercreek. If you are looking to live very close to,the city I would stay on the East side, maybe somewhere like Belmont (put I do know there can be some rough areas on the East side as well but I have known a few people that lived in Belmont). But Kettering or Oakwood would keep you close to the city in a nice area."
dayton,2nhbz2,DoktorKruel,13,Wed Nov 26 15:11:30 2014 UTC,"Dayton is not a real happening city   I'm actually going to disagree...between the bars, the bike paths, the market, the baseball games, and everything that goes on at riverscape, I find plenty to do downtown.   It's all dependent on your tastes though!  I just happen to like the things that downtown Dayton offers me."
dayton,2nhbz2,VGMtheVagabond,9,Wed Nov 26 16:47:39 2014 UTC,"I am also a fan of downtown (full disclosure, I live downtown). It's in the midst of a slow comeback - in fact I think Downtown Dayton has a 97ish% occupancy rate with tons of new housing construction going on at the moment. There are a lot of cool things opening up lately in general - including several great downtown breweries. The Oregon district is a good bar scene, and overall I would say the city feels pretty safe to walk around. I read recently, that Forbes (iirc)  ranked the Dayton area as the most affordable place to buy a house in the country as well.   Bottom line: Dayton has a long way to go, but it's headed in the right direction, and is a pretty good place to live, overall. I would definitely consider living downtown."

dayton,2ndgbg,DoktorKruel,10,Tue Nov 25 14:27:32 2014 UTC,These aren't legal under Dayton R.C. 70.121 which requires these cameras to be at an intersection with a traffic light. Please spread the word about Dayton's systemic breaking of their own city law that they could rewrite any time they chose to stop committing fraud.
dayton,2ndgbg,juanqp,4,Tue Nov 25 22:25:39 2014 UTC,"As I passed the camera going less than 15mph, I wasn't sure if it was a joke or if Dayton PD has never driven on 75N.  I wish I could go 45 through there."

They put a huge sign up saying Speed Enforcement Vehicle Ahead. 60 MPH.   If anyone got a ticket from it, they deserved it. I think it's crap that the vehicle is unmanned. If they are going to issue a ticket, it should be verified.  I agree with /u/juanqp though in the fact that D.R.C. 70.121 is violated by being on I-75 but their way around that is that it is not on ""city property"" but state since it's an interstate. That's what was explained to me anyway.  I do have to laugh at where they put it. Traffic is at a crawl before you get to that camera 90% of the time!"
dayton,2ndgbg,airforcegeek,-5,Wed Nov 26 13:07:00 2014 UTC,Or.... how about not breaking the law...? Speed limit has been posted at 45 for months through 75.....
dayton,2ndgbg,crash0matic,8,Wed Nov 26 00:18:35 2014 UTC,Just because someone is speeding doesn't mean it's okay to ignore due process and throw out 200 years of a functioning criminal justice system.

I know it'd never be prosecuted, but technically Dayton is violating Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act laws. A class action, triple damages civil RICO suit would be great, but good luck finding a lawyer around here with the guts to do it. They had to go to a Cincinnati lawyer just to get any suit filed against Dayton on these.  Dayton is breaking local, state, and federal laws and violating rights too.

dayton,2ne8jd,Houndie,3,Wed Nov 26 14:10:12 2014 UTC,"I think they make it successful by shifting their target audience to retired empty nesters that are downsizing and would consider moving downtown for the activities in proximity and young professionals working downtown that want to walk to work, dining, and nightlife.   Plus, they could knock it out of the park by putting a higher-end grocery there to service those living in the development and in the areas surrounding it (southern Oakwood, SP, and Oregon)."

There was a smallish quarter size hole in the glass with the entire window being almost whited out with tiny cracks across the whole thing.  When we opened the door and closed it the back window collpased into a thousand tiny pieces.      Later while cleaning up the glass we found the bullet.  We weren't completely certain it was a bullet that put the small hole in the window up until we found it. I initially had my doubts about it being shot out though because I thought there would be an additional hole some where in the interior.  Nothing of value was in the car and nothing was taken.  I don't think the car was the intended target. I think that is just where the bullet ended up.  (I don't find that fact to be particularly comforting.)

Now sell that house and get one the same size in Dayton for half the price. The effect would be even more drastic coming from California or something. Old folks might want a smaller, quieter city and there is serious money to be made by moving here from almost anywhere else."

dayton,2ml11v,luciddr34m3r,6,Tue Nov 18 00:55:54 2014 UTC,"Tickets to a comedy club are usually $15 for each person. It's like paying for a movie. We have something some people want to see. but it costs money to provide this. This is an offer to not purchase 4 tickets ($60 value).  It's a 2 item minimum which is a fairly standard procedure at comedy clubs across america. In fact if you google ""2 item minimum"" most of the front page hits are from comedy club websites. (Maybe google just knows that using my search history.)  8pm shows are 18 and up. (this information is on the club website which I linked to, along with pictures and clips of the upcoming performers to see if you think they're funny.)  You may purchase food, or non alcoholic beverages or bottles of water.   If you don't like that, I understand. Sit at home and watch youtube videos."

dayton,2ml11v,FearAndLawyering,4,Tue Nov 18 06:40:52 2014 UTC,"The revolt against buying 2 items during a 2 hour free show is rather shocking to me. The OP is responding pretty rationally IMO.

If you CAN afford a night out, we're giving you a break on tickets to come check us out because we're willing to bet you'll have such a great time that you'll come back and pay for tickets another day."

Ever been in a nice Marions? Nope because that's impossible. Even a newly built Marions looks old as shit.

dayton,2meitx,Alice_In_Zombieland,3,Mon Nov 17 12:28:41 2014 UTC,Marion's is totally a thing that only people from Dayton like.   When they stopped using the regular pizza ovens and went to chain ovens it really changed the flavor and the pizza itself. Chain ovens really just broil the pizza and don't bake it the same way a normal oven does. Just not the same.
dayton,2meitx,Conchguy,3,Sun Nov 16 01:46:47 2014 UTC,You can still get them made in the brick ovens.
dayton,2meitx,sucks_at_usernames,2,Sun Nov 16 03:13:42 2014 UTC,"I work on pizza ovens a lot at work. All conveyor style. They are more like convection ovens. Really, they are like a natural gas furnace in your house. If you come across a place that uses propane in a conveyor oven, buy that pizza. It's so damn good for some reason."
dayton,2meitx,PlacidTick,7,Sun Nov 16 04:14:41 2014 UTC,Best pizza in Dayton. Anyone who says otherwise doesn't have a different opinion. They're just wrong.
dayton,2meitx,DrStephenFalken,3,Sat Nov 15 21:51:08 2014 UTC,I used to think it couldn't be that good. Then I tried it.

dayton,2meitx,Swinginlumber,5,Sat Nov 15 21:40:46 2014 UTC,I think they made the sauce sweeter. It's still good but not as good as it used to be. It's a rarity/treat vs say Cousin Vennys.  I'm going to miss them both when we move. :(

dayton,2lz2si,captain_silly_cat,1 point,Thu Nov 13 13:49:51 2014 UTC,I think Dr. Dale Drollinger (Far Hills Ave.) accepts Medicaid but I'm not positive. He is a great OB/GYN.
dayton,2lz2si,troll2popcornscene,1 point,Tue Nov 11 19:53:21 2014 UTC,Five Rivers Health Center takes CareSource and Medicaid. Southview takes Molina. I should also add that Five Rivers is spun off from Miami Valley Hospital fairly recently.  I know some people in the childbirth business in Dayton and they recommend Five Rivers if you can't afford care or need help. Opinions about Southview are generally negative.  edits: spelling and moar content

Though I shouldn't base a practice on one doctor, as I've got a great spinal surgeon that's in with a group where I don't like at least two of the back doctors, but when I'm faced with ""These science tell us that if you get a good night sleep, this will take away all of your daytime wakefulness and focus issues"" I have to believe that they're all thinking and acting the same way. My issue, as well as so many others', is not so simply resolved.  My cpap is supposed to measure my amount of use, sleep, etc, but the problem is that it doesn't indicate when I went to sleep or when I woke up, so when it states that I only used the mask 5% of the time instead of 75%, that's bull. If I sleep 5 hours a night and use it 3 hours each of those nights before taking it off, that's closer to 60%.

Still, after 18 years of a chronic cough and many misdiagnoses he got it right. I'm going through a sleep sturdy through there because even though I don't like his treatment style, he diagnosed the cough correctly.  The thing I really learned is that specialists will always see a disease through their specialty. ENT will saw a throat problem. Internal medicine, it's got to be from acid reflux. Allergists all knew it was from an allergy they just hadn't isolated yet. In the end it was cough variant asthma found by a pulmonary specialist, of course. The cough has stopped, but was it by luck of specialty.  My advice is if your having problems with one kind of specialist and can switch specialties do so. As an example, ENTs, dentists, and other specialists also treat sleep apnea."

dayton,2lf6zt,BrosenkranzKeef,2,Thu Nov 6 18:28:15 2014 UTC,"We live in the land of authority, folks. More police, more enforcement, more fines, etc. Welcome to the Midwest. We just don't decriminalize things.   Here is an example. Ohio is attempting reform on traffic cameras. Just a couple days ago, the Ohio Senate voted overwhelmingly in support of a new bill that will effectively limit, or altogether shut down, the use of traffic cameras throughout Ohio. So what does the bill say?  That municipalities would have to station an actual police officer at the site of any working camera as confirmation.  Yeah. Oh, it will indeed effectively shut down camera use because of the cost associated with putting a cop at every location.   But why the fuck didn't they just ban them? Instead, they figure adding more authority to the equation will solve it. More, more, more. That seems stupid to me. Just get rid of the damn things. But they have to leave the option open to using the cameras, at least one at a time, because there is so much government money involved with the companies that manufacture them.  http://www.daytondailynews.com/news/news/crime-law/ohio-redlight-speeding-cameras-could-be-on-way-out/njBCD/  I figure what this will lead to is towns stationing a cop near a camera in a spot where you can't see him. He might not even be able to see you, honestly. But cities will pick the few most effective cameras and put a cop there who will conduct his usual monitoring/readiness/deterrent activities and simultaneously allow the camera to operate.  Until the Ohio Supreme Court does something about the issue, if at all, municipalities are going to wring everything they can out of these devices and continue destroying their tax base in the process."
dayton,2lf6zt,BrosenkranzKeef,1 point,Fri Nov 21 16:54:40 2014 UTC,"The bill legitimizes the cameras. If it becomes law, it's the excuse the Supreme Courts needs to not issue a ruling. They will say the legislature regulated them, and grandfathered programs that substantially followed the new rules back to 2009, so the case is moot."
dayton,2lf6zt,BrosenkranzKeef,1 point,Sat Nov 22 02:34:48 2014 UTC,"Hell, that makes it even more complicated. It legitimizes the camera but also makes them too costly to operate. The way our government works, piling rules higher rather than stripping them away, never ceases to blow my mind."

The same parts as I took to UPS. The cost was MUCH more reasonable at approximately $60. They charge by time used to print and with the high fill rate I needed it was going to be 5 to 6 hours to print. This is very reasonable I think. I didn't do it because as a hobbyist, I can buy a cast aluminum mount for about the same cost or less. But they have makerbots, which are nice, don't get me wrong, but not quite on par with a stratasys. But the name/quality difference isn't big enough to justify the cost difference. I general, I would recommend ProtBuildBar first since they are reasonable and local. UPS would be last though. I think I would look at Shapeways online if I didn't need to be local though.  Also whomever said they place was pretentious or douchey probably hasn't been there. The people I talked with were nice and somewhat knowledgeable and open to learning something if they didn't have any personal experience in an area. In general I rather like the place."

dayton,2l8azn,Pennington1572,20,Tue Nov 4 04:12:54 2014 UTC,I personally don't work there but my last place of employment had a lot of ex-R&R employees. The consensus was that the place was very very micromanage-y and was not a good experience.   In addition to that the application process is incredibly tedious. You have to take an hour+ long test before you can even be considered for an interview.
dayton,2l8azn,HORSEtheGAME,4,Tue Nov 4 04:25:54 2014 UTC,"My ex worked there. It was very dog eat dog and very micro manage-y as you have stated.   On top of that the interview and application process is crazy. After an hour long test. You're given a very long interview. If you make it passed that. You are given a tour of the campus.   There's a theory behind the tour of the campus. It's a very long tour and it's walked at a very brisk pace. The theory that a lot of the employees have is that the tour is to see how physically fit you are. It takes you the long way every where and up and down many staircases that aren't normally used to get to the places you are going.  R&R doesn't like to spend a lot of money on ""unnecessary"" insurance and since they can't outright say they don't want to hire out of shape or fat people. They give you the ""tour."" If you pass the tour and are looking like a good candidate they drug test you (hair) and swab your mouth for tobacco use. Then you take a proper fitness exam.   Once you're hired on be prepared for random drug / tobacco tests (about every 6 weeks) and yearly physicals to determine how much you will pay for insurance. They're very health conscious company. They don't sell anything high fat or with sugar on campus and you're not really allowed to bring it in. If you do, holy shit, it will be a shit storm of talking behind your back and people walking past your desk to look at your 8 ounce can of Coca-Cola. People will treat you like you raped a baby for the rest of the day.   It's a  very absurd company."

You can bring in whatever you want to eat here. In fact, there are a lot of charity bake sales and coworkers making food and bringing it in that, coupled with sitting at a desk, can make you gain weight if you're not careful.

The plant I worked at only sold ""healthy"" foods, and zero calorie drinks in the vending machines. When you're hired you take an aptitude test which follows you throughout your career and is basically used as a glass ceiling for upward movement.   If you have no issues with any of those things, it's absolutely great. I never worked at headquarters but I imagine that would be even better (on-campus restaurant, gym, etc)."

When they are pushing out a software update, you will be expected to work the weekends, no questions asked. It seems like they had some organizational issues. From what I understand, their marketing isn't bad to work for, but anything technical is going to be rough."
dayton,2l8azn,kiersten813,5,Tue Nov 4 11:10:31 2014 UTC,"Former Reynolds employee here -  if you are desperate for a job, then go for it. Only because a paycheck from Reynolds is better than no paycheck at all,  but just barely.   I was terminated for not passing the nicotine test (I was not enrolled in their insurance plan).  It's not just smoking that can get you, its use of anything that contains nicotine - patches, gum, e-cigs, etc.    Any items containing sugar are prohibited from being sold on campus. Bringing it in yourself is also discouraged.    The only upshot is that I made some of the best connections and got some of the best professional experience of my career there, which isn't nothing.

I was offered a couple positions, but after speaking with a few employees, and seeing the general demeanor of the place, I decided to respectfully decline.  That sort of micro-managing, dystopian-style corporate culture is not for me.   That said, I've known 5-6 people who work there (or previously worked there) and many of them really seem to enjoy it.

I liked the call center, but I was also just getting a feel for the software I was going to be testing, so I don't think they screwed me to the wall on the metrics like they did for the full time folks. The testing was hell. I was geographically separated from the rest of my team and talking/interacting was pretty highly discouraged. You clocked in (which they tracked) sat at your desk until lunch, ate at their cafeteria or maybe went to their gym on your lunch hour since if you went to the Greene you would have to clock in and clock out of the campus (which they tracked), didn't really talk to anyone, stared at a screen for 8 hours and then clocked out. My manager was pretty disengaged from his employees and usually didn't know what I was doing unless I explained it to him. It was also expected that you would put in overtime for live tests on Sundays and evenings for ""unofficial"" comp time (usually encouraged to be taken on the next business day). They did let us telework on days with bad snow, so that was kind of nice. I don't know if you could do that anymore. I also don't remember the sugar nazis, that must have started after I left.  Unrelated to the corporate culture: They paid me (a recent college grad at the time) what I now know is an absolute pittiance for a MBA graduate (I left the job for a roughly $15k immediate pay rise, with guaranteed promotions. they offered me an additional $6 to stay. Nooooooope!). In short, if you have other options, I'd try them first. Try some of the base job fairs."

Same goes for people who are overweight, you are gonna pay more(and I know this as someone over weight).  After those two groups bio-metric screenings are gonna become norm for healthcare.

Even if he had not written his name in that Bible, he still would have told North Korea police that it was his Bible if he was questioned. These guys very often believe that any form of lying or deception is a sin.  Brings back memories of 10th grade Bible class when my teacher explained that lying is ALWAYS a sin.  I think part of the confusion here is most redditors are not religious, and perhaps many didn't grow up in a religious environment.  Obviously, his actions seem insane to a non-religious person, but to him what he did probably seemed perfectly rational within his own way of looking at the world.  He probably was not intentionally trying to influence geopolitics directly. His viewpoint is that he is trying to save people from going to Hell and therefore his actions are completely justified."

Vaporcast is a bit on the pricey side, but they are very knowledgeable and one of their jucies (southern freeze) has been the only juice I always come back to and has been my daily driver for two years. They have a boat load of juices to try, as do most other stores.  Mission Vapor is similar to vaporcast, but from what I notice, tends to be more oriented to those looking for mechanical mods/drip supplies. I buy coils there because they're the closest to where I live.  Hazyshade has my other favorite juice (rocsauce). They also have the best prices for juice that I have seen.  Note - There is an abundance of counterfeit products out there for the Aspire/Nautilus products - both the tanks and coils. They come with a scratch off code to verify online, but you won't know until you've already made the purchase. Vaporcast will not sell you counterfeits, and I trust Mission Vapor as well, but I've mistakenly found them at other B&Ms around the area. Counterfeit coils taste bad, hit like garbage, and burn within a day. Not sure about the counterfeit tanks, but I wouldn't risk it."

dayton,2kin1y,alethia_and_liberty,5,Tue Oct 28 03:50:20 2014 UTC,"from a post a few days ago.  Thanks to /user/Snorgledork for the info  In 1990, the U.S. Supreme Court determined that, despite their “intrusion on individual liberties,” being stopped in a DUI checkpoint does not violate a person’s Fourth Amendment’s protection from unreasonable searches and seizures. Despite finding that roadblocks did meet the Fourth Amendment’s definition of an unreasonable seizure, the court found that, due to the threat a drunk driver imposes on other motorists, they were a necessary means of protection. Ultimately, the U.S. Supreme Court decided to leave it up to each state to determine whether law officers could use DUI checkpoints to apprehend suspected drunk drivers. Following this ruling, eleven states passed laws to prohibit roadblocks, while the remaining 39 states continued to allow them. http://www.duicheckpoints.net/areduicheckpointsunconstitutional.html"

dayton,2kin1y,davelm42,2,Tue Oct 28 11:46:42 2014 UTC,"Yeah, they will cite you for anything, plus they are looking for people with outstanding warrants.

dayton,2kin1y,cortana,2,Tue Oct 28 16:33:40 2014 UTC,"I have an answer, but the Ohio supreme court is too corrupt to allow it. The Supreme ruled that even though it was an unreasonable search and seizure under the 4th amendment that they would let the states decide.  The Ohio Constitution has the fourth amendment word for word. Since it is a violation of the fourth, it is also a violation of Ohio 1.14. Ohio has decided, and placed in our state Constitution that our rights against unreasonable search and seizure shall not be violated. It should be clear, but the state protects itself and couldn't give a damn about our rights."

These breaches (which, again, were promised in initial contracts) include:    not providing or paying for travel arrangements not paying for hotel rooms the result of these breaches ended in the invited guests having to pay for their own expenses. Most refused to attend the event as a result.  When Guests attempted to contact the coordinators through various means (phone, email, SMS, etc) they received no response.  There seemed to be no attempt on behalf of the coordinators to rectify the situation. with so many Guests and Vendors dropping out, attendance quickly fell from the projected estimates.  Vendors who did attend were unable to sell much of anything.  One Invited Guest even said ""Guests out numbered the fans"". And to top it off, for a short while the promoter's husband had posted on facebook a long rant about how shitty people were treating the promoter and how stressed she was.  Perfectly fine, but it was sprinkled with phrases like:   ""Some of the vendors were so damn childish, disrespectful, high, and drunk..."" ""You cost us a fucking massive amount of los! s[sic] of mon ey[sic] and yourselves just from your bad behavior and should have been kicked out... but we let you stay"" "" You whine, bitch and moan, but are completely clueless to see anything that really happened, don’t know nor care how things really work, much less know how to run a convention like this."""

Because we live in this Great Country that allows us to speak our opinions and debate the Law, I will.  These checkpoints have proven to be ineffective, and the majority of arrests that come from these checkpoints are NOT OVI related.  Here is an example of what arrests occurred in one of Dayton's Checkpoints, of 554 Vehicles stopped, 19 were detained, with 15 arrests or citations made, only 1 of those were OVI related.    Now don't get me wrong here, I do not condone Impaired Driving, and I personally do not drive even after a single drink, but I do not agree that these checkpoints (plain-sight searches of people and vehicles, to trump up Probable Cause) are anything more than an opportunity to increase County revenue, and are ineffective in preventing or stopping impaired driving.  What's next?  The State or County will knock on everyone's doors, enter your home if they have Probable Cause, and search your underwear drawers for your stash of contraband?"

Despite finding that roadblocks did meet the Fourth Amendment’s definition of an unreasonable seizure, the court found that, due to the threat a drunk driver imposes on other motorists, they were a necessary means of protection.   Ultimately, the U.S. Supreme Court decided to leave it up to each state to determine whether law officers could use DUI checkpoints to apprehend suspected drunk drivers. Following this ruling, eleven states passed laws to prohibit roadblocks, while the remaining 39 states continued to allow them.   http://www.duicheckpoints.net/areduicheckpointsunconstitutional.html"

They also claimed they'd allow states to decide on their own, but then over-ruled the Michigan Supreme Court's ruling that it is illegal in Michigan.  It was a contorted mess of a decision that gave permission to the states to break the law.

dayton,2k0b6y,Drenlo,4,Thu Oct 23 04:40:37 2014 UTC,"It is recommended not to take your dog to a dog park until they are about a year old. 4 months old and have had all of their shots.  Mostly due to diseases and the shot immunization schedules for puppies.  They even have signs posted about it at the parks.  I actually enrolled my puppy in puppy training for extra socialization.  With that said I know of two.  One is near Needmoree Rd/I-75.    If you're going north bound you get off on Benchwood/Wyse Rd and take a right until it comes to a T.   It is part of the Montgomery County animal resource center.  Addres: 6790 Webster St. Dayton, OH 45414  There is another one at Oak Grove Park in Centerville: 1790 E Social Row Rd, Centerville, OH 45458  I've seen a few people at the Montgomery county park.  The Centerville one is usually pretty active."
dayton,2k0b6y,gamergump,4,Wed Oct 22 18:22:56 2014 UTC,Dogs can go to a dog park after they have received all of their vaccinations which should be around 4 months. It is very bad to take your dog their without them but you should not have to wait a full year. In fact it can be very hard for your dog to learn to socialize if you wait until they are a year old.
dayton,2k0b6y,Drenlo,2,Wed Oct 22 20:08:41 2014 UTC,After your post I looked it up and you're right.  After 4 months when they've had all of their shots it's okay to take them to the park.  That's good to know information that I wasn't aware of.  I've corrected my initial post.
dayton,2k0b6y,pibroch,2,Wed Oct 22 20:43:47 2014 UTC,"It is recommended not to take your dog to a dog park until they are about a year old.

Can confirm... neighbors socialize their dogs (including a young puppy) at the Bark Park, it came home with Parvo and infected our pup. Both survived, but it was scary."

dayton,2k0b6y,2rideascooter,2,Wed Oct 22 17:48:22 2014 UTC,"On crappy, rainy days (that seem to be more and more frequent these days), we take our pup (8 months old.  Boxer/Lab/Pit mix) to Sit Stay N Play in Huber. You don't get to hang out with your dog, but it's basically day care for your dog. Giant indoor room where the dogs run and play. They have one worker for every 6 dogs I think they said. They also have a pretty sizeable indoor dog park.   Our dog is there right now actually. He loves the place and comes home wore out.  http://sitstaynplaydogpark.com"
dayton,2k0b6y,dermal_denticles,1 point,Wed Oct 22 19:10:13 2014 UTC,"I've been to Oakwood, Xenia, and Social Row.  They all have advantages depending on where you live.  I'm closest to Oakwood, but it's the smallest and last time I was there it was pretty torn up.  Social Row was the biggest one, very nice, but it's pretty out of the way if you're not south of town.  Xenia was also nice, right off of 35, but again if you're not east of town it might be kinda far.  I'll have to check some of those others out, didn't know we had one right downtown!  Oh, and the one on Webster is actually up north of town attached to the ARC.  We got our dog there but never used the park - it looked big and nice, but I've heard there is a lot of un-policed poop.  YMMV."

dayton,2jwml1,FearAndLawyering,1 point,Wed Oct 22 14:33:44 2014 UTC,Doh. Thanks for that.
dayton,2jwml1,allthenerdythings,4,Thu Oct 23 03:34:01 2014 UTC,"This actually seems interesting, as a college kid who definitely can't afford a 3D printer but loves the idea of a craft space I can borrow I would definitely consider visiting!"
dayton,2jwml1,allthenerdythings,2,Wed Oct 22 04:45:03 2014 UTC,"I don't know how viable it is long term (you could definitely part with some money quickly in there) but the space is very cool and unlike anything else I have seen in the area. (I went to the ""soft"" opening Monday.) It's engineering student heaven."
dayton,2jwml1,allthenerdythings,1 point,Wed Oct 22 11:06:03 2014 UTC,"Could you elaborate a little more on the place? I wasn't able to learn a lot just from the pictures and captions. I am an engineering student, so I got pretty excited when I saw it!"
dayton,2jwml1,paulmoody,3,Wed Oct 22 15:07:41 2014 UTC,"Sure! I am not affiliated with the place, but this was my take: The actual bar area is small, but it's a full bar (craft beer, bourbon, espresso) with a wall of 3-D printers separating the bar area from ""maker tables"" as they call them. The whole space is decorated with well known industrialists, with a big tesla mural. (Apparently Edison is featured in the men's restroom, I suggested he moved to the urinal.) It's also the final resting place of Real Art's Santa Claw.  I don't know much about 3D printing so take this all with a grain of salt: I think there are roughly 8-ish printers, some with dual color filament, set up with kiosks for you to print from. (I believe you can bring your own templates in, as well.) They were running ""makerbot"" software as I recall. I think kit/sessions start at around $20. They seemed pretty flexible as to what you could make also, saying that if you had something that needed to render overnight, they could do it.  There's roughly the same amount of ""maker tables"" that can be rented hourly for $25 (which I thought was a little steep) complete with soldering irons, multimeters, magnifying-lens workbench lights and a laptop. A worker said they have alot of IC parts for sale ala carte, as well as rPI and Arduino stuff.  It strikes me as kind of a kid friendly place too, minus the bar obviously. The nicest touch was the ""song skip"" button, which is a giant button at the end of the corner bar seat that immediately skips the song on the PA. It's got a comfy, chill vibe overall. Definitely worth checking out once."

dayton,2jwml1,alethia_and_liberty,2,Wed Oct 22 15:50:30 2014 UTC,"This seems to me like it will lose it's luster very quickly. I mean, how many people need anything 3d printed? And multiple times a year, as you've got to have repeat business and not just single use customers? I don't know if this concept lasts more than a year to be honest, it just isn't a viable idea, especially with the limited foot traffic downtown. Maybe on a college campus, but even then you've gotta have deep pockets to afford the use. And wouldn't those who have money, already own their own 3d printer if they're into the technology? There's just too many question marks. I'm calling it now, out of business in 18 months."
dayton,2jwml1,FearStalksTheLand,1 point,Thu Oct 23 14:20:24 2014 UTC,"I agree with your reasoning but it's bankrolled by the Real Art owners and across the street from the dragons stadium, foot traffic will be no problem when they're in season.   I do wonder if the gimmick will wear out though. Cool spot nonetheless."

Sometimes they have a bounce house and live music too. The apples are great, and they have a barn store where you can buy pies, caramel apples, cider, etc. Only downside is everything is kind of pricy - I don't remember exactly, but I think each attraction is like $3/person, and the hay rides are maybe $7, pumpkins/apples aren't cheap, so it can add up. But it does get you all your fall family stuff in one location."

dayton,2ivjog,insomnyuk,1 point,Sun Oct 12 03:47:56 2014 UTC,"I certainly don't think someone's religious belief in say, human sacrifice, trumps others' human rights but I do think where we draw the line is a fascinating question. Obviously without seeing the movie I don't know what a young Jehovah's Witness's life is like so I'm in no position to answer my own question. I do think it is a very delicate question that if not answered carefully could start America down a very slippery slope. For example I don't think we should ever reach the point that Christian denominations are attacked legally for teaching Creationism because it's seen by the scientific community as forced ignorance and therefore some kind of human rights violation."
dayton,2ivjog,Enosh74,1 point,Sun Oct 12 13:16:58 2014 UTC,"I think people should go see the movie, participate in the Question & Answer and decide for themselves.  I don't get the impression that the film is calling for legal action against the Jehovah's Witnesses, if that is what you're getting at.  Do you think that it is healthy for people to ostracize those who are at their most vulnerable and weakest point?"
dayton,2iv6g8,insomnyuk,4,Fri Oct 10 16:05:18 2014 UTC,What I had read on this seemed to indicate that the city is considering a plan to adjust the water protection zone to account for the much lower water usage it has seen in the years since the exclusion zone was established.  By the criteria originally used the zone still well cover the area that would be contaminated within a year by a spill.  Have I misunderstood something here?

dayton,2ip3uu,adzm,3,Wed Oct 8 23:35:25 2014 UTC,"The immediate move would probably be one of the following:  Schedule a hearing at their administrative hearing. I've heard that Dayton has one where it is possible to win. They refunded mine because they were too busy to reschedule the hearing. Go to the next step if they don't.  Contact Mike Allen as he is currently suing Dayton over the fact the Ohio law and Constitution both appear to require this to be handled by the courts. He's gone the shotgun route and is trying to blast them on several points.  http://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/2014/03/25/attorney-who-sued-stopped-elmwood-traffic-cameras-sues-dayton/6861335/  That brings up the waiting game Ohio is in over this. In June the Ohio Supreme court heard testimony on whether the cities can ignore the law.  [(R.C. 1901.20(A)(1)] that is specifically authorized by the Ohio Constitution (Section 1, Article IV). The Ohio Supreme court even warned the cities of due process concerns when they ruled that this sort of traffic camera can be legal, but they have a history of having a cranial rectum inversion.   The General Assembly keeps promising they will act on it as well. They also have inversion issues."

Usually you see a provision for this in the company handbook and the direct deposit authorization.

dayton,2i9s3o,Chouette4u,6,Sat Oct 4 15:05:53 2014 UTC,"The final paycheck is considered a 'settle-up' check, where if you have outstanding things like uniform costs / other fees, they are deducted at that time.   What you're thinking of is that you can't be paid less than minimum wage for the hours you worked. This is true, but if you owe the company time/money for vacation time that you took that you had not yet earned, you have to settle up when you leave."

The airbrush might sound like it's going to be over the top, but it actually looks very natural compared to a lot of makeup and it lasts way better than anything else.  The girls were all good about doing the right amount of makeup on everyone according to what we said we wanted, so I wouldn't worry about being overdone.

Brains in a panic state don't always do a great job of interpreting events or making decisions.. prove he lied intentionally, otherwise people may be afraid of calling 911 because they don't want to be brought up on charges simply because they over reacted."

I think if other people were honestly scared this could be the case. But, in the video it clearly shows other customers (including an employee, mother with 3 children) walk past him, out into the Garden section and then back into the store, not glancing once or looking panicked. So, yes I think he was lying, or trying to create a story to make it seem worse. If there had been more panic in the store, maybe. But, you can clearly see other people (including the other victim) and they are clearly not scared."

If he thought it was a legitimate threat he should have tackled the guy and figured out what was up after that, calling police and at best being confused, was a chicken shit strategy.  I think when the family of 3 walk up and look in the aquarium the mother takes a couple weird glances at the victim and then ushers her family out of there.. unsure what is going on. They didn't seem panicked, but I did interpret her movements as being concerned. Did you see it that way also?"

dayton,2hjx3k,killwhiteppl,-3,Sat Sep 27 06:01:10 2014 UTC,I don't know why you were downvoted so much. If he is prosecuted then people will be less likely to call 911 in fear of giving wrong information. The cops in this case took what a random stranger said as fact instead of assessing the situation for themselves. The caller was an idiot but the cops acted too quickly on hearsay information.
dayton,2hjx3k,eng_pencil_jockey,2,Sat Sep 27 13:43:40 2014 UTC,"Totally random you just commented on that.. and I just looked.  I also don't understand why they were downvoted, I think anyone who can have a good debate, without attacking someone, should be listened to. We both have differing views and kept it civil, I appreciated that  And let me say this, there is a difference between calling 911 and telling factual events, and calling 911 and lying. I am sorry, but I do not believe that he actually thought he was seeing those things. I think his adrenaline may have been running, and he might have some sort of a ""hero complex"". I think they can find a way to go about this without making fear for calling 911.   Because weather people should be afraid to call 911 or now, LYING to a 911 operator is a felony, and he lied."
dayton,2hjx3k,killwhiteppl,1 point,Sat Sep 27 13:47:37 2014 UTC,"I think he exaggerated because he knows the pathetic state of police response. In Dayton at least, if you call and say there's some thug walking around with a gun it may (or may not) get a response within 30 minutes. He said what he thought was needed to get the police out there and teach the guy a lesson. The police interpreted it as a life and death situation and responded with the force they thought was necessary.  Ritchie is a pussy and should be brought up on charges of some sort.. I'm starting to agree with you, but I'm not sure what those charges should be."

Shooting and arrest of article  James Eagan Holmes:       On July 20, 2012, police arrested an unresisting Holmes next to his car behind the Century 16 theater, moments after the 2012 Aurora shooting, in which Holmes allegedly set off several gas or smoke canisters and then opened fire on the theater audience, killing 12 and wounding 70.  The responding officers recovered several guns from inside the car and the theater. According to two federal authorities, Holmes had dyed his hair orange and had called himself ""The Joker"".

The Colorado dude was sitting in his car and wasn't known to be the the shooter at the time.   With all of that said, answer me this. Why did the police show up to that Wal-Mart that day? Because Ronald Ritchie called 911 and grossly lied about everything he saw. Ronald Ritchie created, and induced the panic that resulted in a woman dying attempting to escape for the ""active shooter"" the Ronald Ritchie said was inside the Wal-Mart. Ronald Ritchie then caused another man to die who stood in the same spot for over 7 minutes and had multiple people walk past him without a care in the world."

You aren't enlightened, imparting your wisdom on all of us by taking a different stance than what actually happened. It is so abundantly clear as to what happened. Let me spell it out for you:   John was well within his rights. John died.   How the hell do you reconcile these? By blaming his death on himself? I, and any rational person, have a hard time buying into the kind of bullshit that implies that John had any responsibility of his own death.

Fearing that you'll be shot without any functional warning for merely carrying something that might, given only a cursory examination, resemble an actual gun is not a reasonable expectation.  Crawford did nothing wrong.  The easiest way to demonstrate that:    Walking around with a realistic gun will trigger that type of response   Is not true is to actually watch the video.  A mother, with two children, walked into the aisle with Crawford and was not at all concerned.  She looked around, left the aisle, went to other areas of the store, and even came walking back past it.  I'd expect that if anyone was going to worry about a gun-carrying maniac, it would probably be a mother who is currently with her children.  That she did not freak out tells us that a reasonable person, seeing this man, would not be concerned.  The asshole who called 911 and lied to them was clearly not reasonable, and so instigated a series of actions that were themselves unfortunate and also not the victim's fault."

The exact opposite of walking around menacingly,  thereby making it okay for someone to call the cops. You just defeated a central part of your argument with that statement.  He couldn't  have knowingly brought it upon himself, if he wasn't  fucking doing anything intentionally or unintentionally that would warrant  the kind of response or reaction that followed.  It's like you're saying blacks should be afraid to go to places like Beavercreek, where you imply they simply don't fit in, and then imply the same things about whites and Main Street. Racism, culture, ethnics, whatever the cause, this was wrong. Concerning the ""weapon"", I'm of the mind that they shouldn't  be selling this kind of shit in the first place, but what they will sell, people will buy. Not his fault. The guy that made the 911 call? Paranoia is what happened there, whatever the motivation in his mind for it. The cops reactions? Apparently, they forgot to assess the situation for themselves. They went in there with somebody else's assumptions (or just downright lies) as their guide. Not his fault. He was holding a gun the way all people who think ""guns are cool"" do, and possibly the way a person holding something they knew was no danger to anybody would, regardless of what  it was."

If he had keys, he would have been twirling them around.  A broom?  Same thing. Those officers shot pretty damn fast, and I don't like how municipalities are training police right now, which seems to be like soldiers.  It's not right, and I hope society takes a longer, more in depth look at this.  Should they face criminal charges for these particular actions?  No I don't think so, I think the training should be called into review.  Greene county and the people that live there shouldn't put up with this from THEIR police force.  How they actively police, and how they act in the community are up to the elected officials.  Vote accordingly. That dude who called 911... Something is not right.  I don't know if it's his tone, or how he's reporting the activities of the gun holder, but I really want to blame that guy for causing a panic.  What the video shows, and what he is describing... they just don't seem to accurately mesh.  It didn't peak his curiosity when the kids and woman just kind of went about their business in the same aisle?  At the same time he says ""He just pointed it at 2 children.""  Someone should follow up.   TLDR: Unfortunate man was thoughtless/careless, got shot by Police trained to react as fast as possible, all instigated by a 911 caller who can't seem to be trusted to read social ques."
dayton,2hc7si,sp1nz,9,Wed Sep 24 19:29:58 2014 UTC,"I was 100% with you until I finally saw the security tape just now. It's basically 7 minutes of a guy standing in a store aisle with a gun and then a cold blooded murder by police officer. If that's all you have to do as an officer, then any idiot can shoot first and ask questions later. Before viewing I thought perhaps he just have an inept officer, but that opinion has changed."
dayton,2hc7si,OswinOswald4,10,Wed Sep 24 23:46:36 2014 UTC,"got shot by Police trained to react as fast as possible   Assumptions about how they are trained aside, I don't feel like the police reacted at all.  They just saw him and shot him, irrespective of the facts of the situation.  Mr. Crawford was, so far as the police were told, walking around the store waving a gun around for 5 minutes.  Yet he hadn't fired it.  And when they see him, the gun is pointed at the ground, dude is talking on the phone, and he is shopping.  Like, looking at the shelves for something.  As far as I can tell, the first Mr. Crawford was aware of police presence in the store was when he got shot.  I don't care what the police heard from dispatch.  They get on the scene and can see with their own two eyes that the gun is not being pointed at anybody.  Mr. Crawford wasn't threatening anybody when he was shot.  That's not a justified shooting.  Policing is a tough job.  These officers were rightfully on a hair trigger.  But they literally jumped the gun here.  See man with gun pointed at floor?  Shoot man with gun pointed at floor!"
dayton,2hc7si,OswinOswald4,1 point,Wed Sep 24 23:01:21 2014 UTC,"..., irrespective of the facts of the situation.   I'm with you, but I'm also taken aback by the 911 caller, and the lack of verification on the side of the Police.  We have an adult male on a call with the 911 dispatcher; the facts presented on the call are, as relevant to the officers entering the store, there is a gunman pointing his weapon at children, and random people.  I'm pissed at the Police, and how they reacted.  I also understand why they ""jumped the gun"".  Because of that, I don't know that I could find them guilty in a courtroom... Fire them?  Yeah, I could go there.  This entire situation is terrible."
dayton,2hc7si,daytonthrowaway2,2,Thu Sep 25 13:11:17 2014 UTC,Police (peace officers) are not trained to shoot first and ask questions later. That is military training.
dayton,2hc7si,snkns,0,Thu Sep 25 20:55:15 2014 UTC,Well they did shoot with military rifles.
dayton,2hc7si,kennedysleftnut,3,Thu Sep 25 23:14:51 2014 UTC,"Except he never pointed it at anyone. One time he flipped it up to his shoulder but other than that it was just side to side facing the floor.   Even if it was a gun Ohio is an open carry state. The officers went in and shot him immediately based on ONE 911 call and no other information. It doesn't matter if these officer's were poorly trained, they murdered a man with no questions asked, no hesitation.  The officer who killed him deserves to be charged, he acted with gross negligence and an innocent man lost his life."
dayton,2hc7si,daytonthrowaway2,3,Thu Sep 25 20:49:25 2014 UTC,"That's pretty much my reaction as well.  The information that the police likely had was that there was an armed gunman threatening people in a public space. The police found a guy matching that description, with what appeared to be rifle, holding it by it's handle. Given what they had been told and what they found, it was reasonable to believe that he was dangerous. If he was in actuality dangerous and the gun was a high powered gun like it appeared to be, then others very likely could have been killed if the police hesitated to remove him as a threat."
dayton,2hc7si,kennedysleftnut,10,Wed Sep 24 20:24:25 2014 UTC,others very likely could have been killed if the police hesitated to remove him as a threat   Well he hadn't killed anybody in the several minutes before the police arrived.  And there wasn't anybody nearby him when the police arrived.    Is that how public shootings ever happen?  Guy with an assault rifle hellbent on hurting people waits until he's caught unawares by the police to start spraying the place with bullets?

The employee, of course, had to notify someone higher up and that guy was in the process of determining whether to call the police."
dayton,2hc7si,insomnyuk,3,Wed Sep 24 20:28:05 2014 UTC,"I would question alarmed... but, for sure, out of the ordinary.  I actually think the store handled it fairly well, trying to keep calm, and not scare anyone.  I wish the police would have taken another beat, and given the guy more time.  Then again, what if it was real?  We'd be pissed because the cops didn't run in shooting and the guy was able to wound/kill civilians.  It's sad all around."

Everything and everyone felt so close, and it was this great little world we all lived together in. Except the dark side, of course.  Now UD stretches practically to the river, and being on the other side of Brown just seems so far away.  Any current students, or recent alumni, care to comment?"

Feed at a feed store is geared toward show animals, and doesn't contain steroids as those are banned by the USDA. It may contain antibiotics, but just learn how to properly read a feed tag and you can avoid that. Your OSU extension office in your county will have a lot of literature on raising healthy hogs. :)  When we raised pigs and sheep, we just kept a few tons of shelled field corn from the harvest for their feed. Maybe look for a local farmer that will sell you a few trash cans full for cash. Also, Trupoint is the cooperative in this area, they will be your best feed store bet. They are pretty friendly."

The program provides a vehicle for bringing abandoned tax delinquent property back into productive use via: 1)  Acquisition of tax delinquent vacant lots by those seeking lots for yard or home expansion, building of garages, urban gardens, etc.; and 2)  Acquisition of tax delinquent abandoned housing stock by those willing to perform the rehab work or demolition and new housing construction. Abandoned tax delinquent commercial properties may also be acquired via Lot Links.  More info at: http://www.cityofdayton.org/departments/pcd/Pages/LotLinksProgram.aspx"

dayton,2grbv3,cockpitatheist,5,Thu Sep 18 13:21:26 2014 UTC,It's hard to find cheap fruit out of season.  If you're looking for seasonal goods I suggest checking out:  Monin Fruit Farm   Berryhill  Fulton Farms  Just to name a few. Dayton just doesn't seem to have all the importing resources that these bigger communities have. Also I highly recommend gardening...or finding a community garden in your neighborhood. It taste much better when it's freshly grown.
dayton,2grbv3,brandilion,4,Thu Sep 18 14:02:54 2014 UTC,"There's a farmer's market on Fridays on Wilmington Pk at 675 where the Cub Foods used to be.  It's gotten bigger in recent years, and they have a lot of good stuff for pretty good prices.  There is also a fruit stand a bit farther down the road where Wilmington meets 725 next to the walgreens, but it's not always open.   Also near the intersections of 725 and Rt 4 close to Germantown, there's a great Apple shop that sells freshly picked apples and their own cider."

If you're looking for something cheaper, Danberry Dollar Savers theatre near the mall is a good place to catch movies that have been out for a while."

It's nice and they encourage small businesses more than Beavercreek -- which has felt increasingly superficial to me over the past few years, though it's relatively far from Dayton proper.   I would avoid the Greene at all costs.  I know quite a few people who looked at apartments there, and without fail they found faults -- most notably that the walls are apparently paper thin.  Kettering has some varied areas.  West of the Greene and South of Dorothy Lane is a nice area, while (eg.,) north of Dorothy Lane near Smithville/Wilmington Pike could use some work."

Dunno what the downtown places are like RE: pets, but if you think you might want one at some point, it's probably worth checking into their policies.    Beavercreek also has no income tax, so if you work and live in Beavercreek, you don't have to pay any city taxes, but I believe if you work in Beavercreek and live somewhere that does have income tax, you have to pay it there.  If you find somewhere else that's a lot cheaper, it probably evens out, but I enjoy being able to file my federal and state taxes online and call it done.

I'll be driving down interstates here at 7 pm on a saturday night and it will be a parking lot and all six lanes are just sitting still.   The 35/75 didn't drive me crazy though due to traffic, it was the absolutely incessant construction. I lived there 3 years and not one day passed without an exit closed or a lane shutdown. I've heard it's been that way for 30 years.   I always enjoyed the 675 though, I miss it, the traffic always flowed and I could get anywhere I needed to quickly.

dayton,2ghqnb,TribalLion,2,Tue Sep 16 01:52:58 2014 UTC,"Trust me, while I was there, I never complained about it. But the 35 while I was there and the 75 were just ridiculous. Constant construction. Never a moment where that didn't hold true.   But my comment about 30 years was not about the 35, it was about the 75. I can't vouch for the 35.   However, Dayton doesn't really have bad roads, just absolutely horrible drivers. The drivers out here are fantastic compared to Ohio. And this is a big city where everyone hates one another and cuts you off for any reason possible. Still better than drivers in ohio where the smallest snow flurry caused panic. I'll never understand that."

dayton,2g9dby,Booba_ooba,8,Sat Sep 13 03:00:57 2014 UTC,"If I'm remembering correctly, there were problems the same night as the Urban Nights event earlier this year.  It's really a shame because Urban Nights is a great event that showcases a lot of interesting, positive things about Dayton. It's a shame that Urban Nights is getting a black-eye because of the actions of a group of people that want to make their lives seem interesting by creating drama and acting tough. It's too bad that they aren't contributing to building the community up, instead of tearing it down."
dayton,2g9dby,mission_transition,3,Sat Sep 13 13:51:00 2014 UTC,Probably thinking of this http://reddit.com/r/dayton/comments/25gdpt/david_esrati_describes_getting_assaulted_at_urban/  Tl;dr  Esrati barely provokes the thugs that hangout at the main street end of the hub on a night when the group was 10x it's normal force and gets his ass kicked.

dayton,2g9dby,dirething,3,Tue Sep 16 00:39:46 2014 UTC,"The guy is a douche sometimes, but as far as I heard the only thing he was doing was shooting some video with his phone.  Being slightly annoying doesn't translate to getting beat up in my book, and if you work near the rta hub you know that isn't an isolated thing other than the size of the crowd."

We had no clue what the fuck.  Edit: this report doesn't state it, but I saw several people get maced and a lot of kids were dropping their backpacks, bags, weed scales, etc. as they were flooding the streets."
dayton,2g9dby,dirething,12,Sat Sep 13 05:09:45 2014 UTC,Six tickets for disorderly conduct have been issued to juveniles stemming from the fighting.  Not news.  But this just adds ammo to the people that claim downtown is unsafe.
dayton,2g9dby,AgentFreckles,4,Sat Sep 13 03:51:14 2014 UTC,"Six caught from one incident, so 100 involved seems realistic & newsworthy if you are planning on attending the event."
dayton,2g9dby,2rideascooter,3,Sat Sep 13 17:06:06 2014 UTC,"Downtown is pretty dangerous at night. I used to live downtown, in an apartment that overlooks Club Vex, and while that club was always fucked up and had several people throwing punches right outside of it every Friday and Saturday, I didn't know the extent of it until I witnessed something insane. My boyfriend and I witnessed a straight up street fight. Several people were involved, around 25, one guy got his ass BEAT and afterwards the guys who did it saw the damage they caused and decided to just leave him for dead in the street. We immediately called the cops but nobody picked up. That's right -- the police didn't fucking pick up the phone. This was the first time we saw a street fight happen out there, but it definitely wasn't even close to being the first time we saw extreme violence right outside our window.  Similarly with that RTA hub on Jefferson, always saw several drug deals go down and fighting, and deals happening at Cold Beer & Cheeseburgers. Once saw a dude get mugged & beat up close to that urban clothing store on the corner of 3rd and St. Clair.  Edit: Also wanted to add that once my car got broken into, window smashed out and some non valuables taken. Be safe downtown people."

dayton,2g9dby,MrsFunner,2,Sat Sep 13 11:15:05 2014 UTC,"I work across the street from that rta hub, This happens from time to time.  Most days it is just panhandlers, a few dealers, and folks going to and from jail/court with maybe 15 thugs on main st side up to no good.  The police generally do a good job keeping it contained to the surrounding streets except third street to the courts & jail.  There are a few tenants in the surrounding buildings that have found it enough of a nuance to not renew their leases, but generally it isn't an issue a block or two away.  During these urban events there just aren't enough police to keep ahead of it when rta is bringing in troublemakers in volume.    Used to work out fine for me as my employer generally sent people home early during these shit shows to avoid problems, New management not so much, so I get to have mandatory vacation time now."

Unsure how long the deal will be available but you have until mid December to actually goto Costco and sign up for your membership if you purchased today.  Membership doesn't start until you activate at the store itself.

dayton,2g3ssx,friardon,9,Thu Sep 11 14:21:37 2014 UTC,"I really like the stuff people have suggested so far!  I would like to say that Dayton needs more art, and a place for people of any race and faith (or lack of) to feel comfortable hanging out.  I live just outside of downtown and I don't have any where to go where I can make friends, study, or socialize (aside from school!) because I'm non-religious, white, and very poor.  I would love to have a place open to adults where I can learn and create.  Maybe you could offer language tutoring and classes about culture to help people learn to understand the different cultures in Dayton!  My neighborhood has Indians, blacks, whites, and latinos all living on the same block but we don't interact much and I think it has a lot to do with cultural fears."

dayton,2g3ssx,theWgame,3,Thu Sep 11 22:23:00 2014 UTC,"Drugs, violence and a lack of security. Also the level of health is terrible, I used to be sick all the time and get my extended family sick everytime I saw them, all from just being inside that building. That's what really broke it for me."

dayton,2g3ssx,OswinOswald4,2,Thu Sep 11 18:46:27 2014 UTC,"Please do not believe that. Drugs are a SERIOUS issue in Dayton as a whole so of course the shelters will also have problems with drugs. When drugs are found they are dealt with and violence even more so. I have never felt unsafe while volunteering there.    St Vincent operates the only shelters in Montgomery county, really the only shelters in southern ohio where you will not be turned away no matter the time of day.   OP- get involved, research the local organizations, speak with people who are tuned in to the area."

We have enough places that require adherence for assistance. Let other groups use your chapel area for services as well. Encourage education of many views, not one.   Have an ""unbelievers united "" night or something. Build a nice play area, and secure it well, but don't lock it down.   Art."

I think there is a large chasm between believers and unbelievers where they are afraid to even be cordial to each other, much less friends."
dayton,2g3ssx,BlindlyWatching,10,Thu Sep 11 16:30:09 2014 UTC,"Haha, I'm not art, that was just my final suggestion.   Well, a lot of people enjoy the community and social aspects of a church, but may have issues with belief, doctrine, political leanings, etc typically associated with church. I've even heard of entire secular congregations.   So if there was a totally non ""right answer"" minded gathering, many who would never consider attending might have a reason to check it out. There's plenty of issues of human and community betterment we can tackle without bringing after lives into the mix. From meeting and discussing community art projects, to helping poorer kids gain access to instruments, etc. food services, building projects... A lot of people working united to better all will always get more done than a group only concerned with othe like people."

Maybe with older generations there is a larger disconnect between the two, but with people my age and younger there is very little issue with one another. As a non-believer I have many friends who are believers (some of which are on the more extreme end of the spectrum) and non-believers. Only once have I had an issue with someone my age or younger being negative about my views."

(Amar is by the dayton mall)  Pho Mi by the Dayton mall for decent Vietnamese food.  Bills Donuts (good 24 hour donut/coffee and hangout place)  Press or Ghostlight for coffee.   Sweetpeas (unique desserts)  If your into hiking then check out Daytons Metroparks. We have amazing local parks, way better than average. http://www.metroparks.org/  Also, don't forget the bike trails if that's your thing and check out the 2nd street market if you find yourself here on the weekend."

dayton,2fz0c9,juanqp,5,Wed Sep 10 03:08:00 2014 UTC,"Dayton code 70.121 requires that speed cameras work in conjunction with an intersection with a traffic light. A camera not at a light does not meet the legal definition (section B) of an “automated traffic control photographic system” (ATCPS). It cannot not impose “monetary liability on the owner of a vehicle.” (Section A 1) Even if they could get around that problem, any camera that is not at an intersection does not meet the requirements of a “notice of liability” in section D 1 d in that they can’t list the intersection as required. I have seen a couple and they only list the street and not the intersection.  They aren't even trying to follow the law that supposedly authorizes these anymore. It's just a pure cash play."

They make a lot of it in house: mustard, cheese, sauerkraut, etc. It was pretty tasty.   They aren't brewing yet because, like you side, licensing issues. But the brewmaster and a few other employees are there to talk you through the process and the types of beers they plan to brew. It is also really neat to see what process and tools they are using. The recipe for the spiced ale is actually one that was found in a diary of a housewife back in the 1850's and is what she served for guests or something of that nature. It's all really fun.

Unless you are an engineer, have a masters degree, a security clearance, and impressive resume, do not come here and expect to be happy with the job outlook.

They learned from last time (1990's) to make more terminations than relocation offers.  Granted, employers still exist but Georgia's theft relocation of NCR put a damper on the non-AFB job market.  It added a lot of people looking for work on top of everyone else, something likely to still affect the job market today.

They have been building and upgrading it for over 100 years. It's not economical for any near by municipality to build their own when they can just buy water from dayton. We supply the whole county.  The county tried to set up its own system just to strong arm a better deal but they literally can't pump good water. We are sitting on one of the nation's largest, deepest and healthiest aquifers.

This is the problem I am talking about.  You have no real choice in who actually provides the services of maintaining the Dayton aquifer. When you say ""we are sitting on the nation's largest, deepest and healthiest aquifers"" you should be aware that ""we"" don't actually control or sit on anything - we are forced to pay taxes which go to monopoly that happens to do a decent job in some cases, and a shitty job in others.

dayton,2fadfd,Stoooway,4,Tue Sep 2 19:47:57 2014 UTC,"So, the term mini pig is pretty misleading. They actually only stay tiny if you starve then during adolescence. My mom has two adult ""mini"" pigs, but I doubt they're what you have in mind. They're fucking huge, like three hundred pounds each. Apparently, they're still smaller than a normal pig."
dayton,2fadfd,MrsFunner,4,Tue Sep 2 20:44:35 2014 UTC,This. Most mini pigs are abandoned because of how large they get and because of destructive behavior. Please make sure you are informed before you get a pet. I also would recommend not get not getting a pet for someone as a gift. You would be getting her a responsibility for her birthday.
dayton,2fadfd,purplhappyhippo,4,Wed Sep 3 02:31:08 2014 UTC,"I'm glad others have pointed this out.  You can read the helpfully titled, Never Buy a Teacup Pig article.   Teacup pigs” (also sometimes sold as “micro pigs,” “pocket pigs” and “Juliana pigs”) are a marketing scam reaching back at least two decades, if not more. It works like this: Breeders put up listings for “teacup pigs,” promising to sell petite porkers a pig that’ll stay permanently tiny. Buyers then pay anywhere from $750 to over $3,500 for their teacup pig. The buyer then watches as that tiny pig becomes a larger adolescent pig, then a very large, very non-teacup-sized hog  ... Like Hilton, some teacup pig buyers are taken in by websites that claim teacup pigs will be as small as 12 pounds. One site promises to sell potential buyers “Super Micro Nano Teacup Pig~ 12 LBS and up (very rare).” The problem, says Kim-Han, is that that’s impossible to guarantee a pig that small. “Yes, there are a few pigs that are in the fifty to seventy pound range that aren’t starved,” she says, “but they’re far and few between. We almost never see them.” More typical is a pig that grows to around 100 pounds. “A really big dog, that’s about as small as you can hope for,” say Dr. Khuly.   Besides their large size, the article also notes that pigs are notoriously difficult to housetrain, and their beginnings as prey -- as opposed to predator like dogs and cats -- leads them to be fearful of strangers, even when well trained."

dayton,2ev3sk,captainpixystick,6,Sat Sep 6 12:55:54 2014 UTC,This video is retarded.  Have you ever even been outside of the US? Do you know what an actual police state looks like? Ever seen an actual militia setting up roadblocks? Bodies in mass graves? Grow up.
dayton,2ev3sk,bnevs92,-5,Fri Aug 29 16:29:16 2014 UTC,"Yeah, it's not like we have the largest prison industrial complex in history with more people incarcerated more than even Stalin's gulags or anything like that."
dayton,2ev3sk,brickremmington,-7,Fri Aug 29 17:25:30 2014 UTC,"No, I just compared the numbers of prisoners in the United States, to the numbers of prisoners in Stalin's gulags, which is true. Can't you read?"
dayton,2ev3sk,brickremmington,5,Fri Aug 29 18:14:36 2014 UTC,"The incarceration rate in the United States of America is the highest in the world. As of 2009 [update], the incarceration rate was 743 per 100,000 of national population 0.743%. Roughly 10 percent of Russians were in Stalin's Gulags from 1929 to 1953."
dayton,2ev3sk,bnevs92,5,Fri Aug 29 18:32:12 2014 UTC,"Here I'll do it for him.  In total, 6,977,700 adults were under correctional supervision (probation, parole, jail, or prison) in 2011 – about 2.9% of adults in the U.S. resident population. Estimates have Stalins gulags populations anywhere from 14 to 18 million people. Sounds like our informer is really a misinformer."

dayton,2es077,DmKrispin,1 point,Thu Aug 28 12:48:56 2014 UTC,...I mean seriously.  The lawyer defending the victim said the victim was wronged.  Who knew!
dayton,2es077,Houndie,0,Thu Aug 28 16:08:06 2014 UTC,He unboxed a realistic looking bb gun and was walking around the store with it without the box.  This is extremely unusual behavior.  If I were there I would have called the cops and GTFO.  Hindsight is 20/20 but John Crawford brought this on himself.
dayton,2es077,roach8101,10,Thu Aug 28 13:38:42 2014 UTC,"Do you have a source that verifies that he unboxed the gun?  His lawyer claims that it was already unboxed when he picked it up off the shelf:  But Wright told The Daily Caller that the video viewed by the family showed that the “gun was not in packaging when Mr. Crawford picked it up from the shelf.”  Obviously, his lawyer is a biased source, that's why I'm inquiring whether you have another."
dayton,2es077,electrolytextc,-2,Thu Aug 28 14:08:07 2014 UTC,"I guess I don't really know but I haven't seen these sold just ""off the shelf"" before."
dayton,2es077,roach8101,1 point,Thu Aug 28 14:11:52 2014 UTC,John Crawford brought this on himself.   I can't even begin to imagine why you would think this.
dayton,2es077,eng_pencil_jockey,1 point,Thu Aug 28 14:36:53 2014 UTC,Should it be spelled out for you? He was acting in a strange behavior with what many thought was a deadly weapon.
dayton,2es077,eng_pencil_jockey,10,Thu Aug 28 14:46:56 2014 UTC,"He was acting 100% within his rights. Even if the gun wasn't already unboxed, it is WalMart policy that you are allowed to do so. According to the lawyer, there were people in the same aisle as him that weren't startled whatsoever.  Even if the lawyer is showing some bias, I doubt he's lying completely.   Can you please, then, spell out for me why a young man acting well within his rights deserved to die?"
dayton,2es077,MrsFunner,4,Thu Aug 28 15:00:54 2014 UTC,"Until we see the video, we are going off what the attorney is telling us in interpretation. Witnesses and police reports originally said he would not respond to police telling him to drop the weapon and get on the ground. Bottom line is we don't know until all information is released.  So, correct me if I am wrong; Are you assuming that Beavercreek police march into Walmart, guns drawn, find this guy in the toy department with his back turned to the police and with no warning open fire?"
dayton,2es077,FearAndLawyering,6,Thu Aug 28 15:16:06 2014 UTC,"So, correct me if I am wrong; Are you assuming that Beavercreek police march into Walmart, guns drawn, find this guy in the toy department with his back turned to the police and with no warning open fire?   Not quite. According to his girlfriend, the police opened fire after John said ""It's not real."" Honestly, if I had to guess, I'd guess that police issued a verbal warning, and instead of dropping the weapon, he first turned around to see what was happening (instinctual, if somebody is yelling at you from behind you'll turn around). That action was not dropping the weapon, so he was shot."
dayton,2es077,MrsFunner,-2,Thu Aug 28 15:26:42 2014 UTC,"Well, if he was inducing panic by walking around with a realistic looking BB gun, that's not within his rights. I'm not saying he deserved to die, but no one has the right to induce panic and there are likely to be consequences."
dayton,2es077,Ruskerdax,8,Thu Aug 28 15:06:15 2014 UTC,"The only people ""panicked"" are the 911 callers who swatted him.  And there's shit laying open in walmart everywhere."

dayton,2es077,Ruskerdax,2,Fri Aug 29 11:13:14 2014 UTC,"I'm not saying he deserved to die, just that he was doing something I don't like or agree with and should be shot. No one has a right to do things I don't like."
dayton,2es077,MrsFunner,1 point,Fri Aug 29 03:00:35 2014 UTC,I don't care where I'm at but if someone is walking around with a gun it's most likely the the people around are going to be concerned if they can't tell it's not real right away. This guy thought he was being funny with it. Well this is real life and people don't find this shit funny especially the cops that most likely gave him orders that he didn't follow because he thinks he's a comedian.
dayton,2es077,Ruskerdax,1 point,Fri Aug 29 04:09:15 2014 UTC,"I'm not saying people deserve to be shot and killed for not immediately complying with orders from people who wear costumes with badges, but I am saying it's totally reasonable to expect that such a thing should happen, and I generally have no problem with it."
dayton,2es077,MrsFunner,-2,Fri Aug 29 13:42:42 2014 UTC,"You're being ridiculous, that's not what I said at all.  None of us know the facts enough to make an informed decision as to what happened that day."
dayton,2es077,Ruskerdax,1 point,Fri Aug 29 11:12:36 2014 UTC,"It's what you implied.  I know enough about the situation to say with certainty that the police will not be held accountable for the shooting of an unarmed person, certainly not in the way that lesser, non-badge wearing subclass citizens would be."
dayton,2es077,brickremmington,-1,Fri Aug 29 11:26:21 2014 UTC,That's not what I meant our implied at all. Getting upset about what you perceive without any facts seems to be a habit for you.

dayton,2ehd0n,Cabagekiller,5,Mon Aug 25 06:58:22 2014 UTC,"Honestly, I'd recommend Ghostlight over Press for coffee. Press is an absolutely gorgeous shop, but I find the people that frequent there to be snooty - in my experience, the know-it-all attitude that comes out of there is really off-putting. I think Ghostlight has equally good coffee and a more kitschy, down-to-earth vibe, and it's just a minute or two from Press.  Both have great coffee, though!"

dayton,2egquy,autowikibot,1 point,Sun Aug 24 19:41:22 2014 UTC,"Rapeseed:       Rapeseed (Brassica napus), also known as rape,  oilseed rape,  rapa, rappi, rapaseed (and, in the case of one particular group of cultivars, canola), is a bright-yellow flowering member of the family Brassicaceae (mustard or cabbage family), (油菜 p yóucài) consumed in China as a vegetable (yu choy). The name derives from the Latin for turnip, rāpa or rāpum, and is first recorded in English at the end of the 14th century. Older writers usually distinguished the turnip and rape by the adjectives 'round' and 'long' (-'rooted'), respectively.  Rutabagas, Brassica napobrassica, are sometimes considered a variety of B. napus. Some botanists also include the closely related B. campestris within B. napus.

Back in '07, I had gotten a job in Dayton and was looking for an apartment instead of commuting the 1.5 hour trip twice a day. I had walked in to check out Stonebridge and was told I had to schedule a tour because nothing was ready to show. I said okay, and set something up for my lunch break a week later.  Come the day of the appointment, I started driving in the parking lot and sections were blocked off, and multiple news vans were nearby.

If only we could afford to build something extremely spectacular, a tourist attraction of some sort, in the heart of downtown."

dayton,2e6xbn,TheOriginalGK,3,Thu Aug 21 19:23:53 2014 UTC,"Yeah, because I love asbestos and mold!  I had a chance to tour the arcade after the most recent purchase. Its was an '80 time machine! It even smelled like High School!  It was a VERY sad and broken place.  ALSO..... you cannot have nice things downtown until you fix the existing problems."
dayton,2e6xbn,donsmash,1 point,Thu Aug 21 19:31:04 2014 UTC,What do you think would be a good starting point for fixing downtown's problems?
dayton,2e6xbn,MrsFunner,3,Thu Aug 21 22:20:54 2014 UTC,"As far as I can tell, one if downtown's biggest problems is that suburbanites are irrationally afraid of going there."
dayton,2e6xbn,TheOriginalGK,3,Fri Aug 22 01:01:00 2014 UTC,"My irrational fear went away after a friend was beaten with a bat for her purse leaving an OD bar. My real fear started after seeing several people produce and then use guns at or near the RTA hub. I was always a huge supporter of the Century. These days, I hate when its suggested because it makes me sad that I would rather not go there due to the violence across the street."
dayton,2e6xbn,TheLuckyMrsD,0,Sun Aug 24 00:57:05 2014 UTC,"Sheesh. So many haters :P I toured the arcade when they had it open at Urban Nights after the recent purchase, too. The Skylight is incredible, and the kitchy vibe is exactly what could make it cool. If the taxes weren't so helacious that private industry could come in and clean it up while preserving the historic bits, it would help. And if the city simultaneously cleaned up the area around it with the kind of effort that went into making riverscape nice it could really be something. Part of the city of Dayton's problem is that it can't decide which part of it it wants to clean up and make nice this week (is it Riverscape? The Area around 5/3 field? The Schuster center? The Oregon District?) so all of it is just pockets of niceness in a big mess. It's not that the suburbanites are afraid of going there, it's that there's nothing to go there for. If I'm not seeing a show at the Schuster or they don't have stuff set up for Urban nights, or it's not a morning that the 2nd Street Market is open there is literally no reason at all for me to go downtown. And even then, North market in Columbus is bigger and nicer and not very far, and I don't go to the theatre that often. There is nowhere to shop downtown, there are plenty of restraunts that are just as nice in other places, I'm not into the club scene so that has zero draw for me, too. It's not like the Short North where there are interesting and unique things that downtown offers you can't see anywhere else. If they could launch a full scale restoration effort to make the Arcade nice again, keep the area safe and secure it would offer something unique I couldn't get in Centerville or Beavercreek, and it would offer an indoor alterntive to the Greene with more character than the Mall at Fairfield Commons. I would be motivated to go."
dayton,2e6xbn,TheOriginalGK,2,Fri Aug 22 13:34:46 2014 UTC,"Lots of really good points! I think if the city were to ask the people what to work on you would get what you have now. Pockets of nice. Im of the opinion that they should start at the river and do a block at a time. If people love it and they can keep it profitable (not use tax $) it would be great! Sadly, as it stands now, I often laugh when someone tries to convince me that moving down there would be great. It might be if I could get groceries and not be hassled by the thugs and the homeless."

I suggest actually selecting cities by using school district because of township funkiness and stuff.  You can also set price parameters and anything else that is important to you.  Centerville, Bellbrook, Kettering and Beavercreek are going to be the best locations for what you are describing, but your price range might be a little unrealistic depending on what you are expecting square footage-wise and the condition of the house."

dayton,2dya7k,curlymike,3,Tue Aug 19 05:14:07 2014 UTC,"Honestly when I was apartment hunting a few years back, 450-550 could get you a whole lot more than a studio apartment, and, while I know pricing has gone up, I don't know by how much.  If you want to live actually downtown, you could check out St. Clair Apartments or The Cannery.  However, if you want to live ""almost downtown"", you'll probably have a lot better luck.  Go on craigslist and try and look up places in the Oregon District, South Park, St. Anne's Hill, and Huffman...they're all historic neighborhoods within a 5-15 minute walk downtown, and you can usually find apartments/duplexes for rent there.  Another good strategy is simply to drive around the districts and look for for-rent signs."

What I would suggest is to attend a few small conventions, see what you like and where a new one would fit in and start it VERY small as a one day event, if that does well, step it up and start advertising hardcore.

I got the chance to talk to a couple people who the program helped overcome things us born citizens don't even think about.  For example - apparently a lot of immigrants (especially from the Middle East) aren't aware that banks are something a normal person uses, or that the police are who you contact if something illegal happens. Often where they come from neither organization can be trusted, so they are trained to handle things privately.  I'm glad we have an organization that makes immigrants feel welcome, connects them to the community and helps them become contributing members of society."

dayton,2d46c9,GuzTathums,3,Sun Aug 10 03:52:22 2014 UTC,I actually know the reason for this. One of my friends (the bride) married a guy from a family that was well-off. His family hired a small fireworks company to do a small show. I'm not kidding. I was super surprised when the fireworks started going off. I was only a standard guest in the wedding but damn man. It was one of the most expensive weddings I've ever been to. I never knew they had money like that.   Edit: the early pictures are finally coming from the photographer. Here is some proof. The fucking Batmobile was there as well... I didn't even know it was there... I'm pissed that I missed that thing now. This wedding was insanely huge. I don't think I met or covered 50% of it walking around and mingling. It started in Beavercreek and we ended off at Linden / Dayton Xenia.

dayton,2d3lw8,juanqp,4,Sun Aug 10 01:07:07 2014 UTC,"With so many in the suburbs paying Dayton city taxes, it's no surprise they'd want to influence the election. It seems to me that if you pay income tax in a city you should be able to vote there too."
dayton,2d3lw8,juanqp,0,Sun Aug 10 05:36:11 2014 UTC,That would be an unmanageable labyrinth of complexity to add to elections.  Why should someone get to vote in two different places?
dayton,2d3lw8,scienceonly,3,Sun Aug 10 15:43:19 2014 UTC,"I'm not saying it's a good idea to allow people to vote in two places, but you could allow people to vote on local issues only. Administering it could be a mess, but it could be done.  The better way would be to honor the American founding principal that there should be no taxation without representation. Why should a municipality be allowed to impose income tax on people who can't vote there? With only 14 states even allowing municipalities to tax income, it's obvious that we can avoid this kind of taxation without representation.  One of the worst abuses is in Sycamore Township where they set up a JEDZ which will tax income there, but will refund residents. They've set up a scheme that will only tax the people who can't vote. That's why no one should be subject to an income tax without a vote."

dayton,2d3lw8,MrsFunner,2,Sun Aug 10 19:14:28 2014 UTC,Why should someone have to pay taxes where they aren't allowed to vote?
dayton,2d3lw8,MrsFunner,4,Wed Aug 13 01:26:04 2014 UTC,"Oh. I guess I didn't look at city vs. suburbs. Honestly, if the suburbanites want to donate money that doesn't bother me, as a city dweller. What happens in the city does affect them. It's not like they get to vote, they just get to try to manipulate who we vote for. You didn't outright say it was suspicious, but you seem to be spending a lot of time trying to uncover something. So I assumed you thought it was suspicious."

Based on the information available so far, there's absolutely no reason to be calling for the heads of the police officers.   And even more baffling, some people are even upset with the people (or person) who called the police. Are you shitting me?!? A man is walking around a Walmart, with what would appear to look like a firearm (shit, its purposely meant to look like one), and you're upset someone would call the police?   And let's just say the guy who called the police was racist, as seems to be a popular opinion. We don't even know if he is, but I'll just agree and say he is just to make my point. So. Fucking. What. A racist called the police because a man had a gun in a public shopping center. How does his racism make him wrong for doing that?   Some people, especially on here, are trying so desperately to point the finger at anyone other than the guy who died, they'll spew the most absurd shit from their mouths."

dayton,2cvrre,Tapeleg91,-3,Fri Aug 8 01:10:54 2014 UTC,"It doesn't add up in that way. The only scenario that I can muster that makes any sense is the one where he did not receive ample warning before getting killed.   First, the description of ""waving around"" was received by the police from the couple that called 911. They also reported that he was purposefully pointing it at children. Being that he was so cavalier with the treatment of the supposed weapon (because, in fact, it was fake), I doubt he was very careful about where he was pointing it. It's not a real gun.  So we have two narratives to the story:   Elderly couple sees African American with a rifle in a public store, and he's waving it around like a madman, and pointing it at children (We don't know why he'd act like that, maybe he was crazy). Elderly couple calls 911, cops show up. Cops instruct man to put down the (fake) firearm. Man realizes the situation, and refuses to put down the fake gun (again, this doesn't make sense). Cops shoot and kill man in self-defense. Justice served. Elderly couple sees a young African American being overly cavalier with what seems to be a rifle. Elderly couple grows concerned at exactly how cavalier the man is with the gun, as it ends up being in a situation where sometimes it's pointing right at small children. Elderly couple assumes the worst. Elderly couple calls 911, tells them there's an African American man pointing a rifle at children. Cops assume the worst. Cops show up. Cops instruct the man to put down the weapon, but since the man is on the phone, the first warning doesn't register. Cops see this as defiance, and shoot the man in ""self-defense."" Justice... served.   I don't know about you, but 1 makes absolutely no sense. It just doesn't. You can't reconcile that fact. In order for the story to make any sort of sense, the victim had to have been a crazy person who gets off on going into Wal-Mart late at night and pointing unloaded (it was off the shelf) airsoft guns at children SO MUCH SO that he would rather die then cease his behavior. This is an unbelievable, fantastical, and ultimately ridiculous portrayal of any 1 of about 99.9% of all people.   It just doesn't make sense.  However, a slightly racist elderly couple, and a police force that is somewhat sloppy at handling this kind of situation (I don't imagine there are many standoffs in Beavercreek...)? That's much more believable.   Why is this a travesty? No matter the narrative, what was this man's crime? Being in possession of a fake gun. And if being in possession of a fake gun is a crime that warrants getting killed, then I don't have a hell of a clue of what's ""law-abiding"" anymore."

dayton,2cvrre,Blu3j4y,11,Fri Aug 8 04:15:26 2014 UTC,I think an easier solution is to not take any sort of gun (real or toy) into public places and start waving it around like an asshole.

dayton,2cvrre,UCgirl,5,Thu Aug 7 15:41:52 2014 UTC,The only way you truly know if a gun is real or fake is to pull the trigger.. If it's pointed at someone that is a life or death decision. An orange tip means nothing when it's pointed at you.
dayton,2cvrre,sick937,6,Thu Aug 7 17:44:33 2014 UTC,"Oh, I agree with you - I was being snarky about the police being at fault.  It's a life or death decision BEFORE it's pointed at someone.  It takes no time at all to raise the gun and pull the trigger."
dayton,2cvrre,sick937,10,Thu Aug 7 15:52:20 2014 UTC,"Agreed, but these people who are downvoting seem to feel that if it has an orange tip it means 100% the gun is fake. They are unable to put themselves into the police's situation and understand:  A person is acting irrational with a gun in public, that little orange tip doesn't mean anything.. I sure as hell wouldn't bet my life on an orange tip. They don't get that.. apparently."

dayton,2cwa94,vTweak,7,Thu Aug 7 18:24:27 2014 UTC,How does the plot thicken?
dayton,2cvr06,Fortescue82,5,Thu Aug 7 13:28:46 2014 UTC,"I like the idea, but I'm going to play devil's advocate (ignoring liquor license stuff, because you get the difficulty of obtaining that). Understand that I like few things more than to grabbing some food and drinks, meeting up with friends, and playing some games. You may want to check out Star City Brewing in Miamisburg on Fridays. They have open game nights on Fridays (to get a feel for how bars and gaming interact). if it does work out, let me know, I'd love to drop by.  You'll obviously need to have some resources to get things up and running. Without some rich benefactor, you'll need to likely take a loan. Make sure you understand what you're getting yourself into. I saw a board game cafe (slightly different concept) go under in a matter or months.  You likely won't get all of the cash from being a bar and all the cash from being a game store. You'll get cash from nerds that drink (if you specifically brand yourself as a gaming bar). You may have a few people wander in from the street, but most people will decide to go elsewhere if they see gamers or will shun your gaming patrons (and your target demographic won't feel comfortable leading to lost patrons). Furthermore, you'll have some people that are just there for the games and will either not drink or buy the one obligatory drink to use your space.  Next, you need to overcome game store loyalties. Most gamers have specific stores they like for gaming. To pull someone away, you either have to do something special or hope the alcohol is enough of a draw. You also won't get patrons that game with younger players. I DM a group that includes my brother (who's under 21). I wouldn't move that game to your bar because I'd have to kick him out of the party."
dayton,2cvr06,curmevexas,2,Thu Aug 7 17:11:01 2014 UTC,"Do you know anything about the board game cafe? Where was it located? How big was it in sqft (if you can guess)? Did they try to make their money selling games or food, or both?  I'm still trying to figure out what the laws are on what ages can be on the premises at what hours. I assume as long as they are accompanied by guardians or other of age people they can enter?  Loyalties are interesting, the local only store I'd really feel bad drawing business away from really is Epic Loot and Game Haven, don't really know the others well. As far as making people feel alienated and splitting the business, I'm definitely leaning more towards the gamers side on this. It isn't a bar you go to in order to get drunk, you would go there in order to game first and foremost. As long as I sell Magic cards and Pathfinder that is pretty much the biggest revenue streams for most game stores afaik, and as long as they buy beer in any kind of quantity that aspect will be profitable as well.  Then again this is all conjecture and I could be totally wrong, and crash and burn like that cafe!"
dayton,2cvr06,curmevexas,3,Thu Aug 7 17:24:42 2014 UTC,"Traveler's Hearth Cafe & Games in Middleton, WI (just outside of Madison). It was a nice area, and had a large two-storey setup (6300 sqft according to a quick Google search). The first floor was your typical cafe. Reasonably-priced, but fairly average food, soft drinks, coffees, teas, etc.  The second floor housed a coffee bar, large booth seating, a small game shop, and a game library.  They had a few issues:   First, they didn't find a niche. Madison has 2 very established game store with active communities (and some smaller stores to supplement). TH had some events but really didn't specialize (Pegasus is more MTG and D&D. I'm Board is more family friendly and open game nights). There really wasn't anything they could do without stealing business from the others, and most gamers in the area already have a favorite shop/gaming community. For me, I went once when I heard about it, a second time on a date, and a third to show my roommate. I forgot about it and heard that it shut down after a few months. In Dayton, there seems to be even more competition and everyone seems to do MTG and 2 forms of D&D. Second, the location sucked. It was out of the way from most of Madison, so it took a special trip to get there, usually passing either of the big 2 depending on the route. It wasn't really convenient to swing by and grab a coffee. Looking at /u/OHKID's comment, if you can get a decent downtown location, you may actually be okay (not legal/real estate/business advice, but most other places are on the outskirts/suburbs). There isn't anything central. Third, I'm not sure where TH attempted to get revenue (food or games). The games seemed to have a slightly higher markup, but the shop was fairly small compared to the other 2 shops. I already pay a premium to support my FLGS instead of Amazon, so I'll usually support the FLGS that can offer me the best service, prices, and games. I don't know if they had PF or MTG, but if they did, it wasn't enough to save them. Food was reasonable (Panera prices). Good, but not great (I wouldn't go just to grab a meal). The library was a subscription service (not sure how it worked as it seemed complicated, but I think you could borrow and take home for a fee or deposit). I was a little turned off by paying to play their library in house (as most shops actively encourage you to play their versions to find things you like to buy and add to your collection). I doubt that made up any appreciable income for them. Fourth, it seemed like there were usually 2-4 more workers there than needed to be. I've gone to stores where I've chatted with the owner or workers, but there is always some work for them to go back to. TH seemed to have some people that just sat around because there were more workers than customers.   A few random tips:   I once overheard an owner at Pegasus talk about game store relations, and you want to be very careful. Other stores are your competition, but you want to play nice. If your out of something, you may throw a customer their way to show good customer service and good will towards the other stores (I watched Epic Loot employees tell 2 customers that they want to look at Gem City Games since EL was out of a certain MTG set this past weekend). If you piss them off, they can get underhanded and keep ""their gamers"" from ever wanting to visit you. Again, consider checking out a Friday Night at Star City. It's a little different from your vision. They aren't a bar like you're describing (no cocktails, mixed drinks, big name beers, or food). They brew their own beer and serve that almost exclusively. The games are donated by the game stores in exchange for free advertising (flyers and business cards left out and stickers on the boxes). Games can't be purchased at the brewery. There are usually 10-25 gamers on Fridays, consisting usually of a group of friends and a few meetup.com groups. If a proper bar/FLGS opens up, I'm sure the meetup groups may take a look or plan an event. I'm sure there is either some time cutoff or restrictions base on what the establishment is (bar vs. club vs. restaurant). Just keep in mind that you would want to strongly enforce any age related laws to not lose your liquor license. I, as a gamer/customer, would keep that in mind, because games can run long. If I bring my brother, I don't want to have to pack up mid-turn to make it out in time. If you do open up, there are a few yahoo groups, meetup groups, and /r/daytonGeeks that you can immediately advertise to. If you go forward with this, shoot me a message, and I'll try to make it to the grand opening with some friends."
dayton,2cvr06,curmevexas,1 point,Fri Aug 8 02:07:49 2014 UTC,"Wow thanks for the well-constructed post. I was thinking about doing a cover charge to come in ($3-$5), which would include one free drink of your choice. Focus would be on beer and wine as far as alcohol, no hard liquor (so no mixed drinks). Mainly to keep kids with no money from annoying paying customers. If accompanied by an adult, under age could come in with no cover charge. Does that sound fair?  I believe the main money maker would be having stuff like Yuengling on tap, and encouraging people to stay for long periods of time and drink multiple beers :) I would of course have the current MtG sets for sale in order to do Friday Night Magic. Pathfinder would also likely have some shelf somewhere in the bar with the latest books and some minifigs. I was not intending to have a library of free games available, BUT, I saw a great way to use Kickstarter online, for a boardgame cafe in London. They had everything worked out and were just using the Kickstarter to collect an initial batch of free play games to offer customers."
dayton,2cvr06,OHKID,1 point,Fri Aug 8 14:05:45 2014 UTC,"People's reactions will depend on how you present a cover charge. Cover can be a huge turn-off (even if your drink prices are lower than other bars because people are weird). Make sure that you either hand out drink tickets/have some sign at the door, so it's clear that the cover also includes one drink. You may also want to be considerate of underaged patrons/designated drivers in terms of cover.  My other concern is players nursing drinks. You'll definitely get people who will order a few and enjoy a night of drinking and gaming, but you'll also get a couple who just want to use your space (which cover would help)."

It's been a while since I researched licenses, but it's very easy to find via Montgomery County's website. I recall different licenses for different hours, if you'll do growler fills, etc. Call up South Park Tavern and talk to them, they only do beer and wine - no high-proof stuff. They'll likely talk to you. Beer people are awesome.  As far as failing bars...word on the street is the owner of Belmont Billiards is looking to sell. A beer bar that close to BPS could work out pretty well. There's no good beer bar in that area, and the two could play off each other. A Mavericks/Game Swap type of scenario.  Edit: Taggart's, from what I understand, is also looking to sell. That'd be great, as there's already a decent draught system installed."

I decided that I didn't want to work for him when (before the ""can't afford"" statement) he told me that he owns a ""nigger bar"" downtown, and that's where he gets his money.

dayton,2c41ii,themattkovacs,4,Wed Jul 30 04:15:24 2014 UTC,"Thanks for the responses.  I fully understand the concern that you have a guy who studied acting discussing evolution with a medical doctor who is a baptist moderated by a graduate from Liberty University.  My goal is not to win a debate, it isn't even to have a debate.  The main issue I find is the lack of information on the facts of evolution.  The vast majority of creationists are not like Ken Ham, the vast majority are misinformed on what evolution even is.  They are indoctrinated to be afraid of the word, to equate it with atheism.  There just aren't enough people out there trying to help the uneducated become educated.    I fully agree scientists are wasting their time debating people like Eric Hovind or Ken Ham.  This does not mean we can just ignore the misinformation they are spreading.  The problem is real.  The majority of those making our laws are creationists, the man in charge of the committee to fund government spending on science believes evolution is a lie from Hell. The issue isn't the evidence, it is information.    I was raised to believe a 6 day creation.  In 2004 I attended my first astronomy class at Ohio State University and it changed my life.  I was just like the people who will be attending this discussion. I was convinced that the ""evolutionists"" were just making up facts and they randomly made up 5 million years. Instead I learned there was actually a good reason they claim 14.5 billion years, it wasn't just a random number.  Information changed my life, and I've witnessed it change other people's lives (my parents included).    There will be a large crowd of creationists in attendance for this discussion.  Most likely all of them don't even truly know what evolution means and think there is just no evidence for it.  My goal is only to educate, to give them information.  Evolution isn't anything to be afraid of, it doesn't mean you have to give up your religion or faith."

dayton,2c41ii,Tapeleg91,0,Thu Jul 31 16:19:03 2014 UTC,"I appreciate the maturity.   But unfortunately, your sarcasm still doesn't answer my question. Unless, of course, you're referring to the mathematical sense of a well-posed problem, which still brings with it the relativism I mentioned above.  On a side note, if somebody has an honest question, and you respond like how you just did, you give off the strong aura of being a jackass. It might help people listen to you in the future if you grew up a little bit."
dayton,2c41ii,scienceonly,2,Thu Jul 31 16:31:52 2014 UTC,"Of course. However, at this point we keep asking the same questions over and over and come up with the same results. See: Gravity."
dayton,2c41ii,Tapeleg91,-3,Wed Jul 30 20:47:15 2014 UTC,So should we stop asking those same questions? Or is there a possibility that our scientific conclusions might change in the future?

dayton,2c41ii,insomnyuk,2,Thu Jul 31 13:15:59 2014 UTC,"There are quite a few plausible physical theories which support the origin of life on Earth, on the other side ""God made it because my dad told me so"" does not present any evidence whatsoever.  Plausible theories for origin of life on Earth:   Miller-Urey's Electric Spark Alexander Graham Cairns-Smith's Community Clay Biogenesis near deep sea vents (really hot, hydrogen rich environment) Random interaction of known elements over millions of years   The idea here is there are actual theories and hypothesis that can be tested to determine how life on Earth may have started. The religious theory can provide no evidence, no testable theories, and can't even prove any of the other things they claim their deity does."
dayton,2c41ii,Tapeleg91,0,Thu Jul 31 13:29:59 2014 UTC,"As far as we know, those 4 theories are potential explanations of where life came from. But I didn't ask for theories, I asked for evidence, specifically evidence that supports the idea of an origin of species.   All of these explanations, even if they were completely successful avenues in which we could determine the origin of life, do not completely suggest the existence of an origin of species. If one of these phenomena could create life, for example, then they might not have happened just once, and we could have origins of species.    The religious theory can provide no evidence, no testable theories   Ok, sure. But what about the corresponding scientific theory?"

All you need to do is wipe off the old paste with rubbing alcohol, then put a small bead of paste in the center of the processor. Videos on Youtube will show you the correct size. Smaller than a pea. Then just press the heat sink straight down, twist it very slightly to spread the ooze around, then tighten it down."

But I would recommend the hubsan x4 (they are both actually built by hubsan!) here are. You pros and cons of both.   Proto x Pros So tiny! It's impressive. Looks and sounds really cool.  It binds with the hubsan x4 controller!  Awesome for indoor flight Very stable flight (of you don't wreck it up!)   Cons So small that it can't fight even very light wind. It basically ONLY works indoors.  The controller that comes with it works well, but is so small and lacks trim for the rudder. So if it starts to get a habit of turning, you can't correct.  The props are VERY fragile. You will break alot of them while learning.  Non (easily) removable battery Only about 5 min flights  Great little indoor quad. Especially when paired with the hubsan transmitter. (that even let's you do flips and rolls!)   Hubsan x4 Pros Very stable flight! Small enough to be very good indoors Big enough to handle light wind outdoors  Incredible range! (this would be a pro for the proto x too. But it's too small to see from more than about 30 feet away!)  Beginner and expert mode. Docile for beginners, able to do tricks Easily swappable and cheap batteries for longer flights.  About 8-10 min flights depending on how hard you are pushing it.   Cons Props will fall off in crashes alot.  The props are stronger than the proto x. But you will still break plenty while learning.  Still too small to fly more than maybe 60 - 70 yards and still be able to tell orientation.  Fly it super high, and it's too weak to fight the wind! (you will lose it! see this thread!)  Batteries may become dislodged in a crash. (not a big deal, just slide it back in. I'm really grasping for cons at this point...)   It is a wonderful little quad.  The price being about equal, I would highly recommend this for a first or for a indoor quad. The proto does work great. But if you are choosing one, get the hubsan. Then if you want the novelty of the proto x, pick one of those up later and bind it to your hubsan remote. (best of both worlds!)   Tl;dr both great, but get the hubsan first!   protip go to your local hobby store to get hubsan props. They may need to order them, but they will be the same price or cheaper for better props and you will have them in a day or two.  If he can't find the parts, tell him to look for props for a Traxxas qr1.its the exact same quad (built by hubsan) with Traxxas stickers for twice the money. The props are better than the hubsan (or knock off ones from amazon) and you get 2 sets for $6 /rant"

dayton,2botd1,Annie_M,2,Fri Jul 25 19:48:16 2014 UTC,"There is a Morris/Ashley furniture outlet in Fairborn Behind Brinley Place/Misty Creek on the small service road that goes back to TJ Chumps. They are only open on the weekends and they usually have overstocks and scratch-and-dent, everything is brand name and they also have home accents. You can get some pretty amazing deals, but their inventory turns over and you never know what will be there from week to week. Still, We bought a $2,000 table there for $450 plus four chairs, and I once bought all the furniture, plus a mattress for a queen bedroom there for about $1,100."

dayton,2b9kvh,mission_transition,11,Mon Jul 21 03:48:37 2014 UTC,"Sadly, there are no easy solutions. Prosecute people who train their dogs to be mean and deadly. Put down dogs that attack people.  Aside from that, what do you do? There's a pit bull across the street from me, and she's the sweetest dog I've ever met. Why would I support legislation that classifies her as some sort of ""weapon""?  She's a good dog.  How can I justify trying to outlaw her?  Sure, certain breeds of dogs can cause some serious damage if they're poorly trained. But that doesn't mean that ALL dogs of that breed need to be eradicated.   So....I don't know what the answer is. If chihuahuas were the size of lions, they'd have already bitten every other species to death. But they're funny little fuckers and we laugh at them because they're tiny and can't cause much damage.   I guess the answer is that we continue to deal with animal attacks on a case-to-case basis. I don't agree with some kind of ""scorched earth"" policy regarding dog breeds."
dayton,2b9kvh,Blu3j4y,3,Mon Jul 21 04:50:22 2014 UTC,"If a person can't train and control their dog, it's irresponsible to have it. We should make the dog's owner responsible for the actions of the dog. Too many people think dogs are like children and treat them like ""part of the family."" They are dogs, and dogs are great, but they aren't people and when you treat a dog like a person they start wanting to be the leader of the pack.  A few people prosecuted for being careless and others should start taking their responsibilities seriously. Admittedly it would be hard to do, and dog lovers would fight it every step of the way. If it's not done right people would start abandoning their dogs. Maybe it could start with people who use their dogs in criminal enterprises."
dayton,2b9kvh,juanqp,2,Mon Jul 21 05:23:49 2014 UTC,"When my nephew was 1 1/2 or 2, he was left alone with 2 dogs: a boxer and a doberman. My sister only left the room long enough to switch a load of laundry or something. Next thing she knows my nephew is gushing blood from his face and screaming. One of the dogs got excited and scratched his cheek with its nail. He had a couple of stitches and an over night stay in the hospital to make sure the cut didn't get infected and he was fine.  Maybe if my sister had stayed in the room, she could have calmed the dog down or called it away from the baby, or maybe it would have happened any way.  I personally don't think any child and any dog should be left alone together. Not necessarily because I believe every dog has a predisposition to snap and kill (although, they probably do) but because it's not worth the risk.  Breed has nothing to do with it, it's how their trained, and there are plenty of stories out there of loving, patient, well-trained dogs that snap and bite someone for an unknown reason.  Just like anything else, there is no perfect solution, the best we can do is minimize risk and exposure and hope for the best."

Let me preface all of this  by saying: I have only read a few websites on this topic, I am not a dog behaviorist, or historian, nor do I have any credentials at all that would make me a great source of information, so take everything I say with a grain of salt.  I think the reason Bully breeds receive so much attention for this is for a number of reasons. 1. People love a good witch hunt. 2. The new reports what it wants to report 2.5 Dog attacks are more widely reported than they were in the past 3. ""Pitt Bull"" is such a general term and can easily be mislabeled. If someone is attacked by a random dog, that's not generally well known (lab, GSD, husky, etc) it can be easy to say (or be convinced) it was a pitt or pitt-mix. My dog is a german shepherd mix, but people think he is pitt because he has a square-ish face and short hair.  I think this is a pretty interesting read as far as dog attacks go."
dayton,2b9kvh,Annie_M,1 point,Mon Jul 21 18:21:41 2014 UTC,"Fatal dog attacks in the United States:       Fatal dog attacks in the United States are a small percentage of the relatively common occurrences of dog bites. While at least 4.5 – 4.7 million Americans (2%) are bitten by dogs every year, only about 0.0002% of these (less than 0.00001% of the U.S. population) result in death, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which published a special report on the subject in 2000.   The second part of this article consists of an annotated list of individual U.S. dog-attack fatalities. The list is not meant to be exhaustive nor conclusive. It relies mostly on news reports as references, but at points it runs concurrent with studies reviewed in the first part and may include information from the studies at those points. Care has been and should continue to be taken that this information is verifiable in the sources and that any contradictions or other indications that the information might not be valid are addressed reasonably. Nevertheless, the reader should bear in mind that data from news investigations is generally less reliable than information from published scholarly studies, and that where specific breeds listed, they are rarely based on conclusive proof of ancestry.  The tables that follow the list summarize the data from the list by age group of victim(s), and by category of dog(s) involved. In addition to the main list, it is also important to ensure the continued accuracy of these two tables.      Realistically evaluate environment and lifestyle and consult with a professional (e.g., veterinarian, animal behaviorist, or responsible breeder) to determine suitable breeds of dogs for consideration. Dogs with histories of aggression are inappropriate in households with children. Be sensitive to cues that a child is fearful or apprehensive about a dog and, if so, delay acquiring a dog. Spend time with a dog before buying or adopting it. Use caution when bringing a dog or puppy into the home of an infant or toddler. Spay/neuter virtually all dogs (this frequently reduces aggressive tendencies). Never leave infants or young children alone with any dog. Properly socialize and train any dog entering the household. Teach the dog submissive behaviors (e.g., rolling over to expose abdomen and relinquishing food without growling). Immediately seek professional advice (e.g., from veterinarians, animal behaviorists, or responsible breeders) if the dog develops aggressive or undesirable behaviors. Do not play aggressive games with your dog (e.g., wrestling). Teach children basic safety around dogs and review regularly: Never approach an unfamiliar dog. Never run from a dog and scream. Remain motionless when approached by an unfamiliar dog (e.g., ""be still like a tree""). If knocked over by a dog, roll into a ball and lie still (e.g., ""be still like a log""). Never play with a dog unless supervised by an adult. Immediately report stray dogs or dogs displaying unusual behavior to an adult. Avoid direct eye contact with a dog. Do not disturb a dog who is sleeping, eating, or caring for puppies. Do not pet a dog without allowing it to see and sniff you first. If bitten, immediately report the bite to an adult.

Once you reach the end of the road spending 90$ a day on Vicodin and/or Oxycontin you realize that heroin is cheaper and much more available. You start snorting it, then smoking it, and eventually mainlining it. I'm fairly confident most of our heroin addicts started on prescription opioids. Most of them likely became addicted without even realizing it. I agree with most of you that we need to treat it instead of criminalize it, however we also need to take serious note of the prescription drugs that attribute to the heroin problem."
dayton,2b54li,BoxcarHobo,2,Sun Jul 20 07:42:31 2014 UTC,1 answer right here folks.
dayton,2b54li,Evilmeevilyou,2,Sun Jul 20 14:20:30 2014 UTC,"This is an excellent point, it does seem that prescriptions for opioid pain killers are given out just as frequently as antidepressants.  My wife and I had a baby a little over a year ago, she must have had three prescriptions for opioid based pain killers during her pregnancy and birth.  I suffered a back injury, they threw opioids at the problem (that didn't ease the pain, only physical therapy and chiropractic visits alleviated the pain).  I remember taking a baseball bat to the back of the head in a fight when I was 18, stitches and Vicodin where the cure.  There are thousands of anecdotes like these, and the problem is growing."
dayton,2b54li,kelsmania,1 point,Sun Jul 20 16:25:23 2014 UTC,"While I think that's part of the problem -- I think the huge rise in heroin use has a lot to do on the clamp down on opioid prescription. There has been a huge push to curb prescription drug abuse, resulting in users having to turn to heroin when their sources dried up or got too expensive."
dayton,2b54li,TheyShootBeesAtYou,10,Thu Jul 24 18:42:08 2014 UTC,"Press for police, prosecutors and judges that prefer rehabilitation to incarceration.

dayton,2b54li,clutchied,3,Sat Jul 19 21:12:18 2014 UTC,Unlike meth heroin actually kills people pretty frequently.    I'm not sure what the answer is to this one.  It's not like pot and it's incredibly addictive.    whatever the answer may be the problem is pretty serious.
dayton,2b54li,insomnyuk,3,Sun Jul 20 11:18:30 2014 UTC,"The drug problem won't get better any time soon. The system is set up for a certain group to make money off the problem of drug addiction, and until that changes, nothing else will change."

dayton,2b54li,Ruskerdax,-7,Sat Jul 19 23:53:49 2014 UTC,"The problem is not going away until our government collapses, one way or another, but you can work to improve the situation by documenting and discussing the problem. Work to inform our city about how inadequate these rehabilitation clinics are. Talk about how they are largely set up as a racket, one which acts as an auxiliary to the War on Drugs. Document police abuse, and discuss how it is both practically infeasible and morally reprehensible to kidnap, beat, and kill people for having a drug addiction.  There is too much money and established infrastructure for this to change without a major revolt, but that will never come if people aren't made aware of what the myth of ""authority"" has done to us."

Very nice I lived there for 2 years and they were great. Same staff in the office for at least 5 years same maintenance staff and they were good (we moved because we got a house) Stay away from anything owned by the Conner group. You will save yourself so much trouble. We lived in 1 CG apartment and it was one issue after another exacerbated by the fact the revolving door of employees didn't give a shit unless you were due to sign a lease. I have had several friends with the very same problems both at the same complex and different CG ones. Never had issue with Chatham. Good luck!

dayton,2b10ba,lance-,1 point,Fri Jul 18 17:18:44 2014 UTC,"Seriously we lived there 2 years and then we told them we weren't going to stay. 1 week later they threaten to tow my car because the front fender was dented and it was an ""eyesore"" the same car I owned when we moved in. I ripped them up one side and down the other. I told them I found it funny that 1 week after I give my notice they decide a car I've had for the duration of my living there is suddenly a problem and that I would go through and take pics of every car with a dent and if they didn't also tow all of those cars then they would rue the day they fucked with me. Needless to say they dropped it. Also we went an entire summer (Memorial Day to Labor Day) with no AC due to dumbass maintenance guys (each time a different one) who thought the problem was ""needs more freon"" pretty sure the first 18 maintenance calls ruled out a lack of freon. Then the guy who brought us a portable unit damaged our personal property which they refused to reimburse/compensate us in any way for. Then we got our DP&L catch up bill and it was $700. So we ended up spending all the money we got as OUR FREAKIN WEDDING GIFTS on that bill (that they also refused to compensate us in any way for) .....I guess what I'm saying is stay far FAR away from the Conner group.   My blood is boiling just thinking about it."
dayton,2b10ba,Stephjephman,1 point,Fri Jul 18 17:37:49 2014 UTC,Now I want to know what complex you're talking about...
dayton,2b10ba,lance-,2,Fri Jul 18 17:44:07 2014 UTC,The villager in centerville. However I have had several friends with similar experiences at other CG Apts. Not quite as bad as the hell we went through but also very shitty experiences .
dayton,2b10ba,Stephjephman,1 point,Fri Jul 18 18:02:51 2014 UTC,"They're pretty crappy. In January of '12 they told me I had two weeks to renew my lease (which ended half way through May) or else face a $230/month increase should I choose to resign later. I told them no, obviously. Before moving out, I had the front office lady come through to inspect for anything that I could clean/repair/replace myself to avoid fines. She told me there was nothing to worry about. Fast forward to a month after I moved out: I told a friend (he was looking to move into this complex) about my experiences with the lease renewal; he decided to bring my story (and name) up when he was negotiating lease terms with the office. One week later, $200 fine in the mail for carpet cleaning.   edit: come to think of it, he didn't move in until the end of that summer, so it was several months later."
dayton,2b10ba,lance-,2,Fri Jul 18 18:11:38 2014 UTC,I'm pretty sure it's an Ohio law that they have to replace the carpet anyways every 2 years (unless it is the same tenant for longer than 2 years.) ...don't quote me on it but I am fairly certain that is a law. I documented the carpet was essentially trashed when we moved in and I took pics to prove it. When we moved out we got a letter saying we didn't owe anything (which I still have to this day) they can be glad they didn't try that shit. Chatham was such a polar opposite. I can't talk highly enough about them. But having the same office and maintenance  staff for 5+ years is a tell in and of itself that it is run the right way. Unlike villager where they switched staff more than most people change clothes.
dayton,2b10ba,Stephjephman,2,Fri Jul 18 18:23:38 2014 UTC,"I've checked out St. Claire's, the Cannery, and Dayton Towers. Of the three I'd say Dayton Towers and the Cannery were the best.

Just keep in mind that their barn (where you will likely have your reception) is not air conditioned.    Magnolia Estates on Benner Rd in Miamisburg is another nice spot, and there's another outdoor place somewhere around there, but I don't recall the name.

I can post this publicly because this secret is only truly accessible to those who can endure the challenges ahead.  First, you must go to McDonald's (any will do). Walk inside the MAIN DOOR at PRECISELY 6:25:28pm. BEFORE YOU DO ANYTHING ELSE, head straight for the bathroom, take 2.5 sheets of toilet paper from the SECOND stall, and drape them across the leftmost faucet. Get in line for food. While waiting, you must keep your left hand in your left front pants pocket, and leaning on your left against the railing like you're some cool dude.   Upon approaching the counter, order a SMALL #3, but with LARGE fries. When you pay, mention in the MOST CASUAL WAY THAT YOU CAN that the faucet in the bathroom is broken. On the back of your receipt will be written in red ink the key to the cipher.  Solve the cipher.  Go to the coordinates given. You will find a cave. I cannot disclose what trials you will encounter in the cave (for that is the test), but I will say that at the end you will find my contact information written in faded swahili on the wall. If you make it that far, contact me, and I will give you further instruction.   Godspeed, Frank."

dayton,2av6ff,Tapeleg91,6,Wed Jul 16 17:22:23 2014 UTC,"DO NOT LISTEN TO THIS TRAITOR.  Listen, Frank, there are forces at work here. Large forces that we can only begin to understand. Everything now lies upon your capable shoulders.   But know that with great power comes great responsibility. You have the power to assert the salvation of mankind or to catalyze its doom. And ultimately, it's your call.  But know that if you order that happy meal with extra happy, it will be the first step down the path of our imminent destruction.  Ball's in your court, Frank."

dayton,2av6ff,Tapeleg91,3,Wed Jul 16 21:54:37 2014 UTC,Is that the second stall from the left or the right?
dayton,2av6ff,CountGrasshopper,2,Thu Jul 17 01:59:54 2014 UTC,"The second stall as you walk in. You'll know it's the right one because the following message will be scrappily written on the wall: ""Jack F was here YOLO"""
dayton,2av6ff,Tapeleg91,1 point,Thu Jul 17 02:58:14 2014 UTC,"Wait, the McDonald's on Brandt is arranged differently. Are you sure this works at any location?"
dayton,2av6ff,Tapeleg91,2,Thu Jul 17 15:42:32 2014 UTC,"If the stalls are arranged in such a way as to be ambiguous as to which is first, then second, then... oh God...  They're on to us. If the McDonald's on Brandt has such an ambiguous hierarchy of stalls, then that means that the enemy is trying to throw us off. But we have to be sure. I will go scope it out after my civilian job ends today, and will return with clarification."
dayton,2av6ff,CountGrasshopper,0,Thu Jul 17 16:18:35 2014 UTC,I'm back. I don't see any cause for confusion. There's pretty unambiguously one stall after the other. Go to the one furthest from the door.
dayton,2av6ff,Tapeleg91,1 point,Thu Jul 17 19:58:24 2014 UTC,Maybe I'm thinking of a different McDonald's bathroom. I've been in a lot more than I'd care to admit.

dayton,2aqzon,CountGrasshopper,4,Wed Jul 16 03:25:30 2014 UTC,"I gathered this data for this using a modified version of a script made by /u/rhiever and posted /r/MUWs. I then took the number of times each word identified was used per subreddit and divided them by the subreddit populations (which I gathered by going to the subreddits in question and adding their populations to the formula.) The bar was then colorized proportionally based on which words contributed to the total amount of swearing used.  My apologies if these are difficult to see. I suffer from monochromatic colorblindness, so I had to trust in my graphing program.  If you want to see what the top 1,000 or so words were, per subreddit, I have created word clouds for each subreddit. I also made lists for every MLB, EPL, NHL, NBA, and NFL team subreddit for their last respective seasons. I will be repeating my efforts with this list to get an idea of the most (and least) foul-mouthed sports fans.
