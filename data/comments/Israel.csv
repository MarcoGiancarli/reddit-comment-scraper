Israel,3e30wf,CholentPot,-1,Tue Jul 21 18:47:31 2015 UTC,"There's only one way I can see bulking up rocket supplies making any sense and that'd be to work out a ""rockets for food"" style deal. Maybe throw in a trade for infrastructure too. Hamas gives Israel rockets on a truck, Israel gives them wind farms and solar panels and irrigation tech. Sadly I lack sufficient knowledge to know if this would even be a workable plan, regardless of the impending fireworks show."
Israel,3e30wf,Rocketdown,4,Tue Jul 21 19:30:07 2015 UTC,They don't want food. They want weapons. Bringing food into Gaza would be so much easier and cheaper than this.
Israel,3e30wf,KCisSexy,-1,Tue Jul 21 19:32:26 2015 UTC,"Probably. But depending on how much they're actually paying towards the market value of the rockets I could see selling them off to Israel for 1.5x the market value by using the public sympathy Palestine seems to have as a strong arm tactic, which would be more than worth it at a glance."
Israel,3e1q87,tayaravaknin,20,Tue Jul 21 07:45:06 2015 UTC,Duh. It's not like they were in prison for tax evasion.
Israel,3e1q87,rosinthebow,-1,Tue Jul 21 14:34:01 2015 UTC,"Not all 1027 held prisoner in Israel (indefinitely and without trial) were terrorists.  With such a broad net cast, of course both innocents and terrorists are caught and detained, and the inability to process and try that amount of people (with more coming in regularly) expediently put Israel into a compromising situation.  The Shalit deal was the option they choose to resolve the situation, which resulted in freeing innocent and terrorist alike."
Israel,3e1q87,enyoron,6,Tue Jul 21 18:01:51 2015 UTC,got a source on that?
Israel,3e1q87,bentheiii,-1,Tue Jul 21 18:03:55 2015 UTC,"Sort of.  Here's a source detailing efforts to separate verified murderers from the pool of prisoners eligible to be swapped for negotiations, in the aftermath of the Shalit deal (and similar deals which have allowed terrorists to walk free).  http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2014/05/israel-set-bar-further-prisoner-releases-2014511133651887549.html  And a report from active and ex-IDF detailing the routine process of detaining Palestinians with little to no evidence of them committing terrorist activities:  http://www.breakingthesilence.org.il/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Occupation_of_the_Territories_Eng.pdf"
Israel,3e1q87,enyoron,3,Tue Jul 21 18:18:32 2015 UTC,"You appear to have made some mistakes. Not only did you wander into openly biased sources, you made the mistake of claiming that ""not all prisoners were terrorists"" but then changed it to:   Here's a source detailing efforts to separate verified murderers from the pool of prisoners eligible to be swapped for negotiations, in the aftermath of the Shalit deal (and similar deals which have allowed terrorists to walk free).   The first list had 477 prisoners. All but 8 were already convicted for terrorist crimes. The second list had no people with ""blood on their hands"", but the list's terrorist count is not in dispute either.  There were, perhaps, 2-5% who were not terrorists and were released, according to the statistics I could find.  Your BtS report has 10 testimonies in it. They range from 2000 to 2009, mostly the Second Intifada though. So we have around 10 testimonies from anonymous sources, from an organization that is paid by the testimony, providing more incentive to provide fake testimonies mixed in with 1 or 2 real ones.  I really don't think 10 testimonies that were sought out, and that cover multiple years, can tell me that Israel's entire policy in arresting over 1,000 (almost all convicted) terrorists was wrong. Sorry."

Israel,3e1q87,WhichisWhich50,-6,Tue Jul 21 12:42:28 2015 UTC,"well but my point is that this deal didn't necessarily lead to deaths of others, because they would have simply be killed by other hamasniks. it's not like they have an army of 2000 so that by imprisoning those 1000~ shalit ones you basically reduce their capabilities dramatically. they have tens if not hundreds of thousands people willing to commit those attacks."

Israel,3e1q87,skoy,3,Tue Jul 21 14:22:54 2015 UTC,Why? How many of the attacks are planned by the central command of hammas and how many are local initiatives?

Israel,3e1q87,johnknoefler,3,Tue Jul 21 18:34:24 2015 UTC,"Manpower is one thing, being experienced, not an idiot, and able to coordinate smuggling and the rest is another. In fact, as the article notes, the argument is that the Gazan prisoners were able to orchestrate, using their connections, attacks on Israelis. That is something that isn't about manpower, it's about connections, planning, etc.. Sure you can grab a gun and go shoot someone, but you probably won't evade capture for so long like these guys did, and you won't be able to leverage as many people into it, provide them with the weapons as easily, and so on.  I'm not jumping on the death penalty bandwagon either."

Jews in Iraq lived somewhat well along the rest of the population in Iraq up until the 20s and 30s. In 1941, following a British victory in the Anglo-Iraqi war, an event known as ""The Farhud"" occurred in Baghdad. around 200 Jews were murdered and some estimates say around 2,000 injured. Jewish homes and shopped were looted and destroyed.   Following this, my grandfather attempted to flee into what was then the British mandate of Palestine. The British put him in the jail at Akko for 1 year for illegally entering the British protectorate. He was then deported back to Iraq.   Finally, in 1949, he and my grandmother along with their 4 young children were expelled to Israel. This was under the condition that they only take a suitcase of clothes, and had to surrender their home, business and personal property."

OK, in the past around WWII there were forcible transfers of millions of Germans. Around the same time as the 1948 war, there was the transfer of Indians and Pakistanis.

For the record, let it be known that this issue and this conflict would not even exist today had the Arabs accepted the 1947 partition plan to divide up the British Mandate. Arabs would actually have control of HUGE amounts of Israel proper. Take a look for yourself:  http://www.mideastweb.org/map_unpartition.gif  Instead of choosing to have all this land, and an independent country of their own in this particular region for the first time in history, the Arabs chose war. As you know it was the Arab countries who simultaneously attacked Israel in 1948. The Arabs created this refugee crisis, not Israel. Now instead of taking responsibility and granting citizenship to the refugees displaced in a conflict they started, they hang the ""right of return"" demand over every negotiation in an attempt to de-legitimize Israel."

And I am Israeli."
Israel,3e3bzy,throwmylifeawa,4,Tue Jul 21 18:30:24 2015 UTC,"He committed an extremely minor form of espionage. People like to throw around the word ""treason"", but Pollard wasn't even accused of treason, let alone found guilty of it. His crime (selling classified information to an ally without intent to harm the United States) is extremely low level as far as espionage crimes go, and it carries with it a median sentence of 2-4 years. Pollard has now been in prison for 30 years.  If you steal your neighbor's tv, do you deserve to be thrown in jail for life? No one's saying that tv theft isn't illegal or that it shouldn't be punishable, but the point is that the punishment should fit the crime. Pollard's punishment has gone so far past his crime, that it's ridiculous. He should have served his time and been out of prison over 25 years ago."

Why should he receive a more lenient sentence?   You must be trolling at this point. This is a new low for you, and you are usually pretty bad at making backed-up arguments to begin with.  1) His sentence is unusually strict, for the case itself. William Colton Millay, who got 16 years for spying for Russia, tried to sell classified details on the F-22. There's Bruce Ott, who sold to an enemy state (Soviet Union), tried to sell spy plane secrets, and he got less time than Pollard has already served. Michael Walker, sentenced to 25 years and who only served 15, stole 15 pounds of secret documents to try and give to the Soviet Union. Meanwhile, Jonathan Pollard has gotten a life sentence for giving classified information on electronic surveillance networks and the like. None of it is unlike the other things people stole, and got lesser sentences for.  2) Pollard has admitted he did things wrong, admitting both guilt and expressing sorrow for his crime. He initially didn't cooperate with the investigation, but times have changed as far as his apology and admission.  Perhaps some more comparisons will show you how ridiculous this whole thing is:   Albert Sombolay - 19 years for selling information on troop readiness information, promising to provide training and position information, and selling chemical warfare equipment. Hassan Abu Jihaad - 10 years for disclosing locations of Navy ships and their weaknesses to Al Qaeda sympathizers. Ronald Humphrey - 15 years for passing diplomatic cables to North Vietnam. Earl Pitts - 27 years, and failed to fully apologize by the time of the trial for spying for the Russians while they were still an enemy state (and after). He gave them all information the US had on their officials, and also all information on the progress the US had made in finding other Soviet intelligence sources. David Boone - 24 years for selling the Soviet Union top secret documents detailing the United States's sites targeted for a nuclear second-strike, as well as other top secret documents. Less time than Pollard has already served. Harold Nicholson - 23 years for blowing the top-secret ""deepest cover"" operatives of the US working in the Soviet Union, compromising all of their work and operations.   I see no reason an old man nearing death shouldn't be released for selling information to an ally (the count he was indicted on) over thirty years ago, when people who sold information to actual, really lethal enemies have been released much sooner, despite compromising what could've led to the US's annihilation."

He was never elegible for early release because he never accepted the necessary parole requirements which included the admission of guilt.   False. His release has been slated for, at maximum, November of 2015. The President has been holding up his clemency requests for years already, knowing perfectly well he could've granted it and indeed offering it as part of a deal to extend negotiations in 2014's Israeli-Palestinian talks. His release was ""held up"" by politics. If he could be used as a bargaining chip and feasibly released, there is no reason to keep an old and ailing man in prison, who has expressed regret for his actions and poses no threat to society.  All that's holding an early release up, one that would match releases for other offenses like this one and others, is political bargaining. That's all. Now the Justice Department will not oppose the release, slated for November of this year, but it could've seen him released earlier...but that was held up by politics instead of common sense."
Israel,3e3bzy,tayaravaknin,0,Tue Jul 21 21:59:06 2015 UTC,"I think the best example is Steven John Lalas. He spied on the USA for 26 years, giving classified US information (including about Turkey) to Greece, and got out after 14 years. ""In debriefings the prosecutors said Lalas did not reveal the full extent of his spying...he stated that if he had the chance he would do it all over again."" There was no deal in his release, like Israel has offered for Pollard. I believe Pollard has been kept locked up for much longer mostly because he is so famous and his release will generate extremely negative press, damaging both Israel and the United State's reputation.  He hurt both the USA and Israel for personal monetary gain and life in prison is absolutely fair punishment regardless of the lax punishments other people received. If his release is publicly celebrated in Israel as is expected, it will cause great harm to the reputation of Israel in the US. It will be like the dancing Jews on 9/11 all over again. And going by the ignorant comments in this thread, it will only strengthen the Arab/anti-Israel view that the US is Israel's puppet which makes it harder for the US to mediate peace."
Israel,3e3bzy,pacifismisevil,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:18:02 2015 UTC,His sentence was categorically excessive. Most Soviet spys during the height of the Cold War faced milder penalties.

Churchill would be ashamed.   The problem with the Munich agreement was that it gave Hitler territory in exchange for the promise of not taking more territory. The Iran deal does no such thing. It has sanctions relief (not giving them anything, just reducing the amount of their money that we are taking from them) in exchange for verifiable restrictions on their nuclear program. If they do not comply with the deal then we can easily ramp the sanctions back on. It's not comparable to the Munich agreement at all. Nothing in the Iran deal requires trust."
Israel,3e1qcs,uncannylizard,7,Tue Jul 21 15:34:44 2015 UTC,"gave Hitler territory in exchange for the promise of not taking more territory   and this deal gives Iran a limited nuclear program for a decade in the promise of not expanding that program after the deal is over.    If they do not comply with the deal then we can easily ramp the sanctions back on.   No you can't. It doesn't work like that. Sanctions require years of build up to take full effect and the level of sanctions that was achieved was extraordinary, do you think Russia and China would ever agree to sanctions on Iran again?   Sanctions don't just snap back into place. If Iran has a breakout capacity of 1 year for a nuke after its stockpiles are produced, I highly doubt sanctions would be able to take effect in time to punish Iran between violating the deal and gaining a nuke.    Nothing in the Iran deal requires trust.   Bad talking point by Obama. It does require trust. The verification is only with the permission of Iran, Russia and China, so Obama has placed trust in those powers to permit inspections. And the agreement completely expires in 15 years and from then on there is no verification, just 'trust'.    (not giving them anything, just reducing the amount of their money that we are taking from them)   and no again, Iranian assets have been frozen, releasing those assets and revenues is giving Iran something it didn't otherwise have.   The fact is, the deal was in the interests of a rogue evil state bent upon domination of the Middle East, an already volatile region, the fact the USA and other allies acted in that state's interests is troubling.   Just like Obama's policies in the Middle East have already caused havoc, this agreement is going to bring unprecedented conflict to all parties."
Israel,3e1qcs,f8trix,-2,Tue Jul 21 15:40:04 2015 UTC,"and this deal gives Iran a limited nuclear program for a decade in the promise of not expanding that program after the deal is over.   No, Iran will still be subject to the NPT, as well as the IAEA's Additional Protocol, which means that it will still be more heavily scrutinized than any other nation forever. If we decide that the regime hasn't chang AND they are not complying with that then we can bring back the sanctions and go through this game again to extend the extra proposals.   Pointing out that certain parts of the deal eventually expire is not a reason to oppose the nuclear deal. Virtually all international agreements other than peace treaties have finite durations.    No you can't. It doesn't work like that. Sanctions require years of build up to take full effect and the level of sanctions that was achieved was extraordinary, do you think Russia and China would ever agree to sanctions on Iran again? Sanctions don't just snap back into place. If Iran has a breakout capacity of 1 year for a nuke after its stockpiles are produced, I highly doubt sanctions would be able to take effect in time to punish Iran between violating the deal and gaining a nuke.   A) They have sanctions and they have the threat of military force if Iran rushes for a bomb.   B) If you think that these deterrents won't work, then what exactly are you proposing? You are saying that no deal should be made because the sanctions aren't an effective deterrent. Do you realize that this isn't an option? The only reason why the international community agreed to sanctions was to reach a nuclear deal. If we rule out sanctions relief then the world will lift their sanctions. Everyone knows this. You can't just tell the world ""actually you know those nuclear related sanctions you put on Iran? We don't believe that sanctions will work to deter Iran from going for a bomb, therefore you now have to keep them on Iran indefinitely no matter what deal they agree to"".    Bad talking point by Obama. It does require trust. The verification is only with the permission of Iran, Russia and China, so Obama has placed trust in those powers to permit inspections.    Completely false. Verification is automatic on all declared facilities that the USA is most concerned with. For undeclared or new facilities there is a vote held by the P5+1+Iran. Majority vote wins. So Iran AND China AND Russia can all vote against inspections and the inspections still happen. You have to know this by now. Its a basic feature of the deal. Thats why experts are so surprised by how good the deal is and supportive of it.    and no again, Iranian assets have been frozen, releasing those assets and revenues is giving Iran something it didn't otherwise have.   Those iranian assets were frozen to motivate them to sign a deal. They get their assets back once they implement all the major elements of the deal and get rid of the bulk of their enriched uranium to the point that they only have a small percentage of that required for 1 bomb. After than they get their assets that they would have had if we had not sanctioned them. Then on an ongoing basis we can bring back sanctions and freeze their assets if they are found to be non-compliant in the future.    The fact is, the deal was in the interests of a rogue evil state bent upon domination of the Middle East, an already volatile region, the fact the USA and other allies acted in that state's interests is troubling. Just like Obama's policies in the Middle East have already caused havoc, this agreement is going to bring unprecedented conflict to all parties.   Absolutely shit analysis. Iran is in a defensive position in the middle east. Syria and Iraq both allied with Iran, Iran didnt do anything to get them to be allies. Those allies who it had a few years ago are now completely torn apart by radical Sunni groups and other groups funded by the Gulf. Hezbollah who used to be Iran's powerful proxy is now stretched thin fighting for Assad's survival. Their ally in Afghanistan is being destabilized by the Taliban. Hamas has basically been cut off due to their differences over Syria. The only place where you could make this argument in Yemen, and even then, Iran has sent virtually no support to the Houthis, and it is Saudi Arabia who is getting militarily involved."

China and Russia are not interested, and really neither is the EU.  There never was and never will be any threat of military intervention in Iran, at least from the US, as Obama has indicated many times.   Majority vote wins. So Iran AND China AND Russia can all vote against inspections and the inspections still happen.   So all Iran has to do is court another friend to tip the balance.

Are you joking right now? The reason why they signed this deal was to get sanctions relief. They don't get any sanctions relief until they destroy or export most of their enriched uranium, so that the amount that they have left isn't enough for a fraction of what is required for 1 bomb. They need to implement all of the restrictions on their nuclear sites and be subject to unprecedented inspections before they get sanctions relief. They agreed to all of this because of the economic pressure from the sanctions. Everything you wrote here is wrong.    Treaties without teeth mean nothing. And I believe you a little naïve if you think there is any chance of reapplying the sanctions. China and Russia are not interested, and really neither is the EU.   What is this based on?

Israel is a country that can afford to supply electricity and internet (both of which save countless lives) to Gaza, and as such, have a duty to do so.     Does that make any sense?

They don't get permission to build because they are building tents and ramshackle houses that aren't up to code. Of any kind.  If they want to build, they have to both legally own the land (some of which they do not) and they have to build in accordance with the law. They are doing neither. The ""villages"" are built on top of ancient and archaeologically valuable Jewish sites, without permits, on land they cannot even prove is legally theirs.  It's not discrimination, it's common sense and respect for the rule of law. Israel offered to relocate them to residential land, they refuse. Israel has no obligation to relocate people to land, taking them off land they don't even have proof of ownership for, and which they have illegally built on, but Israel offered to do it anyways. The only discrimination is that if a Jewish owner built a house in the West Bank, they'd be called an illegal settler who needs to be evicted for ""peace""."

Even the Onion can see that Obama views Israel as a cranky state that will calm down when he sends them weapons. He doesn't see Israel as an Ally, but as a thorn in America's side as he tries to repair Americas tarnished image, especially in the Arab world. Repairing Americas image in the middle east was always his admitted goal and dramatically shaped his middle east policy during his presidency; from his speech in Cairo to the recent Iran deal. And what country was the biggest challenge to this? Not the one that shouts ""Death to America"", but the one that mostly loves America, Israel. He wished Israel would stop complaining and just shut up and go with whatever America does, and because he thinks all they care about are money and weapons, this is what he offers to them to quiet them."

Israel,3dxfw1,Moroccan_princess,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:27:49 2015 UTC,"I think that you assume that Netanyahu and the ring wing position in Israel are what is definitely best for Israel. Because of that, left leaning positions are regarded as counter intuitive to security, and thus are seen as threats and therefore as traitors. It is always a terrible sign for a nation when being considered left wing is an insult; that tends to be a sign of fascist and extremist dispositions of society. What is best for Israel is peace since that is the only way to lasting security. Americans see that the right wingers in Israel agitate any sort of concept of peace, and thus, are really the threats to Israel. However, most Israeli's have bought into the right wing narrative because of how powerful that narrative is. That's true for all nations, that is, how narratives shape public perceptions. The dominant narrative in Israel is that Israel is in an existential state of danger. People, because of that perception, are afraid. When you're afraid for your lives, it becomes very easy to justify war and attacking other nations. But what if that narrative is not true? Then, as what most of the world is worried about, especially the more rational Israelis, that Israel will lead a self fulfilling prophecy, a manifest destiny; due to their irrational fear of others, they will per-emptively attack others. One of those attacks is going to be extremely destructive, and this will lead to a very destructive counterattack. Then Israel would really be in danger, and that's what the left in Israel is worried about.   Israel is allowed to exist because of the US. Israel is intimately tied into elite socio-political culture, especially in the US, and is thus the primary object of patronage by political hopefuls. The US sends billions of dollars and weaponry to Israel. Now, for Israelis to distrust the US is extremely irrational and childish."
Israel,3dxfw1,unknown_poo,8,Tue Jul 21 02:42:13 2015 UTC,"I see what you mean and share your concerns, but you honestly have it all wrong. You're completely wrong. I'm left-moderate, and definitely lean more left than right. I don't like Bibi at all, and If I was Israeli I would not have voted for him(Probably Kulanu for me, or even Yesh Atid). But your views on peace only make sense if you don't know the history of what happened with Gaza and the left wing in Israel.   Israel is allowed to exist because of the US.   This is so so so false, I hard to even begin to explain how wrong this is, and it's indicative of someone who thinks of Israel as no more than a leech in America's side. Israel has won every single war they've fought without help from the US. Every single one. They had to build tanks in 48 out of destroyed WW2 Shermans because the US wasn't willing to help. They were begging Johnson to help them in 67, when he was too busy trying to secure a peace deal with Egypt as they moved their troops across the Sinai. They didn't help in the 70's either, and if Iran was to attack Israel tomorrow, the United states might send money and military equipment, but they wouldn't send a single soldier, just like they never have in any crucial war of existence Israel has ever fought.  Israel DOESN'T NEED AID FROM THE US. THEY'RE BETTER OFF WITHOUT IT. I don't know how often I can repeat it, and it's actually the left wing that thinks Israel need to acquiesce to the demand of the US in order to keep the money flowing, and it is the left who have decided that land for peace is a viable option, which the withdrawal from Gaza clearly proved it wasn't. If you've ever actually talked to a right-wing Israeli, they very often lament the fact that Israel has become a foreign aid junkie and they get their fix from the US. It's a horrible condition, and its the LEFT who perpetuates the idea that Israel should just shut up and do what they're told by the US so they don't lose their precious foreign aid. Bibi is NOT the right wing, he's establishment center-right, and he works with whoever will keep him in power, be it right wing or left wing. he doesn't discriminate. Again, Bibi is NOT what the right is in Israel, he might have been 15 years ago, but not today. The real right loves their relationship with America, but doesn't think of America as a bank they need to please like the left does.  Everyone thinks that it's Israels obligation to solve this crisis in the West Bank, but when you look at where Israel took their biggest PR hits for the past decade, it wasn't in the West Bank, it was always in Gaza. Before the pullout, the left wing was praising this as a huge step towards peace, and they said that it would improve our standing in the world to be able to tell people we gave up land for peace. Except when Israel gave up the land, there was no peace, and now Israel has been called ethnic cleansers in Gaza, the city that the Left in Israel said would become the Singapore of the middle east; instead it turned into the Afghanistan of the Levant. The right wing narrative is actually much harder to buy than the left wing. Who can argue with a guy who says that we should have peace? Everyone wants peace, but the policies of the left in Israel LEAD TO WAR. Again, the policies of the left, not the right, lead to war. We don't even have to speculate, we have proof now. These policies which were supposed to bring peace led to 2 large wars in Gaza already, the one place they thought they could give up and receive applause from the Arab world and the United Nations.   What happened in Gaza is the fault of the left who pushed for it, and 8,000 Jews were stripped from their homes in exchange for rockets and calls of condemnation from the rest of the world. The left tried to convince Israel that they would be hated by the entire world if they don't give up the land, while the right said that Israel should stay as it wouldn't work. Who turned out to be right, and who turned out to actually be doing the fear-mongering? The left is doing it, they're the ones trying to say Israel will be finished politically unless they give up more land for peace in the West Bank. Again, it's the left that uses fear to push voters to the polls, fear of international isolation and not being accepted by the Europeans as a western country any more. And while Bibi does it too, he does NOT represent the real right in Israel, which shows clearly as he only got 30% of the popular vote.  So if you actually want to stop war, and stop the constant fighting, and stop US aid to Israel(which they spend 100% of on America btw), you should join the moderates or the real right. The right wing establishment(Bibi) and the left wingers are the ones who wish to keep the money flowing.  The left's policy of land for peace did not work in the past and will not work in the future. Also, who do you think is stopping Hamas from taking over in the West Bank like they did in Gaza? hint: It's not the PA police, it's the Israeli military, just like the withdrawal from Gaza, there will be a Palestinian war between Fatah and Hamas for control if Israel was to leave.  I honestly wish I could support the left in Israel, because most of my positions are left wing, but they're so completely out of touch with reality that they're willing to give up the land of Israel in the hope that suddenly Palestinian society will change. Land for peace does NOT work, and those who say it does only show their ignorance of the situation. Nobody can say Gaza turned out well, but still the insane idea being pushed by the left is that Israel needs to give up the West Bank, because once they do, suddenly there will be peace and criticism of Israel will halt. What a fairy tale. Bibi is definitely not best for Israel, but if you actually think that a liberal leader would be better for peace, you're fooling yourself. I want peace too, and peace will NOT come with an Israeli withdrawal from the west bank, only more war will, just like what is happening in Gaza."

Israel,3e02jq,machinedog,4,Tue Jul 21 03:58:07 2015 UTC,"(This got long. Sorry.)  I really, really have to work at it to get prices that low. Groceries are really expensive here.   We eat all kinds of stuff. Due to the price of meat, we tend to only eat it on shabbat or if we find a fantastic sale. My husband likes weird meats that tend to be less expensive (chicken hearts and livers) so I usually buy one whole chicken per week plus a package of hearts and livers. I butcher up the chicken myself and use the carcass for stock after we eat the meat. If we have extra in the budget I'll buy beef occasionally but not often.   I take weekly trips to the shuk (go near closing!) and get two huge bags of fruit and veg for less than 40 shekels. This probably weighs about 5-8kg. I love fresh fruit and vegetables so the meals I make for myself are usually raw. It helps to know how to haggle but it isn't necessary.  I have Celiac disease, so I bake my own bread and cookies. I let husband continue to eat gluten so he usually has cous cous and pasta based sides with his dinners. We have stews, curries, casseroles, stir fries, lots of rice dishes and stuff with lentils. Eating mostly vegetarian is the cheapest way to go.  Middle Eastern cooking is really cheap because the recipes usually rely on starches, spices and vegetables (with dried fruit occasionally) so we make a lot of this type of cuisine. The ingredients are local so they are cheap.   We eat a lot of Polish and Russian foods as well.  I also supplement our food supplies by growing a garden. I have about 12 tomato plants so I make all kinds of sauces and such. I grew enough beans to last us the summer and I've dried a bunch of peppers to last through winter. Celery is picked by the stalk so that I never have to buy it etc.  This country can bleed you dry on groceries so you really have to learn to pay attention to sales and know how to calculate price per ml or gram. Also for the love of God buy in bulk."

For a few hundred shekels in capex, you can make 30 odd bottles of beer for about 130 shekels in ingredients (not including the water). It doesn't taste quite as nice as boutique stuff, but it's way better than Goldstar and nearly half the price to boot."

Fortunately, I'm friends with the owner of a winery, so I have moved to a wine at home, beer when out, whiskey on occasions drinking pattern. It's working well for me.  The self-watering system (a misnomer) I made was a gravity drip system fed by a 2L coke bottle resovoir. I used it mostly for tomatoes and cucumbers which like a constant supply of not very much water. Depending on your set up, you can change the flow to a little bit higher, add an extra few resovoirs, and let make your drainage continue to another layer of planters underneath. This is closer to a hydroponic set up than a standard planter system, but it works fine for both.  I never bothered recording my contraptions because I'm fairly certain there are more effective and more efficient ways to do it. I didn't really research anything, but there is a wealth of knowledge on the internet.  Also, you can grow a lot of vegetables without the need for a balcony. If you have a windowsill you can put a few jars or half-bottles with leeks, onions, garlic, lettuce, potatoes, carrots etc. It won't save you a tonne of money, but every shekel counts and it's nice to have a green living kitchen. Just be warned that it will attract bugs, so if you do it grow some mint, rosemary, lavender, lemongrass, or other insect repellent plants amongst the food plants."

Israel,3dz3o0,gprime,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:20:10 2015 UTC,I came upon this info recently: http://jpupdates.com/2015/04/01/in-radio-ad-jewish-group-accuses-jeb-bush-of-anti-semitism/ https://jtf.org/jeb-bush-condemned-over-speech-at-anti-israel-conference-selects-anti-semite-as-foreign-policy-advisor/
Israel,3dz3o0,compsci17,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:57:47 2015 UTC,"So the issue isn't with Bush per se, but his chosen advisor. No doubt Baker is an anti-Israel asshole, and an extremely suspect advisor pick. But absent more confirmatory evidence, my inclination is to give Bush the benefit of the doubt and assume that Israel policy was neither the primary nor sole reason for enlisting Baker. Indeed, as one of the articles you linked to demonstrates, publically Bush has broken with Baker on Israel. So my takeaway, at least thus far, is that a critical eye should be kept on Bush, and that there's a decent chance he's the least pro-Israel Republican candidate. But I'm not seeing anything clear cut or damning enough to assume he'll be worse than Sanders."
Israel,3dz3o0,gprime,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:19:08 2015 UTC,"(Btw I wasn't the one who downvoted you). I do think that it may be possible Jeb Bush isn't anti-Israel, but other candidates like Rubio and Carson, who are very vocal in their support of Israel, are definitely safer choices."
Israel,3dz3o0,compsci17,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:26:28 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. Forgetting all other issues, it seems reasonably certain that Bush is the worst Republican on Israel. With the way Israel is increasingly becoming a partisan issue in the US though (just look at opinion polling from the past few years), I think it is generally safe to assume that even bad Republicans will be better than a clear majority of Democrats.   Frankly, in the broader context, Bush is a pretty terrible Republican generally. I would still prefer him to Huckabee or somebody like that (based on non-Israel concerns), but there are several obviously better options among the fifteen declared Republican candidates. My top choice, based on a plethora of foreign and domestic policy considerations, is Rand Paul. The only concern I had about him - where he'd ultimately stand on an Iran deal - has since been alleviated when he condemned the deal. And while many on reddit naysay his chances, I think the multitude of factors favor him for the nomination, and in turn, the White House."
Israel,3dz3o0,gprime,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:35:51 2015 UTC,"Yes, I do agree that most, if not all, Dems would be not so supportive of Israel as the Republicans, as evidenced throughout time. But I'm interested - what is your opinion of Ben Carson & Marco Rubio? I believe that they have the ability to sway some of the usually-left-leaning minorities into voting for Republicans, which I think could be one of the major factors in swaying the next election toward a Republican winner."
Israel,3dz3o0,compsci17,3,Tue Jul 21 02:17:08 2015 UTC,"But I'm interested - what is your opinion of Ben Carson & Marco Rubio? I believe that they have the ability to sway some of the usually-left-leaning minorities into voting for Republicans, which I think could be one of the major factors in swaying the next election toward a Republican winner.   It could have a very modest impact, but not enough to deliver a win in my opinion. That is, assuming either candidate wins the nomination, if they further prevail in the general, it won't be because of their success in converting minority voters, but in independents veering to the right, overall turnout being low, and conservative turnout being high.  Consider Rubio - he's Cuban. This is actually somewhat of a liability, in that the largest latino voting block in the US, Mexicans, generally feel some animus towards Cubans because of their privileged immigration status and greater economic success. Some believe that Mexicans therefore won't support a Cuban candidate, at least before there's been a Mexican one. I suppose the recent change in relations with Cuban might shift that a little, but not significantly. Meanwhile, the group of latinos likely to support him - older Cuban exiles in Florida - are already loyal Republicans.   Carson - Among black voters, his favorability rating isn't any higher (or more specifically, usually is, but only by a point or two, so within the margin of error) than Cruz. He is unknown to most of the black community, but even if that changes (as it did for Obama), it is doubtful that impressions would be favorable, since his message of fiscal conservatism is fundamentally at odds with the black community as a whole. To the extent Carson's race is a factor, it would only be in encouraging black voters to not turn out, feeling that they couldn't in good conscience either vote for a Republican or against a black candidate.   Personally, I don't object to either. But I think tokenism is a bad reason to pick a candidate, and token status aside, neither are particularly strong candidates."
Israel,3dz3o0,gprime,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:37:30 2015 UTC,"That's an interesting take on it. I didn't realize that most Mexicans wouldn't support someone who is the son of Cuban immigrants, so that's yet another contributing factor to the already-complicated political situation."
Israel,3dz3o0,compsci17,-1,Tue Jul 21 04:35:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah, no way, I don't trust Sander's one bit.  He is as anti-Israeli a candidate you could get, don't be fooled."

It's old news from a completely different era. Israel was all of 19 years old as a country, and today it is over 60.  2) Multiple government inquiries by the US found that it was an accident. Multiple analyses have found the same. Some persist in trying to prove it wasn't, including survivors who have an understandable grudge, but also have conflicting stories quite often. Which is what happens with eyewitnesses in high stress situations, and which is why eyewitnesses can often reconstruct false memories and misunderstand what they see in courts of law."
Israel,3dx1h5,tayaravaknin,6,Mon Jul 20 06:55:49 2015 UTC,"Ahh. Yes, seems America doesn't pay much attention to it either. I (and I assume many other American my age, twenty-something) had not heard of it before.   Too bad Al Jazeera has been the only major outlet to produce a recent documentary on it. I sense that it has gotten so popular on reddit recently because the documentary presents what is, to my generation, a ""new"" story. I say ""too bad,"" because frankly, some of the conclusions made by the doc seem politically motivated   ""Since the attack on the Liberty, the USA and Israel have grown ever closer.... As the Americans had not had the courage to punish [Israel] for the blatent murder of American citizens, [the americans] would let them get away with anything""   Lol.

Israel,3dx1h5,tayaravaknin,4,Mon Jul 20 07:24:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's pretty bad. As is much of what Al Jazeera puts out on Israel, or any country its Qatari owners have reason to dislike.

Israel,3dx1h5,tayaravaknin,2,Mon Jul 20 06:36:29 2015 UTC,"Ahh, the documentary makes the claim that, among other things, Israeli jets had identified the ship as American during the attack (and that American govt. had subsequently tried to cover it up).  Tbh, the documentary paints Israel in a very poor light (as an American, I would say it does at very good job at provoking anger against Israel for the attack).  Anyone know of any documentaries that show the Israeli perspective regarding these claims that refute them? Perhaps someone might post them to r/documentaries?  I sense that Al Jazeera is very much trying to promote a certain viewpoint without presenting the other(s) in an equally neutral light, which is a shame, considering how popular the apparently one-sided documentary is getting at the moment on reddit.."
Israel,3dx1h5,johnknoefler,12,Mon Jul 20 06:45:38 2015 UTC,"No, there probably aren't documentaries the other way. That's because the incident had so many government investigations find it an accident, with plenty of intelligence and information indicating as much. So it's not as ""exciting"" or ""edgy"" if the documentary just says what everyone except for conspiracy theorists knows, and would be harder to get funding for."
Israel,3dx1h5,johnknoefler,4,Mon Jul 20 06:53:05 2015 UTC,Ahhh. Well that would seem fairly rational.  So is the opinion in Israel that Al Jazeera is very anti-Jewish/Israeli?
Israel,3dx1h5,Zenarchist,10,Mon Jul 20 07:00:28 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. It's well known to be. It's Qatari-funded, it's to be expected. I don't know if you'd heard, but a former employee is now suing them for being anti-American, anti-Semitic, and sexist. Three women executives left Al Jazeera America, it switched CEOs if I remember rightly, and another former executive came forward to sue Al Jazeera America recently as well: alleging that non-Arab and non-male workers were treated as second-class in the company, and that non-Arabs were passed over for jobs that Arab employees were given instead.  And this is the tip of the iceberg.  There's the time Al Jazeera caused a firestorm on the web claiming that Israel opened dams to flood Gaza intentionally...flooding dams that don't exist. This goes back to 2001, when Fouad Ajami (professor/journalist) wrote in the NY Times that: ""The channel's policy was firm: Palestinians who fell to Israeli gunfire were martyrs; Israelis killed by Palestinians were Israelis killed by Palestinians."" And it has been constant since, as they congratulate those who kill Israeli civilians and invite Israelis on for ""short interrogations"" (as one Israeli described it) as a fig leaf to say they allow both sides of an issue. They're very anti-Israel, there's no doubt there."
Israel,3dx1h5,tayaravaknin,4,Mon Jul 20 07:17:29 2015 UTC,"This has always been interesting to me.

What you need to ask them is, why would Israel attack the United States on purpose? There has to be a reason why they did this if it wasn't on accident right? Why would they think diverting valuable airtime from fighting Egypt to attack a single US ship would help them? What do they possible have to gain by attacking their Ally while they were at war with 5 other countries?  The answer you will always receive, if they don't use the defense (I'm just asking questions bro), simply says the Israel is evil and did this on purpose because they are evil. They attacked it on purpose because they secretly hate America or the secretly hate non-Jews.   The only people who still bring up this event are those who have a certain picture they want to paint of Israel, and this helps them paint that picture. The real answer, of course, is that it was a horrible, horrible mistake. Many instances of friendly fire happened in many wars, and this one is no different."

Btw, AL-Jazeera is notoriously anti-Israel, and people who say they're non-biased are the type of people who would say that fox news isn't biased. They know it is biased, but they keep saying it isn't in hopes that people who don't know any better will believe them.  Here's Al-Jazeera throwing a party for the recently released Samir Kuntar, who murdered a 31 year old Israeli man and his 4 year old daughter after kidnapping them, and was released by Israel as a part of a deal. They usually keep most of their hate to their opinion section or their cartoon section (Israel is commonly portrayed as a snake strangling Al-Aqsa) to cover their backs, but sometimes it leaks out into the open like this."

Israel,3dx1h5,merchant_of_death,0,Mon Jul 20 17:49:36 2015 UTC,"I love that the truth made you so mad that you had to check my account history. Typical, honestly. -The ship wasn't meant for helping or fighting, it was meant to gather intelligence. -Nobody is saying that Israel hates America. Just saying that Israel fucked up. No reason to try to find an alternate reasoning. -I see Israelis point out the fault in so many other countries. e.g. Hezbollah killing marines, Turkey aiding ISIS by buying their oil, etc, etc. The moment this dark secret is pointed out, why do people freak out that are pro-Zionism?"
Israel,3dx1h5,Constantineus,-1,Mon Jul 20 07:57:01 2015 UTC,"I have heard rumors that the reason the attack might have been on purpose is because America was collecting intelligence with the Liberty ship which was a spy ship, and selling that information to their oil buddies. This is a rumor from a pro Israeli author I have read a long time ago, it could have been a book called ""The Secret War Against the Jews"""
Israel,3dx1h5,merchant_of_death,0,Mon Jul 20 11:01:41 2015 UTC,"You bring up a very good point. I have read of an alternate possible motive. I believe the pilots could have been duped as innocent patsies. I believe they could have been ordered to attack the ship by their commanders in collustion with high ranking  American operatives for political reasons with the objective of sinking the ship, killing all survivors of the sinking and then blaming the attack on Egypt so USA would have a pretext to enter the war on the Israeli side. USA and Israel would be victorious and USA would then have a reason to have bases in the Middle East and have more control over Middle East oil.   From what I have read there is enough basis for this to at least draw some doubt about the culpability of USA in this attack.   What is sure is that a Russian ship came close enough to observe the attack and Israeli pilots discontinued the attack because there could be no false flag accusations with a witness on the scene and attacking a Russian ship was simply out of the question. Other statements on the issue credit a seaman who suffered several bullet wounds erecting an antennae during the battle to send out an SOS to the Saratoga.   Personally, I have some doubts about the false flag attack scenario but there seems enough there to at very least make me not so sure.   I also think that the way Israel handled things directly after the attack goes a long way in exonerating the nation itself from crimes that may have been committed by a few rogue officers who might have planned the attack in an effort to draw USA into the conflict on their side.   Israel began negotiations for compensating the victims of the attack within 48 hours after the attack.   To those who continually try to beat this long dead horse or in reality try to establish a reason to hate Israel as a nation and by extension Jewish people  are pathetic haters who should themselves be excoriated for extreme bigotry and racism.   It's long done and over with. Get over it people. Israel is sorry. Jewish people are sorry. Seriously, stop hating people who had nothing to do with this unfortunate tragedy. Just being Jewish and Israeli doesn't make people guilty of this."
Israel,3dx1h5,xHaGGeNx,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:46:53 2015 UTC,"I completely agree with getting a more well rounded viewpoint and not basing your opinion on just one source of info. However, I disagree on the ""I would have known already"" argument. Here is why, we have grown accustomed to always receiving vital information from a more authoritative source.  Obviously it is logical to seek knowledge from someone who appears to already have it, that is a natural learning process.  However, in this age of massive and rapid information we can not universally apply that reasoning.  We tend to assume that 'well if this thing had any credence to it I would already know about it', but we inherently undermine our OWN ability to think and reason when we do so.  We always expect that someone else would have figured it out, never thinking that everyone else could be waiting on US to figure it out.  Naturally some people will take the lead in investigating things or doing research or gathering data etc. However that does not mean that we should just sit back and wait until someone else says, ""it's true"", or ""it's false"".  We have lost a large community of critical thinkers because of that mentality.  Take the business relationship between Bush, Arbusto, James Bath and the Bin Laden family for example.  Now REGARDLESS of it a person believes that relationship was inappropriate or dangerous or questionable or whatever, the fact is that your average American is OBLIVIOUS to that connection.  From a media or investigative standpoint that connection is HUGE.  But yet, most people have no idea, perhaps because they think that if it was really true they would have heard about it already.  But it is a well documented fact, and yet people still don't know.  Again, draw your own conclusion as to what that connection could indicate or imply.  Irrespective of that, it is undeniably significant that a political family would have those types of business ties considering the context and history of that family in America, and the political environment of the time.  So I also don't think the Al-Jazeera story is the only angle to consider.  But I certainly prefer to take a more proactive approach to examining the evidence."

And there is no proposed theory Ive heard of where the israelis knew it was an american ship and meant to attack it, but did not mean to sink it. So the available evidence suggests that accidental friendly fire is the only plausible explanation."
Israel,3dx1h5,Nookiwookie,0,Mon Jul 20 22:25:44 2015 UTC,"It was during the war against Egypt. It was an unmarked spy ship operating for the NSA. Rumors are that the Americans were selling secrets to the Arabs but there is no documented evidence of this. You will find angry crew members left out to dry by their own government because the Navy kids on the ship were not really aware of what they were doing, only a handful were aware it was to spy on communications, and the ""documentaries"" always ignore the fact that the ship was sitting off the coast in an actual war and not well identified as an American ship because duh it's designed to spy.  Sailors are usually interviewed making up stories about how they knew they were identified as American but the fighters shot them anyway. They claimed to have called back to the carrier group in the Med but there was a lot of mix up apparently about telling the pilots it was not a hostile ship.  They never have any explanation for WHY Israel would do such a thing, because there is no reason for it.  It was nothing more than friendly fire, but bigots are gonna bigot when they froth at the thought of pinning something to make evil Israel more evil.

They'd been buzzing the Liberty since 5am and attacked at 2pm. The sailors noted a total of 12 separate flyovers in that interim. The Holiday Colors, an American flag 8' by 12' had been flying in a 5-10 knot wind since 6am. There were dozens of soldiers (with visibly white skin) sunbathing on the deck from at least 11am until the attack.  The Israelis wanted first to jam all radio signals, destroy on deck radio equipment and napalm the deck to prevent repairs. Then they wanted to sink it with no witnesses and blame Egypt. America would nuke Cairo and the Israelis and Americans could begin to adminnstrate the Suez, the first step in a redrawing of Israeli boundaries to resemble something like this  Don't try to tell me I'm crazy, antisemite, etc. I'm Israeli and I know what they were thinking. It's not something that's in the past. It was almost World War 3. Every Israeli should watch this doc. Al Jazeera aside, old sailors tend not to lie about things.

Israel,3dtec4,Proud2BeSemitic,22,Sun Jul 19 15:23:38 2015 UTC,"you'd expect a forum called 'conspiracy' to want to dig deeper   In my understanding, this is actually the opposite of why conspiracy theorists exist.  They have a surface-level understanding of hugely wide area of subjects - some often quite obscure, giving the appearance of depth - but have no deep understanding of anything. Conspiracy theories arise as the psychological response of weak minds trying to understand complex situations. Everyone wants to understand the world but few are willing to dedicate long, hard hours required to deeply understand any part of it.   Once a given conspiracy theorist has ""taken the red pill"", to use their embarrassingly puerile parlance, after assimilating a tremendous amount of surface-level information which all points mysteriously in the direction of a given conspiracy, confirmation bias takes over completely. Any critical thought which may have been possible is swept away by the overriding requirement that the conspiratorial narrative remain the one truth.   That's why these sorry teenagers believe something so transparently stupid without any question."

I think people who agree with the premise of zionism (as I defined it) but don't think that Israel is the exclusive national homeland of the Jewish people (i.e. it's also the homeland for palestinians) sometimes refer to themselves as anti-zionists, but that might be just to create a contrast between themselves and zionists.

Israel,3durxo,hyperinfinity11,7,Sun Jul 19 18:29:44 2015 UTC,"I don't think there should be a set number. Maybe it's a bit mystic, but I believe that Israel exists only because anti-Semitism does. If it doesn't, then I see no reason for an Israel. Every other group can fall back on another state where they will not be discriminated against for their religion, skin color, etc.. I think Jews deserve that as well. But if Jews do not desire it because anti-Semitism is no longer a big deal, which it currently remains (as the Arab world and rising anti-Semitism in Europe show), then there would be no point to Israel being majority-Jewish anymore. Unfortunately, I don't foresee a time when anti-Semitism stops being a thing. The majority of hate crimes committed against religious groups in the UK and United States are still committed against Jews, by a large margin, even though they are a small portion of the population. Perhaps because they are a small portion of the population.  It may not seem like much, but 6% of the United States has unfavorable opinions of Jews. That translates to about 14 million people (if the US adult population is around 237 million). 14 million people who just don't like Jews. That's more people disliking Jews than there are Jews in the United States. It's close, relatively speaking, to how many Jews there are in the world.  Then there are countries like Indonesia, with an adult population of 150 million. 54% of Malaysia sees Jews unfavorably. That's more than 84 million people who just don't like Jews. There are less than 17 million Jews in the world, and here we have that many who just dislike Jews?  I mean, I can't imagine how long it'll take for this to go away. And again, that's not even a Middle Eastern nation. Imagine Egypt, with an adult population of about 49 million, where 69% of the country doesn't like Jews. That's over 33 million people, double (roughly) the amount of Jews there are in the entire world.  It's crazy, and I don't support having a ""set number"", but I think there will be a majority so long as Jews feel threatened for who they are. When they aren't, I think Israel will change."

Do you not believe there is such a thing as a fundamental right to autonomy? Is there no inherent value in a sovereign nation having the freedom and power to control its collective ""fate""?  Israel exists beyond anti-semitism. Anti-semitism might remind us of the threats nations face when they are powerless, but it is not the reason why Jews have the right to be empowered. Just as individuals have the right to live freely and determine their own identities and goals, whether or not they are being attacked, so do nations have the right to determine their collective futures (or, to quote the U.S. Declaration of Independence, the inherent and inalienable right to ""Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness""), regrdless of whether they are being prosecuted. Jews don't have the right to a state because of the Holocaust and anti-Semitism. Israel's raison d'etre is not simply to serve as a safe haven for Jews, however consequential and necessary that function might be. It is to be a home for the Jewish people, where they might inidividually and collectively live, advance and improve- safe from the shadow of antisemitism, yes- but also independent and empowered to shape their own future."

Israel,3durxo,tuna_HP,2,Sun Jul 19 18:24:40 2015 UTC,"Zionism just means Jews should be allowed to live in a Jewish state in the land of Israel. Any Zionist who thinks that Israel should be exclusively for Jews is simply racist; Jews are no different from most peoples, and we unfortunately have racists too. But no, the Grand majority of Zionists believe that Israel should allow others to live there, though they wish to maintain a Jewish majority, as if the Jews were to become a minority, then it would hardly be a Jewish state.   Most people who are ""anti-Zionists"" don't really know what Zionism is. They associate it with colonialism and right wing politics, when in reality it simply means ""Jews should be allowed to live in Israel.""  People have been trying to tell Jews where they can and can't live for centuries, and the Anti-Zionists are simply the modern version of them. In the 1930's, the European Antisemites would yell ""Jews go back to Palestine!"", and today they sill yell, but today they're AntiZionists, and today they yell ""Jews get out of Palestine!"""

In order for peace Israel wants to steal as much land and possible and seems to be reaping the benefits of exploiting the Palestinians under occupation. Israel detains so many Palestinians on a weekly basis and even tortures them. She humiliates them. She has nothing to offer except prisoners, or allowing Palestinians their basic human rights.  So while your whining about ""bargaining"" Israel is strangling the Gaza population, and continues to restrict Palestinians in Gaza from entering 44% of the territory with the threat of being shot. Israel continues to steal West Bank land and enable settlers attacks. Israel denies Palestinians a right to security and restricts them from the majority of land in the West Bank. Palestinians are denied basic political rights, freedom of movement, economic viability, and so many more grievances."

Israel,3dq5s6,tayaravaknin,15,Mon Jul 20 20:30:57 2015 UTC,"Palestinians would receive their basic human rights easily if so many did not support attacking civilians. Typically you forfeit your rights when you seek to deny those of others, at least some of them.  For example, the right to make use of all the land is forfeited by the need to make tunnels as unlikely as possible, and the illegal entry into Israel as unlikely as possible, because those who illegally enter often seek to deny the right to life of Israeli civilians.  The West Bank is its own story, but your exaggeration of Israel's ""theft"" by offering more land in each negotiation despite the ""growth"" of settlements (happening at a rate of land growth that would take 300 years to annex Area C), is shameful. Your attempt to talk about the denial of Palestinian rights is based around Israel being overzealous in defending its illegal immigrants. I'll take that over allowing them to be lynched, or simply telling Jews they can't live anywhere they buy land legally (which the majority of them do) because it's in another country. Why should they be restricted from entering another country that doesn't yet have sovereignty on land they buy? I'm not sure. Sure, Israel should crack down on settlers who don't legally own the land they live on. How about you now acknowledge that the PA is the real obstacle to peace (which would end this) since it is subsidizing and rewarding the killing of civilians and refuses to sit down to negotiate any kind of deal that doesn't entail hundreds of thousands of people who legally own the land they live on being evicted and sent home, a number that would be higher than the ""humiliated"" Palestinians you claim have been wrongfully evicted since 1967. The Palestinian right to security is guaranteed for those who do not seek to kill civilians. There may be mistakes, of course, or collateral damage during war against an enemy who purposely hides in the most densely populated areas, but this is not Israel denying Palestinians a right to security; it is Hamas doing that, by its violations of the laws of war.  What's really absurd is how fast you went into ""whataboutism"". You saw points about concessions, and there is no doubt that releasing convicted murderers is a concession, and said ""well what about what else Israel does!"". You should be ashamed."
Israel,3dq5s6,yonatanilan,2,Sat Jul 18 19:24:57 2015 UTC,Keep whining. That way we can keep on doing our thing and you can keep on doing yours; it's a win-win situation. You whine while we grow and build.

Israel,3dq5s6,machinedog,10,Sat Jul 18 15:10:57 2015 UTC,"They have no right to make such demands. The 54 Palestinians are terrorists and they are of no consequence to eventual peace. They only harm peace.  The only demand that I see as reasonable is a demand to stop settlement construction for the duration of peace talks. A big component of the peace talks is the settlement question, and continued construction of them makes the talks impossible.  Not that we should be negotiating with Hamas anyway.

Israel,3dt4hm,anti_human,2,Sun Jul 19 15:04:56 2015 UTC,"""‘Israel is safer’ with Iran nuclear deal, says Kerry""  Remember what Clinton said:  ""The world is safer with North Korea nuclear deal."""
Israel,3dt4hm,uncannylizard,5,Sun Jul 19 05:02:07 2015 UTC,"Bad example since the deal worked. When North Korea decided to go for a bomb we knew about it. They were not able to do anything in secret.  We had 3 years notice before they got the bomb. The reason they got the bomb is because we decided not to take action, not because the deal allowed them to cheat and secretly build a bomb."
Israel,3dt4hm,uncannylizard,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:04:27 2015 UTC,"Bad example since the deal worked. When North Korea decided to go for a bomb we knew about it   So assuming they will cheat and do the same like N. Korea, what will the US and the P5+1 do? Don't tell me ""snap""  sanctions - that will definetly deter them as the did to the Dear Leader"
Israel,3dt4hm,saargrin,4,Sun Jul 19 15:22:19 2015 UTC,They have all said clearly that they will have snap sanctions. if that doesn't deter them then they said that they will bomb them.   If the sanctions don't work and they decide in the end to not bomb them then the problem was never the nuclear deal. The problem is that we didnt want to do the only thing that could deter them. Thats a problem that has nothing to do with the nuclear deal. The only thing that the nuclear deal does is give us 12 months warning before they get a bomb if they decide to go for it. if we don't make this deal then we would have 3 months warning if they decide to go for it. If we aren't going to bomb them in 12 months then we definitely aren't going to bomb them in 3 months. No matter how you look at it this deal enhances our position on the nuclear issue.
Israel,3dt4hm,uncannylizard,-1,Sun Jul 19 15:35:17 2015 UTC,Iran is already past the situation where you can just bomb them...not like anybody could plausibly believe US is gonna be involved in another war in the middle east      Theres no inspections..theres no deterrent.. and the game is set up in a way that moneyed interests are going to make it impossible to reimpose sanctions ... look at everybody signing commercial agreements to sell shit in iran  ..they never gonna give that up
Israel,3dt4hm,saargrin,4,Sun Jul 19 19:42:32 2015 UTC,"There are inspections at all they key enrichment sites 24/7. If Iran creates a new enrichment site then we can inspect it within 24 days, experts agree that that's not enough time to hide a nuke program.  If your problem is that the world won't agree to put on sanctions even though they've all signed the deal saying that they will if Iran breaks the deal, then what deal are you looking for? You inherently don't trust any deal."
Israel,3dt4hm,uncannylizard,0,Sun Jul 19 19:54:51 2015 UTC,Frankly i dont trust any deal with people who have signed an agreemebt then turn around and chant death to israel     I understand its hard to grasp when youre not the one living on the bulls eye
Israel,3dt4hm,saargrin,3,Sun Jul 19 20:05:53 2015 UTC,This argument has absolutely nothing to do with trust. Every member of the P5+1 has stressed this point. They are not trusting Iran one one single point. Everything is being verified.
Israel,3dt4hm,uncannylizard,0,Sun Jul 19 20:14:33 2015 UTC,By inspections you need to ask for? Would you agree to that kind of settlement if your neighbor was trying to kill you?
Israel,3dt4hm,saargrin,3,Sun Jul 19 20:18:19 2015 UTC,"No, the inspections are not up to Iran, they are up to the P5+1. If a majorly of the P5+1 wants to inspect then inspections happen, regardless of what Iran wants."
Israel,3dt4hm,uncannylizard,0,Sun Jul 19 20:20:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah.its good to know everybody knew kim is getting a nuke .. its so much safer now ,having known about it all along. Wow"
Israel,3dt4hm,saargrin,3,Sun Jul 19 19:39:46 2015 UTC,What kind of nuke deal were you looking for? This nuke deal keeps Iran 12 months away from a bomb. That was the whole point of it. If they break their side of the deal we will be free to sanction and bomb then if we want.
Israel,3dt4hm,uncannylizard,0,Sun Jul 19 19:51:12 2015 UTC,I want a deal with unlimited inspections and hard measures if iran is caught dirty handed I dont believe theres political will to roll back sanctions when there will be billions in investment .. that just sint gonna happen
Israel,3dt4hm,saargrin,3,Sun Jul 19 20:09:14 2015 UTC,If you oppose removing sanctions because they will be hard to put back on then you oppose any deal with Iran.
Israel,3dt4hm,uncannylizard,0,Sun Jul 19 20:15:22 2015 UTC,I do oppose any deal with iran because any deal will result in nuclear arned iran sooner...

But my favorite place to eat is actually an Italian restaurant: La Repubblica di Ronimotti. It's on Mazeh 3, very close to Allenby, walking distance from the Carmel market.  Nothing spectacular, just well-made Italian food, usually locally sourced and made in the place. They even have their own garden where they grow their vegetables.    They have a great lunch deal too. You get some great first courses (I recommend the Frito Misto or the Salmon), plus coffee and panna cotta / sorbet. And by all means, try the chicken liver and chestnut risotto. It's not actually on the menu anymore (it's in the appetizer section, but you can request to make it a full course), but it's freakin' amazing.  Another recommendation, that for some reason I haven't seen here: Pundak Deluxe in Jaffa. An American-style BBQ place.

My new favourite: MeatMarket @ HaCarmel market. what happens when one of the best butchers opens a meat place in a cheap place....  and outside of TelAviv: MoVaMo @ Rehovot - located at the old (british?) court in rehovot - the best meat place in Israel imho."

For those wondering why this deal is so bad - it doesn't even monitor all the Iranian nuclear sites such as Parchin, and it gives Iran 24 days before there is even a possibility of snap inspections (after warning Iran about all suspicion beforehands), and even then, only if 5 members of the P5+1 support it. It will allow Iran to keep 30,000 centrifuges and to develop more advanced centrifuges. It  will lift restrictions on Iran importing dual use technology, that will allow it to miniaturize warheads.

Considering the US is a republic, that's a scary thought.  What I find particularly fascinating about this move is that he is literally transferring US sovereignty and US clout to the UN. He has effectively pulled power away from his own country and transferred it over to the sham of an organization known as the United Nations. Why isn't there an uproar over this?

We've got some of the highest prices for alcohol in the world. Half a liter of beer will cost you $8-10. Most of this is due to high taxes. There are some bars that somehow get around this by offering a fixed price for 'all you can drink.'

Israel,3dncsr,smellslikestfu,12,Sat Jul 18 03:47:02 2015 UTC,"Let's be clear that you can be anti-zionist without being anti-semitic. However there are anti-semitic undertones that exist in a lot of anti-zionists.   Most people focus on Israel for the fact that it's Jewish. If it was another arab country where they were killing themselves, then no one would care as much. I'm in NO WAY saying that Israel hasn't done things in Gaza. BUT...there are so much shitty things happening in the world that are ignored and whenever Israel is in the news...everybody starts rallying up. And I truly believe that a lot of anti-Israel people don't really give a shit about the Palestinians, and are just using it as another excuse to hate Jews. It gives them a reason to say ""LOOK! Jews are no better than the Nazis"" or that ""Zionists are planning to take over the world!"" I'm pretty sure Palestinians live in neighboring arab countries and they get treated like shit. But guess what? No one cares because it's not Israel.  Anti-Semitism has evolved throughout history. First it was more religious due to Jews not accepting Christ and refusing to convert to Christianity. Then it became more of a racial/nationalistic anti-semitism in which Jews were labeled as an inferior race. Funny because they also claimed how Jews were in banking and controlled the world..NOW, it has to do with Zionism and Israel. Why are the attacks in France and other parts of Europe on Jews happening? It often seems to be motivated because of Israel. Sounds like an excuse to hurt Jews to me."
Israel,3dncsr,uncannylizard,-5,Sat Jul 18 03:59:48 2015 UTC,"Your problem is emphasis, not content. There are lots of reasons why people might emphasize one area over another, its an issue that is talked about a lot and its not always about anti-semitism.  Example 1: Tibet, its probably got the most disproportionate emphasis of any conflict on earth, given the number of people involved and the scale of the crimes, and yet much larger crimes in India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and elsewhere in China, for example, were ignored. Why is Tibet so focused on by westerners? It probably has something to do with the fact that it plays into ideas of Chinese being conquers, religious persecution, racial animosity, imperialism/colonialism, etc. It fits a lot of narratives that make it easy to understand and to argue about.   Example 2: Conflicts rage across Africa, like 3-5 million people killed in the Second Congo War, massive war between Ethiopia and Somalia, war between Tanzania and Congo, the Liberian civil war, etc. Yet the only one that got major play in the west was Rwanda. Why? Same sort of issue. For one the imagery was dramatic, the conflict was simple (Hutus and Tutsis), there was racism, there was colonial issues involved, etc.   So when we think about why the Israeli-Palestinian gets more attention than larger conflicts like the Iran-Iraq war, or the Syrian Civil War, we can look at more issues involved than just anti-semitism. We have white people (Ashkenazis, the dominant jewish segment) being perceived to kick ethnically and religiously different people off their land, and keeping the rest under occupation. It also involves western colonial issues, military supremacy vs weak resistance, etc, all which are narratives and ideas which appeal to people and make the conflict more interesting to think about, similar to Tibet and Rwanda.   And you will also notice that in the Syrian Civil War, where 200,000 people have died, it was only when ISIS started killing a few thousand Yazidis, Kurds, and Christians that the conflict started to grip the international press and started to be covered by news media around the world 24/7, even more than a story about israel/palestine is covered. Disproportionality of attention is not unique to Israel/Palestine is my basic point and anti-semitism, while definitely a factor, is not the only or even major explanatory factor."

There are certainly reasons why people oppose or are critical of Israel that aren’t anti-semitic, such as the ultra religious Jews in America. But no matter what, they overlap.   But if people were truly “just” anti-zionist, then all these anti-semitic attacks on Jews in France  & Europe wouldn’t be happening. What reason do they have to attack them? They have nothing to do with the actions of Israel because they don’t even live there. It’s only because they are Jews. Even if Israel didn’t deem itself a Jewish state, I guarantee there would still be attacks. It’s pathetic. Fucking pathetic. I’m just being realistic here in saying that a lot of people who are anti-Israel, don’t care about the Palestinians. They just want to see Jews destroyed or suffer for many illogical reasons. Do they really think if all Israelis left and gave the land to the Palestinians, that everything would magically be solved and be peaceful? No, because they are not even thinking about it.   It’s a complicated issue. Not all of it has to do with anti-semitism. There are plenty of issues people have with Israel, as you stated in your post. But those lead to a completely different area."

That's the lesson we learned from WWII.  The popular quote I've read is that the reason the West is turning against Israel is because Israel reminds us of the kind of dangerous nationalism that started WWII. Essentially the quote goes that much of the West/Europe learned from WWII that nationalism is a sin and evil. Israelis/Jews learned from WWII that nationalism was necessary.  That's what really cuts to the core of the difference in values between Israel and the West. (And it's not like those values aren't coming back in Europe, where a rising minority of people are beginning to believe that their country should be for their countrymen only, i.e. Front National, Golden Dawn, etc.)  My only problem honestly with these people is that it's hypocritical to concentrate on Israel when there are much bigger fish to fry. If you're going to focus on Israel, you better be criticizing every other country in the middle east even worse. Like, don't support lifting sanctions on Iran while supporting sanctions on Israel."

Israel,3dncsr,anti_human,-3,Sat Jul 18 07:28:04 2015 UTC,"Its a self proclaimed Jewish state and this has guided the actions of the state ever since. It started with a big one when Israel decided to ban 700,000 Israeli arabs from the state of israel on the basis of ethnicity. This is because Israel is a jewish state, if it were not then there would be no justification for violating those peoples rights.   Since then we have seen biased immigration policies that allow foreign jews to arrive, but continue to ban all exiled arab israelis. We have also had a foreign policy predicated on Jewish interests and Jewish goals, such as settling foreign land important to Jews while excluding populations which could dilute the jewish hegemony over the state. You also have basic things like religious jewish groups getting state funding, as well as jewish customs being enforced in public areas such as public transport shutting down on shabbat, etcetera."
Israel,3dncsr,1373,7,Sat Jul 18 07:36:54 2015 UTC,"I don't accept etcetera as an answer. The points you make then are: 1. 700,000 displaced people that are not allowed to return.  2. biased immigration policies.  3. foreign policy (including WB) predicated on Jewish interests. 4. Jewish groups getting preferential funding. 5. Jewish custom of the shabbat being enforced in public areas.  Okay these are all good points.    As to the movement of 700,000 Arab people. It was the result of a war. 8,000 Muslims were killed. 3,000 Jews were killed. You do know that 820,000 Jewish refugees were displaced from Arab lands between 1948 and 1972? 200,000 of those went to Europe and NA. The rest came to Israel. In light of anti-semitism, Israel is the ONLY place Jews can guarantee their safety and freedom. This is a deep origin of the Zionist cause. It is based in fear. A fear based on reality. Foreign policy is Jewish biased no argument here. But how is this a human-right? Funding. This is a matter of degree. I don't know the numbers but lots of secular and non-Jewish groups get money from the state of Israel. Ever been to Europe or the US? Try to buy a beer on Sunday! Try to catch a bus on Christmas!

WE EXTEND our hand to all neighbouring states and their peoples in an offer of peace and good neighbourliness, and appeal to them to establish bonds of cooperation and mutual help with the sovereign Jewish people settled in its own land.

Even looking at someone as divisive as Noam Chomsky and I cannot deny he is a Jew.  Myself, most of my family is in the latter category of what I described in my above comment. I personally identify with the reform movement (although I am an atheist). I went to temple as a child, and I try my best not to miss passover, rosh hashanah, hanukkah, etc with my family. I have a strong attachment to Israel as a national homeland and as a safe haven for Jews which I think is one of the greatest countries in the world, but at the same time I have a strong regard for human rights that causes me to consistently criticize Israel, the US, and just about every other country out there. It's very hard for me to balance these beliefs and so it can become frustrating for me and I often get a little defensive of others because I feel like I would fall under the same categorization.  BDS is a stupid movement that hurts Israelis and will only isolate Israel and cause Israel to lean more radical and to the right, just as many of Israel's behaviors have done to the Palestinians (not that the Palestinians didn't start out bad, but it's made things worse in my belief).

It was good that jewish life was not tied to judaism anymore, because the outside society still saw you as a jew even tough you were an athetist for example.

Israel,3do3ut,Ashoka345,0,Sat Jul 18 16:16:01 2015 UTC,How could Israelis possibly believe that 1 or 100 strikes could truly end Iranian aspirations to a nuclear weapon?  It's not even an achievable objective.   There is no way for Americans and Israelis to do this together. How could Israelis do it unilaterally?  If it were that easy do you think Americans would spend their time negotiating with Iranians?  I and everyone rational think your own nuclear weapons will be  just fine as a deterrent.
Israel,3do3ut,Ashoka345,5,Sat Jul 18 00:56:26 2015 UTC,"It gets really tiring to see so many people treating Iran as some kind of a military superpower. They are not. They'd roll over and die in the event of a serious military offensive led by the US, and they know it. They have been under a major arms embargo for decades, their capability of pushing back concerted U.S. power would be no better than Iraq's. That's why their government offered nearly complete capitulation to the Bush administration after the 2003 invasion. If they are the rational regime that you claim them to be, then they would certainly give up on nuclear aspirations if the tradeoff was international economic isolation and threats up to and including invasion and the certain overthrow of their government and the execution of its leaders. If they would not give up on nukes under such threats, then they are not a rational regime and should never be allowed to have them.  I cannot believe that anyone rational or reasonable is treating the acquisition of nuclear weapons capability by the world's largest sponsor of terrorism, one of the most imperialistic powers around, as an inevitability. Iran has a finite amount of nuclear material, equipment, and scientists. They don't just produce new resources and scientists out of thin air.   Your silly arguments were also used back in the day to describe Iraq's and Syria's nuclear programs. Air strikes and close international policing stopped these programs cold - just as they would with Iran if the U.S. wasn't being led by an overly idealistic fool."

Israel,3dmb5s,Dasheru,10,Sun Jul 19 00:48:05 2015 UTC,i think you don't realize the israeli society achievements...  61% of israelis + 1.5 million arabs have no other connection to western values or democracy than Israel...  there are no reasons why Israel is not a dictatorship like Saudi Arabia or Iraq or Syria...but it isn't...is a liberal democracy with rights and no political correctness hypocrisy...the fact that we are not in the middle of a civil war our self...  and adding 1 million soviet jews...is amazing and nobody else in the planet have manage to achieve something like that...  specially a country with a collection of traumatize people and wars...what kept Israel together during the 50s is beyond explanation...  as for the video...you can try...those 3 shawarmas in one of the scenes...is more meat that you'll find in La Habana in a month...  are you part of the 14% of the first world population?...
Israel,3dmb5s,pavelrub,0,Fri Jul 17 15:08:41 2015 UTC,your mommyblog sucks
Israel,3dmb5s,ladyschmidt,-12,Sat Jul 18 08:55:14 2015 UTC,"I know there is a lot I don't understand, as I don't live in Israel. And I know that it's really important to keep the narratives which structure our lives intact, so makes sense that this would not be a welcome comment here.   I have been to Israel and Palestine, met with peacemakers on each side, and have toured Palestinian refugee camps in the West Bank. while there is much that Israel has accomplished, it has come at an incredible cost. I've spoken with Palestinian families living in caves because their homes were unlawfully demolished to make room for illegal Israeli settlements (even according to your own laws, illegal, and then legitimized when they reach a certain size). And I have met with settlers who acknowledge the inhumane treatment of their Palestinian neighbors. I don't believe Israel is bad or evil in any way, but peace has to be for everyone or it's not peace.  So when I'm working with teenagers in the US, and one of my students is on a year exchange from Gaza, and she can't get back home to her parents because Israel sealed the borders, then I"
Israel,3dmb5s,anti_human,11,Fri Jul 17 19:17:47 2015 UTC,"Hamas got her, guys :("
Israel,3dmb5s,ladyschmidt,2,Fri Jul 17 19:25:04 2015 UTC,"And yet I'm willing to bet that long before you visited Israel and Palestine, you already had a pretty good idea of what's happening and who is to blame for the situation. Therefore you spoke with settlers about their inhumane treatment of Palestinians, but you didn't speak to Palestinians about their actions or attitudes toward Israelis. With Palestinians you spoke about how Israel destroyed their homes to build illegal settlements, but you never spoke to Israelis who lived under rocket fire near Gaza for over a decade. Everything the Palestinians have told you was, I'm sure, accepted immediately as absolute and irrefutable truth, without double checking anything, and without realizing that Palestinians,  guided by European NGOs, are used to telling naive westerners such as yourself exactly what they want to hear.   Even more interesting is the fact that there are people who have done the exact same thing as you - toured Palestinian refugee camps, spoke with ""peacemakers"", spoke with settlers, and even spoke with political leaders from both sides - and have reached the exact opposite conclusions. One even wrote a book about it (though unlike you, this person actually speaks Arabic and could converse with Palestinians in their own language). You should read it.  And then you come here and tell us that ""it's really important to keep the narratives which structure our lives intact"". So one of your students temporarily can't get back home because Israel has sealed the borders with a piece of land governed by Taliban-like terrorists. So fucking what. You really should see more of the world if you think this some sort of a major catastrophe."
Israel,3dmb5s,anti_human,-5,Fri Jul 17 22:25:14 2015 UTC,"And with this kind of reception in r/Israel it's clear that any kind of respectful debate is off the table. I shared my opinion and that's clearly not welcome here. You don't know me any more than I know you, and I certainly didn't presume any personal attacks when I made my comment. Just looking for thoughtful Israelis who can hold both sides of this very complicated situation in tension and see the humanity in everyone. I apologize if it seemed like a personal attack on any one of you, but my comments were in reference to the whole system, and certainly we can all agree that systems, especially government systems, can be messed up and ruin people's lives sometimes."
Israel,3dmb5s,ladyschmidt,6,Fri Jul 17 22:52:39 2015 UTC,Truly a testament to the BUTIFUL SPIROT of /u/ladyschmidt
Israel,3dmb5s,SnowGN,5,Fri Jul 17 23:28:57 2015 UTC,"Oh please, the fact that people disagree with your opinion has nothing to do with it being welcome or unwelcome. This is what people do on this sub - they argue about Israel. If my assumptions do not apply to you and you feel offended by them - I apologize and feel free to ignore them. Yet your description of what you have ""learned"" from touring the country is so extremely selective and one-sided that's it's hard to imagine lack of bias on your part.   Let's not lie to ourselves: It is perfectly clear which side you consider responsible for the situation, who you consider the victims, and where you think the moral blame lies. You aren't looking for ""thoughtful"" Israelis, you are looking for Israelis who agree with your point of view.   I'm all for seeing the humanity in everyone, yet the more I interact with people who hold similar opinions to yours, the more I come to believe that it is precisely they who are unable to see humanity, real humanity - which is both beautiful and ugly - in people. What they seem to see instead are superficial characters in a play they have  themselves created - a projection of their predefined notions of what this ""humanity"" should look like onto people who they don't really know nor truly care about."
Israel,3dmb5s,anti_human,-1,Fri Jul 17 23:32:47 2015 UTC,"Can you help me understand how you, or folks in your social circle in Israel, are intentionally trying to understand multiple perspectives on the conflict, rather than remaining within a one-sided bias?  I didn't speak to it, you're right, but met with many Israelis who live in fear and have experienced the violence of Hamas and other extremists up close. I certainly don't wish that on anyone, AND at the same time I believe the response of treating all Palestinians as second class, or really non-citizens, is not the path to peace."

Israel,3dn24v,evgenetic,13,Fri Jul 17 19:12:07 2015 UTC,"That's nonsense. Israel has a right to continue to exist because it is a sovereign state. Israel was lawfully created because of its objective properties as a state. These objective properties are due to the Jewish people's right to ""reconstitute a Jewish national home"" through ""close settlement of land"". None of this has anything to do with the partition plan, which was a non-binding UNGA resolution (which is what all UNGA resolutions are, non-binding)."
Israel,3dn24v,xhrit,-6,Fri Jul 17 19:59:45 2015 UTC,"but it is a sovereign state only because UN made it so, before the partition plan it was just a bunch of immigrants on a bought land, that doesn't constitute a state."
Israel,3dn24v,eaturbrainz,7,Fri Jul 17 20:03:43 2015 UTC,"but it is a sovereign state only because UN made it so   That's completely false. It is a sovereign state because it meets the criteria of a sovereign state, as set forth in Montevideo Convention on the Rights and Duties of States. That it is a member of the UN is a strong indication that it is indeed a state, but it is not the membership in the UN that makes it one. Conversely, Palestine is not a state despite its observer membership in the UN, because it fails the Montevideo criteria - and it does so precisely because it claims that the territory that it does not control and never has controlled or even had an exclusive title to is within its sovereignty. In that sense, Palestinian membership in the UN is a despicable and dishonest political ploy to make it a state contrary to the objective reality.   before the partition plan it was just a bunch of immigrants on a bought land, that doesn't constitute a state   What you call bunch of immigrants is the Montevideo permanent population; the bought land which due to Arab aggression was expanded into 1949 lines is Montevideo defined territory; the election of the government is, well, Montevideo government and the capacity to enter international relations. Israel is objectively a state. Palestine is a quasi-state at best.  And of course prior to all that there was the right of the Jewish people to settle in Palestine, which was not qualified to this or that part or bought land only, and most certainly includes the territories that Palestinians claim as exclusively theirs - to wit, without any legal or moral foundation."
Israel,3dn24v,evgenetic,4,Sat Jul 18 02:44:09 2015 UTC,"That bunch of immigrants(and local-born natives) was highly organized and motivated, declared its independence and started ruling territory, then fought to keep it that way.

Israel,3dmxe0,GetSoft4U,11,Fri Jul 17 15:58:35 2015 UTC,Also the main question is why they still wear the same eastern European outfit in Bnei Brak when it's 40c and 99% humidity where they stink like there's no tomorrow...this is because they believe that if they mitigate any one of those dress codes then it will all collapse...
Israel,3dmxe0,anti_human,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:07:09 2015 UTC,"Seriously, as a goy, I've always wondered this. Even the video in the OP tells that there's no actual rule telling they should be dressing like that.   this is because they believe that if they mitigate any one of those dress codes then it will all collapse   Is this really the reason somehow? Could you expand on that? How else do they justify the ""dress code""?"
Israel,3dmxe0,FrankOBall,6,Fri Jul 17 18:35:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah. They believe that if a single one of those ancient Hassidic dogmas/rules and regulation is taken away (or eased up) then it will all crumble down (their entire way of life). Which is why they wear these ridiculously cumbersome clothes in insanely hot Israel.  They still sometimes make adjustments to these rules, but it takes ages to agree upon and it's very calculated."
Israel,3dmxe0,anti_human,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:41:50 2015 UTC,"I understand, but what if someone demonstrates that there's no written rule whatsoever that they would break if they dressed differently?  So does the explanation you provided apply to habits, too, and not only to written laws?  By the way to me it would make much more sense if someone dressed like in the Bible times upon his arrival in Israel: it should be the ""real thing"", more ancient traditions, meaning more authentic from a religious point of view."
Israel,3dmxe0,FrankOBall,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:52:55 2015 UTC,It's the same with Buddhist monks and many other religions. There aren't always written laws just oral traditions.   meaning more authentic from a religious point of view   You can read more about the Hasidic movement
Israel,3dmxe0,anti_human,3,Fri Jul 17 18:57:18 2015 UTC,"It also has to be seen in its historical context. Around that time (late 17th century onwards) the enlightenment ""haskalah"" was going on in western and central Europe. Slowly, Jews were being accepted into broader European society. But part of the tradeoff, particularly until late 19th century, was that Jews were expected to assimilate, if not convert, to be fully accepted. So you have Jews converting out, becoming secular, reform Judaism etc - huge changes for a people who've kept their religion very closely for well over 1000yrs in Europe. So there was a reaction against the haskalah -kinda like the counter-reformation. And so the counter movement tried to prevent any changes that may lead to assimilation etc.  Things like dress codes take on far more importance as a way of preventing change/assimilation (and yes it started as copying polish gentry in the 16-17th century but by 18-19th century secular european non-jewish dress codes had moved on)"

Israel,3dnzgc,Ashoka345,5,Sat Jul 18 01:02:32 2015 UTC,Then why don't the Israelis open up to international inspections?  I'm sure the IAEA would be quite interested
Israel,3dnzgc,machinedog,2,Sat Jul 18 02:04:51 2015 UTC,"Because the West has pretty well decided that Israel is allowed to have nuclear weapons, and Iran isn't. We don't really play a game of allowing any country that wishes to obtain them. If Israel hadn't yet obtained nuclear weapons, and was working to obtain them, perhaps we would consider pushing for inspections. At this point, it's just stupid."
Israel,3dnzgc,bijann,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:26:14 2015 UTC,"Maybe because they're still a sovereign country who has to keep developing their military. Every country has certain things they don't want the rest of the world to see, why would Iran be any different.  The US actually abused instant inspections in Iraq and used it learn some secrets about their military/government. I'll try to find that article if I can."
Israel,3dnzgc,mohajaf,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:24:30 2015 UTC,For years the regime's propaganda machine has made the nuclear issue all about national pride. That is how they get even their opposition to sympathize with them on this matter. That kind of at will inspection would've been too humiliating. Hell once Iranians are done with all the street celebrations and start looking closer they might find that even this deal is rather humiliating for any self respecting sovereign nation.
Israel,3dnzgc,Ashoka345,-1,Sat Jul 18 05:28:04 2015 UTC,"Yea why does Israel reject requests to inspect their nuclear arsenal?

Otherwise why not let the IAEA in and see what you're up to?  And Americans have threatened the existence of plenty of people, doesn't prevent us from having nuclear weapons. In fact we've used them on civilian populations.   We all know Israelis could wipe out every major Iranian population center pretty easily.   Mutually assured destruction is good enough for everyone else, it's going to have to be good enough for the Jews.   Why you think Israelis are do more guarantees than that, I have no idea."

Why would you think that anyone who matters in the Iranian negotiations (Israel doesn't) cares about that question?  Or anyone, including Iranians have to care about your query?   lol, even if they did say they were going to wipe you off the map. So what?  Israel has the power to force them to listen? Or anyone?  Why would an Israeli think he's due any answers from anyone?   That's not how the world works. Iran answers to the P5+1 because they have power over their economic future.   The only pertinent questions are ones asked by those with the power to solicit answers. And that question isn't relevant to western interests.   Somewhat amusing that you think you're due an answer.   Now why would you think Israelis aren't morally culpable for their secret weapons program when Iranians are?  Because we Americans said so? I can assure you that's not very sound reasoning."

If one Muslim nation did to another Muslim nation what you did and are still doing to Palestinians, there would be a ferocious resistance, as well.   Except there wouldn't. Have you seen how Muslim nations treat themselves, let alone each other? Where's the outcry for BDS against Saudi Arabia as it destroys Yemen? Where's the outcry for BDS as Assad murders tens of thousands of his own people? Where's the outcry as Saudi Arabia doesn't even let women drive?  Is anyone boycotting oil? Is anyone boycotting Syrian goods, the few they can find? Is anyone going to boycott Iranian goods when they come to market, since Iran executes more people in 5 years than Israel kills Palestinians? Does anyone care to boycott Egypt, which is also blockading Gaza (and more heavily than Israel, at that, on its border at least)? Will someone ask that Gaza stop attacking Israel?  Take it from a Palestinian human rights activist, who put it thusly:   The all-time champions in dehumanizing Palestinians, however, are the inappropriately named “pro-Palestinian” activists.  While some Zionists unfairly ignore any deaths in Gaza, “pro-Palestinian” activists use Palestinian deaths for propaganda purposes and in the same breath refuse to demand an end to terrorist attacks from Gaza.  Yet stopping terrorist attacks from Gaza is the only way to prevent civilians from being caught in the crossfire of retaliations by Israel.  While some Zionists see the defense of Israel as an objective that overrides any Palestinian interests, “pro-Palestinian” activists see the destruction of Israel as an objective that can only be achieved through Palestinian deaths.  In the West Bank too, “pro-Palestinian” activists use Palestinians as pawns. They are engaged in a campaign to de-legitimize Israeli businesses that operate in the West Bank regardless of the fact that those businesses typically provide good employment opportunities to Palestinians.  “Pro-Palestinian” activists see the loss of jobs by Palestinians as a reasonable price to pay for the greater goal of weakening Israel.  The “pro-Palestinian” activists have therefore entirely completed the switch from supposedly being pro-Palestinian to being fully anti-Palestinian.  While they claim to defend the interests of Palestinians, they in fact thrive on the deaths and unemployment of Palestinians.   Sure, some criticism about Israel isn't anti-Semitic, and is just based on salience. But the demonization of Israel in this way is unnatural, unfair, and distracts from context and other issues that are far more pressing. And that's the sad part: the ""cool"" thing to do is bash Israel, but no one will give a flying fuck about Sudan's genocide and urge the leader's arrest, no one cared about the Yazidis for more than a couple of weeks (hyperbole here), and no one cares about the ongoing and very real discrimination in every Arab country. What they do care about is Israel.  They claim it's because Israel should be held to a higher standard. Personally, when I look at a hellhole and I look at a place with some bad traits, I think the hellhole is more in need of change. And guess what? So do the people who need help. They would happily deal with some issues in Israel until they're addressed, or even live in the West Bank or Gaza, compared to their lives now. Compare Gaza to Yemen, and it's a cakewalk. At least in Gaza, 1.6 million tons of goods come in over a 5 month period. And so when I look at Gaza, which has a genocidal ruling party, and I look at Saudi Arabia's actions in Yemen, with their dictatorial monarchy that suppresses any shred of dissent, executes people for ""sorcery"", has no education system, and is bombing Yemen to pieces for real, then I say that needs to be fixed. Because having people be alive is a prerequisite to having a good life. And the fact that people care less about Yemen than they do about Israel and Palestine is disturbing beyond all belief."

I've seen documentaries, I've seen lots of footage where it can be seen how your soldiers treat the Palestinians who are working on the other side of the fence. I've seen how your soldiers treat Palestinian children. It is known what your government has done with false flag attacks just to spark the wars. How can you justify that?!    These are crimes against humanity. Does it make you proud? The fact that Saudi Arabia also commits crimes does not make yours less disgusting or more justified.

Here is wikipedia on the subject:   Journalist Badih Chayban in an 23 October 2002 article in The Daily Star wrote that Nasrallah said, ""If they [the Jews] all gather in Israel, it will save us the trouble of going after them worldwide."" Charles Glass believes that the quotation was likely a fabrication, citing other published accounts of Nasrallah's speech that had no reference to the anti-Semitic comment, and statements by the editor-in-chief of the Lebanese newspaper which published the quotes, that questioned both the translation and the ""agenda of the translator.""[48] Glass also wrote that a Hezbollah spokeswoman, Wafa Hoteit, denied that Nasrallah made the statement.[48]   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hassan_Nasrallah#Views_attributed_to_Nasrallah  Here are actual quotes from Nasrallah:    On 30 November 2009, while reading the party's new political manifesto, Hasan Nasrallah declared ""Our problem with [the Israelis] is not that they are Jews, but that they are occupiers who are raping our land and holy places.""[29]  In a television interview with Julian Assange on 17 April 2012, Nasrallah said that Israel ""is and will be an illegal state… It was established on the basis of occupying the lands of others."" He added, ""If I occupy your house by force it doesn't become mine in 50 or 100 years."" While ""Hezbollah does not want to kill anyone"", the only solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, he argued, was to establish a democratic state on Palestinian land where Muslims, Jews and Christians live in peace but that the US ""won't let people listen to Hezbollah.""[30]   The article has a valid point to make but it would be much stronger if it did not invent reasons to hate Hezbollah and instead dealt with their actual crimes, like their methods, and with their actual ideology which is completely nuts, even if its not genocidal."

Also, you seem to take Nasrallah's words to western media about democracy at face value...lol, it's like the leftists haven't learned anything in the last 40 years... Back then Narsallah's master Khomeini also promised democracy and freedom in Iran.   So you try to discredit that quote of Narsallah, then selectively display  a pair of quotes made to western media, while ignoring all the other quotes, which are in stark contrast to the propaganda narrative you've constructed. Well done, Hizbollah should consider employing you.  Here are some more relevant Narsallah quotes, from your own flawed source:   Nasrallah said in a speech delivered in Beirut and aired on Al-Manar TV on 28 September 2001: ""What do the Jews want? They want security and money. Throughout history the Jews have been Allah's most cowardly and avaricious creatures. If you look all over the world, you will find no one more miserly or greedy than they are.""  n a speech aired on Al-Manar and Al-Jazeera in 2006, Nasrallah expressed support for alleged Holocaust denier Roger Garaudy calling him a ""great French philosopher"" who ""proved ([ [sic]]) that this Holocaust is a myth"".  In a 1998 speech marking the Day of Ashura, and published in what was Hasan Nasrallah's official website[38][39][40] at that time, Nasrallah referred to Israel as ""the state of the grandsons of apes and pigs – the Zionist Jews"" and condemned them as ""the murderers of the prophets."""

Israel,3dk5ic,uncannylizard,6,Fri Jul 17 14:19:05 2015 UTC,"But can't you see you weren't just saying ""this quote is widely disputed"".   You said ""it is propagating well known myths, like the idea that Hassan Nasrallah wrote :""If they [the Jews] all gather in Israel, it will save us the trouble of going after them worldwide."" "" - That is not the same as saying that quote is disputed, that is declaring the quote a myth.  If that were not enough, to add insult to injury, you then proceeded with ""Here are actual quotes from Nasrallah:"", and immediately after this rather condescending remark you produced a pair of selective quotes made to western media in an attempt to paint Narsallah in a more moderate light.   I don't see the merit in trying to play coy now, when everyone can see your original comment a few cm above."
Israel,3dk5ic,iranianshill,-6,Fri Jul 17 14:28:50 2015 UTC,"It's not moderate. Calling for Israel to be destroyed is not moderate.   But that's different from denying that Nasrallah would be okay with Jews living in Palestine. Muslim societies have long lived with Jewish minorities and the Quran lays out specific guidelines for Jews to be granted rights under Sharia law.   I hate Sharia law and all who propagate it, and I hate Nasrallah and Hezbollah who is bad for Israel and bad for Lebanon. But lying about them doesn't make your argument stronger. You can even say that they are antisemitic without saying that they are genocidal."
Israel,3dk5ic,uncannylizard,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:37:44 2015 UTC,"Here is the actual quote:    But I’ll tell you. Among the signs […] and signals which guide us, in the Islamic prophecies and not only in the Jewish prophecies, is that this State [of Israel] will be established, and that the Jews will gather from all parts of the world into occupied Palestine, not in order to bring about the anti-Christ and the end of the world, but rather that Allah the Glorified and Most High wants to save you from having to go to the ends of the world, for they have gathered in one place–they have gathered in one place–and there the final and decisive battle will take place.   This was paraphrased by Netanyahu as:   'If all the Jews gather in Israel, it will save us the trouble of chasing them down around the world   He's pretty much spot on apart from the 'if' at the beginning, the spirit of the quote remains the same."

All of the nuclear sites that the world is currently worried about have anytime inspections. Iran stated that it would not allow random inspections of its non-nuclear military sites (a very reasonable request). The P5+1 said that that was unacceptable so they made a proposal to give 24 days notice to those sites, which nowhere close to enough time to hide an enrichment facility (which would be actively observed by satellites).

No inspections.  Parchin is the top secret facility the Iranians tried to hid from existence specifically singled out in the November 2011 IAEA report for  “strong indicators of possible weapon development.” again in 2012 and again the IAEA report of Feb. 2015 for extremely suspicious activity, unmistakable of nuclear weapons detonator research.

Israel,3di867,SnowGN,2,Thu Jul 16 22:33:03 2015 UTC,That wasn't up to us. The whole world sanctioned Iran for the sole purpose of getting a nuclear deal. The USA had no ability to maintain the sanctions regime while refusing to make a nuclear deal. the sanctions regime would have collapsed and we would have achieved nothing. Iran would have its money and would have no restrictions on its nuclear program. Thats what you are advocating.
Israel,3di867,uncannylizard,2,Thu Jul 16 22:45:40 2015 UTC,"Good god are you kidding me with this weak horseshit. We are the United States of freaking America.

Israel,3di867,SnowGN,-2,Fri Jul 17 05:45:20 2015 UTC,"Nice, SnowGN, nice. Suggesting that America can strong arm Russia, China, Germany, France, and the UK into all converting nuclear sanctions into regime change sanctions. This is ridiculous. ""surrounding american leadership"", give me a break, what are you, a republican soundboard?"
Israel,3di867,uncannylizard,2,Fri Jul 17 05:57:57 2015 UTC,"Yes, yes we can do exactly that. Europe does as the US commands in regards to foreign policy. And we wouldn't need to strong arm France and the UK of all countries...they like Iran even less than we do. Russia, yes, obviously. China is the most problematic, but like Russia it has no power projection and will do as the US commands in its area of influence - Middle Eastern waters. China has no particular political bone to chew in this fight anyway. They just want oil and vaguely want to reduce relative US global power. No country in the world has an answer to a carrier group.  What are you, a defeatist who doesn't understand just how powerful and essential strong American leadership is?"
Israel,3di867,SnowGN,-1,Fri Jul 17 06:03:16 2015 UTC,"Yes, yes we can do exactly that. Europe does as the US commands in regards to foreign policy.    What a joke, they go against us all the time. Like France defying us when it came to the iraq war, or all the europeans when it comes to defending Israel at the UNSC, or many other issues.    No country in the world has an answer to a carrier group.   China and Russia both do. And what the hell are you saying, that we are going to militarily threaten them if they don't sanction iran even after we reach a deal on nuclear weapons?    What are you, a defeatist who doesn't understand just how powerful and essential strong American leadership is?   I'm not a defeatist, I'm a pragmatist looking for the best way to pursue our interests. America doesn't get its way through intimidating other world powers. This is fantasy."

This kind of news always get media attention and believe me or not, it gets way more attention than when it happens to Muslims or Christians. I (sadly) too often hear this kind of stories and last time this woman was raped in front of her boyfriend I heard it too and this brought tears to my eyes.  I was not trying to insult you, I don't know much either. I am French and have friends who are Jews but I am no expert.  I am just wondering what you are trying to do. Are you trying to scare Jews? You said ""Jews are not French""? What does that mean? Is that your opinion? Because I don't know any French person, jewish or not who feels that way.  I know that Jews are getting attacked more often than Muslims or Christians but I think there is a big stretch between this and claiming that Jews are unsafe here and that they should move to Israel. It seems like YOU have a problem with Jews living outside of Israel. French Jews are french and they have no reason to move away from France except the hatred and scare that people like you are spreading."
Israel,3dffg4,TimToTheTea,2,Thu Jul 16 04:04:45 2015 UTC,"Hey, thanks for joining the conversation (this is not sarcasm or anything).  I've met a lot of religious jews that recently moved from France to Israel in ulpan, and everyone I talked with said that they were not safe to express their judaism publicly. (Of course, I realise that they can not be representative of all french jews, because I only talked to ones that decided to do aliyah). They never wore kippot in subway or public transportation in Paris and they were careful about areas they visit, because they were feeling especially unsafe in muslim neighbourhoods. I only know about this through hearsay. Do these statements seem realistic to you, or would you think that they got paranoid?"
Israel,3dffg4,golergka,2,Thu Jul 16 07:31:34 2015 UTC,"No, thank you for joining the conversation and I'm really happy I can talk with you about that.  I am living outside of France and haven't been in contact with my friends for a little bit so I don't really know what it is like right now but unforunately I think more and more people in France feel the same way as the people you talked to.  But I don't think it is specific to the Jews, I think a lot of people feel insecure in some of the poorest suburbs of Paris. Hell, my sister (who's an Arab) has a long list of suburbs she decides she would never step foot because she does not feel secure. I have never experienced being Jew in these neighbourhoods myself so it is hard to tell but I am sure that some Jews (who look religious) in these neighbourhoods get verbally abused by some assholes from time to time.  But most neighbourhoods of Paris are really safe and where I used to live was a Jewish neighbourhood and lots of people were wearing the kippa and the traditional clothes, hats and beard (sorry, don't know the names in English).  Anyway, I guess what I'm trying to say is that I feel that the great majority of neighbourhoods is safe but that some places seem like hell for everyone and I guess probably more hellish for Jews. French jews suffer a bigger number of attacks tham any religion (compared to the size of the group) and I agree that it is pretty sickening."
Israel,3dffg4,TimToTheTea,2,Thu Jul 16 10:34:41 2015 UTC,"Thanks for clarifying that. It seems like those neighbourhood would be equally dangerous for anyone, the only difference being that religious jews would get anti-semitic verbal attacks added to the mix."

OP is happy to shit on our nation and our living together, pouring his hateful bile.  OP and propaganda can go to be put.   /r/france seems to be such a nice, jew-friendly place."
Israel,3dffg4,golergka,13,Thu Jul 16 07:27:38 2015 UTC,"I don't think the commenter was being anti-Jew. I think the people in /r/france were quite unhappy about OP's title which roughly translates ""Once again, A jewish family attack"".  /r/france usually likes the titles to be the ones of the article. And to be honest, OP commented something quite hateful towards France implying that French people were antisemitic before anyone had commented anything. So it is not a good start to be honest.  French redditors did react badly but it does not mean that they agree with this attack. They hate the attack but they don't think the attack means that Jews are unsafe and they should move to Israel. They are sick of hearing this kind of speech and hearing things that disturb living as a community/nation. So they are like: ""yes, sadly, this has happened but stop fucking telling our Jews to move to Israel, they are not Israelians, they're French"".  I am being completely honest and transparent with you, as a French person I can guarantee that is what this top comment means."
Israel,3dffg4,TimToTheTea,-2,Thu Jul 16 10:54:57 2015 UTC,"implying that French people were antisemitic   I don't think that this was implied. I think that implication was that jews in France are constantly attacked, and after what happened during the last year (and it seems that small-scale attacks like OP happen all time) it implication is true, no?   they don't think the attack means that Jews are unsafe and they should move to Israel   From scope attacks reported in the media and what I hear from religious jews moving from France to Israel recently, this also seems to be true."
Israel,3dffg4,golergka,4,Thu Jul 16 11:11:59 2015 UTC,"No, I am talking about a comment OP posted before anyone else had commented saying that Once again our fellow citizen were being attacked and we did not care  ""fraternite my ass"". So people probably did not react well to that.  About your second point 3 attacks a year on a population of 200 000 still does not mean that jews should flee the country.  But I do understand french jews' feeling and I agree that thr number of attacks is still to high."
Israel,3dffg4,TimToTheTea,2,Thu Jul 16 11:49:01 2015 UTC,"I replied in the thread (as someone who has never posted or been to the France subreddit before) just to clarify about the one comment and how  they were saying it is propaganda that the reason why they were attacked was ""because they were Jewish"" and they thought the victims were lying because only the family is around and could tell the whys of the incident - and got a pretty scathing response that was upvoted while mine was downvoted.   To be honest, the reply to my benign comment only solidified for me what everyone has been telling me about Jewish people in France. Which is very sad, because when I visited there more than a decade ago I had such a lovely time - but it is really more than just a safety issue for Jews there now, and the France subreddit just reinforced that for me."
Israel,3dffg4,shiskebob,3,Thu Jul 16 16:40:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah... I just read the thread and the response you got was completely inapropriate. But I don't think it reflects what everyone thinks.  I think the big problem in this thread is a cultural barrier. Israelians are like: ""fuck all these attacks, this is a big problem, french jews should just come to Israel"" and French people try to minimise them because they would hate to have the jews flee because of unsafety.  But French people think that Israelians are trying to spread fear and Israelians think that Feench people just don't give a shit about Jews being unsafe."
Israel,3dffg4,TimToTheTea,7,Thu Jul 16 21:31:11 2015 UTC,"You should know it is not a good habit to rely on Google translate... Here is my take.

OP se fait un plaisir de chier sur notre nation et notre vivre ensemble, en déversant sa bile haineuse.   OP takes pleasure in fucking our nation and our way of life, by throwing in his hate rant.

I don't think ""to be put"" means anything without context. ""To be put in the ass"" might have been better. Also ""OP and propaganda"" is not the same as ""OP and his propaganda"", implying OP is here to provide propaganda (thus, being malicious) while ""OP and propaganda"" would mean that OP is victim of propaganda.

Israel,3dinm3,jtf2,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:03:16 2015 UTC,"Its more complicated -- the NPT isn't the only prohibition on proliferation.   The International Court of Justice has ruled in an advisory opinion that  Using or threatening to use nuclear weapons except in extreme case of self-defense is illegal -- but self-defense requires proportionality, which itself would mean only using nukes in reponse to nukes while the US refuses to rule out the first use of nukes (China has) even against non-nuclear armed adversaries. Furthermore simply possessing nukes ain't illegal but these are such dangerous weapons that possession can be equated with threat of use. Otherwise, why possess them?  Aside from the ICJ ruling  There is now an established global NORM of non-proliferation that applies regardless of whether you signed the NPT or not. That's why nations have agreed to the discriminatory nature of the NPT.  http://www.gwu.edu/~ieresgwu/assets/docs/ponars/pepm_142.pdf  http://www.isn.ethz.ch/Digital-Library/Articles/Detail/?id=190054  http://utnorms.wikispaces.com/Nuclear+Weapons"

I don't think your point is in the right perspective.  The moment Israel gives up nukes it gives up its biggest deterrent. If you think a few pieces of paper are going to serve as a better deterrent, I have a bridge to sell you."
Israel,3dinm3,tayaravaknin,0,Fri Jul 17 03:45:06 2015 UTC,"Iran was always ""constrained"" by the NPT and Iran's nuclear program was always legal http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/jun/09/iran-nuclear-power-un-threat-peace  The first thing you have understand: There was actually never any actual evidence of any nuclear weapons program in Iran, ever.  The ""Iranian nuclear threat"" was always just another pretext to pressure the regime in the hopes of toppling it, as was ""WMDs in Iraq"" -- in fact the policy was brought to you by the very same Bush administration people who continued to serve in the first Obama admin. (read up on Dennis Ross)  Iran had historically been making significant compromise offers on its nuclear program, that the US ignored or even actively killed off, in order to prevent a peaceful resolution and to keep the ""Iranian nuclear threat"" alive.  http://news.antiwar.com/2011/04/20/elbaradei-us-europe-werent-interested-in-compromise-with-iran/  http://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/05/opinion/05iht-edzarif.html?_r=0  http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/06/17/AR2006061700727.html  The Bush administration imposed an unrealistic and illegal demand called ""Zero Enrichment"" -http://thinkprogress.org/security/2013/10/24/2823381/hawks-enrichment-war-iran/ - which would have required Iran to give up her sovereign right as recognized by the NonProliferation Treaty. This was a deliberate policy of the Bush admin, to prevent any deal.  The second Obama admin dropped the zero enrichment demand, and signaled that it is willing to resolve the nuclear issue, which is what we're seeing today. The significance of this is not in the details of the nuclear deal itself, but in that the US and Iran are finding ways to get along rather than continuing towards a conflict.  That's why there are many forces opposed to such a deal and insist that the US and Iran should not be talking but that the US should be attacking Iran instead, including Israel and the proIsraeli lobby in the US which has been pushing for a war for a while now.http://www.uscatholic.org/culture/war-and-peace/2008/06/iran-spam  There are others who say that the US should not listen to the Israelis and should instead ""Go to Iran"" just as Nixon ""went to China"" and decided to open up relations with those countries rather than continue the emnity. http://www.amazon.com/Going-Tehran-America-Islamic-Republic/dp/1250043530  So you see the nuclear issue is not really about nukes but is just a part of a larger political dispute. There are no Iranian nukes just as there were no Iraqi WMDs In reality, Iran's ""capability"" to make nukes is hardly unique -- 40 nations were already capable of quickly making nukes if they wanted to, back 10 years ago. More now, presumably. http://old.seattletimes.com/html/nationworld/2002041473_nukes21.html  That's because the ""capability"" to make nukes comes with becoming technologically developed, not because these 40 nations want to make nukes. Nukes are actually more of a liability than an asset  There's no reason to just assume that Iran wants nukes either. http://nationalinterest.org/commentary/ten-reasons-iran-doesnt-want-the-bomb-7802  There's zero evidence of any Iranian nuclear weapons program, ever.   Despite growing international concern about Iran's nuclear program and its regional ambitions, most U.S. intelligence shared with the U.N. nuclear watchdog agency has proved inaccurate, and none has led to significant discoveries inside Iran, diplomats here said. http://www.sfgate.com/politics/article/Most-U-S-tips-fingering-Iran-false-envoys-2646358.php   According to IAEA Director Elbaradei:   I have been making it very clear that with regard to these alleged studies, we have not seen any use of nuclear material, we have not received any information that Iran has manufactured any part of a nuclear weapon or component. That’s why I say, to present the Iran threat as imminent is hype. http://svaradarajan.blogspot.com/2009/10/elbaradei-interview-language-of-force.html   And   With respect to a recent media report, the IAEA reiterates that it has no concrete proof that there is or has been a nuclear weapon programme in Iran. http://www.reuters.com/article/2009/09/17/us-nuclear-iaea-iran-sb-idUSTRE58G60W20090917   and   The IAEA is not making any judgment at all whether Iran even had weaponisation studies before because there is a major question of authenticity of the documents. http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/article28114.ece   Even the new, US-backed IAEA Director   The incoming head of the U.N. nuclear watchdog said on Friday he did not see any hard evidence Iran was trying to gain the ability to develop nuclear arms. ""I don't see any evidence in IAEA official documents about this,"" Yukiya Amano told Reuters in his first direct comment on Iran's atomic program since his election, when asked whether he believed Tehran was seeking nuclear weapons capability. http://www.reuters.com/article/2009/07/03/us-nuclear-iaea-iran-exclusive-idUSL312024420090703   and lets remember that Iran has bent over backwards and has actually allowed more inspections than legally required   ""Any country, I think, would be rather reluctant to let international inspectors to go anywhere in a military site,"" Mr. Blix told Al Jazeera English about Parchin in late March. ""In a way, the Iranians have been more open than most other countries would be."" http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Middle-East/2012/0420/Iran-s-Parchin-complex-Why-are-nuclear-inspectors-so-focused-on-it   Claims that Iran blocked legally-required inspections were denied by even the IAEA http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/05/11/us-iran-nuclear-iaea-idUSKRA15680720070511  So lets see, that's ELBaradei, Blix, and even Amano (who had actually sworn loyalty to the US )  And actual arms inspectors   Iran has mastered many technologies in the uranium-handling and enrichment areas, such that if they wanted to go ahead, they probably could do it. That would make them a threshold state. We can name any number of other states in the world with the same level of technology and expertise. It's the intent that you have to worry about. We don't see intent to this case.   http://therealnews.com/t2/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=31&Itemid=74&jumival=13286  And 5 European ambassadors to Iran say that too http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/jun/09/iran-nuclear-power-un-threat-peace  And actual nuclear experts http://original.antiwar.com/yousaf-butt/2014/06/18/what-is-the-quality-of-scientific-evidence-against-iran/  Oh and the actual international community also says it http://indianexpress.com/article/news-archive/web/india-with-nam-in-slamming-iaea-report-on-iran/  Nonaligned states protest Israeli attacks on IAEA http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/11/22/us-nuclear-iaea-nonaligned-idUSL2187147520071122  This book is all about that http://www.amazon.com/Manufactured-Crisis-Untold-Story-Nuclear/dp/1935982338"

Israel,3dinm3,kr613,0,Thu Jul 16 18:58:12 2015 UTC,"What do you mean ""come clean""? Israel never denied having nuclear weapons and never signed the NPT. Having nuclear weapons isn't itself illegal - the US, Russia, China, the UK and France are, as part of the NPT, allowed to have nuclear weapons. Personally, I think that if Israel has nuclear weapons, in should accede to the NPT as an NWS.  The problem with Iran having nuclear weapons is two-fold. First, it signed treaty which prohibits it from getting nuclear weapons. And second, who in their right mind would want Iran, a state run by theocratic psychopaths to have them?"
Israel,3dinm3,yonatanilan,3,Fri Jul 17 12:42:19 2015 UTC,"Israel never denied having nuclear weapons and never signed the NPT.   That is true, but misleading. Israel has neither denied nor confirmed having a nuclear weapon https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/israel/2010-09-01/bringing-israels-bomb-out-basement  Iran does not have nuclear weapons and now will not be able to without first expelling the IAEA inspectors from the country, giving the world at least six months to decide what, if anything, needs to be done about an Iranian nuclear weapons program.  Israel's nukes are actually a much bigger problem, given that Israel has shown no hesitation to initiate hostilities with its neighbors and launch aggressive wars of conquest while gradually stealing the land of the people of Palestine.   If Israel would join the NPT, then there would be a recognition of the number and type of Israel's weapons and also an evaluation of Israel's nuclear weapons protocols.    second, who in their right mind would want Iran, a state run by theocratic psychopaths to have them?   Sorry, I think you are speaking about Israel. Naftali Bennet, Ayelet Shaked, (ministers in the current government) are talking about the ethnic cleansing of Greater Israel."

Ah yes, the aggressive wars of conquest - starting in 1947, Israel's aggression by getting UN support aggressively caused the ""people of Palestine"" to peacefully start a civil war aimed at gently removing the Jewish communities from land they aggressively purchased in violently consensual property transactions; then in May 1948 Israel aggressively brought on the combined peace-corps of Egypt, Jordan, Syria, Iraq and Lebanon to peacefully nudge the Jews into the sea...  Your mind has become mush from all the propaganda you've been eating up.   people of Palestine   Um, yeah, Palestine ceased being a thing in 1948 when Israel succeeded the British Mandate and Jordan and Egypt occupied parts of it...

Israel,3dkj1s,GetSoft4U,-4,Fri Jul 17 11:04:36 2015 UTC,"about what...    reflection or embarrassment at the destruction. The loss of life from laser guided bombs and the wholesale devastation from mortars and tanks. The destitution of so many in the Gaza strip. I'm embarrassed that 'my country' facilitated some of this.   I live far away in a cold and peaceful place. Edinburgh in Scotland, and soon we move to Denmark. The last time I was in Israel was in the early 80's and I was still quite young. But I remember being there. I remember Jerusalem and the kibbutz that we visited. Carrots that were unlike anything I had ever tasted. I remember the sea of Galilee and the fish thrashing at our ankles. We were just tourists. The country has changed dramatically in the time that I have been alive. The situation has hopefully no consequence for me personally. Aside from the possibility of a future war which could escalate out of control. Which is hopefully unlikely. And my preference to see a peaceful equitable resolution. The whole situation is interesting to me but my opinion is of no consequence.  When I look at Gaza and Israel really I don't know of any other modern developed country who has deliberately done anything comparable to this. And as the video says, where the majority of the population are so young. Who were born in this really desperate situation.  You need to look back through history to find such hopeless conditions imposed on a 'people'. In all honest this all seems all too reminiscent of what happened to the Jews of Warsaw in occupied Poland. I find it unsettling that the same 'people' who were subject to such brutal oppression could, within one lifetime, become the ones dehumanising another 'people' with such apparent antipathy. The Nazi's are remembered with utter revulsion for their behaviour. I wonder how people will remember contemporary Israel. Extremely unfavourably I expect. I have one Israeli friend but I think he is probably quite uncommon. He had to fake insanity to avoid the military draft and now lives in Ireland with his girlfriend.   The viewpoints I see on this sub are uncompromising and quite unashamedly aggressive. Even your response seeks to suggest some crappy rockets are somehow valid justification. As if this military obliteration of Gaza is somehow reasonable or justified or warranted by these piss poor rockets. It really seems to be a most ludicrous viewpoint. It's an unsustainable attitude which is not going unnoticed by the people around the world.   I wanted to see if /r/israel would talk about this and I wanted to see what justification or explanation might be offered but instead I've seen a series of offhand remarks and downvotes. Stuff about rockets. Nothing comparable. Which suggests to me that people really don't want to think about what happens over the wall and to the people of Gaza.   I struggle to understand how this can be rationalised by the average people in Israel. But I've not been exposed to your media and I've not witnessed your culture, so I can only form an opinion of what ordinary people really think based on the comments on a forum like this. It seems to me that this sub is an embarrassment. An insular and blinkered echo chamber which is incapable of grasping the thorny issues with any real honesty. Or perhaps it's a disturbing reflection of average opinion, I can only guess. One thing is certain. I wont be going to Israel any time soon. (or ever)  Incidentally, despite the claims of many people in this sub, the UK mainstream media, including the BBC are overwhelmingly favourable towards the Israeli position. They attempt balance and are immediately under attack from the Israel lobby and ""media watchdogs"". London politicians are pitifully obedient when it comes to Israel.  I would like to see the situation resolved but instead I expect Israel will seek some kind of gradual 'final solution'. Or maybe something more sudden. I read about Israeli politicians suggesting the utter annihilation of the entire Palestinian population. And then realise with horror that the same politician is subsequently appointed ""Justice minister"".  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayelet_Shaked  Or how about this guy.  http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/israelgaza-conflict-rightwing-israeli-politician-calls-for-gazans-to-be-concentrated-in-camps--and-then-all-resistance-exterminated-9649103.html  I think the problems would be solvable if there was a real desire to reach a solution. But instead I see word-games and weak justifications trotted out by a government (and a people it seems) who simply want everything their own way and quite literally do not care who dies in the process, or whose lives are ruined in the process. As long as the deaths are not 'their' people and not their children. It should make you more uncomfortable than it does me, because it is the people of Israel who will have to contend with the consequences of what is happening. I'm just an observer.  I read the posts on /r/israel and I often see claims of anti-Semitism or complaints of propaganda, people cry about being victimised. I think there is a tremendous desire to identify as victims. But ultimately you won't win the argument because your position is untenable. You cant fool all the people all the time.  The US and the UK and all of their support couldn't stop South Africa from the failure of Apartheid. America is now showing signs that it is losing patience. Bibi should never have given that speech to congress. (but really I'm glad he did)  I only hope the resolution to the situation comes without complete calamity to the world.  Sealbh math dhuit!"

We both know that isn't an honest representation of life in Gaza. Do a search for ""Life in Gaza"" on youtube. I wonder what you would see. You need to be quite determined to see it in such favourable terms.  And I was unaware of the snapchats from the west bank. But when I google, this is what I see as my first search result   http://mondoweiss.net/2015/07/snapchat-occupation-elephant  The comments are interesting as well.  And back in 2007 I met a guy from Serbia. He told me about how he was traumatised as a kid by seeing his elderly neighbours shot dead. They were trying to flee some troops by climbing over their garden wall. The memory stuck with him. He was probably early 20s when I met him.  And perhaps you are right that there were 'worse' atrocities committed in the Balkans. Where whole groups of people were rounded up and killed. With mass graves and executions.   But the people in Gaza have been killed in their thousands as well. Except they've been killed by the most sophisticated of military weaponry available. Precisely targeted by satellite guided bombs going into their shelters, their homes. With military spokesmen telling us it was an accident. Or that it was somehow a legitimate target. The rockets you showed me in those pictures are what I knew about already. Obviously dangerous but really only similar to hand grenades or a little stronger. You need to be very unlucky to be close enough. They cause damage, they can kill. But they're absolutely insignificant compared to the firepower that the US (and UK) gives to Israel. They're unguided for a start. So most of them do no damage to anything. Or they fail to detonate. There really is no comparison with the $50million fighter jets with bunker busting bombs and hellfire missiles. $50million tanks that can obliterate a house like playing a computer game. The latest drones and missiles and anything else that might help obliterate the infrastructure of the place. Making life intolerable. And the people of Gaza cannot escape. They're born in that place and they can't leave. And I am aware that Gaza is somewhere that you, as an Israeli, cannot go to see for yourself.   Honestly, I would prefer to take my chances being born in the Balkans than change places with someone born in Gaza.  At lease the Balkan conflict came to an end. At least they're free.  edit: also I noticed that some of those rocket photos are duplicates. for example this is the same hole.  http://i.imgur.com/BrPt8aQ.jpg   http://i.imgur.com/7uRah2u.jpg  And they're from 2006 to 2014.

So atleast according to this article (again I don't and I can't verify any of the info in it) the large majority of Israeli strikes don't have proper justification, most of these strikes seem like ""revenge"" for rockets that come in from the Gaza strip that rarely kill or hurt any civilians. Atleast IMHO none of these strikes are justified from either side.

On June 29, an Israeli airstrike killed a Hamas official. Hamas responded with wimpy short-range missiles that did no damage - kind of a ""back off"" message. Israel responded by killing more Hamas personnel - a clear ""bring it on"" message. And the war was on and 67 Israelis died.  It's interesting that your timeline conveniently doesn't go back quite that far.  The same thing happened in 2012, and most egregiously in 2008. Hamas respects ceasefire.

Israel has been attacking the people of Gaza continuously since at least 2007 in the form of the blockade, as well as countless other attacks. So if you take your logical leap, there hasn't been ceasefire for Gaza, or Hamas, to break. From time to time Gaza/Hamas have ceased, but Israel has continued to fire."
Israel,3ddh29,SayItLikeItIs,3,Thu Jul 16 12:40:37 2015 UTC,"Gaza != Hamas. There was an effective ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, which Israel broke.   Wrong. The ceasefire is between Gaza and Israel. Under the terms of the ceasefire, Israel holds Hamas responsible for all rockets coming from Gaza.  Do you honestly believe that Gaza can fire hundreds of rockets into Israel, but unless Hamas actively declares they fired them, the ceasefire is maintained, but if Israel responds to the rockets, it ""breaks"" the ceasefire?    But if you want to take the (completely unfounded) position that Gaza = Hamas and any attack ON Israel BY anyone in Gaza is an attack BY Hamas   ""Completely unfounded."" Time for an education.  Parameters of the Gaza cease fire: Hamas and other militant groups in Gaza agree to halt all rocket and mortar fire into Israel.  ALL rocket fire must stop. Not just the rockets fired by Hamas. If any rockets are fired, the terms of the cease-fire have been broken. Which, as the records states, they were.    From time to time Gaza/Hamas have ceased, but Israel has continued to fire.

December 20, 2014 to April 22, 2015 is one four-month-long example: no rockets from Gaza, yet the blockade continues. Gaza ceases, Israel fires.

OK, over here in reality, there WAS a ceasefire, and it had particular terms. One of those terms was that all rocket attacks stopped. Ending the blockade was NOT one of the terms.  So in reality, under the terms of the cease-fire agreement Israel and Hamas actually signed (not the one you dreamed up in your head), Hamas violated it and Israel didn't.   December 20, 2014 to April 22, 2015 is one four-month-long example: no rockets from Gaza, yet the blockade continues. Gaza ceases, Israel fires.   Again, continuing the blockade is not ""firing"", nor is it a violation of the cease-fire (according to reality). Gaza starts firing rockets in April 2015, violating the cease-fire. Fact."

And though Hamas might not have directly fired rockets during the prior 19 months, rockets from Gaza were a constant threat throughout 2014.   The point is that there was an effective 19-month ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, which Israel broke, leading to a war in which 67 Israelis died.  Israel continued to attack Palestinians (other than Hamas) throughout that period. A tiny minority of them attacked back. So there was no ceasefire between Israel and the Palestinians generally, only between Israel and Hamas."
Israel,3ddh29,SayItLikeItIs,5,Thu Jul 16 05:10:11 2015 UTC,"Israel has repeatedly stated that they hold Hamas, as the purported governing body of Gaza, responsible for all attacks that originate from the territory. As you can see from the year after the war (September through May, at least) you can see that Hamas can indeed control when rockets are being fired or not, even if they are not directly participating.   The point is that there was an effective 19-month ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, which Israel broke, leading to a war in which 67 Israelis died.   Unless of course you hold the easily defensible position that the kidnapping of the three teens by Hamas operatives was in itself an attack by Hamas, thus breaking the ceasefire themselves.  Or the previous opinion, that since Hamas controls the Gaza Strip, every rocket fired is in itself a violation of the ceasefire, whether Hamas does it themselves or not.   Especially when the text of the ceasefire in 2012 states plainly that rockets attacks from all Palestinian factions, will cease."
Israel,3ddh29,DiamondMind28,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:25:11 2015 UTC,"Whether Hamas is responsible for the actions of all Palestinians, or all Palestinians in Gaza, is an interesting question. Israel making that claim doesn't make it so, and I'm not aware of any legal precedent for holding a government responsible for the actions of everyone it governs.  But if you want to take that (rather bizarre) view, fine. If an attack BY any Palestinian in Gaza is an attack by Hamas, then an attack ON any Palestinian in Gaza must similarly be an attack on Hamas. Israel has been attacking the Palestinians in Gaza relentlessly since 2007, most egregiously with the blockade, but also with countless other assaults. So there has been no ceasefire for Hamas/the Palestinians in Gaza to break. In fact there have been periods when the Gazans have entirely ceased, but Israel has continued to fire, at least by maintaining the blockade.  Just to be clear, I am not making any statements about the rightness or wrongness of any of these attacks. For the record, my opinion is that they're ALL wrong, and I judge their relative wrongness only on the amount of damage they cause. But that's not the question here."

I suggest you read the link above to understand the cease-fire before you start trying to spin it so that Israel is always at fault.   Just because a document says ""ceasefire"" at the top doesn't make it a ceasefire. A ceasefire is when all sides stop attacking. Since a blockade is an attack, and Israel is continuing the blockade, there has been no real ceasefire.  I haven't seen the actual document, just reports on it in the media, so I don't actually know if it says ""ceasefire"" at the top, or if it's just been (inaccurately) called that.  But let's look at that agreement. There were five parties to it (or more, depending on how you count). Which have them have complied with it?   Hamas to stop rocket and mortar fire into Israel: yes Other military groups in Gaza to stop rocket and mortar fire into Israel: not completely Israel to stop airstrikes and ground operations, open border crossings, narrow security buffer, extend fishing limit.

It's one of the ironies of Israeli policy that the HAMAS security forces, the main tool preventing rocket attacks from splinter groups, are perennially attacked by Israel, as a supposed response to rocket attacks from splinter groups.  But to return to your double standard, you hold HAMAS responsible for anything that goes on in the Gaza strip, including attacks that are committed by criminals with no relationship with HAMAS, but refuse to hold Israel responsible for anything that goes on in Israel, because that would reveal the logical incoherency of your pseduo-Weberian argument.

Meanwhile, Israel's promise to facilitate freedom of movement and the transfer of goods within Gaza has been reneged upon continuously since the signing of the truce.  This follows a familiar pattern in which a previous ceasefire agreement, brokered by Egypt in 2008, was ended by Israel's extrajudicial assassinations of Palestinians.  https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/articles/middle-east/12758-israel-not-hamas-is-the-serial-truce-breaker-"
Israel,3ddh29,PalestineFacts,-11,Wed Jul 15 19:52:49 2015 UTC,"There seems to be a misunderstanding here. We first must define what you mean by ""ceasefire."" In Palestine when a ceasefire is reached, the aggressions y the Israelis never cease. Palestinians still are under a belligerent Israeli military occupation and a blockade imposed on the entire population. Those are both acts of war, both aggressions. The Palestinians were still facing the mass destruction imposed on Gaza by Israel and many had nowhere to go. There are also many different factions taking part in the fighting, and not only Hamas. Thus, it's disingenuous to assume that rockets were all fired by Hamas.  Hamas was never consulted for the July 15 ceasefire.  Israel never asserted that Hamas broke the July 17 ceasefire, but rather after the 5 hour cease ended, Israel launched her ground invasion which only escalated hostilities.   The July 20 ceasefire was restricted to just one region in Gaza. Supposedly Hamas fired at Israeli soldiers, according to the IDF spokesperson, but we have no way to confirm this. There were hundreds fleeing the neighborhood that Israel destroyed. Israel was still bombarding the rest of Gaza with heavy artillery shells and entering the North of Gaza with tanks the same day.  Israel then rejected Kerry's proposal for a long-term ceasefire on July 25.  The July 26-28 ceasefire was actually maintained. Find me a source that says otherwise. On July 28 an Israeli attack killed 10 Palestinians in a park in Gaza.   The 4 hour ceasefire in July 30 was not really a ceasfire. Israel said the cease would ""not apply to the areas in which IDF soldiers are currently operating."" So basically war raged on and nobody really considered this a ceasefire.  August 1 Hamas denied breaking the ceasefire (denied firing rockets) and Israel continued into the Gaza Strip over a kidnapped soldier. 70 Palestinians were killed this day.  What we have to recognize is that on days that a ceasefire was occurring, Palestinian casualties still continued. There was never really a cease in Palestinian casualties despite a ceasefire.   I'm not going to go through every single one of them, but this info graphic gives a distorted view of the reality. There were no two equal sides in this fighting. Palestinian society in Gaza had collapsed from the Israeli attacks. They were facing huge destruction of sometimes entire neighborhoods. Even if a ceasefire was broke the response was unjustified and blatantly killed civilians or targeted their homes."

Most Americans are either apathetic towards the Arab world, or harbor negative feelings towards it (because of Arab terrorism in the past or Arab opposition to the American military presence in the Middle East).

Israel,3ddg12,nrocp0p,14,Wed Jul 15 12:22:07 2015 UTC,"As I pointed out elsewhere, there's a certain positive aspect to this: the latest attacks were all either ambushes inside West Bank, attacks against soldiers at checkpoints, or attacks by Palestinian workers inside Israel. There have been no major organized attacks against Israeli civilians inside Israel for years. Why is this good?   They hijacked airplanes, we instituted best flight security in the world. No more plane hijackings. They hijacked ships, now we have a booming security business, no more ship hijackings. They hijacked buses and held hostages, we worked out the force approach to deal with it. No more hostage situations. They carried out suicide bombings, we set up the fences and checkpoints. No more suicide bombings. They carried out shooting attacks inside Israel, Shin Bet developed doctrines to prevent them. No more shooting attacks in Israel. They fired rockets at us, we developed the Iron Dome, and using the massive amounts of field intelligence wiped out the rocket stocks in Gaza - twice. As a result, no more rocket attacks. They tried the tunnels to carry out attacks and kidnappings, IDF found and destroyed them, and now has developed preventive countermeasures and protocols. In the next wars effects of tunnels would be minimized. There's not going to be another Gilad Shalit. They tried to go through the sea and land on the shore. You've probably seen the video documenting the failure.   In simple words, Palestinian terrorists have run out of violent strategies. There is literally nothing else they can invent. In each instance, there's at least one strong layer of separation between them and Israeli civilians. I suspect that by and at large, this show is over. The only remaining tool at their disposal is attacks against Israelis abroad - and the last Iran sponsored attempts have been by every evaluation botched."

Hadrian, being angry with the Jews, attempted to erase any trace of our history in the Land by calling it using the name of our historical enemies, the Philistines (who were seemingly invaders of Mycenean, as in Greek, origin).  Thus, Palestine was never a nation nor even an independent region, it was always a provincial term for an area ruled by the various empires that controlled it. The Arabs who today call themselves Palestinians cannot trace any sort of historic independence or nationhood, the only thing uniting them recently being opposition to Jewish resurgence. It's funny that they call themselves using a Hebrew, Biblical name.  Israel will do whatever is in its best interest, up to and including maintaining control over Judea and Samaria. Political recognition wouldn't change a thing when it comes to maintaining our security.  Also, I'm not religious."

The second is the current conflict between various proxies in Syria, Iraq, Yemen and elsewhere.  Suffice to say anyone not living in the Middle East cares far more about the first issue than taking sides in the second.  When these proxy wars are raging around or in your borders, that issue is of greater importance.  Still, I don't think there's any sense in lamenting the world powers looking out for their own interests and priorities even when that differs from Israel's priorities.  That's like complaining that water is wet.  And I think the smarter heads in Israeli politics recognize that.    They also recognize though that it's easier to complain about global issues than it is to actually address Israel's many domestic problems though."
Israel,3dcw6a,CupOfCanada,2,Wed Jul 15 18:11:21 2015 UTC,"It depends on how you view it.  There's a Sunni v Shia proxy war going on in the region, with Iran as the principle backer of the Shia side, and Saudi Arabia as the principle backer on the Sunni side.  The US has conflicting loyalties in this - they've somehow managed to get themselves on both sides of the same war."
Israel,3dcw6a,CupOfCanada,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:36:17 2015 UTC,"It's becoming Sunni (fighting to purify Islam) vs Shia, Kurds, Christians and Druze (fighting for their existence)  One side is definitely wrong while the other has absolutely no choice."
Israel,3dcw6a,umakemefunny,3,Wed Jul 15 17:43:34 2015 UTC,"It's more complex than that though.  Israeli is generally aligned with the Sunni Bloc, as are Christians in Lebanon. And ISIS is its own special kind of crazy."

Iran and Hamas won't last long, Qatar is deep with Turkey and Qatar, borderline rivals to Iran. Most Hamas leaders support the Syrian rebel terror groups, Iran will leave them hangin."

Israel,3dcw6a,CupOfCanada,3,Wed Jul 15 07:48:56 2015 UTC,"Right now Iran can construct a nuke within about 3 months.  This pushes that back to ~12 months.  What this gives Israel and the rest of the world is some (12 months) advanced notice if Iran decides to actually build a nuclear weapon.  Now, what you do with that warning is an issue in and of itself.  Iran has proven more responsive to diplomatic/economic pressure than North Korea, so the hope is that they will never cross that line.  After all, if Iran had wanted to, they could have already produced a weapon by now.  At the same time, when North Korea made its move, the world had plenty of notice and did sweet crap all about it."
Israel,3dcw6a,kkk_is_bad,2,Wed Jul 15 08:08:36 2015 UTC,"After all, if Iran had wanted to, they could have already produced a weapon by now.   exactly! but to iran it's like: we can get the bomb now or we can ostensibly wait a bit longer and get some huge bread to advance our hegemony while being the leading export of proxy terror. this deal literally allows them that strategic boost they would want along with the bomb."
Israel,3dcw6a,CupOfCanada,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:13:38 2015 UTC,"Well, the sanctions went in place because of their nuclear program in the first place, so that would be a rather circular plan.  What a nuclear weapon would get for Iran that they don't already have is protection from a US invasion.  The US was rather invasion-happy a few years back (now they're just drone-assassination happy).  Trying to get a nuclear weapon also increases the risk of said invasion though...  But yah, meanwhile the proxy war continues."

Because the current administration is an idealistic one, who likes to believe the best in people. And when it doesn't believe the best in people, it sits back and does nothing. First case to explain that point is support for the Arab Spring, second is lack of support for any side in Syria. The administration thinks any inspectors will do, I suppose. Which is their determination, and the determination of the rest of the P5+1, to make."

Current retail prices in Israel put it around 3,350 shekels, or a 20% markup, which is ridiculous.  Or you can get your friend on a US trip to pay about $600 after sales tax * 3.8 is 2,280 shekels.

Israel,3dcr2f,matanc1,2,Wed Jul 15 13:10:26 2015 UTC,"הרבה מקומות עושים את זה לאחרונה. לדוגמא בורגוס, מייק'ס פלייס ונאפיס הם המקומות האחרונים שאני זוכר שראיתי בהם כאלה תפריטים, ואני לא יוצא הרבה למסעדות ככה שזו תמונת מצב מאוד חלקית.  אני לא מתלהב מזה כל-כך. זה נראה לי די מסורבל. גם כן רוב האפליקציות האלה לא מציעות איזשהו יתרון על-פני טקסט כתוב, מלבד העובדה שזה מאוד מקל על בית העסק לשנות מחירים מתי שבא לו, זמין בכמה שפות ומקל על הקריאה בתאורה חלשה שדי נפוצה במקומות בילוי בארץ.  הייתי שמח לאפשרות לעשות את ההזמנה אשכרה דרך האייפד, וגם לראות בזמן אמת את המחיר שנצטרך לשלם בסוף, יחד עם חישוב של הטיפ."
