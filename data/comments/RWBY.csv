RWBY,3e2ccm,Nielsthomas1,11,Tue Jul 21 12:34:39 2015 UTC,i feel the same way. I am bothering all of my engineering friends now XD
RWBY,3e2ccm,tanithghost88,4,Tue Jul 21 12:35:19 2015 UTC,Oh trust me. I have spent many a long night trying to figure out how it can actually be done.   Coco's is bullshit hammer space.  When I get back to classes I am gonna try to find time in CAD to do some work.
RWBY,3e2ccm,Spartacus400,6,Tue Jul 21 14:34:30 2015 UTC,"I mean, Coco's weapon breaks physics in how it's stored.  You can't fit that much stuff in that little space.    That being said, basically every other weapon is possible to recreate in some capacity."
RWBY,3e2ccm,lolredditor,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:19:06 2015 UTC,"Actually it is possible.  Each section of the barrels would be a bit shorter than the case, and then you would have to either have each subsequent barrel be smaller or larger so that they could slide into each other(the interior of the barrel is a different design challenge that cosplayers don't need to be worried about).  Then the barrels cylinder only takes up about a third to half of the case, so the rest would be used to store an expanding circular ammo case - the case would be mostly hollow, just allowing densely compacted bullets to spread out to be more easily fed.  So considering that purpose, the ammo area can fold up multiple times - probably in an overlapping fashion as well.  The main issue is the way they expand the case in the show is just this yellow bulge expanding out the bottom.  Obviously we don't have nanobot construction technology and don't want our bottom to be a sponge material, so there would have to be folding/sliding and locking parts."
RWBY,3e2ccm,Spartacus400,2,Tue Jul 21 17:18:26 2015 UTC,"Real life, it can be done.  Though, it won't be functioning.  I'm talking in the show, it breaks physics.  All the mechanics that go into it can't all fit together like that."
RWBY,3e2ccm,lolredditor,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:12:51 2015 UTC,"All of them break physics - they use magic rockets for added power.  The hinges would break.  What I'm saying is that we can build a collapsible barrel and circular ammo cartridge that can fit in a briefcase that has similar proportions.  Sorry that I misunderstood your statement though, I thought you were saying that the briefcase was like the Dr. Who TARDIS.  Yes, magical items in a show about magic wielding combatants break physics, agreed."
RWBY,3e2ccm,yangxiaodong,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:00:22 2015 UTC,"No, it would work. A gyrojet like mechanism where the barrels arent under the same pressure that a gun would be under for ammunition, titanium/tempered steel parts for the rest, bam."
RWBY,3e2ccm,Spartacus400,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:11:24 2015 UTC,"S'all good.  And quite honestly, it would still be pretty impressive to build Coco's minigun."
RWBY,3e2ccm,Desparoto,2,Tue Jul 21 19:15:36 2015 UTC,"If you have collapsing barrels (witch is not possible because the interior needs to be 1 solid piece) they would not be able to withstand the force of the bullet being fired. other complications arise in, where are you going to put the motor, power supply, and action. plus how will you collapse the ammo drum with the ammo in it.  <rant> really the whole setup adds way to much complexity. to meany points of possible failure witch would render the weapon useless. she would be better off with a regular LMG. weapon don't just need to be usable/possible. they need to be practical as well.  by the time you got something like Cocos gun working you could have mass produced hundreds of regular miniguns (or thousands of LMGs). all of witch serve the purpose better than foldie-uppie handbag gun.  Really all the weapons in RWBY are a complete disaster (when judged from a realistic/practical standpoint) with the only exception being Jauns sword (even though its design would render it unusable as well. the whole damn thing is to frelling large) </rant>  but in the end who cares i don't watch this show for realistic weapons/fighting i watch it because its awesome. and i don't want to see realism added. even though i prefer realism in weapons.  if your gonna go insane may as well go all the way right."
RWBY,3e2ccm,lolredditor,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:16:32 2015 UTC,"Well yeah, Any of the weapons with hinges at all would likely break at said hinges.  What I'm saying isn't that we're building a working prototype, but that we can fit all those pieces reasonably in a large briefcase."

RWBY,3e2ccm,tanithghost88,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:55:27 2015 UTC,Hey technically if the ammo is defining the weapon most pistols can get shotshell-like rounds.  I have seen .22 caliber shotshell. I didnt understand the purpose. But then I saw it in .45.   I dont even.
RWBY,3e2ccm,Cmndr_Duke,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:59:38 2015 UTC,"Nah ,  we basically get no small sidearms , just certain rifles and most shotguns.  Alas such is life.  But we can have muzzle loading sidearms!  (Pistols are guns with barrels shorter than 30cm if I remember right according to law)"
RWBY,3e2ccm,tanithghost88,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:05:29 2015 UTC,Yeah but muzzle loading can be dangerous.   Last year I was shooting at a public govt ran range. Guy came up and asked to use the other lane. We said sure. He took a long time to load. Fired once. Loaded again then stopped. He got us and stated that he had a misfire and that it might be an issue. He ended up just safely unloading it and leaving. Good guy.   Owning guns isn't that great. I got a lot of history and they 're fun and all..... But I don't get to go shoot often.

IMO, Ren is the weakest part of team JNPR, he couldn't break the skin of the King Tai Ji Tu with his weapon and He got smashed into a wall by the Deathstalker. During the food fight he was first taken out by slippery ketchup, and then when fighting Yang he didn't land a single hit. Jaune took out two Ursa Major, the first, with a little help from Pyrrha in a single hit, the second, alone with a little training from Pyrrha. Jaune is a badass in training."

I really like color effect at the opening it fit the music. You just threw fight scenes together and put music over it, which isn't necessarily bad, there is just no themeing to it to mach the song.  the flippy cuts between scenes didn't make a whole lot of sense because of this though, and just felt distracting. The real problem I have is that the music is out of sync with the fights, punches and strikes should be landing on the bass beats, I'm pretty sure this never happened. It feels like I'm listening to a song over a muted scene, and is just distracting, and makes me want to shut one of the two off."

Weiss does not approve of Misha's antics, yes, Yang, I'm sure Andy had fabulous hair, but a 90mm round can change all that. It gets a lot stranger than Gogg, Ruby. A LOT stranger. A cloak would indeed not move in zero G unless there is Dramatic Wind (TM), and Gundamn it, Yang, couldn't you have done that before they started?

RWBY,3e3mdj,Wingnut00,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:50:16 2015 UTC,"I chose 0080 for two reasons:  1) It's short enough of an OVA to have only a few chapters.  2) The story is easily one of the better ones of the UC.

SO MUCH YES.  ~Le Critique~ //Begins swirling glass of Port  Linework is smooth, nice bright bright colours and shading that suggests form very well.  Outfit designs are colourful and slick, nicely feminised and still tasteful.  Poses and expressions convey the character's ""feel"" very well, Jeanne looks very passionate and ... uh... Renae? looks very cool and calm. (Which is actually quite an interesting juxtaposition)  I don't really have any criticism.   I get a 90's manga vibe from the piece, If that's what you are going for then you've pretty much nailed it.   I daresay if you wanted to delve into the world of semi-realism, you could do so fairly easily by doing slightly more realistic facial features, blending the shading a tad more and working the line into the shading so you have contrast suggesting edges rather than line. Again, just a suggestion if you want to :)  Anyway, awesome work! Keep at it! :D"

RWBY,3e0v55,thebluehedgehog,2,Tue Jul 21 02:48:17 2015 UTC,"Context is a Mr. and Mrs. Smith scenario.  So I just took what I knew about how they spoke and acted, twisted them into non-mortal enemies, and wrote a few lines.  I assume Weiss learned ""Some Horrific Truth"" about Schnee Dust that she couldn't ignore.  She became consumed by her need to clear her name and got twisted into anger, then rage.  Getting no satisfaction or assistance from her teammates she struck out on her own.  I assume she then did ""Some Horrific Thing That Seemed Justified At The Time"" that hurt Ruby personally.  Since it's a Mr. and Mrs. Smith scenario it follows logically that they're in love, so Ruby took it hard, hence ""I hate you I hate you"" and Weiss' initial tenderness.  From Weiss' point of view, Ruby just ""Doesn't Understand"" and ""Is Trying To Stop Her From Doing What She Must.""  In addition, by refusing to help, Ruby has possibly betrayed Weiss from Weiss' point of view.  Hence when Ruby tries to speak up, Weiss slaps the shit out of her.

RWBY,3e153v,OldSchoolVinny,2,Tue Jul 21 05:05:47 2015 UTC,"I can see a ""new beginning"" happening by flash forwarding to a different year in Beacon once the first major arc villians are defeated.   Like say after volume 5, the White Fang have officially disbanded and Cinder is forced back into hiding, meaning the world is now peaceful once again, you cut to RWBY in their Junior year and introduce a new major villain for the next several volumes."
RWBY,3e153v,thebluehedgehog,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:50:26 2015 UTC,"A war breaks out and everyone is sent home. The Beacon students, at least first years, are viewed like children instead of possible soldiers so they restart/continue/resume their schooling as though they never left their home. Yang and Ruby would likely be on Patch, even if there is no higher education hunter school there; they might be tutored by Qrow or Taiyang if those two escape the draft and likely take the place of Signal teachers that were sent into the war or went back to other kingdoms. Weiss would go to Atlas, Pyrrha to Mintral. If Beacon had enough faculty left to teach the Vale people would remain for the most part, such as Jaune and Cardin. Nora and Ren would have to choose to stay and be conscripted, go home to the village and guard it (and possibly have to volunteer for military school/training when quotas from settlements start up). Blake would fight to stay at Beacon, but if it closed end up a petty thief, living on the streets and squatting in abandoned buildings unwilling to fight someone else's war and with no where to go."
RWBY,3e153v,IamMenace,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:19:50 2015 UTC,"Honestly I'd probably drop the school stuff and keep the rest the same as much as possible.  Team RWBY could still get together through happenstance where Weiss is tasked with stopping the White Fang or losing her status as heiress, Blake wishes to stop them due to knowing what they are capable of, and Ruby and Yang join them due to Cinder/Torchwick nearly killing Ruby in the beginning.  Ozpin could set this all up of course but not as a teacher, instead as a leader of the huntsmen.  Minor teams like JNPR would have more of a background role meant to support team RWBY.  To be fair this only stems from curiosity of what the plot could have been and the lackluster reception Beacon got in the beginning.  The only way I could see anything like this happening is if RWBY flopped and someone at RT didn't want to see it die and tried to start over.  Changes I don't want are probably ones that stop RWBY from being RWBY.  Nothing really comes to mind.    The most significant changes I want from RWBY is for the tone of the show to match the music, more atmosphere like the Red and White Trailers, and for the school setting to be eventually dropped and the characters travel more.  Any other changes just come from nitpicking, but those I feel would make parts of the show stronger.  God bless"

RWBY,3e153v,IamMenace,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:24:01 2015 UTC,"I like this too but I'd be lying if I said the school setting thrills me much.  Personally I'd like them to find other ways to give exposition, and to be fair I don't feel like they've really needed it to tell the story so far.  The show just feels like it moves quicker to me when it's away from the school and classroom setting.  Just my opinion though.  God bless"

RWBY,3dyqld,JesterSeraph,4,Mon Jul 20 16:55:50 2015 UTC,"Songs are not canon.   Jeff Williams is basically making a fanwork as he is given little information beyond the show itself, if any.  EDIT: Feel free to have your fun and potatoes, just keep in mind you can't back up any potatoes with a song."
RWBY,3dyqld,thebluehedgehog,2,Mon Jul 20 17:14:03 2015 UTC,"Can I ask if there's a source where someone States that songs aren't canon or something similar to that? Like maybe something official from Jeff Williams or Miles or anyone involved with the show. Only two songs are likely canon in my opinion, those are Red Like Roses and Red like Roses part II. Jeff Williams created the song about Ruby's relationship with her mother Summer Rose and expands on their relationship showing Summer's guilt for leaving her daughter in favour of becoming a huntress and also Part II focuses on Ruby discovering her mother's death. The song says ""but baby please don't do what I did. I don't want you to waste you life in vain"" which alludes to the idea that Summer doesn't want Ruby to become a huntress. What backs this up is that the song plays during the red trailer when Ruby visits her mother's grave on the cliffside alter. Some of what the song says is backed up when Yang and Blake have the talk of Yang's past in Volume 2."
RWBY,3dyqld,TheDanime,2,Mon Jul 20 17:44:01 2015 UTC,"I don't have a direct source, though I would like one. But all the show has at any given point before the script is finished is an outline. So all Jeff has had to work with at all is tid bits of information. The staff has also displayed a habit of keeping other producers like the voice actors in the dark about certain aspects of the show like Blake being a faunus (source: RT Ladies podcast)."

RWBY,3dyqld,Eldi13,3,Tue Jul 21 01:51:54 2015 UTC,"I've always imagined the song ""Gold"" in the soundtrack being either from Yang to Ruby or from Summer Rose to Ruby. (Summer Rose being Ruby's deceased mom)"
RWBY,3dyqld,IamMenace,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:23:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I definitely see it as Yang to Ruby."
RWBY,3dyqld,Nurple17,4,Tue Jul 21 01:47:35 2015 UTC,"I always kind of saw it as the people of Remnant in general but an emphasis on team RWBY.  Technically the song is canon since Ruby was listening to it in the dust shop but I know a lot of shows do that as a fourth wall joke. Monty worked very closely with Jeff on all of the songs (Minus Red Like Roses) so the themes and tone were all approved by him but Jeff generally is kept in the dark, which I don't exactly agree with.  Personally I love all the songs and want the show to match their tone next season.  Red Like Roses Part 2 is one of my favorites and want to see more of relationship between Ruby and Summer. In my opinion the music either needs to match the show or the show needs to start matching the music.  (Edit: Spelling)  God bless"
RWBY,3dyqld,IamMenace,3,Mon Jul 20 18:03:22 2015 UTC,"I agree with you mostly. Though really, that goes for most artists though. I doubt that someone like Hiroyuki Sawano, who did the music for Kill la Kill and Attack on Titan, would've known exactly how their compositions were going to be used. Unfortunately, Jeff Williams kind of falls into that category as well.  ""Make a battle theme.""  ""We're introducing a character/team here.""  ""The intro.""  ""Closing with credits.""  They may come up with something like "" we want to use this to set the tone for this scene that goes from ""SUPER HAPPY FUN FUN TIME"" to reverent/serious. From there, usually an artist has just enough to go on to compose something."
RWBY,3dyqld,Vexzal,3,Mon Jul 20 21:43:06 2015 UTC,"I agree with you, it's just that RWBY isn't like those other shows and the music really feels more alive.  How many theories have come from the songs alone compared to other shows?  The music feels like it's actually a part of the show/world and I want it to match the show more.  Jeff feels just as much a part of the show to me as the animators and writers, maybe even more when I look at my playlist count for both Volume's soundtracks.  I don't expect him to actually come up with ideas or write the show, but I would like the show to match the songs more, Red Like Roses Part 2 for example.  God bless"
RWBY,3dyqld,muldoonx9,2,Mon Jul 20 22:06:50 2015 UTC,"This will be the day, and Time to say goodbye really, sound more like a third person narrator. As blue pointed out the songs aren't cannon, Jeff has very little to go on when making these. One of the first things we got told was done about volume three was the opening, this being done only after a few episodes were actually written. The openings are very vague and really only convey general themes."
RWBY,3dyqld,IamMenace,2,Mon Jul 20 17:20:10 2015 UTC,"Here's my thoughts on the song (funny at first and serious at the end):  ""Surprise when they find out that a warrior will soon run wild.""  PYROS HIT  Ruby runs out of the entrance. Crowd goes crazy.  Cole: ""Oh my, what's Ruby Rose doing here?""  JBL: ""We're in for a real treat Maggle, she was one of the premier Superstars at Signal Championship Wrestling. She's gonna be a force to reckon with her devastating finisher she calls Crescent Rose!""  Honestly I think most of the songs are sick wrestling intros, so that colors my perception of them. The song seems like something angsty a wrestler would write about themselves in a notebook. In this case, it's Ruby thinking about debuting at Beacon. You can see her fantastical and heroic views of being a huntress in the lyrics."

RWBY,3e0ji5,FireDash1231,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:07:32 2015 UTC,"I believe so.    This was atop the blackboard in Burning the Candle, and it's the same board that Yang drew Qrow's symbol on.  So, while it might not be explicitly confirmed, I don't think that Miles and Kerry would do something like that for no reason.  And since Raven is most likely Qrow's sister, it would make sense for them to be Hugin and Munin.    There may have been other sources of confirmation elsewhere that I don't know about.  I haven't really watched the podcasts/any of the extra stuff outside of the WORs."
RWBY,3e0ji5,Spartacus400,2,Tue Jul 21 04:18:24 2015 UTC,"Miles and Kerry   That would be an artistic decision, and by extension a directorial one. If anyone put that there, I'd be willing to bet it was Monty."
RWBY,3e0ji5,Vexzal,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:02:16 2015 UTC,"That makes it even more likely that Qrow is based off one of the ravens.  As well as Raven herself, if she is Qrow's sister.  Monty never did anything with no purpose."

RWBY,3e0ji5,Spartacus400,2,Tue Jul 21 05:21:14 2015 UTC,"Characters can have more than one basis.   Port is based off Peter and the Wolf and Mario, Oobleck is based off Bartholomew and the Oobleck and Luigi.  Meanwhile Qrow is already the Scarecrow from wizard of Oz along with being Hugin/Munin. And also seems to take a few cues from the Grim Reaper...     In any case, while the main characters seem to draw mostly from a single source for their basis, that restriction does not seem to be in place for the older characters."
RWBY,3e0ji5,TheWanderingCactus,2,Tue Jul 21 13:54:38 2015 UTC,I know we didn't even meet this character yet...   Which means that he's no better or worse off than he was at the start of the show due to being a mentor character.

RWBY,3e0ji5,Nurple17,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:09:46 2015 UTC,"Did we forget that the characters are only designed after other characters from other stories, and not their actual background?"
RWBY,3e0ji5,DevonianDino,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:45:51 2015 UTC,"Well, there's also the possibility of Qrow and Raven being a reference to the Sun Crows from Chinese mythology.   In which there were 10 sun crows, all siblings, who went across the world one day at a time. One day they all decided to all go at once, scorched planet earth, and all but one of them was promptly killed by an archer. Perhaps Qrow and Raven have 8 other siblings and all but one of them is going to die.     The only confirmed basis for the character is his role as the scarecrow in the teacher's overarching Wizard of Oz reference; suggesting that Qrow could be some kind of tactician or other form of intellectual for Ozpin's group.     Even disregarding any character origins Qrow's still in danger simply from his role in the story. Qrow is the mentor to the main character, the one who taught her everything she knows; this, Qrow has a giant target hanging over his head due to mentor occupational hazard (Warning, links to Tv Tropes).  Not to mention Qrow has already been shown acting as a protector to Ruby and Yang. The most likely outcome is that he'll eventually die, directly saving Ruby and/or Yang from a villain.     Given his role as a spy, I like to think he'd be crazy prepared enough to leave letters for everyone he was close to should he kick the bucket.  His letter's to Ruby and Yang would probably go on about how he's proud of them and they're gonna do great things.  The one addressed to Oz would likely detail all the files and data he had on their enemy and be mostly professional until the very end of the note, where he gives a personal message telling Oz to not lose hope and keep on fighting.  I'd really like this idea to happen, primarily because of his letter to Taiyang. Tai would have, at this point, lost all three members of his team and pretty much be breaking down when he hears the news, it'd be really nice to see Qrow's letter tell Tai about a promise he made Summer years ago to look after Ruby, Yang and him; and say that he was happy to die keeping promise, before saying goodbye to his oldest friend.     Damnit, now I have to go write a fanfic for this..."

RWBY,3dvhwt,standrew5998,2,Sun Jul 19 22:27:35 2015 UTC,"You are not mistaken, though we are not yet strong enough to sink the ships that matter.  one day..."
RWBY,3dvhwt,thebluehedgehog,2,Mon Jul 20 01:34:36 2015 UTC,A mountain can be moved a pebble at a time.  You can get a lot more pebbles moved by chipping away at the bottom of a mountain than the top of an anthill.
RWBY,3dvhwt,standrew5998,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:45:23 2015 UTC,Yep. And also I haven't really ever started a war...too worried I'd lose. If I'm gonna start a shipping war I wanna make sure I'm gonna win.
RWBY,3dvhwt,thebluehedgehog,2,Mon Jul 20 02:05:44 2015 UTC,"Oh? You won't get far that way. The easiest way to find supporters is to start posting little comments that ignore the popular ships, like the one which started this conversation."
RWBY,3dvhwt,standrew5998,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:58:04 2015 UTC,Yeah. Tbh I'm not paying too much attention. Working on a commission.
RWBY,3dvhwt,ToTheNintieth,3,Mon Jul 20 03:01:14 2015 UTC,Hear hear. Arkos doesn't count it's practically canon.
RWBY,3dvhwt,Pantscada,4,Mon Jul 20 04:10:47 2015 UTC,"As a monochrome shipper, I agree."
RWBY,3dvhwt,ProbablyHeretical,8,Sun Jul 19 22:20:13 2015 UTC,"As a person who ships everything, I say fuck that noise."
RWBY,3dvhwt,Pantscada,3,Sun Jul 19 22:21:48 2015 UTC,And I thought I was the heretic. Surely one who ships everything ships nothing?
RWBY,3dvhwt,ProbablyHeretical,7,Sun Jul 19 22:23:43 2015 UTC,"What kind of thinking is that. I like all ships.  You see this? I ship everything on it. Hell, I ship everything that's not on it as well."
RWBY,3dvhwt,Pantscada,2,Sun Jul 19 22:25:30 2015 UTC,"Hmmm. I don't know how to feel about this. You ship monochrome, but also white rose? I'll keep my eye on you..."
RWBY,3dvhwt,ProbablyHeretical,3,Sun Jul 19 22:29:23 2015 UTC,"Yes, keep an eye on the sub asshat. That'll be a good use of your time."

RWBY,3dvhwt,ZurichianAnimations,2,Sun Jul 19 22:01:13 2015 UTC,Haha this is adorable. Not sure how long Yang's going to live though.
RWBY,3dvhwt,trinitynox,3,Sun Jul 19 21:50:14 2015 UTC,Awwwww I wanna pet Neo~   It probably won't end well for me but i still wanna pet her~
RWBY,3dvhwt,soundwaveprime,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:36:37 2015 UTC,Yeah I agree just as a precaution wear stab proof plating... Although her kick looks fatal enough.
RWBY,3dvhwt,trinitynox,2,Mon Jul 20 00:32:57 2015 UTC,Who's to say her heels aren't sharp and hard enough to pierce the plating?
RWBY,3dvhwt,soundwaveprime,2,Mon Jul 20 02:34:52 2015 UTC,...well being killed by an attractive girl is on my list of approved deaths.
RWBY,3dvhwt,Cmndr_Duke,2,Mon Jul 20 02:55:39 2015 UTC,Can I see this list?
RWBY,3dvhwt,soundwaveprime,2,Mon Jul 20 15:27:36 2015 UTC,"I mostly keep it in my head but sure:   being killed by an attractive girl(exception is if they were stringing me along for the purpose of getting me to lower my gaurd that will just bring up bad memories and piss me off) 1 on ? gun fight with a drug cartel( this is my plan to deal with any terminal illness)  blaze of glory(I literally mean blaze of glory) saving someone doing research, I have a deep fascination with inter-dimensional transportation and if I ever get funding or equipment will probably use my self as a test subject. pushed into a volcano I guess peacefully in my sleep will be expected but after almost suffocating during sleep paralysis I don't like the idea of dying in my sleep. doing something fun. heart attack from drinking to much coffee.   I use to be exetremly depressed and though about this stuff a lot, any other epic death that I can not think of at the moment may be approved, any unatrual death that is not approved will result in me haunting their ass till the end of their days."
RWBY,3dvhwt,Cmndr_Duke,2,Mon Jul 20 15:42:42 2015 UTC,"Soo a badass fight with a hot chick ,whom runs a cartel ,in a volcano to save a orphanage full of kittens. while on fire (blaze of glory) and after killing the cartel and saving them all you have a heart attack from coffee.  Is the best?  EDIT: rereading that. sounds like a great book."
RWBY,3dvhwt,soundwaveprime,2,Mon Jul 20 15:46:52 2015 UTC,"Hell yeah that sounds right, also that does sound like an epic story."
RWBY,3dvhwt,Okhlahoma_Beat-Down,2,Mon Jul 20 15:55:54 2015 UTC,"That's pretty fuckin' kinky, mate."
RWBY,3dvhwt,soundwaveprime,2,Mon Jul 20 17:22:15 2015 UTC,"hehe well they say find what you love and let it kill you, although I don't think they meant it as literal as I'm taking it."
RWBY,3dvhwt,Okhlahoma_Beat-Down,2,Mon Jul 20 17:27:46 2015 UTC,Then it's a fuckin' shame I love guns.
RWBY,3dvhwt,soundwaveprime,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:32:07 2015 UTC,"yeah that is a shame, although I'm sure there is an interesting way to let gun shows kill you. dehydration from forgetting to drink water as you look at all the guns on a hot day is one way for starters, although I don't know if forgetting to drink water is a normal thing that people do, this just reminded me that I am thirsty."
RWBY,3dvhwt,ethanice,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:48:17 2015 UTC,You will feed her yourself you will train her yourself and if she dies?  You will bury her yourself!
RWBY,3dvhwt,trinitynox,3,Mon Jul 20 02:22:55 2015 UTC,So what you're saying is...  Neo is a direwolf?  Sweet.
RWBY,3dvhwt,ethanice,2,Mon Jul 20 02:25:38 2015 UTC,Half as loyal twice as deadly six times as sexy.
RWBY,3dvhwt,trinitynox,3,Mon Jul 20 02:26:27 2015 UTC,10/10 will keep as a badass sidekick/pet.
RWBY,3dvhwt,ethanice,2,Mon Jul 20 02:34:15 2015 UTC,20/10 would hug Neo at first chance.
RWBY,3dvhwt,TotalWarfare,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:37:38 2015 UTC,I still want the little shit shot.
RWBY,3dvhwt,trinitynox,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:53:51 2015 UTC,I want you shot.  Just kidding! You'll be shanked.

RWBY,3dvhwt,TotalWarfare,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:37:50 2015 UTC,Neo is nothing.
RWBY,3dvhwt,trinitynox,2,Sun Jul 19 23:39:18 2015 UTC,Then explain the process of shooting nothing.
RWBY,3dvhwt,TotalWarfare,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:40:43 2015 UTC,...  don't.

RWBY,3dv5fd,irishgoblin,4,Sun Jul 19 20:16:09 2015 UTC,Blame San Andreas.
RWBY,3dv5fd,Spartacus400,4,Sun Jul 19 20:19:04 2015 UTC,"God I want them to do a remake of that.  Keep everything the same, just bring the graphics up to par."
RWBY,3dv5fd,irishgoblin,4,Sun Jul 19 20:21:48 2015 UTC,"Alternatively, pray to the Gods of Mods that someone rebuilds the old girl in the GTA V engine. Or at least bring back K-DST."
RWBY,3dv5fd,pEuAsTsSy,2,Sun Jul 19 20:26:44 2015 UTC,I still listen to K-DST when driving around and pretend it's an actual radio station. Has it really been 10 years already? Time flies.

RWBY,3dv5fd,Spartacus400,3,Sun Jul 19 20:12:36 2015 UTC,6 is being generous... xD jk.
RWBY,3dv5fd,ZurichianAnimations,2,Sun Jul 19 20:18:09 2015 UTC,"Uh, it's actually 6."
RWBY,3dv5fd,TAC_Gatekeeper,2,Sun Jul 19 20:19:33 2015 UTC,...  That's why I said just kidding...

RWBY,3dv5fd,Spartacus400,2,Mon Jul 20 00:15:00 2015 UTC,I don't watch GOT.
RWBY,3dv5fd,Siarles,2,Mon Jul 20 00:15:46 2015 UTC,"I don't either, but the red wedding is a reference to something that happens in it. What it is I couldn't tell you though."
RWBY,3dv5fd,ChewyNipple,0,Mon Jul 20 00:25:28 2015 UTC,Wedding with lots of death.
RWBY,3dv5fd,ChewyNipple,2,Mon Jul 20 01:34:33 2015 UTC,That's what I've heard. Didn't want to say anything case I was wrong.

RWBY,3dve69,Nurple17,3,Sun Jul 19 21:30:48 2015 UTC,"Well, whatever her top would be classified as, it is definitely covering more than a conventional bikini, and there have been posts where the nipples are poking through, so I'd say the problems may arise from how low cut her bottoms are."
RWBY,3dve69,DrowSpectre,2,Sun Jul 19 21:46:07 2015 UTC,Agreed.
RWBY,3dve69,scot911,2,Sun Jul 19 22:39:54 2015 UTC,I'd be more worried bout the bottom than the top.

RWBY,3dvqdu,Madgamer2k7,4,Sun Jul 19 23:12:19 2015 UTC,"Well, Saber is the reincarnated heroic spirit of King Arthur, who was actually a woman in this universe for some reason that /u/madgamer2k7 can explain because I don't remember. Still referred to as ""The King of Knights"".  As for what order to watch the series in? I watched F/Z (both seasons are on Netflix) and then I watched F/SN on kissanime.com . It made a lot more sense that way ."
RWBY,3dvqdu,KnightMiner115,4,Sun Jul 19 23:16:04 2015 UTC,"I've got explanations here!  Saber isn't a reincarnation of King Arthur. Rather she IS King Arthur.  Saber was originally is a male in the prototype version of Fate as seen here.  Somewhere along the development, the main artist and character designer, Takeuchi Takashi, drew a genderswapped version of Arthur and absolutely loved the design. He eventually convinced the author of Fate, Nasu Kinoko, to change Saber's gender to female.  To sum it up, Saber was a male in the prototype version, main artist drew a genderswapped version, then convinced the author to change Saber to female, and thus Arturia Pendragon was created.  As for why she's female in universe and referred to as king? She was born female, but had to pretend to be male due to the people of Britain at the time being unable to accept a woman as their ruler. Thus, she is seen by Fate's history as King Arthur Pendragon rather than Queen Arturia Pendragon."

RWBY,3dxcci,SHADOWSTORM36,5,Mon Jul 20 13:47:41 2015 UTC,Alright this question again!    Roman (from what I understand) is on one of those big ships and (from what I understand) are like warships with probably large firepower.  Those warships probably have huge droids stores which a big fan theory is that Cinder will take control of them.  Anyways I think Roman in S3 will take control of the ship in some way to give Cinders faction which will give them a huge source of power to take control of what ever they want to do.  I think that Blake will become consumed with the white fang again and Ruby will take a large amount of time to find the masked woman (Cinder).  I think we will learn a bit more of Cinders motive and plan in general and maybe we can learn the backing of it that may make us understand her more as a character and like her a bit more.  Also Cream Machine.

RWBY,3dxcci,Nurple17,5,Mon Jul 20 19:18:21 2015 UTC,"Vital festival > Cool fights Roman corrupts Ironwood > Altas invades Vale  Cinder uses virus to take control of Ironwood's robots (including Penny?) and manipulates the White Fang in order to take over and/or destroy Vale. If Cinder tries to destroy Vale, Beacon hunters go on the offensive, hunting down the White Fang bosses, Torchwick, Ironwood and eventually Cinder. If Cinder takes over Vale, creating some Militaristic Dictatorship, Ozpin goes into hiding and the beacon hunters do a Dumbledore's Army. Eventually they find a way to remove Cinder's power base and take her out.   Not sure who fights who in either event. Not sure I buy RWBY being able to defeat Cinder, but I don't want em to lose and have to be saved again.  A couple of smaller things I think will happen and care about:   Sage and Scarlet. Hopefully they can redeem SSSN.  Qrow. Basically older dude Ruby, should be fun. Learning what Raven is about. This is very interesting to me because I have ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA. Velvet finally shows us WHAT IS IN THE DAMN BOX. Then Crosshares becomes cannon  Yang and Neo's rematch. Hopefully more impressive than Blake and Torchwicks'.

RWBY,3dxcci,Thothslibrary,3,Mon Jul 20 10:00:43 2015 UTC,"In the Tournament some members of RWBY and JNPR will eventually be beaten badly (possibly by courtesy of Mercury and his shotgun-boots) and it'll get them down but later in a real fight they'll redeem themselves. Pyrrha being the exception as she might just be beaten inside and/or outside the tournament without redeeming herself.  Cinder will finally reveal the specifics of what she's trying to do and why she wants to do it.  I think Adam's (and by extension the White Fang's) ideals will start to clash with Cinder's after she starts acting out her plan. They probably won't directly fight/intervene with each others plans but the White Fang will break off support.  Roman Torchwick will be smoother than ever and still be best villain. We might also get confirmation that Neo is specifically helping him and not Cinder.  Penny might either get taken over by Cinder or forced into the front line by Ironwood. Either way she'll get badly injured, contemplate her existence, then seemingly die only to be repaired/rebuilt later with her memories in tact.  Hopefully, they'll also be some be devastating event like what Breach should have been that will happen earlier on in the volume."

Maybe the tournament/festival gets interrupted by Cinder and company.  -I imagine Roman somehow escapes Ironwood's iron clutches (hahahah no). Ironwood will either force Penny to fight or she might begin questioning who she should be fighting for.  -Neo will probably be shown being allied with Roman much more than Cinder, and speaking of Cinder, she will be slightly less cryptic than last season.  -I'm hoping Sun and Neptune either stick with SSSN more or Sage and Scarlet prove that Sun and Nep. aren't just heat-seeking missiles blowing up the shippers (myself included, my bias cast aside in that statement. On this subject, I would much rather have them tease ships involving the members of RWBY every now and then rather than actually make something canon, to keep peace with all unless the plot calls for it). I thought Sun was really cool in S1 but he did nothing alongside his new pal in S2.  -Still waiting for Roman and Ozpin's pimp cane fight."

Then, more as a supplementary use more than a back-up, you've got TinEye. Works the same as Google Image Search.  SauceNAO can be nice, if you're 99% confident the image you got came from Pixiv or a site like it, but it's pretty useless (in my experience) for Western art & artists.  All said, though, it's a time-consuming effort, especially if you're working with a small-name artist or someone from the -chans, as -chan message boards don't auto-archive, so any art in them is likely to vanish when the boards fall far enough from the front page.  That last point is why I offer myself as a 'Sourceror'. Most people who want to post art don't have the time to go back through the paper trail to find Artist Zero for the piece they want to post, so they come to me. I have the spare time they don't."

Kinda like how WW I was called ""The War to End All Wars,"" at the time.  Other than that, I can agree with most of what you're saying."
RWBY,3durzu,Spartacus400,2,Sun Jul 19 18:51:06 2015 UTC,"Well considering what was at stake I think it's safe to say it wasn't some 4 year war. It probably took a while if it was to have such a huge cultural influence that people would globally change how they name their children for the rest of time.  And actually in my fanfiction and such, that's how I always depict it, a WW1/WW2, war to end all wars."
RWBY,3durzu,Spartacus400,2,Sun Jul 19 18:58:17 2015 UTC,"I mean, WW I lasted about 4-5 years, WW II lasted about 6 in Europe, and closer to 7 in Asia if I remember correctly.  Length doesn't necessarily determine how world-changing an event is."
RWBY,3durzu,thebluehedgehog,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:13:50 2015 UTC,"If the war was won in only a couple years I doubt it would have had the lasting impact it did. Plus that's not how wars are fought normally. The IRL Hundred years war was 116 years with those extra 16 being truces or cease fires so the countries could recover for a little bit.  So even if it wasn't one epic campaign, it could still have been a long term thing. Neither side willing to give up till the very end."
RWBY,3durzu,Spartacus400,2,Sun Jul 19 19:22:32 2015 UTC,"Given Ozpin's statements, I'm going to guess the war was somewhere between 5-10 years.  Not much longer than that.  20 years at the absolute most."

RWBY,3durzu,Spartacus400,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:36:43 2015 UTC,"Since the only non- colour name is Ozpin, I think at least a generation (70 years) is probable. The rules that banned creativity quite likely started a full generation more before that."
RWBY,3durzu,thebluehedgehog,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:47:17 2015 UTC,"Ozpin was born before the war, yes.  But we don't know how far.  He could've fought in it as a teenager/young 20s.  From what we can tell so far, the color naming rule is 2, maybe 3 generations old.  Ozpin is theorized to be around 100, so my numbers here would make sense."
RWBY,3durzu,Spartacus400,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:49:34 2015 UTC,"I got the impression that the colour names started as a protest before war broke out in rebellion. Given that even adults have colour names and there are no other deviants (super strange but w/e anime) I would presume that colour names were already 'normal'/unquestioned before the fighting started . . . implying colour names began far earlier than 20 years before the war began, maybe even two generations (~60-120 years BEFORE a 100 year war)."
RWBY,3durzu,thebluehedgehog,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:55:56 2015 UTC,"I mean, don't forget that the war was already 80 years ago.  So, I would guess that the people who started the color stuff started it with the generation born during the war.  Since I assume the war was around a decade long, that would give 90 years, so around 3-4 generations for it to become commonplace.  Basically at this point, we have 2 equal headcanons that need the show to confirm/disprove."
RWBY,3durzu,Spartacus400,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:09:40 2015 UTC,"If colour names were not normal/thought-about before the war's end there should be current children that deviate from it. At this point the norm of colour names is a point of lower creativity instead of more. If the reason behind the colour names, wanting individuality, remained fresh then there would be more, or at least some, variation away from that norm."
RWBY,3durzu,oelitedragono,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:26:37 2015 UTC,How do you figure?  The war ended 80 years ago.    It's been at the very least 4 generations since the war.  That's plenty of time for the color naming to become commonplace.

Personally, I see this black Blake as a way for certain people to further connect with her character. Being a faunus and oppressed and all, Blake's struggle parallels the oppression of blacks in the Americas, and considering her name comes from an old word for ""black"", some artists made that jump and colored their Blakes with darker skin. Are there other oppressed people around the world that aren't black? Sure, but for many of the artists, black oppression is close to home (this artist in particular is Brazilian, and that country has a no worse history of slavery). Is it necessary? Of course not, but to the artists that create her in that way, the skin color makes her that much more relatable"

RWBY,3dszbs,NobilisUltima,3,Sun Jul 19 12:49:51 2015 UTC,You are my hero...this theory is brilliant!
RWBY,3dszbs,texastostada,6,Sun Jul 19 12:06:07 2015 UTC,"Up until your dust part, your theories are good.  But almost the entirety of your Dust theory is mere conjecture at best.  Particularly about the semblances matching up with elements of dust and that chart."
RWBY,3dszbs,Spartacus400,5,Sun Jul 19 04:25:36 2015 UTC,"Actually most of the dust info is just flat out wrong. If you can find a good image of the pamphlet Weiss had (I couldn't find the one I originally read), it tells you shit."
RWBY,3dszbs,Leivve,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:40:53 2015 UTC,Please explain.  This is in line with WoR Dust.
RWBY,3dszbs,Leivve,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:56:37 2015 UTC,"Semblance has absolutely nothing to do with dust in the slightest. Dust my modify certain properties of a Semblance, or in Wiess's case, her Semblance lets her manipulate the dust. But all Semblance is based on a person's personality and nothing else.  Also dust is energy not the cause of energy, so things like time don't exist. Dust is always the reaction, not the actual thing that causes it. When air shifts it creates wind, when something heats up fire, ect. The reason why Weiss can use all that fancy stuff is because her semblance let's her alter the properties of dust.  Also Dust can't be people because humans found it long before there would have been enough people to make that much dust."
RWBY,3dszbs,Leivve,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:47:34 2015 UTC,"Interesting thought.    Can you explain then how Blake by using dust modified her Semblance?  There is also a theory called elemental personality.  Fire is hot and sharp, like Yang and Earth is cold and blunt like Blake, ice is cold and sharp like Weiss, etc. Also a personality is a manifestation of ones soul. Since all three interact with each other there should be a lowest common denominator, which I believe to be the soul.  It would make more sense that it would be a constant than the exception, unless you feel Blake and Weiss are the only ones that can do that, and somehow Weiss knew this fact without explanation.  Weiss has used Time as an element several times, including the sheering sound she make when lunging forward and versus the Paladin.  Also as it stands Dust Aura and Semblance have yet to be defined in the least. I'd be careful dismissing theories without some context or proof."
RWBY,3dszbs,Leivve,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:15:26 2015 UTC,"Everyone can have their semblance enhanced with dust, but Weiss's semblance lets her manipulate dust to preform acts that other people simply can't.  Also there have been no signs of an earth dust, brown is lightning.  Personality isn't manifestation of your soul, not even IRL. Your soul is your life force/will of being. Aura is your will in physical form. Your personality is what decided what your semblance is, and if it changes your semblance will change too, even if it's just in minor details.   Weiss's time is something only she can do because of her semblance.  So why does your potato theory weigh more then everyone else's potato theory? What makes you so special that you know you're right?"
RWBY,3dszbs,SterlingStallion,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:30:00 2015 UTC,Blake used it against Roman at the end of season 2.

RWBY,3drw30,comkiller,2,Sun Jul 19 02:05:17 2015 UTC,"That's close, but not exactly right.  Genderfluid is for those who identify more as either gender or people who shift between genders, androgynous (Hello! Nice to meet you, by the way!) is for someone of both genders, non-binary or agender is for neither gender nor any gender, and genderqueer is actually a catch-all term for all the various terms.  Proper pronouns are they/them/their(self) as well as ze/hir/hirself, ey/em/eirself, xie/xem/xemself, and one/one's/oneself."

RWBY,3drw30,Siarles,0,Sun Jul 19 05:13:05 2015 UTC,"Actually, only the last three are even close to being proper. ""They"" is often used, but never in the way the comic did because it sounds awkward just replacing the pronoun, but even when used ""right"" it's terrible, terrible grammar. The rest of them aren't even words except the last group.  IDC how you want to think of yourself, but please don't butcher the language to do so.  [Edit] and ""one"" and its derivatives only work in specific situations."

A question about alternative genders was asked, and I answered it to the best of my ability since I am of an alternative gender and felt I could provide insight.  If you want to bitch about semantics and linguistic choices to a group of people who chose to use those pronouns for themselves, bring it up to the community at large rather than shoot the messenger.   Otherwise, step the fuck off your soapbox and move along. I've got better things to do than argue with a complete outsider with the knack of picking stupid internet fights and splitting hairs."

RWBY,3dsnzq,Kemosaabi,2,Tue Jul 21 20:16:10 2015 UTC,How competent do we have to be?  Can we do only part of the song?
RWBY,3dsnzq,Darren_Carrigan,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:39:36 2015 UTC,"None of us are professionals! Just go at it and have fun. Follow the video to get your sound quality as good as possible, though.  Also, you can absolutely pick and choose parts. I skipped the rap completely, but recorded two times to add background vocals. Also, if you know how to splice, you can do that too. Do whatever you're comfortable with, but don't be afraid of imperfections!  EDIT: as for a note on timing, the trick is to leave silence in between singing. For example, when I do backup lines, I sing the first line of the song so /u/Kemosaabi can line it up, then just stay quiet until the part comes up. Unnecessary bits are muted in post-production."
RWBY,3dsnzq,Darren_Carrigan,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:23:47 2015 UTC,"Not at all, just watch the vid about recording.  Yes, or you can do multiple 'takes' with each being every other verse or something - that was done in RLR2 because occasionally the voices overlapped."
RWBY,3dsnzq,TwentyfootAngels,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:52:49 2015 UTC,"I think he more so meant if he didn't want to do part of the song, like if he didn't want to rap or something. (God knows why)"

RWBY,3dsnzq,J2KHutch,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:25:04 2015 UTC,"So I got my two bits recorded, would you like silence before & after for easier sync? Maybe a specific audio format or upload place?"
RWBY,3dsnzq,metallicfan45,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:39:48 2015 UTC,"again, easiest way to do it is to sync it with the original song. the original song is ~3:05, and your recording should be the same. I am sure that Kemosaabi can deal with it no matter what, (unless you sang WAY off timing of the lyrics) so you are probably good no matter what."
RWBY,3dsnzq,DaRealAmana,2,Sun Jul 19 23:11:43 2015 UTC,Because i only did excerts I just put the song on headphones and sang along. I seriously did not consider that simple solution -_-  I have the files ready to go wherever you guys want them uploaded/sent to.

RWBY,3dt3oz,thebluehedgehog,6,Sun Jul 19 14:43:03 2015 UTC,"Thread from 4 months ago  Yang for Ruby, or in the name of adventure. Ruby for 'greater people-kind'/hope. Blake and Weiss would team up for faunus/workers' rights and one will die as a martyr while the other lives in grief to further the cause. Pyrrha to save Jaune. Jaune retires and dies of tetanus from accidentally cutting himself with a pen while grading. I know Nora for Ren, Ren for Nora is preferred, but Nora would die happy while experimenting with explosives, Ren would be the stay-at-home dad for Ruby's children, and be like Ruby's dad when she ends up dead. stop inserting your cracks nevar.          One or two of Cardin's team dies before graduation, another goes into the police, and he and Cardin shaped up after the death but Cardin sticks to easy missions out of fear and ends up an alcoholic. Coco gets bored killing things and starts to try conquering the corporate world, likely as a designer, but keeps having to dodge investigations into some questionable practices, either with black market dealings or how she acquires competitors (or sabotages them).         Fox and Yatsuhasi remain hunters, die in the field most likely since I doubt hunters retire. Velvet hunts for a few years then switches to teaching - dies in child birth around 36 after refusing to save her life at the cost of the child's. Glynda dies protecting Beacon from a large-scale grimm attack. Ozpin dies (perhaps first) attempting to stop the war (maybe he succeeds). Port dies of a heart attack or in the grimm invasion. Oobleck went with Ozpin, lived, but started to wonder if he was doing more harm teaching children to be hunters than good because of the war threat and moves to teaching at a poor, normal school - dies by being knifed in a school violence attack.          Penny doesn't die. She watches her father die, his brother, his children grow, age and die, and still she lives as a teenager. If Ozpin isn't dead she probably starts a new life teaching with him because he has a no-aging or immortality semblance and knows the pain of being stuck in a changing world, both retreating to a constant turn-over of people instead of trying to have families they would just watch age and die.           Cinder kills herself, or suicide by cop, when backed into a corner with no chance of winning or even escaping. Her dreams of holding the world crushed, her clothes torn, her skin marred in scars, her face aged or maimed, with nothing left to fight for nor to use to survive.                 Roman would have died first, he miscalculated a police/hunter raid on a base. Although he swore he had no stake in the cause nor Cinder, due to his miscalculation in the forces or weapons brought to the base he was going to defend while she escaped, he did sort of die for her. She cried, mostly as it began to sink in that her plans were crumbling, but a little for him too.              Neo left the moment it looked like Cinder might lose, she only sticks around for the winning teams and her own gain in power, her services not buyable for money. She wandered, grifting drunkards in bars, moving from place to place. She ended up in the middle of a fight after going after the wrong bar (she did not start it) and was killed by an attack that missed its target.             Ironwood is stabbed by an assassin, in a quiet, boring attempt at a public venue. A press release states that he was injured, but it was a killing blow. A work-in-progress digital copy of him is suddenly of the utmost importance in Atlas, scavenging what it can from his deceased body and teaching the program what they can. The death was of his soul, so no aura would be usable by the copy. The injury is described as severe enough to avoid public appearances for years, but orders from the people who worked closest with him and head the copy project are being signed with his name. Eventually a robot body makes some small, non-speaking appearances under strict supervision, and after about 8 years Ironwood is back in full. This is a protocol to avoid the war that would inevitably occur in retaliation for his death, or to be caused by a successor. Ironwood does want to avoid war, but is distrustful and only values his own opinions on how to prevent it - he would die as a result of short-sightedness but his name still spoken as living as one of his few acts of looking ahead, although it too lacked a certain grasp of consequences -- it sets up Atlas' military to be controlled by a puppet almost impossible to remove.           Taiyang gets a hint as to what happened to Summer, a village might have found her and buried her. He goes to interview the people who might recall the woman's face, soon getting reports of a blonde woman, the age Summer would have been, asking about the dead huntress as well. Taiyang continues to follow the trail, dropping his guard further with each step down the rabbit hole. Eventually, unable to maneuver, he find himself entangled in the web of favors and lies of Yang's mother, exacerbated by the favors he promised and lies he told to get that far. He is pulled out by Yang's mother, she tells him that Summer did not die when she disappeared although without knowing what happened to her she could be dead by now, Yang's mother dies trying to give Taiyang a chance to flee from Yang's mother's sins but Taiyang dies soon after before making it back home.                   Qrow is summoned, despite his retirement, as part of an extraction team for either RWBY as students, or of Ruby (and possibly some independent hunters she was leading) who found a moderately difficult mission to be far beyond what was expected, and after making promises to Ruby, ends up falling as he covered her retreat.               I don't see Sun being particularly self-sacrificing, but I could see him bein interrogated and refusing to give up someone else's secret out of a personal sense of honor as well as stubbornness against letting someone challenge/beat him. Maybe RWBY, JNPR, and SSSN, maybe CFVY, find out they are being trained more as soldiers than grimm hunters. They decide to split from the hunter program, with some key friends refusing to abandon their training, but agree to pretend they were never told. The group became a fugitive group before doing anything against the government due to social norms and pressures. They go on missions, small acts for information or to put a damper on military aggressions. On one such mission Sun was injured and left, assuming that they had enough friends that he would be treated and not executed they left him. However, with the increase of stress on the Vale military from two domestic groups now and escalation with Atlas he put Sun in a prison outside the reach of hunters and did his best to make him unreachable by the splinter hunters while using any means to get information from Sun as to their whereabouts and weaknesses. Sun started with joke answers but grew weary and eventually not giving something up took all his effort. Months went by and the miscalculation as to how okay he would be when captured dawned on him and he realized there was only one thing for him to do if he was to keep the information hidden. Even if the base had moved other hints might prove fatal for the group. Sun killed himself so his torturers would never beat him. -stubbornness."
RWBY,3dt3oz,thebluehedgehog,7,Sun Jul 19 06:41:38 2015 UTC,"And some other ideas from a thread asking about motives and my responses went dark  Yang wants to soar. She wants to never see what is coming, never be bored, have the tales everyone wants to hear but only enough time to tell some in exchange for room and board in the places she pauses at. To Yang, not moving is death, but worse, because when stuck in one place with a routine you are aware of it.          Blake wants to find the heroes of fairy tales that the White Fang departed from. She grew up fighting for what she believed in, trusting that if she did not fight for the greater good no one would. Don't just support those that want to change the world, stand up and do it yourself. She envies Ruby, so much so that without the desperate hope that Ruby is right about heroes being real, Blake would hate her leader. She wants to see the world the way Ruby does with every fiber of her soul, but that was broken from her long ago; however, she is unable to bring herself to do that to Ruby and so mostly just chooses to not initiate contact with her, but if Ruby were to ever start to have that view shatter there would be little sympathy from Blake who already went through that, saw it coming, warned her, and who would be hurt all over again to watch that hope die.          Weiss has been given everything she could ever want, but in exchange she was expected to give no less than perfection. She was in countless extra curricular including voice lessons, fencing, music, dancing, and gymnastics, lessons her family could afford with ease -- but was expected to maintain perfect grades, (or be far above her peers if educated with private tutors) and compete and win any competitions concerning her extra curriculars or excel at performances. Skills. They were all hard-earned skills that people praised as 'talent' and asked how she could do so well 'naturally' or 'with so little effort'. No. She worked hard. She studied instead of reading or sleeping. She pushed her physical limits any day that wasn't rest and those days were for music and the larger school work assignments. Nothing was ever quite enough. If she started to handle all her expectations well it was time to add another lesson. Weiss started Beacon because she wanted to have a short time where the expectations were known and not increasing. Terribly confused by free-time or 'hanging out' she continues to go over school subjects, although not entirely wasted given her lack of prerequisite courses, mostly unnecessary. She wanted to have a moment of not being pushed far beyond her limits, to have a chance to breathe, to excel and that be it without immediately having more lessons added on. But she cannot. She cannot stand one point being off. It terrifies her, gives her nightmares, tears at her resolve. Being passed over as leader was like an arrow to the chest, but despite cutting through her core it also cut the strap of a heavy weight. In a way, she isn't just after a break but just a chance to be good at something, naturally, like people seemed to say of her hard-earned skills. Her lessons and the expectations placed on her have given her that in her huntress training at Beacon, but now it feels hollow, unearned, as though her time is wasted. Yet, there is still some resentment that the team still gets into trouble over their heads and is still being pushed beyond their limits so frequently.     Jaune was like Weiss, not so well off but if there was something he wanted to learn there was someone he could learn from. He was not pushed so hard, but failed to push himself. He is driven by regret, that he wasted those opportunities, that he never realized his advantages. Play, sports, classwork, they were easy at the community school when he was young and as a result he never learned how to study or work for something, even once he realized that he was falling behind. He owned it, made being the clown his 'thing', but it wasn't enough. Over time the seed of regret grew, the words to people saying he had no talents, was a lay-about, was worthless, began to sink past his jokes and mask of humor. But it was too late. He was too far into school to change his past, to get into the advanced classes, to learn all he needed to to pass the entrance exam into Beacon and get accepted beyond just that. He deluded himself. Told himself that he did know things, that he just didn't try for grades, that the information was in his head and whenever he decided to try it would all work out easily. Except he barely knew what applying oneself was, and it is far harder than words let on.          Roman wants the world. He was denied a lot as a child, told he would never amount to anything, should stop dreaming, should resign himself to a boring fate. Instead he ended up in crime, advanced quickly, and having given up on earning the world he will just take it. Watching everything burn is satisfying as punishment to those that pushed him down, told him he wasn't good enough to be a hunter, told him to just work with the police, that he would never get into Beacon. If they didn't want to train him as a hunter, then he'd prove that none of them were capable. His anger manifested as greed, wanting to take everything or anything with little direction. He has no stake in Cinder's plans, but they give him a direction; he would attack indiscriminately but he allows her to point him until it bores him.    Ren was once just as carefree and youthful as Nora, but he was forced to hide while his family and neighbors died against a grimm attack. Ren changed, he swore to never stand back again. The price of his unwavering determination was youth and his own self. Only Nora still sees the happy boy that would play with her, that had dreams not just ambitions, that could connect with people beyond accessing their use in an attack against grimm. He rather dislikes Jaune, and Pyrrha seems like a waste having spent much of her energy and skill at tournaments instead of killing grimm. (Unintentional, but this works for my almost-crack idea of Ren x Ruby, since she is serious about going against grimm but childish enough that she could do what Nora could not.)          Nora savors being the best, being strong. She held her innocence the day of the attack and wore it as a shield. She will be strong. She will protect those she cares for. Nora lost her parents and sister that day, but she saw from the other children left orphans that if she pushed people away she would be alone; instead she played the part of child, and was cared for when she most missed her own parents, using that innocence to get what she needed to survive. Ren sought destruction with his pain of inadequacy, but he had a family that would not leave him from being foolish or cold; Nora sought strength to be ready next time. Despite her personality, she agrees with Blake more than Ruby, there are no happy endings but she won't give up like Blake, she will fight her damnedest to take her happy ending from the fates themselves.          Velvet used to stand up to bullies. She was once strong-willed and unwavering. One day, though, it was just once too many. Maybe classes had too much due, or she finally realized that nothing she did would stop them and that no one else would ever even try. She broke. She gave up. Her eyes would glaze over and she would not say a thing, not even try to pull away if she was held, not raise her harms to block a punch. She expended no energy against the harassment. Already set on the course of being a huntress (so every would respect her then!) she did not bother to stop it, there was nothing else she wanted although she no longer wanted that either. She would have felt empty if she could still feel. Her voice when Cardin teased her was weak, without any conviction or force, just her playing her role. Velvet doesn't have any motivation, not anymore, she just goes through the motions and continues on the path without question.              Reading was always hard for Cardin, slow and the words or letters liked to jump around. But he was good with any game, excelling after simply learning the rules. Each year he ended up lower in the class rank, or in lower classes. Even in math, which he had always been okay with, he gave up when word problems started showing up although if he had just been pushed to the next section he would have done well. He heard some students mocking him, pretending to read a book upside-down. He grabbed the book, smashed it into the boy's head, and kicked the one that had been laughing. It felt good. It wasn't long before there were constant detentions, but soon any teasing was done well out of Cardin's notice. The other behind children joined him, and within a year they ran the school, planning their war against the other students each night in detention. They couldn't do sports anymore, even if they could keep up grades detention put a halt to that one last reason to try. The boys were sent to a school for the military, combat school, their attire and weapons were uncreative, but effective. The boys fit in, Cardin had an outlet for his energy, and was put in classes that didn't need lots of reading. The bulling stopped. Then he went to Beacon. There he was in the lowest rank again, his strength useless in history and grimm studies. So he started it up again, easily picking out students that would not, or could not, fight back."

So, if I had to guess anyone to die at this point, Pyrrha would be the most likely to die.

RWBY,3dt3oz,Zentics,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:38:35 2015 UTC,"I think the show is going to get more serious but not super dark.  It's not going to go from what we know to constant death and despair. It's going to get serious, bad things are going to happen, but it's still going to be RWBY. For comparison, Kingdom Hearts."
RWBY,3dt3oz,LadWatcherIsHere,2,Sun Jul 19 06:10:56 2015 UTC,"I never felt is was going to go that dark. I do feel there will be at least one arch that explores a darker side to the show. I'd even be satisfied with a prequel that explains some of the trails of the faunus living in early Remnant. I'm sure Blake's past gets pretty dark too. If the show gets half as grimdark as it's soundtrack I will be satisfied, at least at one point in the story, just once."
RWBY,3dt3oz,Thothslibrary,2,Sun Jul 19 06:17:43 2015 UTC,"Okay. These conversations just make me nervous because there are people who want, and even expect some pretty messed up things to happen. But yeah, things might get closer to Red Like Roses II/I May Fall/Sacrifice in the future."
RWBY,3dt3oz,thebluehedgehog,2,Sun Jul 19 06:22:05 2015 UTC,"In the future.   You mean in 2-4 volumes more?  I swear, if they don't do justice to the second opening and Red Like Roses soon..."
RWBY,3dt3oz,Thothslibrary,2,Sun Jul 19 07:59:08 2015 UTC,"I mean whenever the writers decide that it's time for the story to go that way because I trust them to do well, to follow Monty's plan, and to tell the story the way he wanted it, not as fans demand it.  If they don't do it soon you'll do what? Complain about it? It will happen when the time is right. No sooner."
RWBY,3dt3oz,Artemis_Huntley,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:37:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah... I'm not sure if it was truly what Monty wanted all along. It might be his show but his decision doesn't always makes a difference. Things like how Miles and Kerry forgot to erase the crater joke despite Monty himself told them (apparently) to do so suggest that the final product was a bit far away from what Monty wanted.  Or it could be that they simply don't manage to decide and are always changing the final product. The Production Diaries and Opening 2 proves that Volume 2 wasn't supposed to be like that. We were supposed to meet CFVY since the very beginning of the Volume, Scarlet and Sage too, a confrontation between RWBY and Cinder's team, Pyrrha and Jaune changing positions in the story, etc. But what we got was the opposite. Shows that they have to change the plot a lot while in the middle of production."
RWBY,3dt3oz,SandmanTheTerrible,4,Mon Jul 20 00:45:48 2015 UTC,"I'm not convinced any of the protagonists will die outright.  I think Penny is going to get corrupted.  I think Yang/ Pyrrha could be badly hurt protecting Ruby/Jaune.  I bet there's gonna be a hell of a lot of angst though, hohoo boy.    Ruby having to fight Penny if she gets corrupted Ruby having to face Cinder (if my potato about there being some connection between Summer/Cinder is correct) When If an Atlus/Other Kingdoms war breaks out, I bet the Schnees will side with Atlus... Weiss watcha gonna do? Blake having to face Adam, also we don't know about her parents at all. They could still be white fang, or maybe they're deaaaaddd... Maybe Adam killed them... Maybe Raven killed them Yang having to face Raven who could very well be evil. Jaune failing to be a hero and dealing with the guilt of not being able to protect people.   It's gonna be a riot ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)  I don't mean to toot my own horn, but some of these ideas actually sound pretty cool, feel free to steal."

RWBY,3dt3oz,thebluehedgehog,3,Mon Jul 20 15:09:54 2015 UTC,"Probably Ozpin but that's kind of an easy answer.  I'd probably go with Adam but this mostly comes down to there being more stories to be told with his death than being alive.  After his inevitable confrontation with Blake I could see him dying heroically to save her life or maybe someone like Weiss kills him thinking he's going to kill Blake. Maybe he sets himself up to die just as a last middle finger to the Schnee's and Blake?  I don't know but I think that would be an interesting place to take Blake's character.  I honestly could see Neptune dying as he is a minor character who would receive a reaction from the characters and a good portion of the audience.  I can see Kerry writing his character to die heroically in Sun or Jaune's arms while they scream to the heavens that their bff is gone.  As far as villains go Torchwick and Neo should not be allowed to die, or in Neo's case even talk.  Cinder however I can see dying at the hands of a main character, perhaps accidentally by Ruby.  I don't want to see any villain finding redemption in RWBY considering they're all pretty despicable (Even Emerald).  I also think to move Weiss' story forward I think at some point her father has to die.  I can't see him turning over a new leaf.  That would put Weiss and Winter in an interesting spot fighting over the company...  I guess I just look to see if more stories can be told with a character's death and Adam seems like the largest so far with Weiss' father a close second.  Cinder's seems inevitable and I could see Neptune dying as per Kerry's orders.  God bless"

He taunts her about her lack of experience, and literally breaks her back to humiliate her.  She is then kidnapped and left to rot in the hole in the ground that Banesaw came from. She is tended by a kindly but rude doctor who was imprisoned in the hole previously. She has been given a scroll in order to watch as the White Fang attacks Vale.  Over the course of several months, during which the White Fang takes over Vale, Weiss regains use of her back and begins training for her rematch with Banesaw. The doctor, unfortunately, informs her that it is nearly impossible to leave the hole. Only one person escaped the hole previously.  Through an unlikely series of events and a spirited musical number, Weiss escapes the hole and travels halfway across the world to Vale. She makes it back just as RBY and JNPR are about to be executed by the White Fang, using a massive burning snowflake sigil on a nearby bridge to signal her return.  After inspiring the remaining hunters and Valeans to fight back, a massive brawl breaks out in Beacon between the people and the White Fang. During the fight, Weiss and Banesaw focus only on each other and fight into the CCT. Banesaw is disabled, and everything is looking up, but then while standing over Banesaw's body, she is ambushed by Neo who stabs Weiss in the chest and carries Banesaw away.  But Weiss has her friends, who burst in and unload all of their guns into the pair, killing them instantly. The battle winds down, the guilty imprisoned, the valiant dead buried. Team RWBY looks out into the distance and wonders what could possibly happen next."

RWBY,3dsxh4,velkro16,5,Sun Jul 19 05:59:37 2015 UTC,"Cinder should probably be the one who breaks them considering she's the main villain.  I just don't hate her at the moment and that's a problem to me.  She's the main villain (We think) and she really hasn't done anything.  I'd like to see her injure a main character.  Also I think Yang needs to face Neo again but this time it needs to be an actual fight.  Last season's fight was kind of a joke if you ask me.  Actually the fact that Blake was the only one to win her fight by bullying the villain before saving Weiss was a bit much.  Especially when Breach ended in five minutes.  I think Cinder should activate a fire glyph at Ruby or Blake's feet and just take them out of the fight immediately, then do the same to Yang who just shrugs it off.  Weiss could do something similar as she is a glyph expert and maybe she could counter it with her own.    I just want a fight seen with some drama in it not a curb stomp for either side.  If you make both sides look competent it means the winner(s) look even better for it.  Having Neo KO Yang in 20 seconds does nothing for either character in my opinion.  Sorry for not going into too much detail I just want the Cinder fight most of all and I think it kind of writes itself.  God bless"
RWBY,3dsxh4,IamMenace,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:40:07 2015 UTC,"Having Neo KO Yang in 20 seconds does nothing for either character in my opinion.   Whaaa? It showed that 1. Yang isn't invincible. Her semblance can be countered. 2. She can't punch her way out of any problem. Had she taken a moment to realize Neo was playing her, she might not have been introduced to the train roof. 3. It showed out skilled the villains side are. (Is?)."
RWBY,3dsxh4,TheAllMightySlothKin,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:29:30 2015 UTC,And all of those things could have been emphasized by Yang putting up a fight.  A fight scene doesn't have to be a curb stomp for one side to look good.  If Yang had actually put up a fight but was simply outclassed by a smarter and more powerful villain I'd have no problem.  Yang was established as being able to take the most punishment on the team and got KO'ed in 20 seconds by hitting her head.  It didn't help Neo in my opinion because we saw nothing new from her really.  We already knew she could stop Yang's rockets and is obviously powerful if she can cast illusions around her and Torchwick to escape.  It also made Yang look like a chump in my opinion.  I simply wanted a fight scene that lasts a little longer like Weiss' for instance where both characters look strong.  I disagreed with Weiss losing that fight but that's not the point.  All I'm saying is I rarely like curb stomp battles as I think they serve little purpose.  They have their place but characters should still look strong in defeat.   God bless

RWBY,3dse4r,ZeronicX,11,Sun Jul 19 00:20:20 2015 UTC,"Personally I'm not a fan of team CFVY or the ending of Breach for that matter.  The writers really need to make the Grimm look strong this season.  It's hard to believe humanity has been pushed to the fringe when a corgi can kill a Grimm no problem.  As for power levels I'm not going to speculate.  We know Glynda can wave her riding crop and treats Grimm like pests while CFVY just bully them so I'm not sure.  I think the writers get carried away with ""Rule of Cool"" but this isn't anything they can't fix with stronger Grimm and by being consistent.    It also doesn't help that not only could team RWBY not stop the train or the Grimm, but Neo kicked Yang's butt anti-climatically, Ruby got bullied and didn't do much, and Weiss actually put up a fight but had to be saved by Blake who bullied Torchwick with the power of plot convenience.  I have faith that the writers can fix this though.  I just don't want to get to the point where Ruby can make a gun with her hand shout bang and kill an army of Grimm.  God bless"
RWBY,3dse4r,IamMenace,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:25:23 2015 UTC,"The only way they can Grimm a threat is if they just pull a Worf Effect on the Grimm we already have by using them as fodder against some much stronger versions of the ones we have.   Just straight up introduce a new Beowulf design and have a teacher say something like ""Oh, those Grimm you've been fighting were just the weak little baby one, that right there is the REAL THREAT!"" That Grimm design in question then becomes the default enemy, and it kicks ass every time it shows up."
RWBY,3dse4r,Mrfipp,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:44:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah that was kind of what I was thinking too.  I also think something like maybe Grimm are stronger during different phases of the moon, werewolf style.  Or maybe Grimm increase in power during times of strife and due to not very much strife the regular Grimm aren't as strong as they used to be, but Cinder will find a way to make even the Beowolves able to put up a fight.   You're idea is probably what they'll go for but I also hope they just make the regular Grimm more of a threat.  I'm cool with a single Beowolf being taken down easy but I'd like for them to be a legit threat in a pack.    God bless"
RWBY,3dse4r,IamMenace,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:09:45 2015 UTC,"That would be pretty cheesy, though. Lazy, too, especially if they didn't explain why these Grimm are somehow stronger—or, worse, if they don't actually perform differently in practice!"
RWBY,3dse4r,GreatWyrmGold,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:01:28 2015 UTC,"Although to be fair, the Grimm never felt like a threat before Breach, either."
RWBY,3dse4r,GreatWyrmGold,5,Tue Jul 21 04:00:28 2015 UTC,"We don't actually know what year CFVY are or how many years the BA(Hons) Grimm Hunting course at beacon is, so there's a chance that they could pretty much be fully fledged hunters.  As for CFVY being 'that good', honestly no-one else seemed to be having any trouble either soo... shrug   I've used this analogy before but RWBY = souls/borne.  CFVY are higher level, geared and know the monsters weaknesses;  as long as they don't make any mistakes or get mobbed, it ain't shit.  ( And then Coco is like ""Well What is it?"" )  But yeh, at this point grimm are more part of the world than an enemy, they're like the zombies in Walking Dead."
RWBY,3dse4r,Thothslibrary,9,Sun Jul 19 10:26:09 2015 UTC,"They're third years.  Besides the point though. CVFY ruins the series, because as you are pointing out, if students could take on that many grimm without blinking an eye how can grimm possibly be a threat to a full fledged hunter? Let alone a team of fully fledged hunters?  If they wanted to keep grimm a threat they should have made it a matter of experience, not power. RWBY should have already been at the apex and all this was for experience and knowledge to make them more effective. But instead they ruined it by making it only about power."
RWBY,3dse4r,Leivve,5,Sun Jul 19 00:23:50 2015 UTC,"Then again, we've only seen them go up against the Grimm that we know of currently in the series. Heck, for all we know, there could be Grimm out there that could pose a severe threat to humanity, like some crossbreed between an alligator, a pterodactyl, and a spider. Or there could be some Grimm that has armor so thick that Coco's minigun bullets can't easily penetrate them. When there's one thing like that, you can't rely exactly on stopping power, you're going to have to use your knowledge on Grimm weakpoints and attack patterns to help you out. Then again, this is just speculation, the show hasn't showed us other Grimm types that exist. So you could be right about all this, but I'm just throwing out my two cents around."
RWBY,3dse4r,Raquz,2,Sun Jul 19 00:34:45 2015 UTC,"They have said new kinds of grimm are discovered every day. But that doesn't change the fact that we haven't seen anything a trained squad of soldiers couldn't deal with, with the same efficiency.  I would have preferred if the army came in first and CFVY only came in at the last second to give us a little tease of killing off the last dozen grimm or something."
RWBY,3dse4r,Leivve,2,Sun Jul 19 00:43:17 2015 UTC,"Actually, we haven't seen anything the military can deal with, we saw what a group of highschool freshman, plus a corgi, can deal with. The military seemed rather useless compared to the children."

RWBY,3dse4r,Nurple17,6,Sun Jul 19 00:32:22 2015 UTC,"The only way I can see them pull out of this hole, is if they say CFVY are just really OP even compared to full fledged hunters. The biggest problem is they don't have any bar to compare to.  What is a full fledged hunter like? If Ruby was at the line, needed to join Beacon, then why are CRDL there? Why wasn't Pyrrha moved up? How do the students compare to normal soldiers? How do soldiers compare to police? Because of aura is everyone a naturally competent fighter to some degree? How fast do grimm age, and how does their power scale with age? Or do they even scale at all? And older grimm just are more experienced not actually better?  So many critical questions that could be answered in a single episode really easily."
RWBY,3dse4r,Leivve,3,Sun Jul 19 00:38:39 2015 UTC,"I don't really think Ruby's skill/strength is what got her moved - not in that she was like a prodigy or something.  I never got that impression.

RWBY,3dse4r,Leivve,2,Sun Jul 19 00:54:06 2015 UTC,"Rubes is special (I'm willing to bet, anyway).  Oobleck never asked her why she chose her profession.  She's too simple, too idealistic - different from the others.  What makes her the unique adorkable hero she is - that's why I think Ozpin decided to move her on a whim.  And the comment on her eyes?  Might be nothing, but might not.  Point is, I've assumed old Oz, for whatever reason, saw something he liked - and that's literally it.  Had it just been Glynda that night, or if Rubes had left the store early, or someone else had been headmaster she'd have finished out at Signal like all the rest."
RWBY,3dse4r,shinobi201,3,Sun Jul 19 01:05:07 2015 UTC,And the comment on her eyes?   He also mentioned familiarization with Qrow meaning he's a friend of the family in one sense or the other. The eye's comment was probably reference to his familiarization with Summer.
RWBY,3dse4r,Leivve,3,Sun Jul 19 01:10:06 2015 UTC,"Probably, and that too could contribute to his decision.  Basically, though, I saw Ruby's skipping levels as more to do with Ozpin's personal interest than actual merit on her part."

RWBY,3dse4r,Mrfipp,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:33:26 2015 UTC,"My theory is that modern hunters and the hunter academies are the by product of the Great War. A huge long war, that probably included multiple generations, ended and those who couldn't adapt to peace became what we call hunters. Before hand, they were just called heros, but with the sudden influx of heros they put a job title and description on it.  Or maybe the hunters aren't that great compared to flesh and blood soldiers (still better, just not as OP as you'd think), they've just been trained to take the fight to the grimm, while soldiers hold down the fort."

Anything less would be a disappointment."
RWBY,3dse4r,shinobi201,2,Sun Jul 19 00:45:46 2015 UTC,"If they were like that, humanity wouldn't have lived to find dust. This is just a case of getting carried away with rule of cool and ruining the grimm threat.   We know that?   They haven't said anything official. But I'd say they're pulling shit out of their ass if they didn't say there were third or fourth year. They are to old both physically, maturity, and experience to be second years.  RWBY are in their second semester, and using the point of reference for their increase in skill. I would lean more the to them being fourth years. Not third, but they would probably want to keep them around for a little bit; because fan service."
RWBY,3dse4r,Leivve,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:51:39 2015 UTC,"I've leaned toward 4th too, but you make a good argument on why it'd be better as 3rd (from their side) - and meanwhile, I'm just assuming they're second years anyway because this is Miles and Kerry we're talking about."
RWBY,3dse4r,shinobi201,4,Sun Jul 19 00:56:41 2015 UTC,"Miles and Kerry don't seem to realize, younger people, can recognize when someone is older then them, and even more so if they are much older.  Older people have a certain ""aura"" (IRL not RWBY) that younger/less experienced people can easily pick up. While older people tend to drown out other people's so they don't notice as much. So maybe Cinder can trick Glynda into thinking she's at the right age, but everyone else there can tell something is off about her."
RWBY,3dse4r,Leivve,2,Sun Jul 19 01:00:59 2015 UTC,"It's less about age than the experience and mindset.  They usually correlate, but my point is that it's perfectly plausible to have the ones who are ""more mature than their age.""  She'd be an outlier, which is bad for undercover work, but I don't think it's impossible.  More importantly, they probably just don't care.  And in fact, if they'd been clear about her age to begin with instead of allowing the mindset that she was significantly older to take hold, I bet most of the fandom wouldn't either.  However, they've always known she was meant to be pretty young - to them, that impression of being older never crossed their mind.  Nor do many other things, which is tied to being a work of fiction - the most blatant case being physics.  So, it's a matter of where that level exists to allow a suspension of disbelief.  Mine is low, and on top of that, I'm usually indifferent to it anyway.  So, I just act as Devil's advocate for sake of discussion."

She took out three giant Grimm in a matter of seconds. Between the four, she seemed to take the whole invasion the least serious, and she just breezed through everything, to the point where it makes me think why a Gatling gun just isn't standard issue equipment.  I actually have some issues with the fact that her weapon is just a giant gun. Every other weapon we've seen in this show is some sort of hybrid weapon between at least two different weapons, and combined with each student's actual fighting ability, makes it seem like those are skills that they have to work at to get better. Even Jaune's basic sword and shield is something that require some skill from the wielder.  But Coco's fighting style is just to stand there, pull a trigger, and things die. How do you ""get good"" at that? How exactly does that scale and balance to the other students?   For me, I would be fine with that if it turns out that Coco is specifically specialized in that, for her to have such a high damage output in exchange for being average, at best, in every other area. For example, we saw her beat up a Grimm in a straight up one-on-one, but she would get her ass kicked by anyone who actually knew what they were doing. For her aura/semblance to work in a way to compliment the fact that she uses a giant gun."

Someone cannot simply pick up a gun and be able to fire with dead-shot accuracy. Even though her weapon isn't a hybrid aside from the handbag, it still requires her to know how to use it. for example if Weiss were to pick it up and try I am sure that she would be knocked down.

There is a lot of intent that went into the show. the way teams are color coded, and themed is kind of crazy, and I don't know how they managed to come up with it all. There are a lot of nice touches to the world and design. However there are a few other points that went into the show. One of the key themes in the shows whole design philosophy is practicality. Everything is decided based on what kind of workload it will inflict upon production. Several scenes and fights, and even characters were designed to take advantage of existing animations and models. The show is play blasted, not rendered, reducing the amount of time from productions start to finish product by as much as several days. The lighting and shadows is built into textures, special effects like muzzle flashes, and the fire from yangs gauntlet handled in after effects instead of in the animation, cutting down the need for render (I think the current development actually has the ability to generate some particles). The trouble is when people take the results of these cost, time, and effort saving measures and start writing conspiracy theories that border on the edge of insane justifying it under Monty's great effort for attention."
RWBY,3dq1t6,Vexzal,6,Sat Jul 18 10:05:20 2015 UTC,"You bring up good points, but that is all related to the graphical side of the show. I'm not saying that the animators aren't practical; if something takes too much effort for too little reward, it's not making the final cut.  But, unless I'm missing something, Monty came up with the characters, and it was his ideas that shaped who and what the characters are. The amount of stuff that went into the characters is amazing, as is the attention to detail (taking inspirations from fairy tales, myths, etc.). It seems just as likely that, if Neo is Roman's daughter, he'd want a name related to Rome, and while the connection here is linguistic, it's still there."
RWBY,3dq1t6,Vexzal,3,Sat Jul 18 10:16:53 2015 UTC,"Romans character base, is Romeo Candlewick, from Pinocchio, not something Roman. I wouldn't be surprised though if that's how it went down. Father/Daughter might be a bit of a stretch, but there is plenty that directly connects Neo to Roman. Her design was even based off a genderbent cosplay of Roman."
RWBY,3dq1t6,ProbablyHeretical,2,Sat Jul 18 10:29:04 2015 UTC,"What was the cosplay, I don't remember seeing one."
RWBY,3dq1t6,Vexzal,3,Sat Jul 18 10:30:10 2015 UTC,"While I don't know for certain, I'd be willing to bet it was this one."
RWBY,3dq1t6,shinobi201,1 point,Sat Jul 18 10:36:56 2015 UTC,"Yes, and in a sense, that alone may even be enough for the connection if it were intentional.  However, I absolutely wouldn't be surprised if it were completely coincidental and, as the colors imply, it was just the ice cream that influenced the decision.  I don't necessarily consider myself good at making such things - just doing what interests me - but I can tell you a lot can conveniently fall into place and work out to have a similar appearance to stuff like this.  In fact, that she was added in so last minute would even make that more likely and further undermines the idea that RWBY was so meticulously preplanned.  She was his character more than others - we may never know the details that went into making Neo.  For example, why Neo instead of Nea, the more direct and feminine alternative, unless Neo has some added significance.  Or maybe he just liked Neo.  We may never know now, and may have never known even if he was still with us."
RWBY,3dq1t6,Vexzal,2,Sat Jul 18 13:14:23 2015 UTC,"that she was added in so last minute would even make that more likely and further undermines the idea that RWBY was so meticulously preplanned.   I think that was originally one of the points I was going to make, but it got lost somewhere in writing. Your right, that's how I started this discussion, and that's still where I stand."

I wouldn't be surprised though if that's how it went down. Father/Daughter might be a bit of a stretch, but there is plenty that directly connects Neo to Roman. Her design was even based off a genderbent cosplay of Roman.    The writers and Monty have said though that one character can have many inspirations tied to them. Ruby isn't just based off Little Red Riding Hood, Yang isn't just based off Goldielocks, etc. Roman is a mishmash of inspirations.  His name is based off Candlewhick from Pinnocho, his look is based off a Clockwork Orange, and his weapon of choice is almost literally a Roman Candle. I think having a tangential relation to something based on his namesake wouldn't be completely out of the question."
RWBY,3dq1t6,Leivve,5,Sat Jul 18 16:07:29 2015 UTC,"Problem is Naples was ruled by an Aragonian king (eastern side of modern Spain) for the longest time. So Roman couldn't be the father, but Roman defiantly could have helped her get independence from her abusive parents, hence her loyalty."

RWBY,3dr6cy,Prince_Corn,3,Sat Jul 18 17:46:39 2015 UTC,"I'd probably show all of Beacon's campus for one thing.  It confused me that the CCT is at Beacon due to Penny and Ruby on the streets of Vale two seconds later and then Weiss, Ruby, Yang, and Blake all meeting up at the same time made me think they were in the city, not three minutes from Beacon.  Which makes Yang's line about Junior's Club being on the bad side of town funnier.  My favorite setting so far has probably been the Red Trailer.  I really want to see the characters in an icy environment like that.    I'd like for the settings to play a bigger part of the story.  You can learn so much and feel so much of the atmosphere in stunning landscapes.  I guess this comes from me enjoying the music and the non-dialog from the first two trailers where you had to figure everything out with the visuals and songs.    I really wish RWBY would use this style more.  I think the parts of the show that have raised the most interest have been the quiet ones.  God bless"
RWBY,3dr6cy,IamMenace,4,Sat Jul 18 18:13:51 2015 UTC,"I thought the CCT was in Vale proper-makes more sense for accesssibility and they already have a contact in the library as Weiss said, right?"
RWBY,3dr6cy,safarispiff,3,Sat Jul 18 18:32:49 2015 UTC,This confused me as well but the wiki page shows that the CCT is on Beacon's campus.  The dance was in the large room where the new students slept in Volume 1 and the CCT wasn't too far.  Believe me this threw me off as well and I still think it makes more sense for the City of Vale to have the CCT and for Beacon to have the same ability in their library.    God bless
RWBY,3dr6cy,IamMenace,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:53:47 2015 UTC,Maybe Vale has their own CCTs and Beacon is just due to being surrounded by Nevermores.
RWBY,3dr6cy,safarispiff,2,Sat Jul 18 20:53:04 2015 UTC,No idea but I thought it made more sense for the city to have their own CCT and Beacon could just use the library.  Just seems out of place.  It does appear to be right next to the city but time and space appear to be bendable.   (Edit: Also before anyone says anything I'm talking about the tower not so much as the actual system.  The system is what I'd assume the library runs on also but I just mean the actual tower in the City of Vale)  God bless
RWBY,3dr6cy,IamMenace,2,Sat Jul 18 20:58:55 2015 UTC,"Maybe that is the main CCT for Vale. It could have been built near Beacon and connected to the city by a landline or line of sight radio. If it's more or less normal radio, there are many reasons to build it outside of the city. If it's more exotic, maybe there are reasons too. Or there simply may not have been enough space in Vale proper."
RWBY,3dr6cy,XCVGVCX,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:26:01 2015 UTC,"I'd also assume it's the main CCT for Vale as I think every kingdom will have one and then minor places like the academy's library you could use.  I just don't like the CCT being on Beacon's campus because it puts it fairly close to Junior's Club and the White Fang warehouse.    It's just the relative location that bothers me, not the lore behind it although I still think it makes more sense to be more in the city and not Beacon's campus.  (Edit: Just wanted to add that I know Beacon is a part of Vale it's just that I like to think of the two as some what separate entities)  God bless"
RWBY,3dr6cy,IamMenace,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:42:30 2015 UTC,"There is a map in a Roman clip.  I am fairly certain Beacon is separated from Vale City. Hence the need for an airship and the wide expanse before that, instead of using buses or parents driving them."
RWBY,3dr6cy,thebluehedgehog,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:59:49 2015 UTC,True but remember that Ruby and Penny went straight from the CCT which is on Beacon's campus straight to the city.  It would appear the campus is connected to the city and the water doesn't surround all of it.  God bless
RWBY,3dr6cy,IamMenace,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:04:27 2015 UTC,"No, I was suggesting that they were in Vale, given Ruby's reaction (she could have visited Beacon's tower whenever, but growing up on Patch would not have seen Vale's) and that the Beacon tower is part of the library and smaller."
RWBY,3dr6cy,thebluehedgehog,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:06:59 2015 UTC,"The tower in the dance episode wasn't as grand. It is possible that the dance was at the school and the building Cinder never ran across was the library, where the little school CCT is attached?  Recall Ruby's reaction to seeing the CCT in Vale."
RWBY,3dr6cy,thebluehedgehog,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:57:55 2015 UTC,"Nope it's the same, even the DVD commentary says the reason why they went to the CCT earlier was because of the scene with Cinder.  Cinder went to the CCT tower.  God bless"

Unfortunately I had forgotten everything, fortunately the tools are a lot better now than they were 9(!) years ago.  Anyway, this is barely scratching the surface of what is possible. You'll notice that other than names and faces, very little has actually changed. I still have to figure out how to do custom events/animations/maps/music/CG/etc, but for now I just want to see what you guys think."

RWBY,3dnptd,RasenShot2,2,Fri Jul 17 22:57:27 2015 UTC,It's just a recolor of existing characters.

Emergence was a sort of inverted self-insert following Team RWBY on Earth, and it was followed by Aliens Among Us, a sort of subverted high school AU. I'm very excited about Convergence- it's a lot of the bigger, bolder ideas that I've had in mind since the beginning of Emergence.  If Emergence was the sleeper hit and Aliens Among Us was the sequel that was more like a spinoff, Convergence is the big summer blockbuster (or at least it is in mind). Although I'd like you to do so for obvious reasons, you don't have to read Emergence or any of the related fics to read this one.

So here's the subpost I made, which has some relevant information for new readers.    Chris7221 is a fanfic author whose first big, popular (relatively—only a couple hundred favorites) fic was Emergence, which followed RWBY as they entered Earth one at a time. He finished this with the team getting contacted by a group called Gemstone, formed of agents from a couple intelligence services. This fic was followed by Aliens Among Us, showing WBY going through senior year at high school, Ruby as a sophomore, and plenty of character development. Along the way, he wrote a few other stories with related premises. Now, the RWBY thread is being tied together with two of the other fictions in Convergence. Probably updated weekly.  Other relevant links:   Emergence, the fic that started it all. Emergence Asides, side chapters. Aliens Among Us, the fic that continued it all. Tabula Rasa, starring an amnesiac New York cop who is most definitely not Ruby's mom. Those You Leave Behind, following JNPR through the plot of Volume 2. A bit too closely, arguably.

It's because it's pretty rad. So go and read it and be sucked into a fun and dramatic story.  Also looking into Arisen: For Those Who Stand by /u/Vicc125.

Writing   A Lone White Rose: White Rose University AU with a slight twist compared to similar stories. Not sure how much more I can say here. Unoriginal idea is unoriginal. (Just completed!) The Flight of a Rose: White Rose sci-fi AU where Ruby is a combat pilot fresh out of the academy and takes a high ranking post that Weiss believed she would be getting. The Rose Guardian: (Eventual) White Rose AU where Weiss is the Princess of Vale and is nearly assassinated. Ruby is then assigned as her personal guardian to protect her at all cost. The Path We Walk: Established White Rose (Do I need a life?) mercenary AU with Faunus Ruby. Weiss' father (surprise) doesn't approve of her relationship with Ruby, so they join a mercenary company to escape him. Can't say much more than that without major spoilers.   I also have a Victory Rose/Pyrruby/Milk and Cereal/Pole Control/whatever else the Pyrrha X Ruby ship's flavor of the day is that will be replacing A Lone White Rose in my roster now that LWR is done  Reading   Acceptance: Really good Victory Rose/Pyrruby/Milk and Cereal story. A rather slow burn, but is very good at displaying how the two could end up together. Millenial Rose: Sci-Fi AU written by BurningPeace that was inspired by my own Flight of a Rose. Only two chapters so far, but it's already incredibly action-packed. Fang's Embrace: White Rose in the canon universe with a Faunus!Ruby also by BurningPeace.

RWBY,3dl65b,ZipRush,4,Sat Jul 18 00:07:55 2015 UTC,"Stupid Witcher 3 taking up all my writing time... Sod it, here's the obligatory C&P that I missed last week.  WRITING:   Shadows of the Past    An OC fic that I started my RWBY writing with. The prologue (the linked chapter) needs a bit of reworking, but if you enjoy reading OC-centric fics, feel free to give it a look.  NOW ON HIATUS.  R.W.B.Y.: This Dying World    RWBYxS.T.A.L.K.E.R. crossover. The girls, now in their final year at Beacon, get introduced to the wondrous Chernobyl Exclusion Zone via strange portals popping up in Remnant. Will probably not contain enough Cheeki Breeki to satisfy most S.T.A.L.K.E.R. fans because sweet Christ above, that's one line of dialogue. Not a S.T.A.L.K.E.R. fan? Don't worry, I will explain anything I wind up referencing in the fic.      READING:   RWBY: Resolve by PrognisAldiev   An OC fic that takes place concurrently with the show from the point of view of Team RSOL (Resolve - I don't think the author knew about the colour rule when they started), with remarkably little overlap with the escapades of Team RWBY. It's written in third-person and has the typical shady-past OC, but it's interesting all the same. Updated within the past week.  Ten Little Hunters by /u/Uhh_ICanExplain   If you've seen Rooster Teeth's Ten Little Roosters, you don't need much explanation as to what this is about. If you haven't, TLR was a short weekly video series that RT did where the audience could play 'Whodunnit'. There were ten possible suspects and, week by week, they were slowly cut down until there were two left: the killer and the lone survivor. RT had prizes for whoever could correctly guess the killer and the survivor, with mini-prizes (as I recall) for correctly guessing the murder weapon and victim of the week. Explain is planning to run a similar system, but substituting our favourite Huntsmen and Huntresses into the equation instead.  Updated this month.  Dark to Light by /u/PartFootball   Part's pet fanfiction project, Dark to Light is effectively a rewrite of Volume 2 from V02E11 - 'No Brakes'. It is much darker than the episode it starts from, and, in his words, 'gets lighter'. I'll leave it up to the reader to determine how right he is. Likely on hiatus; last update was April.  Who We Are by /u/Samuel412   Blake is attacked by a Human-supremacist group. It gets darker from there; don't read if you are particularly attached to characters living. I don't think I can say much more without spoiling anything. Updated a few days back.  Children of the Hunt by /u/DekktheODST   The main eight of RWBY all got together and had kids (the hows are left ambiguous - does it really matter?) who are now attending Beacon Academy. That's basically it. The Grimm are still a threat, there's been a war, so all is not at peace. How does this leave the legacies of our favourites? Read and find out. Updated a few days back.  Remnant's Reclaimer by /u/HystericalCHijinks   In the future, Cinder wins. Team RWBY, undeterred, continue their fight, ending in a climactic street battle between Ruby and Roman &amp; Cinder. Ruby emerges victorious, but Cinder activates all of the Dust in her dress, creating a colossal explosion, driving Ruby ever-faster in an attempt to outrun the fireball. Eventually, Ruby hits 88 miles an hour and ends up in the dorm of Team RWBY eight years earlier. Now she must brace the first-year Team RWBY for a future she hopes they'll never have to endure. On hiatus? Last update was May.  Full Meta Redditors by /u/Challos   I started reading this as a favour to Kal, but don't take that as an indication of its quality. It's a meta-fic, so YMMV on how good it is, but the premise is explained and done away with in the first few chapters. Basically, Valve Software (creators of such games as Half-Life, Team Fortress and Portal; creators of the Steam content distribution service) created the ultimate VR simulator, and held a competition for one subreddit to have early access. The winning sub was /r/RWBY, and the members got dumped into a VR sim of Remnant. The point of view is Kal's, but it features your favourite RWBY characters (assuming that's Neo, so far) and /r/RWBY personalities, with special guest appearances by GabeN, alpacas and Shia LaBeouf. Yes, he's an actual cannibal. Yes, he wants you to stop singing the song and 'JUST, DO IT'. Now on hiatus until August 1 at the earliest."

Ruby is the main character and the story takes itself more seriously than the show.  The villains are more of a threat and it is not uncommon for the characters to get roughed up in fights.  I do my best to stay in the spirit of the show so there is no shipping, cursing, gore, or anything else that would not be found in the show.  I also do my best to keep the Christian symbolism and themes alive and try to capture the music as canon.  I love RWBY so I try to keep it as much like RWBY as possible.  God bless"

RWBY,3dl65b,Unjax,4,Fri Jul 17 07:30:20 2015 UTC,"80 000 words... This is going to take forever to catch up on. Oh well, hope its good! Starting it now."

RWBY,3dl65b,Leivve,4,Fri Jul 17 23:23:55 2015 UTC,"I've been slacking and haven't been keeping up with writing myself, but I have been helping /u/Zerotsu write his story Coin Toss. I've also been helping /u/lazerbear777 with his story Sanguine Nectar.  Haven't done much actual reading, but I did find a gem called Hey Jaune. A very good story about Ruby and Jaune being trapped underground having to wait for people to rescue them."
RWBY,3dl65b,DekktheODST,4,Fri Jul 17 05:32:49 2015 UTC,"Might as well do another thing.  Writing  Almost back off my busy schedule! Still, I've gotten some stuff out recently, and read a tiny bit  Vale Ghoul: Jaune lives in the world of Tokyo Ghoul, and is forced to conform to Ghoul thought. One of my favorite stories to write.   Grimm Eclipse: The Four Scythes: Now off Hiatus! The Rubys of the RT game come to life, shenanigans   Children of the Hunt: My 'masterpiece' according to /u/Spartacus400 (his copy pasta is incoming, just wait for it). Its about the Children of the characters we know and love. Its actually approaching its ending  Reading  /u/challos' many stories. He can link 'em  By /u/justaferret1, I'm reading a very very good OC story called The Macabre Very well written, feeling at home to the feeling of RWBY, yet breathing new life into it  Read Neo's long night, about second goddess' fears, very well done  May or may not be reading these two, since I sort of have a... thing for teachers.  I actually read a chapter of RR and maybe I can start The Games We Play. I keep saying I will, but I get a phone tomorrow, which means I can read it while I'm not working."
RWBY,3dl65b,thebluehedgehog,3,Fri Jul 17 12:24:55 2015 UTC,Neo's Long Night is great! I recommend RR too.  I am very behind on Ferret's.
RWBY,3dl65b,Samuel412,4,Fri Jul 17 16:35:45 2015 UTC,"I put out another chapter of Who We Are a couple of days ago. Probably the longest interim between chapters yet, which I'm not happy about. The story is nearing the end of the second act, so as it picks up speed I'll probably be more motivated to write.  If I don't have another chapter out by next Friday, feel free to yell at me to get back to work."
RWBY,3dl65b,Spartacus400,5,Fri Jul 17 15:59:11 2015 UTC,"Ahhhhh.  Another week, another fuck-off huge list.    Cracks fingers  Lets get to it.  Some minor cleaning and a couple new additions this week:    Reading:    Children of the Hunt-Dekk's masterpiece, which follows the lives of the current heroes' children.  Lots of drama and stuff happening now.  Eternity Rising Sequel to The Longest Night, it presents a different view of how Volume 2 turns out.  Part of /u/HolyOrdersOtaku's Shifting Remnant AU.  I definitely recommend it.  Check-Follows up with events after the Breach.  Teams RWBY and JNPR are accelerated to face a looming threat.  It finished up either last week or this week, and it was a pretty bittersweet ending.  The Gifts of War-/u/Challos' work.  Jaune gets in trouble, and now has to go through a video game simulator in order to return to Beacon.    The Meta Fic-It's the sub's meta fic.  Not much else really needs to be said.  It's gonna be fun on the bun!  Remnant's Reclaimer-The one and only.  Future Ruby runs so fast with her semblance, she travels back in time to when she was a freshman.  Armed with her knowledge, she intends to rewrite the future.  Definitely Top 5 of all the stories in the RWBY fandom.  Auburn-All the freshies get put through an incredibly difficult initiation that gains them access to a whole new academy.  One meant to train hunters solely to kill Grimm.  Got a Dark Knight pairing, which is always cool to see.  Hero of the Everyman-In my completely unbiased opinion, ha probably the best White Knight fic in the fandom.  Absolutely fantastic.  It finished up a couple weeks ago, but I still recommend it as it's a very well written fic.   Last Spark-Work by /u/Leivve that I'm intrigued by.  Set in the future with Ruby and Jaune married with a daughter.  However, Cinder has broken out of prison and torments Ruby and Jaune's family.  Friends, Again by /u/Uhh_ICanExplain.  I finally get to plug this again!  Jaune and Pyrrha's marriage falls apart and the two are kinda-sorta still friends.    The Games We Play-Last but certainly not least, we have the most expansive and, in my opinion, the best story in the RWBY fandom.  RWBY/The Gamer crossover.  Jaune is rejected from Signal, but finds out that his semblance is called the Gamer, allowing him to live his life as a video game character.  Jaune becomes incredibly badass because of this. Update:  Holy crap tonight's update could be big.  Like, REALLY big.  Like spoilers! big.    Beta reading:    A SW crossover that /u/safarispiff has not sent me anything new for.    /u/Vorox3 has yet to send me another chapter of LitD.    /u/Archont's Faces of Darkness-newest beta-read.  Will warn you now, it has an OC.  So if that's not your thing, don't read it.  I'm simultaneously helping him re-write the previous chapters as well as getting the new ones out there.  The first chapter is kinda meh, but most OC-based fics have a shitty first chapter.  Also needs to send me some stuff to edit.    Been editing a bit of /u/Leivve's Last Spark AU oneshots as well.  He may or may not have something else coming soonish, judging from his A/N on Treasure Hunter.  Didn't get anything for this week from him.  Methinks that's everything, minus the Meta Fic, which I MIGHT be beta-ing for.  Not sure yet, we'll see how everything goes.  Update:  I am indeed sorta beta-ing for the Meta Fic now.    NEW STORIES ADDED:    Chronicle by The Phantom Scribe:  WARNING:  Contains an OC, so if that's not your thing, give it a skip.  Not really sure how to describe this one without spoilers, but it's pretty well done so far, and I'm around halfway through it or so.    And I finally started reading The Petals Scatter Now by /u/IamMenace.  Novelized form of Volume 2.  Not much else really needs to be said on it, honestly.  This isn't a new story, but I completely forgot about putting it on the list.  The Warmth of Winter by RareNyte:  Jaune meets Weiss after she was in an airship crash, saves her from some White Fang that are chasing her, and has to imbibe blue Dust into his body to win.  He gains ice powers.    Read through A Knight, A Champion, A Rose by Whynoteh- It's a different take on most everything.  It sets up what is essentially a love triangle between Jaune, Pyrrha, and Ruby.  I'm almost through it, and I know it has a sequel.  FINALLY got around to reading The White Rose of Vermillion by Kuribayashi.  It's a Medieval AU where Yang is a blacksmith and Ruby is a Huntress who hunts animals for a living.  It's every bit as good as I've heard.    Now, for an odd one.  I devoured An Alternate Start and a Darker Hero.  However, the story was originally put up for adoption by You Are Right...Not.  It was adopted by MilitaryBarbie, and this is the link to the continuation.  The continuation picks up right after the final chapter of the original.  Link to the original.  Yes, the first chapter of the continuation is hard to read because of the constant misspelling of Jaune's name, but it's fixed by the next chapter.  I'm a sucker for stories where Jaune is actually a capable fighter, and the White Knight pairing just makes it that much better.  That being said, the adoptive author did NOT put the pairing in the story page, so I don't know if it will end up still happening.    Binged to get caught up on RWBY:  The Cost of the Creed by Dappere.  I'm not usually a big fan of crossovers, but I absolutely adore AC, and it's pretty well written.  It got updated yesterday too, which is always a plus.  New story from Super Saiyan Cyndaquil!!!  Spectrum is by SSC and /u/Jeffardi edits for it.  Basically, Jaune's sisters possess the 7 Sacred Arc Swords, which are supposed to be the most powerful swords in the world.  However, the swords have a soul, and an equivalent to aura, and they take over Jaune's sisters, who promptly destroy their hometown and murder their parents.  Now Jaune has to go about breaking their swords, since he had glyphs inscribed on his hands that can destroy them, to free his sisters from the swords' control.  Really good story so far.  Methinks that's everything.  Long list that is just getting longer."

RWBY,3dl65b,Jeffardi,1 point,Fri Jul 17 11:53:43 2015 UTC,"I did also name a sister or two and do a lot planning with Spectrum, but its hard to actually say what my relation to the story is. Technically I'm a creative assistant and editor, even though I only do a little editing... its more like I give my input to the direction of the story, as well as handle questions people pose on reddit whenever its mentioned since Cynd doesn't have a reddit account.   All rambling aside, thanks for reading the Spectrum; its only going to get crazier from here!"

I would seriously recommend it if someone wanted a new fan-fic to get into."

I have some newer projects started but not yet posted.  As always, I am open to the harshest criticism you can dole out.    Read:  Jaune's Cat is a maybe partial AU (depends on your strictness) where there is a such thing as combat pets and a kitten finds Jaune.  Laevinic Defeat is a Cinder/Pyrrha one-shot. Cinder, a tournament fighter manager, intends to sign a new client.  Bullet Rosettes What if Weiss couldn't sleep the first night at Beacon, and a nervous Ruby was using her time to train?

RWBY,3dl65b,DeAfro,3,Fri Jul 17 17:06:29 2015 UTC,"Writing  This story has two completed drafts and I'm still not happy enough with it to post.  Its a historical piece in the RWBY universe way back when arming Aura users with Dust based weaponry was considered ludicrous on all accounts.  I mean, what's the point of having a Aura user run around with a cannon the size of a house?  It is during this period that humans begin to explore the world and look for others like them.  What they find on a large island are tribes of human-like peoples (faunus?) who lived together with the Grimm.  Nobody yet knows of how these ""human Grimm"" came to be, but talk spreads of some demon magic that transforms humans into servants of Grimm.  What results is a war between the humans and these human Grimm where the human Grimm fights to defend their homeland and ensure the continued survival of their species.  Right now I'm experimenting with the third draft, a story that demands a skill in writing I do not yet possess.  I must know more about economics, politics, cultures, history, battle tactics, animal husbandry, logistics, and so much more."

Still writing edit The Pit, a story about RWBY trying to survive after being trapped in a pit full of dust augmented Grimm while Cinder leads an assault on Vale above ground (which JNPR is left to try and fend off).

The reason for the name is because ""striking a box"" is/used to be a common phrase for announcing a structure fire amongst fire departments. The story is set after graduation from Beacon. It features Team RWBY, as well as Ren, fighting fires as volunteers. There are many different focuses and plot points in the story, ranging from the history of the Schnee family to the personal lives of Team RWBY and Team JNPR (minus Spoiler) as well as the complicated history, politics, and operations of the combination (paid and volunteer) fire-rescue-EMS service in Vale City.  The Rise and Fall of the Authoritarianist Party of Vacuo Ever wondered how the Faunus War started? Ever wondered what war Ozpin fought in? Ever wondered why faunus were sent to the Menagerie? Here you go. This is partially based off of ""The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich"" by William Shirer. In this, a Great War veteran named Gris Manchette becomes the chancellor of Vacuo, strips the king of his power, and consolidates all power under his thumb. He also starts one of the worst campaigns of genocide and ethnic cleansing in Remnant history."

Reading-wise, I love the story Team AMBR: Finding Redemption. It's an oc team that follows the main story of the show, but it still has its own story weaved in. One of the main characters, Joel Ambrose, is a former member of the Red Hand, which is the human version of the White Fang, and after a bit of negotiation after he is ""captured"", he winds up at Beacon as what the author calls an Indentured Huntsman, which I kinda liken to the Enforcers of Psycho-Pass, and is partnered up with a sadistic dog faunus with a love of explosives."

RWBY,3dkrr5,Lochen9,2,Fri Jul 17 20:22:21 2015 UTC,"Well, so far we know of 6 Semblances total, and really only understand 4, maybe 5 of them.   Ruby's Speed, Weiss' Glyphs, Blake's Shade's, Yang's Rage, Pyrrha's Polarity, and (maybe) Sun's Astral Projection. The vast majority of Semblances are a complete mystery."
RWBY,3dkrr5,zombie_doodle,1 point,Fri Jul 17 07:04:56 2015 UTC,There's also Jaune's 'super healing' or 'force field of light' but we don't really know anything for sure about it.

RWBY,3dkrr5,ThePrinceOfFear,2,Sat Jul 18 16:18:13 2015 UTC,I think it has something to do with her sigil having stitches. Something along the lines of Stein's magical sutures from Soul Eater?
RWBY,3dkrr5,complexevil,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:02:11 2015 UTC,Her semblance causes people to love her for no reason at all. Only racists like cardin are immune.

RWBY,3dkwsd,ScalierLemon1,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:40:54 2015 UTC,Honestly I wouldn't mind if their alternate outfits became their main style.  Blake's main has always looked a little odd to me especially her leggings being connected to her vest.  I'd also like for her to wear more black as a counter balance to Weiss.  I think Ruby wears more black actually.  I can't think of anything else I'd like the characters to wear personally as this isn't something I really think of.  As I said the only character I wouldn't mind changing styles is Blake and I think she'd look good in a black jacket and overall a darker style.  Somewhat random but on topic I think Ruby should wear her hood more while in combat.  I think it's a great way to show she's getting serious and keeps her face hidden from both the audience and opponents.  I wouldn't mind if that just became a standard for her.  God bless

RWBY,3deiah,miketcraig,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:48:04 2015 UTC,"From what I see there, you don't need any more drafts. That's an amazing cosplay. Seriously, the only way I could think to make it better would be to invent contacts that change color when you blink."
RWBY,3deiah,Badargel,4,Wed Jul 15 17:57:56 2015 UTC,"Thank you. But I'm seriously so proud of my updated version its driving me crazy to not be able to show it off. Plus, I forgot to wear my belts the day I had this picture taken. Smh.  And the parasol is soooo much better now. The colors are more accurate, I hand painted all of the metal parts black, and it has all that crazy red scrollwork."

RWBY,3deiah,Chuloon,3,Wed Jul 15 18:23:50 2015 UTC,"There is polychromatic paint for vehicles. Google is working on contacts that measure blood sugar. If the blood sugar can communicate and have some circuitry is it possible that way, or just ones that vary the colour based on blood pressure or light like mood rings. Set the base colour for one as pink, the other brown, and fear response could trigger to white. Minor normal changes swap the lens from pink or brown to the other, hence an erratic but mood-based change less specific than blinking."

In truth, I'm even less than that, as I have no way of knowing if your English sounds like Swedish to me, or if your alphabet is actually Cyrillic, where as I see the phonetic. In truth, we will never have complete understanding of wether or not the information we exchange with one another is the same as what we think that person will percieve. But to try and dumb this down a bit more for now just consider me a string of light particles coming into contact with your retinas to which your brain configures into data that you are capable of comprehending.   A Blake is slightly different yet also the same to this form that I am currently inhabiting, however as long as there are differences between the two of us, it cannot be that I am a Blake.

RWBY,3dh2a8,ChewyNipple,6,Thu Jul 16 05:27:55 2015 UTC,"Hated it.  Immensely.  Hear me out though, it has a happy ending.  I was only watching it for the same reason people watch bad horror movies: I was bored, home alone on a Friday evening in my sweatpants with no plans, no ambition, and needed an excuse to shame-eat an entire bag of microwave popcorn.  So I picked it more or less at random because I felt like ""Some Stupid Anime Shit"" might be fun to heckle to death, while trying to ignore the sad state of my Friday night.  And heckle it I did.  I was merciless to the art and animation style, likening it to ""something a broken PlayStation 2 might crap out.""  I laughed at the unfolding scythe in the first scene like ""HAH yeah.  That's physically possible..."".  I Had to give a nod of approval to the fight between Cinder and Glynda, that was just some cool mage-on-mage action.  I gave Ruby nothing but abuse at how useless she was in that whole encounter.  I had to give another nod of approval to Glynda's ""pat on the bad slap on the wrist"" line.  Sometimes all it takes to keep you going is one likable character.  This went on for some time.  I cursed the physics.  I cursed the juvenile themes.  I cursed the tired and obvious characters.  Adorable underdog main character, rotten rich-bitch, aloof goth loner, bumbling dorky dude, hyperactive happy older sister who's obviously the lead's surrogate mother to replace the one they both lost at a young age, blah bah blah bah.  I cursed the tired high school theme.  The only character I liked from the start was Glynda.  I HATED JAUNE.  I hated everything about him.  I hated his obvious placement as the 'relatable dork' and 'love interest to the lead character'.  I groaned endlessly at the interaction between Weiss and Ruby when they teamed up in the forest.   I remember my tuning point clearly.  The nevermore fight.  By the grace of god, the nevermore fight.  Suddenly things started clicking into place.  I giggled at the heart on Nora's grenade and the sadistic smile on her face as she fired it.  Laughed my ass off at Jaune's ""no no No No NO!"" as Nora launched him across the gap against his will (screw that guy anyway).  I enjoyed the rapid-fire teamwork on the fledgling team JNPR taking down the Deathstalker.  (Nora's adorable face and giggle as she's flying through the air gets special mention) I actually stood up and 'whooped' when Ruby cut the head off the Nevermore.  Suddenly, inexplicably, I was hooked.  Ruby was right, no more awkward smalltalk or getting to know you stuff indeed.  This wasn't gonna be another tired magical girl in high school anime crapfest.  I had stumbled on something of a spectacle.  I watched it all.  In one sitting.   I watched it again the next day, in one sitting.  I had found something I loved."
RWBY,3dh2a8,RealityVeil,3,Thu Jul 16 11:01:57 2015 UTC,"That's a great story! Before I ever watched RWBY I always thought anime looked dumb, but after I watched the first episode, I knew there was no going back for me."
RWBY,3dh2a8,Wingnut00,3,Thu Jul 16 17:36:24 2015 UTC,"Heard the name dropped a few times here and there, but it wasn't until in an unrelated video that I heard ""I burn"" that I started to ask myself ""Just what is this RWBY anyway?"". A couple searches later and with some basic understanding and the knowledge that the guy who made Haloid was making this, I watched Vol. 1 on YouTube and finished a few days before episode 1 of Vol. 2 came out.  I was hooked enough, though the Vol. 1 episode length bothered me a bit, but when you marathon something, that is rarely an issue. Vol. 2 cemented my interest in the franchise and story as a whole along with the characters and their roles to be played."

I was suddenly quite interested when I saw the RoosterTeeth logo and eve more interested as I heard Jen Taylor narrating. Then Roman's walking animation happened and i lost a lot of my interest. I laughed Ruby was all like ""Are you... robbing me? and ""Ohh..."" And then it immediately hooked me when she unfolded Crescent Rose. My first thought was ""Woah that's a big ass scythe! That's awesome!"" I proceeded to watch both volumes on netflix back to back with no brakes... hehe.  I didn't watch the trailers until like a week later."

RWBY,3dh2a8,DrAmishMD,2,Thu Jul 16 17:02:30 2015 UTC,"Very first time? Someone at my university's science-fiction-etc club came in Ruby csoplay and showed the Red Trailer. I promptly forgot about it; the show looked like a stupid mindless action show.  Some time later, a bunch of people on Bay12 who I knew from a sorta-magic-girl forum game (long story—multi-thousand-page, in fact) were talking about RWBY and suggested I watch it. I did, and didn't like it. A bit later, I watched it again, and liked it more. Then I watched the trailers, recognized the Red Trailer, and wondered why Blake being a faunus counts as a spoiler when they practically stated it in the Black Trailer.  (Speaking of Blake, another fun fact about my first time watching RWBY is that I didn't realize she had a bow until the end of episode 15. I didn't have high expectations for the texturers due to the silhouettes, so when I saw Blake flash by in the closing credits of Episode 1, I though ""Oh, it's a catgirl, like those animal-people on the news"" and moved on. This made Weiss seem like much more of a jerk.)  Anyways, I eventually joined the RWBY forums, only to be reviled once I dared to share my opinions on Volume 2 and reply to people who argued with me. (I haven't gone there since an ASoIaF game I was in fell through.) I found this subreddit, and am much happier here."
RWBY,3dh2a8,Odin_Crusades,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:41:47 2015 UTC,"Saw the title while browsing Netflix. Remembered my cousin going on and on about how I should watch this show that had a bunch of girls with ridiculously over-sized melee weapons that were also guns. Specifically remembered hearing the phrase ""Nora is crazy."" Decided to give it a go.  First reaction was ""huh, this animation style is a bit odd, but I can dig it."" It didn't take long for me to get used to it and start enjoying the story. As far as entertainment goes, I'm very easy to please, so I never once stopped to analyze the show and dissect it for its faults. I just saw kickass fight sequences, goofy comedy, and likable characters. End result was ""this show is pretty great.""  Finished the first season in one sitting, then I finished the second the following day after I spent the whole day with the show on my mind."
RWBY,3dh2a8,NeoMegaRyuMKII,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:38:32 2015 UTC,"I watched the first season up until the penultimate episode on Youtube, when I didn't know about RT's site getting the episode early. Similar to you, all the trailers and available episodes.   I was unsure at first, but watching Ruby beat up the henchmen and learning more about Remnant, I started to get into it. And thanks to the discussion threads, fics and art that have been shared on this sub, I'm (possibly too much so) a fan."
RWBY,3dh2a8,GreatWyrmGold,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:44:07 2015 UTC,"Pretty fucking awesome.   I first ""started"" shortly before the first episode came out (I might be mistaken but I am pretty sure I am not). My friend (who is a much bigger RT fan than I am) showed me the Red trailer. At the time I didn't think much of it but only because I had a headache so it didn't register.  Shortly before or shortly after vol2 started, my friend showed me the Red trailer again. This time I was feeling perfectly fine. When the first notes played I instantly remembered the tune. My friend said something about it being really distinctive. He then sent me a (now dead) Youtube link to a full version of vol1 (compiled into 1 video, not DVD format). Watched it in one night.  And then of course vol2 happened and I watched it as it came.   At some point my friend and I discussed what ""our"" weapons would be in Remnant. I said mine would be a ball-and-chain weapon (similar to the kind we see in Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess), but like most weapons in Remnant, it has a secondary form. In this form, the steel ball travels to the bottom and is attached to my left hand, effectively becoming a spiked boxing glove (which can retract the spikes and shoot dust, obviously) and the neck of the weapon is used as a whip in my right hand."
RWBY,3dh2a8,IamMenace,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:45:57 2015 UTC,"That's badass! For my weapon, (although I love Ember Celica) I would want a dual-scimitar format but the handles would be guns (kinda like Gambol Shroud). Then, I would hold the swords with the handles so I would basically have big sword-claws. Fanboying is so fun!"

I checked my subscriptions and saw a new video from RT so I naturally clicked on it.  The animation grabbed me instantly and the music was fantastic.    Before I even knew her name Ruby became my favorite character and I instantly wanted to know who's grave site that was and their relationship.  Seeing her three crosses also brought a smile to her face and I'm happy to see so many Christian themes/symbols in the show.  After the trailer it hit me that there would be three more trailers and I couldn't wait.  I caught on to the fact that each color matched the lyrics to the song so I like everyone else had my own head canons, which for the most part were correct.   Volume 1 did have a bit too much hype and it did surprise me with its over reliance on tropes, school setting, and so much dialog but I still really enjoyed the season and characters.  Now its one of my favorite shows and I'm waiting for the next volume.   God bless"

An anime that has only the dub version?  I watched the episode and my first impressions was Another magical girl show with transformations and stuff like that but with actually cool weapons for once? I was really waiting for the moment when they transformed. Then I met Jaune and thought Oh! The love interest of the main girl. He looks average. Yep, totally love interest.  It was right after that I realized that it only had two episodes but it caught my interest so I searched a bit more about it.  Then I found the trailers and realized how messed up my impression was. I started to get more into it because the more I compared it to common cliche anime, the more I realized how far away it felt from it.

So I saw the Red Trailer, and it looked like it could've been a preview for some anime JRPG. And then when Ruby pulled out that sniper rifle, my jaw dropped, and then when it transformed into a scythe, it dropped even more. I was beyond amazed. I was totally in awe. Here I was, watching other anime like Attack on Titan at the time, and never in my life have I ever seen such a beautiful animation style made by a guy who I'd never heard of before at the time, who I eventually came to immediately admire after discovering the wonderful world he had in store for us.

Fast forward to a few months ago, and that memory just randomly popped into my head after binging on Sword Art Online. I remembered talk about Monty and RWBY because I used to watch the RT podcast every once in a while, along with all of the animated shorts.  After a few minutes of curious searching, I found the Red trailer again... then let it continue playing the other 3 trailers... Then swapped over to Netflix to watch the entirety of Volume 1. The very next day, I finished Volume 2 as well.   I had heard of Monty's passing before binge-watching both Volumes, but at the time, I unfortunately didn't really comprehend what exactly was so special about RWBY.

RWBY,3def3i,Vexzal,2,Wed Jul 15 17:18:50 2015 UTC,"Heh, considering my post is essentially a troll joke itself, I think it is hilarious ;P  I wouldn't get too worked up over it :D"
RWBY,3def3i,Vexzal,0,Wed Jul 15 19:11:44 2015 UTC,"I don't know, It's pretty funny, and calling the regulars around here trolls because your asking them to do something in a manner that contributes nothing to the information pool that wasn't already available is harsh and unnecessary. People are going to spell Pyrrha wrong, and this post was obviously going to help no one. It's not really that big of a deal."
RWBY,3def3i,Vexzal,3,Wed Jul 15 17:21:55 2015 UTC,"First, I didn't ask anyone to do shit. You see my name on this post? Second, this started as a joke between /u/realityrush and I about the epidemic of all the different spellings of ""Pyrrha"" and I jokingly said something to the effect of ""We need a sticky post or PSA or something!"" And he made this post.   Anyway, when I see trolling I call it trolling doesn't matter if you're a regular or a goddamn mod. I didn't exactly say it in a derogatory way either, mind you. Just that the jokes were weak.  Now, if you're finished, kindly fuck off."

It's people joking around, and there is a large difference there. The post itself was very lighthearted and jokey, and people responded in kind, LIKE THEY NORMALLY DO. If you don't find them funny, fine I'm sorry. But my contention isn't the post, it's your calling them trolls on context-less basss, and not just saying people were trolling, but that people were trolls. I'm not going to fuck of, because threw an insult and slander against all the people who were already in the thread in that lighthearted who cares it's the internet kind of manner I thought we were above in this community."
RWBY,3def3i,Thryr373,3,Wed Jul 15 17:35:44 2015 UTC,"You misinterpreted what I meant and I honestly couldn't care less whether you get this or not. Read what I said again. Although it came out extremely dry, those were also lighthearted insults. I go back and forth with /u/ProbablyHeretical all the time. That doesn't mean I think any less of him or anything else for that matter. And if I was really trying to ""slander"" anyone, calling someone a troll is a pretty weak insult. And by doing so, I invited those I called ""trolls"" with ""weak jokes"" an open invitation to come at me.  The only person I took any real offense to was you after you rode in on your high horse for an imagined slight.   Anyway, hopefully that clears things up for you. If it doesn't, I don't care. But, i'm done with this conversation."

You'd gather data on economic well being, spending habits, cultural output, health, productivity, marriages, divorces, death and birth rates as well as more detailed surveys from businesses, individuals, psychologists, and schools. You'd even want to do stuff like picking random pictures of crowds from surveillance cameras to count the number of smiling people at any given moment of time. Doing this would give you some idea of the levels of happiness and a geographic basis for where people feel happy and where they feel less happy.  This is very important data to be collecting because Grimm are attracted to negative emotion.  With this data you would be able to predict the time, location, and possibly severity of Grimm attacks and prepare by either taking steps to alleviate unhappiness or to shore up defenses and hasten response times.  With further examination using the Happiness Index as a basis, you could even potentially do research into finding out the TYPE of negative emotion that is most prominent in an area and seeing if that has an effect on the type or number of Grimm it attracts."

First, there are a lot of anatomy errors that could be remedied by using references (various poses) - Blake's leg, Weiss's left arm, and Pyrrha's right arm are the ones that stand out the most to me. Second, the coloring is both weirdly flat due to misplaced shadows and oddly 3D where the shadows are done right. And third, everyone, including the male characters who are generally more bulky due to musculature, has the same waifish body shape - which again, can be remedied by using references (of different body shapes)."

Shameless flirt. Blake: A few beers with her friends.  It's more about friends and compatriots than booze. Weiss: Claims to stick to fine wines and classy liquors, but has been known to unwind and get crazy with Yang from time to time.  Gets mad if you bring it up.  After a particularly crazy night out with Yang, she woke up from a blackout drunk curled up in Ruby's bed.  Nothing 'happened', but no one dares speak of it. Ruby: No real preferences, but tears into anything you put in front of her with gusto.  She's just WAY TOO STOKED for a night out with the girls.  Yang ends up carrying her home.  Every time.   JNPR:   Nora: Huge flagons of beer.  Gets crazy drunk and bounces around happily.  Drunk cuddler (you know the type). Pyrraa: Mix master extraordinaire!  Makes something called ""Pyrrha Juice.""  No one has a clue what she puts in it, but it's ambrosia in booze form.   Jaune: Not terribly comfortable around alcohol and generally doesn't drink, but he will get crazy on the Pyrrha Juice.  Doesn't take much until he's totally trashed.  The good news is, he's a ""cute, stumbly drunk"".  Tends to mumble ""I love you guys...."" a lot when he's over the line. Lie: Classy as f*ck cognacs and whiskies.  Fine wines.  Lie is a man of few words, strong actions, and exquisite tastes.   Some of the Supporting Cast:   Doctor Oobleck: Vodka and Redbull.  Excessively. Headmaster Ozpin: Kalua and Coffee, though he'd never admit it.  Sticks to fine, aged whiskies in public.  Occasionally adds a shot of the good stuff to his coffee if it's a particularly rough day.  Ever wonder why he wanted to ""keep it brief"" in the welcoming ceremony?

Say, if she were to stub her toe or bang her shin while stumbling around, chasing after an out of control Ruby. Weiss: When drunk, Weiss' semblance can be...unpredictable.  Her runes may autotrigger on an emotional outburst.  Especially if that outburst has something to do with a steel mug flying uncontrollably around the room at high speed.  Pyrrha needed stitches.
