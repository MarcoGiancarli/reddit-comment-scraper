After seeing what it's all about I decided to apply for engineer. They sent me to their school and trained me. That's where the real money is made. No, I'm not a conductor."
ThatPeelingFeeling,3a16mj,srdyuop,3,Tue Jun 16 16:49:35 2015 UTC,That's pretty interesting. They probably have stricter requirements for hiring now than they used to be. It doesn't seem common for places to pay for school and training for employees now.
ThatPeelingFeeling,3a16mj,lachryma,4,Tue Jun 16 17:00:14 2015 UTC,That's true to an extent. The training required is obviously very specialized and there aren't many outside programs (other than a few exceptions).  The major U.S. Railroads all have their own schools and training centers.
ThatPeelingFeeling,3a16mj,rebo2,5,Tue Jun 16 17:05:29 2015 UTC,I didn't know that! How interesting :) thank you for sharing

ThatPeelingFeeling,39r9jl,grindhawk,1 point,Sat Jun 20 14:39:05 2015 UTC,The tread wears down and people throw the tires away because it becomes illegal to drive on them.

ThatPeelingFeeling,39p9w4,adamrulesurface,1 point,Sat Jun 13 22:45:10 2015 UTC,"Couldn't you flip the glue disc over and play it? It would be the inverse and backwards of the record right? I'm not actually sure how records work, but wouldn't that make a pretty weird copy if the record? Someone please post results!"
ThatPeelingFeeling,39p9w4,jekrump,5,Sat Jun 13 21:17:51 2015 UTC,"Sort of, but probably not how you're thinking (I assume you're expecting a coherent, though vastly different sound than the record).    A record needle travels in a long continuous valley or groove in the record.  The needle picks up vibrations from both sides of the groove and amplifies it to two tracks, left and right.  (Yes, this is simplified, but basic record theory).  Assuming the peaks and valleys in the record are the same distance apart (peak-peak=valley-valley, which is not the case, the peaks are wide and flat, while the valleys are narrow and steep) then you would have an inverse copy of the record.  However, because the needle travels in the valley (groove) of the record and gets signal from the shape of the valley, each side of the valley (slope if you will) has different shapes that correspond roughly to right and left tracks.  When you take the glue disc off, what is now the bottom of a valley was the peak on the record.  Think of the record in terms of the peak instead of the valley.  Each side (slope) of the peak has different signal, not just right and left, but most notably one side of the peak has audio from one full rotation later than the other side of that peak.  On a 33 rpm record, this equates to a little less than 2 seconds difference.  This becomes the valley on the glue disc.  When you play the glue disc, your left speaker and right speaker will have audio from different time points in the record, and the audio wave would be inverted.  A properly fitted signal processor could read this inverse wave and reverse it, effectively playing the audio.  An inverted audio track can sound much like the original, though there are some advanced theory reasons that it's not the same.  Also, assuming you're thinking of a normal record player, the needle would start in the middle of the record and play the whole thing backward from the end of the last song to the beginning of the first song. Some specialty DJ and professional record players can reverse the direction of rotation, but they require special needles that can be run both directions through the groove.  Most standard record players (and needles) lack this functionality.  If you had such a player and needle, you could run it in reverse and play the record from beginning to end.  Add the signal inverter and a 60/33-second delay on one channel, and you might have a decent facsimile of the original recording.  The hardness of the glue would have a significant bearing on the quality of the copy.  Wax records, the way flat records used to be made, actually used this theory to record.  In one method, the needle on a recorder would cut the groove into a semi-hard wax record, which was then cast using a similar process to the glue in the video, but then the glue was much harder than the wax when it dried. So the wax was peeled away from the reverse image, and that was used to ""stamp"" a vinyl record.  With advances in technology they were able to eliminate a step and make the wax the inverse image from the start and use it to make a master.  Of course this process is very complex and much more in depth than I can explain here, I'll try to find a cool demonstration of wax recording.  The process of cutting a wax record was mostly perfected with wax cylinders, so by the time they got to discs, much of the trial-and-error of wax cutting and casting was already done, and records advanced through the stages from wax impressions to needle-cut vinyl very quickly.  TL;DR... So if you had a really wide needle and just took the glue as is and put it on the record player and dropped the needle on the edge, it wouldn't play because the needle would fall into the gutter track because it's spinning the wrong way.  If you drop the needle in the middle, it would play, but you'd have a strange anomaly of a backward-playing phase-reversed audio signal with the left and right channels being offset by some 1.8 seconds.  But a needle that wide wouldn't have the responsiveness of a thin needle.  I'm sure I've thoroughly confused you by now.  Edit1:  added picture of the needle close up Edit2:  added clarification to the wax part."

You'll find more screws holding the display onto the case. Take those off.  Then you disconnect the cable, put the new lcd and the rebuild it.  It's not too hard, but it does take a bit of time. Specially of it's your first time.      All laptops are different. So finding a guide that explains what you'll find and how much you need to take apart from the bottom portion would be ideal."

A mousepad enhances the usability of the mouse compared to using a mouse directly on a table by providing a surface to allow it to measure movement accurately and without jitter. Some mousepads increase ergonomics by providing a padded wrist rest.

My wife, who's also a peel aficionado, mentioned that it wasn't cool for him to peel it for me. He answered ""I peel every phone, I didn't think people cared about that"".  That'd learn him if I returned it simply for peel privileges though, right?"
ThatPeelingFeeling,379qk8,IzzyinBlue,20,Tue May 26 03:07:28 2015 UTC,"Lmao that's awesome that your wife called him out. And ya, return it and then buy them same phone again haha. But even on a more serious note, aside from losing out on the opportunity on peeing something (which, to be honest, they come few and far in between), a lot of people like to keep it on until they find a case and/or screen protector that they like. He has potentially set in motion a series of events that will leave you with a damaged phone!"
ThatPeelingFeeling,379qk8,pikameta,6,Tue May 26 03:12:43 2015 UTC,It's probably a sales tactic to get you to buy covers and screen protectors before you leave the store.

ThatPeelingFeeling,379qk8,WastingOurYouth,7,Tue May 26 03:12:58 2015 UTC,"Galaxy S4. I work in construction and I'm pretty tough on my phones, so I didn't want to put out too much money or get anything very far ahead of the curve, just something new to me. My old LG was awful, so painfully slow.  90% of my phone use is calls, texting and maps to my next jobsite, and so far I'm pretty happy with it, even if my phone could be like, 2 S's better. As to your other comment, he actually did try to upsell me a case and screen protector when I mentioned my line of work, but I managed to keep my last phone in decent shape over 3 years so I passed on them.  Like I said in the review, he was actually a really good rep, just not cool that he peeled."
ThatPeelingFeeling,379qk8,teejay769,4,Tue May 26 03:25:17 2015 UTC,"Since you work in construction, I think an S4 Active would have been more apt, as it's IP-67 certified dust and water resistant, and basically built to be thrown about.

I've sold thousands of phones now and not one person has expressed any interest in unwrapping or peeling it. I don't understand that. Also, if you're going to return the phone you'll probably have to pay a restocking fee since the shop can't resell the phone now."

ThatPeelingFeeling,37a3wx,Bacon_Hammers,1 point,Fri May 29 15:00:08 2015 UTC,"I have to admit it was a bit larger than I expected for a mid case. As far as noise cancellation, it's still a far cry better than what I had, which was a very flimsy xigmatek aluminum case I got for $15.  It's pretty heavy, since it's a steel case, and I think the noise cancelling material adds to it. Overall, I'm really liking it because of the simple design as well as the dust covers, but yeah, it's definitely not a LAN-party friendly case at all.  Fractal mainly makes steel cases, but IMO, if you want a light, sturdy case with decent sound dampening, check out Lian-Li cases. They're a bit spendy, but it's one of those situations of ""you get what you pay for""."

ThatPeelingFeeling,36kirc,Profnemesis,1 point,Wed May 20 18:52:37 2015 UTC,Yeah you have to read the checkboxes carefully instead of just clicking next next next. They legally have to ask you if you want to install extra software. People need to learn to uncheck the boxes and read the little checkmarks. I've seen people even get a McAfee ani virus install when installing flash because they didn't u check the option when you are at the official download Web page.

ThatPeelingFeeling,3327l6,Catabisis,2,Sun Apr 19 12:27:11 2015 UTC,I would guess scratch protection and maybe some concern about light damaging the plastic? Though that seems a little unnecessarily cautious. It could also be to hide what the car looks like
ThatPeelingFeeling,3327l6,askeeve,2,Sun Apr 19 12:37:13 2015 UTC,"Having a hard time understanding your question. I'm assuming you're asking why the person in the gif was pealing plastidip off of the light, as opposed to having taped off the light prior to dipping the car. If that's your question, then it's because it's easier and less time consuming this way, since you can just peal off the rubber from parts that have a gap between the body and the part."
ThatPeelingFeeling,3327l6,PoundTownUSA,0,Mon Apr 20 10:57:23 2015 UTC,That is what I was asking. Plastidip is great for dipping tools and fishing lures. Why was the car being dipped?

Years if you want? What about for a rustproof undercoating? How do you thin it for spraying? Thanks for answering my questions. I am really intrigued."
ThatPeelingFeeling,3327l6,Catabisis,6,Mon Apr 20 11:53:20 2015 UTC,"I don't have access to a spraying machine, so I just used spray cans bought at a hardware store. Due to this it was actually a lot of hard work, and sore forearms. This took me three days and about 20 cans to get 6 thin coats on a mid sized sedan. However, a company called Dip Your Car sells gallons of the stuff for a sprayer. There's nothing needed to thin it for spraying. I believe you can use just any sprayer out there, but this company sells stuff designed specifically for plastidip. I'm sure with care and attention to detail it could last for extended periods of time and according the the websites faq, it could potentially last up to three years. There's no need for an undercoat because you spray right over the existing paint without need to scuff or otherwise prep besides cleaning the car. It doesn't damage the paint, so it can just be peeled to go right back to the way you bought it."

ThatPeelingFeeling,2zmspu,HybridM,2,Fri Mar 20 10:18:01 2015 UTC,"I have the most recent ipv2, I've never had any problems with it other than the sensor fire switch popping off but thats okay because you can turn that off."
ThatPeelingFeeling,2zmspu,HybridM,1 point,Fri Mar 20 15:05:20 2015 UTC,Ipv2x then? It goes ipv2 then ipv2s then ipv2x. This is the 2s where you can turn it on an off too.

I went through hell and came out the other side because I just got used to it; if I ever have to use one like that again I would spare no expense until I got one that worked because god it sucked  Edit: Also the power button eventually stopped working so I had to start using the cable to restart it, and by the end of it's life even that was barely hanging on"

Whenever I sell a phone or set up a new one for a customer it's always my privilege to peel the plastics Off the box, phone , charger cables, etc.   In this particular case I was setting up a new phone for live display and demoing. We sold out of our LG G3's and the display model was sold. When the new lot of the LG G3's arrived I was setting this one up for demoing."

If it comes with a screen protector that has no advertisements, information, or plastic blocking the ports it's recommended that you leave it on. The Galaxy s5 has one on there that I leave on for customers, but there is plastic all over other parts that I straight away take off."

ThatPeelingFeeling,2xghtc,Booler,2,Sat Feb 28 14:46:58 2015 UTC,"Seriously, that heatsink was much larger than I thought it would be. And even with its size, the fans are quiet as hell.  I mean, this new computer is so quiet, I can hear my tinnitus again. I have to turn on my fan so I have some background noise, or I won't be able to fall asleep."
ThatPeelingFeeling,2xghtc,SirSmokesAlott,1 point,Sat Feb 28 15:38:50 2015 UTC,Turn your pc off! Leaving the pc on overnight is bad for the pc in the way that a lot more dust will be able to get in over night and the fans bearings will wear down faster as they do naturally over time of normal use. the hard drive will also get hotter and will start having problems sooner. When I got my first pc in 2000 I left it on every day and the fans and the dust was crazy I didn't start turning off my computer builds until 2009 when I realised how bad it is for computers all my builds that were left on overnight had a very short life (2 years max).   If you can't bare to shut down at least set it into hibernation mode after so many hours being inactive. and it will be same as shutting down but all your stuff will still be open when it wakes up.
ThatPeelingFeeling,2xghtc,n3x_,2,Sat Feb 28 19:15:54 2015 UTC,"So long as you are using quality fans, you shouldn't have to worry about this for a very long time. It's true that the fans will eventually wear down, but if they're wearing down within 2 years, that's way too soon; even with the computer running 24/7.  My previous build was using a case with aftermarket fans that I replaced myself. The case and fans were from the build before that one, so about 8 years old and they were running perfectly. The reason they were loud was because the fans were physically damaged by an abusive ex. If it were not for that, they would likely still be running perfectly today.  As far as dust goes, so long as you're diligent about dusting out your machine regularly, you'll be fine. Any builder worth their salt has plenty of canned air nearby, so that's not an issue."

Maybe your family doesn't have to budget their heating bill and good for them but once you have your own array of bills to pay you'll think twice before cranking that thermostat."

ThatPeelingFeeling,2tauop,xixtoo,7,Fri Jan 23 01:41:47 2015 UTC,"Stupid question: do the arrows indicate proper direction to peel, or apply?  Less stupid question: how easy is it to get a section to come off as a contiguous piece?"
ThatPeelingFeeling,2tauop,LeibnizIntegralKeks,8,Thu Jan 22 17:39:33 2015 UTC,"I asked the exact same question when I started! :P it must be something to do with applying it, we get the sheets of stainless steel from the head factory in Belgium.  At first it was pretty tricky but you get the hang of it, we put a heater inside for about an hour so the PVC comes off nice and easy! I can get very large sections off in one piece but its easier to cut it into sections."
ThatPeelingFeeling,2tauop,shoangore,4,Thu Jan 22 18:13:01 2015 UTC,Maybe the marks are just there as an aid to manufacturing? It's a lot easier to tell if a part is oriented the right way if it has big arrows all over it that are clearly visible from a distance.

(especially if its a 4k monitor)  I opted for it because the way I have it setup, it is mounted to a pole which is mounted to my bed, so I can't have multiple monitors. I opted for 1 larger monitor which has snap so it can be like having 1, 2, 3 or even 4 monitors with no bezels.  I mainly game and trade stocks and watch movies.  Gaming is incredible on it. You can see so much. Much more immersive."

I was struggling for a while if I was going to buy it or not because I wasn't sure how often I would use shades like that. I'd say it's worth it since it can be more versatile than you'd expect at first glance.   I wish I didn't peel V3 because that shadow fallout in that is ridiculous but I just had to.

""The surface of frosted glass is etched so that when it is struck by light, the light is scattered and any images viewed through the glass become distorted and largely indistinguishable. Placing tape upon the surface of the glass fills in its irregularities and allows the light to pass through with much less scattering!"""
ThatPeelingFeeling,2qiivg,ChineseToTheBone,2,Mon Dec 29 03:40:18 2014 UTC,Because you align the molecules correctly if you put tape over it.

ThatPeelingFeeling,2ojq39,jumja,1 point,Sun Dec 7 13:13:10 2014 UTC,"Niice.  What gets me is the stickers over buttons on microwaves: I've found two that needed peeling to the point of the plastic over the buttons being all fucked up from months/years of having not removed it. One was free to me, it took me a few months to realize why the buttons were so ugly (It never occurred to me that someone might not remove all the plastic, I guess). The other was my dad's, not sure when he bought it, but I removed it as soon as I saw the buttons getting shitty. Tell-tale sign, now."
ThatPeelingFeeling,2ojq39,existie,2,Mon Dec 8 03:46:42 2014 UTC,"These buttons were 100% sticker-free! It's also an odd peel, it's a lot more solid than regular foil."

ThatPeelingFeeling,2n924m,MrMacala,1 point,Sat Nov 29 08:00:55 2014 UTC,Something tells me this one was peeled and replaced then peeled again for the shot.  Air bubbles galore on the manufacturers protector.

ThatPeelingFeeling,2n924m,seancellerobryan,4,Tue Nov 25 02:01:25 2014 UTC,"That is despicable. Sorry for my assumptions.  I recently went in and picked up a G3 and the screen protector didn't have graphics on it, just a small pull tab. I was excited because I had a sheath until my case came in the mail.  Horror stuck when the employee casually peeled it off before handing it over to me.   He knew he was wrong when he saw the look on my face.."
ThatPeelingFeeling,2n924m,ghostinthetv,2,Tue Nov 25 02:06:23 2014 UTC,"That is okay, you are forgiven. Normally they don't have many bubbles in them, this one was rather bad.   I have to say I am guilty of this, I often pull it off right before I give it back."

ThatPeelingFeeling,2emmnz,mhender,1 point,Tue Aug 26 23:00:37 2014 UTC,The reason they took it off this car specifically was to see how much it all weighs. As people were concerned of slowing their car with the added weight of the paint. But it wasn't more than a couple pounds.
ThatPeelingFeeling,2emmnz,Draxcer1,1 point,Wed Aug 27 06:45:12 2014 UTC,Was that mentioned in the video? I've never heard of someone expressing concern of weighing down your car by dipping it. One might suggest the  weight would be equal to the negligible weight of the cans (less the weight of an empty can) you use to spray the vehicle.

ThatPeelingFeeling,2dtqtc,ptolatar,6,Mon Aug 18 00:55:47 2014 UTC,There is so much scamming going on in Russia so there is no insurance company that will let you have an insurance unless you have a dashcam

ThatPeelingFeeling,2dtqtc,braintweaker,2,Mon Aug 18 10:06:45 2014 UTC,"Not /u/LaurentPointCa, but I did get a dashcam off of Amazon. Here is the link. I got it for about 55, not 65 though, I guess the price fluctuates a bit. Anyway, I love it. It's a great camera that records about 5 hours on a full card, however it has autoloop so it will do 5 minute loops and then fill the card with the loops, then when the card gets full it will delete the old ones and loop over them.  But yeah, the quality is great I find, although ofcourse nighttime has some problems (depending on the height of your vehicle due to incoming traffic headlights)."

You can also get a 16gb SD card to record about 4-6 hours of highest quality video with no need to erase because it auto loops."

ThatPeelingFeeling,2cbou1,Edddit,2,Sat Aug 2 15:09:11 2014 UTC,I don't think it's over the top. It's a good investment that should last at least 4 years. If you bought say a 740-60 it wouldn't last as long because they wouldn't be able to keep up with the new games while the 780 and especially the 780ti will be able too. So instead of buying a new card every few years I think it's better to buy a really good one that will last.

ThatPeelingFeeling,2bsk2x,ArrowheadVenom,1 point,Sun Jul 27 05:25:43 2014 UTC,The house has been built and the the appliances have been installed but they haven't moved in yet so it's probably been sitting there for a little bit I imagine.
ThatPeelingFeeling,2bsk2x,mainone,3,Sun Jul 27 05:40:18 2014 UTC,"Hah, I love how it's like 15 seconds before you actually peel it. I bet a lot of people thought this was a still image."

ThatPeelingFeeling,2beirz,phonetic-catastrophe,2,Tue Jul 22 22:17:37 2014 UTC,I loved that keyboard but it kept complaining that I was not giving it enough light. It used to be fine with the general light emitted from my lamp but it started to constantly complain. God I miss the clickyness of the keys. Now I feel sad... :(
