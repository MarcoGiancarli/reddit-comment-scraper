I am one of those people who struggle with loneliness and I always enjoy talking to people and getting to know them. I'm in to reading, writing, music, photography, and riding my bike when it's not so hot I'm afraid I'll melt or catch on fire if I leave the house for too long. There's a lot of nice people on here so I think you're in the right place to find friends of all ages. :)"

Needafriend,3e0dg0,numnumimacyclon,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:02:17 2015 UTC,"That's rough, data loss of any kind can be brutal. It's almost before you should consider getting an old typewriter if you do enjoy writing. I haven't tried one since I was a kid, but I guess you should also consider backing up your writing through various means. I'm sure there are some really good options for storing data online too (consider doing multiple places just in case). While frustrating to lose your writing (or anything for that matter), don't let it discourage you too much. In fact unless it's hitting you too hard at the moment, I'd tell you to start writing again. Back up on the ol' horse and forward, spending too much time on being down won't lead to a better state of mind.  Perhaps you could start with a few short stories again. Do you share them with others? Do you making a living from it or is it more of a hobby? Either way get started again, I've lost plenty of things in past, it happens, mostly my own fault though for not backing things up properly. Hope you find the strength to get back into writing!"

Needafriend,3dwkek,bamdamgam,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:16:47 2015 UTC,"It is absolutely remarkable how stay at home mothers ate able to adjust to such a significant lifestyle change so abruptly. I have a 6 month old daughter but literally could not do what you do. I completely empathize with your situation and have a tremendous amount of respect for what you and others like you do on a daily basis.  I can talk about anything as well, except for the TV shows you listed as my spouse tends to have control of the remote. Musically we have some common interests. I could definitely use a little more communication in my life, and, maybe I can steal a few parenting tips from ya in the process. Just shoot me a message if you want to and we can chat."
Needafriend,3dwkek,Haven1882,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:52:37 2015 UTC,Thank you. Most poeple dont know how hard it is to have a little human always on you. How are you doing today?
Needafriend,3dwkek,Haven1882,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:58:20 2015 UTC,I'm doing well. Recovering from an entire weekend of the in laws being in town who don't really and have never really cared for me very much. I'm not quite what they had in mind for their child.
Needafriend,3dwkek,Haven1882,0,Mon Jul 20 16:35:40 2015 UTC,"I did accidently send you a pm because I couldn't figure out how to reply in line. Needless to say is got it figured but not until after I had already sent you the private message.  My parents sit for my daughter one day a week and my mother does the same. She judges how well I've cleaned, clothes, even decor. Back seat parenting and nit picking to be sure. The hard part is I know she has my best interest at heart but the delivery is a little lacking. I tend to have to remind myself to be thankful for all the help that they have been."

Needafriend,3dwxhc,itsraymilz,2,Mon Jul 20 05:29:33 2015 UTC,Wow how much time does you pc take away from your life.
Needafriend,3dwxhc,kamleshrr,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:04:40 2015 UTC,"Besides from my 8 hour a day job as an IT Engineer, not a lot."
Needafriend,3dwxhc,kamleshrr,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:43:15 2015 UTC,Hmm so what takes away your time ??
Needafriend,3dw7qu,Raithed,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:22:55 2015 UTC,Yes. It feels pretty isolating because that is what i am going through right now. And everyone close is going difficult times. I do not want to burden them with more problems and worry.
Needafriend,3dw7qu,becoat_lee,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:25:09 2015 UTC,Message me if you want to talk.

Needafriend,3duy2o,Germinalne,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:50:34 2015 UTC,If you ever need some one to talk to pm me.
Needafriend,3dvwbk,Axeous,2,Sun Jul 19 23:40:58 2015 UTC,Saluton! Ĉu vi uzas Telegram App? Mensaĝu min en Reddit aŭ en Telegram. Mi havas la saman retnomon en ambaŭ retoj! Mi ankaŭ estas komencanto.  Ĝis la revido.
Needafriend,3dvwbk,vafjr87,2,Mon Jul 20 06:20:22 2015 UTC,Do you speak english? I have not started learning yet.  Ill message you on reddit as I do not have telegram (Oh thank the all powerful google for having translate.)
Needafriend,3dvwbk,vafjr87,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:45:02 2015 UTC,"Hahaha, I do, but not perfectly. I'll see your pm."
Needafriend,3dv5ua,ThrowAwaySmile,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:55:30 2015 UTC,You sound a bit like me confused.
Needafriend,3dv5ua,kamleshrr,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:15:10 2015 UTC,"I hope this doesn't come off as criticism (because I find myself in a similar situation these days) - but if you have a wide social circle without any very close friends, then have you considered looking within yourself to figure out why you aren't connecting as intimately as you want? We are the common thread in all of our social relationships, after all. I've felt very similarly to what you described since I was in college, and still even now after I've begun to explore my late 20's."
