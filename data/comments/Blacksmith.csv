Blacksmith,3dzsnr,xnumbersx,2,Tue Jul 21 10:44:23 2015 UTC,"Lemme first start by saying that you've produced a very nice forging,  doubly so since it's your first attempt.  With that said you've produced a mostly decorative piece if it's made entirely out of mild steel.  Mild steel has a very low carbon content around .18%.  It won't really harden any appreciable amount when quenched.  It'll be nearly impossible to keep an edge on that axe as a result.  This problem has been resolved in the past by forge welding a ""bit"" of high carbon steel into blade edge.  This allowed the body of the axe head to be soft and shatter resistant,  while still holding it's edge well."
Blacksmith,3dzsnr,Drauggib,3,Tue Jul 21 12:37:58 2015 UTC,$20 says /u/dathi1916 has memorized Machinery's in his life as a professional machinist and you probably don't have to educate him on the properties of mild steel.

Rigid/Peddinghaus had been the only one for a while, but now there is also Kanca (and perhaps others?).  They're drop forged, not hand or open die forged like old ones.  There are tons of good cast steel anvils, though.  Nimba, Refflinghaus, Kohlswa, etc. etc. etc.  There is really not much reason to prefer drop forged over cast steel for blacksmithing purposes, provided the casting is done well (and it is, by any of the reputable makers).  The heat treatment is more important, but it is not so easy to get details on that.  Some brands report face hardness, but I haven't seen any reporting depth of hardening.  Depending on the process the hardness could be deeper or shallower than on an antique."

Not much you can do about it besides regrinding the blade bevels to remove it, but that will potentially remove the engravings as well (looks like the blade has a flat grind).  You could also give evaporust a shot, but if the steel really is pitted there's nothing you can do besides regrinding to remove the pits."

The reason I hate renting is that any time I want to make a modification to the building, I have to convince my landlord it'll all be OK. Another reason is that when another unit in the building blocks up the sewer line, it floods my shop (luckily only once).  Noise complaints from neighbours shut me down for while to soundproof a wall, partially at my expense.  So, I would avoid renting if I possibly could.  One small benefit is that deliveries of stuff like coal and steel are cheaper to a ""real"" business address.  It is livable, just not convenient or in any way stress-free.  I suppose my experience is not directly relevant to you, as my building is very much an income property and the owners do not work in a business on site.

Just don't get the surface to hot or start removing to much material. Give it a rub down with an oily rag afterwards and when you use it. Don't remove mover rust than you need to, it acts as a barrier to further corrosion.

Blacksmith,3dzn1z,Brutorans,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:19:57 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I was on mobile while posting earlier. Pretty much any shop oil will do. 3in1 oil, engine oil or even linseed oil. The desired effect is to put a barrier between the steel and the atmosphere. As you use the anvil the oil will burn or rub off so just keep an oily rag around to recoat it if needs be.   /u/ColinDavies makes a very valid point about pitting in the material surface, don't try and grind these out as all you will do is make the surface further uneven."
Blacksmith,3dzn1z,ColinDavies,2,Mon Jul 20 23:43:47 2015 UTC,"It's only a problem if they're so far gone that the surface has measurable pits in it.  If it is a smooth rust layer it will just work off as you use the anvil, but do as /u/Brutorans suggests for the satisfaction of working on a nicer looking tool."
Blacksmith,3dzn1z,icecoldcelt,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:47:26 2015 UTC,"When I haven't been able to forge for a month or more, my anvil gets a pretty good coat of rust, even under the oil cloth I keep on it. I just brush off the part that's about to get used with a wire brush (seriously, it's more like brushing off a dusty counter than scrubbing a grimy floor). By the time the item is done, the part of the anvil which I use most is bright and shiny from use and light brushing between heats. This is a good habit anyway, to keep the scale off the anvil.   To answer your particular question about the RR track, I think you should mount at least one of the tracks vertically, which will require you to clean up one end with an angle grinder or files. Also as a general rule, if it's pitted, you need to get rid of the pitting before smithing on it. Same with any big dings or cuts or anything that will be transferred to your metal when you beat it into the surface of your anvil."
Blacksmith,3dvysq,largos,2,Mon Jul 20 00:02:26 2015 UTC,"Oh that's really neat, I've never even thought about needle nose pliers. I might try making them. Maybe with some careful hammer work you could make a sharpened part towards the rivet, for current wire."

Blacksmith,3dxn0u,PaddyMaxson,8,Mon Jul 20 11:24:27 2015 UTC,If the pitting is caused from what I think it is. It could be scale buildup on your piece as you work it. If you are not using a wire brush to descale your work often enough the scale can leave pitting imprints in your metal as you hammer it. Also be sure to remove any scale that had fallen on the face of your anvil before hammering over it.   Another culprit could be improper hammering. Whether this be fault of the hammer not having nicely beveled edges. Or the smith striking with the edges of the hammer. One is an easy fix and you just file a bevel. The other will require working on technique and breaking bad habits.

Most of the dings I see in your metal are hammer marks from the edge of the hammer face digging in too deeply and leaving a sharp line."
Blacksmith,3dxn0u,verdatum,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:14:45 2015 UTC,"I'll bear it in mind, hopefully mounting my anvil a bit lower will help, I suspect I'm not tall enough for where I have it to come down even all the time.  Thanks"
Blacksmith,3dxn0u,DancesWithHippo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:21:47 2015 UTC,"hold your hammer in your hand and rest the face on the anvil. Is your elbow only slightly bent and your arm relaxed? That's the height you are aiming for. There's wiggle room here, since you'll obviously be working metal of different thicknesses, but that's a good ballpark to aim for.   Good technique will help eliminate any ""heeling"" or ""toeing"" of your hammer into the work, but a good radiused edge on your hammer crown is essential. Most novices either tend to under-radius the edges on their hammers (or don't do it at all and just use the stock hammer), or they go too extreme and completely round the whole face.   Mark Aspery's first blacksmithing skills volume has some great photographs and step-by-step processes for dressing a hammer face. Essentially, using a flap sander, put a 15 degree chamfer on all 4 edges, then grind the face back and flow it back to the chamfer until you have about a 1/16"" radius from the face to the chamfer. Or in other words, a mostly flat face with just a slight crown back to the edges.  Then on those occasions when you strike an errant blow with the hammer not level, it's less likely to make a deep sharp cut, and it's easier to flatten back out later."
Blacksmith,3dxn0u,Whittigo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:39:34 2015 UTC,"You probably have an oxidizing fire.  If you are using solid fuel it may need to be deeper, if a gas fire the air mix may be too high.  Also brush the scale off the anvil after each heat and wire brush your work on the way to the anvil."
Blacksmith,3dxn0u,Whittigo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:30:01 2015 UTC,"To help avoid pitting from scale, particularly after you have the rough shape, and are now refining things, quickly hit the surfaces with a wire brush before you start hammering.  It'll still oxidize as you work, but it doesn't pit it quite as much.  A lot of smiths rather like the pitted look, and only bother to grind the cutting edge smooth.  People think it gives things a more authentic hand-forged look; though historic smiths would frequently file all visible surfaces smooth."
Blacksmith,3dxn0u,xnumbersx,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:37:55 2015 UTC,"As mentioned, it could just be scale, or you could be getting your metal too hot."
Blacksmith,3dv04z,SlipperyJAMS,4,Sun Jul 19 19:07:55 2015 UTC,"So, how was the anvil?  It looks like you got the stand sorted out very well in the end."
Blacksmith,3dv04z,ColinDavies,2,Sun Jul 19 19:32:45 2015 UTC,Once I got the chain on there with the turnbuckles it was really great I gotta say. Tension on the chain took care of almost all the ring.   The anvil is still just stuffed full of rags right now though. I need to come up with a more permanent filler. Leading suspect right now is molten aluminum.
Blacksmith,3dv04z,TheBoognishRising,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:53:39 2015 UTC,Is there a concern that exposing your anvil to that much heat could possibly draw out the hardness?
Blacksmith,3dv04z,madwilliamflint,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:49:00 2015 UTC,Very definitely.   I've been thinking about setting the anvil in a bucket of water so that only the mouth of the cavity is above the surface. I'm thinking that could still damage the hardness of the internal structure but none of the heat would be able to linger in the outer metal long enough to get hot. The water should bleed it all away.   I'm not sure about about the physics of that though. Before I do it I may make a blacksmith or metalcasting post about it to ask for thoughts from people who know what they're doing.
Blacksmith,3dv04z,pseudoguru,2,Mon Jul 20 15:11:12 2015 UTC,heh.  Had my first forge day a couple weeks ago.  I realized within a few minutes that I needed a coal rake of some kind.  Made my first tool while needing my first tool.   Off to the races.  :)
Blacksmith,3dv04z,Fargraven,2,Mon Jul 20 02:33:00 2015 UTC,It was a two man job. We did it at my buddy's cabin.
Blacksmith,3dv04z,TorchForge,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:09:03 2015 UTC,"in case it ever comes up in the future... An overnight vinegar bath is AMAZING at removing rust, even heavy heavy scaled rust.  I use it on old scavenged cast iron cookware sometimes."
Blacksmith,3dv04z,Fargraven,3,Sun Jul 19 19:16:41 2015 UTC,"Oddly enough, I've had times where vinegar has induced rust (which I expected, because it's an acid), and other times where it's removed rust.   It wasn't a very scientific experiment, so I didn't really keep track of which variables could've caused it (it was the same type of steel and vinegar though), but in ~2 hours it induced the rust, while an overnight bath removed the rust."
Blacksmith,3dv04z,TorchForge,3,Sun Jul 19 19:34:48 2015 UTC,"Vinegar in the absence of oxygen will remove rust. Vinegar in the presence of oxygen will induce rust (but if you're shooting for a protective layer of blue rust, this works well for that purpose).  What probably happened is that your vinegar soak had atmospheric oxygen dissolved into it initially which induced the rust but then over a longer period of time time the oxygen (now locked up in iron-oxide) was removed by the acidity of the vinegar.  Room temperature water can only hold a maximum of ~8 mg/l of dissolved oxygen at 100% saturation, so depending on how large your container was you probably only had a few available milligrams of oxygen available for the formation of rust."
Blacksmith,3dv04z,Fargraven,2,Tue Jul 21 16:02:42 2015 UTC,"Ohh that makes so much sense. When it induced rust, I was aiming for a light patina and I used a vinegar-soaked paper towel left open to the air. And when it removed rust, I just submerged it into a cup of vinegar. I've been wondering about it for a while. Thank you."
Blacksmith,3dwot7,dirtysmith,2,Mon Jul 20 03:59:37 2015 UTC,"Well damn, that's a really tough choice.  It must feel pretty great to know you are inspiring smiths to get off their asses and go forge something; especially with this much variety and creativity."

Blacksmith,3dvmsf,sirged,10,Sun Jul 19 22:19:22 2015 UTC,"How did blacksmiths in the medieval era make the wire for chainmaille?  Wire is still made today the same way it has been historically; by drawing. The metal hammered through a hole in a block of hardened metal slightly smaller than it currently is, and then the remainder pulled through with pliers. This continues with smaller and smaller holes until the wire is the dimension you need. Today, this is a mechanised process with the wire being fed with rollers, but it is essentially the same process.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Wire-drawing-bench.jpg  http://fortepianos.com/fine%20wire%20drawing.jpg  Or did they do mostly flat ring and rivet/weld method?  There are historical remnants of maille made with round wire, flat wire, stamped washer type rings, riveted round rings, riveted flat rings and just about any combination you could think of. So the answer is 'all of the above'.  http://www.forth-armoury.com/research/wire/authentic_wire.htm  Is butted chainmaille a more modern way of doing it easy for decorative pieces?  It's an easier way for something that is for decorative purposes."
Blacksmith,3dvmsf,la_mecanique,2,Sun Jul 19 23:00:18 2015 UTC,Thank you very much. I've seen those draw blocks before. Never really understood exactly how they were used. Awesome this is something I have been looking for a while. Thank you again! Now time to build a drawing table :D.
Blacksmith,3dvmsf,la_mecanique,2,Mon Jul 20 00:25:00 2015 UTC,"You're welcome. Most modern drawing blocks are made for the jeweller's industry which is working soft ductile metals, so bear that in mind as it may affect the life of the tool."
Blacksmith,3dvmsf,la_mecanique,2,Mon Jul 20 00:54:28 2015 UTC,I am thinking I would make one out of tool steel. I have access to a big CNC so I think it would be a good option for doing steel.
Blacksmith,3dvmsf,icecoldcelt,3,Mon Jul 20 04:57:07 2015 UTC,mmm... big CNC...
Blacksmith,3dvmsf,verdatum,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:27:03 2015 UTC,"You won't get much benefit from CNC over just a drill press and tapered bits. Not to discourage you, but it's a stupid simple build: Drill progressively larger tapered holes in a line and you're done. Use the same bit, but go a little deeper each time."
Blacksmith,3dvmsf,PlutoniumX,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:49:10 2015 UTC,"I saw a program where they tested the difference in quality between butted chain links and welded ones.  IIRC, it was pretty subtle.  I think they could only see a major difference in the case of armor piercing tipped arrows.  For slashing weapons, both are equally effective."
Blacksmith,3dwi2w,yangxiaodong,2,Mon Jul 20 02:55:54 2015 UTC,"It's all a tradeoff.  ""The cheapest kind of propane forge you can make"" is a propane torch, pointed at some clay bricks you stole from a construction site.  But you won't enjoy using such a thing.  The technique you would use for building a forge depend quite a bit on what tools and fabricating skills you have, or are willing to acquire.  Keep in mind that I stick to solid fuel, but from my research, I think kaowool makes the most sense for a propane forge.  It's lightweight, easy to work with, withstands heat well, doesn't take forever to come up to working temperature, and does a good job of reflecting the heat back at your workpiece.  Home-made refractory either sucks, or requires so many components that it ends up costing the same as kaowool.  high-temp refractory brick works well too; and you can cut it to shape very easily, but it weighs more, and they are physically fragile.  If you have the time to spare, and some simple tools, you can save a few bucks by building your own propane-burner out of misc hardware store parts."
Blacksmith,3dwi2w,verdatum,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:58:57 2015 UTC,"Mostly depends on the max size you want to forge: for small blades for example, a ""soup can forge"" is enough. Search the web for it, but basically, it's a 1L can lined with a mix of a refractoty mix (a mix of clay with sand, a handful of hair and a bit crushed charcoal, fire-cured, will be fine; otherways, refractory mortar works). You bore a hole in it to pass a steel tube the size of your torch's burner through the lining.  For bigger pieces, I can't tell. I use charcoal."
Blacksmith,3dwi2w,NoIdeaJustOneName,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:01:32 2015 UTC,"I made my first forge out of a Balloon Time Helium cylinder I found at the dump. Only thing I did to it was strip off the paint with a flap disk and repaint it a high temperature black I already had from when I fixed my grill.  I used Kaowool to line it that I got on eBay for about 40 bucks.  The nozzle, I made out of plumbing parts that I got for about 20 bucks.  I bought a quart of water glass (to seal/stiffen the kaowool) for about 10 bucks. I got a couple of cracked fire bricks from a fireplace store for free to act as the floor of the forge.  I bought a hose and regulator at a garage sale for 5 bucks.  I mounted the whole thing on a welder cart from Harbor Freight that I got for 30 bucks. (OPTIONAL)  All told, I spent about 100 USD for it but I could have spent as little as about 70 USD."

Blacksmith,3dwi2w,hellionzzz,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:20:32 2015 UTC,Depends on how high I have the propane cranked up. The fastest I think was less than 5 minutes. I haven't timed it though. Usually I don't have it dialed up so high since I work multiple pieces at a time.
Blacksmith,3dwi2w,hellionzzz,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:36:20 2015 UTC,oh also where can i find schematics?

Blacksmith,3dwpjn,zacablast3r,2,Tue Jul 21 04:31:08 2015 UTC,There was a wonderful album posted on imgur today detailing exactly this:  http://imgur.com/gallery/LGzFV
Blacksmith,3dwpjn,TorchForge,2,Tue Jul 21 16:13:46 2015 UTC,"(full disclosure: this is based on my very limited understanding of the process from my own research on the subject)  as people here have mentioned ring making is generally high level crafting, at it's core it's easy enough (it mean you can make a ring out of daisy chains or a washer after all) but for something that will last, won't stain the finger, and will be something you and your SO will be willing to wear in public for (hopefully) the rest of your lives, that is a much higher level craft.   that being said, the rewards of making the ring yourself can be great. it's more personal, you can use as a base for the ring something significant to the two of you, and obviously there is a lot of room for personalizing something you made.  you said ""engagement ring/wedding ring"" but these are two completely different kinds of rings, an engagement ring is far more ornate and not likely to be worn much at all, you have a lot more latitude here with your materials (steel, bone, wood, ivory, printed circuit board, it's the sentiment behind it that matters the most here) a wedding band on the other hand stays on the hand constantly, it has to be able to hit walls and tables and be subjected to the crap we put our hands through without tarnishing, rusting, chipping, breaking, or scratching significantly (why wedding bands are usually not 24 carat gold but some mixture of gold and silver. gold and copper makes rose gold which is also rather pretty and durable) they usually do not have jewels in them for that reason (they will fall out or shatter)  if i had to make a suggestion: avoid anything involving setting gemstones. you will likely not get it right, gem setting is frikken hard and there are a lot of specialized tools needed to not end up with just crap that falls out when someone looks at it wrong. inlaying is a little easier, still need a dremel tool, but you can glue it in...and that helps.   so the basics: generally one would cast a ring. make a version of the ring carved out of wax, just get some paraffin wax and carve it til it looks like a ring, you can add details you want here, if you want to inlay something into it (a piece of wood or stone from the place you met or a PCM from a defunct version of your favourite SNES game or whatever, i don't know you to know what is significant to you two) you would carve the inlays here (remember, the ring will be smaller than the carving, make the inlays larger to compensate. i think it's 33% or so that it shrinks, i'm sure someone can correct me on that.) again, only concern yourself with inlays or similar ornaments if this is an engagement ring. you can also carve and inscription but you will have to go over the inscription again after you are done if you want to be able to read it, we can't avoid the dremel i'm afraid.  so, once you have your wax ring, add some more wax to serve as areas for the metal to flow into (basically just a bunch of tubes attached to spots on the ring, they let metal in and air out) once all that is done get some plaster of paris and mix it up and put your ring into the plaster so the ring is submerged but the wax tines coming off it break the surface of the plaster. this is usually the point when people put it in a vacuum chamber to remove the air but i'm assuming you don't have one of those, i imagine just tapping the side of the container repeatedly or putting it on something that vibrates should work to get out most the air bubbles. once the plaster dries you wanna put it in the oven upside down so the wax runs out and you have your mold (one of a kind, because you will have to break it later to get the ring out)  of course all this is overkill if you are making a plain wedding band, for that you can just mix up some [greensand]() and press the wax ring into, pack it, and carefully remove it, and you have your mold.  the next part is melting down the metal, this can be easy or hard pending what you have to work with and what metal you want to melt, whatever the case you will likely need a furnace (some metals like tin you can melt in an oven, you can look over this wiki page) for melting points of elements. but you should probably stick to gold, silver, copper, platinum, and nickel for jewelry, like i mentioned above, an alloy of gold and copper can make pretty jewelry and copper is cheaper than gold/silver alloy. unlike copper jewelry though rose gold won't turn your fingers green. whatever metal you chose make sure it's not toxic. then it's just a matter of melting the metal and pouring it into your mold, then cleaning up the ring after it's done. look into jeweler's rouge, apply it to a buffing wheel to get a nice mirror shine.  expect to fail a lot, don't start with expensive metal, start with something cheap like copper or nickel or tin til you think you got it down. going straight to gold makes your mistakes sting all the more and can be very disheartening."
Blacksmith,3dwpjn,tuseroni,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:07:33 2015 UTC,"Its a great idea and the meaning behind it would be wonderful- but so is carefully picking out an engagement ring and selecting certain aspects of it that will make your significant other really happy.

You can start with an anvil substitute lie Rail Road track or an anvil fabricated from such.  Again Ebay is your friend.    As for a forge, google how to make a brake drum forge.  Or how to make a gas forge.    You'll need tongs, an anvil, a forge, a hammer, fuel and something to bang on such as steel stock or scrap steel.  Easy enough to get except for the forge and anvil.

You can use dense fire brick for the forge, which will be more durable than the soft stuff.  For gas forges people recommend soft fire brick as it's a much better insulator, but that is less of a concern in a charcoal forge (and you'll be poking around a lot to work the fire)."

Blacksmith,3dts0s,NoIdeaJustOneName,2,Sun Jul 19 14:47:31 2015 UTC,"That sounds very interesting, but I'm pulling up next to nothing for either term - just vague definitions for ""brasque"", and almost exclusively heavy industrial info for ""potlining"".

Blacksmith,3dts0s,Hello_Zech,3,Sun Jul 19 17:01:27 2015 UTC,"I said ""potlining"" because it was the translation I found for ""brasque"" (I'm french). Maybe you find melting pot stuff when you search this term...  I cannot really give you an actual ""recipe"" because i'm not doing it very precisely... feeling and rule of thumb are my guidelines :) However, for approximately 10kg of clay, I'll use 3 or 4 handfuls of sand, some bits of crushed firebrick (hald a brick, I'd say), 1 handful of crushed charcoal, and 2-3 handfuls of fibers: hair and/or dried weed (those fibers have a similar function as irons in concrete)  Spread it on your forge and light it immediately: it must be fire-cured. At end, it must be very resistant (to fire and schocks) and when you hit it, the sound must be dull.  Now, it's an approximative and personnal recipe, maybe you should adapt it to your components (particularly, depending on the clay you use which will probably be different if you're overseas)."

For air supply, I know I take a pipe and angle it downward towards the bottom of the fire through the walls.

I won't say it's impossible with just a blowtorch but I suggest you take a lighthearted approach and be ready to accept disappointment.  At the very least you will need to insulate the bundle while heating it.  A small enclosure not much bigger than the area you're heating, formed of soft fire brick or ceramic wool could potentially work.  Make it so the flame goes in one side, around the metal, and out the other.  You will also have to get your torch burning with a neutral or slightly reducing flame.  Poke it in there and cross your fingers..."
Blacksmith,3dspp8,ColinDavies,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:11:23 2015 UTC,"Hrm, alright then. My plan was to sorta do something like heavy cable and then hammer out the blade, making a damscus steel blade with a twist handle."

One tip I've heard that I will pass along: when welding a cable into a solid bar, it helps if you tighten the twist while it's hot.  There are voids between the strands that will mess with successful welding, and this helps to close them."

Blacksmith,3dsg35,Gullex,3,Sun Jul 19 00:39:36 2015 UTC,"Best not to mess around with forge welding onto a knife as a complete beginner.  There are too many ways to end up weakening or destroying the knife rather than strengthening it.  Something more manageable would be forge brazing, which will let you reinforce the handle without getting into dangerous territory with temperature or having to hammer it very much.  You would just have to take care when heat treating the blade not to melt out the brazing.  For the hook end, bend it first and then trim.  Having the extra length for leverage will make bending it a lot easier."
Blacksmith,3dsg35,ColinDavies,2,Sun Jul 19 13:05:44 2015 UTC,Thank you
Blacksmith,3dsg35,ColinDavies,2,Sun Jul 19 15:40:42 2015 UTC,"By the way, the part that needs reinforcement the most will be the transition from blade to handle.  Your added metal should extend from there a bit onto the spine of the blade.  It can get thinner towards the end of the handle, in fact you probably don't need it all the way along."
Blacksmith,3dsg35,Vanhugenstein,2,Sun Jul 19 18:26:46 2015 UTC,Would be dificult but not impossible.  One thought is you will need to re-heat treat the blade after.  I would make new handles for the draw knife and make a stock knife from scratch myself.  Forge welding is dificult too.
Blacksmith,3ds3dh,drewmsmith,5,Sat Jul 18 22:36:24 2015 UTC,"There are lots of kits you can buy out there for a good 2x72 belt grinder. Lots of us make our own though. It sounds like a challenge but its really not that bad. Here was the one I built _http://imgur.com/a/itAR0. It has served me very well.

I think $20 for the metal mounting strips and bolts.  So all said, I think I'm in this for about $130...  but I could have been a little more frugal.  I think I will be needing to get a Y-yoke for the propane tanks...  I was told single 20lb tanks have a tendency to freeze and throw off the mix.  Good thing I already had two tanks."

Blacksmith,3doeqo,Bosskode,3,Fri Jul 17 22:46:32 2015 UTC,"I have tried a couple of knives but this is the first I have put a handle on. Also it turns out big coil springs make a tough ass knife. Not the right sub but I also made the sheath.   So many things I learned here, I will try to list a few. I need a drill press, hand drilling the handle holes gets you irregular holes and pins. Tang width is important for handle size, duh. I need a belt sander, angle grinding does not an even blade make. Oil quenching spring steel works great. There is a huge amount of sanding making a knife. This was a fun project, I can't wait to start the next one. I do John Neeman tools a disservice by mentioning it, but for full disclosure I used this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3nojb-gFH4 as my guide for the general blade shape and more specifically how to make a sheath, this was my first leatherwork."

I don't have any leatherworking experience so I went with what I know. I used a combo brown and black shoe polish, mink oil and when it was all absorbed I hit it with beeswax. No idea if this was actually good for the leather but it seemed to work."
Blacksmith,3doeqo,Dwarfboner5000,2,Fri Jul 17 23:44:45 2015 UTC,"That leather treatment will work just fine.  It won't penetrate as well as an actual leather dye, but it won't hurt the leather.  If you are working with traditional unfinished oak or vegetable tanned leather you might be able to find some liquid leather dye at a supermarket in the shoe polish section."

Blacksmith,3dp1t2,need-thneeds,2,Sat Jul 18 02:13:50 2015 UTC,I'd say go with an old style pedal grinder. The wheel itself looks like it would be used on an older style mid west grinder. We use the modern ones where I work. The wheels are bigger and thicker now but that looks like it would fit my spindle if i had a spacer.

Blacksmith,3doqn5,beavertonweb,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:24:18 2015 UTC,"It is really difficult.  You have to watch prices for a long time to get a feel for them in just one region (it can vary a lot geographically).  One point of reference is to look at the prices for brand new tools of similar quality.  Then factor in any wear and tear or serious damage that would prevent you from using them effectively, how much time/money they would take to refurbish...  Also, it is always worth your while to ask for advice before buying a tool, provided you've got the time.  I've had good help in this regard from my local ABANA affiliate, as well as from this sub and other places online."
Blacksmith,3dneth,littggr,2,Fri Jul 17 18:09:19 2015 UTC,There is a North East Blacksmith Association and for classes look up the New England School of Metalwork in Auburn Maine. I highly recommend taking a class with them. Great people and an amazing facility.

This whole blacksmithing thing has just been an idea to me but I cant stop thinking about it lately. My plan to start off as a hobby/part time blade smith and work my way up to full time if I really like it. Would taking the beginner blacksmithing and then taking beginner blade smithing sound like the right path to start? In that time I plan on building a forge so that once I take the classes, I can get right to work."
Blacksmith,3dneth,Animal_Mother27,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:54:32 2015 UTC,That's pretty much how I started. Took a blacksmithing class and a bladesmithing class and a few more here and there when I could. I live about the same distance away so getting there is easy.

Blacksmith,3dmld3,Mc_ThuMp_NasTy,3,Fri Jul 17 14:23:54 2015 UTC,"The best way is to find a local blacksmithing club or ABANA chapter.  Next best would be to take classes, followed third by books and videos.  Any of these will get you started, but you need real hands on help to really hone the craft.  The difference between having an actual mentor/teacher and watching videos or reading is enormous.  To get into it for yourself, you basically need an anvil or suitable substitute, hammer, tongs, forge, and material (new or scrap) to work with.  You can go very inexpensive or you can spend a whole lot on this hobby.  That part is between you and your wallet."
Blacksmith,3dmld3,biggreenfan,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:41:40 2015 UTC,I will see if I can find any around where I live. I'm in the very deep south so I'm sure I can find at least one person to help me get started. Thanks for the advice.

Blacksmith,3dmld3,SlipperyJAMS,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:00:04 2015 UTC,"Try a Google search for ABANA chapters in your area.  Otherwise just blacksmithing in your area.  If there is an arts school nearby (we have the Appalachian centr for craft) it might be an option.  Finally, depending on whether you have the resources and can travel, Google Brian Brazeal blacksmithing course.  It's $1500 and that gets you a week working one on one with one of the most well known smiths around. It also includes room and board and you come away with a number of projects including the Brazeal rounding hammer which sells for $300 alone.  He's in Mississippi, I believe."
Blacksmith,3dmld3,SlipperyJAMS,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:10:36 2015 UTC,Thanks for all the advice I will look into that.
Blacksmith,3dmld3,SlipperyJAMS,3,Fri Jul 17 16:16:56 2015 UTC,"I doubt there's a single good answer for that.   Yeah, if you can take a class that's great but it seems like blacksmiths giving classes tend to exist only in a few particular parts of North America.   You need an anvil, a hammer, and a forge. Plus fuel and material.  In my case I just began collecting those things when I could. I asked anyone I could think of - mechanics, carpenters, town workers etc - for any piece I thought they might be able to help me with. Hunks of steel, railroad spikes, brake drums.   It took me a year or more before I finally had enough that I could start piecing a kit together. The anvil can be any giant hunk of steel when you're getting started. The forge you'll probably have to build and there are a few tutorials in the side bar for that I believe. I've invested a few hundred dollars at this point on things I couldn't get for free. Mostly tools, and black iron pipe fittings. But that was all spread out over the year.   First firing is Sunday. It was quite the journey to get here."
Blacksmith,3dmld3,Dwarfboner5000,5,Fri Jul 17 14:44:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah I'm in Canada. There are maybe 6 ABANA affiliates in the country according to their affiliate map and they're nearly all around the southern border. There isn't one around me for literally 1000+ miles.   Looking at their map most of their affiliates are on the east coast of the US, then scattered few and far between in central and west coast US.   So... no I'm not dead wrong. Taking a class for me is in no way an option, and that's the case for a ton of people. I was trying to point that out and illustrate how I proceeded anyway.   It's kind of amazing how often you're rude in your responses man. I don't know why you even bother to respond on the subreddit. You never want to help anyone. You just want them to feel like shit about their questions and answers."
Blacksmith,3dmld3,Dwarfboner5000,5,Fri Jul 17 15:33:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm the problem."
Blacksmith,3dmld3,Dwarfboner5000,5,Fri Jul 17 15:50:47 2015 UTC,"or, you could not be a self entitled asshole and accept that just because you have been blacksmithing for longer doesn't mean that you're the only person who can help, also people who don't know as much would know more about gathering materials now instead of 10, 15 years ago when you started"
Blacksmith,3dmld3,SlipperyJAMS,4,Fri Jul 17 21:45:51 2015 UTC,That was pretty bad writing I realise. All I wanted to say was that you being better at blacksmithing does not give you the right to tell other people that they can't help. I don't want to have negativity on this subreddit. The point that I was trying to get across is that it might have been different for you to get your forge set up since you did it 10-15 years ago. Meaning that someone who's set theirs up in the past year might have better knowledge of what it is like now.
Blacksmith,3dmld3,TheRedCack,3,Fri Jul 17 22:02:28 2015 UTC,"and now we're back to you being a self entitled asshole. You don't have to be rude and tell other people that they're not as smart as you. You're not some special little snowflake, no one gives a shit. This is a subreddit for learning and sharing, if you're going to be telling people that they're wrong at least do it in a constructive way."
Blacksmith,3dmld3,TheRedCack,3,Sat Jul 18 15:23:58 2015 UTC,"Then you downvote my posts, not lash out in response.   It's funny man, you seem to have this protective mentality, where nobody is allowed to give the newbies any advice unless its golden perfect advice, yet these same newbies are the ones you keep shitting on when they ask questions.   In point of fact I've made a few posts about my anvil now asking for tips and you haven't once said it wouldn't work. In fact one of the very few helpful posts I've seen from you has been you giving me pointers about mounting the damn thing. So were you talking out of your ass then or now?  Finally, and this is important. I didn't give any fucking advice to OP. I said ""If you can take a class that's great..."" and then proceeded to tell my story.   I can do a search on the subreddit for ""Newbie"" or ""Getting started"" and its the same god damn post every time. People asking how to get started and then 19 replies saying ""Take a class!"" like a broken record. That's shitty advice to anyone outside of your US bubble who don't have access to classes.   What about them? Me? You certainly didn't have anything to say about it, other than the fact that me trying to get by without classes was wrong and I don't know what I'm doing so I should probably just stop.   Why wouldn't I tell you to go fuck yourself man? I love the hobby and your bullshit isn't going to stop me from trying it. I'm just trying to take the edge off for all the other newbies you target."

Blacksmith,3dmexs,Slowhand09,2,Fri Jul 17 17:00:54 2015 UTC,"It uses reverse Polish notation.   Regular notation is 1+2. Polish notation is +1,2 Reverse polish is 1,2+  So to operate your 15C, type a number, press enter, type the next number, then press +.  This seems cumbersome at first, but it's the same number of keystrokes as 1+2=.  Where the advantage comes in is that you get a stack of four numbers to work with. Once you're used to it you can use the stack to keep an intermediate result while you do more calculations, then bring it in when needed with a single keystroke. It's incredibly useful when programming for repeated complex calculations. (I programmed one for manufacturing design back in about 1991.)  Also, my anvil is too big and 3000 miles away, plus I already have a 15C."

It's not great but you can try hitting up antique stores, sometimes you get lucky and they aren't charging 3 times what they should be. I got mine from a big sale at one, roof damage and they had to sell everything.  That being said St. Petersburg is not the ideal place to find that kind of hardware, but if you go into the state more, get to the rural areas between tampa gainsville and orlando you have a better chance of finding something. Estate sales in that area and up into Ocala have the best chances of finding something. Its just that there is no good way to find out about most estate sales in rural areas. At most they might get posted in a local paper."

Blacksmith,3dk2tm,SomethingKiller,5,Thu Jul 16 22:20:28 2015 UTC,"The best place to find a starter anvil is the place where you finally find one, that is to say, there is no good place.  Huge quantities of anvils were melted down for the war effort during WWII and those that are left are often in the hands of collectors who want to get new anvil prices for them because they are antiques.  If you ask me, anvil collecting has to be right at the top of really stupid things to collect.  Anyway, if you really want to get into smithing and you want to get in to it quickly, you will probably either need to put together a makeshift anvil with a large piece of scrap of some sort, or break down and buy a new one.  A new 150 lb. anvil can be had for about $800.00.  Scrap can sometimes be had for fifty or sixty cents a pound.    100-125 lbs. would be a good starting weight and you might never need to upsize from there, depending on how far you develop your skills and what sorts of things you end up making."

There are ways to configure a makeshift track anvil to make them more useful.  There might be information to that effect on Anvilfire or ABANA web sites.  It seems I came across some drawings of ways to do it properly somewhere on line.  Do some looking and you should be able to find resources from legitimate blacksmithing related web sites that will give you some direction if that is how you end up going.  Other possibilites are odd sized cut offs from industrial steel suppliers.  A friend of mine once took me to such a place outside of Sacramento and they had a very large selection of what are called ""drops"", I believe.  If you end up going this latter route think in terms of how you are going to secure whatever you settle on to a stump or base of some kind.  When you get right down to it however, there really isn't a great substitute for an actual anvil.  Western style anvils like the various European and the more common in this country, London pattern, were developed over centuries to be highly useful for general blacksmithing operations.  Having personally only ever done smithing on real anvils and for over twenty years at that, it is difficult for me to picture doing blacksmithing work without such things as a hardy hole, a pritchel hole, a bick, leg vise etc. There are so many things that are quite easy to do with the right equipment that are so much more difficult to accomplish with something like a piece of track. I would rather not have to work that way."
Blacksmith,3dk2tm,Teejay90,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:37:53 2015 UTC,Thank you very much for the reply.   Anything is better than nothing but the limitations in using railroad track   Is there a particular metal or alloy I should be in search of then in terms of scrap until I can find an anvil? (They're actually pretty common in my area) like should I be looking for something hard like hardened o1 tool steel? Or something a bit more giving like 1018 cold roll low carbon steel?  And is there a difference between anvils? Like is any anvil useable for smithing or are they a specialty item?
Blacksmith,3dk2tm,beammeupscotty2,2,Fri Jul 17 23:41:40 2015 UTC,"O1 would be pretty great but also difficult to find in large size pieces and very expensive to boot.  4140 medium carbon steel would be pretty great to use and it is more common and less expensive than O1.  If you are stuck using a makeshift anvil, I'd say that mass is more important than what steel it is made from, that is to say, the heavier the piece the better off you will be.  If you end up with some sort of mild steel like 1018 and it gets beat up, you can just resurface it with a side grinder and flap wheel or with a belt sander."

Awesome. I work with O1 all the time at my machining job, so that'll be an easy find. Funny enough, 4140 is rare to find in my area. And again, thank you. Your information has been very helpful.

Blacksmith,3dj6c7,LysergicAcidDiethyla,9,Thu Jul 16 18:21:44 2015 UTC,"I would say find a small steel cup and then just take a blow torch to it. It doesn't take much to melt. I would advise against melting your tin soldier in your oven due to the risk of lead. Also they sell tiny tin ingot on eBay for cheap.   As far as the molding method, Google greensand molding and check out what others are doing. Basically just sand water and clay. Just don't overdo it with the water(should be barely damp) or the metal will pop out. If you wanted to get real fancy you could either buy a pre-made wax ring or carve one yourself. Put the wax ring in plaster and then once hardens melt out the wax then pour the metal into it. Just don't forget to carve a way to pour it. Google investment casting to find out more about that method. Good luck!"
Blacksmith,3dj6c7,Der3k69,8,Thu Jul 16 20:25:09 2015 UTC,"the melting point for tin is ~449 degrees fahrenheit, you can get those temperatures in your standard oven. (note: tin foil is not actually tin, it's aluminum, many solders are tin+lead alloy try not to use those especially if you intend to WEAR the ring.)   i haven't done casting myself so i'm going by my limited understanding of the process:  take your tin, put it in the oven at ~500F until it melts, while you are waiting for that take some fine sand put it in two boxes big enough for your ring, wet it down and pack it tight, push the ring into each of them (make sure you do it in the right spot so they come together right) make some tubes to let metal in and air out that lead out of the box. put the box together (without the ring in it) once the metal is all melted pour into the hole in the box til metal comes out the airhole. let it cool and take it out."
Blacksmith,3dj6c7,tuseroni,3,Thu Jul 16 18:47:15 2015 UTC,"Okay, you left out something really important. You need something to HOLD the tin while it's in the oven. You don't want the tin to melt to the bottom of the oven. Second, you described closed mold casting pretty concisely, but with tin and a simple shape, you can just use an open face mold, which is easier and uses less material. Essentially take the same process up to the point where you put the ring in the sand, but press it all the way down. First put down a thread or something to pull it out without damaging the mold. Pour it into the mold then file it smooth and to the right shape after it cools."
Blacksmith,3dj6c7,icecoldcelt,5,Fri Jul 17 02:29:48 2015 UTC,"/r/metalworking might be able to help you out a bit more. most blacksmiths work primarily in iron and steel. that said, assuming your tin soldier is really made of tin (and not some alloy), it shouldn't be hard to melt/cast. tin melts at ~450F. that temperature should be easily achievable with a simple household propane torch or a small campfire."

Blacksmith,3dj6c7,Jester337,2,Thu Jul 16 20:21:10 2015 UTC,"If it's small enough, try cutting a soda can in half, putting it in the little bowl thing on the bottom and blowtorch in it till it's melted. If you cut a flap out of the side and bend it straight out, you can use a pair of pliers to move it around and pour it.  P.S. Are you trying to become a wizard or a Maester?"
Blacksmith,3dj6c7,Taco_Strong,2,Thu Jul 16 20:46:28 2015 UTC,An aluminum soda can will get soft and brittle at about 800° F and melt at just over 1200° F. The flame coming out of a propane torch is close to 1500° F. So aluminum is probably not a good choice here.  Better to use a steel soup can. It will handle the heat much better and has a melting point of around 2600° F.
Blacksmith,3dj6c7,BillDaCatt,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:35:02 2015 UTC,"I was figuring the tin would melt before that point. As stated else where in the thread, tin melts around ~450 degrees. Well before the aluminum can. The soup can is probably a safer choice."
Blacksmith,3dj6c7,Taco_Strong,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:42:37 2015 UTC,"That trick works if you are heating liquids and the vessel is almost full. You absolutely can boil water over a flame in a paper cup. It doesn't work so well with solids that don't make uniform contact with the inside surface.   Don't feel bad though.

Blacksmith,3dj6c7,BillDaCatt,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:57:15 2015 UTC,I didn't mean to heat the soda can. You torch the tin directly.
Blacksmith,3dj6c7,Taco_Strong,2,Fri Jul 17 17:00:45 2015 UTC,"That might work better, but remember that the flame would still lick out and around until the tin melts and the container would help to contain and concentrate that 1500° F flame.   I still think the paper thin aluminum can might melt first. Perhaps even faster than heating from the bottom."

That's assuming you don't lose anything to scale, which you will then it will be even shorter. My suggestion is that you use these parts for chisels and punches and other things closer to that size and buy the stock you need closer to the final size. I've taken the approach you're talking about, and it sucks. Starting with big stock and working it down to what you need sucks bad enough. Having to upset small stuff into big stuff would be about twice as bad."

Started with around 7 inches of teeth on both sides of your file when you wrap it and I start with a 18-19 inch handle.

What I've learned is that the manufacturer paid for cast bases and welded wrought steel tops to them. This is a big difference from other anvils with cast bases, which usually are cast all the way up to a face plate. Many of those anvils have cast horns (Fishers are a sort-of exception). Trenton's method gives you all the benefits of an all-wrought anvil, but with a lot less noise. Although it's nowhere near as quiet as my Fisher, the Trenton is substantially quieter than all-wrought anvils of similar size.  You can see on the heel of your anvil, as on mine, some pretty large fuller marks from them drawing down the shape.  I would recommend you coat the front face of the front foot with soapstone or flour and look harder for a serial number. It should be there."

If you get one for free or very cheap there's no shame in using it, but if you are spending money then you will not get your money's worth.  The same cash spent on new square bar or good scrap steel will give you a much better anvil.  Buying these ASOs just puts another bad tool into circulation and encourages the manufacturers to keep churning them out.  Some of the other things mentioned in this thread are good alternatives: thick plate (really thick, like 2"" or more, on its edge), rail, sledge head in a stump, and not I beam but really heavy wide flange or H beam (standing on its end).  Someone posted a beautiful chunk of wide flange beam here a while back with flanges almost 3"" thick if I recall.  That's like having two full size anvils side-by-side with another in between just for fun.  You could also look for forklift tines and pins out of heavy machinery.  I imagine the axle from a large truck would be good, too.  A granite boulder is always an option though much less desirable than steel (more just something cheap and fun to play around with)."

However, the edges wear and chip instantly, you dent the face just by lightly hitting it, and the horn is basically useless.  I eventually got a piece of rail road track and replaced this piece.  If you're just starting out, it's mediocre at best.  I would advise just saving your money and looking on craigslist for a real anvil."

Blacksmith,3d9ile,fullmetalflamel,5,Tue Jul 14 15:37:44 2015 UTC,"That looks really nice. Can you give us a brief rundown of the process and materials that you used? What kind of steel, tempering, that sort of thing."
Blacksmith,3d9ile,roadkill6,9,Tue Jul 14 17:23:35 2015 UTC,"Oh wow, the process. Well I have a fairly large sword forge which is powered by a hand crank and I use coal from Virginia. The material I used a mild hardness steel dirt stake, about a half inch thick and maybe about 2 and a half feet long.  When I can find my measuring tools I will give some more specific I Numbers.  Anyway next up is working the metal into shape. I did this all with a single 5 pound hammer. Basically you heat it up, get a nice view if the metal on the anvil(don't be afraid to get close, you wanna know where you are hitting) and start spreading it out. Occasionally I would use the opposite side of the hammer (wedge shaped) to push the metal outwards.   Over a long process of hammering and straightening it was time for the handle. It was simple enough, heat it up and beat it down until I had the shoulders which I would clean up later with files. Also I had to make sure it was straight with the blade, so laying it across the anvil and looking down it are repeated often to make sure it is straight.   Also just to clarify I did this all without an assistant, and the whole time I had one end of the sword in my gloved hand to control it. No tongs.   Okay cleaning it up. Filing filing filing. Don't forget sand paper! So I put the sword in a post vice with the blade flat and wide inside so I could work on one side at a time. Starting from the point of the blade, about 5 inches exposed and part of the cutting edge secured in the vice, I would start with 30 grit sand paper and work away until 320 grit. This process is by far the longest. (My teacher always says that it is best to forge everything as close to shape as I possible can so i will have less filing and whatnot) after moving the blade down the vice and sandpapering each side I nail the sword to a large 2x4 with one side of the cutting edge hanging off. With my trusty Nicholsons file I went to work and switched sides when necessary. At the end I went over it with 320 grit sandpaper a time or two to shine it up.   (Don't forget WD-40)   Okay I'm not sure to how explain tempering, that part is not my strong area, but basically I moved it through the forge until I had a nice even heat through it and i put it in a vertical quenche tank of oil.  (Mind you all I'm 17 so I might fumble when I am talking about stuff, but I sure know more than most my age)   Okay finnaly the leather on the handle, I cut out strips of deer leather I had, coated the handle in 5 minute epoxy and began wrapping.  Now it is done, if I missed anything I'll be happy to try and explain it.  happy smithing !"
Blacksmith,3d9ile,Vennificus,4,Tue Jul 14 21:12:55 2015 UTC,"Is that shoulder big enough to stop your fingers from slipping onto the blade in absence of a guard? If not, don't thrust with it."
Blacksmith,3d9ile,Vennificus,4,Tue Jul 14 15:48:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah, we tested it on a melon. No trouble. I'd was going to put a guard on it but I wasn't sure how it what to make it with."

Blacksmith,3d9ile,moonra_zk,2,Wed Jul 15 02:15:41 2015 UTC,"Use some wood laying around (any hardwood would be perfect). Not hard to make, will keep your fingers in the clear and easily replaceable. Just need a small piece of it, whittle or even just sand it a bit, put it on and it's done.   Main problem would be having it stick to the sword, since you don't seem to have a pommel or a handle that can be taken off and then re-attached with the guard on top.  I also feel like the handle might be a little bit too thick, but maybe the sword is just a little smaller than I think. How long is it and what does it weigh?"
Blacksmith,3d9ile,MagnusTheGreat,2,Tue Jul 14 18:50:17 2015 UTC,I just talked to my teacher and he said on the next sword we will make sure to incorporate a gaurd and also a pommel. The handle is quite grippable and has room for about 3 and a half medium sized hands.
Blacksmith,3d9ile,Stone-Bear,2,Tue Jul 14 21:15:00 2015 UTC,"Ok, so it's basically a longsword without a guard maybe? It looks really nice and kinda like a more practical version of the sword Conan the Barbarian uses. But I am still not convinced about the handle though...To be honest, it looks like it would hurt your hands a LOT to hit something with the sword. Would love it if you'd get more pictures, for 2 reasons: 1. This sword is epic and I am so jealous that you were able to make that. 2. I want to know what the handle looks like from below and from other angles. Just to get a feel for it. It would be greatly appreciated and I'm sure you want to show the sword off a bit more :)"

Blacksmith,3d9ile,Dogthrowawayer,2,Tue Jul 14 22:01:13 2015 UTC,"No worries man :) Take all the time you need, because this is your sword and you don't owe me anything. I wouldn't get offended if you didn't and see no reason why I should. And to be honest, it's your time as well, which might or might not be valuable in one way or another. I simply just want to take a better look at the sword and you are pretty awesome for letting me do that.  But this blade is pretty nice. Did you fold the metal? And is the leather strapping comfortable to hold? And from the size of your hand, I can approximately figure out the size of the sword and (although less accurately) the weight of it.  EDIT: My guess is that the sword is about 1 meter long, maybe a little bit shorter and possibly weighs about 1.2 or 1.3 kilos. I would also say that the blade length is a little bit off compared to the handle, but that's just my opinion, because I am more attracted to long and more pointed blades."
Blacksmith,3d9ile,sailorjc,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:15:51 2015 UTC,"No metal folding involved, the texture and design you see is achieved by not all the way taking out hammer marks, although if my teacher let's me use his power hammer it is possible that one of the next swords will be indeed damascus.  I find the leather comfy, and the people whom I have let swing the sword around have no complaints about it. But I am excited to have a wooden handle on my next sword."
Blacksmith,3d9ile,Arvald,2,Tue Jul 14 22:24:05 2015 UTC,"It might be because you/they probably only hit soft things. I mean, of course you're not going to battle with it but taking the impact holding pretty much directly on the tang is always kinda painful.  But anyway, do you know where the point of balance is? With such a large handle I'd imagine it's pretty close to it, but I wanted to know just for curiosity's sake."
Blacksmith,3d9ile,JJMcGee83,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:50:22 2015 UTC,Yeah I suppose battling is a different story. The balance is a bit above the blade. I am in the shop right now so I don't have the sword on hand at the moment and can't be for sure.
Blacksmith,3d9ile,fazuku,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:52:38 2015 UTC,"It's just that I have noticed a bit of a trend with this kind of handles and that's that it can be very annoying swinging it without gloves and even with gloves, they tear a bit. But I am glad that's not happening with you.   Oh, and good luck with the Damascus method...You are gonna need it. Even with a power hammer, it can be difficult and time consuming. Even for blacksmithing. But the texture you can get and the strength is so worth it."

Blacksmith,3darmx,account_information,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:29:31 2015 UTC,"I'm fairly new to the blacksmith/forging scene. However, the clamps appear to be made of similar steel as the railroad spikes I've picked up. At least, the rust appears to be similar. They are thick probably about 3/4"" by 1/2"" as a high estimate. I'm hoping to be able to draw them out to a good length (18""+) once straightened."
Blacksmith,3darmx,ConvertsToMetric,2,Wed Jul 15 04:19:21 2015 UTC,They're not similar steel - the clamps (rail anchors) will be spring steel.  They're suitable for making blunt or edged tools and pretty good for knives; the spikes are quite bad for either purpose.
Blacksmith,3darmx,ColinDavies,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:37:05 2015 UTC,"Thanks. Spring steel is usual pretty hard, will I have to anneal the spring steel piece a few times to get it into a workable state?"

If you wiki it you will find it rates as some of the finest metalurgical coal in the US.  Low sulphur, cokes easily and hardly any clinker.  Moving heavy stuff around costs.  I  sell it in the Pacific Northwest, and depending on where it is as low as $25 per 50#, and up depending on shipping costs."
Blacksmith,3dap4p,Yum_MrStallone,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:11:18 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the info. I'm pretty new at this so bear with me here... I get these hard chunks that are almost metallic in color and won't break down at all is this what you guys call clinkers?  The stuff is great, way easier than natural wood charcoal, about the same price as anthracite for me which I tried just to see what it's all about, stuff gets way too hot, I mainly use it to melt down aluminum scrap into ignots but it keeps melting through my mild steel crucible...."
Blacksmith,3dap4p,Yum_MrStallone,2,Wed Jul 15 01:44:00 2015 UTC,"Clinker is the mineral left over that won't vaporize or burn.  It often has glassy blobs and/or rough spikey bits that look like lava, or yellowish fragile bits.  Each coal will make a different clinker.  Some will make big solid ""doughnuts"" that will completely block the air 'til you wonder why the fire won't heat up.  Others, the high quality stuff, may not make any clinker that you notice until you clean the fire pot.  The good coal will allow you to forge all day with maybe one cleaning at lunch time.  They junk coal will plug you up every hour, forcing you to rebuild your fire and making it impossible to weld."
Blacksmith,3dap4p,TMIB,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:02:38 2015 UTC,"Thanks, that's kinda what I figured it was but now I know for sure. So the best way to deal with it is to just straight up clean out the coal huh, I've been kinda just pushing the chunks aside and ramming a dowel through my grate to get more air. Is this why the 'nice' forges use a side air source as opposed to a bottom fed air source?  Ooh and last thing, just to get my terminology straight, the coke is the lighter powdery stuff you get as it's burning up, right?"
Blacksmith,3dap4p,thane017,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:12:41 2015 UTC,"If you have ""not so good coal"", the clinkers will stick together in lumps that you can pull out with a hook and keep your fire intact.  Even with good coal you need to periodically break up the bottom of the fire to allow a good air flow.  It really helps to have a clinker breaker and ash dump built in.  The coke is to coal as charcoal it to wood.  It is lighter, but not powdery.  It tends to stick together.  Good coal (with a high coke button of 9 or better) will make large masses that you need to break up and push down into your fire as it is consumed.  A side blast forge tends to stay clean longer, but to remove the ash you need to dig out the fire.  With a bottom blast the ash falls through the grate to the ash dump."
Blacksmith,3dap4p,Yum_MrStallone,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:31:21 2015 UTC,"We've been using some we bought from /u/Yum_MrStallone at the scout camp smithy. The stuff is great! The coal we used in years past was some old furnace coal we had donated. That stuff was dirty, nasty, sulfur-filled coal. Every hour or so we'd have to break apart the fire and pull out big chunks of clinker. After a few hours, some of the forges would have clinker the size of dinner plates.  This Pocahontas smithing coal is the polar opposite. Watching the small pieces coke up, they almost act like popcorn. You can watch them expand as they transform, and they stick to the other bits of coke around it, which makes these big chunks of coke that look almost like charcoal left over from a wood fire. It ""hives"" nicely that way, and it's great to build a little ""cave"" in the fire pot with your metal nestled nicely inside. It makes forge welding a breeze that way, as you have your metal in this slightly reducing atmosphere, but can still see the surface of your metal cleanly. Oh, and it burns nice and hot! Really great stuff."

I went to a carboot and got three lump hammers for a quid. Easy.   Tongs - more difficult. You can have a go with some big pliers, locking pliers etc but I didn't find them to work very well. You can make your own once the other three tools are in place, or you can grab some from http://quickanddirtytools.com/.  Anvil - Literally any chunk of steel bigger than the face of your hammer. If you can get a piece of railroad track, forklift tine, or just a large thickish bit of steel scrap from a junkyard, score.  A bigger hammer, set into a tree trunk does me fine. Here's mine.  You're not supposed to bang hardened steel together, but it's very difficult to find a reasonably priced 'lump' of steel in the UK.   Forge - moderately difficult. Mine at the minute is a trough BBQ lined with kitty litter (vermaculite), with an airbed inflator blowing a LOT of air in. Stick charcoal in, light it up, gets pretty hot. Not ideal, but good enough to start.   Overall cost, about $60, your price, give or take $20 either way depending on what you've already got lying around/can find/the area."
Blacksmith,3dah7s,Codeworks,2,Tue Jul 14 19:58:57 2015 UTC,"How much is ""that much money""? A lot of my tools have come from flea markets and scrap yards. Still its going to cost ~30 dollars for a small basic set up.    Hammer - What Codeworks said, you don't need a special hammer to start forging. I spent 4 dollars on 5 hammer heads from my local flea market, Salem NH, and then made handles for them myself out of a fallen hickory tree. You can even use a common claw hammer to start blacksmithing.  Anvil - Anything that can take a hit and not break into small pieces. Yes, a large metal anvil would be ideal but if you're just starting out and not willing to invest- a bigger hammer would suffice. I spent 15 dollars on a 50lb block of metal from a scrapyard and that has worked fine for me. Recently I upgraded, downgraded?, to a 110 pound granite block I found near my house and that has worked even better than my block of metal.  Tongs - Your first blacksmithing project. I used pliers to make my first set of tongs. This video shows you how to make a very basic, but very functional, set of beginners tongs. Forge - Visit a scrapyard and find a brake drum and then follow one of the many guides on how to turn that into a forge. One could even use a hole in the ground as a forge; it just has to be something that can hold fuel and be able to withstand a lot of heat. This is what people used before and can be emulated with some bricks and mud. What I use right now is an 8in 300 PSI steel pipe end cap that I found in the woods.  Forge Air Source - Hair dryer with ""Cool"" setting. Go to your local Salvation Army, Goodwill, thrift store to pick one up for ~3 dollars.  Bench Vise - You wont NEED one of these to start forging, but it will become a necessity after you start getting into it. Scrap yards and flea markets have big bench vises for ~20 dollars. Again, you wont NEED this to start making stuff.  A leg/post vise would be much better suited for blacksmith work but those are less common and more expensive, at least where I live, to buy.  Belt Grinder - This is the most expensive machine you will buy as a hobby blacksmith if you're interested in using power tools. This is another thing you don't necessarily need to start forging and finishing stuff you've made. The same job a grinder can do, a file can do- just much slower. I spent $300 on my belt grinder and now have put in another 100 to get it working well. Buy a bench vise before you get one of these, unless you come across an amazing deal.    Edit: I suck at formatting"

Blacksmith,3d9nfq,SaxtonHale2112,2,Tue Jul 14 17:13:30 2015 UTC,"yep i used it for my first smithing sessions, very expensive though, might want to find a more reliable and cheaper source (bulk coal, make your own charcoal, etc)"
Blacksmith,3d9nfq,SaxtonHale2112,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:22:46 2015 UTC,"how long should the bag i posted last if im only filling a space approximately the size of a coffee can? (used it for molding my cement) since i dont know how long that stuff actually will last.  and i plan on making my own, but parents are a little shaky about the concept of me starting a fire in the first place, let alone one with real wood."
Blacksmith,3d9nfq,SaxtonHale2112,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:21:40 2015 UTC,"Well that really depends on what you are doing and how hot you are getting it. We were doing just basic shaping/bending/twisting using moderate amounts of air, but since charcoal is not very dense compared to coal, a bag only lasted me about one 3-4 hour session. I never did any forge welding but if i did it would take about 50% more fuel probably.  What do you mean by filling space the size of a coffee can? Is that the size of your fire pot?"
Blacksmith,3d9nfq,SaxtonHale2112,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:10:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah, although im probably going to make it bigger (so around the size of a mini grill), and using a crappy fan for the oxygen supply, so it probably wont be that bad.  Do you think the bag would be enough to flatten and do some small shaping on a lawnmower blade? because after that i'll probably be able to secure a supply of coal or make my own charcoal.  although, as far as coal goes, how much smoke and scent does it make? my neighbors are alright with standard bonfire/bbq smoke levels, but i feel like i'd get complaints if it smelled notably smokey or whatever for over 100 feet, or made a ton of smoke."
Blacksmith,3d9nfq,SaxtonHale2112,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:32:26 2015 UTC,"Hard to say if that would be enough, maybe buy two bags I'd say. That is dependent on how fast you can work and how much you can get done between heats.  Coal smells like coal, and burning a lot does make a strong coal scent. Are you in a city with close neighbors? My forge is on an acreage so I don't have this problem, but I'm pretty sure burning coal in my nearest city breaks some smoke-related bylaws. Also pro tip: make sure you know what kind of coal you are buying. there isn't just ""coal"". You want unoiled coal(oiled is for lubrication of stoker mechanisms); any grade closest to bituminous metallurgical coal is ideal. unfortunately where I live that kind of coal is expensive and difficult to acquire, so i make do with subituminous coals from local mines. They are full of impurities and are hard to smith with effectively, but very inexpensive. That bag was $12, while this coal was ~$45 for 2000 lbs."
Blacksmith,3d9nfq,ConvertsToMetric,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:48:25 2015 UTC,"wait shit where do you get 2k pounds of coal for 45 dollars?  and after some research, i actually might just want to do one or two gas burners."
Blacksmith,3d9nfq,Zlytheis,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:50:49 2015 UTC,"I actually just 2 seconds ago got back from getting more coal, I got 1000 pounds for $40, sorry I was misled its ~$80 per 2000 lbs. and this is saskatchewan, my dealer gets it from a surface mine in alberta but it really isn't top grade stuff at all. and for a city forge, that may actually be a good idea, i hear that gas burners are harder to make and harder to get super-high heats, but gas does burn really clean."

Blacksmith,3d8qvo,ProjectFrostbite,5,Tue Jul 14 11:33:06 2015 UTC,"There are two ways I know of to do this.  You either work for many years as a hobbyist while pursuing another career, or you go to college/university (or a correspondingly intense, focused, and long program of study) for blacksmithing. The gold standard for blacksmithing degrees in North America right now is probably SIU, but there are others.  Besides forging you will need to learn design and drawing skills, finishing methods, metallurgy, welding, art history, etc."
Blacksmith,3d8qvo,ColinDavies,2,Tue Jul 14 13:28:53 2015 UTC,"I was thinking of becoming an apprentice under a blacksmith to learn my skills. I think my worst skills would be design and drawing.  Could you give me an example of the sort of work I would need to make, for example, a knife? (in terms of what would need to be done, what sort of design work, etc)"
Blacksmith,3d8qvo,ColinDavies,2,Tue Jul 14 13:46:37 2015 UTC,"I'm not a bladesmith, so I can't tell you much about that and what I do may be wrong.  I would say that knife making is mostly about seeing the edges very accurately and feeling the behaviour of your tools so you can know how much material you're removing without having to check every 2 seconds.  When I say seeing, I mean the same kind of seeing that is necessary for accurate drawing: observing what is actually in front of you rather than what your brain is filling the gaps with.  Maybe that sounds trivial, but most people tend towards making stuff up rather than seeing it, and don't realize it's happening.  It's one of the big things you learn in an introductory drawing course.  Again, I'm not sure how it works for bladesmiths, but for North American blacksmiths there is not really any such thing as a formal apprenticeship.  You could be an employee and learn on the job, but you would not be hired with absolutely no skill.  You'd need to be useful to your employer doing something they need to do a lot of but don't want to (welding, grinding, etc.).  Sweeping floors and putting tools away just can't fill enough hours to pay for your education.  So, get some relevant courses under your belt and/or start forging on a hobby basis, then see about looking for blacksmithing work.  I see you are in the UK.  I think you guys have a 2 year apprenticeship, but I know next to nothing about it.  Someone who has strong opinions about it is Michael Budd, a professional smith who cares a lot about blacksmithing education. He would be worth getting in touch with for advice.  For strength training, I find striking a large tire at anvil height with a 10lb sledge is pretty useful.  Keep the pace fairly relaxed but go for endurance.  You can pick up the form from old forging videos on YouTube - there are a few from 1904 (?) that have lots of striking.  New videos can have some pretty hesitant and bad technique mixed in, since often at smithing conferences they like to let inexperienced volunteers do some striking."
Blacksmith,3d8qvo,beammeupscotty2,3,Tue Jul 14 23:38:52 2015 UTC,"As Colin has suggested, if you want to make a living as a blacksmith or something related to blacksmithing, going to university is probably your best route as long as you go to the right university.  Your first step however, is to see if you have aptitude and affinity for the craft before you go making any life changing plans.  The only way to find that out is to take some classes and see.   I wouldn't bother doing any exercise.  The muscles you will need will develop while you are doing the work."
Blacksmith,3d8qvo,ArtistCeleste,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:49:39 2015 UTC,"Ah, yes, good points.  I think I'll get a job, get some money together to pay for a day course then go from there.

Blacksmith,3d8qvo,BleedingHawthorne,2,Tue Jul 14 13:53:19 2015 UTC,"I had the same opinion about exercise for years and never bothered doing strength training until last August. As a petite woman lifting heavy weights is one of the best decisions I ever made. It's been so very useful for me especially as a blacksmith. But, I am sure you can get along just fine without it."
Blacksmith,3d8qvo,BleedingHawthorne,3,Tue Jul 14 17:53:43 2015 UTC,"I apprenticed, for a short while, under a man who did it as his living. Now, he was not the brightest man, but he did manage to eek out a living, if only just barely. If you can become well known for strong tools that are nice in the hand, then it may become easier, but until then it will be quite hard, especially if you want to have a family. You must also decide on what source of fuel you will want to use. If there is no client buying, then it does not matter how hard you work, there is no revenue."
Blacksmith,3d8qvo,ColinDavies,4,Tue Jul 14 19:57:28 2015 UTC,"Having been an apprentice, what are you currently doing?  I don't mind living frugally, I must admit that I still live with my parents, but uni will be a great time to learn just how frugal I can be, I've done a lot of planning with stuff like food.  I must admit that I am rather coming at this with a definite angle, but I'm so definite about my angle that I know it's not reasonable as a start up. I love historical European martial arts, so my end goal is to end up making nothing but metal swords, mostly blunt, but maybe the odd sharp decorative piece. Before then, and for a long time, I'll make just about anything I need to. Where I live, there are also quite a lot of farms, so I might manage to survive.  Sounds like becoming an engineer would be best, as they have a high employability, and then test the smiting waters later."
Blacksmith,3d8qvo,jewsdidukraine,2,Tue Jul 14 21:32:26 2015 UTC,"I am currently in school my self after going into psychology, and now computer science. Unfortunately, being still in school i am renting and do not have a place to smith because I am inside the city.   Engineers are highly employable. I personally would suggest becoming a metallurgist. This is a specialized field within chemistry/engineering, but it is highly applicable to blacksmithing. It would give you a huge edge in knowing what you are doing. Know that first year of uni can be a bit of a drag because of breadth of the classes they want you to take, but as you continue it really becomes interesting.   Engineering degrees are not for the faint of heart and will be nearly impossible if you do not have a very firm understanding of mathematics, and an aptitude for the sciences.   Whatever you choose, I hope the best for you."

Blacksmith,3da12p,thatstheguy,3,Tue Jul 14 17:45:46 2015 UTC,"Those aren't stainless, they're galvanised - coated in zinc to prevent rust. DO NOT heat or grind them without a gas mask; zinc gives off dangerous fumes.  If you want to forge a ring, there are plenty of easier ways. Start with a bar of brass or copper, punch or drill a hole through it, then widen it on a ring mandrel. You should be able to do it cold. If you want to make it from steel, get a nail or thick piece of high-tension wire (make sure it's not galvanised; if it is, you can remove the coating with hydrochoric acid) and bend it round a mandrel."

Blacksmith,3da12p,staklininkas,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:50:46 2015 UTC,"""melt it down and cast it"" No, probably not.  It is very difficult to do cast steel.  At melting temperatures, steel oxidizes into iron-oxide, which is brittle worthless gunk.  Widening it on a mandrel could conceivably work; however it is a pain in the butt to forge.  It does not like to move.  The chromium fumes off of stainless are sorta bad for you, but something small like that, just do it outside, and don't try to snort the thing."

Blacksmith,3d5pmn,FJ1906,2,Mon Jul 13 20:24:22 2015 UTC,"It's in fantastic shape; the photo doesn't do it justice. I estimated from the serial number (in the 210,000s) that it was probably made somewhere in the early 1940s, and it looks like it has barely seen a hammer. The edges are pristine and sharp all around except for a previous smith's ground-in bevel.  Do you know how the late-model American ones from the Columbus anvil works were made? This thing looks like all wrought to a weld-seam halfway down the waist, and then the base is I don't know what. I read somewhere they purchased bases and welded their own tops to it. It almost looks like it has arc or gas welds around it, but I can see fuller or peen marks that look like it could have been fire-welded and then maybe dressed with weld rod.  Also, the hardy hole appears to be burned through it. I've never had an anvil where the hole was torch/thermite cut."
Blacksmith,3d5pmn,FJ1906,3,Tue Jul 14 00:23:03 2015 UTC,"That's great! I have enjoyed every Trenton I've had the chance to work on and I love the two that I have. My Acme is pretty much in the same condition as yours. I can still see factory grind lines and only one part of an edge has been rounded by a previous Smith.  Try and get some close up does of the serial number and I'll see if I can look up the date for you. The hardy and pritchel holes were always punched, maybe someone tried to enlarge the hole?   They did buy their bases and then arc weld them on. The bases were cast iron I believe and from the waist up was forged iron with a forge welded tool steel faceplate.   Congrats on a nice anvil!. Hope you got a good deal on it"
Blacksmith,3d5pmn,FJ1906,2,Tue Jul 14 01:07:09 2015 UTC,"214747 is the SN. There is definitely a drip of steel at the bottom of the hardy hole and it is a little rough. What size would be normal for a 300#? That would probably answer the question.  Did they have pointed bases for the arc welding? Or how did they get it to take all the way to the center?  And yes, I got an embarrassingly awesome deal on it."
Blacksmith,3d5pmn,FJ1906,2,Tue Jul 14 01:14:22 2015 UTC,"I'll have to double check my copy of AIA to see if they mention hardy hole size and to get the date, I'll get back to you in just a bit.   I have actually always wondered what they did for the weld joint of the base and body of the anvils once they switched to arc welding. I know they used a big ass welding rod. I imagine it was a big bevel and then a big machine and rod to get the penetration they needed. I'll have to do some more research on that.   Even though I love my big Peter Wright I recently got I am jealous of a big Trenton. It would be cool to have 3 brother anvils in the shop!"

Blacksmith,3d5pmn,FJ1906,2,Tue Jul 14 01:21:14 2015 UTC,Going by the dates in AIA your anvil was made between the dates of 1943 - April of 1945 which includes the serial numbers 210376 - 216185. You've got yourself a wartime anvil and a great piece of American history. Treat it well and it will last many more generations.   Can't wait to see some pictures of it cleaned up and mounted in your shop!   Edit: There is actually a picture that shows an anvil ready to be welded. I'll post it up in a little bit
Blacksmith,3d5pmn,roy20050,2,Tue Jul 14 01:56:59 2015 UTC,Here is a picture of one about to be welded. I wonder if they do some kind of socket or mating surfaces prior to welding to try and get as much of a solid joint as possible. I know that's a huge electrode but I don't see a completely penetrated weld joint. Maybe that weld was enough to get the performance they needed?
Blacksmith,3d5pmn,TheKoi,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:20:28 2015 UTC,That is frickin cool. It looks like there could be a lug/socket combination going on.

Blacksmith,3d8ge4,Grandpah,3,Tue Jul 14 09:15:39 2015 UTC,"You probably don't want to weld it to the rail. These plates are usually fairly low carbon (in the US at least). And all it would do is make it hard for you to get to the sweet spot over the mass of your anvil. Even with real anvils, we tend to prefer the parts over lot of steel more than something that hangs over air. You don't need a huge surface for forging. If you want to mount it to a stump to use it for a hardy and flattening plate, that would be better than reducing the usefulness of the anvil portion.  I doubt the screw is anything special, but I have no idea. Those clips tend to be fairly high in carbon (at least in the US) since they need to be able to springy to function properly. When you find stuff it's next to impossible to get a specific chemistry for it, unless it has a part number you can look up somewhere. Even then the materials can change from lot to lot...."
Blacksmith,3d8ge4,icecoldcelt,1 point,Tue Jul 14 11:06:08 2015 UTC,"I had a feeling that the plate would compromise the ""sweet spot"" that i've heard so much about. Good to know.   Do you know what kind of steel is used for the springy clips in the US?"
Blacksmith,3d8ge4,ColinDavies,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:34:32 2015 UTC,"Putting it on top like that would detract from the anvil, yes, especially the unsupported areas of the plate.  What you could do instead is attach it so it is just beside and level with the anvil.  It will serve the function of a surface to hold hot steel at anvil height.  You could even make a rectangular notch on one of the corners, then weld it to the side of your rail anvil to make a hardy hole (the head and the web of the rail make the other sides of the hole).  You would have to trim one side of the rail's foot to let the plate sit on top of it.  You will still have the other side of the foot sticking out which you can turn into a fuller, cutter, or small bick/horn.  Rail steel varies in carbon content but it can get pretty high.  For welding it is probably best to preheat and post heat (cool very slowly, using a heat source if necessary), also use stainless rod which will not harden and crack as it cools (the weld pool will pick up some carbon from the base metal)."
Blacksmith,3d6z2u,yelsew5,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:31:38 2015 UTC,Does anybody know about the method they used to start the fire just by hitting the steel with the hammer? Is there some sort of trick to this?
Blacksmith,3d6z2u,ColinDavies,2,Tue Jul 14 00:32:48 2015 UTC,"It is difficult.  The metal gets hot when you deform it; this always happens when hammering metal.  The hard part is heating it fast enough this way as such repeated deformation makes cold steel brittle and a small piece of metal loses heat quickly.  The other hard part is that if you skew the section even slightly it is near impossible to correct without cracking the metal or letting it cool off.  Personally I can make 1/4"" round run temper colours up to grey, but I can't get it to light paper or wood (yet!)."

Blacksmith,3d6o12,kichigai-ichiban,3,Mon Jul 13 23:04:27 2015 UTC,I think you are making a mistake by using castable refractory instead of ceramic wool.
Blacksmith,3d6o12,beammeupscotty2,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:24:41 2015 UTC,how so?
Blacksmith,3d6o12,beammeupscotty2,0,Tue Jul 14 06:01:11 2015 UTC,If you had done the research you would already know the answer.  Look at commercial propane forges and show me one made like what you are proposing.
Blacksmith,3d6o12,beammeupscotty2,2,Tue Jul 14 06:36:16 2015 UTC,"Cool, thanks for the helpful response.  Yeah, it will eventually break down as the material is brittle.  However, I have less invested in this than a roll of Kaowool.  I'm just trying to get something in my price range...  and have fun learning how to make something.  I have no doubt a $900~$2000 pro grade gas forge will outperform this little little guy."
Blacksmith,3d6o12,TheBoognishRising,2,Tue Jul 14 07:25:41 2015 UTC,"The problem with all castable refractory is not that it breaks down over time, pretty much any material you use will have that problem.  The problem is that castable materials typically act as an enormous heat sink, requiring much more time to heat up and wicking away your heat.  You will have to put far more heat into that forge using castable refractory than you would using ceramic wool.  It will simply never heat up as hot as it would using something lighter, more reflective and more insulative than castable, especially home made castable.    You could buy enough ceramic wool for that forge for about $30.00.  You will probably get that $30.00 back in fuel savings within 10 or 15 gallons of propane use, depending on what you are paying for propane.  I built my first forge 23 years ago with a lot of castable in it and it never really got as hot as I wanted."
Blacksmith,3d6o12,SockTroll,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:36:08 2015 UTC,"Ahh, heat loss...  I didn't consider that, but on the upside this mix is really cheap and looks to be relatively easy to remove..  Hopefully the Aluminum Oxide/Sodium Silicate capping will act as a kind of ceramic barrier.  But, the real thing I'm getting out of this is getting my feet wet.  I get so much more understanding from physically doing it, knowing I'll prolly fuckit up a few times...  Rather than sitting around thinking about it.  So if I'm out a couple refills of propane, that's the cost of muscle memory.  So, would you figure an inch lining would have much effect on saving heat?  I'm using a 4"" form and could line it with some wool after I get my hands-on experience.  Heck, I could prolly gouge and reshape the stuff some too, but if it is a total failure I would really only need to get more pearlite.  I have enough of the other components to do this about 4 times over.  I have a problem with getting a smaller amount of wool, no one sells it out here so I will have to order it online...   I've been seeing prices like $60 to $150 for rolls of various lengths and thickness.  I had been looking at this forge build but as I'm lacking a welding unit I put it off.  Is there a place online that sells it in short segments?  I'll need somewhere around a 12~24"" long piece to make the circle...  and maybe a foot in width."
Blacksmith,3d6o12,verdatum,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:12:47 2015 UTC,"My 2 cents: 2x layers of 1"" wool is ideal. You get the benefits of the insulative quality of  2"" of wool, with the added advantage of being able to replace the inner layer exposed to the forge when it gets worn out. This way, you only have to replace a portion of the wool, not all of it."

Blacksmith,3d706q,HydroJoe,3,Tue Jul 14 00:40:23 2015 UTC,"It can be done very cheaply.  Look up third world blacksmithing, Viking and Iron Age blacksmithing, primitive blacksmithing, Indian blacksmithing, etc.  You will see ways of doing it that are effective enough for people to earn a living, but that cost basically nothing.  Also look at YouTube videos by accomplished smiths; there is a recent thread here about exactly this.  Then spend all your time here, at anvilfire, iforgeiron, and the Facebook groups.  Oh, and there are tons of free eBook versions of old forging manuals, many through Google."
Blacksmith,3d706q,ColinDavies,2,Tue Jul 14 00:55:03 2015 UTC,"if you live in a place where you can start a fire you can dig a pit, grab a couple rocks, get a blow dryer, put some coal or wood or charcoal into the pit, put the blow dryer next to the pit blowing on the coals, put some metal in the pit,if the metal is long enough you can pull it out with your hands otherwise use tongs, take it over to the big rock and hit it with the small rock.  if you have a hammer you can use that instead of the small rock, and if you have some big heavy piece of metal you can use that instead of a big rock. everything else is just making things easier, tongs for better grip, a forge for better fire control, coal instead of wood for longer, hotter, burns, different kinds of air control for better burns, anvil for better curves and flats and smoother works with fewer marks, different hammers to move metal in different ways, etc. these are all just things to make thing better, but at the core all you need is something to hammer with, something to hammer against, something to hammer, and something to heat the metal.  if you can't build a pit and light it on fire (say you live in an apartment complex and the landlord really frowns on you lighting the yard on fire) there are forges you can build or you can use a blowtorch (which could give you an idea of whether you think this is fun before you go building a forge, makes a nice step and if you don't like it at least you have a blowtorch) but it will limit you to small things since it doesn't get too hot and loses heat ridiculously fast but you can forge nails into various shapes which i have found to be quite fun (nail swords are nice)"
Blacksmith,3d706q,tuseroni,2,Tue Jul 14 03:06:29 2015 UTC,"I'm no master smith (in fact I'm going to fire up my forge for the first time today; weather permitting) but I can suggest a few things I've seen and heard other people talk about.  You essentially need 5 things to get started:  a hammer, an anvil, a forge, a piece of metal to forge, and safety equipment(faceshield/safety glasses, gloves, etc.).   Finding a hammer and piece of metal are fairly easy, basically any hammer works in a pinch but I would avoid framing hammers cause the claw might pop up and get you in the eye. If you have a ball peen hammer it will work well.  Tongs are also extremely useful but a pair of visegrip pliers will also work if you don't want to spend the money up-front for blacksmithing tools.  As for the metal I've found that railroad spikes are extremely versatile but I'd try forging smaller stuff first such as small steel rods or bars, just experiment with heating and beating it for a while.  Avoid galvanized steel because the fumes they release at high temperatures are noxious  Now for the generally more difficult things to source: the forge and the anvil. I suggest looking on youtube for how-to videos on brake drum forges, they work and you can get the parts cheap or you may have everything you need laying around already.  The fuel is primarily coal, coke, or charcoal (even charcoal briquettes can work but they burn fast and create a lot of ash).  If you have time look up how-tos on gas or propane forges, even if you don't go for them its best to learn the strengths and weaknesses of each type of forge.  As for the anvil I wouldn't purchase one just yet, just try to find a big piece of flat metal (preferably hardened steel).  If you actually get into it I know a lot of people will recommend against it but you can buy a cheap 50lb cast anvil for like 60 bucks and it'll work for a while so long as you don't beat it up too hard.  Alternatively people sell pieces of railroad track for under 100 bucks (minus shipping) on ebay.  Which again a lot of people wont recommend but its a big lump of hard steel and it'll work if you need it to.  If you do find out you like it and want to keep doing it make sure you get the right tools (or make them there's plenty of tutorials and advice out there) everything I've suggested is a fairly short term solution and not nearly as effective or safe as it could be with the right equipment.  I got lucky because I had everything lying around for the forge and I found a piece of track from the repairs the railroad near my house was doing so I'm $0.00 in and ready to start forging (my case probably isn't typical though).  Again, I'm not much further ahead than you are so take my advice with a grain of salt and if anyone with more experience wishes to add to or amend anything I've rattled off feel free to do so.  Good luck and be safe about it."

Blacksmith,3d51s4,6AriesOrionAquarius9,2,Mon Jul 13 16:09:56 2015 UTC,"Your anvil is likely either all steel (cast), or steel faced with a wrought iron body.  There's not enough information to tell a specific manufacturer/date/process.  The only thing I can say is it's a nice looking anvil that appears to have been well taken care of.  It would help to have photos in better focus with higher contrast, some with tangential lighting to reveal any markings on the sides.  If you remove the paint and any surface rust then it will be easier to see markings if they exist.  No comment on size, as it is next to impossible to judge anvil weight just by looking at it.  Throw it on a bathroom scale to find out.  Your forge is not shaped like a forge, but it's what you have now.  Look at commercially available and antique coal forges for reference, not other beginners' first attempts.  Use what you have for now but build another at your earliest opportunity.  Adding to Eponiah's thoughts on protecting the anvil, some smiths choose to work with soft hammers for this reason.  I've never suggested it before or done it myself, but it could be a good idea to draw the temper on your hammer heads all the way just while you are starting out.  There will be much less chance of dinging up your anvil face.  If the hammer gets a dent, well, it is not so difficult to dress a soft hammer face in comparison to a hardened anvil."

I found rail spikes and scrap around town, which required a lot of looking. I have searched free on craigslist for scrap no dice, big box home stores didn't have anything good to use, just a bunch of galvanized metal. The metal supply companies require an account or to purchase volume.   Edit: I just found a supplier who deals with small quantities, quoted me 1/2"" diameter A36 hot rolled steel 12"" long peice $1.00 per ft, and $2 cutting fee.

Blacksmith,3d51s4,tuseroni,2,Mon Jul 13 18:58:03 2015 UTC,"I work at a steel supply, and A36 isn't good for knives because of its low carbon content. Ornamental is fine, but they make a steel for tools (tool steel, use mcmastercarr.com or new jersey steel baron) for any tool steel or knife steel.  Also, as a salesman I would advise against buying the 12"" increments. HR round rod comes 20' lengths, so if you have a big enough vehicle, ask them to just whack it in half for you-they shouldn't charge you unless they are money hungry or they don't do a lot of walk-ins. You'll save money this way too and here's why:  Given HR a36 is 65 cents a pound (we usually get it for around 50), a 12"" piece is .43 cents base. Mark that up 30%, it becomes .61 cents. So, not only is he charging you $2 per cut, but he is also making an extra .40 cents off each piece. A 20' length, however, is $8.68 dollars base, turning into $12.40 when marked up 30%.   So, either you spend 13 bucks on a full length, or youre spending almost 60 dollars for 20pcs @ 12"".

Blacksmith,3d4zv1,AeroFace,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:13:16 2015 UTC,Do you mean crucible or do you mean fire pot? Crucibles aren't used in smithing (to my knowledge). That's more a smelting/casting question.

Blacksmith,3d2hsg,AZGUY10,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:07:24 2015 UTC,I have never found one. I have just started going to steel supply places. It is probably more expensive but at least it got me going. Any junk yard in town should sell you a brake drum or some brake shops may just give you one. Here are two suppliers I have been to. They are on different sides of town and Advanced metal will not sell you anything under a 20' stick unless they have it on hand in their scrap pile but they will cut it down for you after you have purchased it.  Industrial has many different lengths available for purchase.  https://www.industrialmetalsupply.com/ http://www.advancedmetalsales.com/
Blacksmith,3d2hsg,teiknethal,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:20:10 2015 UTC,"I've gone to Pick-A-Part before for scrap metal in the past. It's pretty much a car graveyard that you go out and find what you need, collect/take it out (they don't do any work/provide any tools/lifts). I can't remember specifically if all the brake drums were stripped or not, but I highly doubt it.  You can go down there with a toolset of hammers, wrenches (impact preferably, the stuff is russsty), WD-40, etc. If you have a generator + angle grinder with cutoff wheel and you wanna do it QUICK you can just go down there and cut it out of a random car in a few minutes.  Find a car with the drums, and give the counter-guy the make/model and ask for a quick estimate to be sure, but shouldn't cost more than 5-10 bucks I'd figure.  http://www.mypickapart.com/"
Blacksmith,3d0qu3,Zazafraz13,9,Sun Jul 12 15:29:08 2015 UTC,"Yup, the more secure your anvil is from moving around the more energy is transferred into your work."
Blacksmith,3d0qu3,FJ1906,2,Sun Jul 12 16:10:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the tighter the better.  You get the top of your stand precompressed a bit, so when you strike it takes away less energy by squishing."
Blacksmith,3d0qu3,ColinDavies,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:01:56 2015 UTC,"If your anvil is able to bounce around, all of that bouncing represents wasted energy. Strapping the anvil to something heavy means that more of the energy goes into that inelastic collision that manifests itself as squished metal.  It also lets more energy go into raising your arm back up in preparation for the next hammer strike."

This was one of those HC railroad spikes which from what I understand is only about 0.3% carbon. I used salt water with some soap in it to quench it which seems to have worked pretty well. A file slides right off, but it still takes a tiny bit of material off. I cleaned it up with a wire wheel on an angle grinder and then ground it on a bench grinder and a small belt grinder. The edge didn't come out very good, it's very convex. I need to work on a better way of grinding it."

Just dont try to burn zinc off in an enclosed space and dont be near by."
Blacksmith,3cwxyr,killer122,7,Sat Jul 11 19:01:54 2015 UTC,"Don't, the smarter move if you absolutely must use a galvanized piece, is to go to the hardware store, get some thick rubber gloves and muriatic acid.  Wipe the piece down with the acid, it will eat the galvanization off without releasing zinc oxide. Do this in a well ventilated area because the acid is slightly noxious, not really dangerous, just better not to breathe."
Blacksmith,3cwxyr,fluffy-d-wolf,2,Sat Jul 11 15:16:39 2015 UTC,"It is hydrogen gas that is being emitted with atomized acid particles.

Hydrogen embrittlement will decrease the usable life of the piece."

Blacksmith,3cwxyr,fluffy-d-wolf,4,Sat Jul 11 18:37:59 2015 UTC,"I dont think I would worry about it in that situation, with welding you are typically right over the part and inadvertantly breathing the smoke coming off the the weld. I doubt you'll be standing over you forge breathing all the heat and fumes coming out.  But like the other guy mentioned, pool acid will remove it and then you will have no worries. I usually just wrap a wire around whatever im dippining in the acid and dunk it for about one minute and then rinse with water.  Not a big deal, but after the acid dip and water rinse, it will start wanting to rust almost immediately if you dont rub it with oil or paint it."
Blacksmith,3cwxyr,callmemoch,1 point,Sat Jul 11 17:34:18 2015 UTC,"I actually tried the Muriatic Acid method on a galvanized steel bucket last night. It worked really well. I put about 1.5-2 inches of Muriatic Acid/Water mix in the bottom of a bin and put the bucket in there sideways, rotating it every few minutes to cover the whole thing.   If the fitting you want to use is smallish (6 inches or less) I would definitely use this method if I were you, just take some precautions as the other guys said. Big heavy rubber gloves, safety glasses, long sleeves, etc. I kept holding my breath when I approached it to turn the bucket and then stand back 8 or 9 feet... didn't have any problems.   The only thing I'd do differently is use less acid. Muriatic acid is actually just Hydrochloric Acid mixed with water - about 30/70 respectively. But to dissolve the zinc coating on the steel you probably only need 10-15% acid in the solution. (The stuff is cheap. I got 4 litres for about $12)  So I'd recommend putting the fitting in a bin and adding water until its completely or almost completely submerged. Then slowly add the acid to the water until you see the reaction taking place. (It gets really fizzy and the water gets cloudy) When the reaction is done the solution will very quickly stop fizzing and go clear again. The few bubbles left forming is due to the acid (much more slowly) eating the steel. You want to take it out at this point.   Finally you'll want a bunch of baking soda on hand. Mix some with water in a plastic bowl and when you take the fitting out of the acid, plob it in the baking soda water to neutralize the solution on it. Then add baking soda to the acid solution a little at a time until it stops fizzing. Don't dispose of the solution until you've completely neutralized it. I imagine this will be easier and require less baking soda if you dilute it a lot with water like I said.   Neutralizing for me took a full box of baking soda."

Blacksmith,3cwai4,Zazafraz13,3,Sat Jul 11 11:40:48 2015 UTC,You'll end up with iron inclusions from the forging process (hammer and anvil) and it won't be very stainless anymore unless you polish it well. Brushing often will help minimize the amount of polishing you'll have to do.

Now on to your forge idea. Yes, it looks to be needlessly complex but that doesn't mean it won't work. The design looks like an odd mashup between a traditional solid fuel forge and a gas forge. I would choose one of the two styles and stick with it. Smithing has been around a very long time and while new ideas are great, the wheel doesn't need to be re-invented. I personally would just invest the time and money into a known concept if I were starting to re-learn.   Some ideas to think about: -If you do plan on using solid fuel, how do you plan on effectively distributing it as it gets consumed? Coal also get's pushed around an awful lot while working and you may end up with a clog at the end of your tunnel.  -Coal (not coke) has many impurities that are burned off in order to form coke. These impurities can affect the steel's properties.  -Having effectively three fire pots can be an enormous waste of fuel. Especially since a work piece (as long as a 55 gal drum) seldom needs to be all hot at the same time. At most when shaping steel you will be focusing on around 10"" segments at a time.  -If you plan on working small, will the whole length of the forge be needed? Can you restrict airflow to just one or two of the pipes? -A bathroom fan works great for a single pot forge, but you've effectively tripled the amount of work it needs to accomplish. Blowers need to produce a large volume of air, and splitting it three ways cuts each pot's volume by a third.   Edit: accidentally hit submit and wanted to rant a bit more."
Blacksmith,3cw6nm,Zazafraz13,1 point,Sat Jul 11 11:20:49 2015 UTC,Thank you for the information and the comforting start. Those are some thing i didn't think of and after some thought I would like to share what I thought of. First I would be using a solid fuel as I have no way of getting a good propane source but a decent way of getting coal. Originally I had talked to the same guy about a smaller forge but he started telling me about the supplies he has and how it would cost the same for this behemoth as it would for the small one. It was more of a why not go big at the time thought. I think I might go win my original idea of standing up the drum and cutting it to size down to the single burner instead of the mess I ended up doodling. Should make things a lot simpler if I just have an opening I can pass the metal through instead of heating the whole thing up at once. The only real reason it could have been so big was tempering or something but even then I don't think it would have worked out too well.
Blacksmith,3cw6nm,beammeupscotty2,1 point,Sat Jul 11 13:56:24 2015 UTC,"There is no need for a full enclosure on a solid fuel forge, and in fact building one this way would make it very difficult to use and expensive to run.  Particularly if you are working by hand, there is typically no need to heat up 20"" or more of your material at one time, even if you are making a sword.  When using a power hammer perhaps, but not for hand work.  You would be much better off with a more conventional design, like one of these:  http://www.blacksmithsdepot.com/products/forge-fan-fuel/rolling-coal-forge.html  which is not to say you need to drop $1400.00 on a forge, but this is the sort of design  you should be emulating.  It is a professional design and will do just about anything you need."

Weight markings don't seem to be visible, but based on the size I'd say 300 is a reasonable price. Face looks fairly smooth (not necessarily flat, which is not a bad thing necessarily) and I don't see any noticable chips or dents that would reduce its integrity. I'd go for it. However, I'd advise you to take advice from other comments if they come, since I'm fairly new to this and don't own a real anvil myself. I'm certainly no expert."

Basically, the hand holding the tongs would not necessarily support their weight."

However, it's also pretty much guaranteed to be toxic, so by allowing her to do this you're quite likely slowly allowing her to build a toxicity of some kind. If there are heavy metals present, they will persist for a long time in her body, and the more she eats, the quicker something very bad will happen. I can't find any evidence as to the exact composition of clinkers, but I would highly recommend you move your clinker bucket."

I work a lot, and barely afford mortgage so I couldn't just build a forge and start a new craft without m'lady remarking on unwisely spent dollars... So I got a side job with a variety of work flooring, drywall, sump pump, railing. I initially gave them a price for a wood railing but one day I was on break and noticed their front porch railing made of welded steel so I offered them a super reasonable price to give them a matching railing instead, I had welded before never did a scroll or really any hot metal work, I just kinda did what would be the most logical thing to do and it worked out really well... And that's how I managed to got into blacksmithing... Actually used forge 2.1 to make new muffler brackets to fix my girls car, looks like the new forge is here to stay, Hehe..."
Blacksmith,3cqu8y,Maximus_E,3,Fri Jul 10 01:12:27 2015 UTC,"It would work. But likely not well for long.  RR track can be difficult to locate sometimes especially if your area is devoid of a rail service. A slightly more reliable source for a makeshift anvil may be your local scrap yard/recycler. Some will allow you to scavenge their yards and purchase scrap for weight value of steel. Anything BIG and solid can work. Even if it lacks a flat face, one can always grind one flat (given enough time). It may not be hardened steel like a proper anvil face and will deform/mar quicker, but just grind it flat again after a while."
Blacksmith,3cqu8y,Zazafraz13,3,Fri Jul 10 02:51:54 2015 UTC,"It's not the best for the primary use of an anvil (heavy, strong thing to hit against).  Still, it will do some of the secondary things you wouldn't get with other makeshift anvils.  If it is like the ones I find, the holes are about 7/8"", which is not bad for a hardy hole.  They will have to be backed up by square holes in the (probably wooden) base.  You could use the ones in the ridges for mounting and the rest for your bick, cutter, fuller, etc. A bick and hot cutter should be your first additions and can be made very simply.  The ridges themselves can serve most of the same functions as the step on a London pattern.  Outside the ridges you have lots of area you don't have to worry about messing up, so that can be your chisel plate.  It should be fine for working small stock at a high heat.  If you do a lot of heavy hitting on thick stock you are probably going to start bending the plate after a while.  Same thing that happens to old wrought iron anvils, but more so.  I would hang onto this for the uses listed above, but keep looking for something heavier and more compact to use as the anvil."
Blacksmith,3cqu8y,ColinDavies,2,Fri Jul 10 12:19:12 2015 UTC,"I used one of these for quite some time before getting a piece of railroad track, they aren't hardened like the track is and will dent and chip. It made for some really holed railroad track knives.  Hey, gotta start somewhere!"

I suspect lots of people use tie plates as anvils but you will find yourself severely limited long term if you go that route.  A tie plate will likely distort over time, and probably not that much time, and it does not provide for a hardy hole,  pritchel hole or a bick, all of which are pretty necessary for any sort of advanced smithing."

Blacksmith,3cogpg,tuseroni,4,Thu Jul 9 14:23:50 2015 UTC,"It's very unlikely that you'll be able to get enough heat into the steel to get a good forge weld using just a propane torch.  You could try using mapp gas instead,  which burns a bit hotter,  but you still need to use a flux of some sort when doing this.  The correct answer though is to get a forge.  I got started for less than 45 dollars with a break drum forge and scavenging everything else."
Blacksmith,3cogpg,drewmsmith,2,Thu Jul 9 14:50:50 2015 UTC,"It wont be hot enough to forge weld using just a torch.    But if that's all you're working with, you're better off practicing your hammer blows and not worrying about forge welding until you've upgraded the gear a bit."
Blacksmith,3cogpg,GabrielDunn,2,Thu Jul 9 14:52:01 2015 UTC,"I'm no black smithing expert but as I understand it you need white hot temperatures to achieve enough metal flow to actually weld the pieces. Sadly, you won't reach those with just a blow torch. Right now you probably have 90% of your heat being dissipated by the air. Try building some sort of shield or vessel to minimize air flow around the piece you are trying to heat (sounds like a forge doesn't it?). One thing I've had some fun doing with a blow torch is some glass work. Find a glass rod and you can soften and bend the glass with just an open air torch. Perhaps try softening and flattening a wine bottle into a spoon tray or a cheese plate. Best of luck!"
Blacksmith,3cogpg,hailoctavian,2,Thu Jul 9 14:56:17 2015 UTC,As someone who has blown glass for 3+ years I would strongly discourage attempting to use a blowtorch to soften anything bigger than a pencil. The torch just doesn't get hot enough for anything with more mass than cane (glass sticks) and you could risk exploding shards of glass everywhere if you're not careful.
Blacksmith,3cogpg,Zazafraz13,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:42:07 2015 UTC,Yeh you basically need a forge for glass too....
Blacksmith,3cogpg,Betruul,2,Thu Jul 9 16:57:40 2015 UTC,Normally aspirated MAPP only burns about 20 C hotter than propane. Normal propane burns at a high enough temperature (1995 C) but it doesn't have the capacity to transfer all of that heat into your piece. Oxygenated propane burns hotter at 2820 C. MAPP w/ oxy burns at about 2900 C. Higher temps means that you need less heat capacity rate to get the piece hot enough.  You can get small oxygen bottles from the hardware store to go with your propane/MAPP torch but you'd need a different torch head. Something like this: http://www.homedepot.com/p/Bernzomatic-OX2550KC-Oxy-Map-Pro-Torch-Kit-331673/203391033#customer_reviews  It would help if you had good refraction around the piece. This allows more heat to be reflected into the metal. Kaolite wool or firebrick could work for you.   I've forge welded with propane but I didn't use natural aspiration. I had to feed oxygen from my welding rig to get it hot enough. I didn't need to flux it since I was near to melting it. I've also used oxy-acetylene (3480 C) to the same effect but it is way more expensive.

Blacksmith,3cogpg,Asshole_for_Karma,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:11:56 2015 UTC,"Yes, if it's yellow, and it's a screw or a nail, it's almost certainly zinc.  Modern nails are almost always galvanized; that, or they're stainless, which you don't really want to be forging either.  That said, galvanization on a nail isn't that much zinc.  If you work outside, and stand upwind, the zinc will burn off, and after that you're no longer at risk.  As others have said, oxy-propane might work, but standard propane blowtorches are painfully slow to heat even small stock.  Refractory helps, but it is still slow.  Oxy-acetylene works wonderfully for forging small localized portions of metal, but you can't afford that.  Nail steel is fairly soft stuff.  Wood nails are usually mild steel that cannot be quench hardened.  Concrete nails and railroad spikes tend to be a bit higher in carbon, so they can be hardened.  If you don't have enough money to buy some grocery store borax, then you should probably hold off on this hobby for a little while.  The cost of fuel alone is more than that.  Forge welding isn't easy; doing it without borax is even more difficult.  Trying to forge weld at a partially orange heat is basically impossible.  You need bright yellow, near white, just shy of sparking-hot.  If you are just trying to make a knife or something like that, there is no benefit in folding a single piece of steel.  If you want a hole, you can drift it with a punch and a mandril, or you can drill it.  Folding a single piece of modern steel doesn't improve the physical properties at all, and it won't grant you the cool looking damascus patterns, as that requires 2 different alloys to create the stripy effect."
Blacksmith,3cogpg,verdatum,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:24:03 2015 UTC,"Yellow nails are either zinc dichromate or glue coated. If you sand off the yellow then keep sanding, do you get two different shades of gray? If so, then it is definitely zinc dichromate and that process can only be done on a already galvanized piece. So you have to sand off the yellow and then keep sanding till all the zinc is off."
Blacksmith,3cogpg,mycousinsweiner,2,Thu Jul 9 19:24:38 2015 UTC,And if he is going to do all that sanding he better wear some sort of respirator to keep from inhaling all that zinc.
Blacksmith,3cogpg,beammeupscotty2,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:30:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah I personally wouldn't be sanding or heating galvanized pieces, it's just too messy and not worth it. You can keep from breathing burnt zinc but it still leaves behind all that residue. OP just said he sanded the nails so I figured I could at least make sure they realize that sanding the yellow off might not be far enough, and given that they said they can't afford borax I'd say a respirator is out of the picture, good advice but out of their budget."
Blacksmith,3cogpg,mycousinsweiner,1 point,Fri Jul 10 05:19:48 2015 UTC,"The risks of zinc are largely exaggerated in the smithing community, but good call removing the coating.  There is a chance it involves hexavalent chromium. Try to collect and dispose of the dust; don't breathe it.  If you are forging in low light, then orange is pretty cold for forge welding.  You would need excellent surface preparation and cleanliness to make that happen.  If you are below the melting point of black iron oxide then flux is pretty much mandatory (unless your parts are cleaned and fit up in a way that excludes oxygen while heating)."
Blacksmith,3cogpg,ColinDavies,1 point,Fri Jul 10 12:40:08 2015 UTC,"Even if you can get it hot enough, heating it in open air with the torch may just be too oxidizing. This means the surface will just be turning to scale and ruining any chance of welding. You can forge weld without flux in a solid fuel forge (if you get the fire right) because there is lots of fuel to use up any spare oxygen, preventing the metal from scaling up. You want a ""reducing fire"" rather than an ""oxidizing fire""."
Blacksmith,3clbt8,3blpro,3,Wed Jul 8 20:16:41 2015 UTC,"It looks like the edges have been somewhat poorly welded.  You might use that fact to talk down the price, or it might already be a factor (very good price if there were no damage)."

If this is true and the rest of the anvil is cast iron, I would be wary. hitting the horn too hard will break it off and most of your hammer's energy will go into the anvil, not bounce back. I have an anvil like this, and it is great, because I have no alternative but it is not worth the same amount of money as a steel one."
Blacksmith,3clbt8,ColinDavies,3,Thu Jul 9 08:55:47 2015 UTC,Those anvils aren't cast iron.  You can see where the feet have been forge welded to the central mass of the body.  That's how the old wrought iron anvils were built up.

Blacksmith,3cik48,arnorath,9,Wed Jul 8 14:10:56 2015 UTC,"Both are common methods of axe making. That said, I don't think slit and drifted eyes were used in the Viking era as it's an example of pretty heavy forging, and the piece of iron would have been welded over again and again anyway before being forged. Lots of examples of original Viking axes show that the material was forge welded shut at the back of the eye, they'd split the steel at the back, draw out the bits that would form the eye and weld them shut.  http://imgur.com/Z2fEtSf"
Blacksmith,3cik48,DrSloughKeg,2,Wed Jul 8 15:01:02 2015 UTC,Cool. I had never heard about the method of forge welding at the back of the eye before. Do you have a primary source on that? I'd like to look into it further.
Blacksmith,3cik48,icecoldcelt,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:57:53 2015 UTC,Damn. thanks a lot.
Blacksmith,3cik48,DrSloughKeg,3,Thu Jul 9 16:24:17 2015 UTC,"gundog48 has it right. In the viking age, iron was more expensive (methods of production from ore were less efficient) so tools and anvils were generally smaller. Taking a large block of iron and punching a hole takes a lot of effort, especially with smaller tools and only striking with hammers.   Folding an axe over like I have shown is a much less energy intensive method, and can make use of smaller starting material (iron was probably sold and traded in relatively small bars). You are right, that if it is not properly welded the axe can fail along the weld line, but so long as the weld is sound it is all good. Interestingly, Viking blacksmiths were not perfect either, and some failed axes give us a clue as to how they were made- http://www.tharkis.com/images/viking/weld2.jpg and http://bladesmithsforum.com/uploads/monthly_06_2011/post-22339-13093667335237.jpg are good examples of this.   Modern axes are mainly made by starting with one block of steel and punching a hole, but that is because modern smiths and factories have heavy equipment like power hammers and presses."
Blacksmith,3cik48,wumbledrive,2,Thu Jul 9 02:55:52 2015 UTC,"Another important thing to note about folded wrought iron axes is the woodgrain structure of the metal strands in wrought iron. If you were to punch a hole, the butt of the axe would be like endgrain of wood, which is much more susceptible to tearing out. When it is folded over, the strands wrap around the handle, making the eye much stronger. This is also true for steel, because it has similar, but much finer grain patterns which are caused by the milling process. This isn't something which you should worry about except when you are working very close to the failure point of the material."
Blacksmith,3cik48,TheBoognishRising,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:06:29 2015 UTC,"That is a really great point. With steel it should matter little especially with annealing before heat treating (at that point the structure should be uniform), but with wrought iron I could see a heavy impact tool (like a splitting maul or sledge hammer) failing if the eye were punched and the wrought iron was of low grade."

With properly functioning 3/4"" burners you should figure on using one burner for approx. every 300 cu. ft. of forge.  900 cu. inches is HUGE. You should consider reducing that by 1/3 to 1/2.

Blacksmith,3ckume,Vaarna,3,Wed Jul 8 18:19:36 2015 UTC,"Both processes cost more for greater complexity, but with casting that increase is relatively minor compared to forging.  Casting is also overall generally cheaper than forging.  Steel forgings can have greater strength than steel castings, though this is not absolutely always the case.  Cast iron can't be forged at all.  Casting steel is difficult and more expensive than cast iron.  Castings can be near-identical, while hand forgings can be unique."
Blacksmith,3ckume,ColinDavies,4,Wed Jul 8 18:30:57 2015 UTC,"If we're talking about steel, it takes a lot more heat to melt than it does to get it to forging temperature; forging is therefore the more energy-efficient method. Forging also generally produces a piece with higher tensile strength as the grains are aligned.  If we're talking about metals in general, it's still often a question of economy - what is the cheapest and easiest way to produce the object you want?"
Blacksmith,3ckume,arnorath,2,Wed Jul 8 23:05:05 2015 UTC,"You can cast intricate designs. Carve a detailed wax model, make a mould from it, and cast it. Some things you just can't do (practically) by forging. As saren42 says, forged things are typically stronger, whereas cast iron is generally brittle. You'd want forged tools over cast any day."
Blacksmith,3ckume,jewsdidukraine,2,Wed Jul 8 18:32:56 2015 UTC,"If you forge something, it will typically with stronger, from the metal being worked. When you cast something, it tends to be brittle, and break easily."
Blacksmith,3ckume,saren42,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:25:32 2015 UTC,"greetings from /r/metalcasting!  Casting is handy when you need multiple matching copies of a piece.  Castings cannot be for anything that needs sharpened edges, or (specifically regarding cast-iron) anything that needs to be particularly hard (hammers).  Cast aluminum is lighter than forged iron, it is less strong.  Cast-steel is really difficult to do; it is a pretty expensive setup.  Cast-iron is only fairly difficult to do.  Forging is easy to do, but it is labor intensive.  Forging gives certain benefits in the realm of grain-strength compared to cast-steel.  These benefits tend to be complicated to measure, and if you are worrying about this stuff, you are probably consulting an industrial forgings-engineer.  In brass/bronze, forging work-hardens a piece; though historically it was a common practice to start by casting a piece, and then finish up by forging it.  Once work-hardened, they can hold an edge; just not quite as well as tool-steels.  These days, copper alloys like this are rarely used when a hard tool is needed because steel is cheaper and has a number of superior properties.  Basically anything that can be cast, can be made with a forge and a file, it just might take a particularly unusual file and some patience."

Blacksmith,3cjvjq,Irontoes,6,Wed Jul 8 14:04:51 2015 UTC,"Generally, you can forge brass cold. Just go in the opposite order that makes sense for iron, oddly enough.  Heat it to red. Quench it real quick. Work it until it starts to get stiff. Repeat.  It's a bit counter intuitive but the heat-quench sequence anneals it prior to cold working. Brass will form a crystalline structure differently than iron. That's one of the reasons you can get away with casting bronze and still have it be decently strong.   Once the piece begins to work harden and get brittle, go through another heat-quench cycle and it'll soften up again.   You can also try casting bronze rivets if you are so inclined. It's easier than forging them. It's pretty easy to make a small sand or clay cast for rivet blanks."

Blacksmith,3chujp,davemccullough,9,Wed Jul 8 04:01:22 2015 UTC,You'll often see terms like 'blood groove' or 'blood-letting notch' used to describe the groove that runs down the center of many sword and knife blades.  It's actually called a fuller and has nothing to do with releasing blood;  it's simply a way to make a sword lighter while maintaining its strength.

A fuller is often used to lighten theblade, much the way that the shape of an I-beam allows a given amount of strength to be achieved with less material. When combined with proper distal tapers, heat treatment and blade tempering, a fullered blade can be 20% to 35% lighter than a non-fullered blade without any sacrifice of strength or blade integrity."

Then, do the same thing starting with modern high carbon steel, and show how the folded version is actually a little weaker.  This should all be done in a gas forge, so they can point a spectrometer at the metal.  Show that it never gets hotter than its melting point.

Snow does a pretty bad job of moving heat. It would melt around the sword, but you would likely get a faster quench from boiling hot water. I don't feel like looking up the exact heat transfer rate of snow, but it's low. Think about ice water versus just ice. Then consider that snow would have an even smaller contact surface than ice."

When you heat snow, just the area you apply the heat melts, then the rest just stays where it was, only taking a little heat away. With water, the heat can permeate the whole mass of water quickly.   Regarding liquid nitrogen quenching, I've done this and it just ends up very brittle. You can quench from room temp and get brittle steel. There are other cryogenic treatments that actually help, but it's not in the scope of blacksmithing. You can take that question to /r/askengineers."

Secondly, that brake drum forge is an excellent design.  Simple, and efficient.  Did you design that yourself?"
Blacksmith,3cfmun,Faelwolf,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:36:42 2015 UTC,Cheers. Yeah I was going to go with a tripod but figured this would be easier and just as stable. The reason I was gonna router out the log a bit is cause the underneath (which used to be the top) is really uneven. I had planned to leave about 5cm sticking out the top so I can fuller on the edges still. Thinking of putting a hardy hole in it too.  Edit: Thanks for the welding comment too. This was my first ever attempt at welding so theyre not pretty by any means but I was happy with the strength.
Blacksmith,3cfmun,Faelwolf,7,Wed Jul 8 05:33:04 2015 UTC,"Oops, hit enter before I was ready.  Bit of advice, since you obviously have some welding skill, I suggest welding a spike to the bottom of the steel you wish to use for an anvil, and setting it into a post that way.  You will find that having the full sides and top edge of that steel block very handy for forging."

Add a baffle to your air pump to control the air flow, you shouldn't have too many sparks leaping out.

Good call with the tray though, I was thinking about a frame I could make separately with an adjustable rest for work and I might try to implement a hood as well for wind/spark protection."

You could still try hardware stores for 4lb engineering hammers. With a tray you can use firewood and coal as you go, pick at the wood to get coals and pull them into the firepot. Works best when you stack wood ontop log cabin style. Does radiate lots of extra heat though. Or make your own charcoal."

If you want to buy, which is not a bad idea, any forge on one of the major blacksmithing supply company web sites will likely serve you well.  If you are not planning on becomming a farrier, stay away from forges that have huge openings.  Farrier's forges have really large openings so they can fit horseshoes in easily.  If you are planning on doing ornamental work,  you will want something with smaller openings. This will save fuel.  Shop around.  Pricing on forges vary quite a bit, even for the same exact forge."

Blacksmith,3cheig,beammeupscotty2,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:24:01 2015 UTC,My own experience at building forges has led me to purchase my burners on my last two forges rather than build them myself.

Blacksmith,3cheig,raisinbread,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:56:40 2015 UTC,"I know I'm a tad late to the conversation, buuuutttt, I would really really suggest trying to make a forge or throwing something together that can burn charcoal so you can get a feel for everything,  buying materials to make a forge is a lot cheaper than buying a whole forge.  At least that's the way I've found it when it comes to coal/charcoal forges.  I have a decent setup and I only spent maybe $80 on the setup but I'm just guestimating because I had some of the materials already.  If you really want to buy a forge I would suggest any of the ones from a larger black smithing site.  I don't have any experience with gas forges other than seeing a few in a fairer supply shop.  Good luck on your hunt for a forge."
Blacksmith,3cheig,AeroFace,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:46:28 2015 UTC,"At this point I have the money but less time (and no welding tools or experience), so I think a purchase will work well for me.

Blacksmith,3cddqm,Whittigo,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:05:16 2015 UTC,That's the one.  I didn't want to give it away.  Yeah.  Dude was using a cast iron pan with a hole in the bottom and a hair dryer as a blower.  My first real forge was a brake drum forge and I used a hair dryer as a blower.  I just finished my propane forge.  He did have a real anvil though.  I'm still using railroad track.
Blacksmith,3ce6g5,bearmanpig4,2,Tue Jul 7 05:27:10 2015 UTC,"So I'm trying to get my first propane forge up and running and having problems. So far I think most of my issiues are with my propane tank which is just a regular 5 gallon tank. Every time I try to start it up I can barely crack the valve open and the overflow safety kicks in. I can run it if I very slowly crack the valve open and then use my regulator to adjust, but I dont get the full flow since the valve is just barely open. Any advise on this? I followed this to make the burner. http://www.instructables.com/id/how-to-build-a-gas-forge-burner/"
Blacksmith,3ce6g5,vandraks,4,Tue Jul 7 05:32:22 2015 UTC,You need a regulator in between the tank and the burner. Check around online I think I got mine for 45$ or so with adjustments from 0-60 psi.
Blacksmith,3ce6g5,hellionzzz,1 point,Tue Jul 7 13:17:12 2015 UTC,"I've got a regulator on it at the moment, no gauge but goes from 1-30. I'll look into getting one like you recommend."
Blacksmith,3ce6g5,hellionzzz,2,Tue Jul 7 15:25:56 2015 UTC,"Like /vandraks said, get a propane regulator, preferably with a gauge. Here's an example.  http://www.ebay.com/itm/Propane-REGULATOR-GAUGE-and-FITTINGS-/331596795254?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&hash=item4d34b58d76  I use something similar but I found it cheaper than that link. It's just an example. You can also use an multi-fuel regulator if it's type T. If you try to use a Type R regulator (acetylene), you may eventually run into problems with the seal/diaphragm since it can be deteriorated by propane.  If you are frugal, you can just use a needle valve somewhere in the propane line to do fine adjustments. Just make sure it is rated for LPG or NG. The regulator you have will still has the safety on it and you will be able to fine tune it. I prefer having a gauge so I can maximize efficiency but a needle valve will do just fine if you are on a budget (That's what I used before I upgraded)  Also make sure you have another exhaust in the back of the forge body. That will allow some of the heat to escape somewhere other than where you are grabbing stuff. The way my forge is set up, there is a 4"" x 6"" slot cut level with the deck inside the forge. It serves as additional exhaust and as a place a long workpiece can fit through. I cover it up with a fire brick when not in use.  Once you get a proper regulator, you can dial down on that flame and save you arm hair.  You may want to look into a small blower or oxygen feed to tune your flame once you put in the regulator. I used a 4 way connector instead of a step down connector like your blower has. One side has blower/natural aspiration, one side is fuel input, one side is oxygen input (I use it for higher temp stuff since I'm high altitude), and the last side goes to the nozzle. Works great for me."
Blacksmith,3ce6g5,killer122,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:50:33 2015 UTC,"Awesome info, I'll be buying one similar to that when I get some time to search around! Any suggestions for a blower? Or maybe a site I can get specifics from? Still very new to propane so I'm basically clueless with this stuff."
Blacksmith,3ce6g5,killer122,2,Tue Jul 7 15:32:03 2015 UTC,"I use a dual 40mm server fan as my blower. Got a bunch of them from servers I bought at a government auction. It mounted to my 4 way fitting without much of a gap. It doesn't put out a lot of air (around 25 cfm max) but it is very small. I hooked up a small rheostat to it in order to control air flow. It runs off of 12VDC and it isn't too terribly loud. I made a tiny power adapter to run it but you can just use any 12VDC supply. When the blower isn't running, I still get enough air for a low flame to be neutral.  It's more complex than it should be but I like to tinker and over-engineer things. It works like a champ though."
Blacksmith,3ce6g5,killer122,2,Tue Jul 7 16:10:01 2015 UTC,"Not bad, but the burner is lacking 2 critical pieces, First you should have a ball valve at the end of the intake, threaded into the end of the copper in between the forge and the tank, by keeping the ball valve closed you can open the gas all the way at the tank and tune the pressure to the burner with the regulator, then open the ball valve to light the forge, you are essentially trying to open the tank to the atmosphere and it needs a certain amount of back pressure to keep it from tripping. Secondly the burner itself is good enough, however, there is no airflow control, i would look into installing some kind of air flow adjustment on the top of the burner air intake. Also if the tank is stopping you are using way too much gas or it is a shitty tank. I usually run about 12 - 15 off the regulator when i just want to forge with the tank wide open, then bump it up a bit if i want to get near welding heat, but that is for my forge, tune it to your forge, if you can get to a good bright yellow by leaving a piece in for a good soak, its fine."
Blacksmith,3ce6g5,dirty_d2,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:04:52 2015 UTC,"That makes a lot of sense, I'll run out and pick up a ball valve asap, as for airflow control what would you recommend? I live at about 3000ft if that if that affects anything."
Blacksmith,3ce6g5,dirty_d2,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:36:45 2015 UTC,"whoah, that could actually be a huge issue, you might consider trying a forced air suplement, basically attach piping to the top burner thread, use an L fitting and put on a cheap variable speed blower to supplement the air flow, a cheap hair dryer would work with a low/high setting, worth a shot and if it doesnt work you cold just remove it. beyond that the only other way would be to use a larger bell to intake more oxygen but that would mean building a new burner.  good luck."

Blacksmith,3ccyx1,madwilliamflint,5,Mon Jul 6 23:09:12 2015 UTC,Coal and charcoal will definitely get hot in fact ... if you run the air too long .... it'll burn through your brake drum.
Blacksmith,3ccyx1,ironnomi,3,Mon Jul 6 23:41:16 2015 UTC,During my blacksmith class at the local craft school I melted the edge of the cold chisel I was in the process of heat treating because I wasn't paying attention. Nothing like a crap load of grinding to make you learn a lesson.

Blacksmith,3ccyx1,ironnomi,2,Tue Jul 7 02:37:00 2015 UTC,I was getting cocky and kept the blower on while I was working on one piece.  Easiest way to fix that is to just never do that again.  Give the forge a break between heats.

Blacksmith,3ccyx1,Vanhugenstein,2,Tue Jul 7 07:14:02 2015 UTC,It seems neat.  I've got a compressor because it's what I had and I wanted to be up and running as soon as possible.  It's pretty easy.  Once everything is hooked up and running I just have a single lever that takes it from off to full or anywhere in between.    But I'm guessing a manual crank would be fun :)

Blacksmith,3ccyx1,Fargraven,2,Tue Jul 7 12:01:07 2015 UTC,"Agreed, I just keep my rheostat where I can reach and fine tune as necessary.  I scored a bunch of free anthracite so airflow is crucial.  No problems.  Ya do need to pay attention no matter what."
Blacksmith,3ccyx1,dontVoteBarack2016,1 point,Tue Jul 7 12:00:26 2015 UTC,Have you switched from using charcoal to anthracite?  How does it behave differently?    I get the impression (and this is from my extensive youtube video watching research.  So.... $0.02) that it burns hotter and slower.
Blacksmith,3ccyx1,Vanhugenstein,1 point,Tue Jul 7 13:19:03 2015 UTC,I only use the charcoal to get the anthracite coke going...then green anthracite.  Not my first choice but it is free for the moment.
Blacksmith,3ccyx1,dontVoteBarack2016,3,Tue Jul 7 15:48:28 2015 UTC,"extreme.  luddite   You know, I get that a lot. Let's examine an electric blower:  Wired. Requires an outlet within a couple hundred feet. Power outages can prevent work. Motor can burn up or fail in any number of ways. Forgetting to shut off can lead to devastating consequences.  Now, consider the following statements that can be made about any of my blowers:  It is cordless and can go anywhere. It is powered by outage-free, renewable, clean energy. It shuts itself off when I am at the anvil, conserving fuel and allowing me to work multiple irons without risk of burning.  Sounds pretty high-tech to me.  Cut the cord, man, before people start calling you Bernie."
Blacksmith,3ccyx1,account_information,2,Tue Jul 7 02:47:08 2015 UTC,"I think both have pros and cons. I agree with everything you said about electric blowers, but they can also be easier to find and easier to use.   While hand crank blowers can be expensive and a pain to find/make, they don't require electricity and conserve fuel between heatings."
Blacksmith,3ccyx1,williamtwild,1 point,Tue Jul 7 03:21:59 2015 UTC,expensive and a pain to find   Hm. I've come across many more crank blowers than I have electric ones. Although I guess if you count blowers not originally made for smithing porpoises then it would be cheaper and easier to find.
Blacksmith,3ccyx1,i_cant_fap_to_that,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:32:53 2015 UTC,Blower can maintain a more constant temp without occupying your hands as well.
Blacksmith,3ccyx1,williamtwild,1 point,Tue Jul 7 12:04:39 2015 UTC,"Well, a hand. But I'm not sure an electric blower is much more constant than I can be with a crank blower. And a bellows, once the top lung is inflated, is very constant.  It's funny, when I use a rheostat-controlled blower, I always stand in front of the fire watching it and feeling lost because there's nothing to do."

Blacksmith,3cc4rq,Scuzzbag,2,Mon Jul 6 21:00:03 2015 UTC,"Use regular pliers (not vice grips) and grip them tightly. Vice grips are made to hold two pieces together while you weld them. Under strain they are meant to pop open before they damage whatever they are holding.    A pair of tongs is a good first project. Even if they turn out kinda crappy they will work better than pliers. Pliers, or vice grips, are not long enough to let you move your pieces around in your forge without burning your hands, tongs are. They are also long enough to avoid smashing your fingers when you miss the piece and long enough to give you some leverage in holding your piece down when you hammer it. I'd like to be able to say that I never use pliers as tongs, but I do sometimes. It is almost always because I didn't think something through and now I need to manipulate a piece before it cools and they are within reach."
Blacksmith,3cc4rq,denaissance,2,Mon Jul 6 20:10:17 2015 UTC,"do not use pliers. do not use vise grips. do not use channel locks. do not use anything except for the appropriate size and shape tong for the dimention of piece you are working on.  Until you are able to make your own tongs, work with 3' long pieces of metal. they allow you to hold the metal directly with your hand at the cold end."
Blacksmith,3cc4rq,verdatum,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:13:37 2015 UTC,"I had an issue like this as well, went out to a hardware store and bought some relatively long handle large pliars. Not sure if this is the best thing to do but it works well enough for rail spikes."
Blacksmith,3cc4rq,Artymaster,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:00:37 2015 UTC,"for my small metal working i have been using clamping vice grips, i adjust them so that i have to REALLY squeeze to make em clamp and it generally holds the piece well enough (i have been working nails) however they suck at bracing against forces perpendicular to the direction of the clamp, but for those parallel it does a serviceable job.  if i had anything better i would be using those instead (because the clamps suck...they get the job done but i still drop metal) i'm thinking of taking a pair of needlenose and flatening out the head and forming it around my nail to serve as a pair of tongs (though i kinda don't wanna destroy my only needlenose pliers) but if you have a spare pair you might try that, check out some videos on youtube on people making blacksmith tongs and adjust for the smaller size (here is a video of one of my favourite youtube blacksmiths making a pair of tongs from some long needle nose pliers that could be easily adapted to smaller needle nose)"
Blacksmith,3cc4rq,tuseroni,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:05:44 2015 UTC,"I use this style sometimes, i have carpel tunnel and they are light and easy to use and the jaws pivot and get a good surface area of grip on different shapes."

Blacksmith,3cbsnt,44ead,11,Mon Jul 6 18:08:59 2015 UTC,"When you're starting out, the best anvil is the biggest chunk of metal you can get for free."
Blacksmith,3cbsnt,Engvar,5,Mon Jul 6 20:21:57 2015 UTC,"You want something that has good rebound.  Meaning when you place metal on it and strike it from the top, the ""anvil"" strikes from the bottom.  Given that, you are looking for 3 things:  Hardness, mass, size.  Hardness - if it's soft, it absorbs the blow, instead of reflecting it.  Mass - more mass under the striking hammer, the better the rebound.  Size - surface area to hit.  If you are beating on 2"" square stock and have 1.5"" of usable ""anvil"" space to hit, it will be difficult (but not impossible) to shape.  Given all that, for starting out, if you find a piece of railroad track 3 - 4' long, place it vertically on a mount (like this... http://cdn.instructables.com/F5W/51RD/F2DSDRG9/F5W51RDF2DSDRG9.LARGE.jpg ), you can do a lot.  That vertical track puts a lot of mass under the strike, is relatively hard, and is usually cheap.  If you get a longer piece, mounting to a base and bury it to get it to the right height.  I've heard a lot about using old engine blocks as well.  There are a few good places to strike that have a lot of mass beneath, and the different surfaces and curves can be used as swage blocks."
Blacksmith,3cbsnt,noware6,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:51:42 2015 UTC,"Why is the ""anvil"" usually mounted to a piece of wood? Is this a cheap way to raise the height or is it for the sound deadening properties? Or something else?   (sorry for the dumb question, newbie lurker and keen to understand)"
Blacksmith,3cbsnt,Pafkay,3,Tue Jul 7 10:08:57 2015 UTC,"Traditionally, stumps have been used because they would be partially buried 3' in the ground. This provides an extremely sturdy base to rest the anvil on so that it does not bounce around the floor.  However, in a more modern sense, one could use any manner of materials ranging from more steel to pressure treated wood. The key point is to rest the anvil on something that won't break easily. Stumps are practically free and readily available. And though they may not always be buried, they still provide a sturdy platform for your anvil."

Blacksmith,3cbsnt,ColinDavies,2,Mon Jul 6 19:15:45 2015 UTC,"I use a 110 pound granite slab, its nowhere near ideal but it gets the job done. Really any heavy thing that can take a beating will do if you're just starting out."

We used to take wood shavings wrap them in newspaper balled up, tie with string and dip in wax for fire starters for boyscouts. I've been doing this and it works extremely well.   Another option 2 is if you can get ceiling tiles, cut them into like 1.5 inch squares, dip them in the wax(let it soak in) and they make great starters as well.   Or option 3 if you're also into woodworking like I am, take egg cartons, fill them with saw dust, pack it in, pour melted wax over the top, cut into individual balls, you have half egg shaped starters that work well."

IIRC, they cost less than $3 (at least here near Tulsa, OK.) Unfortunately, they don't seem to be available for online purchase, for pretty obvious reasons. Each ""match"" is about the length of a dollar bill. I break them up into 5 or 6 pieces and light the section with a lighter, using one each time I fire up my forge. They take about 10 seconds or so to get burning good while you're holding them with a pair of tongs, then you lay one right in the middle of your firepot.  Give it a few seconds then start scooting coke in next to it (if you run coal or coke.) At this point I usually go do something else (getting tongs and punches gathered, going to plug in the extension cord I forgot to plug in when I was in the garage 2 minutes before, etc.)  When I get back, I flip on the switch for my blower and its just a matter of a few minutes until you have a fireball ready to heat steel. I like to keep a bucket of soaked coal near me to pile on once my fire is going, which helps with a few things:  --Seems to mitigate the burning fly ash. I'm probably not choking down my air supply enough, but this is convenient enough. --The coal cokes up a little slower. --The pile of wet coal on top of the fireball seems to help insulate the fireball itself.  Don't get me wrong, I have no issue with starting a fire with newspaper, phonebook pages, and dry twigs, but this is definitely convenient enough to justify the cost. For me at least.  Thanks for reading, gentlemen. Have a nice week.  Edit: Please ignore the abhorrent state of cleanliness my shop is in. I'm not the most organized person in the world, but I would have at least picked up the tongs, tong blanks, and other crap from around my anvil before I took the picture if I'd thought about it."

Is there any historic village near where you live--a place where they try to preserve old buildings, etc?  Chances are there's a club that meets in the smithy if there is.  EDIT:  Prospect Hill Forge is fine, but if you can find a group like I'm describing, you can learn the same things for a bare fraction of the cost.

Blacksmith,3c616x,tulsavw,15,Sun Jul 5 04:02:52 2015 UTC,"I'm currently the moderator of both /v/bladesmith and /v/blacksmith. I intend to try and keep the community the same as the ones over here (perhaps with a bit more mod interaction though). I'd love to hear your input and would be happy for y'all to join us in fostering this new community.  In case anyone is curious, I'm an apprentice bladesmith so I do have a motivation for building up the community. I'm also an engineer, so I have a decent amount of programming capability to handle the subs."
Blacksmith,3c616x,BLKavarice,2,Sun Jul 5 14:35:25 2015 UTC,Sweet! I look forward to seeing that community bud into something that will hopefully be as pleasant as this one!
Blacksmith,3c616x,Fargraven,13,Mon Jul 6 04:47:14 2015 UTC,"/r/blacksmith and /r/bladesmith are the only things keeping me on reddit right now (and the fact that Voat's servers have been down a lot), but that's really good news. I'll check it out more once their servers are more stable."
Blacksmith,3c616x,staklininkas,3,Sun Jul 5 12:10:50 2015 UTC,Voat seems to have a problem with people DDOSing their servers.
Blacksmith,3c616x,JasonHanson,2,Sun Jul 5 06:41:45 2015 UTC,"I just don't think they can handle the traffic and are saying it's a DDoS. They seem pretty amateurish to be honest, the person who started the site just graduated from high school."
Blacksmith,3c616x,akuta,6,Sun Jul 5 08:01:58 2015 UTC,"Nah. The admins are very clear about what has occurred. During the last movement of people, there was indeed a DDoS (which is why they moved over to a cloudflare-type setup). When you go from 20k users to over 200k overnight, it definitely surprises you (or in this case potentially much more in light of the blackout). Top this off with the attacks they've had to deal with over the last couple of months (people contacting their host as well as paypal and lying about illegal content to get them shut down, then coming back to reddit and openly admitting that they did it), they've had a lot of growing pains."
Blacksmith,3c616x,JasonHanson,-1,Sun Jul 5 18:45:41 2015 UTC,"DDoS is a distributed denial of service, where they are being maliciously targeted, usually by some type of botnet and infected computers. A mass exodus of reddit users is not a DDoS, it's a heavy traffic increase.  I can't blame them for the initial couple weeks of outages when the FPH ban happened since they had no idea to prepare, but it's been about a month now and they still don't have their server situation figured out. AWS allows for easy scaling and would be an easy change. CloudFlare helps but only to a certain point. It doesn't seem like they have very competent server administrators, and probably if they even have any, it's through their hosting company or an outsourced one.  The owner of the site seems to be young too, as when the FPH banned happened he was talking about working on a tablet from his parents house and that he was graduating from high school.  I agree that reddit is going in the wrong direction and a competent alternative would be great, but I just don't think voat is it."
Blacksmith,3c616x,Vehudur,2,Sun Jul 5 19:12:05 2015 UTC,"You don't understand. There was an exodus, AND someone launched a DDoS on top of it.  There have been a LOT of attacks against Voat, and DDoS attacks have been only one method of attack that's been used."
Blacksmith,3c616x,akuta,2,Sun Jul 5 19:57:58 2015 UTC,"I understand what a DDoS is... And I used the term correctly. Someone (or group of someones) implemented a DDoS when the first large exodus occurred. They then came back to reddit and openly admitted to doing it. This, in conjunction with the large number of new hits on the site, caused the initial downtime.  They had their server issues resolved after a few days (as well as moving to a new host and dropping paypal due to the other nefarious behaviors of the attackers). People seem to fail to grasp that while, yes, it's easy to upgrade your hosting package to accommodate upwards of millions of hits per day (like reddit has had to do) that it doesn't happen overnight unless the host has their VMs configured to do so and the funds are there to do it. Yes, AWS permits scaling... But only if you have the funds to accommodate such a scale. Two months ago the site was receiving a few thousand hits per day... In the last two months that's scaled exponentially. They can only do so much when only receiving funds through donation, which is why they've been talking with a VC.  Atko is young, yes, but he's in college. He was working from a tablet from his parents because he was on vacation when the issue happened. His age is a non-issue. To suggest that he cannot hope to handle the issue simply because he's in college is to be intellectually dishonest. The IT field is full of people who are of his age that perform just fine.  You may not think voat is it. And it's possible that in time it will become apparent that it isn't; however, to judge such a young site based off of growing pains and direct attacks is silly. Hell, reddit still has issues with serving all of its hits on a weekly basis."
Blacksmith,3c616x,JasonHanson,-3,Sun Jul 5 20:39:41 2015 UTC,"You seem pretty invested into this so I'm not really going to start a debate with someone who's biased on the subject matter.  All I know is that he's a recent high school graduate who's struggling to manage his website, and when you're young you have little experience, resources, and knowledge on running a business. I ran a web hosting company for 7 years, so you could say I know a thing or two about hosting and server infrastructure. His site is being mis-managed and shouldn't have the issues it's having after all this time. It might be popular and have it's 15 minutes of fame for the next few months, but I would be willing to bet on it that the site is going to go nowhere. Reddit has it's ups and downs but the community gets in an uproar for a few weeks and then goes back to normal. Take a look at the Alexa traffic, hasn't dipped since any of the incidents. If reddit is going to die in favor of a site like Voat, then stop going on it and giving it traffic. What are you still doing here?"
Blacksmith,3c616x,gammaburn,7,Sun Jul 5 22:26:58 2015 UTC,"I think it will take more than a bit of petty politics to sink reddit.   More and more I find that I really only care about the niche subreddits like this one. That being said, if the majority of users leave, the little subreddits will inevitably wither."
Blacksmith,3c616x,Grreatt,2,Sun Jul 5 08:46:07 2015 UTC,Petty politics though? They fired the most important person to one of Reddit's most unique features without any sort of plan to ease the transition. Bad management will most certainly sink a ship.
Blacksmith,3c616x,TheyCallMeBrewKid,6,Sun Jul 5 19:02:37 2015 UTC,"Victoria could have committed a 'fired on the spot' infraction.   Until you know the full story, reserve your judgement."
Blacksmith,3c616x,Grreatt,1 point,Sun Jul 5 21:02:20 2015 UTC,"Regardless of her situation, it is clear that admins left many mods high and dry with relation to pending ama's. The overwhelming lack of communication and support during the event led many mods to shutdown their subs in protest.  Although I am very curious as to why she was fired, as I'm sure many are, the problem here was bad communication and poor planning."
Blacksmith,3c616x,TheyCallMeBrewKid,1 point,Mon Jul 6 03:26:53 2015 UTC,"If someone commits a fire-on-the-spot infraction, there is no time to communicate or plan.

Blacksmith,3c616x,ColinDavies,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:07:45 2015 UTC,"Hopefully you're right. Little bad-for-business incidents like this, though, don't necessarily amount to petty if Reddit's regular userbase feels alienated by it. Digg isn't exactly an apples for apples example, but it was the giant at the time that fell over less dramatic incidents. I'm not going to doubt the power of the metaphorical hivemind."
Blacksmith,3c616x,ColinDavies,2,Mon Jul 6 04:50:28 2015 UTC,"Of course the second I link to it, Voat goes back down. May God have mercy on their servers. Anyways, I would love to see some of the fun personalities that we saw commenting around here on there, too. It should be pretty interesting to see how this Voat thing pans out."
Blacksmith,3c616x,Sir_Beard_Man,3,Sun Jul 5 04:03:31 2015 UTC,"Well, there's egg on my face.  I checked out voat during the last exodus, made an account and created /v/blacksmith as a placeholder.  There was already another smithing verse or two, so I figured nobody would care about it...  Looks like it has been taken over!  I am just gathering this from the Google search results.  Anyway, I wish the new management the best of luck.  I guess I will just participate as a regular user there if it takes off eventually."
Blacksmith,3c616x,BLKavarice,1 point,Sun Jul 5 04:54:30 2015 UTC,I wonder how you registered v/blacksmith then it now is run by someone else? They must've done a full reset on the site or something. I wonder how that blacksmithing community will do.
Blacksmith,3c616x,dontVoteBarack2016,4,Sun Jul 5 05:02:13 2015 UTC,"You know, I could just be completely misremembering.  I definitely tried to register it, but it was during a sketchy high traffic time.  Looking at the cached version, it seems /v/blacksmith was created by one of its current mods.  Either way, I will go check it out when it comes back online.  Edit: From the cached version of voat's FAQ, ""We have multiple automated mechanisms in place which purge unused subverses."" So there we have it.  So, /u/BLKavarice and /u/Sir_Beard_Man, how are you guys liking it over there?"
Blacksmith,3c616x,akuta,3,Sun Jul 5 05:10:09 2015 UTC,"It's pretty good, actually. The formatting is nice, and when the servers aren't crashing, it's enjoyable."
Blacksmith,3c616x,Maxfjord,2,Sun Jul 5 07:12:38 2015 UTC,I think Voat has a lot of potential. I can't wait for the community to start growing so we can get some more enthusiasts helping with the sub.
Blacksmith,3c616x,madwilliamflint,1 point,Sun Jul 5 14:38:43 2015 UTC,I registered it once a few months ago but didn't check back and it got purged. You probably aren't misremembering anything.
Blacksmith,3c616x,inbeforethend,4,Mon Jul 6 03:27:15 2015 UTC,"The way the site works: If you aren't actively putting something into your subverse, it becomes available for appropriation. It prevents stagnation of subs and people ""placeholding"" subs to the detriment of the community.  Reddit actually has a similar feature in that someone can request ownership of a sub if the sub owner is not active."
Blacksmith,3c81d0,imthatguy1911,2,Sun Jul 5 19:40:20 2015 UTC,I've seen chisels and punches made out of them. I think they would be medium to high carbon.
Blacksmith,3c81d0,hawkeye5xy9,2,Sun Jul 5 22:38:52 2015 UTC,Some are really mild steel.  I've bent enough of them.  They dent easily too.  Make Fire pokers and the like maybe?
Blacksmith,3c81d0,Vanhugenstein,1 point,Sun Jul 5 23:30:15 2015 UTC,I went the other way: I forged rebar in to a pry bar! Album  All I can think is most store pry and crow bars would be mild steel. Usable certainly but you will be paying more than you should for steel.
Blacksmith,3c81d0,Brutorans,1 point,Sun Jul 5 23:33:11 2015 UTC,"Modern crow bars are very much like mild steel, and if they are hardened at all, it's case hardening which will be lost through the forging process anyway."
Blacksmith,3c81d0,indyvet,1 point,Mon Jul 6 01:49:19 2015 UTC,"Probably unlike most people who have commented here, I have actually forged crowbar and I can assure you, a modern crow bar is NOT made of mild steel, it is probably at least .05% carbon and if you don't treat it like carbon steel you will end up breaking it. It is entirely suitable for tooling."
Blacksmith,3c81d0,beammeupscotty2,1 point,Mon Jul 6 02:06:54 2015 UTC,Not sure if you made a typo or what. .05% carbon is ridiculously low.

Blacksmith,3c81d0,beammeupscotty2,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:59:47 2015 UTC,"That makes more sense, although 0.5% would be considered mild steel."
Blacksmith,3c81d0,superdirt,2,Tue Jul 7 00:23:09 2015 UTC,"The percentage is just a guess on my part, but in my world, O1 is high carbon steel at about .95%, 4140 is medium carbon steel with up to about .48% carbon and 1018 at about .2% is low carbon steel.  Wikipedia classifies medium carbon as:  Medium carbon steel: approximately 0.29% to 0.54% carbon content with 0.60 to 1.65% manganese content"

Used my arc welder to fill in the holes as I was so frustrated, but then I fucked that up so there's loads of slag included in the welds! The rivet is a nail I cut down with a grinder! Cheating that was.  But they are mine. I made them. No one helped. But I will make more, and they will be better! Even more awesome: I'm going to use my first shit ones to makes some better crap ones. Then those I will use when in makes some kind of bad ones, eventually I will make some passable tongs. Until then, I have my crap ones, and I'm proper chuffed with them :)  Album of the stills I took  EDIT:  Forgot the moral: just keep working at stuff, you will improve."

Blacksmith,3c5zf0,dontVoteBarack2016,2,Sun Jul 5 08:21:46 2015 UTC,"that's what I was wondering, it looks like it might be a top heavy.

Blacksmith,3c3gnb,FreezeScreen,3,Sat Jul 4 11:51:09 2015 UTC,How do you do that twist? Do you lower the previous section in the vice and twist the upper part? Is that grove done with a fullering tool?
Blacksmith,3c3gnb,Fargraven,3,Sat Jul 4 13:20:31 2015 UTC,"To make the twist I tightened it into a vice, heated a small section wth a torch and twisted it about 90 degrees round clockwise. I then let it cool down and heated it again about 1 cm further up from the first twist and twisted it 90 degrees anti-clockwise. That's what gave that wide twist sections between the tighter coils. Next I just moved about another cm up and heated it again and twisted it 90 degrees clockwise.   I didn't use a fullering tool for the groove, it just formed into the metal as it was twisted round each way in the vice.  This video shows a technique similar to the one I used, if my explanation wasn't very helpful but I did mine upright in a vice."

Blacksmith,3c3bmc,JohnDitt,3,Sat Jul 4 12:07:17 2015 UTC,"The hot chisel should have an edge on its sides, as taught by the late Francis Whitaker 30 years ago. 1) In the public Facebook page of Quick & Dirty Tool Co, see the June 5th posting of hand chisel splitting as a step in tong making. 2) Odd as it seems, a former landlord blacksmith used a small vertical band saw to 'hot-saw' quickly and effectively the split."

The shaft is drawn down from the ⅝"" at the handle to the ½"" at the working end."
Blacksmith,3c3bmc,ColinDavies,2,Sat Jul 4 16:56:11 2015 UTC,"You can do that as long as there's enough metal for both points.  The only thing that should make it weak is if it were too thin.  Even if you didn't pay attention to this it would probably end up about as strong as a lot of forge welded ones, since this is a weld that many people do not bother scarfing very well.  If you look closely you can often see that the points are just as thin at the weld as if they had been split instead."

Blacksmith,3c3bmc,ColinDavies,3,Sat Jul 4 13:02:01 2015 UTC,"16mm round is a little thick for making a poker IMO unless you are planning on drawing the whole thing out.  It ends up being rather heavy to wield.  I was teaching someone how to make a poker last weekend and I had him use 3/8"" square stock.  In a 28"" - 30"" poker it will end up light enough to wield but still be hefty enough for heavy use.  In that size stock one needs to upset the end to about 1/2"" x 1/2"" for about two inches of length before you split it and draw the two split pieces out a bit."

Blacksmith,3c1oy4,icecoldcelt,4,Sat Jul 4 00:26:37 2015 UTC,I had some help. I had an old cold chisel that was held with tongs to punch the hole. It got stuck. Often.
Blacksmith,3c1oy4,ColinDavies,2,Sat Jul 4 00:36:28 2015 UTC,"When it gets stuck, it's usually because the edge is bending because it got too hot. In order to keep it from sticking, you need to take it out after every 2-3 blows at an orange heat and after every 1-2 blows at yellow. It really just depends on how much heat your work is transferring to your chisel in a certain amount of time. When you take it out, cool it in water (put a cup on your stump so you don't lose much time). You may want to gauge how hot it is each time to get an estimate of how long you can leave it in the work by looking at the oxidation colors at the edge of the chisel. When you put it back in, you should turn the chisel 180 degrees every time to keep it going straight. This accounts for any difference in sharpening angle on the bevels of your chisel."
Blacksmith,3c1oy4,ColinDavies,2,Sat Jul 4 18:33:00 2015 UTC,This makes so much sense. Thanks!
Blacksmith,3c1oy4,staklininkas,1 point,Sat Jul 4 20:27:49 2015 UTC,"That turning 180 tip is hugely important, especially when your tools are a bit asymmetric and your technique is humanly imperfect.  Not only does the hole go straight, the tool stays straight.  Any slight buckling gets corrected instead of exaggerated.  If you are using a handled punch then you can turn the work or move to the opposite side of the anvil."
Blacksmith,3c1oy4,Vanhugenstein,4,Sun Jul 5 00:37:57 2015 UTC,"After you've tried it with the sharp point a few times, make another or grind this one to have a flat nose with crisp edges, close to the size of hole you want to end up with.  I think you will be pleasantly surprised."

Blacksmith,3c1oy4,tulsavw,3,Sat Jul 4 11:57:07 2015 UTC,"I find it silly to have punches with handles because they take up so much extra room. It's much better to make all of them so that they fit snuggly into a pair of tongs, at least in my opinion."
Blacksmith,3c1oy4,icecoldcelt,3,Sat Jul 4 03:07:17 2015 UTC,easier to quickly grab and use though.
Blacksmith,3c1oy4,tulsavw,1 point,Sat Jul 4 10:49:12 2015 UTC,Check out these: handled punches. That image is taken from Glen Stollmeyer's http://www.gstongs.com/ but I've done a similar thing (if not as expertly) by skipping punching the punch and instead fullering a groove on the edge of the anvil then wrapping round rod into the groove. Works well and puts a quick handle on it.
Blacksmith,3c1oy4,ColinDavies,3,Sat Jul 4 15:57:24 2015 UTC,"Cool! Handled punches are so much easier to hit confidently. I would consider hammering a drift through your eye and spreading the cheeks (lol) up and down, to give me surface area for your handle to contact in the punch."
Blacksmith,3c1oy4,tulsavw,3,Sat Jul 4 15:00:43 2015 UTC,"If you thin the cheeks too much, they will bow out when you are striking the back. You want to be sure there's enough material around that eye to keep that from happening."
Blacksmith,3c1oy4,Fargraven,1 point,Sat Jul 4 18:39:23 2015 UTC,"True -- I guess the most important first step would be to make sure you have plenty of material to account for that. I would guess a person will want to have at least a 1/4"" thick cheek after moving that steel up and down with a drift through the eye. It's actually kind of fun to do. Starting off with a slitting chisel would go a long way for this, but a slot punch narrow enough would do well."
Blacksmith,3c1oy4,grauenwolf,2,Sat Jul 4 20:52:31 2015 UTC,I... Oh god.  I just have to point out that (lol) is kind of the visual equivalent of onomatopoeia here.

Blacksmith,3c3abr,fender28,3,Sat Jul 4 10:05:38 2015 UTC,"Speaking very generally, hot tools can get away with a more slender build and sharper bevels.  There is a tricky grey area though, because many people don't bother heat treating hot tools while cold tools are always heat treated.  This means hot tools are not as strong as they could potentially be, and therefore not quite as skinny.  We also tend to overbuild everything rather than pushing the metal right to its limits.  One thing that does lead to differences is that cold tools rarely cut very deep so it doesn't matter if they have a huge body backing up the working edge/face.  Hot tools are often required to go very deep into hot metal, and that's easier when they have a more gradual taper."
Blacksmith,3c3abr,ColinDavies,4,Sat Jul 4 12:49:10 2015 UTC,"Just to elaborate and clarify what Colin has said, probably the main reason hot cutters are not heat treated is because they will often get hot enough that any heat treatment that was done will be destroyed.  This is also the reason that hand held hot cutting tools are often made of specific steels, things like H-13, as in the case of this slitting chisel:  http://blacksmithsupply.com/catalog.aspx?storename=blacksmith_supply&DeptID=181551&ItemID=11390619&detail=1  These sorts of steels tend to keep their hardness at higher temperatures that more conventional carbon steels. Compare that chisel to the geometry of this cold chisel:  http://www.amazon.com/Stanley-16-289-4-Inch-8-Inch-Chisel/dp/B000NNIJBQ/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid=1436021890&sr=8-4&keywords=cold+chisel  which is much heavier in form.  Also, as is the case with the aforementioned slitting chisel, the geometry of hot cutting tools is typically much slimmer than cold cutting tools.  Some reasons for this are because hot tools are often driven all the way through a piece of stock and a slimmer tool has less friction and distorts the original shape of the stock less than a thicker tool.  Slimmer shapes are also used because hot tools are used on hot work which is much softer than cold work.  You need a much beefier tool for cold cutting because much greater strength is required to cut cold stock.  Cold cutters can be made from any medium  to medium high carbon steel.    Either type of cutter can be hand held or have a wooden or steel handle.  Hand held hot cutters like slitting chisels will often be much longer than a cold chisel simply to keep your hand further away from the hot stock you are slitting or cutting.  Neither cutter is better than the other in general but each is also much better at  cutting it's intended material than the other.  Hope that makes sense."

Yeah, don't burn it off with a torch, sand it with something that has a vacuum collection attachment while you are masked up with a full organic respirator. Or zip strip, use good rubber gloves, and lots of plastic to contain it. Do it outside as a best bet. Also, drink plenty of OJ, and vegetables high in zinc to make sure any that slips by doesn't stay with you for 15 years.   Lead exposure is kind of overplayed, but this is coming from someone who worked next to solder ovens for a few too many years, had co-workers with obvious skin color changes from lead exposure, and knows most of em won't live too many years past retirement.

Blacksmith,3c25se,KalinRozthan,3,Sat Jul 4 01:47:10 2015 UTC,"If you want to build a forge, model it on a commercially available forge, not something you, with no actual experience, dream up."
Blacksmith,3c25se,beammeupscotty2,2,Sat Jul 4 03:49:24 2015 UTC,"Commercially available I don't think is necessary, but it should be based off something that works. Think about a brake drum forge or various brick forges people successfully make that aren't commercial."
Blacksmith,3c25se,somanayr,1 point,Sat Jul 4 05:55:24 2015 UTC,"this is good advice. I would take it, OP."
Blacksmith,3c25se,allsortsofmeow,1 point,Sat Jul 4 14:29:35 2015 UTC,"So, a few thoughts:  0) A similar forge is the Tim Lively wash tub forge. I did a forge based off of that one as my first and it worked great  1) you're going to want to have this whole system raised. It's convenient not to bend over every time you want to heat steel  2) concrete will not work for a firepot. It does not stand up to the heat, but more importantly, it explodes in some cases. You can use Adobe instead: equal parts clay and sand, plus a little wood ash, then mix with water until it holds together but isn't runny. The clay should be high temperature clay (there are 2 main temperature grades). You can use El cheapo kitty litter as a substitute for clay since it is pure bentonite clay.  3) A sink catch might be galvanized, which would be dangerous. In any case, it would fall apart quickly.  4) I see no mention of a tuyere, but a Lively style tuyere doesn't require any mesh to keep coals in the firepot.  5) Use a hair dryer for your air supply. They're very effective.  6) keep in mind the actual air blast zone shouldn't be more than 4-6"" long. Any more and you're wasting coal. The firepot shouldn't be more than 1-2' on a side. Often forges have larger fuel storage areas, but these are not burning fuels.   How much research have you done on forges? You should look at other designs and work based off someone else's design for your first forge. The last thing you want is for yours to not work. I would suggest looking into brake drum forges and Lively Washtub forges. Also read up on galvanized steel."
Blacksmith,3c25se,somanayr,0,Sat Jul 4 05:53:08 2015 UTC,"First off yes i know a forge will need to be raised, i assumed that would be obvious. I do know bending over is a bad thing especially so often. I was mostly looking for advice on the actual forge, not the legs.   My forge build is modeled off this one. http://imgur.com/4lHkaa4 Mine is just rectangular and it does look like concrete that it is filled with and around where the Coal is. That is why i thought of it. And why i asked because i didnt think it would be all that great.   I know what galvanized is and i know the sink strainer i have in my sink is not galvanized because i have heated it up on fire to turn some stuck on food i could not get off, to ash. Galvanized metal will let off a toxic fume that can kill you and i wont be using any galvanized steel.   As for the Tuyere, i have done research on forges, but i have not seen much mention of it, and is one reason i asked here becuase i figured people would let me know about things i would need.   @u/beammeupscotty2 When i speak of coal i was thinking of getting something like this. http://www.centaurforge.com/Bagged-Smithing-Coal-50lbs-includes-shipping-within-the-Continental-US/productinfo/COAL1WS/ One of my friends uses this and i figured i could to. So no i do mean coal. And im sorry if that last sentence seems a bit ""I know what im doing"" i did not mean it to. Just saying yeah i mean coal not charcoal or anything. Just coal."
Blacksmith,3c25se,beammeupscotty2,1 point,Sat Jul 4 15:22:06 2015 UTC,"Now that you have clarified the fuel you intend to use let me point out that the forge you have provided an image for has been burning charcoal, not coal and that it is impossible to see any details of it's construction from the image.  There is no reason that i can see, unless you have additional information, to believe that this forge operates very well with charcoal, let alone coal.  For a home made coal forge the most popular thing to repurpose as a fire pot is a brake drum.  You can alter the dimensions of the drum to make for a more usable size and shape with refractory cement.  For a cheap alternative you could try a 50/50 mix of conventional mortar and fire clay.  I have used this in my own coal forge to reshape the firepot and it seems to hold up pretty well and has not exploded, though I have only used it in thicknesses up to about an inch.    I just went through 10 pages of youtube videos on how to make a brake drum forge and did not find a single one that was 100% correct.  The biggest mistake made was to not locate the firepot in the middle of a flat surface. On those few that did sink the firepot into a table none of them bothered to set it flush with the surface of the table, which is a pretty important detail.  That is why I recommend ignoring youtube altogether and encourage forge builders to model their forges on commercial coal forges or commercial propane forges, not on a forge built by some yahoo on youtube who may or may not have any idea what they are doing."
Blacksmith,3c25se,beammeupscotty2,-1,Sat Jul 4 18:00:55 2015 UTC,"You appear to have a vast selection of advice for this person which seems rather odd considering he has not indicated exactly what fuel he intends to use. He does reference using a sink strainer for ""keeping the coal there while letting the ash through"", but with a rank beginner like the OP, it is difficult to tell if he is using the word ""coal"" to describe the fuel he is burning or ""coal"" in a more generic sense like the ""coals"" in a burning wood fire or charcoal fire or even, as is often the case here with inexperienced wannabe smiths, referring to charcoal as ""coal"".     From what I can tell, the Lively washtub forge is a charcoal forge.  I see from looking at it that it will operate very poorly with coal.    A sink catch, as you call it and strainer as the OP calls it, is not galvanized.  Typically, it would be chrome plated and may very well be chrome plated brass.  Whether brass or steel it is of much too light a gauge to use to keep fuel out of the tuyere.  The problem with this statement:  ""You should look at other designs and work based off someone else's design for your first forge. The last thing you want is for yours to not work,""   is that a neophyte smith has no way to determine whether a design offered by someone on, for instance, Youtube, is actually a valid, functional design. I am getting rather sick of people coming on this sub asking how to get their propane torch, soup can forge to work, after following a very popular youtube video.  That is why my suggestion to try to copy a commercial forge design is so important for a new smith.   Considering the fact that you apparently have never before posted to this subreddit, I have to question your qualifications for offering any advice at all to a new smith. It would be very nice if you established some bona fides by posting some of your own work and perhaps your own forge before you start advising others here."
Blacksmith,3c25se,somanayr,1 point,Sat Jul 4 14:39:44 2015 UTC,"he has not indicated exactly what fuel he intends to use   He indicated solid fuel, so that's a start. Charcoal and coal both use very similar setups, the main differences I'm aware of being the strength and speed of air supply and depth of the firepot   He does reference using a sink strainer   The concern I mentioned was that it may fall apart. (probably would). A sink strainer is an expensive disposable, IMO   That is why my suggestion to try to copy a commercial forge design is so important for a new smith   Your point is fair and well taken. I understand your concern, and I agree. I also think copying a commercial forge may not be the best way to go: they don't come with any instructions on how to build them. Perhaps the best way to do this is to do substantial research on how forges work and model off a commercial model, understanding how a forge itself works. Simply trying to recreate a commercial model might lead to confusion (e.g. how to improvise a firepot or getting an air supply that isn't a pricey radial blower). I had a lot of success re-modelling the Tim Lively washtub forge, but unfortunately it seems his website has gone down (edit: https://web.archive.org/web/20140829131114/http://www.timlively.com/washtubforge.htm). The forge was a formerly commercial forge he decided to release instructions for free on how to build. I made a few substitutions and was successful.   Considering the fact that you apparently have never before posted to this subreddit, I have to question your qualifications for offering any advice at all to a new smith. It would be very nice if you established some bona fides by posting some of your own work and perhaps your own forge before you start advising others here.   Makes sense.

Blacksmith,3c123s,Fargraven,4,Sat Jul 4 00:43:41 2015 UTC,"You didn't say anything about knives, so I'll assume you are asking about general blacksmithing.  In that case you are looking for the cheapest hot rolled mild steel the supplier has, mostly square and round bar under 3/4"".  It could be something like 1018 or A36.  If you're making your own tools get some medium carbon steel like 1045, or some low alloy medium carbon steel.  You don't need anything fancy.  New mild steel is very cheap if you buy it locally and don't ask for too many cuts.  It is a lot easier to learn on something with a simple cross section like square or round, rather than something that is hard to hang onto or has big raised surface features (rail spikes and rebar, I'm looking at you)."
Blacksmith,3c123s,ColinDavies,5,Sat Jul 4 00:11:38 2015 UTC,"I feel like that supplier charges too much for cuts and for shipping.   If cheap is a requirement, it would be cheaper to buy mild steel from a local steel supplier, and usually you can cut it yourself to save money on the cutting fees.  That's what I recommend, buy a 20' round or square rod of various sizes of 1018.  You should know what sizes you need because they should be specified in the book or tutorial you've been reading. (You're reading that stuff right?)    For practicing you want mild steel.  Both 1018 and a36 fall under that umbrella, however the a36 cert does not guarantee composition, and often times it is as unpredictable (forgeability and heat treating) as rebar.  Using a steel with consistent behavior will take out a dynamic component from your forging practices, which would speed up the learning process."

Blacksmith,3bzlrh,yangxiaodong,4,Mon Jul 6 19:34:55 2015 UTC,"Are you sure they're galvanized?  Galvanizing stainless steel doesn't make a lot of sense.  If they're not galvanized then you just need to polish them up and heat them until they turn that colour.  It's a thin surface layer that can scratch off, so you might want to clear coat it if these will get handled and knocked around a lot.  You could alternatively use a brash brush on them when hot and that will actually leave some brass attached to the surface.  I'm not certain but this may be more durable.  Either way should look pretty good."
Blacksmith,3bzlrh,ColinDavies,2,Fri Jul 3 13:04:29 2015 UTC,I know they are galvanized but you are probably right.
Blacksmith,3bzlrh,ColinDavies,3,Fri Jul 3 13:11:46 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I misread and thought you were saying each of them was galvanized and stainless.  You can remove the zinc from the galvanized ones using acid (clr-type product, vinegar, etc.)."

As long as you're not forging galvy stock for too long, along with the possession of half decent ventilation and a basic level of common sense, you'll be fine. It takes a while to develop metal fume fever. And even then, it takes a lot to actually be deadly. It's similar to a bad cold for a couple days. Just be cautious.

Blacksmith,3bvzv3,Socratov,1 point,Fri Jul 3 03:30:06 2015 UTC,"As shown in the album, I got my hands on a wild cherry trunk to use as a stand for my 'anvil'. The size of the trunk and the anvil are pretty damn close, in places overlapping each other. I was thinking I could forge some brackets to keep the metal firmly fixed to the trunk but i'm not sure what impact this could have on the trunk. Currently nothing is fixed in place, I just threw it all together to get an idea of what I might do, so any suggestions are welcome on how to make this a more stable and safe construction.   The other area I wanted to ask advice on was handles. Recently had a very useful hatchet snap off during use and I want to make a handle for it myself. Grabbed a chunk of Sycamore branch from my wood pile and started carving down the end just to get an idea of how to do it and what to expect. Now I know sycamore is not recommended for tool handles and branches are really not great for handles in general, but I learnt allot by trying. Does anyone have a guide or resource they could point me to that I could use for further learning? Specifically what kind of woods to use and what part of a tree. I gather splitting a trunk in to boards then using a cross section with linear grain is important, but beyond that i'm not so sure."
Blacksmith,3bvzv3,Farty_McFartFart,4,Fri Jul 3 07:51:42 2015 UTC,"For the handle, you can buy a replacement from House Handle or Beaver-Tooth Handles.   If you are set on making your own, you'll need to get a chunk of straight grained hickory from a lumber yard (ideal handle material) or here are some instructions on using a log to make a handle. Whichever you use, you want the grain to line up with the blade point as much as possible.   Any straight grained, hardwood should work for a handle, hickory and ironwood are typically seen as the best handle material since they are so tough and straight. Stay away from softer woods like poplar and pine as they'll snap with one chop. Take note of how the head attaches in the two instruction sites I linked, you need the handle to extend past the axe head by a minimum of 1/2"". This allows you to fit a wedge in easier and then saw the handle down flush. Also, /r/Axecraft has some pointers too.   Good luck."
Blacksmith,3bvzv3,verdatum,4,Thu Jul 2 16:45:33 2015 UTC,"If a traditional woodworker saw you measuring your axe handle with calipers, he'd get quite a laugh.  You don't measure when making an axe handle, you basically just hack it down until it fits.  You do not want to use green wood when making a tool handle.  You split out a chunk from a log and let it season for a few years.  You pencil on a rough shape, hack it out rough with a broad-hatchet, then go to the shave-horse and sculpt the details a bit more with a drawknife, get it pretty much smooth with a spoke shave.  Some of the details, you finish off with a fine-rasp.  You leave the top of the handle extra-long with a steady taper.  You saw a line down the center.    If you want to do it the lazy modern way, you cut out the cross-section on a band saw, and finish the the thing on a fairly coarse benchtop belt-sander.  Just make sure that the grain runs all the way along the entire length of the handle.  If the grain runs out on a diagonal, the handle will likely eventually fail on you.  You fit the axehead, hammer in a wedge, and saw the excess of both the wedge and the handle flush to the top of the head with a crosscut saw.  If you live in america, you make your handles from hickory.  If you're in Europe, you use elm, while the Americans laugh at you for not having hickory trees on your continent.  To learn more on the traditional method of making an axehandle, I'm quite fond of this resource, I'm sorry that it's non-free.  There might be other good stuff online, but this is what I'm most familiar with.  All that said, you probably don't want to wait, or collect all these tools; so yeah, just buy a replacement handle.  I've even seen some perfectly decent ones in the big-box home improvement stores.  As for the trunk; it's eventually gonna check; a wedge-shaped split will form down the length as it dries.  Perfectly normal, no big deal.  Plenty of methods could work just fine to fasten the steel in place. Just make sure to pick something that fixes it nice and tight.  If the steel bounces up away from the log, you are wasting energy with each hammer stroke."
Blacksmith,3bvzv3,Vanhugenstein,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:12:56 2015 UTC,"I used the calipers so people could gauge the size from the pictures. When I actually did it I eyeballed it all the way and adjusted with constant fittings. Time consuming but really enjoyable, also made me sharpen my chisels (not the ideal tool to use, but its what I have). The whole experience has made me pretty keen to forge a crook knife having seen them used in video tutorials. Looks like i'm on the lookout for some elm boards.  I was thinking forging some large, U shape brackets, one end with a broad, flat nib, the other with a forged point so I can hammer it in to place. Also thought about an L shape design which I can screw in to place. Will document which one I choose."

Blacksmith,3bwb2g,yangxiaodong,6,Thu Jul 2 18:02:21 2015 UTC,"From my understanding, between /r/blacksmith and /r/bladesmith, you have to normalize it, to shorten the elongated grain structure from forging. Do it after you're done forging but before you heat treat.   To do this, heat the blade until it's non-magnetic then let it air cool. Then heat it until it's just below non-magnetic and air cool again. Then just below that and air cool again. You can keep going, heating just below what you previously did, but at least three times is recommended."
Blacksmith,3bwb2g,Fargraven,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:20:57 2015 UTC,"Alright, so normalizing is the same thing as a basic heat treat, but slow air cooling, right?  and does it need to be just below?"
Blacksmith,3bwb2g,FJ1906,3,Thu Jul 2 18:23:30 2015 UTC,"Normalizing is a part of heat treating. It is grain refinement. After the 3 step normalizing heat to your critical temperature for the steel and then quench. After that temper to reduce stress and brittleness which will strengthen the blade. When forging the blade don't quench in water or oil to cool at any point before you quench for hardness, its not necessary. If you're taking a break or want to handle the blade let it air cool."
Blacksmith,3bwb2g,FJ1906,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:05:10 2015 UTC,"Okay then!  Also, for when im working with a grinder or something where im generating heat that i dont want, what should i use to cool it?"
Blacksmith,3bwb2g,anviltodrum,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:12:19 2015 UTC,"When grinding before heat treat you can dunk it in water to cool it down so you can handle it, don't really have to worry much about getting it too hot.  After heat treat, you have to be careful when grinding to not get it too hot to change color or it will ruin the temper. Play it safe and cool it down after each pass."
Blacksmith,3bwb2g,Vanhugenstein,5,Thu Jul 2 20:34:07 2015 UTC,Good rule of thumb is to grind bare handed. If too hot to hold then grinding too hot.

Blacksmith,3bwb2g,Vanhugenstein,2,Thu Jul 2 21:36:45 2015 UTC,"You are mistaken.  It is dependent on the alloy of steel.  Some alloys quench better in water, some in oil, some in air."

Blacksmith,3bwb2g,tulsavw,1 point,Sun Jul 5 04:12:20 2015 UTC,"It's not really that much of a mystery. The heat treat numbers for many alloys are very similar. Generally speaking, you can use the same procedure for most of them. This is especially true for pieces with thin cross-sections.  When in doubt, heat a sample to non-magnetic, quench in oil, then check the hardness with a file. If the file skates across without leaving a mark, it's oil-hardening. If the file digs in, it's water-hardening."
Blacksmith,3bwb2g,Vanhugenstein,1 point,Fri Jul 3 07:11:09 2015 UTC,"Quenching speed and medium to quench depends on type of alloys. While some steels (ordinary one) require 10% NaOH or salt water to quench them for a mm , others can use ordinary water, oil .  Most problematic are those steels that are air-quenchable: they quench just by leaving them on open air. And combined with flat program, they are hard to work with.

Blacksmith,3bwb2g,Vanhugenstein,1 point,Fri Jul 3 01:16:01 2015 UTC,"Of course I can't find the source I read to back this up, but let me politely recommend spending a few extra dollars to buy virgin oil, on the off-chance that there is a chance that the heavy metals in the oil are as dangerous as I've read. I quenched in used motor oil for a quite a while, but its not worth the risk to not just buy some new oil."
Blacksmith,3bwb2g,thesirenlady,0,Sun Jul 5 04:14:29 2015 UTC,"Motor oil is toxic, use veg. oil which is not as toxic.  Some metals can be used with ""superquench"" which is a mixture of salt water and soap."
Blacksmith,3bwb2g,anviltodrum,1 point,Fri Jul 3 00:55:46 2015 UTC,"If by ""unfuck"" you mean ""how do I return steel to the properties it had when I first purchased it?"" then, yes, normalization is the correct answer.  It's a good thing to do if you intend to grind the blade with a file or do other cold-working.  If you mean ""after forging, how do I prepare the blade for heat-treatment"", then you usually do not need to normalize as part of the heat treating process.  If you heat your hardenable steel up to non-magnetic, and keep it at that temperature long enough for the heat to have soaked through to be fairly even throughout, you can then quench-harden the blade, followed by tempering.  Certain alloys have exceptions where normalizing has a beneficial effect on heat treatment. The best thing to do is to pull up the documentation on the alloy you are working with.  It gives you in-depth instructions on proper heat-treatment."

Blacksmith,3bwjh9,cadika_orade,3,Thu Jul 2 19:04:15 2015 UTC,"If you are unsatisfied with your clay practice, you may need to get some harder clay.  You should be using a ""Hard"" grade of plasteline clay.  If it is still not hard enough, you can put it in the refrigerator, or potentially heating it up in a crock-pot and mixing in some microcrystaline wax until homogenous.  Dumb-bells are usually made of cast-iron, not steel.  In that case, it has the same problems as bench-vices.  On hammers, I think the Harbor Freight cross-peen hammer is perfectly fine and gloriously inexpensive.

Blacksmith,3bvwo4,beammeupscotty2,2,Sun Jul 5 02:08:49 2015 UTC,"The flair on the burner end has something to do with pressure differentials and keeping the combustion at or beyond the flare rather than inside it.  It is pretty important.  Forging a hatchet as a first project is probably not a good idea.  Too much mass to move by hand, especially if you do not have a real anvil.  It is likely as well that your forge will not reach welding temperatures which will make welding in a carbon steel core impossible.    As a beginner I would recommend you not try to work with anything larger than 1/2"" x 1/2"".  3/8"" is even better.  As far as your burner design goes, the drawback to that style is that there is no way to adjust the distance between the pipe and the orifice.  Designs where the orifice can be adjusted in and out are far superior for optimizing the burn, but your design if properly executed may well work out fine."

Are the DIY type I've seen that are made of a Tee fitting where the gas tube is going straight in from the end the type you're talking about,  and does adjusting it closer and farther from the pipe adjust how much air gets pulled in by the jet? I was going to try mounting a plate that rotates on that other screw to adjust the airflow, but I guess that would only work if I have too much air how it is now."

Blacksmith,3btq5v,Joeymartel,2,Thu Jul 2 01:57:24 2015 UTC,Colin is right that it is pretty difficult to see what's going on in your picture but what I think I can safely say is that you have insufficient gas flow for some reason.  This could be because you have not supplied enough pressure from the tank.  It could also be that you do not have a large enough orifice. You really need to provide better pics and a more thorough explanation of what you did before anyone can offer comprehensive advice on how to fix the problem.
Blacksmith,3btq5v,beammeupscotty2,1 point,Thu Jul 2 02:39:58 2015 UTC,"We can see the flame, but the burner itself is fuzzy and dark in that photo.  Maybe post another of it in good light without flame so people can see its construction."
Blacksmith,3btq5v,ColinDavies,1 point,Thu Jul 2 02:21:20 2015 UTC,"It looks like you are using a reil-style burner. If that's the case, then you need to increase the pressure of your propane. When the fuel gets pushed through, it will entrain more air from the opening in the back.  If this doesn't fix your problem or the flame never approaches a neutral burn, the hole you drilled for the fuel may be too big. Ideally, the hole should be 1/32"" to 1/16"" depending on the size of pipe you are using. If you already drilled a bigger hole, it's possible to fix it. Just melt a glob of lead or solder over the existing hole and then use a pin to make a new hole.  Your nozzle flare may be a little too much, as well. The ideal flare angle is around 12 degrees from what I've read from trusted nozzle designers. Personally, I don't use a nozzle flare. I welded a sink grate to the end of my nozzle pipe to provide backpressure and mixing.  It looks like you have the basic design correct, you just need to properly tune the thing. Fixing the fuel port size should be your first step."
Blacksmith,3btq5v,hellionzzz,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:58:44 2015 UTC,"I can't tell from the photo what you're using for regulating your propane flow, but if its a BBQ or weed burner regulator you are NEVER going to get enough flow or pressure out of it to actually move air down the pipe towards the burner flare, thus you're going to get a rich, slow burning mixture that will be completely insufficient for getting steel hot enough to form or forge weld.  On my forge I'm using a red Fisher regulator I got off ebay for <$35 shipped.  This will flow more than enough fuel for my 2-burner forge."

Blacksmith,3bq2w5,rhannum01,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:50:46 2015 UTC,"Thanks! As for the bevels, I practised alot and ended up getting pretty decent at forging them in.  I use a light Japanese style hammer I built and hold it on the rear horn on my anvil and hammer them in.    Edit.  I use a belt sander after forging them to smooth it out.  If I don't forge them,  lots of metal is wasted on railroad spike knives.  I've gotten pretty fast,  and it goes quicker for me to forge the bevels,  then sand them.  I'm only at the belt grinder for maby 5 minutes. The bevels are pretty much there after forging.  The sander cleans it up.  Way faster then just grinding them in from a flat blade blank. Also saves some money,  don't have to buy as many sanding belts."
Blacksmith,3bq2w5,rhannum01,1 point,Thu Jul 2 02:41:44 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply! I do a similar thing with my bevels, forge them most of the way, then use the grinder for cleanup. What belt grinder do you use? I have been trying to decide on what one to get for a while now, my current bench wheel grinder sucks for knife finishing due to the fact that it isn't a flat surface and messes up the forged bevels."
Blacksmith,3bq2w5,Nilta,1 point,Thu Jul 2 05:14:18 2015 UTC,"Honestly I just use a mastercraft 4x36 belt sander.  It costs like 80 bucks I think,  little over a hundred maby?  Most people don't reccomend them because it's harder to use then the 2"" belts,  but I got used to it."

Blacksmith,3bq8bb,TheLastoftheTimeLord,2,Wed Jul 1 07:12:01 2015 UTC,"It seems like a lot of beginners, you're trying to make a mashup of solid fuel and gas designs.  You are probably thinking this will give you the best of both worlds.  The thing is, the shell of a gas forge is not a bonus feature - it's an obstruction, the price you pay for the benefits of using gas.  What you have in this design is a forge that lacks the flexibility of solid fuel and also lacks the convenience of gas.  There is certainly room for innovation in forge design, but it is more a matter of refinement than complete reinvention.  The basic patterns of solid fuel forges have been developed over thousands of years and are used because they work.  Gas forges have only been used really heavily for a century or so, but their development has been accelerated by the advent of modern science.  Choose your fuel and base the forge design on commercial or antique forges that burn that fuel."
Blacksmith,3bq8bb,ColinDavies,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:23:05 2015 UTC,"Thanks!  So for building something like this (www.stormthecastle.com/blacksmithing/images/smithing-a-knife.jpg) what sort of materials should I use? Additionally, can the metal get hot enough, even without a top?"
Blacksmith,3bq8bb,GarrinKnifeworks,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:10:12 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your input!  After reading that and the other comments here, I've decided to scrap this and building something more classic like (www.stormthecastle.com/blacksmithing/images/smithing-a-knife.jpg) my question, however, is what do I build this out of?  Steel seems the obvious choice but (forgive me if this is a stupid question) isn't it supposed to get hot enough to make steel malleable?"
Blacksmith,3bq8bb,verdatum,4,Wed Jul 1 14:03:35 2015 UTC,"That would be fine. Commercial firepots are made of cast iron or welded steel; they don't get too hot on the outside because the hottest part of the fire is in the middle, surrounded by coals. The working hot spot in a forge is actually very small (maybe 4"" wide and a few inches deep.  I also recommend you take anything from stormthecastle with a grain of salt. The guy is an impressive maker of stuff but he's not an expert in any specific field. Try anvilfire or iforgeiron for info from people who have a little more concrete experience."
Blacksmith,3bq8bb,Brutorans,2,Wed Jul 1 17:15:53 2015 UTC,"Another reason why steel works despite holding something hot enough to make steel plastic is that the iron you put in the forge is surrounded by heat on all sides.  The steel of the fire-pot has heat on one side, but the other side is constantly being cooled by the ambient air.  Still, for the sake of stability and lifespan, it is good for your firepot to be a bit thick."
Blacksmith,3bq8bb,Brutorans,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:23:23 2015 UTC,"I forgot to mention, the firebricks are tested to about 1100°C (2000°F)"
Blacksmith,3bqi8i,Vanhugenstein,2,Wed Jul 1 09:35:35 2015 UTC,A few that people often mention on the sub are boiled linseed oil and bees wax. Personally I use old wax from the hive frames which are just to much effort to clarify. make sure the material is nice and warm to melt the wax over it otherwise you just get a thick smear which is unsightly and hard to polish.
Blacksmith,3bqi8i,Brutorans,1 point,Wed Jul 1 11:15:05 2015 UTC,"About boiled linseed oil...should I heat up the piece and apply room temp oil, or warm up the oil and apply it onto a room temp piece? I've seen and heard of both ways being done."

Blacksmith,3bncvm,grauenwolf,7,Wed Jul 1 01:33:30 2015 UTC,"Not really.  You can certainly forge copper, but you would usually do so at room temperature. (I think it is great for practicing my technique.)  It work hardens rather quickly so you will need to anneal it by heating to a dull red and then rapidly cooling it.   Speaking of which, copper bleeds heat. You can't heat just one part of it like steel, it's all or nothing. And as soon as you remove the torch it loses its glow."
Blacksmith,3bncvm,staklininkas,3,Tue Jun 30 17:17:33 2015 UTC,so just use the heat to anneal? and is it correct that you quench copper to anneal it? (was mentioned above)
Blacksmith,3bncvm,grauenwolf,4,Tue Jun 30 18:19:06 2015 UTC,"You don't even need to quench, I'd stay away from brass entirely.  Also, make sure you don't go above an orange heat while working bronze, otherwise it will melt on you."
Blacksmith,3bncvm,grauenwolf,3,Tue Jun 30 19:01:07 2015 UTC,"Pretty much yea. I just use a propane plumbers torch, but acetylene is better. (Don't bother with oxy-acetylene, you don't need it to be that hot.)"
Blacksmith,3bncvm,grauenwolf,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:36:46 2015 UTC,the propane plumbers torch should do fine. :)  oxy/propane is great because I can stuff the torch head into my gas forge to spot heat things with remarkable speed. Acetylene is expensive and the local suppliers have so many rental  rules to follow to get my deposit back. Like if I accidentally empty the bottle while trying to get one last heat.

Blacksmith,3bncvm,Qlinkenstein,4,Tue Jun 30 16:44:58 2015 UTC,"The trick with forging copper is to re-anneal it when it work hardens. Once it starts to be hard to pound on , heat it in the forge to a dull red, then quench it. Kind of the opposite of iron forging.  I think it has to do with how long it is past a certain heat that is required to soften, but getting it to dull red then quenching seems to work."

I've also found chunks of sheet rock, mortar, field stone, cinderblock, and rebar not to mention simply un-charred wood.  It's one thing to have some uncharred bits, but to have large chunks of football stadiums in your charcoal, well, that's another thing altogether."
Blacksmith,3bke6y,snutr,7,Mon Jun 29 23:24:11 2015 UTC,"Charcoal isn't coal. The white powder is gypsum, also known as drywall. It's added to better indicate when the charcoal is ""ready"" for use. Commercial charcoal briquettes are the diet soda of heat sources."
Blacksmith,3bke6y,heliox,1 point,Tue Jun 30 02:01:04 2015 UTC,Gypsum is also the main component of chalk
Blacksmith,3bke6y,yeahboiitsme,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:41:00 2015 UTC,"I also want to say you can still do everything up to welding with it.  I've TWICE go to some meetup in the middle of nowhere, forgotten my coal and had to find charcoal only to find out that the middle of nowhere apparently doesn't have lump charcoal.  It really sucks though, with a great bellows you have to basically keep pumping constantly to keep the heat up.  The second time I did this I actually ""exploded"" my great bellows because my flap snapped off and I sucked hot air in ... it was a sad day."
Blacksmith,3bke6y,ironnomi,9,Wed Jul 1 20:00:21 2015 UTC,"As I pointed out to you in your previous post, there are 3 Aubuchon Hardware Stores within ten miles of Framingham.  Why are  you not buying coal from one of them?  As far as charcoal goes there are essentially two types on the market, real charcoal which is made from partially burned wood and looks like chunks of wood, and briquettes which are made from coal dust and sawdust compressed into the typical briquette shape.  This  latter type of charcoal does not work well by all accounts.  If you want to burn charcoal you will need to buy the real stuff. Then you will have to spend a lot of time breaking it up into smaller chunks for it to be usable.    Why you would want to use charcoal when you could be using this:  http://www.hardwarestore.com/search.aspx?query=blacksmith%20coal   is a mystery to me."
Blacksmith,3bke6y,beammeupscotty2,3,Mon Jun 29 23:33:16 2015 UTC,"I had no idea that the OP was from Framingham.  But to be fair, not all Aubuchons have bituminous coal in stock at the store.    The OP should be going to Braintree to Williams.  They have quality coal there and the ""living historians"" at Old Sturbridge Village use it.    But to be a contrarian, hardwood charcoal is easier to get, burns just as hot and is cheaper (it literally grows on trees) and has less clinker (unless you buy Royal Oak) and is easier on the lungs (less sulfur).  The downside is that it burns faster so what you save in buying hardwood, you make up for by buying more of it as compared to blacksmith's coal."
Blacksmith,3bke6y,snutr,3,Tue Jun 30 00:36:32 2015 UTC,"You are certainly not being contrarian. Your opinion is just as good as mine.  I would like to say however, that if I could buy actual blacksmithing coal as cheap here in California as you guys can get it there in MA, I'd be all over it and have a ton in my backyard.  Here in California, the closest place in S.F. Bay Area, and it is not all that close, wants close to $32.00 for a 50 lb. bag after tax.  If I am willing to drive an hour and a half I can get it for $25.00 and that is what I did the last time but it eats up 4 hours to get it and plenty of gas.  At the price you can buy it for no other fuel could likely come close in BTU/hr. cost. I also pay $4.00 a gallon for propane.  I'd likely use more of it if it were cheaper than coal but it is pretty near twice the price in BTU/hr.   Coal is an all around better fuel because for many things the physical characteristics of a coal fire are more useful to a smith than propane, especially, I think, when forging smaller items.    Oh, and in terms of availability in a specific store I would imagine that a chain like this in a physically small State, would distribute out of a central warehouse and would bring in an order of coal to a specific chain for someone, likely at no shipping cost.   Just my thoughts on it...."
Blacksmith,3bke6y,beammeupscotty2,2,Tue Jun 30 03:15:30 2015 UTC,"Mainly because it's cheaper, and i've heard that coal tar or whatever is a carcinogen, and i dont want cancer."

Blacksmith,3bke6y,ironnomi,2,Tue Jun 30 05:41:01 2015 UTC,Wear a mask. Charcoal is going to throw a lot of nasty stuff into the air as well.

Even those who did by and large seem to die at 80+ if they don't have heart attacks.

Blacksmith,3bke6y,quarensintellectum,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:26:48 2015 UTC,I was about to say price but 12 dollars for 40 pounds throws that out the window.
Blacksmith,3bke6y,th30be,3,Tue Jun 30 00:14:08 2015 UTC,"Yes, that is pricey for coal.  However, coal is much more energy dense than charcoal and you will find you go through that bag much, much more slowly than a bag of charcoal.  When I was smithing I didn't smith every day, and did it more as a hobby, but 5 40 pound bags lasted me about 2 years."
Blacksmith,3bke6y,amplesamurai,2,Tue Jun 30 00:24:20 2015 UTC,Honestly I think it is really cheap atleast for myself. I was buying the bbq bags  two 12 lb for 13 dollars. It was quite expensive for  me. 40 lb will last me for years.
Blacksmith,3bke6y,ironnomi,1 point,Tue Jun 30 00:27:15 2015 UTC,> As I pointed out to you in your previous post
Blacksmith,3bke6y,ironnomi,1 point,Tue Jun 30 01:32:48 2015 UTC,"I just want to say that you can definitely use charcoal 100% of the time.  Coal is actually sort of ""new"" in the blacksmith world.  If you plan on using charcoal, you should have access to free wood and build a retort.  Otherwise buying coal by the T is the way to go, costs about $300-350 delivered to your local train depot.  You can sometime get deal for more coal and the price doesn't scale the way you think it would.  Wholesale coal at the moment is priced at $41/st ... aka dirt cheap.    Last I checked Pocahontas #3 (el primo coal) was $2400 for 26T delivered to North Texas. (From Penn.)"
Blacksmith,3bke6y,ironnomi,1 point,Tue Jun 30 05:19:15 2015 UTC,"Huh. I live in new england, so i've heard that this is where a lot of coal mining is."
Blacksmith,3bke6y,monkeymonkey12345678,1 point,Tue Jun 30 14:14:38 2015 UTC,"I'm saying that:   You can use charcoal, it will work fine as long as it's ""chunk"" charcoal If you go the charcoal route, you'll need to swiftly start making your own as it's ridiculously expensive Coal's cheap as shit, though the kind of coal we use is usually only of good quality from Penn. and Wym.   If you go the coal route, as soon as possible you'll want to buy MUCH more than you think because the price is really low once you start buying full train car loads.  All that said ... I'd personally say to use propane.  It's still fairly cheap, but it's sooo much easier to deal with.  (And yet I have 5.5T of coal in my coal box right now still to burn.)"

Blacksmith,3bh3yo,steelcap77,4,Mon Jun 29 11:12:18 2015 UTC,"Possibly a hub for an electric motor/gearbox drive. The hub transfers the rotational force from the drive sprocket to the shaft.

The soup can forge CAN be useful if all you want to forge are from 1/4 inch rods no more than about 3 1/2 inches long, but anything bigger than that (such as a railroad spike) and you need at least a brake drum forge."

Blacksmith,3begcv,WanderingAengus,2,Sun Jun 28 13:44:59 2015 UTC,"Pre heat the block with a torch to 300 deg. +/-.  Then weld using regular rod (not hardpan as some would think)  Hardpan or hardface rod is for abarsion resistance only and too brittle for impacts.  Using regular rod clean the surface, pre-heat, and weld pass after pass, clean well between passes, over fill so you can grind to shape, once filled you can quench with either water, or super quench to get a bit of hardness. Then grind to shape.  This is how anvils are properly repaired, should work well for a swage block."

As slow as it is, cutting ring by ring is the best solution for quality of ring as an end product.

Blacksmith,3bd88j,DyslexiaforCure,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:04:28 2015 UTC,"If you are willing to throw the extra money and don't need it functionally tight, I would say skip the cutting portion altogether and go for a large inner diameter titanium ring that is relatively thin, and buy it precut from somewhere online. It has no coating, is a decently strong material for the weight, especially if you go thin to keep costs reasonable, and looks good and shiny. That would be good for the shirt, and if you don't care about the strength, try aluminum.   For dice bags, I would say if you want it normally colored the above materials are fine, just with smaller ring sizes to keep things in well, but I would suggest you look into (if you haven't already) anodized aluminum, which comes in all sorts of crazy colors and could let you make color patterns while otherwise keeping the weave a simple European x-in-1 variant."
Blacksmith,3bd88j,PnuematicGecko,2,Sun Jul 19 19:14:31 2015 UTC,One of the best ways that I have found for cutting rings is using a pair of side cutters to score the wire then twist the ring off. This way the end of the ring is flat as opposed to the angled end that cutting with bolt cutters creates. The flat makes them easier to but then then if you are wanting to weld it gives a better contact area for a more even weld.   Source: hand makes maile for armour.

Blacksmith,3bbuf0,Jackel1994,8,Sat Jun 27 19:10:49 2015 UTC,"I don't know if the vise part is worth 40, but the ""anvil"" isn't."
Blacksmith,3bbuf0,ColinDavies,8,Sat Jun 27 19:03:11 2015 UTC,"That's just a vise -- not so much an anvil. Many modern bench vises have that flat spot on them, but it's just cast iron.  If you beat on it, it will eventually break.  The horn will serve the same purpose as one on an anvil, but it will also break if beat upon hard.  I would imagine that it is more for ""turning"" some small diameter rod over, using glancing blows, if it has any real use at all.  Don't let some similar features to an anvil on an inferior tool confuse you. At the same time, keep your eyes open for ~4"" hardened link pins from heavy equipment, large chunk of steel (even mild steel will be way better than this vise for forging), and other massive chunks of steel that will give you a few good edges, a flat surface (smooth or smoothable) and a LOT of mass directly under where you'll be forging.  Start saving some money so you can hop on a good deal when it comes around (regarding a real anvil.)"

Then fill it with sand.  Some people add clay to the sand to make it pack better.  You will need to aneal the metal (maybe more than once).  A little trial and error and you will have it.

However, with the edges chewed up as bad as they are I say skip it.  I seriously doubt the seller is going to consider an actually reasonable price on this if he's starting at $150.  It is only worth what you are willing to pay above local scrap price and no more."
Blacksmith,3bbn8s,ColinDavies,3,Sat Jun 27 19:30:00 2015 UTC,"I'd have to agree that the seller is pretty much nuts on his pricing.  That other anvil for $750.00 is absurd, regardless of how good of condition it is in.  You can buy a brand new anvil for that sort of money.  On the broken one, $50.00 is the max I would ever consider paying and I might not buy it at that price.  The fact that the bick is still intact is in it's favor but the broken heel means no hardy or pritchel hole which really limits the anvil's usefulness."
Blacksmith,3bbn8s,beammeupscotty2,2,Sat Jun 27 20:40:33 2015 UTC,"Agree...I'd go $50 on it, no more.  You can sorta fix those edges with a competent welder and the right welding rod (expensive), but it will never be a good edge, likely not worth fixing,   Use as a first anvil or put it on the ground as an upsetting block, flip on side as a large swage, etc..."

Blacksmith,3b96pm,TheRedditMachinist,3,Sat Jun 27 00:15:37 2015 UTC,"Wranglestar was fawning all over this forge, it looks easy enough to fabricate one yourself. Anyone ever tried using wood?   I wonder if a steeper angle would be better, maybe 60 instead of 45.   I wonder what would happen if it was more enclosed, like a woodburner stove. Those are very efficient. Maybe a 45 degree bottom but completely enclosed on top with an opening in front and a 6"" hole in the back for a chimney.   I hope this makes sense, I'm kinda drunk.  Sorry."
Blacksmith,3b96pm,verdatum,5,Sat Jun 27 00:30:32 2015 UTC,"Wranglerstar is a bit of a jack-of-all-trades tinkerer.  He does some forging, but he's mostly self-taught and just kinda has enough skills to do what he needs and that's all. I enjoy his vids, but I find I have to take some of his advise with a grain of salt.  Wood works, but it's a time waster. When you're burning wood, you're basically making charcoal on the fly.  And until your wood finishes cooking into charcoal, it burns cooler.  This means more work and time needed to reach proper forge heat.  It also produces a lot of that annoying smoke, so a proper smokestack becomes pretty critical.  If you have access to a lot of wood for next to nothing, get ahold of a lidded 55gallon steel drum and convert it into a charcoal retort. It's a fun project, and pretty easy if you don't overdesign it like I've been doing with mine."

Blacksmith,3b96pm,Paulocratic,3,Sun Jun 28 11:13:30 2015 UTC,I have done it without any issues but i have access to hardwoods in Australia that burn hotter than cypresses/pines etc. Even forged out of a log fire on a windy day without extra air.
Blacksmith,3b96pm,Mutant_Xj,2,Sat Jun 27 04:04:46 2015 UTC,I honestly don't like the wood fuel for this personally. If you have access to a lot of wood and no access to propane and coal then maybe this would work well for you.
Blacksmith,3b96pm,tulsavw,1 point,Sat Jun 27 01:36:06 2015 UTC,"If you have access to a lot of coal, making your own charcoal would be a much more practical route to get to forging temps.

No idea how I accidentally typed that."
Blacksmith,3b96pm,verdatum,2,Sat Jun 27 02:15:07 2015 UTC,"Might you have misspoken? coal is not needed to make charcoal.  I mean, I suppose you could use it, but any heat-source works."

Blacksmith,3b96pm,Vanhugenstein,1 point,Sat Jun 27 18:34:22 2015 UTC,While we were trying to find/build our forge my son built a pit forge and used wood with a shop vac for air.  It worked well enough to forge a rr spike bottle opener.
Blacksmith,3b96pm,CuriouserNCuirassier,1 point,Sun Jun 28 11:10:45 2015 UTC,My first couple years smithing were with a wood fired forge. The smith I was learning from got free pallets from the warehouse across the street and didnt want me wasting all of his coal/coke. I used it in just a plain unmodified coal forge set up with no ill effects other than CONSTANTLY feeding it more fuel and having to pay a bit more attention to fire layout to get good heat control.

Blacksmith,3b96r8,fishing_taco,7,Sat Jun 27 00:16:01 2015 UTC,"Both. I'm assuming the blacksmith hammer is a cross peen and they are intended to move metal a certain direction. The ball peen is intended to move metal out in all directions. They are both a good thing to have and if you're just getting into blacksmithing its good to try out different hammers and find what works for you.  Do not buy into the hammer fads that one style is superior to another. I jokingly tell my friends I'm an artist and my paintbrushes are hammers, thats because like paint brushes each hammer is designed to do a certain job."
Blacksmith,3b96r8,Mutant_Xj,5,Sat Jun 27 01:30:17 2015 UTC,"Is that the 40oz (2.5lb) blacksmith hammer?  I'd get that one.  The cross peen is more useful in blacksmithing than the ball peen.  You will still probably have to blunt it considerably to make it really useful.  If it's a 4lb hammer like I usually see in hardware stores then I would say go with the ball peen.  4lb is really too much for most people starting out.  In fact many people will never have a need to swing a one-handed hammer of that size.  /u/Mutant_Xj is right, though.  Both is better than either."
Blacksmith,3b96r8,ColinDavies,1 point,Sat Jun 27 01:21:55 2015 UTC,"If  you really intend to give blacksmithing a go, you are going to need both types of hammers but keep in mind that any new hammer that you can purchase for that sort of price is going to be made of less than stellar steel and will likely not be properly heat treated, assuming it has enough carbon to respond to heat treatment in the first place.  You are actually much better off with old flea market finds than with buying new at those sorts of low prices.  On a 2 lb. (or 1000 gram approx. equivalent) hammer, new, I would not consider anything that was not American or European made or that cost less than about $25.00 new.    My own advice is to start out with   hammers not more than 2 lbs.  1000 gram would also be o.k. but you may find there are things you want to do with even lighter hammers than that.  Heavier too, in time.  That's why flea markets are such good sources.  Lots of $2.00 and $3.00 hammer heads to be found there and paired with $2.00 handles from househandle. com, you can have a very nice selection of hammers for $50.00 or $60.00."

Many of these item are hardened steel and wreak havoc on the striking surface of a low quality hammer.  I use a cheap Harbor Freight 4 lb. drillers hammer for striking a lot of this tooling and in only a few months the head has already begun to mushroom.

Blacksmith,3b5ktc,misterschmoo,2,Fri Jun 26 03:59:16 2015 UTC,"Evaporust is expensive, just mix 9 parts water to 1 part molasses, stock feed molasses if you want to save even more money, only eats the rust leaves the metal alone, works like a dream, then when the rust is gone (may take a few weeks depending on how deep the rust is but can take as little as 2 days) buff them on a wire wheel and rub with 3-in-1 oil for some protection and they will look good as new.   Vinegar will eat the metal a bit, probably not an issue for metal this thick but that is the difference between the two methods."

Blacksmith,3b5ktc,carbonnanotube,1 point,Fri Jun 26 18:58:41 2015 UTC,"Interesting, I suppose you are reducing the rust using glucose.   You could speed that up by adding a chelator like EDTA or using something like HCl to take off the heavier rust first.   Also Evaporust seems to be just Citric acid with a chelator. You can source both of those through some local chemical suppliers fairly cheaply as well and speed things along."
Blacksmith,3b5ktc,misterschmoo,1 point,Sat Jun 27 12:40:54 2015 UTC,"My understanding is that the molasses and water is a chelation process by itself.  Yeah I'm not in much of a rush a rush, I also prefer if only the dead metal comes off, I prefer to keep as much good metal as possible.  Again I guess it depends on how much metal you have to begin with.  I have some large parts to de-rust soon (industrial wood copy lathe) so I'm either going to do the wheelie bin thing or make up some lengths of PVC sewer pipe with end caps to do narrow long things.  It's a neat process and at a price I can afford."
Blacksmith,3b5ktc,carbonnanotube,1 point,Sat Jun 27 14:16:10 2015 UTC,"We use glucose as a reduction agent in the lab for a few interesting materials synthesis steps, most recently using it to form copper nanowires.

Blacksmith,3b5ktc,verdatum,2,Fri Jun 26 19:15:57 2015 UTC,"Evaporust and such products work faster, but they give you less control.  If you leave them in too long, they will start to eat away the steel."

Blacksmith,3b5l0i,Davidhasahead,3,Fri Jun 26 03:53:04 2015 UTC,Less dense so it burns up faster than coal or coke.  Doesn't stick together like smithing coal.
Blacksmith,3b5l0i,ColinDavies,3,Fri Jun 26 11:27:47 2015 UTC,"It can be cheaper than coal/gas, it really depends on where you live. And yeah it also burns faster. It's also full of volatile gas pockets, so it pops and sparks everywhere. I've also heard people say that it doesn't burn as clean as coal does, in the sense that it leaves behind a lot of ash and stuff."
Blacksmith,3b5l0i,Fargraven,2,Fri Jun 26 11:59:24 2015 UTC,"Depends on how you are sourcing you charcoal. If you are just going to order some natural large chunk online, you're better off for the same amount of money (or slightly more) ordering coal, as charcoal burns faster, takes more work to clean/maintain your forge, and is a bit harder to manage (in my experience) than coal.  But if you've got a stand of trees that need to come down anyway, and the room to make your own charcoal, then I suggest going that route, as all it costs you are some time, and you needed the trees down anyway! (Sometimes I look on craigslist/want ads for people who need trees down, and get my wood that way)."
Blacksmith,3b5l0i,Aarinfel,1 point,Fri Jun 26 13:06:46 2015 UTC,"In addition to the things others have listed,  I also think it radiates heat on you more than coal does.    I think as the coal cokes up it shields you from the heat by creating a more solid mass,  something that charcoal doesn't do.  It's a little anecdotal, but I always feel hotter when I'm working with a charcoal fire."
Blacksmith,3b5l0i,drewmsmith,1 point,Fri Jun 26 14:03:32 2015 UTC,"Lower quality charcoal in particular tends to create a lot of sparks; and those can get annoying; particularly when they mask the fact that you've started burning your iron.  Because it is less dense, if you really crank your blower, it can cause the charcoal to blow all over the place, which can get annoying.  Oh, and to clarify, briquettes are garbage for smithing.  Don't use them unless they're literally free.  They're low heat, high ash."
Blacksmith,3b5l0i,verdatum,2,Fri Jun 26 17:31:32 2015 UTC,I wouldn't even use them if they were free.
Blacksmith,3b5l0i,Sluggishunicorn,1 point,Fri Jun 26 19:47:43 2015 UTC,"A lot of blade smiths use charcoal because its a cleaner fire (but does leave behind ash).  Personally, i use coal.  more BTUs than charcoal and relatively easy to source for me.  coal wasn't used for blacksmith until several hundred years (not sure exact time) ago, before that, it was all charcoal.  you can make your own charcoal by sealing wood in a metal container and cooking it, vent it to release wood gas, google/youtube will show you the way :)"

I am only just starting to get into blacksmithing, but have realized that using grindstones will not work for me, I also don't really know much about the stage between having forged a blade and having a razer sharp blade :P"
Blacksmith,3b1761,verdatum,1 point,Fri Jun 26 02:54:20 2015 UTC,"in my opinion for the steps between having forged and cleaned the blade to having a sharp knife you have 3 options,   using a belt grinder using the previously mentioned paper wheels or the lansky sharpener   i like the lansky system myself i bought all sorts of extra stones for it including a strop an ultrafine and a serration sharpener. it is tedious work incase thats why you don't want to use regular stones, i find it relaxing and you will get a consistent angle and a better edge much easier than the other options."
Blacksmith,3b1761,tulsavw,1 point,Fri Jun 26 14:16:18 2015 UTC,"Well the belt grinder seems to be looking like the best option. and I have said why I don't like using grindstones :/ I mean I CAN, but if there is another option, especially for multiple knives then I will take it. So you think belt grinder would be best? Can you recommend any particular UK stuff for it?"
Blacksmith,3aycvr,gustfape,1 point,Wed Jun 24 14:16:31 2015 UTC,"I don't particularly recommend building your fire against a boulder like that.  It's a big, dense, thermally-conductive mass.  It's going to suck away a lot of your heat; heat that you would rather have going into your hunk of steel.  Plus, a hot fire over a long period of time may cause the thing to crack or shatter which is a bit of a safety risk.  You'd want to clear all of those small rocks out of the way for the same reason.  If you do build here, to make it effective, you want a good thick layer of ash between your fuel and...well, most everything.  Ash can withstand high temperatures, and is not very conductive.  3cm is too narrow for an effective tuyere (air pipe).  You want a nice wide pipe, that allows air to move at high volume low pressure. A narrow pipe can only provide high volume if it is also at high pressure; which means it's gonna blow your coals away, send your ash flying, all that stuff.  Your pipe should be closer to 6-10cm.  In general, if you have your forge designed correctly, tuyeres don't have a major problem with melting.  The times when the fire is the hotest is when the air is on. and when the air is on, that same air is  cooling your pipe before it hits your fuel.  For a side-blast forge, most of the thing should be covered in clay or dirt or whatever."
Blacksmith,3aycvr,verdatum,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:17:46 2015 UTC,"Thank you for advice :) I figured out a new spot to build it, and I'm now thinking of digging a pit, lining it with concrete and then dirt/clay, or simply using fire-resistant concrete if I can get that for cheap somewhere :) Also I found a pretty big steel pipe (old chimney pipe), that I think would suffice. Thanks a bunch for your input. So much I would never have thought of on my own. :)"
Blacksmith,3aycvr,verdatum,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:02:08 2015 UTC,"Don't use concrete.  If you want, you can use castable-refractory, but if you ask me, it is sort of overkill, especially if you are trying to do it on the cheap.  Stick with clay, or better yet, cob (clay + sand + straw).  Pluck out any rocks you find as you go.  Once in place, fire the clay with a small wood fire (no air!) for a day or so.  It might crack.  No big deal.  To avoid aggravation, use this type of forge with charcoal only."

Blacksmith,3aycvr,Zazafraz13,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:40:57 2015 UTC,"Elaborating a little on what verdatum has said, for your air source you should probably just pick up a piece of 2""-3"" steel pipe.  Also, you will find that a leaf bower is going to put out a lot more air than you are going to want.  You will need to either make some sort of air gate to restrict the air flow or put the blower on some kind of speed controller/rheostat.   Note that reducing speed with a rheostat may also reduce the life of the blower motor."
Blacksmith,3aycvr,Wesreidau,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:27:32 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I'll look into alternatives to the leafblower. Not sure what to do yet but if nothing else I'll try to make some sort of adjustable airgate :)"
Blacksmith,3aycvr,noware6,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:57:54 2015 UTC,"Elaborating a bit on what /u/beammeupscotty2 said, a leaf blower would be overkill on air flow. I would recommend (on a budget) finding a used shop vac from a yard sale or some biz as your blower. And pick up a few reducing couplings and a hose barb while you're at Home Depot getting a larger diameter tuyere. Alternatively, Home Depot sells a 'Bucket head' shop vac (it's just the motor and hose essentially) for like $20. I use one and it works perfectly for me.   Good luck!"

Blacksmith,3az240,staklininkas,2,Thu Jun 25 08:12:29 2015 UTC,"Since I came to blacksmithing through history-related obsessions (not vidya games), I have to point out that these are historical alloys, and their properties are (relatively) known. If that still qualifies as ""fantasy metal"", then okay."
Blacksmith,3az240,icecoldcelt,0,Thu Jun 25 09:54:41 2015 UTC,Both of them are so rare that they might as well be. Personally I just have a big ole boner for bronze.
Blacksmith,3az240,staklininkas,2,Fri Jun 26 01:29:13 2015 UTC,"i came here for reasons unrelated to my love of fantasy, i'm new here so i can't speak to the fantasy nerd to history nerd to DIY nerd ratio here, so i will leave discussion of the community makeup to the veterans and constrain discussion to alloys. now with fantasy there is generally..no rules to making things up. you throw in dragon fire or a basilisk Bezoar and you have whatever properties you want, throw in magic and everything is out. so the best way to begin is to ask yourself ""what do you want the metal to do"" a good example would be from a song of ice and fire: Valerian steel. in some ways it's similar to damascus steel but it has particular properties (it can kill white walkers, it never loses it's edge, it never rusts or tarnishes) and it achieves this by magic (the steel is worked with spells not a forge)  so begin with what you want the metal to do, what you want the metal to look like and how you want it to act, then work on how you achieve this. for added points you can use fantasy methods to make modern metals and alloys, perhaps you have a creature which produces a ruminant that, when heated and mixed with vitriol creates a black powder that, when used as a flux in the forging process produces an incredibly strong steel (this black powder would be carbon nanotubes which get impregnated in the steel, but the structure of the powder would be unknown to the people in the story) or using the heat of a fire elemental or a dragon's flame to reach temperatures higher than people of the time could do, this also opens up modern alloys, using the hide of a dragon or similarly heat resistant creature could allow you a crucible that could hold molten tungsten opening up alloys in that area (tungsten is also known as wolfram, probably go with that when referring to it)  but you might try some of the folks at /r/DandD they might have some good ideas for imagines alloys."

Blacksmith,3az240,indyvet,6,Fri Jun 26 06:51:34 2015 UTC,"""I'm pretty sure that most of the /r/blacksmith community got into it through works of fantasy.""  I am pretty sure you are wrong about that, at least when it comes to members who actually know something about blacksmithing.  I am sure a lot of us got started in smithing long before such things as WoW, Minecraft, Life is Feudal and other fantasy games that feature faux blacksmithing even existed.    I expect what you say is true for all the ""ingot makers"" who show up here, sometimes with painful regularity, but then, I don't really consider them part of the community.  If you want to discuss fantasy games I suggest you move to a sub dedicated to them."
Blacksmith,3az240,beammeupscotty2,1 point,Thu Jun 25 00:43:13 2015 UTC,"So... In terms of differences in the finished product, I think the possibilities are kind of boring.  You can amplify physical properties like tensile strength, hardness, toughness, wear resistance... Or you can give it whatever magical property you want of the form ""does x magical thing to y other thing under z set of conditions"".  I think it would be more interesting to give it magical properties during forging - weird behaviours that make it difficult to work with but allow the creation of amazing things.  Smiths already talk about doing things to hot metal that it does or doesn't want to do.  Upsetting, bending the hard way, etc.  You could have a material with a bit of a personality that has real preferences about how it is worked.  There are also some fundamental facts of hot metal that you could play with, like heat always moving from hot to cold.  Getting heat in the right place is a big deal for us.  Suppose you can shift it around just by whispering the right words to the metal.  That would allow you to do things that are otherwise impossible."

Blacksmith,3atkba,fluffy-d-wolf,1 point,Tue Jun 23 17:06:20 2015 UTC,It's sort of a three sided mortise. I did put a couple of tack welds on the open side for added security though. I was worried that it may work loose over time.

Blacksmith,3au6ty,nf5,8,Tue Jun 23 21:51:12 2015 UTC,"When you can keep the fire small, but nice and bright, it means you have a very concentrated heat source.  And when you want to just heat a small portion, like the tip of your workpiece, this is useful, both for not overheating the rest of the steel, and not generating a whole mess of heat that just goes up your chimneystack.  Wasted heat Does nothing but reduce your coal reserves, generate more clinker, and shorten the lifespan of your forge."

Blacksmith,3awbyo,Dwarfboner5000,2,Wed Jun 24 03:45:44 2015 UTC,"Take some days to go and visit antique stores, sometimes they'll be overpriced depending on who's selling. Also look in old barns, farmers and technicians usually have them stored away for no reason. Usually old people don't overprice them because they see them as a tool and not a decorative piece which is the main reason prices for them are so high. Where abouts are you in Ontario?"

Blacksmith,3aww7e,SnickeringBear,3,Wed Jun 24 03:51:10 2015 UTC,The value of an anvil also depends on the anvil supply & demand in your location.  People usually don't like to transport anvils very far.
Blacksmith,3aww7e,verdatum,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:42:39 2015 UTC,"I've heard reference to $ / lbs for anvils. But I know it differs from place to place. I think if you checked craigslist for your area you might get some idea of what they are going for.   Of some note, people other than blacksmiths, are buying anvils so it depends on supply and demand in your area. As another poster has noted, anvils are pretty pricey to ship so it tends to be a very local market.   As for an actual value, anvils here in the Pacific Northwest (Canada) are going for about $2-3 dollars a pound and even a dollar or two more in some cases (antique dealers rather than blacksmith sources)."

Blacksmith,3aww7e,tulsavw,2,Sat Jun 27 04:39:56 2015 UTC,"No one asked to buy your anvil.  Likewise, as you can see, no one has given you anything like an actual value because without knowing the condition and possibly the maker, no one can give you a realistic answer.

Blacksmith,3aww7e,edanius,2,Sat Jun 27 13:13:31 2015 UTC,I expect someone to be able to talk about what a good anvil is worth.   $2-5/lb is going to be about as close to a guess as anyone will be able to give you without knowing a brand or exact weight.  A bigger anvil will usually bring a little more money per pound.

One thing you can do is make your hardy tool shanks offset so there is not much load around the actual hole.  You could also consider placing the hole near one side where it is more supported by the wall of the hollow shape."

Blacksmith,3asnuy,mountedpandahead,2,Tue Jun 23 04:47:32 2015 UTC,All the full time smiths I know do hand rails and gates and such. Lots of smaller welding work is pretty easy money too. I'm trying to not get stuck making nothing but handrails as a career... you have get creative and generate interest in your work and/or go to trade shows to sell enough smaller items to get by.  I'm testing the waters on making swords and possibly armor but I can't compete with most of the general stuff you can buy online so again I'd have to generate interest and do custom work.

I know it's not really 'smithing' and it's pretty labor intensive, but I've found I can do (most of the basic mindless parts) at night while sitting on the couch watching TV with the wife. Chain sells really well, even if it's small things like dice bags, or coifs/bracers.  I've been wanting to get a forge setup so I can make some scales to add scale-mail to my list of 'yep done that'."

In terms of time/cost buying one online is far superior than any living wage for making one by hand. Little chain pieces i'm sure do sell quite well but I prefer larger projects so I wouldn't have to set up craft booths all the time. Mostly home and garden type pieces or custom railings. All very circumstantial. If you want to do scales, just buy them from theringlord.com, you'd have to make a jig, cut all the pieces with a shear, punch the holes, and add the shape. Multiply that by 10k and you're gonna have a hefty price tag....  It's about demand, interest, personal preference, and most importantly EFFICIENCY."

Then i upset the top while pinching the stem in the vise and rotating it so it's even.

Used that as well to make some grass on the bottom,  and chiseled in the gills. Colours are from a blow torch after a brushing on the wire wheel."
Blacksmith,3asc5w,spootyspootspoot,7,Tue Jun 23 02:57:08 2015 UTC,"Looks more like a forging version of the competition on the cooking show titled ""Chopped"" which brings a fresh group of competitors to the show every week.  If they get picked up for an extended run, there will likely be a ""battle of the winners"" show at the end of the season.  I thought the concept of giving a bladesmith only 3 hours to forge a knife to be a little bit unrealistic.  The additional 3 hours to refine the blade and add a handle mitigated the excessive time constraint somewhat.  I didn't like that they referred to the blank as ""High Carbon"" steel.  They should have told the contestants exactly what grade of steel they were using, so they could make a more informed decision in their approach to heat treating.  I was happy to see that the guy who quoted Conan the Barbarian get knocked out after an epic fail in the first round of the competition.  When he was clanging his blade against his post vice, I said ""Don't do that"" out loud....and he got exactly the result I expected.  I saw no attempt to temper after quenching on the part of any of the contestants.  I am wondering if that portion of the filming just got cut for time - but the appearance of stress fractures in two of the 4 blades makes me think that tempering was skipped in order to conform to the rigid time constraint.  If they continue to do bladesmithing in each episode from this point forward, I probably won't continue to watch."
Blacksmith,3asc5w,indyvet,3,Tue Jun 23 05:17:57 2015 UTC,"Let's be fair to the show, though. They probably did tell the smiths the content of the steel. The audience isn't really going to understand it so the taped line was probably just changed.  I definitely agree about the time restraint contributing to a lot of the blade issues, though. I was sad to see Rich lose his first try at the katana. Especially since he was apparently doing everything by hand. I feel like his handle was a byproduct of the loss in time so he just went with the handle-type he was comfortable making quickly.  I'll definitely keep watching."
Blacksmith,3asc5w,MC_Carty,1 point,Tue Jun 23 12:51:52 2015 UTC,"They should have told the audience either way. If they understand it or not, many people will want to learn"
Blacksmith,3asc5w,GKnives,1 point,Thu Jun 25 20:58:42 2015 UTC,"I definitely agree with all of that. While watching it, I had a lot of unanswered questions about the actual knifemaking aspect of what they were doing. It seems more focused on the competition aspect. I'll probably keep occasionally watching though. I like to see how the finished knives look, with the parameters they have to meet."

Three hours means there is no real tempering, and that would certainly account for all the cracks. I'm hoping that they allow for more of the finer detail of forging and bladesmithing to be seen. Also, I was really rooting for Rich, because his was a hand worked blade that looked to me to be done in a more ""true"" manner.  All in all, not bad and I'll give it a second go..."

Blacksmith,3aryzb,BerserkBehemoth,2,Tue Jun 23 01:02:05 2015 UTC,"Technically, yes, galvanized steel is covered in zinc, and zinc vaporizes well below normal forging temperatures.  Inhaling this zinc can make you sick.  Many inexperienced people fly off the handle over this risk, because they hear horror stories about it potentially being fatally toxic.  All the reputable, non-anecdotal sources say this is the exception to the rule.  Absolutely, it shouldn't be messed around with. And yes, to some extent, inhaled zinc can stay in your system awhile, and it can build up, and there's no way that can be a good thing.  I've given myself metal fume fever at least twice by being stupid, and it absolutely sucks.  It tends to be like a 24-hour cold, but it can be like an extremely bad one.  But this doesn't mean you cannot work with galvanized.  there are two solutions.  Either dip the metal in an acid until the zinc is dissolved It takes like 3 seconds in a 1:1 solution of HW-store muriatic acid and water; though it is scary and dangerous stuff to work with.  You can do just as well with citric acid crystals and water, or a soak in distilled vinegar.  An easier solution is to just put it on a good hot fire, possibly your forge, preferably outdoors, and just stand clear in a ventilated area until all of the zinc has either evaporated or oxidized.  Zinc oxide is the white crust that's left over. It's pretty safe. It's used as white pigment and as sunblock.  Brush it away with a wire brush, and happy forging.  Cadmium was mentioned.  Chromium is another one you'll see. it's in stainless steel.  You mention CNC experience, then you may know about 12L14, which has a little bit of lead to improve machinability.  I've never tried it, but from what I read, just don't forge with that stuff because it just doesn't behave well."
Blacksmith,3aryzb,verdatum,2,Tue Jun 23 23:07:30 2015 UTC,"Thank you, this was super informative. Yeah I wasn't told to never use galvanised steel but if I do, only do it in a well ventilated area."

I'm not going to go on about injuries, I've been working in heavy industry for ten years, don't really want to scare you, but I dropped a dinner plate on my foot the other night and I damn near fucking cried like a baby.

Just make sure the filters are fine enough, and rated for smoke/fumes. But fixing your chimney/ventilation would ultimately be the permanent solution.   I'm about the same age as you.

The second hard thing about forge welding is forge welding 2 things of very different sizes.  Practice that too, plenty.  The 3rd hard thing about forge welding is welding different alloys together.  welding a blade onto a broadaxe is more difficult than welding a blade onto a regular hewing axe because the former requires you to just balance (or cheat and tack-weld) the blade on the surface.  With a hewing axe, you make a trench, and sorta crimp the blade into the center."

Blacksmith,3ao4ro,Mac1822,3,Mon Jun 22 16:13:34 2015 UTC,"That thing would blow your coal all over the place,  It's way overbuilt for a forge blower.  At one point he demonstrates it's pressure by levitating a wooden mallot with it.  It's got plenty of pressure to get the job done and then some."
Blacksmith,3aqogy,Thylumberjack,3,Mon Jun 22 18:56:09 2015 UTC,You are correct in your assumption that the 1200 watt rating has to do with the heating element. Pushing cold air it will draw maybe 50 to 100 watts.  That does not change the fact that a hair dryer is a pretty poor source of air for a forge.  You would be far better off with a 150 cfm centrifugal fan.   Something like this would do the job I think:  http://www.amazon.com/Fasco-A166-Centrifugal-Blower-Bearing/dp/B0099BO9FI/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1435016877&sr=8-2&keywords=centrifugal+blower#product-description-iframe  Not quite 150 cfm but 110 would probably be fine and at 1.4 amps it draws only about 154 watts.

Blacksmith,3aqogy,eyebrowgamestrong,1 point,Tue Jun 23 03:26:44 2015 UTC,"Depending on how much you're willing to spend, a hand-crank blower sounds like it could be a good way to go, especially since you're off the grid. This way, you won't have to pay for fuel for the generator and you will get a lot of control over your air flow. I believe they can be found on eBay for around 75 dollars."
Blacksmith,3anz9y,Xmr_bubbleX,2,Mon Jun 22 02:03:06 2015 UTC,How do you attach the blade to the antler?
Blacksmith,3anz9y,biggreenfan,3,Mon Jun 22 02:20:40 2015 UTC,"get the tang pretty hot, and push it in real hard. The inside of an antler is soft enough that you don't need to drill it. Use a wooden mallet (or a 2""x4"" if you're me) to get it in the last cm or so. once you've got it in there, take it out again and throw some epoxy in the hole, put the blade back in and let it sit till' the epoxy is hardened."

Blacksmith,3apmlj,t0b4cc02,3,Mon Jun 22 14:01:56 2015 UTC,"It can probably work, with some modifications. I'd cut all around the edge; about 1-2"" from the top and bend it over, to make a hearth for coal. However, it would be a small hearth so maybe you can weld some thin plate around it, to make a wider hearth.   But ultimately I'd reccomend insulating it with some clay or something, because it will probably melt otherwise."
Blacksmith,3apmlj,Fargraven,1 point,Mon Jun 22 16:54:10 2015 UTC,cool and about the fan thing.  is it good enough if i just cut 2 slots into the bottom and use something like this to give the fire more power? or is the fan-pipe system way too good?
Blacksmith,3apmlj,AeroFace,1 point,Mon Jun 22 17:37:15 2015 UTC,"Use a pipe and a hand blower or an electric one such as a blow dryer, while that might work I'd imagine it won't work very well."
Blacksmith,3apmlj,Fargraven,1 point,Mon Jun 22 19:43:20 2015 UTC,"The fan and pipe system is the way to go. A hairdryer is one of the most common things to use., but it uses electricity. A hand crank blower is another option, but they can be expensive. But they don't use electricity and you're not cranking while you're hitting the metal, so you save coal by not burning it as fast."
Blacksmith,3apmlj,Actionbuilding,2,Mon Jun 22 20:13:15 2015 UTC,I tried something similar several years ago and melted a hole right through it.
Blacksmith,3apmlj,Vanhugenstein,1 point,Mon Jun 22 20:11:12 2015 UTC,Cut a hole in the bottom and drop a break drum into it.  Build your twyre off of that.  Coat a drain grate with furnace cement and use it to cover the air hole.  the grill itself becomes the hearth area.  I will say that a 55gal. drum can be used way easier and cheaper...and you can paint it glossy black..other advantages to the drum as well.

Blacksmith,3antv8,Zazafraz13,3,Mon Jun 22 01:11:07 2015 UTC,"looks like an solid solution.  I actually used the opposite for a while,  cutting a hole in the bottom of the barrel and using it as a chimney for my fire.  It limits the size of the stock I can use,  but I don't normally forge anything crazy long anyway.  The local blacksmith guild is in the process of producing new firepots and I'll be adjusting things once it's completed."

Blacksmith,3antv8,drewmsmith,1 point,Mon Jun 22 02:23:10 2015 UTC,"I flipped through all my photos and didn't really have any that showed it in good detail.  I'll try and explain a little bit.   So I have a table with a hole in it,  ontop of that table sits a 30 gal. barrel.  The drum has an arch cut out of the front of it that runs from the bottom weld seam up about 20 inches and then back down the other side.  The brake drum (actually disk in my case) sits into a hole in the bottom of the barrel and through to the underside of the table.  The barrel also has a hole cut in the top that I fit a piece of stove pipe through to further extend my chimney.  It's an outside forge,  so I just needed to get the smoke a few feet above my head and this accomplishes it nicely."
Blacksmith,3antv8,drewmsmith,1 point,Mon Jun 22 15:48:10 2015 UTC,Oh I see. I don't have a chimney system and just work outdoors. I don't really find myself inhaling a lot of smoke. Only during start up I suppose. But would you recommend I find some system?

I've heard that many cast iron forges have explicitly written on them, ""clay before use""  I built my own forge from this big cast iron...thing that I found in my back yard. Within five minutes of firing it up for the first time, it cracked. Here is the thread where I asked about it, there's some very informative comments in there.   I ended up digging up some River clay from some clay banks in my town and insulated the forge with about 1"" of it, maybe a little less towards the edges and on the bricks.   Make sure you slowly cure the clay with heat, or else the clay will crack as well. I speak from experience with this. I'd even reccomend starting with something as modest as a heat gun or hairdryer. Slowly build up to a twig fire, then small sticks, etc.   In the end, I was worried that I didn't use enough clay but it's been working fine, even with really hot fires for forge welding,  ever since I did it around a month ago."

Blacksmith,3aono7,rhannum01,3,Mon Jun 22 06:20:31 2015 UTC,"With belt sanders cheaper usually means poorer quality I am afraid.

Unless you are planning on grinding knives, a belt sander may not be the best option for you.  The Skil brand bench grinder you linked to is pretty poor.  Home Depot also sells an 8"" Ryobi bench grinder which is decent for about $69.00.   I have been using one for six or seven years now and it still works fine.

Blacksmith,3aono7,beammeupscotty2,2,Mon Jun 22 13:35:20 2015 UTC,"No, I decided to not replace it because a decent quality belt sander cost much more than it would be worth to me considering I do not intend to make knives.   People made knives and swords for centuries without the benefit of belt sanders.  That said, I seriously doubt there are any professional knife makers today who would choose to go back to files and jigs for beveling knife blades.  Yes you can make knives without a belt sander but it is quite a bit more difficult to do that way."

However, this is not a grinder so it will take much longer to grind in your bevels.   Belt grinders are pretty expensive and I would not personally recommend you buy that JET due to the price. Plus the disc sanding attachment i find rather useless. If you are willing to invest in a belt grinder I suggest getting a Coote belt grinder, but you will have to buy and install a motor. I have also heard people have had success with this Grizzly.  Recently I upgraded from that small harbor freight sander to a 2x54.5 belt grinder I got from craigslist for 250 dollars. It works wonders and I can make my bevels in 1/50 the time it would have taken on the harbor freight.

Blacksmith,3akddy,arnorath,6,Sun Jun 21 02:19:25 2015 UTC,"Nothing too exciting. You're basically just forging a long taper. Try to keep an ""octagon-ish"" taper going. Once you get your desired length, round/smooth it out and flatten it a bit into an oval shape. I used an old concrete chipping bit as stock. I'm assuming it's something like 1045. From what I've read, a legit heat treatment isn't necessary considering its a hot work tool, so I just normalized it a couple times. I just bought a cheap mastercraft 4""x36"" belt/disc sander on sale and cleaned it up with that. Then I filed a groove in as a marker so that I know when I've drifted to my desired size (which is about 1""x3/4"".) I am by no means an expert, but I'm happy with the result so far."

Blacksmith,3akpnr,Robdigity,2,Sun Jun 21 03:46:11 2015 UTC,"You could mix ferric chloride with pure copper (copper wire works fine) and paint it on freshly sanded/ground steel. It's not a true green, but it's easy to do and looks cool.  Alternatively, if you have a steady hand and a good torch, you could try to heat freshly sanded/ground steel until it starts producing green-hued oxides (although they aren't really green, more like bronze or blue-green)."
Blacksmith,3akpnr,TorchForge,2,Sun Jun 21 04:49:57 2015 UTC,"Wait, where does blue-green fit in the sequence of temper colours?  I have never seen this."
Blacksmith,3akpnr,ColinDavies,2,Sun Jun 21 11:22:20 2015 UTC,"It's a VERY faint blue-green. I can barely perceive it myself (but I also have mild red-green colorblindness, so that's a contributing factor), but other people say it has greenish hues. You start getting into that color range around 600+ degrees F, but different alloys of steel will temper at different ranges.  You also can get your bronze/browns at lower temperatures, and since brown is formed from multiple colors you technically get your green hues in there too.  Sample photos below:  http://www.anvilfire.com/article.php?bodyName=/FAQs/temper_colors_hardness.htm  http://www.mooseforge.com/images/heat%20treating/800px-Tempering_standards_used_in_blacksmithing.jpg  https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/aa/Tempering_colors_in_steel.jpg/1920px-Tempering_colors_in_steel.jpg"
Blacksmith,3akpnr,TorchForge,2,Sun Jun 21 18:03:07 2015 UTC,"OK, I see.  I guess the reason I have not noticed it is because any time I get something that hot, I'm intending to take it right up to grey (or glowing).  I found something else interesting, a full thin film interference spectrum.  The first band of colour corresponds to our temper colours and includes that very faint blue-green.  Then the oxide becomes effectively opaque due to thickness... But if it weren't opaque, we'd eventually hit that next band of amazing vibrant green.  Oh well."
Blacksmith,3akpnr,ColinDavies,1 point,Sun Jun 21 18:11:44 2015 UTC,"This makes me wonder if it would be possible to get a true green color if you were to temper the steel to a specific temp (such as 650), polish the steel while still hot to remove all layers of oxidation, and then allow a thin layer of oxide to form in an atmosphere reduced in oxygen (such as a container partially purged with shielding gas like argon). If it's the thickness of the oxide that causes the interference due to opacity, perhaps reducing the thickness of the oxide (even though it's only a few molecules thick) while maintaining the temperature would allow the formation of a true green layer of oxide. Oxidation could be arrested and the current layer protected by immediately cooling it rapidly in a light oil.  Just thinking out loud. I'll have to give this a try sometime."
Blacksmith,3akpnr,TorchForge,1 point,Sun Jun 21 20:09:08 2015 UTC,"I don't think that will work.  The thickness is what determines the colour - you need it extremely thick to hit the bright green band.  Unfortunately it becomes totally opaque long before getting that thick.  No doubt you could apply a thin film of something transparent and get it, but then it wouldn't be heat colour anymore."
Blacksmith,3akpnr,ColinDavies,1 point,Sun Jun 21 20:28:52 2015 UTC,"Ah, thanks for the clarification. This is good stuff to know."
Blacksmith,3akpnr,TorchForge,1 point,Sun Jun 21 20:33:42 2015 UTC,"Colin, I don't typically take it up to gray.  I take it no more than to blue and I have NEVER seen any hint of green.  Why we are debating the existence of green with someone who is admittedly red/green color blind is beyond comprehension.  Photographs frequently do not render colors the way that actually appear."

Keeping that in mind, I'd question his suggested chemical formulation as well.    I think there are probably commercially available patina finishes for steel that would give you green, though I can't point you to a specific one.  If you are trying to impart some sort of protective finish to the piece I would encourage you to paint or powder coat it.  No chemical surface treatment is going to impart any real weather protection"

As I said, I have been heat coloring metal work for over 20 years and have NEVER seen the slightest hint of green come out of that process."

Blacksmith,3akdln,biggreenfan,3,Sun Jun 21 01:34:50 2015 UTC,"All of the major general blacksmithing supply places sell smallish swage blocks and they are not terribly expensive, but they also do not compare with the swage blocks of yore which many professional smiths manage to get their hands on.    What to buy depends entirely on your own needs.  Many of the old blocks weigh 200 pounds and up and have a large array of different shapes of different sizes.   The modern ones tend to be much smaller and are much more roughly made, typically of cast iron with little or no finish work to remove the texture of the mold.  On the up side, they often include shapes not often found on the old blocks, things like negative spaces for forging fireplace shovels and regular hemispheres.   Blacksmithsdepot and Blacksmithsupply both have these modern styles, both at about 65 lbs. or lighter.  Centaur sells an intermediate size...between the old school monsters and the modern light weights, weighing in at 125 lbs. or so.  I rarely see one of those old ones going for much less than $600.00.    I have considered getting one of the modern blocks myself, mainly for the edges and the hemisphere depressions but when I recently priced out shipping on one from Saltforkcraftsmen, it ended up being a full half of the price for the block itself.  That sort of put me off buying one that has to be shipped."

I'm just wondering about the last photo though, it looks like the scarf is still very visible, while having read up on forge welding I'd anticipated seeing scarf lines all but eliminated after the weld had taken. Can you tell me more about that section of the metal?"
Blacksmith,3aev94,endersbean,2,Fri Jun 19 16:36:47 2015 UTC,"Basically this last bit was in a hurry as I was not in a shop I had 24 hour access to. I think I only had about 2 welding passes on this joint. Which is enough to set the weld on the mating surfaces but not enough to clean it up. Had I more time I would have taken more heats and blended the edges better but the weld is practically as strong, there are just artifacts of the 2 scarfs left on the sides."

Blacksmith,3afqpn,Bosskode,3,Fri Jun 19 19:42:32 2015 UTC,"I think you'll have to experiment with it to see how it responds.  it appears that that ar500 spec is based on performance,  not composition,  so each individual mill probably produces it slightly differently.   Id probably try a small piece, quench it in oil,  see if a file skates off it,  and then let the colors run on a temper to get to a safe hardness.  It's difficult to provide exact directions when so many variables are in play, but it sounds like you'll have plenty to practice with,  so go out and see how it behaves.  Also don't forget to record the results for everyone's sake!"
Blacksmith,3afqpn,drewmsmith,3,Fri Jun 19 19:58:26 2015 UTC,That actually helps a huge amount already. I thought the ar500 designation was the steel type. So I'll treat it like mystery steel and go from there thanks Drew.

Blacksmith,3acnfk,fergiz01,3,Fri Jun 19 00:55:06 2015 UTC,"Hopefully this works. (Pictures)    First three pics are from where I started my forging apprenticeship. These pics are 8yrs old.    The kid is loading jobs into the heat treatment furnaces. They weigh <1,000Kg.   This might be a 400 Tonne Press. The job is stock for the power hammers to make smaller jobs out of. Ingots the size of a fridge would be custom made at a foundry up the road and the press would forge it down to size. The jobs are picked up by machines called Manipulators. What the real name is I don't know but they are huge and have a large set of tongs/mandibles/pincers on the front. They look similar to the first picture but are about 5 times the size. They are not forklifts. The one on the left grabs jobs from the 3 furnaces to his right, backs out and drives up to the press. He never gets out of his seat (luxury). The glass window air conditioned room is where the blacksmith sits in a chair at a computer. He sets the machines height, which anvil (three of them slide under the press at the push of a button). One for pressing/punching (2nd pic), one for rings, one for rounding out shafts. You can see this one on the bottom left of the third pic. In front of that is a large skip bin that gets filled with 10mm thick scale that falls off which is on the anvil in pic 2. We would fill it every 2 days. The handles between the job and the camera are my hand tools which I would use to neck shafts, large tongs to pick up foot ball sized punches, measuring calipers 1m long, etc.   Place the punch in the center of the job, check with blacksmith for side view, hand signals only.  Press would lower slightly and connect with tool, I would steady it and then move out of the way and hide (literally) behind one of the four arms that the Press rises or lowers on. If the punch didn't go into the job, than it would ping out and fly across the workshop and punch through the wall. This never happened while I was there, but it has happened and that's probably how the job vacancy came up.  Once the punch went in, the job would be placed on its side and pressed slightly until the punch would drop out. It never dropped out, I had to bloody well pull it out with tongs and a glowing fridges worth of steel is hot on the gloves. The punch weighed about 20kg. The job would be placed upside down on the press and I would place some tools under it so it had a gap at the bottom. The middle of the job had a very distinct round flat spot from where it compressed the bottom. The punch went on upside down so it wasn't spreading but shearing this time.  Once it is all the way in, the press would rise and I would have a block that goes on top of the punch, to punch it in further. Take about 5 blocks, they lock together with a male/female shape so they don't slip. Once it punched all the way through it would fall out the bottom. The job would be lifted, I would remove the tools under the job and the driver would push the job through the press and out to my side (Be sure to get out of the way!) and the punch and blocks would fall out of it onto my side of the press where I would then place them safely away. We would punch around 12 gear blanks in a day, from ingot to anneal. They were for Germany's wind farms.   The 4th pic is of a Davy Press at Eveleigh Train Yards in Sydney NSW. My trade teacher worked there during his apprenticeship, it closed down and a heritage restoration artistic blacksmith company got to use it many years after to maintain the equipment in a usable fashion. The rest of the pics I'm sure you guys know what is happening, a few pics of us on an open day to the public when the management of the Train Yards wanted to shut us down and remove all the equipment of the workshop and turn it into store front cafe. The guy who's idea it was lost his government position of both heritage and new construction. Which seemed odd to have the same guy deciding what old stuff gets knocked down for new stuff to be built without anyone making sure it is a good thing to do.   The last pic is where I finished my career off, from Blacksmith to BoilerMaker, working on steam trains for a hobby, getting welding tickets, into AutoCAD to move into engineering. I'm quite happy now working in a nursery growing plants without the 5am starts in winter and 12 hour days."

Blacksmith,3acrur,ColinDavies,2,Fri Jun 19 14:47:23 2015 UTC,"I've read up on the subject because it really is fascinating. I'm running out of time but here is what I know:   Impurities in the mine used to obtain ore catalyzed the formation of multiwalled carbon nanotubes in the steel during the forging process. These impurities included vanadium, manganese, and chromium. Ancient texts refer to the smiths adding certain plants with very thin and tough fibers into the crucible. Some people believe that carbon in solution during the austenitic phase of the steel utilized these long fibers as filamentous nucleation sites for the formation of the actual multiwalled nanotubes. Another ancient text claimed that the Syrian smiths quenched their swords in air by creating a large air-scoop on the northern face of their shop with a small slit opening into the shop. They would only air quench their blades when winds were cold and constant. There is still much speculation on these swords and the process that went into forging there, but here is a cool picture of carbon nanotubes embedded in the steel grain of one of the blades: http://qph.is.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-be2489ced1353e5ada7ba0988ab726ee?convert_to_webp=true   More info here: http://www.rsc.org/chemistryworld/News/2006/November/15110602.asp  http://scienceblogs.com/notrocketscience/2008/09/27/carbon-nanotechnology-in-an-17th-century-damascus-sword/  http://www.nature.com/news/2006/061113/full/news061113-11.html"

The only other change i can think of when forging specific spear blades like this is that some prefer to forge the blade first and then the socket, however this pictured is the most common method.

Odd sizes like 5/16"" and 9/16"" tend to be more expensive if you buy new, plus using something slightly non-standard makes your work stand out that extra bit - so get those if available.  Apart from that, square stock between 3/8"" and 5/8"" is good stuff to learn on and to use for most beginner projects other than knives and tools.  Angle iron and square or rectangular structural tube will be useful for tools/stands.  If they have large sections like 4"" square, that can be your starter anvil.  Round bar is good for making tools like fullers, dog wrenches (bending forks), etc.  Try to get everything in the longest pieces you can manage, since this will give you more flexibility and hopefully less wasted metal."

Learn tapering, drawing out, turning with glancing blows, planishing, etc. You'll stay busy with all that for a good while, and it will become a little obsession of its own."

Blacksmith,3a69fe,Brutorans,3,Wed Jun 17 15:40:52 2015 UTC,It looks like you're using anthracite coal.  Have you looked into charcoal or bituminous coal?  I am using anthracite right now and have used other things before.  It seems tough to lite and maintain.  Also tends to heat unevenly and needs more air too I think.
Blacksmith,3a69fe,Vanhugenstein,1 point,Wed Jun 17 17:15:51 2015 UTC,I actually use a mix of 50:50 bituminous and anthracite. I find it works really well in my forge and have been getting better and better results the more I refine my design and develop my control technique
Blacksmith,3a69fe,Vanhugenstein,2,Wed Jun 17 17:18:17 2015 UTC,"Interesting...I imagine it depends on the individual forge too.  I might try that.  Have you tinkered with charcoal or coke at all?  Also, how do you fing the klinker build up?  Kinda a problem in mine with anthracite."
Blacksmith,3a69fe,Vanhugenstein,2,Wed Jun 17 17:35:33 2015 UTC,"I use charcoal to start the coal going which then gets the anthracite going. In all I go from damp fuel pit to heating material within 10-15 minuets. I do have the benefit of a constant air source which I can control with a voltage regulator. Once my paper is lit, pile on sticks, once they are catching put on a slight bit of air, once they begin to take better add charcoal and increase the blower, continue until you are ready to add old coke from a previous session, once that's caught I start adding my mix of green coal and anthracite around the spot I want to focus on and sprinkle a bit of water to control flames and the spread of combustion.   As for klinker its quite bad I have to admit. I plan to buy a sieve to separate out useful fuel from spent ash and klinker. As I stand I have t manually go through my waist by hand and pick out the crap. I think I am discarding lots of otherwise viable fuel this way so I am keen to find a better method. The side blast design is not ideal either as clinker rapidly builds up on the air pipe and blocks flow dramatically.   So far I have been getting really good results with my mix. If you live in the UK around Yorkshire I would be happy to share the supplier I use."
Blacksmith,3a69fe,antchrist,1 point,Wed Jun 17 17:39:15 2015 UTC,"You just answered like three or four questions I had about my forge.lol  I have a production made one, maybe 75 years old or so.  Changed the blower, added voltage meter and it was off and running.  The guy that gave me the forge also gave me a 55gal. drum of anthracite so I've been using that with mixed results.  I kept the stuff that dropped out of the twyre and picked out klinkers.  I find myself pulling huge klinkers once I've been going for a few hours. Sorry, I'm in the U.S."
Blacksmith,3a69fe,antchrist,1 point,Thu Jun 18 00:59:29 2015 UTC,"I'm also using anthracite coal. Switched from side blast to brake drum bottom blast, 40 mm hole with single 5 mm piece of rebar instead of a grate. Smaller clinker pieces fall through, the fire stays clean longer."
Blacksmith,3a69fe,verdatum,1 point,Thu Jun 18 06:41:32 2015 UTC,What kind of improvement did you see switching from side to bottom blast?
Blacksmith,3a69fe,icecoldcelt,1 point,Thu Jun 18 07:08:03 2015 UTC,"Hard to generalize as I was just starting out and my first design wasn't particularly good. Tuyere doesn't get consumed, no cold zone in front of it (tuyere size could have caused the latter). Better clinker control, fire lasts much longer."
Blacksmith,3a69fe,Macscroge,1 point,Thu Jun 18 17:50:02 2015 UTC,"As long as it isn't too horribly expensive, starting anthracite with charcoal is pretty darned effective.  Also handy when stuck with damp bituminous.  I hadn't thought of mixing anthracite and bituminous before.  I bet that would work pretty well.  I've got some major anthracite deposits near me, I should give that a try.  You might have a still better experience if you broke up your anthracite into something closer to walnut-size pieces; just conjecture though.  I was under the impression that clinker is usually pretty low with anthracite.  Maybe you've got some lower grade bituminous.  Interesting stuff.  Clinker buildup is nearly as bad with side-blast compared to bottom blast.  The best workaround is to use a fire-pot with a well designed clinker breaker.  I don't really like the kind that's the big honking cast-iron triangular prism, but it's what I'm stuck with at the moment.  I've been meaning to drill some holes in it to increase the airflow; just putting it off.  The side blast design is nice for burning all-charcoal.  The charcoal is so light, it can start to fly out of your pot with a bottom-blast forge.  Sorting clinker from coke is pretty easy.  You just put it in a bucket and lightly shake it a bit.  The coke, being less dense, rises to the top.  I expect this wouldn't work quite as well for a mix of fuel; clinker probably has a pretty similar density to coal."
Blacksmith,3a69fe,Macscroge,2,Thu Jun 18 15:13:43 2015 UTC,"Good progress! I like your forge setup, other than the bits of cinder block against the fire. That's dangerous and you know why. If I had that big piece of steel for an anvil, I would turn it up on edge, with the flat side vertical. The reason for this is to get more mass under your hammer. If it's able to flex, energy is lost into the deflection of the anvil. If you have a grinder and some time you could make a pair of flats, so it's an oval instead of a circle. You would want 2 flats so the anvil couldn't rotate. The stand would be a bunch of boards bolted together to support it. It might look something like this. Then you could turn it with the round side facing up and use it for drawing out material more quickly than over the edge of the anvil. Hell, I would probably even make some round and square swages around the circumference. It could be a kick-ass one of a kind anvil if you take the time to fix it up.   But it needs to be better supported than it is. You can't just let it hang over the air. There needs to be a cone of material directly under your hammer all the way to the ground. Think of where the forces go. When you have it at the center of a beam supported on the ends, the beam will just deflect and most of the energy you put into swinging the hammer goes to flexing the beam and very little of it will go into shaping your material. This will wear you out quickly. The same goes for un-hardened anvils, which is much less of a problem than your current anvil stand. Make it sturdy. Make it solid. Straight lines to the ground."
Blacksmith,3a69fe,verdatum,2,Thu Jun 18 01:44:46 2015 UTC,"He he that light 'brick' around the fire is not cinder block. It is a large section of industrial chimney liner rated up to 1800 degrees Celsius's. Very delicate to physical damage but otherwise perfect. I have it mounted on a bed of builders sand to keep it level and further insulated.   Edit: here's a picture of the liner refractory liner  I am torn with the anvil. As it stands that slug alone is around 40kg or so. Very dense and very hard. I want to get a tree stump to Mount it in but so far no luck in getting one. I found one just 5 min drive away but can't get a ride to pick it up! Infuriating. I absolutely understand what you say about both the safety issues and the orientation of mass. It is not an ideal setup in the slightest but I have plans to change it pretty soon. I won't be back in the forge for at least a week now sadly so I will try to post updates when I can.

Blacksmith,3a4eww,drewmsmith,17,Wed Jun 17 10:05:46 2015 UTC,"Tons of misinformation in these answers.    Modern Damascus is also known as pattern welded steel.  It's made by using two or more steels with different amounts of trace elements that effect the brightness of the stee,  Typically Nickle.  These Steels are welded into a solid billet,  then cut and folded over themselves.  That stack is drawn out and folded again,  each time doubling the total number of layers in the stack.  Additional techniques to produce different patters include twisting and reversing the folds.  Once the desired appearance is reached the object is then forged to shape.  After cleaning the steel is lightly etched to bring out the pattern.   A similar technique was used in feudal japan for making blades and such.  It was done because japanese steel of that era was very poor quality and needed to be ""cleaned"" of impurities.  By folding over and over they took those impurities in the steel and stretched them out,  mixing them throughout  the steel and making a more homogeneous product as a result.   Ancient Damascus was a type of wootz steel that was of incredibly high quality for it's time.  It also displays the banding of pattern welding,  but the actual technique of production was lost.  Several people have tried recreating it with some degree of success,  but modern steels are far superior any of these ancient techniques."
Blacksmith,3a4eww,marsh-a-saurus,4,Wed Jun 17 14:13:03 2015 UTC,"Damascus is multiple different types of metal welded and hammered together to form a solid billet. Then that billet it bent and folded over itself repeatedly, you can cut away notches in the billet or put holes on it to create certain patterns. After all the forging, bending, and cutting is done you let it sit in some acid to reveal the beautiful pattern you see.  Disclaimer: I apologize if any of this info is not correct or not specific. I am no blacksmith I am just going off of the multiple videos of blacksmiths making this incredible metal that I have seen."

Blacksmith,3a4eww,marsh-a-saurus,1 point,Wed Jun 17 15:00:57 2015 UTC,It's not necessarily pattern welding it's slabs of steel usually mixed with nickel i believe. Alternating types of metal with each slab. Then a couple of welds a placed on the outside to hold all the bars together until they can be hammered into each other.
Blacksmith,3a4eww,KnightOfAshes,4,Wed Jun 17 16:18:06 2015 UTC,"You literally just described pattern welding, which is welding in such a way that when you fold the resulting billet, you make a pattern. The starting metals for the colors in the pattern. Damascus steel in the modern era is a buzzword for pattern welding, always. True Damascus steel is only found on historical weapons and ceremonial items."

Blacksmith,3a4eww,icecoldcelt,1 point,Wed Jun 17 16:44:31 2015 UTC,"What you're describing sounds more like mokume-gane. Pattern welding can include aspects of mokume-gane, but more usually involve twists. Sometimes it includes forge welding bits to make shapes(see the flag?) in the cross section, which is then sliced accordion style and flattened out. It's an interesting process."
Blacksmith,3a4eww,autowikibot,1 point,Thu Jun 18 03:44:42 2015 UTC,"Mokume-gane:       Mokume-gane (木目金, Mokumegane ?) sometimes spelled Mokume-game, although this appears to be an erroneous variant; is a mixed-metal laminate with distinctive layered patterns. This term describes a Japanese metalworking procedure, which comes in the form of a mixed-metal laminate with distinctive layered patterns. Mokume gane translates closely to ""wood grain metal"" or ""wood eye metal"", describing the way the metal takes on the appearance of natural wood grain.   Mokume-gane has been used to create many artistic objects. Though the technique was first created to decorate swords, the art survives today mostly in the form of jewelry and hollowware.

Blacksmith,3a4eww,icecoldcelt,2,Thu Jun 18 03:45:30 2015 UTC,"Do you know how many layers you get when you fold something 100 times? Try folding a piece of paper 100 times. That's (Number of original layers) * 2100 . Did you know that 2100 =1,267,650,600,228,229,401,496,703,205,376? That's more than a Trillion times a Trillion layers. With a lattice constant of 286.65 picometers (that's in trillionths of a meter), and each layer being a sheet of single atom thickness, you would have to have a blade 363,372,044,555,421,957,939 meters thick. That's a quarter of the distance from the center of the Milky Way galaxy to its edges. For just an atom's thickness for each layer.   Did I mention that it's twice that if you start with 2 pieces? Yeah, it is. There is no point. This is misinformation that needs to be demolished every time it's repeated.  E: I forgot to mention that this was assuming a perfect crystalline lattice, which is much more compact than the actual configuration of steel in grains of crystals. Like I said: NO POINT. MISINFORMATION."
Blacksmith,3a4eww,icecoldcelt,1 point,Wed Jun 17 12:08:00 2015 UTC,No. You mean 300 layers. 100 folds is completely pointless. That's what I was saying. There would be no contrast because the layers would be indistinguishable from one another.
Blacksmith,3a4eww,icecoldcelt,2,Thu Jun 18 02:43:55 2015 UTC,"Ok, each time you fold something in half you double the layers. Take a sheet of paper. Fold it once and you have 2 layers. Fold it again and you have 4 layers. Fold it again and you have 8 layers. This is a 2 to the x power pattern. If you take one ""layer"" and fold it a number of times equal to x, then you get 2x layers. So if you take a single layer and fold it 9 times you get 29 layers, which is 512 layers. If you start with 2 layers and fold it 8 times you get 2 * 28 layers, which is still 512. Or you can take 3 layer and fold it 6 times and get 3 * 26, which is 384. This isn't very difficult math, any high school graduate should have seen this sort of thing...."
Blacksmith,3a4eww,Tift,-1,Thu Jun 18 03:23:18 2015 UTC,"Aside of the procedure, the advantage of doing this is that they outcome is at once very hard and a super plastic.  At the time that this was standard practice this was the best known way to achieve these goals out of steel."

What I see most often is to leave the top surface alone, clean it up with a flap disk if you really want but don’t remove to much material and try not to overheat it. Other than that, unless you want to invest the time and effort in to shaping a horn on one end, just bolt it down and get to work.  Nice find, especially at that price."

I'm an armorer full-time, but I don't make great money at it. I just went full time this last winter. I'm doing alright, but it could be better. Honestly, since I travel a great deal I would do much better with a permanent shop of my own but for now I'm doing the classic journeyman thing.

Blacksmiths would make the actual blank shoe for a farrier but that's where that ended.  Blacksmiths pretty much make everything but do not shoe horses."

You do whatever work comes your way until you become good enough and make a name for yourself doing something specific that you can focus on (if you want to).  It's a job for people who are kind of obsessed with it, not for people with a casual interest (but it is a good hobby for everyone!).  Many people seem to tend towards large installation sculpture and/or huge architectural commissions as they become more experienced and better known.  Others specialize in tools for fellow smiths, conservation/restoration/reproduction work, bladesmithing, maritime blacksmithing, household decor/hardware, etc.  Most blacksmith shops are job shops - there is not a continuous flow of work, but rather slow times and busy times.  If you are working alone then much of your job is design and interacting with clients.  Finishing is a large part of the actual physical work, taking way more time and money than you might expect.  Of total hours worked, forging itself takes up maybe 30%."

That is mostly done with grinding.  Maybe it's unclear in my steps, but the shaping I'm referring to after the forge weld is particularly for the head of the axe, namely redrifting the hole and getting a nice taper from the hole to the edge of the blade."

Blacksmith,3a2tvm,blinbla,1 point,Tue Jun 16 20:56:45 2015 UTC,"oh ya I see what you mean.  Ya that would definitely be a lot faster, only downside is the loss of material in an area where you can't lose too much material.  The most annoying thing about chiseling is how hot the piece is.  It's very uncomfortable to hold the chisel above a piece that is that hot."
Blacksmith,3a2tvm,icecoldcelt,1 point,Tue Jun 16 21:01:05 2015 UTC,"If you make the cut a little bit deeper and the carbon insert a bit bigger, the loss of material is not really an issue"

If you have the axe handle already, you can trace and cut out the head on a sheet of metal, like brass and use that as a guide for shaping.  The drift I was using was about 6 inches tall and a little more than 4 inches wide on the long side and a little less than an inch wide on the short side.  The top of the drift should be large and flat to make it easy to hit while the bottom should be no wider than the punch used to make the slot.  Hope that helps.  edit: actually, in the second picture that shows the slot punch about to be used, you can see one of the drifts on the rack, left-center of the picture."

Blacksmith,3a3f5k,RExOINFERNO,6,Tue Jun 16 23:35:08 2015 UTC,I have not found any screws from that period but certanly nails and bolts. The barn roof frames where I live are all held together with giant black iron bolts which have a protective oxidised outer surface. I have not yet seen any with any form of serious pitting or heavy corrosion despite being open to the elements for a few decades.   Most of the nails I come accross are firmly hammerd below the surface of the wood. Frequently I can recover them in pretty good condition but they rapidly oxidise when removed from the timber. Huge amounts of whitewash and creosote treated wood all over the farm.  Here are two examples of bolts that I recoverd and tried forging. As you can see they are in very good shape despite being exposed for well over thirty years: bolt heads
Blacksmith,3a3f5k,Brutorans,3,Tue Jun 16 23:44:51 2015 UTC,I was under the impression they used bluing and rivets. I may be wrong because I'm not entirely sure when bluing was first used.
Blacksmith,3a3f5k,2bi,2,Wed Jun 17 11:24:50 2015 UTC,"Bluing (steel):       Bluing is a passivation process in which steel is partially protected against rust, and is named after the blue-black appearance of the resulting protective finish. True gun bluing is an electrochemical conversion coating resulting from an oxidizing chemical reaction with iron on the surface selectively forming magnetite (Fe3O4), the black oxide of iron. Black oxide provides minimal protection against corrosion, unless also treated with a water-displacing oil to reduce wetting and galvanic action. A distinction can be made between traditional bluing and some other more modern black oxide coatings, although bluing is a subset of black oxide coatings.

Blacksmith,3a3f5k,autowikibot,3,Wed Jun 17 11:25:59 2015 UTC,A blacksmith's trick is to coat hot metal in bees wax and heat and repeat.  Gives an even hard black finish that is rust and wear resistant.
Blacksmith,3a3f5k,Vanhugenstein,2,Wed Jun 17 17:34:18 2015 UTC,"In addition to what everyone else said, wrought iron has a lower carbon content than today's mild steel. That makes it much less prone to rusting.  I've seen examples of wrought iron exposed to salt(!) water, and they weren't too badly pitted. In the same conditions, I would expect mild steel to rust away to mush quite quickly."
Blacksmith,3a3f5k,Toraeus,1 point,Wed Jun 17 02:13:50 2015 UTC,"I think you may be mistaken in your assumption that it is the carbon content of steel that makes it rust, or that carbon in any significant way affects an iron alloy's propensity to rust.  I think the reason that wrought iron may be somewhat less prone to rust than modern carbon steels is because of the structure of wrought iron.  You may have heard that wrought has a fibrous structure which is a function of how it is manufactured.  Each one of those ""fibers"" is actually surrounded by silica and it is that silica content of wrought that helps it to resist rusting."
Blacksmith,3a3f5k,beammeupscotty2,1 point,Wed Jun 17 14:19:21 2015 UTC,"Nope, there's plenty of research (ex), and I work in metallurgy, so I'm quite confident saying that lower carbon = lower risk of corrosion, as a general rule. There's even a grade of low-carbon stainless steel (316L), where the low carbon content helps reduce inter-grain carbide formation, which can serve as corrosion initiation sites, especially in welds.  From a simplified mechanics point of view, the carbon atoms in the iron crystal lattice are of a different size than the iron atoms, which creates a local zone of higher energy. This in turn makes the material stronger, but also makes it easier for oxygen to get in there and bond to iron (think of it as a stretched string being more resistant to pull, but easier to snap).  I'll have to check out the silica angle, although my gut feeling is that the silica content would have to be really high to encapsulate the ""fibers"" to any significant extent. Wrought iron has less than 0.25% combined sulfur, phosphorus, silicon and manganese, so I'm not sure how that would work. (As comparison, the very resistant Duririon has 14.5% Si, but that's a specialty cast iron alloy.)"
Blacksmith,3a3f5k,Toraeus,1 point,Wed Jun 17 15:58:24 2015 UTC,"So the word I have is that it is still not well proven what the main cause for wrought iron's corrosion resistance is.  That said, the layers of silica in wrought iron are very clearly defined.  It's rather similar to the grain structure of wood.  You can see them by polishing and etching the metal, but you get more of a feel for them if you try to work the stuff full force anywhere past full force.  The individual rolled layers of iron split apart (delaminate).  It kinda looks like when you soak a paperback book in water.  When working with wrought, you have to take this grain structure into account in your design or you risk having either the metal delaminate, or the piece being weaker than it otherwise would be.  Oversimplifying here, but think of the silica layers like coats of paint separating sheets of paper in a book.  On a regular book, if you drizzle water onto it, the  water will penetrate eventually straight through pretty quick.  If you With the paint, the water would need to wear away the paint, and then attack the page beneath, but the 2nd page doesn't particularly start to soak until the first page has washed away, and then the paint beneath has also washed off.  Now imagine the pages are instead plates of steel.  The percentage of paint by weight would be tiny.  But the paint would shield the lower layers from oxidation until the steel above has oxidized to dust, exposing the paint, weathering the paint away, and only then proceeding to the next layer.  Granted, there are other specialty alloys where when the surface oxidizes, the oxide layer itself acts like a shield, and oxidation isn't able to travel deeper into the steel until that oxide layer is worn away.  The chemistry for cast iron is a good deal different than steel.  In steel, carbon rarely goes higher than 1%, while cast iron carbon is generally 2.5-4%.  Silicon in cast iron is usually 1-3%, but that silica content is critical to drive the carbon out of solution so to form graphite particles."

Blacksmith,3a2vdh,Brutorans,2,Tue Jun 16 22:15:50 2015 UTC,"I haven't actually done much striking on it yet, but it's good to know to look out for bounce or vibration.  It only contacts the ground at the ends of the three legs and leaves about a 3/16"" gap under the rest of it, so I guess it could have some movement under heavy stress.  My hope is that the weight and strength of the material will prevent that but if it ends up being an issue, I'll probably just shim up the middle of the base with a bit of steel plate and call it fixed."

I mean anything that would be commonly used in forging ornaments   Get it hot, hit it with a hammer.  I can't really think of any traditional ornaments made by a blacksmith - ornamental work tended to be the province of the whitesmith (or goldsmith) - blacksmithing produced functional items.  Candle stands would probably be the most common 'not a tool' item you'd have around a house.  They could be embellished by all sorts of techniques (see below), but I'm struggling to think of any historical examples of that.    or engraving symbols into a blade (or hilt of a blade).   You don't want to engrave deeply into a blade - that's a point of weakness, and blades are tricky at the best of times.   The closest thing is inlay, where you use gravers (effectively: chisels) to cut out a small portion of the iron, then hammer in a different metal (or different type of steel).  This would be done before the item was hardened; if one was brave, the grooves could be cut, the steel hardened, then a different metal pounded in - silver or gold would work with that method.  Very shallow inlay could be done on hardened and tempered steel.  Actual engraving would be shallow, and thus limited to areas on the blade that wouldn't get damaged - doing it before hardening means they will be black, after hardening they can be bright, but it's much more difficult to do.  The traditional way to engrave post hardening would be hammer and graver; modern methods would use an air graver.    The typical parts of a weapon that would be engraved / inlayed are the cross guard / quillons or the pommel.  The hilt proper (the bit you hold) wouldn't normally - partly for practical reasons (not as good to grip), and partly because it wouldn't be seen when the item is held.  There are exceptions, of course - but that's a general trend.  Similarly, inlaided or engraved blades for actual use bigger than a dagger are relatively rare - the Ulfberht swords are unusual in this respect; and that's partly because the inlay material is also steel.  Exceptions do occur, but for weapons indented to be used, decoration on the cross guard, pommel and scabbard is the norm.  Where there is inlay work on the blade, it's typically shallow, and well away from the edges (or: all encompassing, and it's a display / ceremonial piece).  That would be done cold - and probably by a different craftsman, not the blacksmith.  Axe heads were traditionally made with the outer parts being a softer iron, with a harder steel core.  This is much more amenable to decoration than the blade of a sword or dagger.     I imagine to put 'studs'- for lack of a better word- on a piece of armor one would have to weld that sort of thing.   Nope, not welded.    First off, you don't want to put studs on armour - you want armour to be smooth, so that blades slide off it.  (Gothic armour has bends and folds, for strength in the steel, but still intends to present smooth surfaces to incoming blows).  You might be thinking of the small rivets in the corners of items, used to attach leather straps to the armour, or to articulate items (or just join them, e.g. for a spangenhelm). For attaching leather they have to be done cold (else the leather burns), which limits the maximum size of the rivet.  Articulation rivets can be done hot or cold - larger ones started hot; usually theres a degree of working cold in all cases, to give some work hardening to the steel.  For joining, the rivets would normally be of a size they would be done hot.  There is, by the way, far more inlaid and engraved armour.  Partly because armour itself was so expensive, the very richest wanted to have something to make them stand out.  Also, partly because the steel in armour was not normally hardend, meaning that such techniques were much easier, and not as much of a weakness as they would be in a weapon.   But when engraving/etching would the metal still have to be hot or is that something done as 'finishing touches'?   Engraving is done with a hand on the workpiece.  It's therefore done on cold metals.  On the tougher metals (iron / steel) is one, it's done with a hammer and graver traditionally.  It's also not something that's normally considered blacksmithing.  The traditional way for a smith to put a makers mark on something was to stamp it, rather than engrave it.  Etching is done to the whole item; or thereabouts.  Dipping hot metal into an etchant is possible, but normally only done when pickling jewellery - iron holds so much heat that dipping it hot into something is likely to boil a lot of it off, and acelerates the etching process.  Note that ectching a whole pieces will only revel a pattern in the steel (pattern welded, or (rarely) inlaid).  Etching a particular pattern is only possible in modern times, with stencils and electrochemical etching.  This is done cold - it's the electricity that does the work.  EDIT: For some reason I totally forgot about wax resist etching - which is a relatively common decorative technique for armour of Renascence times.  See below for more.  There's also chasing / repousse - this is usually considered a jewellery technique, but it is how the various folds and creases in Gothic armour are done.  Repousse is usually done cold. Chasing would be done cold.  In these techniques, it's not unusual to heat the metal, and let it cool during the work - this is to anneal the metal, as it otherwise gets stiffer during the operations."

Blacksmith,39z4o3,syntax,1 point,Tue Jun 16 18:27:54 2015 UTC,"Engraving and inlaying is incredibly common on swords; they just tend to be decorative or ceremonial swords.  Etching is not an exclusively modern process.  It was done without electricity; just using acid, for quite awhile.  Etching does not need to be done to entire pieces.  You can selectively etch either by thickening the etching solution, containing it in a mold-wall, or with less acidic etchants, just containing it in a sponge or a cloth."
Blacksmith,39z4o3,jedi_knt,1 point,Tue Jun 16 20:00:11 2015 UTC,"Engraving and inlaying is incredibly common on swords; they just tend to be decorative or ceremonial swords.   Yep, as I said, not common on actual weapons, outside of the cross guard and pommel.   Etching is not an exclusively modern process. It was done without electricity; just using acid, for quite awhile.  Etching does not need to be done to entire pieces. You can selectively etch either by thickening the etching solution, containing it in a mold-wall, or with less acidic etchants, just containing it in a sponge or a cloth.   I didn't say etching was modern - some of the ulfberht swords may have been etched, for example, to show up the iron inlay better.  I said pattern etching on steel is modern - which, on reflection was incorrect.  There's another method for patterns - coat with wax, scratch out the patten, and immerse, with the wax protecting the areas etching not desired in.  Not far off the 'mould-wall' process you were suggesting, just taken a step further.  This is the historically used method, with evidence going back to 1500 or so.  See, e.g, http://www.metmuseum.org/about-the-museum/now-at-the-met/features/2011/the-etched-decoration-of-german-renaissance-armor for examples.  Not sure why I forgot about that; so thanks for raising it."

Blacksmith,39z4o3,WanderingAengus,1 point,Tue Jun 16 15:57:42 2015 UTC,"Forging is used to make 3-dimensional shapes; such as making a pommel to look like a leaf, or an animal head, or something like that.  This work would be done hot.  Engraving is not typically done by traditional blacksmiths.  It's an entire trade all it's own.  But modern blacksmiths often have to end up doing everything themselves, so some learn a bit about it.  Engraving is done cold.  Traditionally, it could not be done on hardened high-carbon steel.  So engraving a blade would only be possible if it was a composite, made with hard steel at the blade edge, and soft steel for the rest; or if you selectively heat treated the blade (which is pretty much a strictly modern technique).  Nowadays, we have tungsten-carbide, which is hard enough to use for engraving hardened steel.  I've heard the process is still kinda aggravating though.  Engraving is done with a tool called a ""graver"". In modern days, it is often attached to a mini jack-hammer tool.  Traditional engraving had the tool struck with a long-handled hammer.  Blacksmiths only weld things together when absolutely appropriate.  The forge welding process is a pain, and easy to get wrong and ruin a piece.  If a traditional blacksmith can ever get away with riveting something together, he's gonna do it.  Of course, modern blacksmiths often have snazzy arc welders that make welding a breeze; so they are more likely to make use of it when not working on pieces that need to be historically accurate."

You could print one of these old Blacksmith books and hand bind it in come simple, cool manner that he could use as a reference while he's working at the forge.   You could also get him a cool journal / pens / pencil to record his ideas and progress - a place to keep his design ideas and write things down.   I've also picked up the Carbo app (http://www.creaceed.com/carbo/about) as a handy way to put my doodling sand designs in a electronic form for storing.   Hope that helps.

If he wants to make his own hammers and larger cuts, something like 40 mm C45 (1045) would be good. Hot rolled, it's cheaper. Mild steel like S235JR for random stuff (no hardening). Buying scrap is usually preferable for mild steel.  A large chain to add weight to his railroad anvil, a magnet to test for demagnetizing temp."

Blacksmith,39zdb3,tulsavw,2,Tue Jun 16 03:36:10 2015 UTC,"That depends on the design of your forge, and the costs in your area.  In terms of solid fuel, the most common choices are natural wood lump charcoal, and blacksmithing-grade bituminous coal. The amazon reviews for smithing books are generally pretty good and point you in the right direction. If you are trying to find a recommended alloy, wikipedia is a decent starting point.  Then, to get details regarding the physical properties of a particular alloy, just google the name along with ""alloy"" and you will find a spec sheet within the first couple links.   As a beginner blacksmith, most things you make should probably be with boring run-of-the-mill mild-steel.  The alloys are only important when you need your piece to either provide structural support (like a bridge), or requires a hard surface (like a hammer, or a cutting edge)."

Blacksmith,39t2fa,Kordwar,2,Sun Jun 14 15:03:36 2015 UTC,"That foot pump is far too small, it's designed to raise the pressure in a ball by adding small amounts of air a little at a time. What you need for a forge is a large volume of air delivered at only a bit above ambient pressure.  You can probably make a bellows from wood and cloth that would work, but it will have to be big, think several feet across. You want to use an output pipe at least an inch wide. If the cloth is damp it holds air better and won't catch fire when embers land on it."
Blacksmith,39t2fa,eggo,2,Sun Jun 14 17:59:37 2015 UTC,"The box bellows, common to Asia is a pretty good design. Not difficult to make if you have any woodworking experience.  http://www.anvilfire.com/bookrev/kapp/oriental_box_bellows.htm  It takes up much less space than the double-lung great-bellows.

Long story short, you take your steel, usually in rather thin plates, in order to increase the surface-area to volume ratio, you then put it into a lidded crucible, interlayering it with charcoal dust.  You seal up the crucible, and heat the thing at a fairly low temperature for anywhere from a few hours to a couple weeks.  If you have a fine enough scale, yes, you can determine the amount of carbon absorbed by weighing. Though I'm more accustomed to seeing people work it out by spark-testing it on the grinder.

Blacksmith,39sl9g,ColinDavies,2,Sun Jun 14 12:01:18 2015 UTC,"Yup, it's my understanding that today's pattern welded steel is purely cosmetic.   Back in ancient times, when steel metal was less understood and of lower quality, Damascus steel now only showed off a blacksmith's skills (like it is today), but it also to created a higher quality steel. But now, with today's knowledge and technology, you can't really beat a 21st-century steel mill."
Blacksmith,39sl9g,Fargraven,1 point,Sun Jun 14 18:51:25 2015 UTC,"If by ""iron"" you mean true wrought-iron, at least as it has been told to me, continuing to fold it would increase the number of layers in a bar, and after many repeated operations, the silica layers will eventually homogenize and slowly get driven out of the iron.  Depending on where you are situated, there may be names for these forms of wrought iron with higher amounts of folds, but at least from the period documents I've read, they aren't exactly consistent between region and historical period.  Because of the low carbon content, the result would not be quench hardenable, and thus not good for blade edges without further processing, such as carburizing."

Blacksmith,39rpsa,mathcampbell,1 point,Sun Jun 14 02:43:57 2015 UTC,"Not sure if you're on the right trick but yes you can use this.  One obvious caution would be to make sure it's dead empty.  I found the safest way (believe it or not) to do this is to open the valve to release any pressure.  Then take it to a firing range and pop a few holes in the top going through side to side making sure not to hit where you wouldn't want holes. Once this is done you know you are safe.  I wouldn't cover a forge like this.  It will disrupt airflow and won't help controlling smoke at all.  I would cut the bottom of the can out, line it with refractory material and use it for your firepot.  Then bolt your home made twyer onto the bottom and you're off and running."

Currently it's sitting on bricks because I haven't welded on the legs yet.  You're probably better off lining the refractory vertically so it all sets tightly, then attaching the legs so the whole thing sets horizontally with the bottom being semi-flat to maintain a coal pile."
Blacksmith,39rpsa,Slaiest,-2,Mon Jun 15 03:23:53 2015 UTC,"I have actually done this a couple times, first things first there is still propane in there.  So what I did was cut the valve off with a saws all. Then drilled in with a 2 in hole saw slowly very Effin slowly, then I took the tank and threw it I. The fire and waited to hear I giant whoosh.  When you do this you need to drill a big hole not a little one or u could end up with a bomb.  Once all what shit is done your free to do whatever you want with it."
Blacksmith,39rpsa,Tomscrambles,8,Sun Jun 14 04:54:56 2015 UTC,taking the valve off with a wrench and filling it with water is a much safer way to go about making sure that there is no residual propane left in the cylinder

No additional O2 required, etc.  Lots of forge ideas out there.  Many of us started by looking at anvilfire.com.  3 - hammer, anvil, fire.  :)  Nice thing about making tongs is you can hold them by the reigns while forging them.  Lots of videos on youtube on how to do it.  4 - Don't touch black metal.  All metal at a smith is hot metal.  Dunk it first, then put it on the ""finished"" table, then it's safe. Wear loose fitting light leather gloves so you can shake them off if they start to get hot.  Leather generates steam and will boil you before burning you.  Many people don't wear gloves at all for this reason.  I like a little warning so I do!  Never put anything galvanized in the forge - deadly fumes!"

Blacksmith,39ph3n,_Takashi,2,Sat Jun 13 14:06:36 2015 UTC,"1050 and 1095 are AISI (i.e. American) steel grades.  So that's why you won't find much under those names in the UK.  CS95 is the nearest to 1095; although that's usually only available in shim stock sizes.  EN43 is pretty much the same as 1050; although 2767 has a little more nickel in it, and might be better.  Basically, steel use in the UK is subtly different, dominated by engineering (off shore etc), and spring applications; most cutting tools tend to be D2 and O1, and left at that.  Better bet might be to find someone importing and reselling smaller quantities.  Such as http://www.patternweldingsteels.co.uk - which is probably your best bet initially."

Blacksmith,39lfjm,ColinDavies,1 point,Fri Jun 12 18:35:07 2015 UTC,So cracked stuff would be relatively useless? Would it be okay steel for just the heat and beat in the early stages to get more of a handle on good heating and shaping practices?
Blacksmith,39lfjm,ColinDavies,1 point,Fri Jun 12 19:02:50 2015 UTC,"It won't be much good for practice.  The heads will be awkward to hold and much thicker than the stock you will likely use to make most things.  It is also different, tougher steel that has a narrower and lower forging range than mild steel.  There won't be a lot in common between working with hammer heads and working with ""regular"" stock.

Blacksmith,39icdn,ManOfOpportunity,14,Thu Jun 11 22:33:29 2015 UTC,"""Weapons grade steel"" This is not a thing, but we follow ya ;)  It's probably a high-carbon stainless.  If not, expect spotting or pitting as time goes on unless you are super careful to keep it oiled/waxed.  If you want to find a proper skilled swordsmith, you should get in contact with your local Society for Creative Anachronisms (SCA) chapter.  They should at least have the contact info for someone who does this.  It may require you to mail your blade out and wait awhile to have it sent back.  Sharpened or not, (but extra true is sharpened) I feel the need to mention that if you ever spar with the thing, both you and your opponent had better understand that you never ever strike blade-edge to blade-edge.  That is a recipe for both blades having massive chunks taken out of them; the sort of thing you likely won't be able to grind past.  If you don't understand what this means, whatch Skallagrim on Youtube.  He goes into a lot of topics like that, and the controversial topic of whether swords like this would have historically been sharpened, and to what extent."
Blacksmith,39icdn,verdatum,4,Thu Jun 11 22:55:18 2015 UTC,"My particular sword has in fact begun to rust a little bit, although I think I only ever discovered one actual pitted spot. It was small, didn't worry me. It's definitely not stainless. From what I understand, the original purpose was for pretend-sparring, like how they do over at the Medieval Times places.  I haven't been doing much to keep it oiled, but if I can get this thing sharpened and cleaned up a bit, I would take much more pride in keeping it in good shape. Though I'm unfamiliar with whatever this waxing is you're talking about, I'm curious. I have some familiarity with the basics revolving around this craft, I always really had hoped I would some day get to try my hand at blacksmithing myself, but its not exactly a hobby you just go to a local craft store and pick up - especially without a home to call your own, with property to use as you please.  Anyways, thank you for the ideas so far. I'll look into this society chapter you've mentioned, hopefully with at least some kind of lead to go on. Thanks a lot."
Blacksmith,39icdn,verdatum,2,Thu Jun 11 23:19:45 2015 UTC,"Wax is just like oiling, only something that solidifies into a fragile, but water repellant surface.  Wax holds up a little better than oil, and it is good for things like long term storage.  Wax is usually mixed with a solvent so it can brush on easily.  If you get involved with SCA, there's a good chance they have a smith who can give you access to a forge during certain meetups.  Alternatively, you can find your local blacksmithing club, and attend meetings or classes.  But in general, yeah, to really learn something, you need a place where you can forge in your free time."
Blacksmith,39icdn,Silverlight42,2,Thu Jun 11 23:31:35 2015 UTC,"If you haven't been doing much to keep it oiled just find whatever non organic oil you got around and do it up....   barring that buy some baby oil -- it's just mineral oil (think it may be scented), which is what everyone uses on their katanas... choji oil I think it's called just scented with cloves if I recall.  super cheap, super available and super easy."

Matt Easton from Schola Gladiatoria would be a better source to watch."
Blacksmith,39icdn,Silverlight42,3,Fri Jun 12 02:01:11 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind that even though this thing may be made out of decent steel, it may not have been hardened or tempered properly.

Blacksmith,39icdn,Silverlight42,1 point,Thu Jun 11 23:53:20 2015 UTC,There is no way in hell this thing can be bent like that. It's roughly a quarter inch thick all the way down the middle of the blade.

I just meant can it flex at all or is it gonna stay bent or break?  cause a lot of bad swords they'll either not harden it or it'll be too hard.   still a decent test to make sure it isn't completely worthless."
Blacksmith,39icdn,primarynode,2,Fri Jun 12 00:23:12 2015 UTC,"I don't own a vice. :S There's nowhere to properly secure one to the floor of the garage, either.

Blacksmith,39hle3,AR_white,1 point,Thu Jun 11 19:40:04 2015 UTC,I made these for my father out of 304 stainless.  I want to make sure they are food safe though.  Are there any other steps I should take or just let them be?
Blacksmith,39hle3,Wild_Doogy_Plumm,1 point,Thu Jun 11 19:41:36 2015 UTC,I'd eat off them.  They make grill grates out of 304 so if that's safe then skewering a hot dog should be fine.  Maybe just give all the places that will contact food a good smooth sanding.
Blacksmith,39hle3,roy20050,1 point,Thu Jun 11 21:24:15 2015 UTC,Cool thanks for the reply
Blacksmith,39hle3,Mutant_Xj,1 point,Thu Jun 11 22:46:13 2015 UTC,they look pretty good to me though i cant quite get my head around the left and right ones with that curved in tip. anyways stainless steel was a good choice less likelihood to hold of rust or food. i'd just clean it up a bit grinding and what not to make sure no food bits sit in some crack or divot and go bad. maybe a food safe silicon handle. but i'm not master on food safety.
Blacksmith,39jehq,grauenwolf,1 point,Fri Jun 12 03:30:45 2015 UTC,"There are a few questionable things, but the general idea is right."
Blacksmith,39gsy7,Motorhead8333,3,Thu Jun 11 16:53:23 2015 UTC,"I made a similar one out of a charcoal grill, though I put a brake drum inside it, so the grill really only provides a stand and cover. Not sure how plaster+brick sand is going to hold up, but you definitely don't want to use pvc/abs pipe underneath (ninja edit: you can use pvc/abs further away but right underneath it will not withstand especially when coals fall through the drain). Get some iron/steel pipe fittings for that, and also of course be wary of galvanized pipe fittings, if there is any be sure to remove it either by soaking them in vinegar or safely burning them outside.   I also lined the inside of my brake drum with fire cement since the pipe fitting didn't completely seal the holes and since it insulates quite a bit. A layer of that on top of your plaster/brick sand might do the trick."
Blacksmith,39gsy7,bonoboner,3,Thu Jun 11 18:54:47 2015 UTC,"Adding to the ABS pipe comment. Make it metal and make it a T shape (turned 45 degrees) so that the horizontal leads to the fan, the upper to the chamber, and the loose ash falls to the bottom. Have a lid on the bottom. Check out tuyere designs."
Blacksmith,39gsy7,Tomriver25003,3,Thu Jun 11 19:11:23 2015 UTC,"It'll cost a little bit more but you're better off using actual refractory cement instead of the PoP/sand mix.  And ( someone more experienced correct me if i'm wrong ) i don't think lining the lid is necessary, unless you just want it so you don't burn yourself touching it.  But i've been setting a grill lid on top of mine when i walk away as a wind precaution and i haven't burned myself yet picking it up from the handle.  And like the other guys said use black iron/steel at least for the portion connecting to the fire pot, and add a T bend for an ash catcher.  then connect PVC or whatever to the metal pipe, heat shouldn't be an issue a foot or so down i've been using an old garden hose duct taped to an air compressor until i get a proper air source."
Blacksmith,39gsy7,Wild_Doogy_Plumm,3,Thu Jun 11 21:14:53 2015 UTC,"The roof/lid of the hibatchi is going to serve effectively zero benefit, and just get in your way, and get covered in charcoal soot.  Don't attach it. just save the lid to keep your firepot protected when not in use.  You want the ability to angle long pieces of steel into the hottest part of your coals, and to easily remove smaller pieces by way of tongs.  And if you ever plan to use coal, you want to be able to jam a rod straight down your air pipe to break away clinker.  To clarify, the charcoals are just gonna be too far away to heat the lid to the point that it is beneficially reflecting any heat back onto your workpiece. In a charcoal forge, the only portion of the piece that really heats is the part that is submerged right into the heart of the coals.  You need an ash-gate, or ash will fall into your pipe and clog it up, forcing a breakdown just to clean it out.  It's just a t-joint directly below your tuyere with a plate of steel (not terribly thick) coverng the base in such a way that you can swivel it open and closed.  Plaster of paris kinda sucks.  invest in some proper refractory mortar.  Another possibility is cob, a mixture of clay, sand, and straw.  When you lay your refractory material in place, try to mimic the shape of a commercial firepot.  The size, the depth, the angles are all purposefully thought out and ideal for efficient use of your fuel.  You should have a t-joint near the fan with a simple swivel valve that can be used to bleed off excess air.  (effectively, the same thing as your ash gate).  This is particularly true if you plan to use an AC blower."
Blacksmith,39h9xs,scnavi,5,Thu Jun 11 18:30:47 2015 UTC,Most states have a blacksmith society. Reach out to them and they might know people that have anvils for sale. Based on the reading I've done you'd want to find something over 100 pounds. Peddinghaus makes some nice anvils. Check out blacksmith depot for an idea. Buying used is a pretty good idea though. Also look at the resources on the right hand side of the page.
Blacksmith,39h9xs,Tomriver25003,2,Thu Jun 11 18:45:26 2015 UTC,This.  Also a membership to a local ABANA affiliate would make a great gift too.

Blacksmith,39h9xs,ColinDavies,2,Thu Jun 11 21:30:24 2015 UTC,"A few hundred dollars, probably no more than $500.00"
Blacksmith,39h9xs,ColinDavies,4,Thu Jun 11 23:45:49 2015 UTC,"In that case the only way to get a ""full size"" anvil of good quality is to buy a used/antique one.  $2/lb is about the lowest you can expect to pay for something in good condition.  There are better deals out there but they are few, not something to count on if you are under time pressure.  Anvilfire.com has lots of good information on anvils that you should read.  Look at their galleries as well to see what anvils of different makes look like, so you will be better able to identify damage.  Whatever you find you can always run it by us here to get opinions on whether it's worth buying."
Blacksmith,39h9xs,Crux1836,2,Fri Jun 12 00:01:25 2015 UTC,"I posted this on another thread a few weeks ago, but might be helpful here:  Try branching away from the online venues when searching for equipment and tools - there might be other options besides CL and eBay. Here in Georgia, the Department of Agriculture publishes the ""Farmers and Consumers Market Bulletin."" I found a single-line classified for ""anvils and blacksmith tools."" I called the number and met up with a 70-year old, crusty, weathered, salt-of-the-earth.... AMAZING blacksmith. I don't even think this guy owns a computer, much less would he advertise on Craigslist. I spent 4 hours at his shop looking at old tools, equipment, listening to stories, and even learning a few techniques like making a leaf spring for my post-vice. This guy has hundreds of tools (and probably a couple dozen anvils)."

Is this really the case, and if so, is there any hope on the horizon for better quality new anvils?  Note: I do not have a source for that, and I don't know how new anvils are made or compare to older ones, hence my question."
Blacksmith,39h9xs,staklininkas,1 point,Thu Jun 11 19:38:41 2015 UTC,"NIMBA's largest anvil sells for $5.7/lb which is a lot of money but in my mind well worth it, I like that it has both a square and round horn even if you do sometimes get them jammed into your leg."
Blacksmith,39h9xs,antchrist,1 point,Thu Jun 11 23:51:42 2015 UTC,"The reason they're low quality is they're made from cast iron. They don't have a hardened faceplate like a steel anvil would, so they get dents much easier and they don't draw as well."
Blacksmith,39i8n9,Hrunting1,3,Thu Jun 11 22:08:23 2015 UTC,"I completely, wholeheartedly agree. A trench is a really inefficient way to forge. And yet, it will work.  I think I'm having trouble sorting out what drives people to blacksmithing.  Some seem drawn to the simple, ancient nature of the craft, some want to make swords and knives, some want to dabble, some want to move in and stay! And all before they've even heated a single piece of metal!  I'd really love to see a dead simple ""10 buck"" trial forge / makeshift anvil / simple project that we could tout so people can get that initial feel.  And have a little more grounding to find the answers they're looking for."
Blacksmith,39i8n9,Canadianartichoke,1 point,Thu Jun 11 23:57:55 2015 UTC,"Many thanks for the reply! I wanted to get into blacksmithing because of my great grandfather who was a village smith here in the UK. Having no real previous knowledge of smithing I relish the challenge of learning so many new skills, however it's a bit daunting with so many options. I wanted to lay down some money on a good forge that can accomodate some later projects once I have learned the basics so I will take your advice and look at some firepots cheers, I also looked at a few propane forges, which are an option I'd not considered before. I have a reasonably sized garden, and a small shed. I was thinking of semi mobile setup I can move in and out of storage each day. I'm already married so it's definately not about the chicks, unless you count my wife rolling her eyes everytime she sees me attempting to move around an anvil."
Blacksmith,39i8n9,Fargraven,2,Fri Jun 12 02:25:21 2015 UTC,"In my experience, coal does burn significantly hotter but charcoal will work for forge welding. Is your forge inside or outside? Because judging temperature is different outside.   Also, you might have to play around with how much airflow you have, to get enough air, but not too much, so you can reach welding temperatures."
Blacksmith,39i8n9,Canadianartichoke,1 point,Fri Jun 12 04:21:33 2015 UTC,"I will be forging outside. I have a fair sized garden and a small shed. No garage though, so I will have to do it all in the open, I could probably build a makeshift shelter in time which could help with judging temp?"
Blacksmith,39i8n9,verdatum,2,Sat Jun 13 08:13:03 2015 UTC,"Honestly, the design of the forge isn't critical. Something to contain the fire and reflect heat (literally, a trench in the ground does it) a pipe with holes drilled in it and air flow through the pipe to the middle of the fuel.  This is why so soooo many designs abound!   Just try it with the simplest method you can to convince yourself and then you'll feel better able to judge what you see on the Internet.   EDIT:  heh.  Ok. Let me further explain myself - tone does not come across in text at all.  I'm attempting to be encouraging of the ""just try it! you'll enjoy it!"" approach rather than continue to look for ""the best, most efficient forge design"".   http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-bPViUc_FQCY/U53JDIL5bUI/AAAAAAAAGso/HmbiouLJmY0/s1600/DSC_0030.JPG  Here's an example of a master blacksmith - Thomas Latane - with the simplest of forges. A wood box with  a side-blast (air is blown onto charcoal from the side rather than from the bottom) air supply. The charcoal fire sits on a bed of ash (possibly a steel plate bottom in this box but they were just made with wood) and is contained by a stack of bricks. The air blows through a hole in a sheet metal backing plate. And here, they have a simple hood / chimney to draw the smoke away.  If your outside, the chimney isn't absolutely necessary (although I don't like working in smoke myself).   Charcoal forges work very well with side-blast air flow because they sit on a bed of ash - that way, the air doesn't disturb the insulating fire bed.  It's not all perfect though because the pipe for a side blast type forge is much closer to the heat therefore it degrade much faster.  But it can be very simple, largish diameter scrap steel pipe pieces / fittings. Just put in another when they fail.   A forge can be very simple, inexpensive and truly functional without being complex or expensive.   Thomas Latane uses a bottom-blast / side draft charcoal forge in his shop and what he can do... well... stunning is an understatement."

I'm an aesthetics guy so I'm going to comment on the hammer(?) mark in the middle of the bend, on the side. I would like to see that evened out or gone.  These things come with time and lots of practice, but a good guide helps immensely. I am interested in your bend technique and if a teacher would tell you to do it another way.   Have fun!"
Blacksmith,396q7x,JasonDinAlt,2,Tue Jun 9 19:02:39 2015 UTC,"I started out with some cold rolled steel. I don't have a forge per say so I used a rose bud on a oxy torch. I heated up the end and tried to hammer the cold rolled in to a square, Once I got it kind of square I needed to build up some material so when I bend the corner it would have a square edge and an inside radius. I did this by holding it on its end and hitting it to compress the metal. After that start the bend and try to square up the outside corner. That was the part that didn't go so well. Once it was bent I turned over the piece and used the peen to make a fishtail end. Finally after all of that I made the final bends to give it that nice curve.   Here is what it is suppose to look like and here is a WoodWright episode that gave me the inspiration."
Blacksmith,396q7x,FJ1906,1 point,Tue Jun 9 19:52:16 2015 UTC,"That's the right idea and it looks good. To try and square up the inside and outside corner try heating and isolating a section in the middle in f your stock. Then bend 90 and then upset from both ends into the 90 and smooth  and square out the corner as it grows.  Or, go for a bigger arc with a hold foot further out. Both will work as long as it has the right angle to wedge itself into the hardy or pritchel hole. Here are two good examples. Here is one that has a larger arc and here is one with a square corner."

Blacksmith,399a2r,biggreenfan,5,Wed Jun 10 04:29:56 2015 UTC,"Hit it with a ball pein hammer to deform it down and out so it has a greater diameter than the hole.   If you want a nice round rivet head on bothe sides, made a concave depression in a chunk of steel, set your rivet head in the depression, now hammer down the protruding material. Flip it over and give it a few taps in the die you made to planish the rivet.   Your done. Checkout YouTube for guides and so on, but that's the basic principal."

Blacksmith,399a2r,indyvet,4,Wed Jun 10 05:01:13 2015 UTC,If your stock is bending rather than 'rivet heading' you've probably got too much stock protruding when you perform your upsetting process.  Try to isolate a shorter section of stock and I think you'll have better results.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyUDOc8oF4o  Search on terms blacksmith and rivet for better youtube results.

Blacksmith,399a2r,staklininkas,2,Wed Jun 10 05:06:55 2015 UTC,"Depending on how long my rivet is, I have holes drilled in stock of different thicknesses. You just let the rivet stick a 1/4"" out of the top and hammer it round, then just pop it out"
Blacksmith,399a2r,ColinDavies,2,Wed Jun 10 12:19:12 2015 UTC,"Make sure it's a snug fit.  Leave no more than 1.5x the stock diameter sticking out, less if you continue to have trouble.  Using a lighter hammer will also tend to keep more of the deformation near the end of the pin.  If hitting it straight on is the issue you could use a set hammer (or substitute a piece of square bar) just for the first few hits to get it spreading evenly."
Blacksmith,399a2r,dontVoteBarack2016,2,Wed Jun 10 12:53:57 2015 UTC,"Here are five... no, wait... three tips for riveting: make a bucking tool (a bar with hemispherical depressions in all sizes of rivet head you might need to make), isolate the heat as much as possible (use water if you must to cool down excessively heated areas and don't feel like you aren't allowed to use a torch to heat the rivet rather than the forge), and if you continue to have problems, shorten the rivet shank."
Blacksmith,399a2r,killer122,1 point,Thu Jun 11 14:56:33 2015 UTC,"been doing cold riveting for years, hammer control is very important, essentailly you want to visualize a ring about half the size of the stock, and never hit within that ring, always landing blows on the outer ring of metal. never with heavy blows, just light taps to slightly deform the edge, doing this you slowly work your way around the rivet head to be, and as you work in little circles the edge will start to roll over and form the dome shape, once you have a decent dome you can start hammering down closer to center but never completely dead on, and you will end up with a beautiful dome rivet they you finished by hand. if its more than about 1/4 stock you will start to need to heat it up a bit, but even while still at a black heat it can still be hammered. but with tongs you actually want a squashed rivet to keep the tongs fairly tight. dome rivets are for non moving parts like knife handles. if you are trying for flush rivets just reverse the process, start hammering at the imaginary  inner ring and using a ball pein move slowly towards the center and the rivet will spread evenly and can be sanded flush after its snug. If a rivet lays over its one or both of 2 factors, either you had too much stock sticking out and/or you were hitting to hard, hit just hard enough to make the metal move a little bit, its not a race take your time.  good luck and have fun."
Blacksmith,397zza,ConstantComet,3,Tue Jun 9 22:31:31 2015 UTC,"You are on your way.  2"" pipe is way better and cheap.  Then make an adapter plate to line up with both the holes in the drum and the holes in the 2"" flange.  You can also either put your air source on a dimmer switch or use a ""butterfly valve"" to controll air better."
Blacksmith,397zza,Vanhugenstein,2,Tue Jun 9 23:34:13 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply. I'm worried that my blower won't be powerful enough to move air on a 2"" pipe.  I think I'd still run into problems with hole size. Would something like this work?"
Blacksmith,397zza,Vanhugenstein,2,Tue Jun 9 23:48:13 2015 UTC,"That is exactly what you want but you will want two inch for sure.  It will allow ash and small klinkers to fall through your twyre (what you are building).  It will also force you to create too much air pressure to get the volume of air you need.  Too much air speed/pressure will cool your fire and throw cinders.  A lot of folks use a hair dryer or shop vac exhaust.  A butterfly vent will help adjust your flow by opening and closing a hole in your air duct. Don't be too discouraged by ""more experienced"" folks below either.  You are trying to work with what you have and that is commendable.  Further, as you learn more and make mistakes/observations you will make many modifications to your personal forge to fit your needs. Your only goal here is to impart enough heat to your metal to make it soft enough to hammer into shape.  There are dozens of ways to do this and all are just as good for the beginner, until you start getting into more technical aspects of smithing.  Be patient, practice and have fun with it."
Blacksmith,397zza,ColinDavies,1 point,Wed Jun 10 11:22:14 2015 UTC,"A larger pipe is easier for air to travel through.  Your blower will move more air through a larger pipe.  It will be moving more slowly, but there will be more of it in total."
Blacksmith,397zza,verdatum,1 point,Wed Jun 10 14:09:28 2015 UTC,I see. I am not very well versed on even basic fluid dynamics and was under the impression that smaller would be better due to higher velocity of air. Thanks :)
Blacksmith,397zza,verdatum,1 point,Wed Jun 10 14:49:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, with solid fuel forges, velocity of the air is not important, in fact, it's less desireable.  You want to provide large amounts of oxygen to your coals so that the carbon and oxygen can react to generate heat & CO2.  If the oxygen is traveling fast, then it's either going to behave like a focused jet, or it will burn up all the nearby fuel, and escape your firepot before getting a chance to react with any surrounding fuel.  It's all about volume, and the way you get volume is nice big, unrestricted airflow.  On proper forges, a 3'' pipe is perfectly normal.  But 2'' is a good compromise because 3'' is pricey in black-iron pipe, and not normally sold at hardware stores in copper."
Blacksmith,397zza,Zazafraz13,1 point,Thu Jun 11 12:05:44 2015 UTC,"Is there any way I could adapt my 3/4 inch to a 2 or 3 inch,  or would I be better off with new piping?"
Blacksmith,397zza,verdatum,1 point,Thu Jun 11 19:25:57 2015 UTC,"doing so would defeat the purpose.  It would be like pinching off your garden hose almost all the way and wondering why the flow rate went down.  Assuming you aren't making use of the venturi effect (don't worry, you aren't), then it needs to be the widest diameter the entire length, or it might as well just be the narrower width.  Keep bends to a minimum and keep your pipe lengths short, those also contribute to reduced performance.  If you only want to adapt your pipe to fit the 3'' hole in the drum, then sure, you can buy off the shelf adapters in both copper and black iron to go from 3/4 to 3'', but it requires a whole bunch of adapters hooked together, and those costs really add up."
Blacksmith,397zza,antchrist,1 point,Thu Jun 11 19:48:08 2015 UTC,"I am currently using a brake drum forge like you. I solved the issue of the giant 2"" hole by covering it with a ""grate"" type of function. Originally I tried expanded metal, but quickly learned that the thinness of the material warped and eventually gave way. So for plan B I found a scrap piece of plate steel (roughly 2-3 mm thick) and drilled a series of small holes to allow airflow. It works perfectly and the holes restrict the air enough for decent pressure. I also have a vent at the bottom of my pipe that I can open or close to control air flow. I'll take a picture to post here sometime soon."
Blacksmith,397zza,icecoldcelt,2,Wed Jun 10 14:53:40 2015 UTC,"You can get by without proper tongs for a decent while. Just rig up your forge such that you can put 3' long bars in place without a risk of them tipping out of the break drum. Then you can just handle the bar from the cold side (quenching it sometimes after repeated heats)  Thinner stock cools faster than thicker, so particularly with around 3/8'' or thinner, it is important to have everything in place, and to know just how you are going to strike the thing.  pulling it out of the fire, looking at it for a moment, hunting for your hammer, walking more than 2 steps to your anvil, needing to change positions to use the anvil, this all wastes your time so that you only get a few strikes in before a reaheat is needed.  As you learned, concrete doesn't like high temperatures.  Rig something up with a hunk of steel plate instead.  Clay can be another possibility, but that needs to be left to dry and then fired slowly; and after, you've still gotta be gentle with it.  It is really worth the effort to get that anvil height issue fixed.  It means the difference between being able to forge all day and being able to forge for an hour before getting too sore.  Good luck!  Oh, and that beammeupscotty2 guy can come off a bit harsh sometimes, but he really does know his stuff.  His design advice on how to make an improved forge is super valuable info.  A raw brake drum forge is good for little else beyond heating up rivets. Properly modified, you can potentially get it to behave close to as good as a commercial forge setup."

No synthetics No folded up cuffs   If it's on jeans or canvas long enough to catch them on fire, it would have given you 3rd degree burns.   e: formatting  e2: Also, I have a scar on my neck from hot metal ""bouncing"" off my skin (burning through beard on the way) and plenty of unscathed pairs of pants that had red hot steel bounce off.

Also the 20 degree difference between the states where it burns or breaks is not really right either. Steel burns at about 1200-1300 degrees, white hot... looking at the steel when he twists it the steel is red to orange hot, approx 800-900 degrees, and does not delaminate. So, maybe the translation is wrong or he is referring to something else. The steel can be welded in much less temperatures than burning hot... It is a very good movie, and his skills are excellent. The result is very nice."

Blacksmith,398v1h,FJ1906,1 point,Thu Jun 11 13:02:44 2015 UTC,Are you taking Celsius or Fahrenheit?  Steel burns around 2500 degreed F. 1200-1300 would be a duller red. Most blades are brought to about 1500F before quench. Forge welding happens around 2200-2300 deg F. Once the welds are made and the smith starts forging the billet down to size starts it acts just like one piece of steel so twisting  is pretty safe.   Edit: looks like you are talking Celsius
Blacksmith,398v1h,Garlaug,1 point,Thu Jun 11 02:11:22 2015 UTC,Yepp. Celcius. Sorry about the confusion. But once thw welds stick the steel is a bit more forgiving. But still not 20 degrees celcius difference between make or break.
Blacksmith,398v1h,FJ1906,1 point,Thu Jun 11 13:02:13 2015 UTC,Yeah no problem. Once I looked at the conversion of the temps it made sense.
Blacksmith,398v1h,indyvet,6,Thu Jun 11 15:24:04 2015 UTC,"He may have a very wasteful way of producing billets.  In forging, there is an appreciable amount of material ""lost to scale.""  This means that by heating the metal to the point it can be worked, a portion of the material flakes off as it oxidizes (rusts).  There is another possible interpretation, and that is one of ""stock removal""  Fashioning a knife in this way, a large portion of the starting material is ground or filed away in order to produce, in most cases, a finished blade.  Between loss to scale and stock removal in the finishing of the blade, I could see how such a reduction in mass could be possible.  Edited/misspelling."

Not how to fix it - after all, that is the advice you're seeking - but you should be able to tell people very specifically what it is you don't like and want to change about your finished work.  Better, identify exactly what it was you did to cause the problem, or at least when it arose (during which operation/step of the whole process).  More generally, know what you want.

Blacksmith,3971ms,ColinDavies,2,Tue Jun 9 22:12:10 2015 UTC,"""Drop-forging"" is one of a set of modern processes that ended traditional blacksmithing.  You take a piece of metal stock, heat it up, lay it on a die, which is like a steel mold; and then a big heavy weight connected to another die crashes into the hot metal.  What might take a blacksmith many hours, many reheats, many many hammer blows, and many years of training, can take a drop forge operator less than a minute, in a single heat, with just a handful of blows, and only a couple weeks of on-the-job training.  Regardless, the end result is just about the same.  By moving the metal through forging, you get improved durability because you modify the grain structure of the metal to follow the shape of your product.  In the realm of bladed battle weapons, equipment failure is almost never the reason for a loss.  Steel weapons in the hands of a properly trained fighter, are not going to be pushed to their breaking point.  Likewise, if such a weapon broke from a fall or impact with a hard surface, then that weapon was made wrong.  bladed weapons benefit from being sharp, but it often isn't critical.  compare this to precision instruments; scalpels, carving chisles. razorblades...these are things that need to be sharp, but can stand to be brittle.  If you are interested in this sort of thing, look into the youtube channel ""skallagrim"".  He talks quite a bit about the difference between practical real world swordplay and similar fighting schools, and separates out a lot of the myths that get picked up from Hollywood, and things that are only true in the realm of non-leathal sparring.  As to your question, with a limitless budget, you could make a tool that drills through solid rock.  Look into oil drills and tunnel boring machines. They are some of the modern world's strongest stuff."

Blacksmith,3971ms,icecoldcelt,1 point,Tue Jun 9 20:49:37 2015 UTC,"Yes, of course? Hand forging allows for various degrees of hardening by selective cooling the metal.  There is always a trade off of Hardness vs Brittle.  To know the limits you'd want to ask a materials engineer not a blacksmith, it would depend on the metal, generally in steel this is related in large part to the carbon % in the steel.  Most well made hand forged weapons use tempering to give a very hard lead edge (to hold sharpness) with a softer back to keep from snapping when hitting something hard."
Blacksmith,396513,apophis-pegasus,7,Tue Jun 9 15:10:41 2015 UTC,"You can do that, given diameter is low, makes the steel brittle tho."
Blacksmith,396513,antchrist,5,Tue Jun 9 15:28:34 2015 UTC,"Oh, cool!"
Blacksmith,396513,icecoldcelt,1 point,Tue Jun 9 16:15:02 2015 UTC,How does it make it brittle? If you bring it up to the critical temperature all the effects of cold work go away.
Blacksmith,396513,OmniumRerum,1 point,Tue Jun 9 18:48:23 2015 UTC,But it gets brittle during working. You could break it then before annealing.
Blacksmith,396513,Vincent__Vega,1 point,Tue Jun 9 19:26:35 2015 UTC,Think about if you keep hammering on a red hot piece of metal after it's no longer red. It becomes too brittle and you could brake it.
Blacksmith,396513,icecoldcelt,1 point,Tue Jun 9 20:14:03 2015 UTC,"Sure, if you keep cold working it it will cause problems. If you never get it to the critical temperature, then you're not doing what was stated. The whole point is to get it to a critical temperature and keep it there. If you can get it from cold to red, you can keep it red. Then heat treatment is up to you."
Blacksmith,396513,blinbla,1 point,Tue Jun 9 20:40:17 2015 UTC,Getting to critical temperature does not mean that it didn't form cracks before yougot there...
Blacksmith,396513,ColinDavies,5,Thu Jun 11 05:52:54 2015 UTC,"Possible, just not very practical.  It takes so much deformation to get there, you must be making something much smaller than the starting stock size.  It's also very, very likely that you will introduce cracks in the material, even if they're not visible on the surface.  Something that is practical though is to work at a pace where you can keep metal hot during an operation.  So far I can only do this when forging square tapers.  I expect many smiths are capable of doing it with other operations, too.  You can also get a fair amount done on annealed steel without ever getting it red hot.  As long as you're not squishing in one direction then the other over and over (or bending back and forth over and over), the steel will take a lot of deformation before you start to crack it.  You just need tools that are hard enough."

Blacksmith,396513,Zazafraz13,3,Tue Jun 9 19:24:13 2015 UTC,"The hammer is a dogs-head style hammer, which is very common in Japan and with cutlers. The anvil is often called a sawyer's anvil. These were used for tensioning large (think in feet, not inches) circular saws for saw mills."

Blacksmith,396z2i,iamwoodman,3,Tue Jun 9 18:28:35 2015 UTC,"Only one way to find out...  You only need to heat up a section slightly bigger than your hammer, more is convenient, but not necessary"
Blacksmith,396z2i,blinbla,2,Tue Jun 9 20:28:40 2015 UTC,"No, but depending on what you want to do, 3mm is probably thin enough that you can beat it into shape without needing to heat it. Clamp it in a vice and hammer away. It'll get brittle if you work the same area for too long and might start to crack or tear, and doing anything delicate or artistic will be a challenge, but you should be able to produce a proof-of-concept piece. If it is stainless steel, or tool steel, or iron, you're probably out of luck. If it isn't steel at all your results will vary. Files and saws can be quite useful for shaping too."
Blacksmith,396z2i,denaissance,2,Tue Jun 9 20:38:25 2015 UTC,"not the whole piece but enough to hammer on. just heat the metal you want to move and hammer it, for a first attempt i highly recommend it, great learning experience."

Blacksmith,3922d9,siennamydog,5,Mon Jun 8 18:10:13 2015 UTC,"It's good that you are learning welding. I took a welding course before starting smithing, and it does help.  Oxy-Acetylene welding IMHO teaches you the most, because it is the most difficult to control and gives you a good idea what happens to steel when you push it past its limits.  You can conceivably build a forge out of clay, sand and straw or grass.  You can use low grade clay harvested from a riverbed if you like. Smiths didn't begin to use a cast iron firepot until they started to switch to forging with coal (instead of charcoal) in the late 17th century.  As far as an anvil, you can either harvest dead industrial equipment like forklift tines, large hydraulic rods, or bits of railroad track; or you can find a large, flat igneous rock like granite or basalt.  If you go with rock, be extra careful to wear safety glasses, because you never know when chunks will go flying.  Lump charcoal works best with clay type ovens, but you can use coal by first laying down a thick bed of ash.  This prevents things like clinker from sticking to the clay which needs to be chipped out.  For a blower, you can go electric, with a shop-vac, leaf-blower, bathroom exhaust fan. or you can build a blower.  The japanese style box bellows is one of the easier things to build. Look it up, anvilfire has instructions on building it.  The traditional great bellows is not impossible to build, and they do work very nicely, but it is a bit more unwieldy.  Don't bother building it with leather; too expensive, just go with moderately heavy canvas, and brush it down with a few layers of cheap latex or acrylic paint to make it air-tight.  Scraps of leather or rubber are good to use with the clapper valves in both cases.  Not having instruction is gonna make it a tough battle.  At the very least, invest in some of the more highly reviewed blacksmithing books.  Youtube alone just doesn't cut it yet, especially when you are scrounging.  Most people who try it on their own try to forge something cool, it doesn't work how they'd expect, and they either produce stuff that looks awful, or they get discouraged and move on to the next hobby."
Blacksmith,3922d9,verdatum,2,Mon Jun 8 20:47:14 2015 UTC,Our school has literal tons of free scrap from the welding class. I could see if I could gab a few tons. Or I could gut the boats abandoned on the beach.

If everything were set up right,  I can't see why you couldn't work sitting on a stool.  You pull the steel out of the forge,  turn ninety degrees,  put it on the anvil.  Hammer is right there, hit it until it is cool.  If you are going to stand,  think about how you want to pivot.  Good leg or bad? Put a drum full of sand best to you to lean on as you turn instead of a cane?"
Blacksmith,390v0c,RepeatOffenderp,3,Mon Jun 8 14:21:13 2015 UTC,"That's the idea I had in mind. I have to pivot on my left leg so If i set out a roughly circular space I could put the forge at one point, anvil and vises 90 degrees to my left, then the quenching tank another 90 degrees to the left. I can put the belt grinder and heat treat oven a small ways away because grinding and heat treating I'll likely do in separate sessions from forging. Probably on their own small bench with a seat. How far apart should the anvil, forge and quenching tank be? I imagine maybe half a meter to a meter apart from each other? that way I can grab a stool in the center and rotate to each station without a lot of stepping."

Blacksmith,391ppg,verdatum,1 point,Mon Jun 8 21:30:33 2015 UTC,"Not pretentious of you; I myself prefer 18th century blacksmithing.  And 18th century smithing is pretty darned close to everything back to around 10th century smithing.  If you check out a show called The Woodwright Shop on PBS, there is 1 episode each season where (Edit: forgot I mentioned it in another message) anyway, They do only 18th century smithing (well, he cheats and uses an electric blower, but it makes it easier to talk while stuff is heating).  Welding is still helpful; though perhaps not quite as much.  As you likely know, the only welding in existence prior to the mid 19th century was forge welding. And arc welding wasn't feasible until the early 20th.  But welding still does give you insight as to how steel heats, What happens when steel overheats and burns, how working with thicker steel differs from thinner steel, and mixing combinations thereof.  Further more, it's just soooo much easier in so many situations than proper forge welding.  Likewise, using an oxy-acetylene torch is often sooo much easier to get a lot of heat focused on a single spot; particularly when it is not on the end of the workpiece."
Blacksmith,391ppg,icecoldcelt,1 point,Mon Jun 8 21:48:22 2015 UTC,"I'd normally say to find your local blacksmithing guild and take a beginner class there. But honestly, it would be a much bigger help to you if you waited until you were closer to being able to start your own forge.  I waited a year before setting up my forge, and I was astounded at how much of my knowledge deteriorated, despite constantly watching smithing videos and discussing it, answering questions for the new people (which rarely get very in-depth regarding technique).  That said, by all means, find your local blacksmithing guild and try and attend meetings.  They usually include a few hours of open-forge time, during which point, someone should be happy to show you basics.  Watching the good blacksmithing videos helps.  But, when just starting out, it can be kinda hard to tell the difference between the good ones and the bad ones.  If you go to pbs.org and check out a show called The Woodwright's Shop, they have a blacksmithing episode every season, and have about 6 seasons available online.  Those are always good.  The Dirty Smith videos on Youtube are good....I know others are good, but they're what come to mind."

Blacksmith,391f4n,icecoldcelt,2,Tue Jun 9 10:39:59 2015 UTC,"Its certainly still a good anvil. To be sure I would rap it gently with a hammer across the whole surface. What your observing is the progression of the rebound. There should be less rebound at the tail and more towards the body of the anvil. Ideally at the center you should see a 75 to 85 percent return from the original height you dropped it at. The purpose of this test is to see if the hardened steel plate(aka the face of the anvil) is still fully adhered to the body. If you perceive say a 45 percent rebound at the center then the plate has begun to part. That isn't the end of the world but fixing that is way more involved then what it is worth.  Now as for finishing, I would clean all the paint off and any loose rust with a right angle grinder & wire brush. Be sure that you have safety glasses and a dust mask when you do this. Ascetically i like leaving the natural rusting as patina and its less work then totally cleaning it. I would then  apply a coat of boiled linseed oil, then wipe off all the excess with a rag. Remember that gloss is the enemy! Any excess linseed will take forever to cure and be sticky for days. Do this three time over, leaving some time for drying between coats. This will leave you with a nice dark brown anvil with a little shine to it.  As for the edges I would mostly leave well enough alone. Lightly grind and corners that have not been cracked and exclusively use those spots when your working. If you desire to fix the chips you need to take it to a, I cant emphasize this enough, good welder to weld hard facing rod to the edges to fill them in. A improper job will leave it worse then when it started out. Then dress the edges yourself when he is done. Best of luck with your project man, however you choose to go about it."

Blacksmith,38ysww,verdatum,5,Mon Jun 8 02:08:47 2015 UTC,"If you plan to try smithing with coal, then build a sheet-metal shelf around the lip of the drum. It's a simple step that has a massive effect on the smithing experience.  If you're gonna use lump charcoal, a shelf is still nice since it means you don't need to constantly shovel in more fuel, and it gives your workpieces a better place to balance and not tip out."
Blacksmith,38ysww,ConstantComet,1 point,Mon Jun 8 03:09:48 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice, hoping to get working on a stand for it next weekend."
Blacksmith,38ysww,verdatum,1 point,Mon Jun 8 03:17:41 2015 UTC,Can you elaborate on what you mean? I'm finishing up my brake drum forge today or tomorrow.
Blacksmith,38ysww,ConstantComet,1 point,Mon Jun 8 12:53:54 2015 UTC,"The proper term is a hearth.  It's where you keep extra fuel, and where you push coal up against the fire-pot (the brake-drum) so that it can cook into coke without cooling down the hot part of the fire.  It also gives a place for longer bars of metal to rest while the tip heats in the fire.  Without it, if you put a 3' long bar into a brake drum forge, it'll tip out sending hot metal and coals everywhere.  Using 3' bars is really nice because then you don't need to use tongs, which are just another distraction for the beginner smith.  Plus, most beginners don't have proper tongs, so they try to use pliers or vice grips which does not work.  The metal goes flying every time, generally in a scary random direction."
Blacksmith,38ysww,verdatum,1 point,Mon Jun 8 17:44:20 2015 UTC,That's a fantastic idea. Is it acceptable to only have a 180° (half circle) hearth? I want to be able to get close without getting burned.  I will hopefully have a picture soon and a working forge by tomorrow at latest.
Blacksmith,38ysww,Pixel_Pants,1 point,Mon Jun 8 20:14:50 2015 UTC,"You generally want at least some of the hearth to surround the brake drum, That way you can pack fuel around the sides as well.  Look at something like this.  This is a typical portable forge.  Imagine the indentation in this photo is your break drum.  Notice the upturned edges on the outside of the hearth, those walls help to keep coal from spilling over, and to rest irons against so they can be angled into the hot portion of the fire.  Having some shelfspace behind the hearth gives you a place to later add a hood and chimney stack, which even in an outdoor forge, is a really nice thing."
Blacksmith,38ysww,verdatum,3,Mon Jun 8 20:23:05 2015 UTC,"For the uninitiated, what are you going to use these for?"

Blacksmith,38ysww,verdatum,2,Mon Jun 8 03:06:44 2015 UTC,Fork Lift Tines are a pretty good substitute anvil.  Break drums and pipes are what you use to make a break-drum forge.
Blacksmith,38ysww,ColinDavies,2,Mon Jun 8 03:07:25 2015 UTC,Or even a brake drum forge.
Blacksmith,38yye4,kekron,3,Mon Jun 8 00:56:13 2015 UTC,"So the problem is that the heat can just run right out of that giant hole in the front. What you want is for the hot exhaust gasses to swirl around inside the forge. The biggest issues I see with your forge is the lack of a lip around the opening, the crevice at the edge of the shelf, and the angle of the burner.  This leads us to a few basics of thermodynamics and fluid mechanics. Most of it is pretty intuitive once you know a little about it. Fast flow allows better heat transfer from a fluid (exhaust gasses in your case). You might say that the spot where it is slowed down seems to be hotter, which is true. This is because in the areas where it changes direction the flow both spends more time in one place (cooling off the whole time) and the normal flow profile is disrupted. Flow through a pipe is always fastest at the middle of the pipe and is essentially standing still at the pipe wall. This isn't direct flow through a pipe, but if you think about where the exhaust ends up, you'll see that it comes out the ends of the ""pipe"". Flow through an orifice (like a lip on your forge body) increases pressure upstream from the orifice, which will keep the exhaust in the body longer as well as affect your burner performance. In this case it will more likely increase the speed of the gasses swirling in the forge, which pressure and speed have an inverse relationship in fluid flow lines.   A lip around the doors cause the flow to cross over the door instead of just going straight out of it. This can be accomplished with just a 2""-3"" lip sticking up past the insulation of the body. This lip will get very hot if you don't insulate it because all the flow will be redirected by it. You can do this by welding on a ring and adding a little more insulation.   The area at the edge of your shelf is taking your heat because the hot air is spending more time there. The best way to deal with this is to take a masonry cutting wheel in an angle grinder and mimic the curvature of the inside of your forge. This part is sort of self-explanatory.  The angle of the burner should be about tangential to the surface of the insulation. This way it's already going in the same direction of the wall, which will redirect it to swirl around the forge, evenly heating the whole thing. If you make these changes, there will likely be some pressure changes which will affect your burner. You saw the difference between running your burner in the open vs in the forge. That's because of the back pressure changing how the fuel and air mix. But it's worth adjusting them to get the forge running like you want it. The only other issue might be that there is too much room in the forge for the one burner to bring it all up to temperature. You can either increase the insulation thickness or add another burner. It's really up to what you need the forge to be able to do.   final edit: About your heat; It's hard to tell how hot metal is in the sunshine. A bright red can look almost black."
Blacksmith,38yye4,icecoldcelt,1 point,Mon Jun 8 15:27:19 2015 UTC,"So conceptually, by reducing the diameter of the front door the flow of exhaust gases is stalled ever so slightly while the gas tries to escape. While the gas spends more time in the forge chamber, it transfers more of its heat into the chamber. Interesting. I thought I was able to accomplish that by blocking the front door with firebricks and having a minimal sized rear door. Perhaps I didnt achieve the effect I was looking for."
Blacksmith,38yye4,icecoldcelt,1 point,Tue Jun 9 10:05:02 2015 UTC,"You got partially there, but a proper lip will go farther. Don't underestimate how much it leaks around the edges of what you put against the front. The more important part is getting the exhaust gas to swirl around the whole forge to get an even heat throughout the forge."
Blacksmith,38yye4,icecoldcelt,1 point,Tue Jun 9 10:15:35 2015 UTC,"Do you have any recommendations for the size of this lip? Would reducing the radius of the opening by 1"" be sufficient to start this swirl effect? Or should it be more? It seems that I can just weld on a ring to the front of the forge as a means of installing a lip, then insulate it up."
Blacksmith,38yye4,icecoldcelt,1 point,Wed Jun 10 11:52:08 2015 UTC,"Even 1 inch past the inside insulation will make a big difference, but the smaller the hole the better, but you have to be able to use it for the projects you plan on doing. I would probably go with a 2 inch lip for my own projects."
Blacksmith,38yye4,Machismo01,1 point,Wed Jun 10 13:25:44 2015 UTC,That seems fair. This weekend I'll see if I can scrounge up some metal to weld on to it and see how it works. I'll need to pick some more ITC-100 to stabilize the wool though. Not an issue.
Blacksmith,38yye4,verdatum,1 point,Thu Jun 11 00:29:20 2015 UTC,"Found some metal and did some welding. I think it works much better now, although I havent cranked the forge up to full power just yet. Thanks for the advice!  http://imgur.com/Ihu3xX7  https://youtu.be/I78JSFIcbHc"
Blacksmith,38zcu5,biggreenfan,3,Mon Jun 8 02:55:39 2015 UTC,"it is very different from charcoal.  I recommend you start by lighting a small charcoal fire, and then start packing your green coal around it.  After that, you stop the fire by pulling all your coals out of the fire pot and spread them apart. You will be left with chunks of coke, which you can then use to start the next fire, and get away from charcoal.  the big difference between charcoal and smithing coal is that smithing coal cokes up. in the process, tar leaches out and causes the coals to clump together as they turn into coke.  Using this property, you can create a bit of a domed oven that holds heat in extremely well.  In my opinion, one must spend dozens and dozens of hours smithing before you get particularly good at fire management. Until then, expect to be a bit wasteful in fuel, and occasionally burning your workpiece because you don't notice it overheating."
Blacksmith,38zcu5,verdatum,2,Mon Jun 8 03:19:47 2015 UTC,"Don't you wet your coal? I find that not wetting the coal leads to lots of smoke. I know it's not necessary to the coking process, but keeping the smoke at a minimum is a good thing for those of us without vent hoods."
Blacksmith,38zcu5,icecoldcelt,1 point,Mon Jun 8 04:02:56 2015 UTC,"I don't wet my coal from the start, but I do keep it out doors, so that might kinda be the same thing.  After the fact, i do wet my coal when the size of my fire starts to grow out of hand, but (keep in mind, I've still got plenty to learn) from fear of horror stories about cracking my fire pot, I only mist water onto the surface of my coals.  So far, it seems to be effective enough.  I don't know for a fact, but the perception I get is that as you learn to have better control of your fire, you need to wet your coal less and less.  As far as how much smoke is involved.  Smoke mostly goes away as the fire gets hot. And smoke is not nearly as much of a big deal when you've got a good chimney stack. I decided to invest in that pretty quickly after getting my outdoor forge set up because the smoke would hit me on the slightest change of the wind.  And given that I am using a hand-crank blower, I can't always just move upwind."
Blacksmith,38zcu5,verdatum,1 point,Mon Jun 8 07:46:04 2015 UTC,That pretty much accurately describes my recent experience switching over to coal.
Blacksmith,38zcu5,tulsavw,3,Mon Jun 8 03:52:15 2015 UTC,"Being the heathen I am, I use fire lighters, to my shame. I was using charcoal but after an extended BBQ I ran out and frankly don't want to shell out for another sack I have to make space to store.   Wood and paper work, just make use of your air source and keep a close eye on things."
Blacksmith,38zcu5,Brutorans,1 point,Mon Jun 8 10:53:22 2015 UTC,"To be fair, it does make starting your fire nice and braindead easy.  As long as you can get them nice and cheap, then, meh, why not."
Blacksmith,38zcu5,verdatum,3,Mon Jun 8 21:28:02 2015 UTC,"On fire control, a few things are going to happen that you'll have to actively manage.  The fire is going to get hollow over time.  As the coals in the middle get burned up, the hard banks of coke will take some encouragement to move in and fill up the empty space.  Some people like to have a designated area where they'll make coke to bring into the centre.  Others prefer to pull it in a little bit from all sides at once.  A poker or pointed fire rake is good for snagging and breaking up big chunks of coke.  Your fire will accumulate clinker below the hot spot.  If enough collects it can eventually cause problems with airflow and make your fire thinner than you think it is (not as much coke below your metal, so more oxygen gets through, so greater chance of burning your work).  When your fire is hot the clinker will be a gooey mass that you can feel if you poke around in the bottom.  If you let it cool a bit it solidifies into loose chunks that you can pick out more easily.  If you're having trouble identifying it then run your fire for a few hours until there's definitely a huge amount collected.  It will be pretty unmistakable when you shut down that fire.  Another thing that happens is the fire spreading wider than you want it to be.  This just wastes fuel.  You can control it by sprinkling water (sparingly) and by removing coke from around the edges and replacing it with coal.  The coal will turn to coke and choke off airflow through itself as it does so.  I think the very best way to control airflow (and therefore the spread of the fire) is to let solid banks of coke form and then do your best not to disrupt them.  Once the coke is broken up it will let the fire spread through it, and there's no way to reconsolidate it (hence remove and replace with coal).  Sometimes due to the shape of your work, the fire is going to get destroyed on every heat, and in that case you will only be able to use water to control it.  Beehive fires are fun, but not always the most practical.  This is the kind that's like a little cave or igloo with a solid roof of coke.  They're used especially for forge welding and tool dressing.  They take more work to maintain well for long working sessions.  It's easier to maintain a fire with loose coke in the middle surrounded by hard banks, and this will serve just as well for most work."
Blacksmith,38zcu5,ColinDavies,2,Mon Jun 8 12:53:15 2015 UTC,"*#@ bee hives, stick a 3/16 to 1/4 inch wall tube in there. Dimensions of which is up to you.  Its No hassle, easy access to the heart of the fire. Its great for tempering, hardening and annealing cause it disseminates heat evenly and its easy to monitor the color. You can heat many small work pieces without losing them as well. The only thing it isn't great for is forge welding.  ...excellent explanation btw."

Take a draw knife and make a bunch of wood shavings fill the donut. Pour damp green coal in a ring around the donut. Light the paper, when it just starts catching the shavings give it a wee bit of air. When the shavings are well caught, put a few pieces of coke on top of them, and then a few more until you start getting coal smoke.   It takes me about 5 minutes from clean fire pot to coal smoke. Occasionally I need to use propane torch to catch damp shavings. Hope that helps."

While I do make other knives using a variety of steel, a railroad spike works fine for this application and even has some benefits. Most of the spike knifes I sell are to the general public that has no idea what forging means and seeing the head of the spike helps tell the story with out any explanation , which leads to more interest and more sales.  That being said I do heat treat the blades and they hold an edge for the intended purpose, which someone already alluded to. This is more of a stabby stabby than a slicey slicey."

You might try hitting up some HVAC contractors in your area they usually just scrap them when they're done.  If it held something flammable, fill it up with water and cut it up with a zip disk on a handheld grinder.  As for the fuel/burner setup, do some reading about the Ron Reil burner https://www.abana.org/ronreil/design1.shtml and look at a bunch of pictures of the knock-offs and aftermarket burners to get some ideas.  For fuel, get yourself a red high flow LP regulator and put a tee with a gauge and a ball valve on the output side of it.  Get some braided SS hose to connect it to the (hot!) forge burner.  Don't try and be cheap and waste your time with a BBQ regulator or weed burner with a fixed pressure that won't flow enough fuel to get your forge up to temp.  You can search a lot of threads here and elsewhere of people trying (and failing) to be cheapasses and not getting enough temperature to do anything worthwhile with their forge."

Blacksmith,38xo0r,biggreenfan,0,Mon Jun 8 00:57:09 2015 UTC,"It's an anvil.  The fact that it is made from a railroad track doesn't change that.  Lots of people use them (including yours truly) and they work fine.  You may want to get something better eventually, but this will do for now.  As for cleaning it, you might want to take a grinder to it and clean up the edges and horn--round it out a bit better and such.  Otherwise, just use it as is."
Blacksmith,38xo0r,biggreenfan,1 point,Mon Jun 8 02:59:44 2015 UTC,Eventually is the plan but I'm just glad i finally have something to work with. As for the grinding I should stay away from the face of the anvil and focus mainly on the edges and horn or just grind the whole thing?
Blacksmith,38xo0r,Scuzzbag,1 point,Mon Jun 8 04:13:16 2015 UTC,"Don't grind the top. You can round off the edges, but don't mess with the surface."

Finish work was all done via files and we had a variety, hot rasping is actually very effective for cleaning up a piece."
Blacksmith,38wqf8,kwitcherbichen,5,Sun Jun 7 17:32:44 2015 UTC,"Think old school, really old, like 500 years old.  Luckily, you can go to your local home improvement store and get the following:   An ""engineer"" hammer or a ""blacksmith"" hammer large ball-peen hammer mill file large ""channel lock"" pliers Hacksaw and blades Sand paper leather gloves safety glasses   You'll need a forge. Hit a few yard sales. Improvise with a brake drum or other heavy iron bowl-shaped thing with a hole in it, some black pipe to make legs, line it with a sandy mix of Portland cement, a piece of metal dryer vent hose, and an old hair dryer (too much airflow, but you'll work it out). Get hardwood ""cowboy charcoal"" if you can't find coal.  You'll need an anvil. This is the one thing that it harder to get. Go to a scrap metal yard and pick up the heaviest steel you can lift/find/afford. It needs a couple of inches of flat surface and some way to anchor it. Scrap yards will sometimes torch cut what you want, even gouge a couple of holes or curves for feet. A 3-4 foot long chunk of rail road track on it's end will make a fine small anvil and just needs to be set in a big bucket of sand so it doesn't fall over."

Blacksmith,38wqf8,biggreenfan,2,Tue Jun 9 00:14:08 2015 UTC,"Most of the work you'd do with grinders can be done by a hacksaw, files, and sandpaper/emery.  You would still want to have these even if you eventually got a grinder.  It's harder to do without a drill press, but that is only a problem if you're making stuff that needs truly round and clean holes.  Punching, drifting, and filing should be ok for most things.  You could even use a brace and bit style drill.  A butcher's block brush is useful for removing scale, or you can use chemical treatments (just about any acid; phosphoric is especially good as it converts rust/scale to a somewhat protective coating)."
Blacksmith,38wqf8,verdatum,2,Sun Jun 7 14:42:20 2015 UTC,Check eBay for Rail Road anvils.  They are often listed and work well for a beginner on a shoestring budget.

Blacksmith,38x8g8,EldritchFire,2,Sun Jun 7 16:50:36 2015 UTC,Wrought iron with steel face.  Someone might be able to guess a date range or manufacturer based on the lack of a step; I can't.  Both edges have had chipping repaired by welding.  You won't know until you use it whether the repair was done well.  Chances are they will be prone to further damage.  On the plus side you could do your own repairs there with a clean conscience.
Blacksmith,38x8g8,ColinDavies,2,Sun Jun 7 23:17:44 2015 UTC,"Definitely wrought iron. Here is a similar one a few posts down http://www.abana.org/resources/discus/messages/5/385.html?1419076749 Could very possibly be a VERY old anvil! If you can inspect it before buying it, bring a hammer and tap the edges where it may have been repaired. Watch for any dents you make because that will show it was a horrible repair.

Blacksmith,38v2qo,-Auel-,7,Sun Jun 7 02:03:49 2015 UTC,"I think what you have there is a ""high"" carbon steel railroad spike.  Don't get your hopes up, though. ""High"" is only in relative terms. It's something between 0.2 and 0.3 percent carbon.  Here's your information: http://www.bladesmithsforum.com/index.php?showtopic=10292"

Blacksmith,38v2qo,thatonemikeguy,1 point,Sun Jun 7 03:22:47 2015 UTC,"Here is what I know about the subject.  Normally a High carbon spike has HC marked on it. Some spikes have CU on it, meaning they added copper to make it malleable. Other letters on the spike usually indicate a certain manufacture/brand. Alot of the time these markings are obliterated when they are driven. So you may have a high carbon spike, you may not. If it is the case you have a high carbon spike, you should know that it may be more akin to a medium carbon steel rather then high. The railroad industry has a slightly different standard regarding carbon content designations."
Blacksmith,38v42x,augris,3,Sun Jun 7 02:15:54 2015 UTC,You can probably hit much harder than you need to.  Metal's not impressed by how strong you are - work at a sustainable pace with a weight of hammer you can control.
Blacksmith,38v42x,ColinDavies,3,Sun Jun 7 12:30:56 2015 UTC,"Welp I would highly suggest you take a beginner class. Having a tutor over your shoulder to instantly correct for developing bad habits is invaluable. The experience you gain in a beginner class provides a clean solid foundation to begin growing your skills as a smith. I personally recommend The New England School o Metalwork but they don't have beginner courses any time soon. Here is one I found in Peters Vally that is coming up soon. Its a beautiful place and would make for a nice trip.   As for something I wish I heard before I started. Don't buy a new anvil. Your going to miss ALOT with you hammer while you are learning, and you do NOT want to lament that every time you go to work on it years down the road."

Never up, always down, because what you make is shit and he shouldn't have to pay that much for it. He will also spend an inordinate amount of time pointing out every flaw he can find in the hope you will budge. They will normally never buy anything.  The third kind gives you false hope, they will briefly look over everything and do one of two things. They will either tell you that they'll be ""Right back I need to get some money"" or they'll take a business card and will totally commission something. What to know what normally happens? They never come back and they never call.  You'll then have the 50-70 year old guys who knew Real Blacksmiths and that what you're doing is all wrong because their grandfather was super hot shit that was a master blacksmith from Austria and worked for royalty.

This redditor who may or may not know what he's talking about says:   Finally why the television show got the forging of the two swords from Ice wrong. So this is really a small detail as doesn’t actually detract from the show, but it is something that bugged me a little bit when I noticed. Do you remember how they shape the two swords? They completely melt Ice down. In the real world what this would do is completely reverse any and all work you had done to give your metal desirable properties. [...] What they should have done is snapped the sword diagonally in two. You can shape the metal while it is red hot without changing the properties too much, though if you get it too hot you will degrade the quality you tried so hard to get. I believe this is why only a few blacksmiths in the world are capable of re-forging Valyrian steel (can’t remember the direct quote). If it was as simple as just melting down why couldn’t any skilled blacksmith do it?"

So it was molten and cast originally, but it has already been forged before it even gets to us.  If you work with bloomery iron or steel, that stuff has not been molten at all.

Blacksmith,38tx68,augris,1 point,Sun Jun 7 00:44:09 2015 UTC,It was based off of damascus steel
Blacksmith,38tx68,BrannistheMannis,1 point,Sun Jun 7 02:01:13 2015 UTC,"Damascus steel:       Damascus steel was a type of steel used in Indian and Middle Eastern swordmaking, originally based on wootz steel, a steel developed in South India before the Common Era. These swords are characterized by distinctive patterns of banding and mottling reminiscent of flowing water. Such blades were reputed to be tough, resistant to shattering and capable of being honed to a sharp, resilient edge.   The original method of producing Damascus steel is not known. Because of differences in raw materials and manufacturing techniques, modern attempts to duplicate the metal have not been entirely successful. Despite this, several individuals in modern times have claimed that they have rediscovered the methods by which the original Damascus steel was produced.    The reputation and history of Damascus steel has given rise to many legends, such as the ability to cut through a rifle barrel or to cut a hair falling across the blade.  A research team in Germany published a report in 2006 revealing nanowires and carbon nanotubes in a blade forged from Damascus steel.  This finding was covered by National Geographic  and the New York Times.  Although certain types of modern steel outperform these swords, chemical reactions in the production process made the blades extraordinary for their time, as damascus steel was superplastic and very hard at the same time. During the smelting process to obtain Wootz steel ingots, woody biomass and leaves are known to have been used as carburizing additives along with certain specific types of iron rich in microalloying elements. These ingots would then be further forged and worked into Damascus steel blades, and research now shows that carbon nanotubes can be derived from plant fibers,  suggesting how the nanotubes were formed in the steel. Some experts expect to discover such nanotubes in more relics as they are analyzed more closely.
