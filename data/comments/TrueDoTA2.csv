TrueDoTA2,3e4oup,xStratosphere,12,Tue Jul 21 22:53:15 2015 UTC,"Winter Wyvern is absolutely the best support in the game right now, hands down, you've pointed it out yourself!  Other supports to look out for: As great position 4's we have Silencer who is CRUSHING with aggressive heroes like Tusk, easy INT to steal and easy gold to snowball and quickly transition into a semi-carry! Visage is also great if you know how to play him well, rat and DPS for days. Chen and Enigma are ideal junglers in an ideal scenario, one is better at pushing and good at teamfighting while the other is GREAT at teamfighting and a beast at farming! Earthshaker is probably the second best support in the game after WW, brings so much utility and damage to a fight and he flat-out wins them with good Echo Slams. Just needs to farm a Blink Dagger and voila. Shadow Shaman is awesome as well, give him Arcanes and a fast level 6, take a tower and start snowballing from there! Provides excellent lockdown as well.   Position 5's that you should consider playing: Abaddon as a selfless support that can do a lot of work and saving with just brown boots. Severely punishes tower-diving and has a sweet debuff spell. Omniknight has a similar function, only he is slightly worse in the laning stage and is very item-dependant (strange for a pos. 5), but if he gets Arcanes, Soul Ring and Blink, he becomes a monster! Dazzle is good at everything and doesn't need a lot of money to function well. Just give the hero some XP, dammit! Lion and Vengeful Spirit have been discussed to oblivion, I feel, but they are SO GOOD at taking out a single target with little to their names, oh my! Crystal Maiden is one of the popular ones, provides a sweet aura, some lockdown and nice damage. Witch Doctor is pretty much a hybrid between 4/5 position as he needs some farm and levels to operate at an optimal level but can do just fine without them as well, his spells are just so good.   These are the best support heroes in my opinion. Really fun to play!"

TrueDoTA2,3e4oup,viking977,3,Wed Jul 22 03:25:59 2015 UTC,"Absolutely, if used properly. You don't want to pick her if they only have 1 melee hero or a bunch of nukers but against your average meta team right now WW is insanely good both defensively and offensively."
TrueDoTA2,3e4oup,Shod_Kuribo,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:46:09 2015 UTC,Best support in the game though?
TrueDoTA2,3e4oup,viking977,3,Wed Jul 22 03:52:44 2015 UTC,Yes
TrueDoTA2,3e4oup,Shod_Kuribo,2,Wed Jul 22 04:00:32 2015 UTC,"What other support would you put over her atm? Top 3 for me atm is ww, shaker, and dazzle. Wyvern can heal (a la dazzle), provide a huge team fight ulti (like shaker or dazzle), has massive slows and a percent based dot. All in all combines parts of what makes other supports good"
TrueDoTA2,3e4oup,akhamis98,1 point,Wed Jul 22 06:23:34 2015 UTC,"You can easily make an argument for it. Strong harass spell, insanely powerful nuke, heal/protect spell which synergises with glimmer cape to almost make someone invulnerable and a bkb piercing aoe disable. All of her spells are long range and she doesn't have any issues with cast points."
TrueDoTA2,3e4oup,TrenchLordKaede,1 point,Wed Jul 22 09:04:54 2015 UTC,Why is there no love for Rubick? I think he's the hero with the highest skill cap and is amazing with good stolen spells.

Also picking Zeus means not playing against Bloodcyka+Zeus.. and invites a Bloodcyka to your team which mean win.  For something slightly different, both KoTL and Ench/Chen are REALLY strong this patch if you have the skills or team co-ordination."
TrueDoTA2,3e4oup,greenhatman99,2,Tue Jul 21 23:13:53 2015 UTC,I would like to add that Winter Wyvern is also a good pick up against a heavy physical DPS team

TrueDoTA2,3e4oup,Shod_Kuribo,2,Wed Jul 22 03:47:08 2015 UTC,"WW is obviously #1 but time and time again Lion sees play and for good reason. His hex and stun let you keep an enemy disabled for 6.5 seconds while your cores burst them down. His downside is that he absolutely cannot fend for himself, which WW can by encasing herself while waiting for help or hitting the enemy with her powerful q."
TrueDoTA2,3e4oup,Gaston44,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:36:46 2015 UTC,"Lion is just the archtype of support that will never go out of style. He has a stun that can hit multiple targets, a strong hex, dosn't need much more than tranq boots to sustain and his ult is always relevant."
TrueDoTA2,3e4oup,evilskul,1 point,Wed Jul 22 08:02:02 2015 UTC,Lion has gone out of style multiple times. He got a tonne of base damage as a buff that put him into top tier. Prior to that Lion was a situational pick against certain heroes.
TrueDoTA2,3e4oup,TrenchLordKaede,1 point,Wed Jul 22 09:06:09 2015 UTC,"I'd say Earth Spirit is still pretty broken, he's just not played enough because he's so intimidating to play. Also Omniknight and CM have been my most recent favorite. I love Omniknight but he has no Lane presence. You get ags on him and that changes the game drastically, add Oct-core and refresher and that's gg for them. He's also so good for base racing because his ags fortifys structures. Just my two cents."
TrueDoTA2,3e4oup,Aiden6,-1,Wed Jul 22 07:39:31 2015 UTC,"Oracle is really good, has been for a while now. Only issue with Oracle is that you kind of need to know the damage type of your allies and how heroes will generally engage on someone, if you can't communicate with people. I find that he is probably the best support in the game for just outplaying people, getting kills, kiting, and just getting the absolute most out of your cores."
TrueDoTA2,3e4oup,somethingToDoWithMe,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:53:11 2015 UTC,"I don't know why you're being downvoted. Oracle may not be a good support for pubs, but in a coordinated environment, Oracle has the potential to be insanely good."
TrueDoTA2,3e4l0i,FusionX,11,Tue Jul 21 22:24:32 2015 UTC,"A couple suggestions.   Play super safe and leech XP. If their support are camping mid then your offlane and/or safelane should be winning hard! When they eventually rotate to deal with failing lanes you should have the levels to start catching up on farm. In 6.84 meta playing a mid without some ability to ""flash farm"" or jungle recovery is ill advised.  Act like you are now the offlaner - don't feed and try get a core item off a gank or teamfight If the lane is TOTALLY lost (which sometimes happens against Tiny+IO or something equally filthy) just give up mid super early and jungle like a snail - because it is better than feeding and at least you get SOMETHING."
TrueDoTA2,3e4l0i,greenhatman99,2,Tue Jul 21 22:39:03 2015 UTC,"To add to this; when you are leaching XP concentrate on map awareness and communication. Tell other lanes when supports are missing. Check other lanes, as soon as those roaming supports show up there you can get some farm again.   Buy your own wards if your supports can't/won't. Place them selfishly so you can see where these rotations are coming from.  When you see them missing/moving towards you spam your mana to get last hits and bottle crow. Some farm is better than none and the enemy supports will most likely be camping the rune spawn. Also pushes wave out so they can't dive as easily.  Then go jungle. If you can't jungle try killing another lane. Even if you don't get a kill you can force them back. If you are a hero who can't farm jungle or gank effectively (yet) stack a few camps."
TrueDoTA2,3e4l0i,XyfDota,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:05:30 2015 UTC,"I like all of these suggestions and I would like to emphasize that not dying is key. They are losing out if they do not kill you, but if they do kill you, they've won. Offlaners know they are in trouble when they are solo, but a midlaner might be more stubborn and cocky about it."
TrueDoTA2,3e4l0i,loveisdead,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:20:05 2015 UTC,"One of their lanes is going to be consistently weak, so your teammates need to push out that lane and be aggressive toward their enemy hero if they've got a 2nd (or 3rd) hero constantly camping mid. The mistake is not necessarily dying a few times mid with the other team constantly ganking you, it's letting them do it for free."
TrueDoTA2,3e4l0i,prezuiwf,2,Tue Jul 21 22:32:32 2015 UTC,"what happens when you don't have the proper heroes to punish another lane? (this happens more often than not)  example: a tanky or elusive carry is just chilling behind his tower and we got some simple single target dudes who can't dive, we just wasting time around top lane while they're taking objectives"
TrueDoTA2,3e4l0i,zakglee,2,Tue Jul 21 22:41:02 2015 UTC,"Also, most of the times, at least in my mmr (3.4k), my side lanes fail to take advantage of this situation. I still get blamed for not ganking or having bad items after 10/15 minutes."

TrueDoTA2,3e4l0i,Ishmael_KingOfTheSea,2,Wed Jul 22 02:35:28 2015 UTC,"It's because the higher your MMR, the more people expect from you. Like, I expect a 5k player to be as good as Purge or SingSing at something. So if I see them not doing their roles ""jobs"" it's frustrating, while I expect very little from someone who is sub 2k.   I think a lot of people in the ""average"" MMR range of 2.5k-4k expect everyone to play as well as they think they do at all times and ignore the situations in game that would make problems. Since 80% of players believe that their MMR is not a proper reflection of their skills, they automatically assume their teammates are what is holding them back and not because they are not taking advantage of the enemy team's strategy.   At lower MMR's, players either don't understand the game or have shitty mechanic skills and just kind of play for fun, I guess. Imagine those people in TF2 who kind of derp around all game, but still manage to win a round or two. They don't really get mad or flame other people, but they don't realize that they are holding their team back.  The best way to fight it is just to ignore how shitty your teammates are and play better yourself as either a support or high-impact mid hero to make your team win."
TrueDoTA2,3e4l0i,subraizada3_,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:52:57 2015 UTC,"players either don't understand the game or have shitty mechanic skills and just kind of play for fun   I don't have good mechanics but I understand the game well and I play for improvement, not fun (from what I've read on /r/learndota2 my theoretical knowledge of the game is at a 3-4k level). Just from my experiences in team/all chat in game, people down there usually don't expect much from you if you get rekt in lane or if you're a farming/pushing mid (except maybe some farmers that can also fight a bit mid game like OD), and I've almost never received flame as a safelane carry or occasionally as a mid for not ganking or something like that (obviously there are people who flame you for literally everything you do, I'm not including those people in that statement).   The best way to fight it is just to ignore how shitty your teammates are and play better yourself as either a support or high-impact mid hero to make your team win.   I was just pointing out an observation I made, and I don't really think that my 'true MMR' is higher than what it's at or that I always get bad players on my team or anything like that."

It sounds like you are worried waaaay to much about what your teammates are doing. If you are solo-queing, to win you simply need to be better than your opponents. Because your opponent mid has to deal with similar things all the time."

TrueDoTA2,3e4qg1,Nikitoo,5,Tue Jul 21 23:05:40 2015 UTC,Probably scrolling down a little upon this subreddit would help.  This was posted just yesterday and can probably help you out a little more with what you want. The answer by /u/nbwk especially.
TrueDoTA2,3e4qg1,FallenDrifter,-1,Tue Jul 21 23:23:19 2015 UTC,"There's a ton of build that work, but I generally dislike euls builds because they require 2 items that don't really hero your fighting when your ult is down.  I like builds that include mek into staty items. SF has a bit of a timing. He goes late, but isn't the best late game carry. He really peaks around the 11-13 area, so building items like aquila, mek, skadi, and eventually butterfly leads towards ending the game through objectives rather than purely relying on farm or pickoffs."
TrueDoTA2,3e36tg,Avvulous,4,Tue Jul 21 16:38:15 2015 UTC,"This may be a dumb question, but why get ult at 6? It seems like you would get much more utility out of a maxed combo at 8. The first point in grow doesn't offer that much alone. I don't play tiny much so maybe I'm missing something.   Edit: Wow just realized that Grow boosts Toss damage as well. Ignore everything I said."
TrueDoTA2,3e36tg,Ronikan,20,Tue Jul 21 16:52:41 2015 UTC,"Your edit is correct, but from a pure nuke perspective the ult isnt worth leveling. However it aids last hitting, adds an ""auto attack nuke"" to your combo, and if I remember correctly gives movement speed as well. So ultimately it provides more damage and utility"
TrueDoTA2,3e36tg,barnufus,6,Tue Jul 21 17:00:17 2015 UTC,"the movespeed, damage, etc. are ridiculously good, the boost to toss damage isn't huge, but being able to get two 100+dmg rightclicks in during your combo will do more than a level in either toss or avalanche."
TrueDoTA2,3e36tg,XyfDota,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:36:00 2015 UTC,"While I agree you should get ultimate at 6 the majority of the time it's not as simple as ""always get it"".  You may want to leave it unskilled so you can last hit more easily with the higher attack speed (also take that into account when you talk about right click dps in an engagement). You may want the additional level of Toss for harassment. Against a melee you may be able to get the double damage Avalanche which will increase your nuking power more than Grow.   IMO the only universal build is you should have 3-4-0-1 at 8 as Avalanche damage isn't linear, the last level stinks. I went into more detail and numbers in a post a while ago. Search ""Tiny Vilko"" in true dota and it should come up. I'm on my phone so I can't link it."
TrueDoTA2,3e36tg,Dat_Speed,1 point,Wed Jul 22 05:44:51 2015 UTC,"Did you actually test this or just calculated from the numbers -25%? In the game, I find I can kill almost all non-str hero at lvls 8-11 with blink and avalanche+toss combo with 1-2 hits if I am mid. At lvl 8 I can kill 850 hp hero easy, and at level 11 I can kill 950 hp easy.  Did you consider the bonus damage from avalanche+toss? I know they reduced it slightly from dota 1, but if you do them separately you get less damage than if you do them together. And did you include 1 normal hit?"
TrueDoTA2,3e36tg,twersx,2,Tue Jul 21 19:47:49 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty certain he included the bonus damage from doing the combo correctly;at level 9 that works out to 300*2 from avalanche and 300*1.35 from toss which works out to ~1005 damage. After magic resistance that's ~750 damage, you need to do a right click or two to bring it up to the 900 he's saying you should expect."

TrueDoTA2,3e422l,PepperJohn,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:18:19 2015 UTC,What about a Zeus or QoP? The Spell steal would be pretty good on them.
TrueDoTA2,3e422l,Gaston44,4,Tue Jul 21 20:23:35 2015 UTC,The spell steal is not great on QoP because they are AoE spells and as Rubick you want to be single target mcgee in the beginning. The blink can help but only as the game has progressed a lot and you are making clutch plays. Against Zeus Rubick is amazing because of his gank and ult.
TrueDoTA2,3e422l,thundrfang,3,Tue Jul 21 20:26:50 2015 UTC,"The spell steal is good, but you would get destroyed in lane. You might as well play a support at that point."

Max fade bolt, obviously. I chose mobility over stats, but that's just me. Force or blink is what I normally go first. Treads is nice if I decide I can't get a bloodstone fast enough.   There are so many items you can go on core Rubick. Just depends on the game.   There are some games where Rubick just isn't a good pick. Definitely when they have strong spells to steal, obviously. But sometimes they have less spells and more auto attacks. I hate playing Rubick in those games because of how low his hp pool is.   Aghs is awesome, but only if it's a game with lots of spells with high impact.   I love the hero, he's my favorite. And you can make him work. Especially at 2k."
TrueDoTA2,3e422l,Mathyoujames,-1,Wed Jul 22 06:01:19 2015 UTC,He shouldn't? At 2k the situation where your Rubick pick actually adds anything to the team that say a lina or lesh wouldn't do better will never come up

TrueDoTA2,3e422l,Gaston44,0,Tue Jul 21 23:59:18 2015 UTC,Bloodstone is good on all int spellcasters but how are you going to get that much farm?
TrueDoTA2,3e422l,Gaston44,2,Wed Jul 22 02:38:43 2015 UTC,By making things happen around the map. By nuke farming with fade bolt. By doing what other pos 3/4 mid heroes do.
TrueDoTA2,3e0zes,wildtarget13,14,Tue Jul 21 03:02:40 2015 UTC,"That's expensive dude. The counters to Huskar are disables and DoTs. Heaven's Halberd being the best thing for it.

TrueDoTA2,3e0zes,Forty-Bot,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:10:36 2015 UTC,"IMO blademail is only scary if you can force Huskar to fight you while it's up, like if you're a Bristleback or Wraith King or something. Otherwise Huskar can just ignore you, move onto his next target, and come back for you once the Blademail duration is over.   But yes, blademail + enough HP to use it effectively + threat of physical damage = very sad huskar"
TrueDoTA2,3e0zes,cerealkillr,3,Tue Jul 21 14:14:37 2015 UTC,You just save it for when he life reals you.  Activate it during his jump travel time and he doesn't have the luxury of canceling it.  It will deal like 50 to 60% of his life and if he follows up you will win the fight.
TrueDoTA2,3e0zes,Drop_,0,Tue Jul 21 14:35:01 2015 UTC,so don't jump a target with blademail? Usually you save it to gapclose or purge not to initiate.   And if he jumps you with full hp he'll be fine - the whole point of the hero is to be an unkillable DPS machine when at low HP.   It's a good counter to most pubstomp Huskars but a highly skilled player can play around Blademail.
TrueDoTA2,3e0zes,cerealkillr,2,Tue Jul 21 15:02:10 2015 UTC,So basically you're saying by buying the item he can't ever target you again?  Seems like a good choice.  A huskar that can't lifebreak you can't kill you.    And a huskar lifebreaking you from full hp if you have blademail ready WILL die.  He can't follow up on the lifebreak because he will be low enough that continuing to attack while blademail is up means he will die before you do.  And sitting there not attacking means either you can disengage or he dies from your attacks.    Blademail destroys huskar and forces him into a BKB which is more expensive and doesn't really synergize with his skillset.
TrueDoTA2,3e0zes,Drop_,0,Tue Jul 21 15:10:44 2015 UTC,"can't ever target you again   No I didn't say that but thanks for asking. It means you wait until they pop their blademail, or you jump someone else, or you only use spears. Unless you have a way to force Huskar to fight you during the duration of Blademail, he can simply disengage. Like many many other matchups in dota, it depends on the skill of the players and their positioning and the rest of their team. Yes, in a pure 1v1 scenario Huskar probably loses against a Blademailed carry. Good thing Dota is 5v5.    can't lifebreak, can't kill   That's just not true at all. He has crazy dps when he's low HP with armlet on. But it depends on the matchup I guess.    WILL die   No, it depends. How much health does the enemy have? Is it more than Huskar's? Is it more than Huskar's plus the extra 500 from the Armlet that he will turn on after the jump? Is it more than Huskar's plus his healing from his Q plus his lifesteal off of 200+ physical damage? Does Huskar have Aegis? Because if he's smart he took Roshan as soon as he had Armlet and Helm. What about damage done by teammates? Again, it's down to the players.    doesn't synergize   Huskar's role is unkillable DPS machine/tank. BKB stops him from being stunned, which means he can always keep attacking (and lifestealing) when he is being focused. The only real problem with buying BKB is that it delays AC and Satanic. And that is a problem, don't get me wrong, but having to buy BKB is not the end of the world for Huskar.   edit: All in all, Huskar is a situational pick that can utterly dominate certain games and enemy lineups. Pick him into the wrong heroes and you've lost. Pick him into the right heroes and you'd be hard pressed to lose. So if you're against a hero that can buy Blademail and manfight Huskar, that's your fault because you shouldn't have picked him in the first place. Huskar games are won in the draft more than in the execution."
TrueDoTA2,3e0zes,cerealkillr,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:48:01 2015 UTC,Blade mail returns same type now    Source? Wiki explicitly states its pure damage and I haven't seen anything in the patch notes about that. Sure seemed to be pure damage in my games last night too.

TrueDoTA2,3e0zes,Drop_,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:12:25 2015 UTC,"DoTs are NOT a counter especially once he has Helm. He can just lifesteal through them or use his Q to negate them. No magical DoT does more damage than his Q will heal when reduced by 98%. They can prevent toggles but not much else.   Necro Aura can be a bitch, but the rest of his kit is lackluster at best against Huskar."
TrueDoTA2,3e0zes,cerealkillr,3,Tue Jul 21 14:30:31 2015 UTC,blademail is the best counter. Lotus orb is shit against him.
TrueDoTA2,3e0zes,SavageRS,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:00:00 2015 UTC,That's a really bad counter.  Better ones are Euls or blade mail.  You can easily dodge the lifebreak damage with self Euls or if you have manfight potential you can activate blade mail while he is leaping to give yourself a huge advantage against him.
TrueDoTA2,3e0zes,Drop_,-1,Tue Jul 21 16:09:49 2015 UTC,"Lmao that is actually the worst counter to huskar, its not even a counter at all.    usually armor is a good way to deal with huskar   ?!?!?!?! Because his main dmg output is completely physical?!  Huskar is not even built around his ulti, its by far his worst skill, I just take it once at 6 and leave it and if you by some reason buy aghs on huskar then you really should re-read the hero's skillset.  It's like saying lotus orb is good vs leshrac because armor helps and you can return his lighting storm spam back to him.   Glimmer cape is the best defensive item to deal with huskar."
TrueDoTA2,3dza0u,Bobmuffins,23,Mon Jul 20 19:10:24 2015 UTC,"It's not reasonable and it's bad idea. If the enemy team is any good you'll probably lose that game.   And it's not problem that they're gonna punish you. If you engage in ""farming war"" you're probably gonna lose, because there will always be one lane that's unavailable, and there just isn't enough farm for everybody. Plenty of time I've played carry in this scenario and I ended up wasting lot's of time simply because I can't find farm. Not because the enemy covers the map, but because all of our lanes are in place where I can get ganked easily and jungle is easily cleared out.  To simply put it, when you have 4 farm hungry heroes who all get medium amount of farm, it's like no one is getting farmed, because enemy carry(and mid) will always have more space to farm and they will outfarm you, and the rest of their team will still be usefull in teamifights since supports don't need that much to be effective anyway."
TrueDoTA2,3dza0u,bravo_six,2,Mon Jul 20 19:53:03 2015 UTC,"This isn't true at all. Look at current EG. Aui often manages to become a fourth core, sometimes even more farmed than the other cores, because ppd is a hard 5 position while Aui looks for farm where he can on heroes like Naga and Lina."
TrueDoTA2,3dza0u,thundrfang,5,Tue Jul 21 14:04:33 2015 UTC,"This isn't true at all. Look at current EG.   Please don't compare the game strategies of EG with what pubs can do. The reason it works for EG is because they are able to communicate and work perfectly as a team. They not only employ teamspeak to constantly communicate with each other and anticipate the map movements of all 10 heroes in the game, they have also been playing together and learning each other's rotation styles (both for farming, ganks, and wards).  In pubs it is pretty much certain that 4 cores will occasionally step on each other's toes to get farm leading to inefficiencies. Hell, this even happens to me in pubs with only 2 cores sometimes. Beyond that Aui is a late-game transition to a ""core"", not one that starts at minute 0 like OP is proposing."

TrueDoTA2,3dza0u,bravo_six,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:47:00 2015 UTC,"I agree with you and I would take it a step further and say that 4 cores tends to be more successful in pubs than it is in pro play.    It's a bit of a gamble, but most pubs can't end it early which gives the 4 cores enough time to come online.  As long as it's not 4 carries, (i.e. one of the cores is something like Tidehunter) it can work out really well and in some cases is easier to execute than a traditional 2 support setup, because less rides on stomping in the laning phase, coordinating smoke ganks on mid, or fully zoning out the enemy offlane."
TrueDoTA2,3dza0u,Drop_,18,Tue Jul 21 19:00:48 2015 UTC,"As a visage player, he is a really bad solo support since he needs xp and gold."
TrueDoTA2,3dza0u,ChocolateSunrise,5,Mon Jul 20 21:56:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Visage is pretty greedy as far as supports go, especially in terms of levels."
TrueDoTA2,3dza0u,VindictiveRakk,6,Mon Jul 20 22:11:44 2015 UTC,This is pretty common when you have a jungler. When you play against a good team they are not going to let you farm all of the lanes for enough time to get all four of your cores fat. It is a greedy lineup and the enemy team should punish you for it. You may win teamfights late but you will probably lose them early and your cores will get ganked while farming.
TrueDoTA2,3dza0u,ffiarpg,3,Mon Jul 20 19:37:07 2015 UTC,"There's not enough space on the map, unless you have invaded the enemy jungle. 1 core like naga or tinker can take up all three lanes and both jungles for example. A normal core takes about half of that.   If you look at some examples of this, the best/most recent being EG during TI4 versus DM where they pulled out Ursa+Enchantress supports. It required Universe buying support items as the offlaner. And then Universe's six slot looked like blink+force w/ bigger items.   You need to work in an item independent support and space creator like puck, brewmaster or other "" I only need blink or else"" sort of core to start doing things and have them either buy a late Midas or focus on ending and taking objectives."
TrueDoTA2,3dza0u,wildtarget13,3,Tue Jul 21 01:33:59 2015 UTC,No. Two strongly farmed cores can easily take out 4 underfarmed cores.
TrueDoTA2,3dza0u,vraGG_,3,Tue Jul 21 13:58:20 2015 UTC,"Sorry that I am not going to answer the question, but instead argue that the game is too situation dependent to say yes or no.  A better question is, what situations make having a jungling 4 very beneficial? What do you think? We can talk about it better if you talk about when and why you choose a jungling 4 and a solo support."
TrueDoTA2,3dza0u,mjjdota,2,Tue Jul 21 15:15:49 2015 UTC,"You have to factor in that another support instead of a jungler means more lane pressure, which means your cores get more farm and enemy cores get less. I would say the opposite is true, having 2 supports will generally lead to better outcomes than 1 support and a jungler. There are situations where a jungler would be beneficial however, such as if you are facing very defensive lanes and you don't need the additional lane pressure so you can just outgreed them in the jungle."
TrueDoTA2,3dza0u,Skyro620,2,Mon Jul 20 22:20:13 2015 UTC,EG does this all the time but their farm priority for cores constantly change. See how PPD always has nothing for items so that he can get his team going but it's extremely unfun if your cores are horrible.
TrueDoTA2,3dza0u,forkkind,2,Tue Jul 21 03:51:40 2015 UTC,"long story short, you can't make space as a solo support for 4 people. and there isn't enough space for 4 people anyway, as mentioned.  you might be able to zone the solo offlane. but zoning, stacking and ganking mid all at once alone is just impossible ;)  however on low mmr the first 10 minutes there are pretty much no rotations anyway so you might get away with it"
TrueDoTA2,3dza0u,Elux91,3,Tue Jul 21 10:50:04 2015 UTC,"In a competitive sense, the only real time where such a lineup is valid is using a Bounty Hunter (as a secondary 3 position). This gives the team a gold boost to be able to run 4 cores, and takes some economic pressure off of the solo support.   Another variant is the 3 core + 1 high farming support + 1 dirt poor support. This is essentially a failsafe - the 4 position has the scalability of a core, but can also function at low economy if required - a KOTL for example.   In pubs, 4 cores + 1 support is fine. I highly disagree with a lot of the comments here, I'll try to adress their main concerns... Firstly though I'm not saying it is the absolute best, I'm just saying its OK at worst, and preferable in many games.   There just isn't enough farm for 4 cores on the map.   Obviously 4 cores will mean slightly less farm for each. In pubs however, players have such poor efficiency that there is always farm 'going to waste'. If you have 4 cores, you are able to farm half the map with ease. You also find they specialise - one will farm jungle, one will farm dangerous creeps, one will ancients, etc.    For example - early game you can put a core on each lane, and a hard farming Enigma in the jungle. Sure the offlaner has a bit more trouble, but overall you are making use of the map. Later, enigma can transition to ancients and/or Roshan and/or deep lane pushing, while the 3 cores have 3 lanes and jungle. Overall, there is more farm being taken, despite it being a bit overlapped.  4 medium farmed heroes being worse than 2-3 highly farmed heroes   Again, I see this as categorically OK. The number of cores being viable is simply a product of the metagame. 3 core has been popular for years, and the economy of the game has been scaled up to where there is now plenty of gold for 4 itemised cores.    I'm not trying to say which is more viable in the meta. I'm just saying that 3 core vs 4 core is absolutely not solved, and to say 1 is always or generally preferable to the other is just wrong.   For example, ESL Frankfurt games often had networth graphs like this. For team Secret, this was the case nearly every game - a very conscious decision to have 4 similiarly farmed heroes.   Another support instead of a jungler means more lane pressure   Sometimes this is true. I know if I want to play a farming Chen for example - where I want the earliest Mek or key item possible - I will still gank. A clean first blood is worth more than the minute of farming, even with investing a smoke.    The threat of a jungler is worth some lane pressure, and if the enemy mid / offlaner doesn't respect that, they can be abused for more gold.   Likewise, farming and then ganking has benefits over early pressure. 2 supports will not be able to continually shut down some lanes, but a jungle Axe farming a blink will give later opportunities, rather than early opportunities. These opportunities may lead to a quick tier 1 tower, and further snowballing. It doesn't matter that he didn't pressure another lane early - if he sat zoning the offlaner, his blink would be very delayed, and the game would just be different."
TrueDoTA2,3dza0u,situLight,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:17:43 2015 UTC,"This is essentially a failsafe - the 4 position has the scalability of a core, but can also function at low economy if required - a KOTL for example.   Can you post a list of heroes suitable for a position like this?  Or describe the traits they need?"
TrueDoTA2,3dza0u,INSANITY_RAPIST,2,Tue Jul 21 05:06:57 2015 UTC,"So these are heroes that are planned as being 'high 4 position' - where maybe they buy a set of wards at the start, but leave everything else to the 5 position.   So imagine running a support Antimage, as a '4' in a safe trilane. He buys a quelling blade and boots, does pull rotations for the first 15 minutes, and gets a naked battlefury. On paper this is fantastic - you could have had a Faceless Void farming a Battlefury on the lane at the same time - now you have 2 cores with a Battlefury.   But if the lane doesn't go as planned - the Antimage has a Perserverence and Boots at 15 minutes  - and the other team has taken all the outer towers. Antimage as a 4 (played in this way) does nothing with low economy - he requires the full farm to be an effective 4 position.  This is a 4 without a failsafe - he is only effective with huge farm relative to his position.   A support with a failsafe - lets say a support Tusk. He could do the same, get huge off pulls and/or ganks - and run around with a ShadowBlade Desolator at 30 minutes. He effectively becomes a 3 position core, it doesn't matter that he began as a support.   But unlike the Antimage, Tusk has huge utility with Boots and a bracer - that is his 'failsafe'. If the game goes poorly, he can follow up with a Glimmer, a Blink, a forcestaff. With these items he remains relevant, as they compliment his skillset.   Generally these heroes have at least 2 of the following, as a sort of general guideline   A very good or very reliable stun Excessive nukes Excessive slows Excessive utility Little / no item requirements Some ability to flash farm Exceptional Scaling, or huge 'Breakpoints'    Nyx is a good example. He can run around with dagon 5 solo killing anyone on the map. But if the game goes absolute awful, he is still effectively guaranteed an aoe stun from his invis, either in a teamfight or as an initiating ganker.   By Exceptional Scaling, or huge 'Breakpoints' - a Sven for example gets huge damage from just a few strength points. Breakpoints are for heroes that go from zero to hero, so to speak - a Sand King with blink, Magnus with blink, Tinker BoT. Naga Radiance is another good example.     Traditional Heroes in this high 4 role   Sven, Alchemist, Tusk, Phoenix, Pudge, Tidehunter, Spirit Breaker, Undying Mirana, Naga Siren, Bounty Hunter, Meepo, Nyx Lina, Natures Prophet, KOTL, Silencer, Enchantress, Enigma, Visage   Some newer, more experimental heroes in this role are...   Gyrocopter (either build), Night Stalker (gem + Ags rush), Morphling (stun build), Weaver (Ags utility), Kunka (utlity), Beastmaster, Treant (midas Ags Octarine ulti spam)   This isn't a complete list. For example you could get a midas on Disruptor, and rush an Ags + Refresher and be an absolute monster. But those builds tend to commit you very hard, and reduces your impact heavilly while farming. The heroes I listed generally are quite harmonious in their farming, it doesn't commit them down a 'hard-carry' path."
TrueDoTA2,3dza0u,situLight,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:03:34 2015 UTC,"if you manage to commit a mid, offlane, jungle and safelane that's fine, but you have more cores than lanes, so one is limited to the jungle the whole game, it's viable with early-midgame mids, utility junglers. but something like clockwerk offlane, storm spirit mid, doom jungle, skywrath lane support with a void/spectre/medusa is a nice team setup, but is easily punishable with the right plays."

TrueDoTA2,3dzxgp,Shod_Kuribo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:46:02 2015 UTC,"So the more I use solar crest/medallion on heroes that need early game mana, the more I love it. I have been playing more and more Clinkz, but currently have Weaver as my top hero and feel this applies to him also. The build I've been experimenting with goes as follows, and works (later boots) because both heroes have built in movement speed increases:  Starting items: two branches, circlet, ring of protection, tangos  buy two sage's masks and a wand ASAP. From there, build the Ring of Basilius into an Aquila, and then the remaining sage's mask into your medallion. Throw in boots wherever you feel comfortable, then, bam! You should be set for mana between clinkz and weaver, and also have items that provide much needed tank, mana, damage, and even pushing potential with aquila's armor aura and medallion's active.  Too often I find I am taking too much time building an expensive mana item when it is most critical during early game, then tapers off as time goes on. Rushing these two items help to ensure your ganking potential, escape mechanisms, damage output and tanking mechanisms. I suggest other people to try it"
TrueDoTA2,3dzxgp,Too_Much_Overtime,9,Tue Jul 21 14:32:18 2015 UTC,"Another advantage is that late game you can disassemble it to get the Talisman of Evasion for a Butterfly.

TrueDoTA2,3dzxgp,luis1972,4,Mon Jul 20 22:01:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think Aquila may be too many early game items. You need to hit your timing with the soul ring/deso build.

TrueDoTA2,3dzxgp,RampagingRagE,2,Tue Jul 21 00:32:33 2015 UTC,"My only thought on the matter is that there are delicate timings on Clinkz.  Going medallion means you pretty much have to skip aquila - which is still valuable in the laning stage -, maybe you can get a basilius early and disassemble it to get a medallion. Then you get a desolator (or a diffusal), and at that point most games you need a bkb.  If you just go sc you risk delaying your bkb by a significative amount of times, that can cost you a lot.

TrueDoTA2,3dyaip,codeferret,5,Mon Jul 20 15:48:18 2015 UTC,"That is basically Meepo's whole gig. The clones aren't summons or weird illusions with triggers. They are actually a whole team of heroes that all die when one dies. So all spells treat them as heroes. The only exceptions coming to mind are Flesh Heap and Silencer's Intelligence Stealing (and apparently Atrophy Aura on a quick check).  Track also works on every Meepo.  Track all 5 Meepos before the kill and that is 5 Track payouts.  Other than Thirst, Track, Echo Slam, and the Octarine Core I'm drawing a blank on any spells that terribly abuse poor Meepo.  Honestly the Thirst thing might get changed at some point. The new Thirst was probably added without thinking about how Meepo basically makes Bloodseeker an unstoppable force all game.  Same with Octarine Core.  The key buyers of OC are casters like Necrophos and Leshrac that start to spell vamp a ton of health from hitting an extra four heroes."

TrueDoTA2,3dyaip,codeferret,-3,Mon Jul 20 18:58:24 2015 UTC,"Meepo also is due for a rework to upgrade to a more DotA2 standard, and less a hodge podge of broken WC3 engine mechanics.  Unlike in WC3, Meepo could just be reworked to do something like:  Drop Geostrike  United We Stand becomes a regular ability that functions differently than now. Still makes the same copies, but instead of having a dumb stat copy thing, just make all of the clones exactly identical to the Meepo Prime as a baseline. Same stats, same movespeed, same armor and resistances. Same.  Let all clones be able to use the prime's Active items, but they all share the CDs.  Rebalance the stats of Meepo to account for this. Heck you could just do a Windranger thing and make all fancy effects just work less as part of the ability (IE a Daedalus causes all Meepos to do smaller baby crits).  New Ult: Spells suck on Meepo. Great Passive. Just makes all enemy (possibly and ally?) sourced incoming and outgoing effects just work less on Meepos.  People understand a blanket effect. If you just make dmg's less or durations or whatever. Thirst has less benefit off Meepo targets. Track pays out less.  Cool side effects would be things like Leech Seed heal less.  I'm not mathing it at the moment, but a 5/10/15 percent reduction could be really strong/really weak depending on the spell. Weak versus straight damage, much stronger against say DoTs (by lowering damage and duration) or things like Leech Seed, Brain Sap, Lifedrain (by lowering the damage and the heal component as well).  I mean, such an ult is complicated to code by comparison, but lets face it. Valve runs the whole client now. They can program whatever they want to have cool things like Spells Suck on Meepo.  TL:DR;  Meepo really needs to be upgraded to not have weird ass mechanics around him like Thundergod's Wrath only hitting Prime, or Thirst making BS really strong."
TrueDoTA2,3dyaip,codeferret,2,Mon Jul 20 22:36:58 2015 UTC,"I think that since his last nerf Meepo is a really good hero, I don't see why you would like to change anything about him.

TrueDoTA2,3dyaip,dustyuncle,0,Mon Jul 20 23:12:51 2015 UTC,"Because I feel Valve most likely will. Damage types were change not because of balance, but because it was convoluted. The same with Magic Resistance and Spell Immunity.  Mute, Break, and certain spells randomly not affecting Ancients were the latest of these (which played into Brewmaster Primal Split a lot).  They are eventually going to get to Meepo because he is a large bucket of exceptions that have no logical reasoning.  How is a Zeus to know his Thundergod's Wrath only affects Meepo Prime? Or Undying's Decay only affecting one Meepo.  Track can trigger all 5 times, but Flesh Heap won't?  Just because it is balanced doesn't excuse the fact its full of exceptions that lack a rational basis.  You can't look at standalone in game and interpret these actions without trial and error.  All spells are tagged with whether or not they pierce spell immunity. They are going to eventually tag spells with ""Only effects Meepo Prime"" or change Meepo.  Valve is interested in making their game more accessible and easy to balance by removing the insane number of one offs (Doom pre-Break for instance). Meepo is going to end up being part of that eventually.  TL:DR; Meepo doesn't need nerfs or buffs. Not the argument. Valve is systematically removing one offs with no rational basis.  Meepo has several of those."

TrueDoTA2,3dzbwd,wildtarget13,3,Tue Jul 21 02:11:36 2015 UTC,"As a few people have mentioned, almost anybody with a stun pairs up well - but in most cases, they'd pair up just as well with a Lion (for example).  Often even better because Lion's stun does damage.  If you're looking for a hero specifically to combo with Rubick then you want someone that can take advantage of the long duration and re-positioning elements to do something - you're pretty much looking for heroes that have a harder time landing their stuns early (usually because of lack of movement speed), or where they have a positioning element.  For that, you can look at:  Slardar - aoe stun, has to get next to somebody to hit it  Centaur - same, null aura also combos with double edge later in the game  Alchemist - much easier to land a long-duration stun if you can guarantee they're going to land behind you  Mirana - takes more co-ordination, but you can drop them where the arrow will be  Techies - Drop them onto a stasis trap, follow up with mine/suicide  Windrunner - Move them out of the creepwave for a tree shackle  Pudge - Same, but for hook  Ancient Apparition - Guarantee a longer duration in the Cold Feet radius  Jakiro - Drop them into Ice Path  Not all of them are good combos, but there's some decently workable ones in there.  If you're working together as a two, Alchemist is probably a pretty good one - the lift should pretty much guarantee you a full duration stun and a fair bit of time in acid spray for early ganks in lane.  Later on Alchemist can gift Rubick the aghs buff - that can completely change the game if it's a fairly early pickup, and leaves Rubick free to focus on getting blink & a quick luxury item (maybe sheepstick)."

Rubick is incredibly inefficient with mana first of all, and as for burst, Fade Bolt doesn't really do much.

Anti-mage is an example; battlefury with an optional vlads into manta style is  the correct build 99.99% of the time on Anti-mage.  That being said, don't get into the mind set of ""best build"", especially on a hero as flexible as Shadowfiend. Go into the game ready to adapt to the situation. Some of the many avenues you can take are:   Does your team need a mek and no one else can carry it? Get a mek. Do you need insta-kill potentional against squishy heroes? Get blink + euls. Do you need raw damage and have people who will be focused before you? Get desolator into daedelus. Do you need to go trade blows with another hard hitting carry? Get dominator, skadi, then satanic.   You fit the build to the game, not the game to the build."

After that sheep or other support items are more valuable than additional DPS items like buriza because their carry potential DPS will be much greater than your potential DPS.

TrueDoTA2,3dw3ib,MA-kkd,4,Mon Jul 20 00:44:52 2015 UTC,I play a lot of TA and far prefer phase on her. The speed and no-collision is worth a lot more than attack speed on her IMO. With a blink and good farm you should be blowing up supports in 2-3 hits anyway - it's more about a quick burst and positioning than prolonged right click battles with her whilst phase help you chase them down. They also help you get runes and farm jungle etc.
TrueDoTA2,3dw3ib,Thefelix01,3,Mon Jul 20 09:20:06 2015 UTC,"I get Phase not because of the extra damage but for the extra speed when chasing someone I just slowed with my R skill. Not sure if that's what you meant by farming using skills or not, but there it is."

I prefer treads in matchups which are rather hard to win, they have better utility with tread switching + bottle and (as you said) attack speed is nice.  With items in general, there are lots of different styles of TA. I do think blink into deso is the strongest atm because of the recent buffs, but you can also look into Zenoth's safelane Deso rush and Sneyking-esque Treads -> Drums -> Manta. Also you don't have to build crit after deso, I usually only buy it then when I need it to (or it will let me) continue 1/2 shotting supports. Otherwise look at BKB, manta, AC etc.."

TrueDoTA2,3dw3ib,PigDog4,2,Mon Jul 20 18:29:08 2015 UTC,"not farm better, but its better for the dps together with other items. For example: phase and deso is about 20-30dps less than powertreads and deso. Sure, its not much. But while behind you take any dps increase you can"
TrueDoTA2,3dw3ib,zajfy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:41:12 2015 UTC,"Phase lets you chase, though. And since the vast majority of TA's damage comes from the refraction -> blink -> meld -> punch combo, I'm not sure if sustained damage output is the way to go.  I used to play treads drum yasha right-click TA back in like 6.79 or 6.80 or something, but that build hasn't worked for me in a long time. I think the strongest way to play the hero is still to blink in and blow someone up. I also really like phase in lane because you can move in and out to harass with the splash a little bit better.  I have a bit of trouble playing TA from behind, but I would still never be able to get treads because I always get phase while laning and then finish my blink by clearing my ancient stack I built while laning.  I think if you're so behind by minute 5 you change your boot choice, you have bigger problems than just getting slightly outfarmed."
TrueDoTA2,3dw3ib,PigDog4,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:20:18 2015 UTC,"So youve never had the enemy supports sitting on your face constantly from min 1? im not saying that its 50/50 between phase and powertreads. Im saying that if you are behind, no matter how, you should go powertreads, as you will survive longer in fights and have better dps. And if you are behind, your ability to chase is most often not the biggest concern."
TrueDoTA2,3dw3ib,zajfy,0,Mon Jul 20 20:23:05 2015 UTC,"Hrm, interesting. I think I might still rather go phase/drum instead of treads. It's more expensive, but I feel if you're resigning yourself to treads, you're probably not going to get a blink any time soon.  Definitely less than ideal, but I guess if you have 3 people camping your lane, you have to make some sacrifices so your other two lanes win huge."
TrueDoTA2,3dw3ib,PigDog4,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:38:05 2015 UTC,"they are more efficient dps output for a hero who has a tonne of damage but no built in attack speed boost. Treads are almost always better on TA when it comes to raw dps output. Phase has the edge in most games because they let you dominate the lane even more, they let you chase better and they generally let you move around faster."
TrueDoTA2,3dvdeb,itaShadd,8,Sun Jul 19 21:00:07 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure I can answer question 1 fully, but don't pick her against heavy magical/pure nuke lineups as she's rather squishy to non physical attacks. Pick battlefury in two situations, when you need aoe (example vs chaos knight). Or when the enemy can't stop you from split pushing a lane (imagine you're antimage). Otherwise the other item options at that point in the game are helm of the dominator for obvious reasons. Or maybe go for vlads if the enemy are mostly low armor heros as you can build into desolator.

TrueDoTA2,3dvdeb,Shardj,0,Tue Jul 21 12:57:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah flash farming is very important and not understood by a lot of low level players, as well as manta split pushing etc. I feel like that PA doesn't need a battlefury ever anymore while AM almost always does, so the heroes do have a bit of a different dynamic."
TrueDoTA2,3dvdeb,Gaston44,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:16:06 2015 UTC,"I don't agree with that really, anti mage is one of the more basic flash farmers to play, mana is way less of an issue (compared to naga, SF or even terrorblade), you don't have to manage multiple units, you don't really have to cast any spells aside from blink. I'm ~2.5k and an anti mage that doesn't go battlefury and split push/farm is a rarity for me. Arguably they aren't very good at it and I'd agree there, but the vast majority of AM players understand what to do with him. I can only ever remember playing AM this way, and I feel like I've seen maybe 2 AMs at most go something like vlads first.  I realise people at my skill level even when they are BF flash farming will rarely break 10-12 cs/minute by the game end, but most of the AMs I see do go for battle fury and they use it to farm."

TrueDoTA2,3dvdeb,Shardj,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:57:34 2015 UTC,"it works just fine because everybody else is even worse at farming. If a 2k anti mage is struggling to break 10 last hits a minute, he's still probably getting 5 times as much farm as the rest of the people in his bracket, he's still pushing the waves and threatening tower trades/rax trades, etc.  yeah they would be completely useless if you stuck them in a 5k game but they are playing against people who barely break 30 cs at 10 minutes then spend most of their time moving around the map without hitting creeps."

TrueDoTA2,3dvdeb,Shardj,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:24:37 2015 UTC,Also don't forget that am relies on supports in the early game to get going. It's pretty easy to harass am out of farming if your support doesn't know how to zone effectively. This is another factor of why you see lower mmr AMs not doing as well as they could.

Disclaimer: I'm not dendi   I disagree about not picking her vs magic or int lineups. I mean what you mention is 100% right about int heroes possibly shutting her down early. In my experiences playing PA though int heavy lineups are something that can be played around often ending in your advantage.  Int heroes are strong early vs PA but if you just dagger last-hit you are relatively safe in lane vs even the best int harassers like sky and silencer. Silencer isnt that difficult to play against as PA anyway because he almost never gets MKB and his main source of damage has to get past your evasion. Zeus can be problematic but even Zeus' time to shine vs PA can be mitigated through good wards and map awareness.  The big point im getting to though is i have found i almost prefer PA vs int lineups. Reason being is they are almost all squishy and rarely armor up, almost never get evasion so all of your blink hits will land, and once you get BKB heroes like zeus or silencer or skywrath are a very easy kill.  TLDR: Most magic heroes will fear PA if she survives long enough to get BKB.  [EDIT]   Also for what its worth i usually go phase>aquilla>BF>BKB>basher>?.  MKB instead of basher if i need it, but after basher i usually start building toward satanic. Generally something i like to do, is build an offensive item then a defensive item then offensive and so on.  If you find engagements are happening quickly and you dont have enough blinks in teamfights, that can be where attack speed is the better option. But i dont usually play PA as a manfighter, usually i play her like slark and weave in and out of battle getting pickoffs on anyone who overextends, only going ham when i have bkb up.  Avoid sniper, viper, veno, beastmaster, razor."
TrueDoTA2,3dvdeb,UtterlyFullOfShit,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:20:40 2015 UTC,"I think you misunderstand my point about nuke lineups, pa is weak to them before bkb and if she has bad laning (which is unlikely thanks to dagger) pa will struggle to come back. Against all int/nuke lineups she actually shines (as do a lot of heros) as all you need to do is build a bkb. If the enemy has heros like lina and qop with their pure nukes then picking pa would be a terrible idea, the same goes for if the enemy has outworld devourer as an example.  Why did you list veno out of interest? Also sniper isn't really a counter unless you reach late game, early-mid game pa if far far stronger than he is and actually counters him thanks to her mobility."
TrueDoTA2,3dvdeb,Shardj,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:26:33 2015 UTC,I think veno is awful because A) obscene amounts of magic damage and B) you can't get rid of venomous gale even with BKB so if he gales you you will struggle to fight.

TrueDoTA2,3dvdeb,Shardj,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:07:11 2015 UTC,"I just tested it and no, becoming magic immune does not purge any of venomancer's abilities. It will stop the damage over time component but the abilities will last their full duration and if magic immunity runs out before the debuffs do, they will carry on ticking. The slow from gale lingers through magic immunity as does the slow from poison sting. Gale can't be applied to magic immune targets (although both sting and nova can) but it isn't purged by magic immunity.  As for killing him in 2 seconds, sure, but his abilities take 0 seconds to cast. if you use bkb and jump on him then everything's peachy. If you jump on someone else or he catches you with gale before you bkb, then you can't win that fight."

TrueDoTA2,3dvdeb,Shardj,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:05:50 2015 UTC,Battlefury is useful for more than just cleaving in teamfigts. If you expect to be able to make use of cleave in fights (not shit Magnus should hit at least some good rps) why not also make use of it to farm faster and derive advantages that way. Furthermore the raw damage alone is nothing to scoff at. Taking your logic to the extreme Magnus can already give me bubbles so why bother building damage at all. Skadi first item?

They're forced to deal with your evasion or pick up a very expensive item they don't want. This is heroes like Antimage, Lifestealer, Huskar, Sven, Kunkka, DK - you get the idea. Heroes where MKB doesn't make sense as a second or third item.   Also pick her against ranged carries like Sniper or Drow who hate hate hate it when someone blinks on them and gets up in their face.   You want to avoid heroes who can stun or nuke you down - and silences are actually really bad for you too since you'll rely on dagger and Blink to fight.   Special mention to Razor for being able to steal your damage and slow/nuke/purge you twice when you attempt your dagger and blink combo."
TrueDoTA2,3dvdeb,cerealkillr,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:56:38 2015 UTC,"Are you insane? MKB is amazing on lifestealer and huskar, its not bad on dk ether, kunkka deals most of his damage through cleave or q/r. The only hero you listed there which I would consider part of the really doesnt want mkb list is Sven. Also have you heard of this item called silver edge?! It's great on strength carries like lifestealer and dk and its not awful on sven if you need it.  Drow I can agree with but honestly thats about positioning, sniper wrecks pa hard lategame as his headshot always has truestrike so you can't list him as a counter.  Silences are bad for every hero, for pa they're no worse than any other hero. You get bkb or manta on her most games anyway.  Yes Razor is an anticarry, he does this to pretty much everyone... at least pa can blink out of his leash.  Sorry for ranting but most of your points ether:   Apply to pretty much every hero (or at least every right click carry) Make no sense Don't take game timing into consideration (heros have power spikes you know)"
TrueDoTA2,3dvdeb,Shardj,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:51:07 2015 UTC,"Lifestealer needs mobility items before he can build damage. But I see your point. Same with Kunkka, although he definitely can't manfight PA.  PA wrecks Huskar though, depending on relative farm levels. She can very easily burst him down from low HP (which Huskar always is) with her dagger pure damage and her crit. And Huskar needs Armlet and Helm before MKB. Maybe even AC or Satanic first too.   I probably didn't list the best ""no mkb"" heroes, but I was mostly trying to avoid heroes like Dusa or Gyro who sometimes build it even versus no evasion. So my bad. That being said, MKB is definitely not the best item for Sven, Antimage, or Lifestealer. They all can build it but there are better items they can build when evasion is not an issue.   I just think PA vs Razor is especially bad because to initiate on him she has to take two Unstable Currents. And Static Link wrecks her. He 100% beats her in lane and early game. Obviously if she gets farmed, and gets damage items and bkb, she can win. But generally it seems like a bad matchup to me.   Your sniper info is outdated. Headshot true strike was removed. And IMO midgame PA beats midgame Sniper, although the matchup could change later when he gets MKB.  I'd argue that PA is so reliant on blink/dagger that silence is worse on her than on similar heroes like Jugg or Troll. But yeah BKB is usually core anyway.   Also you claim that I'm ignoring item timings, but BKB purges Silver Edge break and PA should have it before or at the same time as the enemy gets their SE."
TrueDoTA2,3dvdeb,cerealkillr,0,Tue Jul 21 16:59:44 2015 UTC,"Lifestealer builds attack speed and whether he gets mobility is just dependent on his team. Huskar being beaten by pa really has nothing to do with the fact that he doesn't want mkb, in fact its pretty amazing on him. Huskar gets beaten by pa because he doesn't like physical burst damage.  Antimage can easily build mkb and he puts it too good use as he's a far faster farmer than pa, sure its not optimal but bkb isn't optimal on antimage ether yet loads of people build it for good reason. Sven is one hero, whopty do, name a few more. Also sven can build silver edge. So, name a right click hero which mkb and silver edge is bad on + they aren't a general anti carry like razor, doom, necro and the lark.  Fair point with headshot no longer procing, I didn't notice that with the hero rework. And yes pa does beat sniper early through mid game, you can see in my other comments that I agree with this, but late game pa will get completely wrecked by him.  If Jugg gets silenced he can't spin, if troll gets silenced he can't put out miss chance. Both of those heros suffer to silences just like pa does. Pa is not reliant on blink at all, its just a nice escape (no different to jugg q).  If you initiate on pa without stunning her while her bkb is down then you deserve to have your break purged honestly. And if pa rushes bkb like the enemy rushes silver edge then she'll have almost no impact on the fight anyway so who cares. Really silver edge break comes down to positioning and getting good initiation. You can't claim its not a good counter item by saying it doesn't work if you initiate badly"

She is my favorite hero and I try to pick her whenever I can.  Q1: You pick her when the enemy has a lot's of squishy heroes without a lots of stuns and disables. And when enemy has carries that like to stay behind to lay down DPS like Sniper or Drow.  I can elaborate more on this if you like.  Q2: I'm not a big fan of BF these days. It's very situational. It's for situation when you're playing farming PA and when you can make sure that you can outfarm enemy carry and that you're team can hold their own 4v5 for at least first 25mins of the game. PA's peak is end of the mid game. Maybe 25-45min into the game, that's when she's at her best. With proper items she can come online much more earlier that some other carries and that's your goal.  Q3: Like I said, you want to come online with her as early as possible, and I tend to get lot's of cheap value items on her, like Aquilla, PMS and 15-20min S&Y(or situationally manta for silences) I just get casual morbid mask after Phase, Aquilla and PMS and upgrade it to HotD after S&Y. BKB is rarely not a core on this hero, but I try to snowball early game and try not to get it too early on if it's not really needed so I can have 10sec charge when it actually matters.  If you have any other questions feel free to ask.  She is still good hero in this patch, maybe even better than most since this patch is very early and mid game oriented, but she needs to snowball and get her items early, otherwise she'll be food for heave magic oriented heroes that are strong this patch."

TrueDoTA2,3dvdeb,XyfDota,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:36:31 2015 UTC,"There are a few ways to play PA, and this is my preferred style.   Cheap items. Get active. Finish early.  She excels against heroes who don't like to build MKB and/or BKB. While she does a lot of physical damage you really need to be able to continually blink and stick on the enemy with the bonus attack speed. BKB prevents this. Then, Once the enemies get MKB you are really in trouble. If they manage to get both you are pretty much toast. And now Silvers Edge can also cause issues for you. The solution is to end before they get them.  For laning OoV, Basi/Aquila, optional PMS and Boots. Most offlaners will struggle. With support you can easily kill. Once you get 6 carry a tp scroll. If the enemy dives you are one of the best chasers in the game and deal a serious amount of damage.  I like to transition into a Vlads, Phase/Treads, Drums and look to high ground when I finish BKB. Of course this could work with S&Y or other items, but you do need hp if you want to fight early. While Vlads and Drums may not be ideal for PA you can use the auras to take a early Rosh, push and team fight. The Vlads components also help you and allies sustain in lane.  After that it's just relentlessly pressure, fighting and pushing towers/Rosh after every won fight."
TrueDoTA2,3dvdeb,Monsieur_Skeltal,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:30:40 2015 UTC,"Since you get Vlads, wouldn't Deso be a good choice? It's a great item on PA and the only reason she doesn't build it is that she needs lifesteal."
TrueDoTA2,3dvdeb,__Glitch__,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:31:13 2015 UTC,"The biggest problem with her is that Windranger and Lina are really strong this patch. PA can't deal with the heavy nuke damage from Lina, and Wind can get an mkb and absolutely melt PA."

She isnt a bully but is pretty stable. It is very hard to zone her because she can farm with her q. With the agro meta and lots of magic damage going around the BF build isnt very good.

TrueDoTA2,3dvdeb,Grayalt,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:36:57 2015 UTC,"Like what others said, if their lineup is full of spellcasters and they can consecutive disable/lockdown you then it's not good to pick PA.  Last time when I just started PA I always thought that bfurry is the way to go for every round. But after playing with different people I started to change my build. So for now instead of rushing bfurry I'll go for Threads>Yasha>Vlads or MOM as the 3 basic core. Then if BKB is a top priority for the game then I'll rush it as 4th, if not I'll go for basher, deso (if I don't go for MOM) and just work on my positioning to not get myself into bad situations during engagement.   Rule of thumb: never ever blink into an engagement like a reckless drunkard, always let your allies go in first while you stand behind assess the situation, and when you see their disablers/nukes throw out their crucial spell then off you go and hit the supports like a truck. That's how you save on BKB."

TrueDoTA2,3dvdeb,wildtarget13,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:41:35 2015 UTC,PA should not be played to late game. She is a mid game carry that will snowball if you come online when your 50% evasion is at its highest potential. Going head to head with carries is asking for a long game ending in a loss. Use blur. Get vlads for lifesteal and pushing. Shes surprisingly good at taking towers. When blur drops farm efficiently in jungle. Repeat Deso deso deso. Increases your damage insanely especially your crits. Good for the pick offs. Hp and attack speed is what you want to make PA effective and durable mid game. Why get damage when you attack so slow and barely proc. Make the crit happen more often the damage is already ridiculous.
TrueDoTA2,3dvdeb,skrylius,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:39:21 2015 UTC,"PA is good when you need to end the game early - her optimal point is not 6 slots, her optimal point is right before the first MKB or Silver Edge hits the game and there are 0-1 BKBs on the enemy team. She is also good in lanes where other cores would have almost no chance to farm at all. Since I assume her optimal point is earlier than most people think (between levels 11 and 17), I really don't like Battlefury. However, there are some cases where this is not true. If the enemy team has poor MKB carriers or an invis hero, making someone less likely to build Silver Edge if your supports already sentry the map, she can go Battlefury and 6-slot win. There are two equally legit builds I use. The Medallion build, which prioritizes ganking with the help of Blur minimap effect and the Abyssal Blade build, which farms BKB or Basher or both, hits level 11 early, and then looks for kill opportunities on supports and squishy rightclickers, then finishes Abyssal Blade and with it ends the game before enemy team all gets MKBs, Silver Edges and BKBs.    There is also the Vlads+Deso build, but I do not think it's legit because Vlads is a support item, not a core item. With HotD, you, as a core, get so much more for less gold. Every time I see Lancer or Anti-Mage build it, a kitten dies inside me.  PA also has a few misconceptions around her. One I've already pointed out - she is not a really good 6-slot carry (when everyone is 6-slot, that is). She is decent, but nowhere near Spectre or Ember Spirit levels of good. The other is - if you go Medallion on PA, you must go Phase. Not necessarily, sometimes you really need that extra health from Treads, as well as being useful not only when you have Phantom Strike AS buff on you. And finally - BKB is just as good against her as MKB is. I know it may not feel like it, but try playing PA when every enemy core has BKB and every enemy support has a Ghost Scepter. You cannot blink, you cannot dagger, you cannot right click because everyone just runs away."
TrueDoTA2,3dvdeb,wildtarget13,3,Sun Jul 19 22:00:45 2015 UTC,"Vlads is never a support item. That's like mek being a support item.   Lycan buys it for example.  The item gives early game mana regen for low INT heroes and helps the entire team as opposed to only yourself. It also will help during pushes, either split pushing or deathball, more than other items.  If you expect any hero to cover you or be around you, vlads is helpful. If they have riduculous physical DPS like Death prophet ulti or BRistle back it can nullify much more damage than a dominator."
TrueDoTA2,3dvdeb,subraizada3_,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:10:35 2015 UTC,"Comparing Mekansm to Vlads is a bit wrong, since there are a few things Mekansm (and Greaves later) give to their carrier that they don't give to the people around. Vlads is compeletely an aura-item.   For example, a BH with Greaves and Dagger will constantly have opportunities to track at least 3-4 people, mana will no longer be an issue to him and he will deal considerably more damage because of how many people he can track fulltime. Phase Vlads Deso BH will be food every teamfight, unable to utilise the rightclick damage buff because he can't get into melee range and unable to make his team benefit from Vlads because he will die first, because he cannot cleanse the dust and the slow it gives or gtfo from a tight spot when he realises he's on top of a sentry.  Ring of Aquilla is here for a reason. It gives the best parts of Vlads to an agility hero for 1/3 the cost as well as having the added advantage of buffing creeps when you need that extra oomph to get the tower.  I used to be that man who wanted lifesteal on every hero, especially after coming back to Dota after a 5 year break during second half of which I played League of Legends where health regen is pretty much non-existent, but in Dota we have some of the most powerful health regeneration tools, lifesteal is really not that necessary. I'd even go as far as argue that on PA, I buy HotD first and foremost for the cheap damage and armor, secondly for the domination ability, and lifesteal is the last reason I do. When I really need lifesteal, I get Satanic."
TrueDoTA2,3dvdeb,bravo_six,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:15:20 2015 UTC,"It's not the point I was trying to make. I'm not comparing two damage items.   Both class and Mek are commonly seen as support items even though they have a much bigger impact of you group 2+ more people and get it before 10 minutes as a core.   The bounty hunter greaves argument is solid, for a different defensive argument. But greaves has a completely different item timing than vlads."
TrueDoTA2,3dvdeb,skrylius,2,Mon Jul 20 16:38:37 2015 UTC,"Every time I see Lancer or Anti-Mage build it, a kitten dies inside me.   AM can't get any other lifesteal item because Mana Break is a UAM. Vlads makes him split push better, lets him farm ancients and jungle without losing HP, and lets him solo rosh.  Not sure why PL wouldn't just get HotD or a raw Morbid though, Satanic is much better late game. He doesn't even need it for jungle sustain, just a-click an illusion to switch aggro and you can stay out for a long long time without needing to return to the fountain for regen."
TrueDoTA2,3dvdeb,abontikus,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:56:08 2015 UTC,"Vlads was only lifesteal option for PL, but since Diffusal stacks with HotD I see no reason to get Vlads on him anymore. Lancer is late game carry and in my opinion, option to upgrade to satanic is better than having Vlads."

TrueDoTA2,3duy42,larharth,18,Sun Jul 19 18:50:50 2015 UTC,"Pretty big. Desolator is meant to shred armor to allow for quick kills, which is why it is built on heroes like TA, Bounty Hunter, Clinkz, and Weaver. These heroes have physical damage steroids which are amplified by the desolator. However, not being able to life steal off of their massive damage is the trade off, otherwise Clinkz and TA could become extremely overpowered.  However, a better way to look at it would be what heroes build lifesteal that could use desolator efficiently too. Imagine a PA with desolator and Satanic or even just a HOTD. She'd be unstoppable. The same could be applied to heroes who purchase other UAM like QOP and Medusa.   Desolator being a UAM is an artificial method to limit the insane survivability of agility carries who would stack it and other UAMs. Allowing it to stack would cause agility carries to become insanely strong to the point that you would have no other options. Imagine trying to fight someone with mask of madness, skadi, and deso: it'd be impossible."
TrueDoTA2,3duy42,Ishmael_KingOfTheSea,4,Sun Jul 19 19:15:55 2015 UTC,it would be good for agi carries for sure but it isnt much better as Vlads/Deso for Pa for exp.   Hotd just has a good upg lategame.  For range carries hotd is ofc 5 % more lifesteal.

The Vlads damage will scale into the late game.              Do you really need a satanic every game? I've tried the Vlads/Deso a few times and it is extremely nasty for early/mid-game.

All this talk about how imbalanced lifeleech + Deso would be... well Deso has approx the same DPS/gold efficiency as Daed (depending on the targets armor), yet crit from Crys/Daed isn't a UAM, so is that imbalanced? I mean Deso -armor amps all physical damage to the target, so having your teammate with Deso and you with life leech is imbalanced? It makes no sense.  Fact of the matter is most heroes who get Deso have kits which somehow benefit from the -armor over other types of DPS mechanics, not because it would be imbalanced with lifeleech.  I'm trying to think of any specific hero where -armor would be imbalanced on but nothing springs to mind. At the end of the day Deso is just another flavor of DPS, it's not like bash where it can break the game if you let it stack. IMO UAM is an unneeded mechanic and any specific hero where a certain UAM would break the game can just be disabled on that particular hero. This opens up more item builds for all heroes and thus adds more variety. From IceFrog's recent removal of UAM on Diffusal I think eventually it will become that way."
TrueDoTA2,3duy42,Skyro620,4,Sun Jul 19 21:15:25 2015 UTC,"Desolator is two thousand gold cheaper than Daedalus and, as you sad, amps all your teammates' physical damage too. It's a pretty strong item, it needs some sort of downside or there would be little reason to buy Daedalus."
TrueDoTA2,3duy42,WoxandWarf,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:50:12 2015 UTC,"Deso's drawback is that it is a mid-game item, e.g. it gives less raw DPS as Daedalus thus it is less suitable for a hard carry which values item slots more than gold efficiency. Also the -armor from Deso becomes less effective as armor levels get higher relative to the flat crit of Daedalus.  Thus Deso's niche is really for heroes with kits that synergize with the -armor and/or semi-carry roles which are looking to be impactful in the mid game."
TrueDoTA2,3duy42,Skyro620,2,Mon Jul 20 17:50:01 2015 UTC,"Plus one on this. Lifesteal doesnt become a serious factor in fights until lategame when DPS output allows it, and when at that point enemy team carries vlads and ac plus alot of natural armor the deso damage falls of really quick. Also, desolators real value comes in tower pushes, which you obviously can't use other UAMs on anyway.  Now while Deso might require buffs, heroes like TA or Clinkz really could use without."
TrueDoTA2,3duy42,Joelramones,7,Sun Jul 19 23:02:16 2015 UTC,"Yes, it would be incredibly overpowered.  I'm imagining all the carries running around with Deso and MoM. Jugg, Sniper, Void, Drow.

The reason UAMs are in the game has nothing to do with balance, it has to do with Warcraft 3 engine limitations - many effects were easy to code as orbs, and orbs had a hard limit of one at a time.

TrueDoTA2,3dsbvf,SavageRS,4,Tue Jul 21 16:25:43 2015 UTC,"Because pudge needs mobility (forcestaff-dagger) before getting armor. If you need armor you could always make a shivas or cuirass in lategame. The minus armor active is wasted in a hero with all skills doing not physical damage. Centaur is the same case. All his skills does magical damage, so no combo, and you need a blink dagger ALWAYS if you want to be effective. Plus if you want to manfight, the best item is the cuirass for the attack speed PLUS tank capabilities. Solar crest its a nice 5 item. I would ONLY get it against a mostly full rightclick enemy lineup.   Like you said, only in lategame scenearios and only if the enemy have a lot of rightclick.  TL;DR: After cuirass/shiva and facing lot of rightclick why not?"
TrueDoTA2,3dsbvf,SavageRS,2,Sun Jul 19 02:29:40 2015 UTC,"Oh definitely I'd assume you would have built the mobility items, I'm just saying from the link I posted the op found that the evasion makes you have higher EHP than any other tank item with high hp heroes.  Don't get me wrong AC and Shiva's is still very good but it's hard as hell to build.  The components are some of the priciest in the game."

But honestly I just played an offlane DK and had a amazing time with the item.  Extremely tanky and with a bkb I could keep fighting.  The active isn't even needed and I could farm really quick with soul ring as well.  So the evasion and armor came in really early in the game.  With dk's good strength gain and good armor it gave me more armor than 6 slotted Carrys while having evasion as well.  Slark built a mkb just to counter my item.  And he spent 2400 more gold to get it.  I could've sold it later and got AC and I'd be fine.  Then Slark would look stupid on dotabuff for getting a mkb   Look at dotabuff at the items stats.  There is only one hero that has below 50% winrate with it and that's 35 collected matches of Tinker.   Undying has a 70% winrate with this item, it's a core for him now!"
TrueDoTA2,3dsbvf,tomatomater,3,Sun Jul 19 19:16:26 2015 UTC,The issue with the dota buff win rates is that the team that wins gets more items. This means that each game more items get a win than a loss. Most items are above 50% because of this.
TrueDoTA2,3dsbvf,zajfy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:22:59 2015 UTC,"Probably because most people want items they can get the most use out of, especially actives.

TrueDoTA2,3ds53t,701432,42,Sat Jul 18 22:53:11 2015 UTC,"Smokescreen gives a 70% miss chance. In fights Clinkz just stands there throwing out deeps, Riki gives the enemy team a large disadvantage and Blink Strikes around creating chaos. Permanent invis has a 2 second fade time, Clinkz has to wait 17 seconds to do something after going invis. Riki has superior survivability in lane because 8 HP regen from invis. I've played Riki 85 games and Clinkz 6 times and it seems to me that Riki is also lot more tanky than Clinkz when not ulted. Riki also desn't have mana issues early on. This is huge since he can go invis as many times as he wants but Clinkz has a very poor mana pool and can't stay invis forever. Riki can buy Basher to stop TPs."
TrueDoTA2,3ds53t,subraizada3_,6,Sat Jul 18 23:17:40 2015 UTC,"To add to this, Riki can do better in early fights once he has ultimate. With one support it is nearly a guaranteed kill. This gives him a power peak while Clinkz is still ramping up. He is also harder to kill at this point as he can blink to allies, while clinkz relies on invis."
TrueDoTA2,3ds53t,XyfDota,4,Sun Jul 19 04:34:07 2015 UTC,"He is also harder to kill at this point as he can blink to allies, while clinkz relies on invis.   I think this is probably the second most important factor after Smokescreen. The way I usually see Clinkz or Riki failing in my pubs is by getting ganked a bit too much early, which results in them just having too slow a start to be relevant in the midgame. Ganking Clinkz generally amounts to bringing dust and having a stun. To gank Riki, you need to play around Smokescreen, Blink Strike and the fact that he can purge dust with Diffusal. It's not vast, but enough that not getting ganked as Clinkz is (for me) harder than not getting ganked as Riki."
TrueDoTA2,3ds53t,AnalysisSitus,2,Sun Jul 19 09:43:42 2015 UTC,"Riki invis is also much stronger than Clinkz due to it being passive. It being passive means   a) it's very hard to find where he is on the map unless he shows himself, so he's basically always missing  b) he can fade back into invis even when stunned or silenced  c) even if mana burned or drained he can still go invis  Permanent Invis is probably one of if not the strongest non-ultimate spell in the game. The only reason Riki is balanced is that all his stats besides agi gain are utter shit, because his spells are very very good."

TrueDoTA2,3ds53t,subraizada3_,12,Tue Jul 21 05:08:07 2015 UTC,"Riki is stronger than Clinkz as a support.  He is a solid counterpick to Jungling heroes to seriously fuck with their first 12 mins.    Without expending any mana whatsoever, he can deny camps with his body, deny them with sentries, leach exp/last hits by just being there, finish junglers that like to facetank such as Lycan, Ursa, and Lone Druid's bear(300 gold is no joke, bro).  With the recent changes to tango and quelling blade, he can deward, also avoiding detection by always having sentries on him and eating wards when he knows they are there.  He is permanently invisible for zero cost.  A well placed smoke screen wreaks havoc on the enemy team during teamfights and ganks, offering just enough for your mid or offlaner to secure kills until the enemy team either gets BKB or MKB.  Did I mention he is permanently invisible for zero cost?  His mere presence forces the enemy team to buy detection(which you will either purge off after you get a diffusal, or eat instantly with a tango because you will always have sentries or a gem on you) which leeches the gold from the enemy supports, further tilting the net worth balance toward your team.    If your team is doing well enough for you to get a manta after your diffusal, you can purge dust off yourself forever, and even use your illusions as mobile wards for scouting!  He scales well into the late game for obvious reasons, as well.    I can't speak for how strong Riki is as a core after 6.84, but since the patch, I've had success(and a LOT of fun) running him position 4/5."
TrueDoTA2,3ds53t,Soltarilol,3,Sun Jul 19 02:06:41 2015 UTC,"How does he compare to Bounty Hunter in this role, though?"
TrueDoTA2,3ds53t,Soltarilol,4,Sun Jul 19 02:09:19 2015 UTC,"Bounty hunter can do many of the same things Riki can, with a different toolkit.  Riki is the better pick against Junglers and Spellcasters, while BH is more of an all-purpose pick.    His invisibility lasts forever until you act, costing no mana.  In the super early game, before you get items to sustain mana, Riki can stalk junglers without having to hide behind trees, use mana, or wait for an ability cooldown.  Smokescreen creates chaos in a more active way than Track or Jinada does with it's massive aoe silence, miss chance, and slow.    Bounty hunter makes your team a lot of gold, and also scales well into the lategame because of this.    Both heroes fit the same role, IMO, with BH as a more all-purpose pick, and Riki as more of a counter to Junglers."
TrueDoTA2,3ds53t,PigDog4,2,Sun Jul 19 02:50:47 2015 UTC,"Bounty Hunter also has much stronger burst without items.  A Riki without items really can only smokescreen. A bounty without items can still shadow walk break damage + jinada + shuriken.  Early game, Riki can really only annoy junglers. BH can kill them."
TrueDoTA2,3ds53t,AndersonIV,7,Mon Jul 20 15:57:31 2015 UTC,"Okay so I play both heroes very often. These are the builds I usually go on each hero:    Rikimaru:  Poor Man's > Wraith Band 1 > Power Treads > Wraith Band 2 > Turn Wraith Band 1 into Aquila > Diffusal > Basher > Abyssal  Clinkz:  Wraith Band > Treads > Orchid/Desolater > MKB/Daedalus     Riki can go online for kills way faster than Clinkz. When you have two wraith bands, Treads, and poor mans... You can almost 3-4 shot supports if you get it early enough. However his ability to push after grabbing kills is weak. Clinkz on the other hand, can go online *for towers way faster than Riki. Clinkz naturally melts towers, even before Desolator.      When both heroes get their midgame core item (Desolator/Orchid on Clinkz or Diffusal on Riki) they both can snowball like crazy.     Late game (sorta behind):   Both heroes can be valuable vision Clinkz can still contribute (DPS wise) from a distance or split push because of his range (625) Riki can still put down smoke clouds but more useless than Clinkz      When ahead, both heroes are very similar. They can assassinate stranglers. Riki has more teamfight with smoke cloud, Clinkz has more split push"
TrueDoTA2,3ds53t,Drop_,2,Sun Jul 19 03:23:39 2015 UTC,"Smoke Screen is fucking amazing and people under-estimate it too much.  Sure you can deal with it with bkb, but it's so strong against heroes that don't typically rush bkb and rely on skills for survival like QoP, Weaver, Slark, AM, etc. etc.   Really it's apples to oranges.  I would argue riki isn't played right most often.  People play him like he's a pickoff hero and if they don't win in the early to midgame via pickoffs they usually lose by trying to kill the enemy team 1v5 once detection starts popping up.   Realistically what they need to do is focus on using smoke screen as a follow up to a team's initiation (e.g. RP, Ravage, Overgrowth, or even long slows like Upheaval, etc.).  Too often riki's think they need to be the one initiating, and just end up getting blown up instantly.  Riki is really a lot stronger against heroes who can escape like AM, QoP etc.  Forcing them into bkb's, whereas with Clinkz, even if you go the typically less ideal orchid build, they can still get other items which may be more beneficial like linkens or manta to deal with your orchid."
TrueDoTA2,3ds53t,cskalias,2,Sun Jul 19 16:17:13 2015 UTC,"i think clinkz is more of a traditional farming carry (like drow) and riki is more of an early game farming disturbance/scouting hero (like bh, although most people play him like any other core). the smoke is something that clinkz can't really replicate at all."
TrueDoTA2,3ds53t,Shawn_Spenstar,-3,Sun Jul 19 01:17:37 2015 UTC,Orchid is a very common item on Clinkz which allows him to prevent escapes in a similar way Smokescreen does.

Once a teamfight begin, jumping to one of their supports then using smoke effectively allow you to take that support out of the fight without any contribution from him ( since he's silenced). Riki has won me quite some teamfights when enemy supports stands close together behind their team and I was able jump, smoke and kill them off fast enough to remove their disables."
TrueDoTA2,3ds53t,RampagingRagE,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:23:01 2015 UTC,"You cant compare riki to bounty hunter and clinkz. Clinkz is a high dps pysical damage dealer, reliable, strong in split pushing (can reliably destroy structures).  Bounty hunter is a high risk/high reward support/offlaner. If he gets enough momentum and your team has succesful ganka he provides your team a huge gold advantage, otherwise he is useless and falls off quickly.  Riki does... Nothing. The 2 main issue of riki are the extreme squishyness (he dies faster than a support) and the fact that he basically has 3 skills: permanent invisibility is conpletely and easily countered by true sight, it provides nothing else.  While clinkz has crazy mobility and still some sort of escape off skeleton walk, bounty hunter and nyx ave bonus damage when coming off invis (for offensive purposes) riki has bothing.  Backstab and blink strike are valuable spells that scales well ibto the late game. Still he has good offensive spellsthat arent covered by any kind of tankiness or even escape; the only value is on smokescreen, it is incredibly good in early fights (when you still havent bkbs nor mkbs), but most rikkis max out invis or even backstab first, nullifying the only good thing the hero has.

TrueDoTA2,3ds53t,Peanut_Noir,2,Sun Jul 19 00:35:51 2015 UTC,"Is that reason enough to pick him, though? Riki is a pretty poor hard carry when compared to the likes of other agility heroes like Anti-Mage, Phantom Assassin, Spectre, Void, etc. Part of the problem is that his itemization revolves around getting value out of Backstab with lots of +Agi. As a result, he loses out on farming/pushing items like Midas, Battlefury, Maelstrom, Desolator.  Riki excels as a mid-game ganker. He has a big power-spike when he gets Diffusal (or another major item), which pretty much allows him to solo kill supports. Through ganking, Riki hopes to secure a snowballing advantage for his team since he has difficultly closing out games himself. If the supports are poor from buying sentries/dust and too afraid to leave tower or go solo, I would consider Riki's work done.   The problem is that Clinkz can also do this (with a better escape), and much more, since he is able to push towers and take Rosh much more easily."
TrueDoTA2,3ds53t,reasonableposter,2,Sun Jul 19 00:16:47 2015 UTC,"Another consideration is that smokescreen is a powerful silence. Most silences you can get out with manta or eul, but smokescreen will wait for you after those items. Only thing countering it bkb. So against certain picks like Anti-mage, who doesn't want to buy bkb early but naturally buys a manta, riki is a great way to stop his mobility and focus him down.   Smokescreen also fucks up the likes of storm spirit too.   But I think clinkz is a more meta viable pick at the moment."
TrueDoTA2,3ds53t,Jackolope,0,Mon Jul 20 08:09:57 2015 UTC,"I can agree with you there, while the fill a similar role in being gankers I think Clinkz does have more utility in pushing towers/waves. I do think though clinkz can have a much harder time if he's shut down early and farm depraved whereas riki can transition much easier into the jungle with his Q if need be.  Obviously not ideal, but both have their charms... really I don't think either are bad picks if you're trying to go with an invis carry... but as you note there are better agi carries to use already."

TrueDoTA2,3ds53t,cowokganteng,-1,Sun Jul 19 00:57:11 2015 UTC,"Early level wise, Riki can easily jungle with chokepointing + Q with his regen to sustain and a shield. Clinkz before his ult can't do any of the sort and his sustain during that period is non existent. Riki can get his lvl 6 in jungle easily, and sustain... Clinkz can't.  By the time you do have ult with clinkz you don't wanna be in jungle anymore... so it's a bit pointless, since by then you either wanna be pushing towers or ganking."
TrueDoTA2,3drp9v,Kurolox,8,Sat Jul 18 20:28:57 2015 UTC,"I've been checking the Dotabuff of some of the top players.   The players actually don't buy force or mek. Some players buy midas. But the two I looked at buy Atos, Blink, and Octarine.  The logic behind it is that blink gives you a guaranteed escape with self astral in the right direction and proper turning. It also solves your kiting issues more than force staff.   THe INT lost from force doesn't matter because it's not the most efficient INT anyways compared to Atos or bigger items.   Refresher+BKB is better than Aghs+Refresher. Aghs after that is situational and most of the games I've bseen have Octarine and Hex as their first major luxury items.   Edit: Oh and they buy bottle.

TrueDoTA2,3drp9v,wildtarget13,4,Sat Jul 18 22:25:41 2015 UTC,OD has a bunch of bad matchups BUT he does well against Queen of Pain. (https://dotametrics.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/1v1matchupchart.png)  Since QoP is a very common draft he can be used because even Lehsrac with free farm in the safelane is going to be eating ult damage comparable to QoPs ult and that level of XP gain never happens with Lesh and QoP on the same team. OD has his place considering the current drafts but he'll fall off quick if people just swap out qop for a better anti-OD mid.

In most cases where you even consider OD, silencer does the job just a little bit better. As opposed to making space for what equates to a fancy right clicker who is countered in part by bkb, you have another pure damage orb that scales off INT but has a global silence. I just can't think of any good reason why you would want OD over a more versatile hero that has a global silence (instead of an aoe skillshot that takes like 15k farm to wipe with)."

He's amazing against tanky strength and / or agility lineups but is doomed if there's a lot of disable and nuke on the enemy team.
TrueDoTA2,3drp9v,DasFroDo,2,Sat Jul 18 20:55:17 2015 UTC,"IMO the only thing he does exceptionally well (as in is best in class for) is counter a huskar, axe, or a generally very low-int team composition heavy on melee. He can make a lot of low-INT mids or combo spell dependant mids have an extremely bad lane but he can't really take advantage of that lead himself because his hero just needs to farm all the way until the teamfight phase.  It's a really situational pick."
TrueDoTA2,3drp9v,Shod_Kuribo,2,Sat Jul 18 23:19:07 2015 UTC,"Actually it's hilarious to gank an OD as axe with blink and blade mail. You will always have more hp than OD, so just blink and activate blade mail with call. OD can usually kill himself in 3-4 hits because the pure damage from his orb isn't reduced by armor."
TrueDoTA2,3drp9v,Soonerz,3,Sat Jul 18 23:22:15 2015 UTC,I'd wager a good OD might hold off on keeping Arcane Orb toggled on of an axe is off the map
TrueDoTA2,3drp9v,SoupKitchenHero,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:32:46 2015 UTC,You don't use OD to counter an axe by right clicking him. You let him blink and then astral him either before or after the call. Astral is more or less the only thing that keeps an axe from spinning.
TrueDoTA2,3drp9v,Shod_Kuribo,3,Sat Jul 18 23:46:27 2015 UTC,I am in 2.7k bracket and I like to get rod of atos into bkb with a blink or force staff thrown in when I need the escape/initiation. It works well and I consider it core.
TrueDoTA2,3drp9v,chadronsyoloswag,2,Sat Jul 18 21:52:23 2015 UTC,OD is one of those heroes that wants a lot of farm and a lot of experience to be effective. This philosophy is hampered  by the fact that OD can't do anything to an opponent with an active BKB. This gives him a very small window in which to dominate if he isn't snowballing.   This is made worse by OD's weaker laning stage since he's been hit by the nerfbat a few times.   Scepter plus refresher is a pub stomp type of build for OD. You purchase those two items in tandem early to achieve rampages when you're ahead. Otherwise I would pick up the scepter as an ultra late luxury item.   The refresher is a decent pickup after you have a few intelligence items. I would always pick up the refresher before the scepter because a naked scepter gives your opponent an easy way to counter initiate a fight or just simply run away with a blink dagger.  I really like rod of atos on OD as a decent mid game pickup. It gives you good intelligence gain while shoring up your poor natural hp.   Late game shivas and/or sheep stick is always good on OD.   By the time bkb comes out you'll want to look into getting a blink. Blink plus Astral imprisonment should allow you to hang around long enough to potentially wait out the bkbs.
TrueDoTA2,3drp9v,bwl2,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:31:33 2015 UTC,"I recently tried mek forcestaff into octarine. It was OK. OD is falling out of the meta though, still a decent pub pick albeit squishy."
TrueDoTA2,3drp9v,jack-dawed,2,Sat Jul 18 21:00:05 2015 UTC,"OD is one of my favorite heroes and it sucks that he's now outclasses by so many other carries. I wouldn't even play him right now, but if he ever gets buffed and his mechanics remain the same I'd play him mid.   People build Atos because it's the best INT to gold item in the game, and the active is a nice bonus. At 3.1k you can get it relatively early. You need INT and Mana on OD more than any other hero, because of the synergy it has with all his abilities (especially his ult).    The Aghs + Refresher build is extremely greedy and doesn't give you raw INT and Mana. The mana regen from Refresher is irrelevant because your passive restores mana for you anyways. For 10k total there are a lot better things you can get like Octarine + Atos + 1k to spare. Octarine is EXTREMELY good on OD because you lifesteal off of his q ability, your active is reduced by 3 seconds allowing you to hard disable more enemies in teamfights, and your ult which is normally 160 seconds goes down to 120 seconds. On top of that you get a ton of INT, Mana, and other stuff."
TrueDoTA2,3drp9v,Gaston44,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:49:35 2015 UTC,He is still a lane winner but he is not the mid game nuker that you want. He really doesn't come online until he gets his ~4 item. Force Treads Hex Aghs Atos
TrueDoTA2,3drp9v,Pentt41207,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:29:04 2015 UTC,Aghs refresher is not better than aghs and lets say shivas or another similarly expensive item. And the hero has 0 viability at the moment.  People on r/dota2 love to talk about how Terrorblade is weak but OD is another level of weakness.
TrueDoTA2,3drp9v,sintoras2,0,Sat Jul 18 22:42:25 2015 UTC,"Please DONT build aghs on him, it is a game losing item. Get int items. A lot lf int, bkb and later on a refresher. Please PleasePLEASE"
TrueDoTA2,3drp9v,RampagingRagE,0,Sun Jul 19 10:11:27 2015 UTC,"Kuro I would say avoid Aghs Refresher on OD. Run your standard OD mid build of Midas Force Hex Shiva BKB Refresher with an optional Orchid and you'll be fine.  To fully use Aghs Refresher, you need 10k gold. 10k for what, double ult in a teamfight? Then do almost nothing when its on cool down? No, I would not take a chance and rather focus on doing as much damage as I efficiently can with the gold I can farm."
TrueDoTA2,3drp9v,TheArchist,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:18:12 2015 UTC,"Then do almost nothing when its on cool down?   While I do agree with your point, there is still the whole +130 physical damage, +152 pure damage on your right-clicks that is worth considering. Given that a Rapier's physical damage would be reduced by armor, your orbs will basically be hitting for harder then a Rapier if you get that extremely niche, more expensive combination off."
TrueDoTA2,3di4ox,Charging_in,17,Thu Jul 16 13:36:34 2015 UTC,"Totally agree. Though it's not just shortcomings, it's relative strengths too ... though that's just framing, everything is a shortcoming relative to perfect play.  I always find it really interesting running in to players that are much better/worse at some aspect, yet clearly must make up/fall short in some aspect to be a similar MMR.  The guy who's has appalling strategic decision making (items, map movement) but is mechanically strong in fights and farms well.  The guy who's weak at last hitting but who'll still win his games through outfighting and snowballing despite farming less than others."
TrueDoTA2,3di4ox,refD,3,Thu Jul 16 14:33:16 2015 UTC,"That's just it, thanks for taking the time to read it. Are there any alterations you'd make to my examples or how I've framed my post?"
TrueDoTA2,3di4ox,Shod_Kuribo,2,Thu Jul 16 15:42:14 2015 UTC,"I've randomly played with a guy a few times who seems to only play lycan. Every. Single. Game. He will never participate in anything on the map until 40+ minutes but he is a magnificent ratting bastard who more or less never dies  and just keeps slowly pushing down towers throughout the game.  If you pick some good push and follow him around, you'll win by turning the game into a deathball. If you pick a team that can 4v5 until 40-50 minutes, you win by lategaming them (because at 40 minutes, he is at least 5-slotted from all those creep kills and starts to teamfight). However, the guy will almost certainly lose every game where his teammates need to rely on him participating in fights early or the opposing team just stacks stun to gank him early and often."
TrueDoTA2,3di4ox,nbwk,21,Fri Jul 17 04:14:35 2015 UTC,"Absolutely true.   I'm 4k and recently queued unranked with some friends of a friend who were ~1.9k. After we lost a game, one of them said, ""well, I don't think I could've done anything differently. <other player> lost us the game"".   And that's why he's 1.9k and will never make it to my bracket (until he changes this attitude). He honestly did not see any of the mistakes he made, of which there were many. It was easy for me to see them as someone who was a bit better than the group.  The same goes for me though. It's the exact same reason I'm 4k and not 6k. I sometimes finish games and think, ""I don't know what I could've done differently to win that"". Some 6k could watch my game and give me a laundry list of what I did wrong, too.  It's all about realizing your shortcomings, and fixing them, if your goal is to raise your MMR. I think that's the problem; it's hard for people to be self-critical and realize what they're doing wrong in most areas of life, not just Dota. It's just something we're not naturally good at as humans."
TrueDoTA2,3di4ox,Monsieur_Skeltal,5,Thu Jul 16 14:26:23 2015 UTC,"I don't know why I've had such shitty luck lately, but I'm on a COLOSSAL losing streak for ranked. 300 MMR gone. Sure I fuck up sometimes, but I safely blame my team when I'm the only one who doesn't have 3 times more deaths than kills. I know what this thread is about, and I fully expect downvotes, but I honestly think I deserve 2.5k not 2k. I usually win my lane, and I leverage that to get rune control and smoke gank other lanes. I pick up wards when my supports have difficulty, and if I see a support in lane while the rest of them are missing, I don't go in on it then be surprised when it's a bait and flame my team for not being there. I don't care what anyone says. I'm gonna keep blaming my team when 4 of them fight over mid and then one of them starts feeding, after going to a different lane 5 minutes in, because he's 5 minutes behind on farm."
TrueDoTA2,3di4ox,fourthirds,27,Thu Jul 16 15:08:56 2015 UTC,That's just it dude. You just listed all your strengths. All the things you do right. All the things you should be doing. What you didn't list is what you don't know. You don't know what you did wrong. You don't know what you could've done better. Because you're not being critical enough.   Watch a replay of a loss. Blame yourself and only yourself for that game and look at every decision.   That's the key to improving
TrueDoTA2,3di4ox,Simco_,2,Thu Jul 16 15:15:37 2015 UTC,"Even watching replays of wins can be instructive. You might have won, but did you win as hard as you could? Probably not. I recently played a game where I shattered my previous personal bests, had 1.2k gpm and xpm. By any metric I played well. I went to watch the replay to jerk myself off and I was surprised by how many mistakes I made, times when I didn't punish out of position enemies, I missed a totally free courier kill, my one death was totally avoidable and stupid, I prioritized my spells wrongly in team fights... On and on. Recognizing my mistakes in a game like that where at the time I felt like I won as hard as possible really made me appreciate how wrong a concept it is to say ""I won my lane hard but they fucked up and lost their lanes"". If you won your lane by getting 2 solo kills and 50% more CS, great, but better decision making could've made that 3 solo kills, a successful gank on each other lane and double the CS.   Point is, success is relative. Everybody wins mid against pudge, so if you merely beat him in CS, he won. Watch your losing games to see how you failed, and watch your winning games to see how much more you could have succeeded."
TrueDoTA2,3di4ox,Monsieur_Skeltal,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:37:00 2015 UTC,"You don't know what you did wrong.   This applies to everything, not just Dota.  The smarter someone is, the more experienced or skilled they are at something, the more they realize their own shortcomings.    Most people don't even know what they don't know.    After every single game, you should be able to mentally list half a dozen things (or more) you could have done better.  Everyone fucks up."
TrueDoTA2,3di4ox,shulk_rotmg,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:43:57 2015 UTC,"I admitted that I fuck up sometimes, and that I could have played better, but isn't it irrelevant when 4/5 people on my team have brown boots at the end of the game, and some of them still have their gg branches? I'm not making that shit up. That happened to me last week. And I wasn't trying to say that I was good at those things, I was just trying to show that I tried to be a team player."
TrueDoTA2,3di4ox,Najda,20,Thu Jul 16 15:21:56 2015 UTC,"Those games will happen. You'll also have games where that happens for the other team. Everything goes right, you smash them and take the easy +25 and promptly forget about that game.   Don't lament the unwinnables. Lament the ones that were close. One's where if you were only a little bit better, it could've been the difference.   And then be that difference."

TrueDoTA2,3di4ox,Najda,3,Sat Jul 18 17:32:46 2015 UTC,"There are games that are completely unwinnable, but that's a very small percentage of your games. There will be equal as many that are just about unloseable. If you deserve higher mmr, you'll get there if you just play enough games. Your mistakes matter more in the games that are close, so focus on those."
TrueDoTA2,3di4ox,Dallas1229,0,Thu Jul 16 15:41:44 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying that Valve should let me recalibrate and just give me the MMR like some people believe, but it's really frustrating when you play well enough to win buut just don't have the backup. I've had games where I'm essentially 2v5, and I kill them numerous times with decent plays, but the second I die it's gg. Those games are the ones that kill me."
TrueDoTA2,3di4ox,ColumW,2,Thu Jul 16 16:15:26 2015 UTC,If you're the 1 or 2 position and die lategame without a buyback that's almost always going to be true.
TrueDoTA2,3di4ox,Dat_Speed,4,Thu Jul 16 19:20:31 2015 UTC,"Whats frustrating is playing with people who use their party mmr as ""fuck around mmr"". Cant stand getting into a group where 2 dudes just wanna beat off in the same lane and then act like they could give a shit about a win because they dont value their party mmr."
TrueDoTA2,3di4ox,eeyunn,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:32:53 2015 UTC,"Frustrating, sure, but they're MMR is accurate as long as they have that attitude all the time.   Like, they'll still win 50% of their games even with the shitty attitude, so don't let them get to you."
TrueDoTA2,3di4ox,phob,0,Thu Jul 16 17:19:38 2015 UTC,"Dota pubs have always been a 1v5 game. If you can't 1v5 effectively, you don't deserve higher MMR."
TrueDoTA2,3di4ox,ColumW,8,Thu Jul 16 20:24:23 2015 UTC,There are three types of games. Games that are unwinnable... Games that are unloseable... And games that are c lose. In the games that are close...the decisions you make will directly reflect the outcome of that game. Let's say you play 100 games. 48 of those are unwinnable. 48 are unloseable. 4 of those games you will either win or lose depending on your exact actions (the exact number is irrelevant). Those four games = 100 mmr. Those are the games that will decide whether or not you will move up in mmr.
TrueDoTA2,3di4ox,phob,-2,Thu Jul 16 15:36:59 2015 UTC,"You use the words ""unwinnable"" and ""unloseable"", which are misleading.  It should really be qualified with a ""... for you.""  Any 7k player could win 99% if not 100% of the games in the 2k bracket.    Also, 48% is far too generous.  Nobody is so extremely consistent in performance that they would literally be unable to lose 48% of games and unable to win 48% of the other games no matter how good or bad their physical and mental condition is that day.  I think 20/60/20% is more realistic."
TrueDoTA2,3di4ox,Dat_Speed,5,Thu Jul 16 16:59:39 2015 UTC,"Merlini thinks its something closer to 33/33/33 (give or take). This is because when 5k players play on smurf accounts rated at 3/4k, they still only have a 70-80% winrate.  The exact number is debatable, and like you said it all depends on your own relative skill level."
TrueDoTA2,3di4ox,eeyunn,2,Thu Jul 16 17:18:37 2015 UTC,"Juice went from 3k to 4k with only 3 losses (all of which were in the 3.5k bracket).  http://www.playdota.com/forums/showthread.php?t=1398477  That's about a 95% winrate.  It would be even higher in the 2k bracket, and Juice was only a 5.6k player.  A 7k player would have even less trouble getting 98%+ win rates in 2k."
TrueDoTA2,3di4ox,ColumW,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:32:04 2015 UTC,"Right, because below 3800 most people lack basic knowledge of the game, while 4k+ tend to be fairly solid players, and the finer details of the game really win or lose u the game. I would like to see how many losses a 6k+ player has going from 4k to 5k. I'd imagine it would be closer to 75-80% win rate at best."
TrueDoTA2,3di4ox,eeyunn,0,Thu Jul 16 20:22:43 2015 UTC,Yes. I said the number is irrelevant.
TrueDoTA2,3di4ox,eeyunn,3,Thu Jul 16 17:19:07 2015 UTC,"Irrelevant but still interesting imo! And if anything, it's probably better to treat all games as winnable. Might be a better mindset."
TrueDoTA2,3di4ox,Ishopkmart,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:51:34 2015 UTC,Definitely agree with you 100%. No matter how far behind we are I never give up. There is always the 1% of games that feel hopeless but you end up winning. And those are the best games ever!
TrueDoTA2,3di4ox,loveisdead,5,Thu Jul 16 19:29:11 2015 UTC,That's why I said the number is irrelevant.
TrueDoTA2,3di4ox,loveisdead,-1,Thu Jul 16 17:18:21 2015 UTC,Did you not see him say the exact numbers he was using were irrelevant?
TrueDoTA2,3di4ox,Monsieur_Skeltal,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:01:35 2015 UTC,"A certain percentage of games you will always win, and a certain percentage you will always lose. There are games the lie in the middle of the win probability that you are trying to influence. You won't know what type of game it is until the end, so you have to try your best at all times in order to push your win chance higher and gain MMR.  You can't let your teammates drag down your mentality."
TrueDoTA2,3di4ox,loveisdead,3,Fri Jul 17 13:58:16 2015 UTC,"You can continue to blame your team, but it won't get you anywhere.  A mistake doesn't only include the things you know you've done wrong. You can point out this that and the other thing that your teammates are doing that contributed to your loss, but if you want to improve you need to look at your play from the perspective of someone with a higher MMR than you. This includes things like understanding the proper laning dance you must perform to outlane your opponent, understanding the ins and outs of your lane matchup intimately, taking the best route at all times in any situation, engaging in fights from the trees when possible, and timing the exact moment you should engage playing as the carry. You need to learn what things you are doing wrong that you aren't already aware of."
TrueDoTA2,3di4ox,Monsieur_Skeltal,0,Fri Jul 17 13:55:31 2015 UTC,"Of all the things I've said that lose me games, most of the time it's the carry. While their carry free farms top, ours decides to teamfight, and if I ask them to get back to farming, I'm met either with a ""go fuck yourself"" or a ""que? Espagnol por favor."" Then we lose no matter how hard I snowball. I have actually had to 1 v 5 to get racks, no exaggeration because their team play is better. Thank god windranger is bullshit enough that it's possible this patch."
TrueDoTA2,3di4ox,_tpyo,3,Fri Jul 17 14:28:49 2015 UTC,"The entire point of my post was to focus on yourself and the things you can do, NOT your teammates."
TrueDoTA2,3di4ox,loveisdead,0,Fri Jul 17 14:41:09 2015 UTC,"And I'm saying sometimes it's unwinnable because of your team. For me it's been a lot of times in rapid succession, and that's unfortunate."
TrueDoTA2,3di4ox,Monsieur_Skeltal,3,Fri Jul 17 15:30:19 2015 UTC,"this is such nonsense. I always play hardcore support so I'm reliant on my team to a reasonable extent. I'm now 3.6k and have an over 70% win rate in the current patch.  Perhaps the following axiom might help: 10% of your games are unwinnable, 10% of your games are free wins. Its the remaining 80% that you have to win for yourself. So stop classifying some of that 80% as that 10% you can't win."
TrueDoTA2,3di4ox,loveisdead,-1,Fri Jul 17 19:26:01 2015 UTC,"It is absolutely not ""unfortunate."" You receive the same chance to win as everyone else that plays dota. Fortune or luck has no relevance to yours or anyone else's MMR. As I have already written, some percentage of games you will always win, others you will always lose, and its the majority percentage in the middle that you are aiming to influence. If you are not able to influence enough games to push you above 50% winrate, and gain MMR, the fault is your own.  If you flip a coin four times and manage to get heads 3/4 times, that's lucky. If you flip it 1000 times and you don't get ~50% heads/tails, you are doing something wrong."

I've never played carries (as you can tell from my dotabuff I played a lot of support before starting to play axe). And I'm loving it. Farming as AM is really fun, and my friends doesn't mind me trying it out because they are sick of my axe lol.

I've lost like 400 mmr by avoiding my good one, but i think it's worth it.  I should also note that playing other lanes has made my gyro much better and I could probably boost my mmr much higher than before now that I'm decent with a few other heroes."

And let's face it, you're not going to sway people who believe otherwise, because you can't quantify any of these points aside from the score people take offense with, unless you actually start analyzing your replays, which most people don't.  All that happens with these is a bunch of self-congratulatory comments, one or two ""no no but MY team.."" anecdotes and.. then someone else will make the same post again. Maybe do an MMR experiment.  Much like how people shouldn't worry so much about MMR, perhaps people should not worry so much about other people worrying about MMR? Yeah occassionally someone will post a rant about how unfair the system is and then everyone will fall over themselves to tell them these things. And that should be it. Don't worry, those few won't drown out the thousands of dank memes we get every week. We're good."
TrueDoTA2,3di4ox,SavageRS,8,Thu Jul 16 18:51:50 2015 UTC,"I'm more interested in making some form of stock response to the whining 'MMR is broken' threads, kinda like the intolerable bot and 'I'm new, need tips' threads.   That's why I asked for ways to refine the post, to make it more broad and applicable to those threads.   You're right though, nothing new, nothing ground breaking to drastically change mindsets. This is actually exemplified perfectly in this thread with people missing the point, disagreeing and bringing up extraneous variables like boosting accounts.   To that end, what would you add or change?"
TrueDoTA2,3di4ox,NikoIa,3,Thu Jul 16 19:08:30 2015 UTC,"Fair enough and I do appreciate your effort, just not sure it will actually diminish the ""problem"".   I feel the biggest issue is that they can read the points, but they can't identify them in their own play. I'm not near good enough, but something that'd be great would be actual examples or maybe something on match/replay analysis. I think Purge did something to that extent at some point (and he does do the commentaries, though those are often in jest), but these discussions tick him off too these days (on stream anyway). Something of that ilk however.  I personally feel I learned a lot about how to play from watching competitive Dota and streams and such and mistakes are pointed out there, but those people are pros making pro mistakes. How to filter that down to the frustrations of the pub/trench level though, that'd be the real trick."

I maintained this level even when my internet got really bad and had me at 800-900 ms ping every game.  After going on a huge losing streak (not sure why) I dropped down to 2.5k and have been stuck here for the last 3 months. I play the same way I do in 4.5k but win-rate remains the same.

TrueDoTA2,3di4ox,WellHungMan,4,Thu Jul 16 15:45:53 2015 UTC,Yes of course they do. But big win streaks happen just as often. You will always have an average that you will come back to. And yes experimenting will definitely lose you mmr. And remember each hero you play are on different skill levels as well. I have only a handful of heroes that I would feel successful with at 4.5k.

TrueDoTA2,3di4ox,Hurm4,2,Thu Jul 16 15:19:54 2015 UTC,"Well, I feel that at the start of every game my team needs observer wards, sentry/dust if invis hero, courier, smoke (if possible).

TrueDoTA2,3di4ox,Lazarous86,5,Thu Jul 16 15:41:44 2015 UTC,"Suck it up and buy the courier and wards if no one is going to do it. If you're so much better than the players around you, you can afford the early game gold deficit."
TrueDoTA2,3di4ox,soprof,2,Thu Jul 16 18:16:20 2015 UTC,"Sure I do, you can see it in the game I posted. I bought courier, wards, sentries, and gave my mid two tangoes."
TrueDoTA2,3di4ox,feralminded,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:24:58 2015 UTC,You don't need sentries from the start at 2.5k MMR. Sharing tangos is a waste too because your mid will be awful anyway.  You'll probably have more success if you buy less support items and focus more on your item progression.
TrueDoTA2,3di4ox,phob,2,Fri Jul 17 02:24:28 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I'll try this. I just feel that I should play as a >4K support to be consistent, but I guess it just shows that I'm not flexible enough to adjust to my teammates."
TrueDoTA2,3di4ox,feralminded,4,Fri Jul 17 07:03:58 2015 UTC,"If you can't win doing that then find what does let you win and do that instead.   Try going offlane. Centaur, clockwerk, bristleback it doesn't matter. Buy a tango, a salve, a stout shield, 2 branches and a ward. That's 610 gold. Now run off out of the base. GO. RUN. Run out of the base so fast you're not even in consideration when the team needs someone to buy courier.   'Bristle can you bu... oh, he's already gone.'  Block the pull camp with your ward and try for the rune. Ok now just don't die. If the support is missing, hang back. If you can get cs, do so, but DON'T DIE.   You don't need a courier. Boots? Sideshop. Magic stick? Sideshop. Blademail? Sideshop.  Carry a tp! Tp to stop them killing your other lanes AND NOW YOU HAVE NO EXCUSE.   'Oh but my safelane died!' You could've been there.  'They ganked mid!' You could've been there.   There's no more feeding because you're saving the day.  Or just pick treant and don't even leave lane to save the day.

Smoke is a waste unless you can actually use it to get a kill or two, same with sentries or dust.  If you don't play support don't waste all your gold on support items."
TrueDoTA2,3di4ox,topsk,2,Fri Jul 17 02:29:11 2015 UTC,"Well said. To add another layer to your point, complaining about your MMR and begging for re-calibration is a reflection of a very common shortcoming - attitude.  For example, my roommate swears that the entire continent of South America has made it their goal to prevent him from ranking up. As long as he sees the game that way, he can never improve. Self-awareness is a great thing in real life and in DOTA, and can lead to a wealth of self improvement.  Step out of your comfort zone sometimes, empower your teammates and be positive and adaptable."
TrueDoTA2,3di4ox,phob,2,Thu Jul 16 21:19:15 2015 UTC,"I think what you are saying is true for an overall assessment, but you will have games that you can point one failed position that costs the rest of the team. I am not saying that has never been me, but it does happen. Someone is still calibrating and it costs you a game. Over time though it should work itself out. Overall, I feel playing a core is much higher change to win than not. I have had many games as supports where my cores just make terrible rotations or don't even carry TPs cost me Rax or even the game because of not doing the basics. So I stopped playing support because I felt I could impact the game more and hopefully raise my MMR."
TrueDoTA2,3di4ox,Magnets,4,Thu Jul 16 16:49:06 2015 UTC,"I got my 6k as a support, your own bias."
TrueDoTA2,3di4ox,feralminded,2,Fri Jul 17 12:07:39 2015 UTC,"My perception of what gets most people about MMR is in fact the grind.  There is only a fairly small percentage of people who can or will put the time into the game to find their true MMR because by it's very nature MMR requires a fairly large volume of ranked matches to properly calibrate.  Even a person who was dramatically misplaced (say a 5k who calibrated at 2k) can't expect to win more than ~70% of their matches at 2k (and that number will decline as they get closer to their real ranking).  Lets assume a 60% mean win rate over the course of a climb back to 5k, each game will move their MMR up an average of 5 points, which means it will take them 600 games to get back.  Hell even at 100% win rate it will take 120 games.  For a 5-10 games a week kind of player, that's 1-2 years in the former case, or 3-6 months in the latter.    I recognize and admit there's probably not too many 5k players, calibrating at 2k, who play 5-10 matches a week but it's easy to see where the anger/resent/frustration with MMR comes in and why people begin inventing false narratives (which is what the OP is describing).  As a player who plays 5-15 games a week, some of which I'd like to be casual/experimental/learning/drunk with friends ... I have at most 0-5 games a week to play ranked.  The current system is simply not built for me and I find it utterly frustrating and as a result rarely get myself to play any ranked at all despite the fact that I find the greater focus on higher level play and competitive thinking truly appealing.     For the record my first account calibrated at ~2.7k (currently ~2.8k) and then I made a smurf and calibrated at 4.3k.  Since my main account has all of my builds, friends, history, etc I prefer it but honestly considering taking my 2.8k to 4.3k is more or less untenable for me.  At my currently play rate it will take years.  Unfortunately this puts me in extremely awkward positions when I do play ranked and have to roll my eyes at the ridiculous stuff my teammates insist on doing and thus I'm left with nothing but salt in my mouth.  tldr; the current system just takes too long to find the appropriate mmr for anyone but a hardcore player to productively use.    or  My mmr is wrong and I'm bitter as fuck about it since I have a life and it's a massive pita to correct, and a massive pita to not correct."
TrueDoTA2,3di4ox,goblinbiddin,3,Thu Jul 16 20:21:27 2015 UTC,"Your made up winrates are too low.  Real data:  http://www.playdota.com/forums/showthread.php?t=1398477  Juice had a 95% winrate in the 3k bracket as a 5.6k player, and an 80% winrate in the 4k bracket."
TrueDoTA2,3di4ox,Infrisios,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:07:06 2015 UTC,"I appreciate the real data.  However a 95% winrate will still require 40-45 games to clear the 3k bracket and 80% will require 50 to clear 4k.  That's still ~100 games which is a non-trivial amount of games to someone with low volumes of play.  Also for less dramatic ranking differences we can expect the win rates to drop significantly, which exacerbates the issue I'm attempting to highlight here (volume of games required to find your real mmr).  I don't see any legitimate reasons why the mmr process has to be so slow.  I understand why it needs some level of pacing to prevent exploiting mmr to sell accounts but by the same token I feel punishing a large percentage of the population to prevent a minor issue isn't necessarily the right call.  In theory if you could find your real MMR in 1 game, and if accounts could not be sold, why wouldn't we want this?  The sooner everyone gets to where the games match their skill level the sooner we are all having an objectively better competitive experience, regardless of volume of play.  Of course the hardcore full time players will get higher mmrs than the casuals, but the system would work fine.  I understand grinding in games with monthly fees like WoW or whatever, but this is free to play and thus they have no financial incentive to put a carrot-on-the-stick grind.  Honestly the point of MMR isn't to have some exclusive thing, it's to get you better quality games tailored to your specific level of skill."
TrueDoTA2,3di4ox,soprof,2,Mon Jul 20 14:34:52 2015 UTC,"I agree with you. I wish Dota 2 used some version of TrueSkill (http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/trueskill/) which is a way to measure skill using both a mean AND variance.  The variance increases as you see surprising results, like winning an unfavored matchup or losing a favored matchup.  Uncertainty also increases as time passes without a measurement.  Then when it performs the mean updates, positive or negative, it makes larger steps when the uncertainty/variance is larger.  I don't know why Valve went with the system they have currently but it is pretty frustrating."

In fact, if you're already winning nearly all your games, it will barely affect it at since those games aren't scored."
TrueDoTA2,3di4ox,CDNRedditor,2,Sat Jul 18 08:48:09 2015 UTC,"Why don't you just play a few games on your 4.3k account and see if you win or lose?  A 4.3k player would have no problem getting from 2.8k to 3.5k, you should easily have 80% winrate."
TrueDoTA2,3di4ox,Magnets,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:24:41 2015 UTC,"I sometimes do when I get fed up with the quality of the games on my main account and I have roughly a 50% win rate there since calibration (go figure).  My win rate on my 2.8k account for the last 25 or so games (all the ranked I've played this calendar year on that account) is ~55% ... which is frustratingly low.  Again my point is that the current system is setup to require hundreds of games minimum.  That's fine for hardcore dedicated players or people who want only to play ranked but for someone like me (and I imagine I am not alone here) who plays roughly 500 games a year, most of which are screwing around with friends or whatnot, being able to dedicate at most ~100 games a year to ranked means I'll never see my MMR move and will always be relegated to playing at the rank I settled on ~2 years ago now (2 years ago I didn't even build wands because I was afraid of items with active abilities).      I mean I get it, this is awfully woe-is-me and probably doesn't apply to many people who use reddit (I imagine most of the people here play a much higher volume than a casual like me), but it would be nice for casuals to have a competitive option tailored to us.  I recognize my skill cannot be as high as higher volume players but it still can be pretty damned high as volume of play is not the only determining factor when it comes to ability."
TrueDoTA2,3di4ox,CDNRedditor,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:21:35 2015 UTC,"I think you said it perfectly at the beginning,  mmr is a reflection of your ability to win games.  You get it by winning games and you lose it by failing to win games. If you think you're better than your mmr suggests, play a bunch. If it doesn't go up, you need to work on your play.  If it does go up, you still need to work on your play. Everyone does. If you do this effectively your mmr will go up.  It's not useful as a dick measuring tool. It shows you when you're improving at the only skill in dota that really matters: winning games."
TrueDoTA2,3di4ox,Elux91,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:36:55 2015 UTC,"Totally correct. This is a completely different point of view on the same case, but many people called me a bad mid player because they ""won the mid"" against me, but when I did 3 successful ganks I might have given the mid enough space to ""win"" against me, but made all their other lanes lose big time (the joy of playing 4-4-0 Tinker in a march meta...).  Still, some people generally are in an mmr too high/low for them. Bad luck, incompatible teammates and other factors can probably throw it off by a few hundred points."
TrueDoTA2,3di4ox,Elux91,1 point,Fri Jul 17 08:34:27 2015 UTC,"You consider the game as a system which gets affected by your input. If the input you do is better than the ""default"" one - your impact is positive, and vice versa. Minimize any negative input, maximize positive input. Input includes everything, every decision you make and play you do, any chat message you write, any assistance you provide to your teammates, like pings or even the direction where your hero is faced. Could write more but you got the idea. Break-down everything you do ingame and refine it."

To my surprise, researching my past games actually paid off, as my W/L since I started this project has been 20/1, gaining me about 500 MMR. The big secrets I found were:  -Playing heroes that are strong at every stage of the game.  For me this was Shadow Fiend and Storm Spirit since I like either mid or safelane carry positions, but the same idea can be applied to other positions as well. If you truly are better than the players around you, you can use these heroes to dominate early and keep employing that advantage throughout the game without being dependent on another player to take control when the game changes stages.  -Finding the good communicators. When I play US East, it seems like around half of the players in my games actually speak English. Whenever I get into a new game I try to identify who these players are as fast as possible and attempt to strategize with them. Sometimes these people end up being super toxic and I have to mute them, but more often than not we can coordinate picks, ganks, and team fights that push our team super far ahead, or we can dig ourselves out of a loss by playing smart and coming back. The key is to communicate with people who are capable of it, as even if you are playing a hero strong at all stages of the game, Dota is a team game, and teamwork is always more powerful than any single hero."

Go into unranked and play a different role. Play a group of similar heroes and only them and get better at them. Play qop or storm or leshrac mid. Play bristle or clock or cent offlane. Play jugg or slark or pa safelane. Make good decisions. Pick for the team. Get good at more roles so you can fill the gaps in the team.

TrueDoTA2,3di4ox,-SlickN,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:37:15 2015 UTC,"You tell me. I did some searching and I found his teammates - they also interchange nicknames, and they mostly play in ""high"" bracket. No steam community profile, no games prior to last month.  With this other guy, I raped their offlaner so hard, he abandoned the game, leaving slark in freefarm mode. We played 4v5 for 60 minutes and couldn't close because he was that bad - you don't have this sort of farm in this skill bracket and game scenario, nor do you have this low APM. I checked his steam profile and he doesn't even have steam profile set up.  The third one was actually with y0nd - he was boosting and I could see myself on the stream."
TrueDoTA2,3di4ox,Ailodierap,3,Thu Jul 16 17:48:19 2015 UTC,"I'm not denying it happens, I'm saying I'm surprised that it's as prevalent as you say it is. But obviously I'm not in your situation and you're unlikely to be pulling numbers out of your ass.   I must ask though, if you were being truly subjective and not just firmly remembering the boosted accounts, is it enough to really affect your MMR?   Keeping in mind it's more likely he'll be on the other team. 4/10 chance on your team, 5/10 chance on the other team etc. That leshrac could've been boosted. Did you check his account too?  edit: I checked the leshrac. Not likely to be boosted. The point stands however. The easy wins you move on from quickly. The bad losses you dwell on."
TrueDoTA2,3di4ox,vraGG_,3,Thu Jul 16 18:14:41 2015 UTC,"I know what you mean.  Issue with this is that it's an anomaly and it's very inconsistent. One could get the guy boosting on his team 10 times, the other guy might get the original owners 10 times. That would make 500 MMR difference between these two guys, because in order to get a booster 10 times if it happens 1 in 20 games would be 200 games.  It makes damage two times - for each game the account is boosted, there will be roughly 5 to 10 games ruined by that player sucking hard losing the MMR in the process.  It could very well sway people's games very much.  As far as I am concerned - I feel that I am far superior then most players I played with in the past. Hence I climbed 1000 mmr in last 3 months or so (that should be around 200 games or so).  I don't like climbing, so I would prefer not to, but rather be placed where I belong initially. And it annoys me that I have to deal with the boosters and boosted accounts that much, as it delays me. Whenever there is a boosted account on my team, or a booster on enemy's, I am likely to lose 2 hours worth of time (+25-25+25, queues, drafts)."

Or if force is particularly useful to help allies, like against Skywrath Mage, Lifestealer, Timbersaw."
TrueDoTA2,3dk76g,mjjdota,3,Fri Jul 17 19:55:19 2015 UTC,"It's too situational to say that you need any of these item timings. Sometimes maelstrom first is the right choice versus high armor targets and sometimes straight Aghs is the right choice to tank thorugh mid game nukes.  I personally have been picking windranger safe lane when I am given the option and getting a fast shadow blade.   It's also what slasher has been doing in pubs.  It makes sense. It's halfway between a damage item and a blink dagger and is a safe tool. It also reminds me of how strong windrunner is without maelstrom or Aghs early.   It's no replacement for blink, but blink is more necessary if you're playing an early mid game where you have low farm but need shackles."
TrueDoTA2,3dk76g,wildtarget13,2,Fri Jul 17 01:13:55 2015 UTC,"Maelstrom into blink and then aghs+daed will cripple your transition to lategame. Blink is core depending on the enemy team, like if they have an ember or tinker. Windrun and phase boots in combination with using fog to your advantage should allow you to catch anyone off guard or escape.  Get blink first if you need to fight often. Get aghs and then into blink if the enemy can't react to you taking towers. Also, you can easily clear creep waves with your powershot. Hit melee creeps to 65% hp, the ranged once, then W."
TrueDoTA2,3dk76g,luminere,2,Thu Jul 16 23:25:23 2015 UTC,"Timing or order of your item build is dependent on what you plan to be doing, which obviously depends on the team make ups. There is no set order. You can Aghs first, Blink > Aghs, Point Booster > Blink > Aghs, etc.  1) Maelstrom is the most cost efficient DPS for WR's ult pre-Aghs because of the orb, but it falls off post-Aghs and it is not something you want filling item slots late game as it is not worth upgrading to Mjollnir. Get it early or not at all, and if you plan on getting Aghs (as most core WR's do) I would go Deso instead. Mael is ok for a support or offlane WR who is poor and doesn't have many spare item slots but still wants to increase the impact of their ult.  2) A fast Aghs primary benefit is pressuring towers, so if you plan on focusing on split pushing early Aghs first is a solid choice.  3) Blink or SB helps you gank, position yourself in teamfights for shackle and also to escape ganks, so it is pretty useful no matter what you do.  4) Daed as your first major DPS item is not good. It actually has the around the same DPS/cost as Deso (depending on the targets armor, which at this stage of the game is low and favors Deso), except Deso's orb helps you push towers and also increases your allies DPS on those targets. Deso should be the first DPS item of choice after Aghs. You can build Daed (or MKB) after that if needed."
TrueDoTA2,3dk76g,Skyro620,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:37:59 2015 UTC,What about blink and deso before aghs to be more useful in early game? is that ok or is blink mael aghs crit better for pickoff play
TrueDoTA2,3dk76g,Optictrolls,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:36:44 2015 UTC,"A lot of the benefit from Aghs first is the build-up that beefs WR up vs. magic damage. This is why you might see WR's build PB and/or Ogre Club and then get other items before completing Aghs. It's game dependent, but going straight into Blink and Deso and trying to gank w/o any HP items is probably not a good idea in most scenarios.  WR also doesn't really have much kill potential until she maxes shackle. Your focus prior to lv11 should be primarily to farm and pressure undefended lanes."
TrueDoTA2,3dk76g,Skyro620,2,Tue Jul 21 19:10:34 2015 UTC,"Just get blink after aghs, with just phase and a < 20 min aghs you still rape without a crystalys. And i agree, blink is great on wr."
TrueDoTA2,3dk76g,RampagingRagE,1 point,Fri Jul 17 09:22:09 2015 UTC,I usually go aghs > blink > daedalus > sheepstick.  The game is usually over when you get daedalus though
TrueDoTA2,3dk76g,popgalveston,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:49:31 2015 UTC,"As others have said, only get maelstrom if you can get shackles on the enemy without the blink, because you're not gonna be getting both. IMO maelstrom is a kill item more than a farming item on WR, so that's why I'd skip blink, they serve the same purpose. You can kill anyone if you get both items early, but you will not carry.  If your preferred build is aghs daedalus, you should get Maelstrom if the enemy is kiteable or you have set ups for your shackle, and blink if you really need to initiate. If you are aiming to be a midgame powerhouse, get both maelstrom and blink and try to snowball hard. I'd skip the daedalus aghs after that and go all utility though.  Whichever item you go, you should be getting kills. WR is not a farmer at all, powershot can wave clear, but jungling is actually pretty slow and you can't do ancients at all. So you're a bad position 1, despite your amazing dps. As a core WR, I'd say your aim is to snowball with your really strong set of skills.  Keep in mind if the enemy is very slippery or will not give you the chance to get your ult off on them (fat nukers that burst you down, bkb+evasion), consider other items like hex, force staff, orchid, necrobook or maybe even lotus orb (if the game calls for it). Everyone gets a boner for her max atk speed, but I much prefer a utility WR. You can blink force staff for the perfect shackle and hex someone else, then windrun out. That's a won teamfight if your team is ready"
TrueDoTA2,3dk76g,undatedseapiece,1 point,Fri Jul 17 08:45:56 2015 UTC,I played a lot of wind before and when she got really strong these last 2 patches I have been playing her more than anyone now.  I usually go Aghs > Daed/Deso (if needed for push) and I think I might start getting a blink after aghs. I don't think you can not get aghs first right now. The item is just too good. You get so much out of it and you need to get the point booster early anyway.
TrueDoTA2,3dk76g,maximum_wages,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:08:02 2015 UTC,Youll need either maelstorm or blink before Aghs to be truly efficient. I wouldnt recomend getting both though. I prefer Maelstorm most of the time though since it allows you to farm ridcoulously fast. Maelstorm will only delay your aghs timing by 4-5 minutes or so and the AOE (damage) in a teamfight shouldnt be ignored either. Also when are you really going to throw more than 1 ult per minute before the 30 minute mark and have the mana to sustain it?
TrueDoTA2,3dk76g,sintoras2,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:37:58 2015 UTC,"maelstrom into aghs seems kind of a waste, Maelstorm is so good because the proc damage isn't reduced by her ult but if you are getting a fast aghs then ~25 minutes in that maelstrom is no better than any other damage item you could have grabbed. even a crystalys would be better."
TrueDoTA2,3dk76g,twersx,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:05:16 2015 UTC,Disagree. It is actually a farming item that has the benefits of beeing an amazing dps item on windrunner. You see RTZ regularly go back to a maelstorm after aghs even. Its just too good to pass on.
TrueDoTA2,3dk76g,sintoras2,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:14:11 2015 UTC,"I like casual point booster into blink, gives you some nice mana and hp"
TrueDoTA2,3dk76g,TheMoeBlob,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:52:19 2015 UTC,"I don't like deso because if you get it after aghs it has already fallen off its peak damage point. I like MKB over buriza because the ministun and higher dps vs buildings. I have not had good luck with maelstorm on WR in general...  Blink is good, but I see it as more of a luxury item after aghs+mkb. The main reason I like WR is cuz she can destroy Towers so fast and rapidly kill one hero. I don't need blink to land good shackle+ults."
TrueDoTA2,3dk76g,Dat_Speed,-1,Fri Jul 17 22:25:36 2015 UTC,"treads for survive, then an early maelstrom to use your ult to get early T1s and farm a fast blink.  after aghs is normally my core, into straight DPS items."
TrueDoTA2,3djn0u,BuffKunkka,30,Thu Jul 16 20:23:25 2015 UTC,this is a huge buff. how often do you really have a full duration CM ult? completely cutting the mana cost in half at all levels would be a smaller buff than what you're suggesting.

As long as you have someone who can solo, and your carry is able to farm. From level 1 frostbite does 1000 damage to creeps, so you can farm large creep camps from the start. Obviously don't just afk jungle; ward, deward, stack, gank etc. I also like to max aura first so I'm helping the team even when I'm just farming the jungle creeps. Admittedly I'm 2.5k trash atm, so this may stop being viable at higher skill levels!"
TrueDoTA2,3djn0u,dobberchops88,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:50:42 2015 UTC,"Jungle cm is great if and only if your carry is farming the lane well.

TrueDoTA2,3djn0u,_tpyo,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:46:55 2015 UTC,"I think the wand is a better choice because the wand charges are usually needed to survive fights or get off all of your spells. Bracer is out-dated for supports I think because +4 to all stats is better than +6 STR, +3 AGI and INT. Every team should get an Urn, but I usually let someone else get it since CM definitely needs some more INT.  I don't really see how Blink Dagger fails at pushing compared to any other common CM items. If anything you can back off faster when you push lanes with Blink Dagger (for the same reason Nature's Prophet get Blink)."
TrueDoTA2,3djn0u,CNHphoto,2,Fri Jul 17 23:26:53 2015 UTC,"I don't really see how Blink Dagger fails at pushing compared to any other common CM items   Its the lack of stats (blink gives none) that results (depending on level too) in the amount of auto-attacks required to kill creeps following crystal nova on a fresh wave. With something that confers stats (e.g. forcestaff) you're reducing that. I mean its not essential, you don't really want to be pushing out waves as CM but sooner or later you're going to end up in a situation where pushing a lane is the best thing to be doing making force an arguably better ""all-round"" pickup."

TrueDoTA2,3djn0u,CNHphoto,2,Sat Jul 18 00:51:22 2015 UTC,its just another reason to choose force over blink. There are better reasons (i.e. blink cancellation and the ability to save team mates) and it depends on the game to an extent (e.g. clock/riki). I personally don't find the disadvantages of force (significant delay in travel speed/range and choice of direction) bad enough to want to choose blink instead in the majority of cases.

The meta relies on rotations and pickoffs right now, which is something she is terrible at early game due to her slow move speed. A meta relying on lane control and zoning an offlaner is where she succeeds, as she can constantly harass and zone a laner with her q and w, same reason Lion isn't a top pick but hasn't seen much nerfs to show for his lack of picks.  Her ult is balanced around requiring that much mana, so you need to build int on her to even cast q, w, and her ult in a short period of time. If you take that away and allow her to be able to cast all three easily, she'll be very strong."

Making it have no upfront cost is too good.  That said, CM's problem is definitely not her ult. All her spells are really good as they are. The problem is the body they come with. CM is basically the worst body you can find. Generally lousy stat gains with terrible base stats and lousy armor, not to mention garbage move speed.  If she needs a buff, I think some move speed, base armor, str gain or base damage would impact her more."

A few patches ago he was given this buff to allow him to harass better in lane as well as move more easily for positioning his tether slow and his spirit bombs. He wasn't designed around this instant turn rate, I suspect it was an afterthought. As you can see, the impact of zero turnrate is so little that you didn't even know it was already being utilized in the game.  Lots of people have been experimenting with broken vision as the next unique concept for a hero design. I believe one hero was a sand nomad like hero who gained bonus damage when attacking from fog and could summon dunes to create artificial high grounds.   Edit: Some words cuz' I'm on mobile.  Edit2: Apparently I was wrong. IO does in fact have a turn rate of 0.7. I was mistaken because he can cast skills and attack enemies regardless of orientation, which is very close to no turn rate, but not quite. :)"

TrueDoTA2,3dml9o,Schematix7,8,Fri Jul 17 14:54:45 2015 UTC,"You can do anything ya want. The sky is the limit. The issue you address is balancing.(and probably interest, boring heroes are boring) Anything can be strong, but I seriously doubt that a non-existent turn rate will single handedly make a hero strong. If your question is solely whether or not that could be the core concept then I would say yes. You could make a hero that is always moving in a single direction, but could instantly change direction when not stunned. This means if you stun the hero they keep moving in a direction. Or this hero only deals damage to targets they're facing (like the opposite of Stone Gaze). Or the hero has a bowling ball move similar to Earth Spirit that you can control with instant turn rate. There isn't a limit to your imagination, so you will have to provide some sort of restriction in order to form something real. Only then can you talk about viability or plausability.

TrueDoTA2,3dgtdp,pewpewlasors,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:14:08 2015 UTC,glass cannon doesn't really work after 30~35 min where the carries start to come out...

I am also referring to pubs where supports will probably not try and save you...
TrueDoTA2,3dgtdp,CayCayDog,13,Thu Jul 16 05:36:46 2015 UTC,"After a Deso you get a BKB.  It is the best survival item for clinkz due to that it lets you dish out damage without being chain stunned.  Your Q will be maxed at that point, so you have 10 seconds of strafe and around a 10 sec bkb charge. 10 seconds later everyone is dead.  Hence why his build right now is pretty much this 99% of the time:  RoA,  Treads, Soul Ring, Deso, BKB.  CLinkz does not need a large HP item because your ult give you a skadi/heart when you eat a huge creep.   Clinkz is not a team fight initiator, just stay invis till the whole team is targeted, then target there glass canon, before they noticed your tank is at 50% hp and there team is dead.  Also, you can not life steal off Searing Arrows(main damage in early stages). If you want HP, get Ultimate Orb items like a manta or a linkens after bkb or mkb."

TrueDoTA2,3dgtdp,pbmonster,1 point,Thu Jul 16 08:32:28 2015 UTC,What's your opinion on rushing Orchid after Treads instead of RoA and Soul Ring? I buy that situationally against high mobility lineups and supports with good disables.
TrueDoTA2,3dgtdp,CayCayDog,5,Thu Jul 16 11:17:57 2015 UTC,Bad for this meta. Deso just increases your DPS by so much more.  The only times I would is if their main carry is QoP or SS or lesh.
TrueDoTA2,3dgtdp,pbmonster,-1,Thu Jul 16 15:21:31 2015 UTC,"Mh, I don't think the DPS difference is so significant.  Orchid stays on for 5 seconds, and I'd argue that Clinkz doesn't really need more time to blow somebody up. Souldburn does 30% damage amplification.  Depending on victim armor, that is right around the damage amp -7 armor would give you (12-->5 armor is ~24%, 7-->-1 armor is ~33%).  And Deso's +50dmg isn't so much better than +30dmg +30 attack speed from Orchid.  Sure, Deso is much better after Orchid has run out, and Orchid doesn't boost your push as much as Deso does, but I always felt the Utility of Orchid makes up for that.  Also, in the Treats-> Orchid -> Deso build, the Deso comes only ~2000 gold later than Aquila -> Treats -> Soul Ring -> Deso..."
TrueDoTA2,3dgtdp,Drop_,4,Thu Jul 16 15:46:23 2015 UTC,"This isn't right.  Damage differential is huge.    First, deso is -7 armor not -8.    Going from 7 armor to 0 armor means the damage taken goes from 70.4% to 100%.  That is actually a ~42% damage amp (100/70).   Going from 12 to 5 armor is a 32% damage amp.    People routinely under-estimate the impact of deso.  It's significantly better than you've estimated here.   It's also about kill potential.  Deso gives you better kill potential against any enemy that isn't a blink/escape based enemy.    Orchid is 4075.  Orchid + Treads Clinkz means you pick up deso at 8925 gold essentially.  Aquilia + Soul Ring + Treads means deso significantly sooner 6660.  2300 gold is a lot sooner.    And your kill potential with aquila + treads + deso is a LOT higher than when you would be sitting on treads and orchid only.    Orchid is good situationally.  You're up against qop, weaver, maybe BH, orchid is really a solid pickup.   Comparing the damage amp from orchid to deso is no contest, really.  Orchid works out to a 22.5% damage amp.  a 30% damage added in magic gets cut down to 22.5% by magic resistance.   The damage amp from deso is essentially a real damage amp for how much it adds.  So when deso amps damage by 30% you're dealing 30% more damage.  For the damage amp of Orchid to be bigger than Deso you would need targets to be at 21 armor or higher.  That doesn't generally happen and doesn't happen until the lategame.   Finally, the deso not only means more damage versus heroes in general, but more in terms of jungle speed, in terms of pushing speed, and in terms of creep clearing speed.  And even changing targets in a teamfight.  You only get to silence once per fight, essentially, but you can apply the deso debuff to any target you want on demand.    Finally, the aquila + deso damage of 68 with 9 agi attack speed is pretty significant compared to the 30/30 from orchid."

TrueDoTA2,3dgtdp,CayCayDog,2,Thu Jul 16 22:35:28 2015 UTC,"Bad for this meta.   Think team fights, they are popular this meta. People drop faster then 5 seconds in team fights, and the faster you drop someone the faster you can target the next. Also minus Armour can go on your next target in which everyone can use the minus amour debuff. Orchids damage amp is useless in team fights.  Orchids amp comes after 5second. If you try to gank a right clicker then you can die in that window, example being viper.   Orchids amp also only works on one enemy at a time and not towers."

Orchid doesnt make me burst enemies down. Orchid doesnt let me crush towers. Orchid doesnt make me one shot creeps at 16 when split pushing.  When you face a storm spirit he will get an euls, which is still a great cost efficient item on him. When you face an antimage, he will get a manta. When you face a qop, she will rish a bkb or a eul herself, and you will have a useless garbage 4k item that gives you nothing.

What are your timings, what exactly you struggle with, how do you lane it...  Anyway, I refuse to give any other answer to a half arsed post."
TrueDoTA2,3dgtdp,RampagingRagE,2,Thu Jul 16 11:12:20 2015 UTC,"Yea, I read that and came up with this question.  Look if you don't want to contribute that's fine and I don't see how MMR, timing and struggles got to do with a simple ""what do you prefer"" question.  My take on after reading that guide is. Yes in that guide the writers ""preference is deso"". If we are solely comparing HotD and deso of course without doubt that deso wins out (it cost more and a is higher tier too)  However, is the writer taking into account that with LS you can also get skadi? In this case that you will be more tank, has some form of CC and have a reliable sustain when in team fights even in the later stage of the game.  Lifesteal and cold/poison is the only item orbs that stack and it gives a lot of utility. Yes Deso can secure early game dominance and farming one is not hard (normally within 12 min even) but the advantage falls off quick.  The Pros/cons of going deso:  Con: after ~20min teams are mostly grouped up making picking out heros a lot harder..   Con: you have simply 0 sustain if an enemy team mate arrives with detection as you are gunning one down. You can at most trade 1 for 1 in this situation  Con: no form of CC can be bought  Pro: most supports take you 3~4 shots to kill and even tanks will only take 8~10 shots... (this is very important)  Pro: Mid game dominance as not many heroes can survive more than a few seconds against you. Also helps lower armor for other team mates to deal more dmg  Pros and cons of Lifesteal (HoTD)  Con: Lesser dominance in mid game due to lower dmg.. People (even supports) can still get away  Con: Does not help the team in anyway  Con: lower dmg also means lower farm and longer split pushes  Pro: Bring along lunch for Death pact up time  Pro: Much more sustain than Deso, can even buy a skadi for a slow cc later"
TrueDoTA2,3dgtdp,BuffKunkka,2,Fri Jul 17 04:08:31 2015 UTC,"Skadi is not a mid game item. You need a ton of other items. You need damage. You need a vyse. You need bkb. You need Real utility. Skadi doesnt give cc.  Desolator does not fall off at 20 minutes. Desolator is great on team fight, where you need to take off quickly enemy supports. Desolator is mostly needed to quickly destroy towers, thing that you keep not keeping in mond.  Clinkz is not just a pick off hero. He is mostly a great split pusher and tower eater. HotD gives you nothing in that regard, and a skadi rush is just retarded.  Using hotd to eat creeps kills your farm. You lose up to 2400 every 30 minutes, not taking in consideration exp.  I dont understand why you need lifesteal for sustain, you ulti is more than enough. It heals you when you use it and when it expires, clinkz main issue is mana management which forces you to fountain way more often than hp issues will ever do.  I didnt in depth talk about skadi in my guide because i took for granted that even 1kmmrs would understand that it is good on clinkz only in the super late game when you can just sell your deso...   I hope i have brought some clarity, sorry for typose, i am at work from my phone."
TrueDoTA2,3dgtdp,RampagingRagE,0,Fri Jul 17 08:55:49 2015 UTC,"I don't see how MMR, timing and struggles got to do with a simple ""what do you prefer"" question.   Some things work very well in some skill brackets, while they don't work in others at all (for example, heroes on their own). I wouldn't play batrider in low MMR range, but I also wouldn't play Ursa in high MMR solo queue. Same thing applies to laning and items.  That being said, our ""preferences"" also depend on our playstyle. A classic example is my weaver play, which I dare to claim is really good and I shape my buildup according to it. And often, it comes down to what enemy has and what I want to do. While I think 90% of the games Linken is a poor choice, sometimes it is necessary.  Same with clinkz. What I feel is that you often need to adapt. I think it's viable to do is both deso OR hotd+MoC. It's just depending on the game, as you said yourself. I think Solar crest is one of the strongest items available right now, so that is awesome too.  I think that MoC + HotD is superior for general purpose, but Deso is stronger for splitpushing (reducing tower armor).  The main thing about these two builds is the level to control it. If you can pull off using MoC and everything clinkz has efficiently, I think it's equally strong build, if not better in most situations."

TrueDoTA2,3dgtdp,maddotard,0,Fri Jul 17 08:41:30 2015 UTC,"Granted I'm terrible at Clinkz but I'm not seeing MoM mentioned anywhere in this thread.  Gives you pushing capability like deso (not as much granted), if you use it during the fade time on skeleton walk you get the MS in the invis, and heaps of extra AS for ganks.  I'm not saying it's better than deso, in fact I think the armor reduction and damage are more useful, and as has been mentioned elsewhere in this thread satanic is a good late game item on the little fella which naturally, MoM doesn't build into.  Also Clinkz isn't a real hard carry, beyond 35 mins in an even, decently skilled game (that wasn't a complete bloodbath in that the carries have real CS), most of your time is going to be split pushing/dodging ganks rather than fighting. You are partially correct in saying glass cannon doesn't work beyond the 30 minute mark, in that it doesn't; versus heroes, late game it's great for killing structures, sneaky rax, base race etc. Drow is a good example of this (and importantly(?) a hero I can actually play), dodge fights, let your team deal with their heroes, you hit buildings. Given Clinkz is better at hitting heroes than Drow their late game role is quite similar.  Also we need a hero made of glass that just does damage.

TrueDoTA2,3dgtdp,EDJE,2,Fri Jul 17 11:29:44 2015 UTC,"The main reason why you build damage item is because with strafe you have enough ias, and damage items just come with better amplifications (minus armor, crits, true strike).  In general assault cuirass and butterfly are good items, but you dont get them early on. And yes, mana is the second best reason, i guess"

TrueDoTA2,3dfn3q,PepperJohn,60,Wed Jul 15 22:06:43 2015 UTC,No turn rate is the reason theres no melee carry in LoL since ranged carry can kite them all day.You will feel the presence of the turn rate if you come from LoL or HoN before playing Dota.
TrueDoTA2,3dfn3q,Azrnpride,14,Wed Jul 15 22:37:50 2015 UTC,"Exactly. The reason people like Tryndamere are broken in League is because they were meant to be melee carries, yet to compete with ranged carries they were given incredibly powerful abilities, which turned out to work very well in other lanes."
TrueDoTA2,3dfn3q,SystemPeanut,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:18:25 2015 UTC,Can confirm. I played League for 2 years before switching to Dota and for the first few months the turn rate was the biggest turn off for Dota.   It made the game feel real sluggish and laggy but I eventually got used to it. You would seriously notice it if it was gone.
TrueDoTA2,3dfn3q,raize777,26,Tue Jul 21 02:11:52 2015 UTC,"I like turn rates, they allow for interesting mechanics. you have to actually have better mechanics to kite certain heroes, It allows creep and hero blocking as well as letting providing fun abilities like sticky napalm, you have to actually play around the skill, not only because of the damage amp, but because the turn rate slow makes a huge difference."
TrueDoTA2,3dfn3q,ferret_80,18,Wed Jul 15 22:42:18 2015 UTC,One thing no-one seems to have brought up is that this makes positioning in team fights more important. Against certain heroes coming smoking in from behind can buy up maybe even an extra second that makes a big difference in team fights. Having to turn adds this little bit of dimension that makes fights far more interesting in my opinion.
TrueDoTA2,3dfn3q,WildKaisu,8,Thu Jul 16 05:06:28 2015 UTC,"As long as they enjoy only having ranged carries, let it be. It has been like 5 or 6 years and they are not bored so I guess it is ok for them."
TrueDoTA2,3dfn3q,lychenus,8,Thu Jul 16 03:35:16 2015 UTC,"Everyone pretty much covered the gameplay benefits of turn rates here so I won't adress them, but I want to point the primary reason units have turn rates: it makes everything look better.  It's an elementary animation principle that for a character to be well-animated, his movement must always reflect his weight. Inertia is what makes a virtual character feel tangible. That's why videogame and CG artists will spend so much effort animating flabby parts or adding a cloud of dust when a heavy character falls; It may look like small details, but without them the spectator's suspension of disbelief will be broken very quickly.  In Warcraft 3, turn rates weren't only there to prevent endless kiting, they were also there to make the game look good. Each unit actually had two different turn mechanics: the entity one, which governs movement, angle of attack, etc, and the cosmetic one, which was about rotating the visual 3D model to catch up to the real entity orientation. Jakiro, for example, had a normal entity turn rate, but a very slow visual one, to really portray the massiveness of a double-headed dragon. DOTA2 is even better as they can use blended animations to portray things like Mirana's tiger turning its head before its body.   All this to say that when you see a behemoth doing instant 180 U-turns multiple times per second while casting spells, it's not even that it doesn't feel real, it just feels cheap."
TrueDoTA2,3dfn3q,splaza,3,Fri Jul 17 14:00:45 2015 UTC,"Other comments have mentioned this but they haven't fully explained it. If they didn't have turn rates it would be super easy to kite melee carries. As a ranged hero, you could run from a melee carry, turn 180, shoot at him, turn 180, run, turn, shoot, turn, run. So slow melee carries without ranged CC would be completely useless. In dota, you have to have a significant speed advantage to kite them."
TrueDoTA2,3dfn3q,yitzaklr,-2,Thu Jul 16 04:26:03 2015 UTC,"So slow melee carries without ranged CC would be completely useless   That makes them different, since the weakness is then addressed in their kit."
TrueDoTA2,3dfn3q,Darkenetor,2,Thu Jul 16 05:11:36 2015 UTC,"But it would force all melee carries to have a kit that has either high speed or ranged CC. Turn rates allow a wider variety of melee carries, like Ursa and Lone Druid."
TrueDoTA2,3dfn3q,yitzaklr,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:22:43 2015 UTC,"Well Lone Druid mostly uses its bear I think (never really played it), which is quite high on speed boosts and usually buys an OoV, and Ursa wants a Blink anyways. League ones are just more likely to have a dash—but that more of a game-wide thing—and the majority of them without ranged CC can buy a Trinity Force for the speed buff, a Blade of the Ruined King for a semi-ranged slow or the League equivalent of a Skadi if ahead, which are definitively not under par damaging options (aside from the Skadi of course), and fight with the help of an ally utilty skills and by flanking their opponents util having completed their items—just like an Ursa would."

TrueDoTA2,3dfn3q,TheBigBallsOfFury,3,Thu Jul 16 07:24:15 2015 UTC,"It only feels laggy because they're unfamiliar with it. I've played Dota/HoN for a long timee, then went over to LoL and then back to Dota 2 again but never felt they're 'laggy'. I guess if you play LoL on higher levels you're used to twitchy gameplay and the turnrates will affect you the most."
TrueDoTA2,3dfn3q,Dettelbacher,5,Thu Jul 16 11:29:26 2015 UTC,"I watched an EE stream the other day where he was playing Ember trying to kill a Faceless Void trying to escape. He already had a remnant out and landed a chains on FV. As he approached the FV, FV was facing away from him. When he got closer he was able to juke the inevitable Chronosphere by hitting his ult-jump as FV began to turn.  Turn rates add a huge level of depth to the game that I would completely miss if it where to be removed."
TrueDoTA2,3dfn3q,loveisdead,6,Thu Jul 16 21:41:45 2015 UTC,Gives the game more depth at the same limiting skill cap.
TrueDoTA2,3dfn3q,genetalgiant,2,Wed Jul 15 22:29:04 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure it limits skill cap. Yes, you remove skills like walking backwards while attacking in order to kite people. On the other hand, you reward positioning more. I once saw a video I sadly cannot find of a really low HP storm taking down a Mirana by jumping over her with Ball Lightning and attacking her while she turned. That's a skill which just wouldn't exist if there was no turn rate."
TrueDoTA2,3dfn3q,AnalysisSitus,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:13:03 2015 UTC,"You need to be better at predicting things and be a little more aware of positioning, I agree. But in terms of raw mechanical skill, instant turn rate has a much higher skill cap."

TrueDoTA2,3dfn3q,darkmayhem,2,Thu Jul 16 08:40:37 2015 UTC,I appreciate turn rates. It allows a player to be slightly more efficient with movement or careful with positioning. Also heroes with faster turn rates like tinker feel very tactile and enjoyable to play
TrueDoTA2,3dfn3q,achacttn,2,Thu Jul 16 15:26:30 2015 UTC,Very positively. Jakiro in his current form wouldn't be allowed to be so strong without his spell wind up and crappy turn rate to balance out his kit.
TrueDoTA2,3dfn3q,_tpyo,2,Fri Jul 17 20:23:30 2015 UTC,"That's a hard one, it has its ups and downs...  As /u/ferret_80 said, Dota interact with turn rate with abilities like Sticky Napalm, Medusa's ultimate, or the Force Staff's active; can't speak of HoN, but League's only skill dependent on champion positioning is a known flaw from the old times when the game didn't yet make much sense, and will probably be reworked in the future. They add depth, sure, however that's only a few abilities on a pool of hundreds, which I don't really miss in any meaningful way and definitively can live without.  Bodyblocking then add both depth and fun, and is in League almost worthless unless your unit is huge, which probably is a clear point for turn rate-enabled Dota. Some may still consider its situationality in League a bonus though, since it can be seen as a strength of champions that use size as an active mechanic (Cho'Gath's ultimate grants stacks lost upon death that make it bigger—as in half screen big with max stacks—other than giving it bonus HP, and Zac's passive regulate its size on its current HP) or able to summon large or large quantities of minions (Annie's ultimate, Malzahar's passive, Yorick's ultimate and maybe its whole skillset—I'm sure if its ""normal"" minions can actually block people).  And then, there's my connection. Most days I have between 120 and 180 ms of ping, always with regular spikes and packet loss. This only results in lost trades when playing or playing against ""fast"" casters on League, and it's never a problem during fights in Dota; but if one has to run away and gets spikes or packet loss between the ""OHFUCKGETOUT"" and thought-out-positioning clicks, while on League it's just a couple of steps worth of delay, turn rates can easily make the hero fully turn to a direction it was not supposed to, and then back to the right one, resulting even in whole seconds of stilltime. This kills the hero. So fuck bodyblocking ;n;    /u/Azrnpride, /u/TURBODERP,   /u/SystemPeanut  Exactly. The reason people like Tryndamere are broken in League is because they were meant to be melee carries, yet to compete with ranged carries they were given incredibly powerful abilities, which turned out to work very well in other lanes.   Kiting in League is too advantageous for ranged carries as much as the opposite is true in Dota: both game's characters are balanced with their respective engine in mind and given the necessary tools to do their job right (which also means that League melee carries are bound to build somewhat tanky unless really ahead, but they're different games and the lower amount of versatility in that regard isn't a problem at all at the end since everything else is balanced around that as well. Such tools also lets melee carries work not as much in other lanes as alone, something you want to be whenever possible to maximize exp—while obviously freeing the spot in the support-guarded lane for the weaker carry that is however allowed to build glass-cannon with its range safety)."
TrueDoTA2,3dfn3q,Darkenetor,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:55:34 2015 UTC,it has been a while since i played league last time but as i remember it if you try to body block creeps there they actually get a speed boost after it so they get to the middle of the lane in time
TrueDoTA2,3dfn3q,darkmayhem,1 point,Thu Jul 16 08:39:43 2015 UTC,"Yes, they get a speed boost proportional to the delay in getting in lane, and if you separate the creeps of a wave the rear ones get another speed boost toward the firsts, so there's no way to block them if not when some big bug comes up, but that won't probably leave the PBE. Which is quite annoying after getting used to Dota's more controllable lane equilibrium.  You can still block champions though."

TrueDoTA2,3demcx,TwistedBOLT,6,Wed Jul 15 17:50:33 2015 UTC,"So you're right, for /r/dota2 this idea is super complicated I see why they rejected it. The implications of the abilities seem really hard to read on paper (ie how will these changes interact with the rest of his skill set?)  I think the non meta conjure image needs way more clarification. Will it also disjoint and dispel like manta? It sounds kind of like a copycat idea of PL's new doppelganger where the illusions micro themselves, but don't really do anything useful. I'd do out with the auto micro and just leave it with 3 illusions.  The meta conjure image is too complicated as well and needs clarification. Are the images magic immune? Or ethereal? Will sleight of fist kill them? Or psi blades? Sounds like there is too many exceptions to your idea and when you need to be specific for each ability, the idea is clearly not concise.  I think your ideas are okay, but you should think about their implications a bit more for such drastic changes and leave the abilities recognizable or with very simple effects. Think about how icefrog changed bloodseekers silence by moving the bonus damage and silence into two separable abilities, but the can be explained in 2 lines each, not two pages of text. Simplicity can have complicated implications."

Can you explain this rework in an easy to understand way that is short enough to fit in a skill description box? If you can't fit that information into a few lines of text and still make it easy to understand everything it does, then it probably won't work. That's the problem with a hero like Earth Spirit.

TrueDoTA2,3demcx,j0a3k,2,Wed Jul 15 21:41:03 2015 UTC,"So basically you turn him into a split pusher using (probably radiance melee) illusions to farm across the map.  However, if I read correctly the ranged illusions can't attack towers so your ability to take objectives is way less than before the rework.  So you basically have to take that damage to teamfight.  Once you show up to a teamfight you can either have melee illusions with minimal effect (think tanky naga illusions that can't riptide or deal any significant damage), or dark seer type high-damage ranged illusions that go down instantly to spread damage.  You're basically 100% countered if they have a gyro or ember spirit, and your illusions basically can't chase because the enemy can turn for a half second and kill it or just make it back behind their tower to be totally safe.  I fail to see how this rework would make him in any way more viable.  You're basically giving him a short disjoint/immunity while losing pushing power and requiring the opposing team to play badly to have a huge impact in fights by failing to kill his very limited number of illusions.  Does not effectively buff (which he sorely needs), overly complicated (to the point of being impossible to explain in a short tooltip, and difficult to explain in a wall of text), and at the end of the day barely even reworks anything (only really changes one skill beyond tweaking CD/duration, and even that one skill still primarily functions the same way as previously: it creates illusions.  On top of that one of the main changes made partly steals a mechanic from an item/other hero ability already in the game).  TL;DR:  I rate this rework 1/10, and that one point is only for participation."
TrueDoTA2,3demcx,DeanofDeeps,0,Wed Jul 15 21:22:47 2015 UTC,"My bad I misstyped the tower thing. They get destroyed if they get hit by a tower not the other way around. My apologies. And I should have made myself clear about the range illusions they are not effected by spells regardless of what spell. This includes slight of fist, splitshot, flack cannon or any other spell that does damage. To kill an illusion you have to manually attack it. Also as I said radiance doesn't work on melee illusions, only range ones. Also I think you fail to see that you can use melee illusions to farm the jungle in a very early. and with only one skillpoint the skill turns in to an unreliable escape in the lower levels."

She's also very mana dependant early on and can't really afford to spam spells without good regen or she'll find herself without ultimate.  Then she also requires an aghs while also (usually) needing a euls.  By late game you have to decide if your team has enough damage in fights and going deso on her Is actually really nice.  So can you? Sure but I think there's better choices like hex."
TrueDoTA2,3ddqqs,Skyro620,3,Wed Jul 15 16:36:15 2015 UTC,OC is very good on mid Lina because it lets you stun > Eul > stun > Hex > stun for some crazy lockdown. The lifeleech is also helpful of course. IMO going Arcane Boots and eventually into OC is better in more situations than Treads/Phase and eventually into Aghs. Aghs should be a situational buy for the BKB piercing effect.  Something like Arcane > Eul > Blink > OC > Hex is a pretty solid progression.
TrueDoTA2,3ddqqs,l_HATE_TRAINS,3,Thu Jul 16 00:21:37 2015 UTC,"Situational buy for the BKB     There are BKB heroes everygame nowadays so the normal progression of boots->euls->aghs is very standard, also you talked about OC for lockdown but what about stun->sheep->stun? There is some downtime between the hex and the stun but I'm just presenting the alternative. In almost every hero discussion Octarine is suggested because having lower CDs is good, well ofc but you need to see what you're giving up for it."
TrueDoTA2,3ddqqs,Skyro620,2,Thu Jul 16 10:40:14 2015 UTC,"Just because there are BKBs on the field doesn't necessarily mean you need Aghs. You only need it if you think it will be critical to burst down that specific BKB hero in teamfights. So vs. a Luna who is a fragile agi hero who often picks up an early BKB to effectively use her ult is a good example where Aghs would make sense. PA is another. Sometimes these heroes even change their item build order so they aren't blown up by Aghs Lina, so again it is situational.   The point I'm trying to make is one should think critically on the Aghs pickup on Lina and not just build it because they see everybody else build it or because they think it's ""very standard.""  I'm not sure what your point is with stun > sheep > stun w/o OC. I mean, we're talking about progression after Eul's. Sheep is a late game item. You're comparing apples to oranges.  And yes of course people mention the lower CD on OC, but I was specifically pointing out the lockdown potential it allows Lina that people in the thread have clearly missed. It is quite good and IMO it is vastly superior going OC instead of Aghs in the traditional Eul's buildup in the vast majority of your games."
TrueDoTA2,3ddqqs,wildtarget13,2,Thu Jul 16 16:40:45 2015 UTC,"The lifesteal on spells is negligible and the cool down helps a little for ultimate.

TrueDoTA2,3ddqqs,BuffKunkka,5,Wed Jul 15 22:54:08 2015 UTC,"Lina is actually still disgustingly good. Too good, even.  Her Q just owns in lane for CS-ing and harassing at the same time. It has a stupid large radius and length.  Her W isn't always the easiest to land without setup but if you land it then chances are the person you hit is either dead or basing.  Her E proves speed to either run in or out and it gives her attack speed. It's this skill that turns Lina from just a magic nuker into a legit right clicker as well. Deso being my go to item for buffing her attacks.  Her ultimate does insane amounts of damage and once you have Aghs you can either pierce through BKB's and take their carry to half HP or you can just delete a support from the game entirely.  As far as her leaning goes it's quite strong. Not too hard to gank but like Storm Spirit you need to not fuck up or get too cocky. Otherwise she hits all of you with her W & Q and instead of shutting her down that's at least a kill just fed to her.  Lina can farm fast with some early regen items (Euls being optimal) but can also gank effectively with either a shadow blade or a blink dagger.  Honestly Lina's still amazing."
TrueDoTA2,3ddqqs,mriswith-,3,Thu Jul 16 00:39:43 2015 UTC,"Lina is still excellent. I mainly notice these days that:   People are used to laning against her now, and so it's a well practiced matchup for most people and it's harder to stand out as a lina as a result Most people aren't good lina's. She's not quite as braindead a hero as leshrac, and the difference between someone who picked lina and a lina player is big."
TrueDoTA2,3ddqqs,DHKany,3,Thu Jul 16 05:30:44 2015 UTC,"She's still pretty scary early on but a lot of Lina's I've played against fail to capitalize on the lead she gains with her strong nukes.   They build euls and Blink and Maybe Aghs, and then they just can't stay alive long enough to be any good."
TrueDoTA2,3ddqqs,undatedseapiece,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:59:22 2015 UTC,"That's my go to build on core lina, skipping blink if we have good gap closers on our team. What would you recommend is better?"
TrueDoTA2,3ddqqs,DHKany,2,Wed Jul 15 14:25:56 2015 UTC,Nono I'm not saying that that's a bad build.  It's just that people aren't able to convert that to enough presence on the map.
TrueDoTA2,3ddqqs,ItsDominare,2,Wed Jul 15 14:28:43 2015 UTC,"If you want to try something different you can go the bloodstone route. Obviously Eul's mitigates her mana issues to an extent plus it helps people who can't land her stun raw, but bloodstone lets her spam her nukes all day and thereby acts as a large farm accelerator (and the extra hp doesn't hurt either).  Assuming you have a decent lane and can get the bloodstone finished <15m you can go in several different directions depending on the game. Sheepstick for some hard lockdown, MKB to transition into a rightclick carry, etc. You just need to make sure there's going to be enough farm to go around when you decide to try this build because bloodstone Lina gobbles up stacked neutrals and lane creeps like crazy."
TrueDoTA2,3ddqqs,preppypoof,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:43:50 2015 UTC,"my only problem with bloodstone build is that you are very weak before you finish your bloodstone. if you get killed a couple of times you'll have a very late bloodstone and lose your mid advantage.  that said, it's my favorite item to get on lina when i'm snowballing."

TrueDoTA2,3ddqqs,TommyVeliky,2,Thu Jul 16 01:26:49 2015 UTC,"G goes lothar's after eul's sometimes and it seems pretty legit. Creates a lot more space on the map than a blink dagger honestly, but you sacrifice the positioning advantage."
TrueDoTA2,3ddqqs,undatedseapiece,2,Wed Jul 15 15:54:04 2015 UTC,"I've seen that, and it makes a lot of sense considering you are invis for your stun animation, a potent ganker, benefit from attack speed and have mana to spare (unless you need to use your ult on the target, then you are pretty much oom)"
TrueDoTA2,3ddqqs,TommyVeliky,3,Wed Jul 15 16:29:07 2015 UTC,"I think the most useful part of it is that it gives Lina a Pudge/Storm Spirit-like amount of fear for the enemy, where if she isn't showing you have to play extremely safe because she can easily solo anyone on the map from invisibility. So the minute you get it you want to go drop your combo on the carry and instakill him. After that it creates so much space for your team and you can even just go farm jungle for a little while, you don't even have to continue ganking as long as you're not showing. It's more psychological than the blink build and helps your team more in my opinion. I still usually go blink however, as it gives you more utility in most situations."
TrueDoTA2,3ddqqs,Ishmael_KingOfTheSea,3,Wed Jul 15 18:53:03 2015 UTC,Lina is good. Most of the people who play her just suck though or build poorly.
TrueDoTA2,3ddqqs,-Hellfire-,3,Wed Jul 15 15:24:31 2015 UTC,She's been a fine mid for a long time. I've played her mid for three years and it has always been strong and still is.
TrueDoTA2,3ddqqs,Dat_Speed,3,Wed Jul 15 17:25:12 2015 UTC,"Lina is definitely still viable, but I see her weak against zeus/lesh, and strong vs heroes like SF/mag. I strongly prefer cyclone only and no blink because she can easily cyclone then walk up and stun. With blink only I tend to have less survivability than only cyclone.

TrueDoTA2,3ddqqs,aslak123,2,Thu Jul 16 11:55:35 2015 UTC,I just assumed the she was too squishy to lane against lesh. I normally go for someone like QoP against him for the easy escape.

TrueDoTA2,3db1q3,Avvulous,4,Tue Jul 14 21:58:45 2015 UTC,"if I ever think there's a chance I can't assist in a fight I'll aggressively push a tower, even if my team dies and I'm alone, chances are the enemy team won't try and push uphill for rax immediately after a fight, but the juggernaut tearing through bot tower will deserve 1/2 tps, and not just supports.  at this point they're 3v1 vs a carry who has base advantage, assuming equal farm you can at least keep them at bay unless they tp'd a core and a support for you and kept 2 cores or something.  it's situational based on the enemy team, but after you've got an enemy who have only 1 or 2 powerhouse classes, and you're playing a class which can 1v1 mostly lategame, then they WILL need to send a strong class back to defend, along with something else.  ⇨Space Created"
TrueDoTA2,3db1q3,wuulala,2,Wed Jul 15 07:10:35 2015 UTC,"This is like tping to a different tower to farm when you got ganked as a core, or like a specific case during TI3 where Mushi boughtback as Ursa after getting 5 man-ganked at top to tp to mid and take a free Roshan. Right now when I am looking at it, it all seems easy and intuitive, yet when I'm in the heat of the moment I tend to not think but just do, so I always tp home instead of making better use of the space I created. I believe Bulldog's reaction is another good demonstration of good split-second decision making where every player can improve on regardless of their skill level."

If he just have blinked back in mid lane when Ogre died, he wouldn't be able to push bottom in time and get the necessary reaction from windranger.

Most of us kinda know about the concept of it but don't actually apply it in the game. This video is a nice example for to understand a little bit better.
TrueDoTA2,3db1q3,cvjzoxc,5,Wed Jul 15 07:22:53 2015 UTC,"It really really is, splitpushing towers while the enemy sieges is very standard."
TrueDoTA2,3db1q3,ProfKarl,0,Wed Jul 15 11:14:21 2015 UTC,"Point is not the split pushing part, I explained in another comment:   What I'm telling is, you can't point out many players that would blinked to enemy jungle immediately and instinctively, after getting ganked and lost one teammate. Most of us would react by retreating. I don't know why but people in this thread acting like that this was the most obvious play. No it wasn't. Only a small fraction of players would have thought not to blink or retreat to a safer position. It isn't the pushing part what's actually important, it is the reaction to that gank.   and in another:   People are really armchair experting that play. Every 99 player out of 100 would have blinked back there. They do at my 4k level. They wouldn't think of pushing that quickly. Everyone can spot the wrong or right play when just watching; every chatter at twitch can do that regardless of their skill level. Important thing is being actually able to make the correct decisions on the fly. And for that, observing better players is a good way to train yourself, hence this post.   I don't know why you assume I wouldn't know anything about split pushing at all. Obviously a simple split push attempt wouldn't impress anyone who watched pro level dota for 10 or so hours."

Sure, someone who doesn't play split push heroes regularly or doesn't really get trades that much might back to base or hesitate over what they should do but I think anyone who plays these heroes with any frequency and is somewhat good at them will understand the benefit of trading raxes, especially if it's their sidelane for your mid.   I think it's good that you posted though, there's probably newer players who don't know that this is often the best course of action."

TrueDoTA2,3dc55s,DrDonut,7,Wed Jul 15 03:01:40 2015 UTC,"To decide that, you need to read the situation.  Deso lets you take towers faster and gives you solid damage for cheap.  Usually you won't need damage as your crit will do the job, but if you're having trouble killing people then maybe Deso is the item.  AC allows you to take towers and survive longer.  The attack speed also translates into a higher DPS.  Mjolnir allows you to farm faster and makes you more dangerous to attack directly.  As with many things in dota, the answer depends largely on what you need and when you need it.  I'd never really consider rushing deso on WK as it's not usually what he needs early.  If you put points into crit, you'll be blowing people up easily enough.  It'd be better to get items that allow you to do damage, items like drums, blademail, blink dagger, or things that let you farm faster like maelstrom, radiance.  Unlike heroes like weaver, TA or Clinkz (3 good heroes for a Deso rush) who are squishy and rely on doing a lot of damage and moving, WK excels at staying in the fight and being difficult to bring down."
TrueDoTA2,3dc55s,Cyclonus_already,-1,Wed Jul 15 06:37:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah, if you feel your damage is lacking try going 1-1-4-1 build. You spend way more time right clicking than stunning."
TrueDoTA2,3dc55s,Lazarous86,5,Wed Jul 15 13:36:53 2015 UTC,That is just a VERY situational build unless you don't fight any hero in the early game.  -Every lvl Wraith Fire Blast gives you (80/80/70/70) damage.   -Every lvl in Crit gives you 7.5% which is 5-6 damage every hit with PT's and lvl 6.
TrueDoTA2,3dc55s,Utoko,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:43:00 2015 UTC,"It is strong early if your support also has a stun.  It allows you to have better sustain, transition to the jungle after you drop to the tower. Also normal offlaners can't handle the damage in trades earlier. You just use the lifesteal to bring the HP back up and keep the pressure up in the lane. The big thing for me is the stun duration doesn't change with levels only damage."
TrueDoTA2,3dc55s,Lazarous86,4,Wed Jul 15 16:46:47 2015 UTC,"Pre 20 minute Desolator is absolutely monstrous to play against.   However, unless you're playing TA the -armor damage boost really drops off later in the game unlike AC and Mjollnir which will always have good utility and scaling.   If you're snowballing hard and can see your team winning the game early on a Deso might be a very good idea."

That's not really true at all.  The -armor is always a significant multiplier.  It's better on lower armor targets, sure, but for the price it's always pretty good.   Even taking a 20 armor hero to 13 armor is effectively a 24% damage increase.  A 13 armor to 6 armor is a 30% increase.    Sure it's not quite as good as deadalus when you get into the lategame, but you're still talking 25-30% damage increase for 3500 gold even as a worst case scenario.  That's pretty great."
TrueDoTA2,3dc55s,Drop_,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:59:11 2015 UTC,Most agility carries in the late game sit at 2k+ HP and around 25-30 armor. I don't know the numbers exactly but it becomes a very very very small damage bonus at that point.
TrueDoTA2,3dc55s,DHKany,2,Thu Jul 16 00:28:36 2015 UTC,"7 armor adds 420 EHP per 1k actual HP the hero has (60 EHP per armor per 1k HP).  Deso vs a 2.5k HP carry would reduce their EHP by 1050, with 30 armor the enemy would have 7k EHP. 7k -> 6k HP is about a 14% decrease in EHP. If they have 25 armor it's 6250 -> 5200 EHP, about a 17% decrease."
TrueDoTA2,3dc55s,subraizada3_,1 point,Thu Jul 16 08:42:13 2015 UTC,"For most carries the decision comes down to crits or desolator. At some point, I forget the exact number, critical strike will outscale flat damage + -armor. But Wraith King already has critical strike (so he likes raw damage which desolator provides) and innate lifesteal that's not an orb so the downsides of late game high armor targets are largely mitigated."
TrueDoTA2,3dc55s,Declination,5,Mon Jul 20 15:43:26 2015 UTC,"If I'm playing WK, Deso typically comes after Armlet but before BKB if they don't have a team that can kite the shit out of me. Deso with armlet on gives the big whammy crits around the neighborhood of 1k. It's that kind of crazy burst that makes him fun to play for me. If you can get it between 20-25m you're golden.   Is the bonus damage really noticeable, compared to just getting more attack speed   Depends on playstyle, but with how kiteable WK is I really opt for the shock and awe crit style. Pop in there, stun, whammy 1k crit, good night."
TrueDoTA2,3dc55s,fenlain,4,Wed Jul 15 14:56:33 2015 UTC,"Here's a question:  Does the armor loss kick in before any other crits and such?  The order it kicks in with such a heavy critter is pretty important, no?"
TrueDoTA2,3dc55s,Acatonyourkeyboard,10,Wed Jul 15 06:29:22 2015 UTC,The first attack treats the target as already having lost the armor. So even if the first attack crits it still benefits from the reduction.

If they have image heroes then I would tend toward bfury/mjoll, but if they are all single target I think deso/armlet is stronger. I like early armlet better because it builds up well and you can grab all the items from the side shop, while deso you need to hog the bird for 2 trips. Also the hp regen, +str, and armor from armlet is very useful against heavy nuker heroes.   Armlet+deso+blink is a sweet combo. I usually go blademail and mjoll lately though cuz bs/lesh is picked so facking often."
TrueDoTA2,3dc55s,Dat_Speed,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:23:23 2015 UTC,"It's good if you're going for early pressure and presence.  A build like Blink / Treads / Armlet / Deso is great.  It's really a smooth progression and it has a nice mix of tankiness and huge damage potential.  It lets you take roshan faster and push incredibly fast with deso as well.    I like the build because it makes it a lot easier to kill people in the 2-3 hits you get in during the blink/stun duration, but if I were going for a long gamer I would probably go another direction like AC or Mjollnir, since those give a little more impact in the ultra lategame.    The thing most people underestimate about Deso is its cost effectiveness.  It is the most DPS : Gold ratio item in the game for a right click hero, pretty much regardless of who you buy it on.  Debatable whether it's more efficient than armlet.  But that's why it works so well on heroes that pick up armlet.  You can get it at a really good timing with it, and you have so much power for a relatively inexpensive build."
TrueDoTA2,3dc55s,Drop_,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:52:39 2015 UTC,"A way I commonly play WK is to rush midas, then try to get a radiance. The miss chance combined with the burn and dmg makes it a great item with awkward timing. Your team will have to make some space for you to farm, as WK with brown boots and no ultimate is extremely underwhelming in teamfights. If you manage to get it by around 20 minutes or so,  the rest of the game will become a lot easier. Your farm will accelerate, which makes your levels accelerate a bit. From there, 9 times out of 10, I will make a desolator. It doesn't have quite the same impact as getting it 5-10 minutes earlier,  but by this time you should have 11 even in bad games, so you are fighting more and more often. From there, AC, skullbasher, moonshard, abyssal, buyback, glimmer/bkb. At that point you will be killing their entire team by yourself. This style takes up more space and is assuming you go late, but why else are you picking WK. His ultimate isn't awesome until you have 16 or someone capable of roshing."
TrueDoTA2,3dc55s,Jackolope,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:48:10 2015 UTC,"It's not bad. Though I would prefer armlet, mjollnir or AC because WK's innate attack speed is abysmal, and each of those 3 alternatives provide other utilities too."

Well if you lose mid to a ganker and you have the ability to get your sub 1k MMR Teammates to do something useful for once that game (they should gank your mid as soon as they see you struggle, ward the shit out of the map and protect/deny runes to make the enemies mids life hell, because your sorry ass lost mid and now they gotta win it!) then get them to stick together to not keep on feeding that fed storm/ta/BS.

TrueDoTA2,3d9wan,borland66,1 point,Wed Jul 15 11:55:25 2015 UTC,You need to stop them early. Storm should be easy to kill as Lina pre-6 (or atleast you can force him back to spawn a few times). TA is a bit trickier but if you have a support come and gank she is usually pretty easy to kill.

TrueDoTA2,3d9wan,pepe_le_shoe,0,Fri Jul 17 08:54:54 2015 UTC,"Who knew that ta/storm can easily kill at lvl6?   Vs storm you need to harass him as much as possible in the first 2-3 mins so you deplete his farm and not give him chance to take runes, i.e. push the wave that comes on 1.30 so while he's clearing creeps you take a rune at 2.00. He cant really kill you solo at lvl 6 without runes though, unless you are staying in lane on less than half hp.   Vs ta - sentry on mid and dont stay in psiblades range. Other than that there's nothing you can really do vs a decent ta. Saving stun when he dives you is maybe the best (and most) you can do, because if you use the stun while in lane and he's 6 he'll just proceed to slow you and right click you to death and there's nothing you can do."
TrueDoTA2,3d9wan,dirtyslarkpicker,0,Tue Jul 14 22:16:48 2015 UTC,Kill them back.
TrueDoTA2,3d9wan,tinkeringabout,-5,Wed Jul 15 02:21:46 2015 UTC,"Well in general if you die 1-2 times in mid you can recover from that but 3+ you will usually lose the game. Solo kills make a huge game impact, so most mid players are very good at dodging a mid gank/solo kill. I think your best bet is to simply not play mid.   Asking for a smoke gank can save your ass for sure. If I feel I can't kill the mid then I will leave the lane and gank the sidelanes."
TrueDoTA2,3d9wan,Dat_Speed,2,Tue Jul 14 20:09:36 2015 UTC,"""just don't play mid"" - real helpful advice. Sometimes they get a lucky rune or a support comes and ganks you and you die."
TrueDoTA2,3d9wan,Stat1c19,6,Tue Jul 14 20:32:08 2015 UTC,"It is a 'lucky' rune and 'surprise' gank mostly because you failed to secure the rune, or you had no vision around your lane. Or if you had vision may be you failed to spot it. Having vision early game is really important and if your supports don't help you with wards then you should buy 1 ward at least just so you don't die and can farm and/or get XP. Also remember to push out lanes just before the runes spawn, that way the enemy mid has to choose between getting the farm from lane or the rune. Either way he loses something."
TrueDoTA2,3dao0q,lebastss,7,Tue Jul 14 20:20:39 2015 UTC,"Bane, enfeeble makes it insanely hard to last hit.  All he would have to do is play defensive and not get caught out and wave goodbye to all your cs. Only problem is wasting all this farm on your eventual support. This can be fixed by rotating in a carry to take over once Bane hits 6 where he goes destroys other lanes."
TrueDoTA2,3dao0q,jwwhales,-1,Tue Jul 14 21:26:36 2015 UTC,"Actually, I disagree. Bane enfeeble doesn't prevent my toxin from doing its damage or poison touch, thats where all Viper's damage comes from."
TrueDoTA2,3dao0q,preppypoof,7,Tue Jul 14 22:31:42 2015 UTC,"actually, enfeeble does affect nethertoxin.  at level 1, viper does 45 damage. If you skill nethertoxin first, that's a bonus 20 damage against a creep that is <20% hp, so we'll say you do 65 damage at level 1.  level 1 enfeeble reduces damage by 30 - almost a 50% reduction. if bane continues to level up enfeeble, it scales better than nethertoxin does.  that said, maxing enfeeble first is pretty much a waste of skill points because bane's ganking potential would be a lot worse off."
TrueDoTA2,3dao0q,freelance_fox,4,Tue Jul 14 23:37:39 2015 UTC,"Bloodseeker is the hardest counter I can come up with. Rupture at 6 is perfect to kill Viper with, even if he gets BKB, plus Viper still has a difficult time harassing BS out of lane. Just make sure he can't TP out on you (check for TP/bring a friend with a stun)! I think Viper's specific niche is being nearly impossible to out-lane, so having maybe 1 counter if any is pretty good.  Actually scratch that, last night my pub teammate Viper told me he was getting wrecked by Silencer mid and swapped with the Lina in my lane :S Maybe Silencer is the counter, since apparently Viper's Q can't proc Curse?"

TrueDoTA2,3dao0q,Acatonyourkeyboard,4,Wed Jul 15 12:16:36 2015 UTC,"Viper can counter almost any hero, so the simplest way to find a good/better match is to see where his strengths are:  Corrosive skin:  Anyone with sustained damage will suffer the most vs. him.  I.E.  Lots of little hits to harrass.  So you need physical burst damage that also has range.   Clinkz:  Strafe + searing arrows Weaver:  Germinate attack 2-for-1 damage when not last hitting creeps (probably quite hard to time with last hits, though.)  Time lapse can get you out of a poison jam....mmmmm...poison jaaammm. Necrophos:  Heartstopper aura has incredible range, and 1-2 levels in sadist will help vs. harrass and corrosive skin. Shadow fiend:  With full souls can deal tons of damage in a short period of time. Pudge:  Hooking into a tower (good luck)   Then you always have heroes who can join in and help gank the mid, like NP, Earthshaker, Blood, etc."
TrueDoTA2,3dao0q,DHKany,2,Wed Jul 15 06:42:33 2015 UTC,I found decent success as weaver vs him. Viper's level 6 all-in can be completely mitigated with time lapse and shukuchi makes sure he can never chase you down with his slows.

TrueDoTA2,3dao0q,wakek3k3,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:08:27 2015 UTC,"Queen of Pain is pretty good against Viper. AOE to push out the waves for rune control. Burst damage, which is important so that nethertoxin and poisons don't start building up everywhere. And blink is obviously amazing - Viper is really slow.  In terms of just the lane itself, it's pretty even, but for the overall flow of the game you'll be happy picking QoP into Viper.  I'll note QoP has much higher potential for outplay, and playing her I kill Vipers solo regularly, which I do not do much playing the opposite matchup.  I think Tinker is often used as a Viper counter. I'm an awful Tinker unfortunately.  Windranger is a very popular mid now, and Viper has a lot of trouble dealing with her elusiveness.  Anyway the important thing is that Viper is very 1v1 centric so you really want to push the wave hard at the right times for rune control."

TrueDoTA2,3d9tbp,Nopies4u,7,Tue Jul 14 16:52:35 2015 UTC,"Clockwerk mid has always been viable, people usually say he's just ""better-suited to offlane"" or ""can't make use of the farm"" but I find that at most pub skill levels this is patently false. Strong ranged laners will probably trash you and at a competitive level you can probably get counter-picked with a really greedy hero if they know it's Clock going mid, but they won't know Clockwerk is going mid if you play your cards right. That's the best reason to draft him mid at a high level. He can wreck melee heroes like DK, Dark Seer, and Ember (though not Beastmaster or Blood, I think he'd go even with them), but that's not enough to put him mid most games when there's a wide open hero pool and you're looking for a mid."
TrueDoTA2,3d9tbp,freelance_fox,2,Tue Jul 14 17:06:57 2015 UTC,"I think Ember shits on Clock mid.  I've played against it twice I believe and gotten multiple solo kills in lane.  If he cogs you, it's one of those ""I'm not stuck in here with you, you're stuck in here with me"" moments because you can just pop Flame Guard for massive damage if he stays and get an almost guaranteed Chains if he runs away."

If Clock goes for the bounce-cogs instead of trap-cogs I think he'll survive a lot better though, it's not like Ember has tons of mana. Spam flares to force him to last hit under tower and then go control the runes, move around the map earlier than him, and that should set your team up to win even if you lose mid."

TrueDoTA2,3d9tbp,Error401,2,Wed Jul 15 20:22:18 2015 UTC,"It's solid honestly. It's on the opponent to make a mistake and let you cog them, so usually you just get 2-1-2 and contribute. You have big base damage and rocket flare is a similar nuke to Lina+Leshrac's last hitting tool early on before they scale differently.   Clock also owns these heroes in the mid game from then on, regardless of how lane domnant they were. Just don't feed them multiple kills and make sure you TP support when they kill the side lanes. QOP and anyone will probably die to you if you manage to counter initiate.  I think a big thing about the different matchups is how bad clock loses to SF though. He has decent HP to tank through triple razes, but not forever. You have to set up a kill on SF, and clock can finish off an sf in cogs with him pretty easy.   Also, when it comes to getting a good lane equilibrium block off, clock has cogs level 1 to solidify some of that, at the cost of not having flare to power deny/Nuke+deny SF or someone mid during the same level 1 initial wave.  Clock owns, with many item builds and there are few ways to shut him down if he adapts his build and doesn't lose out too hard to force staff or BKB timings."

I find vs any meele mid clock, if played well, can get a kill at level 2, then snowball with the level advantage, the downsides are he gets shit on by anything with mobility or better meele damage, also ranged heroes clearly have an advantage. until you get close, he's decent vs mesh if you play aggro, because at level 2 you can kill him with no items and he will get stuck in his stun animation if he tries to use it."

TrueDoTA2,3d9tbp,ilikebuildingsheds,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:15:56 2015 UTC,"Well, number one hero that comes to my mind is Lifestealer.  Only thing you can do to this guy is hookshot him. Then, if you were stupid enough to get cogs up, you're dead for sure. Ursa deals easily with him as well, as does Juggernaut. Jugger will just ult you if you catch him and finish you off with a couple of right clicks.   Like I said before, any hero with blink or any spell that helps them escape the cogs makes you useless.   When it comes to items, when enemy has bkb, you can't fight them, and having Manta helps a lot vs clock. You pop it and chances are that you'll end up outside the cogs. If that doesn't happen Illusions will soak up lots of battery assault damage. If you're a support, force staff is your best friend against him.  But I play clock strictly as a ganker who walks around the map looking for kills, and this is 3k mmr. At higher skill lvl, people play him like an utility hero which is role he excels that."

Safelane would be the appropriate lane, as she would get nothing out of the offlane and doesn't have enough lane presence for mid.  Your preferable supports would be fairly defensive, as Venge can be ganked pretty easily, so supports like Earthshaker and Dazzle could work.  For items, I'd start off with tangos, a salve a ring of protection and branches. If you are having trouble last hitting in lane, a QB would not be out of the question. After brown boots, I'd build Aquila for its good stats and regen. Picking between Treads and Phase is personal preference. Sange and Yasha is a must for the MS bonus, agility and tankiness. After that, if you have a lot of physical damage on your team, go the -armor strat. Build Medallion and then get Solar Crest and Desolator in whichever order and a BKB beforehand if you need one. If you are one of the only physical damage dealers on your team, I'd recommend building Skadi, Butterfly and maybe a Satanic, as well as BKB if you need it.  For skill build, I'd keep one point in the stun, as the scaling for the damage and duration is pretty underwhelming and it costs more mana with later levels, instead opting to max Wave first, then Vengeance Aura, then coming back for the stun simply for the CD reduction and skilling Swap whenever possible."

TrueDoTA2,3d9l39,lolfail9001,3,Wed Jul 15 15:16:22 2015 UTC,"There is a reason many int heroes are played stacking null talismans instead of buying a quelling blade, and they're valid for other non-traditional carries too. First off, a useful item that becomes a better item is more cost efficient than one that you can sell (you recycle 100% of its cost, not just the sell value). Secondly, while you get a little less damage, you get the bonus against heroes as well, which is not something to underestimate: right click damage is what makes the difference in early skirmishes and lane dominance. Plus, you get more mana (Venge in particular is pretty mana hungry early on if you want to use your spells often) and HP (Venge also happens to be terribly squishy). With a quelling blade you'd get a comparatively less efficient item that gives you less stuff, even less so since you're ranged, and you only get it against neutrals, which would be all right if Venge was good at transitioning to the jungle or at least clearing camps fast, but this is not her case."
TrueDoTA2,3d9l39,itaShadd,-1,Wed Jul 15 15:29:18 2015 UTC,"I was writing a similarly long post but i fucked up and have no remains of it so here is recap.   Stacking nulls does not happen in lane in which only 1 side gets to hit creeps. Wraith band and Nulls stats in regards to heroes they are bought on are so different, comparing them is actually nil. Venge is not terribly squishy at all after few levels, having 2.6 strength gain helps. Not even 6 wraith band Venge has a chance of winning lane harass war against a hero with better MS and range aka about every current solo mid except Storm or to effectively trade harass with supports for similar reasons (boots venge however can easily go ahead and smash slow support's ass on the back of more MS and better manfight due to stun/wave). You forgot about context. Note that i do think (and you seem to agree) that just getting better at last hitting in lane is better solution, but QB is absolutely not out of question when it just comes down to getting 5 more last hits (at least that, anything less and buying was essentially an L that would make people think you're Tyga)."
TrueDoTA2,3d9l39,lolfail9001,2,Wed Jul 15 15:41:59 2015 UTC,"1-4: I suppose there's a good reason Venge isn't actually played as a carry, huh. :P  5: I still think a Wraith Band would help you enough to get those 5 lasthits, while also being more efficient both economically and for stats purposes. If the difference between neither item and having QB is enough to make its purchase not useless, the difference between the damage you get with QB and the one you get WB, including all the other benefits of the latter, definitely weighs it all in favour of Wraith Band. Besides numbers aside, when you find yourself in a position to attack creeps you may always invest 40 mana into Wave of Terror and get the extra damage you need from that - it's certainly cheaper than 225 gold (even if you get back 112 from selling it later)."
TrueDoTA2,3d9l39,itaShadd,-1,Wed Jul 15 16:00:00 2015 UTC,"1-4: those reasons would apply to any melee agi carry as just as well, except those have less HP. I wonder why they are played as carries, huh :D  5: Once again, 225 gold vs 485 gold, also, treecutting is priceless."

We're describing what would be the best course of action if we were to play her as a carry, we're not arguing on whether she is a good carry or not - we know she isn't.  5: 225 amounts to 113g ""wasted"" after the item's course comes to an end (you sell it). Wraith Band gets completely recycled into a new item, it completely eliminates the need to spend that money because you already did, so at the end of its course it is exactly 0 gold wasted. Treecutting is good, nothing to say to that, but you have tango for a while and unless you have good reasons to specifically want an item to cut trees, I'd avoid it on carry Venge."

TrueDoTA2,3d9l39,Axosh,4,Tue Jul 14 17:12:06 2015 UTC,"Item & Ability Focus  Well, the two main things you'd probably focus on are synergies with your aura and wave of terror. Your Aura only affects base stats, so you'd want a lot of AGI items. Wave of Terror lowers armor, so you could stack on that with other armor reduction items.  So you'd be looking at items like:   S&Y or Manta Drums Skadi Treads Deso AC and even Medallion/Solar Crest could be ok   Based on what you want to do, you can skill differently. You can get away with only 1 point in Stun and then focus on Aura and Wave or Aura and Stats. But that only makes sense if you are not going for early kills, or if you are in a trilane that has plenty of lockdown already.  Farming  You also need to think about where you are getting your money from. VS has no real good way to farm up, so your basic options become:   Farm Heroes Midas - this is ok, but not great. VS can do a good amount with levels, but for her to actually carry, you'll need lots of farm to put into stats items to benefit from her aura. The attack speed is decent as a side perk. Maelstrom/Mjollnir - this lets you farm faster, but does not synergize much with the rest of your kit, other than AGI giving attack speed.   If you farm heroes, your items change. You'd probably want stuff like:   Phase - good for early kills (it's also ok with your Ult since you can swap and then run through the creeps while phased) Blink/Shadow Blade - needed to position Deso - needed for early kill potential You'll also probably need Drums or S&Y for HP/Stats   However, this approach does not set you up well for late game Aura usage, so you need to snowball and end earlier with this approach.  Laning  VS has super high early kill potential, so you want to abuse that.  If you trilane, you want to kill the opposng laner(s) repeatedly. You could also do well in a dual-lane because getting level 9 or 10 is pretty important (i.e. maxed stun, maxed wave, maybe a level in aura).  Mid would be nice for the levels, but I don't think she would do well against most heroes unless you got ganks from your supports regularly. Otherwise, she has no wave clear (wave helps push, but does not insta-clear lane), low range, and nothing to whittle down your opponent's HP. She also can't farm stacks on Radiant side (though her wave might help her stack from lane). At level 6 she has decent kill potential on her own (unless you're against QoP or something).  Realistically, your best bet is farming a side lane with an aggressive support set-up."
TrueDoTA2,3d9l39,James_McNulty,2,Tue Jul 14 19:17:48 2015 UTC,"I like the post by /u/thudrfang , but for a different perspective: go agro tri with Venge.  With stun, wave and aura, she's dangerous at all levels.  Venge+Visage+Ogre or something equally aggressive would really bully an opposing lineup.  Because you're Venge, you're going to want to end relatively early, so a strong fighting build to push and end is the way to go.  Rush Aquila and get Treads->Deso.  S&Y is strong here and probably better for a more balanced game, but Deso is so good for killing towers.  1-1-1 build into 4-1-1-1 provides maximum killing power early.  Remember, you're pushing towers and hunting kills.  Your supports can hopefully get Arcanes/Force Staff/Mek with early tower gold and kills.  I think Solar Crest is tempting, but the active is really overkill if you're getting Deso (-6 from wave and -7 from Deso).  S&Y or BKB will hopefully be enough to survive midgame fights.  Aquila->Treads->Deso->(BKB or S&Y)->(Bfly/AC)  Could consider getting Drums: more mana and hp, nice little aura for fighting early.  If so, buy before finishing Treads."
TrueDoTA2,3d9l39,pretty_meta,2,Tue Jul 14 18:28:11 2015 UTC,"My buddy has 3 core Venge games here: http://www.dotabuff.com/players/109207726/matches?date=&hero=vengeful-spirit&skill_bracket=&lobby_type=&game_mode=&region=&faction=&duration=&timezone=America%2FLos_Angeles  The general theme is that against PA, he built +attack speed. In the other games, he built -armor.  It would be best if you can convince your teammates to build Medallion, Vlads, and Desolator. With those items coming, I think a +str/attack speed item -> Agi item -> AC might be a good build.   Silver Edge is sort of the premier +str/attack speed item at the moment, and it gives you the possibility of fighting in the midgame if you manage your mana well. SnY is also a totally viable item on core Venge. It helps with your +agi bonus and is farmable. If you get it early, the goal should be to take some decisive teamfights to keep your team from getting outscaled in the late game."
TrueDoTA2,3d9l39,wildtarget13,2,Tue Jul 14 19:34:26 2015 UTC,"It's kind of like building any carry. You have minus armor. A small single target stun and swap, a very bad ult for a core to have.   It is probably decent versus heroes that need big cancels like enigma, an unusually farmed Maiden,  and witch doctor.   To utilize swap in team fights, you probably need Blademail, BKB, and evasion of choice (solar crest isn't a support only item, it has more offensive potential than halberd).   Yasha and phase boots are for immense kiting. And shadow blade can be legit for a solo killing split pushers sort of build.   Bottle is your most reliable form of regen. Either that or something. Like helm of the dominator and basilius items. Orchid can be your mana solution and be good at extending solo killing potential."

TrueDoTA2,3dalvi,Flysis22,3,Tue Jul 14 20:05:51 2015 UTC,"I don't think drum is the build at all. Never was. The hero has more efficient ways to solve movement speed, mana, health, and attack speed.   Before the ice shard mana cost changes I went Upgraded boots+soul ring. Tranquil, phase, treads, doesn't matter almost. Depends how glass cannon versus no cannon you want to be.   For a 3-5 position tusk, you should be jumping up and down if you are getting a blink level of farm. The hero doesn't farm particularly well, but he gets kills easily if he maxes nukes. Sometimes maxing nuke isn't the hero they need you to be. Maxing sigil mid game can dominate a teamfight and sometimes you will be casting more snowballs than ice shards and vice versa and leave them at level 1-2.   The builds I have seen and liked are these 3.  Bottle only This usually is followed by either a straight damage item rush, or treads into blink.  Soul ring this is for when you need mana on tusk, and you do need more than bottle in most of your games. It's how you spam out enough ice shards to defend towers by nuking creep waves. Having only 210 mana per bottle charge ain't going to cut it. The second you have to bottle crow or shard so you don't have enough mana to do full combo, you probably lose an objective.  Arcane boots This is actually the most interesting one. I chastized by friend for getting bottle+arcane on Tusk first. And he was failing in general on the hero, but I saw zai do it for one reason: to support the mana cost of glimmer cape.  Glimmer is ownage in general and builds into pipe+shadowblade, which tusk can sport easily.   As for mid game items  Glimmer and solar crest are strong. Too strong almost. But tusk can use them both. If you have no chance of dying, rush desolator and blow up anyone out of position.  If you need auras, don't be afraid to be the guardian greaves carrier, the vlads, or the pipe.   BKB is the serious item for manning up and turning into a carry that buys MKB and Rapiers and completes Silver's Edge.  Blink is the go to item for being the play maker and pretty much split pushing endlessly (You can just farm stupidly and pray you don't get stunlock initiated on, if you don't you can snowball and stay in there for 3+ seconds so your blink comes off cooldown and TP out. Not foolproof, but strong).  Necrobook is great. 2-3 seconds of stun while necrounits are on top of you? solid. You can pop the necro units before casting snowball (not while you're muted before the launch) and drag them with you. It will keep you relevant versus storm, leshrac, and other big mana pool heroes that you don't feel confident your desolator or lack there of can kill all game.  TL:DR  I don't think drum is the build. If you need to tank up in mid game fights, screw damage and get auras and blink and BKB. If you're balling out of control, consider travels, urn, desolator, or any other items that will keep you relevant and on the map to kill everything in sight. Tusk has no cooldowns, just make sure you don't attract too many heroes while you have brown boots/phase, bottle, desolator, you will probably die."

TrueDoTA2,3dalvi,Skau130,3,Tue Jul 14 21:35:33 2015 UTC,"Hi Flysis22.  Tusk is a hero where many item-builds are viable. It's a lot up to your play-style to decide what you should build.  A Magic stick early could be very efficient as fights tend to be long lasting with tusk. and overall it's one of the more gold-efficient items of the game.  I like to go for an Urn of Shadows after brownboots. It also has a great buildup if you get killed during laningphase, pre-brownboots.  Power Treads - Perhaps Phase boots match your playstyle better. The more efficient your treadswapping is, the more efficient this itempickup is.  Black King Bar is a great item for him if you wanna fight.  Vladmir's offering - Overall great item for Tusk. As mentioned earlier, fights tend to be prolonged with the abilities of his.     Myself I'm a Support-player, hence the name. My standard item-build for competitive dotA would be: Magic stick>Urn>Treads>Medalion>Blink/Solar Crest/Vlads.   You mentioned that you believe Bottle is a core item. If you look at my build, I get:   50 % mana regen from Urn 50 % mana regen from Medalion Mana and health from Magic stick/upgraded Magic Wand High maximum hp through additional strength & stick charges.    Just gotta make sure the Tread swapping is efficient.  You mention Drums, let's just say don't buy them. Drums used to be a core item on Tusk as his snowball used to be based on his movement speed. Nowadays it has a movementspeed of 675.  It's still purchased often, but it's outdated.   I hope this gives you some perspective on the hero. Best of luck Flysis22!"

I get:   50 % mana regen from Urn 50 % mana regen from Medalion Mana and health from Magic stick/upgraded Magic Wand High maximum hp through additional strength & stick charges.    So you go from 1.2 mana regen to 2.4 so after you use shards snowball and sigil one time you only have to wait 100 seconds to regain the mana to use all 3 instead of 200 its better but its still nowhere close to enough to keep you ganking and out of the fountain. And you gain a 190 hp which is great, but once again a tusk without mana cant fight and has to go to the well so the urn heal will keep you alive but not in fighting shape. Bottle is core on tusk especially a support/roaming tusk who's whole job is to go from lane to lane causing death and destruction and you simply cant keep up the pressure without a bottle because of how often you will need to return to the well."

TrueDoTA2,3d71np,Twity,11,Tue Jul 14 00:52:21 2015 UTC,"You can take advantage of raging carries on the enemy team by playing an aggro dual Offlane. Once you get a kill or two, someone on the enemy team usually says to report them for feeding. This boosts your team's moral so your safe laners typically play better. I've used this to get really high win rates on heroes like undying and veno."
TrueDoTA2,3d71np,walterlewout,5,Tue Jul 14 05:57:34 2015 UTC,"I'd have to agree, I usually play support or offlane and even heroes that can contribute to kills like Lion while still giving the kills to your core make people happy.  Some people are just impossible to make happy though, so making space is always a good route to go"
TrueDoTA2,3d71np,that1ocelot,4,Tue Jul 14 01:05:51 2015 UTC,"I play a lot of omniknight and io in pubs, and being competent with my positioning, item builds, keeping wards on the map makes people happy, and for whatever reason those heroes really help my focus.  If my mid player dies to either rotations or even solo, I buy him a tp because I understand the item progression is important. I'm 4.5k as well, and sometimes mmr discrepancy is quite high wherein my 5k player is versus a 6k, so losses in the mid lane have to be expected.  I always play for consistency, just making sure I don't miss my spells or don't make mistakes. Counting mana is important.  Also being a support player, you have to often be impactful in other means, so I ask questions frequently to keep people aware of things like item progression and ""are we defending this tower or not?"" And try to manage macro decisions like split pushing and team fighting.  Buying smokes is a great way to get people to group as well. Many games I see heroes like tide get early blinks and then ravage not used until the enemy pushes 5 minutes later when we could have put it on cooldown twice already for picks.  Basically to make people happy you have to win, and being the sacrificial lamb that dumps funds into the sentries and smokes is necessary in order to play Dota like a team, and teamwork makes the dream work."
TrueDoTA2,3d71np,thadpole,3,Tue Jul 14 05:10:59 2015 UTC,"If your even or ahead I've found warding up the enemy side of the map often gives your cores the confidence to roam together and pick up free kills - no matter if there is a language barrier.  Of course there is the risk of moving into the wrong side of the map, solo, to do it so these days I wait for an invisible rune.   I'm pretty sure just seeing where the enemy isn't has won games for my team without anyone really knowing it. There's such a benefit to be able to know when they are ganking or in Rosh just because the lanes and jungle are clear."

So I tend to think playing greedy supports who have huge impact is probably still a viable option you know. A warlock with Agha refresher or something can turn Shit around sometimes.

TrueDoTA2,3d71np,Karatekuh,3,Tue Jul 14 08:23:46 2015 UTC,"It's the reason I mainly play WD, either mid or support. He can wreck fights with a cask > maledict > combo, and keeps cores safe and topped up on health/mana with arcs + healing. Not to mention if I am a support, zoning the offlaner will be pretty easy as WD has pretty high base damage (55 iirc), and you can get kills pretty easily with your lane partner."
TrueDoTA2,3d71np,PeenoyDoto,4,Tue Jul 14 10:37:57 2015 UTC,"I think WD is possibly the best ""pub support"" hero.   He hits relatively hard early for zoning. His goofy as stun + early damage can sometimes chase 2 heroes out of lane temporarily without any other help or followup depending on lane comp.  He has a fight turning ult with a relatively low cooldown and mana cost that make it okay to use during pickoffs and even as defense against dives.  He has an ""oh shit we overextended"" spell that can help you live in laning phase and late game alike. At worst, it helps sustain pushes / top off creeps when pushing.   He has a ""fuck that hero in particular"" spell when you land it.   His stun is somewhat unreliable and can be anything from a tickle and waste to virtually locking down 2 out of position heroes. Nonetheless, used in coordination with your heal it can get you out of dodge in the laning phase. Its long range can also be used to setup enough of a stun for your lane partner/mid/whatever to land their spells / stuns. The range and relatively low mana cost and CD make it great for interrupting channeling and TPs at all phase of the game.  Finally, he doesnt NEED anything to be good. Mana boots, and an urn when you can if no other carrier (tanky and further heal, and hes usually near kills if played well). You can ward bitch non stop and have huge impact with just mana boots.  Greaves/mek, aghs, etc. are gravy and great if you can get them...but WD can do a LOT with his base kit.  I usually go to lane with 2 sets of tangoes and 2 clarities, after buying 2 wards (1 to offlaner) and the courier. You can give tangoes to mid easily. You can be  obnoxious with this setup. Be it harassing / zoning, pulling through (the extra tangoes!), etc.  If the other team doesnt respect him early, sometimes weird stuff happens and he can snowball. Rarely, but so funny when it happens.  I'm rambling, but damn I just love playing this hero if I have to support haha."

He has a fight turning ult, kinda like disruptor but a lot more damaging if you get to channel full duration + you have aghs. Possibly the only hard support capable of getting rampages with general ease, as even cm channelling ult has to be in the middle of the fight to deal damage, while Death Ward has a pretty long cast range, and will bounce (and hurt) like a motherfucker.  I usually don't get greaves, only if I'm the relegated mek carrier, which I usually aren't. I tend to go arcs -> urn (if noone else is getting) -> glimmer -> aghs -> bkb -> shivas/hex/dagon(only if i'm pubstomping)."

I'd much rather pick a bh or ogre, and roam with it.

When people draft 4 cores who all have stupidly greedy item choices and have their own agenda, it's impossible to make sure they don't lose barracks and still have the jungle and ancients to safely farm.   Repelling and shallow graving them is one option. Killing the enemy is the other. Setting up kills is unfortunately the better way to secure games this patch. It may not be always in the laning phase. But it's doable eventually.   Many heroes I have as comfortable choices right now are supports that have a lot of offensive and defensive capabilities. Winter wyvern, Chen, and witch doctor.   But all of these heroes also have easy ways to jungle decently fast or clear camps. from there it's much easier to afford detection,  obs, and smokes to secure a decent mid game.   As strong as a repelled and blood listed hero is, force staff, urn and medallion timings help too. Being repelled isn't as good as an aegis for example.   Some players/cores take advantage of the repel better than others. It's a dice roll honestly."

Players at this level don't usually have effective supports on their team, so even doing simple things like warding, stacking the jungle, and helping harass in lane can make a huge difference in the game."
TrueDoTA2,3d71np,backstrokerjc,2,Tue Jul 14 19:46:15 2015 UTC,"It works both ways - as a position 3, I often buy a ward to keep them on cool down, then drop them from my stash for the support to pick up.

Let's say I have:   TA Shadow Fiend Weaver Slardar Venge   He fits the team theme here and offers good synergy in that he can operate as a front-line initiator and offer excellent chase potential. SF can ult and force the enemy to either take it to the face, or flee and deal with the Slardar harass and likely lose at least 1 to a pick-off."

TrueDoTA2,3d8azw,punriffer5,5,Fri Jul 17 23:10:29 2015 UTC,"It can work. Notail has done it in the past in pubs and at least one tournament game (Dota Cinemas Captains Draft IIRC). Notail went for a 4-4-0-1 build and I think that is probably the way to go. Cheap items are core before blink. Urn, Wand, etc. Landing your stun is critical and high levels of Sprint increase your chances.  I hate the argument ""why pick x when you can pick y?"". But Spirit Breaker is very similar playstyle and attributes to Slardar except it is far easier to get kills early with Charge than Stomp. But there are situations where Slardar can work better.  You would have to pair Slardar with another support with a long range initiator like Skywrath, WW, ES, CM, etc. Get aggressive in lane and smoke mid. You have to keep the pressure on while your high starting hp is relevant. Ensure you have a heavy hitting core who can Rosh with your ultimate. Slardar's fast disable also makes him better than SB against enemies with escapes. But that is only once you get blink.   You really need those situations to make it even viable. Even in those games its probably easier for Spirit Breaker to do work. Just put it in the ""high risk, low reward"" basket. If it suits your play and you're having success then keep picking it and having fun. But I wouldn't expect it to make a splash in high level games."
TrueDoTA2,3d8azw,XyfDota,1 point,Tue Jul 14 10:59:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah therein lies the rub: if you want to play Slardar as a 4 you're going to need a 5 that roams with you and 3 other heroes on your team who can handle solo lanes. Or at the very least be part of a lane with very high kill potential. While this can be done if you play with a team like pros do, but you can't really expect this in a pub.  I'd also argue that you'd have more success running Centaur as part of a roaming 4-5 duo in the vast majority of cases. To me, Slardar is an anti-carry, and he scales quite well into the late game, and he deserves farm and levels in most team comps."
TrueDoTA2,3d8azw,Skyro620,3,Wed Jul 15 00:47:29 2015 UTC,"Let's take a look at slardar, what does he do:  He has a very nice stun, but it pretty much requires a blink dagger, as well as a decent amount of tank (he wants to land the first stun on multiple heroes with blink, but after that the advantage of the stun lies in its low cooldown, so he wants to stay in close and be able to absorb a lot of punishment)  He has a nice bash. When leveled up it's 25% chance of 160 bonus damage and a second of stun.  His ult is a VERY large EHP ""nuke."" 10/15/20 armor means you're going to be reducing many heroes to around 0 armor (the ""sweet spot"" for -armor) for a large portion of the game.  He has a very nice mobility skill, putting him up over 400ms with only a single point and brown boots, but it comes with a significant downside, in 15% increased damage taken.  His strength is... decent ranking 13th in the game among cm-legal str heroes in str gain at 2.8, and a somewhat lackluster 27th starting strength at 21. This puts his level 1 health at 549, respectable, but not exciting.  His agi gain is second overall among str heroes, at 2.4, trailing only nightstalker's 2.5, but his base agi, 17, comes in at a much less exciting 12th. He does however, boast a decent starting armor, at just over 5.  His mana pool isn't a huge problem, and can usually be solved with just a magic wand, or something similar. However, with 15+1.5 int, he's not going to be buying mek.  He has baseline movespeed, 300, which, for a melee hero, is a bit on the slow side.  His level 1 attack damage is pretty dismal, well under 60. His stun, at level 1, has only 350 range (that's zeus' autoattack range) and does less than 100 damage. Although it only costs 80 mana, our level 1 mana pool only allows us to cast it twice.  Bash has only a 10% proc chance at level 1, making it fairly unexciting, although it does add an average of 6 damage to our attack.  While sprint's movespeed is good, combine the 15% damage amp with our already decent but not great hitpoints, and we have a very fragile situation.  So what do we have? First of all, we have a hero with bash and good agi gain, which automatically makes him love levels. This is great, but doesn't help him be a support.  He does have a good stun, but it's pretty bad at level 1, and he can't spam it, plus he has a hard time positioning for it in lane, unless he takes sprint, in which case, he's skipped bash, so he does very little damage, and he takes a ton of damage.  This hero, therefore, is very weak in lane, especially at level 1 (typically the most important level for a support) He also simply cannot jungle without items and levels. This is already serious points against for trying to run him as a support, as we don't really have anything for him to be doing at level 1.  Then, once we get out of the laning phase, he needs a blink, so he's farm hungry, for a support, as well. His stun is very good with a blink but only if he also has some tank, which he won't, if he's behind. We now have a hero who needs a blink in order to have a fairly middling stun, rather than having a great stun that becomes amazing with blink, as it is when he's a core.  With no defensive ability built in, he relies on items to make himself difficult to kill, so from the support role, he's going to be squishy, short ranged, and low damage. Basically, he's going to blink in, stun, amp something, and run away on low health. Maybe when blink cools down he can blink in again, and run away again. He will get next to nothing out of bash, and may actually favor stats over leveling this skill up, as he won't be able to get in and auto attack things at this point in the game.  I'm all for playing heroes off role, but slardar simply has nothing in his kit that lends him to the support role. You have to have some reason to want this hero in the support role, and there just isn't one. Try running a sven, at least storm bolt is a better stun, and warcry will allow you to bring something to the table all game."

Centaur also offers more burst damage but not by much if slardar gets a successful bash, and slardar can more easily transition into a semi-carry role."
TrueDoTA2,3d8azw,natedogg93,4,Tue Jul 14 12:23:39 2015 UTC,"okie dokie. here are some differences btw cent and slardar. running as a four:  in lane, cent is so much better because of issues of survivability. AND most importantly, his ability to flash farm. If needed, he can use double edge while stacking camps to get his tranqs.  Slardar in lane, just has his stun and speed (which doesn't add survivability in lane usually). So cent wins in lane.  And in terms of ultis? Depends on situations/lineups. There are times where I would greatly prefer Cent's ulti. It's fantastic for a lot of things. Yes Slardar is better in locking down one hero with ulti and bursting through his armor with the time. Better at rosh for the same reasons.  But in terms of farming up that blink? Cent wins, hands-down. Slardar can't transition so easily, especially in a 4 position.   Cent is a pretty good 4 - transitioning into 3. With tranqs to farm up blink. You can then go for something like halberd, or even solar crest, glimmer cape, w.e. you name it"
TrueDoTA2,3d8azw,AuroraAdventus,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:51:19 2015 UTC,"What? Centaur is a terribly greedy support, only think he provides in the laning stage is a stun if he's somehow able to close the gap and the nuke once he reaches 2  Slardar is the same but he has his sprint once he's level 2 which means he can effectively gank without a slow/ stun set up."
TrueDoTA2,3d8azw,TheAwesomeHNH,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:28:15 2015 UTC,"slardar requires the kills, and lots of them to transition well into a semi.  centaur does not.  cent has burst, and can initiate with ulti, or a blink (which he will get faster than the slardar anyhow).  theyre both greedy. but cent is more overall useful. and easier to ramp up. once he gets a blink, he will get something good going on. he can ulti out after a nice teamfight stun. fish gets melted if game isnt going well... which it wont if you have a silly roaming slardar...  you know why we dont see too much slardar, unless detection is needed and a big deal? because venge does everything he does, for the reasons youre stating that you would pick a slardar..."
TrueDoTA2,3d8azw,AuroraAdventus,2,Wed Jul 15 01:39:16 2015 UTC,"His ult is situationally better. Centaurs ult is literally always good. You can use it to engage or disengage, obviously, where as Amp is useful but depending on team comp it can be less than stellar."
TrueDoTA2,3d8azw,stakoverflo,2,Tue Jul 14 16:44:11 2015 UTC,"I've done it a couple of matches (in addition to solo offlane slar). I've gone 4-4-0-1, taking stats where it feels like it will be good, picking up mana boots/wand/blink as core. Sprint + Stun is very good. The issue is that he really only has two skills that make him a good support (amp damage and crush) with one utility skill (sprint) that enables him to kinda sorta get around not having blink. Amp damage is useful but not so useful to be a sole reason to include him in a draft. As a lane support you'd need someone else to keep your trilane from being crap.  The problem with Slar is he's greedy, and recovery farming with Slar isn't very nice. He's not like centaur where he can drop tranqs, double edge, and tank creeps while right clicking to farm. He only has slithereen crush, which is physical and thus isn't very amazing vs neuts or creeps, though amp damage alleviates that somewhat. And he's not especially tanky or anything like that.  Although, I wonder if you could do something silly like a brown boots/urn into midas -> blink build w/ aggressive roaming, assuming your team lets you occupy a little space. Sometimes you see Nightstalkers do something similar to guarantee they can get to their aghanims. Or maybe tranqs/soul into midas/blink with the expectation that he'll play out like ES, arriving at a late blink dagger. Fissure is a great spell though. Even though slithereen crush has an 8 sec cooldown and nice AOE stun/slow, it can't compare to fissure.  I think Tranqs might let you not have to max sprint immediately since unbroken tranqs + sprint is equivalent to level 3 in sprint with other types of boots. A lot of the utility in sprint is being able to move around the map efficiently, which coincidentally is also part of what's good about tranqs. Also tranqs provide armor and HP regen, and with soul ring Slar can use Crush and Amp Damage to farm. Then you can take a couple points in bash (Slar's bash is pretty good with amp), like a 1-4-2-1 build by 8. Maybe not neglecting Bash and expecting Slar to right click a little in ganks is a good idea. Hard to say. I think tranqs might be better than the mana boots I normally go.  Though they fill pretty different roles, NS and WK are both STR carries that have found some success in support roles, so... maybe looking at them might be a good idea. Idk. Compare him with a support like dazzle who offers better lane control, sustain, still great physical damage amp + buff. Not much of a contest to see who's the better pick. Although, when I'm done with finals I'm gonna try playing around with a midas build because I enjoy both the hero and shitting up people's games."
TrueDoTA2,3d8azw,amttc,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:43:31 2015 UTC,"So I tried this. It is mediocre and definitely not recommended if you're being serious, but a hell of a lot of fun. Start with support items, but make sure you have a smoke so you can gank. Make sure you start with two clarities as well - ferry one out to yourself whenever your mana pool is low before you have soul ring. build is 1-4-1-1 by 7, 2-4-3-2 by 11. item build is brown boots -> oov -> stick -> tranqs -> soul ring -> midas -> blink -> bkb -> other items that let you transition into an aura carrier/semicarry. Play like a messed up mix between Wraith King, Night Stalker, and Bounty Hunter. You should roam aggressively and make space, and hopefully snowball into a midas where you can then transition into a blinking initiator/core. slithereen crush stuns forever at max rank, coupled with a 2 second slow and a high level to bash, it's pretty potent. once you have your midas lay off buying any consumables unless the other support is 2poverty to be useful.  Some notes:   I feel like the Midas is super important because unlike WK, until you're kinda farmed you have to use sprint in a teamfight to survive your own initiations (by running). If you can't get the midas, just go straight to the blink dagger. You'll find it's a little underwhelming though since like a ""support"" wraith king or alchemist, you're going to have to transition into right clicking, but slardar already farms at a glacial pace and dying is quite easy with him, unlike WK. I feel like tranquils are an underrated boots choice on slardar. aside from the obvious health regen and desperately needed armor, it's potent in other ways. The reason is this: sprint is kinda a messed up skill. the only thing that scales is the movement speed, and you get roughly half the value out of the skill with one point. tranquils lets you pretend (as long as they are unbroken) that you have lvl 3/4 in the skill. Since you'll be roaming a lot, tranquils serves the dual purpose of giving you regen and strengthening sprint into an appreciable map movement skill without needing a ton of levels in it. i think the points in bash is more worthwhile from a damage perspective. it goes up to a 25% PRD to bash, which is pretty nice. Slardar is dumb as hell. Stick helps with burst mana needs in early engagements. Once you have soul ring you can use it to farm waves since 1 soul ring = 1 crush + ~2 amp damages. If you're ever not comfortable with your mana pool, ferry out a clarity or sprint back to base. slardar sucks without mana. Crush is like an AOE wraithfire blast, but getting close is the problem. If you can initiate without having to use sprint, do it. slardar is too fragile otherwise. Use amp damage like you would use track. if you aren't amping people once you're six, you're losing a significant amount of slardar's teamfighting contribution. -20 armor + getting shared vision of the team is no joke. take advantage of the easy roshan too. don't be greedy though, don't amp someone and then lose your chance to initiate."
TrueDoTA2,3d8azw,amttc,2,Sun Jul 19 15:59:12 2015 UTC,"Could be ok in the right game, or if you drafted him early and then decided to make him a support later.  As a support, I'd see him as a hybrid of Spirit Breaker and Bounty Hunter. The problem with hybrids are they do a lot of things OK, but nothing all that great.  You can roam with Sprint, but it isn't a great gap closer without Smoke or something. You'd definitely need early boots for it to be useful at all. And at that, you'd also need level 2 so you have Sprint + Crush.    I think for this to work out, you'd want lanes that you can gank. That means allies with disables/slows. For instance, QoP dagger at mid to give you time to Sprint in and use Crush.  Item progression would probably be:   Starting: Boots, Tango, Clarity Early options:   Treads Magic Stick Orb of Venom Urn of Shadows Bottle  Mid Game options:   Blink Blade Mail    Skill progression I think would have to be maxing Sprint and Crush before even getting a level in Bash. Sprint is absolutely critical for moving around the map and ganking prior to Blink.  Bash is tempting, but it is not reliable and unlike Spirit Breaker, your other spells are not benefitted by it reliably (i.e. SB's charge always will bash).  Getting Gold  Here is the main issue I see. Your ability to support really hinges on your ganks going well. Unlike SB and BH, your ganks are not as easy to pull off because of positioning. Sprint helps with that, but it is still easy to see coming.  BH has track to catch up no matter what happens. However, Slardar just has Damage Amp. That is good for farming neutrals and early Rosh attempts, but I don't think that will make up for failed ganks."
TrueDoTA2,3d8azw,Axosh,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:32:13 2015 UTC,"I am afraid it's not very viable.  In order to get your stun off, you need to get close. In order to do so, you need either blink, or a lot of hp (since increased incoming damage from sprint).  Amplify damage is good, but track from BH is better.  Bash is totally irrelevant in this scenario as you won't be right clicking.  Conclusion: Not viable."
TrueDoTA2,3d8azw,vraGG_,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:03:16 2015 UTC,"Since this is vaguely related, I was just thinking last night: Shadow Blade first item on Slardar into a Silver Edge later? He should be pretty adept at solo-killing supports this way, more than usual I mean."
TrueDoTA2,3d8azw,freelance_fox,2,Tue Jul 14 17:09:59 2015 UTC,"Slardar likes basically everything about shadowblade and while not a complete alternative to blink, it can get you pretty far.  You certainly can kill just about anyone solo you can initiate on (SB->right click->crush->Amp->Destroy).  About the only thing that will stop you from winning a manfight you initiate with SB is a BkB on a Troll/Ursa/PA ... but even then you've got even odds and you will annihilate PA if it's a silver edge.      The issue is you need to get it early enough to get mileage out of it because any good team will get wise to this fast and sentries will wind up everywhere.  It's still very strong and you do get to roam the map invisible at 522 movespeed which alone is a pretty big deal, but it's going to fall off at some point."
TrueDoTA2,3d8azw,feralminded,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:57:59 2015 UTC,"Slar is item dependent, but I have seen item dependent supports do very well where their offlaner is super weak (like earth spirit).

But not every support item benefit him , you end up build him like a carry.  its complicated , it is not bad. Turning this discussion into this or that hero do better is not good either!

TrueDoTA2,3d72xw,thundrfang,4,Tue Jul 14 02:47:19 2015 UTC,"I don't like support SB in the 4th position. The problem is usually you want to save the farm you get for the few items you need to come on line faster, and the 4th position hero is one of the two buying wards/using dusts/smokes. You're depriving yourself of items that you need in the middle game to play relevant.  As for a glimmer cape, I don't think it's a very good item on Spirit Breaker. It's meant as a cheaper upgrade than a Shadow Blade when you have a Shadow Amulet, and both items are kind of redundant. The 33% magic resistance isn't going to solve too much, and you're better off with a BKB by that time usually."
TrueDoTA2,3d72xw,PeenoyDoto,3,Tue Jul 14 07:55:21 2015 UTC,"I disagree. Spirit Breaker should be played as a fairly greedy four when in the support role, meaning you should probably have a pure 5 who buys most of the wards and sentries. This means you can get item progression. Just like in the 3 role, your main way of farming is with ganks, as SB has no real way to efficiently farm jungle, ancients or creep waves. You can start this with no items at level 2, with just charge and bash. If you gank successfully, the timing on item progression should be very similar to 3 position SB, being only a few minutes behind because you may need to buy a few smokes and the occasional wards."

You still want an urn but also get yourself a morbid mask for the Vlads OR start working on a mek, depending on what your team needs (and honestly if you are looking to mek you may want to forego treads for GG).  Mek + Urn gives you a ton of team heal whereas Vlads + Urn gives you sustain to be opportunistically jungling while waiting for a teamfight you can charge into.    Either way there's really no ""good"" SB support build for all circumstances and most of the time you want to either be a greedy #4 or a true laning #3 because there's simply much better heroes to be a poor support with that serve a similar role (here's looking at you tidehunter)."
TrueDoTA2,3d72xw,feralminded,4,Tue Jul 14 13:03:11 2015 UTC,"Mek on SB is pretty bad, as he has a limited manapool to start with. In early fights, you'll probably want to charge in first, ult someone while your team nukes the other enemies, and charge again if someone manages to get away. Mek will hurt that a lot, considering it costs 225 mana just to activate.   Say you get your mek at lv 11, which is usually when I get my drums (after urn). If you pop it, you're left with 243/468 mana. That's not even enough mana for a charge+ult. Sure, you could say you can go int treads, but backup mana for a tp or charge out is always important."

I'm not a big fan of this build honestly (as I asserted above).  I can sometimes see playing with the vlads/pipe build but even then I feel you're trying to square peg/round hole and in any case I go that build I find I'd rather have a tidebringer or centaur or something better suited to that role."

I get the early E for last hitting, early sunstrikes, and forge spirits,which I use to stack camps and deny runes.  You should focus on ganking from level 8, before then just maximize your cs, sunstrikes as needed, harass with snap and spirits. On ganks, cast Emp first, then tornado, follow with snap, blast, spirits, ghost walk, or sunstrike.  Once you get orchid or hex, gank by invoking snap in F and ghost walk in D, then get 3 wex orbs and activate D, and go to their jungle. Once you find someone, orchid->F->urn->R->D(emp)->attack. Quickcast helps. Escape with F if needed.  Post level 19, push with two spirits. Also change your team fight combo to tornado->meteor->blast."

I think he starts with null for the bonus last hitting damage, gets treads, and midas if it's a midas game. Then he usually gets a quick orchid, blademail if he's getting punched a lot in fights, and then whatever the team needs. Rightclick (mkb/daed/skadi) if he needs to carry, aghs/shivas if he needs the control, force/blink if mobility is an issue, diffusal if stuff needs to get purged, atos if he needs to chase, etc.  QW invoker is super flexible, pretty much just buy whatever your team needs to win the videogame."
TrueDoTA2,3d6oy4,PigDog4,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:53:45 2015 UTC,"Just add QW? Prioritise W over Q but don't skill Q beyond 3 or 4. If you find yourself teamfighting a lot add more Invoke if not get W to max first for EMP. Your first point of E should come no earlier than 9/10. Start with Null then rush Phase, stick and Urn. Teamfight and countergank until you have your orchid then invoke coldsnap ghostwalk and go gank. Orchid alone with urn allows you to solo kill anyone under ~1.2khp which is pretty fucking sick if you ask me. Depending on what kind of hero it is you decide if you can get away with invoking alacrity after coldsnap or need to finish him off under a Tornado so he can't blink/escape/heal. Maelstrom after that allows you to solo kill any hero especially the most popular intelligence mids (qop lesh) of the meta while splitfarming the map. As a rough gauge your most important spells are 1-15min coldsnap emp tornado 15-25min coldsnap ghostwalk alacrity emp tornado QWE. If you don't get the maelstrom you fall off hard and it really helps you recover/dps. There's no need for agha/octa nonsense on a QW invoker cos you're looking to dominate and end the game early; if it goes late transition into a dps core grabbing hex or BKB along the way.  Special mention to FOTM lesh as QW invoker actually crushes him so hard it's not even funny. If you're laning lesh don't go below your hill and prioritise Q over W first, but still don't add more than 4. QW invoker is the only hero that can sustain himself against lesh's lightning spam, and lesh can't go on you either because emp tornado can set up any tp countergank from supports. Lesh is also squishy to physical so once you get that orchid maelstrom up he can't split push alone with BOTs anymore.  I don't even know why people are asking for an invoker buff on the frontpage of /r/dota2 because he literally destroys lesh so hard. People who don't aren't abusing coldsnap + urn and are underestimating max W alacrity."
TrueDoTA2,3d6oy4,tinkeringabout,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:39:21 2015 UTC,"I like to play QW invoker as a ganker transitioning into a semicarry. I usually start with a point in E unless I can get away without it (possible against melee mids and maybe zeus) then I will get it later to be able to invoke alacrity. I start with null+tango, build into phase boots, then try to get orchid if I can get it in reasonable time. At lvl 13 our skillbuild should be something like 3712, giving us max speed in ghost walk, and really powerful emp/tornado. I'll skip over solo ganking since it's explained well in other posts. From this point, I think going a right click oriented build can actually be really strong, getting defensive/stat items as needed. You hit fast with wex/alacrity/orchid, so you can itemize to hit hard with stuff like deso and crit, which keeps up your solo pick threat and can help mitigate the effect of BKBs coming out against you. If you need more single target disable you can also build a sheep of course"

TrueDoTA2,3d6t52,_tpyo,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:54:39 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if you're making this suggestion for a core or support Rubick, or for both.  On a support Rubick odds are you're not going to have an orchid in time for it to be of much use against the enemy carry, who will probably have a bkb or manta, or any of a million items which purge silence (euls, diffusal, lotus orb), many of which can be used on the carry by his allies.   As a core Rubick, I dunno, maybe? Core Rubick isn't really a thing anymore, but it could work I guess. I can certainly think of worse items, but it's still not the item I'd want unless a matchup specifically called for it.  I think I would want blink and/or force staff, and probably aghs before I'd want orchid. And by the time I've farmed that kind of a core Orchid will have seriously lost a lot of its impact, especially with the appearance of items which can counter orchid.  The reason you get sheep as a late game utility item over orchid is to not allow it to be purged by the standard array of defensive items in the game in the late game. But, that being said, if bkbs and mantas and the like aren't being purchased in your games then orchids strength doesn't diminish too much. Just be wary that it won't stop a carry from right clicking everyone to death still."

Otherwise not a great idea. Rubick won't be employing the DPS for much of anything and the Disable is easily purged. Rubick is meant to disrupt/counter-initiate and offer teamfight potential with his stolen spells. Orchid can disrupt, but it is really meant for getting early/mid-game ganks off, something Rubick does not excel at."

Leaving Brown Boots if you decide to go Travels after your first Battle Fury is very reasonable, but sometimes you need the chase of Phase.  I think the attack speed of treads is wasted on Ember generally, so I never really get them.

The -armor really falls off as they get more armor (the math for armor is interesting, go check!) and cleave ignores armor anyway, as I demonstrated above.

TrueDoTA2,3d1iok,dsrtfx_xx,1 point,Mon Jul 13 10:31:09 2015 UTC,"I think you misunderstood him.  Yes, +armor is pretty simple when you look at it from an EHP perspective.  However trying to compare it to Daedalus means you need to look at it from a %-DPS perspective, at which point you have to break out the graphs that look like this.  As you can see, -armor falls off in %-DPS increase as your enemies start stacking armor.  However in the midgame Desolator is far more cost-efficient than Daedalus at increasing %-DPS, so that's why you see it on TA more than crit.  I think Desolator is OK on ember if:   Your enemies are snowballing and you have no space to farm, negating half of the benefit of Battlefury. Your team has another carry with huge physical DPS. It's especially good if your team has additional -armor, because then its %-increase in DPS will scale later into the game.   I nearly never build Desolator myself, but the one time recently that I did, it helped me come back from a disastrous start where I got completely fucked by SF in lane.  The enemy had a 20k XP lead and a 30-2 scoreboard; our only hope was to get some wombo-combo teamfights and come back.  Note that I also had Slardar on my team, so the Desolator damage scaled well against high-armor targets."

Gem is great, and of course it is an important tool, but the ideal gem carrier is a ranged hero that won't be killed easily, will stand near the front lines for vision, and has the spare inventory slot. So it's tricky.  The downside of course is a level 3 Necrobook is quite expensive. But considering that the truly aggravating thing about playing vs. techies is the added difficulty of the late game base siege I think it is always worth considering the investment."
TrueDoTA2,3d1zup,sclpls,-1,Mon Jul 13 18:38:43 2015 UTC,"he's honestly not, he doesn't solve the issue of breaking high ground against a techies which is probably the most difficult part of dealing with techies.   source: 5.7k china player."
TrueDoTA2,3d1zup,srslybr0,7,Mon Jul 13 20:59:06 2015 UTC,"I'm on mobile, so I can't check, but I recall that Broxy (a 6k techies player) said in his FAQ that his worst case scenario vs techies was nightstalker with aghs and gem. Vision is THE counter to techies, and NS is tanky to boot."
TrueDoTA2,3d1zup,dorox1,4,Mon Jul 13 01:42:40 2015 UTC,Keeper of the light is another that is good with scepter.  Maybe even a little better because he can deward himself.
TrueDoTA2,3d1zup,Lazarous86,2,Mon Jul 13 03:49:23 2015 UTC,Ouch. That does sound difficult to play against especially since you get high ground vision.
TrueDoTA2,3d1zup,dorox1,2,Mon Jul 13 01:43:56 2015 UTC,"Yup. A nightstalker with aghs and gem should literally never be caught by mines at night, and makes demining a cinch."
TrueDoTA2,3d1zup,Thefelix01,2,Mon Jul 13 02:49:09 2015 UTC,NS offlane is my go-to if they pick Techies before last pick. It works really well and gives your team a lot without needing to change your item-path much or sinking too much money into sentries all game.
TrueDoTA2,3d1zup,lolfail9001,1 point,Mon Jul 13 10:09:48 2015 UTC,Meanwhile in my hardcore unranked pubs picking NS offlane will just result into your team picking 4 more melees on timer end... and enemy picking techies ofc.
TrueDoTA2,3d1zup,Ailodierap,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:19:34 2015 UTC,"As an occasional Broxy watcher, I can confirm and qualify that he also says TA is a strong counter as well. That being said Broxy plays a ""battle techies"" kind of build that is very dissimilar from most pub's playstyles. The average Techie player would also be countered by minions/illusions, but Broxy forces fights around him and actively participates so he can actually bait the real heroes into his traps."
TrueDoTA2,3d1zup,bwl2,5,Mon Jul 13 20:14:48 2015 UTC,"In addition to standard vision granting tools, Necrobook is a pretty good way to deal with techies until he picks up a scepter that people tend to forget about.   Sending illusions and summons through the jungle and between lanes from time to time often disarms stasis and landmines. This is less effective after remotes come out at level 6.  Once techies has a scepter you really don't have an easy answer to dealing with remote mines denying you easy access to an area. If you see the sign go down you're probably better off pushing another lane since techies can't place another for 360 seconds.   Don't bother ganking a techies that's split pushing against you unless you can silence or lock them down for the duration of the fight. Techies will deny themselves more often than not when ganked."
TrueDoTA2,3d1zup,prezuiwf,9,Sun Jul 12 22:47:15 2015 UTC,"Because /r/dota2 thinks Techies is OP as fuck right now and completely game breaking   I don't think anybody thinks that. People just agree that Techies games are not fun because of how drastically the style of play changes. Techies still loses just as often as other heroes, it's just that the drudgery of playing against one (or with one) makes people loathe Techies pickers.  So far in this patch he has the 23rd best win rate. Certainly quite good, but far from OP. And he works way better in pubs because you need people to actually play a bit of support in order to shut him down."
TrueDoTA2,3d1zup,SharpyShuffle,2,Sun Jul 12 23:56:34 2015 UTC,"Having recently come back to the game after 2 years of not playing, I'm amazed techies hasn't been reworked yet. I'm here trying to get a handle on a ton of new items and a thousand little balance changes (not to mention a million cosmetic items) and yet somehow techies remains the same terrible annoying hero as ever. The complaints now are the same ones that people have (rightly) been making for years for years, I don't know why nothing has been done."
TrueDoTA2,3d1zup,vraGG_,2,Mon Jul 13 18:27:28 2015 UTC,"Considering how unconventional it is, and how few good techie players out there are, that a huuuuge win rate.  In my opinion PL is one of the strongest carries, yet this techie shit has higher win rate. Or he's just below Bloodseeker, which is considered ""super broken"" in VHS bracket (check dotamax).  I think that is pretty crazy on its own. Compared to other heroes that require to reforge your gameplay (tinker, meepo), he is crazy high on the win rate.  Let alone the fact that it completely changes the game flow. 1 pick changing entire game flow is ok? I don't think so."
TrueDoTA2,3d1zup,enferder,3,Mon Jul 13 09:13:18 2015 UTC,"I like Zeus in that although he doesn't counter Techies per se, he can play the game as if Techies didn't exist. Doing your teammates (e.g. poor supports) a huge favor is just icing on the cake; anyway, I spam Zeus regardless of Techies (heck he's more often on my team). When I say ""as if Techies didn't exist,"" I also mean that you shouldn't list him as a reason to go support Zeus."
TrueDoTA2,3d1zup,ColdPR,8,Mon Jul 13 07:17:51 2015 UTC,"Sure he's beatable, but you can bet you won't enjoy yourself even when you beat him. That's the crux of the issue for me. Even if you still win it will probably take a minimum of 30 more minutes and at worst the game mind just grind to a halt because you can't push against him and they can't push because you're quite ahead and they got techies on their team.  I think he is OP in the sense that he is strong enough to make the game miserable for the other players. Wins against Techies aren't satisfying and I usually wish I could just abandon and give them the win or something so we can queue into a new non-techies game."
TrueDoTA2,3d1zup,DHKany,3,Mon Jul 13 03:17:09 2015 UTC,"He's pretty shitty to play against, and he's pretty shitty to have on your team besides shits and giggles.   If his playstyle didn't drag out games for 20-30 minutes if he's remotely competent, then I wouldn't have that much of a problem against him, but as of right now I wouldn't mind him being gone from the game."
TrueDoTA2,3d1zup,Magnets,2,Mon Jul 13 03:20:25 2015 UTC,"I play a lot of techies at around 3.7k and the best way to counter him is to not give him those early kills or first blood. The more you delay the first few kills the less he can do.  Drow, sniper or silencer are really annoying in lane.  Early game just sit in the centre of the lane behind creep paths, don't take shortcuts between the trees unless you are going to use sentries. Do not underestimate suicide damage; most people have no idea how much damage suicide does. I watch broxy a lot and even in his games (he is ~6k) he gets suicide kills where it looks like the other guy wasn't expecting to die to suicide.  I like to buy sentries before a gem and just push 1 lane against techies, swapping lanes during midgame gets you killed if you don't have a gem."
TrueDoTA2,3d1zup,QuazAndWally,1 point,Mon Jul 13 08:05:20 2015 UTC,"I don't like Zeus because he takes too much mana to check early, his attack range is too short so he still takes damage while demining, and he's too greedy a support.  When the other team picks techies, I usually pick up Lich or some really hard support that needs jack shit.  Start with obs and sentry wards and courier, scout for him super early and demine to stop him from getting early kills.  Then I get gem right after boots and buy gem whenever it's off cool down, even if we still have gem.  Then techies rarely gets a chance to delay the game."
TrueDoTA2,3d1zup,Lyramion,1 point,Mon Jul 13 07:10:53 2015 UTC,"Many have noted the Nightstalker + GEM already. However to really make the techies rage try to get someone to combo SNIPER with him. Techies will always try to Forcestaff the guy demining into them. A Sniper has the range to easily avoid that. Sniper also can just siege the towers from long range forcing the enemy team to get active instead of you fighting on their grounds.   Secondly another part to ""counter"" Techies is to keep your Team together. Techies prolongs many games to 1hr+, there are many possibilities for people to develop rage and lower team morale. Many games against or even WITH techies are simply lost by one or both of the teams fighting internally.  A thing I personally do versus a Techies is play Abbadon. I liek the hero anyway and now it's your time to shine. While he has no vision advantage he is able to keep the gem safe and sound if you play well. You want to work towards a Blink dagger early. This way even if you get cought out you can still abuse your Blink to escape because during your Ultimate damage won't trigger its cooldown. Your ULT also has a short cooldown and you should wait for it to refresh before getting active again."
TrueDoTA2,3d1zup,Dat_Speed,1 point,Mon Jul 13 10:59:27 2015 UTC,"Techies is only OP if he gets first blood, imo. Without it he is well-balanced."
TrueDoTA2,3d1zup,lychenus,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:32:33 2015 UTC,"I am not a fan of picking zeus unless it fits the line up. Wreck their early game, get really early vision. You basically need a real ward bitch and a gem ASAP to counter techies. Its basically auto win if you do it fast enough before techies plant bombs under your nose.  The most complaint comes from the fact that you have no other strategies available but to kill him. very static counter and ofc boring if you see it quite a few times."
TrueDoTA2,3d1zup,prof0ak,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:43:03 2015 UTC,"THE best counter to techies is nightstalker with gem and Aghs. Even without those items, he is naturally tanky and can silence techies to prevent suicide.  Along that same line, batrider's flying vision with gem.  Natrually tanky heroes like pudge, doom, viper.  Abaddon gets a gold star because it takes two separate instances of mine piles to kill this guy, and if the ult goes off once, he is likely to retreat. WK works in a similar fashion.  I found bloodseeker does decently because of silence, If he is going fast enough the land mines may not damage him if he triggers them.  Early game if you are laning against techies: get a ring of protection. That armor goes a LONG way to keeping you alive because land mine and suicide are physical damage.  Honestly techies isn't OP, he is finally relevant. He is hated by a lot of people to begin with because they die a lot and a hero isn't even there, and when a hero you hate gets a buff, you just feel pure rage. Or maybe because they think techies takes no skill to play. Maybe most people hate playing support, and when they finally HAVE to because their team already picked 3 cores, they realize their next hour will be filled with twenty sentry wards and they wont get boots until 15 min in.   Whatever the case may be everyone in the game has to change their style of play significantly. The allies of techies need to not get into full team engagements because techies isn't very good in the fray, so any of those engagements are likely to be 5v4. The enemies of techies need to buy a lot of detection and watch their positioning. I actually love the hero because it adds so much more depth to the game. It allows for a completely different strategy than splitpush, deathball, ganking, or teamfight.   If there was a hero that could rebuild buildings, that would be incredible."

He changes the style of play the most for any hero though.  NS rushing aghs and gem, TA mid, Abaddon, Zeus or generally tanky heros ruin Techies' day.   Silences are great to prevent suicides when he allahu ackbars towards you.   The most important thing is denying his early game. Get to the lane ASAP and see where he is stacking his bombs. Keep vision up and/or in unusual places so you catch him changing lanes or using smoke. Stick to areas you know are safe or use sentries until you can afford a gem, which you need to get real early."
TrueDoTA2,3d1zup,jwwhales,1 point,Mon Jul 13 11:32:37 2015 UTC,"One of my friends plays a good techies. He always says to ensure a win, get an early gem and if you can hold on to the gem and deny the techies farm then he will have to play too much catch up to be a major threat.  Also, unlikely but if he picks techies early, get tanky heros that can absorb his mine stacks.  I've never had too much trouble against techies, have your supports put sentries/observers on each uphill as you push unless you still have that gem from earlier."

TrueDoTA2,3d0rr1,lolfail9001,2,Sun Jul 12 16:29:10 2015 UTC,"Sure it's not the best way but it's always nice to have alternative. Sometimes you might not want to blink too far from the warzone (hence you cant do the blink-1300-distance-and-move trick). Sometime you just want to reposition urself and avoiding focus from enemy. In theory, it's not hard to do the blink and move trick but in practical, there's many factor that needs to be consider especially in a clusterfuck skirmish. This is not about 'what's the best thing to do'. This is about 'there's another thing that you can do'. English not my native language, so maybe ""especially useful"" is not the best word.

TrueDoTA2,3d0rr1,lolfail9001,7,Sun Jul 12 19:05:35 2015 UTC,"Opposite.  Essentially rupture works this way: it checks every 0.25 seconds for distance hero moved in that time. If it is less or equal to 1300, damage is done accordingly. If it is more, no damage is done. Trick is that you do max range blink and then move right after. It works out in a way that you have a solid window to move few units to not receive damage."

TrueDoTA2,3d0rr1,Desther,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:49:55 2015 UTC,But aren't the rupture ticks started when bs casts it on you? You then have a moving window of 0.25s that you can't realistically observe so just have an average of 0.125s to do your walk after(or before) you have blinked.  I tried and could not perform this this every time. I would like to see someone doing it consistently because I don't think it can be done.

TrueDoTA2,3d29fg,twersx,3,Sun Jul 12 23:04:40 2015 UTC,"N0tail a while back talked about how once you got octarine on NS and a gem it was basically game over for the other team.  Way too hard for them to try and engage or even farm when their vision is reduced to 675 mapwide, and even if they have wards the vision is so limited they can't do things like protect their jungle, ancients or roshan, and your teal will ALWAYS have the advantage initiating on them.    I think the only viable position to pick it up is a snowballing 4 position or a offlane 3 position, though.  I think as a 5 you would have to be stomping to such a degree that nothing you got would matter.  I also think he's a better support with a ranged carry if you're rolling him that way.    I think he might need a midas to leverage it unless you really can just snowball super hard off of ganks, because without level 16 the octarine core benefits are pretty minimal."

NS is really weak in the burst mid meta, but he has huge utility potential, and we've seen him win competitive games on vision alone.  Octarine core is the late game dream of a roaming NS, so consider it if you are snowballing off of your aghs ganks, and thousands of gold are coming in.  NS is not fun to play mid for me, I much prefer the low farm priority and space to move around."
TrueDoTA2,3d29fg,docmartens,2,Mon Jul 13 01:26:10 2015 UTC,"Indeed, NS gets destroyed mid against current meta mids, and his potential as a hard carry is already pretty shit.

So I've played it multiple times the past month and found that it's too strong paired with another 2 cores, I don't know how you lose with this. With darkness it's ridiculous, literally 10 seconds of day. Meaning to say you have perma uptime minus 10 seconds of being in your best form. It's like KOTL aghs but better.   Darkness is also different from a normal night. The perma vision reduction makes it so difficult to play and ward against a Nightstalker who will also be carrying aghs gem QB, so much so that all my enemies gave up warding altogether after a certain point.   You definitely can't climb with it though. It's not that OP if you're in a ragtag team that doesn't know how to abuse your vision advantage and farm the entire map/box them in.

TrueDoTA2,3d29fg,NaturalDon,5,Tue Jul 21 18:16:21 2015 UTC,"Octarine Core NS seems virtually unbeatable   Except your spells are useless against BKBs and by the time you will reasonably farm up an OC after other key items, your spells are the weakest part of your arsenal and only used for utility. NS by nature is an incredibly powerful ganker and his low-cost slow nuke combined with a very, very long silence is what makes him so deadly in the early game, on top of his ever-present MS/AS passive. However, if you're taking him into late game (to the point where you would consider a 5900 gold item as a ""second or third major item"") then you're supposed to use his early snowball power to build right-click/durability. I just don't see any room for an OC on a NS in this meta. He's no longer popular being played as like a 3 in the off-lane the way that say, Timber or Clock can. The only real way to play him is as an early farming mid who gets mad ganks starting at 4 minutes. If you're going to keep up pressure, you need to itemize so you can act independently of your three spells- not focus on them.  My six-slotted NS would be:   Treads / BoTs (very late) Abyssal Blade Assault Cuirass Satanic 2x Situational (Daedalus / Black King Bar / Monkey King Bar / Aghanim's Scepter / Gem of True Sight / Heaven's Halberd)   I think the amount of theoretical farm and snowballing required to make OC a good choice is so high that at that point, you could build anything you wanted and win."

Not an extremely solid tactic since it requires a lot of farm, but it'll make the game much harder for opponents.  Just like a Slark/Zeus can help out a lot with making the map go dark."

The enemy team was something like 30-5 at 30 minutes, but we crushed them over and over when they tried to push to T3s. Even though we wanted to abandon and thought we were done at 30 minutes, we stayed in and played the match out. We ended up winning the game.   I don't have any idea why you're building Eul's on AA. I also don't think Hex is a viable second item on AA. Or any support, really...  You seem to never build Urn or Wand on supports, even though these are core on almost every support hero and you do play support a lot. I think maybe a general discussion of support GPM might be important for you. Here's what's up: as a support, your GPM will almost always be in the range 200-400. At 200 GPM over 45 minutes you'll have 9000 gold before deaths, wards, TP scrolls, boots, Tier 1 items, etc. You're actually left with closer to 4500 gold after all those expenses are covered. So you could rush a 5k item like Hex, and get it at 45 minutes... when the game is already over and won. Congratulations, you spent 4500 gold and maybe used it once and maybe it contributed to killing one enemy hero and created a 1000 gold swing. Not worth it. In the matches that you are losing as a support, you are going for high-end items too soon. In plenty of won matches you rushed a 5k item, but you won anyway.   Build Solar Crest instead of Halberd https://www.dotabuff.com/matches/1625853066, it's cheaper, has better synergy with your Wave of Terror, the 4k Halberd is just too ambitious as a second item, and the enemy team had mass BKBs anyway. Vlad's instead of Halberd would have been good here, against all the light physical damage of Luna and Dazzle You appear to have two unfinished items, one of which was Glimmer Cape. Don't build Glimmer Cape against that lineup, they have almost no magic damage. Also, don't carry dust against a Silver Edge carrier. You need sentries to see them sneaking up on you. Dust is for pursuit, Sentries are for defense. https://www.dotabuff.com/matches/1540664416 Blink is usually great, but less so as an invis hero against Bloodseeker, SB, and KOTL https://www.dotabuff.com/matches/1542814194. Meh. You lost this game because your teammates didn't have a way to deal with the enemy team's Run At Them strategy   Skywrath Mage is my go-to hero for scaling well as position 5, snowballing, and harassing the enemy lane. He does a lot of things pretty well, which is important if you want to take on the burden of winning the game.  You are definitely spending too much time hunting for kills. It's true that you want to get aggressive when you already have an item advantage, but that doesn't mean walk around in the the enemy jungle and find the enemy farming there. That means farm the enemy jungle while you wait for the enemy to come farm. The gold bounty from getting a kill is only around 5 lane creeps' worth in the early game. The only advantage that you derive from getting early kills is that you slow down the enemy farm; hunting for kills does not increase your GPM.    Your last hits are abysmal when you play cores. As a general rule of thumb you want Last hit count = game minutes * 10 / 2 (you can also say Last hit count = game minutes * 5, but it's easier to multiply by 10 then divide by 2 than it is to multiply by 5). So at 45 minutes you want 225 last hits. At 40 minutes, 200 last hits. Yet when I check your games   you have half the last hits you needed in this game https://www.dotabuff.com/matches/1594491481 11 last hits over however long it took you to abandon in this game (so at 2 minutes you want 11 last hits, so if you abandoned after 2 minutes your farm was too low) https://www.dotabuff.com/matches/1591986657 a third of the last hits you should have had in this game https://www.dotabuff.com/matches/1540834978 in this game, with a Battle Fury on Alchemist, you managed to have what would be adequate last hits on a core https://www.dotabuff.com/matches/1591986657, but Alchemist is a farm-intensive hero and you bought a farm accelerator, so you need to have an excess of 400 last hits at 53 minutes on Alchemist   Drafting:  I don't know when in the draft you pick your heroes, but you need to tailor your picks more.   https://www.dotabuff.com/matches/1627934262 you basically comfort picked AA here against heroes with lifesteal or heals (WK, Gyro, Necrophos). But when I look at your team's draft as a whole, I see you have no early game damage. The only one who would have a hope of winning a teamfight is Bloodseeker. AA is a rather low-DPS support. In addition, the enemy team was tanky. Dazzle is my go-to anti-tank. Necrophos also gets hard countered by Dazzle's Shallow Grave. https://www.dotabuff.com/matches/1625853066 You played well this match. I'll just say that every Venge game is on a timer. You do basically nothing after 15 minutes. If you have a core Shadow Shaman, support Zeus who rushes Aghs Refresher against a Dazzle, and a Venge, you're going to lose in the late game. Especially if the enemy team builds 3 BKBs. The take-away from this draft might be that you sometimes need a support with BKB piercing disable (Disruptor Aghs, Bane) or you need to convince your team to keep pushing in the midgame. Disruptor Aghs would have crushed this team, because you know Luna's going to build BKB and Windranger, Leshrac, and Bloodseeker are Run Around and Spam Spells heroes. https://www.dotabuff.com/matches/1594304424 Another anti-tank game. Alchemist is the only one that AA is useful against. I have no idea how you won this match. Your Gyro's farm is terrible, but it appears that the enemy Alchemist's farm was even worse. Fortunately the enemy team had no late game damage without farm on Alchemist, and he didn't have it, so the game was basically a guaranteed win at the 40 minute mark.  https://www.dotabuff.com/matches/1542814194 you got Bloodseeker'd. Dazzle does well against Bloodseeker as well, because Bloodseeker needs to spend a lot of time in the creep wave to get the full effectiveness of Bloodrage, but Bloodrage amps his damage taken. To your credit, you did draft a BKB piercing disable here, and a root at that, against heroes that desperately need mobility (TA, BS, SB, Pudge). I see your support Zeus rushed Aghs Refresher again. I'm sorry you keep running into these people.   If you're happy with playing Nec, Omniknight, and KOTL, and want to gain MMR, keep spamming those heroes. I only checked your most recent 5 Nec games and saw some questionable builds and last hit counts, but whatever, your winrate on those heroes is great. Nec and Omniknight are some of the highest winrated heroes in pubs for good reason. It looks like you sometimes run Ancients Nec or support Nec, and as you gain MMR, people will stop being okay with that. Be aware."
TrueDoTA2,3d1cml,pretty_meta,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:46:06 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the input, its very insightful. What do you suggest when there are no heros currently on the bored and your teammates are holding off picking last because they dont want to get countered. Do I just take the gold hit? Or are those the games I just go with my high winrate heros and cheese a win."
TrueDoTA2,3d1cml,pretty_meta,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:31:36 2015 UTC,"If you're picking support, you should always pick before your team's pick timer expires.  If your team insists on not picking and you hit the 0 mark and don't want to support, I'd just pick Necrophos. Yeah he has counters, but overall the hero is quite strong in pubs and can fit most anywhere at high 2k."
TrueDoTA2,3d1cml,goblinbiddin,3,Sun Jul 12 23:07:27 2015 UTC,"First of all, have a read of this.  You can win on support at low mmr. I'm sure if you handed ppd a 2.5k account and had him play like he does in his pro games, he'd rocket up to 6k very quickly.  Looking at your recent games, you seem to be playing a decent amount of aa, and never buying midas, which is a problem, because AA basically needs to buy midas at all levels of play. Second, i see you at team trailing hero damage, and 300ish gpm even in games that you win. AA, even in a 5 role, should be able to manage a 23 minute midas and over 400 gpm in a loss, unless it was just a 30 minute stomp (using low CD ice blast to push out lanes).  Ice blast also does a ton of damage, and there's no reason for you to regularly have team or even game trailing hero damage.  If you find that you don't have enough support when you play core, remember that cores buying wards is much better than no one buying wards. Some people refuse to cooperate. If your supports are like that, buy out the wards and put them in the support's inventory. This may not be as good as the supports buying wards, but we want to win games.  Also, just because you like playing support doesn't mean you shouldn't work on your mechanics. If you're stuck at an mmr, start up a bot game twice a day, pick a hero you like to play, last hit for 10 minutes, and then leave. You may not think this will help, but I assure you it will. Mechanics are important, even for supports.  On 5 role supports, try to spend your down time well. Sometimes this means farming. Sometimes it means stacking. You can't fight all the time. The cores need to farm. When they are, find a way to stay active.  My Thoughts on Supporting may be helpful, as it explores this idea in more depth.  Also, you abandoned a game. Never do that."
TrueDoTA2,3d1cml,wildtarget13,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:51:56 2015 UTC,"First of all. As important as winning is, learning is up there too. If you're support well, that's very relative.   Sometimes playing your hero correctly and standard isn't the way to win the game.  Someone mentioned you should be open to midas AA. I agree, but also disagree that that's the biggest problem. I'd say Atos is more useful that Euls or Aghs rush. It turns AA into the long distance hero he is meant to be played as. It proc cold feet while still doing damage, unlike Euls. And it gives you amazing HP and MP pool.  You kind of have to just get the most you can out of your support role, be it through pulls or making sure you don't position yourself into places where strong early game heroes can dominate you. Easier said than done.   Because the other part of owning as a support is having the right heroes to punish allies as well as covering your allies who expect you to solve their HP and MP problems.   Realize that you aren't meant to win all your games, some games you play perfectly, but your teammates are so far behind and there's nothing your hero can realistically do to cover them.   I can tell you that counterpicking and picking strong first picks are a big part of it. Especially in certain metas be aware of how strong the most popular heroes are at every stage in the game.   When I'm playing with my friends who play less than I do, I pick roaming heroes that people are really bad against like roaming bounty and mirana. I got away with venomancer for a little bit too, but I haven't tried it in a while. Use smokes. Play crystal maiden, chen and enigma and other fast junglers to jungle sentries and wards and smokes so you can get a guaranteed vision clear gank off.  Right now, I've been in the same Ranked predicament as you. I was playing hard 5 solo support and owning.   Mostly it's been these: Lina, Winter Wyvern, Ancient Apparition, Witch Doctor, and Chen.  All of these heroes pack good damage, decent lockdown and reward good positioning. Few heroes don't, but that's how I've felt on them compared to other supports I've been trying to spam in ranked like venge or dazzle.  But then I heard slasher say his safe lane go to heroes are windranger, troll, legion commander and wraith right now. That's actually my stronger safe lane heroes. I've been spamming windranger and legion in ranked and it's painful as hell. I lane as well as I can versus agressive dual lanes with incompetent supports, on both ends. I check replays and I'm trying to keep it consistent that I check enemy items, get early boots+TP, and regen like bottle, ring of health/ soul ring. And usually I'm csing the best I can. Doesn't matter. Supports win games. If they don't they're playing useless or looking to be the 4th and 5th cores. If they haven't made the game easy for the cores in someway then it's essentially who has the better mid game or late game with equal farm."
TrueDoTA2,3d1cml,IAmAustinPowersAMA,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:18:58 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna be honest here, I had to climb from 2.5k myself. When you break 3k, it gets easier because more people know what they are doing. That MMR that you're in is like a test of worth. It's going to be challenging. Don't give up, and don't, for the love of god, don't tilt."
TrueDoTA2,3d1cml,Dat_Speed,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:32:27 2015 UTC,"At 2.8k MMR most people don't understand the basics of dota so you should pick semi-carry support heroes like QOP, zeus, lesh, and ES. Warding well won't gain you MMR at that level, but getting early kills with a hero that doesn't fall off mid-late game will gain u tons of MMR."
TrueDoTA2,3d1cml,Flysis22,0,Tue Jul 14 20:42:32 2015 UTC,Spam bloodseeker. I raised mmr from 2.8 to 3.8 in few weeks. It's very hard to get win on supporting role. Jungle BS/storm mid is the best way.
TrueDoTA2,3d1cml,thadpole,0,Sun Jul 12 18:45:31 2015 UTC,"My advice: stop playing to win and focus on yourself. Skillful teamwork just straight up doesn't happen a lot of games and they are just shit shows of people getting caught out for 50 minutes until the throne falls. The less you rely on your team to do stuff and the more you make shit happen on the map, the better off you are."
TrueDoTA2,3d1cml,goblinbiddin,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:50:24 2015 UTC,"Focusing on winning is the same as focusing on your own play. Not focusing on your own play just means you're trying to get your team to be better, and that is simply not possible."
TrueDoTA2,3d1cml,thadpole,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:16:02 2015 UTC,"Ok let me rephrase. Winning doesn't really matter, you don't get better at DotA by winning. Removing the emotional connections to the game helps you make logical decisions."
TrueDoTA2,3d1cml,goblinbiddin,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:21:49 2015 UTC,"It's the opposite: being better at dota makes you win. Therefore, focusing on your own play IS focusing on winning, because winning is caused by being better."
TrueDoTA2,3d1cml,thadpole,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:24:58 2015 UTC,"Haha yes, but winning the byproduct of playing well. It may be your motivator to play, but to a cold hearted, dota playing machine it's just the by product. Being emotionally removed is my advice to improve because being upset about losing leads to blaming teammates and that doesn't help you improve.  Being good at DotA causes lots of things like winning, holding in your piss to long, skipping family events etc but they're not the things you focus on."
TrueDoTA2,3czk72,user8734934,19,Sun Jul 12 05:19:16 2015 UTC,"""goes through spell immunity"" is a different attribute from the type of damage it does.  http://dota2.gamepedia.com/Magic_immunity  BKB gives ""spell immunity"" and ""100% magic damage resistance"".  Life Drain pierces spell immunity, but it still does magic damage.  So you can cast it on BKB enemy, but it won't damage them because its magic damage is reduced by 100% (to none)."
TrueDoTA2,3czk72,jwiz,3,Sun Jul 12 05:56:42 2015 UTC,"True, and on the other hand, just because spell does pure damage(which goes through magic and physical resistance) doesn't necessarily mean it goes through BKB."
TrueDoTA2,3czk72,bravo_six,2,Sun Jul 12 14:57:51 2015 UTC,Does this mean that all magical bkb piercing spells do no damage?
TrueDoTA2,3czk72,Aquatrium,2,Sun Jul 12 15:12:08 2015 UTC,yes.  It would have to do physical or pure damage and also pierce spell immunity to hurt someone through BKB.  Like Death Prophet's ult (Exorcism).
TrueDoTA2,3czk72,jwiz,2,Sun Jul 12 15:30:19 2015 UTC,"You can target, but it won't drain.  In practice, this means you can trigger linkens on a bkbd hero with drain, but not much else."
TrueDoTA2,3cynnu,FabulousMrFox,9,Sat Jul 11 23:44:32 2015 UTC,I think the 6.83 build is still by far his best build. Bfury is an okay addition to the build if you're against PL or something.  The Maelstrom build is just dumb right now with his crit being so good.
TrueDoTA2,3cynnu,Now_you_fucked_up,6,Sun Jul 12 00:28:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah Mask really makes your Ultimate scary. You can go Battlefury but you need to realize that it will slow down the time you come online, but once you have Battlefury it'll give you a lot of bonus damage and you'll still hit hard with it in Ultimate."
TrueDoTA2,3cynnu,PhoenixPills,3,Sun Jul 12 07:41:38 2015 UTC,"Levelling blade fury is more of an option now, the scaling was nerfed on the cooldown, to force you to take it, and the mana cost decrease lets you still afford bladefury + ult at 6 if you have a wraith band/ring of aquila. Also, if you build treads, you have more than enough mana, though I personally prefer phase."
TrueDoTA2,3cynnu,pepe_le_shoe,4,Sun Jul 12 01:03:20 2015 UTC,"I actually never take blade fury after lvl1, I don't even use it to do damage, I mostly use it when I need bit of magic immunity or as a escape. And of course I have it at lvl1 for possible FB"
TrueDoTA2,3cynnu,bravo_six,1 point,Sun Jul 12 09:16:06 2015 UTC,"You should level it past 1 if you have kill potential in lane with a lane partner.  It levels pretty decently in that way, but I never bother leveling it past the laning stage and typically it will sit at 2-3 all game even if I leveled it for laning."
TrueDoTA2,3cynnu,Drop_,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:46:55 2015 UTC,"Well to be honest, even in laning phase I feel that if you get bit lucky with crits you can do more damage than you could with bladefury."
TrueDoTA2,3cynnu,bravo_six,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:25:01 2015 UTC,"Well there are two things.  First, it's easier to run away from a jugg a-clicking you.  They can slow you, and if your teammate doesn't have a really long slow, they have more potential to get away.  Blade fury lets you chase without having to stop for attack.   What lets you be more aggressive with blade fury is the fact that you can deal damage without stopping to attack while also being immune to magic during the duration."
TrueDoTA2,3cynnu,Drop_,3,Mon Jul 13 22:38:37 2015 UTC,The cooldown nerf makes you skill it at some point. 1-1-1-1 at 6 is still the way to go...maybe bladefury after level 11 instead of almost never.
TrueDoTA2,3cynnu,SmokinADoobs,2,Sun Jul 12 11:44:25 2015 UTC,"The only point for taking stats before level 6 was to be able to afford ult+blade fury, which you can do now if you build pretty much any item."
TrueDoTA2,3cynnu,pepe_le_shoe,6,Sun Jul 12 12:25:34 2015 UTC,"No, the reason people skilled stats was that it gave the same amount of damage with mask of madness as skilling crit over 1 level would. With lvl 8, mask of madness and phases, juggernaut would do so much damage with right clicks and have a lot of ehp, they could clear the jungle like an anti-mage."
TrueDoTA2,3cynnu,Hartwall,1 point,Sun Jul 12 14:18:03 2015 UTC,Yeah i think the MS from phase is too good to pass up.
TrueDoTA2,3cynnu,Now_you_fucked_up,6,Sun Jul 12 20:10:17 2015 UTC,"I have been messing around with Jugg at 5.3 in solo ranked. Imo he is still quite strong, he is a nice balance between early-mid fighting power and lategame carry potential and he is very idiot proof.  I haven't been getting mom very often, imo yasha is better for jugg right now as it gives similar movespeed, it is always active and it doesn't make you super squishy under its effect. Mom still has its place when you are behind and you need cheap damage though.  BF is surprisingly good, if I suspect the game will be more passive you can go BF and just farm like crazy, I have gotten 1k gpm in a game doing this and you can keep pace with even stuff like AM if you get BF at a good timing.  I have experimented with drum, it's OK if your team is going to be deathballing but I find yasha is usually superior if you are just going to be hitting creeps.  Skill build wise I have been still going for the 6.83 stats build, extra points in blade fury are probably good if you have a really aggressive lane but that situation is rare in my experience.  My dotabuff, my winrate this patch is sitting at a solid 64%.  http://www.dotabuff.com/players/86985308/matches?date=patch_6.84c&hero=juggernaut&skill_bracket=&lobby_type=&game_mode=&region=&faction=&duration=&enjoyment=any&timezone=Australia%2FBrisbane"

TrueDoTA2,3cynnu,Avvulous,3,Mon Jul 13 11:21:58 2015 UTC,"I have been going treads --> battlefury --> Manta/Vlads --> Bfly/Skadi/Abyssal.  Pretty much AM wannabe build, but it works really well on him.  I think battle fury is much better on him than it used to be before his BAT increase.  With only treads you hit very fast with your cleave and can farm faster than most heroes I find.  He excels at pushing so I try to be a menace split pusher, being EXTREMELY aggressive if their is no magic immunity piercing disables (spin TP = tower chip damage).  The manta+vlads+ heavy stats all come in to play and are very nice for pushing, but keeps you relevant in fights.  I will go for phase if i am aggressively looking for picks, but i prefer treads for the farming speed.  I also sometimes go for aghs, but i see it as a snowballing item that requires specific timings, and it doesnt exactly synergize with the battlefury build, it goes better with maelstrom/mjolnir for the AS+."
TrueDoTA2,3cynnu,natedogg93,1 point,Sun Jul 12 11:59:39 2015 UTC,Aren't phase boots better for farm on Jugg because of the MS and the damage increase (jugg is a crit hero)?
TrueDoTA2,3cynnu,natedogg93,2,Sun Jul 12 12:51:43 2015 UTC,"Just boots vs boots yes probably, but with the other items that I go for treads seem to fit better.  I think in a vacuum phase are the best boots for jugg but i often go for treads and even early BoTs if the game calls for it."
TrueDoTA2,3cynnu,natedogg93,2,Sun Jul 12 13:14:38 2015 UTC,"I also want to point out that i definitely don't think my build is optimal for winning games with jugg overall, it just fits my playstyle and works for me in most cases.  I do think more people should be giving the ole battle fury and vlads a shot though =]   ( i know MoM is great on him but vlads is such a good item for everyone on your team.)"
TrueDoTA2,3cynnu,lolfail9001,2,Sun Jul 12 14:17:04 2015 UTC,"treads do give more DPS (and crit is nothing but non-proc based DPS multiplier), but it's really about if you need phase active."
TrueDoTA2,3cynnu,Drop_,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:28:01 2015 UTC,"Whether attack speed or damage gives you a higher boost in DPS depends on many factors. Would be nice if someone actually calculated if treads or phase are better (for example, I am almost sure that if you have MoM phase are a better DPS choice than treads)"
TrueDoTA2,3cynnu,lolfail9001,2,Sun Jul 12 16:51:02 2015 UTC,"Treads essentially always give more damage.  You would need a ridiculous amount of attack speed for 24 damage to work out to more of a DPS increase than 39 attack speed and 9 damage.    Essentially where on the dps curve does 15 damage do more work than 39 attack speed?    It wouldn't even be close.  I just did the math.  It works out to y = .384 * x + 29.3, where y is damage, x is attack speed.   So for example if you have 200 bonus attack speed (say 100 base and 100 from MoM), they are equal when you have 105 (expected) damage per hit.  Above 105 expected damage, treads will deal more damage.  Below 105 Phase will deal more damage.    If you had say 150 attack speed, you would need 86.9 damage for it to equalize.  Just saying you have aqulia + MoM + Boots of choice, you're talking + 9 damage, +9 agi, +100 aspeed, and then whatever from your base stats (28 base damage + 26 agi + 2.4 per level).    Before boots say you're level 6, you're looking at 84 damage without calculating your crit bonus.  With just 1 rank of crit it takes your effective damage per hit to 100.8.  All before boots come into play.  Also sitting on 47 agi (without a stats build).    In that situation, during MoM you're looking at 147 attack speed and 101 damage before boots.  That puts you squarely into Treads territory being more beneficial.   As you get more items and levels treads will be even further ahead in damage output.    If you are going a non-MoM build, treads will always be better essentially (unless maybe doing something like rushing double moonshards)."
TrueDoTA2,3cynnu,draanexle,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:56:41 2015 UTC,"In 90% of conditions treads give more DPS. Hell, treads give more DPS than phase even after MoM+yasha. I was the one doing math on that some time ago and that was before treads buff."

TrueDoTA2,3cynnu,Drop_,3,Sun Jul 12 17:09:31 2015 UTC,"I like to go Jugg safelane now and then since he's a very solid hero overall.  Itemwise I usually start with either ring of protiection/stout (depends on if I know what heroes I'll be up against), salve, tango and gg branches.  I buy quelling blade at the sideshop for faster and easier farming, also the ability to chop down trees is great.  Then I usually get full Aquila, Phase (order depends on how lane goes etc). After that I go mask of madness, sange and yasha. I usually have all these items before 20 minutes atleast. I always buy a Skadi after that since it's amazing combined with the other items. Game is usually won by that point.  After that it's pretty much always situational on opponents and what you feel like.  Basher - Basher OP. Great if you need to cancel teleports and other annoying stuff.  Mkb/Silver edge - against evasion/solar crest. Silver edge is also good verus bristleback and splitpush etc.  Black King Bar - You rarely have to buy it, but it could be needed versus some heavily cc teams.  Battlefury - isn't worth it imo, exception could be if you get it very early and you manage to get tons of stacks. Other than that I would only go it versus phantomlancer.  Skillwise -  4-1-1-1 (@ lvl7) is what I usually go if I lane with someone who can give me easy kills with spin.  If the lane is very afk farm, then I usually go 1-1-4-1 at 7.  That's about it."
TrueDoTA2,3cynnu,aScaryMonster,3,Sun Jul 12 05:44:38 2015 UTC,This seems like the most roundabout decent guide for playing juggernaut. My only suggestions would be to consider manta instead of sny if if there's a bunch of stuff you can dodge or get out of. And going 1-1-1 stats build till about level 7 or so then max crit if the lane is ez afk farm. Or either 2-1-1 stats if you want a short cd on your bkb. Also consider lvl 2 healing ward early if you want to do rosh asap
TrueDoTA2,3cynnu,pridefulrocker,1 point,Sun Jul 12 11:42:42 2015 UTC,"Agh's has always been viable.  Same with Maelstrom/Mjollnir.    I don't really think Bfury is worth it in most games, but I would maybe consider it if the game was going to go really long or they had a hero like PL (but against PL I think mjollnir is generally better).    Treads are viable.    My typical build is Treads -> Aquila -> SnY -> 2nd item (usually deso or diffusal, maybe silver if they have BB/Spectre/Void/PA) -> Scepter.    Sometimes I go blink / scepter builds.  They are the most fun."
TrueDoTA2,3cynnu,aScaryMonster,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:51:09 2015 UTC,"1.""I would also welcome any other mention of heroes that can play a slow paced, controlled game (top the networth chart, never die, have clean games) in 6.84.""  Ember Spirit, Tinker, and Naga can still do that in pubs. They are farming machines that can get the maximum possible value out of the map and still contribute in pushes and team fights. They all have high skill floors, but are very rewarding for players with good game sense and mechanics.   2."" Is MoM still viable after the heavy nerfs and given the amounts of heavy nukes? Is Aghs' a viable choice now (eg maelstorm-aghs-basher build)? Is battle fury really worth it or maelstorm/ mom+yasha is good enough for farming?""  MoM will always be viable (barring further nerfs) on jugg because he benefits heavily from everything it gives and can purge the effect with his spin if he's threatened with nukes. Aghs is always SITUATIONAL, it's one of the WORST aghs in the game, but it's good against low average hp teams in aggressive games or if you're snowballing out of control against a team that refuses to play as five. Nine times out of ten, the Jugg ult without aghs is more than enough to get a pick off and it's still a few seconds of invulnerability in a team fight.   Battlefury is good if you've got strong lanes and a support willing to stack ancients for you. Battlefury is an item you build in any game where you wish you were playing Gyro instead. If you build the item and you're doing well, go BoTs and get fat. If you're doing poorly, queue another game and pick Gyro instead. Seriously though, it's risky. You can come back from a slow battlefury with an Aghs occasionally, but generally if you can't afford or can't go standard items like Manta/Bkb/S&Y/Skadi/MoM and be effective after you've invested in a battlefury, you've lost."

If they don't either protect me from strong harass/ganks or make space elsewhere then I feel like I can never get up and running. I love playing Naga, but I feel like I can never play her unless I have a minimum of two people in a party."
TrueDoTA2,3cynnu,Declination,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:49:07 2015 UTC,"There are definitely games where it feels this way and I think playing around your team is probably the hardest thing about picking a farming oriented hero this patch.  This may or may not be relevant to you, but I think the best way to play naga with questionable teammates is to take her mid. You come online several minutes sooner, but you have to take advantage of bottle crowing and use your solo xp to farm the nearest jungle camp while still farming mid. Naga has really great base armor and decent hp from level one. Couple that with your negative armor and illusions and it's pretty hard to dive you. It's especially hard if you're clearing camps every minute or two with your main hero+ 2 illusions and using the other illusion to last hit with in mid. Your only real fear is a smoke gank before level six against a strong mid. Bounty is also a problem this patch, but it's very manageable with a sentry.  Naga does ok against meta mids like Lesh, Qop, SF, and Storm. You shouldn't win the lane, but you should be able to get enough out of the lane/jungle to get you started. Naga with a level advantage can do a lot of things that a more traditional safelane naga can't. Once you hit a fast level eight with max illusion and riptide your ability to farm should outpace any damage your teammates should do in the very early game. That said if you feel the need to help your team, you can definitely tp to fights or try to rotate with runes. If you're having a good start, you can do work as naga, but generally I think it's better to farm."

Pubs aren't really a good place to take these sorts of stats. His winrate is 1% outside the boundary for it to be considered random chance, and he hasn't had a great place in the meta for a few patches now.  His current viability in the pro-meta is limited to being a safelane farmer in a deathball-ish strat, which makes him fairly niche.

It's not so much whether they're farmers, it's whether you have the opportunity to abuse his passive vs ranged.  Windranger is probably the best example followed by mirana but there are others. On the other hand, something like a QOP that can harass him with right clicks and DOTs then blink in his face to finish him are a lot more problematic."
TrueDoTA2,3cy7wu,Shod_Kuribo,1 point,Sun Jul 12 15:04:47 2015 UTC,"QOP that can harass him with right clicks and DOTs   You may know this already, but its worth stating for any other readers. When BB has a DoT applied to him, simply turning his back to wherever the inflictor's current location is will apply the ""back"" damage reduction. This makes DoTs less effective verse him compared to other heroes."
TrueDoTA2,3cy7wu,Ailodierap,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:49:53 2015 UTC,"This makes DoTs less effective verse him   Not in the laning phase. If he turns away from you and is still farming, then he's past the creep wave and you can easily right click harass him. If he turns around behind the creep wave, he's not farming anymore. If he doesn't turn around, he takes full damage.  During gank attempts, he's a lot more resistant to DOTs but during laning, they hurt him almost as much as any other tanky hero unless you pop your DOT at the end of a wave."

Him turning around for 1 second to get a CS and then turning his back against isn't going to offer a significant amount of extra DoT DPS. Remember it is child's play for BB to farm with his Quills too, which a mid Bristle will definitely be spamming, meaning he can still be actively farming outside of harass range, while keeping his back turned."
TrueDoTA2,3cy7wu,Ailodierap,6,Mon Jul 13 21:20:40 2015 UTC,If he gets an early advantage he can steamroll certain team compositions. People see him do well when well executed or in the right situation and then pick him stupidly.

Sure I 1v1'd a lot and won but the real moments where BB shines through seemed to be when the other team was just plain stupid in their actions on how to handle him.  Early kills in lane are key, and if you're trying to keep the other team from farming he's annoying.  It also seems like his scaling mid to late game is a bit tricky, I've been going S&Y and hoping the game ends before it's too late and it seems to work."
TrueDoTA2,3cy7wu,tricklaney,8,Sat Jul 11 23:55:33 2015 UTC,"As someone who loves playing Bristle, this is such an important point. The hero should be called Bristlebait. Oh yeah, you got him down to 10% health, just dive a little further, throw out another nuke. Oops, it didn't kill him, well dive a little further, nuke him again. So close, he's at like 20 hp just dive a little further. Oops, you're dead.  I always pick up Solar Crest on him as well as Crimson Guard then following that up with Heart. In a teamfight, I use solar crest to break up any fight. If they have someone like a Gyro soloing an ally, I put solar crest on Gyro so he misses and is vulnerable to the rest of our team or on the target so he gets evasion and more armor.  Honestly, I've missed playing Bristleback in the time when I was playing more supports. I think he could pair really well with more popular picks like Undying (goo + zombies + flesh golem? That looks good on you, mate!) and transition into a tanky mid/late-game fight-tipper with his high health, armor reduction, and constant AOE damage that a team can't just ignore but can't easily burst down."
TrueDoTA2,3cy7wu,Whilyam,2,Sun Jul 12 05:28:17 2015 UTC,"From my experience in high/very high skill pubs most bristles seem unable to put together a cogent build. I see everything from radiance ocarine rushes, early blademails and upgraded vanguards. All of these builds contradict bristles strengths as a right clicker due to his ad from warpath. Optimal builds should be making use of items such as sny and ac to really take advantage of him properly. I believe that safe lane bristle is Better than offlane but as long as you make sure you stack ancients and then farm them properly you can still secure your gold. Bristle shines as a midgame carry but if you are able to secure big items such as heart ac or skull basher he can't turn into a true right clicking force"
TrueDoTA2,3cy7wu,macham,2,Sun Jul 12 02:36:34 2015 UTC,"All of these builds contradict bristles strengths as a right clicker due to his ad from warpath   Octarine = survivability from stats + survivability from lifesteal from quill spray + faster warpath stacks + more -armor and slow on target + more mana pool. Octarine is most definitely a DPS item for Bristle, who does significantly more DPS as a fight drags on: survivability and mana pool is DPS for him. It is too expensive to rush unless you're absolutely snowballing though. You need to pick up a couple smaller items to hold you over until you finish it.  You should only be building bristle to right click if the opposing team is primarily ranged and never grouping up for teamfights. In a melee with several heroes nearby, you'll get much more mileage out of quill spray and the sustainability (health and mana pool) to actually use it than you will from right clicking. Forcing supports out of range of your backline heroes, being able to damage while remaining mobile, and generally being a major PITA helps your team more than trying to be a tankier version of a real carry. Pure right click potential like basher only helps you in the early game while fights involve a few heroes."

He didn't get much out of the new items, and any old utility items that he could go for situationally have been nerfed for non-int heroes.  That said, I think the new medallion item is REALLY good on him.  Definitely earns him a place in a tricore game with like LC, sf or bs, bh and jakiro/lina/lion or something."

He can't blink or shadow blade effectively.   And it will just become 3 cores with 2 supports go I soft suicidal initiation.

With a strong support, he can do this, even against trilanes.  His 1.8 BAT makes him rather difficult to run as a safelane farmer, because you need to get a lot done very early. His mid matchups are not incredible, either, although running him as a dual lane mid in a 2-2-1 setup is also probably fine.  Basically, he wants a lane partner, but he doesn't really want to be safelane. If you do run him in the safelane, you want to be running him with a dedicated split pusher like prophet or lycan. He needs some farm, and is effective on middling farm, but not really on low farm, and even on very high farm, he will not be able to carry hard post 45 minutes.  Basically, he's a very strong hero, but if you run him in the standard 3-1-1 it usually wastes him. That's probably why his winrate is rather low right now."

Those two reasons prompted me into making the video.
TrueDoTA2,3cuaop,eeyunn,4,Fri Jul 10 20:56:34 2015 UTC,"A max untouchable enchant at seven still has only as much HP as her items. The lack of even levels of heal mean she's paper to magic nukes.   She doesn't farm particularly fast and level 1-2 she's super weak. Heal has a sizable mana cost and untouchable can't make up for enchant not being able to tank auto attacks or stop an early push.   Core enchantress is honestly fine. But you need to cover enchant to secure her her stride.   I think necrobook first and multiple crickets isn't the build. I think ring or protection and full regen into basilius would be better. Then instead of necrobook, Atos.   It's kind of like windrunner offlane, it works when there's little pressure on the offlaner and when they are behind, it's dead weight and no impact. Relying on farm and right clicks as an offlaner are death sentences. Like Druid without space or timber saw without space.  If enchant has to spend 4 minutes AFK stacking, she's taking the jungle farm which leaves less hero possibilities for cores to farm the jungle during that early mid game. Also, enchant could've just done that level 1."
TrueDoTA2,3cuaop,wildtarget13,3,Sat Jul 11 00:13:04 2015 UTC,"You don't max untouchable by 7, you get 2 levels of it.  It's more like 2-1-2-1 at 6 and points from there based on the gamestate."
TrueDoTA2,3cuaop,Jmadman311,2,Mon Jul 13 14:37:32 2015 UTC,Highly opinion. I've seen both. I've also seen 1-1-4. It's situational based on how much magic damage and heal you want to help the team with.   You don't have to start with even levels to pivot situational levels.
TrueDoTA2,3cuaop,wildtarget13,3,Mon Jul 13 16:14:32 2015 UTC,"Really solid against heavy right click lineups, and even better against lineups that have lots of melee.    Be careful if the enemy team has significant nuke damage in lane, though.  For example a trilane with multiple stuns and nukes like luna + venge + Earthshaker.  They have the potential to nuke you down.  But against dual lanes you can easily out-contest most carries or their supports easily via untouchable and/or heal.   My favorite build for the offlane is 2x circlets, 2x branch start.  Picking up an early wand in lane, then either into bracer or soul ring.   Soul ring is really solid on Enchantress since the heal covers the cost by a huge degree, particularly if you're alone.  Plus it builds into bloodstone which is, imo, a better first item than scepter as it gives you the mana to spam impetus, along with a ton of bulk.  After that going with Slahser's way of necrobook seems solid or scepter if you don't think you need the melee range presence.    It's ultimately really strong, but weak against a few heroes:    Ursa - his attack speed is too high to give a crap about untouchable.  Windranger - Once she has ult, she can melt you easily with raw physical damage.  If she gets scepter before you have a way to deal with her windrun you probably lose.   As mentioned earlier, lanes with really high nuke damage can be rough.  If they have 2 supports that can nuke you you along with a carry who can as well, should be really defensive.    I think this is honestly a stronger way to play her than jungling, unless you have some other solo offlane who can dominate and an easily ganked mid on the enemy team."
TrueDoTA2,3cuaop,Drop_,3,Sat Jul 11 00:30:33 2015 UTC,"I've played this several times and for some reason I frequently run into the #1-2 ranked huskars when I solo queue (5k+ mmr). Every time I see those huskar pickers I just get enchantress offlane and shit on them. Enchantress is seriously the most ridiculous huskar hard counter.   Anyways, even against heroes that aren't huskar, enchantress offlane can be quite good. I wouldn't run it against a trilane, unless  it's a weak trilane and I have a lane partner, but it's quite good against most duos and dominates solo carries with few exceptions."
TrueDoTA2,3cuaop,jookz,3,Sat Jul 11 01:26:03 2015 UTC,"The whole point of enchant jungling is that she's super squishy at low levels and can't really do much to escape.

Otherwise I feel like her low hp makes her too unstable against a lot trilanes.  The hard part is that you want at least 1 point in enchant and max untouchable while still having enough to sustain. However, I feel like with an enchanted creep you probably can hit level 2-3. So it's probably worth the value point on radiant.  Later on you can contest the pull pretty well also with your MS and enchanting the harpy is really strong."

TrueDoTA2,3csnfl,Emnight,11,Fri Jul 10 13:22:42 2015 UTC,"Cons:   Missed opportunity cost of other boot upgrades. Phase is probably the best early game damage item, and offers near-BoTS like move speed when phased for 42% of the cost. Treads are one of the best early game stat items, affording you better right clicks, tankability, and the option of tread-switching. Tranquils are so cheap for so much regen and extra tankability.   Pros:   Allows you to quickly relocate to assist your allies. Allows you more mobility if you are down several towers early game (more TP targets).   And my favorite:   Allows you earlier slot efficiency.   This is why you will often see heroes like Silencer or Drow go x3 of their Circlet upgrades and then grab BoTS. You can stack some serious cheap stat items, grab BoTS, then build into 1 late game item while still have the overall stats to contribute in teamfights. If I want to build Shadow Blade into Scythe I will almost always go x3 Null + BoTS first."

Additionally they should not be compared as they are built for very different purposes. Ultimate Orb is built to build into a lategame item (which would be a great choice for post x3 upgrades + BoTs). Circlet upgrades are built to get early game stats so you are not useless while building your late game item and saving up for BoTS (plus you can throw unreliable gold at them if you are going to die before getting your BoTS).  3 Null Talismans:   1410 gold, 171 HP, 1.26 armor, 9 atk spd, 234 mana, 27 damage   1 Ultimate Orb:   2100 gold, 190 hp, 1.42 armor, 10 atk spd, 130 mana, 10 damage   So 3 Null Talismans cost 67% of an Ultimate Orb and can be bought almost instantly as soon as the gold comes up, instead of having to scrimp and save with shit stats for a long period of time. They give 19 less HP, .2 less armor, and 1 less attack speed. They give 104 more mana and 17 more damage.  Edit: Damn dude, insta-downvoting me for correcting you. That's cold."

TrueDoTA2,3csnfl,DeanofDeeps,8,Fri Jul 10 16:26:30 2015 UTC,"There are a few benefits of Midas you are missing out on:   Extra XP Reliable Gold   And as a neutral point - the way you farm with each is quite different.  I would probably break them down like:    BoTs Midas    Mobility XP   Wave Farm Reliable Gold   Move Speed Attack Speed      Anyway, BoTs tend to be good on heroes that can naturally ""flash farm"" like your Leshracs, Tinkers, etc. If they can split-push, that's a huge benefit too.  If you go for BoTs, then you need to make sure you can either:   Avoid fights for a while Get them fast, and then get other items before you fight   Midas is something you tend to see on heroes that want levels really badly, sometimes benefit from the minor attack speed, and sometimes benefit from the reliable gold (e.g. the old way of playing NP - a hero that could buy back and be anywhere in seconds).  I think both are seen relatively less though in this meta. Midas is for sure less prevalent. BoTs may seem more regular because of the amount of Leshrac picks, but generally it is a pick-up that requires a lot of space. Early and mid game fighting is more of a thing, so typically that will make Midas and BoTs both weaker item choices."

It's obviously strong but I feel it's easily as situational as Midas, if not more so. While the utility is always good, keep in mind that your team needs to make opportunities for you to either: (A) TP to farm safe lanes (B) TP straight into ganks over the 10-20 minutes immediately after your purchase in order for BoTs to actually accelerate your farm. If the two teams end up collapsing and death-balling early on, you'll just be dying more often or missing fights instead of accelerating your farm."
TrueDoTA2,3csnfl,Conpen,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:19:30 2015 UTC,"I agree with your points. I'd like to add that early BoTs are very strong on Ember spirit because his ult lets you travel both ways, which is great for sustaining farm or jumping back into a fight after a quick fountain trip.   I'm trying to figure out where in his item progression BoTs would fit best. I typically go phase > Aquila > BFury(x2). Getting phase and Aquila are good for fighting early and getting a few kills, If I scrap Aquila then the cost compared to BoTs remains the same but I lose some survivability and damage whilst gaining nearly 100% guaranteed mana/health sustain for spamming abilities to jungle and gank.   If I decide to go Aquila alongside BoTs I'm afraid that I won't be able to farm it efficiently enough and I'll waste time laning instead of ganking.  I'll try these item builds out and figure out which works best for me."
TrueDoTA2,3csnfl,Ailodierap,3,Fri Jul 10 15:13:55 2015 UTC,"I've seen Merlini and SingSing try BoTS rushes on Ember. They usually pair it with Drums + Aquila for stats to compensate, then rush either Skadi or Deso before going into their Battlefurys. Since you have BoTS the BFury regen is not really worthwhile early on, and there is an interesting ""lull"" in the game where you can get some time to farm up your large UAM, before going back to buying the small pieces of your BFury. Skadi and Deso both help your team out a lot, while sacrificing your own personal damage output a little, so they make more sense to get when you have BoTS that let you join every teamfight."
TrueDoTA2,3csnfl,freelance_fox,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:26:55 2015 UTC,"If I'm not mistaken there's also some inherent synergy with Maelstrom and Boots of Travel. Maelstrom lets you reliably clear creep waves faster, and Boots of Travel gives you more creep waves to farm. He can basically farm 2 lanes at once if he alternates Boots of Travel and ult between two lanes. Might wanna try a Bottle -> Aquila -> BoTs -> Maelstrom build maybe, to come online earlier?"

TrueDoTA2,3csnfl,cvuk,1 point,Sat Jul 11 15:07:49 2015 UTC,Treads give you nice attack speed which you lack prior to Yasha. Tread switching gives you a free blink a minute which is vital for the mana sustain with AM to clear enough camps fast.
TrueDoTA2,3csnfl,fearsomeduckins,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:17:01 2015 UTC,"BOTs as a farming item.. I don't think it's that good. Midas allows you to keep up your farm without having to devote a lot of time to farming, because you can just run past a creep, midas, and keep moving, so it's good if you're fighting a lot. With BOTS, you're still going to be needing a lot of time to clear camps and stuff. The speed will help you a little, but not that much. Catching lost waves is nice, and saving money later is nice too, but 2k gold is a lot in the early game for an item that only gives you move speed, wheras it's a bit less late game when people usually buy it. It's harder to farm up than midas, and generally is also probably less impactful than midas. You can reach fights, but you're weaker when you get there, so it's a trade off. I don't want to go so far as to say it would never be good, but I don't think it's good enough to recommend generally getting one over a midas. Not unless the mobility is also going to be very useful."
TrueDoTA2,3csnfl,IAmNotACreativeMan,0,Fri Jul 10 13:34:04 2015 UTC,"I agree that they're great on some carries instead of midas, but don't forget that midas gives reliable gold, which can save you a lot too as long as you're good about buying before you die."

And teamfight awareness is at least intimately associated with mechanical skill (clicking/pressing keys at the right time), because it's physically difficult to keep track of the position/mana/hp/CD:s of 10 heroes in a big teamfight, and your ability to do this has a huge impact on your micro decision-making and ability to prioritize between different mechanical operations.

If you forget to use Sleight of Fist to dodge a stun, that's another theoretical/strategy failure. If you mess up the timing and get stunned, that's mechanical."
TrueDoTA2,3csmfw,eeyunn,3,Sat Jul 11 03:53:59 2015 UTC,"As far as I know, it's mostly clicking in the right spots at the right time. Basically the less misclicks = the better your mechanical skill. This can range from clutch blinks to disjoint/dodge spells to being able to target the right unit on a reflex.  Some people might extend the definition to include some other actions such as stacking jungle camps while clearing them (I consider that more of a farming ability thing but a simple misclick could screw it up I guess).  One thing of note is that mechanical skill does NOT equal having a high APM. It's about making significantly efficient actions with those clicks."

His point is that the money could be spent on much better items; you would be better off stacking Skadis over picking up Greaves. You only have 6 item slots, so when you're picking up Greaves, you are replacing an alternate item with it.  Greaves is great for Medusa, but not great on her. Your team should be picking it up, but she needs to be spending money on items that let her carry. Greaves offer tankability, but no damage which is not ideal on any carry outside of Bristle or Huskar.

I mean maybe if the ehp from the burst is really more than you get from a vanilla skadi, but even then you're missing out on vital actives, and your position 3 or 4 can give you the aura/burst anyway."

They allow you to die once, buy back, and immediately rejoin the fight.  In a game where you are playing Dusa and have Manta/Skadi/Satanic/Butterfly/Crit (28000g), another hero on your team should have at least purchased Mek.  Swapping between BoT and GG, besides costing another 5300 gold (which could have gone to a consumed Moonshards) leaves you the possibility that your courier gets sniped or is on the wrong side of the map when you need BoT to travel back to the fight."

Now, note that i don't imply that it's good, because as we can see, it's not really that good (greaves that is), even though i can easily think of worse yet popular item choices here.

TrueDoTA2,3cssmw,PepperJohn,3,Fri Jul 10 20:53:15 2015 UTC,"Here's the end all to this argument.  The main draw of greaves is the replenishment and the passive. Medusa doesn't build armor. If you build armor on medusa,  you're doing it wrong. You want more stats (or hp/mana), which this doesn't give you a lot of. It gives you some, but I don't think decreasing your dps as a 1v5 hero is smart. The purge might be nice,  but the passive is nearly useless on her."
TrueDoTA2,3crx5q,phophophopho,2,Fri Jul 10 07:40:32 2015 UTC,"Dirty lesh spammer here.  You need to get a very good block, and then play safe, farm where you can, and make sure you get your levels. With heroes like storm or windrunner, you should go for a kill at level 6, preferably with a gank from a support, or if lesh stands in river or on your high ground (leshes will feel very safe because they can spam lightning to slow you)  Once you hit level 6, if you're having a really tough time, push out the lane, and then gank a side lane. The momentum from getting a kill can sometimes throw the enemy mid off, they might try to gank a side lane in retaliation, leaving you to free farm mid or counter the gank, whichever you feel is better.  Storm is actually quite a tough matchup, so I try not to play him vs leshrac. I prefer someone with long range, windrunner is one of my favourite mids, so I tend to fall back on that, lina is another good option, since lesh has low hp/armour early on, so you can usually harass him well with slave and your long range right click.  If you're a good ember spirit player, you can have a good time vs lesh, I'm not personally a good ember player though.   Clinkz is ok, you can dodge lightning by going invis, and if lesh gets out of position, you can kill him really quickly.   Laning stage aside, you need a bkb, even if you don't like it, even if your hero doesn't normally build bkb early or at all. You buy bkb vs lesh, ideally after your first big item (on windrunner, I go aghs, bkb, then deso for example, and go for early towers to make it harder for lesh and the enemy carry to farm, because lesh is scary when he gets ahead; he's easy to deal with if he has less farm than you. On lina, same, aghs then bkb. On Clinkz, orchid then bkb, or bkb first if we have a bad early game). Another item choice, is that you generally want to go for stats/hp over armor, this is true vs any magical nukers, but especially against lesh.  I think TA probably can work. I would suggest playing a few games vs lesh, to learn his animations and general style, so you can predict when he'll spam, and use refraction at the right time.  Huskar sounds like a good counter, and he is good vs lesh, but you have to be careful, because a good lesh will itemize to screw you (blademail, orchid, shivas) and will usually still win the lane. I've not yet lost vs huskar as leshrac - maybe that's because I've not played vs a good huskar, but he's not a slam dunk counter in my experience. Lesh has a decent right click in the early game, and can keep that pressure up with orchid, and after the laning phase, a good leshrac will always be with teammates."
TrueDoTA2,3crx5q,pepe_le_shoe,2,Fri Jul 10 07:57:38 2015 UTC,"Lina's range is certainly an advantage, but Leshrac has 800 range on his Lightning, and 750 on Split Earth, so trying to land a single hit on him can end up badly. Pair that with his base 320 MS and you have a mad goat that is difficult to escape from.   Ember has just 10 MS less than Leshrac, but still I don't think he can do anything without extra help. The Fire Shield gets melted in a second against Leshrac's Lightning + Split Earth, so trying to zone him out isn't easy (you could always go for SoF and try to dodge the stun though).  I should try Windranger."
TrueDoTA2,3crx5q,banyt,2,Fri Jul 10 08:10:45 2015 UTC,"Ember is horrible against Leshrac. Maybe if he's blind and has no mana.  the thing about Lina is that it's a lot harder for him to hit you with lightning because you outrange the lightning bounce, so he has to catch you out of position or cast it on you directly, which makes it difficult for him to stun you.  your damage also allows you to kill him easily early/mid."
TrueDoTA2,3crx5q,pepe_le_shoe,2,Fri Jul 10 08:25:02 2015 UTC,"Lina's range is certainly an advantage, but Leshrac has 800 range on his Lightning, and 750 on Split Earth, so trying to land a single hit on him can end up badly. Pair that with his base 320 MS and you have a mad goat that is difficult to escape from.   Implicit in all of this, is that you know how to play mid. The basics of how to harass, how to deal with spam, are universal, and apply to 90% of mid matchups, so I didn't really want to get into that.   You will always have to deal with lightning vs leshrac, yep, of course. But you've still got to be there. Get your bottle (bottle right after lightning hits you), get wand, get treads (don't dream of getting any other boot, you need the hp), and play a safe, defensive mid game, keep the creep wave back - easy if lesh spams lightning, and abuse vision to let you harass him.    trying to zone him out    I think you've misunderstood what I'm saying. You are NOT going to zone out a lesh. Forget any dream of zoning him out, certainly don't try it in a game, he will kill you.  QoP is another hero I forgot to mention. If you can catch lesh out of position as a QoP, you can often get a kill, but you've still got to lane safely otherwise. I'd say QoP vs Lesh is 50/50. QoP also doesn't mind building aghs->bkb->orchid, all great vs lesh."
TrueDoTA2,3crx5q,Lazarous86,1 point,Fri Jul 10 08:28:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah wind ranger is my go to I'd I want to win mid. She is also one of the hardest carries in the game if you go scepter build. She had the best range nuke in the game, a move speed increase for rune control, and one of the longest stuns in the game. She is definitely a high skill cap hero, but can beat any of the favorable mids right now. Owns them all late game too because she is physical dps queen."
TrueDoTA2,3crx5q,banyt,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:37:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah I really love playing with her, I just didn't see her as a good pick against Leshrac. On the other hand, hitting two powershots is enough to get him out of the lane due to this small HP pool. In addition to that, he must go behind the creep wave to cast his spells, so that's an easy opportunity for shackle+powershot+1-2 auto-attacks. Will give it a try."
TrueDoTA2,3crx5q,pepe_le_shoe,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:47:32 2015 UTC,"I think Ember is horrible because his guard can be broken easily and because he is very vulnerable to harass.

It lets you push down the enemy towers even faster, and most heroes will die faster from ult+deso, which means you don't have to dive as hard, and they can't run away.  If I'm the best candidate for lategame right click, then I get daedalus."
TrueDoTA2,3crx5q,TommyVeliky,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:08:26 2015 UTC,"My favorite suggestion from your post is Clinkz actually. Running him mid, using invis exclusively to dodge lightning, and orb-walk harassing the squishy goat-man with Burning Arrows sounds like a good build to me. Plus you force the enemy supports to buy detection if they gank you."
TrueDoTA2,3crx5q,pepe_le_shoe,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:23:02 2015 UTC,"Clinkz gets destroyed against Leshrac. Skeleton Walk's cool down makes using it as a lightning mitigator pretty laughable.

TrueDoTA2,3crx5q,Infrisios,2,Sat Jul 11 19:34:29 2015 UTC,"So the moral of the story - don't play aggressively against Leshrac, it's just not a good idea.

TrueDoTA2,3crx5q,L3vathiaN-,2,Fri Jul 10 08:32:17 2015 UTC,"Not being aggressive and not harassing are not the same thing. You should be harassing him where you can. But don't try double waving or standing on his high ground. If the wave is in the middle of the river, or on his high ground, you're in a bad spot. You should be blocking most waves a little bit to keep the wave way far back on your high ground."

I'm used to being the guy that will dive your tower at level 3 and beat the crap out of you. I want my opponent to be afraid to move further than his highground. I want to force him out of the lane at any cost, and I want him to be terrified when he sees me coming back with a full bottle. Sadly, I can't do that against this hero in particular."
TrueDoTA2,3crx5q,Mezkh,2,Fri Jul 10 09:05:33 2015 UTC,"My main mid heroes also don't work too well against Lesh. So far, Nyx seems to be the best option. Lesh's slow animations give plenty of time to use Spiked Carapace before getting hit by Lightning Storm while also preventing a followup safe Split Earth. Most Leshs seem to be a tad greedy, so I often manage to bait them a bit, then reflect Lightning Storm, turn around and kill. A 1/max/1-build is a valid option when facing Lesh.  Zeus is a good pick, too. Just stand away when he comes close and use arc to lasthit creeps while harassing Lesh. It's basically giving him some of his own medicine."
TrueDoTA2,3crx5q,mjjdota,1 point,Fri Jul 10 10:14:47 2015 UTC,"I like Zeus against Leshrac. Zeus can farm just as well, is pretty deadly himself and can help all his sidelanes win just by hitting level 6. On the other hand has eddict's pushing power. But in general, a pretty even match for Leshrac.   Also, Dragon Knight. Stick, Bottle, Helmet of Iron Will, Treads, Armlet, Shadow Blade is my build when mid against Leshrac. Leshrac actually relies on his right click a whole lot. With your Breath spam you make him lose percentage of his damage and force him to use Lightning to last hit effectively. With your crazy regen and armor, low levels of diabolic don't do much so he relies on his 2 nukes, which you can manage surviving with a moderate health pool and the defensive early item build. 3-0 against Leshracs at mid 4Ks.  And of course, Outworld Devourer."

You'll notice that when he hits 6 he'll be playing extremely defensively since you can one shot him with either hero. If he is smart you'll only win the lane by a few cs since he can spam aoe.  Dragon Slave range is insane. If skills are even both of you will take / avoid harass, then level 6 comes and Leshrac can't approach the wave, he has to spam and keep you back which will give you some free denies. Or if he's careless he dies.  QoP matchup is much easier than consensus indicates imo. You can use lightning storm as a cue to blink in and combo him, dodging it and dealing a bunch of damage. Without lighning, split earth is an easy dodge, and he'll be missing a lot of damage. At 6 you can one-shot him.  Pugna is mentioned in the comments, he crushes Leshrac, just a straight hard counter.  Lesh is one of the easiest mid heroes to gank, so set the expectation with your supports from the get-go that they should smoke gank the Leshrac frequently."

TrueDoTA2,3crx5q,winterymint,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:20:56 2015 UTC,"From personal experience:  Windrunner - great vs lesh. with your attack range you can avoid getting hit by storm, windrun helps you dodge the split earth if things get real, powershot allows you to pressure leshrac without giving him the opportunity to respond. the key is staying on your HG as much as possible so that you can powershot for 1-2 CS + harass without being seen. lesh animation is great, but WR can compete, so you can get some pretty good farm.  Zeus - having some success as him lately. get 2 clarities, 2 branches, 2 pulled tangos, rush bottle. go for 2-0-1, then max W. Zeus doesn't really win vs Lesh, but you can pressure him a lot and there is really no way lesh can kill you if you don't misplay badly. Zeus is pretty good vs lesh later on because you can output a lot of DPS without risking your life.  Overall, you can defeat Lesh on any hero.

TrueDoTA2,3cqt35,Spooky_Nocturne,11,Fri Jul 10 01:02:35 2015 UTC,"4k player with a 70%+ winrate on Prophet here. My core on Prophet is going to be x2-3 early Null Talismans, Treads, Blademail, Blink, and a TP scroll. I will choose Prophet to jungle (preferred), solo versus a dual lane, mid, or take in an aggressive dual lane with my allies (good if they can’t defend versus early split push or have no way to deal with Sprout). I almost always go 1/4/2/1 unless it is a passive as hell game, in which case I will ward up their jungle and farm it in an attempt to starve them out and guarantee my team an advantage.  Always check mids starting items and anticipate when their bottle will arrive. Try to snipe it with your W before the 3 minute mark (grab a TP scroll to GTFO after before the attempt). Bottle can be situational if no one else on your team needs it and your lane requires regen. Bottle is almost as efficient on Prophet as Tinker, but NP is much more desperate for slots which is why it’s not core. He can almost always get a guaranteed rune if you have wards up to guarantee his safety.  Always think to yourself “If this enemy shows up by this ally, can we go? Should I tell them to get ready for my TP?” and communicate with your team when you plan to go. Also let them know if you are watching and ready to give back-up. If your team is losing a team fight and you can’t contribute by sniping a weak enemy or sprouting someone to save an ally, immediately start split pushing across the map until the enemy team has been unaccounted for for at least ~4 seconds (draft/game state depending).  The early stats and Blademail are all about making things happen, learn basic jungle micro so you can stare at the minimap and get ready to fight.  I do not choose Prophet if Blademail is not good versus the enemy draft, but Blademail is very strong this meta and most likely will be a good pick-up. As soon as I get my boots up I will be actively pushing my team to start fighting and once I get Blademail that will be my focus. I will switch out Blink if they have strong anti-blink heroes, like Spectre, Beastmaster, Nyx, etc.  My main builds are:    Solar Crest/AC/Deso if I have a strong primary carry who would benefit from evasion and the increased physical damage. This is my preferred “generic” build if I don’t need to adapt my playstyle and should be picked if you don’t need to counter the opponent with your items and there are tons of skirmishes early on. Silver Edge/Scythe if they have a strong carry who relies on their passives. Silver Edge into Scythe guarantees a ton of lockdown and prevents them from defending when we gank. Don’t be afraid to grab Silver Edge even if they have tons of detection- treat it like a Hex or Abyssal and just pop it in the middle of a fight. Just because you can initiate with it doesn’t mean you have to. Mjollnir/Necro/Deso/AC if we need a generic split-pusher, are versus opponents who clump (like a Necro or PL), or we have wombo combo teammates like Seer or Enigma. Midas/Dagon/EBlade/Aghs/Octarine if I get a few early game kills and am snowballing. Also worth considering if you have magic amp on your team, if you have a Bloodseeker or someone who makes opponents go Ghost Scepter, or if they just have very squishy heroes.   Note that each build has 1 mana item you can get by the midgame, it’s generally inefficient to stack more than that unless you really need the CC. I would only go Scythe + Orchid versus a hard to lock down hero like a Storm or Weaver.  Situational items to consider are:   Orchid: If your team needs an early silence to shut down slippery heroes. This is never core, this is not the meta to mindlessly rush Orchid without a specific objective in mind. Invis items: Lothars is great if you need to make space for your team and force the enemy to invest in detection. Glimmer is superb if they have tons of magic nukes and you want to lend your team some utility because you will be showing up to teamfights. Grab either if you need help escaping from split pushes and want to be the #YoloSpaceLord. Wards: As Prophet you have unprecedented warding ability. If your supports are dying trying to ward, volunteer for the position. Remember you can TP to high ground, ward, then TP scroll out safely. You can also stack shift queue orders to immediately invis/blink after warding as well. If your supports aren’t buying wards, buy them yourself. You have a global TP, guaranteeing yourself safe TPs will pay for the wards 3  times over. Lotus Orb: If your team needs a Purge, this also makes Bounty Hunter useless. Great if you’re quick on the draw versus long cast heroes, such as Doom. If you’re going all-in on invis items, definitely pick this up as a supplement to Purge dusts, etc. too. Vlads: If you team needs more tank and lifesteal, or someone already has an AC and you want to amp up your split push. MKB: Grab vs blind or evasion, remember to pick-up vs heroes like KoTL, Troll, or Brood. Force Staff: Mostly just vs Clock or if I have a Techies/Pudge, but analyze the game state- it can be game winning sometimes. Also pick-up if you need a Linken’s popper. Greaves: If you are in a stack, this can really make a difference and NP usually has the early game space needed to rush it. Great synergy for games where multiple allies will be going Blademail or when you need to help your team recover from AOE damage abilities. I will never get Daedalus on NP, as I would much rather have the utility that an Abyssal lends you. I don't believe NP can outcarry most opponents, so I like to stick to the semi-carry concept and build around disrupting the enemy team.   Edit: Wow this got long. Went back in and bolded item builds/skill level so it is more digestible."

Early global TP is underrated in ganks when you have an early Sprout level. You help with support stuff and if it's a good Sprout game, I rush a blink so I can blink Sprout and have an escape whenever I'm pushing. Otherwise, I build Mek into Greaves and ask my team to group and push if appropriate and then build into other utility support stuff. Glimmer is good, Medallion into Solar Crest is good, Necro is if you're rich. Hex is always good if you can get the cash, otherwise just build for the heroes in your game."

He is one of the most versatile heroes around in term of builds, you can have him an early game fighter (as a nulls/blademail rush or with a orchid build), as a nuker (dagon into eblade/veil - i dont really like this), as a building pusher (necronomicon rush or just a quick desolator, or both), as a heavy farmer (midas, or/and a quick maelstrom, which is also gold for quicker creepwave push).   Also he often get a mobility/escape item, vut you can either get a blonk daggero or a shadow blade, or both.  Going into late game, there is an absolute outstanding range of items you can get. Vyse, mjollnir, daedalus, mkb, cuirass, shivas, bkb, i heard of people going manta. Aghs and refresher are viable too.  Really, you can get anything.

You get in a lot less trouble that way, and you should be using normal NP things like map awareness + tp to stay out of trouble.

This means I can't pick NP unless my team can manage playing 4v5 and not get wiped.   I don't like the nulls+blademail-build at all.

TrueDoTA2,3cpsv1,futbolbrasil,17,Thu Jul 9 20:18:34 2015 UTC,i'd keep the aquila and give the bottle to a trusted support as its one of the few items that is shareable and the aquila can be broken down to build other items it all depends on the flow of the game.
TrueDoTA2,3cpsv1,thunderust,7,Thu Jul 9 21:18:39 2015 UTC,"If you have 3 legit item plus boots & tp, you should probably sell the Aquila first.  Other teammates will have bought Vlads and other pushing/teamfight items (you could even instruct your no item having 5-role to pick an Aquila up).  The possibility of coming across a DD or haste rune while you're still gathering for push is too great to pass up, and a bottled regen rune could turn a game completely if you barely survive a teamfight."
TrueDoTA2,3cpsv1,James_McNulty,3,Thu Jul 9 20:36:27 2015 UTC,no item having 5-role to pick an Aquila up   Probably just a basi maybe a vlads unless their agi they don't get stronger from Aquila much and its still mana and armor aura.

TrueDoTA2,3cpsv1,Skyro620,0,Thu Jul 9 23:06:33 2015 UTC,"you don't have to be TPing to fountain that much really.

TrueDoTA2,3cpsv1,ProfessorMonocle,1 point,Sat Jul 11 01:59:28 2015 UTC,"Kind of depends on the game and hero. Generally if I feel wand has been able to stack up and impact with the crucial burst mana/heal I keep it, but for the rune hoarding reasons bottle definitely keeps its value much better for later stages of game.   Aquila over stick anyday to me, I'm a huge fan of the item on agi carries. I personally value it over bottle too, especially if going BKB somewhat fast. Can't really argue against the power of bottled runes still."
TrueDoTA2,3cpsv1,Joelramones,2,Thu Jul 9 22:56:59 2015 UTC,Generally the Aquila. Bottle is actually really great and provides so much utility with regen and bottling runes.
TrueDoTA2,3cpsv1,Gaston44,2,Thu Jul 9 23:16:13 2015 UTC,"Aquila can be disassembled into three separate parts (wraith band, sage's mask, ring of protection) and bottle can be useful for another hero on your team or for quick responses later on in lategame. If you just defended a T3 by yourself vs 3 heroes while your teammates were dead and you have to go back to heal up, do you really want to wait for the fountain heal? Probably not. It's way quicker to drop items that make you tanky and spam bottle."
TrueDoTA2,3cpsv1,Jackolope,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:46:12 2015 UTC,"Well I always build bottle and Aquila on SF and I usually ditch bottle first and keep a Aquila as long as I can, the cost efficiency is very good, and it becomes to a point where you can raze for days haha"
TrueDoTA2,3cpsv1,demon_eater,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:44:52 2015 UTC,"Depends on your ability to use runes and your teams ability to secure runes. TA with a haste rune is top 5 scariest things in the game at 15 minutes.  If you use spells to farm a lot keep the bottle, its way better for mana than aquila (one bottle charge of mana is around 90 seconds of aquila mana regen). If you farm mostly through just right clicking then keep the aquila. If someone else on your team is keeping their bottle, that's more incentive to dump yours since it's more runes to ration."

TrueDoTA2,3cpsv1,Mercynary5,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:52:11 2015 UTC,"I usually decide based on the situation and hero.  For example, I would always sell aquila instead of bottle on a Naga as you have to TP out home quite often and you are frequently near rune spots because you are jungling/ running around/ sending out illusions and not fighting/ taking towers most of the time.  On someone like an SF I d rather sell bottle as I will deathball and fight with my team a lot and I can really use the damage and armor increase."
TrueDoTA2,3coj86,Carnot_AoR,4,Thu Jul 9 14:44:01 2015 UTC,"I think the disadvantages are more nuanced than what is written. Not having quas falls under ""delays QE"" but that's a bit more complex:   No forge spirits for last hitting/harass. No cold snap if someone ganks your lane (from either team). No defensive spell in case you get ganked (cold snap/ice wall)   So I think lvl 3 wex is too greedy if you're planning on going QE Invoker. There are players (and pros) who have taken an early point in wex, but I believe that's done later in the level 4-7 range. (Also, I believe this is done primarily for access to tornado and sometimes ghost walk, not alacrity/chaos meteor.)"
TrueDoTA2,3coj86,vple,4,Thu Jul 9 16:34:06 2015 UTC,"Fair points.  -Alacrity is much better than low level Forge Spirits for last hitting/harass, and doesn't have a downside unlike FS, which are squishy and feed away gold exp.  -You are weaker defensively until 5, but offensively you are much stronger. You trade Cold Snap (some stun, negligible damage) for Chaos Meteor and Alacrity (lots of damage).   -Again, you are a bit weaker defensively. You have to make a judgement as to how likely you are to be ganked and whether 1 Quas Cold Snap/Ice Wall would make a difference. The counterpoint is that build is much, much better at getting last hits and flash farming and very reliable at doing so."
TrueDoTA2,3coj86,eastendhero,4,Thu Jul 9 16:47:33 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's fair to deride this build for lack of defensive options when most top mids this patch are notoriously gankable (storm, SF, lesh, etc.). In essence, what you're suggesting is to build invoker to approximate the capabilities of these other mids."
TrueDoTA2,3coj86,eastendhero,2,Thu Jul 9 18:59:08 2015 UTC,"Not deriding it, its just a weakness of the build relative to classic QE. However, in my opinion you get a lot more than you lose."

TrueDoTA2,3coj86,mriswith-,3,Thu Jul 9 19:16:29 2015 UTC,"I like it, I'm going to try it a few times.   Invoker needs innovation and cold snap sucks early anyways. This could help how weak he is in lane these days."
TrueDoTA2,3coj86,kcmyk,2,Fri Jul 10 01:05:51 2015 UTC,"Thanks for trying it out, could you get back to me on how it works out for you?"
TrueDoTA2,3coj86,Jascrer,2,Fri Jul 10 01:15:52 2015 UTC,"Tried it a few times, in the end I think it's inferior. My findings:  Good   Great for harassing the enemy mid laner, better than standard q/e Less mana issues since alacrity is so cheap   Bad   You desperately miss the quas regen, which is sort of solved by bottle, but bottle is useless after the laning phase and a waste of gold. I found myself trying to skip the bottle but having a hard time.  No early forge spirit for stacking If going double forged build, the delay in the 4th quas is very noticeable Suited Euls rush build pretty well, but again the bottle hurts the euls timing pretty badly.    I would do this build instead of standard q/e against a weak laner like a pudge and then skip bottle. I don't think I'd do it otherwise."
TrueDoTA2,3coj86,kcmyk,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:33:40 2015 UTC,"On the other hand, you can take much more advantage of runes.   QE invoker isn't even suposed to be runing around getting runes, to be honest. You'll just delay your midas. Unless dem bounty runes, but even then I think just getting a basi ring is enough.   While you have much more offensive potential, the lack of Cold Snap makes it somewhat easier to gank you.   This makes no sense. With Wex you should be harder to gank with Ghost Walk (unless they get detection), Tornado and QWE."
TrueDoTA2,3coj86,kcmyk,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:59:12 2015 UTC,"Why isn't he ""supposed to""? Historically he hasn't, but SF historically didn't get Mek either. Its a resource he hasn't used, a resource which has been buffed recently so his lack of use of it hurts him more and more.  You don't get Quas until 5 or 6, so you lack escape until then. The window of increased vulnerability is level 3-4/5."
TrueDoTA2,3coj86,kcmyk,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:21:35 2015 UTC,"Still, Invoker doesn't get much out of the runes.  Example:  - Bounty, extra gold but you could get it on lane because you are not going to get a bottle if you go for a basi first (super cost efficient).  -Double damage: well that was the point of alacrity which buffs your damage. -Haste: QE is not a ganker except for SS. -Regen: the only rune you'll have to run for because of your constant use of alacrity, metheor, blast. -Illusion: pretty useless. More damage is good but eventhought Invoker is always built to lategame in QE and more to midgame with QW"
TrueDoTA2,3coj86,kcmyk,2,Thu Jul 9 22:44:39 2015 UTC,"The primary point of the  bottle is regen, so you can crow just as well as rune control, but this is true for most heroes. Bounty gives EXP as well, which is quite valuable for Invoker. DD is 50-60 more damage, which is nothing to scoff at. QE can gank with haste if the lane has a disable (eg. ally stun->meteor->alacrity autoattacks). Illusion is usually useless, but you can stack with them and farm those later."
TrueDoTA2,3coj86,kcmyk,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:48:17 2015 UTC,"You shouldn't be rune controling, your supports should. The time you waste getting runes you could be in the lane farming. DD gives damage to last hit, you won't be able to kill anyone with it unless they are dumb. Crowing with invoker is a waste of courier for your team mates."
TrueDoTA2,3coj86,kcmyk,2,Fri Jul 10 01:08:00 2015 UTC,"The exact same thing could be said of SF, doesn't make bottle bad on him.   The threat of a bottled DD is quite present. The fact that he can or 5-shot you with DD and Alacrity means you have to play far back, lest a support rotate."
TrueDoTA2,3coj86,kcmyk,2,Fri Jul 10 01:11:23 2015 UTC,"SF can push the lane and actually flash farm, your way of playing Invoker is using a 40 second CD skill to farm a stack and then get back to the lane. SF gets a Mek which is over 300 mana cost and very important for all the team."
TrueDoTA2,3coj86,sjb7,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:23:51 2015 UTC,"The point of QE(-3W) is so you can push the wave and flash-farm. That's why you get the early point in Wex. (Also, you'd push out the wave with Alacrity and use Meteor to farm the stack, since it takes out most the creeps HP by itself.)  My point was people used to not go Mek SF, then it was found to work. Item builds change.  To give a parallel, theoretical example: If the mid-Necrolyte build had been to have high levels in Sadist early, then he wouldn't have gotten bottle. If it then changed to early Death Pulse max, he would get bottle because that build needs it. Same here: QE and QW don't need bottle, QE(-3E) is potentially more effective and does. History doesn't matter, what works does."
TrueDoTA2,3coj86,Avenu,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:45:47 2015 UTC,"You do not flash farm with a 40 second Cd skill. And you certainly don't push the wave AND flash farm with it. Flash farming is having a Blink and a Battlefury, or clearing multiple jungle camps or stacks with Razes, after you did the same in the lane, and in a fast manner.  People went SF on Mek and started picking him for many reasons. Meta changes (Minus armor meta on the last patch/Mek more valuable because of early fights in this patch), SF buffs (Raze buff), him having a good mana pool to sustain the Mek, after the nerf to it (super hard to use it reliably on Razor and Viper now) and farming it faster, besides being a good early item to tank him up with team utility. Also, SF scales better than Razor and Viper. People just found a way to play SF differently based on items; instead of going midas, going mid/early game items, because he suddently became a good pick due to the changes to the meta game around him and the buffs to Razes. And we're talking about a skill build, not item build.  And the SF case is much deeper than this. He is prefered on Radiant by a large marging and is only picked on Dire as a deny pick in pro games.  Any Invoker that wants to deal damage in a reasonably timing needs a Midas because of how exort scallings work.  Your Necro comparison is dumb. People don't max Sadist early because you'll be useless in lane and in fights, you do jackshit with him. People don't go the build you're sugesting on Invoker because it's substancially less usefull in fights, skirmishes and pushes than the regular ones, plus being a terrible build to farm, which is what you're trying to sell here. You cannot possibly flash farm with invoker and with that build you can't resort to the jungle and get back to the lane safely without getting punished in farm or no spells/mana to cast a thing (in before bottle crow)."
TrueDoTA2,3coj86,Avenu,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:59:26 2015 UTC,"You can flash farm with an ability that instagibs the creepwave or takes out most of a neutral's HP (Chaos Meteor, which has a 55s CD). When you want to clear your stack, you push out the wave with Alacrity then rotate.  the point        your head  ""People went QE(-3W) on Invoker for many reasons. Meta changes (stronger laners that can flash-farm became favored), nerfs to his base damage (bonus damage from Exort and Alacrity more needed), nerfs to Quas skills (Forge Spirits apply less -armor max, less armor, HP, magic resist, range; Cold Snap far less damage early), buffs to Alacrity (100 mana to 45 mana), buffs to bottle heroes (two runes at each spawn)...""  You talked about why a hero build changed. I'm telling you why a different heroes build needs to change and how.  Any Invoker that wants a reasonably timed midas needs to be able to last hit in lane despite having pitiful base damage, as well as the ability to flash farm waves and stacks."
TrueDoTA2,3cmk7b,Novadreamer,12,Thu Jul 9 01:57:28 2015 UTC,"He needs to farm more than before to be as reliable. The 15 dmg nerf to melee really hurt his laneing stage. The vision change and ultimate duration sucks but not overnerfed imo.  I don't think he can be mid lane against the popular kids like qop, sf, lesh and storm like old troll was played. So he is religated to the safe lane where he needs the supports more than the previous patch to zone out the offlaners.   Items are still phase/aquila/wand/hod into bkb/sny/satanic/skadi/silver edge/mkb/blink depending on game.  I actually think he's really good vs bloodseeker since he can man fight him if he comes close. Any heros who don't have a disengage are still food to a farmed troll.  He is definitely playable in the carry roll but he needs his team to do more lifting than before."
TrueDoTA2,3cmk7b,MrPineocean,5,Thu Jul 9 02:16:24 2015 UTC,"I agree. He's gone from so strong as to always pick him, to only be picked when his strengths are needed.

For example, what does he do better/worse than Juggernaut or Ursa?"
TrueDoTA2,3cmk7b,AnalysisSitus,5,Thu Jul 9 10:09:02 2015 UTC,"His main strength is still his strong laning ability.  The ability to last hit at range as a melee hero, to use his axes to slow or to cause the enemy to miss, and his chance to bash at lvl 1.  This means that despite his nerf which means he needs to safelane with a support, that support is much freer to roam, or can give a lane early aggressive potential.  Jugg and Ursa need phase boots before they can chase anyone down, troll can do it from lvl 2.  I don't know which line ups he fits into now, I just know he still has unique strengths."

TrueDoTA2,3cmk7b,punriffer5,4,Fri Jul 10 17:46:35 2015 UTC,"His laning used to be super easy mode. Then they fixed him not getting attack speed on the first hit from fervor.   He got super strong and almost ungankable and impossible to ignore since he takes objectives like roshan and towers with ease. He also gives your team tons of free DPS.  The this is, he is still all of these things, but can be outlaned with heores with more damage and range.  All heroes are worth learning, if anything to know the thresholds of the hero when you play aginst it. Maybe you'll end up liking the hero. Switching from ranged to melee is a very niche thing that only troll has to learn."
TrueDoTA2,3cmk7b,wildtarget13,2,Thu Jul 9 09:16:23 2015 UTC,"Low skill MMR shitter here + I've only had a little bit of time to play him this patch, so take what I say with some salt.  You can't take him mid anymore. His base damage is too low. He's too weak in the lane for him to not be a liability in the laning phase.  You need to play him safelane farmer. Mechanics-wise, a lot of the neat tricks that were possible with whirling axes last patches are no longer possible with the vision changes. He's a little boring to play right now. Here are some Troll-specific tips:   Blink troll can drag the melee whirling axes across a team. If you're going to sneak rosh early, you probably need HotD with an Ice Ogre giving you armor. I don't think any other creep enables you to tank Rosh well enough to not die. OoV on Troll is very good if you have any kind of killing potential in your lane. The melee/ranged interaction on OoV is kinda cool. If you can wait to get in melee form for your first hit, you can refresh the 12% slow from range. Coupled with the ranged axes slow and fervor, you can force people out of lane or go for kills. Maximize your damage from melee whirling axes by cutting trees and drawing creep aggro when you're farming. Note that the axes don't work on Roshan and most ancients. You can still stack a camp with the ranged axes from behind cliffs if you time it a second or two before your normal stack time. If the black dragons are in your ancient camp, they'll aggro with the ranged axes. However, you can't use it to scout uphill anymore.  Don't be afraid to use your ultimate to farm. If you have a large stack you need to clear, use your melee axes and your ultimate. Part of the finesse in playing Troll is knowing when to switch between melee and ranged forms. For example, if you are not quite close enough to an enemy for melee attacks but you need a bash to secure a kill, you should switch to ranged to throw your slow, then switch to melee and phase in.  Switch between melee to ranged when you're regenerating health since Q moves your HP pool. Think of it like tread switching. Timing your phase is pretty important since it's your primary means of initiation unless you go shadow blade or blink. Phase is pretty unique on troll since with max Q he can run at you at close to max movement speed.   Skill build is generally:    L Q W E R S    1  1      2 1 1      3 1 2? 1?     6 1 3 1 1    7 1 4 1 1    11 4 4 1 2    16 4 4 4 3 1    You may decide to max Q or E first depending on your needs, but I prefer having the nukes maxed out. If you're predicting a more passive game, max Q and maybe E as well before maxing out W. If you think you will push a lot early, max e second then max Q. It seems goofy but this is how I used to play him before he got popular and it's still a legit choice.  As far as items go for troll, I typically go for a three-regen build on the hero. 1 salve + 2 tangos + 1 RoP. I buy a stout as soon as I can in lane. After that, if my lane is going ok and I can get kills, I may buy an OoV. Beyond that, it's just normal troll items. Once Troll has QB + Phase + Aquila he has a level of strength comparable to last patch. He doesn't play well from behind, so take care in the laning phase. If you can get to that point safely you can still do Troll things and mess people up. It helps if you think of him like void in some ways during the laning phase - just try to fish for a lucky bash here and there.  One thing I'll say is your BKB timing is important with the hero. What I mean by this isn't that you should buy it early, but you should try to read the game to buy it when your team is going to need to group up and fight. Troll needs lifesteal + BKB to operate effectively in a fight. Troll is a hero that rewards you heavily for delaying your BKB as long as possible, but not a moment more."
TrueDoTA2,3cmk7b,amttc,2,Thu Jul 9 12:37:01 2015 UTC,"If you're going to sneak rosh early, you probably need HotD with an Ice Ogre giving you armor. I don't think any other creep enables you to tank Rosh well enough to not die.   Any tanky large creep should allow you to successfully Rosh, but you will have to micro them so you start out tanking, then when you get low you rotate them in so you can lifesteal up, then when they get low you rotate back in.  Why do you choose to max Q over E? Doesn't E let you get more damage and farm quicker?  I think your other points are all solid and worth considering, nice write-up."
TrueDoTA2,3cmk7b,Ailodierap,2,Thu Jul 9 13:58:28 2015 UTC,I think Berserker's Rage provides more utility - the movespeed is really helpful when moving between camps. I think Troll is pretty good with just Phase + Aquila + QB + Morbid Mask on farm speed. If you want to go full on farm mode you can leave Axes at the first level and max Rage and Fervor. E is a better skill for raw DPS and pushing power.
TrueDoTA2,3cmk7b,amttc,2,Thu Jul 9 14:38:12 2015 UTC,"Fair enough; I personally prefer maxing DPS potential, but I can understand why the utility would be advantageous (especially for situations like kiting). I hadn't considered that more move speed = faster farming."

TrueDoTA2,3cmk7b,DangerAwar,1 point,Thu Jul 9 10:36:15 2015 UTC,"Old Troll, in addition to being un-manfightable and good at soloing Rosh, had a ranged form on top of high movement speed, an AoE blind and a slow that gave flying vision, low mana costs, mass global IAS for his team on a low cd, etc. Despite current Troll not being the overly-favorable pick he once was, the old one brought a ton to the table that current Ursa doesn't so it's not too farfetched for Ursa not to be a top comp pick even though old Troll was. Ursa's not ranged nor does he buff his team globally nor have any CC aside from his slow. I can see old Troll being called a ""better Ursa"" but not current Ursa being a better current Troll since you'd be picking them for different reasons now/they offer different things to your draft... or at least that's my perception.  Whether or not Troll now doesn't bring enough is I suppose debatable, but I don't think he was over-nerfed so much as the straightening out of his power-curve has coincided with a much greater emphasis on the early and mid game as opposed to the late. Thus Troll is more of niche pick now instead of a right-click carry you could throw into just about any line-up due to his strength during every game phase and have it be fine. Ursa is also a niche pick with the distinction that his skillset seems awfully well-suited to stomping pubs, which opens up that niche a lot in less coordinated games."

TrueDoTA2,3cmk7b,morgasamatortime,3,Thu Jul 9 07:16:28 2015 UTC,Yeah I think the same too. The only thing is the meta that does not put emphasis on farming. A good troll is still good in this patch; patch just cut down the lazy ez win players.

When the support or carry's gone they are an easy snack. Hide in Jungle, let them push, get another support on your lane, gank the shit out of him once or twice, get the tower and from then on rotate. Works for me everytime. If you can, skip BKB and get Skadi directly.   Sometimes I'd like to Troll around and get Diffusal Blades on him. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Whatever floats your boat."

Troll was a lot better before because the game was more carry heavy and his ult stacked well with dps right clicker carries. This meta is favoring casters a lot more, and with multiple nerfs to troll, troll is just not viable in high level play anymore.   I actually got +300 MMR just playing troll before the patch though, he was so retardedly OP lol. I remember winning 1v3 no problem. There are a couple heroes I'm finding to be pretty dang OP now as well though so my MMR climb continues :D"
TrueDoTA2,3cmk7b,Dat_Speed,2,Thu Jul 9 19:59:04 2015 UTC,"there's no reason he even had vision on those axes in the first place. flying vision is so rare in the game, and hard to get, that it's mind-boggling how troll warlord, a great carry, has two of the lowest-cooldown ways to get huge flying vision. not to mention you can't juke him like every other carry."
TrueDoTA2,3cmk7b,srslybr0,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:13:31 2015 UTC,"He's a mid-tier position 1. He's no longer a viable mid, more because of the meta, less because of his nerfs."
TrueDoTA2,3cof9b,Dettelbacher,4,Thu Jul 9 14:12:40 2015 UTC,I played a game where I was LC offlane and Tiny played the 1 role.  I failed to snowball and fell back to utility role.  I cast press the attack on Tiny every team fight and the 300 health regen and 120 attack speed plus dispel made Tiny a hard hitting monster.  So LC could be added to your potential Tiny partners.  She is also pretty flexible with laning.
TrueDoTA2,3cof9b,calky,4,Thu Jul 9 15:57:20 2015 UTC,What sort of damage is Tiny doing per swing with Sven buff and Empower?
TrueDoTA2,3cof9b,mrpeach32,2,Thu Jul 9 14:47:23 2015 UTC,"Let's say you have a tiny with level 20 - the base damage will be ~280.    Empower is +50%  Sven ult is +100% at level 16.   You should probably add 15% from vlads too.   With those buffs based on Tiny's base damage you would be at +462 damage (740ish total)   With Venge in there,  +554 (830ish, total).   At level 25 it would be closer to +500 and +600, around 800/900 damage total per swing I think."
TrueDoTA2,3cof9b,Drop_,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:12:40 2015 UTC,Which is why with that damage attack speed is king. Uneaten moonshard is definitely needed.
TrueDoTA2,3cof9b,Gaston44,4,Fri Jul 10 21:16:42 2015 UTC,"You probably don't need to go all-in on the buff tiny strat.  All three of your cores are melee, which can be a huge problem in teamfights.  Mag/Tiny/Venge is probably enough, then you can put the mag offlane and something ranged mid."
TrueDoTA2,3cof9b,UNBR34K4BL3,4,Thu Jul 9 15:20:12 2015 UTC,Sven is a really bad offlaner though.
TrueDoTA2,3cof9b,docmartens,3,Thu Jul 9 18:19:26 2015 UTC,"I feel this would be stronger if the lanes weren't strangely mixed up. Sven is not a very competent offlaner, while Magnus can offlane very well. You should send Magnus offlane and either Sven mid or Tiny mid with safelane Sven."
TrueDoTA2,3cof9b,thundrfang,2,Thu Jul 9 17:28:21 2015 UTC,Why is this exclusive to Tiny? This just seems like a normal draft with your standard position 1 carry. And Tiny is not really suited to fill those roles.
TrueDoTA2,3cof9b,Gaston44,2,Thu Jul 9 14:24:17 2015 UTC,"I just saw in the OP that the strategy involves using Magnus' Empower. This is actually pretty interesting then, since the cleaves stack. I would build an uneaten Moonshard or an AC on the Tiny to maximize ratting."
TrueDoTA2,3cof9b,Gaston44,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:26:49 2015 UTC,"Instead of AC, a mjolnir would also be good. It gives you more attack speed, chain lightning for extra pushing and farming and it gives you even more damage(although not very much)"
TrueDoTA2,3cof9b,Snoop_doge1,2,Thu Jul 9 14:32:26 2015 UTC,You don't really need chain lightning because you will one shot creep waves and jungle camps anyways.
TrueDoTA2,3cof9b,Gaston44,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:49:51 2015 UTC,Thats true. I do think 80 attack speed is very good though.
TrueDoTA2,3cof9b,Snoop_doge1,3,Thu Jul 9 17:10:17 2015 UTC,Moon Shards are more cost effective on tiny TBH.  It's the most cost effective item for damage output tiny can pick up.    4300 gold for 120 attack speed is WAY more cost efficient for damage than 5700 for 80 attack speed and 24 damage (or even way more than AC with 55 aspeed and -5 armor at 5250 gold).   Tiny scales extremely well with attack speed.  Moon Shards are a legit pickup after scepter on tiny.
TrueDoTA2,3cof9b,Drop_,2,Thu Jul 9 17:38:38 2015 UTC,"Neat idea, but I think you should focus more on ranged heroes who can buff him.  Having Sven + Tiny + Magnus is super high risk with all of your cores being melee, and adding Ogre in there for the AS buff , and relying on something like Omni would be the same.  All melee teams can work but I think you would be better off trying to make it work with some ranged heroes in there other than just venge.    Post scepter tiny should probably go for Moon Shards if he wants to do more damage.  No single item will give you more damage for the amount of gold that item costs on tiny."
TrueDoTA2,3cof9b,Drop_,2,Thu Jul 9 17:50:40 2015 UTC,You Have way too many melee cores and are probably going to lose more lanes than you want. 3 melee cores dude. All have mana issues too.  Balance damage and attack speed too. Troll+tiny is something I regularly like to draft.
TrueDoTA2,3cof9b,wildtarget13,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:15:50 2015 UTC,"That is probably more cleave and +damage than neccesary. At a certain point ASP will help your dps more than the +damage buffs. Try swapping one of the heroes with either voker (for alacricity) or beastmaster (for his passive).  I'd swap the sven out because, like you said, at the point he gets blink, vlads, aghs the game is probably already done. Voker and BM can have an immediate effect that is not item dependent. Either one would also be a stronger offlane."
TrueDoTA2,3cof9b,kroxldyphivian,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:23:48 2015 UTC,"That lineup is not bad, but it is easy to shutdown with stronger lane heroes like WR/Lesh/viper/lich. Tiny+wisp is still very strong but alone tiny does make as big as impact as other heroes. I find that if tiny gets behind by even a small amount he becomes very weak and essentially useless, so I tend to not pick him lately. If you can find a way to consistently get an early lead (like wisp+tiny) I think he is still strong, but there are like no wisp players at the 4.5k bracket."
TrueDoTA2,3cof9b,Dat_Speed,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:58:43 2015 UTC,I think LC or Troll are the best buffs for tiny. Probably not both because 3 melee cores is inviting aoe death. But both of them have easily spammable attack speed steroids.
TrueDoTA2,3con5e,thurrs,15,Thu Jul 9 15:13:09 2015 UTC,"I actually do not go bottle    ...   I go to fountain pretty often   you should go bottle when you are mid.  the hp regen keeps you from going back to fountain, which lets you stay ahead on exp.  It also lets you use your TPs to gank the side lanes, rather than go back to mid.  It's easier to stay off the map by TPing to gank rather than walk through the river in most cases."
TrueDoTA2,3con5e,UNBR34K4BL3,10,Thu Jul 9 15:25:24 2015 UTC,"He buys three nulls, fakes picking Invoker mid, doesn't buy bottle, and thinks Skywrath is one of the best mids right now. Correct me if I'm wrong but this sounds pretty trolly.  Ninja edit: ""I see bottle as seven tp scrolls."" What."
TrueDoTA2,3con5e,yeartwo,4,Thu Jul 9 16:37:02 2015 UTC,"This guy isn't an idiot or a troll, this is just a classic case of everyone dog-piling on someone they think is wrong because they have a completely different opinion.  He's saying that he thinks the momentum from 7 TP scrolls used to gank (I assume during the first 15 minutes) is more valuable to the team than a Bottle. While I disagree, perhaps the rest of you can separate the discussion of his Skywrath build from the topic itself, since Skywrath mid is pretty viable IMO while this build I'm a little less certain about."
TrueDoTA2,3con5e,freelance_fox,-2,Fri Jul 10 14:15:35 2015 UTC,"Thing with Sky is that he has to have 75% mana to pull off a gank, and I find that bottle usually doesn't put me there. It can help me sustain and farm lane and harass nonstop, but typically for me, 1 gank costs 1 fountain trip. Does this make sense?"
TrueDoTA2,3con5e,wildtarget13,3,Thu Jul 9 15:37:13 2015 UTC,"It doesn'take sense to skip bottle. Bottle is a bigger mana pool. 210 and health too.   Watch Merlini play sky mid for more inspiration.   It also makes your fountain trips shorter.  It's not about staying on the map refilling with bottle, it's about getting as much of an Hp and MP pool during your time on the map. Dump all your mana and go home.  It's also one of the few ways to get efficient HP to stay topped off in lane."

With your SWM and the 57 int just from Talis and Atod, you'd benefit in the long run for getting a few smalls items for mana regeneration. The fastest way to get 150% is with Eul's, which is sorta good for some games, but I'd suggest getting a blank void stone with one slot left for TP.  There's usually always a better option that going back to base, unless you're Tinker."
TrueDoTA2,3con5e,Ishmael_KingOfTheSea,5,Thu Jul 9 16:38:36 2015 UTC,"I used to do it before support skywrath became the popular way to play him.  He isn't bad mid, but any competent team can utterly trash him if someone like Bounty Hunter comes to gank. You have 0 armor for a solid 20 minutes as Skywrath.   It only takes one rotation to kill you, which is why you rarely see a Skywrath mid anymore, especially at higher levels of play."
TrueDoTA2,3con5e,CNHphoto,2,Thu Jul 9 15:40:30 2015 UTC,The issue with Sky mid is that he usually doesn't scale too well to allocate him that much farm.
TrueDoTA2,3con5e,Ishmael_KingOfTheSea,3,Thu Jul 9 15:53:29 2015 UTC,His Q becomes terrifying with enough int items. You can effectively be casting a 400 damage nuke every three seconds late game.
TrueDoTA2,3con5e,Lazarous86,3,Thu Jul 9 17:08:06 2015 UTC,Every 2 seconds! Q scales all game.
TrueDoTA2,3con5e,Ishmael_KingOfTheSea,2,Thu Jul 9 17:20:37 2015 UTC,That can't be disjointed is probably the best part. But really sky is a situational pick.
TrueDoTA2,3con5e,banyt,2,Thu Jul 9 19:09:28 2015 UTC,"Oh ya, he isn't my go-to late game carry pick, it's just that he does scale well with items and levels which is a reason to let him go mid. It's just that he is too much of a glass canon to really warrant it."
TrueDoTA2,3con5e,CNHphoto,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:16:54 2015 UTC,it's not that he doesn't scale well  6-slotted he is terrifying because of bolt  the problem is getting there; it's too easy to break his momentum
TrueDoTA2,3con5e,banyt,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:08:24 2015 UTC,"Arcane Bolt on a farmed Skywrath could do about 420 magic damage every 2 seconds (assuming 190 total intelligence).

TrueDoTA2,3con5e,forkkind,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:47:27 2015 UTC,That's beside that point. Other heroes scale more than Skywrath Mage.
TrueDoTA2,3con5e,freelance_fox,2,Fri Jul 10 16:34:04 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure w33ha has vods of him spamming sky wrath to 8k and he carried quite hard with it, check it out sometime forget what he does but this is even vs bh bs and leshrac and honestly your build is really inefficient and should only be done on a roaming sky wrath and even then one will get a bottle. As a mid if you spend so much on nulls and your opponents are good enough to gank you (which they do in higher mmr) you'll fall behind insanely and that's horrible for a mid laner."
TrueDoTA2,3con5e,Juracule,2,Thu Jul 9 20:01:29 2015 UTC,"I've run Sky mid once and played against it 3 times or so in 6.84. I think it's quite strong, and yes, Atos is fantastic on him. I have a pocket skywrath build that I've been using since 6.82 or so though which is a movespeed build on Skywrath: Bottle (rush, rtz build w/ 2 gg branches) -> Phase Boots -> Eul's -> Blink -> Eblade. Optionally get Drums too. Phase boots solve all your last hitting needs and make you insanely hard to catch/lane against. Blink on top of your insane movespeed means solo kills with Concussive from fog -> Blink -> Silence -> Q/R combos. Eblade as a core item makes Skywrath able to solo kill even scary melee cores during late game. He just scales so scarily well, on par with Lina for sure.   Now, the few games I went against Skywrath mid this patch I didn't feel like he was that impactful. Some hero match-ups he can dominate, but even in those games he has to apply constant pressure throughout the 15:00-30:00 minute time period to justify giving him that farm. The one game where VP ran Illidan solo mid Skywrath in 6.84, they won with a Bloodseeker combo pick for G in the safelane. Quite a nasty strat when Rupture and Mystic Flare go on the same hero and Bloodseeker starts wailing on you.   So I guess I would conclude that Skywrath mid is viable. Watch out for combo picks like Clockwerk, Bloodseeker, Legion Commander, etc in the draft that might give it away and ban him if your mid isn't Leshrac or Puck (any other good counters?). He's not as useful as a support these days with no Panda or Tide to hard counter, but picking a Skywrath-counter like Nyx Assassin in response to a Skywrath pick is probably a good idea. Nyx is the best laner against him probably due to the insanely high Mana Burns and reflecting Arcane Bolts with Spiked Carapace."
TrueDoTA2,3con5e,cvuk,4,Thu Jul 9 23:45:40 2015 UTC,"He is immobile, doesn't farm fast, and gets completely neutered by glimmer cape. He feels like an inferior leshrac"

TrueDoTA2,3con5e,Juracule,1 point,Fri Jul 10 04:49:35 2015 UTC,"Leshrac has to land his stun to achieve any lockdown though (whereas Skywrath's is reliable from Seal), and can't kill single targets nearly as quickly or efficiently. The comparison is apt enough since Leshrac is in the meta and can fulfill the same role, but I think the closest/best comparison is to mid Lina.  Theoretically a Lesh versus Skywrath mid matchup would be very even, too. They have similar damage, movespeed, starting stats and level one nuke spam/harass."
TrueDoTA2,3con5e,freelance_fox,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:04:16 2015 UTC,"How does leshrac have no CC lmao. What do you call his stun and lightning?  Lesh can far more consistenly kill a target, because his stun is easier to land with the help of lightning, as opposed to swm's ult, the source of all SWM's damage, and something that can be walked out of. Before lvl 6 a leshrac has far more kill potential due to a slow on his lightning and his stun, while swm's slow is not tied to his harass. After lvl 6, a skywrath is still far more limited by his cooldown, and only offering single-target damage."
TrueDoTA2,3con5e,Lazarous86,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:33:21 2015 UTC,"Lmao that was quite a brain fart by me, apologies while I fix my post. I was ignoring the slow on Lightning intentionally but forgot about Q stun completely, which of course still isn't reliable. Now my post is more about the reliable nature of Skywrath's lockdown (Ancient Seal) versus Leshrac's unreliable/aoe focus."
TrueDoTA2,3con5e,afpras,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:13:47 2015 UTC,"It is interesting. If you can force them back before the other mid can secure their bottle you have basically won the lane before level 3. It is also a good hero for rotation ganks because the silence+slow is extremely strong against he popular QoP and Lesh. But you are also extremely weak against those heroes too with a low health pool. The Null stacking could help that potentially. Obviously once you have the atos health isn't as big of an issue. Really, if you can execute sky effectively you can kill a hero before anyone can do anything about it."
TrueDoTA2,3cka0w,lonerwithboner,37,Wed Jul 8 15:55:55 2015 UTC,"In this case, if I had to guess what's in his head... the first two trees widen the lane making it easier to see and side-step any arrows thrown by the offlane Mirana. The third tree opens up a juke spot.    In general, it's not a bad idea to chop down some trees with quelling blade to: * Create juke spots the enemy wouldn't expect * Open up the field of vision * Make pulling/stacking creeps easier (ex. the pull through from easy to medium camp on radiant) * Choke point jungling    Also consider this: both you and your enemy are intimately familiar with the default layout of the map. Cutting trees ahead of time has now altered the terrain in a way that only you know and your enemy does not, creating a tactical advantage."
TrueDoTA2,3cka0w,Ghost0_,24,Wed Jul 8 17:05:49 2015 UTC,"He is creating juke spots I think. Cutting those trees means he can hide in unexpected  places. In the case of the last tree cut, it would allow him to get back to his tower safer by running directly instead of going around the trees."
TrueDoTA2,3cka0w,NappySlapper,7,Wed Jul 8 16:26:52 2015 UTC,"The second one was definitely him creating an extra escape route / juke spot, and the first two I'd guess are him just attempting to keep the lane as wide as possible. He's just playing to farm and secure farm rather than attempt kills, so he wants as much room to move as possible. Disclaimer: I might have no idea what I'm talking about."

TrueDoTA2,3cka0w,JeVaFIN,2,Wed Jul 8 16:30:11 2015 UTC,First 2 trees cut down remove a hiding spot for the opposing side.   Last tree cut down has already been answered -- gives him a clear path.

TrueDoTA2,3cka0w,Lj101,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:24:11 2015 UTC,"Beyond creating juke spots, when you are just farming, especially safelane, it's really useful to cut trees to open up vision of people coming to gank you. If you are active with your QB you can open up the area around where you are static farming a lot. Combine this with a lane ward and you can go full panopticon.   You may also randomly cut trees are to open up quicker paths between camps when farming jungle. This is even good when you are farming on heroes with a blink or jump (like AM/slark respectively).  The other reason to randomly cut trees is to get vision of TP spots when you are pushing towers. When all the trees are present there are places where people can TP to the tower without you knowing, making the push a lot less safe. If you make a point of knocking down a few key trees with your QB (or any other skill really) then you can be more aggressive/confident. This is particularly true around radiant safe and mid t1, radiant safe t2, and dire mid and off t1."

He seems so much worse than a sven mid (sven mid is slightly dubious, but could work)  When i play WK, i like to go MoM/phase/wand/Blink/BkB.

TrueDoTA2,3ckzv6,Dat_Speed,4,Thu Jul 9 05:50:15 2015 UTC,"Yes WK is a decent mid. He is not typically played as mid because he does not need levels as badly as other heroes like lina/qop/lesh/wr. He is more gold/item dependent. I would go WK mid if my teammates were pretty bad or trying to go NA mid. WK is my favorite pick vs blood seeker because the 40% amp dmg stacks with a WK bmail/mjoll build and makes WK basically invulnerable to bs until he gets BKB, which usually takes a long time.  Back in the good old days of dota 1 I would go armlet and blink and just dominate the other team. Now I only pick him vs bs because WK is pretty slow and does not farm as fast as other carries and has less ganking power than like PA."
TrueDoTA2,3ckzv6,Drop_,6,Wed Jul 8 20:08:00 2015 UTC,"He definitely needs level 16 though...   Blink armlet treads is also pretty strong still with WK. His winrate is still absurdly high this patch.  You definitely don't want to play him as a farming carry, though.  Start fighting at level 11 once you have blink / armlet / treads."
TrueDoTA2,3ckzv6,yeartwo,3,Wed Jul 8 20:44:58 2015 UTC,"I think any hero (more or less) can be a ""decent"" mid, but WK is going to have an okay time in lane at best, and there are better options for mid heroes.  It just makes me sad to see people being like ""Oh sure WK/Spectre/Whoever can go mid,"" because of the opportunity cost of not having a different mid hero who can change the game up at level 6, like QoP or Storm Spirit, or even Bloodseeker.  Anything can work, but that doesn't mean it will.  Edit: OP just said in another comment that he's played three games total, so what I said goes double. WK mid is pretty unorthodox, especially in this meta."
TrueDoTA2,3ckzv6,lebastss,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:34:17 2015 UTC,"I only pick up WK in pubs now. He is fun to snowball, hardest snowball to stop IMO. You get big enough and your hard enough to kill, let alone twice."
TrueDoTA2,3ckzv6,Conpen,6,Wed Jul 8 20:19:13 2015 UTC,My highest hero damage record was set in a match where I kept trying to kill a snowballing WK. Didn't work.

TrueDoTA2,3ckzv6,MattieShoes,5,Wed Jul 8 20:23:37 2015 UTC,"As in he can farm less neuts/sec than a blinking, high move speed AM with bfury."

TrueDoTA2,3ckzv6,forkkind,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:34:23 2015 UTC,"Most farm dependent cores have some way of speeding up farm by killing waves fast and then farming jungle creeps... Luna has bouncing glaives, Sven has his cleave, Gyrocopter has flak cannon, Shadow Fiend has razes, Troll has whirling axes and attack speed, Medusa has split shot, Juggernaut has attack speed and sometimes goes Battlefury, Antimage has blink and attack speed and sometimes goes battlefury, Naga has illusions and utilizes radiance, Terrorblade has illusions, PL has illusions, Storm Spirit has AOE, Templar Assassin has Psi Blades, Tinker has March of the Machines,  QoP has AOE, Lina has AOE, Ember Spirit has AOE and tends to go battlefury, Zeus and Death Prophet spam multi-target spells, Necrophos has AOE...  Other carries tend to struggle with farm.  Wraith King has good sustain with the lifesteal, but doesn't kill things fast enough to keep up.  Ditto for Lifestealer.  Phantom Assassin too, unless she buys Battlefury.  Windrunner and Sniper either need kills or a farming item.  Riki's farm is pretty lackluster especially in the jungle.  So when you pick those sorts of heroes, you're kind of banking on getting enough kills to stay in control of the game, or else you're forced to pick a farming item like Battlefury, Radiance, Maelstrom, or Hand of Midas.  Those items are good but they don't tend to increase your survivability that much in fights, so it can be rough.  In Wraith King's case, hand of midas and maelstrom/mjollnir would be the typical farm accelerators."
TrueDoTA2,3ckzv6,Drop_,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:39:12 2015 UTC,"he has no built in aoe damage and his single target damage/speed doesn't compare to Lycan or troll warlord. Usually you see carry Wraith Kings pick up maelstrom, midas or radiance so they can farm better (among other things; maelstrom > mjolnir gives a lot of attack speed, midas gets him to level 16 really fast and radiance turns him into a quasi spectre but with way better control and right click damage)"
TrueDoTA2,3ckzv6,ThrowawayXTREME,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:29:08 2015 UTC,"Never pick and risky gamble. BS can go to any lane and it's hard to predict. There's a reason why ember and melee heroes in general find it difficult to lane mid since crap like Lesh, sf, QoP and storm are so strong in most stages of the game they can be played in every lane and they can bully a lane really really hard. WK is a great carry pick vs BS though and it's especially funny if you do the hailrake wk build to make sure he never ever wants to rupture you."
TrueDoTA2,3ckzv6,docmartens,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:43:47 2015 UTC,Also a solid support against BS.  Just pick up that Blademail and blink as your core.

TrueDoTA2,3ckzv6,Drop_,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:49:49 2015 UTC,"It would only be good because the other team isn't going to counter pick it for laning phase.  You're still very slow, so if they just have a general ganking line up, you're fucked.  If WK mid became flavor of the month, you would get countered by mana burning heroes and heroes with good disjoints, since wraithfire blast has a huge telegraph.  He's a one button wonder though, so if you're just learning the game, it's better to take off the training wheels ASAP.  I started learning dota with earthshaker."
TrueDoTA2,3ckzv6,Juracule,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:11:56 2015 UTC,"I like him OK mid. His ult is sick for early fights and dives, but has an awful cooldown. If you can, rotating him offlane after 6/7 is ideal so you can potentially put some serious pressure on the other carry. I usually get the standard items and go just Q and stats until 7 or 8 (+ult at 6 ofc). Not the best hero in the current meta, but if you need a tank, I think he's one of the better ones currently."
TrueDoTA2,3ckzv6,Thefelix01,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:57:36 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't play him mid in general.  He will get wrecked by QoP, Lesh, and probably SF.    I would probably only pick him if the enemy team went with a fairly weak melee mid, but those have really fallen out of favor.    Maybe against a ranged mid like pugna?  Not sure.  He is a good hero but 1) he is easy to counterpick with PL so don't pick him early and 2) don't pick him for mid unless you have some reason to believe you will win it (sometimes something like a dual mid might work)."
TrueDoTA2,3ckzv6,Mercynary5,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:15:38 2015 UTC,"No.  You will get shitstomped by SF, Leshrac, QoP, etc."
TrueDoTA2,3ckzv6,mutantmagnet,1 point,Thu Jul 9 09:31:47 2015 UTC,"WK is a flexible hero but there's little point in putting him mid. Maybe for a quick blink and good ganks, or armlet and early deathballing but he can only go up against weak mids and isn't hard to gank in early levels"
TrueDoTA2,3ckzv6,eeyunn,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:58:35 2015 UTC,"Armlet is pretty damn good item because its give strength heroes powerful damage and good attack speed. Even if its lowering health, wraith king wont care at all and its the best item for him. I also usually buy shadow blade because its one of the item that gives him attack speed and a escape path. Get a skull basher or MKB if they have evasion heroes and then get more attack speed from assault cuirass. BLink dagger is an ok item but Shadow blade is way better for some reasons, more damage and attack speed. More items can be purchase like Heart of tarresque and Divine rapier or even heavean halberd for a great health, evasion and an active of disarm."
TrueDoTA2,3ckrr6,TheMoeBlob,3,Wed Jul 8 18:00:21 2015 UTC,"It is partly human nature but it is also partly the anonymity of the internet. If you play organized team sports or even unorganized team sports you'll know that it is quite rare to run into people in real life with as toxic or negative behavior as you find in online gaming. Of course the age of the playerbase is also a factor in regards to maturity.  But in many team activities such as DotA, there is an opportunity to work on your leadership skills. Leaders know the sum of the parts is greater than the whole, and leaders know how to galvanize their team. I almost always play supports, not only because that is very often what the team needs but also because I enjoy the more strategic aspects of the game. Simply being positive and communicating to your team can have a drastic effect on your chances of winning."
TrueDoTA2,3ckrr6,Skyro620,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:24:51 2015 UTC,I also love the strategic side to the game and find that I know understand my mmr bracket pretty well but I am fed up playing supports because it doesn't matter if you say that there is someone farming somewhere because people don't listen.   After the laning phase my impact as a player drops hugely because I tend to end up solo supporting and end up under leveled and umder farmed. Its quite common for me to get a 30 minute blink on es for example
TrueDoTA2,3ckrr6,Skyro620,2,Wed Jul 8 22:49:28 2015 UTC,"An interesting phenomenon in group activities is social pressure. So for instance while you might have the bad apple or two on your team, if you are a good leader and can get the majority of your team on your side to listen and work together, the bad apple faces significant pressure to comply. He'll realize the best chance to win is to work with the majority.  The worst case is total anarchy where everybody is directionless and thus defaults to fending for themselves. Often times, simply being jovial during the draft phase and saying something like ""I'm going to support, who wants to support with me! We can roam together!"" can do wonders to build early repoire and significantly increase the chance to get a second support on your team (people are less against supporting if they will have another support on the team).  Also I dislike the overgeneralization of the impact of supports. There are many different ways to support, what works best in what situations is too much to get into in one post, but for example ES is not a very good solo support. Solo support typically means you team is going to be playing a passive laning phase (unless the opposing team also is running solo support), so playing ES, who is an aggressive roaming support, would not be very optimal."
TrueDoTA2,3ckrr6,the_phet,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:24:17 2015 UTC,"I'd say that the main reason is that you play with random strangers, while in sports you play with friends. Yes, some people in Dota2 plays with friends and they blame them, but those are dickheads without principles.  I've lost games because some of my team mates sucked (yesterday I lost a game where in my team a centaur was 0/7/3, a DK was 0/9/1 and a sven was 1/9/0. I was mid with medusa farming and they were losing their lanes badly. But I have also won games were I sucked and someone carried me. For example 2 days I had a game with Clinkz where I had no impact with 3/4/5 and I was carried hard by a PL 20/5/5 and a Riki 12/2/9.  So at the end of the day everything evens out. The only constant in each game is you."
TrueDoTA2,3ckrr6,goblinbiddin,5,Thu Jul 9 13:59:11 2015 UTC,"Hm... have a read of this. Also I really advise against flaming anyone during a game that can be won, and I also advise against listening to people who are flaming. You should be looking to your own play and how to improve it during and between games no matter what some raging idiot says.  This doesn't mean that raging idiots are always wrong (they are wrong a lot.) It does mean that it's not worth your energy to consider what ragers are saying, and you should be going through your normal peri and post game progressions to decide what to do and how to improve your own play."

First off, these people may not be interested in improving, and haven't asked to be criticised by you, so your suggestions will often come off as passive aggression. Secondly, you are probably the same MMR as they, so they have no reason to believe you are a greater authority on the subject than they are.   I only do it when I really want to win a game and someone is doing something I perceive as obviously not conductive to winning. I feel like coming off as someone who really wants to win a game, rallying the team around a certain strategy etc. (like a milder version of EE), is more productive than pointing out the mistakes of others ""for their own sake""."

TrueDoTA2,3ckrr6,Hurm4,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:21:36 2015 UTC,"1) Be fast with the mute button. The mute button is one of the best parts of dota 2. If I get the slightest vibe of a toxic, tilted, losing player talking trash to me I instantly mute them and say ""muted"". And I never unmute a muted player. Sometimes I will tolerate a little trash talk if the person has something productive to say.   I think the blame culture really originated in dota 1 due to a strong sense of pride everyone had because their group of friends ""could pubstomp any pubs"". It is really a mechanism of inclusion vs exclusion. If someone was playing poorly you would blame them and ostracize them because you didn't want to have a weak pub stomping crew (very embarrassing). These days dota 2 is a completely different game because most people get the basics and there are standards of acceptable play. Before it was ""why can u not stop feeding"" more than ""why are u not following the standard arteezy build??"".   I think to end the blame culture valve needs to increase the punishment for reporting. There should be an option to send in a screenshot of verbal abuse followed up by a 4, 24, and 72 hour progressive ban. I don't mind if you are expressing a bit of frustration, but when you target me saying ""it is 100% your fault we lost and you are a fucking retard"" there should be a ban for that..."
TrueDoTA2,3ckrr6,pucklermuskau,-7,Wed Jul 8 20:27:48 2015 UTC,"This post really bothers me. You started a list, and ended at 1, thats unforgivable. Then you go on to tell us how you mute someone, then tell them they are muted, which is almost equally inflammatory as whatever the muted person was saying. In any case, the mute button should be a last resort course of action in a game that is highly dependent on verbal communication. You also mention that something from DOTA 2 originated in DOTA 1 - YOU DON'T SAY?! A truly groundbreaking find. But really, the difference between DOTA2 and DOTA1 is the effect of the competitive scene on the actual meta game play - it's the exact same game with more structure.   it is 100% your fault we lost and you are a fucking retard   Your report reforms are wack, dude. And who is to say that the above quote may not be true?"
TrueDoTA2,3ckrr6,Hurm4,-2,Wed Jul 8 21:02:43 2015 UTC,what? its just common courtesy to tell people when you mute them.

TrueDoTA2,3ckrr6,Hurm4,-1,Wed Jul 8 22:05:59 2015 UTC,"its simple courtesy to tell people when you choose to mute them, what purpose does it serve to mute without letting them know first? its hardly 'inflammatory', its clear communication."
TrueDoTA2,3ckrr6,pucklermuskau,-5,Wed Jul 8 22:35:52 2015 UTC,"I understood what you meant, but starting a sentence with ""what?"" is silly.

TrueDoTA2,3ckrr6,Dat_Speed,-4,Wed Jul 8 23:30:02 2015 UTC,"why dont you worry about your own writing style, instead of offering needless 'criticism'   Writing is communication, so it's quite relevant. Your ""what?"" was far more needless than my criticism. Maybe you just write like you talk but how is anyone supposed to know what you are ""what?""-ing? You're essentially inviting criticism when you seemingly dismiss and reduce another's post to ""what?"". Did you not understand? Are you being a dick? Are you shocked by something I said?   its about ensuring communication between your team   So telling someone they are muted is ensuring communication between your team? That seems a bit contradictory. If anything, you are limiting the communication by completely removing one person from your team. Even if you can still see his pings.   you cant influence how others behave, but letting people know that their communication channel isnt operating is basic courtesy   I disagree, you can ABSOLUTELY influence how people behave, because you can approach them positively and that tends to offer returned positive energy from the team. It works the same way with negativity.  I'm not sure you understand the purpose of the mute function in DOTA2. Consider why you are doing it in the first place - to not hear a particular teammates' sounds. Telling them they are muted, is essentially adding fuel to whatever fire caused the mute, regardless if you can hear or not. I've seen it over the course of years of playing DOTA. You are not doing them a favor by telling them they are muted. Whether or not you realize or intend it, your idea of 'common courtesy' in this case is just you trying to squeeze the last word in edgewise."

TrueDoTA2,3ckrr6,banyt,-1,Thu Jul 9 00:21:59 2015 UTC,"Because the reality of Dota is that it is a 5 man game and despite what /r/dota2 3k shitlords tell you, you cannot carry every game. You are depending on your teammates to not fuck up moreso than them to make big plays and when things go wrong, the tendency is to shed responsibility and thus blaming.  I think the skill gap is massively, massively overstated in Dota, especially comparing skill of ""pro"" players and high tier pub players. It's been seen time and time and time again that pro players mechanically are no better than a 5k player. The only real difference comes down to decision making and ability to be a teamplayer. And this is why I do not agree with the attitude of ""just see what you could have done better"" because every single person in every single game could have done stuff better, but that doesn't mean they would win the game.  That is why I don't think you can take it personally. Even if you don't do well, the problem is systemic throughout the team rather than just you and people are venting their frustration on things they cannot control."

Dota2 mechanics are way harder than LoL (although LoL players things they are all skill because the game is all about skill shoots) and in the very high end (Arteezy and company) the game is as intensive as it is SC.  In Dota2, compared to LoL, remember there are denies. Creep control is also more intensive and complicated. I recommend you watch Arteezy on Twitch some game he goes mid. The quantity of actions and their precission is astonishing. Not only he needs to LH and deny, he has the bottle and needs to control it, he needs to control the runes, he needs to harrass the enemy but at the same time stay safe. He needs to control other lanes in case he needs to TP. He needs to control the creep wave, and this is not only about ""I hit my creeps once for every LH"", because he also controls the aggro. its important how he positions himself when calls for aggro, and how he controls how creeps move around the wave. He also needs to block the incoming waves. He is also stacking creeps whenever he can. He usually plays naga, which multiplies all this by x4. He almost always goes for blink, which is extremely important when calculating jumps. Also knowing the exact range of every item and spell so you dont need to walk to cast it. The way he farms the jungle, the path, the way he hits the creeps to minimize number of right clicks.  There's a level when you already know ""all"" when the difference is based on the skill."
TrueDoTA2,3ckrr6,genetalgiant,0,Thu Jul 9 16:14:51 2015 UTC,At no level of dota 2 does the mechanical skill reach high level starcraft demands.

You list out 20 things he has to do but he can only do like 3 at a time. cause he only has one guy and he has to be in one place.
TrueDoTA2,3ckrr6,twersx,-2,Mon Jul 13 20:07:10 2015 UTC,"I think you got my message a little mixed up. First of all, I don't play LoL at all, so in no way am I carrying the Riot flag claiming it is a superior game. And I also agree that the game Dota has more mechanics and is a much deeper game, however, when it comes to mechanical skill of individual players, Dota pales in comparison to LoL.  HoN was also much more mechanically demanding because it played like Dota on meth. You had to be alot quicker with things in HoN because things happened so fast and Dota was alot more sluggish in comparison. It is kind of the same thing in LoL, with all their skillshots and emphasis on character movement, getting timings down to the very second, etc. In alot of ways the static nature of LoL makes for some really amazing grand strategy executed by individual mechanical skill.  Also, even though Dota has creep denying and couriers and that stuff, the same principles apply to LoL. They maintain creep equilibrium without the ability to attack their own creeps, which is quite an impressive feat already without taking into account that they also need to TP back to get their items and get back to minimize creeps lost all whilst avoiding being hit. At low levels of play it might not seem that important, but when it is the best of the best playing, games can be won and lost on such things.  And all of this is further emphasized on the mid role. Mid players in LoL often seem to be the superstars whereas the trend in Dota has slowly started moving away from that.  Dota on the other hand has alot more decision making that can impact the game, that has nothing to do with skill. Like the decision to walk back and get something from courier but missing xp or risk it getting sniped. Or whether to bottle crow or go for the rune. Or whether to group up with your team because the enemy have been missing for a while and they might be smoked, but risk losing farm.   I don't believe you can take a Dota 2 pro and expect him to become a top tier LoL player, and I don't think you can take a pro LoL player and expect him to become the best player through his mechanical skill."

What this means:    You are playing Bloodseeker with Blademail.  You use blademail and bloodrage on yourself and the enemy casts a 300 damage nuke.    The final damage is 315 (300 * .75 * 1.4) that you take, and thus the caster also takes 315 damage.  Since the blademail damage is outgoing, the bloodrage won't amplify that damage.  You are playing Bloodseeker and you bloodrage the enemy and activate blademail.  This time they cast a 300 damage nuke on you.  It will get amplified twice: It will do 315 to you, but the enemy will take 420.   This is because the bloodrage isn't amplifying outgoing damage from blademail but the incoming damage on the caster of the spell.  This is why it seems to double dip.  You are playing BS with blademail and both you and the caster are bloodraged.  In this situation the 300 damage nuke will be amplified by 1.4 on cast, and 1.4 on damage taken, then again 1.4 on the damage return (and .75 for resistance reduction).  Meaning that you will take 420 damage, and the caster of the spell will take 617.    Now choosing whether or not to bloodrage the enemy as opposed to yourself in a gank attempt depends on how confident you are they will nuke you during your blademail uptime, and how confident you are you can kill them in that time period.  Generally it's better, but it is additional cast time that slows you down.    Note that this is also why blademail is ridiculously good against bloodseeker.    Typical bloodseekers will bloodrage themselves.  So if they say, come and rupture you while they are bloodraged, you can run.  You will take 1.4x the normal damage of rupture movement damage.  But the bloodseeker will take 1.96x the damage.  Same for all damage dealt by a bloodseeker.    In short, always buy blademail against bloodseeker."
TrueDoTA2,3cj94i,Drop_,2,Wed Jul 8 18:16:18 2015 UTC,"Very interesting write-up, thanks. Usually people shy away from picking BS when the enemy team has a PA, but perhaps Blademail can help by reflecting a massive crit as pure damage, changing the outcome of the engagement (assuming PA has been bloodraged)."
TrueDoTA2,3cj94i,Drop_,3,Wed Jul 8 20:19:25 2015 UTC,"Seems insane to me.  BS is so fucking good against PA it isn't even funny.   PA is 100% reliable on mobility, and Rupture pierces BKB.  But she needs a BKB asap to deal with blademail, and she doesn't have the hp to deal with moving around and having rupture on her.    Also you can get Treads + Aquila + Blademail up way before a PA has hopes of having a BKB, and a BKB + Treads PA is honestly hardly a threat at all.  By the time she has another item you should be well on your way to a MKB or Silver's edge, and by that time her bkb should be at 5/6 seconds as well.  Meaning you can rupture, wait for BKB to wear off, and then re-engage.  She will still be ruptured, and you can save your blademail for when her bkb wears off (assuming it hasn't escalated into full on teamfight at this point).    BS was my go to against PA during the arcana event."
TrueDoTA2,3cj94i,dirtyslarkpicker,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:37:52 2015 UTC,"While your math is correct, I wouldnt recommend buying blademail vs bs, unless you are playing a hero that has the blademail in the hero's default builds (like wk or clock), simply because the bs can just kill creeps anywhere on the map (where he can get really fast because of the insane ms) and heal up pretty quickly. Glimmer cape into tp out is much safer choice."
TrueDoTA2,3cj94i,Drop_,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:30:26 2015 UTC,"It really depends on the hero, but it becomes legit on any bulky hero. Obviously blade mail shadow shaman will be pointless, mostly.    The fact that he can heal up doesn't really matter that much.  He either dies or he doesn't.  And glimmer is hot garbage against bs.  If you don't have the hp to back up blade mail, chances are he can get you into 25% vision with a rite and what ever.  Plus all his spells are pure damage.  So the resistance does nothing.  You're better off getting up and just hoping you can go away in time."

TrueDoTA2,3cj94i,goblinbiddin,2,Wed Jul 8 19:14:00 2015 UTC,"The reason blademail was viable on BS before wasn't that it has a special interaction with bloodrage but simply because you can't ignore a 600ms bloodseeker running at your team, and so you are forced to take the blademail return damage as he's smacking you around. The fact that it no longer amplifies outgoing damage with the ""no return"" flag isn't as significant as you would think.  Bottom line: It's good because you can make people take the return damage, and if you get even 1 kill while it's up (not difficult) you end up with a big enough health pool to make focusing you through the blademail very difficult and costly."
TrueDoTA2,3cj94i,Alieksiei,3,Wed Jul 8 17:58:21 2015 UTC,"Blademail's amp used to be huge tho. I remember going bs every game we had an enemy tinker and just running through march with bm on, killing him in the process all game long."

TrueDoTA2,3cj94i,Aesyn,0,Wed Jul 8 14:58:55 2015 UTC,"If I'm not wrong;   Let's say opponent deals 1000 damage after reductions to you. Since you are bloodraged, you take that as 1400. Blade mail normally returns it as 1400, but since you are bloodraged you deal 40 percent more damage. final number is 1960 damage. If you can also bloodrage your opponent same calculations also apply to him and things get out of hand pretty fast.   Edit: as I suspected I've been corrected, check below."
TrueDoTA2,3cj94i,cvuk,8,Wed Jul 8 10:07:37 2015 UTC,"Does not amplify outgoing damage when it has the ""no-reflection"" flag (e.g. damage from Blade Mail icon.png Blade Mail, Spiked Carapace icon.png Spiked Carapace, Fatal Bonds icon.png Fatal Bonds).    You are only bloodraged. Opponent deals 1000 dmg after reductions. Will receive 1400. Blademail will return 1400 pure damage. Both are bloodraged. Opponent deals 1400 dmg after reductions (1000 * 1.4 for outgoing damage amp due to bloodrage on opponent). Will receive 1960 damage (1400*1.4 for incoming damage amplification due to bloodrage). Blademail will return 1960 damage (no amplification when blademail hits the target back).   So you still get 1.96 times the damage your opponent's spell/autoattack will inflict upon you back at them. Before it was 2.744 which was outright ridiculous. double damage is enough i would assume to make blademail more than viable on bloodcyka."
TrueDoTA2,3cj94i,Aesyn,3,Wed Jul 8 10:28:15 2015 UTC,"On point 2: Blademail return damage could be getting amplified. Are you sure it doesn't? Because it only says ""Does not amplify outgoing damage"". Blademail hitting your opponent would be incoming, no?"
TrueDoTA2,3cj94i,cvuk,10,Wed Jul 8 10:37:25 2015 UTC,Yeah the wording seems a bit ambiguous so tried it out in a lobby just now.  Sven Stormhammer Lvl 1 = 100 magic damage (75 after reductions).   Bloodseeker rages himself: 105 damage taken. Sven 0 damage. (1.4 times incoming damage.) Bloodseeker rages both: 147 damage taken. Sven 0 damage. (1.96 times incoming damage.) Bloodseeker rages himself + Blademail: 105 damage taken. Sven 105 damage. (1.4 times incoming+outgoing damage.) Bloodseeker rages both+Blademail: 147 damage taken. Sven 205 damage. (1.96 times incoming + 2.744 times outgoing damage.)   As we can see you were right. The wording in the wiki is just fine it's just too outright  ridiculous to believe.  Here is the combat log: http://imgur.com/a/vrEKD
TrueDoTA2,3cj94i,Squadeep,1 point,Wed Jul 8 10:49:46 2015 UTC,"So when all is said and done you are really just using a blademail which deals 40% more damage to the opponent, but amplifies damage on both sides. I don't think that's too ridiculous to be honest.  Would it be more effective to just bloodrage the sven? You recieve 75 damage, reflect 75, deal 105. It technically does the same percentage, and you don't lose as much health."
TrueDoTA2,3ch5s6,PepperJohn,9,Tue Jul 7 21:42:38 2015 UTC,"Jungle lycan is kinda meh, he's not really efficient at it compared to other heroes. Try playing him as farming safelane (or even mid, better than jungle imo), you can pressure the T1 with your allies and go rosh when you feel like it, but beware they'll notice when you leave the lane.   After some time try switching up lane farm with your support to get him 6 for example (prior to roshing), go jungle farm some camps switch back to lane, etc, they'll stop overreacting when you disappear that way.  You can build him in a lot of ways, i really like vlads on him, + necro and ac for pushing, or you can go straight bkb after it and fight with your ult. If you go the fighting route basher is really key"
TrueDoTA2,3ch5s6,Thlight,7,Tue Jul 7 22:48:04 2015 UTC,"Jungle lycan isn't a problem with inefficiency cause he gets to a point where he can outfarm loads of heroes and still pressure the map, the issue is executing it properly early and getting good spawns. IIRC you can get as early as a 6 minute vlads but if you mess it up or get camped or get crap spawns it can be super late.   It's why you see pro lycan players transitioning into the jungle so early and letting a support like visage take lane farm. He can farm the jungle efficiently with just level 5 and a couple of items. He's just nowhere near the efficiency of enigma or bloodseeker primarily due to his awfulness in the first 4-6 minutes.  Although I do agree with what you are saying, you should always aim to safe lane lycan if you can, it's just way easier and way harder to disrupt, and in the worst case scenario you can soak exp until level 4-5 and then go farm jungle."

Lycan only runs fast, he's not immune to stuns. I prefer going vlads - treads - medallion - bkb - bash - solar crest - necrobook. Possibly not all in that order, I might get necrobook right after bkb, if the game starts going more passively."
TrueDoTA2,3ch5s6,PeenoyDoto,2,Wed Jul 8 05:44:59 2015 UTC,"Well, you'd pick up bkb against stun heavy lineups anyway...  In fact, you should pick up bkb no matter if you're split pushing or fight oriented build."

He hits like a truck when he has to show up, but you really should prioritize split pushing with necrobook instead of figting ,because at that point just get a satanic, heart, and assault."

If you find microing wolves boring, I don't know what you mean. Scouting and solo pushing with only Wolves plus howl while being off the map is kind of fun. Microing them on enemy heroes to move follow them or disable blink daggers is clutch.   If you don't like roshan, skip vladimirs and go necrobook Rush. If you have a bottle, which you should anyways, it's more than enough regen.   Try solar crest and helm of the dominator. Microing a hasted ""Chen"" creep is fun and potentially game winning.

TrueDoTA2,3ch5s6,wildtarget13,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:58:23 2015 UTC,"Offlane lycan is probably better, you can mess with the creep equilibrium by dragging creeps around with your wolves and then farm under tower, and then do most of the same stuff you would have done if you were in the jungle.  Lycan should be smacking buildings whenever possible, but if you absolutely can't, blademail builds aren't bad for fighting. You simply cannot ignore a 650MS wolf running through your team eating your supports."
TrueDoTA2,3ch5s6,goblinbiddin,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:32:50 2015 UTC,I think solar crest has made lycan very strong again. I like the safelane to lvl 5 then jungle idea as well. The problem with lycan is that if you don't win early he can be pretty weak late and he is not very good at ganking heroes.
TrueDoTA2,3cfdvz,TheDrGoo,18,Tue Jul 7 14:09:29 2015 UTC,"Probably not the feedback you're looking for, but I do not think this is a useful resource. I can't really think of any way that this information would be utilized outside of a niche interest. If you are set on this project, you need to find a way to ""weight"" these numbers, as ""stat set"" or ""effective range"" is not anywhere as significant as the other factors.  I also think some of the numbers seem unpolished, just a quick instance would be ranking Clockwerk over Centaur or Prophet for lane control. Or putting Enchantress at 2 for lane control- she has the ability to make a creep wave go from 5v5 to 4v6. Ditto on Invoker, Exort Invoke has a much stronger lane control than you give him credit for. Legion is an extremely survivable hero, but only gets a 3 in defensive power. These just seem very arbitrary.  I really don't understand your lane control description either. How does Techies, one of the slowest heroes, score perfectly when he will miss a couple creep waves if he leaves the lane? What is the point in controlling the lane if you never leave it?  Relevant factors I think you're omitting:   Gold Advantage: How well hero can take advantage of mid's gold opportunity. Otherwise they might as well be in solo offlane, just soaking exp. This would help reduce Techie's viability, as his high ranking shows your sheet is pretty busted. Rune control: Really this should be changed from lane control. Techies has 0 ability to rune effectively and this is almost the whole point of controlling the lane to begin with. Ability to take tower/push: Should be self explanatory. Ability to make space: This would help for mids that like to rotate into Jungle or off the map (i.e. Riki, Ursa, Invoker). If the enemy has to invest in resources just because you're not around, that's significant enough to make note of.   If you'd really like to chart mid viability, I'd recommend doing it based on mid match-ups. That'd be a much more encompassing project though and a very different take than what you're going for."

This obviously means in no way that mid techies is a good idea, he doesnt really need that mich farm priority early into the game, its really a wasted lane.

Axe can't solo mid vs a hero like Razor or Lina without being forced out of lane or feeding. There is absolutely no way. Yet your list has him rated higher than both of these heroes.  Here's a tip, make actual criteria for each of your ratings and then stick with it. For example:  1- is basically a creep  2- is  slightly better than a creep  3 - proficiency expected of a noncreep  4- above average amongst the noncreeps 5- King of the Noncreeps  Your numbers look like they are completely arbitrary excluding what heroes cannot mid.

Those values don't make sense (not talking about relation to each other for the specific heroes, just about how little sense the sheet seems to make).  I think it is not something you can easily put into a spreadsheet and get the best values, especially since a lot of factors depend on the lane situation. Sure, Axe might work against a melee, but you'll probably face a ranged enemy. You'll get harassed out of the lane while pushing like crazy, that's usually not helpful. Also not sure where def power 5 for Axe comes from, he can only increase his armor a bit with call. Take a look at Nyx's 2, he got Spiked Carapace and an effective stun. Or Tinker's 2, who can actually just laser an enemy and beat him to death.  Another example would be effective range. Techies 5? That completely ignores that his attacks actually deal half the damage of normal attacks, his mines are the most relevant tool in the lane, but he can't just magically place them whereever he wants.

He starts our with high armor and movement speed for defensive power, although he has low hp and no escapes or regen.    Also regarding his stat set he has good armor, attack time/animation and move speed.  He also has a nice sized mana pool to start relative to his spell cost.  Unless you're going for a heavy missle based laning phase in which case you need some mana regen.  His major disadvantage in lane is his short attack range.  But that can be completely mitigated by his abilities.  Also, don't let the haters get you down.  A lot of time people don't realize how useful things are until they're made.

It can work in situations that you are ahead or dominate early but since spirit breaker relies on ganking to get money, the 1800 gold is better spent on parts of a bkb in most situations. Or building a midas if you have it in decent time.  That being said, treads, stout, oov, urn, wand are my go to early items on him. Moving into a bkb, halbard, blade mail, sange yasha, shadowblade into silver edge, even lotus orb is justified in the right game. Late game curass, or vlads to become the aura carrier for the team is a good option.  Skill build is usually 3-0-2-1 at 6. The extra stun length on charge is usually better then the extra damage from bash. 4-1-4-2 at 11 provides the most possible damage.  Sorry for spelling or grammar errors, I'm typing on phone."
TrueDoTA2,3cfibx,MrPineocean,2,Tue Jul 7 15:27:40 2015 UTC,"I think 1-1-4-1 is better for solo kill potential on supports. 2 bashes are guaranteed from skills. You can fish for another while laning, or just pray to rngesus. And it is generally enough for a kill."
TrueDoTA2,3cfibx,Aesyn,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:10:38 2015 UTC,"I would rather have the extra stun duration so that the support or whatever target gets less of a chance to react to your combo, but player preference."
TrueDoTA2,3cfibx,MrPineocean,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:25:33 2015 UTC,"While I agree that that's the optimal skill build for the chaos/space creating spirit breaker, his bash damage scales with movement speed, so theoretically your damage output is more if you put points in your w before your charge. However the extra stun time is usually the safer bet given you have a team mate around for some follow up damage."
TrueDoTA2,3cfibx,SirAvery,2,Tue Jul 7 16:35:12 2015 UTC,"I remember reading a theory craft somewhere about having levels in W over charge in like a 1-4-4-2 or 2-3-4-2 and the 4-1-4-2 at 11 came out ahead by like 40 dps or something. The stun length from charge ended up increasing dmg with the extra auto attacks moreso than the potential movespeed increased bashes. The stun length also increases the uptime of allied attacks on the charged target like you mentioned.  I can't find the post right now so don't take it as gospel, but I still think in most situations that 4-1-4-2 at 11 is the superior build."
TrueDoTA2,3cfibx,MrPineocean,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:49:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah I would agree, because the extra damage output from the w relies on rng and more often than not sb isn't the main source of damage. He just could potentially right click harder with w maxed."
TrueDoTA2,3cfibx,SirAvery,5,Tue Jul 7 16:56:08 2015 UTC,"Disclaimer: I'm a scrub, but Spirit Breaker is my most successful and most played hero.   I used to love mask of madness, but since they nerfed the movement speed buff, I find its no good.   I basically always go boots > urn, then try to get some kills. If you can get boots and urn even slightly quickly, you're pretty damn strong. Hell, even with just boots you're strong enough to gank if you see a good opportunity.   Use the gold from those ganks to finish your treads, then start working on a shadow blade.   I used to think shadow blade was a too gimmicky, but now that you can upgrade it to a silver edge, it's almost always a good buy. You can activate shadow blade while charging and the charge impact won't break your invisibility, making it easy to land the big damage follow up hit, then ult to finish them. The only time I wouldn't buy shadow blade is if there is another invisible ganking hero on the team. Forcing the enemy to buy detection and play safe can be worth it, but the shadow blade is a waste of they are already under that pressure.   After a shadow blade I usually like to get an assault cuirass. It'll be handy while ganking and in a teamfight.   If you're teamfighting a lot, an aghs can be a good choice, letting you ult two or even three times in a fight and giving your ult an AoE stun.   Otherwise I'd go for a mjolnir or moon shard. More attack speed = more bashes = more broken spirits.   Honourable mention goes to BKB. Is rather go without it, and you can get away with that of you are ganking and the enemy doesn't know how to deal with invisibility, but if you find you're getting stunned, especially in teamfights, get a BKB.   For a skill build, I usually go charge, bash, aura. Once you have charge and bash, you're ready to gank, especially if you have boots, so keep an eye out.   Then it's bash at 4, charge at 5, ult, then max bash. Max charge next, then finish aura, taking ult when you can.   Hope that helps!"

TrueDoTA2,3cfibx,HXCpolarbear,2,Wed Jul 8 23:27:04 2015 UTC,"So I've played a good bit of sb, and I've been having a lot of success with this new idea I like to call patience breaker. He's by no means a hard carry, he's most effectively played as a space creating 3 position.   I think the biggest issue with sb is how reckless of a hero he can be. Given he's the tankiest level 1 hero in game, an under farmed and overly excited spirit breaker will feed. Even if they feed a bit they can still be making room for their carries and setting up ganks, but obviously the most effective way to play him is to get those ganks and not give anything up for them.   This is why after the standard urns and treads, I will often opt for either hood of defiance or vanguard. If all goes well and you play conservatively for the first 10 minutes (and by conservatively I mean not leaving lane until you hit level 6, then trying to gank the furthest out lane and hope you start snowballing) you should be able to pick up that major defensive item, and then charge deep with impunity. Getting his defensive item allows him to keep from falling off by making sure he survives every engagement, thus reducing the amount of farm he needs for subsequent items and levels.   Patience breaker is best breaker."
TrueDoTA2,3cfibx,SirAvery,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:47:20 2015 UTC,"I played Spirit Breaker for the first time in a long time a couple days ago, and I went full roamer. I put a lot of pressure on our safelane and mid (our offlaner was a really passive WR so I couldn't really kill their safelane unfortunately). I ended up going pretty negative, 0 kills 4 deaths and a lot of assists around 15 minutes in.   Still though, I made so much space that our carry and mid ended up doing better than their freefarm carry (and our WR didn't do too bad despite trading free farm against a harder carry).   My point is, how do you play patience breaker as a roamer? It doesn't really seem possible since I had no reliable source of XP. I was controlling runes but letting my mid get them, so not many bounties went my way either."
TrueDoTA2,3cfibx,undatedseapiece,2,Tue Jul 7 19:53:52 2015 UTC,"The answer is you do not play patience breaker as an early roamer. Imo it's not viable to start roaming until you have urn, boots, a tp scroll, and level 6 at the bare minimum. Otherwise it's too easy to fall off into the late game. Usually just take farm priority on the offlane for  5-10 minutes, you and wr probably could have been pretty threatening, and she could have easily transitioned to more of a core than a support once you leave the lane and start creating space.   You can tp/charge to counter initiate before level 6, but aside from that you should stay in your lane and play that safe patience breaker."
TrueDoTA2,3cfibx,SirAvery,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:09:41 2015 UTC,"you and wr probably could have been pretty threatening   Trust me that was the plan, I think we could have wrecked the lane. She was not communicating, and wasn't putting any pressure on the safelane, just sitting way back and powershotting for last hits, playing super scared for some reason.  When I'm losing the lane or getting literally nothing out of it, I just say fuck it and roam and do my best. Do you think patience breaker is best solo offlane for a quick 6, or dual aggro offlane with a support to guarantee farm?"
TrueDoTA2,3cfibx,undatedseapiece,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:14:49 2015 UTC,"Aw man that's situation is no fun, deffinitely not optimal but in that position I would just try and take some of the farm, throw out some denies and harass until you get 6. Spirit breaker is literally the tankiest level 1 hero, so even with a shit laning partner spirit breaker can handle a lot of abuse. That and as long as you don't charge aggressively you can almost always escape charge.   Personally I like to play him in a solo lane, but paired with a range support that can take advantage of all that stun, he's definitely a force to be reckoned with. I would probably say I've had the most success solo laning, because it's so easy to over extend as sb when you're running an aggressive dual lane.   But if you're up against a jungler and your support wards their jungle you can usually charge for ez early kills. As far as which heroes you would want to lane with, heavy heavy nukers. Lina, lion, silencer, anybody who can put out some considerable damage and quickly capitalize on any lucky bash. A lot of early kills on sb start with a little harass and a little bit of rngesus getting out of hand. Just remember to think ""patience"" every time you think to charge."

That really depends on their mid hero, in my opinion.  Smoking behind your t1 offlane tower and charging their mid at level 3 can straight up win the lane for your mid hero and still feed you the XP you need to start becoming a threat.  I do this against any squishy mid hero without an escape, especially SF who hates dying and losing half his souls."

The reasoning is that sb usually dies first in a team fight so leveling W for the teammates isn't as great as you think and you want to maximize your burst dps.  MoM will NOT work in higher level play. An MoM sb will die too fast. Armlet+urn is pretty strong, but not my fav. Lately I have been having the best luck with SnY then blademail or BKB.

TrueDoTA2,3cfibx,DeanofDeeps,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:30:26 2015 UTC,"I like to play spirit breaker as position 4. I first start solo offlane with 2 tangos, stout shield, two clarities, and one ward. I try to go for the rune but if I can't it's not a huge deal. There are essentially 3 ways that the lane can go.   The first possibility is a really weak enemy lane that allows me to farm and kill with impunity. It's rare but it happens but be aware that a farmed sb is not as good as winning your other lanes. Sb doesn't need much to be effective so make sure your team gets an advantage during the laning stage.   The second possibility is one where you get a couple last hits and some experience, but nothing special. The lane is hard to get kills in and probably isn't worth it. In these cases, I start thinking about ganking as soon as I get boots. Depending on how much access I get to farm, I might consider farming an orb of venom and smoke as well. Then I attempt to ensure a won mid lane. This usually is done with a charge done from their jungle to make sure I bash them toward my mid. It's not even always necessary to avoid wards because of how easy it is to tower dive with sb.   The third possibility is a lane that is so hard to lane against that you often get very little experience and possibly feed. I leave these lanes as soon as possible, sometimes even without boots. I buy whatever items I can afford, hopefully at least a smoke. This kind of lane can shut down my early game snowball but it's not impossible to come back from.   Now I generally start roaming pre-5 minutes. The items I go for are tranquil boots, drums, shadowblade, and clarities for any mana issues I have. I'll also make urn or glimmercape if u need more survivability. These items are fantastic for space creating. Not only will people feel uncomfortable farming alone, it also has incredible uptime. And with tranquils, you can farm your jungle in a pinch. I feel it's very important to maximize the enemy teams fear of being alone for as long as possible. Even if you don't net any kills, if you force rotations or keep them from spreading, you've done your job. I even smoke in with a charge and shadowblade out, just to send a message sometimes.   The next items to go are utility items that can help in teamfights or deal with split pushers, whichever is necessary. Items for teamfight include halberd(always useful except versus illusion carries), silver edge(now you can kill bristle), Shiva's(incredible aoe but makes charge extra obvious), orchid(underrated on this hero, counters mobile heroes), ac(mostly for bash but also tower taking and team armor), hex (useful hard disable), euls(if you're poor or have a specifically good reason to buy it like cancelling death ward), blade mail (make them pay for killing you when you dive too far), bkb (boooring, need it vs jakiro), solar crest(someone else should probably grab this but it'll help your tankiness), and any other items you feel to be necessary. Attack speed items are especially needed if you want to be a split push killer or anti carry. These can include mom, yasha, eblade, mjollnir, moonshard, and orchid (seriously it's pretty damn good). However, I find this role to be worse than others because rng plays too much of a role in its success. Any of these items will work, just pick them based on what you need.  Luxury items are obviously all dependant on the game but I would like to advocate aghs and refresher (this is ultra ultra late). I think aghs is a great item on sb because it allows for nether strike initiations. People underestimate the cast range which allows for pickoffs from fog or during stalemates. It's especially good if your team lacks good blink initiation. And if you're in deep after the nether strike, you can still charge out or shadowblade out. Although escape is not guaranteed, if you do escape the combo is back in a very short time. I sometimes go aghs before major utility items because of how useful your ultimate becomes. The refresher is a high risk high reward item that should never be gotten if your team has strong team fight. Honestly it should almost never be gotten regardless, but I think it's worth talking about. If your team does have weak teamfight(I mean really garbage disables) the aoe stun of charge is very good and might be worth refreshing. But most importantly, charge is one of the biggest non-ulti bkb counters in the game. It's a 1.6 second stun on any bkb'd hero you pass through. It's OK to charge a creep in the back of the teamfight just to make sure you stun the bkb carry. When bkbs are low, your refresher combo can completely nullify the bkb's on the other team. That's without your ulti too. If you have enigma or magnus, don't bother, they can do your job better than you can.  The build I go is 1-1-4-1. The damage is the primary reason I do this but I also really like the increased bash duration that I get on people I charge through. When I charge, I don't always charge my main target. I'll charge whatever enemy will let me bash the most enemy heroes as I come through. That way I get more overall stun duration on multiple heroes instead of one high duration stun on one hero. If you're playing with a sb, make sure to guarantee that his charge passes through many people. Bait out a stun or two just before he shows up, because with charge cancelled sb is pretty worthless. This build also is better for solo killing people because you only need to be lucky once or twice to net yourself a kill. Max charge builds are probably better against high skill teammates and teams with hard counters because it gives them less time to react. After I go 1-1-4-1, I then max empowering haste. It's a damage boost and escape put together. It's incredibly good if they don't have reliable stuns or have aoe you want to dodge. I also think it's better than having a maxed charge during the mid game teamfights. And it makes your entire team hard to kite.   Pretty much I think that itemizing solo kill potential is not the best way to play sb. He can solo most people with some luck so I prefer making him a farm disruptor and teamfight disabler."
TrueDoTA2,3cfibx,geoawk,-5,Wed Jul 15 22:22:43 2015 UTC,"I know there aren't a lot of people that would advocate position 4 or lower spirit breaker, but I feel that offlane spirit breaker shouldn't be built any differently.  I think bottle is stronger than URN on him. He does have amazing rune control, but is strong early if he ends up getting into a rune fight.  Urn gives him let's say 800 HP IF AND WHEN he gets a kill, whereas a full bottle gives him 405 HP and 210 Mana. Not to mention URN gives SB no mana since he has under the 33 INT threshold of basilius mana regen, which makes a basilius better on him until he gets INT treads.  I personally think strength treads are good, but i find they are overrated. Attack speed is important for spirit breaker, but him getting more bashes off is important only if he can be in the middle of fights.   For solo kills, phase boots has it's perks too, and spirit breaker actually has very low damage and attack speed early. Solving either of them first is an option. And phase boots in conjunction with and early level of your speed aura let's you not be kited. It also helps you stay in vision for a second charge better than treads.  Tranquil boots are also an option for early armor and good for the offlane. They let you stay alive when you charge and get focused. They are less offesnive, but if you're the first hero in, being defensive is never weak unless your role is to be the YOLO mobile initiator.   Max your charge first, your damage from bash scales 50 damage per level, but your charge is a reliable stun and at max level will disable for more time than your bash can. Never skip a value point of your speed aura. if you're getting it at level 10 and you've been around alllies, you've already lost a lot of value from it.  Blademail is probably more core than madness, although once you get blademail, the synergy with madness is amazing.   Shadowblade, maelstrom, and midas are all situationally greedy farming GPM increasing builds. Shadow farms heroes and let's you split push better, very counterable survivability.  Building surviability is usually the answer on him because SB is picked for his lockdown, not his solo kill potential. He has that too, but if he does that, he becomes usless in teamfights without BKB up.  Pipe, vlads, and crimson guard all are good EHP items and let your give aura to your team. Solar crest is good too and builds into halberd or butterfly. Glimmer is also good, but it can be upgraded into shadowblade and the mana costs of glimmer can be solved with orchid or soul ring.  Notice I'm not mentioning Crit or MKB or BKB? BKB is probably core to get once you start getting reasonable levels of farm, but spirit breaker isn't a hero that has trouble carrying once he has farm. It's a hero that tries to be a carry when he doesn't have farm and fails at it. Aghs is also situationally important for the 20 CD and AOE ulti bash."
TrueDoTA2,3cfibx,wildtarget13,3,Tue Jul 7 18:44:41 2015 UTC,You are forgetting the offensive perks to urn. That extra bit of damage can mean a lot when you apply it to your target in the early game. Also the mana regeneration from it pretty much covers his mana issues unless it's a longer fight.
TrueDoTA2,3cfibx,MrPineocean,2,Tue Jul 7 19:23:29 2015 UTC,"Not only that, but urn is best on heroes that are going to be around kills, and it's a bonus if they're a strength hero. I would almost never skip urn on him honestly."
TrueDoTA2,3cfibx,undatedseapiece,-1,Tue Jul 7 19:58:32 2015 UTC,"Sure, for canceling blinks and killing refraction or tree armor. And urn is a fine item stand alone for allies.

Most of the time, I end up 2-4-0-1 at lv 7, and 4-4-1-1 at lv 11. Since Slardar is the type that tends to get active after his first big item, relying on bash is a pretty unreliable way to fight. So I just get my treads+blink, and maybe an OoV, and that's pretty much my fighting core. You move really fast with Q, so catching them isn't gonna be a problem, especially as W's cd is pretty low, and it also has a slow on top of the stun.   After I get a bit more attack speed (armlet is helpful for this), bash becomes a wee bit more reliable, so the timing is perfect for when you start levelling it."
TrueDoTA2,3cbuu2,PeenoyDoto,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:58:59 2015 UTC,Thanks for your response!  Now do you find yourself that your skill/level of play allows you to utilize Q to your advantage (albeit the increased dmg taken) moreso than an unreliable E bash? Would maxing Q make more sense for someone of lesser skill.. say if someone who was 2.5K MMR.. than maxing E instead?
TrueDoTA2,3cbuu2,PeenoyDoto,2,Mon Jul 6 19:04:56 2015 UTC,"We're actually more or less in the same skill bracket (I hover in the 3.6-4k range), and yes, I'd still max Q most cases. For one, only one level of Q is more likely to bring harm than do good, as you're trading away a sizable chunk of your EHP for a measly 20% movespeed boost.  He also can't just bumrush an MoM after treads, like Void does, as he'd melt with the amplification from both MoM and Sprint. That's a big reason for why he can't max Bash. Error 404: Attack Speed not found.   So yea, I'd say Q is still a higher priority over E most games, with the exception of a few situations, like, say, you have a troll on your team and you get your blink pretty quickly, then you can probably forego the last few levels of sprint and max E, as the attspd boost+stun+amplify damage would probably be enough to wreck most targets."

Imagine what a tide would do to that lane.  If you anticipate a safelane this weak, you should punish it, not pick an equally weak offlane."
TrueDoTA2,3cbuu2,goblinbiddin,2,Tue Jul 7 21:25:05 2015 UTC,"just want to note that slardar absolutely does NOT need damage. His ultimate is all he needs along with the small damage gains attached to survivability items like BKB, Sange and its upgrades, Heart."
TrueDoTA2,3cbuu2,Skyro620,2,Mon Jul 6 23:14:33 2015 UTC,"He's also up against Centuar Warrunner, who has better burst damage, essentially the same stun, a team global max move speed ult  (instead of self-target sprint), and can survive the solo offlane.  Slardar's ult is good, but long-lasting truesight isn't that great in competitive games where players know how to handle invisible heroes, and someone on the team already carries a medallion/solar crest. He's got a bash, but its not a perma-bash.  I think he's great in pubs if you know what you're doing with him. He can melt single heroes and the ult gives him the power to finish them off solo."
TrueDoTA2,3cbuu2,teganandsararock,2,Mon Jul 6 18:58:05 2015 UTC,"I think both of these heroes are actually on the way out, because centaur is starting to have trouble against strong trilanes, even tho he is the stronger laner.  Again, Slardar would be ok if he could deal with his farming speed issues. Maybe if you can get MoM -> Blink -> bkb really fast he could work as a 1 role (he's much better at that than centaur) outside that i'm not sure he's anything but a curve-ball pick for a 3 stun aggro tri."
TrueDoTA2,3cbuu2,Skyro620,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:01:22 2015 UTC,"My problem with MoM is if i need to use sprint to initiate, adding MoM on top of it makes me feel squishier than a skywrath mage. I'm sure this can be avoided with better positioning though..  I almost prefer vlads or HoD and going moonshard instead or AC, but MoM goes online way earlier. If you go MoM, wouldnt you want E maxed before Q then?"
TrueDoTA2,3cbuu2,RampagingRagE,3,Mon Jul 6 19:06:40 2015 UTC,"So use blink to initiate!  the MoM if to try to deal with slardar's piss poor farming speed. tried it just now, it was... ok. worked out, we won, i got a triple kill under t3 at the end of the game... the bkb is really good with MoM."
TrueDoTA2,3cbuu2,Skyro620,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:07:08 2015 UTC,"yea, I understand why he's not in competitive scene especially when comparing against cent. I'm aiming more for pub play. I want to play him more without having to put my team at a disadvantage by picking him. Basically, if anyone knows of a way to build/play him that fits into most games then that's what I'm after. I like my max W/E build and use drums/S&Y to build up my MS instead of my Q early on. The extra damage taken really hurts early on so I have decided to build Q E against it. However, I got a lot of backlash from my team (although my build really paid dividends) for not maxing Q and maxing E instead. I want to get a good critique why maxing Q over E is superior most/all of the time because right now I'm not convinced.. but then again I'm a lower level player at 3.5k~ish mmr"
TrueDoTA2,3cbuu2,RampagingRagE,2,Mon Jul 6 19:02:49 2015 UTC,"1) Slardar has been a pub stomper for a long time with a win rate well north of 50%.  2) His ""issue"" is where to lane him, but IMO a lot of that has to do with people not seeing him as a carry. IMO he is a legit carry and is worthy of farm in a 1 or 3 (dual offlane) role. He can man fight with the best of them due to ult and bash which has no CD like basher/AB does.  3) He can technically be played as a support but Centaur would do better in that role than Slardar would.  4) Slardar is already very tanky with good HP and armor, and he his ult means he doesn't have to build big damage items. His biggest needs after Blink/SB and BKB is attack speed to maximize his bash. SB/SE is very good on a carry Slardar if you have another initiator on your team. Maelstrom is similarly very good, and helps Slardar farm faster. I think Armlet is built way too much on Slardar as he already manfights so well as is."
TrueDoTA2,3cbuu2,TrenchLordKaede,2,Mon Jul 6 21:28:51 2015 UTC,"The thing is, two of his abilties (W,R) which make him a good manfighter can be used supportively. I still like him as a hero, but as man fighters go, hes not as good as others.  Still, I really dont think anyone can know for sure whether or not hes really viable or if people have just been building him wrong. I do think i know how scary a blink slardar at 9 minutes is on a hero without a good escape, and think blink first is the way to go and after that is up to you, unless youre playing against heroes with good escapes, in which case maybe this treads yasha could be alright.  But he does fall off as a manfighter and i dont think its completely honest to say he can manfight with the best of them"
TrueDoTA2,3cbuu2,CNHphoto,3,Mon Jul 6 23:39:27 2015 UTC,"You can say that about a lot of heroes (2/4 skills can used supportively). I think most people would take Centaur ult over Slardar ult as a support skill 9 out of 10 times. If you needed minus armor Dazzle is a million times better as a support.  What makes him a good manfighter is his lockdown. He can maintain ~50% lockdown with Treads/SB/Mjol, add 2.5s stun every 8s and you start to get an idea of the lockdown he can produce. He's not the best manfighter there is, but he's up there, which is interesting since I don't believe many see him in that light. Silver Edge is also tailor-made for Slardar as well and can allow him to man fight some otherwise stronger manfighters.  IMO he is built very poorly, at least in terms of the general population. Look at how much Armlet and Deso is built on him (both top 5 items). Slardar's kit already has plenty of damage built into it. He needs to use his valuable item slots to shore up his weaknesses, not his strengths (and why would you suggest Yasha?). And even given this he still sports a near 54% win rate!"
TrueDoTA2,3cbuu2,punriffer5,1 point,Tue Jul 7 04:07:13 2015 UTC,"I believe his high win rate is inflated due to the fact that he is picked as a counter to invis heroes in lower brackets, where noone buys detection he makes a huge difference.  Other than this i agree, every time i see an armlet or deso slardar i cry. They are so shitty and sloppy on him... After dagger all you want is to get tankier (bkb, cuirass, tarrasque) and to get more atk spd (cuirass, mjollnir or moonshard i guess).  I generally just go cuirass after blink bkb. Atk spd works wonders on him, while the damage armlet gives you is... Well it is not worth for an item that costs more than half a bkb.  Deso is even worse, if tou wanan stck -armor just get a damn cuirass, which also gives you armor and the most needed atk spd, deso is sincerely garbage on him.  Yasha-sny are parely useless, a quick drums might be ok sometimes, but still most matches you just wanna rush blink, and then you need bkb."
TrueDoTA2,3cbuu2,wildtarget13,1 point,Wed Jul 8 09:00:12 2015 UTC,"54% winrate is a very large discrepancy, I highly doubt him being used as a counter to invis heroes in low brackets even comes close to explaining it. You can make that same counterpicking argument about almost any hero really.  Slardar to me is pretty inflexible build-wise. Treads + Blink or SB + BKB is core. Add in a slot for TP and you have only 2 slots left. Then you still have to deal with Slardar's possible mana problems (especially if you go SB) and slow farm rate."
TrueDoTA2,3cbuu2,dpekkle,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:16:14 2015 UTC,"Well im not saying he would have a 45% win rate, but in an environment where you have no detection he has a big extra value."
TrueDoTA2,3cbuu2,wildtarget13,2,Wed Jul 8 19:19:40 2015 UTC,try atos on him if you are winning. Your main issue is going to be mana since if you run out you aren't capable of applying pressure. The active is really cheap and pretty strong as a follow up to a blink initiation and I find the extra hp useful when initiating into high ground or other dangerous situations   If you aren't winning and need more damage then go for something like AC. And don't get Atos if you don't have any other decent physical dps on your team.
TrueDoTA2,3cbuu2,Harlequeens,1 point,Tue Jul 7 09:45:11 2015 UTC,"Hmm, I'll give that a try. I was playing riki the other day and I felt that an atos would work really well on him to keep people in smoke"
TrueDoTA2,3cbuu2,wildtarget13,1 point,Tue Jul 7 13:13:16 2015 UTC,"The best non-blink build I've seen and tried for Slardar is Shadow Blade (this was pre-6.84). It's pretty effective, since the extra attack speed is pretty welcomed for Slardar. Additionally, if you have 3 points into Sprint, you can move at max 522 movespeed if you Sprint and then Shadow Blade. This give you pretty solid initiation and chase. Since 6.84 gave us Silver Edge, I'd say that gives more options to Slardar.  Also, Glimmer Cape on Slardar could be a decent pickup too. You could sprint and glimmer for a quick escape."
TrueDoTA2,3c9u87,physics223,5,Mon Jul 6 05:50:23 2015 UTC,"I'm not the best Naga player, not the worst.  But she's one of my favorite heroes so I've spent a lot of time watching replays and things like that.  That's the best way to learn if you really want to be a good Naga player.  I think the best player on the hero is Meracle but he doesn't play her much in pubs.  Arteezy, Black, Merlini are all great too.  Check their dotabuff every once in a while and find some replays to save.  Watch them player perspective.  Skill Build  Mid/Safelane carry is always going to be a max riptide and mirror image build.  Something like 4-1-4-1 at level 10.  Most players go stats over leveling ensnare past level 1.  If you want to prioritize between riptide and mirror image depends on the game mostly.  If the enemy laner has no aoe Mirror image can be better for last hitting/farming , usually riptide is better.  Not a ton to say on skill build besides that.  Support is usually max riptide and ensnare.  Maybe one point in mirror image for scouting and stacking.  Definitely get song at 6.  Items  Your core is pretty basic.  Mid you want bottle > brown boots > aquila > quelling blade > radiance > travels.  From there it's either going to be Octarine core or Manta.  I like a hybrid of finishing yasha, then going Octarine Core, then finishing Manta.  Generally I think if you're losing Octarine Core is better, if you're winning Manta is better.  Manta is better if there's some important stun/silence you need to disjoint.  Core is generally better at helping to turtle.  After that it's a choice of basically Diffusal, Butterfly, Skadi and then situationally stuff like Linkins.  Some people like heart, I'd say go Skadi over it in every situation.  You never really should be sitting outside of base poking with your hero to the point where you need heart regen.  Late late game the best items are what you would imagine.  Refresher/Consumed moon shard/Travels 2/Necro 3 on courier ect.  Support core is generally Mana boots + other stuff.  Super super flexible but some of the most popular stuff is maybe wand, urn, mek, glimmer cape, vlads, medallion/crest, halbred ect.  Basically anything goes.  Random notes  I tried to keep the post organize but realized I said absolutely nothing novel.  Here's random things worth thinking about/discussing or things I noted and wanted peoples opinions.   Naga as a base hero is super strong.  Remember that early game.  320 ms, 6 armor, base health regen of .75 hp/s (standard = .25) and good base stats overall.  Don't fall too into the ""don't fight until radiance"" or farm all game mindset.   You can trade hits with most heroes and doubly so if you have PMS or they have the riptide debuff. Mana boots is legit on core Naga more so than ever because of Octarine core.  If you're mid I think generally you can do okay with rune controlling and bottle crow but safelane I like Mana boots + bottle.  Mana pool/regen = most spells = more farm. Meracle started going Travels before Radiance (after aquila, quelling, bottle).  Not sure if I get the logic or if he'll continue to do it but it's worth noting. Most people know this but gem true sight is transferred to your illusions making her one of the best carriers especially if support. Bad Naga's farm their whole jungle and maybe 1 lane that's most pushed in.  Good Naga's farm the enemies' jungle and the pushed out lanes.  Since you farm with illusions your job is to take the dangerous farm and leave safe farm for your other core heroes.  Don't be the guy that starves his team for 50 minutes then flames them for not having items."

TrueDoTA2,3c9u87,Ah-Bin,2,Tue Jul 7 08:44:59 2015 UTC,"You have two options - use it defensively, or use it offensively for setup.  If using it offensively you should either a) try to be bait and hope they cant stun/silence you until you are dead so you can get it off, or b) initiate with song when you have vision.  The key thing is to use it before your teammates engage.  They can use it to set up things like static field + storm, black hole, ravage, epicenter, etc.  But for this type of play to work you've always got to be the first one in, AND your team has to expect you to do it.  IF they drop their ults at the same time you song neither of you maybe did anything wrong but you didn't communicate it right and the combination means you are fucked.    If you use is defensively, just wait until your teammates are in a tight situation being ganked, interrupted on roshan, etc.  For this type of play you want to be LAST in your lineup to engage.  You want to be in the back using your illusions to do work with attacks and riptides, while you hang out in a safe position ready to song if things take a turn for the worse.    For this type of play you have to be really good at evaluating what your team wants to do and whether or not you will win the fight.  If you do this hoping to disengage, and your teammates are already partially committed to fighting, you might have just fucked your team."
TrueDoTA2,3c9u87,Drop_,2,Tue Jul 7 21:54:26 2015 UTC,"What I want to know is why more people don't go Arcane Boots on Naga now.  EE used to do it all the time, and then would sell the Booster lategame once he ran out of space (kept it after disassembling for travels).    I feel like Arcanes give much more mana for the value now than they used to, as they got significantly buffed.  And to top it off you can use the booster as part of your octarine core, further improving the gold efficiency of the build.    I feel like Brown Boots -> Arcanes -> Radiance -> BoT's -> Manta -> Octarine would be a solid way to play the hero, but I don't play her enough to really give a good estimate of how effective that is.    As for skill builds, many of the nagas go 1x net maxing riptide and illusions.  Riptide increases your farm speed more afaik early, so it's maxed first.  Then illusions since that increases your farm faster than stats or net.  Then stats, then net.    For support I Think net and riptide are the most important, with illusion taking the lowest priority.  Though I might be wrong.  I'm just stating this so someone can disagree with me and tell me why these skill builds aren't ideal."
TrueDoTA2,3c9u87,Drop_,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:48:53 2015 UTC,"As a mid naga, id say that arcane isnt that important. Aquila +Bottle, is more than enough to keep your mana pool up for farming. As long as you bottle crow / rune control / use mana efficiently, you wont run out of mana at all. And the 900 gold feels like it'll slow down radiance timing even more. It could be viable if you dont get bottle but i feel like arcane isnt worth it all. And you can farm 900 gold easily once u have bots + radiance anyway."

Lets your illusion hit harder, gives u some base hp and lets you get in fights here and there and more over Push when possible.

TrueDoTA2,3c9u87,4ll1s0n,2,Mon Jul 6 07:06:05 2015 UTC,I personally think that getting the ult at 6 is really crucial as it eliminates most gank potential from the enemy.
TrueDoTA2,3c9u87,prestonicus711,2,Mon Jul 6 09:03:00 2015 UTC,Sure you can do that. But personally I think most ganks are preventable with map awareness or illusion outplay
TrueDoTA2,3c9u87,4ll1s0n,2,Mon Jul 6 09:07:42 2015 UTC,"I am absolutely certain a level in ult is more valuable than mirror image on 6. Having the ability to save teammates, steal runes, initiate and stop fights and save yourself from ganks is definitely worth more than +5% damage on illusions and a reduction in damage taken. This early you will be most likely using illusions as a rip tide proxy anyway and illusions shouldn't really die before expiring if you micro them.   Map awareness is great, but sometimes you know a gank comes. If you don't have ult you have to stop farming for a while and some of your teammates might die to the gank. If you have ult, you can keep farming and if they commit you get out, wasting your opponents' time and revealing them on the map (maybe even blowing some major spells)  As for Ensnare, it can make sense to skip it, but I still think it is better to skill it if you have any teammates that are likely to help you get a kill with it. Can come very useful when turning around ganks. Especially with so many people coming to visit mid in 6.84."
TrueDoTA2,3c9u87,FabulousMrFox,1 point,Mon Jul 6 12:02:44 2015 UTC,"I, too, am absolutely certain than 4-0-4-0 is the most ideal. I don't disagree with you on all your points about song / ensnare, they are all logical. But in practice, Arteezy, meracle, and many other VHS players have opt for this build. Unless they can secure a kill in a given situation they will always go for 4040. It's kind of like antimage. Would you prefer more mana burn / shorter blink cooldown / larger blink range or stats? Most people opt for stats for the burning build. Yes, in practice those skills make you more versatile and more useful (like the ones you mentioned) but those stats do add up and do increase your farm. I believe the same logic of ""greed"" can apply to naga. In fact there are a small amount people who for 4 0 4 0 to 14 in VHS who are definitely better than myself. I wouldn't take it that far, but they do net some impressive statistics on dotabuff. I still stand my ground on the ganking part too. Assuming both teams are using a defensive tri, you should always play safe if you are unsure of where the supports are. On most parts I send myself to the jungle and illusions in lane / jungle to make the gank more difficult. If you know someone can tp to your lane, especially in higher rankings, than the gank might even go to your advatange.  Again, I don't blame you for disagreeing, your points are very valid, but if myself and many other experienced naga players succeed in 5k, I think our skill builds are the least of worries if we were to improve!"

I just think that this build is the most puzzling of all the ""farm efficiency"" builds.   AM cuts off some blink range and mana burn when he goes for stats. Drow loses a mediocre slow when going for stats. Jugg loses some magic damage on spin. But Naga not skilling ult? Naga loses a 7 second disable in a 1250 radius on a 120s cooldown.   I can understand why top Naga spammers might skip it when playing against much worse enemies (RMM), but assuming you are actually challenged its best to have such an insane strategic ability available to you."
TrueDoTA2,3c9u87,FabulousMrFox,0,Mon Jul 6 13:48:43 2015 UTC,"It's not like anti mage really, anti mage's farming and escape is the same skill, blink. Mana burn is underwhelming until you get Manta and Spell Shield is worse than stats unless you are against a heavy amount of magic burst. I honestly think that 4/0/4/0 only works for those players because they are so good, they are very aware of what is going on and they are much more efficient with illusions pre-radiance. If you slip up for 10 seconds and get caught out with 4/0/4/0 that's going to be an overall loss of 300-500 gold towards your relic."

The point of naga (especially naga mids) is to be greedy. Why pick the hero but play a safe build and have your team sacrifice more farm and space than you already need? Could you perhaps show me a replay where a gank would not have been preventable, that was not caused by being out of position, and that the early 180 second cd song had saved them?  Furthermore, I would actually be very surprised if you lose up to 500 gold at level 8. You were either a very efficient farmer where you somehow did not get exp or this is an exaggeration. I calibrated at 2k and had climbed with naga and a bunch of other heroes. I have gone 4-0-4-1 every game to my mmr today and I think it would be false to say I was always the best player of the games I won with. Besides, I don't mean to flame anyone, but if you don't consider yourself ""very aware"" or ""efficient"" on naga, I think those problems will stem to other heroes as well. It is a very punishing hero for people who don't have a plan."

I think Net is too much value out of one point to skip it, another point in illus early on is not that much of a gamebreaker - but net can be.   I buy stout shield and quelling + regen, then get stick aquila and brown boots and proceed to farm radiance. After that straight travels and RAT THE SHIT OUT OF THEM. Manta next, then octarine core, granting you 100% uptime on illus, ridiculous TP and ult cd, and lifesteal from radiance. Next items are whatever fits vest, diffu/skadi/mkb/bfly etc.  Note that this requires a team with lots of utility and good at fighting from behind, because that's what you will need the first 25 minutes.

Pairing him up with a tanky initiator like Bristleback or Centaur pretty much means you can bully the enemy carry when he does try to go in for last hits. And also ensures that you have a partner that can take advantage of the shield slow.
TrueDoTA2,3c7yy0,icarus-_-sky,1 point,Mon Jul 6 03:43:07 2015 UTC,"Yup, lich + 1 is another great aggro dual setup."
TrueDoTA2,3c7yy0,icarus-_-sky,2,Mon Jul 6 04:07:07 2015 UTC,"It's an odd setup (this is coming from a 2k scrub) but I love running mid (pos2), hard carry and a pos5 support in safelane, and centaur +tusk in the offlane sharing farm. I go lvl 1 bottle with rune as tusk, then once we both hit lvl2, we completely shut down their safelane farm. If their safelaners don't have any escapes, there are no easier kills at lvl2 with snowball stomp shards double edge. That lane is CANCER. We'll usually gank their mid/offlane after a couple kills in our lane, come back and gank their safelane again, and by that point I have SB on tusk and a blink on centaur (he's usually the one that ends up with the kills before I hit 6 with tusk). At this point, the laning stage is over, and I take on pos4 support duties so our pos5 can get some levels and items. It's really one of my favorite lanes to run.  Another potent aggro offlane is brood+dazzle. Brood doesn't normally like a dual lane, but with max damage heal bombs on her spiderings, it's a very dirty lane indeed. Plus, as brood, I can focus on farming instead of dealing with their wards and ganks, which always nets me a quicker orchid/midas/whathaveyou."
TrueDoTA2,3c7yy0,icarus-_-sky,4,Sun Jul 5 19:40:29 2015 UTC,"To the brood point, I think nearly any pressure offlaner like brood doesn't mind having a strong support like dazzle, regardless of particular synergies. Pressure offlaner + 1 in the offlaner will (nearly) always give you a lane that can contest.  That dual lane you mention makes a lot more sense if the cent just takes the farm and tusk runs as a 4 position support. I definitely think that centaur needs a lane partner right now; he just can't pressure trilanes on his own, unless they're very weak, and he can't manage without blink, nor is he particularly good at farming.  With that said, if you give him a strong lane partner, he has the ability to take a lot of punishment and deal a decent amount of damage, and has a good followup stun. So, in principal, if not in execution, I like the tusk cent offlane."
TrueDoTA2,3c7yy0,pepe_le_shoe,1 point,Sun Jul 5 19:53:11 2015 UTC,"The only reason I like to relegate some early farm to tusk is that if he doesn't get those damage items, I find he becomes a pure utility hero late game, rather than being able to one shot supports."
TrueDoTA2,3c7yy0,zimc,3,Sun Jul 5 20:27:38 2015 UTC,But there's nothing wrong with a support being a pure utility hero! That's the beauty of it.  Also centaur aghs is so busted.

TrueDoTA2,3c7yy0,Defiled-,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:09:05 2015 UTC,"Because you can't, is the thing. You're always making trades in dota. While it would be nice to get your tusk some farm, you can't do that at the expense of a centaur's blink timing and get away with it, in most games, and if you do get away with it, that doesn't mean it wasn't wrong, it just means it wasn't wrong enough to cause a loss.  Offlane 3 role tusk is viable, but offlane 4 role centaur is not. The centaur has to be the core in that lane.  With that said, I think it's good to look for opportunities to give farm to supports, and I will often do that in my games, and drafts. For example, if i'm jugger, farming the safelane well, i'll often go MoM before boots, and say ""ok, supports, have some farm, i'm taking the jungle."" This probably slows my own farm down a little, but provides a big boost to team gold, and i'm going to get to what I need soon enough anyway, since i can use the jungle and ancients.  Sometimes it's worth it to farm a support, but there's always a trade. Just make sure you make the right ones."

I honestly think that's stronger than Axe + Dazzle although admittedly a lot more situational for post-laning.   Also, no mention of Lich? He was always the traditional offlane support (denying experience & gold, bringing the creep wave closer to your tower and good harassment)."
TrueDoTA2,3c7yy0,Lazarous86,1 point,Mon Jul 6 10:29:06 2015 UTC,"Lich can dual just fine, but he really is better off solo. He can deny a lot of experience, suck up a lot more when he's alone and hold a tower up for quite a while, since Q is aoe and slows attackspeed of the entire enemy wave.   Lich offlane is an excellent choice when you want to run a core jungler. Would you benefit more from Lich sucking up xp alone and the jungler having that to himself, or a dual lane of both, sharing the xp. With a lot of supports/offlaners, the answer is often dual lane, but Lich's innate ability to deny 1 creep every wave and get xp for it swings a solo outcome a bit more in his favour. As a general case against it, solo offlaners against a push-heavy line-up are bad. Even Lich can't stop Drow+ranged support+Chen from knocking over his tower at 9 minutes in."
TrueDoTA2,3c7yy0,zimc,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:51:26 2015 UTC,I just named 3 setups that are fairly representative; brood + dazzle is absolutely fine. Lich + 1 is also absolutely fine.

Shadow Fiend, as a hero, rewards good mechanics more than just about any other hero in dota. Last hitting, positioning, properly timed an executed map movement, awareness: with the way the hero is built, every one of these things, already important on any hero, become even more so.  If your mechanics are significantly better than those of the people you're playing with, and you play shadow fiend, you will likely stomp. There's no secret technique to it. He can take nearly any set of items and dominate if your mechanics are sound. He can get rolled no matter what set of items you go if your mechanics are unsound."
TrueDoTA2,3c7d21,goblinbiddin,3,Sun Jul 5 19:59:28 2015 UTC,Sounds like the most honest answer here. I do have a suspicion myself that mechanical dominance and MLG raze triple kills might be the key to being a successful SF  Will work on that

Is it better to lead the attack as the main dps carry, or to hang back and apply damage."
TrueDoTA2,3c7d21,TheDrGoo,3,Sun Jul 5 19:15:00 2015 UTC,"One thing to keep in mind is that, as a mid, even if you have the most farm, it's to have a second carry for you to rely on later game. Shadow fiend is an item dependent hero but once he gets there he can do a lot, and just by playing smart and avoiding death you can farm really fast with razes and waveclearing. The key to mid fights is two things, mobility and defense. This can be any combo of items, mobility can be shadow blade which I personally like, and blink, and on defense you can have mek, bkb OR the best defense item, desolator.  Stay out of sight and only cease farming if you feel that if you participate of the fight and turn it around. If these conditions are met, use your mobility and requiem to take the highest priority target, and roll from there. On my guide I used a flowchart I made, check it out.  In shorter words, you are the main dps dealing carry, but you have to avoid being the point of the spear because Shadow Fiend is not the best hero for it. Act as a secondary hero and kill anything that crosses the line."

Without some HP or Armor, you're made of paper. Skadi gives HP and armor. You get a pile of mana to use for razes. Skadi is relevant at all stages of the game.   I'm liking blink/euls SF less and less, but I'm really liking skadi. With bottle, aquila, and treadswitching I never feel too mana starved."
TrueDoTA2,3c7d21,WcP,2,Wed Jul 8 15:34:41 2015 UTC,"Depends on my team situation for me. The Mek + BKB build can be solid if your team is prepared to push down towers together, as you said in your post.   I would experiment in bot matches with each of the builds and find what feels most right for you. Obviously there are some games where a Euls + Blink buildup will reign supreme no matter what, but a lot of games you can go many different ways. Figure out what's most comfortable and perfect that playstyle as best you can.   Personally I'm a Treads -> Blink -> SnY/BKB -> SnY/BKB -> Skadi so on and so forth kind of guy. Blink is incredible for farming as SF and is excellent for positioning in fights.   Obliterate your lane, farm the jungle to get 2-3 levels ahead of opposing mid, countergank with TP and steamroll the game.

Experimenting will net you deaths, but also experience and insight on how far you can go.

TrueDoTA2,3c7d21,demon_eater,1 point,Tue Jul 7 06:56:55 2015 UTC,Mek isn't the best choice because of how much mana it costs to use. It's more of a pro build where the teams are more coordinated and someone is willing to arcane boot the sf when he needs it.
TrueDoTA2,3c7d21,10pack,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:15:27 2015 UTC,"I've been trying out a more right clicking shadow fiend that bulks up a bit more early.  I've been going bottle-boots-Aquila-treads by then you have a decent amount of hp and good armor.  This is a standard starting build pretty much, but then you build utility.  I like building a blink, because of how amazing it is.  Shadow fiend is a positional hero with spells that rely on being in the exact position to do double razes and ultimates mid game. After your one utility item you can bulk.  I first Build a yasha for the movement speed and right click to help move from camp to camp and to build into a manta.  After that I usually build a skadi if I'm winning in fights and have all the farming space in the world.  A special note is bkb can be bought at any point in the game, hell you can rush it if you want to.    Ultimately Skadi is the single best SF item in the game.  It transforms you from a +2 strength gain glass cannon agility hero into basically an over 3 strength gain monster.  You can fight any almost any hero with backup.  You will have more hp than many strength heroes because SF is a farmer.  You can easily get 700 gpm in a good game and you aren't inheritedly weak like an alchemist.  That's what is great about SF, he farms and farms and has decent stat gain to back it up.  Until you have a tanky hero that can obliterate supports and man fight a lot of heroes.      TL DR:  bottle-Aquila-treads-blink-yasha-skadi-bkb-manta- then whatever you want, life steal/butterfly/Crits.

Inner Vitality doesnt cost that much mana, and you shouldnt be using it to farm AT ALL. Husk likes being at low hp to farm, and with lifesteal and armlet toggle you should be fine. If you are somehow casting Inner Vitality that much, you are either tanking waaaaay too much damage from creeps or towers when farming, or you are staying at too high hp for farming.

The way I see it, anything past Euls and mobility items is a waste of farm, as Oracle doesn't use it any better (and probably worse) than any other hero in a core role.   By the way, Euls is absolutely core on this hero. You can get a 1430 magic damage ""combo"" with it (E Euls E Q E). It's better than dagon AND it provides better stats for Oracle (regen!) and utility.  I suppose you can get a veil. But then if you have blink euls veil force, you have 4 2k gold items and nowhere to go from there. Maybe that's the idea, secure the midgame and either win quick or have someone else do the heavy lifting afterward."
TrueDoTA2,3c6be6,BWEM,6,Sun Jul 5 07:49:16 2015 UTC,"Oh man, Coracle was all the rage last patch.  I made to top 50 only playing Oracle mid. I always bought a ward and some iron branches, and placed the ward on their high-ground so I could see up their hill and also see the runespot.  This meant I could constantly see them and therefore cast Edict one them whenever they went for a last hit.  I went bottle into boots into straight euls. Euls <10 minutes, then you just go and roam and kill on every lane.   For 6.84 I'd suggest Solar Crest after Eul's. You can take Roshan with just one partner as soon as you have levels in your Edict."
TrueDoTA2,3c6be6,EDJE,5,Sun Jul 5 12:22:49 2015 UTC,"There's a lot to talk about with Oracle mid, but I'll focus on how strong he can be at preventing the enemy from getting CS.   Fate's Edict   A 3s disarm on a 12s CD for 50 mana is entirely balanced. /s...Seriously though, this skill is spammable and crippling.  You can get the most out of it by launching an autoattack and Edicting before the projectile hits.   Edicting creeps can be useful. Sometimes you can keep an enemy nuking hero from getting a CS by Edicting the creep when they would want to nuke. You can also use the Edict just for damage amp to allow you to get the last hit/deny. You can get a bit of lane control out of Edict by using it on a melee creep so it dies faster or a ranged creep so it doesn't attack.   Fortune's End   This is a bit more iffy, but you can zone the enemy away from the creepwave simply by channeling End on them a bit before they want to go for a last hit. If they move away from the wave, just Flames then when they are on the edge of the range. If they stay, it sets up for a set of 3 Flames in addition to End (345/615/885/1155 magic damage at 1/2/3/4 level Flames) in addition to a bunch of right clicks. This is a kill if they are under ~260/430/600/770 HP.   Purifying Flames   This is where it gets real.  Flames is ridiculously good for denying. When the creep is at ~130 or less HP you can autoattack it and Flames it right before the missile hits for an easy deny. You need to around 400 units away from the creep so you have time to cast Flames. Theoretically only needs to be 270 units (900 units/sec missile speed and 0.3s cast animation) so the faster your reactions/fingers the closer to that you can be.  The other great thing about Flames and denying is that with more levels in it you can start denying your creeps from full HP, potentially before they even reach lane. Two casts with rank 2 flames (one with rank 3 or 4) and an autoattack denies the ranged creep, two casts of rank 3+ Flames and an autoattack does the same to a melee one.  If the enemy is full or nearly full HP, you can actually zone them out by using Flames on them. If they stick around for 3s, they leave themselves open to getting hit by End+Flames which takes off the first Flames heal too."

TrueDoTA2,3c6be6,punriffer5,1 point,Sun Jul 5 20:26:34 2015 UTC,"Can you deny a ranged creep with 2 casts of lvl1 flames? The key is getting/keeping the creep at <150hp. (starting 300)    2 casts = 180, Healing between casts at 11 per second.  So healing will be floor(2.5+.3 - initial animation travel time + second animation travel time)*11.   If you can get an auto attack off before the 3rd healing tick you should be able to continue to attack and deny it. Auto attack damage will be greater then the heal.   Will have to try later if no one has an answer. I think the key is casting the first one at max range(maybe standing to the side of the path), and the second blast at point blank cast range.   Was going to say you could kill multiple creeps, but without another ability you can't kill a melee creep at lvl1.  (2 branches) 50 damage, 1.4 BA, 15+2AS. At 2nd cast + first auto attack you've done 180 + 50, 3 ticks have been healed. so 230-33. 3 more attacks over 1.15/1.4 = 3.3 seconds, 150 more damage - 3 or 4 ticks = dead ranged unit.   Melee creep = 550HP, (90 - 22)*x = 550 = 4.04 So that sucks, you can't kill a melee creep, killing ranged seems doable though."
TrueDoTA2,3c6be6,Carnot_AoR,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:12:45 2015 UTC,"You could eventually do it if you can sit and auto the creep for ~8s, but that's not realistic. Auto is greater than the heal, but not by much (~18 net damage/sec) with just Oracle. Perhaps together with another hero or two attacking the creep with you...then you could deny the ranged creep realistically from level one. But I don't think its practical."
TrueDoTA2,3c6be6,punriffer5,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:27:14 2015 UTC,"Did i math wrong? I think you do 50 damage * 1.17 / 1.4 BAT so 41 dps, less 11 heal per second.   Edit: I did my math wrong!!! The heal is not replaced, it stacks. Makes it so you need 5 attacks or 4 with a null talisman. Still readily doable as you're walking all the way from base to lane, You don't get to the pull until ~18 seconds  1/(1.1y/1.4) = 1.196 seconds per attack, .3 swing before attack, i didn't add in an attack animation time, but it would just push all of the attacks back by like .1 or .2, won't overlap a heal at any point.   0: PF1 - 210HP 1.0: heal - 221HP 2.0: heal - 232HP 2.5: PF2 hits - 142HP 2.8: Atk hits - 92HP 3.0: heal - 103HP 3.5: heal - 114HP 4.0: Atk hits - 64HP 4.0: heal - 75HP 4.5: heal - 86HP 4.9: Atk hits - 36HP 5.0: heal - 47HP 5.5: heal - 58HP 6.0: heal - 69HP 6.1: Atk hits, 19HP 6.5: heal - 30HP 7.3: Atk hits, -20HP, dead.    Err, too lazy to adjust numbers, add in .5 heal/sec, so 3 more hp at 6.1(4th) atk, 22hp.  5 attacks to kill at 0-6 bonus damage. 4 attacks if you have +7 damage(on average hits)  So 5 attacks should do it, 4 if you have a null tallisman or other aggressive items."

TrueDoTA2,3c6xrv,odedbe,5,Sun Jul 5 12:55:55 2015 UTC,"Maybe a couple of possible reasons, you don't want to pull camp @ 45 because then it won't respawn until the following minute. So maybe stacking or harassing untill :15 is better.  You might be further away from your carry leaving him vulnerable for a short time.   Pros aren't perfect but they've improved so much in the last few years. Still there are always more efficient ways to do things."
TrueDoTA2,3c6xrv,FirstAidKoolAid,3,Sun Jul 5 19:00:15 2015 UTC,Probably because you'd lose exp and last hits
TrueDoTA2,3c6xrv,eskaolin,2,Sun Jul 5 13:11:20 2015 UTC,looks like a case of you miss out on the experience and gold. not to mention if you dont have the camp double stacked you miss the pull through. net worth wise it isnt worth it to waste a pull for one stack either i would say. the experience and gold you get from pulling is going to help more then a stack that the carry might take.
TrueDoTA2,3c6xrv,-Number5,1 point,Sun Jul 5 13:15:18 2015 UTC,"but in most cases you don't miss the pull through or the experience. You'll lose last hits though, but is that really worth more than a hard camp stack?"
TrueDoTA2,3c6xrv,-Number5,1 point,Sun Jul 5 13:23:34 2015 UTC,if you watch the video the guy misses out on two creeps worth of experience and all the other small camps will be similar stories(and theres no way if he attempted to get a pull through in time). you have to remember that the support needs to find something from the map aswell. why waste a pull for a stack you can do a minute later.
TrueDoTA2,3c6xrv,AJZullu,1 point,Sun Jul 5 13:38:38 2015 UTC,That's because we went left instead of right. If he went right he wouldn't have missed the exp or the pull through.
TrueDoTA2,3c6xrv,AJZullu,1 point,Sun Jul 5 13:48:38 2015 UTC,"THERE ARE Gmaes where the support will stack for their team's carry, but not EVERY game cause they are missing out of exp. which will lead to lost of map control cause they cant do early team fights...( they would stack for heros like. SF, or lesh. (but honestly a mid hero COULD go stack for themselves and not rely on their supports to do it)   2nd thing that i dont understand is the (domnator item) where the carry can just easily stack a large / ancient camp every minute.   but the MAIN MAIN problem for this is that the farm could be stolen by the enemy team and if they find the stack and kill it, that is a large gold/exp swing. sometimes is not worth the risk...if you lose a team fight then the enemy team has all the time in the world to kill it.   so its just better to be fast (blink, SnY) and go jungle to jungle killing creeps, then pushing the lane up to tower..then go back in to jungle killing all the camps."
TrueDoTA2,3c6xrv,AJZullu,1 point,Sun Jul 5 16:23:26 2015 UTC,"... I meant the specific Pull + Stack combo in radiant safelane, not just normal stacking. There are plenty of games where pulls are made, and stacks are made, but the Pull + Stack combo isn't."
TrueDoTA2,3c6xrv,AJZullu,1 point,Sun Jul 5 16:34:35 2015 UTC,"OHH, in that case, it depends on the offlaner cause when you pull the enemy lane will push and that allows the enemey to take advantage to tower dive (while the supports are farming the jungle creeps) OR even go to the jungle (with the ward they might place there) to farm the jungle creeps instead...  but MOST of the time, you would want to pull the creeps (not stack the small jungle creeps) but double pull OR triple pull the creeps to the other two larger camps in radiant jungle. dire you can only do double pull.  you could find those pulls on youtube, most likely on PURGE channel.   if you are playing and someone is pulling and you are carry then you should auto attack the lane to push it more, so you dont have to last hit under tower which becomes difficult even for pro players.   but supports DONT pull all the time because its the carry's duty to not push the lanes, then supports can zone off the offlaner and push the offlaner away from EXP range. (thats why there are trilanes) etc make sure 100% that the main carry gets to last hit all of the creeps."
TrueDoTA2,3c6xrv,AJZullu,1 point,Sun Jul 5 18:09:36 2015 UTC,"You can do it with a pull through, so the lane doesn't push. I know how pulls go, but I wonder why they don't do the Pull + Stack combo in pro games when it doesn't cost anything (Maybe 10 secs in lane) and allows for a free stack."
TrueDoTA2,3c6xrv,goblinbiddin,2,Sun Jul 5 19:10:16 2015 UTC,"no one does a pull through and leave it there, most support would want to stick around to get the last hits on those jungle creeps  and that takes 30 secs - 1 mins.   with the enemy creeps pushing in, the enemy offlaner depending on who it is, can dive and get a kill, 2, your carry have to tank the creeps getting low OR have a harder time last hitting under tower. (its hard no matter what skill lvl you are)   or the offlaner might come over and get more farm. or EXP. by going to the jungle and taking it, or disrupting the pull.  or get in to exp range of the next creep wave since the supports are not around to zone the offlaner out.   OK OK..they DO pull through, ONLY IF their safelane carry is the type of hero that is strong enough to hold its own alone. IF it is a HARD HARD carry that needs the space then the supports would most likely not pull through and spend most of their time zoning the offlaner away from exp range.  EXAMPLES would be gyro with 3rd skill to zone the offlaner away and push the creep wave then the support is pulling through at the moment.   a hard carry hero that couldnt hold its own could be , medusa, spectre (how HP), alchmist, slark, (both having bad stats, and SHIT in general until lvl 6)   just because something is good, does not mean it should be done every game. because if you pull through you are sacrificing something else that you could be doing...  ALSO something to keep in mind is that the support in the safe lane after a few lvls (when they are in lane not pulling) would smoke go mid to gank.. so THATS another reason for you. also, having the supports closer to lane also protect the safe lane carry from ganks.   YES, the small camp and the pull through large camps are too far from the lane for the support (no boots) to come help protect their carry."

TrueDoTA2,3c64u8,loveisdead,2,Sun Jul 5 05:54:22 2015 UTC,"The only reason you want to trade hits solo offlane is to get last hits/experience. Its extremely rare that you'll ever be able to gain lane dominance. You also need to have some form of regen on your hero to trade. You'll always lose solo offlane if you are trading hits with the support just for the sake of trading. Unless you manage to significantly outlevel your opponents, just get as much xp/gold as you can without dying.  Also you should phase shift all incoming damage possible to avoid. Puck cannot take hits, especially if not relying on bottle regen from mid lane."

TrueDoTA2,3c64u8,BBRodriguezzz,4,Mon Jul 6 02:36:16 2015 UTC,"I'd wager that whether trading hits is worth it comes down to a few factors:   Who has more armor, Who has more damage, Who has more regen (if, for example, you brought two sets of tangos into the lane, usually you can just go wild), If you approach the lane, can you get stunned and killed?   Or, to sum it up, if you can't deal extensive damage to your opponent's health/wallet and/or you can just CS from a distance, don't bother. In case of Puck you can be a bit more aggressive for the reasons you mentioned, but still, if the CS you can get with Orb is worth more than slight annoyance to that Witch Doctor, then just take the CS."

TrueDoTA2,3c5hx6,Fitzsimmons,2,Sun Jul 5 05:47:53 2015 UTC,"It depends on what camp you are trying to stack. Some camps are difficult to stack with the standard methods.  Off the top of my head, radiant hard camp (with magic bush) shud be pulled to the left at x.53 instead of downwards due to the weird spawnbox. The radiant medium camp near mid lane can only be pulled at x.55.  For dire camps, you can just do the standard pulls. One thing I noted while playing on fire safe lane is to control the lane with not just the small pull camp, but you can eat a tree and drag the creeps at x.53 towards the safe lane at a diagonal angle to deny the entire wave. Combining this with pull throughs you have quite a few ways to control your lane."

TrueDoTA2,3c5hx6,Dirst,1 point,Sun Jul 5 02:46:55 2015 UTC,"Yea but usually this can only be done if your trilane is strong or your offlaner is weak because it is very easy to contest the hard camp, although it is a good source of extra income and exp for the supports. Also if u pull it at x.53 you can stack the hard camp and pull creeps into at the same time, so more exp, denies and ££ for gold starved supps!    I've yet to found an effective way to pull the radiant safe lane if it is blocked and I can't find the ward tho, cause it is so reliant on the small camp for pull throughs.

TrueDoTA2,3c5c2v,tkalamov,5,Sat Jul 4 23:07:16 2015 UTC,"I played quite a bit of Silencer support (in my delicious trash tier) which means I land up playing him position 5 more often than position 4.  With the changes to Last Word he is slightly better at ganking and slightly worse in teamfights.   Situationally Strong: Against Phoenix, Storm, Lina, Void (if you have quick fingers), Lesh (earlyish) and other caster heavy teamfight lineups.  Situationally Awful: Silencer has no native escape or movement capability and gets MURDERED by Riki/Bounty/Slark and has trouble against heroes like Pudge etc. Heavily tanky right clicking lineups that don't rely on spell based initiation or combos is not great either. A PA for example will do very bad things to you.  How you build him is VERY situational which is one of the things that makes him fun to play.  Skill builds vary by game - some game you need to be a lane boss asshole and go curse of the silent and glaives and just orb them all day long. Or abuse Last Word against certain heroes, storm, phoenix are good examples.  Roaming: This is tough, Silencer is not a great babysitter, he has mediocre tools to support a carry in lane and you will get severely punished against strong offlanes and some dual lanes. Bane + Undying or an Axe + Dazzle or something will mean that you will probably have to trilane to secure your carry farm.  If you can't be useful in lane then get 2 points in last word and 2 points in glaives and once you have brown boots and a null talisman go try gank mid or other lanes on your way to 6. Or stack/pull or just stack ancients, med/hard camps if you cannot be more useful. Those add up and maybe you can hang around to get the AOE XP when the camps are farmed.  Items: Personally I always get Powertreads on Silencer, mid/late game your right clicks add up so more of them is good!  If you are in FULL support mode, ie really struggling to be involved in teamfights and get that delicious intelligence from kills/assists then consider going full utility, glimmer cape etc.  I usually go into force staff after treads for some mobilty and more int. If I feel that their heroes are the ""run at you"" variety or we need some ""catch"" I then go into a Rod of Atos for tankiness and a LOT of DPS - if our team is looking to need more damage. Otherwise I look to see if we are planning on going late and start working on the Refresher. A lot of fights are just lost if you can Global -> refresher -> Global with good timing.  Against hard right clickers I try build a Shivas.  Treads + Force + Atos + Shivas = A LOT of right click damage and utility if it goes ULTRA late by a Scythe.  I have build AC once! Because nobody was going to and I couldn't see how we would break base without it.  There is almost no reason to buy an Aghs on Silencer ever.. you are not that guy. Just don't do it.  If for some reason you find yourself getting some early kills with a chance to snowball, I would consider a Midas after treads then shadowblade and from there into the usual. If this happens you can convert your early lead into a late game advantage. High AS + some stolen int + glaives + steady level gain = success  Don't forget Silencer has some of the highest Agi gain in Dota. He is one of only 8 heroes that get 3 or more Agi/Level.

Curse/Last Word just destroys him since he has no way to easily cast spells and he will be completely forced out of lane by Silencer early game. I've had several games versus a dual agro offlane involving Pudge where we won by so much he wasn't even able to cast a hook by the end of it (bonus points for making a few ragequit because I followed them when they tried rotating lanes). You can also ult when he is munching your carry to (hopefully) save them, although given your CD it might be a waste."

Broxy in particular usually does really well (I think 60% winrate with Pudge + Techies, even when not stacking), although he's pretty obnoxious with the flaming, etc. While a significantly smaller portion I've also seen Pudge + Wisp lanes have great success, but part of that might be meditated on the fact those 2 players always party queue up as a 2-stack."
TrueDoTA2,3c5c2v,Ailodierap,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:30:24 2015 UTC,"Pudge + Techies is a high risk, medium reward strategy. When it works it owns. And makes farming that lane extremely high risk. On the other hand, it means people know where the Techies is! Also Tusk + Techies is just strictly better as the success rate for snowball+suicide is higher than hook into mines. It just seems a waste as a roaming Pudge (after level 4/5/6) and a missing Techies would create so much space. You are scared to go down ramps and you eat through support gold for sentries. Which are high risk to place because there is a Pudge somewhere.  If I was the support in the Pudge+Techies game I would be glad to know where they are and get stuff done on the map."
TrueDoTA2,3c5c2v,greenhatman99,4,Tue Jul 7 00:35:50 2015 UTC,"Silencer is good as a zoning support against solo or passive offlaners, but he's total trash against aggressive duo/tri offlanes since he has no defenses or ways to save his carry. He's also generally bad as a solo support since he has no true disables and even his global can be ineffectual if used incorrectly. He lacks any true core item buildup as a support, which can be nice since you can just buy whatever utility item fits the game (glimmer, force, euls, ghost scepter, mek, etc), but it also means you don't have any sort of power spike on getting a blink like other supports (lion, earthshaker, etc)."

We give up, screw this, cyka blyat, then in the next game someone else's raging, not us, we wonder why still haven't we players understood this anger goes nowhere, is a wasted energy."
TrueDoTA2,3by2kt,borland66,3,Fri Jul 3 13:10:26 2015 UTC,"""How can I possibly mantain my composure"" is an excuse.    I am not a professional negotiator. I am a regular human trying to play a game. I will do my best to stay calm, positive and generally contribute something of value to the team.  However, self-absorbed motherfuckers will not listen to reason. Narcissiac personalities can get nothing but a stern reprimand, if they start whining and complaining.  I refuse, out of principle, to bow down to idiocy and entitlement. Most of the time that means muting, but if I need to do it I will lash out.   some people may eventually see they're the ones causing havoc   That's a pipe dream. A nice one, sure, but a pipe dream nonetheless."
TrueDoTA2,3by2kt,warrentheape,2,Fri Jul 3 21:45:03 2015 UTC,"What you're doing there is, IMO, another set of excuses, and I understand that, because we all do that. I do that, my uncle does that, my mom does that, Justin Bieber does and most likely Jesus or put any other mystic you desire here did as well. I haven't seen one human who hasn't been doing that.  However, we needn't be ""professionals"" or ""experts"" in something in order to improve ourselves. Its 21st century myth that we've all been taught since early age, that we need to be excused and let the ""experts"" and ""professionals"" do the thinking for us.   If that sounds like a pipe dream to you, it's fine. What I'm saying is not a theory, it's not an intellectual game I want to play, it's truth.  And I'm not a hippie. ;)    but if I need to do it I will lash out. That's what the other flamers said in their minds when they started raging on me!    I agree with you on one point though: don't block these emotions, that doesn't help either. What helped me was observing anger when it happens. Eventually as I watched it every time it occured, it became easier and easier not to react to it, as in: not rage/flame ingame, just feel anger, and not react. I found myself wasting less time, and acting (actually focusing on the game and what can be done, then doing it), instead of reacting (focusing on my anger, thinking what should have been done, flaming others etc.).  I hope that's helpful."

TrueDoTA2,3by2kt,DownvoteDogUpvoteCat,3,Fri Jul 3 20:27:06 2015 UTC,"The thing to remember is to take one game at a time. Stay calm, don't take it out on your teammates even if they do play poorly. Ignore their mistakes and focus on your own plays. Optionally offer advice, but don't be pushy. One other thing I find helpful is to totally dissociate the hero with the person playing it, so it's much easier to look past their bad plays and the lingering thought of ""what's this guy thinking right now??"" and just continue doing whatever you're doing.  Afterwards, you can open up the chat and tell your friend ""just had a fucking retard on my team OH MY GOD they did x and messed up y etc etc."" Just vent if that helps out because you shouldn't bring that rage into your next game. The #1 thing I see my boyfriend doing is raging at X hero in one game, and seeing the same hero in the next and automatically assuming this person will fail as well."

TrueDoTA2,3by2kt,TheDaltonXP,3,Fri Jul 3 17:03:43 2015 UTC,"I think you've missed a key loser of games in many brackets.     I understand that you're discussing strategic looks here, but I think execution is a significant factor in the normal skill bracket at minimum.  Leaving aside the question of properly identifying opportunities in the first place, mechanical skill is a key factor to advancing, at minimum until 3-3.5k based on what I've read in the different Dota forums.     Essentially: having proper identified an opportunity to, say, get a free kill, one has to subsequently ""push the right buttons"" in order to actually make it happen... and many's the time where a shift queued blink-skill-move-skill has turned in to a failed gank or a turnaround due simply to failed mechanics. Mathematically the correct decision was made, but the outcome fails nonetheless.     In short the raw twitch-based skill needed to perform is a key factor in advancing up to a certain point (and may in fact even be MORE important than the strategic factors you list.)     With all of that said; great post."

Play a defensive safelane that allows your carry to farm. Hope they have a jungler and run a solo offlane. Play game. Contest their carry's farm. Roam into their jungle. Get the bottom rune. Tell your mid to get the top rune. If you picked right, a support pulling a camp = kill. A jungler on 50% hp = kill. Your carry gets a 2v1 lane, defensive support and free farm. Their carry does not. Their already underfarmed jungler does not.   You just increased your win chance by 20% right there.  Stop giving away piss easy safelanes to enemy carries because jungling is easy. Jungling is slow and makes your team play 4v5. If your carry is against a dual offlane and theirs is not you are straight up handicapping your own team by a significant amount. ""The pros can do it"" is NOT a good enough excuse.  I'm 4.8k mmr solo, 4.1k (RL friends lel) party. Contesting the offlane is the fastest way to make the enemy team bitch in allchat about how shit their carry is and give up all hope. 20% of games will result in one/more of them afking when they see an antimage with half a battlefury and brown boots at 20 minutes and a jungler with a midas and boots at 25. Will this work every game? No. Will it work perfectly every game? No. Will it make a difference every game? Yes.  I'll allow an exception for 3 junglers. Chen, Enchantress and Enigma. Enigma is a FAST jungler. One creep of big camps dies instantly and you get a major dps boost for it. He's fine. Enchantress is too squishy to lane and needs 6 + some items. Chen is the same, except he should be leaving the jungle early to push a lane."

I feel like a change in magic resistance doesn't really matter. Usually the player completely outlives the magic burst (Nec ult, Lina ult) or gets crushed anyway. The actual amount of magic resistance it provides usually doesn't matter, and wouldn't so long as it's 30%+."
TrueDoTA2,3c1gvo,TrenchLordKaede,1 point,Sat Jul 4 03:33:54 2015 UTC,200 range seems a bit too hard of a nerf. that's only slightly longer than dragon knight stun range.   I think either jack up the cooldown or the mana cost some more. make it hard to use it 3+ times in a single fight.

You can play heroes you already know how to play to improve these things, since a lot of them are general mechanics things rather than knowing how to play a hero. Things like learning how to farm more quickly, and getting better at last hitting will definitely improve your play, since you'll end up getting a lot more farm than people who don't have these skills."
TrueDoTA2,3byu75,Lueron_,5,Fri Jul 3 07:27:14 2015 UTC,"Just to add to this as I fully agree - I think everyone will also agree with the idea that someone who has practised say, their Chen creep micro skills in low pressure bot games perform much better in their first 'real' games than those who just decided to learn in games right away."
TrueDoTA2,3byu75,Defiled-,11,Fri Jul 3 12:50:46 2015 UTC,"Bot games are great as long as you're not above 4k MMR, and you aren't abusing the bot's weaknesses.  A little anecdote: when I first started playing Dota, I would always have match anxiety. As a result, I very rarely played a real game, but instead played bot games all day. I now have like 700 hours of bot games. When I felt like I've played enough and got decent at the game through playing bot games(I was playing against Hard Bots at that point), I started playing real games. I found that the real games weren't that hard at all, especially since I knew most of the heroes fairly well from playing bot games. I calibrated and got 3.2k MMR, just from playing bot games. I'm still at 3.2k because I never play Ranked, but my unranked hidden MMR has improved from playing real games now.  I'll list some pros and cons:  Pros   No pressure environment(try different heroes, different builds) Good if you can't commit to a full game(have 30 mins? Play a bot game) Lets you learn different heroes and practice a lot of mechanics(like microing or camp pulling) OK re-creation of pub games below 3k. In the sense that you can't rely on your teammates so you learn to carry on your own. Plus bots almost always target you, so in real games you might die less. Simply, the more you play, the better your feel for the game   Cons   Bots are stupid. You can abuse their AI to an extent Bots like to 5 man push mid at like 10 mins every game, no much variation there You can't practice certain heroes/roles very well. For example, you want to play offlane? Not a chance. Bots always go 2 1 2 lanes. The best role to practice is mid, with support being the worst IMO. As the difficulty increases, its not so much the enemy getting better, but your teammates becoming more stupid. 5 man pushing down your Tier 3s? They'll go farm the jungle. Bots cheat(especially in Unfair). They have unlimited TPs with no cooldowns. There are some games where you just won't win. If you play vs. a Luna, CK, Viper, Bristle, Jakiro lineup, its like 99.999% guaranteed you'll lose. Your teammates don't know how to play against them, and you can't solo 1v5.   All told, Bot games are great for practice IMO, and learning the game. Just don't fool yourself into thinking you're great when you abuse bot AI. The best would be to supplement your bot games with watching pro games to see actually understand the game more."
TrueDoTA2,3byu75,OverweightPlatypus,3,Fri Jul 3 18:25:52 2015 UTC,"This is a pretty good rundown. I haven't played bot matches in a while but I think it's a perfect place to try to execute more difficult strategies.  How split pushing works is ridiculously relevant in bot games since they will always tp back to their towers. Any bot game should be won by just split pushing.  Team fight heroes are also exceptionally relevant as well since bots don't really dilly dally and farm neutrals often and just push or defend.  Bots don't really execute like humans, since they do some things perfectly and other things completely backwards, but humans are similar as well. Many pub players don't deal well with split pushing heroes to a greater extent than bots, often times not tping back at all or feeding kills to a split pushing carry as supports.  Winning bot games isn't important or the reason they exist but rather just to practice execution of difficult things, such as snowballing with skill shot oriented heroes like pudge and puck. The more active a hero is meant to be, the better suited it is to bot matches.  Heroes like omniknight and shadow demon are particularly team reliant heroes and while applicable to bot matches, your execution will only do so much since bots don't really respect your defensive and offensive capabilities."
TrueDoTA2,3byu75,thadpole,5,Fri Jul 3 20:20:05 2015 UTC,"One thing no one seems to have mentioned is how fast bots are at blowing your ass up if you put yourself in a bad position.  It's true that bots are very predictable but that doesn't mean they can't teach you useful things about the game.  If you are split pushing and all bots are missing, guess what?  They're coming to get you, especially if you're near their tower, and it's guaranteed to be their whole team.   For practical purposes this can teach you not to be too greedy when split pushing because the bots WILL kill you if you stay too long.  They can also teach you how to use BKB better.  Like I said, bots will straight kill your ass if you give them half a chance.  They are more coordinated with stuns and focus fire than anyone that I've ever met in pubs.  So if you are teamfighting you get into the habit of either hanging back until initiation, or if you are the carry, buying BKB, using it at the proper time, and getting safe before it wears off.  I still play a lot of bot matches, I like the All Hero Challenge, and as I go through it I almost always play a few bot matches with the next in line.  Sometimes it's not fun - certain heroes are at a severe disadvantage against bots because they NEED to stand and fight, even without BKB but you get no support from your idiot teammates.  And often you are left solo defending because your botmates threw themselves under the T4s or whatever.  I still have fun with it sometimes."
TrueDoTA2,3byu75,nice_guy_threeve,3,Fri Jul 3 21:56:24 2015 UTC,They are more coordinated with stuns and focus fire than anyone that I've ever met in pubs.   They are literally perfect at chaining stuns: as in not one millisecond of overlap or unstunned time.
TrueDoTA2,3byu75,brinebold,4,Sat Jul 4 00:44:02 2015 UTC,"I think anyone under 4k, unfair bots will be a great practice to some degree. Although bots are quite easy, bots are quite good at last hitting and pushing off advantages. However if you are above that skill level I think bots are just going to disrupt your feeling of the game."
TrueDoTA2,3byu75,4ll1s0n,2,Fri Jul 3 09:21:34 2015 UTC,"I played bots for my first about few hundred hours with friends. The benefit is you can still fool around and joke with friends and practice and get out at any time.  It teaches you to not trust your allies, aka bots, as they will do things that are irrational and follow a very specific starting items and skill build which are mostly weak. You learn to farm when your allies are boned anyways. And learn to defend your allies or even itemize for the early fights to cover allies with mek or force staff.   It teaches you about dual vs dual lanes and who has the advntage with things like orb walking, right clicks, and general spell strength.  Practice playing side lanes more. I can't really advocate practicing mid because the enemy bots don't play super well. They last hit better than you, but they can't measure kill threshold at all and don't back away from good creep aggro+harass.  There are also certain heroes that bots don't understand like undying tombstone and shadow demon shadow poison. So don't practice those heroes more than once or twice because it will give you the wrong fell for the hero's strength."
TrueDoTA2,3byu75,wildtarget13,2,Fri Jul 3 18:39:36 2015 UTC,FWIW: I don';t think pubs understand SD shadow poison either. Last night I was playing in a mid 3k ranked party game. I managed to get max stacks on a sven and make him pop like a balloon.  I love Shadow Demon.
TrueDoTA2,3byu75,gu3st12,2,Fri Jul 3 19:32:10 2015 UTC,"Bots also have a very rudimentary understanding of minions, so certain Heroes like Beastmaster and Chen can really confuse them.  Beastmaster mid is a pretty good way to rape the bots, except against Shadowfiend because of his perfect Razes on your pig."
TrueDoTA2,3byu75,nice_guy_threeve,2,Fri Jul 3 21:58:27 2015 UTC,"I play bot games regularly as a supplement to pubs. I mostly use them to try out new builds or practice mechanics, e.g. get 30 last hits at 5 minutes with X, get a Blink by 9 minutes with X, etc. I think if you take Dota seriously it's a good way to expand your skill with no pressure. It has limits to what it can improve though, especially because some things are so unrealistic in bot games (stupidly good coordination but no rune control, for example)."
TrueDoTA2,3byu75,freelance_fox,2,Fri Jul 3 19:58:27 2015 UTC,"on Hard and Unfair, bots are good at   reacting quickly; you can't jump in and leave BKB for a second like you might in a game, you will get stunned. chain stunning. It's pretty easy to avoid the bots but if they catch you, they will not let you live. even things like jakiro ice path and light strike array they can chain very well.  the 5 man bot team will coordinate and play better than your 4 bot allies.  they are usually good at last hitting and denying   so imo bots are good for practicing basic 1v1 laning against (they aren't good at getting solo kills or knowing when to push the wave etc.) and if you want to practice a ""1v9"" type hero like rat heroes. I practiced radiance naga a lot vs bots because cutting creep waves and farming a lot is basically the only way to take the game late against them unless you have a monster teamfighter like Sven or Spectre; I even had to go full rat mode as tidehunter once, just pushing creep waves with shiva's guard and anchor smash and spamming necro books and manta styles to get chip damage on buildings.   They are pretty awful at ganking lanes or assisting in your ganks. You can ping an enemy hero and they will often go in, but they literally just walk. Heroes like WK and Sven will not throw their stun until they have right clicked at least once, and as soon as they start running in to attack the other bots will immediately turn and run.  basically they are only good for practicing Ultimate Rat DX and farming.  also it takes about 5-10 minutes less time to set up a bot game and you can pause to go do whatever you want."
TrueDoTA2,3byu75,TrenchLordKaede,1 point,Sat Jul 4 16:14:56 2015 UTC,"i think its a good way to practice last hitting or a new hero you want to play ( i practiced meepo for 3 games, how to farm and how to blink poof, then played a REAL game unranked and won because i learned how to tab around the meepos and how to use quick cast)  but i think you shouldnt bother with medium difficulty, depending on your mmr as well. but im 2.9k mmr and i just got hard. and even hard gets easy once i pass the early game.. so maybe should challenge yourself in unfair and just do your best to be active.   bot games are good just to practice last hitting , and you just do 10minutes. once 10mins is up, see you cs score and go start again. and practice that way. you save time and dont need to bother other ppl's time. also you get a game faster as well  bot games are also a good way to experiment with new items/builds."
TrueDoTA2,3by82q,sebby03,4,Fri Jul 3 03:31:23 2015 UTC,"I think the hero is just awful in general and not particularly suited for this meta. Like Alchemist. I played him as a 4 position once and found that no amount of explaining to teammates how to utilize my reset tool with Stomp could get them to stop waking up enemies. If you're playing with a coordinated stack and you need reset, something a la Naga but more teamfight oriented, then I think Elder Titan is your man (as a support). I have no idea, even with the strength of his aura, why you'd pick him as a core right now. His damage scales... okay, but his utility just isn't that great and he's hard to play. Unrewarding, generally.  Feel free to contradict me with some supporting evidence, but even heroes that ET somewhat ""counters"" like Morphling wouldn't be enough for me to pick ET right now, as a captain."
TrueDoTA2,3by82q,freelance_fox,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:48:50 2015 UTC,"Gets quite a bit from the off lane, and with supporting help can get kills on the enemy tri due to the insane damage from hitting multiple heroes with a quick 4 points in W and a fair few in the passive and just punching away with the stuns of allies.  TL;DR, Soak levels, get good gold from lane creeps due to long range farming tool, get support rotations to partner with stomp, multi-hero damage buff with W, stun from allies, punch people to death.  EDIT: Feel I should mention his ult is slightly weak and could use a small buff, however with good setup it can be really strong - might try wyvern and ET as a combo as curse is great setup and arctic burn can slow to allow ET to punch people in ganks, additionally wyvern heal is % based and ET had pretty high hp and builds str items."

I don't understand how I should be playing with elder titan, I usually reside on doing magical damage all the time with my stun and ulti, and die by the time I can do physical damage, because Im concentrated on.  I can see how the armor and magic resistance ability can turn fights into massacres, but I can not avoid dying most of the time, its a durable hero and all but I think I'm playing him wrong. I usually just run right into the enemy to initiate (unless I have a blink), then I would use the stun, and after that my ulti (different order at different times). I also use spirit in team fights, the spirit is hard to use and it breaks my full attention, I find it hard to use in laning phase also, do you have any tips on the spirit usage? And any other item ideas or anything that would actually keep me alive in a fight."
TrueDoTA2,3by82q,caesar121,3,Fri Jul 3 05:06:08 2015 UTC,"I think the best way to play ET in teamfights is to play him like a hybrid of WD and earthshaker. Try not to dive in teamfights and stand behind your team. Look for the correct time to send out your spirit, stun and ulti. Once you're combo is out, you're team should be already going in. Follow them, bring back your spirit for the extra damage and crush your foes. Your opponents will not be focusing you, but try not to waste your tackiness make yourself tank some damage up. By all means do not die, your aura is valuable. If you are the only tanker in the team, build more tanky items like bkb, drums or lotus orb. You should also communicate with your team well. Tell them when to go in and when not to.   When not teamfighting, try to scout for enemies with your spirit often. Being able to see your enemies movements allows you to predict what is going to happen in the next few minutes. Manage your mana properly, make sure you have enough mana for the whole combo if a fight erupts. Also when you're teammates are fighting but you're too far away, send out your spirit. It also carries the aura.   In lane and sometimes scouting, I usually send out my spirit and control it to follow my enemy. Just left click your spirit and right click you're enemy. Usually when there's 2 enemies I try to make sure I cast spirit on the first while also landing a last hit then sending my spirit to the second enemy. Sometimes your spirit stops following when the enemy enters the fog of war. Then just manually send the spirit to scout.   ET is a team fighting hero. So stick with your team and try to take towers, force the enemy to fight you as a team. Of course don't stick with them 24/7 and leech experience. Find the balance between farming, scouting and teamfighting."

TrueDoTA2,3by82q,Ah-Bin,1 point,Fri Jul 3 06:47:26 2015 UTC,"The normal et combo is spirit, stun and ultimate. However, the strength of et is to weaken opponents with its aura. Using the combo, shorten the usage of your spirit and you can't capitalise the aura together with the dmg of your ultimate. I hope he gets a buff I love him!"
TrueDoTA2,3by82q,Ailodierap,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:17:43 2015 UTC,"He's pretty useless with his recent nerfs. Situationally he can be useful in a heavy magic burst line-up (think x4 magic nukers), but those are pretty rare in this meta due to the release/popularity of Glimmer Cape. I would only draft him now if the opponent went for high agi picks, like Riki, PL, or Morphling so the minus armor will put in work. None of those are commonly picked though, outside of PL, and there's far better counters to him then ES. In short: he's just never the best tool for his niche playstyle.  Side-note: I think you would really enjoy movespeed ES. Getting a Euls addressed his mana issues and the move speed lets your spirit move faster. That means better range on him, more ability to scout, and more damage since you can run over more units this way. Great for disabling and scouting out blink dagger initiators, and after a Euls/Drums you can either build S&Y or go auras depending on your team."

TrueDoTA2,3bxboo,gunnersmate,25,Thu Jul 2 22:41:28 2015 UTC,I wouldn't rule out the fact that a bunch of compendium challenges are to get a midas in under X minutes.
TrueDoTA2,3bxboo,redline582,3,Thu Jul 2 23:53:21 2015 UTC,Yeah this is definitely it... I rarely build midas unless I randomly find myself with like 2k gold after a really good teamfight AND am a hero like ancient apparition or enchantress who really wants higher level ultis.  But recently I have built midas on slark and some others just for challenge.
TrueDoTA2,3bxboo,Vladdypoo,8,Fri Jul 3 14:51:22 2015 UTC,I mean I just played a game where both our AA support and jungling enchantress support didn't buy anything until they both finished their midases.  It's just a way player can ignore their team to AFK farm instead of fighting with items.   You're probably just getting unlucky with greedy teammates. It happens all the time probably. Unless Dotabuff has an increase in the number of midases.
TrueDoTA2,3bxboo,wildtarget13,4,Fri Jul 3 00:07:21 2015 UTC,"Just checked dotabuff, no noticeable increase over last week compared to last month.

Midas is also good as an instant HP item since it counts for the bloodrage heal. Also, BS doesn't typically build other farming items in the way that say void or jugg build mom/maelstrom that are farm items as well as dps items. Instead he wants things like sny/bkb/blade/skadi that make him fight better but not farm better."

TrueDoTA2,3bxboo,Hurm4,4,Mon Jul 6 03:47:17 2015 UTC,"The increase in Midas use is likely due to challenges requiring it below X minutes. My take has always been that it is most ideal for heroes that NEED levels, like Wraith King. On heroes that don't NEED the levels or just want it to increase farm, I've also always maintained that there is a serious opportunity cost associated with getting it as your first item. The cost is usually an inability to survive early game rotations and ganks, when you could have purchased passive regen or more HP. I often encounter Midas buyers justifying their purchase for ""farming"" and that it always ""helps"". Of course it wont necessarily HURT you, but that doesn't mean that it is an ideal purchase. Midas takes some time to pay for itself and you can't use it if you're dead."
TrueDoTA2,3bxboo,Hartwall,2,Fri Jul 3 00:28:21 2015 UTC,It also helps you keep farming while fighting.
TrueDoTA2,3bxboo,DerAmazingDom,2,Fri Jul 3 00:00:54 2015 UTC,"I like midas on heroes who are very focused on getting kills, since I can spend much of my time hunting for enemy heroes while still keeping my levels good and gold decent if I don't find them."
TrueDoTA2,3bxboo,goblinbiddin,1 point,Sun Jul 5 22:44:53 2015 UTC,"I actually think 3-5 role midas is very nice this patch. You're generally fighting a lot, and if you can sink 2k into this item and continue to extend the game, you'll find the return in both XP and reliable gold are very nice, even if you get it late. Generally I will get a midas (on certain 3-5 roles) if I can get it before I hit level 14, i'll consider it, simply because the faster level 16 and stat heavy levels are such a boon.  I played a game recently with 2 supports that were raging, and so tried to throw the game by going midas. Unfortunately for them, they each got it in about 12-13 minutes, and I, the offlane darkseer, bought all the wards and kept them up, and we eventually won, just cause we had 2 supports with midas!"
TrueDoTA2,3bxboo,Beanzii,1 point,Fri Jul 3 03:23:33 2015 UTC,"Might be because the creep/neut gold was reduced as well, since midas still provides the extra 190g?"
TrueDoTA2,3bxboo,goblinbiddin,2,Fri Jul 3 10:41:48 2015 UTC,"I think it's 190g instead of whatever the creep was worth, rather than +190g, so it ends up being about +150g, assuming you were going to get that creep anyway, although it does kill it instantly, and give you attack speed. Generally assuming that a hand of midas will make you stronger by around 15 minutes after you get it is a pretty good bet (when you factor in the XP and the 30 attack speed).  To put another way, the first major item you get after hand of midas is probably delayed, but the second one will probably come a bit faster."
TrueDoTA2,3bxboo,ugetrektm8,0,Fri Jul 3 18:05:46 2015 UTC,"I really dont like how dota is developing. Economy in dota makes people to fight more rather than farming.

TrueDoTA2,3bwooc,Dat_Speed,13,Thu Jul 2 19:41:48 2015 UTC,"Merlini was asked the same question on stream and I'll voice him.  Legion Commander is good because Duel is something you can do even if he's good at Dark Pacting. Same thing With call, but Legion can kill slark at all stages of the game.  Timbersaw can just combo the Air around his Shadow Dance and deal consistent damage. Timber players don't rely on their stats as much too. More on Armor and Mana pool, which is still affected by essence shfit, but not as directly as say mana burners.  Sand King is also good as well as an AOE stunner, but sand king has one of the easier to chase lower cooldowns as well as the most AOE damage like Sandstorm. Shaker for example can do the job as well, but not as effectively without blink. Lesh also can do it and has crazy AOE damage, but I wouldn't call Lesh a slark counter. All of these stuns aren't instant.Pretty sure you can Dark Pact off Euls too.  I was playing against a really bad team with some question allies minus my stack. And the slark had a shadow blade skadi and I was hard support roaming POTM. Late game, I would just wait to see if I could survive the burst of dark Pact with ghost scepter on. If I could, then just Ghost TP out. Forcing slark to basher next or diffusal isn't good, because both items are good on slark, but still, it's not skadi or BKB."
TrueDoTA2,3bwooc,wildtarget13,2,Thu Jul 2 19:47:51 2015 UTC,"I agree with LC and Sk. Aside from them and the conventional BS, I think the best way to shut down slark is to deny him farm and experience. I know this is a very generic answer. Any hero without gold and farm is worthless. But Slark is those heroes that really has a hard time climbing back up if he doesn't have a proper early game farm. I've played alot of team ranked games (4.1K MMR) with my friends and when we encounter a slark, we just draft heroes that can hunt him or nuke him down early on. Pick an aggressive trilane or dual lane depending on how many supports are laning with him and focus on denying slark farm. Push slarks lane, and destroy his tower early, making slark hard to find farm. Running a lane with lesh, naga, Ck, Sk, etc. High burst and disables so that slark doesn't have time for a dark pact debuff. This usually means our safelane carry, isn't a very late game hero. Usually we run the mid lane as our carry, SF, sniper or even QOP in some occasions. Because we just wants our mid to farm. the side lanes does not required the mid to gank. If slark goes mid, send out the supports to gank him. Pick carries that can handle his lane on his own.   I guess this is relevant for any enemy carry, but so far that's my fighting mentally against an enemy slark."
TrueDoTA2,3bwooc,sebby03,1 point,Fri Jul 3 00:37:05 2015 UTC,"+1 for duel and sk.   The best counter for a good slark player are: an overfed doom with aghs (quite impossible in 6.84), good lc and a good huskar, and for supports - sk and enigma. Everyone else is shit, really.   Heroes like timber/bristle/brood/bs/lesh/und etc. are usually heroes who seem good against him and will usually crush him in laning stage if there's not a big skill difference between the said hero and the slark player. If the slark has rarely played against a brood, he'll end up feeding and tower taken at 6 min, but if we are talking about a non-retarded slark player and a guy who knows what he's doing, he'll end up with midas at min 5 and lvl 11 at min 10."

You need to be solo vs brood so you can maximize pact dmg, buy bracer and bottle, no need for aquila as the mana regen or the armor wont help you the brood will push anyways, so when one of your melee creeps is low,pull the enemy creeps toward your range one and use pact, this way if he tries to lasthit the ranged creep you'll have pact on cd and ready and you'll kill the spiders, if he doesnt send the spiders he'll get insanely low in hp and one pounce may be enough to finish him off if you have a sentry, and if he sends the spiders you'll use pact and farm them. If he doesnt do anything, you'll deny it. You should start doing this as soon as he starts lasthitting with spiders, activate pact when your melee creep is getting really low, if he tries to lasthit he risks getting damaged, if he sends spiders you gonna bring them below 10% hp and if not you are denying and getting farm and he's not. Qblade is a must. If you do this every wave, by the time you'll be 7 he'll be 6 if you are 1v1 and you'll lead in ~20 cs. You gotta understand though, once he gets lot of spiders you need to go in jungle for some time, let him think you left the lane so he'll try to push with the spiders, and if you come in time (during night preferably) you can get insane farm and lvls. Tower will fall eitherway, but if you get fed it doesnt really matter. Helm and ring is bullshit, you need bracer, mby a stick and a bottle. After you buy shadowblade, either buy a gem or ask your team to do so and you kill him 24/7."

TrueDoTA2,3bwooc,SilentKilla78,4,Fri Jul 3 04:27:40 2015 UTC,"By far the hardest counter to Slark is Bloodseeker.   Slark gets low, and Thirst prevent him healing (it gives vision) Just by being on the map it hurts Slark. Plus Bloodseeker is just REALLY strong right now. Nothing purges off Rupture either and his huge AOE nuke can often finish off Slark or silence him if he missed the dark pact. Even though I am a garbage tier Slark player, I know I will have a rough game against a BS.  Spirit Breaker is also really effective because the charge gives vision and prevents healing. Really about preventing the normal Slark escape. Making pickoffs against moderate strength heroes much higher risk. Most Slarks want to go into burst a guy down, pop ult and finish him off. If spirit breaker gets a charge off before the ult is popped.. REKT. Even more disgusting if he opens with a Silver Edge, break hurts slark hard.  For supports I have a really high success rate against him with Disruptor. Kinetic Field, Static Storm and Glimpse are all very effective against him.  I like early Silences against Slark as well. So anyone who naturally builds orchid and initiates out of nowhere can give him problems as you can kill/burst him down before he gets off the ult or dark pact. So Clinkz orchid build, QoP and Storm orchid first builds and Legion with Blink-->Duel  The only other option is to go for a LATER game carry or very high burst with good initiation. So that mean AM or Storm both of which have very high win rates against Slark on Dotabuff. http://www.dotabuff.com/heroes/slark"
TrueDoTA2,3bwooc,greenhatman99,2,Thu Jul 2 20:21:27 2015 UTC,"Bloodseeker is not as hard of a counter as people think anymore. By keeping a tp scroll at hand and keeping up with farm, a good slark player should be able to deal with him as long as the bloodseeker is not massively ahead. Compare bloodseeker to a hero like PL, for example. Slark cannot deal with illusion heroes very well in general. On top of PL being an illusion hero, he can and should out farm the slark, burn all his mana, all while slark is trying to guess which one is real."
TrueDoTA2,3bwooc,xStratosphere,2,Thu Jul 2 23:19:54 2015 UTC,Fair point on PL and split push illusion heroes in general. What I meant was that thirst just cramps the Slark style.  PL is probably worse.
TrueDoTA2,3bwooc,greenhatman99,2,Fri Jul 3 00:46:24 2015 UTC,"Playing against Bloodseeker is mostly annoying - Slark already has a tough time early game... mainly stuck leeching XP in lane from relative safety, It's extremely hard to zone or LH/DH each wave during this ultra squishy phase. Chucking thirst into that mix lowers the number of engagements you can initiate, win and escape safely drastically in the early-mid.  Once you roll into the late game though, essence shift snowballs hard enough to make Bloodseeker a lot less effective.  PL is frustrating to play against in general. Slark's leap will always lock onto the enemy hero over an illusion, even if the illusion was closer. Followed up with dark pact, Slark can actually lock down PL and kill several illusions extremely quickly, as long as he doesn't get stunned.  Spirit Breaker - Fuck. This. Guy. So. Hard.  If SB get's the drop on you with charge before you can cast Dark Pact, you've got SFA chance of surviving the bash stun gangbang."

Slark would also always get the real illusion with pounce and it's nothing for him and over time his illusions would get weaker. It's not hard to guess the real pl. If there's a 100%counter to slark it'll be a good bs there's nothing slark can do to outplay him once he gets ruptured.

Provided Meepo gets Aghs at a good timing and has good awareness, there's not really much Slark can do vs him until Abyssal and that's not something he wants to rush.  Disruptor also completely shuts him down since there's nothing Slark can purge from Disruptor until he gets BKB, forcing him to Shadow Dance every time if you're doing Glimpse into Ult then Kinetic Field."

TrueDoTA2,3bwooc,BADMON99,1 point,Sat Jul 4 16:33:22 2015 UTC,"Pretty interesting as Slark is my most hated hero and I mostly play Lion. He can just debuff stuns and hex like its nothing, usually in early game you can still control Slark but lategame he will get you."
TrueDoTA2,3bwooc,Phalanx300,2,Tue Jul 7 09:31:03 2015 UTC,"His instant hex is a big problem. You can anticipate it okay in teamfights but lion makes farming as slark in vision very unsafe. Also, if lion is patient and understands slark very well he's more capable at ccing him in the late game. His earth spike can also stun slark during shadow dance."
TrueDoTA2,3bwooc,BADMON99,2,Tue Jul 7 14:08:50 2015 UTC,"This is exactly it. Slark is my most played hero, and when I play against him, Lion is my go to support.  Dark pact has a distinct sound and animation. Most Slarks will hit Q as soon as a fight starts / enemy heroes are in range to stun. Wait til pact ends, then chain hex + earth spike for a lot of CC.   I do well on Slark because most people panic and don't save their stuns, so they're easy to predict and purge off. A hero like Lion or Rhasta can wreck Slark if they're patient, and chain the stuns."
TrueDoTA2,3bwooc,nbwk,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:58:40 2015 UTC,"Anti-Mage I find to be an insanely good counter surprisingly. Because of his poor int gain, even with the spammability of Dark Pact, needs to avoid wasting mana. A Slark with no Mana is suprisingly easy to pin down. Anti-Mage's passive reduces the damage of Pounce and Dark Pact, he can use Blink to instantly catch you/run away and because Slark can't afford to lose mana, the only times he can really fight AM head on is with Shadow Dance active/with a teammate. IMO AM pretty much beats Slark at any stage of the game. Bloodseeker's Rupture cannot be purged, Bloodseeker does pretty good right-clicks, so man-fighting is risky, Blood Rite with Rupture forces Slark to choose between taking huge damage and a silence or huge damage, and of course Slark can't regen if Bloodseeker has thirst on him. Bannana Slam Jamma thinks Spirit Breaker is a really good counter; Charge of Darkness puts global vision on Slark, even with active ulti, SB doesn't care about armor since his bash is magical, his ulti can hit Slark even if he activates Shadow Dance and SB's fairly tanky, so SB's not gonna go down easy. Abaddon can usually just ignore Slark completely because of his heal, shield and Ulti. Meepo is also a really scary match-up for Slark; Meepo has an innate 35% magic resistance, and if he tries pouncing on top of Meepo, he could end up killing himself from the amount of damage Poof does, and Meepo can easily waste Shadow Dance's active with spamming Nets. Slardar is also a solid counter imo; true sight and as long as Slardar isn't falling behind/Slark isn't snowballing, Slardar can rip apart Slark if he tries to attack him solo."
TrueDoTA2,3bwooc,Fancy-Bear1776,1 point,Sun Jul 5 23:56:59 2015 UTC,"Good advice, but I'd have to disagree about Abaddon. I love playing against Abaddon as slark. The heal tend to  just allow you to steal more stats.   In mid to late game, if on Slark I have s&y or skadi, I would gladly right click an Abaddon through his ult and heal him to full if it means I can keep stealing his stats. By the time borrowed time is up, he'll still be slowed, and Slark will have so much attack speed that Abaddon will die anyway.   Basically, most supports die relatively quickly and don't allow Slark to steal many stats. Abaddon, on the other hand, allows for huge amounts of stats to be stolen."
TrueDoTA2,3bwooc,nbwk,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:02:48 2015 UTC,I'm surprised more people didn't mention storm.    He provides a lot of burst magic damage which is good against slark's poor stats/statgrowths. Can't be leashed so nearly impossible for slark to kill him by himself. Can follow slark so he never gets the regen and speed from his ult when running away

TrueDoTA2,3bt41c,jookz,13,Wed Jul 1 22:46:38 2015 UTC,I think Undying thrives on trilanes when played right. You can amass strength from your q if you hit at least two of them. It also has a fairly low CD so you can use it often. Not to mention you have tombstone and a heal so you are quite capable of hurting their lane.
TrueDoTA2,3bt41c,Psyk0s1s,2,Wed Jul 1 22:50:17 2015 UTC,I have been playing a lot of undying solo off and he is great. I much prefer playing him this way than as a lane support. He is strongest when the opponents have a melee carry and a melee support. This makes it extremely easy to get double strength steal from your q. The best part is once you are level 3 they can not really dive you without seriously risking giving you a double or triple kill. And once you get that you have no fear of them at all and can start to actually dominate the tri. He is much worse when the support say fuck it and rome instead of trying to bank you. He sucks in the 1v1 situation unless he is ahead.
TrueDoTA2,3bt41c,Boony52,1 point,Thu Jul 2 04:16:06 2015 UTC,"I'll add that Undying is also a beast at killing squishy supports in trilanes scenarios, like CM or Kotol. Around level 2 or 3, if you were able to apply some decay to them, a simple tomb placed on them while they're in the treeline waiting to gank you equals some kills from you. Their carry, won't be able to chase you because he'll have to deal with the tomb too.   It's basically about catching who wants to gank or zone you while he shouldn't even try, because well it's undying and he's a beast at countering that. Higher MMR opponents will probably be aware of that."
TrueDoTA2,3bt41c,back_to_the_roots,2,Thu Jul 2 10:52:30 2015 UTC,"If they try to be clever and focus the tombstone, they will be very sad when you soul rip it and kill them all."

Once you get a few levels of it, it can really boost your farm as well.   *Pheonix need levels and can really benefit from solo exp.  Heros that have a silence (such as silencer) can really wreck you though. They can stop you from diving away really easily. Once you start your dive they can  silence you and you can not cancel it. You end up coming right back to where you were and then they kill you. Not much you can do about it.  edit: formating"
TrueDoTA2,3bt41c,Boony52,3,Thu Jul 2 04:26:35 2015 UTC,"That highly depends on the trilane (players most of all, not even the heroes as much). I'm quite the experienced phoenix and I can tell you that any trilane that puts out early pressure (as they should) will make phoenix never get in xp range almost ever. Having no armor and spells that take away his hp allows phoenix to get pushed away very easily against any ranged support at level 1. And getting spirits first is never really a good option. If you keep the phoenix at level 1 & 2 and let your carry get some items/levels before phoenix can manage level 3 then hes been shut down hard.  I would  normally agree with you but phoenix doesn't fit the criteria mentioned in the OP as much has heroes like clock/DS/Tide/Timber/undying. Those heroes can either take a beating, beat on the supports at level 1 unless they're unified, or manipulate the creep wave to get farm/xp."
TrueDoTA2,3bt41c,Radians,6,Thu Jul 2 14:31:27 2015 UTC,"Dark Seer is also a versatile offlane hero. But only pick it when you're up against a melee carry. It could work in some range carries as well. His ion shells will absolutely wreck your opponents farm. You get gold and if the trilane is too hard, there's always the jungle for you to farm. The only down side is that your lane is always pushed towards the enemy's tower which gives your enemy supports a higher chance you catch you off. Therefore getting experience is hard. One observer can help with this to help you with identifying their location. If your enemy starts to pull, just cast a shell on the tankiest jungle creep and watch for the gold. I usually get a boots and soul ring and then rush a guardian greaves, focusing on mek first before arcane. More reason to pick dark seer when your mid is a pudge or slark that can benefit from dark seers skills when they are ganking your lane."
TrueDoTA2,3bt41c,sebby03,3,Thu Jul 2 00:24:03 2015 UTC,"Tide, Darkseer, Clock are all very good in lane, even vs 3."
TrueDoTA2,3bt41c,goblinbiddin,3,Thu Jul 2 04:11:32 2015 UTC,"There's someone who hasn't been mentioned here properly, Lich.  There are times when a trilane is extremely powerful and can kill or zone any hero trying to have lane presence, meaning no offlaner can even get level 2 in the lane, much less disrupt the enemy carry's farm. Lich is possibly the only hero who can face that trilane and, as well as making lane control more difficult to give him the chance of getting gold and xp under tower, he can get 100% guaranteed denies to hurt the carry's farm no matter what."
TrueDoTA2,3bt41c,Dirst,2,Fri Jul 3 13:51:14 2015 UTC,"I think that Furion can do well versus Trilanes. He can skip the creep wave like a Syllabear and block camps for so many levels. He has decent protection against dices, but it's in the form of treant vision and how he can deter small basilius pushes with just trees.   He also can catch up in the jungle decently and can assist in ganks super early. Treant a can also pressure non stout carriers or heroes that don't have natural regen like blood seeker."
TrueDoTA2,3bt41c,wildtarget13,2,Thu Jul 2 18:46:48 2015 UTC,"Undying. He can do serious work with a level advantage, and his skills all are increased in effectiveness by the presence of more heroes."

TrueDoTA2,3bt41c,docmartens,7,Wed Jul 1 23:00:58 2015 UTC,"Puck is bad. Only has mana to use Orb to escape twice before regen, and is squishy and unable to deal with zoning or harass. And let's not forget, Orb takes a long time to get out, and any decent trilane will be able to kill regardless of it. 3 second travel time means an average 2 second stun can almost completely negate its usefulness."

TrueDoTA2,3bt41c,reazura,0,Thu Jul 2 07:18:45 2015 UTC,"Clock, timbersaw, or bristleback can do well against a trilane with low damage output.  If it is a lane with any sort of kill potential, you basically have to pick a hero that is ok with getting level 3-4 with no farm and either jungling or roaming as it will just be too dangerous to stay.  Something like a DS, Pudge, BH, TH.  You have to give up on the idea of being able to kill the carry if the supports leave.  He'll be very far ahead in gold , and the supports are unlikely to leave him if he's going to be vulnerable."

Obviously that's very specific and he has lots of bad matchups (Witch Doctor, Dazzle, Silencer to name a few) but if the enemy lane is a bunch of 400- range heroes or melees, Axe will always have kill potential and is basically impossible to zone. Versus trilanes in general Axe may not be as reliable as Tidehunter or someone like that, but versus this specific type of trilane the only offlaner who can match his kill potential is Undying (who's probably the best anti-trilane hero in the game)."
TrueDoTA2,3bt41c,DangerAwar,6,Thu Jul 2 03:50:01 2015 UTC,"lol no. The only time Axe is a strong anti-trilane hero is when the trilane is absurdly weak, or the players are very bad. Otherwise, the lane will either zone him out and keep him level 1 indefinitely until he decides to go jungle."
TrueDoTA2,3bt41c,Dirst,2,Thu Jul 2 04:08:48 2015 UTC,"That's kind of what I said - assuming they lack range (which automatically makes for a weaker trilane), Axe is one of the best bullies possible.

OR he will come back but with no mana but full HP.   at the moment the only way for WK to counter any mana drain is BKB and hope that you die with in that BKB duration(by not getting mana drain but have your HP go low enough)   but certainly, a support WK wouldnt want a aghs first in any case...similar reason to why TB is not that great is that his ulti can never be used aggressively unless you do some cheesy strat. and as WK, or your team, you never really wanna plan for if someone dies back up plan. you wanna build to having items to do (lets KILL THEM ALL plan, or prevent your team from dying)   MAYBE, having the aghs could be that, IF WK team kills an enemy hero, THAT enemy hero will come back to life and could be controlled by WK and use their abilities (maybe cant use ULTI other wise its OP, and cant use items like euls, abbysal) and only get to use the enemy hero wraith for 5secs. and that would be a cool aggressive type option for a support WK.  but any WK would want a blink. and having a 4k item aghs is just something that's does not seem to be worth it for what it does, your team mates dies anyways. last for 5secs. Your team shouldnt be dying in the first place and so it does not seem worth it.

TrueDoTA2,3buoyi,NUZdreamer,2,Thu Jul 2 10:42:49 2015 UTC,"I don't think Shadow Blade is comparable to Blink for Tinker and I don't think one game is enough to draw these conclusions off of. I certainly think its a situational pick-up on him due to his ability to Rearm it continually however, especially if Silver Edge would wreck the enemy passives. The reason it can't replace it is is because of how easily Tinker would be to counter with detection. 1 dust and all of a sudden you either need to invest in a purge item and survive long enough to get another rearm off, or they gem and you're screwed without a blink. Tinker can't effectively split-push like that.  I saw Fluff play a Glimmer Tinker the other day and the ability to Blink, then go invis during every re-arm make him nearly impossible to catch for the enemy. Makes Tinker considerably more slippery."

After getting a couple of cheap items, SB doesn't desperately depend on another more expensive item AT ALL to stay relevant.Every item after boots, urn, wand is nice to have, but not 100% necessary to fulfill his role. With the money from some ganks you might as well invest into a Midas to stay relevant in the lategame. Also don't forget that Midas gives attack speed, which is very good on SB. Of course there are games where you're sitting on 1.5k gold and you think ""shit, i REALLY need that bkb"" or ""if i get a shadowblade in the next 5 minutes, that Furion will be food for the rest of the game"".

That's not convincing at all.   spirit breaker's strength is early to mid game.    Read: He falls off like hell because he will have absolutely no way to farm or get XP except when fighting. SB is supposed to be hidden on the map as often as possible (same with Nyx or BH) and jungling is very sub-optimal. His skills are a all great, too, so it's no stretch to say he wants to have levels past 11.   I think the part you're ignoring is that SB is moderately item-independent and you won't feel much of a difference when charging in with half an Armlet or a Midas, except you're playing 3k pubs where everyone just does his own thing. Your job is to rush in, disrupt the clash/isolate a key target, ult him and then tank damage while trying to bash people. You're already really hard to bring down due to SB's naturally high HP and armor.  P.S.: I think Armlet is a horrible item at the moment and if you really wanted to secure the game earlier on you should get BKB asap, which Armlet delays heavily."
TrueDoTA2,3bqkv2,AngelDarkened,1 point,Thu Jul 2 06:27:31 2015 UTC,"Midas on AA is to get the fast Aghs, which makes AA's fight contribution 10x more effective. Phoenix gets Midas because getting to level 16 early makes the egg so much more powerful.   Getting Midas on SB means his early roaming is gimped to give him a more powerful lategame. There is no level you want to get to that means you can turn around any fight like supernova. there is no great item that makes you an amazing teamfighter, like AA's aghs upgrade. With a good team comp when you start to fall off your cores should be coming on line. you still provide some CC with Charge, and a BKB piercing stun from Ult, but thats all you need to do, you provide chase, and some extra movement speed but you don't need to be the big item high leveled hero, you need to be the early game powerhouse, leverage charge, and your innate tankiness in the early game to set the pace, make space for your cores to farm, and limit the farming of the enemy.

I'm not saying rush Midas before boots, but after the core items you mentioned there is, apart from BKB, no item you truly need. Your job is run in, stun, disrupt, take damage, probably die. In fact, SB is very prone to dying often, making the reliable Midas gold even more worth it.  As the other three guys arguing here were all 2-3k MMR can I ask if you actually tried it/have more experience with SB?

TrueDoTA2,3bqkv2,Boony52,8,Thu Jul 2 04:48:41 2015 UTC,"Your auto attack is your most important asset as any level 1 roamer. Your spells will not be what gets the kill at level 1, it'll be attacks, make sure you're setting yourself up to get as many of those in as possible.  For example, as mirana, when you fire an arrow, don't wait around to see if it hits, immediately start following it in (staying out of sight) and get to the place you want to be when it lands, so you can start getting those autos off."
TrueDoTA2,3bqkv2,goblinbiddin,0,Wed Jul 1 15:40:49 2015 UTC,"And this is the key to using unusual / or bad roaming heroes effectively. By position and timing autoattacks, you can roam with just about anything. A terrorblade is a monster, because those autoattacks deal so much damage. It doesn't matter that he doesn't have nukes.   This is how you roam a Syllabear, Treant Protector, Ursa, Luna, etc. Anything with high base damage can roam, especially with a movement advantage."
TrueDoTA2,3bqkv2,situLight,6,Thu Jul 2 01:32:21 2015 UTC,"I feel you dude.   Here's some things I have done, not necessarily maining all of them right now.  Bounty Hunter  Strong at killing mid heroes and if anything, blowing your mana pool getting double shadow walk bonus damage on low armor mid heroes is similar to sitting mid with a sky wrath mid spamming arcane bolts.   You can also kill couriers using double wind walk damage. A couple GG branches can help if you don't start boots.   You want HP and a blink on Bounty. Bottle almost always. Wand is strong as bounty has low stats. Tranquils plus vanguard or arcanes into greaves are good choices. Blink is so you can initiate with a blink Jinada strike.   Max your nuke first and even considering skipping Jinada till level 4 for high armor targets.  Mirana   Throw arrows at mid. Cliff jungle your level two if the enemy mid has good positioning or will likely not die even with a 5 second arrow like DK or Bristle or stout shield mids.   Look up how to cliff jungle these heroes and start quelling. Getting level 2 off a medium camp can be the difference between a 2 minute gank working.  Use smokes. Get boots bottle ASAP. Don't be afraid to jungle your team courier+ wards. Stack a large camp on radiant and cliff jungle like furion.   Chen+Enchant  If you want to learn these heroes, it's worth it. Micros not hard. It's not first nature though. Understanding creeps and efficient jungling is important here. Not to mention staying relevant.   General  I actually mostly mentioned heroes that can kill heroes close to solo with little help from enemy heroes. Even with my friends, they will be scared and not want to go in because they can't feel damage thresholds.   A lot of supports can roaming, gank, and even cliff jungle. Rubick can cliff down people mid. Venge, Lina, and venom anchor can land their spells level 1 for easy follow up. But without follow up you've just traded your time for maybe 200 HP worth of a core's regen.   Most supports can also sap experience or contest a greedy jungler's farm.  Important  Use smokes. Play mid yourself and realize what time people will go for last hits. If you walk  up to them and force them to stay in the mid animation of walking to last hit or leave. Watch your replays and player perspectives. Most people don't watch for roaming heroes every minute. Maybe until you show up on the map under a ward, but most will focus on winning their matchup.  For heroes like Mirana or with ranged spells that might be hard to land with good vision. Sit in fog and be ready to initiate at exactly 4 minutes when night hits. If you have level 2 as night stalker then hitting me with void will likely kill mids unless they are QOP or Puck.   The vision change takes at least 1 second to process. Take full advantage of it. Same with things like rune times."
TrueDoTA2,3bqkv2,wildtarget13,2,Wed Jul 1 17:19:13 2015 UTC,"I don't think Mirana is very strong this meta, but both BH and Tusk are very strong early game roamers.

TrueDoTA2,3bqkv2,armahillo,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:34:58 2015 UTC,"I'm in a pretty low rank myself, however I find that Vengeful Spirit is a pretty good roamer with tranquil boots and a medallion.  Medallion is my usual choice of item, as I feel it has better late game scaling on Venge with the new solar crest. It's only super good on teams that deal a lot of physical damage, but generally that's when you'd pick Venge, or what people pick when you lock in Venge early. When paired with heroes like Ursa, it can make a late first or early second Rosh attempt much faster. With even one level in wave of terror, you can bring roshan's armor down below 0 any time before the 36 minute mark (I think?).  Tranquils let you heal up very quickly after a gank, and also give you even more armor on top of the armor that Medallion gives. If you just need to get more hits in and are somewhat competent at tread switching, then Treads may be a good choice, too.  As for going into the late game, her scaling is really good. She has the second best strength scaling of any agility hero, so she gets pretty tanky with levels, as well as very good agility gain. As she's an agility hero, building items like S&Y, Butterfly, Diffusal, etc. is quite effective, especially combined with her Vengeance Aura. If you're going more the luxury support style, then getting blink can help you make safe pick offs before a team fight starts. If you're taking damage from very long range constantly, then a force staff may be better. If you get the money, an Aghs can really increase your mobility and chasing power, too. Having a 10 second cooldown swap is extremely good if you're fighting all the time, I feel, as you can sometimes swap an enemy out, live long enough, and swap out to a creep during the engagement, or even swap in one of your cores like Luna.  And while getting items can make her really good, even with just boots and a medallion, she can still make a huge impact around the map, given the right cores.  At my level, playing Venge as a core is very viable, and having that early power with magic missile and eventually swap can make melee mids very afraid to come get last hits if the wave is ever on your high ground.  Whatever you do, have fun!"
TrueDoTA2,3bqkv2,kaictl,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:27:46 2015 UTC,"Don't roam unless you and your team knows what to do with it because if you roam it means your offlane will not be strong to contest their safelaners farm and your own safelane will be pressured or even get no farm depending on how dogshit his support is. If their enemy team doesn't feel pressure and dives all three towers it means you failed as a roamer and add to the fact that you might be ridiculously under leveled and farm if you don't get any kills off. Your best bet is to completely shit on the enemy lane if you're better than them, it's a lot easier to win and carry the game like that."
TrueDoTA2,3bqkv2,forkkind,1 point,Thu Jul 2 03:11:01 2015 UTC,"IMO Dazzle is a good roamer though I think its quite an unconventional choice. I understand your plight, its disheartening to play a good support for a meh carry. Getting Poison Touch at level 1 guarantees a kill, especially during rune battles. Shallow Grave can really turn the tide but be prepared to make some clutch plays. His Ulti works well for roaming. A good strategy would be to cast it prematurely on yourself and another teammate and by the time you reach your target, you'll both be tanky. The heal is pretty weak early on, because you're dependent on the presence of other units."
TrueDoTA2,3bqkv2,cookiechang,1 point,Thu Jul 2 08:55:39 2015 UTC,1) Roam with a partner. This makes it more effective and more fun. Since you're queuing with friends this should be no problem. You can pretty much win the game in the laning phase this way.  2) Keep your movement tight. You don't want to be roaming around the whole map. If you're facing a traditional 3-1-1 lane then you will probably want to focus on ganking the enemy mid and offlane.  3) Control the runes. That's a main priority for roamers. It also opens up kill opportunities from enemy mids going to get runes.  4) Control vision. This means you staying out of your enemies vision as much as possible to keep them fearful of ganks and also means you should be warding and dewarding like a madman.  5) Smokes. It is amazing to me how ppl don't utilize smokes at all. If you are going to gank in an area where you don't have ward control smoke in.  6) Take advantage of lower hero vision at night time. This significantly increases ganking success rates.

It's also gonna be nice to have ghost walk availible if we get focused and forge spirits are nice to have to throw in some -armor as well. So that's 6-7 spells we really want and 8 we'll be able to find a use for (sunstrike is pretty crap at this point in the game)    I'd say that's plenty of utility for the aghs if we want to get one,  even if we only cast our spells once,  right?"
TrueDoTA2,3br197,goblinbiddin,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:49:51 2015 UTC,Sunstrike is amazing at all stages because it's a huge nuke and it pierces bkb and spell resist. It's just harder to use later on unless you're comboing it with other spells. It's not useless.
TrueDoTA2,3br197,MisterJhones,1 point,Thu Jul 2 09:31:25 2015 UTC,"Team engagements are usually too chaotic to get a sunstrike off on exactly 1 target, which is when it's really effective. It's not useless at that point in the game (a fair point, my phrasing wasn't correct) but it's not useful in team engagements, for the most part.

TrueDoTA2,3brdzu,inscTppz,6,Wed Jul 1 15:16:37 2015 UTC,"Depends on the build. Lots of people swear by tanky Sniper (Treads, Aquila, Drums, S&Y, Skadi), but I prefer glass cannon (MoM, Blink, Mjollnir). He's not strong this meta, but he is still okay. Positioning is extremely important on him, so make sure you are on the outskirts of fights, but taking full advantage of your teammates positioning to lay down cover fire and maximize your Shrapnel/ranged right-click. Don't AFK farm unless you are the hardest carry in the game, Sniper is generally best played as a 5-man supplement who can harass the enemy and wear down towers/heroes from far away.  Sniper has low base damage, but has a very crisp animation. If you teammates are stealing your CS in lane you should probably look into doing some last hit practice with him too, until you have that down. Don't level his % proc until you have kill potential, since otherwise it will screw up your laning CS. If you're dying in lane a lot that's also an issue with your map awareness, not your teams' composition or play style. Buy wards if it will save you, that's an investment to your networth if they save you, not a detriment.  I also finds its helpful to say something like ""Guys, trying to finish 10 hero challenge. I'm choosing Sniper no matter what. Anyone willing to choose some tanky initiators that I can provide cover fire for?"" Its hit and miss, sometimes people hate chatty people, but usually communication works for me. Might also try playing him in a support role if that's what your team's draft needs- he's not terrible since he has a built in slow and can harass pretty easily.  Spirit Breaker, QoP, Clock and BS will all eat you. I'd really recommend just not wasting your time versus them unless you're confident in the rest of your team's lineup. Boots vary on game state, Phase is great if you need midgame damage to punch through someone or a little move boost, otherwise Treads are superior due to increased tankiness and atk speed scaling. Lothat's can be situationally good, especially at your MMR, but don't rush Silver Edge unless you can hard counter someone with it (Axe, Bristle, Huskar post-ult, etc.)."
TrueDoTA2,3brdzu,Ailodierap,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:00:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah I have some problems Lasthitting before I have aquila completed. When I refered to ""ppl stealing my farm"" I was talking about lanenukers (one game a techies TT) or some with higher attackdamage (pl eg. - there was no other lane available. I went bot to our ""core silencer"" after I like 1 minute then and we got destroyed by their ganky/fightcombination. I couldnt do anything. Meanwhile pl feeded vs a lone brew). I should learn LH with sniper though without items I guess. Thanks for the advice.  Buying wards/map awareness would be no problem if I wouldnt have to put em down by myself in the games we dont have wards. Buty yeah better loose that farm/time than dying. You're right on that.  I try communicatio everytime but as you know yourself it doesnt work often sadly.  I try him as support once or twice. Maybe this will work it out for me -  mostly its just if i go carry my support autoattacks/doesnt pull/doesnt buy wards or i go support and my carry cant LH. (I know I deserve to be around 3k but I sometimes wonder if the others do too TT)  Thanks!"
TrueDoTA2,3brdzu,Ailodierap,2,Wed Jul 1 16:21:34 2015 UTC,"Best of luck! Sounds like you have the right attitude, so just keep your head down and keep trying."
TrueDoTA2,3brdzu,nbwk,6,Wed Jul 1 18:34:39 2015 UTC,"Don't blindly pick Sniper. He has to be played against the right set of heroes, and unfortunately, the current meta revolves around a couple of these heroes. So there are fewer games where Sniper is a great choice. I'm thinking specifically of Spirit Breaker and Bloodseeker. They're both excellent gap-closing gankers who dominate Sniper with ease. Don't waste your time picking Sniper against heroes like that.  Sniper excels when he has teammates who can run in and take all of the enemy's attention. Tide, Spirit Breaker, Dragon Knight, Clockwerk. You want the enemy to engage your 4 other heroes in a 4v5 fight, then you sit back and peep people from the sidelines.   Sniper is all about positioning. I would recommend trying phase boots over treads for the extra move speed. Shadowblade is good in the right game. Even blink isn't terrible. That's how important positioning is on this hero. Basically, whatever you can do to make your enemies forget that you're there will help you do the DPS you need to win fights."
TrueDoTA2,3brdzu,nbwk,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:53:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah sure. As i said I wait for the last pick if I can. When there are already very gankheavy enemys I dont pick him.  Thanks for the Blink/SB advice. Going sb first after treads/aquila is an option? or should i delay it after I have both (treads and aquila). Sure it depends on the situation, but how early is it ok to get sb would be my question"
TrueDoTA2,3brdzu,Gaston44,2,Wed Jul 1 16:11:35 2015 UTC,I would probably get S&Y first. The move speed gives a similar benefit (allowing you to get away from the enemy). Phase over treads also helps with the last hitting more than treads.

TrueDoTA2,3brdzu,kkshah7290,3,Fri Jul 3 15:18:54 2015 UTC,"Try playing him with undying in a lane. Go duo offlane, go 4-1-1 and get kills for days. One of the issues I find in the current meta is that people pick lots of good fighting heroes that let you kill the outer towers easily, but it's easy to stall taking high ground. Sniper adds a lot of seige for those situations."
TrueDoTA2,3brdzu,wildtarget13,2,Wed Jul 1 16:04:42 2015 UTC,"There are three keys to Sniper:   Positioning Positioning Positioning   Make use of your range, any terrain feature that you can find, and your teammates' positions in order to keep the autoattacks flowing. By rule of thumb if a Sniper is allowed to autoattack, his team will win.  Against some lineups there is never a safe position, but there are always positions that will allow your team to punish the enemy for focusing you. Sometimes it's correct to wait until their primary flanker enters the fight before you start shooting; even if you have to wait 20 seconds for the Tusk to jump on someone else, it's correct if it secures your ability to right-click.  Sniper is one of the most item-flexible heroes in the game. It's extremely important to choose your items depending on the matchup, toeing the line of just-enough-survivability in order to maximize your dps.  I lean towards shadowblade as my first core Sniper item. You can't rely on it to get you out of everything, but if you are positioned correctly it's actually really hard for them to kill you. Maybe they only have 1-2 heroes that can reach you behind your team. The SB ms + allied response can make it extremely difficult for them to secure the kill. Additionally I often use SB to pick off supports. The bonus damage + a couple right clicks is usually enough.  I prefer Maelstrom 2nd, which is great for farming and for boosting your total damage in team fights. Lightning procs also can mess with blink daggers.  If playing against a Storm Spirit or Clockwork or similar, I have no problems rushing a BKB or a Sange for early survivability. Some games I'll get a blink dagger, some games I'll grab a Skadi, some games I'll go completely glass cannon.  Don't assassinate unless you have to; I'll note ulting while an enemy is in range of your auto attacks is very rarely correct. Some skirmishes you won't be able to get in range to contributing anything besides an assassinate, then it's fine.  Good luck - never stop thinking!"

I always thought there aren't enough posts/articles discussing the most interesting role in DotA (no bias kappa) so I'm glad you've started this.  I think more people really should understand their hero's Impact Breakpoints, as you've said. Too many pubbies just sit there in lane, way past the breakpoint, without even a tp in their inventory.  I'd like to help you add a write-up about Phoenix, but I'm not sure if he's a survival offlaner or pressure offlaner to you (seems a bit of both to me). Let me know if you'd like the write-up, and of course do add me for article sharing!"
TrueDoTA2,3bpfw1,DatAdra,2,Wed Jul 1 07:38:42 2015 UTC,"I do not play much phoenix, he seems like a survival offlaner to me, with the big break being level 6. If you'd like to do a writeup on it, go ahead, then send me a PM and i'll put it on the main page under other folk's work.  I think the big differenve between survival and pressure offlaners is that a survival offlaner should be moving off as soon as the breakpoint is hit, whereas the pressure offlaner usually wants to stick around for as long as he is still able to apply pressure.  You're on the sharelist!  Thanks for the read and comment!"
TrueDoTA2,3bpfw1,NappySlapper,2,Wed Jul 1 15:32:12 2015 UTC,Would you consider earthshaker for this role? He can control the lane as well as clock and with levels he can put enough damage out to kill a support if they overextend
TrueDoTA2,3bpfw1,Maraudershields7,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:53:29 2015 UTC,"I'm not the hugest fan of es offline but he can certainly work, if you can address his mana issues. Consider rotating out of lane with level 6 and mana boots to stack yourself up a hard camp to either spam fissure or even slam down for the quick  blink. Your challenge in this role on that hero is finding your impact breakpoint early enough in the game to justify your role.   An alternative would be to put him in the offline as a 4 role with a high farm jungle like enigma."
TrueDoTA2,3bpfw1,Aquatrium,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:14:14 2015 UTC,I'm relatively new to playing solo offlane; could you give me your opinion on weaver and timbersaw as solo offlaners?
TrueDoTA2,3bpfw1,DatAdra,1 point,Wed Jul 1 11:06:22 2015 UTC,"Hi, 3k scrub here but I play a lot of Weaver. He is a pretty good offlaner and is very slippery and hard to catch. Your geminate attack can help you last hit and give you the upper hand while trading hits. However sentries counter him pretty hard so you'll want to make sure they don't have detection - he is extremely fragile, one stun and you're dead. The swarm can also help you push if your enemies leave the lane for some reason and helps with controlling creep equilibrium.   He does very well against short-ranged or melee heroes because he can trade hits with geminate attack and shukuchi out before the enemy attacks you (you can even deal damage to them with shukuchi to harass further). However long-ranged heroes are strong against him because they can attack him before he gets close enough to attack and shukuchi out. Again, crowd control spells destroy him so play safe if you are up against stunners. The swarm can even be used to scout which is useful to avoid ganks. He has mana problems early on though so you can't really spam his spells.   Generally I go treads and aquila first always while in lane. Pretty standard build. Then I either build desolator + bkb or linkens + some other damage item depending on the enemy. Sometimes an urn and medallion can be useful if you want to gank early."
TrueDoTA2,3bpfw1,Harlequeens,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:56:23 2015 UTC,"Timbersaw is my 2nd most played hero and I always use him on the offlane.  He makes for a very good offlaner (though not currently ""in-meta"" per se) as he can take hits from supports very well, and if he manages to get level 6 he hits an insanely powerful impact breakpoint where he can solo kill enemy laners with ease. You generally max timberchain with value points in whirlingdeath and reactivearmor. Reactive armor will let you tank enemy hits very well and whirling death can be used to last hit.   Timbersaw's main downfall as an offlaner is the lack of general utility and the fact that he requires farm to do his thing. In that sense he is a somewhat greedy offlaner, since if he gets shut down (difficult and unlikely in pubs) he does not offer very much. He is also atrocious at base pushes and base defence, at least until he gets an aghanims scepter."
TrueDoTA2,3bpfw1,cloudy100,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:33:34 2015 UTC,"Timber is absolutely fine, he can put on a lot of pressure and then eventually come up with a bloodstone and be an excellent tanky frontliner with good mobility going into the mid and late game.  Weaver used to see a lot of play in this role, but i'm less convinced that she can still make the same impact as she used to out of the offlane. The 1.8 BAT is a big nerf to the hero overall, and makes her much more reliant on getting things going early, which she will not be able to do in the offlane. She can't really apply much pressure, and doesn't really have a big breakpoint.  Thanks for the read and comment!"
TrueDoTA2,3bpfw1,cerealkillr,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:37:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah, much like Clinkz, I prefer to run Weaver as a safelaner with a strong lane presence since he scales well with farm. Weaver offlane is fine if the opposing lane doesn't have any way to hold him down, but that seems unlikely outside of a weak draft on the opposing team's part. Apart from daft picks, competent players shouldn't have too hard of a time driving frail heroes like Weaver or Clinkz out of the lane... and if they have a bad time in lane it can greatly hinder them from dishing out their physical DPS later on."

TrueDoTA2,3bqh72,a34fsd,2,Wed Jul 1 09:18:59 2015 UTC,"I like doing a similar build although I don't grab a 3rd Band unless my team is losing:  Wraith --> Boots --> Aquila --> 2nd Wraith --> Save for Travels (and potentially Midas), preparing to spend unreliable gold on 3rd Wraith --> Yasha --> Blink  The Travels set you up to take a tower or two whenever a teamfight is won, lets you split-push sneakily, and allows you to farm non-stop, but still show up for team fights. I wouldn't get them if you're going to be pressured to 5-man early, only get them if your team can make you space or the enemy team is split pushing/ganking a lot. Generally I will go Blink afterwards and then save for my next large item (MKB, Daedalus, Skadi or Butterfly depending on draft). I will grab a Manta or S&Y with my unreliable gold while saving for the big purchases.  I like it because Travels lets you get a lot of stat value early on with the Wraith Bands, and it allows you to transition into late game easily as well since you are slot efficient and have several small items that are no big deal to sell."
TrueDoTA2,3bqh72,Ailodierap,2,Wed Jul 1 15:44:28 2015 UTC,"No mask of madness? Without treads the the builds seems lacking of AS.

TrueDoTA2,3bqh72,wakek3k3,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:38:36 2015 UTC,"Well in this meta, which is mid game dominance, cheap stat items does wonders or even an early BKB.

TrueDoTA2,3bqh72,Mezkh,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:27:24 2015 UTC,"It can work....it depends if you won lanes overall I think. Treads are good for early deathballing and fighting, makes a difference.

TrueDoTA2,3bqh72,Harlequeens,2,Wed Jul 1 17:25:50 2015 UTC,"Regarding MoM, Drow definitely felt the nerf, but it's still a valuable item on her. MoM gives you much-needed movespeed for chasing and kiting, not to mention sustain enough to take Ancient stacks or even Rosh early and efficiently. It kicks Drow's tower-shredding power up to the next level and makes the prospect of Gust far more threatening in the early and mid game.  Even if the enemy line-up doesn't afford you much opportunity to employ the active against opposing heroes in an offensive capacity, Berserk has enough application in farming, efficient map movement, taking objectives, etc. to warrant strong consideration in most games."

TrueDoTA2,3bqh72,Harlequeens,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:32:06 2015 UTC,"The value of early Travels largely depend on the gamestate. If the plan is leverage Precision Aura into grouping up for early team objective-taking, RoA and Treads plus or minus a second casual Wraith are the better value. Travels are far greedier, and Drow drafts usually want to win in the mid game or at least have built up a big enough lead to enter the early late game with a heavy advantage—if you're farming well and can reasonably get away with ""skipping"" straight to Travels without any immediate drawback, it's almost certainly worth it. Those conditions have to be met for the greed to pay off without backfiring. For example, is your team strong enough to go as four while you split the map? Travels in such a scenario would better allow you to occupy the space created by your team by splitting the map... if such tactics are feasible, fast Travels are usually well-worth it if for no reason other than map efficiency.  Not only do Travels provide Drow with a means of leveraging her pushing power should the opportunity present itself, but movespeed in general is a tremendous asset to her. One small benefit to early Travels is they make you awfully difficult to catch for any hero without a gap-closer, especially if you're buying other mobility items anyway. I guess the tl;dr for me is that there's a case to be made for fast Travels, but 1) only if you'll be able to take advantage of them and 2) aren't otherwise sacrificing too much of your early game to do so.  Random aside: apart from a hard game, an early Travels scenario would be for me personally the only actual time that third Wraithband would even be worth considering—three of them are otherwise just too slot inefficient given how fast Drow farms under normal circumstances."
TrueDoTA2,3bqh72,Harlequeens,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:09:54 2015 UTC,I think in pro games the standard ammount of wraith bands is 3 if I rember correctly and they dont even go for travels.
TrueDoTA2,3bqh72,Dat_Speed,1 point,Wed Jul 1 23:02:55 2015 UTC,"They also sometimes skip Frost Arrows entirely which might be fine if the opposing mid hero is Fear's Puck who you won't be able to kill anyway and your safelane is s4 on QoP, but it's hardly ever a good move in a pub where your lane presence is exceedingly modest without orb-walking. Similarly, not carrying a TP scroll in a pub in order to hold onto a third Wraith (following your triple Wraith, boots, Yasha, and MoM build) strikes me as largely pointless in a pub as opposed to RoA, a casual Wraith and a TP scroll.  There's a time and a place for (just about) everything, of course, but filling one's spare inventory slots with value items is only as useful as one has spare slots... in the vast, overwhelming majority of circumstances, I would strongly prefer to begin investing in an actual game-changing item rather than reap the miniscule benefits of one more Wraithband for those few minutes before I'm forced to dump it.  Anyway, although we've seen Secret do it recently, I don't think three Wraiths on Drow is necessarily the standard, go-to build in pro games, either, but would have to verify that."

TrueDoTA2,3bovk5,tkalamov,4,Tue Jun 30 23:11:32 2015 UTC,"It's pretty clear that CK has terrible farm. Even last-hitting is unreliable until the mid game. The increased pace of 6.84 has played to CK's strengths: Farming heroes instead of supports, picking up good-value midgame items like drums/yasha/armlet to snowball into serious pickups like Manta or Heart. You even see more ults at 6, since even at worst it's a double-damage equivalent and great for pushing.  The mana sustain is a real issue, though, and you really need support to keep the pressure up. A support with Arcanes is really helpful.   Failing that, you can go Bottle or your own set of Arcanes, or if you already have HP sustain (Helm of Domination or whatever) you can pick up a Soul Ring.   Bottle is the best option; HP + mana sustain and allows you to quickly recover in between fights, plus your natural speed allows you to pick up quick runes.  Arcanes is basically a permanent solution to mana issues, at the cost of Treads.  The mana from Soul Ring allows for an instant stun or ult, so that's nice, but unless you're getting HP from somewhere it may cut into your post-fight HP regen. In addition, it's not ideal to lose 150HP just before creating a bunch of illusions. Still, it's a viable alternative if you want to keep Treads, and especially if you're also going HoD so HP sustain isn't a problem."
TrueDoTA2,3bovk5,SerpentineLogic,2,Tue Jun 30 23:37:37 2015 UTC,"Arcanes is basically a permanent solution to mana issues, at the cost of Treads.   I really think Arcanes are the best boot choice for him. It seems so counter intuitive, but he's so useless outside of physical burst until he gets several slots filled and Arcanes allows that efficiency. Soul Ring is nice at first, but will compete for slots soon enough and generally he won't have anything else that serves for adequate mana (maybe drums and an orb for Manta). Eventually the can build into his 5th item, Octarine Core, which a Manta CK really does need as it greatly improves his illusion uptime. Smart opponents will otherwise bait a Manta and then take objectives in the ~20 second downtime they're afforded."

He's quite good at killing people early, in a meta which rewards killing people early, he has mana issues in a meta where Mangos and KOTL are a thing and Bottle is now more than a mid-only item (and Soul Ring isn't bad either), hell, Slahser has shown that he can even roam early under the right circumstances. Combine that with his strong push and terrifying late game and I think he's a pretty solid choice so long as your draft includes some way for him to sustain his mana (KOTL, Io, Arcane/GG builders, supports that build bottle, etc)."

It's worth making sure one of your team mates gets Arcane boots for you if you don't plan on getting a BattleFury - this is easy to do now that Arcanes builds into Greaves.  The BattleFury is situational though - best against heroes such as PL.  Without a BattleFury Void is still perfectly viable, you just have to be really careful with your mana.

I believe bkb is what sets you far behind, unlike other bkb carries you have an awful early to mid game dps, even with maxed bashed and mom, so you would really like to complete a mjollnir or a crit, but you cant sincerely play him without a bkb (or you know, 2k mmr).  I would say, battlefury would be so good on him, maybe followed by mom into bkb and cuirass, but i fear youd be too useless for the first 15 to 20 minutes that way, and its easy to punish vreed nowadays."
TrueDoTA2,3bn0rl,RampagingRagE,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:49:07 2015 UTC,"Void is a late game carry but people are so focused on the mid and early game now with their picks that void struggles and just takes up space except when his ult is up. You have to have a team that can really secure farm for you even while you're just dead weight in the mid game up against a fuckin thousand spellcasters. Then when he does hit late he's going to be up against euls and scythes everywhere. I used to play him a lot but not anymore, he's just too easy to lockdown.   Edit: BKB helps but when it dwindles to 5 seconds you better hope you already have some rax secured because fuck the BKB nerf. It's tough for me to decide whether I'm for or against the BKB nerf... I like how late game casters are a little more viable... idk. But when I'm void in super late game, and I've been crushing it but my team never managed to secure objctives and I wasted my BKB charges and have nothing to show for it... fuck that."

You need to make your impact early in 84, and he can do that if you build your team at least partially around following up chronosphere. I don't recommend running more than 1 followup hero, simply because it can make your lineup too dependent on landing that chrono on multiple heroes.  For instance, i like a lineup like void, sky, lion, razor and an offlaner.  Outside of this ""utility carry"" role, he does seem rather weak."

TrueDoTA2,3bn0rl,wakek3k3,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:29:43 2015 UTC,"I think tangoes/quell/stout into PMS, Treads/MoM, then mael before crystalys before upgrading both to mjoll/dae gives him the best farm/damage ratio, he's the kind of hero who can afk farm jungle for 15m until someone goes to push your T1, then kill them and go back to farming. tread switching is important, but I find ONLY using the combo when it's for a kill, then taking a quick fountain trip, will overall increase your farm rate than putting 1k into a ROA, which is a good chunk of a maelstrom, or a mask + tp scroll for jungle farm.  I think playing void with 30+ salves and mek a farm-not-fight attitude makes your life the easiest, a void with just mom and treads is an easy solo killing hero, but should really be focusing on more reliable farm."
TrueDoTA2,3bn0rl,Avvulous,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:32:58 2015 UTC,"I'm no Void-picker, but one of my friends has a 60% winrate over 100 games of Void and his build is almost always Treads followed by MoM and Maelstrom into Aghs and Mjollnir (or BKB if necessary). My second-hand observation is that Aghs is a pretty key item on Void—he's just not that scary without Chrono, and with Aghs it feels like Chrono is always up. Solo Chronoing someone and still having it available for the next fight can be pretty huge in a pub. A while back after some of the nerfs, I recall ppd speculating on stream that Aghs was ""probably core"" on Void now, so there might be something to it.  Picking Void alongside heroes who can take advantage of his Chrono is probably pretty key to being successful with the hero these days. Allies with strong Chrono synergy greatly increase the value of the spell early on when Void himself doesn't have a ton of damage (or if he happens to get controlled during Chrono)."
TrueDoTA2,3bn0rl,Harlequeens,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:51:34 2015 UTC,"6.84 is the era of Drum on every AGI carry. Got buffed (cheaper), give you bulk + extra movement speed to survive gank, give aura+active to solo people in chrono + push tower, give huge int pool for every mana starving agi carry.  I especially recommend it on Void because as Void people rarely buy hp items unless it's BKB, so your Drum will take one slot until very late game, where you can replace it with other ultra late game items like Refresher, that does the same mana purpose."
TrueDoTA2,3bn0rl,unr4v3l,5,Tue Jun 30 15:32:58 2015 UTC,"Drum's DPS is still fucking underwhelming though. And the trick with void usually only having bkb for survivability in 6.82 meta is that you  A.  Used to have enough mana for refresher with 0 mana items, so aghanim was situational.  B. Thing is: you can afford to go straight DPS with Void since idea of Chrono is that you are left to hit people freely, so at most you get a bkb against something that can disrupt that. So you would usually go for as much DPS you could get without risking too much. Drum totally does not fit it."

As for the lothars/blink void, that's a solution but it still has 2 core downsides, especially in less organized play:   Damage, where is it, void is not exactly known as damageful.

TrueDoTA2,3bn0rl,lolfail9001,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:46:31 2015 UTC,"Tbh because you keep insisting on ""1 good chrono you kill everything"", well you may be good at placing chronos then sure you don't need hp at all. The problem that Drum solves is that it may give you a chance to survive gank by nukes. If you are the economist maybe instead of buying Drum you spend 75 gold on an Observer, 1000 times cheaper?  The second thing that I want to mention: the Void that lands a good chrono is already a happy Void, your team is the one that should assist with the damage. As time goes on you get more items you can start solo kills without even having teammates around. That's why Void is situational: nobody want to pick Void and 4 melee in team, they want something like Void + WD ult, Lich ult, etc. You can argue that you can land perfect chrono that traps every enemy in chrono's border, so that your allies can melee them, sure you are increasing the game's difficulty by 9999 levels.  If you don't want SB, get Blink: cheaper, not counter-able by detection. EE is one of the player who gets Blink on Void."
TrueDoTA2,3bn0rl,unr4v3l,5,Tue Jun 30 21:55:42 2015 UTC,"The problem that Drum solves is that it may give you a chance to survive gank by nukes   However what i really keep insisting is that   Drum's bonus will be really fucking marginal in those. Either you don't die by burst without drum (likely with just str pt), or you get chain-locked in which 171 HP once again is not going to do much. So, it turns out it only helps in a small marginal window and getting point booster does same job better for less. And even in that marginal case, once again, if Chrono is on cd, you don't really do much, especially if that gank has a mean of chasing to finish ya off, so turns out that Drums does not really have a good DPS niche, is outclassed on build-up basis by point booster on defensive-one and so on.   As for last one, true, and that's the tricky part: we have a hero that only provides double-edged disable and little of own damage output (also, as i have learned with time, it's actually the opposite: early on void's damage with quick MoM is much more relevant than damage of 6 slotted void in somewhat even game where void does not have 5k+ gold advantage)."

Get an extra set of tangoes and build towards a better early game item (PMS is halfway to Aquila).  Unless you really need a BKB, Void isn't looking for one single item to come ""online"", like Spectre/Naga Radiance, LC Blink, or PA BKB, you can actually get several cheaper items before saving for top tier DPS.  These cheaper items make you stronger in skirmishes early and make you more dangerous heading into mid game.  My item progression in games where I don't require BKB before 25 minutes is Aquila->boots->MoM->Drums->finish Treads.  You are very dangerous with Aquila+Drums+Treads+MoM, with TP and building towards Mjolnir as your 5-6 slots.  Selling Aquila and eventually Drums for Deadalus or BKB isn't bad economics if they helped you survive a gank or get a couple kills before 25 minutes.  *note: if you require BKB before 25 minutes, Void probably wasn't the right choice.  Other heroes like Luna and PA utilize BKB better because their kits give them better damage early/mid game."

Too many good things to pass up: 18dmg, 4 armor (including agility), a bit of mana/regen and hp.  Drums vs. Treads: for 950, you can have 9 of one stat.  Or, you can have 6S/3A/9I for 975 and be 875 from 9 of all stats.  The 975 gives you 9 more total stats, and the 875 gives 9 total stats, same as treads.  Yes, 30AS is good.  But you have MoM, or are getting it next item.  In a lane which is not heavily contested, I would rather have Aquila and brown boots than Treads.  I would much rather have Aquila, boots and Bracer than Treads and PMS."
TrueDoTA2,3bn0rl,James_McNulty,-3,Tue Jun 30 16:27:35 2015 UTC,"I go tangos+PMS right out the gate, then treads and MoM. Quelling blade is pretty useless now. If you really need it to get last hits I'd suggest practicing your last hitting more.  From MoM i go Maelstrom into Crystallis/Daedalus. This gives you a huge midgame presence. I almost always skip BKB unless they have 3 stun heroes on their team. Otherwise I just make sure to chrono the heroes with stun.  Farming the jungle with MoM gives you lots of freedom to move out of lane to farm. I usually just save my Chrono to get a free kill here and there off any supports who get nearby, but focus on farming as a priority.  Maelstrom into Daedalus gives you insane DPS for relatively cheap, not to mention Crystallis gives you a really nice boost before you get to Daed.  Faceless can snowball pretty easy midgame by leaving lane to jungle and then jumping back in lane to gank any supports that appear trying to farm it.  With MoM alone you should be able to take supports down from 100-0 pretty easily in a chrono.  All of the items I listed ramp up with their ingredients, so grabbing MoM, then a gloves of haste and blades of attack isn't a bad idea either if you want to spend your gold and give your self some little boosts as you build your items."

QB is for accelerating your jungle and pushing faster, not to help you CS. It is mandatory on a hard carry like Void because you should spend a lot of time farming lanes and both jungles in between engagements. Hell, you say this yourself 2 paragraphs down.   Otherwise I just make sure to chrono the heroes with stun.   This is just not feasible in most games at a decent MMR. People expect the chrono and will spread out when pushing, making a good chrono extremely difficult. BKB is a high priority after a farming item or two (typically MoM/Midas/Maelstrom/Battlefury).   grabbing MoM, then a gloves of haste and blades of attack isn't a bad idea either if you want to spend your gold and give your self some little boosts as you build your items.   Stick/Wand should usually take priority over random gloves of haste or blades of attack unless your farm is ridiculous. If you're going to have a casual component in your inventory it should help keep you in lane like perserverance or protect you from ganks like ogre club.  Generally speaking this is a pipedream guide for void. very rarely will games go in a direction that lets you itemize the way you describe with any degree of success."

This is just my own build that revolves around rushing DPS and snowballing off low-risk chronosphere kills. I have had good success with it, but my playstyle sounds different from yours.  I play with my friends a lot one of which plays a lot of str initiation heroes. Generally he will initiate, and right before they can recover from the first salvo of damage I will timewalk and pop a chrono to pick off one or two.   I don't know if it's just my MMR, but after the initiation they tend to focus my friend, usually now out of position and more clumped together.  Like I said, I've had success.

TrueDoTA2,3bn0rl,TravUK,4,Tue Jun 30 16:08:33 2015 UTC,Quelling blade is super useful for speeding up your jungling. If it was just a crutch for last hitting then pros would ever get it.
TrueDoTA2,3bn0rl,ltran96,-6,Tue Jun 30 20:59:41 2015 UTC,"It's a waste of an inventory slot imo.  You can buy it if you want, but with my build I like to go PMS > Treads > MoM > Blades of Attack > Gloves of Haste into Maelstrom.  This leaves one slot available for TP scroll.  You can get quelling instead of Blades of Attack, but I much rather have the damage vs heroes paired with my MoM to secure chrono kills.  MoM and Maelstrom help you farm the jungle pretty easily without quelling."
TrueDoTA2,3bn0rl,Phritz777,5,Tue Jun 30 16:16:52 2015 UTC,except the fact that it helps so much when you're farming creeps by speeding up things a ton.

It's just my own opinion but PMS+tangos starting items are huge help for a squishy carry like Faceless in the early game.  Quelling blade really is pretty useless compared to PMS while you're last hitting creeps and getting harassed.  This goes for almost all melee agi carries.
TrueDoTA2,3bn0rl,Phritz777,2,Tue Jun 30 17:01:37 2015 UTC,Being able to cut paths through the jungle can accelerate that phase as well though.   PMS vs quelling is a different debate....but it is a high impact / low cost item on carries
TrueDoTA2,3bn0rl,sedsnewoldg,3,Tue Jun 30 17:42:50 2015 UTC,"If you think QB is useless for last hitting then your MMR isn't high enough to where it matters again. In a vaccuum of course you don't need a QB. But being able to kill a creep with 70 damage is way more useful then 55. Now they send a deny attack when its at 70~ with a projectile on the way, they get the hit or deny, and you can't stop it unless you split the timing perfect. With a QB, you just hit and because you hit hard enough that your timing window is that much larger then theirs."

TrueDoTA2,3bn7z4,a_sloth,2,Wed Jul 1 11:24:36 2015 UTC,"In my opinion she is really strong at the moment, especially in pubs. The meta, to me, seems to fairly rewarding of early game pressure, more so than the previous patches, which rewarded the enemies for making one or two catch up kills. Now this is somewhat gone, I think we will even potentially start to see Enchantress back in the competitive scene more, with her ability to take towers, coordinate key ganks and remain a relevant hero into the lategame.  Position I like top play her in the Dire jungle, utilising the creeps and a smoke to gank your safelane, and help get your carry rolling. I don't bother with Midas, as the gold you'll get from one or two ganks is enough to start snowballing. She is equally relevant on the Radiant side, this is just a personal preference, as I feel it is much easier to wrap around on the radiant offlaners.   Ganking mid I think a pretty important thing is when playing Enchantress is thinking about whether to gank mid or not, as the current meta is full of mids like QoP, who are basically impossible to gank because of blink, or Bristleback, because of his innate tankiness. Be careful not to completely waste of your time. However, if you can get the early centaur stomp on a Storm Spirit, resulting in a kill, that's really great, remember to utilise smokes and wrap around from behind.  Pressure In my experience, you gotta push hard and fast with her in this meta, as the benefits of taking just a few towers are really big. Grab some good wave clearing creeps like a Satyr Tormenter, or a Dark Troll Summoner, as those skeletons are awesome little pushers. You can also apply pressure by arriving in the mid game teamfights, throwing out some Impetus attacks (which deal great damage if you have good positioning) and more importantly, slowing the enemy right clickers through untouchable. Nature's attendants is a pretty nice heal as well.  Going lategame I'd say you need to avoid this as much as possible, as enchantress has always had a tendency to fall off in the late game, but recent buffs to her ultimate mean she can at least stay somewhat relevant as a damage dealer even when BKB's start to come into play. At this point, look into picking up some attack speed items to improve your Impetus DPS and some control/team fight items such as Sheep stick, which has the added benefit ofi ncreasing your mana pool for all that Impetus spam.  This are just my thoughts on the hero, and how she fits into the Meta, take into account I'm in no way a great player, and I tend not to play a huge amount of Enchantress, this is just what I've gathered from some recent games as her."
TrueDoTA2,3bn7z4,dotamonkey24,2,Tue Jun 30 23:26:46 2015 UTC,"I think enchantress is a lot stronger right now. Just doesn't matchup well for a few reasons.  Ganking mid is hard  There is the good thing about SF, Lesh, and storm being good hank targets.   But we also have QOP and bristle back being popular. Not to mention and of the above heroes can turn a fight if a Tp supports, especially in competitive.   She does have the HP to handle burst nukes   She can space all she wants. QOP and gyro will still fire away at you.   Jungle gold sucks now  It's harder to justify farming jungle right now. Enoch doesn't farm half of games because she can get good aggressive creeps. But the option to get level 6 at 5 minutes will get less gold now.   Chen can do it because he really needs level 7 more than anything. I hardly see enigma now for example."

TrueDoTA2,3bn7z4,wildtarget13,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:45:11 2015 UTC,"She's quite strong early and flexible in regards in the laning phase and build. I do like Necro on her similar to Slasher but I think she's more helpful to the team supporting in the safelane where she has access to the jungle plus she's a great zoning support able to trade hits with most heroes, and of course with the right creep can even get some kills. I think offlane should be reserved for heroes who need lvls more than farm, needs a quick lv6, etc., but if your team doesn't have another offlaner she can offlane sure.  I think her low overall win % is attributable to ppl building her like a right-clicker, and also of course due to most heroes with minions having low win %. I view her more like an offensive Chen, you should be securing a strong laning phase and pushing early to end the game or at the very least obtain early map control by taking down towers early. In that respect I think she's a pretty good for the current meta where early fighting is so emphasized."
TrueDoTA2,3bn7z4,Skyro620,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:01:56 2015 UTC,I had a monster early game with her a few days ago (4 minute midas off of two early game kills) and we still lost because we just couldn't keep up with storm and specter.  Not a fan of her even with the new buffs.  http://www.dotabuff.com/matches/1592467069
TrueDoTA2,3bn7z4,alexja21,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:01:26 2015 UTC,"Right now, if you use 4 role chant, you want to take a rax within about 25-30 minutes. She's more than capable of doing this, but not with a midas. It's just not the right item for her.  Chant has a powerful first few levels, then a weak mid game, and a very good late game. Midas brings her weak mid game sooner, and gets her to late game faster. The problem is, her early game is stronger, and you give up a big part of that by going for the midas rather than early game value items to continue to press. Then, oft times, you'll lose because you either don't get to the late game, or your late game isn't good enough once you get there (you deal plenty of damage, but you're still pretty easy to kill, even with untouchable)"
TrueDoTA2,3bn7z4,goblinbiddin,1 point,Wed Jul 1 06:19:11 2015 UTC,"Try rushing Atos+Treads. Aghs does damage, but doesn's matter if you have no soft initiation. Enchant (the spell that slows/enchants) is good, but usually people will be better at spacing from that compared to Atos.   Storm might've been the actual time to try the necrobook build Slasher thinks is good (it's not, but it is the most effective mana burn).   Also don't midas. Staying alive is your midas. Enchantress can gain momentum in her GPM by staying alive and dishing out constant damage with a big mana pool (not regen, pool). She doesn't need levels as badly as she needs stats, HP, or MP. Once she's level 7 or 11, you are fine. I would rather you shadowblade or Atos than midas. Or something like Pipe or Orchid as you contribute so much damage to teamfights anyways if you have correct items to survive and right click a hero."
TrueDoTA2,3bn7z4,wildtarget13,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:53:11 2015 UTC,"Absolutely chant is viable in this meta. She has perhaps the biggest impact at levels 1 and 2 of any hero in the game, in a very ""win now"" patch.  The best way to play her at this point is probably the old pre TI1 Na'Vi ""Jungle Aggro Trilane"" with her in the enemy jungle rotating in for kills and then transitioning into taking out the tower. Then you either rotate mid, or pressure the T2, all the while taking away their ability to use their own jungle and safelane, and making mid very vulnerable.   If this works, you'll end up starting to starve out their farm around 8 minutes, and can easily transition into a win from there. 1 position lesh is very good for this type of draft. With the 6.84 rubber banding nerfs, there's not a whole lot wrong with this way of playing (it is a bit all in, of course)."
TrueDoTA2,3bn7z4,goblinbiddin,1 point,Wed Jul 1 05:21:43 2015 UTC,"She gets countered by every popular mid and carry. Even undy reks her. Wait until popular mids are TA, PA, etc. Then she will shine again."

TrueDoTA2,3blv48,DangerAwar,2,Tue Jun 30 07:22:47 2015 UTC,"Its game dependant I think. There are some matchups she does well in, I think she is good vs storm and Qop (mirror image purges Shadow strike I think(?)) especially if you can last hit and harass with  rip tide.   The big issue comes when the lanes break down, how much space will you have to get the rest of the farm you need for your core items what with games seemingly having more early aggression now.  Overall I think she is in a reasonable place at the moment but I think there are better mids."
TrueDoTA2,3blv48,TheMoeBlob,2,Tue Jun 30 10:12:41 2015 UTC,"Mirror image will purge shadow strike.  It will also disjoint shadow strike if you cast it while it is inid air, dodging the initial damage too."
TrueDoTA2,3blv48,UNBR34K4BL3,7,Tue Jun 30 12:44:09 2015 UTC,"Thing is, it forces you to use it on a low cooldown spell.

So is Leshrac and storm imo, hence why it's still a really situationnal pick."

TrueDoTA2,3blv48,Pentt41207,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:53:49 2015 UTC,"Sort of, it depends how good your naga is.  I think it's one of the higher skill ceiling and can win games by herself.  I had a naga mid win our game essentially with 600 cs in 40 mins with radiance rush.  Creep skipping really screwed up their pushes a few times when they should have raxed us.    Of course the flip side of this is that it can limit other's farm on the team by pushing the waves.  So if the other cores can get away with less farm and be effective it can be good imo."

So when you talk about mid game and late game viability, it's irrelevant to the topic of conversation. Past the laning phase, naga farm is gonna be the same if it was a safe lane naga or a mid lane naga. That's a completely different conversation."
TrueDoTA2,3blv48,CharlesIndigo,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:05:12 2015 UTC,"I think /u/Hartwall's point is that Naga is also a good support. So her having a better mid/lategame with octarine gives her more potential as a core than previously, making mid and safelane naga that much more viable. He is contrasting it to the option of support naga, not safelae. So yes OP asked about mid Naga, but octarine core making Naga a more viable core makes her more viable mid since it is a core position."

They are not exclusive but sure as hell are different.   And it's not like qop and lesh are mids every game   Naga does not do exactly great against storm or SF either. I mean, she will do decent against SF early on but after few levels, it becomes a hell unless you are rtz-good."
TrueDoTA2,3bm2qu,Hjortur95,5,Tue Jun 30 09:07:03 2015 UTC,Depends how you play him. I never get more than 1 in fissure if I take him mid against an easy matchup. But if I'm going to be spamming fissure as a safe lane support without a second stun to let me get close then its worth getting soul ring and maxing it.
TrueDoTA2,3bm2qu,Thefelix01,1 point,Tue Jun 30 09:28:59 2015 UTC,yeah i mostly run him in a kill lane with a partner. Never solo. I buy half the supporting items at start but no wards until blink or if i'm having a rough game it's wards after soul ring tranquils.
TrueDoTA2,3bm2qu,Defiled-,5,Tue Jun 30 09:34:30 2015 UTC,"I'd like to think I know Shaker fairly well - 65.79% winrate over 38 games and that's without the whole 'critshaker' build thing (think I've tried that once, not a fan).  Sorry to sound like a broken record but as always, it depends on hero line ups. For example, if you are playing with a Pudge or Mirana, generally speaking you will want to level up Fissure. The extra stun time can make the difference between the hook/arrow landing.  If you are looking to lock down a hero like Slark I personally think the Aftershock levels are much better. It makes Enchant Totem very good at locking down heroes up close and of course also makes your ultimate a stun when in range.  The other factor is how well the laning phase is going for you. If it's going well and you're picking up a decent amount of gold and experience (enough for say, a soul ring fairly early) I would definitely suggest you level up fissure. This will help you farm up the blink and apply constant pressure to heroes from a safe distance.  If the early game has been disastrous then a good Echo Slam is going to be what saves your game. Echo Slam is still good on it's own but I think Aftershock is really what makes the ultimate as strong as can be. Fissure is of course still an extremely powerful tool in team fights but I think the small increase in stun and decent damage increase is negligible in comparison."
TrueDoTA2,3bm2qu,Avvulous,1 point,Tue Jun 30 11:26:22 2015 UTC,"81.82% over 22 games.  I'd agree with everything you've said here, if it's a grey area i like to get 1-1-1 then max fissure into aftershock, i feel if you're playing ES primarily for damage you've mispicked, and if you're in a situation where 4+ seconds of stun wont land the kill then you shouldn't be in there anyway."
TrueDoTA2,3bm2qu,Defiled-,1 point,Tue Jun 30 13:45:01 2015 UTC,Ah yes I should have added that to my post - I think 1-1-1 is 100% the way to go. I don't think I ever skill anything differently.

If you're dealing with slark you'd want to max fissure so you have increased damage and stun time (since you can usually fissure from fog.)   The other factor is how well the laning phase is going for you. If it's going well and you're picking up a decent amount of gold and experience (enough for say, a soul ring fairly early) I would definitely suggest you level up fissure.

TrueDoTA2,3bm2qu,Defiled-,1 point,Tue Jun 30 11:58:14 2015 UTC,But being able to land a fissure on him isn't going to mean anything if you don't have the proper follow up. With levels in aftershock you can stun him every 5 seconds alone with Enchant totem and that's without mentioning Fissure or your ultimate.  To lock down Slark you want to be close to him and keep constantly stunning him to waste the time of his ultimate. After that he should be fine to deal with.
TrueDoTA2,3bm2qu,warrentheape,2,Tue Jun 30 15:14:43 2015 UTC,Should you be ganking Slark without a proper follow up though? He's propably at least a couple levels and items above you.
TrueDoTA2,3bm2qu,Defiled-,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:16:04 2015 UTC,By proper follow up I was mainly referring to heroes that can specifically continue the lockdown.
TrueDoTA2,3bm2qu,Axosh,4,Tue Jun 30 22:24:41 2015 UTC,"Fissure is really your main spell though. It is the primary spell you use for ganking and setting up kills. It is also either the longest ranged (or close to it) stun in the game. Prior to Blink, it is also going to be your one guaranteed contribution to fights.  Realistically, if you are able to get on top of targets to make aftershock useful, then either:   The other team fucked up Your team has a lot of stun/disable   The nature of the hero is that you want every fissure to count, and fissure is a really strong spell. If you aren't landing good fissures it is going to feel like you are mana starved because you are blowing your mana on nothing. And that's often what you see - people not getting much out of their spells, becoming underleveled and underfarmed, and then hurting because of the mana cost.  Additionally, if you watch high level players, they use their spells and especially regen very differently. A lot of newer players pop regen basically when they are not at 100%. Better players take advantage of natural regen (even if it is really low) until they absolutely need to use regen, while also making sure they take advantage of all the regen they brought to lane. Their spell usage is also much more calculated, so a fissure would only come out if it had a high probability to make something happen. In contrast, I see a lot of newer players throw out fissure almost as if to harass."
TrueDoTA2,3bm2qu,XyfDota,3,Tue Jun 30 17:02:22 2015 UTC,"Before you get 6 and Blink Dagger most fights all you do is land a Fissure. And that early game is one of Shakers power peaks that you shouldn't sacrifice. Let me go into detail of why I think 4-1-1-1 is the best build for support ES.   Mana: Its 15 more per level. Barely 1 int worth, not the end of the world. You are going to need mana regeneration no matter what build. Most players go 1-1-1 in most situations, its only at level 4 you will see any difference in mana cost. Do the maths before a fight starts, buy a few Clarities for early game, and a couple of Branches or a Mango for if you need it for Slam.  Aggressively: The block is the most important thing. But if you can't get a complete block off you often wont even be able to get into range to use Enchant Totem and Aftershock at all. The longer stun duration can allow other heroes to position better to follow up a missed block. Also helps against heroes who don't care about the block.  Defensively: In a lot of situations you can't get the block. Maybe you aren't in the right position, your ally will also be blocked or maybe you can block the first enemy, but the others won't be stunned. A longer stun is more effective if you focus on stunning all the enemy heroes and not worrying about the block.  Ideal situation: You land the block and have time to walk in and land Totem+Shock. Lets compare 1-1-4-1 vs 4-1-1-1.   You won't get the Aftershock damage from the initial Fissure, as you will be out of range. You will get 1 use from Enchant Totem and 1 use from Echo Slam, if available. (Note: These numbers don't take into account Enchant Totem and Echo Slam damage as they are the same for each build)   With just Fissure and Enchant Totem:   4-1-1-1 will deal 325 damage and stun for 2.35 seconds.  1-1-4-1 will deal 250 damage and stun for 2.5 seconds.    With Fissure, Enchant Totem and Echo Slam:   4-1-1-1 will deal 375 damage and stun for 2.95 seconds. 1-1-4-1 will deal 375 damage and stun for 4 seconds.   1-1-4-1 deals a less damage in nearly every in game situation and only gives a noticeably longer stun duration when you get to land both Totem and Echo, but even then deals the same damage.   In the right situation you get an extra second of stun. That's huge. But keep in mind that's only when you land both Aftershocks within its small 300 radius. 1-1-4-1 gives you far less time to position for any Aftershock damage and even then you will only be able to land it on one hero in most cases. While 4-1-1-1 gives you and extra 150 damage and .75 seconds stun duration in a large and easy to land AoE. It might seem counter intuitive but higher levels in Fissure will help more in 90% of team fights as well as being easier to gank with.  Post-Blink: Once you have Blink Dagger these numbers are irrelevant. Chances are you will already be level 10+ with Fissure and Aftershock maxed.  To summarise; max Aftershock before Fissure relies on landing lots of Aftershocks, which is unlikely in most fights. It can work well if you have a lot of follow up that allows you to position, you are against a lot of melee heroes, your enemies suck, you have a Dark Seer/Axe/Enigma/Magnus, you get Blink before level 10 or your enemies suck. Even then, consider something like 2-1-3-1 over 1-1-4-1. The extra mana isn't actually that much and it is worth the utility. Just manage it wisely."
TrueDoTA2,3bm2qu,QuasiTD,2,Fri Jul 3 00:13:19 2015 UTC,"Scrub thoughts ahead!!  I play about 3200mmr so take this as what it is, my ES winrate is current 58.54% with 41 games played. I've been finding myself levelling up aftershock more and more rather than extra levels of fissure. It does depend a bit, of the other team has some kind of gap closer, Slark pounce, PA blink type stuff, then usually I'll go 1-2-2-1 or 1-1-3-1. If not then it's usually a 2-1-2-1 and rarely do I go 3-1-1-1  Why Aftershock  One of the big things that extra points in Aftershock gets you is a combo lockdown. If you don't have 2 points in aftershock, then if you manage to get an echo in the middle of them, be it invis runes or whatever, then they have a chance to interrupt your next cast.   With 2 points I believe the mini-stun is long enough that your casts can go off and you can do the full, Echo/enchant/fissure combo. I know for sure 3 points in aftershock is enough.  Why not 3-1-1-1  If you go soulring ES(again something I find myself doing more than arcane rush) then assuming you want to do a full combo at level 6, Echoslam(145) + Enchant(20)+Enchant(125/140/155) Then your total mana costs are:  1-1-3-1 : 290 1-2-2-1 : 300 2-1-2-1 : 305 3-1-1-1 : 320  ES at level 6 has 325 mana if you just have Brown Boots + soulring. Yes, I admit going arcanes changes this equation quite a bit with the extra 200 mana passive from that, let alone the active.   A few things here, Soulring active is +150 mana, so if you are 3-1-1-1 and you start with 100% mana, you can actually get out a fissure when the CD is done, an entirely possible option if your team wins a fight. However, more useful in my mind is that in 1-1-3-1 you now have enough mana for a second use of enchant totem(short CD is Awesome!) and can use your soulring for a fissure at the end to prevent someone from running.  Again this isn't the end all, be all, but just some thoughts from my experiences."
TrueDoTA2,3bm2qu,maximum_wages,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:57:28 2015 UTC,"I have been debating the same thing. I think its best to go max fissure first. It scales well enough. Also, echo slam + fissure + stomp is more stun time with maxed fissure for follow up damage when you are with company and its more damage if there aren't a bunch of creeps/heroes nearby. That extra second or so of stun can be pretty critical along with the more reliable damage."
TrueDoTA2,3bm2qu,Dat_Speed,1 point,Wed Jul 1 05:11:29 2015 UTC,"4.5k MMR with 65% winrate es here. I always max fissure first as support es because the long range aoe stun+dmg is worth more than the 300 radius stun/dmg until you get blink. Usually I get blink around lvl 9 or 10, so maxing fissure first is overall more effective. Sometimes I will do lvl 3 fissure, lvl 2 shock, lvl 2 totem, then max aftershock if I want to focus on a single hero (like slark or bs). It really depends how the other team is playing.  In terms of traquil vs arcanes, if my team is mana hungry (like lesh/zeus/storm/necro) I will go early arcane+ring of regen because this gives me a strong early advantage and greaves are really good on es. Otherwise tranquil+soul ring is better."
TrueDoTA2,3bl5qz,SerpentineLogic,7,Tue Jun 30 02:53:25 2015 UTC,"The beauty of Aghs is that it can have different effects for different heroes. That's why there doesn't need to be one singular design goal.  Let's put the different types of Agh's upgrades into 3 categories:  Must-have: Some heroes, mostly supports, can view Aghanim's as an (almost) must-have item, with no alternative really beating Aghs, so they'll rush it as first or second big item. Ancient Apparition and Witch Doctor are good examples. Those are often heroes that don't really have a specific need (except for the basic defensive utility every support wants), so Aghanim's can be a massive upgrade.  Good, but Optional: Other heroes have Aghanim's as a good, but optional item that they might get after some other important items. Heroes like Brewmaster or Invoker come to mind: Lower-position cores that really like the stats and other bonuses from Aghs, but got a big set of other, more important items to go for. That's why, from a design perspective, the Agh's is not supposed to be overly powerful. You do not want people to be forced to go for Aghanim's.  Highly situational: The last class of Agha upgrades are those that are entirely situational. LC, FV, Huskar or Gyro are all good examples here. The Aghanim's effects are not necessarily weak, but you usually go for low utility/high stats items on these heroes, massive items that help you increase your combat potential by giving raw damage output or survivability. Yet if you strive for more utility or if the situation  demands it, you can go for Aghanim's to adapt. This not only opens new item options, but also new playstyles. The position ~3-4 Gyrocopter that gets Aghanim's mid-late against a splitpushing Broodmother, LC that gets it against Pudge with 4k HP or the slightly-too-beefy Enigma and so on."
TrueDoTA2,3bl5qz,Infrisios,2,Tue Jun 30 07:06:52 2015 UTC,I don't really disagree with what you said but I was reading about how Octarine core pretty much makes Agh's Invoker useless.
TrueDoTA2,3bl5qz,kryonik,2,Tue Jun 30 20:22:45 2015 UTC,"Useless might  be a bit of an exaggeration, but the introduction of Octarine Core certainly shifted the balance of various Aghanim's upgrades.

On top of that, Core reduces cooldown on all of your spells, grants more attack damage and gives you spell lifesteal. I honestly can't imagine why you would spend 4200 gold to reduce your Invoke cooldown only another 1.25 seconds."
TrueDoTA2,3bl5qz,kryonik,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:53:46 2015 UTC,"Perhaps I assumed something which I thought was incredibly ovious. If you had both Aghs would reduce to 2 and OC would further reduce to 1.5. That's just more spells cast, can get through more spells in a fight."

TrueDoTA2,3bl5qz,Mezkh,2,Tue Jun 30 10:29:33 2015 UTC,The only situation I can think of where the Aghs is useful is when the enemy team have very tanky caster heroes.
TrueDoTA2,3bl5qz,mieeel,2,Tue Jun 30 08:26:26 2015 UTC,"Aghs LC isn't meant to be a core item, but a hugely situation pickup. This is what you're hinting at when you mention it won't let you win bad matchups (like a blademail might.)  However it's a mistake to only get it for heroes like Centaur or Bristleback. As long as you've been getting duel damage here and there against enemy supports, Aghs allows you to keep on solo fighting heroes like Weaver, Ember, QoP, Earth Spirit, Tinker, etc.  For many of those heroes, their first priority in game will be to tank up enough to survive your regular Duel (Skadi for Ember, BS for Tinker, Aghs or Shivas for QoP) because Doom is such a detriment to their play style.  Aghs allows you to keep on killing them after they've grabbed that ""survival"" item. A 6-slotted Ember that is ratting your side lanes will survive your duel and ult away, but as long as your net worth isn't ages behind his, you can opt to get Aghs and you'll kill him."

TrueDoTA2,3bl5qz,HeavenAndHellD2arg,2,Tue Jun 30 12:59:03 2015 UTC,"It's a super situational pick that didn't work out. It's heralded as pretty dumb. It's good if you can catch someone hard to kill that is way out of position.   Say an abaddon is split-pushing, he splits, gets caught, pops bkb and tp's out. Even if you duel him he'll live through his ult, just can't kill him right? Well if you're lc and can survive through his ult(presumably because you have lifesteal) then an aghs lets you fight forever, and kill him eventually.   If they have teammates anywhere near him, it's awful. It should never be useful, but you could come up with niche situations"
TrueDoTA2,3bl5qz,punriffer5,2,Tue Jun 30 14:54:18 2015 UTC,"Aghs LC is pretty terrible, as usually if the duel doesn't end after the stated duration, it's because something horrible happened and you're going to die. It's actually bad enough that in most cases I'd tell my alch to literally never give me one.  I'll agree that Aghs LC is much different than most aghs, but they've sort of been playing around with this sort of thing quite a bit. If an item isn't good on a hero, that's not necessarily a design issue tho, sometimes items aren't good on heroes."

TrueDoTA2,3bll2u,GgMc,6,Tue Jun 30 18:09:05 2015 UTC,"Glimmer cape is THE MOST CORE ITEM on her out of any hero. Cold Embrace + Glimmer means someone on your team is unkillable for 6 seconds. Your main skill to level is almost always Splinter Blast.  It depends on who the biggest problem is, how they're all arranged and how many you can grab. Remember, any hero that isn't the target of your ult takes reduced damage by 70%."
TrueDoTA2,3bll2u,CptFastbreak,2,Tue Jun 30 06:09:59 2015 UTC,"I used to max splinter first, but it's not very good to harrass since it pushes the lane. For zoning I find it's much better to max arctic burn first, because of cooldown reduction and damage increase. Now I only max splinter first if I want to farm a lot myself, or if I'm against a brood."
TrueDoTA2,3bll2u,freelance_fox,2,Tue Jun 30 22:58:58 2015 UTC,"I think this glimmer cape spamming mentality is totally cancer to WW. Like what did you guys who play her as a hard support build on her last patch? I find that playing her greedily and going for something like a slow mid-game Orchid or a Blink to make aggressive plays usually pays off better in the long-run. Obviously if your team ever needs a glimmer cape WW is the top choice in many aspects, but she has mana issues unless you get a mana item or two and can make good use of lots of other items too. Blindly buying glimmer cape every game is not a good idea, and the item definitely isn't ""abolutely core"" on WW in the way most people talk about it."
TrueDoTA2,3bll2u,WellHungMan,2,Wed Jul 1 16:55:08 2015 UTC,"Glimmer is one of the best items this patch, and has perfect synergy with cold embrace, which is why almost everyone advocates it."
TrueDoTA2,3bll2u,GgMc,0,Wed Jul 1 17:50:52 2015 UTC,"Well shitty attitude about glimmer cape aside... if you're building blink, then your item choice is almost always wrong you should be building a force in place of the blink and if you get enough farm after that then build towards a blink/mek/medallion etc."
TrueDoTA2,3bll2u,gu3st12,3,Wed Jul 1 16:59:59 2015 UTC,"I tend to build towards a refresher on her. 2 ults in a fight is ridiculously good, especially in the late game.  My usual items are soul ring => Tranqs => Glimmer Cape => Force Staff (sometimes Blink if I have loads of gold) => Refresher"
TrueDoTA2,3bll2u,Cal1gula,2,Tue Jun 30 06:51:37 2015 UTC,"I really like the full support. Mek, glimmer, arcane boots. Maybe Urn (good to combo with the dot). Force is also good. I suppose blink if you have no initiator she can do it in a pinch. I don't think she's a great ganker. I usually harass a lot in lane when Q is up. Otherwise get 1 in Embrace to heal/save the carry, and pull a lot. She's pretty good in the offlane because you can use burn as an escape too. I usually alternate leveling burn and splinter. The cooldown reduction on burn is helpful. Splinter pushes the wave so I try not to use that unless going in for a gank. I don't usually use Curse on the carry. I try to get the carry in the buff so they kill a support. Don't be afraid to use it if you catch someone out of position though. You can easily get your team into a 5v4 situation with it."
TrueDoTA2,3bll2u,maximum_wages,1 point,Tue Jun 30 06:42:44 2015 UTC,"If you can get the carry in the radius of the ult buff, its probably better to use it on a different hero because you are still stunning both heroes but the other carry is going to do some of the work for you, while the support or utility hero isn't going to burn through as much HP. Mathematically, its more efficient to do it that way as long as you catch the carry every time."

TrueDoTA2,3bj6r5,TheRockObama,8,Mon Jun 29 17:41:43 2015 UTC,"God I feel like I'm an expert on carrying from behind due to the way normal queue works at 3-5 am.  One of my last games I was teamed with 3 people who normally play normal bracket, myself very high, and one other unknown, against a team of almost all people who were routinely in very high.  They concluded we lost because I didn't get battlefury on AM and just went for manta.  Not the 6-16 LC or 3-15 CM.    Anyway.  If you're behind as a carry the best thing you can do is not die while still getting exp.  Simple as that.  Change your plan.  Normally as a carry I aim for one early item boots and then something medium to big (something like Aquila Treads Diffusal or Urn Treads Radiance), but when I'm behind I have found it much more successful to just say fuck it and pick up that extra small item or two.  e.g. my last spectre game I ended up against some stupid Tusk + Undying + whatever aggro trilane and I was solo for whatever reason.  Obviously radiance not an option, so I just went for bracer, treads, aquila, yasha->manta.  Basically cheap items at first with easy buildup.  The tide started to turn after the aquila or I woulda made drums also.   In general the biggest thing is to just not die, still get that aoe exp if you can, jungle where you can, and keep some sort of progression and hope to god that your team can take advantage of the fact that the enemy team is committing so many resources to shutting you down.   Doesn't always work.  Sometimes you lose all lanes.  In those cases if you don't have a good wombo combo or the enemy team knows how to effectively splitpush, you may not be able to do anything.    But in general it is a) survival, b) alter your plan.  Definitely doesn't always work, but it's been my most successful method."
TrueDoTA2,3bj6r5,Drop_,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:17:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah there definitely isn't a foolproof solution to this problem. I just find that when I'm behind and the entire enemy team is missing, I have to back (and so does everyone else on my team).  Do you think the answer is for maybe 2 people to show themselves in different lanes and push so if one of us gets ganked, at least the other is still farming (vs. 0 people farming because we're all in base)?"
TrueDoTA2,3bj6r5,Drop_,2,Mon Jun 29 21:04:04 2015 UTC,"Depends on how far behind you are and which point in the game.  If you have a viable escape mechanic and bots maybe, but if they have bots and can cover a lot of ground fast it's a huge risk.    A single pickoff can lead to lost rax in my experience."
TrueDoTA2,3bj6r5,goblinbiddin,7,Mon Jun 29 21:18:29 2015 UTC,"Ok, it seems like you're having trouble against heavy ganking lineups, once they get a few ganks off. One thing that is very important to note is that once a pickoff lineup gets pickoffs, they become difficult to stop, so crushing their lanes (ganking lineups are often vulnerable in the laning phase) is usually the best option.  Once you do fall behind tho, you're right about one very important thing: you can't do anything with no vision of them. However, you CAN force them to show themselves while not ganking. The solution is this: Flash down waves and keep the creeps as far away from your buildings as you can.   The enemy then has the choice to go push the lanes back out, or let their towers take free damage. Usually they will go defend their towers from pushing creeps. Obviously it's important to flash down the wave quickly and then GET OUT before they have time to react and gank you.  Every time you throw out a lane, you're getting some farm (which is part of what their ganking lineup is trying to prevent you from doing) and you're forcing them to spread out and/or show themselves. Don't worry about the fact that you're giving them farm too; they were gonna get farm, and you weren't, and now you both are: that's better for you.  If you continue playing in this way, eventually the vision you get from creeps will expand and allow you to more easily move into your own jungle and deward. If they continue to try to hold on to everything, you have a chance to catch them out 5v3 or something similar and get yourselves back into the game.  Short version: get the creeps away from your base, without dying, they will push for you and create space. Use the space to get back into the game. It won't work every time: If you could win from behind every time, you wouldn't really be behind. It just gives you a chance to make some plays and get back into it."
TrueDoTA2,3bj6r5,unr4v3l,2,Mon Jun 29 21:14:49 2015 UTC,Pray to our team that they carry tp to get a return kill if our opponents decide to dive towers to kill you.
TrueDoTA2,3bj6r5,JOJOFACE,2,Tue Jun 30 00:23:29 2015 UTC,I feel like this is the best advice. Having a mid or offlaner with a tp to counter gank the inevitable dives can REALLY stop or reverse a snowballing lineup.
TrueDoTA2,3bj6r5,goblinbiddin,1 point,Tue Jun 30 09:54:54 2015 UTC,I feel like the OP is talking about a point later in the game than this.
TrueDoTA2,3bj6r5,generho,3,Tue Jun 30 23:26:22 2015 UTC,"I'm not a high skill carry player, but maybe you should draft slippery carries like Slark, AM and PA (blur hides her on the minimal so she can aggressively farm). That way they fail their ganks more.  I mostly play support and when they have strong ganking lineups, buying a glimmer cape as a support can help you strongly disengage. Use it on allies liberally. Forcestaff also is godly.  At a tactical level, you can possibly rat them with furion, kotl or naga and that will starve them out of kill xp and gold and make it difficult for them to leave the base.  None of these are hard and fast solutions and boil down to execution so practice makes perfect."
TrueDoTA2,3bj6r5,unr4v3l,2,Mon Jun 29 18:09:41 2015 UTC,"I believe even at 2k people know to group up and ward aggressively to make solo ganker like Slark useless (because if Slark decides to get SB and wastes time to find solo target but couldn't find any, he 's killing himself). PA's blur on minimap is also a joke with experienced players. AM is harder to gank because he's mobile but even failing a gank vs AM means a lot because it makes 13 min BF into 20 min BF and that means mid game begins while AM is behind, unable to rat.  Agree on glimmer, that item is gold.  Vs 4 man constantly going to gank people thus disappear from the minimap, you can't afford to split push because you will usually be the first/second target to die. There are some exceptions when you play something with built-in escapes but those are hero specific.  My solution to this kind of 4 annoyers + 1 free farming carry is to group up your team and go gank the hard carry. It forces your opponent's team to switch to protect/teamfight around their hard carry. However this requires your team to listen to you and go gank as 5 man stack, because if there is still one retar*** guy in your team who wants to farm alone, your opponent will still go find and milk money from that poor guy."

I think the idea was to play a position 1 farming Slark. With leap, SB, ulti, and the dust-purge he should be able to escape the 4-man death ball repeatedly, making them waste time.  I agree that carry slark plays well from behind. Between slippery split push, decent jungling speed and a couple of solo pick offs he can get very dangerous even if he got a bad start."
TrueDoTA2,3bj6r5,unr4v3l,1 point,Mon Jun 29 23:28:09 2015 UTC,"I'm not against that idea, tbh at high level play I always see people not rushing Shadow blade. They get stats items first (Wand, Tread, Aquila, Drum, sometimes even SnY), then Shadow blade. The reason is because more bulk on slark = more right clicks to boost E.Shift, and Drum solves the mana problem unless you buy a Bottle. You can even see top tier Slark player like Illidan Stormrage SF after 1 successful gank has to go fountain because he ran out of mana (in this game he choses to rush SB and skip Drum and Bottle)."
TrueDoTA2,3bj6r5,unr4v3l,1 point,Tue Jun 30 00:03:15 2015 UTC,"This is fair, I could draft differently (I usually just random or pick someone I feel like playing, not necessarily the best hero for a pub).   Maybe something else to think about is delay picking up treads and go into travels for more splitpushing / ratting? If the entire enemy team is mia and you are behind they are probably waiting in your jungle, so you can tp out to some far away lane and farm a few waves at least before backing.  I should probably watch some of my replays and try to get a sense of when the enemy team was at various points vs. where I thought they were, maybe part of this can be solved with better in-game awareness so I know when to extend or not extend.

They will soon lose the networth war."
TrueDoTA2,3bj6r5,RampagingRagE,3,Tue Jun 30 00:06:55 2015 UTC,"You have to convince the 4 other people on your team to stop solo farming and push instead then if they all rotate into the lane you're pushing, back off. If 1-2 of their team are farming on the other side of the map, push the tower down to catch up. Whenever your team rotates, go with a scorched earth policy and take out the neutrals between those lanes as a team, it'll keep you ahead of their team full of roamers that are probably chasing you around (through the now desolate jungles). Don't let your team waste mana or significant cooldowns on killing the camps though, you need those if you run into their team. Pressure their hard carry with smokes and push towers to force them to manfight you instead of taking pickoffs.  The absolute worst thing you can do vs a ganking lineup is split up and try to farm your way out of it. Think of it this way: if you had their team, what would you love for the other team to play like? If they're a bunch of gankers, that answer is 'run around in groups of 1-2'. Now, just don't do that. (the same policy applies for lategame multi-carry teams, you need to fight them before you'd normally be ready because they're even less ready to deal with those fights than you) You need to either deathball or turtle up depending on the team comps. There's always 1-2 heroes who think they need farm and might even be relatively gank-proof but they often don't realize that their farming means the rest of their team is now a lot more vulnerable.  However, this requires all 5 of your players to be on the same page so you're probably screwed."

You need to identify what combination of heroes is capable of killing you (eg Doom can solo kill you, but silencer can't and would need +1-2) You should never farm aggressively if these heroes don't show on the map. It is also best to avoid showing yourself and farming your (or better, enemy) jungle.   Silencer and doom should not be a big deal for you, while Riki is just the best pub counter to storm.  Blitz shows how to play storm mid game very well https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=4xewX9_kM6U"
TrueDoTA2,3bkwdj,BuffKunkka,1 point,Tue Jun 30 12:33:26 2015 UTC,"its just that i feel that i need to play agressively and farm the jungle to be able to stay in the game - if my team doesnt buy wards, would you recommend me to buy them or just farm less?"
TrueDoTA2,3bkwdj,FabulousMrFox,1 point,Tue Jun 30 13:37:45 2015 UTC,"""buy wards"" is always a good advice, but I feel like storm needs his slots too much to carry wards around. If its absolutely necessary, go ward the key spots solo, then retrieve your stick/bottle/ tp from cour  If you are playing in the bracket where people dont buy wards, just deal with it and try to snowball off winning skirmishes, mid and a bit of jungle farm when there is vision/ key enemies are dead/ show on the map somewhere else.   I mean, I just can't think of a situation when you would be unable to know where the heroes that can kill you are. They still need to push and get their own farm and the 4 people in your team are moving as well."

TrueDoTA2,3bkwdj,Thefelix01,2,Tue Jun 30 14:04:27 2015 UTC,"I play in 4.4k EU west and people always buy them  which server do u play on?  The natural instinct for a 4.5k player when there is 0 vision is ""holy shit I need to group up with my team and make something happen"". If there are no wards for some reason there would usually be people sitting behind you that can punish the enemy for invading your jungle.   Also, if people in your bracket dont buy wards, your enemies dont have them too xd. Catching a storm spirit on a completely dark map seems impossible, if you don't show in lanes.   And if for some reason there are no supports on your server I can suggest 2 things: either be the best one in this chaos mechanically/ skillwise and win despite dying to ganks (if there is truly no vision everyone should be dying left and right) or just pick a support. If people dont buy wards where you play. you buying them every game will give your team a colossal advantage and probably give you instant 7k mmr."

TrueDoTA2,3bkwdj,BuffKunkka,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:26:36 2015 UTC,"If you play EU west, then vision is not a problem. Games where peope go full retard and lastpick jungle NP instead of support and just flame everyone do happen, but most of the time I have good vision and never struggle to get information about where enemies are. just watch the map all the time and never farm in an unsafe spot when the combination of heroes that can kill you is missing. you do not need to be on the map to apply pressure. It is, in fact, the opposite. If you farm the enemy jungle and they don't know where exactly you are, their team is supposed to either stay as 5 and never split or try to gank you (it is up to you to evade the gank and make them waste time while your team is farming/ pushing)  Top storm players are so good mechanically and so confident that their item timings and ganks hit so early they just win. the optimal situation is when you dominate mid, get your fast orchid/bloodstone, killing several people in the process, and then just disappear from the map killing everyone who dares to try and farm and TPing to fights so they are 5 vs 5."
TrueDoTA2,3bkwdj,BuffKunkka,-1,Tue Jun 30 15:52:01 2015 UTC,"I'm the same rough MMR and people do buy wards.  And if they don't, buy one yourself. Just one is 75g - you can afford that to ward a rune and jungle entrance simultaneously, thus creating a much safer place to farm.  Also:   Core: Highly Experienced, Support: Experienced   Your flair indicates you may think more highly of yourself than you should. Knowing that you can play the game and some heroes well is fine but have some humility. A big ego doesn't get you anywhere."
TrueDoTA2,3bj28p,eliotxf1,13,Mon Jun 29 17:09:05 2015 UTC,"first of all, how is dark seer a 4? second of all, worry less about what you're better at doing right now and more about what you enjoy doing. However good or bad you are, you want to be improving, and improving requires lots of games. You can't play lots of games unless you're having fun!"
TrueDoTA2,3bj28p,goblinbiddin,3,Mon Jun 29 17:24:10 2015 UTC,"Oh man. The fun thing. That's important.  Can I talk about 4 role dark seer?  It got weaker. You used to be able to clear the jungle decently fast and get enough gold for a bottle before you ran out of mana.   If you're laning it, good effing luck. You'll end up stealing last hits if you use ion she'll, and not using ion shell is GG.   You can still jungle it, but you can't buy courier or wards, something I could do before: buy courier wards and then jungle dark seer and bottle by 2-3 minutes.   Now you need to be strategic about doing harder camps , even choke point jungle.   You skip vacuum usually and go 3-3-1. The surge points matter more as you are playing dark seer how that skill is supposed to be used, to enable other heroes with farm. If you were a core, then that hero would be you, but surging you cores is better in this situation. Vacuum can be picked up as early as needed if you suspect channeling heroes will own you otherwise or tree lurkers or heroes that will dive you then TP."
TrueDoTA2,3bj28p,wildtarget13,3,Mon Jun 29 17:57:04 2015 UTC,I still remember the good times when you'd watch a pro game and the jungle Dark Seer + CM combo would both grab Midas.  Meanwhile the other team's batrider already had a blink in the jungle.  That was a fun patch.

TrueDoTA2,3bj28p,wildtarget13,2,Mon Jun 29 18:34:35 2015 UTC,"Because pubs. 4 cores. Gotta hold back the farm priority when people never see dark seer they assume he's not a good core.   Offlane is obviously ideal. If it comes down you you and Riki vs Offlane and jungle, you probably should suck it up and jungle on the high chance Riki can't 4 position roam."

If your carry game isn't as good as your current calibration understand you might lose more than you win until you get to the correct level but you should be able to start improving from there."
TrueDoTA2,3bj28p,TheRockObama,2,Mon Jun 29 17:29:04 2015 UTC,"To truly identify if you are better at supporting or carrying, make separate accounts for supporting and for carrying, and get them calibrated to RMM.   More realistically, if you think you're worse at one of them you probably are. Just play what you want to get better at!"
TrueDoTA2,3bj28p,ProfessorMonocle,2,Mon Jun 29 17:45:09 2015 UTC,Do you win more games as support or carry?
TrueDoTA2,3bj28p,wildtarget13,1 point,Tue Jun 30 05:12:18 2015 UTC,"There's two questions along the same lines.   Am I currently better at supporting or playing core?   OR  Would I be a better support or a better core?   If you play more core, you probably focus on your own farm instead of securing it for others.   You probably have more practice last hitting. More probably means better unless you are getting progressively worse at last hitting with the same hero. You probably get swapped out of fights by vengeance and have little timing or practice relocate saving people with Io.   If you play more support, you probably have played less mid matchups and are less comfortable with the feel of damage and spell thresholds. You have to instead play by the numbers. You probably are less inclined to play with a bottle.   Now technically, experienced players know both sides of the coin.   What you are currently better at is probably what you play more. 4/5 players on my team are used to playing cores. That also doesn't mean they are on average better at playing core than me.   Some players just can't imagine the concept of a team game where they play a hero that prioritized on minimal and efficient farm. They play like most people play games, to see rampages and double kills on their screen, and that's arguably much more difficult without farm priority.  The solution  If you feel your go to core picks aren't working for you: practice them in unranked, learn about the hero and the matchups by first picking it and getting my countered up the wazoo.   Same with support heroes honestly. Find the heroes that are meta strong and see why. If you don't like them, then at least understand it so you can play it if it is the captains mode or sure fire counter (like wyvern versus tiny or Meepo). Or anti mage versus the Lesh picks or"
TrueDoTA2,3bj28p,unr4v3l,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:50:07 2015 UTC,"Everything takes time to be perfect. Some are born geniuses at something, but those people are rare. If you are a normal human being, you will suck when you start, and if you continuously try to practice and improve by self-analyzing, you will become better day by day.  When I start dota like 1 year ago, I was lucky to have a friend nearby who was a 3 years dota veterans (he even got into some leagues iirc), and basically every week-end I discuss plays with him: was my decision correct?, item choice fit for this game or not?, what to take priority for in this timing, etc... . He keeps telling me to observe and analyze every situation (which is basically voluntary self-analyzing). It got to a point where later I start to argue with him because I find his argument not fitting my reasoning, but that's natural I guess, because I started to forge my own playstyle, and lean myself toward that particular style.  Tl;dr; if you start, you suck, that's natural. Go practice, self analyze, you will become better. Don't give up!"

TrueDoTA2,3bj28p,cookiechang,1 point,Wed Jul 1 10:00:10 2015 UTC,"Seems we're in the same boat. I mainly play support because I usually random and Valve almost always ensures that I random supports. I've gotten better in my carry role because I have a friend who can play support. Basically we'll just play as two in lanes especially if we're playing with potatoes. Having someone who you can trust to support you well enables you to focus on your last hits/kills. Of course, this is a gradual process but bit by bit both you and your support partner will be able to point out flaws in your play-style and that provides you with a good opportunity to improve. You can also try to play with a good carry and have him teach you step-by-step in lobby games.  TL;DR: Play with a friend from whom you can learn. And is willing to teach."
TrueDoTA2,3bj28p,KarateJesus,0,Thu Jul 2 09:09:47 2015 UTC,"I think item builds are what set people apart as a good x or good y.  Support items are important of course but there are so many games where the carry just melts because they aren't flexible with their item build.  PA is my favorite hero for this, so many people insist on BF no matter what when helm/BKB would allow them to fight.  I kind of hate guides for this reason, so many people pick a guide and then assume that's the best build for every game."
TrueDoTA2,3bhr6f,Avvulous,7,Mon Jun 29 09:20:40 2015 UTC,He is probably the only carry that can die to 2 techies lvl 6 non-aghs remote mines. Lol.

TrueDoTA2,3bhr6f,subraizada3_,2,Mon Jun 29 09:39:38 2015 UTC,"7 armor doesn't help much when you have 435 HP. At level 1, 2 mines leave TB with about 15 HP assuming he has no stat items. Even assuming he's got a Wraith Band or something (which is pretty greedy on a hero who desperately needs regen to survive his lane) he's still 1 spell or 2 right clicks from dying. And there's no way he can live through 3 mines. The only thing he's got going for him is illusion sweeps, which is admittedly fairly good, but doesn't help when Techies walks up to the creep wave and threatens to mine you if you even try to last hit without Meta."
TrueDoTA2,3bhr6f,DangerAwar,1 point,Mon Jun 29 10:44:48 2015 UTC,Terrorblade actually needs less regen than most because he has high ehp and base regen
TrueDoTA2,3bhr6f,MechaKnightz,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:48:42 2015 UTC,He has base 621 EHP versus physical and 580 versus magical. Hardly a tank. He can easily be driven out of lane by 1 or 2 magic nukes.

TrueDoTA2,3bhr6f,DangerAwar,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:16:56 2015 UTC,Yes but he still gets a ton of value out of regen compared to doom for example (ehp compared to base hp)

In the scenario OP described TB is hard pushing one lane while the other 4 make space, so he'll probably do better than Naga."
TrueDoTA2,3bhr6f,regulus434,2,Mon Jun 29 12:30:36 2015 UTC,I agree about his low HP being a problem like everybody else said. I would say and alternative would be Lycan who fits your timing window with a strong midgame as well as adding easy roshan/pushing. Considering he is another melee you may not want to grab him so you could also go Lone Druid or even Troll Warlord. Both would have pets to use for clearing mines and can push hard with ranged damage.
TrueDoTA2,3bhr6f,subraizada3_,2,Mon Jun 29 16:59:37 2015 UTC,"Everything can work  Terrorblade   Very slightly off topic, but you can pull off some dank HP swaps with Refresher Sunder.   You are Terrorblade, there is an enemy Tusk, and there is a Rubick on your team Sunder Tusk then Sunder Rubick Tusk has your HP, you have Rubick's HP, Rubick has Tusk's HP Useful if you are low and enemy has high HP and you have a high HP ally nearby - at the end your team has high HP and the enemy team has your previously low HP   Another one:  You are a dying Terrorblade. Enemy team has a low HP Tusk and a high HP PA. You Sunder Tusk. You Refresh. You Sunder PA. PA now has Tusk's low HP and Tusk has your initial (preferably low) HP.  More to the point, unlike Naga/PL/CK/etc. TB can't dosjoint Venge stun or get out of Frostbite with his W. Naga can keep all lanes pressured better than you, which helps the other 4 members of your team take objectives in the mid game while Naga pushes the other side of the map as TB would. Anti-Mage has Spell Shield and with a Heart it will take a very large amount of Techies mines to stop towers going down, TB on the other hand probably still will lose an illusion for each 1-2 mines he destroys with them. AM/Naga both have better escapes to deal with Spectre Haunts to stop your ratting, and AM can probably manfight her a lot better until you're 6-slotted. Anti-Mage's Mana Break absolutely destroys Techies in lane, and CM/Techies/maybe Venge are juicy Mana Void targets. AM also doesn't have to worry about Pudge ganks as mich because he has Spell Shield and takes early points in stats."

Webs could allow Brood to sidestep the mines by going through trees to bypass chokepoints.  You would however have to be careful about jumping on Techies with several spiders as suicide would probably give him quite a lot of farm. I suppose the webs could be mined as well, but if they overlap trees enough that shouldn't be a problem?"

Plain English, straightforward and present a lot of paths without becoming confusing by allowing the reader to understand when to fill in the blanks.  Minor technical note: I'd say picking up quelling blade gains more emphasis as an immediate pickup in 6.84. Whether we want to be catty about our ability to last hit without it or not, since you keep it in to BF now I almost always pick it up immediately in the laning phase... starting Shield/Tango/Salve (200+125+110= 435 leaving you with 190) into immediate quelling blade. Gets you the dual stout/quelling and 2 sets of regeneration basically off the block."
TrueDoTA2,3bf7ma,cantadmittoposting,2,Mon Jun 29 01:36:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think that item progression is reasonable. I just think that sacrificing regen for something like stout shield + qb + tangos can backfire if you discover that your opponents actually brought a really difficult lane."
TrueDoTA2,3bf7ma,pucklermuskau,2,Mon Jun 29 02:01:44 2015 UTC,"id agree with that, i definitely wouldnt leave base without tangos, and no salve is a major risk. too many ways the lane can go wrong and leave you out, far from base without sufficient regen to actually get in for last hits. but first purchase qb from the side shop really should be the way forward, unless things seem to require the poormans route."
TrueDoTA2,3bf7ma,BeachSluts,2,Mon Jun 29 04:47:26 2015 UTC,"That's the beauty of qb is you can buy it in the side shop. In fact, I don't think there's a single hero besides maybe Bloodseeker who I would even think about spending starting gold on a qb."
TrueDoTA2,3bf7ma,lolfail9001,2,Mon Jun 29 16:31:30 2015 UTC,"Well, i do think it can be legit (starting with QB) in somewhat organized game as safelane melee against offlane DS."

TrueDoTA2,3bf7ma,sprkng,2,Mon Jun 29 04:30:35 2015 UTC,"Picking a farm dependent carry with an ""incompetent"" team is always a gamble, because you don't know if they'll be able to play 4 vs 5 until you're ready to join fights.  I don't play AM but I think someone wrote that they like to build treads + Vlad's (i.e. no BF rush) for a more early fight oriented AM. Not sure if it's legit but it might be worth considering if your team is getting crushed and losing towers too fast. Haven't finished reading this guide so maybe he talks about it."

I have a question though:  How do you deal with natural orchid carriers like QoP, Storm (if they do orchid build) or Clinkz and the like? If they are having a good game, they will get it way before you get Manta, and then make your life hell until it becomes really hard to get the Manta? Do you skip Vlads and go straight Manta? Do you gimp yourself even harder and skip Battlefury for Manta? Both sound like very sub-optimal solutions."
TrueDoTA2,3bf7ma,wildtarget13,4,Mon Jun 29 02:36:59 2015 UTC,"Straight manta isn't super suboptimal. Usually it's straight vlads+yasha into manta. It's more suptoimal to let an orchid ganker run over you IF you find battlefury before they find orchid and even if you both find it at the same time.  If you're going to be a gank target or unable to show up to fights you need to early with your ult, you are putting way too much pressure on your team.   The only thing you give up is the ability to clear stacks. Anti-mage can't be a perfect hero every game, give the stacks to someone else.  The atk speed and damage from yasha still increases your jungle and lane creep clearing speed. Another thing I've been toying around with for straight manta is casual medallion right after manta or in between yasha or manta. It allows you to throw net worth onto heroes that want to go in and take single ancients faster. Not to mention armor helps you survive said gank's right clicks."

TrueDoTA2,3bf7ma,DeliciousKiwi,1 point,Mon Jun 29 15:47:20 2015 UTC,SF would  be a good choice I think. I rarely ever see him played properly. People don't realize how critical it is to last hit with him and how low his starting base damage is. However there are so many nuances to the hero writing one guide would be a huge task.

I completely understand the idea in pro Dota, I feel in pub Dota that more points in manabreak could lead to kills as your pub opponents are more likely to make an error, bonus damage from mana break would maximise your chances for a kill."
TrueDoTA2,3bf7ma,vishnup,2,Tue Jun 30 04:53:12 2015 UTC,"Think of it like this, in a normal game situation you are  going to be in a position to trade hits favorably for the first 5-10 minutes. After that, whenever fights break out there will usually be 2+ enemies to fight which makes it difficult to use mana break effectively. Stats give you more health, more mana/mana regen and extra damage which you make use of the entire time you're farming.  A value point in mana break is already enough to turn the tables for early game trades, but additional points in it won't be used that often. In a particularly hectic game with lots of aggression I sometimes take a second point in mana break, but until you get Manta you need to spend a lot of time hitting one guy to really see a benefit. Farming, hell you'll do that all game so overall you get more utility out of the stat points."
TrueDoTA2,3bf7ma,FabulousMrFox,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:45:02 2015 UTC,"Great guide, one of the best hero guides I've ever read, actually focuses on how the hero plays rather than irrelevant details. Subscribed to your RSS feed, looking forward to more of your work :)"
TrueDoTA2,3bf7ma,pucklermuskau,1 point,Tue Jun 30 07:38:19 2015 UTC,I kind of like getting a few more points in mana break over stats in case I'm having a rough time in lane. A lot of the neutrals have mana so you can shred them a bit faster keeping your HP up.   Thoughts?
TrueDoTA2,3bem30,poppik,11,Sun Jun 28 14:47:13 2015 UTC,"Use a remote mine for roshan....not a land mine.  Don't mid techies.  Waste of a lane and your greatest ability.  If you aren't getting fb every game you are doing something wrong.  Only block enemy camps if they have a jungler, you can screw your own carries if you aren't careful.  Once you get aghs (ideally around lvl 10-11) you can clear every creep wave with a single remote.  Abuse it to split push in team fights.  Land mines never drop off, you just have to modify the amount you put in each stack to reflect the enemy heroes.  After 35 minutes stasis traps will either win your team the game or lose it, depending on how well you know how to place them in teamfights and especially before teamfights."
TrueDoTA2,3bem30,_OneManArmy_,3,Sun Jun 28 16:28:56 2015 UTC,"Can you explain how you use stasis inside of fights?  It's not just ""drop stasis in middle of fight, cross fingers"", right?"
TrueDoTA2,3bem30,Thalnagath,3,Sun Jun 28 16:47:20 2015 UTC,"It's actually pretty close to that. As soon as you feel like you can safely make it into the center of a fight, run in and drop a stasis. If you can't get into the fight safely, just toss your remotes in from range and put the stasis behind you along your likely retreat path. If your team is smart, they will look for a chance to back off and drag the team into your stasis (not always possible). If not, they'll at least have their escape route covered and probably end up killing a hero that tried to pick off a runner or at least the runner will get away."
TrueDoTA2,3bem30,brinebold,1 point,Sun Jun 28 17:14:55 2015 UTC,What about pre-fight traps?  How do you prevent enemy teams from letting creeps or summons run in and set them off?
TrueDoTA2,3bem30,Thalnagath,2,Sun Jun 28 20:34:18 2015 UTC,"You don't put them in the direct enemy paths, you put them in juke branches and to cover your escape.  Ideally you have enough set up pre-fight you can abuse euls to hit one of the enemy cores with one and already have an escape route stasis'd up.  I always put one in an obvious spot just so the enemy assumes they triggered them all and will teamfight on your terms.  You should have 3-5 stasis traps down before the teamfight starts making sure they are far enough apart not to chain if one triggers and out of creep lines."
TrueDoTA2,3bem30,_OneManArmy_,4,Sun Jun 28 23:04:23 2015 UTC,"I'm playing more and more and more techies and god is he an awesome hero.  If all 3 cores on enemy team are melees its wonderful to play, tho I feel he is really strong and doesn't really mater if you get counterpicked by 1 or 2 heroes, since that could open up space for your teammates.  Some more tips I could add, I have like 30 games or less with a winrate of +65%, not much but could do.   Try to lane more than roam, if you roam and don't get kills you end up underleveled and pretty useless, you can still lane and try to harrass and kill with suicide. If you main laning, buy a null talisman, abuse techies range to harrass the enemy and trade with supports. Forcestaff first big item almost always, then u decide if euls, aghs, bloodstone, vyse, etc. Leave remotes across the creep path in lanes in the late game, you can stop pushes by killing the waves if you lose a teamfight. Abuse fountain regen, if you tp to a tower you can put a land mind almost inmediatly by shift queing command without losing mana. This is a  nice guide for blocking camps, I have yet to use it a full potential tho. http://imgur.com/a/Ccqjt"
TrueDoTA2,3bem30,Estbarul,2,Mon Jun 29 18:25:43 2015 UTC,I agree with all of these another thing I like to do is push towers with my q as it allows me more room to set up mines and as you said catch up on levels and get that nice shiny aghs/force staff.
TrueDoTA2,3bem30,riyoux,1 point,Sun Jun 28 16:05:54 2015 UTC,I have techies for my 10-hero challenge.  I haven't won with them yet but it's pretty fun so far.  Thanks for the pointers!
TrueDoTA2,3bem30,dbssaber,-2,Mon Jun 29 22:49:23 2015 UTC,"My best advice is to never, ever show on the map.  Obviously rules are made to be broken, but generally you are fucking up if you're mindlessly farming lane or spending time in common ward spots.  If the enemies think you're there or have been there, they will not herpaderp their way into mines, which is the #1 way of getting kills and forcing desperate detection purchases.  I have been extending the landmine gaming phase, since they don't expire and can have impacts in the late game.  I don't get ult until 10 or I have aghs.  This means I'm smoking to rosh, placing courier mines, and have several first blood spots in the early to mid game.  It is so important at this time to be unpredictable.  Showing on the map basically gives away the last or next 90 seconds of gameplay."
TrueDoTA2,3bem30,docmartens,3,Sun Jun 28 19:20:44 2015 UTC,But...how are you getting xp without showing on map?
TrueDoTA2,3bem30,Thefelix01,0,Mon Jun 29 11:40:04 2015 UTC,"You should be the most XP starved member of the team, which is totally acceptable on techies, as you can do thousands of physical damage at level 7 with just a small stack.  I farm heroes until I get aghs, then it's base defense while popping a mine here and there to kill a full creep wave.  Then I get travels and push lanes way the hell out one mine at a time while my base defense mines are in place.  If they take a fight under my tower, or if my team gets wiped in no man's land and the enemy pushes, I will ultra kill without having to be there.  Techies is not a normal hero, so he doesn't have to play conventional dota.  Any other hero and you're fucking up if you're level 2 at 8 minutes, or level 8 at 22 minutes, but it's just not even an issue for Techies.  I look around at all these techies that think you have to be in lane or you'll get behind, and it just results in a completely bare map and a hero that doesn't need early creep farm taking it from someone else.  I don't understand why you'd pick techies to play normal dota."
TrueDoTA2,3bem30,docmartens,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:28:42 2015 UTC,"Well then I just don't think that's a good way of playing techies. Early levels matter so much on him. Even if you get a few kills, if you are 5 levels behind at 20 minutes your kill potential is so much more limited. The enemy will get tankier and have more to spend on detection whilst you are taking longer to make a stack that can kill anyone. I think your advice is fine later for later on in the game but only once you've secured some levels or have a good way to catch up"
TrueDoTA2,3bem30,Thefelix01,3,Mon Jun 29 17:40:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah I second this, I used to play this way of only roamer and found it's the most inneficient one, you NEED and WANT XP and farm, if you end up roaming 5 minutes and the enemy places a nice sentry, you just lost 5 minutes, didn't take a kill, didn't make space for team, didn't push tower, let enemy carry free farm, really did nothing.   Even achieving a support kill isn't that good of a trade for 5 minutes of roaming.  Techies is not a normal hero, you don't play him normally, but you still benefit a lot from levels and money.  If you play good on lane, you can be alone in the offlane, make the carry worried going at each last hit in case you suicide and allahu ahkbar in the face, keep the mined and for yourself, you can be like a broodmother with the benefit that can go to another lane any moment and start mining and helping the team."
TrueDoTA2,3bem30,Estbarul,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:33:32 2015 UTC,"I play him and get the opposite feeling.  Early levels are meaningless on him when he can kill at any level disadvantage, so your comment about his kill potential being limited does not make sense to me.  Tankiness is irrelevant during landmine phase, because there is no hero in the game that can walk through all that physical damage.  I'd understand if you were talking about remote mines, because those expire and can be tanked before aghs, but landmines are just a matter of spending an extra 30-45 seconds to ensure they kill.  Another reason early levels are pointless on techies is his catch up potential.  His ability to kill anyone and get global XP and gold for it means he's actually rewarded for being further behind in levels.  Additionally, since he naturally draws the game out, there's no rush to get ahead like that.  Techies is not a snowball hero.  He can snowball, but it's neither his objective nor win condition.  A third reason: landmines are permanent.  A stack in rosh pit will never fall out of fashion, so any stack that is not completely stupid can play later.  Walk by an old stack with level 2 mines, put a couple level 4 mines on top.  There is no loss of efficiency by dedicating techies to roam because the work he puts in early doesn't expire.  Sure they'll have more money to buy a gem, but by that point I'll have littered the map with stacks instead of standing in lane getting creep XP.  They need to buy a gem, or they fucking lose.  An underleveled 4 position roamer forcing that much detection spending, and an item slot on the carry for that gem so he doesn't die in the jungle, etc...  These things I consider successes, not failures.    In short, Techies should not be responsible to stop creeps from beating on a tower.  That is a core position's job while techies engineers the map to trap enemy cores.  Techies is a roamer with a global perspective, not a laner with hard and fast item timings enslaved to his tower.  Do I sometimes get waylaid before soul ring?  yes.  Do I sometimes get waylaid before aghs?  yes.  But for all the reasons I mentioned, he is not a hero that loses the game off of these timing delays.  Time is what techies has plenty of, so the rush to do 500 damage per mine instead of 300 is really unnecessary."
TrueDoTA2,3bem30,docmartens,1 point,Mon Jun 29 23:30:11 2015 UTC,"That's how I played him at first but I found it so inefficient when you can get a few levels in lane whilst still mining an area and getting some kills and mana regen. Then you go roaming because you spend half the time to make a lethal stack and don't need to go back to base so you make the map a lot more dangerous for them.  I'm not pretending to have perfected the hero though. What MMR are you and can you link me on dotabuff, I'd be interested in seeing a replay"
TrueDoTA2,3bem30,Thefelix01,1 point,Tue Jun 30 09:11:57 2015 UTC,"Here's me.  The last game I played was techies.  It started off shitty, and I caught up."
TrueDoTA2,3bem30,docmartens,0,Tue Jun 30 19:21:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I personally don't like that as a rule. You should be farming a lot as well as going into full sneak mode, it's just a matter of finding out when to switch between the two and I think I have to agree with OP on being very sneaky during night."
TrueDoTA2,3bd6be,lejonetfrannorden,4,Sun Jun 28 02:36:54 2015 UTC,"Now I ask about SF.What should be optimal lane and mid SF build?   Specify a little. Just because SF safe is a real thing. It's why picks like SF+QoP don't really make lanes transparent and predictable.   If you predict you can't last hit with ~38 damage then get razes level 1. It's a lot easier. An SF builds usually rush bottle, but don't be afraid to get three branches and a tango or tango+circlet branches. Against a mid hero that decides he can trade with you level 1 and kill you (I love killing SF level 1 as puck) consider buying or ferrying an extra set of regen, a salve or tango.   Other matchups you'll wraith tango start and own until they have kill potential at level 5-6. And then lose souls and be sad.   About item builds, it's really on you to determine your play style and role in a game.   The prof builds and pub builds greatly differ. Mek SF and Euls SF are usually two of the bigger ones. Euls lets you go blink/BKB next in some order and solo ultimate people. The problem comes when you're trying to kill cores/heroes with phaseshift, BkBs, and their own Euls. The only way to solve this is things like Aghs static storm or Jakiro ice path, but few heroes don't buy these items. Euls also helps SF cancel channels like spla and TPs. So if your team lacks those, be careful.   Mek SF is just a solid build for teams that will cover SF. If you do it in a pub, you need to coordinate with you team to make sure you nullify an enemy's AOE team fight nuke damage. It leaves you on low mana though if you raze the jungle as it requires the maximum amount of bottle+ Tread switching. It's not a farming build, it's a fight and go base/die and repeat build.   The pub route of Midas is usually not an option. Not fighting in the first 20 minutes constantly is not rare. And if a team is awake, they'll try to fight and force SF to fight in the first 20 minutes. Be it through pushes or ganks.   It does do something though. If you need a certain item timing by the time you hit high ground like BkB+Blink and you have a Teamfight set up like Enigma or Dark Seer, then Midas can be the solution.   Honestly, just be solid about utilizing the jungle. Stack camps a lot, don't rely on supports to do it, you have good wave clear. If enemy heroes and supports start trying to kill you when you stack, then pray you're making space for your team or have your team cover you.   Shadow blade is a pub build and honestly just a split pushing build and or SF jungle assassin build to pressure the enemy. Blink does similar things and is good in conjunction.   Being good about last hitting mechanics mid is super important. Knowing about creep Aggro and mid matchups is essential as well as body blocking. SF usually survives any and every lane by not dying, raze spamming, and bottle crowing/rune control.   Losing a lane is technically a thing, but SF catches up in farm so fast that he's like the exception to losing a lane. If you feed mid game and they take over your jungle, that's just a thing that happens afterward.   Honestly, watch any popular team play SF for the first 10 minutes or if you feel playing from behind and being relevant in the mid game is your problem, watch that. Some and most of it is support players and space makers covering SF."

TrueDoTA2,3bd6be,TriggeredSJWarrior,1 point,Wed Jul 1 09:18:01 2015 UTC,"whenever you feel pressured in lane or supports are missing, go into jungle. If you're radiant you can even afford to just clear the closest medium camp right before the ruin spawns around the 40sec mark."
TrueDoTA2,3bd6be,V-ktr,1 point,Sun Jun 28 15:15:03 2015 UTC,yeah sometimes I do that but generally I wait to stack.
TrueDoTA2,3bd6be,V-ktr,1 point,Sun Jun 28 16:59:51 2015 UTC,"For safe souls, a single stack can be worth it. Especially if you die mid and lose souls.  I think once you hit 4-5 stacks, you're going to start having to waste time walking long paths. Like on radiant large camp you'll have to pull left and down instead of up or else you'll start missing stacks.   So it's worth your time to clear it at that point. Don't rely on supports. Nuke the wave at 41-43 and determine whether you can et the next rune or if the safe move is to get a guaranteed stack."

TrueDoTA2,3bd6be,chainadota,1 point,Sun Jun 28 19:02:02 2015 UTC,"I think shadow blade is viable vs certain carries such as PA, as it builds into Silver Edge which provides tankiness and dps. In most situations yes but don't tell bad SF players to only use shadow blade for split pushing."
TrueDoTA2,3bd6be,IAmAustinPowersAMA,4,Thu Jul 2 22:35:32 2015 UTC,"Don't go Midas, your farm is hella fast regardless. I think his core is essentially Aquila and Bottle early game and thats about it. You adapt. Treads/Phase/BoT-rush are all viable just learn your raze distances and to stack camps from mid occasionally and your farm will sky rocket.   He has huge potential physical and magical dmg mid game without any items so you see many prioritizing survivability (mek) so you can push this early-mid advantage, take towers, get map control etc.etc.   If your team doesn't suite that kinda play then you can go travels and just split push for ages, get yasha, AC, maybe early deso if totally yolo and I definitely recommend getting a blink then.   Euls - Blink was meta for a while, idk how it stands currently but the extra mana for spamming spells to farm is always great and so is insta gibbing but with all the early game aggresion I feel like you end up being fairly squishy. I kinda like pairing it with treads, wand, aquila but that's a lot of little gold before you get your 1-shot combo up.....  Yeah idk just some thoughts, I'm a shit SF player, I'm usually just an offlaner, just recently gotten more interested in him after getting rekt by one LOL."

TrueDoTA2,3bd6be,Defiled-,1 point,Sun Jun 28 13:11:41 2015 UTC,"No problem, glad to help out :)  That's the way it should be right? Higher you get the harder it gets, it's a lot of fun lol  I personally think you should be going Euls - Blink - BoT so you have a ton of movement speed and a simple euls into a blink away is an alright escape. Stack and clear your own camps earlier game but then switch over largely farming your opponenets woods to get a net worth lead over all and allowing your carry to farm your own woods safely.   After those items it's likely AC for harder split push and between physical dmg or Bkb if you thnk you'll be forced to fight."
TrueDoTA2,3bd6be,Defiled-,2,Sun Jun 28 15:07:12 2015 UTC,"Instead of midas you should be stacking camps whenever there's downtime in lane. You're gonna clear 4-5 stacks faster than pretty much anyone, use that as your faring boost instead of midas.   I always go blink dagger on SF as I find Shadow blade still is a one trick pony (unless the enemy absolutely refuses to buy wards and dust), while blink allows for better controlled positioning.   For squishiness look at BKB.   As for lost lanes, I'm not really sure what you're trying to describe. SF should probably stop going to lane if he keeps on dying (even more so if he keeps on dying without getting necromastery stacks back up), and as for bad matchups there aren't many."
TrueDoTA2,3bd6be,Endzior,1 point,Sun Jun 28 09:42:24 2015 UTC,yeah stacking camps.everyone says that so that is a thing i really need to improve.thank you dude.
TrueDoTA2,3bd6be,IAmAustinPowersAMA,2,Sun Jun 28 13:36:40 2015 UTC,"I've been playing a lot of SF lately and I've had the most success with going bottle treads aquila into sange and yasha. By getting the sny by the 15-18 minute mark it increases farming speed as well as making me pretty tanky and I don't die easily in early fights. From there I usually go into one of Skadi/Butterfly/Assault Cuirass/BKB/ whatever the team needs. I really dont think blink or shadow blade is a requirement every game, unless maybe you need the silver edge for a bristle or pa.  Safelane is doable but it isnt really that good I feel since rune control makes SF a really good mid laner and you dont have the same control from the safelane and ability to spam out your razes.  If you get ganked  2-3 times mid just get your level 5 and rotate to the jungle. Try stack as much as you can during the laning phase if your lane isn't going well and use those stacks to catch up when you reach level 5."

TrueDoTA2,3bd6be,Vuccappella,1 point,Mon Jun 29 10:15:34 2015 UTC,"The only carries that should be considering picking up Midas on a fairly regular basis are the ones that need their level 3 ultimates ASAP and as a side benefit those that really benefit from attack speed.   Some examples:  Faceless Void, Wraith King, Chaos Knight, Tiny, Nightstalker.  I think Necrophos and Slark are notable mentions as well but probably not as much.  Otherwise I think there are much better items for everyone else."

TrueDoTA2,3bau0y,DHKany,11,Sat Jun 27 13:07:31 2015 UTC,"Carry-shotgun build was destroyed by eblade projectile nerf, If anything, after eblade projectile nerf, adaptive projectile makes it easier to combo. Adaptive projectile is first and foremost a deadly support/offlane morph nerf.  As for carry, IIRC, there is some guy over at playdota that tries going something like 4-4-2-0 by 10 with bunch of early game stuff and uses adaptive as a spammable dagon 0. According to him, it works for him."
TrueDoTA2,3bau0y,lolfail9001,2,Sat Jun 27 13:57:16 2015 UTC,"Here's the link to the Spiritah (6k EUW player, IIRC) Morphling thread on PD, for anyone interested."
TrueDoTA2,3bau0y,Harlequeens,1 point,Sun Jun 28 00:10:30 2015 UTC,It wasn't exactly destroyed as you could still have some pretty instantaneous burst the second eblade landed.

TrueDoTA2,3bau0y,Sbsvn,2,Sat Jun 27 14:56:02 2015 UTC,"I've been thinking about this a lot since I played a shit load of morph and usually went the Bot rush build, but this build doesn't work at all in this meta. I honestly couldn't come up with anything better than to just undo the changes to adaptive. The Bot Morphling really made for a very fun and dynamic hero, the support Morph Icefrog is pushing people to feels kind of awkward to play to be honest. I'm a bit biased for sure though.."
TrueDoTA2,3bau0y,Masiosare,1 point,Sat Jun 27 14:39:54 2015 UTC,"I don't know why bots aren't listed as core on him. You get linkens a then bots and you cover so much map, it's insane. You never run out of mana  and you can be farming the whole map."
TrueDoTA2,3bau0y,Igi2server,8,Sat Jun 27 14:59:31 2015 UTC,"I dont even get Linkens on him, I just get aquila, a second wraith band, magic stick boots into BoT. I feel stats go so much futher on Morphling than regen, since Morphling is all about stat manipulation.   I comepletely agree with getting a Early BoTs on Morphling, it really wakes him up quicker than any item since you can abuse his replicate so much. You can send Morph's ult home, farm while its traveling then morph at 1sec/when illusion is back home, heal, BoTs anywhere, Rinse repeat every 50 sec. Replicate Level 1 Conveniently hits 50 sec cd if the illusion runs out of time, or you use it last sec. Then theres my personal favorite Replicate the strongest hero in the game/lane/w/e TP home, pressure the lane with the illusion while youre at fountain for like 15 seconds then return back to the replicate."

TrueDoTA2,3bau0y,TriggeredSJWarrior,1 point,Sun Jun 28 17:47:05 2015 UTC,"Removing the cast point on waveform would make the eblade combo more viable without really buffing support morph or reverting other changes.  Right now you need a certain amount of distance between you and the target to successfully combo, assuming you lead with wave, or you need to eblade first then wave/adaptive. Both methods give the opponent a lot of time to dodge.This change would make it viable close up.   A base ms speed buff would be nice too, but that probably buffs support morph too much."
TrueDoTA2,3bau0y,mriswith-,1 point,Sun Jun 28 21:39:21 2015 UTC,Removing cast point makes him nearly uncatchable. Something with his ultimate needs a change.

TrueDoTA2,3bau0y,Hartwall,0,Sat Jun 27 18:44:48 2015 UTC,I'm not pro on Morph but if you want to see Morph mid player you can check out twitch.tv/y0nd.  This guy is pretty sick when his Morph gets lv2 he destroys mid completely. He mostly goes for shotgun build later though.
TrueDoTA2,3bau0y,Hartwall,0,Sat Jun 27 14:28:27 2015 UTC,Try playing it as an offlane or a support. Go for an early soul ring + tranquils and go full str + max adaptive. The stun is ridiculous with a 4.25/10 uptime. Combine that with an euls and you have a mean ganking machine. And with the new aghs you have mid-lategame options aswell.  http://yasp.co/players/80986631?with_account_id=&hero_id=10&isRadiant=all&win=all&patch=all&game_mode=all&lobby_type=all&leagueid=all&significant=1  My last 3 morph games have been support and it's retarded how hard you can keep someone cc'd.
TrueDoTA2,3bau0y,Igi2server,2,Sat Jun 27 14:52:58 2015 UTC,"Yah, but I was talking about was what changes could bring Morph's shotgun game back, as right now you can dodge it extremely easily."
TrueDoTA2,3bau0y,dpekkle,1 point,Sat Jun 27 14:54:32 2015 UTC,"Well I don't really see how it needs to be brought back. It still kills supports like it used to. The main point of playing an eb rushing morph was to make a fight 4v5 without actually committing into a fight which you can do with an eb adaptive waveform into ulti. The fact that the enemy can dodge it makes it balanced. And nothing stops you from using waveform first to get yourself close. Sure it removes 100 damage from your combo, but it allows you to hit once during the waveform."
TrueDoTA2,3bau0y,Igi2server,2,Sat Jun 27 15:02:03 2015 UTC,"You have to put into account that the past few Nerfs that effected Morph, were adding Projectiles, or increasing the time traveled. Now the opponent  can Disjoint the first two parts to his combo, and BKB dodge the entire combo. I play a decent amount of Morphling, and yes morphling still has the potential to burst a support down, because that was never effected. The problem is that the counter play to Morphling has been increased significantly, since BKB, Blink, Mirror Image, Eul's, and all the Hero based Disjoints, and immunities. And theres not much Morphling can do except look at the 4700g item."

TrueDoTA2,3b91qd,wildtarget13,11,Fri Jun 26 23:29:40 2015 UTC,"I enjoyed your write-up. I think atos is a great item for Timber as well, however, I think bloodstone is still a very viable first item if youre snowballing as hard as you should with this hero. Now that its built from soul ring, it can be even more effective in the build-up stage if youre ahead of your lane. I will usually jump for atos or euls if it seems my bloodstone isn't coming before 15 minutes. I think itemization on this hero needs to be decided very early on, when you get a feel for the lane. That being said, I wouldn't take anything over bloodstone if I'm balling hard early on.  Btw thanks for advocating blink... it's invariably my second item and core on this hero, for fun if nothing else"
TrueDoTA2,3b91qd,CMM929,3,Fri Jun 26 23:58:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm sure a big part of why I always write up about not buying snowball items is because I find it too difficult or unreliable to snowball with items that are more greedy let's call it.   Aui_2k described Atos almost perfectly when he was analyzing slashers Lina. If you show up to a lane with Atos, that hero is dead. Same thing with Timber. Although Timber's combo is longer range than Lina's, the combo is still way stronger if you get more Chakram damage on them by slowing them.  Blink lets you land your combo against people that usually could just space well versus you, same with Atos.   The thing about blink is usually it's for mobility, but chain already has 2/3rds of the angles covered. Something that I noticed I do more recently is chakram to get rid of trees that are in front of a tree possibility that would let me cliff jump, which blink can also do."
TrueDoTA2,3b91qd,evillunch2,3,Sat Jun 27 00:18:54 2015 UTC,Explain Tranquil boots to me? Timber is a hero where you want to get hit by the creeps constantly to keep reactive armor up at as many max stacks as possible. Tranquils  loses it's regen if he gets hit.
TrueDoTA2,3b91qd,evillunch2,1 point,Mon Jun 29 15:42:54 2015 UTC,"So tell me this: when are you not regening? It allows timber to regen both in between and out of battle.   It also gives him armor, something he also lacks when reactive is off.  The mana pool from arcanes is super useful, and it's a hard sell. But Arcanes gives no survivability, it's an offensive and farming item. It helps your team too."
TrueDoTA2,3b91qd,dustyuncle,2,Mon Jun 29 15:47:46 2015 UTC,"I mean in my opinion, Timber is a mana starved hero. The extra mana from Arcane boots, and the recent buff to them where it doesn't cost mana is a huge buff imo. Tranquils to me is just overdone when combined with reactive armor. And you say you go mid with him right? Mid, I can see tranquils being OK since you have a bottle for more mana regen, but I still think he should at least rush a bloodstone first, just because mana is such an important aspect for Timber. I like the atos pick, and it definitely works, just keeps them in your chakram and all your other spells for a long time, but it's an item you can get much easier after you pick up Bloodstone (letting you farm jungle/lane creeps much much faster than not having a bloodstone)  Just my thoughts though, good write-up. I really like him mid too btw"
TrueDoTA2,3b91qd,pucklermuskau,1 point,Mon Jun 29 15:55:02 2015 UTC,"I'd get on timber if he was offlane too.   But I'd say at the very least 2/3rds of games timber isn't getting bloodstone levels or farm.   And it's those 2/3rds of games that timbers rush bloodstone and proceed to have a cross your fingers sort of impact.   As important as jungle farming is, imagine how many games you can play where the position 3 is allowed to free farm the jungle between bloodstone and shivas gold. If you play on fighting and makin use of the fact that you don't have big cool downs then Bloodstone is a roll of the dice and banking that you're ahead or the enemy can't lock you down and damage you enough.   I know I'm coming off as devils advocate, but I watched a raging RTZ go 0-4 into 8-8 and bloodstone, but saw him miss him combo so much and imagined how good his Impact would have been if he went Atos.   Always good to hear good criticism and feedback!"
TrueDoTA2,3b91qd,dustyuncle,5,Mon Jun 29 16:26:13 2015 UTC,"OK, so I just tried this build. Was great early on but I don't feel it scales well. First of all, where do you get the aghs. Since you got ATOS, you have to get another mana item at least like euls to then afford the mana for aghs. Problem is you also need BKB usually by that time. So by the time you start building aghs it's a 5th slot item, which you probably would have wanted hex by then.   by getting atos you're focusing on your solo target damage when really you should be focusing on group damage. Thus, bloodstone to aghs to utility items is probably better in most cases. Sure I can take down that one target quickly with atos, but if i have the two chakrams, I only need half as much time to deal damage.  Plus I think you forget to mention that the key source of chakram damage is actually the initial and exiting hit of the chakram. by not getting aghs early, you're losing out on 50% damage"
TrueDoTA2,3b91qd,dustyuncle,1 point,Sat Jun 27 13:09:58 2015 UTC,"I mentioned a lot of mana items. Euls, is fine, and definitely the faster solution to silences and channel cancels. But it's the weakest scaling item. Lotus is what you should shoot for if you want to scale better.   Honestly, I didn't mention BkB or Aghs, which is probably an oversight on what I felt was important to change.   Let's be real, people hardly buy BKB on Timber when they should. By the time a Bloodstone+Shivas comes out, a Atos Lotus Timber will need one too. One just has way more utility and less raw mana regen.   Agh+Bloodstone is Zero armor. So is BKB+Atos and Atos+Hex.   As good as Aghs is on Timber, it's luxury. Like you said you need the mana pool to support it. And finding the mana to sustain it in favor or missing out on resistances like armor and immunity from BKB is the huge price you'll have to pay to get a timely Aghs.  And about Timber with Atos being too single target? It's not a bad thing to be able to do both. It's not like wasting a cool down to do the combo. Shivas is the only item Timber can buy to do AOE crowd control for his spells, and buying that time first, while possible, is definitely a Bloodstone+Shivas buildup.   You sometimes need the burst of double chakras to blow up heroes. Enigma can do way more similarly with Aghs black hole and lion too. There's a difference in play style though. Timber thrives the longer the fight goes. Chakra slow increases and reactive stacks pay off.   It's a damage versus utility. In other words, sometimes you need the hex to even hit a target. Sometimes immunity, sometimes armor, and the rare sometimes, more initial burst damage.   Also. As good as Timber is late game, this is all definitely late game focused. Just like bloodstone buildups were. Two 5k gold items is doable, but were shouldn't want to theory craft four 5k slots. Draft your timber to end games and take objectives with your heroes.   Oh. Small afterthought. Thanks for the feedback and trying it out!"
TrueDoTA2,3b91qd,HulkThoughts,4,Sat Jun 27 15:39:16 2015 UTC,"i really have a hard time seeing aghs as anything less than core. it massively increases both his pushing power, as well as his teamfight aoe/cc. the hero simply takes off after aghs..."
TrueDoTA2,3b91qd,pucklermuskau,1 point,Sat Jun 27 17:18:12 2015 UTC,"IF uncontested in terms of burst damage, which is unrealistic in terms of how much Timber mid or farming priority in general games he sees.   You need at least 3 items to make Aghs work , not to mention straight up winning the game anyways if you have more bloodstone charges and few deaths. It's a win more item, not a catch up or achieve the win item."
TrueDoTA2,3b6zz5,ChrisArm0,9,Fri Jun 26 14:05:40 2015 UTC,"SE is not that great an item to go unless there are passives you want to remove. I suggest getting it last honestly. tbh, the item is really mediocre when there is nothing to remove.   I think in this patch, keeping in mind that SF, Lesh and QoP are all really popular, I think you need the early stats of Drums to not get blown up. I think going straight Shadow Blade is extremely greedy and can lead to you just throwing any lead you have away and as a Slark, you cannot afford to ever do that.  BSJ has a really long guide  (3 hours long) on Slark if you want to see it. He goes incredibly in depth."
TrueDoTA2,3b6zz5,somethingToDoWithMe,2,Fri Jun 26 15:01:40 2015 UTC,Honestly I really don't think his item choices apply to <4k. Since at that level enemies will be less coordinated and it is easier to get solo pickoffs.
TrueDoTA2,3b6zz5,iFrankoharris,3,Fri Jun 26 15:51:03 2015 UTC,"He mentions that several times in the guide. ""Feel free to pub stomp at 2k with Aquila, Treads, SB rush."" I think you still want the Wand or at least a Stick in there too."
TrueDoTA2,3b6zz5,cilantro_avocado,2,Fri Jun 26 16:54:03 2015 UTC,"This is true of many guides by high MMR players.  I love going for more conservative, farm oriented builds.  Part of learning to play Dota is knowing when you can do what.  For example, On PL I'd love to be able to go boots>aquila>BOTs>Manta>diffusal.  It's great to have the mobility and movement speed, being able to farm the entire map.   That being said, it's a rare game (mid 3k mmr) where I have that kind of luxury.  Most of the time the entire enemy team is running at me all game and having going boots>aquila>diffusal is more or less required.    As for BSJ's Slark build, I've been watching his stream since before MKBboys was a thing.  He used to go Midas almost every game but over time his Slark build has gotten more and more focused on early fighting.  He frequently spends a lot of time recovering from bad starts as he tends to be the focus of enemy rotations, where even being able to soak XP in the safelane is a luxury.  Therefore I've found it to be very good in Pubs where I do find myself needing to be able to fight damn near constantly and still be able to carry into the lategame.  Sometimes I can just go SB rush and snowball off of that, but I never to into a game thinking that I will be able to get away with that.  I see it more as a bunch of branching builds.  You start off with boots>aquila.  From there I decide if I want to go for a midas (if my team is dominating 4v5 and I have free farm).  Of If I want to go treads>SB and start roaming or if I want to go treads>drums >s&y and just help in early fights while farming as much as possible."

TrueDoTA2,3b6zz5,Ballazard,7,Fri Jun 26 15:16:59 2015 UTC,"Honestly silver edge rush is terrible.  I prefer to go SB>Skadi/SnY>BKB>Butterfly/Abyssal>Butterfly/Abyssal after those it depend on your specific game.  If I'm really balling out of control I'll just get a 2nd Bfly. I'll get a silver edge after BKB if I'm against someone that relies on passives like BB, Void, Tiny, etc.  The way you choose Skadi/SnY depends on how good you are doing.  300+ games on Slark w/ ~75% winrate - Normal and High skill  *Also you want to max Pact by 7 and farm jungle, Slark is pretty fast farmer when he has treads + aquila, just remember to tread switch."

TrueDoTA2,3b6zz5,bravo_six,4,Fri Jun 26 15:45:01 2015 UTC,"Yep, put on int for when your about to use a spell, and if you are getting regen set them to agi for max value.

TrueDoTA2,3b6zz5,BuffKunkka,1 point,Sat Jun 27 16:54:40 2015 UTC,"Couldn't you cast it, as int, and then switch to str before the damage hits? Wouldn't that be the ideal situation?"

TrueDoTA2,3b6zz5,CaptainPlatypus,1 point,Fri Jun 26 18:51:54 2015 UTC,"Its not really necessary though, you regenerate fast enought when running between camps/lane.

TrueDoTA2,3b6zz5,FabulousMrFox,2,Fri Jun 26 19:08:01 2015 UTC,"It's not remotely necessary once you have items (and levels), but early on it helps a lot. And like I said, it's good for you - playing fast helps you develop as a player."
TrueDoTA2,3b6zz5,CaptainPlatypus,1 point,Fri Jun 26 20:21:58 2015 UTC,"Its not really necessary though   If you don't want to spend time waiting to regen and not farming, it is necessary before level 11."
TrueDoTA2,3b6zz5,subraizada3_,1 point,Sat Jun 27 01:49:09 2015 UTC,Well I kinda agree what other guy replied to you. Mana is more precious to Slark and tread switching is worth it while HP isn't necesary that much since you have ult passive to heal you.  Doing that in fight however might not be bad idea if you can pull it off.
TrueDoTA2,3b6zz5,bravo_six,3,Fri Jun 26 19:30:58 2015 UTC,"You get both the mana and the hp with the double switch. Mana is deducted when you cast dark pact, health is deducted when it triggers. So int treads dark pact cast, strength treads dark pact trigger, agi treads clear camp, repeat. It's strictly better than not double switching, especially early. At level 10 with treads, aquila, and maxed dark pact, you're saving ~3% of your max health each dark pact. Think of it as every dark pact costing one second less of regen time if you double swap your treads - which means every double swap gains you a second of farming (or fighting) time. If you max dark pact first, at level 7 you're saving 6% of your hp every dark pact by double tapping, which is two seconds of farming time.  Basically, if you don't have either a major health item (point booster or ogre club, at minimum) on top of treads/aquila/wand, level 2 ult, or both, double swap your treads when you dark pact. It's three extra button presses over two seconds, you can handle that."
TrueDoTA2,3b6zz5,CaptainPlatypus,0,Fri Jun 26 20:40:39 2015 UTC,"Since you seem like a decent tier player, what's your go to build on Slark?

Pounce is your close-the-distance and escape skill, and typically the first skill to max out. After Level 6, Slark excels at harassing lanes, ganking and picking off lone squishy targets or hero's retreating with low HP. It's less about ""waiting for that perfect gank"" (like you would Bounty Hunter), and more about using your mobility to be anywhere and everywhere applying pressure and looking for those opportunities.   Treads + S&Y usually means you've got extended night vision, max movespeed, pounce on low CD, a maim/slow, Insane health regen, A 4 second invis, and stat steal. I'd typically only build into Silver Edge late game if I'm running into a lot of lock-down and stun and need the passive disable."

I think Silver is a little under-rated.  It's a great way to consolidate item slots, and it keeps silver edge's relevance into the far lategame.    I could see a build like Treads -> Aquilia -> Wand -> Sblade -> SnY -> Silver.  Going silver lets you keep your wand and still have a slot for TP, for example.    Probably wouldnt build silver first unless there was something like a BB or PA or Huskar or Timber or whoever with a passive worth disabling.    SnY + Silver is neat because the maims stack.  Giving a high chance to maim and a chance to double maim which is pretty big in aspeed slow mspeed slow."

TrueDoTA2,3b6zz5,bacbac,1 point,Fri Jun 26 20:28:13 2015 UTC,"Both builds are situational. Generally you build bulk + bkb if your enemies are full of nukers, build SnY if your enemies are mixed of both nukers/right clickers, and SE if they are mainly rightclickers.  On a side note, your builds are emphasized on solo ganking to amass networth advantage, which is ok in general, but it may backfire if the enemy plays cautiously and group up very soon to take down towers & buy early gem. In that case I suggest getting an intermediate item that helps your hp & mana like Drum. It's amazing both in teamfight and solo gank, costs less than SnY."

TrueDoTA2,3b4sik,kapnoc,13,Thu Jun 25 23:39:30 2015 UTC,I feel that Rod of Atos has become a very strong situational pickup on him now that you get 30 int for 2 staff of wizardry's plus the health bonus. It still acts as a item you get while ahead as it does not provide a form of escape like force staff and bkb but can be a very good 2nd item pickup as long as you are not behind in farm. It also benefits in soft-initiating teamfights due to its absurd range. I have yet to try other builds like aghs.
TrueDoTA2,3b4sik,deanwac,6,Fri Jun 26 00:24:27 2015 UTC,"Atos should be considered on any int carry when playing against a natural linken's purchaser, like weaver"
TrueDoTA2,3b4sik,docmartens,3,Fri Jun 26 04:07:28 2015 UTC,"I actually consider Atos core on him. It gives him insane amounts of damage, control and health if you don't go for the mek build. I often get kited as OD, so I get Atos + Forcestaff. Makes for tons of damage early on, had great success with it."
TrueDoTA2,3b4sik,Maxaalling,1 point,Fri Jun 26 12:30:51 2015 UTC,I like playing OD because there are a lot of INT options for him. He is one of the heroes that benefits most from increasing intelligence and you can do that in creative ways.
TrueDoTA2,3b4sik,Gaston44,11,Wed Jul 8 22:19:48 2015 UTC,"Rod of Atos is really good on him.  I've also been playing around with a Shadow Blade (similar to Slasher's Silencer) into Rod of Atos build that works alright as long as they don't go into a 5 man death ball.  As usual, if they have detection, this build loses a lot of its strength, but the attack speed is always appreciated.  That being said, this build lets you get some really good pick offs, especially if you have a very hard carry that's taking all of the farm on the map.    Also, consider an Eye of Skadi on OD.  If you do the math, it is the second best item on him next to Moon Shard (not consumed) in terms of DPS from Arcane orb.  It is the second highest mana item behind Octarine core, and in addition, it gives a bit over 3.5 armor, good attack speed, and a lot of health.  Plus, the slow is an added effect when people activate BKB, so you can at least slow them when Arcane orb is shut down.  I find that the health from this item is great at making up for OD's reputation as a glass cannon.  I've done a couple games where I got VERY ahead and got 3-4 Skadi's and the HP and damage were both amazing all things considered.    I like to, in general, go Treads + bottle -> Rod of Atos -> [optional BKB] -> Eye of Skadi -> [optional BKB] -> Scythe of Vice -> Octarine Core -> [Second Eye of Skadi or Shiva's Guard].  This build is a little right click focused, but I like that in world that most of the opposing team buys BKB and can dodge your ult.  If I'm looking for more utility, I'll go for Mana boots + mek (with the idea of turning it into GG boots in the future) and build Rod of Atos, Scythe of Vice, and/or Shavia's Guard depending on the situation.  This build works well if they want to 5 man push from early on, as it is good for team fight and gets you a high Int rating for the ultimate.  I also like refresher -> Agh's in conjunction with a utility build, as that combination is really strong if you can catch a lot of people with your first ultimate.    Also, if you do the math, Orchid gives better DPS than Rod of Atos in terms of Arcane Orb damage, but the added chase potential and suvivability from Atos is great in practice.    Force staff and blink are both very good for mobility, but I've only had bad experiences using them for initiation.  Of course, they are great defensively, but good positioning and/or a BKB are much better for this in my experience.   I don't like MKB on OD at all, but it is a necessary pick up if the opposing team has evasion."
TrueDoTA2,3b4sik,GTAero,3,Fri Jun 26 08:19:56 2015 UTC,Care to elaborate why you build a bottle on OD?
TrueDoTA2,3b4sik,Mefistofeles1,2,Sat Jun 27 20:47:44 2015 UTC,"There are a few reasons.  Note that this is assuming you're playing mid - if you're going for a safelane OD, then I probably wouldn't bother with one.  What follows is a lot of math, but let it suffice to say that a bottle is really good for both health and mana regen, even on OD.    Health Regen:  Be it normal wear and tear from harassment, a particularly harsh round of harassment, barely surviving a gank, or needing to get back to full after ganking/harassing yourself, you tend to need a fair amount of health regen throughout your time in the mid lane.  OD doesn't have much health himself, so the regen from bottle will keep you topped off and keep you from being susceptible to ganks or being forced out of lane.  I find tangos to be underwhelming once the enemy team has burst/lockdown and the one-shot nature of salve makes it much less useful when you expect lots of damage coming your way.  This justification is pretty much the same as for all other mid heros.  Mana Regen:  I assume this is why you're skeptical about this build.  I like to be pretty aggressive in lane, so I'll be harassing with my spells a decent amount, thus using a lot of mana.  His aura does provide mana regen, but it is a little underwhelming and unreliable during the laneing stage.  To illustrate this, let's do a little math.   Essence aura 40% proc chance with [10%,15%,20%,25%] mana restoration.  At level 1, you have 388 mana without any items/levels into anything.  At level 16 you have 1007 mana without any items/levels.  I think this makes it safe to assume 1000 mana as an ""upper bound"" and 500 as a ""lower bound"" to your mana during the laneing/early game stages, and thus it is good to illustrate my points.  With a 40% chance to proc, this means you gain 40 mana per spell on average at the upper bound and 20 mana per spell on average at the lower bound.  Once Essence aura is maxed out, you gain 100 mana per spell on average at the upper bound 50 mana per spell on average at the lower bound.  With arcane orb costing 100 mana, astral imprisonment costing [120,140,160,180] mana , and sanity's eclipse costing [175,250,325] mana, you are only barely making up the cost of arcane orb once essence aura is maxed out (when most people say you can spam arcane orb) and that is only if you have at least 1000 mana.  You're still losing mana on your other spells, which is bad for a hero who likes to spam his spells both offensively and defensively.  If you have less than 1000 mana, then you will quickly loose all of mana if you're not careful when trying to zone out or kill your lane opponent or if you try to help another lane.  But the picture gets even more grim for the hero with supposedly ""infinite mana.""  I previously talked about averages for mana regeneration, but that's obviously not how statistics work.  In statistics, the average is the result of many instances of more or less likely events.  The average is probably the most boring one of these to look at.  I'm not sure what pseudo-random number generator the boys and girls at Valve are using, but it doesn't matter too much for a qualitative exploration, assuming that it is sufficiently random (in particular, I am assuming that there is no correlation between the likelihood of one spell procing essence aura and the next spell procing it).  At a 40% proc rate, it means that 60% of the time you do not get any mana.  Out of those 60% of the time, again, 60% of the time you don't get any mana.  If you keep going with this math, in order to receive mana once with 75% certainty, you would have to cast a spell 2.7 times (3 times gets you 78.4% certainty).  In order to receive mana once with 90% certainty, you would have to cast a spell 4.5 times (5 times gets you 92.3% certainty).  In order to receive mana once with 99% certainty, you would need to cast a spell 9 times.  With your cheapest spell (arcane orb), that is a mana cost of 900 for a return of 250 mana with maxed essence aura and 1000 mana.  In this unlikely scenario, the mana cost can be devastating when you were relying on essence aura.  Even in the much more likely case of getting one proc after 5 spells are cast, you get 250 mana for a minimum 500 mana investment.  Note that for you to be 92% sure that you will recover the cost of 5 arcane orb casts, you need 2000 mana, which is quite a lot.  These unlikely events are averaged out by other unlikely events that you will get several procs in a row, but that knowledge won't do anything to keep you warm at night when you run out of mana and thus get a kill turned around on you.  EDIT: I wasn't clear above - all of the math for your certainty is done under the assumption of a maxed out essence aura.  In the very early game, this is not the case, and these numbers get even worse - while you still have the same number of attacks for a given certainty of getting a single proc, you get less mana out of that proc, so it is easier to run out of mana as you don't make up for all the attacks where it didn't proc.  So to return to the original question, why do I need a bottle for mana regen.  First is because, on average, I am still losing mana when I use OD's spells in the early to mid game.  Thus, in order to use more spells, I need to regen that mana.  Plus, arcane orb's damage is based off of mana, so it is best to keep your mana pool high.  Also, it is to counter unlikely events where I will not get any regen for his relatively expensive spells.  In these cases, it gives me more spells to cast before I'm out of mana (and thus a higher certainty that I will get some procs before I run out).  This is why OD has ""infinite mana"" in the late game.  You have a massive mana pool, so odds are that you will get a proc before you run out.  Even if you require 99.99% certainty that you will get a proc, that will require 18 spells to be cast, but you have over 1800 mana, so you can keep casting without worry even in that very very unlikely event (and will then get back up to full rather quickly, as each proc will give a lot of mana). Mid fight in the early/mid game, you may run out of mana, as discussed - the bottle allows you get get back above 100 mana so you can cast another arcane orb and pray to get an essence aura proc so you can keep going or get enough mana for your ultimate/astral imprisonment.  I used to not build bottle on him until I got sick of running out of mana and missing kills because of it."
TrueDoTA2,3b4sik,GTAero,1 point,Sun Jun 28 04:10:17 2015 UTC,"Damn, what a good, detailed responses. Thanks a lot!  After you have done the math, I can see how a bottle can be useful.

TrueDoTA2,3b4sik,Gaston44,5,Wed Jul 8 22:33:11 2015 UTC,"I think skipping Force Staff is the ideal thing to do now - Eul's and Rod of Atos give you better bang for your buck depending on what you/your team needs, and a Glimmer Cape is a more effective escape/defensive item for similar cost (and the IAS more than makes up for the small loss in INT.)  Agh's is... it's kind of only worth having with Agh's+Refresher for the automatic Rampage highlight reel stuff.  I guess it has a time and a place but I feel like that place is ultra late game.  Mekansm is still probably an option for OD.  With 65 sec cd, I don't know how much of an option, but it's still there."

TrueDoTA2,3b4sik,SoupKitchenHero,3,Sat Jun 27 19:35:55 2015 UTC,"I believe that OD is not very viable in this patch. The hero is one of my favourite, but he needs some ""dead time"" after the laning phase to furtherly capitilize on the advantage he gets in 98% of the lanes in the game.  My points being:    His ultimate which is his only damaging skill he can actually use untill his aura is maxed out has an ABSURDLY long cooldown. In this patch, skirmishes break out every few seconds and this doesn't play into the early power of the OD.   People usually have mexican stand offs in mid, with a lot of gap closing heros (like Pudge or Clockwerk). One of OD's powers in this standoff is that if an enemy, say, Vengeful Spirit wants to stun somebody in this type of stand offs and initiate a fight, she will have to get Imprisoned before she uses her stun (due to range) which means they will have already lost half their intelligence pool (around minute 10-12). Well, when the range gap is closed within an instance, OD can't play to his maximum power.    It's pretty easy to destroy a won fight with Sanity's Eclipse Aghanim's upgrade.    One of his almost unique essences, the Pure Damage right click he possesses, able to counter stuff like Winter Wyvern, can be gotten by a Silencer which is a much more optimal pick in 6.84 due to Slowing Last Word and Global that turns those early skirmishes around for the team having Silencer.   I feel that the new items don't compliment him all that great. Sure the lifesteal by Octarine Core is very good but the cooldown reduction on a hero that his basic skill has 0 cooldown is almost wasted (sure does remove a big chunk out of his ult cooldown though). Hex got nerfed, Mekansm got nerfed and OD doesn't want to get greaves, Solar Crest makes him miss 30% of his attacks which hurts A LOT and so on.    So in general, I think that OD is not at a very good place right now, hence his damn low pick rate in competitive."
TrueDoTA2,3b4sik,L3vathiaN-,1 point,Fri Jun 26 09:35:49 2015 UTC,"In any case, if you really want to play OD, I suggest playing with heavy mobilty. Which means both Blink Dagger and Force staff. One of the favourite styles I like to use on OD is initiation focused OD. Blink -> Astral a support(preferably someone low int so he gets one shotted later on) -> Hex someone without evasion -> Astral Orb them thrice ->Drop the hammer (Sanity's Eclipse) -> Force close to your team and Astral Orbwalk from there till there are only few enemy heros left, by which point you can autoattack without caring that much."
TrueDoTA2,3b4sik,L3vathiaN-,2,Fri Jun 26 09:43:50 2015 UTC,"I believe od's main issue at the moment is his weak mid game.  Od can easily dominate his lane and become a late game monster, yet there is that phase between 10 and 30 minutes in which you right click isnt yet that strong ( you need to max out aura and then your orb and then get some mana pool).  In this period of time you need mobility and you need bkb in order to fight, and even with a good amount of farm when you have then you still lack survivability and damage output.  I believe octarine core is massive on od, cd reduction on inprisonment and ulti is good, lifesteal on orb is good... But ehat people forget is that octarine gives you a shitload of mana and sone good and really needed hps."
TrueDoTA2,3b4sik,RampagingRagE,2,Fri Jun 26 10:37:52 2015 UTC,"OD is probably my best hero so I'll throw in my thoughts quickly.  I think Aghs can be great if you have another big wombo to follow up with. If someone picks tide or enigma on you team I would seriously consider going for force ->blink ->aghs ->refresher. Make sure you are the initiator and don't screw up the ravage!!!  If I don't have that combo ability I will not get the aghs. In a typical game I'll go Null Tango ->Bottle ->Treads ->Force. From there I find that getting a BKB is usually the way to go. After that I've been going straight octarine.  OD becomes a real brawler with the hp form BKB and Octarine and also the lifesteal.  For skill build, I find that getting 1 level of arcane orb helps my farm immensely, but you got to have 3 levels in aura for you to be able to spam orbs. So I go 1-1-3-1. I sacrifice int steal for better farm basically."
TrueDoTA2,3b4sik,Mcseamus03,2,Fri Jun 26 15:57:28 2015 UTC,"Nobody mentioned Midas? I think Midas is pretty strong on OD, and is core for me. He's good at farming it early, since you can take advantage of your overwhelming laning dominance in 99% of matchups to get it up fairly quickly. It gives him pretty much everything he needs; a reliable gold source since he's not the best farmer, attack speed, and MUCH needed XP to stay ahead of the enemy in levels.   The latter's advantage is further amplified by your ult which will deal much more damage if you're higher in level than your enemy.  In addition it also allows you to come online quicker since you absolutely need level 14 to reach your true potential in farming as well as fighting, since your Orb, which accelerates your farm and is your main damage source is the skill maxed last."
TrueDoTA2,3b4sik,Angry_Doge,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:06:50 2015 UTC,"I'd probably do Force Orchid Hex Refresher with an optional BKB this patch. After such, go Aghs Octarine for the teamfight or Shivas MKB for the consistent right click. Moonshard is also a solid pickup on this hero, solving his lack of attack speed."
TrueDoTA2,3b4sik,TheArchist,1 point,Fri Jun 26 03:11:34 2015 UTC,"Aghs on OD has been absolutely cancerous in ranked games I've had. It's probably extremely good in parties and teams that can coordinate, but in solo ranked it's terrible most of the time. You'll get tons of whiffed ultimates just because of it."
TrueDoTA2,3b4sik,blueopal,1 point,Fri Jun 26 20:04:42 2015 UTC,"This may sound very wrong but it works. An OD and Silencer dual lane just wrecks the opponents. OD being the carry and silencer being the support. The opponents wont have mana to spam anything, and if they die a few times the have to switch their treads to intelligence to even do something. In the beginning OD maxes his essence aura so Silencer can spam his abilities. OD builds a force staff, atos, aghanims, Shiva's Guard and a complimentary octarine core. While silencer builds Euls, force staff, Scythe of vyse. The pure damage is insane and I believe they can even fight 2 v 5 and win with the amount of disables available.   I have tried this and once it went so good that the opponents just left the lane and went jungling or something. The juggernaut laning against us was completely useless in terms of using abilities."
TrueDoTA2,3b4sik,hfbvm,1 point,Sun Jun 28 13:44:18 2015 UTC,"Aghs = best item vs a 3-4 agi deathball linup when you have a refresher first.  Blink is an awesome escape on him if you get some extra gold, but it gives no int. It is good if they are squishy and have no way to initiate on you but hit you."
TrueDoTA2,3b4sik,likes-beans,-1,Sun Jun 28 17:09:18 2015 UTC,"seriously...  OD has an amazing early game advantage.   shadow blade gives OD much needed AS & escape. aghanims give OD initiation and right click power early/mid game. Octarine gives OD sustain & right click power. Shivas guard gives tanking & right click power & even a slow for escape/chase.   OD's a tier 1.5 hero. Not the best, but certainly better than many others. Do you guys really know how to play?"
TrueDoTA2,3b2zt6,goblinbiddin,10,Thu Jun 25 15:33:50 2015 UTC,"Would you agree with adding clockwerk to this list? I really like leveling cogs and spamming that to totally drain supports, flare is spammable, and battery assault ensures you win duels when they're trying to zone you. Most of the time anyway."
TrueDoTA2,3b2zt6,thurrs,3,Thu Jun 25 17:21:09 2015 UTC,I have to agree with this one. I especially like grabbing boots early on clock as a poor boot-less support will be crying when they see a CW running at them at lvl3 with lvl2 Q and boots.
TrueDoTA2,3b2zt6,V-ktr,0,Thu Jun 25 18:32:19 2015 UTC,I said this in another comment but I think maxing cogs first is wayyy underrated. You can keep the whole trilane oom if they are not staying back. And if they're staying back maybe yu can farm. 200 mana drain for 50 mana and it's not hard to land.
TrueDoTA2,3b2zt6,thurrs,3,Thu Jun 25 22:53:40 2015 UTC,"Now here I'm going to have to disagree. Maxing cogs? If you mean to get it like 4points by lvl7 I think you're doing something really really wrong. The exp starting at what lvl 8 or 9 is double of what it was for previous levels and you should be using the exp difference from being in a dual or tri lane scenario to make space / get kills etc.   Max E isn't optimal for this but gets you decent farm and is an alright nuke but I think you want to go max Q whenever possible. You can get easy solo kills on low level supports as you do an insane amount of dmg if all tics hit and yeah, once fights break out, what are you going to be doing with maxed cogs? Creating havoc and draining some mana I guess but I don't see that being nearly as valuable as potentially kills with solo hook shots or just decent dmg with lvl 2-3 rocket if you go a split build like 2-1-2-1"
TrueDoTA2,3b2zt6,V-ktr,1 point,Fri Jun 26 00:25:33 2015 UTC,I guess I'm thinking that cogs can actually break a lane so effectively that the mid game won't need maxed shrapnel.
TrueDoTA2,3b2zt6,thurrs,1 point,Fri Jun 26 19:36:05 2015 UTC,"Ehhh idk, I mean if going by damage its actually comparable to max rocket (200 for both) with similar cooldowns 16 vs 15 while it also provides 50% uptime on his cogs and potentially 200 mana drain but costs 80 mana over 50 mana and I still don't see you getting kills or enough impact with maxing of either W or E.   If you play a game and can prove me wrong please do so but my gut just tells me that you can't compare to maxing Q."
TrueDoTA2,3b2zt6,V-ktr,1 point,Fri Jun 26 20:27:53 2015 UTC,"You know, as I thought about arguing that kills are not as valuable as dominating your lane, i realized I'm a couple patches behind in my contemplation of the meta game right now. So yeah, maxing q is probably better, you're right. But personally I only do one point in flare for scouting because i think cogs in lane is still great. You dont really get kills with flare, realistically you might get one in a game. Leveling cogs will definitely help win your lane more than flare, and that'll make up with the less farm from not having flare."
TrueDoTA2,3b2zt6,thurrs,1 point,Fri Jun 26 23:14:17 2015 UTC,"Thank you :)  I haven't played much CW this patch but thinking about it I think you have a pretty good point in prioritizing W over E. I had always done like 4-1-1-1 into 4-1-4-1 just because but the scaling dmg is similar to cogs, and the mana cost is the same for E and the CD reduction isn't THAT important... considering you're the offlaner and often roaming about, aka not a lot of levels, I think going for a 4-4-1(maybe 2?)-1 is a legit build. I'm going to have to play around with the idea a little in unranked."
TrueDoTA2,3b2zt6,V-ktr,1 point,Sat Jun 27 01:18:57 2015 UTC,"I generally consider clock to be a survival offlaner, but he definitely can apply some pressure with rocket and the threat of cog/battery. He can also get some work done burning mana with the outside of the cogs. Mostly he's going to mess with your creep equilibrium and farm under his own tower until level 6, and then go ganking."
TrueDoTA2,3b2zt6,5414496,4,Thu Jun 25 19:51:50 2015 UTC,"Ok so there are survival offlaners, pressure offlaners. What else?"
TrueDoTA2,3b2zt6,Harlequeens,5,Thu Jun 25 19:52:29 2015 UTC,Last-pick Broodmother AKA nightmare offlaner...
TrueDoTA2,3b2zt6,Juracule,2,Thu Jun 25 23:39:36 2015 UTC,"Those are basically the two kinds of solo offlaners, then you can run a dual offlane, which is still similar enough to be considered an ""offlane"" whereas i consider an aggro tri to be a much different animal."
TrueDoTA2,3b2zt6,thurrs,1 point,Thu Jun 25 19:59:32 2015 UTC,Greedy offlaners like centaur.
TrueDoTA2,3b2zt6,thurrs,1 point,Sun Jun 28 07:35:36 2015 UTC,"Centaur seems like a ""Bad offlaner"" right now, which i wouldn't put into either category... the trilanes are getting just a bit too strong for him right now."
TrueDoTA2,3b2zt6,Ailodierap,3,Mon Jun 29 21:19:00 2015 UTC,I think using cogs to drain mana is wayyy underrated but I've only done it a few times to be able to really talk about it. It was successful if i recall. I'll try again today i think.
TrueDoTA2,3b2zt6,prezuiwf,2,Thu Jun 25 22:51:11 2015 UTC,"It's quite good, but can be a little tricky to pull off, and if you miss it can be trouble. (they're in the cogs!)"
TrueDoTA2,3b2zt6,James_McNulty,1 point,Thu Jun 25 23:16:33 2015 UTC,With just a little practice it's easy and a fun move to spam! And do it far so if you do miss then they are outside but they don't trigger a cog.
TrueDoTA2,3b2zt6,KhazM,2,Thu Jun 25 23:32:26 2015 UTC,"What factors contribute towards your item choices? For instance you're playing Tidehunter. What do you look at to decide on choosing Mek (or Pipe/Crimson Guard), versus an early Arcane Boots, versus a pure Blink rush?"
TrueDoTA2,3b2zt6,KhazM,3,Thu Jun 25 16:31:18 2015 UTC,"Tide should pretty much be going arcane + blink almost no matter what, but generally an offlaner wants to make sure that after his absolute musts are finished, his team has whatever combination of guardians/pipe/crimson his team needs, even if it means buying all three. Obviously heroes like LC are an exception, and need to be picked with the thought in mind that another core needs to get these pickups."
TrueDoTA2,3b2zt6,Thalnagath,2,Thu Jun 25 16:59:21 2015 UTC,What about a carry Necro fitting into this role? I've never tried it but the natural harass from Heartstopper Aura plus the heal/damage from Death Pulse seems like he could wear down an enemy trilane pretty well if played effectively.
TrueDoTA2,3b2zt6,KhazM,5,Thu Jun 25 17:43:01 2015 UTC,"I've played a ton of Necro, and unfortunately this isn't a good plan.  He's too squishy early, too easy to burst down.  Good supports will stand outside aura, then combo you with abilities.  You'll get one Death Pulse off, which will not be enough to save you.  Plus you need farm for early Mek or Aghs, neither of which you'll get good timing for as an offlaner."
TrueDoTA2,3b2zt6,Thalnagath,3,Thu Jun 25 17:48:45 2015 UTC,"First of all, we're probably not going to carry from the solo offlane position, especially not with an offlaner designed to pressure. Necro also has the issue that he wants to be getting last hits, so he can keep up his mana, which will be very difficult in the offlane. It's possible there's a way to make it work, however. Those are just some things to keep in mind if you try it."
TrueDoTA2,3b2zt6,KhazM,2,Thu Jun 25 19:45:47 2015 UTC,I would want to ask how you pressure ranged carries in the safe lane.  Right now all the heroes don't really pressure ranged carries very well.  Darkseer and Tidehunter are particularly bad against ranged carries because their harrass isn't effective.  Clock also should never be able to harrass the ranged carry without dying for it.
TrueDoTA2,3b2zt6,Thalnagath,2,Thu Jun 25 19:19:28 2015 UTC,"Darkseer does... Ok.. against ranged carries because he makes them farm under tower with ion shell on the creeps. Tide is pretty bad against ranged carries, to be sure. LC can catch them in OO, and clock can hit them with rocket a bit and then make them farm under tower with lower health. This can burn through regen and make them vulnerable, while also pushing the lane back out when the tower's finished with the creeps.  Mostly to contest a ranged carry's farm you want to win the duel with the supports, and then get in there and deny a couple of their creeps. Ranged carries pretty generally have lower attack damage than melee ones."
TrueDoTA2,3b2zt6,emets,2,Thu Jun 25 19:40:09 2015 UTC,"If clock is levelling his rocket, the supports have done their job.  His kill potential is so much higher when you get Q maxed at level 7."
TrueDoTA2,3b2zt6,Daemon_Monkey,1 point,Thu Jun 25 20:37:29 2015 UTC,Level 2 rocket level 2 battery is pretty common and it's more than enough to mess with creep equilibrium and annoy the carry.
TrueDoTA2,3b2zt6,docmartens,1 point,Thu Jun 25 20:50:05 2015 UTC,His damage potential is higher with rockets.
TrueDoTA2,3b2zt6,Klugen,2,Fri Jun 26 15:27:33 2015 UTC,"That's not true.  Battery Assault does 1280 damage when maxed.  Rocket does 200 when maxed.  The only time you want to get rockets is when you are getting harassed out of lane.  To put that into context, you would need to hit all 3 heroes in the trilane in order to do similar amounts of damage."
TrueDoTA2,3b2zt6,Klugen,1 point,Fri Jun 26 18:36:50 2015 UTC,That's assuming you get all battery hits off and on the same target. Rocket has huge aoe and global range making it very easy to hit multiple targets with it. 1pt battery is also far stronger than 1pt rocket. 1pt rocket is worthless for anything except vision.
TrueDoTA2,3b2zt6,Najda,2,Fri Jun 26 19:09:00 2015 UTC,"I feel like the best way for offlaners to pressure the carry is to be able to contest support pulls.  Rockets are less valuable when going to the offlane and midlane because they have levels and more items compared to the supports.  Now I'm not saying max them last, but I'm saying if I'm not getting pressured too hard in the offlane, I want to max battery assault because of the pickoff potential and the HUGE jump in damage."
TrueDoTA2,3b2zt6,Thalnagath,1 point,Fri Jun 26 19:57:15 2015 UTC,That I do agree with. Max battery clock can kill the carry if he can cogs them
TrueDoTA2,3b2zt6,Thalnagath,2,Fri Jun 26 22:22:24 2015 UTC,"One of my biggest difficulties is deciding when to leave the offlane.  I'll have to try the ""stay as long as you can make the carry miss 1 creep"" rule.  There are so many times where I hit 6 in a not-very-hard offlane, then leave it to try for a gank or give tp support somewhere else, and by the time I come back the enemy carry has gotten to a point where he's a lot harder to contest."
TrueDoTA2,3b2zt6,DHKany,2,Thu Jun 25 21:29:25 2015 UTC,"Sometimes that's also fine, you're not gonna be able to stay in the offlane forever, and eventually the carry will get farm. The rule of ""miss one more last hit but do not die"" is something I heard from a pro captain a while ago, it seems to be a good metric."
TrueDoTA2,3b2zt6,Juracule,2,Thu Jun 25 21:44:46 2015 UTC,Any reason you left undying off the list?  He seems the definition of a pressure offlaner.
TrueDoTA2,3b2zt6,Juracule,1 point,Fri Jun 26 03:43:19 2015 UTC,"The list isn't exhaustive, UD is certainly a pressure offlaner, i just named 3 that i have experience playing and a way to go about playing them, as examples"
TrueDoTA2,3b2zt6,thundrfang,1 point,Fri Jun 26 04:14:21 2015 UTC,venomancer is a pretty frustrating solo offlaner.  You have to watch him or he runs your carry down / puts the tower to half health.
TrueDoTA2,3b2zt6,Thalnagath,2,Thu Jun 25 22:10:31 2015 UTC,Problem is he's fast like a tractor and has no obvious ways of fucking with creep equilibrium from safety.
TrueDoTA2,3b1z0f,WellHungMan,18,Thu Jun 25 09:06:26 2015 UTC,"Wyvern's one of my favourite heroes and I love whenever I get to talk about her in this subreddit.  First off, no, don't get veil. You don't benefit enough from the cost when you could also get a medallion AND a glimmer cape for just a little bit more gold.  Glimmer Cape and Solar Crest are both amazing items that 6.84 gave us. Glimmer Cape being more important as it makes anyone you cold embrace pretty much completely immune to any damage, as we all pretty much know.  Solar Crest is another one of those items that Wyvern (who stays at the back) can place on allies to buff them and keep them alive.  Guardian Greaves are also great as a later pickup and for pushing relentlessly. Honestly 6.84 was a godsend for Wyvern, even with the nerfs she received directly."
TrueDoTA2,3b1z0f,EDJE,5,Thu Jun 25 12:37:52 2015 UTC,"I've heard a couple different casters refer to the ""GG crest"" now when they see a hard support hero like Dazzle or Wyvern manage to farm that item. The item is just so good on hard supports. It seems to usually happen around the time when the team's cores are ready to deathball, and Crest's 100% uptime forces any enemy physical damage dealers to focus the Crest holder, or else suffer severely reduced DPS."
TrueDoTA2,3b1z0f,freelance_fox,7,Thu Jun 25 17:35:04 2015 UTC,"Just a note: If you put two points into cold embrace, it has the same cooldown as glimmer cape (16 seconds). Cold embrace has 1000 range, while glimmer has 900 range, so it may be better to cold embrace first, then glimmer, if your teammate is close to dying."
TrueDoTA2,3b1z0f,Kittsy,1 point,Thu Jun 25 09:18:21 2015 UTC,"Due to the cast time, if you're aiming at a stationary target you're moving towards, you'll cast both at around the same time. Depends if the risk is magical/physical/what vision is available."
TrueDoTA2,3b1z0f,lonely_squirrel,7,Fri Jun 26 13:30:33 2015 UTC,"Her ultimate is just so good in the low-mmr pub meta.  Teams with too many carries, carries going glass cannon builds, everyone picking roaming gankers and building damage while ignoring teamfight ... all are very common in low mmr games where everyone wants to win on their own.  And your ult makes them kill each other.  You can make their team just melt their bkb carry.  No matter how badly you are getting stomped, you always have a chance to win a teamfight.    One item I would mention that is (justifiably) uncommon but quite good is a Skadi.  The synergy between Skadi and Cold Attack (Q) is amazing.  If I understand it correctly, the two slows stack additively which makes it a 75% slow at 1000 range.  This is insane.  Add in a force staff and the free pathing, and you can kite really really hard.  It's hard for heroes to even get near you.  She's got really good stat gain too, so late game her right click is no joke."
TrueDoTA2,3b1z0f,ItsDominare,3,Thu Jun 25 13:22:14 2015 UTC,"Her ultimate is just so good in the low-mmr pub meta.   My problem with this comment is that it implies that her ultimate is anything but incredibly potent at other levels of play.   Even if you use it on a single enemy its still a fast, point target stun that ignores immunity, and although BM's roar does some damage, has a slightly better cooldown and slightly longer duration, WW's curse has 800 range compared to roar's 600 which is a huge benefit to the former skill over the latter.  In other words, even if curse didn't have any AoE at all it'd still be a pretty good ultimate."
TrueDoTA2,3b1z0f,wildtarget13,4,Thu Jun 25 14:13:51 2015 UTC,"The slightly bad part is the problem of people not knowing what the hero does.  If I was returning to the game this patch, out of all the new things like glimmer capes and solar crests you might forget some of the thigns that changed about winter wyvern: the ultimate gives 3 seconds of survivability to the enemy team that is ""taunted"" by wyvern.  70% reduction can actually really nullify small cooldowns like a lina dragon slave+stun or gyro copter calldown. If you're coordinated, you have to time it to land after the winter's curse is over and the slow is applied. Same thing with wyvern's own spells.  Not to mention people blowing things like laguna blade on people in winter's curse. Even if they are low, they could take 70% of single target damage and survive for 3 seconds. In the worst case, 3 seconds of burst damage."
TrueDoTA2,3b1z0f,sclpls,3,Thu Jun 25 23:31:12 2015 UTC,"I don't see the comment as implying that the ultimate is bad at other levels of play, simply that it punishes a particular type of gameplay featured in low-MMR games, which is quite accurate. But yes, WW's ultimate is just a great, versatile ult."
TrueDoTA2,3b1z0f,lonely_squirrel,3,Fri Jun 26 00:00:15 2015 UTC,"Yes, this is what I meant.  At my trench tier it's always 2-1-2 lanes, with a carry in each side lane and a farming middle.  All 3 cores play as if they are only carry on the team because no one trusts their teammates.  It's really common to see over half the enemy team build burst right click dps.  WW is really good in that meta."
TrueDoTA2,3b1z0f,freelance_fox,3,Fri Jun 26 08:59:43 2015 UTC,"So I've built Skadi on my core Wyvern in 2-3 games. It's good, but not game-changing. If you keep getting bursted down by mixed damage it's the best choice to tank her up and remain aggressive, and also theoretically it can be used for extreme kiting against heroes who are vulnerable to that, like Ursa Naix or Sven, but against straight magic burst damage BKB or Pipe is usually better and against physical DPS, Assault Cuirass and Shiva's are both really good on her. In games where you can afford an item like Skadi on Wyvern, 9/10 times you've already won the game before you get the Skadi."
TrueDoTA2,3b1z0f,lonely_squirrel,2,Thu Jun 25 17:30:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I haven't had a lot of game with her yet, but after coming back from a 35k deficit I'm planning on playing more of her.  In that game I was really impressed with the Skadi.  Part of it I think was that we had an exposed throne and so just surviving wasn't good enough.  The attack slow and damage was more useful for defending structures.  They also had a ton of physical dps versus heroes and a Luna with Aghs, and multiple invis initiators, so the requirements you mentioned are there.  Just needed to tank up to survive a burst so that I could force staff out and heal.  One thing I was really surprised with though was how good the skadi was at cleaning up.  There came a point when our carry eventually came online and they couldn't win a team fight anymore.  Once that happened and their pushes stalled in our base, they could basically never disengage.  Against WW with blink+force+skadi, you are going to get caught.  That's what impressed me."
TrueDoTA2,3b1z0f,freelance_fox,1 point,Fri Jun 26 13:25:04 2015 UTC,"I really like where you're going with this build! I would try picking up an early OoV to further emphasize her catch, and honestly farming up and going Blink -> Force -> Skadi just for pure control doesn't sound too bad. I think thisbuild would be a good candidate for Orchid, Daedalus, Moon Shard, etc, which are some of the safer, more straight-forward damage items on her. If you're already staying alive the whole fight might as well build damage, right?"
TrueDoTA2,3b1z0f,freelance_fox,7,Fri Jun 26 16:55:26 2015 UTC,"In a nutshell, I play Wyvern more greedily than just about anyone. My view of Wyvern started out as a Dota 2 player who had never played Dota 1, so I never got to try her until she was ported. She sounds like such a support on paper, primarily due to Cold Embrace, that I had always written her off as a hard-5-role hero, a role I avoid playing at all costs. I play 2/3/4 mainly and usually mid at that, so even when learning a new hero that doesn't go mid I'll usually play them mid against bots and in unranked pubs. This led me to a love of solo mid Rhasta (Shadow Shaman), for example, that probably explains why I play that hero overly aggressively when forced to run him as a support.  Playing Wyvern mid made me realize just how appropriate this playstyle is on her. The cornerstone of her kit is actually Splinter Blast, as I see it. While a fairly ordinary nuke at first glance, it's among the top flash-farming skills in the game (340 damage/7s). I've noodled this question some and I think the only more effective aoe nukes, as far as damage per second, are Death Prophet's Crypt Swarm (300/4s), Leshrac's Lightning Storm (280/4s), and Pugna's Nether Blast (320/5.5s). That means that her teamfight contribution if she can stay alive spamming Splinter Blast is on par with one of those heroes, when looking strictly at their nukes.  Most Wyvern players don't farm Wyvern, however, and that makes it harder for them to stay alive making this contribution. Instead, they're only concerned about their allies, probably hanging back waiting to use Cold Embrace and Winter's Curse.   The great thing about Wyvern is that all four of her spells have above average range. The time your dinky support Wyvern spends standing back and plinking away with maybe one Burn's worth of weak right-click damage plus one or two Splinter Blasts, that's the time that core Wyvern spends eating enemies alive and forcing them to run. She doesn't have to get out of position to DPS thanks to Arctic Burn, playing very much like Sniper during its max level 30% uptime (6s uptime/20s cooldown).  Picking & Laning Wyvern:  First I just want to talk about my experiences playing Wyvern, since it's almost certainly different than most of yours. I've got 34 recorded Wyvern games, with an average GPM of 403, winrate hovering around 60%, and maybe 8-10 of those being support Wyvern games. ~3 of those games were solo offlane and the rest solo mid. I don't subscribe to the 5-position Wyvern that builds Glimmer Cape and does nothing but save people, but I would like to think I care more about playing with my team and winning than being in a particular lane. That, in fact, is what makes this hero so great to draft in Captain's Mode—she can fill nearly any role. I would hesitate to put her in the 1-position, but any other position she can build to fit.  Picking Wyvern in a pub, I almost never want to end up as the 5-position, so if it looks like I could end up with a 4-core+Wyvern lineup, I start complaining loudly until we can hopefully get another support. That doesn't mean she's poor at the 5-role, though—I think Wyvern is a pretty fantastic 5, I just personally prefer to play her greedily. She can do a lot with no farm, and the utility of Curse is really the reason to pick her as a 5. If you need a BKB-piercing disable and a save both, no other hero has that combo quite like Wyvern does. Dazzle and Oracle (and to some degree Omniknight) might have the stronger life-saving spells, but no other support has a kit that encompasses Wyvern's. Even Legion Commander, with Duel that pierces BKB and Press the Attack to strong dispel, still has to get up close and personal to cast those spells, while Wyvern can hang back coolly.  As a 4-position support, Wyvern can start to itemize more aggressively, but still won't be getting straight damage items like I do when I run her mid or offlane. I've tried farming stacks to accelerate farm as a 4-position Wyvern—like Sand King—but never have achieved a ""good"" result. Someone with more experience playing this role may be able to help me here, but with Soul Ring and maxed Splinter Blast, a support Wyvern can definitely find some jungle farm. Most Wyvern support players currently focus on roaming and harassing with the 50s cooldown level 1 Arctic Burn, and timing ganks so that the support can stack between Arctic Burn uses is key. Rune securing is another activity you can try to work into your movements, but I always find this role difficult. I saw Sonneiko get a Midas today directly after brown boots->soul ring in a game where he was standing in for Vega and they were getting far ahead early. I've never even considered Midas on the hero, because when I need a farm accelerator I go for Maelstrom every time. There's clearly a lot of optimization to be done in 4-position Wyvern play, and I don't have the answers, but I do want her to be as greedy as possible.  The situations to pick a mid or offlane Wyvern are much clearer to me than support Wyvern. She counters physical damage so excellently that in reality you would most often want to save a Wyvern pick for the end of the draft—once the enemy has revealed most of their heroes. Sven, Ursa, Troll, Juggernaut, Phantom Assassin, etc can all be for the most part ruined by her kit. As a solo laner she really starts to snowball hard around level 3, with her Soul Ring and level 2 Splinter Blast timing, but only if she hasn't been completely shut out or killed during the first few minutes of the game. I often try to get the 0 minute Bounty rune to get my Soul Ring ~2:30 into the game usually. Itemization after that really varies, but as long as you get a fair lane matchup you'll have the farm to get virtually whatever you want, from your Soul Ring timing til whenever the teams collapse and begin to move as 5.  1v1 I've found only a few select heroes really counter Wyvern: Queen of Pain, Outworld Decovourstroyveloper, and Viper are the ones coming to mind right now, but I know there are a couple others so I'll update this if I remember. If you pick her in a pub and ask yourself, ""Is this the game? Should I run Wyvern core?"" I would just ask myself whether there's a good chance of finding a somewhat easy solo lane. She has terrible base damage and projectile speed, meaning you have to overcome those things (usually for me with a Null Tally and by standing very close to the creeps). Make sure to practice this kind of thing once, as a solo Wyvern that gets shut out will offer her team very little. Ask your real supports to help you catch up by stacking >:(  Itemization & Skills:  I'm going to go into my core Wyvern item build first, and the way I usually play support Wyvern follows as a poorer version of that. For skill build, I always recommend maxing Splinter Blast first for max greed, although maxing Burn is a perfectly viable strategy for support Wyverns who can't find farm for a Soul Ring or equivalent mana item (it takes two of the following to spam as much as Soul Ring and to maintain that spam in fights: Arcane Boots, Urn, Medallion, Euls). There are also situational items that apply to Wyvern just as with pretty much every hero: BKB is relevant in many Wyvern games, especially when she reaches Refresher Orb levels of farm. Linkens Sphere is really fun as a way for a farmed Wyvern to add extra life-saving power, especially against certain teams with heavy single-target spells. Work BKB and Linkens in whenever you need them, but keep in mind that you will slow your core progression in doing so.  Corevern Item Build:   Start with Tangos & Null Talisman Rush an early Soul Ring Then Brown Boots At this point, builds diverge into three different ways I like to build core Wyvern, depending on the situation:     My most used build: Maelstrom rush straight into Mask of Madness. She functions just like Sniper but is tankier, safer, longer range, and has more utility. She's not better than Sniper at being Sniper, but she is 30% of the time. This build is all about movement speed and attack speed—enough to allow her to get solo pickoffs. Necrobook rush. This build used to feel less impactful because it took longer to ramp up; build #1 can solo-kill as soon as she gets Maelstrom, using Winter's Curse, whereas a rushed Necrobook was previously not very good at solo-killing enemies until Necrobook 3. With patch 6.84 she can now pretty much rush Necro just like Beastmaster, one of my other favorite heroes, and go around solo-killing enemies with it at level 1. Orchid rush. By far the riskiest build because it provides no intermediary benefits until you complete the 4075 gold item, this build has a high payoff against certain heroes like Anti-Mage, Storm Spirit, Morphling, Weaver, Queen of Pain, Puck, Ember Spirit, etc. It also dovetails most neatly into a hard-carry physical damage build of the 3. Orchid solves her mana problems for the rest of the game and ends up working out very efficiently item-slot-wise, leaving room for big-ticket damage items later.     As soon as I finish one of these cores, I always go for Boots of Travel. The movement speed and ability to greedily split farm is too strong, even if you don't build further movement speed items. People always ask about Phase Boots because they seem like a great pickup earlier on, to aid her slow movespeed and base damage, but I find that the 840 gold investment will rarely earn back that much gold in lasthits and kill money and deaths avoided. At this point I often combine core builds together and get Necrobook if I already have Maelstrom/MoM, or vice-versa. The vast majority of my core Wyvern games end at this point—around 30 minutes, when your fast-tempo pushing and huge teamfight damage contribution has pushed the enemy into their base.    (continued in my comment, I only barely went over the limit I promise it's not that long ;) )"
TrueDoTA2,3b1z0f,freelance_fox,3,Thu Jun 25 14:15:05 2015 UTC,"There are plenty of options to continue itemization, however:    There's Blink Dagger if you're one of those people—who insists on initiating instead of counter-initiating Or more damage if that's what your team needs, like Assault Cuirass, Mjollnir, Daedalus, Skadi for stats or to kite an enemy melee carry (early OoV is fun too), and wildly enough Moon Shard is fantastic on her, making her a serious nighttime hunter. Simply more utility including the venerable Refresher Orb if you just want teamfight superiority, Sheepstick (Scythe of Vyse) if you can find the farm for both, and Shiva's in rare games where you want more physical resistance than her kit already provides, such as a game where you can't afford to waste Embrace on yourself.    Support Wyvern Item Build:  I would say other people have it pretty much nailed down. Just incorporate Glimmer Cape, Force Staff, and Solar Crest into your baseline of small mana items, Guardian Greaves if no one else can get them, and don't forget about Drums of Endurance. If you hybridize any of these items with the more aggressive ones I mentioned above successfully, please drop me a line and let me know. I think Blink on support Wyvern (along with Sonneiko's two recent Midas pickups) is about the most aggressive I've seen anyone play her professionally. Sonneiko really likes BKB and of course Refresher as well.  I'm looking to improve this into a full fledged guide with images, videos, or potentially an infographic for the item build sometime soon. Let me know your thoughts and please also let me know if you try it out!"
TrueDoTA2,3b1z0f,freelance_fox,2,Thu Jun 25 22:54:46 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice. Last game I tried to time my rune rotations around my arctic burn cooldown, but as soon as I left the lane my carry gyro charged into the offlane SF and died. He proceeded to flame me all game for leaving the lane. So in general, I don't know if I should leave the carry alone anymore."
TrueDoTA2,3b1z0f,thurrs,1 point,Fri Jun 26 14:25:04 2015 UTC,"You're welcome! It's really important to establish expectations for your carry so this kind of thing doesn't happen. I usually use voice comms to tell the team when I make a rotation that leaves someone vulnerable, so it's up to them to adjust. Never assume people will notice when you leave lane to stack or get a rune—they're busy last-hitting most likely.  I'd say Wyvern prefers to be roaming to static in lane, I think you're doing it right. Just don't be too greedy in games where you can't afford it, e.g. level Cold Embrace at level 2 if you really need it, don't spend 3 minutes sitting waiting to gank the courier at the enemy mid-lane if your safe-lane is getting wrecked. I did this in one of my recent 4-position Wyvern losses: I went aggressive dual-laning with I think an Undying IIRC and left our safelane apparently to get crushed by the enemy solo-offlaner plus rotations. If I had stayed for the defensive tri-lane, I would have had less farm, but our 1-position PL would had more and we would have probably won."
TrueDoTA2,3b1z0f,greenhatman99,3,Fri Jun 26 17:04:18 2015 UTC,"I only play a few supports and ww is one of them, if the team drafts a lot of melee. Like, 3+. Her ult got a mega nerf but still rocks. A lot of times it will totally eliminate an enemy from the team fight and give a few seconds for your team to position around the guys smacking their friend. If you get 3 guys in the aura smacking their teammate, thats a 4 man lockdown. You don't really lose teamfights after this.   Early on you max her stupidly spammable nuke first, and cold embrace second. 1 point in dragon form and spam that on them when you can as well. Mana boots ASAP. Stack a camp 3x or 4x if you can and go sneak off and give it a couple nukes at around 6-7 minutes in for a nice gold boost. Be slightly greedy to get your mana boots, everyone benefits. She's fun and strong through all phases of the game once you have mana boots."
TrueDoTA2,3b1z0f,ItsDominare,3,Thu Jun 25 17:35:35 2015 UTC,"I am also a filthy WW picker.  I seem to do things slightly differently to most and often play her in the hard 5 role.  I almost always go for early tranqs - she is almost as slow as CM. I also ALWAYS take a point in the Q first, Arctic Burn is great lane harass and enables a good slow to go with the splinter blast to secure early kills in the laning stage. I normally go QWEWWRWEEEQ-or something to that effect.  Because ideally you want to be able to go Q-W-W in a teamfight and hopefully has a R and W left. And you don't have the mana to use Q whenever it is off CD. So getting more points in Q early is not always good. UNLESS - you need a lot more range to harass (damn you Lina) you need to freepath/escape more often etc. I then rush a Soul Ring. This is key because she is mana hungry and the old Tranq+Soul Ring combo, give her load of sustain and keeps you having to go base. It also mean you never have to waste cold embrace on yourself because you heal to full in less than 2 minutes most of the time.  Then the tough decisions begin - Either: Urn - Get this is they have a lot of blink initiators or a huskar (for pure) or because you know it will take a while to get medallion  Medallion --> Crest - My preferred option for everything people have already said about Solar Crest and Medallion. Also to always have an option to GO ROSH after a successful teamfight. She can tank rosh with cold embrace and crush him with crest. Euls --> If you are going to need to be a nuke lord! The move speed makes it possible for you to chase with Euls + Tranqs and catch with your Ulti. It gives a tone of sustain and NB is VERY necessary because she has no stun. If you have no other way to cancel TPs or Channeling it means you don't have to waste your ult to stop a CM/WD/Bane/Pudge etc channeling your team to death Force --> To save against, Lina, QoP, and Position swappers and RIKI. So you can get out the smoke and heal. Glimmer --> High Nuke lineups get EARLY, otherwise get late for epic soNNeiko saves. Mek/GG boots is a super luxury on her and I almost never build them. I think the 5 should NEVER push for Mek, too slow.  Last Point: If you are playing with QoP, Lina, Lion or any other SuperNuke hero then try to warn them about the 70% reduction to the cursed and safe your ulti for catch, BKB carriers."
TrueDoTA2,3b1z0f,freelance_fox,2,Thu Jun 25 20:08:08 2015 UTC,"In terms of items, she's pretty flexible I think. Basically you can make the argument that Glimmer Cape is her only core item because the synergy between it and cold embrace is so ridiculously good, but apart from that she's a ""whatever the team needs"" type of support. Top picks:  Urn of Shadows: Can stack the heal with your embrace to make it even better, WW has great INT gain so the 50% mana regen goes a long way.  Blink: Turns her into a powerful initiator if necessary, makes landing arctic burn on all enemies during teamfights much easier, combined with her limited flight makes her a bitch to chase down.  Force staff: standard support item, crucial against a Clockwerk, Riki, etc.  Mek: decent carrier for it but not the best, since she isn't usually positioning herself in the middle of fights. Can farm it pretty quick with splinter blast though, especially by stacking neutrals.  Arcane Boots: She doesn't need them for herself if you manage her mana carefully earlygame but its a no brainer to grab them if you've got allies that need them (Sven, Tiny, etc).  Sheepstick: Still the ultimate lategame item for support heroes, WW is no different.  Pipe: See Mek. Buy as needed."
TrueDoTA2,3b1z0f,ItsDominare,2,Thu Jun 25 14:25:46 2015 UTC,"I'm going to write more about it in my post, later, but any synopsis of Wyvern itemization that doesn't include Soul Ring is incomplete. In my opinion, Soul Ring is the only absolutely core item on Wyvern."
TrueDoTA2,3b1z0f,freelance_fox,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:32:28 2015 UTC,"I've never felt the need to get one myself, but I'm pretty careful with my mana in general. I agree that it makes sense if you feel you need to be casting a lot of spells, but I don't agree that she can't operate effectively without one (which is what ""core"" means)."
TrueDoTA2,3b1z0f,Drop_,1 point,Fri Jun 26 05:40:59 2015 UTC,"People use the term interchangeably between ""literally"" core, and ""core."" The way I play her, Soul Ring is literally the single most core item, but I suppose you could say it's not always absolutely core. In that case, I can't say that any item is absolutely core on Wyvern. Not like BoTs on Tinker or Blink on Batrider."
TrueDoTA2,3b1z0f,wildtarget13,2,Fri Jun 26 17:10:07 2015 UTC,"I don't play her and don't know much any her, but I know she can be dominant as an aggressive support or defensive.  All of her skills are solid.    For example you can play her in an offlane duo role as a support, rushing soul ring and just dominate a melee carry by casting splinter on cd and using embrace to recover the up from soul ring cost.  Her ult, despite the nerf is still stupid strong.  Almost guarantees one dead hero and setup for other cc.  Forgot items:    Medallion synergizes well with her ult.  Glimmer synergizes stupid well with embrace. Soul Ring lets you spam shit in lane if you're going that direction.  Mek / GG are fine pickups for supports now I feel (as opposed to 6.80-6.83 where they were better core items) because supports tend to get more gold from kills which makes timings for these items pretty good. Pipe is also pretty good with embrace, but kind of like an expensive glimmer in practice. Urn / Blink / Tranquils / Force are all solid items as well.   Just a solid support hero."
TrueDoTA2,3b1z0f,likes-beans,2,Thu Jun 25 15:03:04 2015 UTC,"Wyvern is a really solid hero. She is strong, even when she is a hard support.   VP.Lil did a sick mid dive onto shadow fiend with level 1 artic burn. The early kill potential of artic burn is insane and it makes sense why wyvern has no damage to last hit with. If she did, she'd be a 1k range hero with sick auto attacks and a scaling magical debuff that does 40% of a hero's health, before magic resist.  I usually go tranquil+soul on the hero, You don't even need starting items on this hero. Branches for efficiency is the way to go. A clarity will help you get as many cold embraces as you need, but you really don't need it to survive the laning phase.   You have amazing counter push and sick teamfight. Not to mention the heal really bails allies out at 1k range and scales really well into the late game.   Force staff and blink are decent on her, as most heroes. But you can already cliff juke with artic burn. Solar crest is core for the single target pick offs. And wyvern can transition and contribute significant right clicks with artic burn up.  I mostly play her as a safelane support that zones or maybe stacks the jungle. I do get level six late on her if i roam, but roaming is super easy on this hero as she adds so much kill potential to the lane."
TrueDoTA2,3b0z69,goblinbiddin,6,Thu Jun 25 02:24:12 2015 UTC,"Drow as a 3.5 is ultra-greedy. Drow can catch-up on farm decently well thanks to her ult, but unless she occupies a significant amount of space she quickly becomes a liability. At the very least you'll need a play-making position 3 offlane hero who doesn't require a large amount of farm to do his thing... if anything, the comparison to WD illustrates how little Drow brings to the table compared to an actually strong support. Even if I'm a Huskar or a WR, I'd much, much rather have a greedy Aghs-rushing WD backing me up than an ultra-greedy Midas-Blink-nothing Drow. It's awfully close to being a running a quad-core line-up. Gust is good, but it's going to be sitting at lvl.1 for quite some time...  If you want to run Drow outside of safelane or mid farming positions, you're probably best off running duals in the true pub fashion, pairing her with someone who has strong kill potential (preferably someone who's mostly in it for the levels)."
TrueDoTA2,3b0z69,Harlequeens,1 point,Thu Jun 25 07:46:28 2015 UTC,"I've also run the offlane dual 3 position drow, but this is a thought experiment on if we can get the drow out of a core role, so that we won't have to worry so much about her tendency to get picked off, since we'd only be losing a 4 if that happened.  Midas supports actually don't take up much space, because the midas creates gold on the map, rather than just eating it up, and it also helps us get those levels, so that we can max out that gust and get level 2 and 3 ult quickly.  I did say this would be clowny! If we never try anything weird, we never find anything weird that works!"
TrueDoTA2,3b0z69,Harlequeens,1 point,Thu Jun 25 13:33:16 2015 UTC,"Sure. I'm not saying it can never work, just that it really shouldn't. There is a ""place"" in pubs for a lot of weird stuff—just the other day, for instance, my lane safelane support made a last-minute executive decision not to pick Rubick or whoever he had been hovering over in favor of none other than Spectre. Did we win? Yes. Was it a good, game-winning pick? God no. I'm sure he had fun, though. There's a certain charm in figuring out how to make an off-the-wall draft work, but it's still pretty patently sub-optimal. I suppose when I think of ""something weird that works"" I'm thinking of something like Vlad's Deso Drow, Bloodstone Lina, Silver Edge Panda, etc.  Anyway, accounting for Drow's weaknesses as a hero by (essentially) making her expendable is a questionable tact to take; I can't help but feel running Drow as a support vastly overvalues Precision Aura while at the same time not taking full, true advantage of it because, well, you need fast levels and farm for that. Position 4 Drow will necessarily be a mere accessory to her team's victory in most games rather than a pivotal, driving factor—that is the most significant difference between Drow and a true high-impact position 4 such as WD or AA."
TrueDoTA2,3b0z69,Spuuky,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:46:56 2015 UTC,"It's true that her impact won't be as high, and certainly not as obvious as a WD or AA, but she will have the advantage of transitioning into that 4th core if the game drags on (gyro support was run in the pros a while ago and did something similar to this)  Again, if we don't try crazy things, we never find crazy things that work!"
TrueDoTA2,3b0z69,ILike_Lamps,1 point,Thu Jun 25 19:42:02 2015 UTC,"Part of the enormous strength of WD and AA in a position 4 role is that they also can be powerful heroes with ""core farm"" and can also be valid 4th cores if needed. You certainly can't ignore Agh's Witch Doctor in a late-game fight any more than you can ignore ""4th core"" Drow.   Gyro as a support offers a great deal of damage from spells, including a big slow and a potentially long (unreliable) stun. And they mostly stopped doing it because it actually isn't very good relatively speaking. I think it's better than Drow with the same farm level though."
TrueDoTA2,3b0z69,LukasDG,1 point,Thu Jun 25 20:04:09 2015 UTC,"Well one of the issues with aghs WD is that if you interrupt his ult you can basically ignore him.  Again, drow aura is a big deal as well, as just staying alive, even on low farm, if we get our levels, is a big threat.  It's clowny, it's unorthodox, but it may at least be worth a second look."
TrueDoTA2,3b0z69,wildtarget13,5,Thu Jun 25 20:52:09 2015 UTC,"Very interesting, I'm going to have to try this."

TrueDoTA2,3b0z69,Drop_,6,Thu Jun 25 02:57:45 2015 UTC,The big weakness of drow as support is her attack animation. Even with fairly good stats and useful spells it makes it really hard to harass early on.
TrueDoTA2,3b0z69,drock_davis,10,Thu Jun 25 05:53:29 2015 UTC,"Animation doesn't change BAT or anything, just when the projectile lands. It's not like your trying to last hit, just get the animation out."
TrueDoTA2,3b0z69,Boony52,8,Thu Jun 25 07:48:35 2015 UTC,"Attack speed is one thing but attack duration and backswing time (combined they were known as animation in DotA 1 at least) is another.  Drow has 1.7s base attack time but a base attack duration of 0.7s and a backswing of 0.3s. In high level play you're always expected to cancel the backswing but that 0.7s attack duration is very important for harassing.  A low attack duration or quick animation allows you to harass and move back quickly before you get hit by creeps or heroes. It is also very important for chasing since the attack duration is how long you need to stop moving for every time you attack.  Witch doctor with a base attack duration of 0.4s compared to 0.7s is going to be able to take far less damage while harassing and is going to be able to chase much better.  Let's say you're chasing a hero down with an attack time of 1.7s and you're attacking whenever you can, drow can only run for 1.0/1.7 = 59% of the time while for witch doc it is 1.3/1.7 = 77% of the time. Very significant difference."
TrueDoTA2,3b0z69,Boony52,3,Thu Jun 25 13:00:40 2015 UTC,"The fact that her animation sucks is offset by the fact that you have an orb, so creep aggro and sticking and moving isn't as important.    Drow will ultimately take far less damage than WD, because despite his better animation, she won't aggro creeps when harassing."
TrueDoTA2,3b0z69,wildtarget13,1 point,Thu Jun 25 16:51:28 2015 UTC,"You don't have to worry about drawing creep aggro or backswing when zoning with drow with a tiny level of micro.  As long as you start the animation while they are in range it's fine.  Last hitting or getting kills is different, but zoning with drow is super easy and far less mana intensive than with other 'supports' than with drow and 1 point in frost."
TrueDoTA2,3b0z69,NerdrageLV,3,Mon Jun 29 20:20:05 2015 UTC,Hm... that has not been my experience. I've always found that with a level of frost arrows I have no trouble zoning with her.
TrueDoTA2,3b0z69,NerdrageLV,2,Thu Jun 25 05:58:47 2015 UTC,I like the idea.  Thoughts on a medallion? With the possibility of going to solar later.
TrueDoTA2,3b0z69,Lazarous86,3,Thu Jun 25 04:39:03 2015 UTC,"Solar is a great support item to put on the front liner so he can make some room for you in fights, I don't know if it has any particular synergy with drow, but if your team needs one and you can afford it, go nuts!"
TrueDoTA2,3b0z69,NerdrageLV,1 point,Thu Jun 25 05:14:54 2015 UTC,I was kinda thinking of the ganking potential. Gust then medallion and then let your carry go ham while you slow with frost arrows.
TrueDoTA2,3b0z69,NerdrageLV,1 point,Thu Jun 25 06:51:04 2015 UTC,"It's a good item. If you're playing a low farm priority role it's never a bad idea to use a lot of utility items that don't require you to be in the middle of fights. It's essentially giving some of your net worth as a debuff or as a buff to your ally.  It does rosh easy, something supports and teams like. And butterfly/halberd transitions.  The cool thing about it is you can do things like buy manta or lotus and then remove the negative shine on yourself.  I did super stupid euls+medallion on drow once to test it out against bots. It's hilarity and is a TP cancel. But Euls is not the item on drow."
TrueDoTA2,3b0z69,NerdrageLV,2,Thu Jun 25 07:34:48 2015 UTC,"Haha, yeah all that mana on euls does basically nothing for you. Solar crest is basically physical glimmercape. It's never going to be bad on a support."

TrueDoTA2,3b0z69,FreshExpress,1 point,Thu Jun 25 05:38:42 2015 UTC,I think the first time we try will probably be dark seer off lane and we'll put a dazzle as a hard 5.  I am thinking maybe a mid viper and a qop in the 1 spot.
TrueDoTA2,3b0z69,JilaX,1 point,Thu Jun 25 10:06:14 2015 UTC,wind runner and drow have a ton of synergy.  She can play the Carry or Mid.
TrueDoTA2,3b0z69,JilaX,1 point,Thu Jun 25 12:51:42 2015 UTC,Oooh.... Vacgust? ouch. That could definitely hurt.
TrueDoTA2,3b0z69,TheOverlordCrono,1 point,Thu Jun 25 13:41:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah, vacgust with ion shell on qop blinking in with her scream.  While dazzle weaves, heals, or graves someone.  Might swap viper mid for warlock mid."
TrueDoTA2,3b0z69,Spuuky,1 point,Thu Jun 25 16:09:59 2015 UTC,Ohh... corelock... still viper's really good.
TrueDoTA2,3b0z69,RampagingRagE,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:00:51 2015 UTC,Yeah but i think lock would synergize a little better.
TrueDoTA2,3b0z69,Drop_,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:00:07 2015 UTC,"Maybe, but i think drow teams have a general lack of tankiness that viper helps address."
TrueDoTA2,3b0z69,Drop_,1 point,Thu Jun 25 19:44:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah, thats one of the reasons I put the dazzle in.  You would definitely have to win fast with that lineup."
TrueDoTA2,3b0z69,Drop_,2,Fri Jun 26 03:47:11 2015 UTC,"I think viper is great at winning fast tho. Still, i'm a fan of the corelock."
TrueDoTA2,3b0z69,Drop_,2,Fri Jun 26 04:14:50 2015 UTC,"I feel like I've done this in pubs.  My two cents as a support player.  If your carry can 1 v 1 or if by chance you feel like you can play greedy, you can ancients or cliff jungle her. It's safer to do cliff jungle with a quelling blade since you can always walk mid or top if the enemy is too far away from their tower and provide forst arrows when you're level two, something you should have after the first medium camp if not one more creep away from it.   She probably will turn into a blink force support. You will be the blink gust support. Follow up could be an ethereal blade for the AGI and the ability to Ethereal (essentially a disarm and magic amp) an enemy carry and the most agi you can buy. Ghost scepter is also really good.  As good as tranquils are, drow is a right click hero and will likely try ot contribute her slow in fights.  Phase boots would be the preferred option here over treads. Or brown boots into travels rush. A fast Travels+ghost scepter can make drow unkillable with gust levels. Level 1 gust could honestly do it depending on cast animations. A quick gust on the heroes that wan to cancel your TP and a ghost scepter TP.   It honestly sounds decent, but you have very little kill potential as supports can cast nukes that will make any manfight with you their duel victory before drow has her level 6.  She also probably would want to start boots just to have the potential to orb walk versus boots first offlaners who know they might be against a drow in lane, carry or not.  I think midas is ok, but it might be too greedy. Staying alive with blink or HP items gives you more levels and gold reliably compared to midas, especially on an easy target like support drow.  As for the lost regen from no tranquil boots, bottle could be the answer and can make manfights really good.  All of this becomes a problem when you start thinking how much burden do you want to put on the hard 5 support. Drow doesn't have to buy courier, but at this point she's close to a mirana roaming that buys boots bottle before really WANTING to buy flying courier/wards. A smoke or detection isn't out of the question before boots+bottle."
TrueDoTA2,3b0z69,punriffer5,1 point,Thu Jun 25 07:46:34 2015 UTC,"I feel like this type of play would try to make her play like a core, rather than embracing the 4 role. It's true that i'm advocating a midas build, but this is because I want to maximize her XP and gold while avoiding sucking up a lot of space on the map.  it's true that she's gonna be a greedy support, but unlike most greedy supports, she's actually quite good in lane, and can zone out and TP countergank well while also providing a big boost to your ranged mid's lane.  She's not going to be able to kill people 1v1 from this role, but very few supports can. Don't compare her to core drow, compare her to other supports."
TrueDoTA2,3b0z69,punriffer5,1 point,Thu Jun 25 13:41:08 2015 UTC,Nice write up i'm gonna get flamed so hard when i do this.

I've had the aura help out so much that I've knocked myself down from a 2 to let the allied Lesh carry harder.  I saw it viable as long as I stayed behind the frontliners.  I will read your post now though, just the title and my experiences with a non-piority drow makes me love this idea."
TrueDoTA2,3b0z69,calky,1 point,Thu Jun 25 06:26:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the aura is super good even with just your ult and base stats, but cores don't want to be hiding in the back, while supports can and should often be doing that. Seems like a good fit if we can find ways to contribute, and i think i've outlined some decent ways to do that."
TrueDoTA2,3b2k5x,vgfangay,3,Thu Jun 25 13:28:46 2015 UTC,The buff doesn't self stack our stack on enemies.  Most buffs don't unless specifically noted.  Just test by blood raging your self then casting again before the cd.
TrueDoTA2,3b2k5x,Drop_,2,Thu Jun 25 14:56:46 2015 UTC,So no stacks then(I know self cast double stack is never possible) Echo spells are considered as different caster which is why I wonder if stacking could happen. Guess the game still doesn't allow it.
TrueDoTA2,3b2k5x,Drop_,3,Sat Jun 27 17:28:32 2015 UTC,"Most things don't stack.  For example, if you have two rod of atos' on a team and both use it on one enemy it isn't double effect, the 2nd use just overwrites the first.    Same for things like veil, glimmer, medallion, solar etc. (though medallion will stack with solar, 2x solars wont stack)."
TrueDoTA2,3b0jkl,Sivcere,8,Thu Jun 25 00:12:13 2015 UTC,"Keep her the fuck away from viper, but she can be just fine, I think. She gets work done early in the game, is a great pickoff artist that doesn't fall off too hard going into the late game. (her damage stays up and she's got decent str gain and refraction)  I think she can be a decent choice if you're looking for an early game ish hero as your safelane farmer, and you have enough tank coming from your other cores.  She also seems like a decent way to sneak an enigma into your lineup without getting punished super hard by aggro tris (because you're hiding your big mid game damage dealer in the mid lane.)  Consider lineups like Viper/Tide/TA + 2 (viper safe, TA mid, Tide off, supports can honestly go wherever they like). Also, you could try to run something like Lesh/TA/clock/enigma/bh (BH hard support, the ""5 core"" lineup, where everyone eventually gets pretty rich, thanks to track)  With that being said, she does seem like a more counterable version of shadowfiend for these purposes (although keep him the hell away from viper as well). Basically, tho, if you're TA is better than your SF, she does a lot of the same things well as he does (decent laner, natural mid solo, takes attack damage well, and so doesn't fall off too hard late, freeing up your safelane for a different sort of hero)"
TrueDoTA2,3b0jkl,goblinbiddin,2,Thu Jun 25 00:22:54 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I think you should keep just about any hero away from a viper. The bastard is ridiculously hard to kill 1v1 for everyone except maybe a pudge and even the pudge gets nothing done for 6 levels and is easily countered by a ward on his side of the river to prevent hooks.  Everyone else needs a lot of help from the sidelanes to make anything happen."
TrueDoTA2,3b0jkl,brinebold,4,Thu Jun 25 02:14:21 2015 UTC,I hear brood is fairly strong in a lane with viper but I haven't had the chance to test it.
TrueDoTA2,3b0jkl,brinebold,2,Thu Jun 25 02:15:54 2015 UTC,"It's the only time you're likely to see 2 carries fighting ward wars :) .  If viper keeps the place warded up tight, he should still probably win that matchup because brood can't handle harass. As viper in that case, I'd actually pick up a set of phase boots and a vlads if it makes sense with the team comp or phase and a hotd if more tank makes sense but some. As long as you don't get surrounded and trapped by spiders or just harassed too much by them, they shouldn't be able to do much to you in spite of your inability to clear them quickly."
TrueDoTA2,3b0jkl,twersx,1 point,Thu Jun 25 03:27:36 2015 UTC,"Brood should beat everyone 1v1 in lane except heroes like axe who she can't ever attack.  Even good nukers will struggle vs brood 1v1, and when brood doesn't have to worry about backstabbing supports dropping sentries she can be super aggressive."

Yeah, I play nearly exclusively ranked CM and i consider viper to be unpassable 3rd. Giving him away in the 4th slot is one of the easiest ways to lose a game at the picking screen."
TrueDoTA2,3b0jkl,brinebold,1 point,Thu Jun 25 02:22:47 2015 UTC,"Once he gets dismember, it's a different story though. But then again, both of you should probably start running around the map accomplishing other stuff around that time too."

TrueDoTA2,3b0jkl,brinebold,1 point,Thu Jun 25 03:22:43 2015 UTC,"That's a pudge who doesn't realize his job in that lane is to block creeps, leech XP, try desperately not to die, and grab some runes if he can. In my MMR, most of them seem to realize they can't try to last hit unless they happen to have bottle charges to heal with and even then they only get 1-2 per bottle if they do it in the right lane position."
TrueDoTA2,3b0jkl,erbsenbrei,1 point,Thu Jun 25 03:45:07 2015 UTC,"Well, yesterday I was forced mid and I'm a horrible carry/mid player.  Razor absolutely destroyed me.  May not want Razor to stay away from Viper. Or maybe I'm plainly that horrible. Who knows ;)"
TrueDoTA2,3b0jkl,brinebold,1 point,Thu Jun 25 13:49:14 2015 UTC,"Did you level up corrosive skin to 2 or 3 during lane, use plenty of regen to stay near full health, and dive straight at him when you saw him plasma field (unless you could get out of range)? If so, he legitimately won that matchup, either by out last-hitting you or just being a good counter. If you let him get those near-max range plasma fields off and didn't work on your magic resist, it's probably just a case of not knowing the heroes in that matchup well enough to counter his plays.  I don't think that's a matchup viper can win like he usually does but I don't think he should get stomped in it either. It's similar to a viper vs QoP lane. Neither one can really kill the other, or even keep them from farming, unless someone makes a mistake or a support comes in to help."
TrueDoTA2,3b0jkl,erbsenbrei,1 point,Thu Jun 25 15:41:30 2015 UTC,"Well, Static Link. Sucked me dry. Didn't/Couldn't really kill me but sapped me dry and dominated the lane.  It's like being SF against a Bane that enfeebles you early game.  Still, bear in mind that I'm a truly bad carry/mid. I opt for Pos. 4/5 unless I'm practically forced to do otherwise ;)"

TrueDoTA2,3b0jkl,sintoras2,1 point,Thu Jun 25 21:05:49 2015 UTC,Its good in pubs especially radiant since stacking ancients should allow you to get good deso blink timing. Not that great in comp though since there are better midlaners and teams will block ancients.
TrueDoTA2,3b0jkl,likes-beans,1 point,Thu Jun 25 10:39:15 2015 UTC,"IMO she is bad this patch with all the urns and QOP's; urn her, dagger her, and burst her down before she can do any damage.  Also i hate playing her in pubs: people just repick alch cm timber and im screwed :("
TrueDoTA2,3azg74,Thalnagath,18,Wed Jun 24 19:07:58 2015 UTC,"I think it's mainly because MoM allows u to clear stacks very early, whereas armlet offers nothing in that regard."
TrueDoTA2,3azg74,TheBigBallsOfFury,4,Wed Jun 24 19:13:21 2015 UTC,"That makes sense.  Even so, it seems like in many cases the Sven ends up being unable to contribute meaningfully in fights with a MoM until he has the BKB, unless he/his team are already well ahead of the other guys.  Do you think it would be worth it to sacrifice stack-farming efficiency in favor of an Armlet build that focuses on being a teamfight presence even before the BKB?"
TrueDoTA2,3azg74,killemdeader,5,Wed Jun 24 19:27:40 2015 UTC,"No. Armlet is a bad item this patch overall, and Sven is a fast farmer who runs into slot problems relatively quickly. Blink, MoM, BKB are all extremely good on him. If you want to build armlet, the best way to do so is to go HotD -> disassemble -> armlet, but I think it's worse than getting a crystalys, which gives comparable damage in the midgame and scales better."
TrueDoTA2,3azg74,killemdeader,4,Thu Jun 25 00:53:19 2015 UTC,How is Armlet a bad item in this patch?  It got buffed again and is quite possibly the most cost-efficient item in the entire game for a right-clicking Strength hero.  Sven's cost efficiency with the item is nothing short of obscene.
TrueDoTA2,3azg74,twersx,7,Thu Jun 25 00:58:39 2015 UTC,"Yes, the item is cost efficient in a vacuum but it doesn't sure up any of Sven's weaknesses, and doesn't complement his strengths either; it just makes him hit harder (which he already does). His biggest issues are getting kited and getting disabled, and armlet only makes him more vulnerable to disables and does nothing to keep him from getting kited.   Also, about armlet in general this patch; it's not so much that armlet is weak, it's just not as good as equivalent items this patch. Armlet toggling is as bad as it has been since it got nerfed. Drums is cheaper and has similar benefits. Also, it just ""feels"" bad, I'm not 100% sure i can describe exactly what it is about the item but every time i buy it on a hero that isn't huskar I always end up wishing it was something else that did more for me."
TrueDoTA2,3azg74,killemdeader,1 point,Thu Jun 25 01:55:12 2015 UTC,Even on naix? Seems like he still benefits from the item.
TrueDoTA2,3azg74,killemdeader,1 point,Sat Jun 27 17:10:10 2015 UTC,It might still be alright on naix but the hero is so ignored this patch I doubt anyone has figured out the optimal build. Personally I haven't played the hero once in 6.84.
TrueDoTA2,3azg74,killemdeader,1 point,Sat Jun 27 19:02:46 2015 UTC,"Also, it just ""feels"" bad, I'm not 100% sure i can describe exactly what it is about the item but every time i buy it on a hero that isn't huskar I always end up wishing it was something else that did more for me.   Exact opposite for me.  Armlet toggling got nerfed but it's still OP as hell unless they've stacked tons of dots on you.  It gives a huge boost to armor, health, damage, attack speed, and regen for very little cost, in a single slot.  I will pretty much never skip Armlet on a right-click STR hero, it's way too strong for the cost.  I don't really see MoM as helping Sven with being kited.  If movespeed was all that's necessary, why would you buy blink dagger?  And MoM is incredibly risky to use without BKB protecting it, which means MoM is essentially just a farming item until you can pair it with a BKB.  I don't feel like Sven is a particularly good choice for a hero that's going to afk farm for the first 20 mins of the game, though.  There are several heroes that will rapidly outfarm him in the same context (Anti-Mage has been a recent, popular pick after people realized how OP Mana Void is now), or will do more with the same amount of farm than him.  I feel like if you're going to pick Sven, you need to use him for very early, aggressive play with War Cry's fucking insane armor bonus (seriously, 20 armor to creeps?  It's ridiculous) and just force fights, and I'm not convinced MoM is ideal for that because of the huge drawback to using it.   Armlet has almost no drawback to using it unless you just leave it on the entire time, even when not actively hitting something (or leaving it on when you don't need that extra damage against whatever you're hitting) and that's kind of a L2P issue more than anything else I feel.  I think we're kind of seeing the issue with MoM Sven in recent games.  When he works, Sven works quite well, but MoM basically means Sven is going to be a non-factor in fights until he uses that MoM to farm up his BKB.  And even once he has MoM+BKB+blink, he's easy to deal with because by time he farms up that, enemy supports have glimmer capes (extremely OP item that needs to honestly just lose the invis or something, or have its cost increased by like 50%), force staff, etc to deal with him.  Granted, Armlet may not be the solution to this, either.  I feel like the solution might just be running Sven as a secondary damage source for another hero.  Like Sven goes in and hits things, but primarily is focused on being really hard to kill and really hard to ignore while someone else is doing all the real damage.  Kind of like how you'd use a Wraith King or Dragon Knight?"
TrueDoTA2,3azg74,JilaX,2,Thu Jun 25 05:11:48 2015 UTC,"The problem with armlet is the same reason items like early bkb and early blink have fallen off on heroes/lineups that don't absolutely have to have them; they corner you into forcing fights to be worthwile, and have a difficult buildup. Pretty much every carry these days build one of Drums or S&Y, which are safer bets and have really nice buildups."
TrueDoTA2,3azg74,Jackolope,1 point,Fri Jun 26 01:51:31 2015 UTC,"It's funny because not a month ago people were literally saying Drums was bad and too expensive to warrant building and that it was a ""dead end"" item because it didn't build into anything.  SnY used to be vilified, but has generally been accepted as a pretty decent item for a year or two I think."
TrueDoTA2,3azg74,dpekkle,2,Fri Jun 26 01:54:04 2015 UTC,"The patch drastically changed drums' viability though. Last patch as the position 1 the game would ALWAYS go late and even when you were behind you would get a ton of comeback gold, so building any items that you'd have to sell when you were 6 slotted was really dumb. This patch, early game fighting is encouraged and most afk ricing builds are asking to lose the game, so you want to build so that you are versatile and can contribute when necessary, but farm if you get the space.  Edit: the charge change was significant too, the attack speed buff in early game fights is more noticable."
TrueDoTA2,3azg74,AuroraAdventus,0,Fri Jun 26 01:57:11 2015 UTC,"I disagree.  I think taking the game at 35 mins was just as viable in 6.83 as it is now, it's just that people don't often experiment heavily outside the meta and the meta focused on afking until you had buyback x5 + aegis + pickoffs before approaching high ground... TI3 style Chinese play, basically.  I agree the meta has made Drums more viable, but I think they're as strong now as they were in 6.83.  They've always been a very slot-efficient item that gives a good spread of stats and a really useful aura that makes taking early objectives and fights much easier."
TrueDoTA2,3azg74,draanexle,4,Fri Jun 26 02:01:23 2015 UTC,"Probably not, unless you're against a lineup that are going to be deathballing you hard from like ~20 mins and you have to fight for your life.   If not the improved farm towards the BKB/Daedelus makes the MoM worth it."
TrueDoTA2,3azg74,AuroraAdventus,2,Thu Jun 25 00:59:05 2015 UTC,"You could always make hotd, attack camps by yourself,  disassemble into both."
TrueDoTA2,3azg74,draanexle,1 point,Wed Jun 24 22:09:37 2015 UTC,"That's how I've been running my sven lately, going something like 1-4-1 or 2-3-1 then hitting the jungle with treads and hotd into mom and armlet."
TrueDoTA2,3azg74,wildtarget13,0,Fri Jun 26 04:46:25 2015 UTC,"but sven has a built in cleave ._.  if you were the hard carry, having/saving points for cleave is great for camp clearing. especially if you know there are stacks"
TrueDoTA2,3azg74,killemdeader,10,Wed Jun 24 19:21:49 2015 UTC,"Yes, but you want the MoM for the lifesteal too.  Also, it's amazing for pushing towers."
TrueDoTA2,3azg74,wildtarget13,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:37:44 2015 UTC,"yeah i agree with the need for MoM or HoD for sure, just saying that the advantage of MoM over armlet isnt that clear in terms of clearing jungle stacks. just a simple armlet + morbid is more than enough to clear huge waves. just MoM without ulti won't let you clear the largest stacks"
TrueDoTA2,3azg74,AuroraAdventus,2,Thu Jun 25 12:47:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but the price difference between MoM and Armlet + morbid mask is about 1850 which is a lot early game."
TrueDoTA2,3azg74,wildtarget13,-1,Thu Jun 25 14:43:54 2015 UTC,Most players value the Nuke damage of stun and the huge armor increase of war cry before even picking up cleave.   Cleave is more if your losing and need to clear camps just to find farm because the lane is too hard or if you have a black hole or something.   Most svens would rather throw out as many stuns and have team fight armor than cleave.  Just too at how most early game fights Pop up before 10 minutes. Cleave isn't helping there at all.
TrueDoTA2,3azg74,AuroraAdventus,2,Wed Jun 24 20:31:25 2015 UTC,"Depends on how you play, going 1-0-2 into 1-4-2 lets you accelerate your farm extremely quickly on Sven, playing similarly to carries like slark or AM where you can farm huge stacks early on and clear the jungle between creep waves. Especially if you use God's strength to farm. All you get out of maxing stun is damage and armor out of war cry (and the armor doesn't scale well early past 2 points, 10 armor is plenty). Cleave is also especially good vs melee offlaners since you can cleave them in lane."
TrueDoTA2,3azg74,wildtarget13,1 point,Thu Jun 25 00:48:46 2015 UTC,"If you're picking Sven, you'd probably be stuck in a counter situation if you want him to farm like an antimage and have stun at one. Heroes like slark and clinkz are by nature shadow blade assassin heroes and are not weak if they have to afk jungle, especially in the enemy jungle. Tiny and medusa are examples of heroes that go both ways and can go early or late game oriented items. Tiny blink rush and drum, manta medusa.   All heroes can go both ways, but each hero has a value of each. Sven's cleave farming is really good, but he's so much more naturally a viable blink dagger initiator than every carry I've mentioned.   The armor actually scales really well and is not a 1 or even 2 point wonder. Each point gives 4 armor.   Not maxing the stun is very dubious. AOE nuke damage is rarely not maxed early on. It's reliable ranged damage and early game, if you're farm in oriented like you are describing, you will be a 100% non factor as you are easily kited. Kills that would be possible for Sven+1 are secured early game with a 325 nuke, not cleave. In fact you'll miss almost every kill with one level of stun.   The examples of heroes that don't max their nuke are far and few between. The only heroes I can think of that I would not max the static nuke damage are: medusa, most people still max mystic snake; wraith king, rarely a carry, and both core/support usually max stun to have an impact early, and spirit breaker, who can leave bash scaling nuke 50-200 damage.   If heroes have a strong early game nuke, skipping it with the intention of farming instead is the alternative, not the default for any draft. If you're countered or pressured to the point of dodging fights and trying to catch up.   Lastly.. Do I even have to ask why cleave for harass is ridiculous? It pushes the wave and not maxing the nuke and armor leaves you unable to kill. Max stun damage is what threatens a kill. Early cleave points push the wave and will tell any offlaner that they have the lane equilibrium and no threat of dying to stun. If you think ""my support will max their nuke and secure the kill"" then the kill was really available without Sven at all. Early nuke levels is not ignorable."
TrueDoTA2,3azg74,Skyro620,2,Thu Jun 25 02:49:32 2015 UTC,"yeah, i agree that the build is an alternative one.  here's a good example of an alternative: had pretty much a solo lane versus a broodmother. can't do much about the q spam on me, but whenever the spiderlings come for harass, since i went 1-4-1 in the early game, i had enough damage to farm off the spiderlings. when they are clumped up into a huge group, one stun into cleaved attack gets rid of them all. just grab a mask from the side shop and then go whatever item build is relevant.  the difference between maxing stun and cleave? pretty much on not losing the lane too hard. and giving you a very viable way to run into the jungle during offtimes to clean up some camps"
TrueDoTA2,3azg74,RampagingRagE,2,Thu Jun 25 12:54:42 2015 UTC,"that's more udnerstandable.   But The first thing that comes to mind is spider hitpoints: 450. And early game is when you want the cleave to fight spiders. lets say you max it and are 1-2 at level 3. You then have 20/35/50 cleave. Let's say you hit for 100 when you're around level 5 without ulti and brood is the same level with 4 spiders every time she spawns from her nuke.  Let's say there are a group of 8 spiders. For the third point in cleave, you're dealing 50*7 plus 100 from the main attack. Whereas you're doing 250 from the stun in an AOE if you have 3 points of stun instead.   Also, sven won't die to brood as long as he gets a poorman's shield. Probably won't even die if he skips cleave entirely. Maxing it over stun is still a lot less useful. Not to mention you can kill the hero brood with stun and not with cleave. 3-2-0 probably would be my first thought build at versus brood."
TrueDoTA2,3azg74,lolfail9001,1 point,Thu Jun 25 20:07:00 2015 UTC,"thats a good point. certainly lacking the drastic kill potential that comes, especially when you hit 6.   the issue with the stuns was that i really wanted to conserve the mana for emergencies. you stun once, and you're kinda manaless for the longest time. you have to ferry over some clarities/mangoes.   i did a 1,3,1 sorta build because i got treads and went straight for MoM for that sustain. you can stop brood from taking over the lane completely (so long as your allies dont come in to feed the spider).  its not the best situation for a lane, granted. but if you consider him now, for all intensive purposes, a farming offlaner, then it goes fairly well. brood doesnt take objectives too fast, and you build up eventual farming items.  its not the best scenario for sure. hehe, just a personal anecdote. i think i agree with maxing the stun in general cases."

I also prefer Blink over SB if you already have an initiator on your team.

It gives no mobility, it gives shitty DPS increase for the cost and a hero with +20 armor buff does not suffer from lack of physical EHP like ever. Getting MoM+Armlet+Blink for the cost of cuirass (hotd is built, remember?) is like miles better."
TrueDoTA2,3azg74,Now_you_fucked_up,1 point,Fri Jun 26 15:55:18 2015 UTC,"I think it's better to push undefended T1s early than try to push lane > farm jungle. Warcry lets your creep wave tank more tower hits to burn down towers. The controlled creep also helps push towers but of course that's counterbalanced by the lower DPS on tower from no MoM active.  SB is situationally good on Sven but he's so mana starved as is. You're basically forced to go back to fountain after every teamfight unless you have outside sources of mana regen. Can be upgraded to SE though if you need the break. But it's a viable blink alternative if you have another initiator on your team and you feel you need the extra damage.  That's kind of thing with all this talk about Sven item builds, sometimes you need the damage and sometimes you don't, depends on the enemy team's tankiness, your team's lockdown, etc., but the mid-game power of MoM + Armlet results in a pretty big and cost efficient power/DPS spike."
TrueDoTA2,3azg74,goblinbiddin,7,Fri Jun 26 17:17:56 2015 UTC,"Sven needs Movespeed, Lifesteal, BKB, Attack Speed, and Crit. Armlet only minorly solves one of those issues. Armlet makes him pretty good at hitting people, but Sven's issue isn't that he isn't good enough at hitting people, it's that he can't hit anyone.  Getting an item that doesn't either radically change his damage output or partially solve kiting issues is just not acceptable."
TrueDoTA2,3azg74,SkunkyFatBowl,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:43:48 2015 UTC,"I don't feel like MoM does a very good job of that, though.  That's why they get blink dagger, because even with MoM they'll just walk away from you.  And even if movespeed was the solution, wouldn't they just get SnY instead?  Good mix of stats, IAS, move speed, plus the maim, and the movespeed boost stacks with War Cry's boost."
TrueDoTA2,3azg74,goblinbiddin,4,Wed Jun 24 21:11:56 2015 UTC,"You get Blink Dagger in addition to MoM. MoM is good because it is AS, movespeed, and Lifesteal all for only 2k gold. SnY is  Movespeed for 4k gold.   No item besides MoM can take care of his Lifesteal, bit of mobility, and a lot of AS for only 2k gold, which is important given that he has so many holes he needs items to fill."
TrueDoTA2,3azg74,SkunkyFatBowl,-1,Thu Jun 25 00:16:06 2015 UTC,"I disagree that he needs lifesteal, otherwise Satanic would be the item we'd see on him, and/or someone on his team would pick up Vlad's."
TrueDoTA2,3azg74,catcher6250,3,Thu Jun 25 00:36:57 2015 UTC,"That's a silly conclusion to come to.   MoM gives Lifesteal early on to boost farming and allow jungling. Satanic is a good 6th item on Sven after you get AS from other places though. Also, if Sven for some reason decided that he wasn't getting Lifesteal one game, it would not at all surprise me to see a Vlads on a support.   Sven needs AS, Lifesteal, Mobility, BKB, and a damage multiplier like Crit as early as possible. Treads MoM Blink BKB and then Crit is the fastest and most efficient way to fill those holes. Satanic is a 6k gold item. You don't go a 6k gold item when you don't even have BKB yet."
TrueDoTA2,3azg74,Drop_,1 point,Thu Jun 25 14:30:57 2015 UTC,"Sure, but you'd go Helm of the Dominator early on, same as Gyro, Luna, and other heroes that typically build Satanic in the late game."

Sven can do work at 60 minutes, but not at the cost of sacrificing his first 30. Sven needs AS, Mobility, Lifesteal, and BKB as soon as possible. Dropping 2k on Lifesteal that could instead be 2k on Lifesteal and AS is not a strong play.  I tried going HotD again on Sven, it's just worse than MoM. Any game I go MoM over HotD, I know it has gotten me more gold through farming and teamfighting than that I lose by selling it and rebuying a Mask for Satanic.   Sven does most of his work During Ulti with BKB popped. MoM's cooldown based huge surge of power synergizes extremely well with the cooldown based scaling of Sven."
TrueDoTA2,3azg74,lolfail9001,5,Thu Jun 25 19:31:08 2015 UTC,"I'd say most of the reason the pros are ignoring armlet sven is that the pros are for the most part ignoring sven.  However when he is picked up, he wants to farm very fast, more than he wants to fight right away, the MoM is first because you usually finish the blink just a few minutes after the MoM (just due to the speed at which you farm, even with just 1 point in cleave and, say, treads) and if you do want to fight early, blink storm bolt is gonna be what you want.  The armlet build looks good in theory, but it's a power peak that sees the sven drop off pretty hard compared to MoM builds due to the fact that MoM is such a good farming tool.  If you want to go for that early power peak to get work done early, blink -> bkb seems like a much better progression, as being able to get through lockdown and keep hacking away seems much better at that point than extra damage (sven with ult up will already be doing a ton of that)"

TrueDoTA2,3axbqw,FabulousMrFox,10,Wed Jun 24 06:39:26 2015 UTC,I think in general she's really weak now.  Silver edge is too easy to make and forces her into bad situations and non rush before she has any real damage.    I think treads Aquila basher bkb is generally a decent build now though.  Maybe you can get a manta instead of bkb but higher risk I think.  Playing her without dispel just seems impossible.
TrueDoTA2,3axbqw,Drop_,4,Wed Jun 24 14:35:54 2015 UTC,"Really? I think she got buffed if anything. Mid game fighting is stronger now, and evasion can't be disabled with Hex. That means anyone who wants to right click needs to build an MKB.  And if they build a Silver Edge, you build a BKB. Which you should be doing anyway as PA.   Although I think Manta might purge the debuff too. So you could even skip the BKB if they're low on disables/nukes."
TrueDoTA2,3axbqw,cerealkillr,2,Wed Jun 24 18:16:28 2015 UTC,"The thing is, she is a funny hero.  If you look at the pros that played her successfully, they did it by farming - getting an early-ish battlefury and using that + treads + hotd to play a little like AM, but able to fight before 6 slots.   PA is a hero that should be building BKB, but you generally don't want to build a BKB super early.  If you do that, by the time you get to midgame you'll be down to 5 second duration which is a pretty big deal.  Unless you're able to finish the game with an early bkb is going to be a huge risk.  Typically the safe way is to make it your 3rd major item, imo.    And while hex doesn't counter her so hard anymore, silver counters her and counters her with an easier buildup that is possible to utilize on more heroes.    Also she's pretty countered by Bloodseeker.  And he is ridiculously popular right now."
TrueDoTA2,3axbqw,Drop_,2,Wed Jun 24 18:42:13 2015 UTC,"Also she's pretty countered by Bloodseeker. And he is ridiculously popular right now.   Just out of curiosity, checked on dotabuff...

PA, as a hero, already went BKB pretty much every game 2nd or 3rd item. SE is stopped by BKB.  Even further, PA is a hero who doesn't really mind going Manta and that purges SE as well. 1 of those items is cheaper than SE and the other offers unlimited uses against SE. and is still cheaper than SE. SE really hasn't affected PA all that much and it is honesty better to go MKB against PA over SE since MKB goes through BKB.  SE has done one thing against PA and it's that it has made the Slark v PA match up more even. Previously, it was heavily PA favored since Slark never wants to go MKB.  Ignoring that, she was quite weak last patch as well, and the patch before that and the one before that. PA has never been really strong. She has went through a few phases of popularity in competitive but it was only ever EE and RTZ that picked her and in pubs there was never a time where she was beyond OP, unless you count the event time where everyone cried that she was OP despite everyone of those posts of her being OP disappeared after the event."
TrueDoTA2,3axbqw,somethingToDoWithMe,1 point,Sat Jun 27 00:47:38 2015 UTC,"She was good in 6.81 not op but solid(the arcana patch).  Iirc .82 came pretty soon after the event.  The nerf to coup de gras was unneeded and she didn't work well in 6.82 or 3 because everyone was guaranteed an mkb or scythe.  Now she's still weaker than most carries.  Silver is really good against her because it's good on more heroes  than mkb, it has more uses for initiation or escape, or can just be popped mid fight for the debuff. Another big factor is that it eliminates her ability to fight by killing her offense AND defense.  It's quite good against her because it's just generally a good item and she is more vulnerable to it than most other heroes.  Manta is not a typical PA item.  Not in the older bfury build, the phase into hotd into bkb and basher build or the minus armor build.  This is normally since she focuses more on raw damage than ago, and the big ago items on her are situational at best.  It's one of the lesser picked up items on PA in fact.  If there was no silver this patch she would be ok, maybe not to 6.81 despite the hex change but she would be much better than 6.82 or 3.  It's just one more thing to counter, though."
TrueDoTA2,3axbqw,Drop_,2,Wed Jun 24 22:16:52 2015 UTC,"Manta is honestly a situational, can be core, item. There was a period of time during Summit 1 where RTZ and EE were both talking about how Manta is the best item on PA. I don't know about 'best' but it is quite good on her. Gives her some stats and increases her split push potential, beefs her up a bit and increases attack speed and move speed which are both things quite underrated on her. I almost forgot the best reason for Manta; dispelling and manta dodging.  Regardless on whether it is the best item on her, which is irrelevant, it is good on her and it purges SE. Check out RTZ's dotabuff. Eternal envy goes Manta a lot more often than RTZ, granted he doesn't play PA much anymore. Having both BKB and Manta means SE is worthless. And PA doesn't even need to build in bad way to counter an item that costs 5.5k.   I honestly believe SE does very little against PA. She is bad for other reasons and they are reasons that have stuck with her pretty much forever. She needs something more reliable than her W to get crits out."
TrueDoTA2,3axbqw,somethingToDoWithMe,1 point,Wed Jun 24 23:19:07 2015 UTC,"Manta and BKB is 2 primarly defensive items.  They don't give enough for the cost of them in terms of what PA leverages best.   I get that EE builds manta a lot in pubs, but in all time for PA even in pro games it's only picked up like 9% of the time.    I don't think move speed is that essential on her when she has her low cooldown blink chase skill and low cooldown enemy slow.  It's nice on every hero, but of all the heroes that need it she primarily uses it to farm since she can't blind blink.    Going with a build to counter Silver pickups you end up with treads, bkb, and manta.  And that really isn't enough damage to make PA a particularly threatening hero imo.    You might be right, Silver Edge might not matter.  But fact is most people don't build manta, and manta + bkb builds are going to be lacking in damage for her.    I will admit, though, that manta has really high win rate for pubs on her.  Maybe it's worth re-evaluating builds on her entirely, getting away from typical item rushes and going for Treads -> Aquila -> Yasha -> ??, maybe a bracer to come online earlier.   Still, she is fucked by bloodseeker and he is in like every game lately."

In regards to playing pa, I find myself still going for phase boots but buying a medallion of courage straight after boots so I can get awesome levels of crit at for such a cheap payout.

TrueDoTA2,3axbqw,itaShadd,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:00:08 2015 UTC,"Don't think it's viable. You need some kind of lifesteal for sustain, and you need cheap stats to be able to fight people. You also need a bkb most of the time. 1800 for talisman of evasion is way too expensive at first, you will still die to nukes with no bkb/low hp pool.  I think that Solar Crest can be an interesting option later on though. If you are facing a team with several cores that don't really want an mkb (like an AM) it seems worth upgrading the medallion  As for Roshan, pa with medallion + lifesteal can easily take it, I don't think paying 1800 gold to do it faster is worth"
TrueDoTA2,3axbqw,itaShadd,3,Wed Jun 24 11:50:31 2015 UTC,"Don't think it's viable. You need some kind of lifesteal for sustain, and you need cheap stats to be able to fight people.   When we talk about using Drum we also assume at least a morbid mask, so why are we not assuming that for Medallion as well? Medallion is even cheaper, so you are about 500g closer to anything else you want to get.  You could have Morbid, Medallion and Bracer instead of Morbid and Drum, so the question is: what's more valuable to have? The difference between Bracer and Drum is 3 STR, 6 AGI/INT, the mediocre aura and the good active. If we get Medallion instead of Drum we get Mana regen, a whopping 7 armour and the possibility to forgo it for a -7 armour on an enemy, which is pretty sweet for PA especially when most enemies have rather low armour and it's likely to go below 0 - in terms of DPS Medallion gives you more against single targets, and in terms of tankiness you can choose not to use the active and use armour instead; Bracer is better against spells because it gives you HP, but worse in terms of manfighting. Finally, if you get Medallion you will be able to upgrade to Solar Crest later on, while Drum will have to just be sold at some point. I think the choice is situational, depending on whether the match offers the opportunity to get solo kills and if you're not fearing too much the spells. If there's early teamfighting going on, Drum is obviously better because the speed benefits affect the whole team."

TrueDoTA2,3axbqw,Gaston44,2,Thu Jun 25 15:45:18 2015 UTC,"She hasn't changed a lot.  The absolute best ""general purpose"" build will be phase/treads -> aquila -> vlad's -> deso.  About the best mix of stats and raw damage you can ask for.  Drums are overkill, but you could argue for a casual Bracer if you're worried about getting spammed down by a Lesh, Lina, Zeus, etc (though in that case, I would probably advise picking Omni with the PA, or avoiding PA altogether.)  She is indeed very strong in early fighting, but it's important to note that she's an opportunist - you can't have her run in and manfight like she's a Wraith King or Sven.  You should instead treat her a bit like a Riki - you lurk around on the fringes of the fight and only go in once a window of opportunity opens up.  Whether this means the major disables (Ravage, Rexxar shout, etc) are down or you're confident you can kill a high-value target before they can spam you down depends on the game.  Remember you have 1200 range on dagger and 1000 range on blink, you have absolutely zero reason to be in the middle of a fight at the outset."
TrueDoTA2,3axbqw,Thalnagath,2,Thu Jun 25 16:10:58 2015 UTC,"I disagree with vlads. I think that both other lifesteal options are better. MoM increases your attack speed so you can crit more while HoTD allows you to control a creep to stack and it can be built into Satanic later. Vlads might be situational if you're facing a lot of right clickers, though."
TrueDoTA2,3axbqw,unr4v3l,1 point,Wed Jun 24 18:56:05 2015 UTC,"Nah.  MoM is too risky for PA to use - like most AGI heroes she's already vulnerable to getting blasted by spells and MoM just makes that ten times worse.  She also has zero need for the move speed because you can't kite her anyway.  MoM is only useful in gimmicky MoM->Basher builds.  HotD is the previous common choice, but it's really only good if you're going for an afk farming Battlefury build, which is simply too risky for PA to do when Silver Edge exists in most games.  Stacking isn't really necessary when you aren't going to be cleaving them down, and you can just have supports stack for you anyway.  No... Vlad's is the best choice now.  +5 armor, +15% damage, and +10-15% lifesteal for all heroes and creeps, a bit of MP regen, a bit of stats, and a bit of passive HP regen makes it by far the best choice for the gold now.  It gives you the lifesteal and bit of damage/stats you want early on and the auras also make pushing much stronger for your team.  Especially combined with a Medallion on your team (and your follow-up Deso), it also makes Rosh very easy for your team.  Note that PA doesn't have to buy the Vlad's herself if there's a suitable carrier for it on her team (like Abba or Omni!)  In that case, turn the Basi into Aquila and pick up a Drum, or something of similar cost (roughly 1800 gold to turn the Basi into Vlad's.)  True, it will get sold off late game for something better (HotD->Satanic, usually; but you also need to sell the Desolator before you can do that), but PA isn't a late game hero.  She was never a late game hero, but you could make it work through teamwork and smart drafting (which was the only reason Arteezy's ultra greedy mid PA was ever a thing.)  But with Silver Edge in the game, PA is pretty worthless late game - she has 5 seconds to win the fight, after which she's made useless as soon as that BKB is down.  And if they picked a Rexxar, Bane, etc - anyone that can waste some of your time while BKB'd - then PA is pretty much completely worthless even with avatar up.  And this doesn't even bring glimmer cape, ghost scepter, etc into consideration, either."

His build is solid and is a good fit for those who want to play carry but able to fight early.  http://steamcommunity.com//sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=336419958  Make sure to watch his replays/past broadcasts to understand his uses of abilities/positioning etc: http://www.twitch.tv/baltoavanta  Also Leshrac is a glass cannon without his teammates around to protect him, sure his spells hurt but Lesh is also very squishy (low armor) and his itemization always starts with non armor items (Bloodstone, Eul) before getting troublesome items against you (BKB, Ghost scepter, armor items like Shiva etc). So make should to take care of him early."
TrueDoTA2,3axbqw,twersx,1 point,Sat Jun 27 04:05:25 2015 UTC,I am surprised he goes for 1 in blur. Almost every other pro player I saw goes for max dagger/blur first.
TrueDoTA2,3axbqw,DeanofDeeps,1 point,Thu Jun 25 14:03:12 2015 UTC,"Almost everyone believes when you have 50% evasion you may have more chances to survive ganks but tbh as a PA you die more often to nukes than to right clicks. Also max blink has the benefit of built-in escape if you have any teammates/creeps nearby.  Max blink also gives you chance to solo kill people easily at low levels, when you just keep spamming dagger until your target is crit'd, then between 2 times lv4 blink you should be able to kill the fleeing target, instead of lv1 blink.  After all, the build can be adjusted depending on enemy's lineup."
TrueDoTA2,3axbqw,DeanofDeeps,1 point,Thu Jun 25 14:19:05 2015 UTC,"It's more that 50% evasion let's you tower five and tank creeps while farming or ganking. Most pros don't tend to solo gank as PA before they can kill in one blink strike, usually after battle fury or abyssal blade. So they don't need to lower cool down from 4/4/1/2 build."
TrueDoTA2,3axbqw,unr4v3l,0,Thu Jun 25 19:21:44 2015 UTC,"Sometimes ""almost everyone"" refers to avarage pub players, but not in this case. pros always go for this build, they choose 4-1-4 for a reason. First of all, 50% evasion at level 10 is insane because no one has an mkb at this point and the 50% of right clicks that reach you are low damage. Another important thing to consider is that towers miss on you too, which is very useful in early game engagements. Blur is also better for farming as early on you do not have the mana pool to sustain blinking every 5 seconds.  You would think that blur scales very well as your HP pool gets bigger and you are likely to fight more targets at once late game. However, this is negated by MKBs quite a lot. On the other hand, blink strike still scales decently because mobility always scales and you get the mana pool to sustain blinking every 5 seconds.  the balto build is most likely a super stomp build that assumes that the PA is much better than everyone else and can afford having lower evasion."
TrueDoTA2,3axbqw,dirtyslarkpicker,1 point,Sat Jun 27 17:17:41 2015 UTC,"Why ask a question if you are going to shoot down someone else's valid points with your opinion lmao. Obviously If you are skilled 4-4-1-2 you will be more than likely looking to jump on out of position squishies instead of man fighting the whole team. It is an entirely different playstyle, and 50% evasion won't do much against a magic heavy team now will it. Also, saying that blur is better for farming is straight up wrong, with stats and helm you can spam w if you are so inclined. Dps increase and mobility increase from w is substantial, and assuming that abusing this aggressive strategy in an aggressive meta in order to punish certain magic heavy lineups means ""super stomp build"" is plain ignorant. I don't even play PA this way and this response still pissed me off just reading it."
TrueDoTA2,3axbqw,joelstean,1 point,Thu Jun 25 19:58:43 2015 UTC,"I did not just ""ask a question"", I called for a discussion so everyone (including myself) can input. I provided argumentation for my thoughts, it isn't plain opinion. On the contrary, ""I don't even play PA and this response still pissed me off just reading it"" is completely irrelevant and adds no value to the discussion.  Now, going back to the subject. Magic heavy lineups still rightclick. With treads + drums + lifesteal you won't die straight to nukes, unless you are willing to jump headfirst into multiple full mana casters. As you mentioned yourself, PA jumps on ""out of position squishies"". It normally happens after someone initiates and some important spells are used by the enemy. So, PA gets nuked after jumping in, but normally survives because she can't be finished off with autoattacks. Also, regardless of what lineup you are fighting there will be small skirmishes/ 1vs1s. examples of 6.84 heroes that blur is extremely useful against: Storm spirit, bloodseeker, tusk, sf, pl, am, ursa.  ""With stats and helm you can spam w"". I was comparing the 4-4-1 with the normal alternative, 4-1-4. I don't think stats PA is viable, especially with Balto's early fighter build."
TrueDoTA2,3axbqw,Khathaar,1 point,Fri Jun 26 03:59:22 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I was in a rough mood last night man. I agree with what you're saying, blur is amazing and very good almost all the time. And I guess you were correct in saying that maxing w is a stomp build, however I strongly urge you to try it, as if you can play around not having max blur, the amount of damage and mobility which having jump on such a low cool down gives you is immense. You don't have to be better than everyone else to use that build, but it is a gamble on whether you can capitalize on the damage you get when you want to. It is a bit ""cheesey"" in retrospect.  Also I meant ""with Stat items you can spam w"", trust me I know better than to advocate stats over PA's skills, her skills are so integral to her playstyle, otherwise we wouldn't even be discussing w over e haha."

I wondered if you meant stat items or stats lol. When I play the phase-aquila-medallion PA I do not usually have the mana to sustain constant W (given that you need to save at least 150 mana for fighting), so I thought 50 mana every 5 seconds is too much. Might be because I use dagger very liberally or because I go phase and can't tread switch. Have to try it out."

TrueDoTA2,3axbqw,Gaston44,1 point,Sat Jun 27 17:52:21 2015 UTC,"I've almost always been doing the balto build on pa in my games having insane winrate compared to other builds - treads, roa, drums and helm and you have enough dps and survivability to be a killing machine when the clock hits minute 12-13. The other builds either provide too much dps but 0 hp and you are gone in less time than you can actually produce a crit or are just wasting your bkb too early and you still get to die when the real fights occur.   Even though the basher nerf dmg hit pa probably the hardest because it basically lowered your dps provided by the crit for A LOT (from 40 to 25 dmg whlie price remains the same) it is still a core on the hero, but if you are doing well early on and you want to farm a bit getting yasha will do enough.   Armlet was tried before and is a cheap way to increase dps and survivability for a lot, and the item is pretty buffed with the latest couple of paches so armlet pa is viable and effective in some cases, providing even more dps than yasha/basher and more survaviblity on top of it.  AC > bfly on the hero for obvious reasons, but in 6.84 I've bought bfly much more than in 6.83, because the price is reduced and the new changes to the mechanics allow you to just prioritize the 1 mkb holder on the enemy team and kill freely the rest of the team after you've eliminated him, but this doesnt work in an even game, if you are leading really hard go for bfly, the dps increase is insane and everything but if its a balanced game with a slight advantage to your team you should go for ac no matter what, helping with pushing and teamfighting as well."

TrueDoTA2,3avfsc,mobilepopemobile,6,Tue Jun 23 22:21:40 2015 UTC,"haven't played in a while, so my strats may be outdated.   shadow demon + dazzle  Pros: comes with a heal, really nice burst damage via disruption and healing wave (soul catcher if it's leveled). sustain via heal, and SD can both stack and farm the jungle really efficiently once his shadow poison is sufficient level.   Cons: kinda crappy at rotations, no hard stun, fragile, needs levels to play effectively.  inter-change dazzle with kunkka/lesh/anyone with a stun for more kill potential.   Dirge + Kotl  pros: massive bullying potential. free mana. monster anti-push if the other team is doing some mid game push oriented bullshit.   cons: really shitty at rotations. hard to execute. best in tri vs tri scenarios.   CM + like, any hero with a stun or nuke (e.g. VS, lion, lesh, shit even AA and visage)  Preferably paired with a carry who can go aggressive early to establish early lane dominance, creating space and allowing for quick rotations (think bristle, jugg, slark)  pros: high damage output. CM can jungle at level 2 (she's really not a bad 4 position support with a quick blink/midas/glimmer/whatever). great for rotations (either to kill or to defend).   cons: CM is slow as balls and is not durable. punished by good positioning (what isn't?). can be too defensive depending on the 2nd support.   Any double stun support duo  this should be self explanatory as to the pros. allows for high kill potential. the key here (i think) is to pick a 4 who can readily pull/farm jungle (sand king comes to mind) when the offlaner is zoned out. or to just duke it out with another tri lane. special mention goes to bane + mirana for (relatively, depending on the opponent) EZ 5 second arrows."

TrueDoTA2,3avfsc,goblinbiddin,2,Wed Jun 24 22:47:43 2015 UTC,"This is pretty well put together, I like it. The safelane tri is a great starting point for any draft or team comp, and many times people hurt themselves by getting away from it.  I feel like people reading this might get too focused on keeping the lane frozen for static farming against zero enemy heroes once the offlaner has been run off the lane, when at least 7 times out of ten if you've got no one in your lane, it's time to take down that t1.  Still, overall, great piece!"
TrueDoTA2,3avfsc,goblinbiddin,2,Wed Jun 24 19:39:03 2015 UTC,"You make a great point, it got me thinking about how and when to dissolve the tri-lane which could almost be a mini article in itself.   Perhaps something for the next edition of the Recipe."
TrueDoTA2,3avfsc,FabulousMrFox,1 point,Wed Jun 24 22:12:43 2015 UTC,"I think that the defensive trilane is dying as a concept. post ti-4 we almost always have 3 cores tied to lanes and 2 supports that constanly exert pressure by staying off the map. They still of course pop in to zone the offlaner, but top tier teams usually prioritise getting a dedicated jungler that rotates to mid or just farms (EG, Secret, C9), a roaming duo that ganks all day (IG,Vici) or a single defensive support (dazzle, shaker) that deals with protecting all 3 lanes, while the pos.4 is more unconventional (like a bounty hunter)"
TrueDoTA2,3avfsc,nepdune,1 point,Fri Jun 26 21:19:09 2015 UTC,"Good general guide. But for lower MMR players I want to add one important thing that those kind of guides generally underestimate: It's nice to know how a trilane SHOULD be run and what you want to do as a support in an ideal lane situation, but 9 times out of 10 the reality is that the lane will NOT be ideal. The lane WILL push at some point, the offlaner CAN'T get harassed and he WILL get XP and at that point the trilane was a waste and you have at least 1 or 2 underleveled heroes doing nothing and an offlaner with an early lvl6. Sub 4k MMR, VERY few carry players can freeze their lane properly and consistently. Even then, a single bad pull or some simple creep aggro mistakes while harassing are enough to mess up the lane completely.  I generally wouldn't recommend running defensive trilanes in lower MMR if you're not a very well attuned team that practiced trilaning. It hinders your team more often than not."
TrueDoTA2,3avfsc,goblinbiddin,2,Wed Jun 24 09:29:40 2015 UTC,"You don't need to do all those things perfectly to make the safelane tri effective, especially at low MMR. I think at nearly every level of play it's best to start with the safelane tri as your standard and then move away from it only when there's a very good and obvious reason not to.  If the carry keeps, as his primary goal, to take the freefarm in lane, and the supports make their primary goal to secure that freefarm for the carry, the safelane tri is the easiest and safest setup to run.  At low MMR, the thing that hurts safelane tris is when the supports start taking farm in lane rather than dealing with the offlaner (or often aggro dual) and then the carry ends up in a 1v4 situation where everyone in the lane is fighting him for farm.  Just having a lane thrown under the tower a few times and an offlaner who doesn't end up at level 2 at 8 minutes doesn't mean your safelane tri wasn't worth it. At higher levels, the offlaner will be better, and will probably force this to happen anyway (you see it all the time in the pros)  The basic idea of the safelane tri is that a freefarming carry and underleveled supports is better than a carry who's farm is contested with some slightly less underleveled supports. As long as the supports stay away from the single pull (unless they intend to push the t1) and good use of their autoattacks to keep the carry freefarming, and the carry makes it his primary goal to take the space and freefarm, you'll have a good safelane tri, and a decent chance to win the game."
TrueDoTA2,3avfsc,nepdune,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:22:59 2015 UTC,Fair enough.
TrueDoTA2,3avfsc,FilibusterTurtle,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:53:55 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I want to agree with /u/nepdune here. At least for very low MMRs. I'm talking below 50th percentile. Trilanes take some basic game knowledge that I'm not totally sure is always there at super low MMRs. Like how to avoid creep aggro. Or how to stack stuns. Or how (and when) to pull through effectively and consistently. This is stuff that I only learned because I am an incredibly well-researched and geeky 1.7k and I don't think I'm the norm down here.  Not to say I'm a God amongst trench tier players - I have plenty of room for improvement - but one area that low MMR seriously lacks is breadth of game knowledge. I just don't think trilanes are viable down here when I can still witness autoattacking in lane. That reflects a basic misunderstanding of how lanes even WORK. At this MMR I think it's more important to understand and pick for strong dual lanes because those are the norm and the best possible option.  Maybe 2k and above my opinion will change though."
TrueDoTA2,3avfsc,goblinbiddin,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:18:13 2015 UTC,"I make the point again; as long as your supports know to secure farm for the carry, and the carry knows to take it, you don't have to do anything perfectly at low MMR, because your opponents certainly wont be."
TrueDoTA2,3avfsc,sakai4eva,2,Thu Jun 25 19:43:13 2015 UTC,"Strong communication is crucial. Pub tri-lanes fall apart for a lot of reasons; sometimes players don't understand the basics of the trilane/aren't active in lane/single pull over and over or maybe it just wasn't a strong draft for a tri-lane. But a lot of this stems from a lack of communication on all sides.  Pub tri-lanes are always going to be a bit of a gamble, so if you are solo queuing as a support (There's a VIP room in heaven for you if you do this), you want to be the one to step up and try to make sure your tri-lane is on the same page. I would say that in addition you should be the selfless one and consider yourself a hard (5) support, it's easier to get other support players on your page when you give them the extra gold.  If the other players don't seem eager to communicate then a tri-lane probably isn't the best option."

Feeding away first blood."

TrueDoTA2,3attn1,armahillo,2,Tue Jun 23 17:57:07 2015 UTC,"I usually get Aghs by 20-25m, I think? Depends on how many times I can kill my midlane opponent. I do Slahsers build almost verbatim.  Initial: Null / Tangoes  Then: Bottle, Brown Boots (order semi-dependent on who I'm laning against), finish Phase boots, get 1 or 2 TP scrolls  After that, it's a rush to build Aghs, Crystalys, finish Daedalus, then whatever you need.   When you build your Aghs, get the Point Booster first, then Ogre Axe, then the other two in whichever order. The HP boost from the PB and Axe is SO CRITICAL and has saved my bacon more than once. Generally speaking, I AFK farm until either (a) I absolutely have to roam to help the team out, (b) we're setting up a nearby gank (if I have TP available, ""nearby"" can mean top or bottom towers), or (c) I finish Aghs.    It's a little harder to continue farming once the Tower falls, so sometimes you have to stop farming mid and go for farm from team fights instead. Or just farm towers -- you can push HELLA hard with Focus fire, and the Axe + PB get you a few extra Tower aggro hits that you can take.   Immediately after Aghs, I buy another TP scroll if I need it, otherwise I set up a Crystalys on Quickbuy, and build that ASAP. Getting the Crits from Crystalys online makes my Focus Fire pretty much lethal at that point. If you land a proper Shackleshot on an enemy hero and are able to get 3s of Focus Fire, it's an INCREDIBLE amount of damage.   After Crystalys is done, put the remainder of Daedalus on Quickbuy and build it as you are able. I think it's 3400g additional to build Crystalys into Daedalus?"

Blink or shadow blade (for the evasion / positioning, though usually once I get Aghs + Daedalus I buy whatever im needing.

TrueDoTA2,3atgyu,Zenotha,3,Tue Jun 23 20:54:21 2015 UTC,"You played a TB game today and somehow you made it work really well (1k gpm, #justzenoththings). Do you still think he sucks and your opponents just failed to capitalize on it?  Edit: So I watched the replay. That game was... odd. Your efficiency is just insane though.

TrueDoTA2,3atgyu,Zenotha,1 point,Sun Jun 28 06:32:27 2015 UTC,"But terrorblade is still trash?  Also, do you still go for sny on PL or are you on the Manta train now? I remember you saying that PL doesn't have difficulties spawning illusions on demand anymore so he gets a lot out of sny but I see manta being recommenced by PL pickers."
TrueDoTA2,3atgyu,twersx,2,Sun Jun 28 06:39:54 2015 UTC,"yes, still trash by virtue of the way the current meta is shaped  as for PL, i admit i underrated manta - it's no way near as ""core"" as on the old PL, but still does a decent amount of work on him, especially against silences and the likes where you don't want to burn your diffusal charges. it's definitely viable."
TrueDoTA2,3atgyu,Zenotha,5,Sun Jun 28 06:42:21 2015 UTC,"Step 1: Pick Naga  Step 2: Be happy that you're using a better TB.  In all seriousness though, SB - Dagon is so gimmicky and easy to counter (1 stun and you're dead). You basically have to go for the 6 slot hard carry build but TB is paper, his illusions are even more paper, he's slow as hell if he uses Meta, towers are resistant to illusions, and Naga is just better than him in every way."
TrueDoTA2,3atgyu,DangerAwar,6,Tue Jun 23 11:47:24 2015 UTC,"TB is way more like Lycan than like Naga. Naga offers map control and keeps the enemy locked in their base, while TB just murders any undefended towers.  TB ≈ Lycan Naga ≈ Tinker (well, the map control aspect of Tinker, not the nuker part)  I don't get why people don't get this, illusions and farming fast are more or less the only things the heroes have in common."
TrueDoTA2,3atgyu,non_clever_name,2,Tue Jun 23 22:41:31 2015 UTC,"Illusions, stat heavy, Agi carries that like to get 6 items quickly. TB isn't really like Lycan aside from pushing hard. Lycan has an escape, Lycan is a midgame hero, Lycan uses summons from Necrobook and push-oriented items whereas TB just builds stats to push.  You can compare TB to Naga or Lycan and say ""well he only has this in common with X but he has THIS in common with Y."" I could easily say ""I don't get why people don't get this, pushing fast is more or less the only thing TB and Lycan have in common."""
TrueDoTA2,3atgyu,DangerAwar,2,Tue Jun 23 22:48:30 2015 UTC,Its not about pushing fast. Its about the fact that both Naga and Tinker manipulate the creep equilibrium really fast whereas Lycan and TB just destroy towers fast. Their split pushing is completely different.
TrueDoTA2,3atgyu,kewo0,1 point,Tue Jun 23 23:09:39 2015 UTC,"Basically this. Obviously Lycan plays out a bit different and has different peaks, but the general idea of how the heroes create a win condition is similar. They have the power to take objectives incredibly quickly. If you lose a fight against Lycan or TB you basically lose rax. They can also splitpush solo very quickly if you don't have a way to deal with it.  Naga and Tinker cannot take objectives particularly quickly but they offer huge amounts of map control (especially Naga). Map control is sort of Naga's defining factor while murdering towers is Terrorblade's."
TrueDoTA2,3atgyu,non_clever_name,1 point,Tue Jun 23 23:41:46 2015 UTC,You could argue that TB also is Lycan.
TrueDoTA2,3atgyu,SoMuchMeat,1 point,Tue Jun 23 12:57:34 2015 UTC,"Without buffing Necro units if he summons them, or the ability to escape, and with his own summons dealing reduced damage to towers, yes."
TrueDoTA2,3atgyu,Kittsy,1 point,Tue Jun 23 14:38:05 2015 UTC,"As an addendum and often unknown fact - Lycan's wolves actually deal increased damage vs structures. Their damage type is normal, which deals 75% dmg vs. structures, instead of hero type, which deals 50%."
TrueDoTA2,3atgyu,Alieksiei,1 point,Wed Jun 24 00:21:26 2015 UTC,"I love TB, but I can't play him at all in this patch. It just isn't working for me. Good luck to you though!"
TrueDoTA2,3atgyu,KnyghtZero,1 point,Tue Jun 23 15:32:09 2015 UTC,"My style:  Item progression: -Treads & Aquila -Drums -S&Y -Skadi -Travels (now or sometime soon) -Bfly -BKB if you're behind or its proving necessary -More bflys/heart/skadis    Gameplay: Be a strong communicator at the draft an onward. You need safelane with 1 or 2 supports to help you crush it early. Don't miss last hits and once the enemy offlane is sufficiently behind, the supports need to now roam and create space. Convey to your team during the draft that they need a strong 4 man fighting and space creating team. Picture this: midlane Puck/kunka/TA, offlane spirit breaker/Tide/Axe/Centaur, roaming Witch doctor/Lion/Vengeful/Skywrath/etc.. They would be more than adequate at handling brawls. If your team has a jungler it means your lanes are now potentially weaker. If they pick another farmer, your space creation is now weaker. You need your team to draft appropriately and work with you. Meanwhile you split push like mad while also farming neutrals.    Skillbuild: 1 early point in reflection for kills is worth getting. Hold the point as long as you can to determine how to best spend it. Otherwise go Meta and Image all the way. Pick up a value point in your ult especially when you feel the enemy may make a move on you. You'll often end up with a 1-4-4-1 skill build and then go stats all the way. If you find yourself in frequent 1 v 1 manfights (this is rare as you are a rat), consider more reflection points.    Conclusion: It is admittedly getting harder to win with TB these days. Leshrac is in the meta and can melt images in mid game. Heroes are loving glimmer cape, shadow blade, and silver edge making it easier to jump you/escape. Spirit breaker is gaining popularity again and is a great rat hunter. Storm is as popular as ever at hunting rats and silencing with orchid. And you're playing a hero that has been nerfed repeatedly. That said, with a proper team its still possible to overwhelm the enemy with a fat Terrorblade. When he's ahead, and ultimately 6 slotted, he is still a terrifying beast. Good luck!"
TrueDoTA2,3atgyu,Ghost0_,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:03:19 2015 UTC,"TB is my favourite and most successful hero and I want him to be viable so badly but he just isn't. He's been nerfed so many times that he completely cannot hold his own in this magic damage focused bursty teamfighting patch.  I know you don't want to hear it but just practise naga and lycan as they both do everything he does much better.  My only advise if you are still determined to pick him is to jungle and hope to god they don't gank you (which they will, tb sucks in lane against any of the common picks over the last few metas) and go travels asap so you can rat and try and just get ahead in net worth. Hes essentially just a bad anti mage now and needs to be played with a timing window in mind."
TrueDoTA2,3atgyu,Mathyoujames,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:05:32 2015 UTC,"Same as any other patch really, wraith/bracer+aquilla+wraith/wand+boots into yasha into BoTs into skadi into manta into skadi into whatever the fuck suits, even blink+eblade as last 2 slots can work (bonus, blink+eblade is similar to sb+dagon lategame version with better rat).  EDIT: Obviously QB is a core."
TrueDoTA2,3atgyu,lolfail9001,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:15:20 2015 UTC,"In regards to alternative items:  I assume you meant butterfly rather than the second skadi, but anyway.  Diffusal 2 is worth considering. Cheaper than eblade, only 5 less agi, and you and illusions get the extra mana burn (half value for ranged illusions). Purge utility rather than eblade's.  Some people go SNY first with their yasha."
TrueDoTA2,3atgyu,dpekkle,1 point,Wed Jun 24 01:45:28 2015 UTC,"but anyway   No, i exactly mean second skadi against majority of line-ups because even with 1 skadi you face issue of waveclear getting rid of illusions.   Diffusal 2 is worth considering   True, it is absolutely, i like eblade's pseudo-dagon effect tho.  As for SnY, it is somewhat legit but i don't really like it, since in the end even though you get gold like a son of corrupt politician and top tier ho aka model, it still ends up being a plain skadi delayer."
TrueDoTA2,3atgyu,lolfail9001,0,Wed Jun 24 07:00:07 2015 UTC,"I'd recommend safelane with a support that offered good stun/control to try to get a few kills with meta and reflection early.  TB still has strong early DPS and decent control with reflection.  Try to go for a fast skadi.  If you're not doing as well S+Y.  Consider a vlads after one of those -- the extra armor and lifesteal won't help you without HP to survive burst but it is an excellent item with meta in fights and helps you jungle.  After you take the tower go farm the jungle when the lane is pushed.  Once your first stat item is up or if your team is strong mid game with their picks or has an item like mek, group and push with them.  You must take towers.  Early items - stout, pms, aquila, ror if you are taking a lot of dmg, treads.   Late game you want to be an unstoppable blob monster that pushes up high ground that the enemy can't engage into.  You'll need a lot of stats.  Skadi is the best value, followed by manta, and S+Y.  Heart and butterfly are of course the best if money is no object but don't count on getting them.  Something else to keep in mind is that if the game goes super late, TB's damage relative to other hard carries falls off drastically.  There is a practical cap to his damage with how many illusions he can have out and the increase you get from meta.  If you think the game might go super late/if they have excellent high ground defense BoT and radiance after you finish S+Y for split push and ratting is a good option.  Playing that way won't win you the game though.  Your team will have to pick them off once they spread out if you want to go highground.  If the enemy team picks an earthshaker, just abandon.  Kidding, but any blink + AoE damage heroes and it's going to be sad times.  If they have a lot of stun or burst damage, consider bkb after your first stat item.  The rule of thumb is if you are dying before you can sunder, you need a bkb.  Don't ignore Reflection.  Early on, it is much more powerful than conjure image.  A single L1 image with meta and relection is enough to get you solo kills.  In teamfights, throwing reflection on their melee carry will keep him out of the fight for 5.5 seconds and do a LOT of damage.  It's like a single target L3 DS wall with a slow and 50% uptime.    How you use your first meta is important.  Don't waste it.  With it cd, their offlaner can play more aggressively.  You want to try to get a kill with it."
TrueDoTA2,3atgyu,ThrowawayXTREME,-5,Tue Jun 23 13:36:37 2015 UTC,"I core Drums, Sange and Yasha, Radiance, and sometimes Heart of T/Manta Style, he honestly isn't that hard to play like here is my dotabuff check out some of my matches as him, I am not the best but hey maybe you could see the basics: https://www.dotabuff.com/players/246235980 This month I think Chen is least played haha."
TrueDoTA2,3atgyu,TrollingWithTechies,2,Tue Jun 23 13:04:20 2015 UTC,"A lot of people despise TB radiance builds and is probably why they're downvoting you.

TrueDoTA2,3arzsc,Harlequeens,11,Tue Jun 23 01:09:03 2015 UTC,"I have a good Drow Ranger record. One of the reasons is I pick her in games where shes good. Don't force the pick.    Get a favourable lane. Some matchups are pretty bad pre 6. Ideally you want a solo safelane against an offlaner lacking kill potential and a support taking the least exp possible. Hero needs 6 fast. (Shit mid tho).   Early on you are Deathball the hero. Buff up your teams right click to absurd levels, and silence wins teamfights early when ppl can't do shit about it because they lack dispells and reposition items. It's stupid hard to fight into a Drow team early, so use that secure T2 towers and map control.    Ideally if you snowball as a team you end the game, but if you can't go high or you screw up a teamfight and they get too strong then Drow transitions into good ratting hero. BoTs, Blink, Manta, etc.I haven't tried Vlads/Deso in 6.84 but it could be good.    The problem most Drows seem to run into is they don't know when to transition into rat mode carry. Drow's kit falls off bigtime for teamfighting unless you have amazing control from your team and that usually doesn't come from multiple ranged hero lineups. The Silence falls off with bkb and all the dispells and shit like ghost glimmer mobility items all come out to fuck you up.    Edit. Oh, you really want a solid mid as well. Drow makes most mids insane. So a bit about heroes. Aura is like a CM impact, it helps you win every lane, and you want to get something out of every lane to transition into Deathball. Traditional mids like SF, QoP, Puck all get stronger. Viper, Lina, Windranger are all nasty either in mid or in offlane. Traditionally low damage heroes like Mirana and Necrophos all get helped. Techies harass more annoying and Techies is a good pick.    The 3 big Junglers, if can get away with it,  Chen, Enigma, Enchantress all much better, extra damage for more efficient jungle, Troll creeps good too. Again, they are good for the early push    The best game I played in 6.83 was crushing an 'OP' Troll/Sniper/Bristle/Sand King/Vengeful Spirit lineup with Drow, Chen, Windranger, Mirana and Techies."
TrueDoTA2,3arzsc,Mezkh,3,Tue Jun 23 05:46:25 2015 UTC,"I think you really hit the nail on the head in this post. Take objectives as a team early, rat late."
TrueDoTA2,3arzsc,drock_davis,1 point,Tue Jun 23 06:34:03 2015 UTC,"Definitely, upvote to all this.  I would just add that I like to play drow in a semi gank mode with the w as a semi orchid and/or as a counter initiator.  Drow can really turn teamfights with the silence into slow with the q especially with something like a wraith king tanking for you."
TrueDoTA2,3arzsc,Aesyn,2,Tue Jun 23 23:40:29 2015 UTC,"I think agility spamming (treads/few wraiths/yasha) is a great build for early game.  People play techies offlane when there's a drow safelane, then they have normal levels of damage with 650 range.  Also super heavily nerfed batrider can somewhat decently offlane with drow maybe.  SF mid is quite scary with drow, though you have to cover a lot of weaknesses with the other 3 heroes.  tl;dr: I think drow should be played taking advantage of her global aura. Aquila plus 2-3 wraiths (which have to be completed in the very early game) can upset the other lanes and you can snowball to finish."
TrueDoTA2,3arzsc,subraizada3_,1 point,Tue Jun 23 06:28:59 2015 UTC,Techies has 700 range. So do towers.
TrueDoTA2,3arzsc,brinebold,0,Tue Jun 23 10:36:47 2015 UTC,"Completely agree. Drow's only real advantage over another carry is the aura so your team comp needs to abuse it for pushing and letting your ranged supports right click for a decent amount and your ranged carries bump up to insane levels to get much out of her.  I don't like SF paired with drow, though. Clinkz + Drow is the really evil combo early to midgame and sniper + drow much better lategame. You want fast-attacking carries to pair with her, not hard hitting ones and SF is pretty balanced on that scale, edging toward hard hits, better than a razor but much worse than a sniper/clinkz."
TrueDoTA2,3arzsc,dpekkle,2,Tue Jun 23 14:30:23 2015 UTC,"Medusa paired with drow is pretty bonkers too, if you can get away with it. Eliminates that ""no damage"" period medusa has in the early to mid game, and pairs well with a MoM style build.  And Medusa is a pretty solid mid so it could work out."
TrueDoTA2,3arzsc,brinebold,2,Wed Jun 24 01:51:50 2015 UTC,"Huskar, WR and QoP are other heroes that do a lot of auto-attacking who benefit particularly pretty heavily from Drow's aura early into the game.  I would say, though, that while aura abuse is one of the most notable things Drow's good for, I feel that there's more to her than just the aura. That is to say amassing AGI is fine some games but less favorable in others, and in the latter's case it doesn't necessarily mean Drow was a weak pick or that her skills can't be otherwise leveraged into an advantage."
TrueDoTA2,3arzsc,wildtarget13,2,Thu Jun 25 19:16:54 2015 UTC,It's not her only skill by any means. It's just the only one without another hero that does it better.
TrueDoTA2,3arzsc,jobsak,1 point,Thu Jun 25 20:47:50 2015 UTC,"Try solar crest. It's just really good right now and you can shift your net worth or evasion and armor onto any hero you need to. It's also easy minus armor for roshan. It's cheesy, but you can disassemble your solar crest."
TrueDoTA2,3arzsc,wildtarget13,1 point,Tue Jun 23 06:08:13 2015 UTC,Seems like a pretty big waste of gold when u can spend it on wraith bands or something else that do more for your team/yourself. You already have great armor with her insane agi so you only use it to lower opponents armor which seems meh. She also doesn't really need anything else than a morbid mask to do rosh if you just stand on the edge of the pit.
TrueDoTA2,3arzsc,Pentt41207,1 point,Tue Jun 23 12:18:04 2015 UTC,"It's more of a amplify your strengths sort of thing as well as covering your weakness: survivability. Also 10 minus armor is something to never be ignored.   It does help your allies also, even ones that are melee.  People like vlads+deso on stow and many heroes. Solar crest plus lifesteal is the same thing honestly but more defensive and the same amount of minus armor."
TrueDoTA2,3ar0in,goblinbiddin,8,Mon Jun 22 20:25:17 2015 UTC,"Roaming mid is also a big quality of cool offlaners. Venomancer, spirit breaker, Phoenix, Mirana, tusk, and bounty hunter come to mind.   A handful of offlaners can clear ancient stacks. It's pretty much tide, bristle, and beast master."
TrueDoTA2,3ar0in,wildtarget13,6,Mon Jun 22 21:27:48 2015 UTC,"I don't think that mirana or veno are good offlaners right now, veno because he's got like 105 base movespeed (yeah, yeah, not actually) and low range, and mirana cause she doesn't have enough level 1 damage to duel supports (43 is pretty dismal, actually), and her escape has too long of a cooldown.   Either of these heroes could be considered in dual off roles, however. They can certainly take it to people in duel lanes, even in 2v3 situations, and like you say, they rotate mid well.  Edit: Homonym error. Geez, i gotta get my shit together if i wanna write like this... :P"
TrueDoTA2,3ar0in,wildtarget13,1 point,Mon Jun 22 22:04:31 2015 UTC,"DUde gdaf about typos. JUst type fast and hope some of it gets through. As much as these are guides, most people will get the jist. I'm I'm on mobile, auto-correct owns me when I try typing hero names and roshan anyways.  Anyone know how to change the auto correct stuff btw? I know it can be done.  About the actual offlane part  Yeah, neither of them are popular right now, but I think it's because they have such little starting stats and there's so much yolo in the early game right now. Dual lane POTM would be relatively sick, but she'd probably be the 4 at that point.  But their skills are some of the strongest level 1 spells, gale and arrow. If you give them enough cover or heals to keep them alive level 1, they can wreck face. Also, mirana can't offlane super well as the carry will just free farm. But if veno doesn't die, if veno hits level 3, he's fine. Wards give him vision and ensure he's wasting a support's time. gale disaudes a lot of ganks if you skill that. And once you get posion sting, you can contest a carry, and if they can't kill wards, you can use them as last hittting tools.  I wish you could micro wards like units so you could stop them all form attacking and denying with unifying though, is that just me?"
TrueDoTA2,3ar0in,V-ktr,2,Tue Jun 23 16:49:03 2015 UTC,"Think it should be noted that there are some offlaners who can manipulate the creep equilibrium early to give them an enough of an advantage so supports can't prevent lvl2 and further sapping exp.  Ex: Earth Spirit (pulling into trees), CW (Cog creeps), and Earth Shaker (block creeps).   That plus long ranged stuff to occasionally snag last hits is also pretty good. Evident in the ones I just listed. Kick, Flare, and Fissure respectively"

Good positioning depends on so many things, I would put it into the category of game sense.  it depends on the hero matchup, what spells are on cooldown, are the enemy supports missing, how much regen you and your opponent have... there's not hard and fast rules.  at least if i'm understanding your question correctly"
TrueDoTA2,3aqzb9,UNBR34K4BL3,3,Tue Jun 23 01:57:00 2015 UTC,"There absolutely are hard and fast rules and things that go deeper than chaqs guide, OP even named some. Others should be utilizing the creep advantage in lane or forcing the opponent to back off waves when pushing.   I'm interested in these things too. The best sources for little tricks are very high mmr players when they decide to make guides, e.g.I learned so much from blitz and wagas guides.   Need more of those."
TrueDoTA2,3aqzb9,mriswith-,1 point,Tue Jun 23 05:01:30 2015 UTC,"I pull aggro to secure last hits constantly   Unless you are a melee midlaner with >5 starting armor, you should never pull constantly. Pulling 1/2 creeps out of 4 each wave is perfectly fine, but pulling constantly will ruin your kill chances and you'll lose control of the lane after the next wave easily, plus if you are not a retard-proof wave cleaner you are risking losing getting to rune in time. It really depends on the matchup, if you play a storm or pa mid vs sf you should pull constantly and much more than if you would've played a qop or leshrac. Lot of players do the mistake of constantly pulling the creeps into their ranged ones (so the lanes gets pushed) which ends up in them having no mana to clear the waves and no time to take the rune (if you go take rune you risk losing exp, and having lvls > having rune because what good is a dd rune when you are lvl 2 as a sf ?)   I know when I have creep advantage I should be abusing it   This is something it can hardly be written in one tutorial, but you can learn it if you analyze what better players do. No one can explain how to effectively harass because there are way too many different scenarios - what hero are you playing, what hero is the enemy mid, what kind of build are you using, what kind of build is the enemy midder using, is there anyone involved in the mid matchup apart from you 2, how does your line up look like, what does the enemy lineup look like, what is your team goal and what may be the enemy plans for the game (farm or early push, gank a lot or countergank etc.) What most people do wrong is they watch a high mmr streamer picking qop and going and killing everyone on their way, so they just copy the build and the items (even the actions) and try to achieve the same result in a totally different scenario with totally different surroundings - and of course that doesnt work so they end up feeding.   For people thinking there is much more than the chaq's guide - you are all wrong, there may be some basics that some players are missing or havent found about them yet but there are no deep secrets that high mmr players keep them in their circle and that knowing them will instantly get you to 7k.   I'll give you an example,  a 4k player and 7k player, and think of it as an average driver and a driver who participates in racing competitions. The average and the pro guy know around the same stuff, how to turn on the engine, tricks to do while driving, how the engine works etc. but why the pro is much better is not because of the little tricks that the average guy is missing but because of reaction speed, accuracy, experience, focus, patience, motivation etc. etc. Knowledge is not what will get you good in a game, you need to be faster, stronger, more precise, more patient, more focused, more experienced and many other things that I dont know the words in english unfortunately.   As I said, watch high mmr streamers/7k players to learn, dont try to copy their games into yours, dont mindlessly put 2 points in dager on qop because dendi did so, try to think WHY he did that, what was his purpose , what he wanted to achieve with that action and did he succeed, and if not, why? What interfered in his plans? Was it because he waited too long to perform some action or rushed too fast? Was it because the enemies interfered with instant tps? Was it because of a lucky rune? Or was it because the target knew about it all along and just baited him and outplayed him? I havent watched twitch a lot, but from all the streamers that I did watch for some time was alohadance, a russian/ukrainian player (he wasnt pro back then) who was going through 7k, and while I had no idea what he spoke (or shouted) about in his streams, I noticed that he was watching the replays of his last game every time he finished a game, just because he wanted to analyze of what went wrong with his plans and how to prevent it in future games (or maybe he was just cursing the enemies, but i doubt that was the main reason to download a replay every time you finish a game).   TLDR: Watch 7k players to learn, not to copy them with having no idea of what they do and how they do it, more advanced guides dont exist because there would be too many.  I'm a 6.2k player for the record."

TrueDoTA2,3ar9z4,Ishmael_KingOfTheSea,1 point,Tue Jun 23 00:11:18 2015 UTC,"I think it could work, but that's mostly because I feel Vlad's could be built on any hero who does a lot of right click damage nowadays.  One downside to Vlad's is that you cannot stack ancients with your creep and you can't have an aura (like crits from a wolf) either.  Gyro is really good at clearing ancient stacks, so its very beneficial to have helm. However, if you focus more on team fighting, Vlad's might be a better pickup.  You will be a tad bit weaker since the armor isn't as good and you won't be able to buy a Satanic in the late game, but if you were not planning on one to begin with, I think it could be a better pick."

That creep that used to stand there healing and messing up stacks. It has a  +2 mana regen aura. That's a free leve 4 CM aura. +2 mana regen. ****ing insane. HotD now gives you 3 HP regen, 5 armor, and 2 mana regen. Yes, the HP/armor doesn't go to allies but you already have an Aquila for the armor aura. You're trading ancient stacks (which Vlads doesn't give anyway) for 2 mana/sec. Your supports don't benefit from the LS anyway and when you're farming Vlads doesn't help allies, so  based off of the list /u/SavageRS made the only benefit of Vlads is that it's cheaper than Aquila+HotD.  TL;DR Dank Kobold OP"

I don't think Illusions or any other summons are very effective counters to Techies. Things that give vision or let you survive his blasts are where its at.
TrueDoTA2,3asr39,Ailodierap,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:44:47 2015 UTC,"Illusions are an excellent counter to Techies because they carry True Sight if you have a gem in your inventory when you spawn them. You can demine several areas at once. Also, you can just sacrifice the illusions by running them into common mine spots, particularly useful early game.  Naga is particularly good because her illusions are long lasting and she summons 3 at once. She also has no trouble dealing with a Techies late game."
TrueDoTA2,3asr39,non_clever_name,1 point,Wed Jun 24 02:36:00 2015 UTC,"I don't play ranked so much, so take this with a grain of salt:  Most decent Techies I come across don't assume their opposite numbers are idiots and tend to go mana regen -> aghanims, and enure you simply can't push out the lanes easily.  From there, it's a matter of choking off jungle and ensuring each gank leads to a tower."
TrueDoTA2,3aonur,xStratosphere,19,Mon Jun 22 06:22:46 2015 UTC,"IMO, the stuff that should be on the chat wheel should be   not available via other methods, and leverages the translation feature of the Dota2 client.   So, something like ""We should kill a tower"" is a bit of a waste of a chat wheel slot since you can just ping the tower.  However, something like ""Sorry"" is really useful, since you can't replicate it with a ping, and the client will translate to each player's native language."
TrueDoTA2,3aonur,SerpentineLogic,10,Mon Jun 22 06:56:12 2015 UTC,"I think ""relax, you're doing fine"" is essential. People panic when they die one time. Letting them know that it's okay and they're not total fuckups really helps people avoid tilting which generally improves your chance to win."

A good save, a good catch, a good backing up etc.  Go!/Initiate! - Useful for laning or if you are waiting for an initiation. Use with Ping on target. Pulling Creeps - I play a lot of support and I ALWAYS tell my carry or other supports that I am pulling (usually by voice but also by chat wheel just in case)   I pretty much always have these on the chat wheel other options very depending on what i think needs to change in my communication."

TrueDoTA2,3aonur,reivision,2,Mon Jun 22 14:57:38 2015 UTC,"We just had a discussion on this topic over on /r/learndota2! You can find a link here.  This is copy+pasted from my main reply:  My general reasoning for what I include on chatwheel vs. things I just type out in chat:   Speed of use - Something that needs to be said or done quickly is helpful to have on chatwheel. You don't want to risk getting stuck in the chatbox right when a fight is starting or when the enemy mid has gone off to gank your unsuspecting allies with a Haste rune. Frequency of use - Things that you use or say a lot are good to have on chatwheel. Saves time and energy. No alternatives - Things like ""Push"" can be replaced simply by Alt+clicking the enemy towers or rax on the minimap. Similarly ""Roshan"" can be pinged on the map, and items and skills and now even HP/mana can be Alt-clicked so there's no real reason to waste your chatwheel binds on things like ""Abilities on cooldown"". More human interactions like ""Thanks!"" and ""Sorry"" and ""Affirmative"" can't really be replaced with other communication mechanics and thus take priority IMO. Neutrality of voice - I wasn't quite sure what to call this, but there is definitely a good reason to put your ""normal"" interactions with your teammates behind chatwheel options. You invest as little personal touch to your communications as possible so that they won't be misinterpreted and you're less likely to provoke any kind of negative responses. Basically the less personally distinguishing your communications are, the less likely you are to provoke any kind of unwelcome responses. This can be especially true for players who may face discrimination based on their accent or voice.     My current chatwheel binds:   Missing! - I like this one because the game automatically appends your location if you're near a lane (i.e., Missing Mid!, Missing Top!, Missing Bottom!). I also Alt+click on the enemy hero portrait at the top of the screen if I want to notify which specific hero is missing (especially for gankers). Alt+Ctrl+click on portrait is used for the ""[X hero] has returned!"" to let people know when heroes have come back to lane. Mostly used for early and mid game, or sometimes late game to highlight when an enemy hero has bought back. Alt+click on an enemy hero portrait at the top of the screen when that hero is dead instead notifies how long that hero is dead: ""[X hero] is dead for [Y amount] seconds!"" Current Game Time - Technically you can do this by Alt+clicking the clock at the top of the screen, but I got used to having it on chatwheel. Mostly used for Roshan (it has become a habit to hit it whenever I hear the music for Roshan's death), but also useful for indicating rune spawns (e.g. > 5:51), which I use fairly often when I'm supporting to let my mid know I'm securing them a rune. Also useful to tell people quickly that you're stacking a camp so they don't mess it up for you. Another use is in the lategame or after all enemy T1s have been dropped to time the Fortification (5 min cd). This may seem small but is actually quite important, especially if you're playing a split pusher. Just make a mental note of when 5 minutes from now is and know that the enemies have no Fortification until then. Similar things can be done with big enemy ultimates like Black Hole or Global Silence. It's a bit tryhard but can be situationally very useful. Affirmative / Okay. - Just a general purpose response. I like ""Affirmative"" better because it's more decisive and confident. ""Okay"" just sounds less decisive and committal. I use ""Affirmative"" not just for confirmation of gank plans or who is taking 0min rune but also to subtly bolster team morale. People like it when their suggestions are met with agreement, so when your teammates make good calls throw it out there (e.g. teammate says ""take T2 then Rosh"", you respond with ""Affirmative""). ""Verbal"" agreement is good for effective communication and teamwork. Thanks! - I actually added this rather recently. I used to make do with ""Affirmative"" as a kind of pseudo-thanks, but it just wasn't the same thing. ""Thanks!"" is I think really explicit and helps generate more goodwill on your team. Dat exclamation point. I do this whenever supports buy courier upgrade or give me an obs at the start of a game when I'm offlane. When I'm support I throw it out when people buy wards or detection to help me out. Or when people give me Bottle charges or heals. Or when someone does something I've asked for, like pulling or stacking or wards or detection. There's a ton of uses for this and it's just nice to use liberally. Well Played! / Nice - I use ""Well Played!"" I know some people avoid it because of the toxic, sarcastic way it is sometimes used, but I actually see that quite rarely in my games and IMO it's very easy to tell when it's genuine or toxic (the latter of which I never use). ""Nice"" is fine too, but again, exclamation points! Used for anything positive the team does (first blood, towers secured, Roshan secured, won teamfights, clutch saves/escapes, etc). Sorry - Like ""Thanks"", I actually didn't have this on my chatwheel for a while. And like ""Thanks,"" I decided that the explicit emotion communicated by ""Sorry"" can't be 100% replaced by others (though ""My bad"" comes pretty close and isn't as expressly apologetic). A great way to pre-emptively reduce flame on yourself if you initiate poorly or get caught out, or take someone's rune when you didn't see they had an empty Bottle. Again an almost purely ""social"" chatwheel bind that greases the wheels on your team. Relax, you're doing fine - Used for reassurance when others get down on themselves for their play. I also throw it out to counter the toxic ""we lost"" comments at the 5 or 10 minute mark. I use it fairly often just for the ""Relax"" component when someone on my team is really tearing into another of my teammates, though I'm not sure how effectively the message gets across. I pair it very often with ""Don't give up!"" to combat defeatist comments. Don't Give Up! - The other anti-defeatist chatwheel bind. Again, I usually throw this out with the ""Relax, you're doing fine"" bind. Sometimes with a typed out sentence indicating why we shouldn't give up (e.g. ""AM is getting good farm"" or ""we have great high ground defense""). I throw these out whenever I sense people are getting on tilt. I actually find it helpful when others do this for me when I'm the one getting on tilt. It helps me keep my calm and refocus on the larger picture of the game.     I pretty much make it my aim to use chatwheel and alt-clicks for all my communication in a match except maybe a line or two during the picking phase to clarify lanes and maybe a line or two lategame to clarify our strategy. If my team is friendly I might be a little more chatty or humorous, or might trash talk the enemy team if they seem prone to tilting and have provoked us in some way.  The one thing I might re-bind is dropping my Current Game Time since technically I can Alt+click the clock. But again, I've gotten used to having it instantly on chatwheel with hardly moving my mouse. I would probably replace it with either ""Re-use courier"" or ""Split push"" (which I currently indicate by drawing lines in each lane on the minimap and typing). ""Split up and farm"" might be useful too, but in most of my games now that's not a problem and my cores know to farm rather than just sit around staring down the enemies.  I've since split my chatwheels into two separate ones: one for game-related (Missing!, Current Game Time, etc) and one for interactions (Sorry!, Thanks!, Affirmative, etc)."

TrueDoTA2,3aoc5d,goblinbiddin,4,Mon Jun 22 04:08:37 2015 UTC,"I mean, when it comes to offlaners, the main Dota subreddit and streamers have done most everything.   Merlini did offlane skywrath. Purge did Omniknight as did Universe. Slasher does BS like leshrac off and enchantress.   Aside from hard supports, you can outplay most pubs with limited or very one trick pony kill potential in their safe lane. Most safe lanes I see unnecessarily push their wave. I usually have a ward when they have good equilibrium. More times than not their mid doesn't rotate when I'm past the river.   I think the offlaners that I am picking for my pubs right now are legion commander, timber, and dark seer. Elder Titan used to be up there, but I just don't find him as first pick pub material nice Euls nerfs.  I think that in most pubs, you should expect dual lanes and greedy junglers to ensure you just need to have the lane regen transition and big last hitting power if your match up is a 1 v1 with a support that can't zone you.   Legion I think has come up super high in my most played because if I get boned I can jungle pretty easy until they pressure the tower. She also scales well and has Press to cover allies. I think it's hugely player preference to why she isn't picked more in the offlane.   If you want to try an offlaner, that's weird, there aren't that many left that people in this subreddit won't cite as something a TI team ran within the past two years. I think I'm just curious how greedy you can get and maintain a 50% win rate with.  Slasher said he'd do offlane Ursa, but never did. I've seen aui_2k do offlane TA and it seems like high outplay potential.   Lastly, since he's struggling anyways: offlane terror blade.   I once played against one that I thought blocked my pull camp with a ward. I wasted two sentries on it. I asked him during the game ""where the hell was your ward?"" We we radiant side. He said he just sent an illusion to block the camp for the first few minutes. If you start boots, I'm sure you can get away with pulling creep waves with illusions. The hero can also jungle level 1, although jungle gold in general is weaker, terror has huge armor and never relied on stout to jungle. The problem is that terror blade can become a feed machine without farm, but actually has decent damage output with levels alone and can take towers. The only thing is he's a huge easy gank target."
TrueDoTA2,3aoc5d,wildtarget13,2,Mon Jun 22 04:35:34 2015 UTC,"Hm... but an offlaner has to be able to do a lot, you can go to the offlane and win, but that doesn't mean you were playing a good offlane hero. A good offlaner has to be able to deal with a trilane, be able to deal with getting shut down early, and still come back and make an impact, and of course, be able to put at least SOME kind of pressure on the carry's farm without dying.  One hero i've had a bit of luck with is offlane jugger, because I've found that, even if i get forced out of lane, all i need is a soul ring and a stout shield to be able to go into the jungle at level 5 (3-2-0), stack a hard camp up a few times, and then pull it out, soul ring, healing ward, spin, back off when spin ends, spin again, and it's all dead. That in itself can you get you level 7 and mask of death, which you'll eventually turn into mask of madness, farm the jungle like mad, then get your aghs, and you're a pickoff and teamfight menace! you got there.  That's the kind of thing i'm looking for here."
TrueDoTA2,3aoc5d,wildtarget13,2,Mon Jun 22 04:42:23 2015 UTC,"I think I laid out my points pretty well. Ditching a trilane and going to the jungle is usually the best comeback mechanic along with stacking ancients. Few offlaners handle trilanes anyways other than pre nerd batrider and undying.  Juggernaut also should jungle if he's versus a trilane that has actually kill potential. But if you have level 5 and a soul ring, you've already won the trilane. Jug can do it level 1.   Soul ring spam is okay, but you have no way to contest chain pulls if you have soul ring and no boots.   Terror blade has metamorphosis option also to contest a carry without comparable damage. He also can just join his team and provide huge tower pressure when his meta is off cool down.   Aside from TA, I'm actually highly assuming that I'm going to get zoned out and have to fall back on the jungle as Ursa or terror blade. And if they aren't zoned out, Ursa fury swipes last 14 seconds and terror blade is only weak to spell harass with 7 armor.   Few offlaners actually can contest a carry and survive a trilane. I think That maybe I'm glossing over things that I would do that seem self explanatory to me on how I would expect the first 15 minutes of the game to progress as an offlaner, but I'm not sure what.   If you mean ""do things"" as initiation and ganking, then I have to break it to you that almost all of them have already become standard offlaners For that reason exactly. Sand king, earth shaker, Nyx, you name it. Pretty much any outside the box offlaner is a carry hero that needs farm. Wyvern is even an offlaner since he can catch up with jungle stacks, but just is favored as a support right now. And for good reason."
TrueDoTA2,3aoc5d,wildtarget13,2,Mon Jun 22 04:58:45 2015 UTC,"It's true you don't have a way of contesting a chain pull with soul ring and no boots, but i'm not sure as how you have a way of contesting a chain pull with just about any single hero, with any items they can reasonably get by that phase of the game. It's pretty easy to get a soul ring in the offlane even against a tri, although you will want to pick a stronger offlaner if you're against a couple of 600 range supports with stuns and a gyro.  Terrorblade is an interesting idea, i just have a hard time seeing what he's gonna do after the laning phase ends, and how he's better than brood or lycan at doing any of these things (at least lycan can send wolves to mess with your creep equilibrium and get a couple of waves under his tower.)  One of the big reasons i actually (very situtationally) like jugger offlane is that he can duel supports fairly effectively, and although the 72 level 1 damage does seem nice, the 290 movespeed sub 600 range may get you into trouble if you're really trying to press those supports, and it's only up for 40 seconds out of every 2:20.  His health is dismal and doesn't get much better, although the 7 level 1 armor is pretty amazing. I will give him some thought in the offlane (he certainly can't run in the 1 role anymore) but i'll have to come up with something he can do once the laning phase is over. I have a feeling the ""split push carry"" thing he used to do from the 1 role won't be high impact enough, unless we can come up with a more clever way to do it (for less money, basically, maybe vlads? illusions give creeps vlads, creeps push towers? might work...)"
TrueDoTA2,3aoc5d,wildtarget13,1 point,Mon Jun 22 05:20:02 2015 UTC,"I think for post laning phase, terror blade will definitely suck farm from the map. Whether it be your jungle or theirs is a matter of availability and options.   One thing terror has over jug is that he has a short ranged slow and illusions to scout ganks. I think that terror will waste more support time than actually fighting supports.   Healing ward is useful without farm too and can be a part of roshan and pushing strats. Illusions are easy to kill I'm sure compared to treants. But I still value information> damage when it comes to survivability. With a ward+illusions you pretty much know you're either wasting a support's time or can free farm in front of a carry (many exceptions like gyro, razor, Leshrac)."
TrueDoTA2,3aoc5d,wildtarget13,1 point,Mon Jun 22 16:52:05 2015 UTC,"I'm a little bit worried that the standard split-push terrorblade will come online a little bit too late if he's in the offlane role. It's possible that he can still get stuff done, but if not, he'd need to adjust his build to fit a role that he can use to make an impact.  The obvious thing to try, i suppose, is just treads drums. Mix it up early, get your team ahead, then move into more standard split push items. We'll have to try it to know if that works. If not, there's about a thousand other directions i could think of taking him, but we gotta try one thing at a time right?"
TrueDoTA2,3aoc5d,Harlequeens,1 point,Mon Jun 22 20:36:45 2015 UTC,"In not gonna lie. There's a reason right click and farm dependent carries aren't good offlaners right now, including Lone Druid and Timbersaw. It's just too much pressure to be relevant in mid game team fights.  I won't be spamming terrorblade in pubs anytime soon, especially since we aren't getting a new patch til a month after TI5 ends probably.   One proper counter and they are boned. A skywrath owns terror and naga owns jug. When was the last time you saw offlane Phantom lancer when it was hyped before being released to captains mode?   It's more what you can get away with at this point. Huskar can do pretty well in the offlane, doesn't mean you should do it in a draft, just in pubs."
TrueDoTA2,3aoc5d,RampagingRagE,2,Mon Jun 22 20:46:19 2015 UTC,"I only play CM in ranked pubs, so gotta draft somehow right? :P  I agree it's a ""win now"" patch, and that's why i was earlier suggesting that treads drums may be a decent way to go. Again, it may be worth a few tries in unranked AP."
TrueDoTA2,3aoc5d,wildtarget13,1 point,Mon Jun 22 20:51:51 2015 UTC,"I just thought of something, although the it's a lot of my trilane ideas.  Dazzle is pretty popular right now and reflection sets up a decent heal bomb. If you draft naga support it would own, or some other minus armor/amp trilane support or gap closer.   Add a decent dual lane babysitting for terrorblade and it could own. Probably a heal to augment terror's high armor.   I used to spam captains mode ranked, but it got way too taxing. Once they implemented pick order in all pick, I stopped.   I got tired of playing the same supports: witch doctor+ shadow shaman.   It also takes 5 more minutes and makes me more inclined to use voice chat, something I don't always like doing in solo queue. Sometimes I don't want to invest myself into micro managing players who may or may not listen or be rude in pubs."
TrueDoTA2,3aoc5d,wildtarget13,1 point,Mon Jun 22 21:01:29 2015 UTC,"Shadow shaman is a hero i ban a TON in ranked cm, because i cant really rely on my teammates to play him effectively, but if he's got a decent pilot he can really punish even the smallest mistake.  Dazzle TB makes a lot of sense, especially with grave/sunder... hm... worth a second look.  Lion and Warlock, as well as omni, and venge (and as you mentioned dazzle) are all pretty decent as more standard alternate supports in this meta tho, if you're just looking to get away from those two.  I just love drafting too much to play ranked AP :P I just got out of a game where we were like 25-3 because my opponent led with a first overall pick axe and i replied with sky clock. axe got nothing done all game, we went around blowing people up with cog/ult. I was 9-0 then 10-1 on the sky. Great feeling when you can win a game for your team at the pick screen."

TrueDoTA2,3aoc5d,Harlequeens,1 point,Mon Jun 22 13:22:49 2015 UTC,"I mean, he does have an obligation to consider ganking once the mid is level 6.   Especially if the 4-5 haven't killed the offlane hard carry medusa free farming the offlane near their T1 tower.  This mid no gank usually is easy to voice, but I always pester my mid players to buy a TP so they have options.   They are one of the strongest heroes on the map when they are 6."
TrueDoTA2,3aoc5d,Decadoarkel,2,Mon Jun 22 16:40:24 2015 UTC,"If you see pro games, it's typical for mid to be ganked about 4 times as much as the mid laner ganks :P"
TrueDoTA2,3aoc5d,wildtarget13,1 point,Mon Jun 22 17:47:06 2015 UTC,True. I'm usually the only support even near mid before 10 minutes in my games :/   Terror also has range to help a mid gank better than jug. Illusion diving vs healing ward diving or blade fury yolk. But neither of those ganks are working solo.
TrueDoTA2,3aoc5d,Harlequeens,2,Mon Jun 22 19:05:05 2015 UTC,"Jugg that goes 4-2-0-1 with soul ring always has kill potential because even when he's forced to heal up with ward he still has mana, and his autoattack is very potent (and he's also 305 movespeed) and can put people into spin-kill range in 1v1 situations or when dueling supports.  I really don't see much of that in terrorblade offlane, but he certainly has the capability to really burn through regen with that 550 range 70 damage attack at level 1. Just be wary of getting caught out in ranged form with a stun, as the -25 MS is a big deal."
TrueDoTA2,3aoc5d,pucklermuskau,1 point,Mon Jun 22 20:30:22 2015 UTC,"I am sorry guys, i really cannot understand in what world a terrorblade or medusa or even a juggernaut offlane could ever work. It is either an offensive trilane or your carry/supports are so incredibly brainded you should just leave the game, not really talking about ganking.  As for the other guy, a mid leaving his lne to gank at level 6 is a mod that is going to lose his lane and that is going to hinder his own team in the mid game.  Well, if he gets a really good ribe and gets 2-3 kills in the ganking process it is ok. But the idea it is a duty of a mid player to gank is a fooliah 2k mmr idea that should be ERADICATED from your brains guys.  At most, supporta must learn to not to be useless and zone out the offlaner, and if the enemy goea dual or tri offensive to rotate in the safe lane and protect the carry. It is your safe lane, you have full advantage from that, you can use and abuse the jungle to keep lane balance and so on.  Ehat the fuck."

That means throwing 900 pieces of shit at the wall for each 7 or so that stick. I wanted to make a point to encourage people to come up with things that sound crazy, and try them.  Actually i'm pretty sure mid ganking is a TDL/HoN thing, it dates back pretty far, and yes, it's pretty bad, but you have to understand it's a deeper issue, that people would rather blame someone else than work on improving their own play. All the things i write are designed to help people who want to improve to do so.  I'll say this for people who want their mid to gank their lane. buy a smoke, hold it, gank mid, kill off their mid, then spam ping your smoke and rotate WITH YOUR MID back either into your lane or the other, to get some serious damage done. short version, if you want mid to gank, gank mid!"

Of you are a lvl dependant hero who got zoned 1v1 (by viper or some1) and there is an opportunity for a gank (a good rune or a pushed lane) you are better be doing that instead of only getting xp in your lane.  The general mid no gank, report thing comes from the old metas where you put xp bit not really farm dependant heroes there (pudge, puck old queen) who would snowball and dominate games after a lvl 6 gank. In this era (post EE and RTZ greedy mid ) you mostly just farm the living shit out of your lane."

TrueDoTA2,3aoc5d,Decadoarkel,3,Mon Jun 22 19:46:58 2015 UTC,"IIRC, a lvl.8 or so TA with max Refraction and two points in blades can do a 4 or 5 stack of Ancients with just Phase Boots, RoA, and good positioning without even dropping super low."

TrueDoTA2,3aoc5d,freelance_fox,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:28:35 2015 UTC,"Not sure i agree that you'd need that much before you started to come into the game. A TA with phase drums blink can do some work, for instance.  She can take stacks decently with her psi blades/splash thing, whatever it's called. Haven't played her in a while, but usually she can take out hard camp stacks with like level 7 or so and phases (I think).  I'm a little more worried about the actual lane. I feel like she would have trouble dueling supports who try to zone her out. Obviously keep her away from warlock, etc.  TA does have refraction, which makes her very difficult to kill. Maybe just a statty mid game build with drums and perhaps even guradian greaves could work? It's weird, obviously, but you've got meld -armor/trap for utility and refraction for tank, 2.1 str gain is quite high. Base armor is decent.   Maybe she could be played as a statty offlane frontliner with the ability to transition well into some late game damage with her psi blades and 2.7 agi gain (also fairly high, just .1 under what AM gets)  The problem, as I've said, with this idea is getting her through the laning phase. She has a few tools to work with here.   56 damage is a good amount. refraction makes it even more. if she can make decent use of the fog she should be able to duel supports decently well (assuming they don't have a good way of getting rid of the refraction stacks other than just smacking her.) She also has a disjoint in meld, maybe salve/meld gets you out of a tough spot at some point? (Salve meld for an offlaner actually sounds pretty busted if there's no dots on you and the ground target stuff has been cast)  She has 305 ms, which is well within acceptable parameters for offlaners (she will be faster than most supports) Refraction makes her resistant to typical autoattack harass (and also may make her pretty decent against skywrath, who's a very strong laner) and a level of psi blades while maxxing refraction MAY allow her to fall back to jungle stacks.  Could be worth another look, against specific support pairings. It's possible she turns out to be just worse windrunner tho..."

Most people don't realize that on the right team, Dusa can wreck. Her ulti is incredible, and your snake's damage which is already unreal goes pure when they are stoned. With the right set up and a five man ult, you can obliterate enemies. I also like having a Drow on my team to give me quick, free right click damage. I suggest an early Yasha. Don't underestimate Manta, though I get it when I'm ready to win the game or if I need the dispel. As someone else said, mjolnir can be good as well. Remember winning with Medusa is a lot about team composition. Can your team set up and/or take advantage of your ult? Can they pressure early and give you space to farm? If you need to fight early, does your ult shut down the enemy? (Do they rely on magic immunity/illusions). Dusa isn't good in all situations, as most heroes aren't."

Even if your team lets you farm for 20-30 minutes while they're being active, the enemy still has higher chances of coming up on top because hero kills get rewarded so much more compared to farming.  So, your team has to either own the enemy team, and then you won't be needed anyway, or they have to be very good at turtling and not dying during brawls, which is very difficult to do in such an aggressive meta.  To try to give you some constructive advice, though, skip the skadi for later. Butterfly too. I usually get an ultimate orb as my third item, which I make into either a manta or linken's. Next, if they have DPS, go for butterfly. If they have have spells, go for skadi."
TrueDoTA2,3an5gf,dpekkle,8,Mon Jun 22 00:33:37 2015 UTC,"You can try Phase aquila MoM. MoM is really non-risky on her as it applies after mana shield reductions, and will give you the attack speed you need during your ult and increased farm speed.  Yasha is also really nice, though manta usually not worth it.  Basically by rushing a skadi your farm is going to be a bit slow.  If you're not dying then just get rapier."

TrueDoTA2,3an5gf,brinebold,5,Mon Jun 22 05:53:55 2015 UTC,"The reason why manta is not a very good item on Medusa is the illusions do not do much damage compared to a hero like drow, as well as the mana cost on them costing you effective HP through mana shield."

If you have split shot on, the illusions also get the damage multiplier of split shot, making them great at tanking out creep waves and raxes unless someone pops a crimson in the area.  But you completely ignored what I said, which was   because you get something good out of the side effects of manta's active instead of just picking it up as a damage item   It's suboptimal as a damage item: I said that. But if it saves you from a flying stun, purges a silence preventing you from ulting, or allows you to send in illusions to chip away at a T3 safely (you'll regen far more than that between activations in this case anyway), it was certainly EHP well spent because this is a hero who has a giant mountain of the stuff by lategame."

That's like calling flak cannon x1000 damage multiplier because you can shoot up to 1000 targets with it.  Honestly, manta is just bad item on majority of ranged heroes in all but few fringe cases when bkb does not help (overgrowth after bkb was used)."
TrueDoTA2,3an5gf,lolfail9001,1 point,Mon Jun 22 19:11:27 2015 UTC,"Medusa only has 0.7 higher agi growth instead.   Yes.... because neither of them ever builds an item or when they do, they build the exact same ones at the exact same rate...  If your dusa can't outfarm your drow mid to lategame, your dusa is doing something wrong or your drow is really snowballing.   No, they are just as squishy as any other ranged illusion. You can say that you have more HP   Okay, I'm sorry but this exemplifies the completely uselessness of trying to explain anything to you. Tripling HP apparently doesn't make things tankier in whatever game you're playing. One weak AOE is enough to instantly wipe out a set of drow illusions. On the other hand, Dusa illusions often take 2-3 spells to eliminate. If you split them up, they last much longer than Drow's.   Split shot is not damage multiplier. That's like calling flak cannon x1000 damage multiplier because you can shoot up to 1000 targets with it.   If you're sitting in the middle of 1000 creeps, it is. More reasonably, for pushing purposes it's a 5x damage multiplier for one out of every 2-3 waves. Just as Medusa or her illusions using lvl 4 split shot to push is a permanent 4x damage multiplier (or a 3.2x if you don't micro them in range of the 5th creep). So yes, those illusions are doing 4x the amount of pushing they normally would if you have split shot on when you pop manta."
TrueDoTA2,3an5gf,brinebold,2,Mon Jun 22 19:45:18 2015 UTC,"if your dusa can't outfarm your drow mid to lategame, your dusa is doing something wrong or your drow is really snowballing   We are not comparing drow or dusa in same game, and even then, to actually outpace drow's agi you will need to have skadi+linkens+another butterfly, considering that drow will likely go for manta with butterfly herself. And i don't even consider funny cases when drow goes for skadi as well. In which case, you need to commit to agility stacking just to have illusions on par. Realistically speaking, drow illusions will always do more single target DPS than dusa ones. Especially if we take your manta first build (sorry in advance, if i confused you with another guy, because manta first blows either way).   Tripling HP apparently doesn't make things tankier in whatever game you're playing   In whatever game i am playing i have seen much more 2k HP drows than i have seen 6k HP medusas. Did you ever see 6k HP medusa? I did not.   one weak AoE is enough to instantly wipe set of drow illusions   I will bite it, and will take not weak AoE: a single shadowraze. It removes 972 HP from drow illusion. Lvl16 drow illusion with only agi pt and manta (and 6 stats points, but that's liberal, since i have seen more by lvl16, and have seen at least aquilla on top) has 1423 HP. Your point? For comparison, Lvl16 medusa with agi pt-skadi-manta manta illusion has 2053 HP. So it means that lvl16 drow illusion with 5.6k less farm takes either 1 right click+1 nuke or 2 nukes to kill. lvl16 dusa however takes either 2 nukes+1 right click, or 1 nuke + few right clicks. If you remove skadi from equation you suddenly find out that medusa has less HP than Drow and manta illusion is cleared by exact same commital as in case of Drow. Granted, both suck for pushing non-empty lanes since standard wave clear, clears them just as well, since they have EHP of melee lane creeps.   If you split them up, they last much longer than Drow's   If you split up Drow's illusions, they last exact same amount of time aka until someone comes in and clears this wave.   More reasonably, for pushing purposes, it's 5x damage multiplier for one out of every 2-3 waves.   One out of every 2-3 waves? 2 i see, but 3 is overkilling it. Also, clearing multiple waves when pushing out is a thing a you know it. Either way, i point out that it's a clear fallacy: dealing 0.8 damage to 5 targets is absolutely not identical to dealing 4x damage to a single target, hell, i betcha if a hero that had ability that would deal 4x damage to a target when toggled on, this hero would have to have worst stats in the game and other 3 abilities being worst  in the game to be even remotely balanced.   So yes, those illusions are doing 4x the amount of pushing they normally would if you have split shot on when you pop manta   But that's irrelevant since both can only push out 1-2 waves out (20 second duration) and drow illusions with small micro push lane much harder because they kill the main source of damage in creep vs creep wars much quicker.  Either way, long story short, Manta on drow is bad enough, Manta on dusa is even worse, especially since Dusa is not even a split pushing hero, but deathball-ish one."

No, because they now need to be right clicked after the AOE takes out the creeps. If you micro the illusions (which is what you do if you're using manta illusions to chip at T3s), those illusions take a significant amount of time to kill because they both shouldn't be hit by wave clearing AOEs. It means the team has to either commit a carry to defending a lane your illusions push or take some chip damage while their supports right click down 1-2 of your illusions.   In whatever game i am playing i have seen much more 2k HP drows than i have seen 6k HP medusas.   I see more full glass cannon drows that end up with 1k health at level 16.

If the player knows what they are doing they will adapt, either full glass cannon or a tanky build. I love versusing Medusa because she will get crushed early to mid game because she had such a large timing of vulnerability and drow can farm much faster.   I'm talking about manta as a first item, perhaps I should have been more specific. Medusa will take a lot of pressure on her mana pool before skadi and if you are being ganked by at least two players, chances are you won't have much mana for ult + manta, if you can pull that off. If they have a lot of critical spells that you can disjoint, you could opt for manta as a second or third item (after yasha + skadi) but still Medusa is known for piss weak damage and requires a damage item to take off so you have an illusion that does not have the same effect as a drow illusion."

You used to be able to count on turtling your way into a farmed medusa even if you had a horrible early game but now even the slightest mistake or not drafting to create massive amounts of space means you probably won't ever hit a medusa's prime. I think the most successful medusas this patch will probably be those who build a team around an AOE stun like a tide and plenty of physical damage to capitalize on the medusa ult and grab ult."

I go Yasha to increase the move speed which adds damage and allows me to farm faster in general. Some people like maelstrom, as it adds attack speed and some extra damage as well. I like manta on Medusa, its nice stats and can act as a pseudo Linkens if you can disjoint spells with it correctly. After that I go for Skadi and then MKB or B-fly, based on whatever you need. I always recommend Yasha, the movespeed really should increase the farming rate, she is such a slow hero otherwise. If you go Maelstrom, turning it into a mjollnir makes Dusa even tankier and do more dps if they focus you. Experiment around with it."

Your rightclicks wreck offlaners and supports with this build, and you are relevant at all stages.    I think you should go damage before stats and skip snake, but that's just my opinion."
TrueDoTA2,3an5gf,minesterdota,2,Mon Jun 22 08:07:04 2015 UTC,"Medusa was built to hold Rapiers. As the most tanky hero(or damn close) you have little chance of dropping the Rapier, even if you're being focused on in a teamfight. With Rapier behind Split Shot, suddenly it's not so shitty. Suddenly you're dealing tons of damage to multiple people, something few heroes can do and none of them as tanky. Stone Gaze is a powerful counter initiation ult, ensuring you always have a chance of winning a team fight, even if ambushed. Having a Linken's Sphere will assure you're always able to cast Stone Gaze when needed."

TrueDoTA2,3an5gf,cancer_love_ebola,2,Mon Jun 22 19:14:53 2015 UTC,"First thing:  Change PT for PB - it gives more burst movement speed and higher damage/attack. Sure PT can give your more DPS, but even a few last hits on the lane offset that by a lot.  Second, I almost always go for value yasha. Good agi for the money, and it also gives you more movement speed (faster farm). Combined with PB burst movement speed, it makes you able to move fast out of combat (or in) if needed, and move fast through the jungle to clear stats.  With these two items, you should have enough mobility and right click damage for early game so that you can do something in fights, as well as farm fast.  After that, I usually go for skadi, but often, you will have to adjust (sometimes butterfly, sometimes BKB, sometimes MKB, depending on the matchup)."

TrueDoTA2,3an5gf,TheArchist,2,Tue Jun 23 14:07:06 2015 UTC,"3k here, she's my most played carry and 2nd most played overall, close to 70% win rate.  I looked up top dusa players on dotabuff and noticed that they all have different item builds. It's not like other traditional carries where they all have a set item build (ex. phase, aquila, MoM, etc).  Almost every item in the game is useful on her.  Both phase and treads are great on her. I usually go treads as I value spamming snake during the laning phase by tread switching. It completely wrecks enemy supports.  S&Y is a good item on her. She values the MS, has a very easy build up, provides good stats, and has a very strong slow. I used to think it was garbage until I noticed many top dotabuff players building it.  NEVER buy manta. The stats are garbage and the illusions barely do any damage. A BKB is better if you need the dispel.  Bloodstone is the best tank item on her, and she's also the tankiest hero in the game. The best part about Bloodstone is that winning a teamfight means you don't have to go back to fountain (as you're usually focused and lose all your mana). Soul ring also provides good regen in lane.  I almost forgot, magic wand is better on her than on any other hero. Remember, both hp AND mana make her tanky.  Items I would get: Magic Wand, Aquila, Phase, Treads, MoM, maelstrom, skadi, S&Y, Butterfly, bloodstone, rapier, mkb  Items I would not get: blademail, daedalus, manta, Satanic,   P.S. I buy drums only if my team is getting rekt and I need to contribute to teamfights."

I'm a fan of Aquila>Treads>Yasha>MoM>Skadi build but no one has said anything really off here.  Mess around and see what you like best given the situation.  So what I want to add is quelling blade is really good on Medusa.  Killing creeps 15% faster isn't entirely negligible but more importantly it sets up a lot more efficient farming.  Radiant it's more notable because you can split shot 3 camps at once but it's useful in lots of places.  Worth having as long as you have an empty slot.

TrueDoTA2,3an5gf,Avvulous,1 point,Mon Jun 22 02:26:17 2015 UTC,"Make sure you pick her in the right lineups. She obviously has counters, try not to pick her til the end, so she doesn't get easily countered.  If you grab her against a melee dual lane you will eat up the early game with your snakes.  Add in a soul ring (can be built into bloodstone lategame) to spam snakes non-stop.  I think people feel they have to join in on the 4v5 instead of farming. If you can stay in your lane farming while also pushing the tower, the enemy have to decide whether teamfighting your team (making sure allies play defensively) is worth letting you take their tower. If they rotate to defend, you just drop back and farm jungle, and if worst comes to worst, you can ult to escape, short CD so doesn't really matter. Either way, you are farming for late game, or forcing defence so your team has potential to farm/gank etc.  I'll leave build to other people, Dusa has a pretty set build for early or late, only difference I can offer is the bloodstone thing instead of linken's. With some charges you're an absolute beast with mana shield, whereas I feel linken's is a lot of cost for something which in most cases people should just get bkb and doesn't really give you much else (damage, tankiness etc). Obviously still has its place vs doom/necro etc, however I feel in most cases a 4th/5th item of bloodstone is better than linkens."

Which just makes you a walking blob that's hard to kill with an ult, but can't pose much of a threat.  IMO skadi>butterfly>divine should be doable by 50 minutes, at which stage you should be melting them in team fights. People in solo often are dubious about letting the dusa get divine, that said, if you buy it they tend to defend you a whole lot more and allow for 5 manning to end the game quicker. It gets a bit psychological and plays into your advantage.  And with regards to the splitting, its definitely situational, if you are absolutely getting rolled mid and you're not making much progress on towers, its probably worth just tp'ing back and turtling, in hope that you can push through til late game."

Especially on a hero like medusa, there are suboptimal builds and situationally stronger builds. But I feel plays style checklist can win your games.  Stacking camps helps a lot, whether it be yourself or looking at where your supports are at 40 seconds and asking them kindly in solo queue.   I think I'm the minority or one half of the players that doesn't use mystic snake, but I know it's a lane dominator, especially mid lane and for securing farm in difficult sidelines. But skipping snake for stats has worked ok for me honestly and mystic snake is kind of not as good at jungling creeps, so weigh which one you feel you'll be doing more that game.   Don't be afraid to buy BKB or hex on the hero. Skadi is good and usually a go to item on the hero, but sometimes a team has too many BKB cores and sometimes too few.   Hex also used to be better break mechanic changes, but it's a solid item and irreplaceable as a solid initiation.   I've heard bloodstone and diffusal blade are good on the hero, but I have no experience with either of these items on her.   Just make sure you have a build that tops off your mama and HP at times. If you have madness, make sure you don't use mana shield in the jungle as you can't regen the mana as fast as your HP with lifesteal.

In the old days, many a chinese pro dota match was played with a morphling and a dusa on opposite teams going for this exact build! It was at least pretty easy to see who was ahead...  The idea is that linken's makes you pretty damned hard to kill, just because of the stats and regen, and if you don't need the active right away, you're intending to drag the game out long enough that the hexes will start coming out from their side, (or worse, halberds. uck).   The yasha is your first real damage item, and you'll find that with linken's yasha it is very difficult for teams to break high ground. The yasha becomes a manta, due to the truly silly way it interacts with split shot, combined with the fact that the illusions make it just that much harder for you to be bursted down (and you get another ultimate orb, we'll be collecting these).  at this point we pretty much can't die to anything that isn't doing lots of right click damage. To this end, we either get mkb, if we need it to kill that right click carry, or bfly, if we don't, and we want evasion so the right click carry can't kill us either.  At this point all we need is another couple of ultimate orbs worth of stats before we can just 1v5, so we buy a skadi. bam, got our ultimate orbs.  The theme is stats, stats, stats. In this patch, however, you're gonna have to work pretty damned hard to keep all your raxxes up if you want to go this route. It is pretty fun tho, cause you get to become stronger than the entire enemy team if it works. =)  I'll say this for this build tho, if you can drag the game out with this build, you can win, against pretty much anything.

The S&Y early gives you the move speed and a slow to help you get some kills. If you get some charges on the bloodstone the mana regen will give you sustain for long fights.
TrueDoTA2,3ak2tk,kpub51,15,Sat Jun 20 23:42:27 2015 UTC,"Tranquil Boots first as it removes your dependency on the fountain. After that its definately viable to just rush Blink Dagger. After that you basicly have your core items. Usually I follow it up with a Ghost Scepter because at that time the enemy carries tend to come online and you need the survivability.   Things like Bracer and Magic Wand before a Blink Dagger can be good if you really need to extra survivability but its not needed every game.  Other good items are Force Staff, which can be taken to replace a Blink Dagger if you need the escape or alongside it for extra mobility. Aghanim's Scepter is also quite good for what it gives, definately core if you have a Magnus/Enigma/Dark Seer on your team. Its also quite good for counterpushing as you can clear creepwaves at level 16 since it has 20 seconds of cooldown.  Scythe of Vyse is another strong lategame item, allows you to disable a single target for 10 seconds. Another possible lategame item is Ethereal Blade, however personally I prefer Scythe of Vyse. Ethereal Blade however has a lower cost if you take into account the Ghost Scepter already in your inventory.  Dagon is sometimes picked, and I used to pick it too. However I've been converted to the Blink Dagger seeing the insane combos you can pull off, it has also more then once saved my life. Dagon should be picked if you are absolutely snowballing and you want to secure a quick win, however that is quite rare.  Mekanism should not be picked, Lion has no mana regen problems however he has a large mana pool problem. Lion does not have enough mana at level 11 to pull of his full combo (W>Q>R). Considering this a Mekanism only adds to the problem. Same applies to Glimmer Cape. Now its still possible to go for a Mekanism but then you should get Arcane Boots to compensate for your increased mana needs.  A bit long, but Lion is my most played hero ;)."
TrueDoTA2,3ak2tk,Phalanx300,7,Sun Jun 21 13:31:47 2015 UTC,"Up first, I'd get Tranquils, magic stick or wand, and after that, you could either go directly for Blink Dagger; if you feel you need some extra HP, then Bracer into Drum is always a good choice, or an Urn to sustain yourself between ganks; if you feel you aren't going to get the 2500, get a Force Staff. I'd say Blink is MANDATORY. After that, if you need to save yourself from the enemy rightclickers, get a Ghost Scepter, it's great later if you can upgrade it to an Ethereal Blade; Aghs Scepter to increase your damage; or Veil if your team has a lot of magic damage. You must never forget to get wards and sentries of course, and to carry a tp to counter gank at all times. I'd tell you to get smokes, but at 2k, I'm not sure how effectively it'd be. Good luck!"
TrueDoTA2,3ak2tk,dmurga,14,Sun Jun 21 00:07:28 2015 UTC,"I agree almost completely, except I don't think Lion benefits much from drums. Casual bracer is fine, but the only real benefit he gets from drums is the nine int and three strength. Not worth the 1300. For less you could get a staff of wizardry and be working your way to euls or force staff. Or for a little more you could have a ghost scepter. All of those offer much more utility than drums."
TrueDoTA2,3ak2tk,Ronikan,1 point,Sun Jun 21 01:04:40 2015 UTC,"True, I had a phase in which I built Drum in every single support. I used to think it was quite good for the price, not only benefiting yourself, but your team as well. Granted, the other items are probably better; still, I never think it's a bad choice."
TrueDoTA2,3ak2tk,dmurga,3,Sun Jun 21 04:23:45 2015 UTC,I'm guessing mek is bad on him?
TrueDoTA2,3ak2tk,zturchan,7,Sun Jun 21 00:20:29 2015 UTC,"Mek is pretty expensive for what it gives you (not to mention that Lion already has mana issues) - If you finger + 1 or 2 other spells you can easily just nopt have enough mana to mek when you need it.  Furthermore,  blink hex is such a powerful initiation tool that it's usually better to rush it rather than get a mek."
TrueDoTA2,3ak2tk,dmurga,3,Sun Jun 21 00:36:48 2015 UTC,"Completely agree. Even when you have an Aghs, it's sometimes difficult to use your hole combo (before Mana Drain, which is not an ability you always want to use when there are 2 or 3 enemy heroes in front of you).  An Urn is probably going to give you much more in the long run."
TrueDoTA2,3ak2tk,Dancatpro,5,Sun Jun 21 04:25:35 2015 UTC,That is the mistake all 2k players make.  mek lion is shit >.<

TrueDoTA2,3ak2tk,DangerAwar,1 point,Sun Jun 21 03:33:35 2015 UTC,"Mek isn't bad, it's just a bit too expensive (in terms of mana and opportunity cost) to be worthwhile compared to the utility of Blink. Blink gives Lion so much more power."
TrueDoTA2,3ak2tk,A_aght,2,Sun Jun 21 02:07:34 2015 UTC,"tranqs, stick (if you absolutely need it get wand) and rush blink along with getting wards dust and smoke along the way  use your dagger to make massive space and gank as much as possible; tps of course are needed to tp in to gank an enemy or save a teammate. blink hex is one of the most potent combos ever  as for items it should depend on what you need. personally i think blink force is the way to go as force offers additional utility and you can clear so much map space  glimmer and euls are also good as well as ghost scrpter  use ur discretion and have fun !"
TrueDoTA2,3ak2tk,ferret_80,1 point,Sun Jun 21 20:15:28 2015 UTC,"So if you can get position 4 farm priority in a dual support get blink + force aghs. Be active around the map ganking and rotating to save allies.  If you play position 5, in a solo or duo support, keep wards on cd and buy dust when nessecary. Go force, glimmer, blink, aghs"
TrueDoTA2,3ak2tk,regulus434,1 point,Sat Jun 20 23:59:43 2015 UTC,I go Tranq Boots/Magic Wand/Blink/Force Staff/Aghs....also at L1 hex is more useful incase u didnt know. You can get the force staff parts if it is a hard game and u see ur just not gonna get to blink anytime soon.
TrueDoTA2,3ak2tk,Lyramion,1 point,Sun Jun 21 17:28:48 2015 UTC,"It's not a ""real"" item but picking up a mango or two during early game  on Lion can secure many kills. Often it's just the mana you need to win a small skirmish as your second impale comes off cooldown.  It's also a good item to put on quickbuy to burn some gold when you can see unavoidable death incoming."
TrueDoTA2,3ak2tk,Mezkh,1 point,Sun Jun 21 21:45:14 2015 UTC,"Tranqs into Blink, or Force if the escape is clutch early (Clock/RIki/Skywrath, some others.    I'm if the opinion Aghs is fairly shit on him without setup. The point booster is 'ok' as far as buildup goes, but Forcestaff (or Blink if you wnet Force staff first and Ghost Scepter, Gem just bring so much more."
TrueDoTA2,3ak2tk,goblinbiddin,1 point,Mon Jun 22 00:58:03 2015 UTC,"My experience with solo support lion typically ends up with something like wand into wards into manaboots into wards into wards into blink into wards into wards into-- well you get the idea. Lion is actually not horribly suited to this role, if only because manaboots blink wand can allow lion to still be effective and get his spells off even late into the game.   He does take farm quite well tho. If you do get rich on him, aghs is kind of cute, but i'd usually advise investment into more utility items like cyclone and force staff, and hex if it goes really late.  Then again, some people at around that level might have trouble controling a lion that had 4 targetted items, manaboots and a TP scroll, so you'll have to find your own balance.  I've run that exact set of 6 items on lion before and i was having the time of my life with 4 targetted spells, 4 targetted items and manaboots. Then again, my background in gaming is sc1, and then sc2, which i don't think i have in common with many dota 2 players of today."
TrueDoTA2,3ak2tk,cloudy100,-1,Mon Jun 22 04:18:23 2015 UTC,"arcane boots, headdress, urn, force staff.    You do not take tranquils because it's not your place as a support to give a damn about this because you not do things like these."
TrueDoTA2,3aji64,FabulousMrFox,17,Sat Jun 20 20:21:48 2015 UTC,"Well the lack of burst allows more time for enemies to react with a TP/heal/deny which I found to be the biggest problem. Also dagger has a horrible cast animation which might hinder you, especially during nights.  With maybe two nulls, maxed dagger plus autoattacks deal a ton of damage like you mentioned. Could be good for offlane QoP since you don't have much farm priority in the first place. Also coupled with another hero that would make a killer hardlane."
TrueDoTA2,3aji64,Joelramones,5,Sat Jun 20 21:28:17 2015 UTC,"On offlane queen, wouldn't you want Scream for catching up on CS and flashfarming?"
TrueDoTA2,3aji64,AbareKiller,4,Sun Jun 21 01:40:03 2015 UTC,"You can argue it either way...   A - max dagger   You have less skill points and farm, so you want to make the most of those points you can. Dagger gives much better damage and efficiency.    B - Max scream   You need to catch up in farm and levels, max scream is better.    Which is better? I think personal preference, for offlane. Mix build is ok too, like 2-1-3-1."
TrueDoTA2,3aji64,situLight,13,Sun Jun 21 05:41:19 2015 UTC,"It's a pub stomping build, because it requires you to snowball. If you don't get kills you will have no tools to flashfarm your first major items and you're pretty much fucked."
TrueDoTA2,3aji64,OnlyRiki,3,Sat Jun 20 21:44:01 2015 UTC,"I've played around with max Dagger builds before and currently what I think is this: Dagger is first and foremost a laning tool. Blinking up to someone, Daggering them and right-clicking them to death when you're ganking a sideline suits QoP less than blinking in and bursting someone down before they can retaliate. If you can zone your lane opponent successfully with one or two points in Dagger and the rest in Scream, the net effect is almost certainly going to be more overall advantageous. While max Dagger sure does a ton of damage, keep in mind your mid opponent will probably be bottling up with runes or the crow which usually makes it easier to kill them with levels of Scream than Dagger. If they have a way to clear waves and you skip yours, it can limit your farm potential unfavorably (i.e. Shadow Fiend). Most of this applies to sidelane QoP, too. There's just more ways for an opponent to survive a DoT than burst.  That said, I'm sure this skill build can be adapted to be effective with a modified style of play or to crush certain match-ups. You probably want some more bulk from Drums or something instead of rushing Orchid going this build. Maybe you'd focus less on ganking around the map and more on dominating your lane so you can farm a nice item with mana regen for Scream spam, like a Linken's or a Scythe... just a thought."
TrueDoTA2,3aji64,Harlequeens,1 point,Sun Jun 21 04:58:48 2015 UTC,"This build works if you're sure you'll absolutely crush mid (against like Tiny or kunkka), and snowball making your slow super good for ganks."

TrueDoTA2,3aji64,shinto_,0,Sun Jun 21 15:48:34 2015 UTC,"well its obviously the best way to run support, offlane and probably safelane queen. I am wondering about mid specifically."
TrueDoTA2,3aji64,wildtarget13,2,Sat Jun 20 23:29:35 2015 UTC,"I haven't seen the game, but this is maybe not the best way to describe when you should max dagger. It's not based on lane. It arguably isn't even based on farm priority. It's based on what you need to do that game when you are level 7 or level 11.   If you are likely to be casting dagger during fights more than scream. If it's 1 v 1 in the river. You probably will use both. But sometimes you can judge if you can solo kill someone with just dagger slow and blink right clicks.   Most people get one or two levels of dagger based on how much you'll get out of the match up. I don't play TA, but if you see refraction level one, I'm sure you'll get a level of dagger. But once it's level 3-4. TA will have a point in meld. If she skills meld level 1, you can out deny her anyways since she has no damage without refraction.   If I am in a side lane versus sniper, I'm gonna skip dagger because having two points in blink will feels more comfortable sometimes. Also, I'm not gonna dagger sniper before either of us hits 6 probably. Maybe I can kill him at five with one point in dagger, but likely will get head shot procs if I blink on him with shrapnel up.   Even if I'm supporting or a very core filled game, sometimes you'll notice team fights are very likely to group up and AOE will pay off more. Maybe your role is to suicide blink or enigma or Magnus when pushing high ground early and cancel their blink for 12 seconds. Since you're casting it anyways, a max dagger will help more.   Or maybe you have AOE slows and stuns that you need to win I combo with them to win the team fights and game.  The slow also scales to 50% and 525 range when scream is 425."
TrueDoTA2,3aji64,Animastryfe,2,Sun Jun 21 00:53:37 2015 UTC,"If she skills meld level 1, you can out deny her anyways since she has no damage without refraction.    Why? TA has 3 better damage and 0.26 better attack point at level 1."
TrueDoTA2,3aji64,BWEM,1 point,Sun Jun 21 06:23:45 2015 UTC,"idk why he said out-deny, but you should certainly be harassing her. She's melee and QoP is not."
TrueDoTA2,3aji64,Animastryfe,1 point,Sun Jun 21 06:51:58 2015 UTC,"This, I agree with."
TrueDoTA2,3aji64,wildtarget13,1 point,Sun Jun 21 07:38:50 2015 UTC,"Hmm, like I said, I don't play TA. I heard waga say something that convinced me she had less damage.   QOP will still out last hit her though. It's actually QOP 49-57 and TA 53-59. But QOP has sick range level 1. Actually TA just has terrible range and refraction would be what protects her versus harass.   I think I gotta call on mid players to answer this question by experience in the matchup."
TrueDoTA2,3aji64,Animastryfe,2,Sun Jun 21 16:44:45 2015 UTC,"I expect that most players here are better than me. I do not have much experience with this matchup.  If TA does not go Refraction at level 1, then she will likely go Psi Blades, or perhaps Meld. If she has Psi Blades, then she has 200 initial strike range, and 790 spill range. She can trade harass with QOP. If she goes Meld, then she can dodge Shadow Strike if the QOP does not have a sentry. However, I do not think it is a good idea to go Meld level 1 against QOP, as she can still harass the TA with autoattacks."
TrueDoTA2,3aji64,wildtarget13,1 point,Sun Jun 21 17:09:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's more about TA losing the major refraction advantage I think. I'm guessing she denies the whole first wave of she has refraction, 4 charges, maybe she denies nothing I dunno."
TrueDoTA2,3aji64,soprof,2,Sun Jun 21 17:17:15 2015 UTC,"It's based on what you need to do that game when you are level 7 or level 11.   Yes, or more precisely when you expect to get levels 5-6-7-8-9-10-11-12-13-14 and what the game dynamics will want you to do at that time. How high is your chance of staying at high tempo.  If you start dying at level 9 with zero screems level up - you'll grow irrelevant in the game pretty damn fast."
TrueDoTA2,3aji64,tomatomater,1 point,Sun Jun 21 12:50:57 2015 UTC,"While it would allow you to dominate in lane, it greatly hinders virtually anything else a qop should do (quick kill, team fight nuke) and also makes you item dependant since you depend on your right click for damage.  I've seen people using this build and its really not worth the laning advantage if it's gonna render you useless midgame. Especially in this meta."
TrueDoTA2,3aji64,Trollul,1 point,Sun Jun 21 20:11:59 2015 UTC,"Biggest downsides to maxing dagger are the lack of wave clear, lane control, burst and farm speed. With that being said, if you intend to rotate a lot and the enemy team is decked with melee and easily kiteable  heroes, I think maxing dagger can be extremely strong. Scream build has been the standard for such a long time everything else is bound to get flamed.   I think the biggest weakness of going max dagger is the backfire potential: if you fail to capitalize on your rotations you are pretty much useless since your comeback potential via farming is so limited."
TrueDoTA2,3aji64,Sockopuppto,1 point,Mon Jun 22 11:06:10 2015 UTC,It's simply not a good build. Qop relies heavily on using scream of pain to farm; if you don't have it maxed until level 14 you're going to be way behind. I also don't think maxed dagger is even that much better at ganking then scream is. It's actually worse in a lot of situations.
TrueDoTA2,3ajf3y,Jackolope,2,Sat Jun 20 19:53:37 2015 UTC,"Both items are probably underbought as situational items. Along with Atos.  I think once you have your first luxury item and arent't shut down after it, the items you get after matter less. Yes situational items are better if bought correclty, but once you're hitting both those big items you should need a BKB, blink, hex, and serious items.  Just know what you want the item for.   Linkens is only good when there are few items that can break it. NYX assasin and PA dagger own it.  Lotus is really good for removing disables on your allies and remove things like tracks and silences on yourself.  The armor is nice to consider over shivas sometimes, but Linkens stats aren't enough INT to hit the powerspike of Leshrac's INT+mana regen balance.  I think lotus compliments bloodstone decently, but the lack of INT makes the item build weaker.  You want a big INT item after regen a big soul booster/perserverance item. Get Hex/shivas after bloodstone. Get Atos.   Get a Euls first, then Bloodstone is fine, but if you can't handle fights with it, aka you need BKB or something, then get Atos or Linkens, or Lotus Orb.  Stats+Regen, find a balance."
TrueDoTA2,3ajf3y,wildtarget13,2,Sat Jun 20 20:07:56 2015 UTC,"Linkens is always situational and should never be core on a hero.   Likewise so is Lotus, but as a cheaper alternative to Shivas as a source of armor, if there are worthy spells to reflect that lets you break a combo, I think is definitely a worthy pick-up considering how susceptible Leshrac is to physical damage.  However the problem with your build is that if you have no other core/incompetent cores, you will fall off extremely quickly without a eul/sheep because you lack solo kill potential. You become just a sub-optimal slippery split-pusher because you just spent your entire game buying defensive items on a hero with static damage output."
TrueDoTA2,3ajf3y,tinkeringabout,0,Sat Jun 20 20:41:39 2015 UTC,"It's not that you should ""never"" buy it on a core, but that it's almost never worth it. Still is very potent against the right heroes, such as Lina."

TrueDoTA2,3ag2yx,ThrowawayXTREME,15,Fri Jun 19 21:20:11 2015 UTC,"What about staying with your allies? That's kind of how you approach gankers like that anyways.  Between the two of you, you have to make sure to have enough damage to lockdown or burst him through bloodrage.  If your allies are weak early, tower hug and hopefully one of your 4 allies can TP support or fight with you under tower. If you cant...then you've lost the early game anyways."

A blood gank usually is 1-1-3-1 by level 6. And if he's jungling then 2-0-3-1. As good as the pure damage value point is on bloodrite, it won't own your cores.  If blood starts tower diving you with bloodrage on, right clickers from any hero but techies, cm, will be enough enough as he's taking let's say 150% of normal right clicks of one hero, but from two heroes. While he can only dish out himself plus his thirst damage. Both of these are amped. If more heroes are involved, you need mroe heroes too. If it's 5 v 5, then there's something way different going in your ganks, they're turning into teamfights."

TrueDoTA2,3ag2yx,Thalnagath,-2,Sun Jun 21 02:41:14 2015 UTC,"Current Oracle is much, much stronger than old Oracle."
TrueDoTA2,3ag2yx,wildtarget13,4,Sun Jun 21 09:42:55 2015 UTC,"Different, not stronger. Now oracle can't be selfish about his ultimate and use it one himself to escape, which is what made him stronger for me. You can place aggressive wards without smokes and roam like a bounty hunter almost versus lineups that can't cancel your TP with AOE.   Also, the flames change makes it suggested oracle isn't always supposed to be a position 5 hero. 8 seconds of dark pact is super strong, but can't initiate unless you have dark seer surge or haste. True sight did counter it, but a sort of nature'a guise play was strong to initiate with."
TrueDoTA2,3ag2yx,Thalnagath,0,Sun Jun 21 16:34:00 2015 UTC,Who says you can't initiate with it?  Blink dagger exists.
TrueDoTA2,3ag2yx,wildtarget13,2,Sun Jun 21 17:09:53 2015 UTC,"What does buying a blink have to do with oracle? It's like a repel at that point.   The invisible initiation possibilities in things like the river or in random parts of the jungle is what oracle used to be able to do. Now if they see you with false promise on they can run or act appropriately.   And it was about using false promise on allies. Few sorts of initiations from fog with a blink dagger would be impossible without a false promise on them. Against global maybe. If you're looking to blink initiate while they have vision, it's the same thing as a normal blink dagger initiator except it will stop things like precast hex and ancient seal.   It's like a small Mirana ulti or nature'a guise. And those ganks while can be anticipated with gem or sentries, are still very viable."

TrueDoTA2,3ag2yx,wildtarget13,2,Mon Jun 22 00:39:20 2015 UTC,"My point is that the old oracle ulti gave early initiation on heroes that don't have means to do it. At the point when that hero has a blink, the initiation is solid anyways.  If you ulti an ally and have them initiate, the enemy team will see it coming and likely just back up or prepare for defensive plays.   You can be invulnerable all you want, you still need your own initiation, gap closing, and abilities to catch and chase. It's like saying slark's dark pact+ulti is is the same as a Natures guise into pounce. It's two different plays."

TrueDoTA2,3ag2yx,Lazarous86,7,Mon Jun 22 16:26:10 2015 UTC,I think Bane is the support you want.  Every one of his abilities are good again him. The biggest thing for BS is you need to keep him held still. With the bonus damage he receives from blood rage if you catch him you can you easily kill him.  if you get the damage reduction on him you make him do little damage.
TrueDoTA2,3ag2yx,skyfaller,4,Sat Jun 20 02:37:19 2015 UTC,"Since the hard counter to Rupture is teleports, you could try picking Io. If you're Ruptured, you can Relocate to dodge the silence, heal up in fountain, maybe bring a friend back with you. Same deal if an ally gets Ruptured, you can use Relocate to save them, maybe leave them in the fountain if they are too low health to come back and fight (this may result in your death)."

TrueDoTA2,3ag2yx,cilantro_avocado,5,Sat Jun 20 10:09:29 2015 UTC,"I'd like to throw out Abaddon as a good support against Bloodseeker. I haven't played it, but it seems good on paper. He tanky himself, can heal allies to keep them from giving too much thirst damage or vision. He can purge silences with shield. If BS ruptures you, you just use it to trigger your ultimate. Curse of Avernus is a decent slow, which seems useful if you can get it on BS.   Ogre seems like he might be a good choice too. He's tanky, (high base hp, hp regen, hp growth, and armor), bursty stun, and  a slow and bloodlust for chasing. Bloodlust also can just give extra damage for yourself or whoever BS has ruptured and has to man fight."
TrueDoTA2,3ag2yx,bacbac,6,Sat Jun 20 18:21:47 2015 UTC,I have been playing a lot of Bloodseeker lately and the thing that hurts me the most is a difficult laning phase. Many BS these days go offlane and if you can shut him down with a strong dual/trilane he is much less effective.  The end goal is to not let him sustain himself by hitting creeps - either zone him out completely or make it so he can't regen more than you are dealing.  The two lanes I've run into recently that have shut my laning phase down are these two:  Skywrath Mage/Treant/Void  Vengeful Spirit/Gyrocopter.
TrueDoTA2,3ag2yx,DrRockso2112,3,Fri Jun 19 22:19:24 2015 UTC,"Not many supports can deal with him that well, carrying a tp is really the best way to deal with him. For some supports that don't struggle too much against him... Rubick can be alright if you steal the right spells (rupture mostly). Tusk can be good, Snowball lasts a solid duration (not sure if rupture affects you during though). Dazzle is great because shallow grave and tp is always going to save you and you can save/heal others. Honestly most supports are food for a bloodseeker unless they carry a tp. It's part of the strength of the hero. You really need to itemize against him. Euls is a great pickup against him, ghost scepter isn't bad (depending on the other 4 heroes). Getting early hp items can be nice too. Tps and good warding are really the best ways to deal with him."
TrueDoTA2,3ag2yx,docmartens,3,Fri Jun 19 21:38:21 2015 UTC,"Bane comes to mind, and I've been seeing him picked more and more lately.  Each one of his spells does something different to fuck up the BS hp equilibrium."

If a core TPs away, you are shutting down their farm. If a support TPs away, you are making more space for your team to do stuff. Most people double tap to TP to fountain so it's pretty predictable where they end up afterwards."

TrueDoTA2,3ag2yx,ferret_80,0,Fri Jun 19 21:50:48 2015 UTC,Yes but basher and euls aren't picked up right at 6. Blood seekers need to get kills so they can get those items to get more kills. Seeker really needs to snowball if you tp away from early ganks he can't snowball and remains a now level threat for quite a while
TrueDoTA2,3ag2yx,Skyro620,0,Sat Jun 20 17:54:58 2015 UTC,"This is the correct answer. I don't know why ppl in this thread are trying to spin a failed BS gank due to tp as good for the BS like for creating space or whatever. You do not have to tp back to fountain. Failed BS ganks means a poor BS who can't afford items to counter tp. The ""counter"" to snowballers is to simply don't let them snowball. This also means reacting quickly with tps to save teammates."
TrueDoTA2,3ag2yx,Thalnagath,-1,Sat Jun 20 19:10:11 2015 UTC,"BS doesn't need to buy items to counter TPs.  Cheatstick is good on literally every hero in the game because it's overpowered, but it's still a bad item on him.  Basher is fine, but only because it can turn into Abyssal, which is a very good item for the cost.  BS should be investing in real items before a basher, though.  BS also farms extremely well."
TrueDoTA2,3ag2yx,Drop_,2,Sun Jun 21 09:42:38 2015 UTC,"tanky supports that can justify building blademail tend to do best against him I think.    Wraith King is great because you have reincarnation plus support WK is big on blademail.   Undying is ok too, not so much for the tombstone but if you go blademail you it can be rough to kill you for BS.    Everyone knows how good blademail is on him, but it's also really effective agains thim."
TrueDoTA2,3ag2yx,Thalnagath,2,Fri Jun 19 22:20:32 2015 UTC,"Blademail is stupidly good against BS.  He can't control the incoming damage, so if he ruptures you and you can safely run around during it, you'll be constantly hitting BS for damage.  If you have a good health pool, it's entirely possible to kill BS from halfway across the map, not to mention using it if he tries to walk up and attack you.  If you have the health pool to support it, Blademail is by far the best item to use against him."
TrueDoTA2,3ag2yx,FabulousMrFox,2,Sun Jun 21 09:45:14 2015 UTC,"Hello. I think the ultimate counter to this hero as a support is positioning. Any support that can afford to stay back and out of sight can work. If blood doesnt see you, you are not the one getting ruptured.   Here are some more specific counters I can think of:  Earthsaker: Fissure prevents blood from chasing. you never have to be in sight and you can countergank when blood hits 6 and goes on your mid/off. Just get a tp. Later in the game you have blink initiation which can let you get him before bkb.  Bane: I dont think Bane is very good in 6.84, but he is very good vs seeker. He needs at least 2 items to kill you solo (bkb and eul/basher, otherwise you can just sleep and tp out). Your ult is great at keeping him in place for your team.  Lion: Just an amazing support. Stay back and countergank him with earthspike/ hex. Getting a blink ASAP can let you initiate on him before he bkbs or join a fight late without being his target. BKB is a bit of a problem though.   Witch Doctor: countergank with cask early. the rest is a matter of positioning. wait until a fight breaks out, then throw in a sneaky cask from the trees/ highground and deathward (glimmer cape really helps as a first item if they dont have lots of AOE stuns). get a bkb later so that you can ward more agressively. Bloodseeker likes to dive deep and a full duration death ward will be a major threat to him  Dazzle: in addition to being a tier 1 6.84 support Dazzle is a great counter to bs. Create a little fortress around the ruptured person with shadow wave, grave and weave. the target might die, but the enemy will have to commit heavily, losing a lot of armor and hp in the process.  Disruptor: If you are good at landing your abilities you can shut down this guy really hard. Get aghs later so he cant even bkb out of your ult. not the best option if you are behind though.  Shadow Demon: Disruption is very good to protect ruptured targets. Your ult is also pretty useful after he bkbs.   Oracle: Has a disable + false promise to protect the ruptured target. Not bad.  WW: one of the best counters on this list. In addition to being a great 6.84 pub support WW can save targets from bloodcyka with cold embrace and Ult him when he bkbs. If he is your main concern, just delete him with Winter's Curse on 1-3 targets.  Overall, there is a reason bloodcyka is not picked a lot in pro dota. the hero is only effective in low communication pubs (and I am sure people will learn to counter him soon). Ward well. Be ready to countergank when lvl 6. Watch his movements and inform your team about him. Never be in his vision when in rupture range. GG"
TrueDoTA2,3ag2yx,EdenBlade47,2,Sat Jun 20 00:36:42 2015 UTC,"Since you're asking for solo supports, I'd say Shaman. Early game you can't do a whole lot about Rupture + Bloodrite because of your low health, but as soon as you get a Eul's the game changes. Trap him in Mass Serpent Wards and use your 8.5 seconds of disable to kill him. Or Hex and TP out (3.5 second duration at max level, plenty of time)  Support/Roaming Mirana is not bad either. BS is annoying when he hits 6 but if you can make his early game hell and let your team get a level advantage he is less of a threat. Plus Moonlight Shadow can save allies as long as they're not below 25% HP already.   Omniknight is good, too. Repel blocks Rite so you're not silenced and can't be Euls'd if you're TP'ing out, and he can only Rupture one person in a fight so Guardian Angel lets your team focus.  Treant's high HP, Living Armor to help himself and allies, and his invis all make him seem like he'd do pretty well against BS. Late game, Overgrowth is a really big BKB-piercing disable, especially with the Agh's upgrade.  As someone else suggested, Oracle is a powerful defensive support in any situation. Blood relies on heavy burst damage and leaves himself vulnerable with Bloodrage active. You also have a disarm if his BKB is down."

Bs doesnt care about ghost + tp or tp in general because he euls you and kills you, and if you are some nuker like lina he actually kills you instead of you killing him with blademail because the bm dmg hits first.   Omniknight is good, eul is also good because the rite dmg + silence is actually more of a deal than most people think, if you can avoid it you may be able to survive or turn the fight, lotus orb is the best choice of items most likely, better and more aggressive wards are the only thing that can help vs his insane cast range of ulti and ofc, positioning, he's very weak in 1v2 scenarios and most likely dies in a sec if he fights 1v3."
TrueDoTA2,3ag2yx,ltran96,1 point,Sat Jun 20 04:48:50 2015 UTC,"cc/burst is particularly good because you can focus him down while he has bloodrage, and he dies more quickly."
TrueDoTA2,3ag2yx,tinkeringabout,1 point,Sat Jun 20 16:37:38 2015 UTC,"I feel like people have barely scratched the surface regarding bloodseeker counters. So far people have only been suggesting specific hero picks to simply not get killed by him, or just TP. In uncoordinated games, especially games below 5k, heroes like Bloodseeker and SB abuse slow counterganks by teammates and poor decision-making by core players who farm out the map carelessly, because they change the nature of the game so much, I would argue almost like a Techies in a sense that these heroes influence and hinder your usual farming pattern as it would be in a normal game. So now I am going to go over some concepts which are not limited by hero picks, but rather playstyle so that you don't feel pressured to counterpick him every time he pops up.   It's quite silly to say TP and you'll be fine, because you are still forced out of your lane and the BS has essentially achieved space for his team to take an objective, especially since you cannot be there to help. Bear in mind also that TP scrolls have been nerfed to 70 seconds. Over the recent patch I have played many games against Bloodseeker pickers who instalock the hero because new thirst is just so strong. From my experience this nerf is a huge factor whenever a Bloodseeker is on the opposing team, in a sense that TP-ing to towers to farm is no longer a wise choice. Your mobility as a core is limited because you must always save your TP to escape if you can't deal with him early, and even more so as a support; your TP should be to save your cores and countergank. tldr; you cannot be careless with your TP usage.   Other than that, there are two other concepts that hurt Bloodseekers very much. The first is 'burst', and the second which has worked better in my opinion, are 'heals'.   Burst is important because while Bloodseeker has very decent str gain, he likes to fight under bloodrage, either on you, himself, or both of you. Either way, this makes him very susceptible to nukes, and since he likes to get in the middle of the fray, an early Laguna Blade will force him to not be able to enter the fight as easily as he would like to. Picking Zeus to deny their team a global source of thirst bonus is also good, and nukes in general work well in staving off a BS. ""But tinkeringabout, what if he builds Blademail?"" Notice how I said controlled burst? You have to be able to time it, or take the initiative to nuke him before he does his usual Rupture->Rite->Blademail thing, which takes almost 2 seconds to cast and under 4 seconds to come into full effect. Trust me, you have ample time and have to abuse this window, and it's obvious when and what he's trying to do because of his long cast points. For that, you can also use a Lotus Orb, and it's good because BS himself hates being Ruptured; can't abuse Thirst bonus. Heals on the other hand are the best, not for killing BS, but nullifying him and preventing snowball. Defensive supports like Dazzle and Omni, Wyvern, really give BS a hard time. By keeping team HP up you negate thirst bonus, and while this might seem obvious, its effects are extremely visible. Just try picking a healing support duo into BS the next time you fight him. When you group up and 5 man, he can't do shit. He would like to have an aoe teamfighting lineup to get into the grove, but the team heals (especially dazzle's) prevents BS from evolving quickly into the monster he wants to be. The thing is BS excels in long, drawn out fights. He loves fights that go for a minute or two, and suddenly everyone is low and he has like 800 ms. But with healing based supports, that's a pipe dream for him. If a target is out of position and ruptured, he can also run until he is about to die, and get Graved in the worst case scenario by Dazzle, effectively wasting the BS's ult, and Weave helps your team keep up and stay in a long fight.    So tl;dr these are what I feel can help against BS. Heals, Burst, Lotus, not just TPs but calculated TP usage on both cores and supports. In that order."
TrueDoTA2,3ag2yx,NSfwPunk,1 point,Sat Jun 20 16:46:24 2015 UTC,Lion with a blink or force staff makes blood a sad boy. With both you can kite him pretty easily. Add Euls and you can kite him forever alone.

Some teams like to run him as a support with his ultimate being used as a scouting tool and his W being used to de-ward.  I think this is a pretty legit way to run him as a position 4 as long as your other supports covers his biggest weakness (no real stun or good slows).  As a mid... He's very risky imo. He can snowball like the rest of them but as others have said, Leshrac and QoP are just much safer choices right now."

From sight of the enemies and dewarding. Thirst can also let you know when they are doing rosh if you pay attention. I think the perfect lineup is zeus, Ancient App, Bloodseeker, clockwork, and natures prophet. You get the idea."
TrueDoTA2,3ae2fa,genetalgiant,2,Fri Jun 19 16:26:27 2015 UTC,"Because QoP and Lesh are better laners and better lategame heroes than him. Zeus' only real strength is his global presence and ability to deward.  Also, playing Zeus in a teamfight requires you to be closer to danger due to thunderbolts cast range being not really good, whereas Leshrac can sit behind his team and spam lightning and stun, and QoP has blink."
TrueDoTA2,3ae2fa,icarus-_-sky,5,Fri Jun 19 11:13:23 2015 UTC,"Well, if leshrac stays back hes gonna give up on the biggest part of his damage output, since he needs to be on melee range to hot with your ult.  You want to build zeus really similarly to how lesh is nowadays, with bloodstone octarine and a mobility item, to later go into vyse or shivas. All of this grant you the durability to spam for the whole teamfight (well, at least to not to be bursted down).  As for the late game i totally disagree, the nuke damage of zeus scales with the hp pool lf the enemies, which grants you to deal massive damage at all stages of the game. With the octarine cooldown reduction the skill spamming is insane, and rach cast is 11% current hp as damage for all the enemies around. Plus the nuke damage.  Furthermore, he is a natural refresher carrier, which means not only double ult, but double vyse/bkb/shivas, depending on the item build."

I played a game yesterday against a Phoenix, enigma, magnus, et Al (not the squishiest of heroes) and with veil, Aghs, refresher, the enigma was just about instagibbed, mag and Phoenix were less than half health.

TrueDoTA2,3ae2fa,l_HATE_TRAINS,2,Fri Jun 19 12:10:13 2015 UTC,"The point of bloodstone is the durability it brings you (hps) and the sustain, which gives you the ability to fight longer but most importantly to farm.  You obviously do not flash farm like a leshrac? Bu you still est creeps decently... If you can afford spamming skill non-stop and still have plenty of mana if a fight occur. And as i said, it gives you hp which is probably the most important thing since you need to stand IN the fight to continuously deal damage.  Veil is overall really good but i personally only get it if i am stomping or doing really well overall.

It's not a case of item build, but rather Lesh can get his items up maybe 10-15+ minutes before Zeus based on ability to farm creeps. His scaling is better against some heroes than others. For example, its really good against Bristle. Unfortunately, he has no cc unlike lesh. It is purely damage he can bring, but if Lesh can bring just as much, why pick Zeus.   Finally, if you are stomping the game so hard that you can get refresher and scythe, I would say it hardly matters who you pick. Although if you picked Leshrac, he could have ended the game before that point since he can also push.  On a final note, it is not about Zeus being a bad hero, but rather Leshrac being overpowered. He just does too much in all parts of the game."

I think these two heroes are just more appealing to pros because of these features.   Zeus has great damage, but you need to farm two items to get cc and an escape. Maybe?"

Yet i believe its pretty much what you said to make the difference"

TrueDoTA2,3aeakc,Kittsy,26,Fri Jun 19 12:35:29 2015 UTC,"The 20% hp 15 armor and regen is actually amazing. removing meks >200 manacost is also a bigger deal than you're making it out to be. Also 20 seconds can be a huge deal on the cooldown, as sometimes you fight, back off, regroup, and go right back at it, at which point greaves may be up, and mek certainly would not be."
TrueDoTA2,3aeakc,goblinbiddin,9,Fri Jun 19 13:23:52 2015 UTC,"Great item on defensive supports, but yes it's a very very expensive item. Having a naked guardian greaves isn't the worst thing though especially if your hero is excessively item independant like undying and io. In snowballing games, I think it's good because these heroes build both arcanes and mek anyways, similarly with chen.  On enigma, it's a huge waste to rush since the hero needs a blink and a bkb and will have no trouble farming. Additionally the hero would benefit more from having boots of travel continuing to farm since the hero has a great ags upgrade and refresher potential. It's sometimes good to have a greaves and makes your mana easier to manage.  Dazzle and omniknight can benefit from this item versus global silence, but often times do not get timely meks and are better off getting a euls or lotus orb. Lotus is amazing versus global silence.  There aren't really any other heroes that build both arcanes and mek (this item is definitely not a viper or razor item) except tide, but he doesn't really benefit from upgrading since he's got kraken shell. Perhaps against silencer it would be a good pick up. This item is definitely good on Huskar however. Someone else mentioned it and is getting downvoted, but silence wrecks this hero and the low armor aura is amazing on this hero since you'll be benefitting from it excessively reliably."
TrueDoTA2,3aeakc,thadpole,2,Fri Jun 19 17:53:58 2015 UTC,"I agree about Silencer making this more valuable. Good silences in general. Generally when you need to cast something quickly (quicker than Euls) to respond to a situation vs Silence, and don't want a BKB or Manta."
TrueDoTA2,3aeakc,thadpole,2,Fri Jun 19 18:03:03 2015 UTC,Yes don't forget lotus! Instant dispels on everything! It's also very cheap at 4.1k (compared to greaves) on heroes that expect 300 gpm max.
TrueDoTA2,3aeakc,thadpole,2,Fri Jun 19 18:24:26 2015 UTC,Oh! I entirely forgot Lotus's dispel. I don't pick it up/see it nearly enough.
TrueDoTA2,3aeakc,sclpls,2,Fri Jun 19 18:29:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah the item's stats don't really benefit low hp int heroes and rarely benefits the holder of the item so it's not really a ""pub item"" where people play by themselves.  I personally think the build up of the item is just too awkward since plate mail and perseverance are like good casual items. Perseverance helps you lane and plate mail is a hyper good item on high hp heroes, but typically not the ones that want to build lotus orb."
TrueDoTA2,3aeakc,prezuiwf,2,Fri Jun 19 18:40:09 2015 UTC,"As a support it is really always going to depend on the type of game you are having. If you are in the type of game where there is a lot of 5 man team fights going on, and your team comes out on top, rushing guardian greaves is a really powerful way to help secure your lead. But if you are having a game where supports are getting picked off a lot, I agree it makes more sense to pickup force staff or Eul's (not so sure about Vlad's though, I feel like that is more of a core pickup). I like the item on Omniknight in particular since it just is a great compliment to the amount of sustain he provides the team in a fight. Hard to think of another hero where it is a great first pickup though."
TrueDoTA2,3aeakc,Crazywombat1,1 point,Fri Jun 19 17:26:28 2015 UTC,"The question is; how well does it REALLY secure your lead compared to putting that money towards a Vlads? It gives 25 more mana and 0  more hp per teamfight to your team. The only difference is the armor and low-HP passive, and your opponents can play around the second one pretty easily - accidentally, sometimes. I feel Vlads is a very powerful support item for teamfights these days, if you're against heavy early physical damage: It provides a lot to your team, and almost nothing exclusively to yourself.  For Omni I personally don't even like Mek. He can't really support the mana without a Soul Ring before the Mek, and if you did that the big benefit of upgrading to Greaves (mana) is lost since you're fine with just Soul Ring. I'd much rather work on a Blink or Glimmer Cape, both absurdly good items on Omni."
TrueDoTA2,3aeakc,tinkeringabout,2,Fri Jun 19 17:37:13 2015 UTC,"Removing the mana cost from mek is a HUGE deal because now you no longer need to decide whether to use the mek heal or use one last spell to help your team in a fight; now you can do both. The cooldown is also a big deal, I have often used it twice during teamfights so I think it's a bit wrong to say it only has time for one use."
TrueDoTA2,3aeakc,UNBR34K4BL3,3,Fri Jun 19 21:08:03 2015 UTC,this item owns on huskar
TrueDoTA2,3aeakc,Turtlez4lyfe,2,Fri Jun 19 17:10:09 2015 UTC,"I think you are definitely underrating the item.   People don't really get the concept of Mek. In old, slower paced patches, Mek had an acceptable mana cost so much that almost anyone could purchase it (BB, random offlanes). The reason for going mek on cores was for timing pushes so that if the mek carrier on the opposing team was going to be a support, they would be crushed by the deathball. Essentially, if say, I have mek and you don't, you are at a significant disadvantage in every fight until you have your mek.  This got nerfed by the increased mana cost on mek. Contrary to popular belief, it did not kill the item at all. It could still be solved by carrying a magic stick with full charges, keeping it just to pop the mek. And that is why Mek is still viable on heroes like Viper, even though he has a abysmal mana pool; pop the wand then the mek, effectively only increasing the cost by 200g?  The thing unlike what you are saying, is that Guardian Greaves is actually best if rushed now. Let's not even talk about the removal of manacost, or Mend, or the dispel. But remember that because on top of the original manacost for Mek they added an increase in the cooldown. This means that mek usage cannot be flippant anymore. You can't use it to heal 1 guy for fun just so he feels safe. No, you go and use an urn for that. Now timed pushes are harder, sometimes the mek really matters and you have to wait a little more than a minute to go high ground because you used it at T2 (65 whopping seconds! That's longer than the cooldown of a Shadowdance or lv16 Naga song). But the cooldown on greaves basically gives you a choice in reversing this mek nerf to 45 seconds, giving you a huge advantage over the enemy team. Now it becomes 'if I have greaves, but you only have mek, I can still fight you head-on and I will have a significant advantage 2 times out of every 3 times,' or, I can fight you 3 times for every 2 times you can take a fight with me.  This is a very important concept that is subtle and not directly tangible from the item. If you play in a competitive/team environment the differences between a team with mek versus a team with greaves will come visible clear as day to you. I'm not saying a core should rush it, like Viper should go GG; no. But to have someone building into a GG ASAP over the other team has a huge and considerable difference in how the two teams have to react to each other."
TrueDoTA2,3aeakc,cloudy100,1 point,Sat Jun 20 16:56:09 2015 UTC,"I think it's only worth rushing on undying, where the low HP bonuses actually matter a lot, and the dispel is great if you get silenced before you can cast your spells in a fight."

TrueDoTA2,3aeakc,Thalnagath,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:48:07 2015 UTC,"I was thinking about this item a lot. What would make it a truly top tier item would be if the active could be cast on a target. To me the major benefit you get is the debuff removal ability that the caster receives from the active. Someone could sit in the back and cast it on a carry to remove a debuff it make that the original of the aoe buff, assuming the cast range is short enough it always affects the caster, now we are talking. That ids item you rush."
TrueDoTA2,3aef4v,tkalamov,4,Fri Jun 19 13:23:22 2015 UTC,"His laning phase is pretty fucking hard now that he has to tickle the creeps to death before he builds +damage. The nerf to battle trance sucks too. I don't think he was overnerfed, but his laning phase is weak enough to where I never go mid as him anymore. I still think he's a fine carry, but the greedy style of play that took advantage of his absurd farming speeds in 6.83 doesn't really seem feasible in this patch. The nerf to QB makes Troll (who gets the majority of his early game damage from Phase Boots + Aquila + bashes) farm noticeably slower too.  I haven't had much success with him this patch. Before he got popular, I used to build Sange + OoV first over Yasha because the early HP pool is nice, and the maim procs + slow were really useful. People tend to underestimate how many whacks Troll can get in with his ranged form because of fervor. I didn't really understand at the time how fast Troll can farm. I might try that again, idk."
TrueDoTA2,3aef4v,amttc,5,Fri Jun 19 16:34:27 2015 UTC,"He's not a hard carry any more, he's like a member of the tri-core meta at best"
TrueDoTA2,3aef4v,docmartens,5,Fri Jun 19 18:59:36 2015 UTC,"Nerfed really hard, hard to cs on lane because melee form doesn't give you additional 15 damage anymore (which was huge), ult duration reduction nerfed his fast roshan and silver edge is now number 1 item against troll since it disables his fervor and bashes.   Literally unplayable."
TrueDoTA2,3aef4v,FaustTheSlayer,5,Fri Jun 19 13:38:36 2015 UTC,I think they nerfed him too hard. Sniper is still playable at least. Troll just talke such a long time to come online now.
TrueDoTA2,3aef4v,Lazarous86,0,Fri Jun 19 16:20:48 2015 UTC,"Well he was fucking ridiculous in the laning phase so I think that nerf is more than justified. I agree that perhaps he's been nerfed too much across the board, but you're probably being a bit too harsh."
TrueDoTA2,3aef4v,itaShadd,2,Fri Jun 19 17:51:33 2015 UTC,"The base damage nerf was huge. I mean vision from axes was important too, but 15 less damage off the bat is big. If I'm going leshrac mid,  I ask someone to pick up troll or pugna. Both are pretty good counters to leshrac and both are fast pushers. Adding troll to a physical damage lineup is still a great idea.  You can still win the game by yourself,  but early game has been nerfed."
TrueDoTA2,3aef4v,Jackolope,2,Fri Jun 19 19:44:34 2015 UTC,"They really didn't nerf his carry potential that much, -15 damage for melee form isn't significant in late game and the ult nerf is big but it's still very good. I think he's not seeing any play because it's a matter of ""This hero used to be so good and now its iffy.."" Basically people have a psychological barrier to play a nerfed hero because it just used to be... better. At least that's what I think."
TrueDoTA2,3aef4v,l_HATE_TRAINS,1 point,Fri Jun 19 19:31:09 2015 UTC,"I think he's still solid in some situations. His ult still helps in team fights and for pushing. Blind is a powerful early and mid game mechanic. He still builds BKB which is strong still.    I've also been theory crafting him as a support. I'll need to try running it with friends. I did it once in a pub and we basically lost before the game started because no one tried because they thought it was stupid.  My idea behind it is that:   Ranged Axes is a decent slow in laning phase, pretty low cost for mana as well Stacking attack speed makes it harder for offlaners to trade attacks with you Get a value point in melee form (around lvl 5) because Axes Melee is good Your Ult is good no matter what role you are   I am thinking you build him out like:   Treads Medallion/Urn Force Staff/Blink/Glimmer Cape Drums/Vlads/Mek (might need Arcanes over treads for that though)   Main issue would be mid-game where he has no guaranteed stun, his HP is kinda low to yolo hope for bashes (e.g. like Spirit Breaker could), and BKBs make both his Axes less useful. He could go after squishy supports or something though. And in theory, if he gets his ult off, that should be plenty helpful.  You could also have him split push (or find farm in jungle) and still contribute globally, or go full greedy 2nd support and build out more like a utlity/semi-carry."
TrueDoTA2,3aef4v,Axosh,4,Fri Jun 19 16:35:27 2015 UTC,"I see your reasoning but you basically waste 2 skills (your BASH and fervor) of the hero, it's one of these cases that maybe it could work in some situation but another hero would probably do better under circumnstances, so why make an effort to make it work..."
TrueDoTA2,3aef4v,l_HATE_TRAINS,2,Fri Jun 19 19:27:38 2015 UTC,"I agree, depends on the circumstances.   basically waste 2 skills   I know what you are saying, but I do have a counterpoint. There are supports that are picked up with wasted potential in their abilities.  For instance:   Wraith King - his crit Spirit Breaker - his bash   You can make arguments similar based on items too. Like Treant has a pretty solid Aghs upgrade, but it is hard for him to farm that up when he is run support.  My feeling is that you are still getting some benefit out of fervor for laning (zoning/trading hits), and it's not going to hurt you for pushing and fighting. The bash is hard to use if you don't have survivability, but it's still somewhat useful if you happen to get a proc.   another hero would probably do better   In my mind, it's really not any worse than picking AA support. When you compare them:   Both have unreliable stun (bash / cold feet) Both have a minor slow (ranged axes / vortex) Both have an aoe spell to help fight (melee axes blind / chilling touch) Both have global ults   There are pros/cons to each like:   Cold Feet is guaranteed if there is another stun Chilling Touch is aggro, while melee axes is defensive (with some damage) Vortex gives vision and increases magic damage, while ranged axes does damage and has a fairly low mana cost etc..    why make an effort to make it work   For me, probably isn't a lot of incentive other than to have ""invented"" something, or if it works out well then maybe it scores a ton of MMR.  At a competitive level it can be useful to have things played in unconventional ways. For instance, if you picked up something like a Spirit Breaker and Troll in round one with an intention to have Spirit Breaker play roaming support and Troll as a lane support, then they might waste bans round 2 on supports and give you really good cores.  While it's not super applicable here, if you did this with another hero you could get them to:   Misread lanes Put a lot of emphasis in picks/laning to shut that hero down   It's also just kind of fun to think up new shit, and breaking the meta is the best way to stay on top (though I'm not nearly close to that).    EDIT:  Also, how many pub games have you gotten where you have like a jungle LC and a farming PA or something? Meanwhile, you're left to play a lane support and you know you'll be bitched at to ""zone"" and ""harass"". Troll ult can be huge in those types of games, and ferver might turn out to be a great zoning tool. If support Troll can be made to work, then it opens up some solid synergies."
TrueDoTA2,3aef4v,Axosh,2,Fri Jun 19 20:36:47 2015 UTC,I think you should get melee form early. The extra movespeed and nuke is great for a support. Atk speed only seems OK in comparison.
TrueDoTA2,3aef4v,Last_Laugh,2,Fri Jun 19 20:26:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think that would make sense for like 90% of games. As long as you have kill potential, it would be good to get it early so you have both Ranged and Melee Axes avilable to you.  If you're in a lane where you primarily zoning, I was thinking even a 1-2-2 build could be ok. I think it is critical to get at least 1 level in Ferver because it makes it much more costly for an offlaner to try to trade hits with you, especially since you have 500 range so they will take hits as they back away too.  Seems to me like you'd almost always want to do 1-1-1 into 1-3-1."
TrueDoTA2,3aef4v,Axosh,1 point,Fri Jun 19 20:43:18 2015 UTC,"In my mind, Troll (used to) excel at coming online quickly with strong lane presence, and being able to focus down any 1 hero in a fight, taking them out before they can do anything about it.  Honestly, now Spirit Breaker does the exact same thing, except better. Troll's early game presence got eviscerated whereas SB is as powerful as ever. The only reason I would take Troll over SB is if I desperately needed his ult. But how many games do you honestly say to yourself, ""let's pick troll solely for his ult""?   There are a couple situations, admittedly, but they're few and far between.  I just can't think of any situation where I would go ""I think Spirit Breaker would be good here. Wait no, Troll would be better let's do that"". It just doesn't happen."
TrueDoTA2,3aef4v,nbwk,7,Fri Jun 19 19:13:16 2015 UTC,"Except troll isn't the same role as spirit breaker. Yeah sure, they both tend to focus one person down from 100-> 0 in a fight but they are totally different. Spirit Breaker is picked because he's a durable offlaner which provides global presence and is very useful for ganking and fighting early while troll is (was) picked for his late game potential, roshan slaying and tower breaking abilities."
TrueDoTA2,3aef4v,l_HATE_TRAINS,3,Fri Jun 19 19:33:30 2015 UTC,"??  Troll farms much better in all stages of the game. He can get farm even when he is behind (bara has no cathcup mechanism, he can't farm at all). Even if bara is snowballing troll provides more dps and is more threatening than bara with just 2-3 items. Late game is out of the question, 6 slotted troll is a murder machine compared to space cow. To add to this, bara offer nothing when pushing towers or roshing (while troll is very good at both). Troll is also much better in lane due to ranged form and being able to cs with his skills."
TrueDoTA2,3aef4v,FabulousMrFox,1 point,Sat Jun 20 01:02:13 2015 UTC,It's not the nerfs that killed him but the shift in meta. Now you can just push before he comes online and even if he gets a few kills the comeback gold won't be enough for him to carry.
TrueDoTA2,3aef4v,genetalgiant,1 point,Fri Jun 19 18:36:29 2015 UTC,"He comes online so much later than he used to and got his overall effectiveness at all but the final stages of the game heavily nerfed. His easy free roshan got hit hard so it's much slower (2 seconds of 120 attack speed gone, and the quelling blade damage being removed)  I'm fairly sure there are no situations where he's especially good. He doesn't do anything really special other than hit fast, run fast and bash a lot, especially now that farming got some hits (less gold, quelling doesn't effect bonus damage) and his individual farming speed got hit pretty badly (-15 damage)  He's just not what he used to be at all. He has no lane dominance anymore."

I'll just quote an earlier comment of mine here:   I can feel the difference that this patch has brought. But that hasn't stopped me from picking him; I still think he's a very strong late-gamer and it was a well-deserved patch that weakened his early-mid game strength while leaving his late-game untouched.  In pubs where people rarely close out games early, I farm quickly with Troll and try to get 4-5 slotted by midgame; Troll with 4 items is really strong. My go-to build is Aquila->Boots->Morbid Mask->Phase->SnY/SilverEdge->BKB->Butterfly->HoTD->Satanic->Daedalus. Blink, situationally."

Nethertoxin gives bonus attack damage (it lifesteals and crits and cleaves in AD :P) so it shouldn't be affected by the spell lifesteal, but the tick damage from poison attack, the debuff from corrosive, and of course the damage from our ultimate should all heal us up.  Be careful tho, because at this point in the game (only consider this item super late when you have a big pile of cash) you may have guardian greaves, and the core will reduce the cooldown of the item to 33.75 seconds, but the debuff lasts for 43, so if you don't wait 10ish seconds after it comes back up to pop it again, it won't heal anybody! The same type of thing happens (i think, haven't tested) to crimson guard and pipe, so watch those debuff timers!

TrueDoTA2,3acdwu,dorox1,1 point,Wed Jun 24 07:17:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah. I just think that Viper gets solo kills fine without SB, especially with Aghs. I was thinking Yasha is a good idea with greaves because you don't have Phase Boots.  Eventually, you get to a point where they keep giving you solo kills or they team up. Then you have to do a lot of smart targeting."
TrueDoTA2,3acdwu,dorox1,1 point,Fri Jun 19 02:11:28 2015 UTC,"Myself, i actually like to go for ""pure tank"" builds on viper, like mek -> aghs -> finish guardian's -> Crimson for example, and focus on how incredibly difficult viper can be to deal with in team engagements if he positions aggressively enough. Pro players often talk about ""creating chaos"" and viper can certainly do plenty of that.   That being said, yasha, as you say, is a very good item, is very good for viper's mobility, and can certainly be very effective, especially for cutting down your opponent's ability to farm the map."
TrueDoTA2,3acdwu,thadpole,2,Fri Jun 19 02:38:57 2015 UTC,"Going farther into the tanky mobility-denying viper role, I wonder if SnY might be viable instead of Manta once you start trying to save slots in your build... maybe a Skadi once you start into your luxury items to net you the stats you lost from Manta's orb?  Maybe more valuable vs a melee right-click based lineup?"
TrueDoTA2,3acdwu,Conpen,1 point,Fri Jun 19 03:21:55 2015 UTC,"Manta is great, SnY is also great. They do different, but similar things. Skadi is a fine item on anyone who likes to attack and finds the gold in the late game, just for the bundle of stats. I usually prefer to go for team tank items like crimson, pipe and/or guardian greaves, however.  Basically I play him like a str offlane :P"
TrueDoTA2,3acdwu,Conpen,1 point,Fri Jun 19 04:04:00 2015 UTC,"I was mathing out the value(if you're nether maxed which i read you don't like) of dagon rushing on viper. Idea being that you dagon someone from full to half, then get all the bonus damage to secure the kill. It's maybe a thing, but shadow blade does a similar thing and gives you the chance to sneak up on them as well, so maybe not."
TrueDoTA2,3acdwu,10pack,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:31:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah, no the dagon doesn't really seem to do anything that you want. You're already good at picking off isolated heroes, and you dont need a super gold inefficient item to make you better at that. Just statty mobility like drums and the extra reach with ult from aghs do a much better job of that, while also helping you be a front line tank."
TrueDoTA2,3acdwu,rudolfs_padded_cell,8,Tue Jun 23 22:28:22 2015 UTC,"I agree with a lot of what you say here. I've achieved a >70% winrate with viper over 56 games, almost all of the them solo queue. I've run mid, offlane, and safelane, depending on what the team needs.  I disagree that leaving Nethertoxin underleveled is the correct choice. I am almost always 1-1-1-0 at level three (and it sounds like you are too), but by level seven or eight I will have maxed Nethertoxin, generally followed by corrosive skin.  I do it partially for the guaranteed last hits, but also for the kill potential.  Having maxed Nethertoxin means that a half-health enemy is taking double damage from your attacks early on. You only need a tiny speed advantage to catch and kill any other hero at that point. It also make your harass hurt a lot."
TrueDoTA2,3acdwu,rudolfs_padded_cell,8,Fri Jun 19 00:13:31 2015 UTC,"The issue here is that more that the only things nethertoxin does better than your other 2 skills is last hit creeps and smack towers. 2 Levels in nethertoxin is great for lasthitting and gives you a nice boost to hitting heroes that are low on health, but it's corrosive and poison attack that are actually going to get them there. When i see a viper struggling early in the game, it's nearly always because he's maxing toxin before another skill.  Your harass will hurt more if you just level up poison attack. 4-1-1-1 is totally reasonable if that's what you want. I usually go 1-1-3 but 1-2-2 and 2-2-1 are totally fine. As i mentioned, 1-1-4-2-3 is also totally fine, and I've used it effectively in my last 3 viper games.  Nethertoxin is great you've got an advantage, but its your other 2 skills that GIVE you that advantage, and for that reason they deserve more skill points early on.  That being said, i totally understand maxing nethertoxin second, usually after corrosive, although i myself tend to save it for last, as I find 4-1-4-2 vipers cause a lot of chaos in teamfights"
TrueDoTA2,3acdwu,Mezkh,2,Fri Jun 19 00:36:14 2015 UTC,"I'll have to try out maxing corrosive skin to see if it compares. It may also be about playstyle. If you're being very aggressive, neither poison attack nor corrosive skin will give you the same sort of lane presence or early damage potential.  Assuming your opponent spends most of their time around 50% HP (which should always be the case if they're laning against Viper), level 3 Nethertoxin gives 30 bonus physical damage per attack when harassing your opponent, while level 3 corrosive skin gives 80 magic damage over four seconds (60 after 25% reduction).  If you're passively farming in lane you'll generally be exchanging one hit at a time, and this makes corrosive skin the clear winner even before the slow and bonus resist it provides.  If you're being aggressive, however, you're more likely to be actively attacking the enemy hero.  Let's say that the enemy midlaner has 400 out of 700 health and 4 armour. You and them are both level 6, and you have only ring of aquila for damage. You can kill the enemy hero in only three attacks if you include the damage from both other skills with a 1-3-1-1 build (not counting your ult, which lets you kill them in two attacks).  A 1-1-3-1 build requires four to five attacks. Against casters this is worth it, but in lanes with high kill potential (like most mid matchups) the extra physical damage is a huge boost.  Like I said, though, I'll have to try out your build. Often these things work different in practice than on paper."
TrueDoTA2,3acdwu,Mezkh,2,Fri Jun 19 03:15:49 2015 UTC,"I don't agree that nether toxin gives you better laning potential than corrosive or poison attack.   I tend to wait for creeps to meet in the middle, and then stand on their cliff lobbing poison attacks at them at level 1. There's very little that most heroes can do about this. Then at level 2 i skill corrosive so that even if they try to challenge me, they end up with the corrosive debuff and take even more damage.   At level 3 i usually grab a value point in nethertoxin to make last hitting a little easier, and to punish them for sticking around at low health, but once you've got them sticking around at low health, you're in a pretty damned good spot as viper.  At level 4 a second point in nethertoxin can help you out quite a bit, as it makes you virtually undenyable, even if you're forced to back off and play mid like a normal person (usually they will be forced to rotate in support at some point during the lane, if you're just standing on the cliff attacking them and running them back under tower).  After the second point, however, the extra levels of corrosive (your best skill) or poison attack (to get them low enough for nethertoxin to kick in and continue to run them out of lane/kill them) I just find that after 2 points, nethertoxin becomes ""win more"" and your skill points are more worth it when spent ensuring that you can stay ahead (or get ahead, if things don't go as planned).  I say again, when i find a viper doing poorly, he always seems to have gone 1/4/1/1."
TrueDoTA2,3acdwu,wildtarget13,2,Fri Jun 19 05:13:58 2015 UTC,"Reading this back and forth I see two different opinions and I see /u/dorox1 as a more aggressive viper player and sounds like he is touching on aspect you're not really touching on is that viper is still a 600 ranged agility carry that can do a lot of physical damage.  The issue with maxing corrosive skin first is that it scales better with more hp and when you are less than 1k hp with 50% magic resist, it's really not beneficial, but you seem to be arguing that corrosive skin is the best and it does damage, which it does, but not reliably.  A lot of heroes don't even want to attack or cast on viper as it won't make a difference anyways, such as witch doctor and jakiro. If they do cast, they only kill themselves faster. Then some heroes can disable you without even triggering corrosive like lion and Oracle, then what good is your 4 points?  A viper in the mid lane is rarely suited to max corrosive, it's a very passive build. I do agree to max corrosive against tri lanes when you can expect a lot of heat, and I do think corrosive can be Situationally scaled early in the mid lane versus a qop, but I think it's the one point wonder, not nethertoxin.  The fact is corrosive skin gets better with the more hp you have, so unless you're on a heal intensive lineup it's not as valuable as you're making it out to be and makes viper kind of Medusa like, a very tanky low dps snake thing."
TrueDoTA2,3acdwu,wildtarget13,3,Fri Jun 19 18:20:41 2015 UTC,"First of all, viper is 575 range, 285 ms, 45 level 1 damage, 2.5 agi growth, which is not all that impressive as ranged agi heroes go.   Next, I would say that my viper is very aggressive, and i often use max corrosive in order to get away with very aggressive positioning that would be simply foolish with other builds. I simply don't agree that max corrosive is a passive build, it in fact allows you to really get up in people's faces early in the mid game, and even in lane. (standing on their cliff lobbing poison attacks at them behind 3 levels of corrosive is something few heroes will have an answer to)  It is true that if you play max corrosive viper like you would a regular range agi hero, it's pretty lackluster, but this is half the point i'm trying to make: viper is not a typical ranged agi hero. He is a dominant laner, and a mid-game tank that creates a lot of chaos even into the late game.  Getting full value out of a viper pick means taking advantage of your move and attack speed slows while tanking up to create chaos and give your team opportunities to make plays in fights."
TrueDoTA2,3acdwu,RampagingRagE,2,Fri Jun 19 20:03:13 2015 UTC,"There's something about viper that really meshes with my playstyle.

TrueDoTA2,3acdwu,SirTidehunterThe2nd,1 point,Fri Jun 19 20:23:42 2015 UTC,"Viper is such a pain in the ass hero to fight against for anyone in the under 2k MMR bracket, and probably the best hero to grind if you just want to shoot through that range.    He dominates lane, he's pretty good at securing his early farm, he dominates teamfights, he pushes towers, he builds items to help the team, he tanks for the team, it's super hard to judge if you have the ability to fight him or not (almost always no) he destroys out of position players (everyone), he can manmode up on every hero and even win 1v2s and 1v3s with an advantage. Basically does it all in that bracket.    People lack the skills to lane against him, judge whether they can take him in a fight or not, get caught out by his perma slows and don't carry blinks, tps, etc.    That's without any synergy at all, but god help the other team if you have any allies like Drow Ranger/Luna/Venge, buffers like Omni/Abbadon/Treant/Lich/Dazzle...    Drow makes Viper a lunatic hero."
TrueDoTA2,3acdwu,SirTidehunterThe2nd,2,Fri Jun 19 02:38:07 2015 UTC,"Honestly i think viper's ability to dominate lanes goes quite far up the ladder, even into the competitive scene.   Most pro teams don't like viper a ton right now (some do) and that's not because he can't win lanes 1v1 (i don't think viper really has any truly bad matchups 1v1) but more that he has trouble recovering if the enemy commits several heroes to shutting him down (unlike an SF or storm, for instance, who can easily catch up by blowing up stacks with their nukes)  The tendency for mid to be ganked rather than to be the one doing the ganking in the pro scene seems, to me, to be the primary reason he seems to fall off at the very tip top levels of play. I don't believe that it's because people at some skill level develop magical ways of dealing with this VERY strong laning hero 1v1.  Thanks for the read and comment, i hope you enjoyed the piece!"
TrueDoTA2,3acdwu,dorox1,2,Fri Jun 19 02:43:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah it was a good read, thanks man.    Yes at higher levels players understand his gameplan and while he is strong at executing that gameplan, he's really not flexible to adapt at ALL and he has a lot of holes that get exploited. He needs to secure his lane farm to tank up effectively, but he has no flashfarm, he doesn't go late, he is a very immobile hero, he has no interrupt or stun, he has no way to effectively prevent blinks, (his attack projectile and ult projectile are slow and allow too much reaction time), and the ult can be item countered eventually. If he stops getting items timely he just falls off a cliff.  That said I think he has a great place in pubby CM games. The hero has almost zero mystery in how he plays BUT he's effective early and you can throw him into almost any laning situation including Aggro Tri; so he's great as an early pick, doesn't give much away, works well with a lot of heroes, works well against a lot of heroes and it's often counter-productive to try and 'counter' this hero in the draft.    Mid's actually not that great for him I feel, he lacks lane control, no one is going to give you a food melee matchup like Tiny or Ember, and other mids will get enough out of the lane against him and maybe even spam him out with nukes. And yeah he can get 2v1ed early in many situations.    But he can be annoying as hell in the sidelanes."
TrueDoTA2,3acdwu,junibo,1 point,Fri Jun 19 03:30:07 2015 UTC,"I agree that viper is very good in (both) sideleanes, especially in a dual lane. However, i think that very few single heroes can deal with a level 1 viper standing on top of their cliff lobbing poison attacks at them, then hitting 2 and skilling corrosive skin.  The problem with the hero, like you pointed out, is that he can get shut down, due to his immobility, by rotations and 2v1 situations. (although with 2 levels of nethertoxin he can deal with some 2v1s ok)  With max corrosive he can farm the jungle very easily, so it's not as if he NEEDS to get kills to be a factor, he can play the farm game if he needs to, it's just that he must have a decent or better lane or he becomes very difficult to make an impact with. In pub CM, where no one ganks mid, or uses the (very good and criminally underused) 2-2-1 lane setup, he will nearly always have a good lane, and therefore, will be very effective against all but a handful of heroes (pl and lycan deal with him pretty well, outside of that he's gonna be a real nuisance.)   It is useful to note, however, that viper is very strong in both aggro dual, to pressure their farmer, and safelane dual, (if you've got a carry mid, like sf or ember) to shut down a strong offlaner like tide, bb, or axe."
TrueDoTA2,3acdwu,Harlequeens,1 point,Fri Jun 19 05:21:16 2015 UTC,"I'm not gonna lie, I've been forgetting about aghs on this hero. I know it's super good, but it requires you get an item that let's you viperstrike 2-3 times and I'm not sure about viper's mana issues, although I find it easy to solve.  I've been trying to find a way to fit in deso to this hero for the early game ending power and mid game power spike, not to mention it helps get  things into nether toxin range (what doesn't?)  But I think a really cool build on viper is a very interesting build of dominator+solar crest. It gives you the minues armor of a deso and the lifesteal transition power, not to mention the versatility of dominator creeps, scouting, and stacking.  Most importantly, viper is anti kite. If you have an Aghs, you might not have the movespeed to walk up to people and stay on them. He actually does nothing versus heroes with escapes and sometimes getting an orchid in addition to blink/shadowblade can sometimes be necessary, especially if you get counter picked after a first pick viper."
TrueDoTA2,3acdwu,Harlequeens,2,Fri Jun 19 02:52:24 2015 UTC,"Viper's mana issues are solved by getting an item with a point booster and a +10 int staff in it. The 900 range on his ult is the reason you get it, it makes viper essentially unkitable, from being very easy to kite. 1st overall pick viper has its weaknesses but you're unlikely to end up in an unfavorable mid matchup. I usually like to put him in the second or third slot in my draft, however.  What he does against heroes with escapes is force them to use their escapes and then sit around until they come back off cooldown while he farms, and then, in teamfights, it doesn't matter if you have an escape, you still can't deal with this viper standing in front of you lobbing poison attacks and viper strikes everywhere, and being tank as hell."
TrueDoTA2,3acdwu,Spuuky,1 point,Fri Jun 19 05:12:53 2015 UTC,"I don't know the numbers, but my guess would be that viper still have mana issues that he hasn't solved. If you get aghs to get 2-3 viper strikes off in a teamfight plus keeping posion attack up on people, you're gonna be low on mana and have no mana regen items.   If you're getting only 1-2 viper strikes off, the aghs is kind of only for the range increase at that point. Cooldown too though, but cd doesn't matter if you don't get multiple ones off.  In a draft, I wouldn't care if they counter pick viper. He's not an important core pick to protect.   And about the escape thing, I saw Arteezy playing antimage creep skipping behind t2 towers versus admiral bulldog's viper today. Viper also won't solve the lockdown issues usually, I even would rarely orchid and viper can't get abyssal. Diffusal honestly would be a good answer even."

But game is kinda balanced around all these little differences so changing it now might upset the balance.  Though, in pro play, pretty much no one uses the magic bush because it is extremely easy to deward. In lower skill brackets, it doesn't matter that much.  IMO actual problem is the spawn box of radiant pull camp. It is weirdly (and imo unnecessarily) big, and it is not that uncommon radiant supports to waste 2 sentries to deward it. One sentry doesn't cover the whole spawn box. Compared to dire pull camp, one sentry (just below the treeline, above the ramp going to rune) covers pretty much all of it. This gives dire a bigger advantage.  But considering the other advantages radiant have, it might be something dire needs to have.  Still I support streamlining all the spawn boxes (making them sensible) though, sure it would decrease skill cap but, is it always a bad thing?"

I mean nobody would suggest putting this mechanic to balance dagger, or make its usage harder, if it didn't exist in the first place. People just don't want to let it go though.  Complex rules make complex games, but not necessarily better games.  I also love to remind people who opposes to these kind of changes, back then corpses blocked neutral camp stacking too, so you couldn't kill camps later then x:47 (or was it 37, I don't remember clearly)mark. I quit playing dota in 2008 because college, later I came back to dota 2 and it was such a joy finding out it was gone. It was an annoying mechanic. Increased the skill cap though."
TrueDoTA2,3add94,Aesyn,3,Fri Jun 19 08:26:49 2015 UTC,"Generally speaking, dire jungle is easier to deward. Radiant jungle is better in the sense it's harder to disrupt pulls, and you can pull a third camp if you want to.   They both have their advantages and disadvantages and it's always been like that. One thing to note also is that even though that one spot in the dire jungle manages to find almost every ward, there's one spot that's pretty hard to find which the ""magic"" sentry in the dire jungle won't find."
TrueDoTA2,3add94,Apathy_is_Death,1 point,Fri Jun 19 09:51:39 2015 UTC,where is this magic sentry spot?
TrueDoTA2,3add94,ferret_80,2,Fri Jun 19 21:33:10 2015 UTC,"ward spot  Almost nobody knows of this ward, it doesn't get found by the OP dire ward which most of the time means enemy supports spend their time looking around the back, eating trees etc.  There's also a tricky obs placement on the right if you place it in the spot where the trees cover it, but sentry still reveals it. You do have to eat a tree to get to it though.  In any case, you have to place this ward precisely else it gets revealed by perfect placement of the dire sentry ward, or you just won't block if you don't place it correctly. Afaik there's only that one pixel where it will block camp/not get revealed by perfect dire sentry placement.  edit: ughh sorry, i missread what you wanted to ask. here's a picture i found on google. dire sentry ward  The one on the left is the most common dire sentry placement, as it will always reveal any ward blocking the  camp except the one I described. That's also the reason most people simply don't block the easy camp anymore and just place their observer for vision somewhere between the easy and hard camp. The spot on the right where the sentry is placed, is usually used for blocking the camp, but the sentry on the left reveals it."
TrueDoTA2,3acsa4,EDDE12345678,8,Fri Jun 19 01:37:40 2015 UTC,Alternatively you can just pick another hero if you want to play the ratting game? Like meepo or furion for instance.. They don't nearly require as much money as jug to be able to rat and get away safely
TrueDoTA2,3acsa4,shockkk,3,Fri Jun 19 02:44:25 2015 UTC,"It's more for the pretty much flawless game you can have if the enemy doesn't have spell immunity and doesn't have any traditional anti-rat gankers like storm, riki, spectre.  I've done this at least twice or more on legion commander when the enemy team started 5 manning to avoid duels. The damage item is irrelevant, although battlefury/maelstrom is the best for wave clear unless your hero has natural spell waveclear. Linkens+BKB and you just split push and hit towers, it's kind of a ratting test. It's an option if the enemy is trying to hit strong team fights to have a split push available build."
TrueDoTA2,3acsa4,wildtarget13,2,Fri Jun 19 02:59:14 2015 UTC,"First of all, i think MoM Jugger is still the go to build on jugger right now (the pros seem to disagree, and many of them are rushing yasha instead, but i attribute this to the typical flight that the pros take from anything that gets nerfed)  One of the things that MoM does, just by itself, is allow you to split a bit. Soul Ring can also be very good for this purpose as it allows you to be able to afford to spin down a double creep wave and really push things out, or even throw a healing ward down the lane to make a push just a little bit stronger. (For those of you who don't know, soul ring can put you over your max mana, and allows you to freecast spells even when at full, therefore keeping a full mana pool for spin ult. It also allows you to soulring -> healing ward for a 0 mana full heal, to offset the life cost)  After MoM/soulring/phase is done, i usually like to either sprint right for aghs, or stop for a 2-3k farmish item if i'm intending to take the game late (or bfury if i'm against pl or naga) and then go back for aghs (aghs allows you to have your ult nearly all the time, because of the CD reduction, and also is amazing with MoM, as the attack speed gives you more attacks during omni, while you're invulnerable, and so don't care about the +damage taken.)  It never really occurred to me that this farming item could be BoTs, but there's no real reason it couldn't be. If you find yourself in a situation where you need and have the ability to be splitting, BoTs seems like a fine option.  That being said, i think the ""Split Forever"" idea for jugger is a pretty bad one. The hero excels primarily at killing heroes and at some point an aghs ought to be in the works. MoM/BoT -> Aghs does sound like a good idea, but if you find yourself in a situation where you need to rat out an entire game of dota, you've likely drafted yourself into a corner, and linken's is probably not a good option. I'd say in that (very narrow and rather desperate) situation, AC is probably better.  Wow, i seem to have a lot to say about jugger, think i should do an ""A Thought"" article on him?"
TrueDoTA2,3acsa4,goblinbiddin,3,Fri Jun 19 03:05:53 2015 UTC,going MoM is risky because alot of popular heroes this patch are very burst damage based either forcing you to spin or ulti. yasha gives nearly just as much move speed without the downside of the huge damage hike especially considering how rubbish juggernauts strength stats are. its still strong in pubs but not like before. i would also swap out that soul ring for an aquilla that item is just too good to miss out on just about any agi carry
TrueDoTA2,3acsa4,-Number5,2,Fri Jun 19 03:35:08 2015 UTC,"The upside of MoM is that it lets you farm faster and makes you VERY scary during ultimate, especially after you finish aghs. I do understand the yasha build, and I've used it myself before, but i think the farming speed you get from activating MoM and blowing down creep waves just makes it an overall better choice.  It is certainly true that MoM can kill you if you use it at a bad time, and you always have to watch out for that as a jugger player.  Aquila is a good item, but i don't think it replaces soul ring. Many people do not run soul ring but i think the ability to use your skills without worrying about having no mana when a fight breaks out is just amazing, in combination with the fact that soul ring -> healing ward full heals you for no mana. If you want to go aquila, go aquila, but that doesn't mean you can't also get a soul ring, value items are very good this patch.  I definitely agree phase aquila yasha is totally fine, tho."

TrueDoTA2,3acsa4,unr4v3l,1 point,Fri Jun 19 13:54:51 2015 UTC,you dont have to manfight someone to burst them down. and the MoM build is based around going only 1 point in spin most times just for the magic immunity disengage or spell dodge
TrueDoTA2,3acsa4,-Number5,1 point,Fri Jun 19 13:58:26 2015 UTC,"Imo the spin needs to be maxed asap because it gives you exponential damage especially in early lvs (140x5=700 damage, -25% magic resistance => 525 damage after reduction), not to mention decrease cd from 42 to 18s is so huge, and 140 to 90 mana cost is always a positive trait as Jugg is mana starving. Definitely worth more than 25% to 35 % crit or healing ward or stats.  And because Jugg will start to lack damage output once he has to fight in teamfight when he used his ult and the enemies not dying, max damage spin and manta + basher are needed. People often underestimate how hurtful my spin is, then they die to it."
TrueDoTA2,3acsa4,unr4v3l,1 point,Fri Jun 19 14:16:55 2015 UTC,it down to playstyle really. going the spin build directs you to a more early to mid game teamfight based jugg. while going the stats or crit build makes you a faster farmer and hit pretty hard which in the end is what you generally want from your position 1 carry. its just a preference thing.

It is just too important to have a strong lane and an advantage early in the game, post rubber banding nerfs. That being said, MoM is still a good farm accelerator to get you towards your aghs, or bfury, or sny, or whatever it is you decide you need (I think skipping aghs altogether is very silly, if only just for the cooldown reduction, however)"
TrueDoTA2,3acsa4,goblinbiddin,1 point,Sat Jun 20 06:38:59 2015 UTC,"the crit build definately isnt dead. from what ive experimented with so far its a case of identifying what role your team requires from you. do they need a heavily farmed right clicker? or a space creating spinning god? and then the item choices are really open atm. going MoM is still really strong but it isnt as game winning as it was in 6.83. i feel like the nerfs to jugg have meant that you need to be aware of your choices to win games now instead of always going down that phase, mask build  EDIT: i will state though it may be better going 2 points in spin now if your going stats or crit builds as ive definitely noticed the cooldown increase on spin hurting my ability to re engage into some fights"
TrueDoTA2,3acsa4,-Number5,1 point,Sat Jun 20 14:33:52 2015 UTC,"I think jugger is a wasted pick, in this patch, if he's not gonna be a strong laner, and the crit build is very weak in lane. He just doesn't have the overpowering late game he used to, and to top it all off, the rubber banding nerfs make it harder to get into the late game without interacting, which is what the crit build wants to do, just get MoM, and jungle until you're the richest thing on the map."
TrueDoTA2,3acsa4,goblinbiddin,1 point,Sat Jun 20 19:32:06 2015 UTC,he never had an overpowering late game he was and still is about early aggression. he was never a hero who massively benefited from rubber banding anyway and you win games with him by being hyper aggressive and taking advantage of his ability to guarantee a kill if you catch someone with omni up. nothing about the spin build massively hikes his laning up massively compared to the crit build juggs still a strong laner either way you go for a melee hero. the heroes still a strong pub hero you just need to know his strenghts more
TrueDoTA2,3acsa4,-Number5,2,Sat Jun 20 21:42:00 2015 UTC,"All pure late game carries benefited from the rubber banding effect because you could afford to get behind early, as a simple kill or two would put a huge dent in the net worth gap.  Jugger's low BAT was a big part of his late game, and i would argue that an aghs MoM bkb jugger with a few other random damage items thrown in was very strong in the late game in 83, and that's what the crit build was useful for.  Jugger with max spin gives him serious kill potential in lane, rather than just threatening to run you off. Crit build juggers aren't going to kill you in lane except if they isolate you with ult.  I absolutely think jugger is still strong; even with the nerfs to spin, healing ward, his BAT, and MoM. He is, in fact, still my go to carry pick in cm, when I think ""I know i want to pick my safelane carry with this pick, but i have much info on which carry i want""  With max spin, he goes from a guy who can really help run the offlaner out, especially with phases, to a hero that can allow your team to run 2-1-2 lanes without fear of getting punished, and who is nearly impossible to go aggro tri against, if he has at least 1 good laning support. He can also allow you to run, say, an enigma, without fear of losing control of your jungle (even against an aggro tri, although in this case, he will likely struggle for farm early)  Weird Thing  Soul ring (very unpopular item, but it has its place on this hero) is also a very nice pickup on max spin juggers, especially 4-2-0-1 juggers (level 1 healing ward is pretty meh post nerf, note that you should end up 4-2-3-2 at 11 if you do go this build) because not only can you use soul ring to get your ult off after spin, when not on full mana, you can also use it to throw out a healing ward for free, which then heals the 150 health you paid for the soul ring, and, in fact, puts you to full even if the soul ring use dropped you to 1 health. (watch it against invis heroes tho.)  Note that if you go for a soul ring, you can and should use the soul ring to bring you above your max mana before casting and stay at full mana all the time for spin + ult.  In addition, if you get a soul ring and a stout or PMS you can take out a 4x or more stacked hard camp at level 5 by pulling the creeps out, then soul ring, healing ward, spin, back off when spin finishes, wait for soul ring, soul ring spin. This can help you cath up if you have a hard time in lane. (2v3 lane, you forgot to ban dirge, you ran him aggro dual, etc) It can also be a good way of taking advantage of the play of supports who rotate and stack for you after the lane is won. (if they put all that effort in for us, we should at least repay them by taking the farm, right?)  Summation  Basically i think the max spin build takes jugger from a good melee laner to an overpowering melee laner with kill potential, and I don't think it has a serious negative impact on your late game, as MoM/Phase/Stout still lets you jungle very easily even with no levels in crit. (and we'll have crit maxed by 12 anyway)  It also allows you to TP rotate to very early fights before you start getting your items up, as the low cooldown high damage spin at 10-14 minutes remains highly effective, and healing ward after the fight is over will nearly always result in objectives."
TrueDoTA2,3acsa4,goblinbiddin,2,Sat Jun 20 23:05:50 2015 UTC,"Hey Im a big fan of that Juggy strat. As Jugger picker I rat a lot. However I only need MoM and tp scroll to start doing it. No need to pick up BoT or Linken because they delay my timing of important items like Manta and Basher. Manta is here to dodge debuff, manfight enemies, and Basher is needed to lockdown enemies because Jugg doesnt have good chasing ability.  Actually this build falls off when their carry have basher/abyssal. You can't rat alone anymore. But the objective is to rack up gold for your team and get closer to manta & basher. You don't rat as Jugg all times unless you know your team sucks at teamfight and the only hope is splitpush.  To sum up my thought of playing 6.84 Jugg:   skill build: 1 on each spin, ward, crit (spin to escape, ward for lane sustainability, crit to trade hits), then max spin. Reason for maxing spin: http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueDoTA2/comments/3acsa4/how_viable_is_a_mom_bot_and_linkins_sphere/csbuw5t . After spin lv4 I level stats and ult whenever possible. After I get some hp items/damage items I start to level crit because now I know my crit will hurt. Item choice: starting item => Aquila (or Ring of Basilius) => Phase => MoM (and maybe Drum/Bracer if I see enemies having a lot of nukes, but if you play safe you can skip this item as you get hp via stats or Ultimate orb from Manta later) => Manta => Basher => Abyssal => whatever. Aquila/Basilius is for the aura mana regen. Phase + MoM to speed up farming/jungle/fast splitpushing. Manta because I need to teamfight later, also great to debuff silence. Basher to lockdown enemies because Jugg is bad at chasing. Abyssal shares the same reasoning, and synergy with your crit. Decision making: usually after Phase + MoM I go jungle to let my support farm (is that the reason the support players in my team usually have their core item online fast? :) ). Then try to splitpushing as hard a possible. If they send 1 hero back to defend their tower just ult + spin him to death. If they 2 man tp then back off. Farm their jungle, if you find any solo hero there, kill him. Then proceed to teamfight as 5v4. Flaws: can't split push vs magic immunity piercing ability like Magnus's ult, Enigma's ult, anyone with Basher, can't win if team overfeed etc. But in general the strat is pretty solid and I really like it. Special mention vs illusion heroes: I have to get Mjollnir online asap. This delays my hp item (Manta) by a little bit but it speeds up my farming speed even further. In teamfight put Static charge on the guy who is getting focused by the illusion hero player, or put it on yourself if you are the one tanking."

And from there, you should get items that allow you to survive an initial stun/silence. Survivability, because few things cancel spin TP or can kill you through spin early. Things like HP, armor, and evasion will keep you alive during spin.  I think a maelstrom would be a more traditional split pushing item on untraditional heroes. Merlini does travels into radiance and maxes spin and stats I believe.  I think blink could be really good here too if they do have things to kill you through BKB, but no flying vision and blinks.

For example, Furion can splitpush, but he is also very good to set up early ganks and he can join fights all the time (and he doesnt need BOTs+ any creeps to TP to). Every good carry ""rats"" to some extent when its appropriate. There are a lot of heroes that can do it better and safer than Jugg. Especially in this meta, you need to be able to fight early. Spending 7625 gold on items that do not improve Jugg's fighting capabilities is super fucking horrible. I am not even speaking about competitive, any high tier pub will completely destroy your team as soon as they see that you are running around with a MOM + nothing.   The fact that your splitpush is not worth 7.5k gold is just half the problem. the other half is that even linkens, bots and blade fury doesnt let you rat safely. Orchid is a very popular pub item and your build has no way of dispelling it. You will have about 20 minutes of farm (maybe) before the mid storm/queen jump on you, orchid and kill you before you can say ""rat dota"". In addition to orchid, you are also countered by enigma, void, troll, slardar, any hero with major physical burst (like ursa), any hero that can buy a basher/mkb and any 2 heroes that have disables that pierce majic immunity (one pierces linken's, the other disables you)"

You're basically being limited only by your micro. Double eblades/abyssals/hex gives you everything you need to counter most heroes.   That said LD's strength mainly lies in the early to mid game, depending on what you want to accomplish. He is great in some early pushing lineups or just as a rat. ~40-45min bear with ac/deso/scepter is really annoying to play against for example."

TrueDoTA2,3ac896,yitzaklr,6,Thu Jun 18 22:40:17 2015 UTC,"You're kind of approaching this from the wrong direction. When there's a tank, many people instantly think ""he's tanky, how can we kill him?"" That's not a winning way to think.  A better thing to consider would be ""He's tanky, how do we NOT kill him till later, and get away with it""  So, although niax can take a decent bite out of heroes with big health pools thanks to feast, heroes like viper and OD are actually more effective at dealing with them. Banishing or slowing a tank can give you enough time to deal with his team while ignoring him, and kiting him around.  For supports, if you're worried about a tank, SD disruption and bane nightmare are great ways to remove him from the fight so you can kill off his allies.  As far as cores go, mobility goes a long way, as you can often blink/hook past them and blow up their supports before they can manage to accomplish much of anything. Clock is a great hero for dealing with (other) tanks, because he can throw down cogs that separate the tank from his team, and allow your team to kill the squishy ones first, before the tank even gets into the action.  Also, lockdown isn't only good against squishy heroes! A good ravage will lock down the tank and the supports he's protecting, allowing you and your team to run in and kill them off.  If you're already in a game and someone becomes really difficult to kill, eul's is a great item for dealing with tanks, as it removes them from the fight temporarily (just like disruption)  The idea is, if a hero is going tank, he wants to be focused. Do everything you can not to give him what he wants."
TrueDoTA2,3ac896,goblinbiddin,5,Fri Jun 19 05:54:46 2015 UTC,"Shadow Demon easily the best. Soul Catcher even makes a Bristleback soft and squishy, and it ignores typical tank item like Lotus Orb, and the rest of his kit isn't bad at handling them either.    Then you have Vengeful Spirit good, A medallion/Solar crest combo with Wave of Terror and your Aura you amp up right clicks to extreme levels.    Enigma, Witchdoctor and Wyvern have % based effects, can be varyingly effective. Allowing Magic resist on Arctic Burn really hurt Wyvern here. Midnight pulse is very strong if you can keep them in it."
TrueDoTA2,3ac896,Mezkh,1 point,Fri Jun 19 02:59:59 2015 UTC,"It depends on the hero you want to deal with.  The general way to deal with tanks though involves your carry beating the shit out of them or your position 3 being able to effectively deal with them.   Heroes like Timbersaw and Tidehunter are strong versus other tanky heroes. However, it's usually your cores like TA who can deal with the tankier heroes effectively after purchasing a desolator.  However there is no general rule for dealing with tank heroes. It depends on what makes them tanky. High armor heroes need someone to have either desolator or a lot of nuke damage to take them out.  High strength heroes need to be dealt with by %hp damage or by Timbersaw (who lowers their strength). Excess burst damage can help deal with them though.  Heroes like Bristleback or Necrophos become very weak when silenced.   You have to counter the individual hero, basically."
TrueDoTA2,3ac896,Ishmael_KingOfTheSea,1 point,Thu Jun 18 22:48:24 2015 UTC,"I pretty much agree. When I have a late pick support, I look at the rest of my team and work out if I am going to have to provide control or damage if I see something annoying like a Bristleback or other tanky irritation.  Support Lina (with Aghs) does HUGE burst damage and a chunk of it is pure. So that is really good. If I have a team full of right clickers then amp damage like Shadow Demon or Witchdoctors Maledict. You will see pros big up WD against tanky heroes often for this reason. I like WW for the %damage of Arctic Burn and the follow up Winter's Curse and I often build Solar Crest on her anyway. Few heroes no matter how tanky can survive that.  If they go greedy, consider Enigma - midnight pulse + blackhole = almost anything will be very low and the rest of your team can mop up.  In terms of Core roles. QoP and Lesh - they are both a little OP right now and put out MASSIVE damage. QoP in the form of Pure damage ulti and Lesh in lightning spam + ulti + split earth + demonic edict.  Honourable Mention: Outworld Devourer. Against low INT heroes (aka most ""tanks"" his ulti will obliterate them, Even more so with Aghs and his orb does pure damage and lots of it. Armour will be nearly useless. DK - does not like OD"

TrueDoTA2,3abunf,TheDaltonXP,5,Thu Jun 18 20:55:59 2015 UTC,"He's succeptible to hard counters and the way he is played he tends to come online too late with the focus on earlier fighting.  At least for traditional builds which focus on BoTs, Bfury, and Daed.   He also has a fairly high skill cap and high skill floor/ceiling heroes always have low win rates.   People have been experimenting with more midgame oriented builds to shore up his fighting ability, e.g. Drums + Treads early.  Some in pro some otherwise with varying success."
TrueDoTA2,3abunf,Drop_,1 point,Thu Jun 18 21:01:34 2015 UTC,"People have been experimenting with more midgame oriented builds to shore up his fighting ability, e.g. Drums + Treads early. Some in pro some otherwise with varying success.   This was actually the traditional way of playing him before people went to greedy late-game builds like the one you mention above, though most of the time people go phase boots instead of treads since chasing with Flame Guard is important early on.  You'd usually send him to a solo lane and go for aquila, bottle, and drums for a large, gold-efficient boost to stats.  The stats help you fight early, before you have enough levels to just sit back and spam SoF, and you turn your early-game powerhouse with Flame Guard+Searing Chains into kills on supports and outer towers, then farm your first Bfury->Buriza (or just Bfury->Bfury I guess, but I feel like the Buriza path is more effective) and then start pushing high ground with SoF spam.  SoF spam is also extremely good at defending high ground.  In fact, past 35-40 mins, I'd say Xin is one of the absolute best high ground defense heroes in the game - your team almost can't avoid bunching up and your supports simply cannot afford to eat a cleaved Sleight of Fist hit, not on top of everything else Xin's team will be throwing at you.  He's actually very well suited to the current style of gameplay because he's a hero with an extremely strong early game and works very well against nuke-heavy heroes like QoP and Lina/Lesh.  He can actually beat QoP in lane fairly easily since Flame Guard will completely negate dagger damage and forces QoP to back off, and once he has lvl 6, QoP is quite simply dead if she isn't very careful with where she blinks to.  I really like playing Xin, he's a very fun hero to play and rewards skill heavily (and also punishes poor play heavily, which makes him great for making it abundantly clear when you're playing like shit.)"
TrueDoTA2,3abunf,Thalnagath,0,Thu Jun 18 23:35:56 2015 UTC,I do see the big mids of this patch being a nightmare for him. A QoP or lesh makes me sad just thinking about it.  I do understand the high skill cap. I feel like he can be played decently fairly easy but doesn't really shine without skill.  I am somewhat surprised he comes on late with the strength of flameguard and his usefulness setting up ganks with chains. Tho of course that sounds like something that would need strong team coordination
TrueDoTA2,3abunf,Thalnagath,1 point,Thu Jun 18 22:11:55 2015 UTC,"A QoP or lesh makes me sad just thinking about it.   Xin will trade well with both of those heroes.  He will straight up kill them the second he hits level 6 unless they both play extremely defensive.  He's very much like his cousin in that he sees an enormous boost to kill potential once he gets level 6.  Unlike his cousin, however, he also has a pretty sizable amount of kill potential even before level 6, especially if he gets boots before his opposite number gets boots."
TrueDoTA2,3abunf,Thalnagath,2,Thu Jun 18 23:36:44 2015 UTC,I figured their harass would be a pain. I haven't actually played the match up so now I am curious
TrueDoTA2,3abunf,subraizada3_,1 point,Fri Jun 19 00:59:10 2015 UTC,"It depends heavily on proper use of Flame Guard and you'll definitely need a PMS and ideally fast boots.  If they try to harass you, you can just Flame Guard and run at them and there's nothing they can do about it, they'll lose if they try to trade hits vs hits+burn and if you have boots first, they can't kite.  Lesh is less certain since he has that insane 320ms but he also lacks a blink, so if you get chains on him, he dies.  They'll probably be ahead until lvl 6, but once Xin has lvl 6, they're free kills unless they play very defensively.  If Xin gets haste, regen, or double damage, they're free kills and even the tower won't save them."
TrueDoTA2,3abunf,Thalnagath,2,Fri Jun 19 01:09:11 2015 UTC,"he also lacks a blink, so if you get chains on him, he dies.   Pretty sure QoP/AM Blink is disabled by Chains, as is Blink Dagger."

Once you hit flame guard level 3 she literally can't cancel your flame guard anymore instantaneously before which she could use scream+sonic wave to just erase your flame guard.  Now you have a 7 second window after the first scream to fight into her, in which if she blinks and you have lv6, she's dead.   Just make sure you keep your hp constantly up so the 290 pure burst won't threaten you that much, because you probably will have to dive the t1/deal with a support rotation to get to her after her blink."

Traditional Lesh builds usually took a value point in stun and took lightning and edict as primary skills.

It takes pros a lot of time and energy to repeatedly scrim and test heroes and drafts involving those heroes (and that's just one way of playing the hero... most heroes have multiple methods of play!), so what happens is they latch onto a set of favorites after a new patch and then obsessively use and play those heroes - and copy each other using and playing those heroes - even if those heroes aren't objectively ""the best.""  Troll, Sniper, and Juggy were all dropped like bricks the second 6.84 hit, even though all three of them received fairly minor nerfs and are all still quite potent at what they did in 6.83.

Additionally, it's hard to know what to do. I see many embers get destroyed by silencers because they do not play properly versus that hero. Similarly with legion commander/faceless void. It's not that hard, but it definitely takes practice. I see this reflected in item builds.  The hero is very prone to counters and it reflects in proper item decisions. Going straight damage versus a PA isn't going to work. This is when DESO INTO AC is the build, finishing off six slot with mkb into battlefury or butterfly or bkb or whatever you need. But people will build linkens and Skadi and bkb into PA and those are all wrong and are gonna get you 1 shot come mid to late game pushing high grounds.

TrueDoTA2,3abunf,Conpen,1 point,Fri Jun 19 21:13:50 2015 UTC,"Hmm while it is an interesting idea, I disagree for a couple reasons.  Lotus orb is a statless item with +10 damage from perseverance. The armor is helpful and mana regen is nice, but when it comes to using sleight of fist, hugely underwhelming. This item is meant for supports that doesn't need to scale their right click. I agree having a lotus orb on a support with an ember spirit on the team can be helpful if not vital but otherwise should not be built on ember themself.  Similarly a veil of discord would be helpful to ember spirit since his early game damage is all magical. It would actually buff him damage quite a bit, but because it doesn't synergize with sleight well, I wouldn't build it unless I'm trying to school some scrublords.  As for manta not being useful for the illusions, you must also consider the disjoint and dispel. Lotus orb is a dispel, but not a disjoint. Sure being able to reflect spells is nice, but it doesn't help you from getting stunned yourself.  Additionally using manta style interrupts cast times and attack animations giving your hero added mobility which lotus does not offer.  As far as diffusal is concerned I think it's great with a manta as it provides more agility for illusions, mana burn on everything, an additional dispel and an offensive purge, but it does not replace a manta. Diffusal is always good in almost every game on any hero given the situation and need for it."
TrueDoTA2,3abunf,lolfail9001,1 point,Fri Jun 19 23:59:01 2015 UTC,"Actually in this patch I have seen some russian pros pubstomping with Ember Spirit like: Bottle => Phase boot => Drum => Desolator => whatever else  And contrary to the popular belief that this hero should farm until he gets Battlefury, that's wrong. You should go gank once you hit 6 because your Flameguard burns so hard."
TrueDoTA2,3abunf,BaRKy1911,2,Thu Jun 18 21:49:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I don't know where people got the idea that he should afk farm from.  Xin has an extremely strong early game (up to about 20-25 mins), a weak mid game (from about 20-30/25-35 mins), and a fucking insane late game (everything from 30/35 mins on.)  You must be aggressive early.  You need to pick off supports and cores, take Roshan for your team, take those outer towers, farm the enemy jungle, control the map.  You must do this because once enemies stop dying instantly to ult->chains->burn->chains damage, they're going to tank through your damage and then flatten you (this usually means supports survived to get their stats/survival items, cores got BKB, etc), and without Bfury+Buriza or Bfury+Bfury, your SoF damage simply isn't gonna be there to cover.  The idea is you keep the enemy on the back foot with your powerhouse early game and then while they're trying to catch up - to get those BKBs, Meka, value bracers, whatever they need to survive your damage - you're farming up the items you need to transition into SoF being your main damage source.  If you can't do this, Xin is very likely to become a liability for his team.  Pubs tend to simply not have the coordination required to do this, hence his awful win rate."

TrueDoTA2,3abunf,Thalnagath,1 point,Thu Jun 18 23:55:56 2015 UTC,"Contrary to my opinion on new and improved Deso... no.  SoF goes from being an annoying nuisance to be an AOE killing spell because of how cleave works with it.  You definitely want a Bfury before anything else, after your initial stats items.  You could maybe make a case for Deso instead of Buriza after your first Bfury - every target hit loses 7 armor, which could work well if combined with another physical damage source on your team - but from a personal DPS standpoint, Deso loses out to Buriza.  Of course, Deso is also about 2000 gold cheaper than Buriza.  You could try Deso+Crystalys if you wanted - roughly similar cost to Buriza, probably more gold-efficient, gives you more damage vs towers, gives your team effectively -7 armor on enemy heroes, but less slot efficient.  Haven't tried that.  If you try it, let us know how it went!"

TrueDoTA2,3aci3g,wildtarget13,3,Fri Jun 19 01:58:03 2015 UTC,"Why ain't he being used more?   His armor was nerfed. His strength was being able to safely farm a blink versus almost any lane. I've heard him being theory crafted as a safe pick versus viper and sf mid. Now with his armor and stout shield slight nerfs, it's just less reliable to get a blink by 8 minutes.   It also hurts that you can burst him before split a little easier. He also gives very little late game, especially the way people build him. If you get behind in any lane and they have a hero that is ahead of brew to the point where split cant' handle them, like BKBs or assassin orchid damage, it just makes him very much a burden.  Haze is good, and usually it is better to max as it helps your team more than yourself. But in many pub games, you get ganked and intially get stunned without getting haze off and your passive will save you more than your haze at this point. It also has offensive potential more than drunken haze, which is something to look at when you weigh which one to max first.  I haven't played panda this patch, and he used to be my favorite hero. Still arguably is, but I was never amazing at him, despite my easy wins.  The last game I palyed panda I first picked as usually and then 4 cores were picked.   I went tranquils soul into blink and it was painful, but playable. I went like blink force BKB, diffusal (situational I'd guess). Tranquil is cool because it solves your armor issues and you get a traqnuil boot off cd, with heals and high MS when you come out of split.  But arcanes into greaves seems good for removing silences. THe problem is timing at this point because you want blink too.   I also get soul ring most games because bottle doesn't solve his mana issues alone. it really isn't a waste of gold on him, it's better than wand and arcane boots is a harsher waste of gold i'd argue."

TrueDoTA2,3abqyw,immijimmi,5,Thu Jun 18 20:29:12 2015 UTC,"Although it's nice of you to help the support, realize that it's often more important for cores to get farm than supports. As clockwerk, it is often your job to control the tempo in the midgame. This is much harder to do without items. You lost out on at least 1345 gold by 24 minutes due to buying support items. If you are willing to go for arcanes and later guardian greaves, it would even be better for you to buy the mek. (You can't really buy the mek on CW otherwise since he's so mana constrained early on.)  Pipe is definitely not a good first item here. Leshrac and Veno do have a bunch of AoE damage, but a pipe simply costs too much and doesn't provide enough early benefit, especially if you aren't fighting Leshrac. On top of this, they are both supports and so will have trouble dishing out a lot of damage without dying.  The standard CW items, blademail and/or force staff, would have worked. They'll probably work in every game. I probably would have gotten both, with the blademail first. Realize that in the early/mid game, blademail helps you get kills and survive. If you are ganking with a blademail it is quite difficult for your opponent to kill you without dying first. Pipe, on the other hand, doesn't really do this for you.  Beyond those items, you probably could have gone into things like ghost scepter / aghanims / BKB depending on how the game is going.  I'm not a huge fan of arcanes on clockwerk. It's trickier, but you can manage your mana without it. Just keep tabs on your mana and keep yourself topped off. Getting a bottle helps with this. As for boots, I'm a fan of tranquils but phase boots are also pretty solid."
TrueDoTA2,3abqyw,vple,0,Thu Jun 18 20:50:45 2015 UTC,"If you are willing to go for arcanes and later guardian greaves, it would even be better for you to buy the mek.   The dazzle had already started on mek by the time I had enough money to be making item choices. Pipe's manacost necessitated getting some mana build, so I went for arcanes as the obvious choice.    Pipe is definitely not a good first item here. Leshrac and Veno do have a bunch of AoE damage, but a pipe simply costs too much and doesn't provide enough early benefit  The standard CW items, blademail and/or force staff, would have worked.   I honestly think the pipe was better in this game than a blademail would have been. What use is killing a veno after he's gotten all of his damage off? Similarly leshrac will have already dealt the majority of his damage once you kill him. Instead, I got pipe to stop all their damage from killing my teammates. I understand the ganking use of blademail, but i was in a team with a huskar. If I was to gank someone I would be with him."
TrueDoTA2,3abqyw,Ailodierap,2,Thu Jun 18 21:48:28 2015 UTC,"I honestly think the pipe was better in this game than a blademail would have been.    No offense man, but you came here for advice and every single person so far has said ""It was a mistake not to get an early Blademail"". It's a core item on Clock. It is much more likely that you are not understanding the correct way to use it, then it is that it is actually a bad pick-up. Used correctly you will be getting it off about two times in teamfights: once when you initiate, then the 2nd time when you go back in. Beyond that it ensures your early game ganks go correctly. Watch some recent Bulba or ixmike (probably better players out there too, but those guys know the hero) games where they play Clockwerk and you should see how key it is to the hero's playstyle."
TrueDoTA2,3abqyw,Ailodierap,1 point,Thu Jun 18 21:55:24 2015 UTC,"you came here for advice   Discussion too. The point of debate is to air the pros and cons of the subject.   It's a core item on Clock.   I understand that, and yes the comments on here say the same. There will be circumstances where it isn't the optimal choice though, and I thought this game was one of them. If I was wrong, fair enough, but I would like to understand the reasoning why as best I can."
TrueDoTA2,3abqyw,vple,3,Thu Jun 18 22:01:23 2015 UTC,"Well /u/vple already laid out a pretty great explanation:   Pipe is definitely not a good first item here. Leshrac and Veno do have a bunch of AoE damage, but a pipe simply costs too much and doesn't provide enough early benefit, especially if you aren't fighting Leshrac. On top of this, they are both supports and so will have trouble dishing out a lot of damage without dying.  Realize that in the early/mid game, blademail helps you get kills and survive. If you are ganking with a blademail it is quite difficult for your opponent to kill you without dying first. Pipe, on the other hand, doesn't really do this for you.   You should not pick Clockwerk to keep your allies alive, you should pick Clockwerk to disrupt the enemy, keep them afraid, and apply pressure. You're wasting early game, where Clock thrives, to farm an expensive Pipe, whereas a cheaper Blademail would've let you get off the ground much quicker.   You mention a few times that you had mana issues, which is why you picked up the Arcanes. Well first you had mana issues because you rushed a Pipe. Second, Blademail helps alleviate those mana issues. Beyond that Clock has very solid strength gain, but no armor at all, which means he folds pretty quickly versus physical damage which Blademail addresses. The early damage helps ensure early pick-offs. Blademail gives excellent survivability versus Leshrac's physical AOE, and completely counters PA/Clinkz if she tries to go on you. Pipe only helps against their 2 supports and the Spectre Radiance (which will be mid/late game).  Additionally Clock's positioning should be very aggressive, which means you will rarely be in a good position to Pipe your allies up- instead you'll often be in a position where items like Blademail allow you to exercise crowd control over the enemies and disrupt their plans.  Pipe is a great consideration in this game, but except in very poorly drafted teams, it should almost always be a 3rd+ major item pick-up, not rushed."
TrueDoTA2,3abqyw,sanitygod,7,Thu Jun 18 22:53:57 2015 UTC,"Some additional thoughts based on what's been said so far:  Sure, blademail is a bit less useful against Veno since he's a suicide bomber anyway. But no, Leshrac is not always going to get the majority of his damage off before dying. Everyone on your team except Dazzle can deal with the support Leshrac in a clash. More importantly, PA and Clinkz cannot hit you during your blademail. They'll sometimes kill you before you kill them, sure, but this should guarantee their death as your team follows up.   On top of this, you can't do anything against Clinkz if he finds you alone from 17-42 minutes (his orchid timing to your force timing) because pipe offers you nothing that Clinkz cares about. Force and blademail both allow you a chance of getting out.  You mention needing to gank with Huskar, but this is not true. As CW, you generally want to find 1-3 heroes and go in on that. If Huskar's with you great, but all your cores are capable of assisting in these fights, even if they don't go on the same target as you. As CW, you isolate heroes and disjoint fights. Your teammates will be able to find someone to beat on.  Lastly, pipe. It's good vs Leshrac and Veno. It's just not worth it so early on. Lesh and Veno will not be at every fight. PA and Clinkz don't deal magical damage and Spectre doesn't care about magic resistance. Moreover, look at your team -- they don't need the pipe. Huskar and AM have their own magic resistance. If Sylla is decent, he'll keep his hero on the fringes. And Dazzle is Dazzle -- he'll save someone (hopefully) if they are in trouble.   If you really think your hero needs something to deal with the magic damage, I can understand a casual cloak. But your team doesn't need the pipe. And the pipe doesn't help your hero enough. It's just costing you an extra ~3k gold. Although I don't think it is the best first item, I think a BKB would be better first item than a pipe."
TrueDoTA2,3abqyw,Ailodierap,4,Thu Jun 18 23:30:06 2015 UTC,"First off, do not buy wards as an offlaner.   Second, as clockwerk you HAVE to rush either tranqs or treads into blademail then force staff.  Pipe isn't a bad item."
TrueDoTA2,3abqyw,sanitygod,3,Thu Jun 18 21:29:39 2015 UTC,"First off, do not buy wards as an offlaner.    Your post was great, but if the support ain't buying them the Clock absolutely should as it will help him set-up ganks (and avoid death in the laning stage). Hell, the mid/carry should be buying them if no one else will- used correctly they'll easily recover their gold cost."
TrueDoTA2,3abqyw,tinkeringabout,2,Thu Jun 18 21:41:12 2015 UTC,"I would agree if it were an offlaner such as Axe, Batrider, etc. that can farm out the woods but in this case its a Clockwerk who relies completely on his early laning stage and kills to get items.  If you get rich quick then I'd suggest it otherwise it should be left up to those who can quickly find the farm to do so."
TrueDoTA2,3abqyw,James_McNulty,4,Thu Jun 18 22:12:15 2015 UTC,"You waste your money on items that don't help your hero achieve anything at all; your impact on the game fell off the moment you finished the arcanes and started building the pipe.   If you are still unconvinced about the blademail, which, as it strikes me, is pure stubbornness because almost every other user here has told you otherwise, especially how /u/vple and /u/Ailodierap have tried to elucidate the case, let me just give you a clear cut line of reasoning that should make you reconsider your position.  You might as well have been playing any other hero if you wanted to build arcanes and pipe, you still wouldn't have made a difference.   You took a core hero, but you itemised not to your hero's strength, not to achieve your hero's purpose, but in knee-jerk reaction to the enemy, and that's why you lost. And I don't mean a natural counterplay kind of reaction like MKB for the enemy's Butterfly, but basically you did not have enough impact as a player of a hero you chose, which was supposed to fulfill a certain role, and that is why you ended up accomodating the enemy team, and ended up being always one step behind. You are not active; but are reactive to the enemy team."
TrueDoTA2,3abqyw,James_McNulty,2,Sat Jun 20 20:35:35 2015 UTC,"You didn't have to buy arcane boots.  Your spells don't cost enough mana to warrant them.  Blademail should have been your first item after sitck+booties.  It's super effective vs. Lesh and Veno before they get BKBs.  Pipe was a fine choice against Veno+Lesh.  You probably should have spent more time explaining to the Syllabear that his trashcan build and terrible 4v5 tactics cost you guys the game.  I don't know exactly how the game went, but a 52 minute game with 3.2k tower damage for LD is pretty terrible."
TrueDoTA2,3abqyw,EDDE12345678,1 point,Thu Jun 18 20:41:46 2015 UTC,"The arcanes were maybe a little overkill in terms of mana needs, yeah. The pipe made it semi-necessary but I could maybe have gotten something else like drum to boost my mana pool a little. They did give me enough sustain to not have to return to base often, though. That was very useful.  As for pipe vs. blademail, I made a choice between keeping my team alive or killing the lesh and veno after they had already gotten off pretty much all their damage.  I got the feeling from watching sylla play that game that the player was inexperienced with the hero tbh. He got picked a lot by the clinkz, despite my excessive warding he was caught out farming in lane most of the time."
TrueDoTA2,3abqyw,EDDE12345678,2,Thu Jun 18 21:40:43 2015 UTC,"I favor blademail in this specific circumstance because if your LD hadn't been terrible, pushing early was your best chance to win.  Blademail is a much better aggression item than pipe, and getting a few successful ganks followed by tower kills (LD wrecks towers) would have boxed them in better while providing more map space for your carries to farm.  Pipe was definitely needed against the enemy team, but rushing it was a waste of your kit, which is more aggression oriented.  Part of the tragedy what was LD's build was that he should always survive a Clinkz gank.  450HP and 4 armor at level 6 (he didn't get ult until level 9) means you generally can simply TP away, or man up and hope for a root.  Leshrac was the only TP interrupt."
TrueDoTA2,3abqyw,EDDE12345678,2,Thu Jun 18 21:57:47 2015 UTC,Also you I disagree with going two points in flare early as vs a lesh+ pa duel lane you can 1v2 them easily if your agresive on the other hand if your passive than they can easily punish it with spaming of dagger + lightning. Another bad thing about your build is that it was so passive early pipe arcanes wand makes you useless for offensive purposes.
TrueDoTA2,3abqyw,unr4v3l,1 point,Thu Jun 18 21:59:03 2015 UTC,I have my doubts about being able to 1v2 them with rocket barrage. I did play passively and spam flare because I felt that agression could lead to me feeding if they just jumped on me and with our lanes weakened by a jungling LD as is I didn't want to lose my lane and put pressure on the mid to gank it so that I could catch up. The risk felt greater than the potential reward.
TrueDoTA2,3abqyw,EDDE12345678,2,Thu Jun 18 22:05:04 2015 UTC,"at  lvl 3 with two points in battery assult that is 450 dmg after reduction + right clicks could be a ton of potential dmg, they key to this lane is to bring lots of regen and a bottle  and try to kill lesh while he is pulling or stacking or checking rune or whatever he is doing after you get lvl 2 or lvl 3 and boots as well as some regen, after this he will play safer allowing you to pressure pa and sap lots of exp, their lane rly wasn't that strong if you play agresively. also try to mana drain them with cogs for the first couple minuites, this will make it hard for them to pressire you."

Either way RoA is usually my first big pickup on core silencer and it more or less you can kill whomever you want, whenever you want.  He loves the int, he loves the slow and he can turn a slowed hero into a dead one with remarkable efficiency.    As for sustain I've gotten by just fine with Tranqs.  You do run into mana issues if you fight a lot (and you should), but if you're fighting a lot you should be killing a lot and thus TPing to base is a realistic solution.

TrueDoTA2,3a9yw9,WellHungMan,3,Thu Jun 18 12:04:16 2015 UTC,"He's my go-to pubstomp hero. My 2nd game as Visage ever, and I got a rampage and ended up going 18/0. Obviously don't go against super durable heroes, but I've been been laning him with an Axe for maximum wombination combination."
TrueDoTA2,3a9yw9,Monsieur_Skeltal,3,Thu Jun 18 16:47:59 2015 UTC,Damn. Axe Aggro trilanes are hella cool looking.  Centaur+abba+visage
TrueDoTA2,3a9yw9,wildtarget13,2,Thu Jun 18 17:10:18 2015 UTC,Axe Aggro Trilanes are the best way to punish a team with too many melee heroes and a melee carry.
TrueDoTA2,3a9yw9,Drop_,1 point,Thu Jun 18 21:11:07 2015 UTC,He's pretty strong. Solar Crest is quite nice on him due to the -armor synergies with his skillset.
TrueDoTA2,3a9yw9,ColdPR,0,Thu Jun 18 16:13:04 2015 UTC,"I don't think we're seeing him as much because the meta is so heavily focused on teamfight. It's hard to justify running support visage over a support with a stun or who comes online at level 2-3.  He only really works in a defensive trilane, and he doesn't get much done until level 6."
TrueDoTA2,3a9yw9,pepe_le_shoe,2,Thu Jun 18 12:30:34 2015 UTC,"?  Visage is amazing at teamfighting.  He has 2 (or 3) AOE and bkb-piercing stuns, a shitton of magic damage from his W and is super tanky.  Visage lanes very well in a trilane or aggressive trilane and loves action."
TrueDoTA2,3a9yw9,phob,1 point,Thu Jun 18 18:17:44 2015 UTC,"I think you're over-valuing his stuns. And I didn't mean to say that he was bad in teamfights, it's just that, at the moment, a lot happens before supports hit level 6, and visage really struggles to make an impact before than, compared to something like lion, aa, venge, rubick etc. you don't have birds until 6, and then if you use them to stun, you don't get as much damage out of them. Compare with lion - 2 disables at level 2, and a huge bump in power at level 6. Visage gets a small bump at 6, then another when he gets aghs, but that's it really. If you want a damage dealing support, something like sand king or lina or skywrath are better options."
TrueDoTA2,3a9yw9,pepe_le_shoe,1 point,Thu Jun 18 18:43:43 2015 UTC,"At a high level, Visage does perform very well.  In May he was at the top of Tier 2 heroes in P+B rate in competitive, ahead of every other support you mentioned.  His winrate was 59%; Rubick being the next-highest support on that list had only 49%.  Visage is greedy, best played as a 4 position; he's not going to do much without some amount of farm, such as medallion + point booster by 15 or 20 minutes and a reasonably timed Agh's afterward.  He's versitile: he's very hard to kill (both from cloak tankiness and mobility from Q), provides a lot of control (slow + stun) and damage (including physical burst), and can farm and split push very quickly (with birds).  Most other supports usually have only 2 of the 4 attributes I mentioned.  Visage has all 3 and can still farm quickly."

At that point at least one hero should be dead, the rest of the team stunned, and your W off cooldown when they wake up"

TrueDoTA2,3a9yw9,phob,1 point,Fri Jun 19 00:46:09 2015 UTC,"I think he's a weak support this patch, there are so many meta heroes with reliable stuns or CC, and a visage without a well timed level 6 is pretty weak. I like running him in the offlane, with Grave Chill most ganks are escapable and once you tick level 6 with tranq/medallion you can get easy solo kills.  I usually build Deso before Aghs, aghs really shines when you have level 3 birds, but deso helps any other physical damage on your team, and gives you great speed at taking objectives or rosh earlier with medallion."
TrueDoTA2,3a9yw9,easternone,2,Thu Jun 18 13:48:57 2015 UTC,"I usually build Deso before Aghs   Wouldn't Solar Crest pay off more here? Easier build-up, cheaper, more utility then just pure damage, and you already plan on having the Medallion up first."
TrueDoTA2,3a9yw9,Ailodierap,3,Thu Jun 18 15:33:25 2015 UTC,"Yes.  Being able to use it on your allies is huge, while deso is only useful aggressively and the +Dmg doesn't synergize with Visage's kit."
TrueDoTA2,3a9yw9,phob,1 point,Fri Jun 19 00:47:46 2015 UTC,"Deso gives +50 damage on your rightclicks, and increases the damage of your birds by 20-something percent. For 3500 gold, it's well worth it if you're doing well early (Aghs is only great at level 16, solar crest is only good if they have a lot of melee damage)  It's all situational"
TrueDoTA2,3a9yw9,easternone,2,Sun Jun 21 13:32:48 2015 UTC,"Explain again how solar crest, which is cheaper than deso and gives more -armor is only good if they have ""melee damage"" (did you mean physical?)...  Note that evasion actually works really well with gravekeeper's cloak as you keep up cloak charges for longer.  It's a similar synergy with TA's refraction and butterfly."
TrueDoTA2,3a9yw9,phob,1 point,Sun Jun 21 18:42:28 2015 UTC,"I did mean physical, yes. Solar crest provides no bonus over Medallion if your team has significant magical damage, or if their team has the same and you're using it as a projected survival item. You spend 1800 gold for an additional -3 armor on a cooldown.   A desolator not only gives you -7 armor (meaning a total of -14 to any hero) but it also gives you a massive buff to taking objectives.   I upgrade medallion > solar crest if I find I can't survive fights, otherwise I go desolator > aghs if I'm tanky enough and we need more damage."
TrueDoTA2,3a9yw9,easternone,1 point,Sun Jun 21 19:13:13 2015 UTC,"Definitely a weak support. I feel like as a core, he's super underwhelming compared to say bristleback or earthshaker offlane. Having damage isn't really a challenge, there are so many viable cores to be your damage dealers (gyro, lesh, sf, qop, bristle, any carry)"
TrueDoTA2,3a9yw9,pepe_le_shoe,1 point,Thu Jun 18 13:56:10 2015 UTC,"He only really works in a defensive trilane, and he doesn't get much done until level 6.   You don't think he could do alright in an offensive trilane? Beyond the obvious synergy with a Drow carry, I think he could rock an offensive tri with a smart draft."
TrueDoTA2,3a9yw9,Ailodierap,1 point,Thu Jun 18 15:34:24 2015 UTC,"Possibly, but he benefits more from being able to take the safelane farm once the carry is able to farm the jungle."
TrueDoTA2,3a9iz6,veridis_quo666,6,Thu Jun 18 08:22:44 2015 UTC,"You have played 5 games with Lesh. His stun is a skillshot, his cast animations are garbage.  You have to play him mid to get a big lead etc.  Now this game it's obvious, your picks were garbage. A jungle enigma as the solo support. Very greedy picks that need a lot of farm to come online against a bounty, pudge, QoP, Jugg.   You WILL lose lanes, you WILL feed. Bounty snowballed hard and Jugg got total free farm because your lanes were so weak. This game was lost at 15 min."
TrueDoTA2,3a9iz6,greenhatman99,4,Thu Jun 18 08:56:22 2015 UTC,"Eh actually Lesh is very strong this patch and he is very versatile. I have experimented first picking him into any lineup a couple of times at 5k and I've gone offlane support and even roaming at 5k if my mid is taken and still manage to get a KDA of above 3.0 at worst.  His spells are so strong they let him function without items at the start and you can snowball from any role with Edict together with your team if you are playing position #3/4/5 just by 5 manning and taking down outer towers very fast, allowing him to transition from a support into a core role. He can stack and clear the jungle later on for EHP/important items like FS/Eul/GS/Glimmer on his own as well, simply because of Pulse Nova. Other supports have a hard time contesting the runes with him if it's 1v1 as well because of Edict and his superior movespeed.   Don't underestimate utility/support lesh."

TrueDoTA2,3a9iz6,Jackolope,1 point,Thu Jun 18 20:38:06 2015 UTC,"That's most certainly not true. You think they're 5 manning but you're not. It's just that stupid mexican standoff you guys always do at mid because you don't know what to do.   If they're 5 manning, you can split farm. And with Leshrac, it's so much easier, and you can actually threaten towers. If you have Eul, they can't send 1 person to defend the tower from you; he'd die alone so they have to tp more than 1. Who says single target 'strats' don't work?  Also, do you really think that 3k players 5 man perfectly? Chances are they don't have the coordination execute a 5 man deathball push properly, you'll probably see this 2/10 games.  And if you think Sheep is a 'single target strat', then try not using it in a 5v5 engagement to take out a key target. Wtf that doesn't make sense at all. Neither Eul nor Sheep is a 'single target strat'."

You're counting on the game ending in a timely fashion when you pick leshrac. Leaving him without extra levels just means you have less impact. At that point, I'd say you're likely better off picking up someone like crystal maiden instead. She has a bigger ulti in teamfights, reliable stun, and a mana aura."

I am also 'counting on ending the game in a timely fashion' when I pick any hero. What does that even mean?  Leaving him without extra levels means I have less impact. Any hero with less levels has less impact?  And after talking about less levels you say cm is a better pick when she currently has 1. no place in the meta 2. a reliable 'ROOT' which is certainly NOT  a reliable stun 3. a mana aura which requires levels, but because 'leaving her without extra levels just means you have less impact', right?"

Go to Dotabuff and check out the trends tabs for leshrac and lina. Note the yellow part of the top graph. Leshrac's disappears at about level twenty. You know why? Because he ends games quicker and you don't take him late. At level 16, he tops out in damage. You don't pick up damage items on leshrac. You get shit to keep casting so you can push their shit in. You're not counting on ending the game early if you pick Anti-Mage.   Shit, do I have to spell this stuff out for you. The dude lost all his leshrac games and theyre all an hour long.  Coincidence?   CM can jungle quickly, producing a real advantage for her team,  leshrac as support is a liability if he never gets any items. He has no options other than winning early. The dude burns mana ridiculously fast and is not efficient with it in jungle unless you have levels in edict, which is unlikely. Don't speak out of your ass because you feel like it."
TrueDoTA2,3a9iz6,greenhatman99,1 point,Fri Jun 19 05:08:18 2015 UTC,"No, I am not ""throwing combative phrases at you just because"". I would just like to be convinced as to why you would recommend/mention cm as an option, and because the dude is obviously looking to win with Leshrac, not just looking to win. He intends to find out about his Leshrac play. Other than that, I agree with what you are saying but your points are more applicable to core leshrac than support leshrac. Just because the game goes 60 minutes doesn't mean you're screwed; as a support role with amazing flashfarm you would have a ton of utility items. If you compare the amount of farm on a 60 minute cm with 60 minute lesh I think you know as well that there is no contest there."
TrueDoTA2,3a9iz6,Clarty94,-1,Fri Jun 19 08:09:22 2015 UTC,"i marked mid lesh in the start of the match. what was i supposed to do, tell them what to pick like they'll listen to me?"
TrueDoTA2,3a9iz6,ProfessorMonocle,5,Thu Jun 18 09:12:16 2015 UTC,"Depends on what your goal was that match. If your goal was to prove that you were right and that you had marked mid first, goal was achieved. If your goal was to actually win the match, then letting SF mid would've been right. Leshrac has the best potential for being a support out of the heroes you had that match, therefore it should be a support in that draft."
TrueDoTA2,3a9iz6,DangerAwar,2,Thu Jun 18 18:27:00 2015 UTC,"No, going mid lesh is fine, forget about your team's picks. You can suggest things, but don't rely on them listening. If nobody buys courier, you get enough gold for bottle + courier + tp, and you either drop the courier and ask someone else to deploy it, or you bite the bullet and go back to the fountain.  From then on, just play around your team, keep up your farm, punish your opponents overextensions and positioning mistakes, and adapt to the flow of the game. Once you get to level 10+, you can start using edict to push down towers. Early boots of travels will come in handy, so that you can join in the fights your team start without you."
TrueDoTA2,3a9iz6,Clarty94,0,Thu Jun 18 10:06:52 2015 UTC,"I think you answered your own question. Don't pick the Lesh unless you know he will fit. He is a good 3rd pick or something in pubs.  He cannot hard carry like a AM, Slar, Jugg etc - he hits hard but not that hard. He is super strong in top level play because with some control his output in team fights is very high and he almost never loses his lane."
TrueDoTA2,3a9iz6,DangerAwar,2,Thu Jun 18 09:19:13 2015 UTC,"Thats awful advice, just first pick him, in pubs you can win any 1v1 matchup in mid with him. He doesn't hard carry but it doesn't matter because if played correctly you will just smash mid then snowball like crazy, there are plenty of 6k+ lesh spammers right now first picking this hero with great results. Also unlike a lot of heroes if mid gets taken by some dickhead you can always play support lesh, it's nowhere near as good but unlike Qop or Storm support it's actually playable."
TrueDoTA2,3a9iz6,Clarty94,-1,Thu Jun 18 12:33:42 2015 UTC,"the thing is that even if I crush mid if the other lanes feed the game is lost. I mean, maybe I'm little better than the other in my bracket, but I can't play under that much pressure if you know what I mean...  yeah btw it seems that the person is wrong. 5K coach just told me and it sounds pretty legit, under 5K the picks don't matter almost don't matter at all (so after 20 constant lesh games i'll be getting the hang of it somehow)"

TrueDoTA2,3a9iz6,WRLD_WRLD,2,Thu Jun 18 09:41:15 2015 UTC,"He is easily versatile enough to be first picked, he is one of the few mid heroes who can actually be played as a support or an offlane core without being awful. If your team aren't communicating any hero will be equally as awful as lesh anyway. Another reason to first pick him is that he has no losing matchups mid, there are plenty of 6k+ lesh spammers just first picking him every game, he is the new troll of the patch right now."

Storm is a snowbally hero, so you usually look for pickoffs but it gets harder against a tanky kinda lineup. Those kinda scenarios are personally harder for me, but its not like they're unbeatable.

TrueDoTA2,3a916g,EDDE12345678,3,Thu Jun 18 15:20:55 2015 UTC,"People say this, but I still see games in 6k+ where Dooms blow Doom on a Linkens, or get outplayed and don't secure anything with their ult. Ofc the same goes for Storm Spirit's possibility of getting outplayed, but its dangerous to get into this mentality where just because someone can theoretically counter you, that you should assume they will always get the play off successfully. It's difficult to keep track of Linken's CD and, with a lot of other factors in the game, I think its much easier for a Storm to play around a Doom then it is for Doom to play around a Storm."
TrueDoTA2,3a916g,Thalnagath,1 point,Thu Jun 18 15:45:21 2015 UTC,"plus doom's cast time is like 0.7 sec, so if ou see te blue bubble pops just zip to a safe place."
TrueDoTA2,3a916g,Thalnagath,1 point,Thu Jun 18 20:47:54 2015 UTC,"Wiki doesn't show the information anymore for some reason, but I'm about 99% certain Doomy has a bog-standard 0.50 sec castpoint.  Slow by INT hero standards, but completely normal by STR hero standards."
TrueDoTA2,3a916g,Thalnagath,1 point,Thu Jun 18 23:06:23 2015 UTC,"I think its much easier for a Storm to play around a Doom then it is for Doom to play around a Storm.   Absolutely.  Once you have bottle+treads+soul ring, there's essentially no real limiting factor on Ball Lightning anymore (which is why Storm Spirit is so hideously overpowered), let alone when you have a Linkens.  But more likely, SS would just get a normal item first (either cheatstick or orchid) and get the Linkens later, relying on being aware of his surroundings to avoid Doom early on.  SS's castpoint for zip is quite a bit faster than Doomy's castpoint for Doom, so it's pretty difficult for Doomy to land his spell if SS is aware and otherwise not locked down.  The best solution for SS is still hex (but that's why SS gets BKB and then becomes completely unstoppable.)"
TrueDoTA2,3a916g,bkkchamp,1 point,Thu Jun 18 23:09:43 2015 UTC,"Doomy has a 0.5 sec cast time while SS has an effectively limitless invulnerability buff that also allows rapid movement and repositioning.  Yes, it's certainly possible to land a Doom on Storm Spirit, but that's usually pretty difficult against an intelligent player and goes double if they have a Linkens (because you now have to complete two 0.5 sec casts in order to land the doom.)"
TrueDoTA2,3a916g,Thalnagath,2,Thu Jun 18 23:05:32 2015 UTC,"As long as you aren't initiating team fights even a skywrath isn't scary imo, he should be cleaning up team fights and picking off supports, not balling into 5 people."

TrueDoTA2,3a6pqc,TheBigBallsOfFury,18,Wed Jun 17 17:37:38 2015 UTC,"It's in a pretty good spot.  I would say this is probably the best version of DotA2 to play for a few reasons.  Main one though being that it makes playing support more fun since you will be completely deprived less often with the spread gold changes on kills.    There is still a very slight rubberband effect on exp, but gold is mostly rubberbanding due to streak gold which has been in for a long time.  So that's fine.  There needs to be some way to come back into the game and this is probably the best way, or close enough to the best way.    I see a lot of comebacks both in pro and pub games so I don't think there is any reason to think it's stompy.  What the changes mostly focused on were a) making the game less passive (which it mostly successfully did), and b) making it feel more fair (which it definitely did).    I could see a few more improvements to split pushing and general rat dota as a strategy, I think it's a little weak right now, but not completely non-viable.    Overall I think dota2 is in a really good place.  A couple heroes seem a little too strong.  And a few hero combinations are kind of gross, but dota2 has always been like that."
TrueDoTA2,3a6pqc,Drop_,2,Wed Jun 17 17:55:55 2015 UTC,"Last patches killed the early game, and I think we are seeing a resurgence, which was great."
TrueDoTA2,3a6pqc,TheSpekio,6,Thu Jun 18 01:16:55 2015 UTC,"In my opinion one of the biggest changes of the patch, something that it seems not a lot of people are talking about, is the rax gold. Clearing out both a melee and ranged rax now gives every hero on your team 500 gold, which is an almost ludicrous amount of gold and doesnt even take into account the last hit gold, which is an additional 100-150 gold each. At this point, taking one lane fully gives your team anywhere from 2500-2800 gold(which is reliable). If you had suggested giving this much of a benefit to pushing early 2 patches ago, people would have laughed you out of the game, and I think this change above all else is causing a focus on early game aggression again(about which I am not complaining).  One thing that I have noticed starting to happen very recently is a move away from the traditional farm priority system, meaning the classic 3, 4, and somewhat 5 roles are getting an unbelievable more amount of gold than they have before. On top of this, the buffs to the offlane that both teams have been getting recently(most notably dire offlane), means that there is much more space to make big offlane plays, which is also responsible for a lot of teams favoring the aggressive trilane again(which I am all for).  I'm glad that the memeback mechanics have been adequately nerfed and because of this they're no longer the menace they used to be in the past 2 major releases(6.82c and 6.83c), however in my opinion I think its far too early to say that we have hit a ""sweet spot"". It would be far too easy to link to many threads that came out after 6.83 and 6.83b where people were praising the game for nerfing the push meta that was very fotm and made people start to dislike the game..."
TrueDoTA2,3a6pqc,PopeofAutism,1 point,Wed Jun 17 22:07:19 2015 UTC,Yeah the objective gaming they tried to get people to use definitely worked. I'm seeing more early ganks and rotations into towers being taken. It's fantastic.
TrueDoTA2,3a6pqc,Slothtimistic,1 point,Thu Jun 18 02:10:05 2015 UTC,"It should be noted that tower and rax gold are both reliable. Meaning that if you get t3 + 2 rax, and subsequently lose a fight 0-5, each player still has 740 reliable gold per player that they cannot lose (assuming no denies). This is 3700 total net gain for the team, purely in reliable gold.   This is often why, despite taking an awful fight for rax, it is very hard for teams to truly full behind from it.   Personally I feel rax should represent a strategical advantage, or decision, rather than a more one dimensional 'win-state'."
TrueDoTA2,3a6pqc,situLight,1 point,Thu Jun 18 07:14:23 2015 UTC,"I feel its at a great point. Like you said, early game really feels like it has more impact now. It's how I feel the game style should be. If you lock down an early lead, taking a slow, but objective based, strategy seems to be rewarding. The game wont spin out of control when a behind jugg gets a good omnislash and kills 2 heroes on your team.   I'm loving how people are now more active early game."
TrueDoTA2,3a6pqc,Slothtimistic,1 point,Thu Jun 18 02:08:15 2015 UTC,"Game is super balanced right now IMO.  Early game strats work well if not counter, mid game works if not countered, and holding out to late game works.  Game is being won at draft and game strat right now.  The rubberband effect is good right now. If you are playing an early-mid game hero and you don't capitalize, your snowball won't hold to late game. This is a good thing.  The team that plays more like a team seems to be winning out in every game I have played this patch."
TrueDoTA2,3a6pqc,lebastss,1 point,Thu Jun 18 04:26:59 2015 UTC,"I've been laying dota since 6.81 and this is defainently my favorite patch, im starting to get into supporting which I now find super fun, I used to consider it really boring as I would just have to stack 24/7 and go midas as every support(quite exaggerated but my point stands). Also I find there is still tons of undiscovered strats and more stuff can work than in any other meta. This meta I feel like there is no playstyle that gets hard punished like last metas."
TrueDoTA2,3a8277,unr4v3l,4,Wed Jun 17 23:26:37 2015 UTC,"I think 84 is more active of a patch, in general, than 83 was, but 84c is much more passive than the previous iterations of 84. That being said, i think the standard golden rule of dota still applies:  Pounce on Free Kills, Push When You Can, Fight When You Have to, and Farm at All Other Times  If you like, my Thoughts on the Mid Game explores this idea in more depth."
TrueDoTA2,3a8277,goblinbiddin,2,Thu Jun 18 06:05:58 2015 UTC,"A lot of this is about team compositions. Obviously if all their heroes are low hp or out of position, the extra gold from seizing an opportunity is good. It's also good to team fight if a core hero has picked up a core item. But like I said, its about the compositions.  If you have a sven/pa/sb that just picked up a BKB that will make them immune to most the damage on the enemy team, it would be more wise to force a fight without showing it.  Likewise, if your team is getting destroyed or simply doesnt have a decent ""team fighting"" lineup (aka tide, enigma, void), than it would be better to just force towers and look for heroes out of position."
TrueDoTA2,3a8277,Slothtimistic,2,Thu Jun 18 02:15:51 2015 UTC,"You always pushing towers. You never force teamfights. You fight because they're defending the tower. You fight because you can bully them.  You have a good idea how how to solo queue. But here's the real trick to solo queue. Other than giving space to your team, you also passive farm, kill steal, and sacrifice allies who are a liability."
TrueDoTA2,3a8e3h,Pentt41207,12,Thu Jun 18 01:10:22 2015 UTC,"You didn't steamroll shit in that game? Your biggest team advantage in the game was 3k exp at 13 minutes but that alone doesn't mean anything if you don't know how to secure your advantage.   Somehow as an Undying you also had the least Hero Damage in your team, and the game even. So don't you think that the problem could be with your own play? And how is 1/8/6 the best KDA.  You also have a way sub-50% all time winrate so I don't think it's just 6.84 in general.. you definitely need to improve your general mechanics and change your perception of the game."

Your biggest team advantage in the game was 3k exp at 13 minutes but that alone doesn't mean anything if you don't know how to secure your advantage.   3 towers in 10 mins with 2 dual victories for LC. They couldnt fight into us early. They were also very timid and unable to engage us. Our LC (who yelled in spanish the entire game) went off to his on little world and decided that pushing with us was not worth his while any longer as they started grouping up and taking fights.    You also have a way sub-50% all time winrate so I don't think it's just 6.84 in general.. you definitely need to improve your general mechanics and change your perception of the game.   Yes I do. I fell in love early with tinker invoker puck and other high skill cap heroes. Was probably too early to play those heroes but it it is what it is there. Im trying to get better on Storm. Im learning there. My other stats overall have been climbing steadily the past 6 months. GPM XPM LH/10. All up. KDA is a little up and down though
TrueDoTA2,3a8e3h,tinkeringabout,5,Thu Jun 18 03:38:29 2015 UTC,"You've been playing for 2 years, if this is your main account and you are naturally good you would have fixed your winrate by now and at least break 50%. How do you feel losing more than half your games like why are you even playing then?  Your mentality sucks ass and needs to change if you want to actually win. It's always 'them' 'they' 'that guy' but never 'what can I do to improve' or 'what can I do differently that might have increased our odds of winning the game?'   3 towers in 10 minutes with 2 dual victories for LC and they can't fight into you early. Wow ok. But so fucking what? It's what happens in most average games with an Undying anyway; they also had 4 cores and a solo support. If you didn't close or crush that game beyond reason early you were always going to lose. And you definitely did not crush that game as an Undying. You got that advantage by virtue of your pick, not your play.  I am calling you out now because you are asking for people to 'help you win' but you are not even focusing on your own play which already defeats the point of this post entirely."
TrueDoTA2,3a8e3h,tinkeringabout,-1,Thu Jun 18 04:02:19 2015 UTC,Um duh? Thats what I was getting at. I knew we need to push early this game and continue with what our team comp had. Push as much as we could early and choke the map out. I tried to get my team to understand that with the advantage we had with team comp and gold gold lead.   Did I have the best game that game? Absolutely not. Is there stuff that I could of done better? Of course.
TrueDoTA2,3a8e3h,tinkeringabout,3,Thu Jun 18 04:09:03 2015 UTC,Knowing how to close the game and actually closing the game are two entirely different things. Instead of telling me that what do you think were the 'stuff that you could of done better?'
TrueDoTA2,3a8e3h,Licheus,0,Thu Jun 18 04:21:06 2015 UTC,Obviously not dying 8 times would be a great start. Is the Glimmer Cape the right purchase there. I wasnt so sure. Felt early that the Void couldnt kill a person in a chrono and If i wasnt caught in it it would save that person.
TrueDoTA2,3a8e3h,Groudas,5,Thu Jun 18 04:32:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah but that doesn't tell us anything. It's easy to say 'don't die' but why would you go bottom 3 times in a row pinging the t1 and dying in the chrono like 3-4 times in a row? It's almost as if you wanted to lose  yourself.   If you want your team to even listen to you you have to give them a reason first. People will only take advice from you if they have confidence in you, so if you start playing on tilt and tell them hey guys we have to push early do you think they'd listen to you? Course not.   Why would you buy a glimmer cape for the void, or in that game for any instance? They had almost no magic damage and if you really wanted to save someone from the chrono and not just AFTER the chrono, wouldn't you buy a medallion for 2/3 the price? Wouldn't you just Tomb then soul rip the guy in the chrono? You had a wisp anyway your team had ample heals. Glimmer cape doesn't even save the guy in chrono; chrono reveals invisibility? And tbh you were the one caught in the chrono most of the time, your positioning is terrible. You also didn't get off any spells a couple of times and the void didn't even timewalk to you; he walked. You were also walking around for a good 5 minutes with the shadow amulet at a timing which you yourself acknowledge was a core timing to push, how much do you think that Shadow amulet helped? You might as well not have purchased anything. You could've made any amount of small items such as medallion to save people or urn to sustain the push which you said you so wanted? That amulet was to be perfectly honest, terribly game losing.   As an offlaner you also did not contest/check a single rune, nor zone the void; he still had top CS despite your dual lane. You did not contest pulls or harass them beyond 1 decay stack. Yes you killed him once or twice with the help of NA. Doesn't do anything he might as well had free farm. You did not place aggressive wards. Naturally your team would just sit back and farm. Their heroes and yours are so different and if you're not communicating, their perception of the game and yours will obviously not be the same. You say 'but they don't even speak English!', but if you have offensive wards which make for easy kills and confidence in extending a lead, naturally they'd follow. If you only have two fucking rune wards in the same place on both sides all game let me tell you no one is going to cross the damn river.  Yes I watched that replay to get a feel of your skill bracket. Yes you can tell me that wasn't your best game, etc. But you were the one who mentioned that game in the first place as if it was winnable with the way you were playing. So I don't really know what to say. Your average game habits are mediocre at best so even if that was not your A-game you need to be constantly performing if you want to win more. That's how it works? Your game impact is not high enough that it warrants a win."
TrueDoTA2,3a8e3h,Groudas,2,Thu Jun 18 04:47:58 2015 UTC,"So I've read the conversation between you and tinkeringabout. He's harsh but he seems to be coming from a point of insight and experience. He is harsh, so you may learn. Try to be very critical about yourself and take advantage of his willingness to help.  I assume that you're genuinely interested in improving. You've put in the effort to post here and discuss, after all. The absolute primary thing you have to understand if you want to improve is that you have to work on your approach, your attitude.  In regards to your post above I present you with advice (just one example) on how you can work on your own attitude:  If you ask yourself what you could've done better in a game, and your answer is something like ""I should not have done x"", then also try to add what you should have done. In your mind you cannot let the first answer pass your own reality check. The ""should not"" answer is a way your brain dodges the real problem by presenting a weak solution that looks sufficient on the surface. An answer that would be a real solution that would actually have the potential to help you in the future would be something like ""Instead of doing x I should have done y"". See the difference? You have to go all the way and assess what you should have done rather than what you shouldn't have done. The focus and intention needs to be shifted from shouldn't to should.  • ""I should not have been out of position"" is not really useful for learning and improving. ""I should have been behind my team in this or that position"" is good.  • ""I should not have TPed in"" is sort of bad. ""I should either have TPed in right as the dive happened earlier or I should not have TPed in at all and kept farming top"" is better.  • ""We cannot come back from this"" is pitiful and weak. ""We need a bunch of divine rapiers and several stacked cheese to be able to outfight their team and the mega creeps"" is honourable and it keeps your mindset and your mood in a healthier state.  If you don't have a solution even after genuinely thinking about it then you just note the fact that you do not have a solution and move on. Maybe later when you have more experience you will have a solution to the question or a similar one."
TrueDoTA2,3a8e3h,wildtarget13,3,Thu Jun 18 21:48:55 2015 UTC,"I can't stand supporting at the MMR level I am at   Simply from this above statement I can draw a quick guess about your profile: You are a main Carry/Mid player that used to rock on last patch because of rubberband and ultra dificult base breaking patch and now is struggling because you dont know what a support does and is clueless why you are not winning games anymore. Well, I have to say that Icefrog wanted to exactly nerf your playstyle. It was too easy to win on pubs with little effort when exploiting the balances issues from .82 and .83.  I suggest you to re-learn some of the gameflow (like buying early game itens instead of aiming just 4k itens), subtle leadership (you lead your team not by screaming on mic, but with wards, pushes and alt-clicking).  And, I agree with everyone: Taking a couple of towers as Undy by 10 minutes is just average. CS/10 and KDA dont win games either (in fact, being the best KDA in the team as a carry and bragging about it is serious bullshit and an indicator that you really dont understand Dota in general).  Dont be angry about what you are reading, just try to focus on learning more.  Edit: spelling"
TrueDoTA2,3a8e3h,albinoblackman,-1,Thu Jun 18 12:58:15 2015 UTC,"I wish some one could actually say something in regards to actual game play other than just learning as you go or atittude. Something tangible would be nice   Personally I know this patch has hurt my play style. I'm a passive farmer by nature and I am trying how to be more involved. A big issue I get into is that either A) I pick a mid game hero do ok to well in but can't seem to get objectives so the other team with more or better late game cores build up and come back or B) I pick late game carries and proceed to get steam rolled. Two instances last night. First game of the day I felt like playing FV it's been a while since I had played him. Off to a fantastic start. First blood. I'm farming great looking at a 13-15 min Bfury. That's until we see the enemy mid slark grab a DD rune and come bot towards me. I see it instantly and retreat back to my tower ping/mic for my team mate to come bot. He's a necro (necro support ugh who's done nothing but sap exp and push the lane with aura/pulse by the way) and puts up an ok fight. As soon as I see the slark I call for TPs in. We have an NP so we would have a 4-3 advantage. Problem is that no one comes to help. That starts slarks snowball as he ends up getting 3 kills out of the DD rune as he picks off the Midas rush jungle np by himself. Game starts to suffocate as slark now has a sblade and I can't fight into him. We end up getting steam rolled after a fabulous start for our 1 position carry.   Take the next game the terrible on tilt undying game. Guess what against a Void. I know exactly what I need to do. They have a heavy core line up. I know we need to push. Problem is, we don't. We take a few quick towers. Gold exp lead against a weak early game team. Push the advantage. They can't fight into the tombstone this early. Well their cores gear up and the game ends woefully. I feel like I make the right macro game decisions but it usually involves whole team but if the team doesn't follow suit it usually ends up being a disaster."
TrueDoTA2,3a8e3h,greenhatman99,3,Thu Jun 18 14:26:08 2015 UTC,"actually say something in regards to actual game   Remember when I said to stop buying 4k itens for more cheap ones? Thats a actual gameplay tip that could help you on your Void game. Slark is starting to snowball already and you still insist on finishing a fucking BF when you know you wont have space to use it.  Think about it.  Edit: im sorry I cant discuss longer, im at work. I will try to read all you comment later.   Edit 2: Another thing about your Void game: U went BF > MOM > Maelstrom. I understand Void get great value from atkspeed but usually you won't want 3 farming itens on a carry, specially against a Shadow Blade slark+pudge+nyx. You should really have gotten a BKB (to not melt against OD, AM ult and Nyx magic combo) at least.  I hope good luck on next games."
TrueDoTA2,3a8e3h,albinoblackman,2,Thu Jun 18 14:54:43 2015 UTC,"If you are getting frustrated with the game, I recommend focusing on...a few heroes.   First of all, I have to say I'm biased that you probably have about 3/5 insight about the game based on the amount of carries you have under most played. I find that knowing about every hero's role and limits and how they play help so much more.  I'm not going to look into your games too much, but the last undying game you described you actually did very little damage and healed very few of your allies. I know AMP damage and decay steal doesn't show, but tombstone zombies and decay still do enough damage to show.   I don't know how much you analyze your replays or who you look into for Dota insight, whether it be pro games, streamers, etc. But I assume that most people don't watch that stuff and still get by through trial and error.   I think at this point if you really have lost it that you should play ability draft or unranked games to just practice more. It teaches a lot about how you can play mechanically. Don't blame your allies, you can't change how well they play. And communicating with them only helps so much as no one learns things in the middle of a Dota match.  If you really can't stand pubbers, you gotta grind solo queue until you find people who you get a long with. And if you're one of the flamers who people don't get a long with, they probably won't stick around.   Lastly don't be so hard on yourself, this game is really hard. We can't all get 50%+ winrate every week. Learn to be selfless about the game and focus on how you can win the game.   I guarantee you that most people that look at a lineup and think ""we focking lost"" probably need to imagine the possibility of winning with coordination and extremely specific items.  Dude...learn to play support. You haven't played a hard support in a few months. Or even a traditional support. I see some oracle games in there, but that's like saying, you should try carries try Meepo."

I don't know how much you analyze your replays or who you look into for Dota insight, whether it be pro games, streamers, etc. But I assume that most people don't watch that stuff and still get by through trial and error.   I watch a lot of pro games and streams and try to emulate as best as I can. Unfortunately supports who only know how to ward runes and sap xp really stall the snowball.   I think at this point if you really have lost it that you should play ability draft or unranked games to just practice more. It teaches a lot about how you can play mechanically. Don't blame your allies, you can't change how well they play. And communicating with them only helps so much as no one learns things in the middle of a Dota match.   I wish this was the case but I am just ultra competitive and want to be higher ranked or at least show progress. All my numbers are trending up except for my win rates and my MMR. I know my top heroes are low win rates right now but generally have higher skill caps and feel like I have greatly improved. Just the wins arent coming.   If you really can't stand pubbers, you gotta grind solo queue until you find people who you get a long with. And if you're one of the flamers who people don't get a long with, they probably won't stick around.   I just rarely find anyone like me. Playing on USE I am lucky to get to not get 3 spanish speakers on my team. Heaven forbid some one english speaking that is willing to give and take advice. ""Hey man I think a BKB would be a great purchace vs their stun heavy line up"" It just doesnt happen often to find some who wants to get better.    Lastly don't be so hard on yourself, this game is really hard. We can't all get 50%+ winrate every week. Learn to be selfless about the game and focus on how you can win the game.   I am not usually hard on myself. I just want to win. The thing that drives me crazy is that in normal modes is the significantly better team mates and enemies I get. Better item purchases. Smoke ganks rotations by supports. TPs for ganks. Feels like a completely different game. I feel like I belong there more but as soon as I get in ranked I get the scum off the bottom of the barrel. Like it is impossibly difficult to drag through to a win. Maybe I am just too much of a team player expecting a team to work together. I don't know."
TrueDoTA2,3a8e3h,PepperJohn,5,Thu Jun 18 03:30:20 2015 UTC,"You keep talking about your MMR. What is your MMR? I rose from 2.8k to 3.3k in a little less than 30 games (you do the math) playing only Vengeful Spirit. You clearly don't know what it means to play support. You need to carry from the bottom and drag your team kicking and screaming to victory.  Your attitude is crap too. You need to be able to be flexible and judge each situation before you act. Don't smoke gank because that's what you think supports are supposed to do. Evaluate the chance of success, the need for a gank and the opportunity cost of leaving lane. Another thing I've learned is that greedy supports lose games in these core-heavy low mmr pubs. I know you really want those fancy boots or that shiny new mek, but you will miss out on so many early game opportunities due to the wards and TPs you didn't buy. TP reactions are so overpowered in this tier and people will just throw away their lives in failed aggression. Then voila, you have all that money you so desired from assist gold on double kill."

Focus on YOUR position, YOUR actions in teamfights, YOUR analysis of your opponents - find THEIR weak links. Statistically you get as many games with idiots as you play against them.  I just recently had a game I was almost certain we had lost because of TERRIBLE picks, and almost no lategame to speak of and we didn't get much done in the first 25+ minutes. But everyone on my team was playing OK, little feeding and we went on to win because they didn't know how to close out. This was all morale.   A couple month back I would have mentally checked out, now I bolster on my teammates. ""Ok boys, this Tinker is a dumbass, lets get a pickoff on him and one other then sneak a rosh and we can easy pick off a lane of Rax. etc.""  Also TPs - always carry TP's check your team mates TPs and punish their out of position plays.  I am running at around 52% winrate this patch - and out of the 70+ games I have played new heroes and unfamiliar heroes around 20 times. So I expect the drop. Also 95% of my games are support.

TrueDoTA2,3a5rut,zenmod3,10,Wed Jun 17 19:25:54 2015 UTC,"I think it needs to be better defined when it comes to skill. What are you counting into that?   Decision making? Spell versatility? Foresight? Micro? Finger dexterity? Skill Shots?   There are a lot of ways to define it.  For example:   Sand King - I recall Merlini saying he felt this was one of the hardest heroes because of the initiations. Personally, I don't see it that way, but I guess I can see where that comment is coming from. In addition, the hero is also very slippery if you play him well, getting multi-hero stuns takes skill prior to Blink, and laning him can be done in a variety of creative ways. Invoker - his skill floor is pretty undefined. You can minimally get away with just Tornado, EMP, and Cold Snap if you wanted to. Likewise, you could get away with Forge Spirits, Cold Snap, and Sun Strike. That is significantly easier than the skill floor of ""minimally knowing how to use all your spells"". Nature's Prophet - generally simple spells, but how you use them makes a huge difference. From junggling aggro in the jungle, to treant trapping, to pulling the offlane for farm -- there are a huge amount of ways to use his treants. Teleport is a hugely impactful spell by being able to rotate around and turn a 3v3 engagement into a 3v4. Slark - generally considered a dumb pubstomper. But if you play him at a high level, using Dark Pact requires finesse or you will kill yourself.   Skill Floor  This I would define as ""being able to do anything with your hero"".  I would say a couple of things boost skill floor the most:   Any sort of micro/finger dexterity Any sort of foresight/skillshot   This would leave heroes like: Tinker, Invoker, PotM, Pudge, Chen, Visage, Earth Spirit, etc.  The problem is that if they have any resources, the skill floor is artificially boosted. Like think of reading a guide on Invoker vs. going into it with no knowledge. You can dumb Invoker down quite a bit.  Anyway, my votes would be:   Invoker - requires a lot of prior knowledge to do anything useful with the hero Earth Spirit - confusing spells, lots of skill shots Chen - lots of micro required to use his core spell Meepo - lots of micro required for his core spell, skill shot in his Io - confusing spells to some extent, hard to do anything on your own as a novice, hard to use effectively (especially in a pub)   Some honorable mentions would be:   Any micro hero Any skill shot hero Shadow Demon, Bane, OD, Naga - lots of ability to fuck over your own team Oracle - minor ability to fuck over your own team   Skill Ceiling  This I would define as ""being able to get a disproportionately high amount of utility out of a hero with skill in using them"".  My votes here would be:   Tinker - can really take over games, need very fast fingers to maximize use of all the items he can pick up that have actives. Meepo - getting the blink combo down, as well as the global presence allows you to take over a game on your own. Earth Spirit - can dominate the early game, using remnants requires some foresight, huge amount of utility and versatility in his spells, lots of skill shots.   The other 2 I had a hard time deciding.  Honorable mentions:   Invoker - lots of spells, lots of versatility Magnus - good RPs and Skewers require some finesse Io - hard to work with other players, lots of tricks to Io's spells Oracle - can do a lot if you time things correctly Kunkka - 2 skill shots, Boat has a lot of applications and requires good positioning (i.e. the buff), X is a very versatile spell, Tidebringer needs good positioning Phoenix - knowing a little about how the spells interact can make you a lot more impactful (e.g. attack slows before Egg) Pudge - can take over a game, make game winning plays by landing hooks, self-deny can take some skill as well Nature's Prophet - movement around the map takes skill to be fully effective, lots of item choice decision, treants are versatile Lone Druid - basically microing two full heroes, lots of ways to utilize the bear, lots of item choice decisions   Maybe even TA and Slark belong there (for Psi Blades/Refraction and Dark Pact). Storm is another one where a good storm player can take over the game."
TrueDoTA2,3a5rut,Axosh,6,Wed Jun 17 17:52:44 2015 UTC,"Slark - generally considered a dumb pubstomper. But if you play him at a high level, using Dark Pact requires finesse or you will kill yourself.   I've been playing Slark almost exclusively since ""discovering"" him recently, and each game I feel I'm still discovering deeper elements and layers I didn't see before.  He is an extremely versatile and resilient hero that can play a number of different roles and positions interchangeably during a match.   Slark is powerful in the hands of someone who can read the match and knows how to react on a macro scale. He is a lot less micro-intensive than a lot of the others mentioned here (In saying that, Dark Pact is an extremely powerful and useful skill with the correct timing and micro). I believe he has a much higher skill ceiling than many people think, but It's harder to measure and define in comparison to visibly micro-intense heroes like Invoker"
TrueDoTA2,3a5rut,SharkApocalypse,9,Wed Jun 17 20:30:04 2015 UTC,"I think people over complicate Invoker massively.  I disagree with him being tops on either list.  Skill floor wise you could level just quas exort and go cold snap + forge spirits and win a good portion of games.  Every new Invoker wants to whip out meteor combos at level 6 that don't do anything.  Ceiling wise it's more or less a quick fingers practice which is way easier to learn than heroes that take tons of timing and context for every spell.  Maybe top 5 highest ceilings, but I'd definitely argue Meepo/Naga/Tinker/Chen/Storm are on the same level."
TrueDoTA2,3a5rut,Omar_Indeed,3,Wed Jun 17 15:24:17 2015 UTC,"I'm  not going to write 5 of them for either but I'll throw in something.  This    Sand King has an incredibly high skill cap. Being able to pull of a devastating epicenter is hard enough by itself, but on top of that, your reflexes are always checked with sandstorm/blink dodging and you often have the potential to hit 3+ heroes with his stun (but most people just hit 1-2).   Initiation is slightly underrated as part of how difficult things are to do. I find that heroes like Puck and Sand king who are super evasive and devastating, not to mention have extremely low cooldown for spells.  Compare this to Chen, he has about 10 minutes of micro early game and then his hero does a lot of different things, but usually will spend most of his time keeping creeps alive and only using 2-3 of the creep spells compared to no boots ganks and smokes without levels. The early micro is hard, even the stack farming can be, but the adrenaline of clicking as many buttons as say tinker is just too different. Heroes that do this from start to finish have it cut out for them."
TrueDoTA2,3a5rut,wildtarget13,2,Wed Jun 17 16:25:49 2015 UTC,Weaver is another hero that is you don't use your ult correctly or position well you just die. Similar idea to your guys. High risk high reward type hero. But that maybe is a better overall understanding of the game in general than just that hero. So IDK if that really is a hero skill cap as much as a player skill cap.

There is a lot of potential with poof micro and more that hasn't ever been realized (beyond the limits of human dexterity or whatever).    I do think Lone Druid belongs on the ceiling list.  Definitely ahead of Tinker, and maybe earth spirit.  In general I think micro heroes have to have the highest ceiling period in my mind.  With Chen for example, you have potentially 9(?) active abilities available to you at once, as well as potentially body blocking or stacking with multiple characters."

All you need to learn is his spells and invoke them and that can be done within a few matches against bots. Furthermore, the way Invoker is built, he has 2 main paths which he can be strong, QW and QE, so you don't even need to invoke that much and you will almost never go for the Dendi Aghs Refresher super combos anymore (which also isn't hard if you practice it a few times).  I guess technically Storm Spirit has one of the highest skill ceilings in the game since in theory he can dodge almost everything."
TrueDoTA2,3a5rut,genetalgiant,1 point,Wed Jun 17 17:26:35 2015 UTC,"My list would be:  Highest Skill Floors:   Io Earth Spirit Oracle Batrider Meepo (Honourable mentions go to Shadow Demon and Techies)   I dropped Invoker from the list because, as people pointed out already, he can be played effectively at lower levels by simply ignoring Invoke during teamfights and having two spells prepped beforehand.  I dropped Naga because she does not require much micro to play at lower levels (she's played basically like Chaos Knight).  Chen requires only a moderate level of micro and you aren't punished too hard for failed micro (unlike Meepo, with whom failed micro results in death).  Most of the heroes I picked here are not only bad at lower skill levels, but will be an active detriment to any team they're on.  Even at 4k, Io is almost never seen. Without proper itemisation, Io can do almost literally nothing. A poor Relocate can result in a truly awful situation when low skill players relocate their Tiny into a 2v5 situation (or out of a 5v5). Io also requires management of missing mana and health, micro of spirits, and keeping a position which is far from enemy damage but still in Tether range, all of which are hard for new (and experienced) players.  Earth Spirit is just a complicated hero. He needs to manage stone placement and the number of remaining stones. He can also pull and push allies which can put them out of position if used improperly.  Oracle requires advanced knowledge of game mechanics to play at all.  His W and E can both result in accidentally saving an enemy hero or killing an allied one.  Batrider is almost never seen all the way up to 4k (and never below 3k as I recall).  He requires team coordination and positioning to do his job, and a poor lasso which you didn't inform your team about can mean feeding the enemy team.  Meepo is Meepo. We all know he's hard to play.  Highest skill ceiling is harder to say, because we may not have reached the skill ceiling for many heroes. I feel like your list is okay, but Storm Spirit, Puck, Pheonix, and Tusk are four heroes who I feel are not given enough credit. Tusk especially has HUGE potential for both offensive and defensive plays once he has a blink dagger."
TrueDoTA2,3a5rut,dorox1,1 point,Wed Jun 17 18:13:58 2015 UTC,"Skill floor (in no particular order):   Invoker: you're more or less guaranteed to stumble around the first few games Meepo: you'll die a lot Earth Spirit: you actually won't do anything Io: you'll die a lot and not do anything Oracle: you'll most likely screw your team over far more than the enemy team   With Chen even if your micro sucks and you don't know the creep abilities you can still figure out what the hero does and do a little bit. The hero is relatively straightforward if you read your skill descriptions and the creep skill descriptions. With the heroes I consider to have the highest skill floor, even if you carefully read their abilities you still won't actually know what to do. Either they have complicated combos (Earth Spirit, Oracle), are extremely unforgiving (Io, Meepo), or in the case of Invoker it's hard to keep track of the spells and they're not that useful without being used in combination and are mostly skillshots.  Skill ceiling (again in no particular order):   Sand King: mastering Sand King is mastering positioning as well as taking advantage of his extreme elusiveness Puck: for similar reasons as Sand King Meepo: there's just so much you can do with this hero Tinker: this hero can do everything and be everywhere, as well as being mechanically very intensive Io: mastering Io requires staying alive despite all odds, perfect positioning, amazing timing and map awareness, and very good communication skills"

After that would be invoker for skill ceiling and floor.  Yes invoker is hard to play without being used to all his spells, but Chen and Earth spirits are huge messes unless you know how to even play the hero properly at all, let alone how to activate spells, which doesn't take much time especially if you have a sticky note or macro.  I wouldn't have Naga siren anywhere on a top 10 skill floor at all; it's absurd. Any simple carry type hero in no way has a high skill requirement to play mediocre.  Meepo is hard to figure out because when he's played at higher skill levels he's really easily countered, negating most of the skill involved in playing him. Overall he has a very high skill ceiling, but won't actually get much or any benefit from it unlike other heroes.  Meepo doesn't have a high skill floor. Crappy players can do fine with him as long as they know the proper items for him and to max poof. It's because he's a powerful pseudo-carry (non-lategame carry). At low skill levels players don't know how to deal with Meepo as well, and are oftentimes uncoordinated.  I'd definitely have Io up somewhere too, and possibly Visage, although the problem with Visage is that he's just bad hero in my opinion."

Why? because they work fine as a carry, and a pretty easy to use one at that.  Considering the difficulty of playing and the potential that some other heroes have, I wouldn't put Naga on the top 5 skill ceilings either. Probably not even the top 10. Sure they can give major benefits from players who can use them effectively, but that's the case for all sorts of heroes. All heroes benefit from having good gameplay sense and timing and coordination. Some have huge potential with significant use of complex mechanics, multitasking, quick reflexes, multiple actions in a short frame of time, and similar sorts of things. Naga doesn't have that stuff despite benefiting from skilled play.  What things about Visage do you think makes him a good hero? He's one of a very small list of heroes that I rarely ever see do particularly well despite occasional people picking him. I'm aware that he's rarely picked, but despite that every time he is picked it seems he does good, bad or mediocre, or terrible practically never really great, and still unnoticeable when good. Win rate stats somewhat reflect this. I'd admit they do get decent at top level play though, which isn't really any surprise since he is certainly a high skill hero to play."

Once you're level 6 and looking for kills, infest a mud golem and control it.  Go for a gank wherever you desire, and don't be too afraid to dive a tower as the creep will tank a lot of the shots.   Run up to the enemy and chuck a boulder at them, get close to them then and pop out in range of infest damage.  Use your open wounds, rage and micro your mini golems to throw the other two boulders in succession. Yes, you still control the mini golems after popping out of the main one.  Combine it all together and you've just done 1.8 seconds of stun (that is instantly cast and ranged) along with 525 magic damage, the enemy is slowed, and you're magic immune right next to them.

Silver Edge could be situational because of break and maim and all that, but a regular shadow blade is just not enough to justify getting it over armlet, basher or S&Y. You can use your ult for gap-closing instead, or buy some better mobility like S&Y or even Blink Dagger with much better results, that are also not easily counterable by a tower or sentry."
TrueDoTA2,3a51bp,itaShadd,1 point,Wed Jun 17 11:59:39 2015 UTC,"The biggest problem with lifestealer isn't his burst. It's finishing people off. It's because Feast does damage/heal based off of current HP, so you'll often see his targets get away at low HP.   Phase/Armlet really help out with that, as they add a ton of flat damage on top of his attacks. Being kited will always be a problem, so I really don't see the Shadow Blade helping out all that much."

Try to use your riptide according to illusions you send to waves in order to get last hits with the big damage hit.  Also give radiance/travels/manta/octarine a try. Octarine is a bit useful for the spell lifesteal but mostly it's used for the cooldown reductions and increased mana/mana regen to keep you on the map for longer. Manta/bots/mirror image with lower cooldowns makes you even more of a split pushing force."

This used to be my build in 6.83 when mid game mattered a bit more and there was the comeback mechanics rendering your farm a bit useless. What i did was, get an early bots, and push lanes, farm jungles and get an early diffusal . You play it like PL, split pushing and going for early pickoffs if you can and farming as much as possible. Cause with a lvl 2 diffusal and bots, its certainly not like radiance naga but you can farm a lane + ur jungle really fast. Use the diffusal charges and the net to kill off solo heroes cause diffusal gives a lot of damage and agility and at this stage unless the solo has like a huge aoe nuke, he cant man fight you easily unless you overextend. There's so much team fighting ability with diffusal + net imo and its definitely a build you should go if you think you're gonna get a late diffusal or if you think the enemy is gonna try to facerush / deathball you. Just remember to rat and farm lanes with bots as much as you can."
TrueDoTA2,3a4v2l,MisterJhones,1 point,Thu Jun 18 15:51:54 2015 UTC,"Mid naga is all about how you utilize your illusions. Such as, if your supports aren't stacking for you then you should be using every illusion cooldown effectively and be stacking with it. This can take some micro practice, but once you get it down you'll be miles ahead of the competition.  Another thing to take note on, when you go to farm the stacks you should be farming mid still as well. I typically bottle crow really hard when I go to clear stacks (typically at least 3+ stacks in each camp) and use two illusions to farm mid while main Naga +1 illusion are farming the camps. This is how we achieve pre 20min 600+ GPM on Naga.  The build is something we also adjust, while we do rush a Quelling (+ PMS)+ Bottle + Aquila + Boots we also take into consideration that we do not have a ganking mid laner therefore you need to make up for it by being strong at something else. I typically rush straight into Skadi & Diffusal after Radiance, BoTs & Manta as a mid Naga so that I'm able to keep the enemy busy or just straight up kill their supports with illusions. Your typical Radiance + Manta + Butterfly build is no longer the most prized build especially since heroes like Gyro are contested picks that are able to easily deal with Naga & her illusions naturally."
TrueDoTA2,3a2x6p,DodoStek,24,Tue Jun 16 20:26:32 2015 UTC,"When you put a hero in the offlane (especially solo), you're  looking for one or more of the following:   Survivability Slowing down carry's farm Keeping the attention of the enemy supports Ability to get farm and/or levels Ability to rotate and/or provide utility   Strategy/Decision Making  Fissure block will force the waves to clash under your tower where you can get farm and XP.  However, they can stack and pull to prevent this.  If you Fissure Block, the other team is forced into the decision:   Let you have your farm/XP ==> allow their supports to roam more and do other things Chain Pull ==> control lane   ES in the Offlane  Even if they do chain pull, you can still do a lot because of how long range fissure is (i.e. farm poorly from a distance, fuck with the pull, aggro the Radiant Offlane pull-camp).  Fissure is also a really powerful tool in general - you can single out heroes and get kills, you can Fissure to escape, or whatever.  ES can be similar to Spirit Breaker offlane in some ways (depending on how he is utilized). He mostly wants levels, then rotates for kills (and gets farm that way). ES is a hero where you could rotate around a bit, help control runes, and then make up for farm via rotations."
TrueDoTA2,3a2x6p,Axosh,4,Tue Jun 16 21:07:31 2015 UTC,My guess is that since Shaker is a really poor farmer until he gets Level 7+ by putting him in the offlane it helps him get levels faster. You can farm decently with max'ed fissure and the sooner he has L7 the quicker he can get his blink dagger up.                He can use the fissure block to pull back the lane and get xp sort of like Clockwerk does (except for its more expensive mana cost).

You gett what ever xp you can and make the carries life mis with your q spam. You can even get solo kills with your R if supports have rotated elsewhere.

He has one of the highest strength gains and won't die easily with appropriate starting items.  He also falls into a list of offlaners that can gank mid if he can't stand in lane.   If you rush a soul ring, you have enough mana to fissure every wave and pull the creep equilibrium back to your tower. 30 second CD on soul ring.   With a stupid max totem sort of build with 1-1-1 by three you can do some funny things.  But hey, sometimes the max fissure is what you want for more fissures and less fissure stun duration."

TrueDoTA2,3a1w7l,fenderbr0,12,Tue Jun 16 16:12:38 2015 UTC,"Early mistake I made with Storm is not realizing 3 things:   Mana = HP on storm. As long as you have the mana to zip up hills and across chasms you can be immortal.  Zipping huge gaps is typically a bad idea. Starting a big fight without mana is an easy way to die. Mana regen > Mana pool, zip does a % of mana not raw amount."

TrueDoTA2,3a1w7l,christoosss,4,Tue Jun 16 17:15:47 2015 UTC,"Both take a lot of practice to get used. I think of the two,  storm is the harder one. You can't play around refraction and you need to consider your mana pool all the time. TA has a lot more room for errors given refraction. But TA has a lot of different item builds that work on her. A Storm usually goes treads to Orchid to bloodstone to a bkb/linkens. The item build rarely changes unless you switch Orchid and bloodstone around. It's  because those two items are almost necessary on storm since they're so good on him. TA on the other hand has a lot more room to play with in terms of itemization so you need to take that into account. Are you going for a mid game or late game build? Contrary to what people think,  TA is a strong late game hero with the items especially if there aren't many spells to remove refraction.  Treads or phase? Blink or drums? Deso or SnY? Do you need MKB? Do you need BKB? Perhaps a manta to disjoint spells? There's a lot of different ways to build TA and you gotta make sure it is suitable for the matchup. Beyond that, a common misconception for these two heroes is that they need to gank at level 6. This is a terrible mindset to have. Your goal for these two heroes is to secure farm by dominating your lane until mid game where you kill everybody and snowball from there. Unless you have a haste or dd or you are absolutely sure you can kill one or two heroes in the lane you're ganking, don't do it. Just farm away. I'd say once you get blink on TA and Orchid on storm is when you should start moving around the map. Remember these two are very strong in lane as well so you should deny the enemy mid of as much exp and gold as possible. Unless you are hard countered (e.g. Leshrac with edict against TA or Lina against storm before zip) then you should look to be aggresive and constantly harass the enemy midlaner. Another trap you should remember is to take objectives with these two heroes. A lot of people tend to forget about towers and instead focus on getting kills. And yes while a 12-0 storm is nice,  you need to remember that towers are more important. Deny the enemy of vision and map control and the pickoffs become easier. Not to mention that if you throw away your 12-0 streak, that's a lot of gold. Taking objectives goes hand in hand with early aggression. The name of the game should be mid game dominance with these two heroes. They are pretty good late game (especially TA) but it allows enemy heroes to get orchids or abyssals etc. You don't wanna risk going to the late game when these two heroes crush most heroes mid game. Good luck."

TrueDoTA2,3a1w7l,Snowd3vil,1 point,Tue Jun 16 17:01:09 2015 UTC,"Play like 10-15 bot matches to get comfortable with storm's combo vs. Mana usage. Learn that basically any combination of his skill can be turned into a great combo, but you HAVE to right click between every skill or your burst damage is shit. Don't jump across huge gaps until you have at least 1 big mana item (preferably regen vs. Raw mana) or you are ganking a single squishy hero and you know where his team is. Rune control is paramount, if the runes are gone there is no shame in going to base, this hero needs to base a lot for mana. If anyone on your team finds a regen rune, MAKE THEM PROTECT IT FOR YOU. Regen rune = infinite ball lightning, but don't go all the way to 0 mana or the regen will end. Just run for a few seconds and jump 1000 units every few seconds looking for a fight, scouting or getting into position. It's even great for farming melee camps for free, you can do ranged camps but they're tricky since its easier for them to hit you."

The first type includes Naga,AM,Alch and so on. They can farm really fast and stay ahead of the curve, but will fall off in a 6slotVS6slot scenario.  The steroid carries include Void, Spectre,Luna,PA and so on.  Void for example has a Basher+Butterfly that works on magic right off the bat. This effectively means that in a 6slot 1v1 scenario vs, say, Leshrac he can have 8 items to his 6.  AM does have a considerable magic resistance boost and a diffusal, but lacks the hard lockdown/evasion of the true hard carries. He compensates by farming much faster  Edit: forgot a paragraph"

TrueDoTA2,3a10ow,red_nick,11,Tue Jun 16 13:13:22 2015 UTC,"I think your last few questions get to the core of the issue. AM is not an all-purpose, every game carry i.e. Troll/Sniper/Jugg of last patch and Lesh, SF this patch.   I think AM is best picked when the other team is weak in disables, has already picked their offlane or utilizes magic damage/mana carries (Lesh, Storm, QoP, Lina, etc.).   Lack of Disables- Obviously a pro. If they're not rich in hexes, stuns and silences they're not going to be able to touch you. No lockdown means AM has free reign to split push more aggressively and blink right into people in fights. This is one of the best reasons to pick AM.  Magic/Mana carries- Carries like these are inherently weak vs. AM for two primary reasons. First, spell shield makes these kind of heroes weak by nature vs. AM. He's not going to be bursted down with just spells like many of his counterparts. Second, mana void has the potential to absolutely shred these heroes. You can ult a half mana Storm/DS/QoP/Lesh and nearly blow them up from full HP. The only danger of some Int/Magic carries is if they snowball incredibly hard and pick up items like orchid/hex before you're close to manta. QoP/Storm have the potential to shut AM down if they steamroll their mid matchup. You have to keep a close eye on these heroes so you can know when/if they're going disable first and react accordingly (play more defensive vs. quick orchids/hexes, play aggressive if they go Bloodstone/Aghs/etc.)  Already picked an offlane- If you can accurately predict what hero(es) the other team plans to play in the offlane you can more accurately judge whether it's an AM game. Getting shut down in the first 10-15 can end the game for an AM, so picking into an obvious aggressive tri lane that you know you won't get more than a handful of CS is dangerous. Similarly, if you pick AM after they've got nothing more than an Earthshaker/Magnus/Nyx/NP/Beast/whatever hero that simply can't lane against an AM, you can effectively win the game in the first 10 to 15 minutes purely based on a solid battlefury timing (if that's the route you go).  There are also some carries that AM is naturally a pretty good pick against. First to mind are Medusa/Leshrac/Wraith King/insert mana starved carry. Though, early counterpicking can result in getting counterpicked yourself, so if you're going to select based off of an early pick Medusa, wait until the fourth or fifth pick and ensure they won't have 4 other heroes that laugh at AM.   Predictably, AM is pretty strong with lineups that can defend without him for a while. KotL is especially strong, with illuminate and recall to bring him back abruptly from split pushing. WW is also good for delaying pushes by tossing nukes from far away to pull creeps off towers, he also is great for saving an AM when he blinks a bit too aggressively. He's also great with heroes that serve as good distractions--in fights and on the map--as any attention drawn off of AM can be free towers.Think Timbersaw, Invoker, Clockwerk, DK, and others.   Overall AM is in a pretty solid place right now. He can be played in a good amount of situations and is pretty fun to play."
TrueDoTA2,3a10ow,Grey_NunSei,2,Tue Jun 16 12:54:05 2015 UTC,Thanks for the in-depth explanation! I'll totally try to improve my play!
TrueDoTA2,3a10ow,pepe_le_shoe,2,Tue Jun 16 13:12:29 2015 UTC,He's kind of like brood: you only pick him when you notice that the enemy draft had nothing to deal with you.
TrueDoTA2,3a10ow,flaminglawyer,3,Tue Jun 16 21:25:51 2015 UTC,"You should pick AM against an enemy team that has heroes with massive mana pools and high mana costs: Shadow Shaman, Skywrath Mage, Invoker; or carries that are easy to manage when they have no mana: Slark, Wraith King or Medusa.  If you have good supports and are not ganked too much you will have BF at minute 13-14 with brown boots. If you are freefarming and no one tries to kill you you can get it even sooner. Finish boots, farm whatever items fit vs enemy team: Manta for silences, Basher/Abyssal for lockdown, Vlads for Roshan on your own, Tarrasque for long teamfights, MKB to counter evasion, Butterfly if they don't have good MKB carries and so on.  Around 30 minutes you will have boots, BF and 2-3 more items. If you are playing PvE for 30 minutes your team will probably have already lost, so carry a TP and try to help in teamfights. Your ""Typical AM teamfight contribution"" (before 30 min) should be to go in when their supports have used most of their mana, hit them a bit, ult and then blink away to farm more. When you have your items (after 30 min) you should have an advantage over their carries. Use that advantage to get Roshan, then push and get rax.  Most of your games will not be as easy as I described, but the general idea you should get from this is that PvE for 30 minutes it's not viable, you should help whenever you can. If you don't have Manta yet and they go 5 pushing try to get towers yourself, force TPs, and go back to defend if they get to your T3."
TrueDoTA2,3a10ow,pepe_le_shoe,3,Tue Jun 16 13:11:52 2015 UTC,"You pick him as a carry only when your team can handle 4v5, AND the enemy team can't handle your split push.  If either of those aren't true, he's a bad choice."
TrueDoTA2,3a10ow,Aesyn,1 point,Tue Jun 16 13:54:25 2015 UTC,"This exactly. Unfortunately, this patch, 99% of drafts are NOT AM games. In previous patches, there was a lot more potential for a team to 4v5 competently while you peacefully farm. Nowadays if your team tries to 4v5 the enemy team will just wreck you with stun-heavy lineups and early aggression, even in pubs they have gotten way better at this since early-midgame aggerssion heros are ""in"" right now (Lesh, etc). But this patch is absolutely NOT a patch where you can first-pick AM in ranked matchmaking and have any hope of winning the game. A halfway competent bloodseeker is all it takes to completely remove your impact from the game."
TrueDoTA2,3a10ow,wildtarget13,1 point,Wed Jun 17 08:13:39 2015 UTC,"Also, you can't pick him any time except last pick, because he's easily countered by picking like, >50% of heroes who are stronger in the early game."
TrueDoTA2,3a10ow,unr4v3l,2,Wed Jun 17 08:17:29 2015 UTC,"Your comments in the thread got unnecessarily downvoted IMO, I get your point.   I play PvE and farm for 30 mins, my team is decent but can't handle 4v5, game snowballs, we get rekt even when I start joining fights.   From anecdotal experience, this happens when your team is kinda low on crowd controlling options. When you are gonna pick AM, make sure you have better than average crowd control in the team because you bring none yourself. Otherwise, you'll be in a team where nobody wants to jump in first, nobody can charge and facetank (because they fought 4v5 early and they are kinda behind compared to enemy). You'll just get focused down when you try to fight.  Also try to avoid a team of kiters(lots of slows stuns, skills like shadow demon disrupt, cold embrace etc...). And maybe pick someone else if they consist of several heavy physical damage dealers. But even in these situations you can manage to win, the only thing absolutely necessary IMO is an array of lockdown in your team.   Huge disables like Ravage helps immensely because you can 100 to 0 some squishy during that, and play the teamfight from there.  All in all, why AM feels mostly useless to you is because he needs a certain team revolves around him. A thing you come across not so commonly in pubs.  last note: A good AM play definitely starts from being able to farm really fast. I'm generally happy with myself when I land Treads+BF+Manta around 20 minutes, but a little later is ok too. Preferably you should have 1 and half big item more at 30 minutes. 5 slotted at 30 minutes is a great result. 6 slotted at 30 minutes really requires a great teamplay (stacking supports, perfect space making)."
TrueDoTA2,3a10ow,mjjdota,2,Tue Jun 16 13:24:02 2015 UTC,"I think that AM is underutilized if he needs to fight early game. His strength as an early mid game farmer is unmatched, save a few.   But realizing when you can show up to fight and skip Battlefury is important.   The goal of getting a manta style instead of Battlefury should be your default. Getting a late Battlefury when you need to fight usually is what loses games.   Treads+ Vlads + quelling to farm slowly is an option. Also multiple levels in stats is mandatory, something many players in pubs neglect.   I think an option for antimage is solar crest build up. A casual medallion before finishing manta.   If you have stat levels, a 50% to Solar's 75% mana regen can make up for the lack of naked Battlefury mana regen. It also allows your team to roshan easier, earlier, and faster.   You can detach solar crest for a butterfly, and neglect that if they start building MKBs.   Mana burn is physical so a manta+solar crest timing allows strong single target allowing antimage to solo kill much easier than a Battlefury timing. Not to mention earlier armor and evasion saves antimage from dying while farming, at the cost of less damage for farming.   But many games, people need to realize that staying alive with HP and resistances is the best farm accelerator."
TrueDoTA2,3a10ow,mjjdota,1 point,Tue Jun 16 16:08:05 2015 UTC,"I would pick AM against mana heavy heroes preferably carry role (WK, Slark, Medusa). Lesh is a bit tricky. I can also consider AM if enemies' team is low on lockdown (stun, disruption, etc)  Actually in early game your AM can still contribute to teamfight by doing something like farming near the tower, or carry tp. Then when the fight starts you wait until the enemies have used most of their stun/nuke abilites, walk in and hit one of their squishy hero, then blink away when people start to focus you. Rinse and repeat. Don't die.  If you PvE chance is the enemies will stack up more items to make your right click useless (Ghost scepter, Eul, Vyse), so don't do that. Try to kill towers asap to draw enemies' attention to defend base while your team gets other objectives, or try to participate in opportunistic teamfights with the style I mention above.  Usually once you got yourself a second damage item (Manta/Basher/MKB etc, BF is your first) and BKB you can now become the frontliner in teamfight.  If you see that they are attacking your tower (t2, t3) and you know you can't defend, go push other lanes or cut several creep waves of the lane the enemies are pushing. It makes them unable to take down tower without creeps."
TrueDoTA2,3a10ow,Axosh,1 point,Tue Jun 16 15:32:05 2015 UTC,"Antimage Invoker. Antimage has very little control, invoker has it in spades. Acts as an initiator, playmaker, and EMP gives you free huge mana voids. Nyx Assassin. Gives you map control, disable, burst (QW invoker lacks burst) and mana burn again synergizes with mana void. Lion. Gives you disable, initiation, early game roam, burst, and mana drain synergizes with mana void. KotL. Gives you turtle to help buy AM time, map presence (recall lets AM jungle freely before fights) and chakra magic is very strong on everyone except AM. Illuminate can combo decently with Invoker and Lion. Mana leak synergizes with mana void.   Pick this team against   Heroes that are very weak to mana burn effects (become useless without mana) eg. Medusa, Wraith King, strength casters like ES, Brewmaster, Ogre Magi. Heroes with enormous mana pools / intelligence that are vulnerable to high damage Mana Voids and Mana Burns, eg. Pugna, CM, Lina, Tinker."
TrueDoTA2,3a10ow,Axosh,2,Tue Jun 16 16:18:05 2015 UTC,"Oh it's the MJJ himself! Seems like a solid draft, my only concern with draft would be that there isn't really a tanky frontliner so if you mess up your engagement or if the enemy team has strong engages, you might be in trouble.   Also I'd like to add that KotL+Lion really seems like the ultimate support duo to pair with AM. Great depush, early game presence, deleting mana, mana to sustain the team and control which AM lacks. Will totally use this!  Also would like to add that Im an avid reader of /r/captainsmode, even though Im not a really good player yet x)"
TrueDoTA2,3a10ow,Skyro620,1 point,Tue Jun 16 17:59:16 2015 UTC,"Glad you like the sub! Show us a draft sometime if you'd like!  Indeed a good note that the mentioned lineup will struggle when jumped on; definitely important for it to own the initiations.  KotL is such a strong hero right now, and I'd love to fit him into more drafts. His lack of offensive utility in the early game (no disable) makes him a little situational, but put in the right spot he's a quiet nightmare to deal with."
TrueDoTA2,3a10ow,sanitygod,1 point,Tue Jun 16 21:59:46 2015 UTC,"For AM, you need to get your core items faster than their core can get theirs. That's the basic concept around him. He isn't the hardest of carries, but if you get the right setup, you peak before them (usually hitting critical mass around 40-ish minutes).  What you want is:   Good laning phase Time to farm jungle   Stacks from supports help here  Go ham   What you need is:   At least one support that can zone the offlaner and control the lane for you Heroes that can 4v5 and/or make space (you can also rotate into fights when you know there is a high chance for gain). Heroes that can control movement in team fights   Builds  If you watch a lot of Burning/Black you'll see there are a lot of tweaks you can make to your build. Both of them regularly do a build like 1-1-1 + stats (if I remember this correctly). The items tend to be Bfury => Yasha => Vlads/Manta, but there are other ways to build him out. Vlads rush is sometimes what you need to do. There is also early Vanguard when you know you need to fight. But ideally, you don't pick him into situations where you cannot go the cookie-cutter build.  Pubs  If you want to choose AM, telegraph it early so your team can pick around it (it's often met with reluctance).  If they don't pick around it, then choose something else. You could view it as a good learning exercise, but it is going to be a bitch to lane and you will likely lose.   In which situations you would want to run AM instead of any other carry?   IMO, kind of a pick where you have some mix of these elements in the draft:   They want to go late (e.g. they pick a Spectre or something)   AM wants to go late-ish, but he wants to get there before the other carry  They lack lockdown for AM (or only have silence -- which you can handle with Manta/BKB) You have a strong safe lane / they have an offlane that cannot pressure you much You have access to jungle farm (especially stacks) They have heroes that mana burn hurts a lot They have heroes with massive mana pools that your ult will wreck They lack mobility / your team can control their mobility   AM is fast, but melee. He needs to be able to just auto attack heroes"

TrueDoTA2,3a10ow,SupALupRT,1 point,Tue Jun 16 18:08:31 2015 UTC,"No problem.  There are a few ways I can think of:   DotaFlame - it's a website that tracks high level twitch streams and categorizes them by player, hero, etc. (good for finding high level pub AM) DatDota - it's the stats website for pro matches. You can query it for drafts including Anti-Mage and then find replays in game or on youtube Dotabuff    it has an esports section. Cannot remember if you can lookup games by draft or not though You can also go to the hero tab and on the right-hand side there are ""top"" players. You can look up their recent match IDs inside Dota (Watch Tab ==> Recent ==> Write in the match ID)"
TrueDoTA2,3a10ow,UNBR34K4BL3,1 point,Tue Jun 16 18:40:50 2015 UTC,"The main thing is you really have to maximize your split push pressure after the laning phase. This means if you see the enemy team grouping up and pushing a lane you don't want to be dicking around in the jungle for instance, try to get as much damage on towers as possible. While focusing on timings is ok to track improvement, when playing an actual game you have to have the game sense to know what is going to ultimately help your team the most.  Your team also needs to know trading towers early is fine, the goal should be not to feed and just try to delay the push as much as possible. The same goes for you, e.g. say you trade T1 towers and they are pushing T2 towers, you can go and intercept the creepwave behind the push and take advantage of backdoor protection.  Lastly AM can fight early but you have to be very aware of AM's capabilities and the enemy's capabilities. A common example could be an enemy team pushing and then 1 of them TPs back to defend your split push. You can then TP to help defend the push and outnumber your opponent.  When fighting early you have to be extra patient and Blink in when the team has used their critical cooldowns. Slasher-style Urn on AM is quite good for early fighting allowing you to Blink out and heal and Blink back into fights. Manta is when AM's killing potential skyrockets, but he'll still be squishy. Again, patience and key here until you get your Heart."
TrueDoTA2,3a10ow,UNBR34K4BL3,1 point,Tue Jun 16 17:21:38 2015 UTC,"You have one choice if you're drafting an AM, pick a 4 man lineup that has great early-mid presence and can fight like a motherfucker.   AM lives on an island until he has BFury, Manta, Vlads."
TrueDoTA2,3a10ow,thundrfang,1 point,Wed Jun 17 01:18:08 2015 UTC,"Slahser's way! He had the same problems as you: farm a Battlefury and hope your team doesn't lose 4 v 5, or that you get outcarried. So instead he goes a fighting AM with urn, choosing to have an early direct impact on the game. He even talks about the potential gpm loss from not going the traditional build.   I've personally never done it, but give it a go. If it doesn't work, then whatever, but if it proves to be fun/effective for you then you have a new tool and a way of making Andy work. Just let your team mates know beforehand that's what you're doing because a lot of people won't be comfortable with anything that isn't Battlefury ( > Vlads) > Manta > Heart/Abyssal/Butterfly."
TrueDoTA2,3a10ow,dootdootskeleton,1 point,Thu Jun 18 17:14:33 2015 UTC,You need vanguard this patch.  AM is a severely underrated early fighter with it.  It gives you the durability to join team fights and cause a ruckus with just a pt in spell shield.  if you rush it and get it like 6-7 min you can completely bully whatever hero is in your lane.  3500 bracket it for reference.
TrueDoTA2,3a10ow,KittenKidd,-4,Sat Jun 27 13:00:36 2015 UTC,Have you considered getting involved before 45 minutes?   Shocking I know.

TrueDoTA2,3a10ow,KittenKidd,3,Tue Jun 16 12:49:27 2015 UTC,"I just mean, you should be getting involved a lot earlier.  Mana void is one of the best kill-secure abilities on a carry.  Even before battlefury it can be worth TPing across the map to secure a kill, then you can farm that lane for a bit before wandering back to the safe lane."
TrueDoTA2,3a3i1q,TheMoeBlob,37,Tue Jun 16 22:59:00 2015 UTC,"Put up aggressive wards so that their natural instinct to go for kills will overcome their desire to farm.  After a successful gank, spam ping your objective of choice and say stuff like ""its 5v3 free tower!"" Or ""their carry is dead take free rosh"" be sure to emphasize that it is free, greedy players love free things even if its an objective like rax or throne."
TrueDoTA2,3a3i1q,UNBR34K4BL3,16,Tue Jun 16 23:17:50 2015 UTC,"Just to add: Remember that you are talking to an idiot, they can't be belittled or reasoned with, otherwise they will become worse than useless.  Being the one to buy wards is important. It's common sense outside Dota to avoid putting up resources when others refuse to contribute but every team needs that first person to break the dam.   Draw on the mini-map. Nothing brings dysfunctional team together like a penis going up the mid lane and squirting the enemy base."
TrueDoTA2,3a3i1q,captainburnz,2,Wed Jun 17 03:27:58 2015 UTC,"A great side effect of this is that buying wards while you're a core may make the supports actually buy wards because they suddenly realized that if the core is buying wards, he not be retarded and he's the one doing the job at their place."

I just think the fundamental changes to the game should just happen in order to expand the amount of possible viable strategies and then balance heroes around that.  I mean, we already have a game with a ton of heroes and items, wouldn't it be beautiful if they were all truly viable to some extent?   If, for instance, at some point we'd stop seeing leshrac being picked/banned every game just because the players adapted from this trend and not because icefrog shook things up and now heavy magic damage strats are not viable anymore (like it is the case now for hard carries for example).

The biggest problem is that Dota has no goal in terms of balance. It is pretty obvious now that big daddy Valve have alot of creative control and want to keep people playing this game to milk every cent they can out of peoples wallets and having a stable game with minor adjustments every few months may deter enough people that it becomes a problem.

Being ""aggressive"" and deathballing, and being ""defensive"" and 4 protect 1/turtle strat.  In a perfect world, split push would be a more viable strategy again, which would restore the ""balance"" between Aggressive, Defensive and Split Push strategies (each one is countered by another one in the triangle)."
TrueDoTA2,3a36ye,Fortune_451,4,Tue Jun 16 21:48:23 2015 UTC,"I think this is a very sweet spot. This patch is beautiful. Hopefully Icefrog thinks so. Regardless, I'm so glad this TI will use this patch. [please let it]"
TrueDoTA2,3a36ye,darren_kill,2,Wed Jun 17 06:55:13 2015 UTC,"I agree to some extent that a completely balanced game would be ideal for competitive and would actually make the game have a lasting legacy.  Look at sports where rules barely change year to year, the guys who were good 4-5 years ago are still good and the only way you can be better than them is to beat them in the current game. It forces strategies to evolve and adapt specifically to their own skill levels, not simply doing whatever is flavour of the month.  I used to play age of empires 2 a few years ago, and the competitive scene for that is great. It was balanced years ago and since hasn't really been touched. So in order for you to beat your opponent, you're not picking an imbalanced civ (or hero) to dominate the entire game, you're choosing to outplay them in your own style in order to win.  With the high frequency and power creep in Dota patches, every few months you have some OP heroes in every game which require some incredibly hard countering if you want to win, which is required from before the game even begins, forcing you to play their style without even allowing you to have much say in your team's lineup if you want to win. But given that Valve wants Dota to stay relevant so they can continue making revenue that's not going to happen, so instead we're going to get this semi-beta grade game every few months until its patched and rebalanced in the hope of making it better"
TrueDoTA2,3a36ye,XyfDota,1 point,Wed Jun 17 06:48:09 2015 UTC,"This is exactly what I think. Give a chance for the meta to evolve on its own, and not just, from time to time, throw the dice and see what happens.   My hopes are they are just experimenting to find this sweet place where the game becomes more like a traditional sport and just rebalance things when really necessary, like with the introduction of new heroes or new  items.   Don't get me wrong, I like the current patch very much, I just they should freeze the meta for some time and fine tune heroes around the way things are right now."
TrueDoTA2,3a36ye,Harlequeens,1 point,Wed Jun 17 12:26:24 2015 UTC,Meta game changes are typically to balance out the rock-paper-scissors that is push-gank-farm. After deathball of TI4 pushing got nerfed. Then farming became popular so creeps got nerfed. Meanwhile he has been steadily buffed ganking. But hero and item changes also effect the meta.  The meta swings have been pretty violent in the last year. Due in part to the slight heavy handedness of recent changes. But also because dota is a lot more competitive and players in pubs and pros jump on strategies faster and then grind them until they are nerfed or a new strategy comes along.
TrueDoTA2,3a36ye,pepe_le_shoe,1 point,Tue Jun 16 22:24:11 2015 UTC,"I think this is an incredibly dense subject with an endless array of caveats. There will always be certain trends/heroes/tactics viewed as generally superior to their alternatives; the health of the game shouldn't suffer with the rise and fall of FotM heroes as long as one specific strategy or another doesn't become overtly dominant, i.e. 6.83's Sniper turtle lineups."
TrueDoTA2,3a36ye,DeanofDeeps,0,Wed Jun 17 01:45:57 2015 UTC,"Balancing a game is hard, especially one where you're constantly introducing new things.  Game is beta, settle in man."

TrueDoTA2,3a0i41,peachypoots,5,Tue Jun 16 07:13:34 2015 UTC,"I'm highly against skipping blink on enigma. The weird thing about enigma is most games need a Mek carrier. But even blink rush has its rare situations.   Skipping blink after Mek is also situationally fine. But once you have BKB, you should get blink, it's kind of out of the question.   The walk up and force people to try to focus you so he dies before black hole bait doesn't work once the enemy has farm.  It also is only strong when eidolons aren't as easily killed by maxed nukes.   If your game is at the point where a enigma has core level farm and starts hitting a building and they can't kill him and his team, then he doesn't need to blink initiate. Some games you might glimmer or shadow blade if you feel fun."

TrueDoTA2,3a0i41,wildtarget13,2,Tue Jun 16 14:22:09 2015 UTC,I meant like Enigma will almost always have as much farm as a core because of how fast he farms.
TrueDoTA2,3a0i41,TheAwesomeHNH,1 point,Tue Jun 16 16:10:24 2015 UTC,"It's rare you'll offlane him, especially in pubs.  Although it's fun to do so.   I know how fast he farms, but enigma is really effective with even a super late blink+bkb+ one survivability item like pipe or Mek.   I only suggest he's definitely a support role rather than a core.   I also don't need items to farm him. Enigma is up there with Chen enchant in how he doesn't need starting items badly. 3 clarifies and a tango is all you need. Enigmas starting soul ring recipe rush or basilius need to calm themselves."
TrueDoTA2,3a0i41,wildtarget13,2,Tue Jun 16 16:14:49 2015 UTC,"I think one game is way too small of a sample size to draw conclusions from. For example, if your team was ahead most of the game (I don't know if this was the case or not), then skipping Blink/BKB could be fine because you would never be in a situation where you needed a BKB & Blink Black Hole to win a team fight (echoing /u/wildtarget13). Maybe link the Dotabuff for the game?"

The soul ring will be stronger than a perseverance.   I haven't done greaves enigma, but honestly, jungle farming for huge amounts of gold is weaker now. I still feel treads are worth it and tried and true. Even though greaves can still be upgraded with treads, the timing of 8 STR with treads isn't replaceable except for maybe ogre club for BKB"

Some options are better for viewers, others are better for the tournament organization, others are better for the competition. It all depends on what the tournament organizers feel is the best for their situation. Sometimes the organizers have a bias towards an ""even footing"" grand finals since it's the easiest one for the viewers to understand and it has the most potential games (run more ads, build more hype, less chance of an anti-climactic ending). Sometimes they have a bias towards giving a upper bracket winner advantage because they are catering towards the competitors rather than the viewership (happens when organizers are run by former competitors).   You'll notice that nothing I said is specific to DOTA because this problem has been debated endlessly for many sports and esports. The conclusion is just that it's totally up to the organizers and nobody can objectively state that one format is better or worse than other because it completely depends on your perspective."
TrueDoTA2,39xzie,jookz,5,Mon Jun 15 18:47:07 2015 UTC,"It's damaging to credibility with the audience to have the most important series of a tournament be played as if the underdog forfeited a match.  If you win through the winner's bracket then you should be the favorite to win even without an advantage.  What would people think if the higher rated team in baseball got to start the world series one game up on their opponent?  I'm all for a ""home court"" style advantage, i.e. the WB finalist gets to first pick side/draft order for 3/5 of the games.  Anything more unduly biases the result of the series."
TrueDoTA2,39xzie,j0a3k,3,Mon Jun 15 22:33:03 2015 UTC,"Personally I agree with that, I was just listing some reasons why tournaments might disagree.   The last time I saw a major backlash against a grand finals format was in SC2 WOL days when MLG (I think?) ran a winner's advantage in the grand finals. So it was like a best of 7 but the upper bracket winner only had to win 2 games and the lower bracket winner had to win 4. This is huge in SC2 because basically the person with the advantage has 2 ""no risk"" games where they can just do some cheesy all-in strat."

I hate the fact that the no loss team in GF gets no advantage, but anything I've thought of seems either extremely under or overwhelming. Things like pick time modifications, choice of radiant/dire, and starting with a W/L all seem like bad options.   Edit: maybe give them extra pick time and side choice first game?

TrueDoTA2,39yc4i,wildtarget13,6,Mon Jun 15 20:05:37 2015 UTC,"The reasoning for the lightning max besides the low cool down is that its great for all things mid lane. Some push for better rune control, easy last hitting, harass, and a low CD/Mana spell. Edict is very random in its damage around creeps and really needs to be high level with no enemy creeps to do any damage to towers.  Some great match ups for Lesh is any melee or short ranged heroes. Some terrible lane match ups are Viper with max corrosive skin/ a better slow than lightning. TA requires you to change your build from lightning to edict as Refraction not blocking. Pugna for his ward, and any nuker. Huskar is his bane with his magic resist and Lesh's horrific right click. Lifestealer is also horrible if you are not able to cancel animations as a good Lifestealer will just rage when your stun is going off. Good luck getting away then. Same for Slark with Dark pact."
TrueDoTA2,39yc4i,Pentt41207,2,Mon Jun 15 20:26:05 2015 UTC,"I'd say Huskar isn't an awful matchup, it just forces you to skill Edict instead, as it's physical damage, not magical."
TrueDoTA2,39yc4i,thundrfang,3,Tue Jun 16 18:13:31 2015 UTC,"Storm has to farm as much as possible until level 3, then basically sit back and lose the lane until level 6. Lesh combo wrecks him. At level six you can go for a kill but it's tricky, you need to dodge the stun by rolling.   Same story with QOP, she's a little stronger than storm so the opportunity is there to outplay the lesh - if lesh misses the stun, for instance, qop can kill him, but this matchup is heavily lesh favoured until 6.   I don't play SF very much, but I think this one is probably a draw. SF can farm some souls in the early levels, and then at level 3 both start to spam out the waves without really getting in danger of dieing.   Lesh is weak to ganks and sadly that's the only way to deal with him for a lot of mid heros. He's a lane dominator this patch that not many can deal with early on. If you're facing him with a hero that isn't great against him, you have to always keep in mind that if you go below 550 hp and he lands a lightning on you, you're dead, so play around that."

TrueDoTA2,39yc4i,Jackolope,3,Tue Jun 16 13:35:53 2015 UTC,"Leshrac is scary to lane against mid if you have no range or ways to farm. Another build I have been running is no stun. The thing about edict builds is no one will fuck with your runes and you can deal with ganks easier then trying to use your slow stun, provided you know the range of edict. If leshrac loses rune control,  early game can spiral out in control for him. He can only cast about 5 spells before he's dry on mana and needs a rune or arcanes. If you choose QoP and play perfectly,  you can be a nightmare for a leshrac on mid. Your ability to blink in and out of situations and harass with shadow strike will be invaluable. Leshrac is about establishing control and maintaining your health and mana.  Take these things away,  leshrac has little options left."
TrueDoTA2,39yc4i,ming3r,2,Tue Jun 16 19:51:51 2015 UTC,Blitz did a very good video 1-2 days ago where he talked through a storm game against lesh. Probably very specific but good insight for it and shutting him down.
TrueDoTA2,39yc4i,mriswith-,2,Tue Jun 16 05:50:39 2015 UTC,"Thanks for this, biggest takeaway for me on this one was to skimp a bit more on starting items to get bottle faster.

BoTS become a stronger picker pick-up when:   You're losing towers quickly, because they make up for the loss in TP mobility. You have allies who can ""create"" TP targets (such as Beastmaster Hawk) or offer TP synergy (such as Chen ""send-back"" or Kunkka's ""X-Marks""). You have the ability to quickly turn a gank on an ally. PL isn't the greatest at this, but (as an example) if you're getting terrorized by a solo Spirit Breaker, the BoTS will allow you to generally turn it into a 2v1 if he goes on your ally. You want the option to quickly push lanes the enemy has abandoned due to grouping up (this is usually related to point #1, loss of towers/TP options as well)."
TrueDoTA2,39yfwy,Ailodierap,5,Mon Jun 15 21:17:46 2015 UTC,"I would caution though that if the enemy is pushing towers quickly you have to be confident in your team's ability to turtle against a deathball, because a bots first-item PL is not going to rat harder than a group of 5 enemies can push in the early-mid game."

Treads/aquila/diffusal is a better fighting build, but as a farming build Aquila yasha bots is nice. Once the map opens up and t1s are down, bots are almost like a Midas in how they let you farm faster and be more active on the map.  However, whether or not you get away with it is heavily dependent on your team and the enemy. If your team is getting picked apart without you or if you're losing map control such that you're mostly stuck in your base, then bots feel very clumsy.

TrueDoTA2,39yfwy,DownvoteDogUpvoteCat,0,Mon Jun 15 20:46:20 2015 UTC,"If you dont need to fight early and you're not under big pressure in lane, rushing bots instead of Treads -> Diffu is actually very efficient in the long run. Keep in mind that you have to judge based on the opponents picks and playstyle. If you're up against something that can destroy your face with an Orchid (f.e. a QoP/Storm) rushing a Diffu or Manta (to purge/manta the silence off) might be a lot better.   If you have good defensive supports many heroes can get away with building BoT as their first item (I suppose after the likes of Aquila/Wands etc.) in order to speed their farm up."
TrueDoTA2,39x9iu,elgskred,14,Mon Jun 15 15:31:20 2015 UTC,"From my experience the most self-reliance carry in my hero pool is Slark. This hero only needs lv7 to succesfully rotate to jungle and farm with Aquila Dark Pact Tread. Then get a Shadow blade to start hunting their supports or squishy carry or clean up leftover heroes after a fight.  After a successful mid game with Shadow blade, your opponents will have to group up or ward their lanes because they fear you. Now you can farm their jungle (check for ward presence with your ultimate) to free up space for your supports to farm your jungle/lane. But the priority is to get kills on supports to delay their key items (Blink, Mek, etc).  From there the item choice needs to vary a little bit, because it depends whether your team has another strong carry or not (because Slark solo kill potential is good but teamfight potential is average), and see whether their heroes buy item to counter you or not. But generally I tend to build up bulky Slark to prepare for teamfight.  I think generally my way of playing Slark works pretty well unless your team feeds too much before the 10th min mark, or your opponents choose to 4-5 man push your tower (usually Juggernaut, Luna, Tide, Warlock, strong AOE heroes).  Luna and Naga is pretty good as well, Luna with Yasha Morbid can jungle fast, so is Naga Bottle into Radiance. They both have amazing ultimate to counter solo gank.  Naix/Huskar are also good."
TrueDoTA2,39x9iu,unr4v3l,2,Mon Jun 15 16:02:47 2015 UTC,"you really need the radiance to start doing things). Luna isn't much better off, since she dies terribly to many offlaners due to her low health pool, although she can at least jungle a bit.   If I play any of these heroes I would tell my team (or buy it myself) to buy a ward to place in my jungle when their mid hero starts to have kill potential, so if they show up I can back off to t2 tower.   If I'm playing vs serious harassers, I can double pull lane creeps into jungle if my support doesn't know it. Generally in my bracket people rarely buy ward to block my jungle camp, or the offlaners never come to disrupt my double pulls.  If you want to lasthit from afar you can aggro creep to pull them to you. Generally every 2 sec for 1 aggro creep pull is sufficient enough.  Not to mention people who play support at my MMR are pretty average at zoning the opponent's carry out. They should have stood between the opponent's carry and the opponent's creep wave to deny the experience gain & the lasthits."
TrueDoTA2,39x9iu,unr4v3l,1 point,Mon Jun 15 16:23:34 2015 UTC,"I see, agree with your point. I think OP is lucky that he's similar bracket as mine, so my advice should work :D  If I have to lasthit under tower, a Quelling blade is nice too."
TrueDoTA2,39x9iu,unr4v3l,2,Mon Jun 15 16:38:45 2015 UTC,"/u/Sworn is correct. At 5k and above the enemy offlane tends to want to take as many potshots as he can at you, and if your support is incompetant/pressured as well, then Slark has little avenue of being self-reliant, simply because he has no lane control. Against melee heroes with an OOV and essence shift, yes. But against any ranged hero with decent BAT or MS with an escape skill? No. It's even worse if it's a trilane or the pull camp is blocked, because you reach 6 extremely slowly, and I always feel that the regen from 6 is useful, but does not even come close to sustaining heavy harass from say, max Lightning build Leshrac. The regen doesn't even let me clear big camp stacks with dark pact easily unless dark pact  is maxed. So, no, I don't think Slark is self-reliant at all. Good at creating space, drawing attention, yes. Self-reliant, absolutely not."
TrueDoTA2,39x9iu,tinkeringabout,1 point,Mon Jun 15 16:46:22 2015 UTC,"Naga has the same issue (and is even worse, because you really need the radiance to start doing things).   Kind of, except naga is super tanky innately, whereas slark is super squishy and easy to kill until he hits level 6."
TrueDoTA2,39x9iu,pepe_le_shoe,0,Mon Jun 15 16:51:55 2015 UTC,"I try to tell people in going midas first on slark, they tend to give you space to farm.  Course,  this isn't always the case and half the supports in my bracket are auto attacking constantly."
TrueDoTA2,39x9iu,Jackolope,9,Mon Jun 15 17:36:06 2015 UTC,"It used to be Razor, he could dominate any lane 1v1 or at least breakeven. Now Gyro on his own is also okay, safelane Lesh, safelane QOP, basically strong solo laners. The concept of a 'carry' being self-reliant is a bit retarded. Some offlanes just force you to spend on regen like extra tangos or maybe even a Bottle like EE likes to purchase. Just don't be stingy."
TrueDoTA2,39x9iu,tinkeringabout,1 point,Tue Jun 16 10:59:09 2015 UTC,"Definitely agree. In general at 4.5k, I still don't see enough people realising what they need to win a lane (efficiency and regen). EE loves bottle on safe lane carries as a great sustain which allows you to snowball harder or keep up with the offlaners bottle."
TrueDoTA2,39x9iu,ExistentialPandabear,7,Tue Jun 16 20:23:05 2015 UTC,I go PA when I get the feeling I'm going to have a rough lane.
TrueDoTA2,39x9iu,HRP,4,Mon Jun 15 15:38:46 2015 UTC,I second this. Pa is great because if it's a tough lane you can just get a ring of basilius and last hi with your dagger. Then when you hit six you can occasionally throw a dagger out onto your opponent in lane and if your dagger crits it's pretty easy to go in for the kill. I'll even do ps offlane because she can get reasonably good farm while staying a safe distance away.
TrueDoTA2,39x9iu,Abismos,2,Wed Jun 17 09:06:15 2015 UTC,safe distance away.   1200 units to be exact.
TrueDoTA2,39x9iu,subraizada3_,4,Mon Jun 15 16:14:46 2015 UTC,"Either some people are misinterpreting your post or I am, but I think in terms of self reliant heroes, you are looking for someone who can get kills on his own and also has an escape to stop ganks.  Mirana is a pretty good hero for that, as her arrow can get you some kills, even if your support is doing nothing but sitting by the tower playing with himself. Leap is also a great escape.  Same could be said for slark with pounce.  BS is good self sustain in lane even with harrass, as you can use the heal to keep farming. While he lacks good escape, the silence and/or ms boost helps."
TrueDoTA2,39x9iu,YOU_GOT_REKT,1 point,Mon Jun 15 19:41:52 2015 UTC,"More like someone who can jump in, get a kill, and get out in most cases.  That would be Slark, but Mirana is pretty good for that too.  It's not too often you get a team that potatoes during Mirana ult, but it still happen."
TrueDoTA2,39x9iu,FreshExpress,3,Tue Jun 16 01:01:17 2015 UTC,PA can farm with dagger in a tough lane and quickly transition to jungle with lifesteal.  Bloodseeker can move into jungle at level 1 if supports are worthless or someone else wants safe lane.
TrueDoTA2,39x9iu,UNBR34K4BL3,2,Mon Jun 15 16:16:23 2015 UTC,"If your going to have a bad lane you want to pick heros who can do stuff with levels and little to no items. Void fits into that category since he can setup some kills with his ulti. Others I would name are Tiny, Bristleback, Huskar, Ursa, PA, Shadow Fiend, Viper, and Windranger.            Pretty much Boots and a bottle on these guys and u can get kills early."
TrueDoTA2,39x9iu,regulus434,2,Wed Jun 17 01:58:27 2015 UTC,"I too support a lot and I have found Sven to be my go to. If someone else starts snowballing (shadow shaman, lion, lesh) I can take a back seat to their farm, alleviate them of support duties and still have a big impact. Otherwise I can always farm hard and fast and wreck other teams with a bit of teamwork. Centaur does this well also as does silencer."
TrueDoTA2,39x9iu,NSfwPunk,2,Mon Jun 15 17:26:50 2015 UTC,"slark. you farm whatever really fast as soon as you are 6. know where they have wards. can solo pickup when you have sb, etc"

Sven might not be the most self reliant, but he only needs a few items to come online so he can still compete.  Viper just rapes a lane. Razor can harass well. Gyro is hard to fight early. Windranger can scrape by on farm and only needs Aghanim's and a crit to be really strong. Bloodseeker is just annoying. Bristleback can't be harassed out of lane too easily."

TrueDoTA2,39x9iu,Vladdypoo,1 point,Mon Jun 15 17:31:39 2015 UTC,"Any core with a strong disable is pretty self-reliant. Some heroes I like to play when no one else wants to carry are:  Tiny. He can blink and slam most targets.  Legion. She can blink/SB and duel most secluded targets. Unfortunately, she can't snowball if they group up.  Most pubstompers are pubstompers because they are self-reliant. Don't be afraid to be ""that guy"" if picking Bloodseeker is actually the best option."
TrueDoTA2,39x9iu,Chilidawg,-2,Mon Jun 15 20:33:14 2015 UTC,That really isn't how dota works. Maybe try to get the mid role of you want to get a solo.
TrueDoTA2,39x9iu,Lazarous86,3,Tue Jun 16 01:25:22 2015 UTC,I dont think he wants a solo. He wants a hero that can carry without having to rely heavily on supports. Plus many carries would get rocked in mid
TrueDoTA2,39x9iu,YOU_GOT_REKT,3,Thu Jun 18 00:14:28 2015 UTC,"I guess what I am more getting at is you can't say, I want a carry that doesn't need support in a safe lane where your support is going to be. If you have a do nothing support they are still hurting you because they are gimping your XP and not providing any benefit to the lane. We have all been there. There isn't much you can do when your teammate isn't contributing and hurting you in the process. There are legitimate mid roles that can carry a game. I am not saying go mid with Void, rather pick mid heroes that can take over a game.  It guarantees that you are primarily solo and can win the lane based on your own skill. I know what he is asking, but there isn't a good answer when your supports are dead weight to the point you can't even be in the lane anymore. Probably like he did, get enough he can jungle and just grind out the early game, but any carry would need to do that. Go bloodseeker or Phantom Lancer if you want a carry that can't always go jungle to save their early game, but it still doesn't really do much to win that lane, just not lose your role."
TrueDoTA2,39x9iu,Lazarous86,1 point,Mon Jun 15 15:37:09 2015 UTC,"The problem with this concept is that unless you are a better mid than the average mid at your MMR (hint: you probably aren't), you're not going to gain any MMR by changing roles, you'll only gain it by playing the roles you play best better or playing the roles your team actually needs at the end of the pick phase if you're a more flexible player.  Players who intentionally smurf to show that gaining MMR is possible put this idea into everyone's head that mids and carries are the way to win more games and gain MMR (and it is, if you've been intentionally throwing games to drop your MMR 3k below what it should be). Everyone likes to think they're better than their MMR but in reality this isn't the case."
TrueDoTA2,39x9iu,brinebold,1 point,Mon Jun 15 16:18:39 2015 UTC,"By the logic you just portrayed no one would be able to raise their MMR in any role if they are accurately calibrated for their skill to MMR. And while that sounds true, the actual context of the discussion applies. Teamwork or your teams ability is the difference if the first statement is true. If you execute your role perfectly but another player on your team is not calibrated accurately, i would argue that there is potential to overcome that scenario as a mid hero if you outplay your lane, but not as a support. If the mid can snowball early and have a decent team fight in spite of that player, you can be fine. So your role does in fact give you a higher chance to win. you are as good as you play in that role and the rest of youe team exexutes theirs in that specific game and every game is a reset of that. That is why you can get better and raise your MMR. That is why you hear of people just playing support all the time or mids all the time and winning. Because they learn to properly execute their role and their team does theirs as well."
TrueDoTA2,39x9iu,Lazarous86,1 point,Mon Jun 15 16:30:28 2015 UTC,"i would argue that there is potential to overcome that scenario as a mid hero if you outplay your lane, but not as a support   TLDR: Not really. As a mid your baseline to be a net positive effect is significantly higher than the other lanes. You do more but you have to do more just to keep up with the average opposing mid.  Not really. You can't expect to outplay an equally skilled mid unless you outpicked them badly. If you outpicked them badly, you either got lucky by their mid hero not normally being normally a mid player or by stealing the last pick advantage from one of your other teammates (your position probably is the best to get this advantage, but it has nothing to do with your skill and any other player on your team could have done the same).  You can get lucky as a mid and really snowball but unless you're improperly ranked by a pretty large margin you can't do that reliably enough to be statistically significant.  The real difference if you're accurately calibrated is that as a mid, when you do your job particularly well, you feel like you either won the game or you were let down by the less powerful heroes on your team and should have won based on your performance. Even when you do your job poorly, you still feel like you're competitive with everything except the opposing mid until your team really starts getting stomped. However, you were given more resources early by your teammates and are therefore expected to do better than them. If you just keep pace with them for the early to midgame, then that's a huge failure on your part. In reality, you usually screw up as much as your teammates, mid was just handed a gold and XP advantage by taking mid so you get away with things that would kill everyone else on the team.  Try playing games with a support that does nothing but leech XP in lane, never buys wards, doesn't respond to dewards by dewarding themselves, or just plays like they're a tanky initiator instead of a squishy support. No amount of good play by a mid or carry will overcome that unless the opposing team throws on their own. It's a team game, just because you took a position that gets more resources does not mean you will win if you play well, it just sets the bar higher compared to the rest of your team to break even because the other team also had a midlaner."

TrueDoTA2,39xbe0,unr4v3l,13,Mon Jun 15 15:45:33 2015 UTC,"Game State  The state of the game can influence people depending on what type of person they are.  There are a lot of games where you just sort of start off well and then keep taking objectives. It feels very fluid and there is little communication needed. If you can put the game in that sort of spot by rotating and pushing, then teamwork comes very easily. People seem so much more competent when they are winning and in control of the map. The movements become a lot more natural because objectives are much more clear in those games.  On the other side of things, if you're in a game where you're losing hard you can try tapping into being an authoritative figure. When people don't know what to do, they often unite around the one person who seems to have any idea of how to handle the situation. But, it can backfire if you have multiple strong personalities or more than one person trying to take the reigns.  Empathy  Just think about the things you hate to hear in a game and use that to empathize with others. In many cases, your heart is in the right place, but the way you present the information does not work.  Big things to avoid:   Condescention: ""You know you could have just used [ability] ability and lived there, right?""   Good info, but you sound like a dick  Mocking: ""Holy shit, our [hero] doesn't even have [ability] skilled yet""   Again, could be good info, but you sound even more annoying  Opinion: ""I always go [item/build] on [hero]""   Might be good info, might not. How you like to play isn't always how everyone else does.    You kind of get the idea. Just be aware that the way you say something has a big impact because these randoms don't know you and they cannot see (and in some cases hear) you.  Also realize that in a lot of situations people are aware of their mistakes and do not need someone else also telling them they fucked up.  On a basic level, most people want to be understood. On average, if there is something negative that happens it is far better to ask ""oh shit dude, what happened there?"" or something like ""Why [item]?"".  What to Communicate & When  What  Overcommunication is a serious problem. When you have a constant stream of information coming to you, it is distracting. If you have to filter it, then you lose focus on the game and make mistakes.  Try to keep communication simple, concise, and only for big things.  Also, be specific or expect bad results. ""Can someone buy wards?"" is not the same as ""Can you buy wards [hero]?"" Likewise, ""Let's push early"" is not the same as ""Let's push after I get Mek"". People respond better to specifics, and it can also help to remove decision making, otherwise that is another cumbersome decision to make.  Be careful when using some of the built-in communications. Like pinging a spell to let others know it is on cooldown can easily be misread and they think it's up (e.g. their focus is on a potential initiation).  When  Do as much communication up front as possible. Figure out who is getting Mek while picking.  Rapport  Remember that going in, you have no real weight in these other players' minds.  Try to establish a good relationship early by being charismatic. You don't have to be funny or anything. As long as you acknowledge others and appear interested in them, it will give them a favorable view of you. If you can build any sort of connection with the others on your team, they are much more likely to listen.  Morale  Keeping your teammates happy tends to help them play better and be more receptive to communication. Use empathy here to keep morale up:   Try to understand what happened and sympathize with people when mistakes are made Acknowledge when people do something awesome   e.g. nice split push! e.g. fuck dude, that's a fast midas  Defend your teammates when someone flames them   Cut Your Losses  Some people are lost causes and you have to accept that.  If your carry doesn't play up enough for you to actually go for kills in lane and they don't respond to communication, then focus on another lane and another person that will communicate.  If someone is flaming a lot and is always deconstructive, then just mute them.  And just remember, some games are going to be losses pretty much whatever you do. Just focus on the process of getting better instead of the results."

TrueDoTA2,39xbe0,pucklermuskau,5,Mon Jun 15 17:51:18 2015 UTC,"I think there are two easier solutions. Find the people who are cooperative in game. Being good helps, but find someone who has yet to flame you. Most people I have added to my friends list I forget who they are and never play with them. But when I do feeling like rounding off my 4 stack I have yet to have a player who has flamed me or tilted.   The other thing is to kind of give up on strategizing your team to the point you imagine. Only point out things that make the game unwinnable: no mkbs, no bkbs, or things like detection.   Don't say things like ""try not to get caught out"" or some other variation of feed. With friends, I usually say, ""we need to cover dark seer, he's getting focused a lot.""   If you get unlucky with players who don't speak your language or have sound, you can't change that. so recognize it and move on. It will be something you can't change and a realistic reason why that player is losing his games while another reason is why he contributes to a win and why his MMR is where it's at."

Only point out things that make the game unwinnable: no mkbs, no bkbs, or things like detection.   Yeah I have to agree particularly on this. People I play with usually don't know which item should be prioritized first, and they also don't know when you should let support farm or let carry farm. I had a game where I was the support player that begs to buy gem to counter techies because he's the main reason we can't push, but I'm money short and people took all incoming creep waves (we lost all t1 & t2 towers). Same deal with letting carry farm to have money on buyback, but supports take their farm :(  I think correct item choices win game a lot, like recently I played PL against their dual threat PA + Leshrac ( + Clink with Oblivion staff into Orchid soon), but seeing that PA not making Battlefury, and Leshrac is the main problem in mid game, I choose to buy Drum => DIffusal => Skadi => Heart, instead of Skadi => MKB. My team that game plays amazingly as well, but I feel like if I had no Heart I would have straight up conceeded to Leshrac. Saved gold for buyback instead of spending on items after Heart. The 2 times buyback won us the game."

Like Crimson guard on timber versus PL or diffusal blade on phantom assassin versus a lot of heroes, even ones that aren't wraith King, like slark and Qop.   They will say "" that's stupid"" and proceed to watch heroes eat them alive. Same with friends even honestly. They sometimes ask me what to buy because, guess what...I play and theory craft a lot. And usually whatever item I recommend makes the game easier. But sometimes people don't like using medallion or diffusal blade, which makes it harder. Or don't buy diffusal blade first and decide ""I'll do it after battle fury.""

TrueDoTA2,39xbe0,loveisdead,4,Mon Jun 15 16:26:27 2015 UTC,"either they don't understand english   I run into this frequently on Scrubmatches. I was in a match the other day with a PA who kept saying ""compra war!"". I have a conversational spanish background (I can communicate VERY basically), but I didn't know what ""war"" meant. It wasn't until over 30 mins in that he finally clarified (after me asking him at least a dozen times ""que es 'war'"") he finally said ""ojo"" [eye] and then it clicked. I wasn't playing support but I went ahead and bought several wards (obs/sent) and warded the chokepoints.   The entire time, he kept calling us ""hijos de puta"" [sons of bitch] which I do understand. While I agree that a carry shouldn't be forced to buy wards, he could drop 75g, buy 1, and say ""War -->"" and ping the map. I eventually told him ""I am muting you"" and then 20s later he DCd. We lost, unsurprisingly.   In a different game, a much nicer player (though also playing PA) wouldn't respond to our requests to stop dual-laning Mid. He said a couple short phrases but none of us could figure out what language it was. Eventually he typed something after he died, and I looked it up on google translate and GT said it was Javanese. So I translated ""please go top, do not fight mid now"" and typed that -- and then he went top.   The moral of the story here:  If there is a language barrier, communicate with pings and alt-clicks and chat wheel. If they do not appear to understand english, do not continue to type english words to them (and if you are a non-english speaker, don't continue to flame your team in your native langauge if they do not understand you).   Also: PLS VOLVO -- it would be SUPER HELPFUL if there was an option to set ""preferred language"" so that a language name appears next to the username if their preferred language is different than yours. This solves two problems:   Pre-emptively tells me that the player can see what I'm writing / hear me, but may not understand Tells me what language to type in if I need to communicate.

Not always positively but I try my best and I have more commendations (without ever asking) than average for the amount of games I've played (60/2/12/25 or so split in around 800 matches iirc). I almost always play solo. The number one faux pas I see with people who have game knowledge and a microphone is that they will usually talk AFTER a fight or death and then criticize what happened. Leadership is about communicating plans effectively. When your microphone is too often used after the fact and in a negative way then you will lose the team's ear. Anyone with eyes and a brain can see that they made a mistake and likely don't need you to point it out unless they ask a question about what happened. If you are never putting forth a plan for others to join in on, but then chirp in that Axe messed up his call or whatever, you are worse than a silent player at that point. Don't waste time with things like telling someone they've warded the wrong spot, etc. If you aren't buying the wards, then ask the person who bought it to place it somewhere with a ping before they place themselves. Everyone on the team is notified when wards are bought.  Use your microphone to give short and medium term goals that are easily understood and then be quiet. When I hard 5, I will often say something like ""I plan on warding both jungle entrances soon so that our carries have some safety to farm"" if we are losing fights and will need to play defensively for a bit. If your teammates are just milling around doing nothing, this is an easy way to let them know where you will be moving so they can protect you and will likely result in them taking some camps instead of staring across the river. Usually as a support you can use wards and a simple statement like that (""I've placed vision behind the tower, so we should be able to push it"") to help nudge your team in the right direction. If you aren't a support and aren't warding, then something like ""I'm having a smoke brought to me/please smoke here and we can try and gank their jungler soon"" really helps to make things happen. Alt click your initiation skill/item and then the target, so that your teammates know what you plan to use to start the fight and who you are going on. When something goes well, a simple ""Nice kill"", etc. is really enough for someone to know their play is being valued. Makes for a much more pleasant match.  I find that a lot of timing mistakes happen because people just assume their short term plan is known by everyone on the team, even when they haven't communicated it at all. If you've ever been busy with CS on a creep wave and weren't checking your teammates skill cooldowns, inventories and movements, then you would really appreciate it if someone gave a quick heads up that something will happen so that you can get into position. If informing your teammates about anything, don't do it in a passive-aggressive or sarcastic manner. Whether you are right or not, nobody will listen to someone who is unlikable.  Final note - I cannot stress enough how awesome CTRL is with the minimap. A quick line from your minimap icon/the enemy icon will tell your team so much about what you plan to do or what the enemy is doing. Alt-clicking Pudge only tells me he is missing. Did he go top? Pass through a rune? A line from the rune down to the safe lane tier 1 with a missing call is way more likely to save your carry. Someone running from a gank and you are headed to support? Draw a mark showing how you plan to get to them so that they don't make a wrong turn and die. Works for every situation imaginable and across all language barriers."
TrueDoTA2,39xbe0,greenhatman99,2,Mon Jun 15 18:34:11 2015 UTC,"The easiest way to lead pubs is to be frank and admit up to your mistakes while focusing on what is to come rather than what happened. You don't want to look like an asshole, just a guy/girl playing Dota who wants to win. And if there is one thing that Dota players all unanimously enjoy, it's sweet victory at the very end. Acting polite is going to help your cause so much if all you want to do is lead."
TrueDoTA2,39xbe0,brinebold,2,Mon Jun 15 22:28:50 2015 UTC,"If you want to avoid telling people what to do (which I think is a good idea), you can also try asking your team what you should do. That way you can still coordinate a strategy with your team without seeming like you're trying to force your plan on others.  Find the player you think is making the best decisions and then find out what they think you should be doing. Having two people discuss and agree on a strategy will make it more credible with the rest of the team, and you neither of you look like you're trying to take control and tell everyone else how to play.  Remember, the goal isn't to get everyone else to do what you want, the goal is to get everyone working together!"

Always be friendly/positive. Everything else will result in discord Don't speak as you don't want to be spoken to.  Be very clear and use simple English and multiple comm types at the same time. ""Top tower is low, X and Y lets go take it,"" Ping the tower,  Push! on Chat Wheel. People will listen if you play well. Focus on your own game first and communication second (I play mostly the 5 or 4 role and planning/co-ordination is necessary or me to win games) I have scaled back on this and focus on my own game first, make good plays, act like a pro. And they listen after that. If you are a carry with space to farm get all your last hits and be 60+CS at 10min and be a beast when you leave lane and they will listen. Identify a ""comm buddy"" sometimes people will form a communication alliance with you. Embrace them and make a suggestion hoping he backs you up. I use chat wheel and ping for early laning. And only communicate if I can see there will be problems (My carry farming under the enemy Tier 1 while I am trying to Pull the lane back for example) Never tell people NOT to do things only make useful suggestions. ""Gyro just bought a butterfly, do we need to farm up a MKB before the next team fight?"" - I'll ward up the jungle.. PEOPLE ARE IDIOTS - Myself included. They will do what they want, they will not listen, they will infuriate you. When this happens focus on your own game, your hero mechanics, playing the team fights as perfectly as possible etc. Just have faith in them no throwing and hope for the best. Any attempt to make them do what you want/need will have the opposite effect."

TrueDoTA2,39w9ih,armahillo,1 point,Mon Jun 15 13:55:23 2015 UTC,"No, it's fine. Most console commands are unintuitive unless you look for it anyway.   Basically like the other comment said, dota_camera_setpos x y where x is a coordinate and y is a coordinate. This command centers your camera immediately on a certain location based on the coordinates input, e.g. 0 0 which is the center of the map near Dire mid lane hill. The most common and practical use as of yet for this command is instantly centering your camera on the runes. As most wards only catch the edge of the rune, such as Radiant mid hill and Radiant bottom lane beside Medium camp, the snap-camera is useful in catching a glimpse of what rune it is, or at least allowing you to box-select the hero so that you can see what rune the enemy QOP bottled, for example."
TrueDoTA2,39w9ih,Avvulous,1 point,Mon Jun 15 14:29:20 2015 UTC,Is there an especially helpful doc source you recommend so I can RTFM?
TrueDoTA2,39vtxi,CommandX3,9,Mon Jun 15 05:25:23 2015 UTC,"No. LC is not, and never has been, an initiator ffor teamfights. She can initiate for a skirmish or prime/set-up another hero's initiation for a teamfight.  The problem with LC aghs is that she is heavily reliant on short-duration buffs/debuffs to fight. Most notable are Press the Attack and BKB, but Silver Edge debuff, Blademail, Satanic, and other items come into play too. Give the Aghs a secondary effect that pauses the buff timers during Duel and its a good item."
TrueDoTA2,39vtxi,Carnot_AoR,3,Mon Jun 15 06:05:17 2015 UTC,"That seems a bit too strong, and also not in keeping with the theme of the ability. Despite how it may be used, I don't think duel is primarily intended to be a disable. It's really more of a steroid that can also be a disable. Turning it into a mini overgrowth changes it too much from the base skill, in my opinion. I think any added effects should be on the dueled hero - keeping LC safe during the duel has always depended on positioning and teamwork, and I think that's really core to the ability. So I think any additions should either be buffs to LC during duel or debuffs to the dueled enemy. For example, you could apply a disarm, or reduce armor, or something like that."
TrueDoTA2,39vtxi,fearsomeduckins,2,Mon Jun 15 10:06:00 2015 UTC,"I've explained it a few times in short, guess it's time for a longer version.  Aghanim's upgrades have various uses. Some, like Ogre Magi's or Witch Doctors, can be considered core items that pretty much every player will try to get as the first or second big item. Others are situational, Faceless Void and Huskar are good examples for that.  Legion Commander already has important core items (Dagger or another way to ease duel initiation, something defensive) and has a nice variety of items to profit from depending on the situation (Blademail against squishy high-damage enemies, BKB against big nukers, Mael/Mjoll against teams with summons for example). Do you really want an Aghanim's so good that it can be considered a core item? It would hurt her flexibility on the long run, since any balancing will be done based around everyone going Aghs.  Personally, I am absolutely fine with the current Aghs. Sure, it's not too impressive and I would not object to a small buff, but conceptually it fits really well by giving LC a tool to disable the really beefy guys, like Pudge and Alchemist, without caring too much about about the duel running out too soon. It's also good for lower position LCs to take out an enemy on the sidelines of a clash.  That's why I think this sort of situational upgrade is exactly what Duel should get."
TrueDoTA2,39vtxi,Infrisios,1 point,Tue Jun 16 06:25:27 2015 UTC,"Anything is better than infinite duel. If you can't win the duel in 5s, or right after it ends, then there's little point dueling.Then there's the issue of PTA and other debuffs running out. What do you do when you have a 5s BKB and an infinite duel? You lose the duel when the enemy team realises your bkb is down and rips you a new arsehole thanks to the glowing sign ""kill me for free damage"". If you were capable of winning in the 5s duel + bkb lasts, you'd be better off spending the 4200 on some more dps/armor/hp/defense/anything than the aghanim scepter, which just about rules out getting it entirely.  4200 on stats and forever-duel is so bad, I doubt it actually gets bought except for last minute pick-ups in already won games."
TrueDoTA2,39vtxi,VindicoAtrum,1 point,Mon Jun 15 12:03:57 2015 UTC,"I think it should give LC infinite, uniterrupted duel OR refresh cooldown on ult after a successful duel, kind of like axe CRUNCH."

TrueDoTA2,39uuj4,Ishmael_KingOfTheSea,21,Sun Jun 14 23:54:59 2015 UTC,"a small attack damage buff would help.  his fade bolt nerf really knocked him down also.  it seems like icefrog doesn't want rubick to be a mid, so i wouldn't hold my breath for a buff to his core potential."
TrueDoTA2,39uuj4,docmartens,7,Mon Jun 15 00:09:59 2015 UTC,"A big difficulty with making Rubick mid viable is that most buffs to him as a mid are even better buffs to him as a support. If you buff his attack damage, he COULD mid, or he could completely harass the enemy offlaner out of lane while someone else mids.  Another problem is that Rubick doesn't directly benefit from outleveling other heroes.  Rubick wants to steal level 4 Fissure from Earth Shaker, not a level 2 one. Having fast levels on him is good, but his ult is limited by the spells that your opponent has.  To be a viable mid, Rubick has to offer something that no other mid offers better. You can only give mid's levels and farm to one hero, why should it be Rubick?  Something like a move speed increase might make him a decent ganker, or perhaps a scaling range increase on Fade Bolt.  Alternatively, something more drastic like his aura giving magic damage amplification could improve his teamfight presence in a way that makes him worth investing XP into (although that's probably too powerful of a buff).  I don't think IceFrog opposes Rubick being played as a mid. I just think Rubick is hard to balance as a mid hero without overbuffing his strength in the support role."
TrueDoTA2,39uuj4,dorox1,3,Mon Jun 15 13:40:15 2015 UTC,"I think next TI6 we need a rubick mid, a Faceless Void support and why not throw in a tanky sniper off lane."

TrueDoTA2,39uuj4,genetalgiant,9,Mon Jun 15 18:22:29 2015 UTC,"Honestly I think letting him get his ult at 4 would make a huge difference. They updated meepo's and invoker can get his immediately. plus you know buff fade bolt. Oh and maybe a bit more health or armor, rubick is pretty squishy."

TrueDoTA2,39uuj4,BADMON99,6,Mon Jun 15 00:52:40 2015 UTC,You're not wrong.
TrueDoTA2,39uuj4,jumbohiggins,2,Mon Jun 15 00:54:03 2015 UTC,"Attack damage, Fade Bolt buff, more Str/gain, more Armor, more Int/gain. Depending on the magnitude of the buff, any one of those might be enough, or if they're small buffs he'll need more than 1. But it seems like Icefrog really wants him to be a support."
TrueDoTA2,39uuj4,DangerAwar,2,Mon Jun 15 00:53:01 2015 UTC,"Either   Revert the fade bolt cooldown, mana cost, bounce range and damage nerfs, returning the skill to its 6.72b incarnation;    Fade Bolt Bounce Radius increased from 440 to 600 Fade Bolt Damage increased from 70/140/210/280 to 75/150/225/300 Fade Bolt Mana Cost reduced from 150 to 90/95/100/105 Fade Bolt Cooldown reduced from 16/14/12/10 to 10   or    Revert the cliffing changes so that it's impossible to contest runes against Rubick again. Give him a base damage buff so that he can contest for CS better.   Particularly reverting the Fade Bolt nerfs should be enough for him to do well in mid, but it would also more than likely make support Rubick absurd again. The role generally played by mid lane players has changed away from Rubick (and other former mids like Lion and Rhasta), and only huge buffs would really get any of those heroes back there in an era where mid is more farming focused than it once was."
TrueDoTA2,39uuj4,Narcowski,1 point,Mon Jun 15 06:02:19 2015 UTC,"I honestly think it would return some spice to the game, I actually miss those innovative Lion/Rubick/SS mids where a support pick could've been masked as a mid pick and vice versa.   I mean if anyone thinks those changes would make Rubick OP or too strong, just look at Lina.. She is able to seamlessly transition into a core position and rekt face at that with pure damage and almost little counterplay. A Rubick mid would require similar snowballing but also be situational depending on the enemy lineup; magical in some and just meh in others."

TrueDoTA2,39uuj4,TacoPower,2,Mon Jun 15 07:11:52 2015 UTC,"It's not original hero design as CM has it with her arcane aura and I'm pretty sure it's been mentioned before, but maybe if rubick had double his null field magic resistance for himself he could become viper levels of tan lines.   He could become a greaves carrier more easily or just be more threatening with a fast Atod/Aghs.  I'm also curious to people that played rubick mid like 3 years ago what laning phase changes they could want. I know fade bolt mana cost being reverted probably isn't ice frog's usually plan to undo nerfs. But maybe if the lift did damage to the targets that aren't being lifted when it lands, like a very small AOE and regular nuke damage. It'd make him honestly pretty strong and lift is a pretty long CD anyways.   I just thought of something else stupid... What if you get a bottle on rubick with a rune, and using a bounty rune gave you the last spell someone uses randomly from the enemy team. Also....what if you could get spells using this method before level 6.   It doesn't make a lot of sense, honestly, but maybe if it was more specific like invis runes steal any invisibility spells or haste rune stole slows/speed boosts. But that even seems hard to code.   Or maybe if you cast spell steal on someone while you have a bottle it will refill your bottle with the last rune they used (only if they haven't died, like spell steal)."

(dd + haste + invis) stealing illusions multiple times results in hundreds of rubicks?  also 4.2k gold isn't worth it unless these powerful ass things are allowed, in which case op as hell. I like rubicks current aghs a lot, situational both with good aghs upgrades and vs combo heroes like invoker."
TrueDoTA2,39uuj4,Avvulous,1 point,Mon Jun 15 19:55:04 2015 UTC,"Haha it honestly sounded good when I wrote it down.   It doesn't make sense as without aghs it's a free bounty rune every 12 seconds or so. I'm curious how much farm that could possibly be. But with aghs, just spell steal someone every two seconds for like 25 gold at least per second extra. Translate to 400 extra GPM. Which is crazy.   Maybe if you could only steal to refill your rune once per enemy use. Like you only get one extra refill if your enemy used a rune. You can't steal the same haste rune from your enemy twice. They'd have to use two haste runes.   The thing is that runes aren't explicitly spells and doesn't make sense. Maybe if I read the lore more.   For multiple runes, it wouldn't become an ability, it just acts like Rubick picked up another rune. So activate your bottled rune if you want the rune that your enemy last used, don't activate it and you just used spell steal on the enemy to get 50 gold."

I've used it to great success in my lower MMR bracket as it has the benefit of either forcing them to avoid you (due to BladeMail) so you can do massive right click or have them take Radiance burn or try to kill you fast while taking massive return damage from BladeMail while still having stuns and a second life to get off decent burn damage. Plus it allows WK to farm really fast mid to late game, getting really expensive end-game items really fast. Here is a fan-made imitation of his build http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=240791186  I've watched him play a few games when I was learning DotA2  last year and he only shows up to fights when they are close to a tower he can TP to and can get a couple of kills. Otherwise, he just pushes lanes and goes into nearby jungle camps until the lanes push back to him. Doing this made me really pay attention to getting every last hit in a creepwave (ignoring denying) when left alone and looking at the minimap to see if there were fights I could come to, if not, just doing my own thing.  With the added Radiance miss-chance, the few times I've done this build this patch, it's been amazing because nobody can really stand toe-to-toe with you mid-game because they either miss or burn down while getting beaten on. After 2-3 won teamfights, people just scatter when they see you, leave you alone when they see you in a lane farming, or try to gank you with disproportionate numbers of heroes, allowing your team to get other objectives."
TrueDoTA2,39t64r,SamosaSultan,8,Sun Jun 14 18:49:01 2015 UTC,"I think it's harder to farm than ever but it's unclear to me whether the 17% miss chance makes up for that at all. I try building it on weird heroes against bots from time to time and rarely have I felt like the miss chance turned any fights. For example I ran a core undying with Radiance and Aghs a couple times, convinced that Undying could stay alive from the radiance burn killing creeps in teamfights, but it's just not strong enough. If I can't beat bots with it I really doubt it has any serious potential. Centaur is a hero no one else has mentioned that used to go Radiance back when he was absurdly tanky from his passive ult. I think, as with Bristleback, there are just too many other good items on the hero. If Radiance wasn't so hard to farm it would be different, but that's Radiance's niche."
TrueDoTA2,39t64r,freelance_fox,2,Sun Jun 14 16:07:08 2015 UTC,"If your goal was, ""Undying radiance kills creeps gives me heals"" that's not so very effective. It's more effective when the enemy doesn't realize that that hit may not hit, that you have more EHP against auto attacks, and of course, that the entire enemy team is being whittled down over the course of the teamfight. That said, I don't feel like Undying is a hero that wants to be in the /middle/ of fights, but rather off to the side smashing clumped up enemies and stuff..."

Note I was top GPM for our team. Had the enemy not had Alchemist, we probably could have won. But the crazy attack speed killed Supernova at a rate where the miss chance wasn't enough to swing fights in our favor.  And here is my other Radiance game from 6.84 which we won. Here I ended up as a position 2. I definitely remember Huskar missing several times when attacking the Supernova. It was also helpful for disabling blink daggers when there's no other natural Radiance carrier."
TrueDoTA2,39t64r,White_Lotus,1 point,Sun Jun 14 18:54:46 2015 UTC,"tali of evasion and halberd actually also give you the evasion chance during ult, and for a fraction of the price. (They are also more effective)"
TrueDoTA2,39t64r,solartech0,2,Mon Jun 15 13:46:56 2015 UTC,The problem I have with Radiance is that you want it on heros who jump into the middle of the fight and for what it costs there are more economical options most of the time.              Radiance cost: 5225 * 65 Damage * 17% miss chance        Any hero can get the Solar Crest.        Solar Crest cost: 3000 (2225 less) * 0 Damage * 30% evasion            If your a strength hero you can get a Halberd.        Heaven's Halberd cost: 3850 (1375 less) * 45 Damage * 25% evasion                    If your an agility hero you can get Butterfly.         Butterfly cost: 5875 (650 more) * 60 Damage * 35% Evasion         As you can see with the above examples there are more cost effective options for survivability but even if you add in damage the Halberd/Butterfly are better.               Besides the core heros you mentioned I could see Radiance being a good option for heros with the Octarine core since it works with the lifesteal but who and when?             The first hero that comes to mind when speaking of Octarine core for me is Leshrac. He needs his Boots/Bloodstone/BKB before even thinking of the Octarine so you'd be looking at 4th or 5th item. In this case you have ask yourself if Radiance would be better than say a Shivas/Skadi for survivability or a Daedulus/MKB for damage.               You asked about Bristleback and you could make it work I think if you go Octarine instead of Heart. Would be something like Boots/Halberd/BKB/Octarine/Radiance.
TrueDoTA2,39t64r,regulus434,2,Sun Jun 14 20:30:20 2015 UTC,"Daedulus/MKB for damage.   Well Lesh isn't known for right click damage, and is strong by aoe spell damage around him. It sounds like radiance would be the go-to damage item over right click boosting damage items like daedulus/mkb. Although the thing to decide is if you want to boost Lesh's damage or survivability.   Am I wrong in thinking radiance > crit/mkb on an AoE hero like lesh?"
TrueDoTA2,39t64r,Thungon217,1 point,Sun Jun 14 21:46:54 2015 UTC,"No you are completely correct, I was just being through in my comparisons. I would never buy right click items on Lesh. I would go for the survivability.                     Edit: Thinking a bit more it could be good on QOP or DP after Octarine also."

TrueDoTA2,39t64r,pepe_le_shoe,1 point,Mon Jun 15 10:57:50 2015 UTC,A late Orchid is typically bad cause they would have or be close to their BKBs but if they aren't building BKBs you could force them to. So I'd say thats a situational pick for 3rd.

TrueDoTA2,39t64r,TinCou,1 point,Mon Jun 15 00:19:10 2015 UTC,"I think it's still too high risk for the vast majority of heroes in the vast majority of cases. It suffers from some extreme schizophrenia as an item. It works best on tanky heroes who can be in the middle of a teamfight but also requires carry-level farm to get and absolutely requires you to teamfight cautiously if at all until you finish it. It is an extremely expensive item but it becomes a lot less useful in the lategame as health pools grow and is a lot more useful early to accelerate your farm.  It's like sange and yasha. In theory it's a really good item but it takes a very unusual situation for a randomly selected hero to really use it  Now that it gives a miss chance, what if you built it with a talisman of evasion (1800), demon edge (2400), and a 1200 recipie but it gave slightly less damage? Let's say 60 or 55 instead of 65 to account for the easier but still not particularly easy for a first item buildup?  All the items except recipe still come from the secret shop so you can't really expect to buy them pre-death but you can spend unreliable gold in a planned manner and not be quite as useless as someone who doesn't have a sacred relic yet in any fights that happen."

I doubt he's good in a competitive environment simply due to the sheer amount of kiting he'll receive, plus he'll probably have a hard time if the enemies choose to offensive trilane vs him."
TrueDoTA2,39t64r,JaCKaSS_69,1 point,Mon Jun 15 15:58:23 2015 UTC,Radiance with octarine core is really strong (probably the strongest item combo on him for lategame teamfights) on Bristleback but you need some armour first.

TrueDoTA2,39t64r,Renge13,1 point,Tue Jun 16 08:58:38 2015 UTC,Yes. About as much as a tranquils boot per enemy hero with no magic immunity within the radius (basically it heals you the same as radiance burns an enemy if 5 are caught in it with no magic immunity). If you already have a good amount of armour and HP it can add up to a lot of regen in a fight.

TrueDoTA2,39u81z,eskaolin,4,Sun Jun 14 20:37:42 2015 UTC,My idea was make duel last 10 seconds and give magic inmunity to LC for the dueling time. BAM. You dont need to rush the bkb now.
TrueDoTA2,39u81z,SavageRS,4,Mon Jun 15 03:17:16 2015 UTC,"I think the first one is great. I feel the damage from overpower would have to be significant to really cause people to look at it. Maybe change it to a pure damage nuke upon receiving the aghs? I'm not sure but I think it's magical currently, and I'm pretty sure as a 5th or 6th item the damage from overwhelming odds wouldnt make this a players final pick up. Nice starting concept though.  The second one I think would be a little overpowered. If legion gets ahead at all, its like Axe ult except the enemy team cant run away at all, and she can easily kill heroes at full health (assuming she is ahead). The duel is a huge lockdown, so if you were to pick off a core early in the fight, LC would just blink/shadowblade and pick off all the supports and gain 10-50 bonus damage way too early on. Maybe instead of instant CD on ult, her other skills come off CD instantly? Overwhelming odds off CD after a duel would make the skill more significant for chasing after winning a duel, and Press the Attack would regen her up from the duel. Just an idea.  The third one I'm not sure would be any more useful than the current. Assuming she has a decent amount of bonus damage, giving it away would really gimp her. Maybe if she is playing as some sort of support, or a lone druid is pushing with bear and you give the attack damage to bear. Either way I feel it would be just as  situational as the current aghs.  Just my lowly two cents though. :)"
TrueDoTA2,39u81z,Slothtimistic,2,Sun Jun 14 21:17:26 2015 UTC,"The first one is a good concept, but a bit OP in the current form. 1000 AoE OO? Safe to say, it will catch all 4 enemies in it, and possibly some creeps, meaning it's an about 500 magic nuke to everyone, plus Tresdin gets a ridiculous amount of mobility.  Your second suggestion I think is the best one. Instantly refreshing all her cooldowns, save for ult, would make her much more impactful in a fight than her standard ""lock one guy down, hopefully kill him, save a teammate, chase enemies"" plan. I like it a lot actually."

TrueDoTA2,39u81z,Stiverton,1 point,Mon Jun 15 03:46:18 2015 UTC,"Okay, so my idea that I just randomly came up with is adding an aoe root to Duel. So essentially outside enemies cannot move or attack during the Ult, but they can cast skills.   I feel like thus would make her a good initiation hero, and would complement her ability set well since it would limit interference from enemies but not completely make it impossible, meaning she would need a BKB before interference would be impossible.   I'd love to hear what you guys think, what the aoe of the root could be, etc."

The big problems with the upgrade are that its not worth the 4200 gold price tag and that LC is heavily reliant on short-duration buffs to fight, most notably Press the Attack and BKB. My suggestion is that for the duration of Aghs Duel, buff timers on LC do not tick down. Alternatively, just PtA won't expire during Duel but Moment of Courage gets another level (ie. an additional 10% Lifesteal and 0.6 less CD, or 95% and 0.3s at rank 4) either during Duel or permanently. Or...when Moment of Courage procs a reduced duration but stacking PtA is applied to LC."

TrueDoTA2,39u81z,Slothtimistic,2,Sun Jun 14 21:23:40 2015 UTC,The damage was between the original target and LC. The idea was that it was a persistent AOE around the duel that forced other enemies to join in.

TrueDoTA2,39tc42,sylvain_soliman,3,Sun Jun 14 17:55:37 2015 UTC,"So regarding the thread:  -Text guides are the best in my opinion because you can talk concrete things or go in-depth without changing the subject of the guide, you can just organize things in such a way so everything fits and the reader gets everything in one go. Also, written guides make way easier categorizing sections, so if you write a guide on Treant Protector for instance and the reader only came in to see what you had to say about the use of Eyes in the forest, he can jump straight to that when in video form it is much more inconvenient. The main downside to text guides is that it can be hard to keep everything interesting and dynamic, avoid unnecessary walls of texts and such, this is why I use my diagrams and if I didn't need a diagram in a section I might just add some funny picture or something. This way it becomes more of a proper guide and less of an information dump into the reader.  Videos on the other hand are great for examples of play and matches, replay analysis and such are almost impossible to pull off in written form; but I think hero guides in video form are far from ideal for various reasons, but mainly because of the linear nature of the video is hard to come back to something and explain it more in depth. However, this doesnt apply for very basic guides aimed at beginners that still havent got completely into written guides, like those that were up on Dotacinema's channel.  Slahser's way videos aren't really hero guides, he just goes into his personal playstyle and explains it in general lines. You will notice he will keep everything in that linear form I mentioned.   My style   Look at this video for example: Here. This video guide could have been in written form and would have been much more organized. You'll notice how he has to add those text annotations to get his point across, considering he might forget to say things in the video.   My thoughts o/"

TrueDoTA2,39so8e,tkalamov,6,Sun Jun 14 11:19:20 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure you should always focus on getting a bloodstone before doing much else, regardless of the lane. Unless you can get kills 100% easily."
TrueDoTA2,39so8e,larharth,-1,Sun Jun 14 12:15:29 2015 UTC,"First: I only play pubs.  Now:  I like to buy an early orb of venom. It make harassing even more effective with 4*3=12 poison damage dmg. You can keep the enemy heroes under poison effect constantly. Low hp heroes like Antimage will hate you. Axe too, since you are effectively canceling is OP hp regen. The weak slow (4%) also helps you chain you harassing hits and to lend split earth. If you are going phase, the +dmg will really be put to use. (its not rare to get 2 or 3 hits from a melee hero trying to last hit). So that +9 dmg from the blades of attack will really add up. It is situational, like being against a strong melee lane, it's useless most other times. But the positives points also apply to your laning partner, so the benefits can be exponential. For the price, I believe Orb of Venom on Lesh in safe lane is to be considered.  I also like to go double sage masks into Euls/SoulRing. Playing as Lesh, I like to spend some money on clarities early game, as the kills they provide make the investment profitable. Going double masks in that situation assure that your mana pool will always be at least half. You'll be able to roam the map and quickly make those masks in Euls/SR. Euls is mostly CORE to Lesh in my humble opinion, rarely should you NOT buy it. Apart from the cyclone into split earth combo, Euls is vital on frail casters to evad nukes, etc.  With Lesh insane initial move speed, Euls MS bonus makes him a hard to it target.  You can get OoV and double Sage Masks pretty early. Which make you great a great ganker. I also like BoH  I like to play Lesh as a support ganker.  I max lightning storm and split earth first. (Maybe a point in diabolic edict to help take a tower.)  That makes Lesh a very dangerous disabler. To maximize that, I don't get in the heat of team fights until I have either bloodstone or octarine core. Bloodstone make death berable, and octarine core in the right situations, make Lesh unkillable. I sometimes get people telling to put skills point in pulse nova early.  No. I don't. Lesh is frail and to use pulse nova in early to mid game, you have to put yourself in unacceptable situations. Using pulse nova the defend yourself will only quickly empty your mana pool. Just cast cyclone, run away, slow them with LS or stun with ES. Way more effective."
TrueDoTA2,39so8e,i20d,1 point,Sun Jun 14 15:44:51 2015 UTC,"Agree that Euls is nearly core on Leshrac. As I commented below, the item gives him way too much for how good its buildup and and price are for him. Arc/Euls --> Bloodstone is the build for pubs IMO.   I see many competitive Leshrac's going bloodstone first, which isn't bad by any means, but I think they're warranted to do that through being on a team with reliable supports and other cores."
TrueDoTA2,39so8e,WcP,1 point,Mon Jun 15 13:55:22 2015 UTC,"I've played six or seven matches as Lesh this patch and he's far more malleable, lane-wise, than I expected. Mid is obvious and he's more or less able to at least draw if not completely dominate the lane. My stack and I have also had success running him in sidelines in dual vs. dual or tri vs. tri matchups. Lightning damage and three heroes slowed for relatively low mana is brutal in big early lane fights. Things like Lesh/Kotl/Visage have been pretty disgusting. The Lesh starting RoP, regen and branches and getting a quick basi and arc boots.   However, the lane we've had hilarious success with is dual offlane Lesh/Undying. Holy crap this lane is brutal. The carry can't farm, Lesh gets near free farm and if they go on you they will die. The slows from lightning and tomb are plenty for a few split earths, which is essentially a guaranteed kill in that lane.   I like getting arcanes and going to euls on Lesh. It helps with the brawling nature of this meta and gives him strong solo kill potential and makes him much more difficult to pick off. It delays bloodstone by a couple minutes, yes, but in my experience the delay is in favor of putting much more pressure on the other team to not be caught out of position.   Anyways, fun hero this patch. Cheers."

She hits for a pretty solid amount, and if your opponents leave their tower alone, she can just push right through. Her mana shield lets her be resilient to ganks, and the snake can let you counter-gank if you choose to skill it. If you pick up a maelstrom she can take early fights, although it isn't the best later."

Regardless, with all of the team fight shit going on and fighting as 5 at 15 mins, yes, that makes it death ball.  Dusa. You can at least get treads and cheap stats to help out in team fights.

What we have now is a gank/team fight meta   This is not even meta, it's just 2 things that actually don't do much in this patch if you can not secure map control advantage.

My memory of the death ball meta was pick 5 strong heroes with high pushing potential so that the opposing team could not turtle   Hey, i can specially for you dig up you a random deathball line-up straight from TI4:  Luna Rhasta Chen TA Puck. (Newbee vs VG g1 winner bracket, the game that was decided at pre-rune spawn).  Or another one:  Brew Lone Druid Earthshaker Clockwork Rhasta (Newbee vs VG g1 grand finals, the only game VG won).

TrueDoTA2,39sn8n,ProfessorMonocle,1 point,Mon Jun 15 22:19:48 2015 UTC,"Working from the last bit of your post to the front.  Right, but the idea was to get the minimum core items needed to ""deathball"". These heroes were strong at securing farm in lane and then push like crazy as 5. Hence deathball.   We don't really see that too much now, do we? Yes, some teams might still draft that way, but the overall execution has changed. With the introduction to the comeback mechanic, however nerfed it was, is still present.   In my opinion, the lineups you listed only solidify my point more. As far as SF, QoP, and Lesh are concerned; 2 of those 3 heroes have extremely good gank potential as well as being generally all around heroes. Qop can gank and team fight. She can't really push like DP can. Lesh players max Lightning first now, so tower pushing is delayed, for however long that may be.   As far as early game farm goes. I don't really see how that is different from any other patch. Its always important early on."

These heroes were strong at securing farm in lane and then push like crazy as 5   As are QoP/SF/Leshrac/Pugna right now. Hell, even counter did not change: snowball like crazy from laning stage.   2 of those 3 heroes have extremely good gank potential   And other 2 of those 3 heroes are extremely vulnerable to ganks themselves, so running them without 5 man often is an easy to way to waste it.   QoP can gank and team fight.   I mean, QoP serves role of Brew: something that dominates laning and earlier to later teamfights.   Lesh players max Lightning first now   Yet you can be certain Lesh players will have at least 2 points in edict by 11. Once again, my point remains: deathball is here, it just moved up a little."

Issue is you need 4 other people on your team not dying and holding towers, which can be hard when the game is pretty much 4v5 for the first 20 minutes. If your team does play safe and makes enough space for you then its great, but that isn't every game."
TrueDoTA2,39sn8n,accol33t,0,Sun Jun 14 12:19:57 2015 UTC,"Yes, she is . Although ""deathball"" is more popular than ever in this meta, she has the tolls to counter push and stall enemy's snowball, in both Mystic Snake and Stone Gaze early and with Split shot and Mana Shield later .   The trick here is to build cheap items that allows her to enter into the game early . My favorites ones are arcane boots, MoM and Aquila or Drums . From there, I get the ""late game"" items that she loves so much .   By the way, never ever gets Manta style on Medusa . It is such a weak and underwhelming item on her ."
TrueDoTA2,39sn8n,VindicoAtrum,-1,Sun Jun 14 18:35:06 2015 UTC,"I disagree with what /u/larharth said entirely.  Medusa is vulnerable in lane. Mana shield is small protection in lane, and when the gank comes you're stuck with firing a mystic snake and walking away. The ultimate is costly, slow and can be avoided. It's not even impossible to wait it out and still catch and kill the Medusa.  She doesn't need 4 allies committed to not dying and holding towers. She needs 4 allies committed to keeping her alive and pushing the game out as long as possible.   She's devastating lategame. Everyone knows that. She's up there with spectre for game-ending carry status, but spectre is a whole lot more useful midgame, with any of her popular builds.  As to your question - this isn't a deathball style at all. Farming is down, ganking is up. Pushing is a natural consequence of successful kill attempts. Medusa can't farm as well as she used to thanks to reduced bounties, and she can't take part in the early/mid kill > push plays. She's not in a great place atm. In fact, I expect she's up for some changes soon enough, because she's not popular either, not only in this patch but previous patches too. Her pick rate is a dazzling 6.75% and seemingly going nowhere any time soon."

I like the early 2nd point into stun for that little extra radius on stun and 50% extra dmg compared to the previous level and then level E ofc cuz OpieOP  Most offlaners won't be able to stay in lane that long and with a decent support I like this build as it lets you put up a good amount of pressure and extra gold from Towers.

You don't need any of the stats it gives either, movespeed is nice but Lesh is a pretty quick hero anyways and the range on lightning is insane. Mana regen is covered by bloodstone and bottle. I wouldn't grab BoT's that early either as you really need either octarine core or bkb to snowball effectively and take control of the game.  Make octarine core or bkb your third item and then pick up the other after that. After that it opens up depending on the game and the heroes your against. Aghs, Shivas, Scythe all good choices."

TrueDoTA2,39sb1r,pepe_le_shoe,-2,Mon Jun 15 11:03:11 2015 UTC,I have seen both skill builds. You go 4 0 4 0 or 3 0 4 1. It really just depends on what you like.  I like the 4 0 4 0 myself because it lets you farm more efficiently. I also like to pair that build with euls phase boots asap. You just euls your target and set up your Q stun. Good for when you want to roam gank. But that is a bit of the older lesh build and you pretty much described the new way perfectly.
TrueDoTA2,39sb1r,Lazarous86,4,Sun Jun 14 10:57:53 2015 UTC,lvl 1 pulse nova is such an insane value point though.

TrueDoTA2,39sb1r,pepe_le_shoe,1 point,Mon Jun 15 11:04:38 2015 UTC,If you would take the time to do the math you would know it is more efficient mana wise and faster burst for camps. You are not going to throw a game by level 8. You probably also go tell that to the pro teams they are doing it wrong that level their core leshs that way too.
TrueDoTA2,39sb1r,Lazarous86,2,Mon Jun 15 11:24:19 2015 UTC,"efficient mana wise and faster burst for camps.   If you have bottles, this is not an issue, also, farming 3 camps with lightning only works on radiant, not dire, you need to use split earth too if you aren't using your ult in most cases.  Mana efficiency is not really an issue when you're a core lesh with bottle + bloodstone.  I routinely clear out the 3 east camps in radiant jungle then regen/bottle back to full mana without going back to fountain.   You probably also go tell that to the pro teams they are doing it wrong that level their core leshs that way too.   Arteezy builds it my way. Sumail does too. Nova at 8/9 is fine on support lesh.  I don't like how navi build it, but I get why they do - it used to be the standard built, and if you don't have euls, the maxed split earth is handy, I guess it depends how fast you want to close out the game. I don't play lesh in pubs with a view to ending early, because ayy lmao at ending a game early in pubs. What is a tower? Why would I attack a tower?  Honestly though, late nova is the support build. I think people who delay it on core lesh are just stuck in their old build, and they make it work because they are pros and it doesn't matter too much."
TrueDoTA2,39rssj,Nephophobic,8,Sun Jun 14 03:16:58 2015 UTC,Watch Broxy. He is number 9 Techies. He tends to go triple null -> Soul Ring -> Treads/Arcanes/Tranquils depending on how good a game he is having -> Force -> Euls -> Ags -> Octarine/Necro.  He generally spends his lane just right clicking the enemy and there was a point where he got Arteezy to tilt because of how dominant Techies is against melee carries.  He also answers questions from chat and he is streaming right now.

TrueDoTA2,39rssj,JoEyyB,4,Mon Jun 15 06:15:58 2015 UTC,"Hey man, I think your problem is that you spend too much time placing mines and not enough time getting xp. With the new change to Land Mines, ganking is easier because you can just place a mine on a stunned hero for example. SSA is also good.   For Zeus demining, place mines on  cliffs so he will die walking up them. If the game isn't going your teams way, start mining your base.   Against Beastmaster and NP, there isn't much you can do. They will probably build necrobooks to counter you. I don't really play against them because I don't pick techies when they are in the game.   Thinking ahead is definitely part of the hero but so is mindgames. You want to implant seeds of doubt into the enemy team, sort of like pudge. Place your sign in the middle of nowhere, go to places where the won't expect you and get out so they think you mined there and if they chase you, bait to some weird place so they think it's a trap.   There are guides of where to place mines on the dota subreddit, but my favourite place is in the lane, below the sideshop. Enemies tend to run in circles after denying, last hitting or zoning so that's a great place. Sometimes you may get a double kill."
TrueDoTA2,39rssj,dootdootskeleton,4,Sun Jun 14 03:41:13 2015 UTC,I'm sometimes level 2-3 at 13 minutes   This is one of the biggest mistakes Techies players make.  Don't AFK mine in the beginning.  You need levels.  You need to get your damage up before the other team has levels or items that help them deal with mines and you get left in the dust.  I think you'll notice a big jump in your efficacy once you have a decent xpm.
TrueDoTA2,39rssj,Simco_,3,Sun Jun 14 04:15:14 2015 UTC,"These are my tips as techies in the order you will probably have to implement them chronologically on a match:  -Buy a clarity and a tango as fast as you can and go to your lane ASAP right as you spawn.  -You can spend the rest of the gold on whatever your team needs. If I dont have another non-core hero on my team then i usually buy a courier and a ward, but if there's a hard supp then I buy any component to soulring / tranqs  -When you are in your lane, place 2 or 3 mines if you can, stay out of tower sight and if you want to know the current position of the enemy creepwave just look at your other lane, its mirrored, if the enemy isnt checking the rune then its probable that they are blocking the creepwave (wich is a benefit for you)  -Try to push with your mines once you have placed a bunch of them in a spot near the creeps.  -Push with your mines but be wary of your mana, if you run out of mana your enemy will punish you by trying to kill you because you cant suicide.  -Use your suicide as a way to not give gold to the enemy as you are about to die, if not, its only worth it to use it if you are sure you can kill more than 1 person.  -Max your mines and use them to push the tower, place them between the enemy creepwave and the tower, that way you will deal full damage to both. A techies mine does significant damage to a tower, you can very easily last hit the tower with it.  -Stay in lane and push it constantly, specially if you are on the offlane, the enemy safelane tower is a very useful tool for the enemy cores, since it allows them to farm their jungle under no risk.  -Once you are level 6, place many remote bombs near your offlane or your mid lane, whatever is closer to you, this is very important since it doesnt allow your enemy to push.  -Consider placing 6 or 7 mines at rosh at around 10-15 minutes if they have a roshy lineup like aoe heals, lifesteal or a roshan guy like ursa, troll, huskar, you get the idea.  -Place the mines at rosh at the very end of the pit, that way they have no way of seeing them if they are stupid and placed a sentry right on the entrance of the pit. This way, they also cantdestroy them without suffering damage (unless they have a way of getting flying vision, sniper, TA, storm, NP, troll, clock, etc)  -Place stasis traps in the middle of teamfights, they are an aoe 4 second stun.  -Try to get a fast aghs by pushing lanes with your mines, be wary, always carry a TP, always, you are very slow even with tranquils, once you get it, until the minute 50 or so (or unless they have mega creeps), you can kill an entire creepwave with just one remote mine!  -Most of the time, placing your ult outside of lanes is pointless (unless roshan of course), if you wanna play mindgames with the enemy, just place you normal mines, they last forever and cost less mana, which you cant afford to waste. *Talking of mana, I usually get tranquils because it gives me the ability to be more impactful in lanes early on, allowing me to move faster between lanes and spam soul ring, because of the HP regen.  -You get countered by guys who can tank your mines, not by vision. This is the reason why troll is kinda a counter to you, HE CAN SURVIVE THREE MINES AT LEVEL 1, THREE GODDAMN MINES.  -If you think you are gonna have a bad time because of pushers, place multiple remote mines troughout the lanes and kill the summons when they pass nearby exploding only one mine out of the stack, also place them in great quantities at your T3s to make life hell for the enemy.  -Its very situational and will most probably work only once on the entire game if your enemy is not retarded but... Remote mines dont block the jungle ;)  My last and most important advice: Dont play the same tricks multiple times in the game, your enemies WILL adapt to you. Once you made them paranoid of going inside their own jungle, stop placing mines in their jungle. Happy mining and remember to have all the fun that neither the enemy or your allies can get!"
TrueDoTA2,39rssj,MarvelousComment,2,Sun Jun 14 04:53:32 2015 UTC,I would just lane instead of mining in the fog for 20 minutes.  Mine after you get your core stuff

TrueDoTA2,39rssj,jjohn268,2,Sun Jun 14 11:10:55 2015 UTC,"I've seen solo offlane, but you really need to know how to place mines to do that. Just go offlane with someone else and harass the opponents with your crazy range.   As techies, you also need to be buying wards and sentries. If you start planting in an area that is warded, you are just wasting time. Smoke (plus a tp to get out without being seen) is also a great option if you decide to go mine the rosh pit or opponent secret shop.  Once you get remote mines, don't for get that they give you pretty good vision. It almost acts like Treants ward aghs spell.   You're biggest problem, as mentioned already, is you aren't getting exp. Stay in lane and harass. Also, don't be afraid to use suicide if you can get a kill while in lane, especially if it is an opposing carry that you will kill."
TrueDoTA2,39rssj,subraizada3_,4,Sun Jun 14 17:21:44 2015 UTC,"Not on a computer right now so sorry about any typos.  Based on what you said theres a solid chance youre playing 1k mmr techies: tp to offlane, make 1st blood stack, roam and put mines.  Your enemies arent stupid and they dont feed you. You are level 4 at 35 minutes.  Watch siractionslacks's asshole's guide to techies. 100% worth the time. Tldr is get xp in offlane, push with mines, and fight with your team. Play like brood where you take over the offlane. Its your territory and anyone who goes there dies. Take their safelane towers. Use your aoe laguna blades and stasis traps to fight with your team. Basic itemization is sr+arcanes into euls and aghs, force staff and oc after that. Bloodstone is bad because suicide.  Broxy and broskisupp are good techies streamers, watch at least one of their good techies games. Completely changes your playstyle, like sas's guide its 100% worth the time.  Rune mines are worth it because they win mid lane. You dont even have to put a mine. Buy a ward, tp mid, put ward on their rune spot, when you see them approach pop one of your clarities and put a mine down 15 seconds later. If they dont check your mana you either denied them a rune or wasted 100 of their gold for a ward. Do similar mindgames with your sign and by intentionally  being in their vision ranges.  Furion is countered by remote mines, zeus has to waste all his mana or risk dying until he gets bloodstone. Gem bm is tough to deal with, dont pick techies into it. Its fine if they have furion or chen, zeus is bad but not as much as bm. As sas says, your success isnt how many kills you got with mines,  its your tower damage and your effect on the enemy. If  you make zeus waste all his mana and keep their mid from getting runes and make their zupports have brown boots at 40 minutes because of sentries and have thir carry die when he wants to farm jungle, youre doing your job well. Techies plays a different game than the other heroes, you keep their team scared and keep their supports poor and win mid for your midder and instakill creep waves and keep the enemy from ever walking outside of creep paths and use remotes to kill them when they do walk on creep paths."
TrueDoTA2,39rssj,ph1l0math,2,Sun Jun 14 04:12:39 2015 UTC,Totally agree re Siractionslacks. Serious guide with a sense of humour.   One trick is to shift-queue a mine every time you TP to abuse the fountain regen which persists for a few seconds after you TP. Very handy for laying traps which will help to prevent pushes. (I think I saw this in a video guide analysing Broxy's plays)
TrueDoTA2,39rssj,CommandX3,1 point,Thu Jun 25 06:58:34 2015 UTC,"I'll just go through your questions one at a time.   Are there guides out there? Most definitely YES! You can check out dotafire, they have some good ones.   How do I deal with Zeus? Try to lay your mines uphill, and in odd places where he won't expect them. I would try to pick techies later so that the enemy doesn't get to counter pick him as easily.   How do I deal with BM/NP. Congratulations! You just became a jungler. Set up mines with the intention of killing the minions, they'll gradually feed you gold and you won't be too far behind. You can also try to catch out other players when they don't have someone to scout for them in the area.  Where to put mines at the beginning? Rune mines may seem obvious, because they are. But they also allow your team to have greater rune control, so even though the enemy team will kno they are there, the mines will still deny them acres to the runes, which can really set up your mid-laner for success.   Mining the edge of the forest is good, and make sure the enemy doesn't see you in the area or else they will be more cautious.   If your team is on the defensive, consider buying Maelstroms instead of Aghs so you can defend highground more easily. This seems weird but is actually legitimate due to your high range.   Make sure you stack camps and then use you mines to get multiple last hits. The more stacks you get the more efficient this is, and you may find that it amps up your item timings by quite a bit. You can also kill ancients with your mines since they deal physical damage, and those will really help you catch up in farm.  Hope this helped."

TrueDoTA2,39rssj,mindsc2,1 point,Sun Jun 14 04:03:42 2015 UTC,"The fact of the matter is that techies is pretty easy to counter. If you give the other team the opportunity to counter him, they will do so. Enigma, BM, NP, zeus, etc. I like to pick techies 4th or 5th and usually in response to a mostly melee team. If I see a melee carry, melee mid and/or melee supports, it's a great time to pick techies.  I'll try to avoid talking about specific mine locations because there are plenty of guides and techies games you can watch, and it's hard to describe mine spots without having a visual. However this is probably the best FB spot, although it is becoming a bit predictable: http://i.imgur.com/upCfd5g.jpg.  There are different ways to go about the game. Regardless of your position, you're going to want soul ring asap. I prefer tranquil boots after that. If there's already an offlaner, I like to delay getting xp and set up 2/3 solid mine spots for a FB. Then go lane with the offlaner. If you're solo offlane, just plant mines in spots that the supports will use you harass. Mine the rune spawn, or paths to it, so you can reliably get it versus the mid/supports. Spam land mines on the creep waves. Do this and soak xp until level 6. At this point you can start stacking remotes. If there's 1/2 ranged supports with true sight it becomes very difficult. Either try rotating to another lane, or just focus on using your mana to farm. Alternatively you can plant them in unconventional spots that might not be warded. Also keep in mind that supports can't afford to sentry everywhere early/mid game.  In the mid-game just focus on mining paths in/out of the jungle and around the paths to the rune spots. If your team is being defensive, plant them around the entrances to your jungle. If you're being aggressive, plant them around their jungle. Smoke can be really helpful. Keep rotating if they're busting out the sentries.  Mid/late game you really want to focus on having remotes on high ground. Hopefully by now you have or are close to scepter. The new sign thing is really strong late game. Some alternative spots to stacking remotes at your t3 is putting them at the top of the ramp on dire side going up to the secret shop from the base...and also the bot lane ramp going up and away from the t3 towards the jungle. Gem obviously shuts a lot of this down so farming scepter asap can be pretty important.  That's all I can say for now, I could go on and on. Ask me if you have specific questions."
TrueDoTA2,39rssj,FabulousMrFox,1 point,Sun Jun 14 04:31:56 2015 UTC,"Hello. You seem to rely on land mines too much. If you are very cunning and more experienced than your opponents you can snowball with them, but the more serious and reliable way to play techies is to get exp and some farm from solo/double offlane and then start mining crucial spots like t1 towers and areas where fights are happening with remote mines. You don't even have to farm if you don't want. I usually play a mix of roaming techies and sensible techies - I tp to the offlane and mine there, then maybe place another stack of sneaky mines. Then if I get kills and soul ring I keep mining. If not, go to the offlane and leech exp until I catch up a bit. This is a useful tip for all roamers, if you don't get kills/assists you need to spend some time in the lane until you catch up.  Techies is also very useful in solo/duo offlanes because if you place the mines slightly off the creepwave path you can't be ganked, they can't dive or harass you aggressively. With 6.84 change in mine detonation delay you can also throw the mines in the enemy's face if their carry is melee and you have s lot of kill potential combined with any disables."
TrueDoTA2,39rssj,h0ist,1 point,Sun Jun 14 12:19:11 2015 UTC,"Mindgames! Make sure they see you at their safelane sideshop. The enemy safelane now has to use the courier to get all their items delivered. Even if rune mines are obvious it will deny them to the enemy unless they spend money on sentry wards. If they have a jungler, make the junglers life shit by blocking the spawns with mines . Make sure the common gank paths from mid to the side lanes are mined. Now the mid will spend extra time to get into position, which means less gold and xp gained in lane. It will help your mid as he will be harder to gank by roaming heroes. There are some good heroes that counter him but make sure you last pick if possible which means less coutnerpicking. The list goes on forever."

TrueDoTA2,39npmi,CommandX3,13,Sat Jun 13 01:39:38 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure everyone here checks out /r/Dota2 and knows about it. Nonetheless I wonder how the 'PLAYSTYLE GRAPH' will turn out. Will it be accurate? Whats the algorithm behind it?
TrueDoTA2,39npmi,AndersonIV,7,Sat Jun 13 04:00:12 2015 UTC,"I'm glad that someone else found this to be interesting - of all the new features, this one piqued my interest the most.    Similarly, I'm more interested in a playstyle graph for each of my heroes.  How one plays for Sand King should be very different from how one plays QoP, for example.  This would also be nice for an objective comparison to everyone else - I should be able to compare my Naga Siren playstyle to RTZ's and make adjustments accordingly.  How the scaling works will be interesting as well.  Is the graph based on a finite number of integers (say 10  ""levels"" per statistic) or is it continuous?  Is a certain ranking for a statistic an absolute value or normalized by your MMR (or hero MMR, or some other statistic for that matter)?  Is the area under the plot normalized in any way?  These are all questions that I'll be looking at once we get our hands on it in a week or so.    With regards to the algorithm, I'm interested in that as well, but in reality it is probably best to keep it secret.  Similar to the MMR calibration algorithm, if it is made public, I'd be afraid of people gaming it to get the highest ranking.  If I can get philosophical for a moment, would it be so bad if people tried to game a system which ranks their performance on a given hero?  Would this not just lead to people getting better at DotA (assuming that the metrics used are the proper ones), which is what we all ultimately want?"
TrueDoTA2,39npmi,GTAero,3,Sat Jun 13 05:02:44 2015 UTC,"I have a hard time believing numbers and graphs can accurately measure Dota skill. Numbers don't reflect the complex decision making involved in non-core play. For example, a Sand King with very high GPM may have farmed very efficiently, but is this really a good thing? There is no counter-number to measure impact on the map.  I think winrate is really the only stat that can indicate how effective a player is on a particular hero. I will be interested to see how Valve handles these problems."
TrueDoTA2,39npmi,Bentomat,3,Sat Jun 13 16:59:23 2015 UTC,"While winrate is the ultimate stat to measure success, these other stats will allow players analyze why they win more effectively."
TrueDoTA2,39npmi,GTAero,1 point,Sat Jun 13 17:48:45 2015 UTC,"I agree that they can't measure skill or tell the whole story of a player's strategy, but I do think that they can characterize one's play style.  Using your example of Sand King, I could compare my statistics against a very high level player and see that I am spending too much effort farming (higher farming score than him) and not enough effort roaming for kills (lower ganking score).  By the simple reasoning of him being better than me, then I can assist my play style accordingly.  Of course, DotA is very complex, so some human reasoning is needed to parse the data correctly - an offlane Sand King is going to play differently than a jungler or a level 1 roaming support - but it can be a very useful tool.   Plus, if you're suggesting one doesn't need a crazy gpm on Sand King, you probably haven't tried Octraine Core on him. It's probably beyond suboptimal, but spamming burrow strike in a team fight for multiple several hero suns is really fun."
TrueDoTA2,39npmi,loveisdead,1 point,Sat Jun 13 19:27:51 2015 UTC,"If used properly numbers and graphs can provide all the data you need to solve problems. The difficulty is figuring out what the numbers represent in actuality and what you  need to do to improve. You can easily see if your gpm is too low, but figuring out how to increase it can involve fixing hundreds of different problems with your play. Last hits before ten minutes doesn't only involve your ability to last hit but your ability in how to play a certain matchup and harass without getting killed."

TrueDoTA2,39mfiy,Sublixt,6,Fri Jun 12 20:57:01 2015 UTC,Also her aghs is completely obscene
TrueDoTA2,39mfiy,docmartens,7,Fri Jun 12 21:30:25 2015 UTC,Agh's is core on Luna now. People saying she's weak probably haven't adjusted their item builds yet

TrueDoTA2,39mfiy,Drop_,8,Fri Jun 12 22:53:39 2015 UTC,"It's because BKB rush sucks on any hero that isn't basically a ""spell carry"" (Lesh, Lina, maybe a hero like BB, etc.)  You want BKB when you have plenty of damage to leverage that magic immunity with.  If you go aquila->hotd->bkb as Luna, people are just going to laugh at you, because you have no damage to scare them with.  It's the same thing as a PA that goes aquila->hotd->bkb because even with lvl 2 ulti she still doesn't hit very hard like that, so you can kind of just pat her on the head and pinch her cheek and go back to murdering her team while you wait for her wasted 10 sec BKB to fall off before murdering her.  But you had to rush BKB as Luna, because Luna's entire teamfight contribution for the first, like... 30 minutes of the game consists of ""press BKB, run into fight, press R, ???""  You basically wasted your best BKB charges just so you wouldn't immediately die upon running into the middle of the fight to use Eclipse.  With Agh's, that's no longer an issue - you can cast it on the ground, you can tape it to Tidehunter's slimy butt before he blinks into the middle of the enemy team, you can stick it on a Sand King while he's headbanging if you really want to make people feel unwelcome, etc.  Plus Agh's gives you a decent spread of stats in a single slot, something Luna desperately needs.  You can always sell it ultra late game, but I think it'd be just about the last item you'd sell, simply because it makes her ult so much more versatile.  I'd sell it at like 80 mins when Eclipse is doing very little damage compared to my right-clicks, but probably not before then.  I'd consider it core in the same way BKB would normally be considered core on her."
TrueDoTA2,39mfiy,Thalnagath,5,Sat Jun 13 04:04:10 2015 UTC,At what point do you want to pick it up? Is it going to be your first big item or do you want some smaller items like HotD first?
TrueDoTA2,39mfiy,DonReavis,0,Sat Jun 13 05:17:33 2015 UTC,"Probably a standard Luna build, so like treads+aquila+hotd into agh's.  Basically instead of spending 4k on BKB, you spend 4200 on Agh's.  Then you can get BKB afterwards, but honestly I'd still get some right-click damage and/or tank first, because BKB isn't that great if you don't have damage to back it up, and Agh's means you don't need to put yourself at risk to use your ult.  The thing is, with agh's, she doesn't even need BKB to siege high ground... she can either tape Eclipse to her team's initiator, or just cast it on the high ground in general and make that area an instant loss for the enemy team if they try to fight there.  Aside from her agh's going from gimmicky crap to absolute core, Luna hasn't changed much in terms of item builds."

Tape Eclipse to Sandy as he's headbanging, have someone tag the enemy team with veil, and just watch how fucking insane the damage becomes.  Even Pipe won't save you from that."
TrueDoTA2,39mfiy,Thalnagath,2,Sat Jun 13 22:26:14 2015 UTC,Pretty good argument for it being core.
TrueDoTA2,39mfiy,Drop_,2,Sat Jun 13 10:07:11 2015 UTC,Why is it so good. It just doesn't seem so impressive.
TrueDoTA2,39mfiy,nizox,7,Sat Jun 13 01:50:24 2015 UTC,"The range is massive and gives it huge utility.   You know how people joke about Windranger's power shot being global?  Luna Agh's essentially makes Eclipse the same range.   Luna was a hero that typically had to rush BKB because having an effective ult means being in the middle of a fight, but even with a bkb many enemy heroes can still burst her down pretty easily.  Heroes like Ursa or Clinkz or Jugg, or even heroes like Lina with agh's can burst her through her bkb.    The fact that it increases the number of beams and beams per unit is mostly gravy.    Effectively it lets you take part in a teamfight without compromising your position.  It also lets you combo it with aoe disables in a way that isn't really possible without it.  Blink initiations like tide ravage -> Eclipse from range is much more devestating than either being bait and having tide counterinitiate or running in after the ravage and casting eclipse.  After it starts going off, then you can run in with your absurd move speed and clean up while your ult is already cutting enemies down, or after it's done its work."
TrueDoTA2,39mfiy,Drop_,1 point,Sat Jun 13 01:58:23 2015 UTC,Wow thanks. Yup that makes a lot of sense.
TrueDoTA2,39mfiy,nizox,1 point,Sat Jun 13 02:08:17 2015 UTC,"Considering its a pretty long cooldown and as all spells of this kind it is better off not basing your whole playstyle around them since wasting/misplacing it can mean a lost teamfight, potentially a lost advantage. Conceptually the upgrade is nice to have, but luna seems better off built around her glaives while having her ult as an emergency ""kill supports"" or after bkb button. It makes her not only more flexible but also speeds her farm up considerably.  I suppose it can work in situations where you have a pickoff hero (e.g. Storm/Beast/anything that can initiate and disable a target for a long while) since with the massive castrange you can deal an immense amount of spell damage on the target without being near. That's way too much of a niche imo and not worth a #1 position farming role. Not even a #2."
TrueDoTA2,39mfiy,JaCKaSS_69,5,Sat Jun 13 14:06:43 2015 UTC,"Nah, the main part behind luna pick is exactly her eclipse presence. Also her greatest downfall.

TrueDoTA2,39mfiy,lolfail9001,0,Sat Jun 13 15:59:09 2015 UTC,"You've got it wrong, Luna's main strength is the advantage she gives for harass in lane and the free Demon Edge for her team to push in the midgame. She's also a really fast farmer once you get your items up. Sure the longrange nuke+interrupt as well as the ohshit early game button that Eclipse is help as well, but I'm pretty sure those aren't the main selling points of the hero. Also being innately mobile she can chase/position more easily in the lane and later on in fights."

He can't punish a solo lane against him because he can't dive and kill.  He can't abandon a lost offlane to jungle because he can't clear the camps anymore.  I get it since he's been such a competitive mainstay, but still sad to see.    Terrorblade doesn't do anything well anymore.  Can't split push, can't fight, can't farm fast enough.

There is pretty much always a better option; no reason to pick the hero.  Why pick him instead of Sven (who isn't even that strong himself)?"
TrueDoTA2,39mfiy,dxroland,3,Fri Jun 12 19:55:25 2015 UTC,"Alchemist is still good. Bat will always be good in comp. Agree with TB, hero is nerfed too hard"
TrueDoTA2,39mfiy,Thalnagath,6,Fri Jun 12 22:30:07 2015 UTC,"I think it's hard to argue Alch is ""still"" good when the hero has been terrible for 3 patches (comp and pub).  People did the novelty farm Aghs for your friends when it first came out, but that lasted about a week.  Bat may have a slightly better time in comp vs pubs, but he's still fallen way off in both.  He's sporting a 40ish percent pub winrate, which is awful for a hero that isn't hard to play and used to be super versatile."
TrueDoTA2,39mfiy,dxroland,2,Fri Jun 12 22:38:50 2015 UTC,"Just because people don't know how to play ""new"" Alch (read: Alch ever since they got off their asses and removed the retard-proofing on his stun) doesn't mean he's a bad hero.  There was a thread that was discussing him like last week that I commented on.  The cliff's notes goes something like this:   Alch is a shitty right-click hard carry, don't pick him like that.  Pick him as an early roamer that will transition into a utility-core position, mostly by farming jungle and/or ancients (leaves lanes free for your right-click heroes etc to farm.) Pick at least two heroes that will benefit from having a free Agh's.  My personal favorite is Tinker because of how absolutely OP his Agh's is.  These heroes should generally not want to rush out an Agh's (so don't pick Tiny and expect Alch to buy him his Agh's), but would want one by the middle game.  You should typically not pick more than three such heroes, because it's unlikely Alch will ever be able to afford more than two Agh's in any kind of realistic game. You should get that Agh's relatively quickly, but only after you farm a couple of simple core items for yourself.  This is part one of why Alch is a terrible carry - carry Alch basically needs to be 6 slotted before he can afford to spend money on Agh's.  Utility Alch can afford to do it after only a couple of basic items. Good choices for these items include cheatstick (charge stun, walk into vision, cyclone, gz on free unavoidable max duration stun), Solar Crest (disgusting synergy with Acid Spray and his stun), Mekansm (though casual Meka is pretty terrible after the ridiculous nerfs it's taken, you're practically forced to go for greaves now), Vlad's, Armlet, Lothar's (for eventual Silver Edge), Halberd, etc.  Pick the items according to your team's needs.  Solar Crest should probably be seen as core - it just provides way too much synergy with your skills, and you can disassemble it and make Halberd with it once you're no longer hitting supports for 80% of their health with your stun (instead you only hit them for 60%.)  Without worrying about specific drafts, and assuming you're following the meta and being aggressive, I'd probably go for Solar Crest and Vlad's (Medallion->Vlad's->Solar Crest.)  Lots of armor, extreme damage potential, plenty of mana regen, all items are easy build-up and low cost. Use your early items and roaming to take towers and early fights.  Are they defending their towers really hard?  Go farm a few camps with acid spray, then push some more.  Repeat.  Most of the time you'll want a value point in Greevil's Greed to abuse bounty runes with (particularly the first one, do everything you can to ensure Alchemist gets one if you pick him.)  12 gp/creep is not an insignificant increase in total farm, especially if you get a camp with lots of weak creeps (golems, small satyrs, fucking kobolds, etc.) Repeat this process to get an Agh's online relatively early... say by the 25 minute mark or so.  Imagine dealing with a teamfighting Tinker that has blinker, boots of travel (lvl 1), and one other item of his choice (probably either cheatstick or dagon)... and a free Agh's.  4x rockets on demand with insane range that hit for 350 dmg apiece, a bouncing laser that 100% blinds for 3 sec and does 320 pure dmg per bounce and has no bounce limit.  And effectively no cooldown due to Rearm.  It's incredibly difficult to fight against that so early.  You can setup similar things - a Centy with a fast Agh's makes his team virtually impossible to kill, Visage can skip the Agh's and go straight into damage or utility, Meepo can go straight to sheeper, etc (Meepo and Alch may not be a good idea, sounds ultra greedy.) Alch works best with at least one other hero that likes reducing armor.  Slardar is probably overkill, but Dazzle works just stupidly well.  If you can tag some enemy heroes with Weave, Acid Spray goes from a somewhat irritating area denial spell to a somewhat devastating area killing spell and his stun will literally do upwards of 600 damage if you can charge it.  Dazzle also likes a friendly Solar Crest and Acid Spray, since all of his damage output is physical (Shadow Wave gets really scary when you're sitting at -12 armor.) Alch doesn't do so well against overwhelming burst, which unfortunately is pretty popular right now (any kind of Lina, any kind of Lion, QoP, etc.)  AA also tends to serve as a potent counter to him since Ice Blast makes his ult basically useless.   Alch is definitely not top tier material, but he's hardly weak.  Just because people are bad at playing him doesn't make him a bad hero.  I do think the night vision nerf was a little too much and should be reduced or even outright reverted, though."

TrueDoTA2,39mfiy,LiquidShad0w,2,Sat Jun 13 03:30:41 2015 UTC,Why do people think Doomy is bad? Extremely versatile hero with probably the best disable in the game
TrueDoTA2,39mfiy,Thalnagath,5,Fri Jun 12 19:58:54 2015 UTC,It's because he's crap in lane. Completely fucking garbage. What does he offer? He can devour creeps for gold. He can give himself regeneration and move speed. Lvldeath is a really bad nuke. Okay so run him as a jungler then? Well no because he can't gang for shit till he gets his ulti and even then it's not a good skill to gank with. Can't run him as a 1 because he gets rekt by 90% of all carries. Can't choose him for offlane over the other viable ones cuz he gets fuck all done except feeds. So you're basically sacrificing any chance of winning your lanes for what exactly? The potential of farming 12k of items so you can blink in and maybe take 2 people out of the fight. Wow. That's even if you can get off that ridiculous cast time before one of the many many instant or quicker disables fucks you over. Long story short he's shit   Oh yeah and lotus orb can be hilariously bad for a 30k networth hero who dooms himself LOL
TrueDoTA2,39mfiy,MisterJhones,3,Fri Jun 12 22:37:28 2015 UTC,"Long story short he's shit   People said that about WR, too, yet while she's been buffed literally every patch for years, none of those buffs affected her laning abilities or really did much besides make her Agh's OP as shit.  Doomy ain't shit.  He's still very strong."
TrueDoTA2,39mfiy,Thalnagath,2,Sat Jun 13 12:09:21 2015 UTC,"What an awful comparison. Wr has always been a strong laner as she has an incredible animation, decent dmg, long range high dmg nuke, a stun and a 100% evasion spell that gives speed. Why are you comparing them? If you want evidence that doom is a shit hero then see his pick and ban rate in competitive. Or just consider his none existent laning options and his retarded cast animations"
TrueDoTA2,39mfiy,MisterJhones,1 point,Sat Jun 13 12:37:35 2015 UTC,"Wr has always been a strong laner   WR has always been a very weak laner, at least as far as offlane is concerned.  Why do you think she went unused for so long?  She isn't especially tanky, has rather average range, and her entire defensive mechanism is based around the evasion - a single stun or even just a potent slow can keep her in range long enough for the evasion to run out, at which point she's defenseless and is an easy kill.  Add to that, she has to balance getting CS with Powershot with retaining mana for Windrun and/or Shackleshot, which also makes WR very vulnerable to mana drain/mana burn.  I wonder if the fucking insane increase to Powershot range was an attempt to improve her laning.  2600 means she can CS practically halfway across the map at the cost of not getting XP.  I'll agree that WR is a very competent and strong laner in a 1v1 scenario and would be a great choice if they were doing a solo safelane play (though some solo safelanes would still poop on her), but as a typical solo offlane vs a defensive tri?  She's terrible.   then see his pick and ban rate in competitive   P/B, even in comp, is utterly meaningless without context.  Meta defines what heroes are picked and banned, not whether a hero is strong or not.  Bambi, for example, was pretty decent in 6.83 and is very strong now in 6.84 but is still not a popular choice because vulnerability to burst damage is one of her major weaknesses... and heroes with huge burst damage like Queen of Pain, Lina, and Lion are trending right now.  This doesn't make Bambi weak - she's far from it! - just not ""meta.""  To use your words, what an awful comparison.   Or just consider his none existent laning options and his retarded cast animations   wut?  His lanes are very flexible.  He can solo any lane, though he's usually put offlane.  If his lane goes poorly, he can easily jungle effectively, especially if he was able to get a level or two before needing to bail out of the lane.  Wiki curiously no longer has castpoint information available, but I think Doomy's castpoint is a pretty standard 0.5 sec - longer than most INT heroes and many AGI heroes, but pretty standard for STR heroes.  Buy a blinker (or lothar's) and it's nearly impossible to juke the doom unless you knew it was coming beforehand.  Doomy's strength is his versatility.  You pick a Doomy and you give nothing away about your strategy since, even though he's usually solo offlane, he doesn't have to be.  He can also build into a competent carry (alpha wolf crit is basically the same as Juggy crit), he can play as a hard support, or he can do anything in between.  So much of the hero's success depends on effective use of creep skills, and knowing what items to get and when to get them; I think Agh's-Refresher is a pretty fucking terrible item build order for most games, and even Agh's isn't really core (I'd honestly rather get a Silver Edge than Agh's in most cases.)  I tend to play him as a utility core role and tend to stack auras on him, with either a blinker or lothar's into eventual silver edge for initiation and mobility purposes (Doomy won't be revealed during invis until he's more or less completed his cast animation.)"
TrueDoTA2,39mfiy,Thalnagath,1 point,Sat Jun 13 17:45:41 2015 UTC,How has any of that changed since he was a first pick laner that could go into any of the 3 lanes?
TrueDoTA2,39mfiy,twersx,2,Sat Jun 13 22:25:05 2015 UTC,"From what I've been told, the changes to his ultimate in 6.82 were pretty big nerfs and have reduced his viability quite a bit. I don't have much experience with him myself so I myself am not sure how much they affected him."
TrueDoTA2,39mfiy,drakon136,1 point,Sat Jun 27 17:55:15 2015 UTC,"It's not that big of a nerf.  You need to get Agh's if you want to disable passives, but it still silences and disables items right out of the box, which was its primary use beforehand anyway (blink, doom, now they can't use BKB/meka/whatever in addition to being silenced.)  Doom still turns its victim into a creep, though they might be a really dangerous creep if they're some like Ursa, PA, etc and you don't have Agh's.  Still just a creep, though.  He's also a reasonably effective offlane that can go fuck off to the jungle after a level or two if the lane is going poorly for him, and the introduction of new and improved mud golems was a huge boost for him, giving him access to a free long-range stun that does 125 damage.  And if he dies?  You get two (incredibly cute) Doomlings that also have a long-range stun that does 125 damage, though they tend to die very quickly since their HP stays a static 210.  This, in addition to the excellent creep skills he's always had access to.  It's a very weird thing, because he's very good at fighting early.  Lvl ? Death completely fucks everyone that hits the level multiplier for it (a big thing with Doomy is to take a value point in it early on and proceed to bend anyone that just dinged lvl 6 over a barrel until they can finally sneak in enough XP to get to lvl 7), he basically gets a free Radiance through his W, and Devour ensures he always has a minimum level of farm, even if he's doing nonstop pushing and fighting with his team.  It also means he's a pretty effective semi-support pick since he gets a guaranteed minimum GPM taking only one creep (any creep) every 40 sec."

Its a LOT more rewarding to build an item that allows you to pick off lone targets (orchid is one of the best for that) instead of bulking up and trying to manfight. Seeing as misplays are very prominent the lower you go on the MMR ladder it really pays off to build in such a way.  Don't be surprised, after you reach a certain MMR, you won't be able to do this, you'll need to adapt your build because enemies will rarely go alone and if they see you with 0 hp items they won't hesitate to initate on you if you're reckless with your positioning."

You'll almost never see an isolated Kunk pick without being backed up by a Shadow Demon and anybody else who can manfight with boat buff, and even then his win and pick rate isn't that great. His laning as a support is terrible, so he pretty much has to participate in a two man roam effort. He needs to hit level five to have a reliable long range stun, for fuck's sake.

TrueDoTA2,39mfiy,slowmotionjohns,-3,Sat Jun 13 00:36:17 2015 UTC,"Right, so here's why I think you are wrong about Kunkka in this meta; I've taken to playing him a ton this patch, because I found him to be so enjoyable, and what things that need to be noted for Kunkka as a midlane;  1) He has ludicrous lane presence. With Tidebringer's constant harass, and the threat of constant torrents, he makes his opponent constantly fearful. X adds to it by allowing him to refill his bottle and hp at the cost of a TP scroll.  2) He is a ruthlessly effective ganker. Caught a hero in torrent? They're doomed. Caught a hero with an X? They're dead. Constantly slaughter people and get away scot-free with the rum buff.  3) He scales magnificently into late game. Seriously, prepare for one hit rampages.  So why is mid Kunkka so often lauded? He's played wrong, that's why.   Kunkka is a terrible initiator; like flat out awful. Everyone sees the boat coming so far in advance it might as well have sent a notice ahead by post. This might not seem as significant as you think, but Christ it really is. Opening a fight, Kunkka has missed his ultimate, or best case scenario just caught on guy out of the loop and whacked is HP down a peg. Congratulations, no rum buff, no major AoE damage; the hero is totally wasted.  What Kunkka seems to do better than any other hero I've seen so  far, is counter-initiating.  Did that enemy Magnus just pull off a four man RP? Well thanks for the initiation, pal; you just centered the fight in an area where I can get a four man rum-buff and smash a frigate into your entire team.  When the fight starts, Kunkka becomes its Captain, capable of directing it how he wishes. Rum basically doubles the HP of his team, something that no other hero in the game can do, while also doing massive damage to his enemy.   As a lane dominator, Kunkka is a First Mate. As a ganker, Kunkka is a Captain. And while as a primary initiator, Kunkka may be a Cabin Boy; as a counter-initiator, he's the mother-fucking ADMIRAL!"
TrueDoTA2,39mfiy,Redrum01,1 point,Sat Jun 13 02:44:49 2015 UTC,"Kunkka is my most played hero across three different accounts. I play him twice as much as my next most played hero. Trust me, I know the dumbass hero.  I was also talking competitive support Kunkka, not pub core Kunkka. Pub Kunkka has a ton of problems, but he's still a valid pubstomper.   1) He has ludicrous lane presence.    Frankly, I think his lane domination is overrated. Higher MMR brackets are less susceptible to getting shit on by constant Tidebringer harass, and he's not great against a lot of popular mids right now. You're also committing most of your skillbuild to Tidebringer, which leads to the next point   2) He is a ruthlessly effective ganker.   This depends entirely on your early game skill build. If you're going for lane dominator, you're probably sitting on something like 1-3-1-1, 2-2-1-1, something that's more Tidebringer focused, maybe some extra attention to Torrent for the extra stun duration. The more points you have to pump into X-Mark for added range, the less likely you are to overpower your lane opponent.   So until you've pumped at least two or three points in X, you're only real ganking options need either   A high risk high reward fog Torrent, so good luck with that. More likely a set-up stun from a Venge or a WK or whatever, and that depends hugely on whether or not your teammates are dipshits who can't draft.    3) He scales magnificently into late game. Seriously, prepare for one hit rampages.   Yeah, if you're prepared to build a fucking rapier every game to boost your crit damage to something like 1800, 1900ish depending on the item build. At a 25% or 44% rate, depending on how many Daedaluses you're sitting on. Which goes to the biggest point:   Core Kunkka needs a fucking ton of farm to be effective as a rightclicker, and even then he's hugely unreliable. After all the space and gold and XP you've committed, you're banking on a hero that reaches his full damage potential maybe a quarter his attacks every four seconds, in melee range. I used to joke about how pre-6.84 Kunk was Bad Ember Spirit, but with all the new competitive shifts and rebuffs, he's right back to pre-6.79 Bad Gyrocopter."

TrueDoTA2,39mlq5,calky,13,Fri Jun 12 20:24:09 2015 UTC,"I think there is a lot of coordination that needs to go on that holds him back in pubs.  Some of the main problems:   Very low range level 1 stun   In pro matches, SK will often start with Boots -- that is very hard to do in pubs if you are supporting since often you are doing it alone or the other support builds greedy  Jungle Stacking is more difficult without cooperation   In pro matches, both supports will often be stacking ==> this helps SK get a super fast blink You also need time to go stack which is harder to find when your carry might be bitching that they need support, or you need to pull -- timing can get pretty difficult to be in all the right places at the right times  His ult is delayed   A lot of people might find it hard to use because you need to predict whether or not the other team is going to commit to the fight, then where they will be when your channel finishes During channel time, they can also cancel your blink (prior to BKB) if you are not careful about your positioning and timing (e.g. Zeus ults, get zapped by Pugna ward)  Not everyone is very good. I'd wager most of the dota population is under 3500 MMR. There are a lot of nuances they probably don't get/don't abuse, like:   Efficiently jungling SK in general Shift-queueing his ult, blink, and stun    (TBH - his ult is probably confusing as hell for a lor of newer players. I remember when I started in WC3 Dota, I constantly cancelled my ult without realizing that you needed to channel for a few seconds, then you could move)  Juking with Sand Storm Getting good stuns off Abusing caustic finale  Also, general pub picks make it hard for real 2nd support picks   A lot of people pick super greedy in pubs and SK is also a slightly greedier pick himself There are a ton of games where someone picks SK and then another player goes and picks LC or some really inefficient jungler and calls jungle ==> now SK is stuck solo supporting as a melee support that really needs farm to do shit There are a lot of invis hero picks in pubs ==> Dust and Sentries become a lot more efficient    (this is kind of a minor point, but still has a bit of a negative impact on performance)   People tunnel vision on SK's items and don't adapt   Most players have a cookie-cutter formula of SK's item progression You can make him work with items other than Blink, Arcanes, etc.. if the match calls for it (especially if you are behind or did not get access to the farm you need)  There are other little things too like...   Showing Blink before using it to get kills Not abusing fog of war in early game Jungling from lvl 1 Only jungling and never rotating for ganks"

TrueDoTA2,39mlq5,Thalnagath,5,Fri Jun 12 22:21:17 2015 UTC,"Don't pay any attention to dotabuff winrates. You have to keep in mind that the vast majority of games are played below the 4k skill level so there are lots of people who have no idea how to pull off the epi/blink/burrow combo, or just miss stuns all the time, or don't know how to jungle him efficiently. Wisp has one of the bottom 3 winrates on dotabuff but obviously he's one of the most picked heroes in competitive dota with a high winrate as well. The fact that aghs is the third most popular item on him also verifies this because the cost-to-damage ratio of aghs is so abysmal compared to veil, which has far greater utility anyway.   Anyways the only thing I'd disagree with your analysis of SK is his early roaming potential. He sucks in early levels because lvl 1-2 burrowstrike has zero range so a setup slow/stun is almost required. There are far better early ganking supports than SK. He also sucks ass as a lane support for the same reasons, on top of being melee."
TrueDoTA2,39mlq5,jookz,6,Fri Jun 12 20:45:29 2015 UTC,"I don't think you can write off dotabuff trends that easily and blame it on skill.

TrueDoTA2,39mlq5,Thalnagath,2,Sun Jun 14 01:49:49 2015 UTC,"His stun range level 1 is tiny and level 1 sandstorm does zero damage, and when he moves to the jungle he makes your lanes weaker. SK needs to soak level 3 by pulling or sitting in lane, and he is a shitty lane support. Without people helping him stack even once he hits level 3 without stacks his blink will be very slow, as well as it is easy for enemies to invade the jungle and stop him from farming or at the least steal experience from him."
TrueDoTA2,39mlq5,ferret_80,2,Fri Jun 12 22:19:18 2015 UTC,"-A support with terrible laning presence (probably the biggest reason)  -Needs to be in a team with early kill potential to effective early game (e.g. paired with another roaming support)  -A support that needs lvls and Blink to be effective, but also does not scale well into late game  That said he's very strong in the right team compositions, but I would definitely not classify him as a general purpose support."
TrueDoTA2,39mlq5,Skyro620,2,Fri Jun 12 23:40:28 2015 UTC,"Sand king is the hardest hero in Dota to master. Up there with Invoker and Earth Spirit.  He has Burrow strike and sandstorm on cool down every ~10 seconds and pretty much has high play potential and reaction time decision making to do with both these spells.   Initiating in general is one of the most difficult things to to do. Compared to Invoker and Earth Spirit, Sand King epicenter has to play with vision and you can't whiff burrow strike and have to play like Puck to get 2-3 man burrow strikes that aren't point target obvious.   People also overbuild Aghs on him, and even force staff I'd argue. Neither are weak items, but people don't build resistance and regen items on him enough. He's about getting Eli off, but also about staying alive to get as many burrow strikes as possible.   Getting 10 spells off during a team fight as CM is kind of like the positioning test. Getting 4 good burrow strikes off in a team fight duration is sand King's goal."
TrueDoTA2,39mlq5,wildtarget13,1 point,Sat Jun 13 00:12:05 2015 UTC,Looking at the laning stats he has a 47% winrate when jungling and 57% when playing safe lane and is mostly played in the jungle. I'm not sure how dotabuff does that classification so it's hard to say exactly what that means but it's clearly significant.

My MMR is 3,500 but I was calibrated back when I started and definitely have improved since then but haven't played public MMR to raise it. That said, when I play 3.5k public games as Sand King I often get asked to solo support, or buy wards and courier at least, and rarely find time to stack because the lanes are too weak without me. I too was surprised when I found these things to be true even at 3.5k, so I think in the vast majority of pubs you just aren't seeing SKs getting a sub-10-minute blink. My last few pub blink times were shit and I still managed to deal the most damage on the team a few times from the 5-position as SK."

He's a counter to so many strong heroes this patch and can absolutely dominate most lanes.  He doesn't turn into an OD-style right-click carry regardless of how many kills he gets (ok well with enough you probably do), but his DPS cannot be ignored either as it's pure damage with a remarkable range.  His issue is simply BkB which is why he's not a good front-liner.  He does ok with an OC (mostly due to the CD reduction on the global) but works better with traditional int items.

Kotl max mana leak has its place as does max enfeeble.   They compliment each other as nightmare into illuminate is wicked sick and kotl provides the AOE while Bane provides bigger single target.

TrueDoTA2,39ix9n,Turtlez4lyfe,3,Fri Jun 12 09:52:29 2015 UTC,"Good and best are relative, right? A good support duo can do whatever you want them to do in the right situation.  What I mean is there is a good support duo for roaming which will be different from a good support duo who can help you play defensively.   I don't like running WW with oracle, or oracle with dazzle because in my opinion they accomplish the same task. They are both heavily defensive supports, in my opinion. Both can bring a player back up in no time.   Vs and sky are pretty strong.roamers.   Veno and AA can wreck a team fight.   Shadow demon and potm have a place.   It seriously all depends on lanes and heroes. What are you looking to accomplish with your draft?"
TrueDoTA2,39ix9n,ProfessorMonocle,1 point,Fri Jun 12 04:29:09 2015 UTC,"I guess I shouldn't have used ""best"", also I was thinking about support picks that are usually not seen together or seems strong on paper.  like the WW + oracle duo like you said they're both pretty defensive and that's why they're not usually picked together (not to mention oracle isn't in cm yet) but at the same time greedy cores that like to be in your face when fighting can exploit this two, think axe/lesh."
TrueDoTA2,39ix9n,goblinbiddin,3,Fri Jun 12 04:47:54 2015 UTC,"It's hard to beat the WD/Lion support pair. Both have 600 range and >50 damage. Both have stuns (lion has hex as well). Both take farm well, neither needs all that much to be effective. They're good in trilanes or when split into duals. Lion has great pickoff potential and WD has amazing teamfight if left alone. Both can still be effective against BKB (with WD ult being physical and blink->hex being too fast to react to)  The only big weakness these two heroes have, as a pair, is neither pushes all that well. In organized play, this is typically fine, but when i play pub CM, i actually have a tendency to pick WD/Warlock instead, just so i can be reasonably sure towers will eventually end up going down. That being said, i would only consider giving this duo away if i had an omniknight."
TrueDoTA2,39ix9n,PeenoyDoto,3,Fri Jun 12 05:17:05 2015 UTC,"WD/Warlock is very strong, flattening enemies with golem when WD pops Death Ward makes for at least 2 seconds of 600 dps attacks, and then you can channel Upheaval after to ensure that enemies stay as long as possible in range of the ward."
TrueDoTA2,39ix9n,Carnot_AoR,3,Fri Jun 12 07:26:25 2015 UTC,"Orcle winds up being a part of a lot of strong support duos. Oracle-Dazzle is very strong, though they lack the ability to gank without setup.   Oracle-Io is extraordinarily strong, primarily because Edict+Ghost on the Io makes it nigh invulnerable while Tether+False Promise results in a ridiculous amount of healing. Purifying Flames+Tether is great for sustain in the laning stage and fights, Oracle is a monster given enough mana early, and Oracle can solo zone an offlaner if Io is run in a mid or aggro dual lane.  However, probably the best support duo in the game is Oracle-Chen. There are the obvious synergies (eg. Edict-Test of Faith[enemy], Hand of God-False Promise), but they pair nicely on a strategic level as well (eg. strong ganking duo, Chen makes up for Oracle's lack of push, Oracle shines in the late game as Chen falls off). What makes the combo obscene, however, is this little fellow.   The purge removes Purifying Flames heal and slows heavily on a low CD. If you get the creep in range, its a guaranteed kill if the target doesn't have an escape and isn't TA with refraction up. You just Flames/Purge, Flames/End, Flames/Purge, Flames and autoattack and the hero is dead (450/810/1170 magical damage at levels 2/3/5). So Chen lending a creep means Oracle can basically solo kill any hero, which applies an intolerable amount of pressure to the enemy mid and offlaner."
TrueDoTA2,39ix9n,Lazarous86,2,Fri Jun 12 13:49:48 2015 UTC,"I am a big fan of bane, mirana. Sleep into arrow makes smoke ganks effective and easy to land. Mid game the moonlight shadow lets bane use his ult more effectively too. A lot of good synergy between these two."
TrueDoTA2,39ix9n,freelance_fox,2,Fri Jun 12 14:39:37 2015 UTC,"I think the best support duo in 6.84 might be Wyvern + Bounty Hunter. I've seen that duo played to great effect by a few Chinese pro teams and they have a nice mix of physical/magical damage, BKB-piercing, utility, and an overabundance of mobility and the ability to frustrate their opponents.   As far as pocket strats, I have a couple support combos that are sick ""On paper...,"" as Synd would say, but I've never really seen in major tournaments. Mostly because several of them involve Oracle and the other one is... Kunkka + IO. Kunkka IO is all about abusing mobility and rushing a bottle on IO obviously. This one depends on a core hero to provide the set-up stun probably. The other combo I love is Leshrac + Oracle, or any of its derivatives. Any dual lane where SD or Bane is used as a set-up stun, replace SD or Bane with Oracle. Oracle's Q can set up just like Disruption, for a full 2.5s, if you play it where Oracle initiates. Leshrac and Oracle just happen to have a ton of other synergy."
TrueDoTA2,39ix9n,wildtarget13,1 point,Fri Jun 12 22:47:03 2015 UTC,Wyvern+ Bounty sounds cool. Wyvern is a good babysitter and bounty is a good roamed. A slow wyvern is made stronger with track. Track...technically has synergy with wyvern ultimate.   The weirdest problem though is probably they can't trilane and if they do there's only slows and its level dependent
TrueDoTA2,39ix9n,HRP,1 point,Sat Jun 13 02:03:39 2015 UTC,Disruptor and literally any other support with CC.  Glimpse into a stun into a Kinetic is a dead hero.
TrueDoTA2,39ix9n,j0a3k,2,Fri Jun 12 14:38:12 2015 UTC,"In most ganks, just getting the glimpse into kinetic field is more than enough to ensure a hero dies unless you're glimpsing them way too close to their team/tower.  A simple extra stun is horribly uninspired.  As far as support + disruptor picks I like the following in relatively thought out order:   Undying.  Early game if they leave their tower for even a second it becomes a stupidly easy kill unless they have a blink style ability.  Tombstone -> glimpse back into it -> KF to hold them in it.  Level 2 on your supports means the offlane hero goes to his jungle if he has any sense at all.  In this meta I think winning early is the most important thing you can do and this duo punishes errors in positioning that wouldn't even be errors except for them being in the game.  Huge psychological advantage to making the map outside of tower range so dangerous. WD.  Level 6 becomes nightmarish for ganking and team fight potential.  KF+SS+LOOKATITGO.  Simple enough, WD does way more damage if you can't outrange his ultimate and can't cast a spell to interrupt it.  Combo that with tremendous early harass and sustain in the lane, plus KF to stop the target from getting out of cask bounce range in earlier ganks, and you have a winning combo. Warlock.  KF into slow into glimpse is hilarious DPS uptime before BKBs come out, plus when you hit 6 your KF becomes the fire and thunderdome while the warlock golem gets free hits on the trapped hero after the stun made it impossible for them to get past the barrier before it fully forms.  There is huge counterinitiation and initiation potential when used correctly. AA.  Pretty much this hero combos well with anyone who can ensure his ult hits, but unappreciated synergy is cold feet proc, the ability to hold people in AA's W that increases spell damage, and another good ranged hero to trilane with to get chilling touch attacks off who makes up for AA's inability to guarantee early kills by himself. ES.  Ever thrown that fissure that just barely let their carry escape?  Well not anymore!  With his trademark kinetic field® and glimpse® you'll be laughing the entire time it takes for their battered corpse to respawn.  Also late game if the disruptor can get an aghs up the potential of instant aoe stunlock initiation into KF+SS with the inability to BKB means the other team is probably going to have to rat so hard to win that they better actually be clones of admiral bulldog...unless they have a silencer or aghs omni across the map. CM.  Helps your early mana, can set up KF, and can throw huge aoe damage with her ult into a good KF+SS.  After this hero I think the synergy gets worse, or at least more boring. Venge.  Sounds better than it actually works.  Usually you want to save your swap for defense or high value initiations rather than doing a cheeky swap into KF+SS plays.  There is synergy with any lockdown but nothing too special."

TrueDoTA2,39iphx,Romp-,8,Fri Jun 12 00:08:22 2015 UTC,"Her big weakness as an offlaner is that she's not good at trading hits. You can be zoned out of experience range by a good solo support like skywrath, witch doctor or silencer.  At level 1 she starts with 473 health, 38-49 damage and 1.8 armor. As she's ranged you can't get a stout shield, so you might go for a tango, salve, ring of protection and a circlet. You've still only got 511 health, 40-51 damage and 5.1 armor. If you want more damage to trade hits then you either need to get less regen or less health/armor, neither of which you can really do without.  If you compare her stats to a tanky melee hero who gets stout shield like SB, centaur, clockwek or axe, they have 100-300 more starting HP and with armor + damage block that comes out to around twice as much effective HP. Leap is great to allow you to get in range of creeps with an escape, but 30 second cooldown at lvl 1 is a long time to have to wait to go and contest last hits and xp compared to 15 seconds for QoP blink or WR windrun.  PotM does well as an offlaner in some situations but if they have a skilled solo support on a good zoner hero then you're going to have an absolutely horrible game. You can't farm the jungle to catch up, your only option is to go shoot arrows at mid."
TrueDoTA2,39iphx,LukasDG,3,Fri Jun 12 05:37:16 2015 UTC,Honestly i find that potm offlane is extremely underwhelming unless you do an agressive tri with 2 very very solid heroes. Solo offlane leads to you being zoned out very easily with quick calls when you're missing. Dual off sometimes works but only if their safelane is quite passive and don't have good defensive supports.
TrueDoTA2,39iphx,dotr,2,Fri Jun 12 03:35:19 2015 UTC,"Her turn rate is abysmal for a hero that relies on getting in and out of the action quickly. I can't play her anymore because of that. Plus, low mana pool, low attack damage."
TrueDoTA2,39iphx,wickedmike,2,Fri Jun 12 12:58:43 2015 UTC,"Mirana's one of the most viable heroes in pretty much any role. She works as an offlaner because she's got 600 range, she has a good escape, and because you can just build her knowing your not going to get much farm and still function.  She can also roam, go mid, get a kill there with arrow, and then come on right back.  Pretty much get 0-1-1-0 and then you can do whatever you want afterwards."

TrueDoTA2,39iphx,AbareKiller,1 point,Sat Jun 13 00:52:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah, if you're offlane. Medium radiant cliff is the same distance to mid. So is dire medium camp close to top rune and mid. And you might as well devote to roaming if you're getting zoned out. If you can't get a support to help counter push you're draft is weak to the early safe lane pushing your offlane anyways. Especially if Mirana doesn't have leap.  You can always get a tp with your medium camp money. If they push minute two then you should either have gotten something from the lane."
TrueDoTA2,39iphx,wildtarget13,3,Sat Jun 13 02:07:37 2015 UTC,"I have to disagree with going whatever you want after 1 point in leap and arrow. I see people max arrow with 0 points in starfall and it seems atrocious, but I see pros do this build from time to time.  From my personal experience, the hero's viability is much higher when you don't have to rely on hitting difficult arrows, and you can burst damage much more effectively. You can also push lanes, and farm quicker with starfall.   Really the only situation I can see that justifies maxing arrow with 0 points in starfall is when you have a ridiculously long setup for arrow, from bane or shadow demon.  I'd suggest going 0/1/1/0 into either 4/1/1/1 or 3/1/2/1 by level 7, maxing starfall at level 8 then doing whatever you want."
TrueDoTA2,39iphx,thekoven,5,Fri Jun 12 01:36:32 2015 UTC,Technically the most efficient way to play would be to max arrow. It's the most damage for the cheapest price. No point maxing out starfall if you don't have the mana to spam it.  But obviously this is me being facetious considering I'm assuming the Mirana picker would hit every arrow which is a bit of a fever dream.
TrueDoTA2,39iphx,EDJE,3,Fri Jun 12 01:38:40 2015 UTC,"While I wouldn't expect every arrow to land, in my opinion there's real merit to max arrow; you pick Mirana for the arrow after all, and if the player isn't landing them, you're probably losing anyway. I subscribe to the philosophy of go big or go home.  If it's Captains Mode and I want a Mirana you can be sure I'm drafting multiple setups for it."
TrueDoTA2,39iphx,mjjdota,2,Fri Jun 12 19:20:29 2015 UTC,The great thing about potm is that even with lackluster accuracy on arrows she's still worth picking for her ult if nothing else.
TrueDoTA2,39iphx,Thalnagath,1 point,Fri Jun 12 23:08:20 2015 UTC,"I try to build lots of items with stats, or mana regen and almost buy bottle every game as either roaming or offlane mirana. Wand, Phase, Bottle, and Aquila pretty much every game. Then usually drums. I guess if you skip doing this you'd definitely have mana problems and maxing Arrow would be best. It completely transforms her into a different hero not having starfall though, and if you have the mana the combo of arrow leap and starfall is deadly burst to most heroes."
TrueDoTA2,39iphx,thekoven,3,Fri Jun 12 02:07:01 2015 UTC,"People when roaming might get 0-3-2. This is because there's no chance that you'll have the stats or mana pool to cast star fall. Compared to some games where after minute ten you've found bottle and upgraded  boots, you actually get to use star fall. Many games as a support Mirana, you hardly want to be in the middle of fights to get a 4 man starfall.   Some games you do want to max starfall by 7 just because you need to catchup in farm. Some games, you'll just be continuing roaming with arrows and likely will hit more arrows than starfalls for the next 10 minutes. Heck, if you aren't hitting any arrows because of good positioning from summons or flying vision you might change your plan halfway through."
TrueDoTA2,39iphx,wildtarget13,1 point,Fri Jun 12 02:34:39 2015 UTC,I dont like her solo offlane. She cant pressure enough in a 1v2 situation vs most heroes and leap cd is long on early levels.  offtopic: You Mirana players should try blink dagger! Blink does so much work for me since you can reliable double starstorm now.   Arrow/other disable --> Blink Starstorm and leap out if necessary. You can't just leap in in 80% of the situations.

The Powershot buff never should've happened, either - 2600 range doesn't really allow it to do anything it didn't already do at 1800.

TrueDoTA2,39iphx,EDDE12345678,1 point,Fri Jun 12 20:16:58 2015 UTC,"So... This isn't what you asked (of course she's viable offlane), but I've been thinking about what it is that made PoTM such a strong pick back in 6.82. Her utility, duh. Well since then the only change to Mirana was the Starstorm buff, and I'm starting to feel like even in a core role Mirana is more of a caster than a physical DPSer.  To elaborate, with her recent buffs, dropping level 4 Starstorm in the middle of a teamfight at level 7 is about the most devastating thing Mirana can do. It does buttloads of damage now, and with the buff to the additional star she can actually focus down a target rather than just YOLO-ing it.   So, I was thinking about ways to maximize this damage. Even if it was just as simple as adding Veil to your normal support/offlane/mid Mirana build, I think that, from any position 2-5, items that amp her magic damage are totally worth it. As a 1 position Mirana I would never recommend this build though. I tried farming Veil/Refresher/Octarine Core/Eblade as a 1-position against bots and it just felt silly, even if I was wiping the whole enemy team with double Starstorm double Veil. The marginal benefit of an early Veil on someone like offlane or 4-pos Mirana, though, could be huge. As could a lategame E-blade, to focus down the enemy carry with Leap -> Veil -> Eblade -> Starstorm. Even with a support Mirana that would deal upwards of 1000 damage, plus tank her up and amp her teammates' magic damage too."
TrueDoTA2,39iphx,freelance_fox,2,Fri Jun 12 00:33:58 2015 UTC,"I think you're just being a really good theory crafter at this point. Mirana with etherEal Dagon was one of the first stupid builds I tried that worked. Then I tried veil and so many items. She's probably one of my first heroes I tried like 4 different builds on.  Her damage is actually terrifying but doesn't have any scaling damage from her spells. It doesn't mean you can't right click hard on her. Leap technically but it's not a factor of damage rather than survivability early game.   The thing with ethereal first or veil first is you highly stray from your ability to right click in fights with limited damage and no BKB. A euls solves a lot of these issues if you want to stick to utility instead of manta. Lotus orb and linkers are also options.  I think veil is a situational build as it doesn't give as much single target potential as ethereal and there are both games where team fights will happen too often or not often enough.   But ethereal is a slot you probably won't sell, and at most you'll change it into a butterfly if you realize you have the only farm on the team."
TrueDoTA2,39iphx,wildtarget13,2,Fri Jun 12 02:41:02 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna run it in a few pubs this weekend and report back. Veil and Mjollnir together is a terrifying amount of magic damage, so I'm thinking in games where magic damage is already strong (e.g. The enemy carry doesn't want to build BKB and their supports are squishy) that either rushing Maelstrom into a casual Veil or vice-versa would be nice.   To answer your concerns more directly, yes Veil would be a diversion from your physical damage, but I'm saying that Mirana isn't much of a physical DPSer anyway until she gets items and that the game impact of an early Veil is worth it, especially on a hero who's virtually guaranteed to deal ~400 damage per hero plus even more to the main target. Even on a support Mirana, if your whole teamfight contribution was just Veil and 1 or 2 Starstorms you still did a ton of damage. Not many heroes have so much versatility and a nuke that pairs well with Veil.   Veil is pretty much never the go-to build on anyone because it gets countered so hard by BKB, but this is a nice trick for support or offlane Mirana IMO. Sort of like rushing Veil on an offlane Jakiro or Sand King."
TrueDoTA2,39iphx,freelance_fox,2,Fri Jun 12 20:35:07 2015 UTC,"The maelstrom synergy is good and maelstrom first would increase your farm speed. But maelstrom first games, regardless of the hero, doesn't want to follow a build that is 100% weak to BKB. A yasha into veil would even make more sense.   If you're versus heroes that suck with BKB at the same timing as your items like Morphling, Spectre, or Slark, it's a decent choice.   Miranda does do DPS once she has basic stats items. It really is overstated because early game Miranda hits for nothing. But her stat gain doesn't feel weak and star storm isn't strong except on the double star storm target and becomes more of a small thing. Miranda has the attack speed to make weird damage lite item builds work.  Go diffusal even, orchid, or butterfly. Or get an ethereal blade so if you can own them around BkBs you can get Dagon 5."

Definitely a help for mid if support cannot rotate mid as much as they can.    Very mobile , good aoe for depush , can secure some farm even with extreme zoning from opposition , diffusal changes benefit her the most , only need bottle , don't need to walk all the way toward mid to help - just shoot arrow and back to lane , can be anti leshrac idk.  but it is too unusual - people will hate you for this. offlane potm is okay ish if you can get your bottle super early , not worth it if your team need reliable crowd control over dps. So it is VERY situational , let say your team is already complete for both teamfight and small skirmishes then additional dps will never hurt. Only if Icefrog give better starting agi or agi gain per level , she could be good offlane or maybe improve base regen like they did to Nyx Assassin?    2-1-2 is starting becoming a thing even in pro games , not much to complain if you go with this composition.

TrueDoTA2,39ga1l,theintellectualguy,19,Thu Jun 11 15:00:39 2015 UTC,"I think it's really easy to get caught up in what you are doing and forget about the strategy portion of the game. You can improve mechanics but you'll plateau quickly. Decision making is where the big jump comes.  Try to think 30 seconds to one minute ahead of what you are doing.    Who is on the map? Who is not on the map? Where would you be if you were a missing hero on the map? Are you on the map for them? Where are the waves on the map, what camps are alive, what camps are stacked? What time is it - when can Rosh come up? how far from the next rune? the next stack timing? Where are your teammates on the map, is there potential for an efficient rotation / meet up for gank / objective? What time does the next core item come in for hero X, and can you time that with a meet up for a gank / objective?   Eg. you're playing against a Nature's Prophet or a Tinker, the game becomes can I predict where he'll be in 15s / 30s / how long it will take me to walk to and set up on said location. We don't automatically think that way for other heroes but we should. We should be saying well that Alchemist is clearing the wave there so he'll probably be at their ancients in 15 seconds and we have 3 heroes closeby, they have 1 showing on the map so there could be 4 with the Alchemist, I'll clear the camp I'm at and smoke, check Roshan, check Ancients, if all is clear we'll jump on whoever TPs to farm at their T2. That sort of thing.  Even just farming efficiently requires some amount of planning and consideration of the information you have and of what is unknown.  TLDR: Of course you can't consider everything, but the best way to improve is just don't stop thinking"

Like bloodseeker you just have to be careful about yourself (not staying on low hp, if you aren't carry hero you'll most likely get tranquils or some kind of constant regen to hold up that hp, in case of rupture try to tp out asap etc.) Assuming you might have same net worth as Bloodseeker, in case of eul combo you can propably manfight him in usual cases, it still heavily depends on how the game goes, but you got an idea"

Random, playing every hero will give you not only the ability to play them better, but also how to play against them.  Learning every role is also vital.

TrueDoTA2,39ga1l,FreshExpress,2,Thu Jun 11 16:05:19 2015 UTC,"I think op should rather learn 2-3 heroes of each position. I don't like the idea of randoming simply because you won't get the repeated practice necessary to get good at a hero (unless you play a shit ton, which OP can't). Search for live games for that hero, watch replays and pause after a big teamfight, rewind, and ask what you would have done. If you want, you can condense it down to 3 positions for pubs - 1 2 are basically the same, 3 is a bit different, and 4 5 are also similar. Learning different playstyles based on position rather than hero should help your decision making and understanding of the game. Mechanics are mostly hero specific so just spam spam spam if you wanna get good at that one hero"

Ultimately, if you actively try to improve or not, you will get better at the game just from sheer experience in every aspect (decision making, itemchoices, ...).  I'm a fan of randoming.

Ideally you want to keep the creeps just outside tower range even as offlaner, so that the next wave also meets closer.  Another thing u have to keep in mind is that whether your own creeps are smacking the enemy creep/catapult or not. You have to make adjustments according to that. This is what makes last hitting the tower a real challenge. Otherwise yes, it is simple math."
TrueDoTA2,39ir09,TheBigBallsOfFury,3,Fri Jun 12 11:03:17 2015 UTC,"General rule is this ~ range creep, hit it once, let tower hit it twice, then kill. Melee creep, let towerhit it 5 times, then kill. Catapult, same as range except let tower get 3 hits. Aside from the general rule, this is just somethin that comes with experience.   Also it's way way easier with higher damage melee heroes. I can farm 85% of last hits nder tower with Void, so I don't mind having creeps under towers. Other heroes, i do everything i can to keep them outside tower range, including even tanking hits for a few seconds until my next allied creep wave arrives (of course try to kite them in a big arc around tower range, and sometimes this is not an option at all so you must let them under tower).   Know the general rule, then practice practice."
TrueDoTA2,39ir09,thurrs,1 point,Fri Jun 12 16:54:17 2015 UTC,Thanks for the tips. I think what I'm wondering about is more about the game states that would make different equilibrium points more favorable rather than the mechanics of last hitting.
TrueDoTA2,39ir09,thurrs,2,Fri Jun 12 21:51:58 2015 UTC,"Well I may be wrong here, but I think that unless you're attempting to push a lane, then you always want to maintain equilibrium just outside your tower range. Tower hits destroy equilibrium and push the lane. So if you were to draw aggro and pull creeps into tower range, that'd be a nice boost to get you started on a push. Otherwise, keep creeps out of the range while still keeping yourself in or very near your tower range so that you are in the safest possible farming position."
TrueDoTA2,39ir09,Last_Laugh,2,Fri Jun 12 22:39:31 2015 UTC,"offlaners want to CS under tower because it is safe, but carries don't because it's more difficult to get last hits   Getting level two or three can really open up an offlaners potential, while a carry wants to not push super hard (a tower nuking creepa does this) the offlaners will devour the exp."
TrueDoTA2,39ir09,dirtyslarkpicker,-2,Fri Jun 12 20:05:01 2015 UTC,"carries don't because it's more difficult to get last hits   How is it more difficult? Its simple math (i for one suck at math but can still do it because this one is really basic) and unless you get really unlucky with the tower hits you can literally lasthit every single creep under a tower in the first 7 mins - not counting catapults though, those you cant sometimes depends on a hero."
TrueDoTA2,39ir09,BeachSluts,2,Fri Jun 12 00:41:46 2015 UTC,I know there used to be heroes with damage deadzones where they couldn't get certain under tower cs without dropping/picking up items. Naix is a really good example of this due to his feast hitting for varying DMG based on the HP of the creep. I'm also pretty sure most of these are gone/different with the recent quelling blade changes.
TrueDoTA2,39ir09,twersx,1 point,Fri Jun 12 03:58:01 2015 UTC,"I mean its pretty simple. If your damage is above a certain point, the tower will reduce creep HP to a point where you can hit it once and kill it. If your damage is below that point, you would have to hit it twice, so you just hit the creep earlier on. Iirc that point is around 75 damage assuming you don't have minus armor or some other indirect damage boost."
TrueDoTA2,39ir09,pepe_le_shoe,1 point,Sat Jun 27 18:05:05 2015 UTC,"Regular creeps are ok, but you have to concentrate on last hitting a little more, so you can't devote as much mental energy to denying and dealing with the opposing laners, who are probably in xp range."
TrueDoTA2,39ir09,subraizada3_,0,Fri Jun 12 11:35:14 2015 UTC,"unless you get really unlucky with the tower hits you can literally lasthit every single creep under a tower in the first 7 mins   Completely agree. There have been some games where the opponents were pushing insanely hard or I was in a trilane with my supports pulling often, I just kited the creep wave around the tower and got complete free farm at the cost of half a tango for each creep wave (with a melee hero, of course - ranged heroes can't get Stout but they kite better anyway). I'm at 1800 MMR too so that's more evidence that last hitting under tower isn't something only pros can do."
TrueDoTA2,39ecis,goblinbiddin,2,Thu Jun 11 04:18:00 2015 UTC,"I'm assuming this is targeted toward newer players, and at lower levels I think the main issue is mentality more than anything else. If you simply keep the frame of mind that your (the supports) xp and farm is less important than the offlaners, then it essentially frames what you should be doing, i.e. trading your xp/gold for the offlaners from harassing is good, and makes understanding why things like single camp pulls can be detrimental since it pushes the lane and lets offlaner CS under tower for marginal xp/gold for the support.  But some additional points that you didn't mention:  -Map vision. If you have an advantage in lane and are going to be harassing, dewarding and maintaining superior map vision is critical. The goal is to present enough of a threat to the offlaner so they are afraid to come into the lane by simply not knowing where you are, as this allows to do other things such as rune control and pulls. This is also why it is very helpful to place an aggressive lane ward (typically by the river entrance near their offlane tower) so you know immediately when they leave the safety of their tower to contest the lane or rune.  -Harassment is more important at the start, where regen is in the form of consumables and if you are very successful it causes the offlaner to be underleveled/farmed to the point your carry can zone out the offlaner themselves and you can spend your time doing other things.  -Remember how I said it's all about mentality? What happens if you see an offlaner cheap out on just a single set of tangoes? Punish him. Trade hits in lane and just out regen him if need be. Checking your opponent's regen at the start of the game is something that should become a matter of routine.  -I am a firm, firm believer that the carry should be in charge of denying creeps. It creates less confusion (especially when yolo queuing), actually makes the carry a better carry (since they get more experience controlling creep equilibrium),  and doesn't require the support be anywhere close to the creep wave, and goes back to my whole point about staying hidden on the map. I've actually had supports believe they are being helpful staying near me ""in case I miss a CS"" so they can get it or something similarly ridiculous. No, you're not helping. Again, it's all in the mentality.  -Also you might want to put up a few example heroes which are good harassers."

TrueDoTA2,39ecis,mdk132,1 point,Fri Jun 12 01:00:29 2015 UTC,"I know this is focused on the support harassing/zoning, but when should the carry himself help out with zoning?"
TrueDoTA2,39ecis,TheBigBallsOfFury,1 point,Fri Jun 12 02:35:10 2015 UTC,"There's no easy answer to this question, but it falls somewhere between ""when he can"" and ""when he has to.""  A lot of this has to do with the style of the carry player, and which hero he's on. An aggressive carry player on a juggernaut should often get involved. A passive farming player playing an antimage should get involved only when necessary.  There are a few rules of thumb to keep in mind: if the carry can't farm because of the offlaner's presence in lane, he should probably be helping out with zoning. If the support(s) can kill the offlaner without the carry's help, he should probably just farm.  Generally, the easier the lane is, the more the carry should consider just hitting creeps, and the harder the lane is the more active he should become."
TrueDoTA2,39ecis,mdk132,1 point,Fri Jun 12 05:03:15 2015 UTC,"I think the carry should always be mindful about the support and the risk he puts himself in while trading hits with the offlaner.   Supports often rely on 2v1 advantage to scare away the offlaner and if the carry never bats an eye when his support is running away at 10% hp from the 20% hp timber, he is doing it wrong."
TrueDoTA2,39ecis,QuarkCatcher,1 point,Fri Jun 12 11:23:57 2015 UTC,"I agree. Even if the carry is a passive farming hero with no intention or actually harassing, simply running at the offlaner can scare him and let the support get extra right clicks in. It really adds up and can be the difference between the support winning or losing the trade."
TrueDoTA2,39ecis,WeavingTreads,1 point,Fri Jun 12 11:50:05 2015 UTC,"Usually if it's 2v1 and not 3v1 the carry will need to get involved at least once. Just like, don't die, try not to miss too much farm or take too much damage. You'll need to know your hero pretty well to get the most out of it in the first couple of levels, since the carry is typically picked for his strength in the late game."
TrueDoTA2,39ecis,cloudy100,1 point,Fri Jun 12 15:47:35 2015 UTC,"Good article, but it feels incomplete without a more detailed explanation of creep aggro. ""Try to stand away from creeps"" is much less pointed and effective advice than ""stay outside of the creep aggro radius, issue an attack command on your target, get out of aggro range within two seconds, and then repeat as necessary."" This technique is important even in lower levels because side lanes are often a carry with a single support, making it really difficult to create any space between the offlaner(s) and your creep wave."
TrueDoTA2,39ecis,phob,1 point,Sun Jun 14 18:26:54 2015 UTC,"I suppose I could have been more pointed in my description of how to avoid taking too many creep attacks, i'll consider revising the piece to put more emphasis on this sort of thing.   I do try to stay fairly high level/cerebral on these tho, it's about thinking the game the right way, the rest of the technical stuff sort of follows from that.  ""Focus on trying to avoid taking too many creep attacks while getting in as many autos as you can, and save your spells for when you think you can get a kill or you think it'll prevent a kill on you or an ally"" is better for ""thinking the game the right way"" than ""Stand out of creep aggro range when making your attacks, if you pull creeps with your attack, they will take about 2 seconds to reacquire your team's lane creeps""   I think most strong lane supports can zone out pretty effectively in 2v1 lanes if they play aggressively enough at level 1. That being said, I think the 3-1-1 is the best place to start from, and you really shouldn't stray from that unless you see a good reason to."
TrueDoTA2,39iwrc,Twistntie,9,Fri Jun 12 01:06:56 2015 UTC,"Unless you're the highest (hidden) MMR players searching for a game and you need to be matched with weaker players to have evenly matched teams, then you are in fact not better than your teammates since you get matched with them.   I play with my friends a lot of the time and it always feels like the people we get matched with are terrible. We're a mix between 2.5-5.5k mmr (mostly around 4-4.5k) so it's not usually that we're the best players online at the time. It's very easy to focus on the mistakes of the other people on our team while when my friends or I make a mistake it's easy to play it off as lag or bad luck.  Generally you're matched with people who win as many games as you do. Maybe that afk farming player wins a lot of games when his teammates are happy to play more defensive or make space for him without feeding. Maybe he feels that you guys play way too rambo and should be farming more instead of looking for fights all the time. Maybe he should be teamfighting but his farming skills are much better than yours and that's why he gets matched with you. Fact of the matter is that because he gets matched with you he's as good as you whether you believe it or not."
TrueDoTA2,39iwrc,LukasDG,6,Fri Jun 12 07:15:04 2015 UTC,"Consider that in any given match 5 players on each team combine to form a balanced 5v5 game (in terms of mmr), with some variability for the players who are rising quickly or falling quickly.     In your case, in top 15% or so of DotA players, we can assume that virtually all the players are mechanically sound. In fact, looking in at the posting (and looking up from my mmr), I'd go so far as to say most 4-4.5k players who maintain that rating without moving further are very good mechanically but lack strategic depth. The opposing team has 5 people of unknown skill and your team has 3 people, you, and your buddy.  Your issue is that your team CONSTANTLY lacks strategic vision.  By virtue of being 40% of your team, this virtually GUARANTEES that you and your buddy are at least partially at fault.     Breaking down your issues:   First, it sounds like your communication approach is probably awful. You came to truedota2 of all places to shitpost about teammates, when this barely qualifies as a main-sub rant.  Whether you believe it or not, you are likely toxic and likely getting repeatedly muted by teammates who do not want to deal with whatever you're spewing as ""advice"" and ""strategy"".  I'd go so far as to say whatever it is you're recommending is often outright wrong.  I'll get to that...    Enemies will gank, come out of nowhere, TP in, and then on OUR team, we'll ping, use mic, and they still sit in the jungle farming the easy camp.       No teamfighting, afk farming jungle when the enemy team pushes as 5 and it's clear that's their strategy.    It sounds like you're overly aggressive.  Consider the following scenario: You have a rune ward showing 2 enemies near top rune in the river, and no vision on any other enemies.  You ping to attack, go in, get one kill and then both get obliterated by the TP-in and gank of the other enemy teammates. You blame your team for not coming with you and whine you and your buddy have to ""make all the plays""... this is INCORRECT since your teammates correctly evaluated that without vision, the likelihood of a counter-initiation and wipe were very high, and refused to join you on a suicide mission where their presence would not have helped (particularly applicable to your hard carries who may not be properly farmed).  Alternatively, you did not give time for them to arrive, or they evaluated that by the time they rotated the opportunity would be lost, since the two enemies would leave the river. If you're being constantly ganked, it's an indication that you have poor positioning. For example, you and your friend push in to the enemy bot t2 as radiant, and rage at your team for failing to approach objectives with you (once again, feeling like YOU are the only ones responsible for team momentum).  You get ganked by an enemy team as 5 after 20 seconds of attacking the objective, having given them more than sufficient time to organize a counterattack.  Again, you've chosen a poor time to push and overextended versus your knowledge of enemy positioning. Enemy team pushes mid t1 which is at 33% health from chip damage at 15 minutes. You angrily ping and mic that you need to group to defend.  When no response is forthcoming, you attempt to do so yourself, and arrive and trade 1 kill for both deaths and the tower.  During this time the enemy is as 5, your 1 and 3 positions were getting free farm top and bottom lane in exchange for a relatively worthless t1 tower that they had no hope of saving. You and your friend may insist on laning together, and generally pick in to a 2-man set that may not fit with the indicated heroes of the rest of your team.  A secondary hard carry or core offlaner (or a lack of a 5-position causing a greedy lineup) failing to find farm because of your stack's moving in to a lane somebody else intended to occupy or be farm priority in causes them to be underfarmed, and thus spend time in the jungle to recover. Pinging them to arrive at teamfights is therefore relatively useless if they haven't acquired a key item or level (such as blink on an initiator).      of course, you can come back and say this just isn't true, or I just don't understand because you would have won all those fights if they showed up!!11!eleventy!  or whatever, but it SERIOUSLY sounds like you're trying to force game pacing at inadvisable times and into bad teamfights, and have poor strategic awareness... the scenarios I outlined above are simply common mistakes that many people make at all levels.  Without matches or a dotabuff to review it's hard to say.  Finally, if you're worse than your bracket indicates, you'll naturally decline, and, additionally, it's likely that noticing the couple of bad teammates you get is observation bias if you're maintaining your VHS status, since you'll have around a 50% winrate."

TrueDoTA2,39iwrc,SeeImSane,-2,Fri Jun 12 15:06:46 2015 UTC,"We had a guy in one of our matches call himself Nostradamus, saying we were going to lose. He ended up running himself into the enemy team, being out of position in every fight, and muting everyone.   Eventually he began to say that he was correct that we would lose, and our team was bad, and that's why he's Nostradamus.   Was he right at the beginning, or did he make his prediction happen? It's hard to rationalize a saying you expect to happen when you make it happen."

TrueDoTA2,39iwrc,mriswith-,2,Mon Jun 15 16:50:15 2015 UTC,"Sure ""those matches"" happen to everybody and even result in runs of several matches at times. But by and large those people appear on the enemy team as well and furthermore are, if anything, much more likely to appear, in greater numbers, at lower brackets. It fails to address why you don't also consider how often that happens to you from an enemy feeder. Overall you're either as good as the other team and maintain, generally worse and lose rating, or generally better and gain it. It sounds like you've gotten to the point where you've hit your skill wall and need to re-evaluate your play and improve. Asking to be reset to another bracket is just giving up.  For example: was nostradamus outright intentionally feeding or simply bad? If the former, write off that game and don't worry.  If the latter, when out of position, what hero was he and where should he have been? And more importantly... WHY was he out of position? What could you have done to accommodate his positioning? Use it to bait? Work around by split pushing while he drew aggro?   Finally, to reiterate, as long as your attitude is to approach the game as a 2v8 you're going to get one. you're in the upper reaches of all dota players, so if it's a 3v5 or 2v5 you HAVE to consider your own situational role and positioning to continue to improve."

I don't have any of the issues you've described.  I'm always sure to be polite to my team mates, because being a sarcastic chode or rude cunt actually decreases your chances of winning, and of course its just nicer to be a nice person.  If my team mates are doing something I'd rather them not, I very carefully phrase my suggestion in a constructive way, rather than a demanding or condescending way.  Its not easy, but you get the hang of it.  Wanting to go into a lower bracket so that you can stomp is the wrong approach for sure."

Oh also I'm not sure if you purposefully meant to cut off the beginning of the sentence or not, as it has some context.  So why can't we carry our team to victory? Because you can't win 2 or 3v5, when the enemy team is consistently playing better than our team.  We're pinging the location we need to defend and telling people both generally and specifically (so there's no Bystander Effect) what needs to happen in a ""we need this to happen"" tone.  We never said we want to stomp, and I'd actually implore you help me find it so I can rephrase.

What you have to realize is that it is impossible for your team mates to always be bad and your enemies to always be good.  That isn't how the game works.

This is a game where one team has to win, and one has to lose, there are no draws, and there's no feature that hands wins to people who play worse than their opponents.  You have to recognize that there's a difference between what you want to do, and what must be done to win.

You're on a dota theorycrafting forum looking for someone to tell you that it's ok to throw games on purpose so that your hidden mmr drops and you can play vs weaker opponents, because you can't hack it vs the ones you're matched against now. We see right through it, and we don't give a shit. Do what you want, your hidden mmr will end up right where it should be."
TrueDoTA2,39iwrc,Tonkar_,-2,Fri Jun 12 12:27:14 2015 UTC,"Yep, exactly the answer we expected.  Are we blaming teammates? When it's apparent they're to blame, like the jungling sand king that got his blink and brown boots at 20 minutes, or the PA who kept running in and getting killed in fog and then blaming it on no wards when there are wards where we need them.  I've made sure to use the word consistently in my posts because ""all my teammates suck all the time"" is not true, but it IS true to say that consistently we find ourselves at a severe handicap where no matter what we do as players, many others on our team fail to carry their weight, meanwhile the enemy team seems to have perfect synergy with eachother.  So please, enough with the ""blaming teammates ur 2.5kmmr trash"", yes teammates are a problem a lot of the time. Do we make mistakes? Yep! And then I go back and watch the replay to see how we can do better. But how can you hope to win games or have fun when the other people on your team just decide that they don't want to play the same game that everyone else is playing?  Yes, I'm asking on a strategic and theorycrafting subreddit how I can get the most out of my Dota experience by figuring out how to lower our bracket to a bracket that best suits our playstyles or skill level.   We see right through it, and we don't give a shit.   You don't speak for everyone, and that's honestly such a terrible mindset to have, that you'd automatically assume that we have some hidden agenda where we want to stomp low level players. No, we don't. We want games to be even matches where skill levels are similar between the teams, not ""the enemy team has great players and ours don't carry TPs in Very High Skill matches"".  I've already gotten some great tips on our situation, and you're not actually contributing to the conversation other than trying to bash someone who's trying to improve their enjoyment of the game.   because you can't hack it vs the ones you're matched against now.   If you have something constructive on how to consistently win 2v5, please let me know as I'd love to know. I have no idea how we can ""hack it"" against players who seem to be at a similar skill bracket on the enemy team, and then our own team has people who just aren't putting in the same effort to win games.  What else can we do besides carrying the game at a disadvantage, warding, roaming, getting kills, TPing in to defend towers, pushing when we can... when the rest of our team just aren't pulling their weight? Do we deserve to lose the majority of the time nowadays because somehow we get the negatively stacked team?

TrueDoTA2,39cg57,reivision,6,Wed Jun 10 20:50:23 2015 UTC,"Before I start BS is my experimental hero of the moment.  I'm still trying to figure out the best way to play him so you might disagree with my early findings and I might have changed opinions in a few weeks with more games.  And /u/ailodierap already has a good post so check that out.  Quick rundown on your specific questions.  1.) Jungle: Meh.  It's fine, one of the better jungling carries but jungling carries basically always are suboptimal because it makes lanes weak.  Lane farm is always better than jungle.  2.) Safelane is best.  Mid is a little sketchy because of most of the popular mids being very nuke heavy (Lina, Lesh, QOP, SF, Storm).  Makes using Bloodrage to farm risky.  3.) Max thirst first almost every game.  I go either 2-0-4-1 or 1-1-4-1 by level 7.  Also worth noting some players leave Bloodrite at level 1 and level stats.  I think I learned that one from Meracle, not certain though.  The damage scales terribly but in most cases the silence duration is worth the levels.  4.)  I think itemization is something that lots of people will disagree with me on. I start with quelling blade, PMS, Drums and SnY basically every game.  Most carries need an item to increase farm or to increase mobility.  BS doesn't need either so going mass stats makes him super strong mid game.  From there I think most games you'll need a BKB.  Super late game Skadi and Butterfly are what I usually opt for.  Abyssal is never bad.  Itemization is definitely what I've been messing around with most but I've liked the Drums SnY start way better than Blademail/Shadowblade/Euls stuff.  5.)  Zues is good for the reason ailodierap mentioned.  Used at the beginning of a teamfight buffed by bloodrage or not you suddenly get a huge MS and damage increase.  Most other synergies are obvious in big nukers from distance or heroes that do well with a hero that can't move (Pudge/Mirana/Ursa ect.).  6.)  At least numbers wise counters are mid game carries that can manfight as well as Bloodseeker and don't care too much about rupture.  Wraith King, Naix, CK, Tiny, Troll.  In practice big single target nukes and wreck you if you mess up a Blood Rage.  7.)  Blood rage tips.  Use it to help you farm.  Farming speed is what I think most people underrate about Bloodseeker.  Outside of that just keep an eye on the ""important spells"" you want to avoid.  Mostly big nukes.  Also keep in mind you can use on teammates casually to heal them while they last hit.  During teamfights it's often safer to Bloodrage who you want to target.    Either way my main point is I think BS is strong at any level right now.  People really underrate how fast he farms with just some stat items.  Here's my dotabuff with games this patch.  They're all with pretty low rated friends and I wouldn't take the item builds seriously but just note the GPMs.  None of them are radiance rush games, that's just kind of what I ended up with in some stomp games.   http://www.dotabuff.com/players/107257662/matches?date=patch_6.84c&hero=bloodseeker&skill_bracket=&lobby_type=&game_mode=&region=&faction=&duration=&enjoyment=any&timezone=America%2FNew_York."

TrueDoTA2,39cg57,egolam,16,Thu Jun 11 03:22:44 2015 UTC,"I have ~130 games as BS with ~62% winrate mostly at Very High, unranked.  So take it as you will.   I feel like I'm teaching the world how to pubstomp with my first real dota love (post 6.82 bloodseeker).  It feels dirty but I guess I'll help.    Jungle or Lane?  I prefer to play BS in the jungle.  He is a competent jungler and can jungle faster than most junglers with the exception of Enigma.  I think he can keep up with Chen / Enchantress and he actually plays similar to both heroes in the jungle.  You don't want to stay in the jungle forever.  You can easily pop out and get kills, often before 6.  Particularly if your offlane has a disable / strong slow, or if their mid over-commits for a kill.     With that said, BS is beyond a competent laner.  He's very strong as a midlaner, or safelaner, particularly solo safelane.  He can do well even against heroes that sometimes shit on melee heroes like clockwerk since he can go completely independent of mana.  Though he's still weak to the likes of Axe.  I've also played him successfully offlane.  It's a little different - you get the exp and then you have to turn the early-ish level 6 into kills either via going back to smoke gank or killing enemies in lane which isn't always possible.  You definitely don't want to do it against a really strong zoning duo like Skywrath + another ranged hero.  And definitely blocking the pull in a clever way is important to protect your exp.  Generally though, Safelane or Mid should be your go to if you're not jungling.  He is fine as a lategame carry and justifies safelane farm.   Skill Build   Skill build depends on the game.  1 in Bloodrage is generally required for your sustain.  1 in thirst is required for your damage output.    Maxing Blood Rite v. Maxing Thirst  Maxing blood rite gives you way higher killing potential if you have any sort of setup on your team, and honestly almost anything works as setup for BS.  Even a PA's stifling dagger works, along with any stun, etc.  Blood rite becomes particularly potent combined with other AoE disables like Ravage, Overgrowth, Chronosphere, Black Hole, RP, etc.  Following up a long disable with aoe damage and silence is fight winning.  It also makes it higher risk for enemies to protect their allies if it isn't a particularly good ult usage.  So for me, maxing blood rite is my preferred deal.  Also blood rite combos well with Euls if you time it right (cast it right after   However, in certain situations I max thirst.  I do this when I have teammates that are not likely to be able to setup kills and an enemy team playing really defensively early on, or when I feel like I need a little more right click damage to lane better or jungle faster.  Sometimes I do this if I'm rushing dagon for whatever reason since I'm less likely to have damage boosting cheap items like wraith band, aquilia (and sometimes I skip treads).    I think in the end it comes down to how you play him.  You can also split the difference a little and go like 1/2/2/1 at 6.  My play tends to vary game by game.   Items  Bloodseeker is ridiculously flexible in how he can be played.  He can be played as a right clicking hard carry, a roamer that looks for quick pickoffs, a teamfight / single burst hero.  And how you build him depends on how you play him.   generally  Treads - seriously, just go treads.  It's so much more damage output, and while the phase on phase boots is nice the speed is almost never needed.  You get tons of damage from thirst.  Obviously Travels are an alternative and you can maybe justify arcanes in some situations.  But treads are the standout boot for BS.  Tread switching makes your heal really fast also (switch to agi, kill a creep, switch to str).    Blademail - Not as good as it was in 6.82, but still a really solid item.  You become public enemy number 1 and you will be the target of all sorts of hate if you run into the enemies bloodraged.  Blademail punishes that hate.  Not necessary in every game, but if you're up against magic burst enemies or heroes like Huskar, it's a ridiculously potent midgame pickup.    Dagon - A very legit item on BS.  you can amp the damage significantly with bloodrage, and if you get off a double bloodrage (bloodrage both you and the target) before dagoning the enemy the damage is just massive.  Really easy to follow those up with rupture or blood rite for a kill.  I would not recommend this build if you're playing as the safelane and the team needs you to be a hard carry.   Euls - gives you absurd racecar status - way more movespeed than SnY since it's flat speed that gets multiplied by Thirst bonus.  It combos extremely well with Euls and Blood Rite.  And it counters the bane of every early rupture gank - the TP.  The one downside if you get it early is it can give enemies time to TP in to support if you go for a gank too close to their tower, so, beware.    BKB - Bloodseeker gets amped damage, so bkb is really helpful in dealing with that.  One of his weaknesses is magic burst.  This has extra value on BS, imo.  But not really always necessary.    Ultimately you can make a plethora of items work on him.  I used to go Treads ->  Blademail -> SnY -> Skadi pretty often as my ""default"" build of the hero.  But I don't so much anymore.  Lots of other items work really well.  I still like having an item that gives maim + skadi as it lets you solo roshan easily.    Butterfly or any evasion items work great on him as they significantly reduce phys damage taken while also increasing his right click damage.   Glimmer cape is ok as an intermediary before shadowblade / silver, if you're going that route (and they're pretty strong pickups).  But glimmer cape also reduces damage you take so it can be great to offest the damage amp from bloodrage.    Best Allies  Sort of talked about it above, but anyone that lets you set up good bloodrites is huge.  Zeus + BS is still a thing.  It's not quite what it was before, but it still buffs Tgod's Wrath by 20% at rank 4.  Meaning refresher Zeus is even worse with a BS on the enemy team.  And the damage output of a bloodraged Zeus in a teamfight throwing lightning bolts (bonus if he has octarine) is disgusting.  Also consider how much of a buff you get after thundergod's with thirst.  Any allies that do damage to a bunch of enemies quickly are really strong.    Other heroes that are fun with BS are Lina (stupid high damage laguna blades), Pudge (the first reaction people tend to have when ruptured is to stop, makes hooks even easier to land AND deals a shit ton of damage).   One of my favorites is BS + Void.  Chrono w/ blood rite is great synergy and bloodraging the Void also is pretty disgusting in his chrono.  He works with a lot of heroes really well though.   Best Counters  High Burst damage heroes can be a hassle, particularly before bkb and if you aren't going blademail.  Things like QoP, Zeus, etc. can really ruin your day if they catch you bloodraged with your pants down (though BS wrecks QoP if he gets the jump on her).    Heroes who have ""invulnerable"" movement skills make rupture annoyingly bad.  That's Storm Spirit, and Void mostly.  Huskar's lifebreak also makes him invulnerable but Huskar kind of sucks v. Bloodseeker.    Juggernaut is really strong against BS, he can spin and to negate attempts at blood rite + rupture ganks.   Plus, omnislash makes him invulnerable to rupture, and is burst damage that isn't returned by blademail.  IMO he's the strongest carry to pick against BS.    Phantom Lancer is also pretty good against BS.  You can doppleganger blood rite easily, it can be hard to select the real lancer for rupture, and you can generally manfight the BS pretty well even if he has a blademail since damage is distributed to your illusions and not all returned to your hero.    Enchantress can be dangerous - she is hard to hit with right clicks due to her passive (if maxed) and if you're forced to run away your movespeed can work against you if an impetus is in the air.    On Bloodrage  First thing is I would suggest don't get too fancy with bloodrage.  I almost keep it up on myself out of habit.  It increases farm speed and keeps my hp up really well.  You can try to put it on your target rather than yourself, and that's good if you have teammates also doing damage, but it's also risky as it amps their damage and if you have a lower hp teammate you can completely fuck up your gank attempt if they get a kill on a stupid ally.    Bloodrage can be used as a support ability.  e.g. you are jungling and have a safelane carry that isn't a great laner early like spectre or void.  They take some damage you go to lane, bloodrage them, and they can come heal up on the small camp or lane creeps.  Makes last hits easy and gives them more than a salve worth of hp and only costs you the time to get to lane.  Plus it's really useful after successful ganks to heal up whever was on your team in the lane.    You can use it to amp your speed even more once it's maxed.  Bloodrage self, wait for cooldown, bloodrage monster that is at full hp (and start hitting it).  This also makes ancient creeps heal for like 1k hp if you kill them when both are bloodraged.    There's a lot you can do with the skill.  But honestly it's a really good self buff and you shouldn't over-think its usage. too much.  And honestly BS really isn't a complex hero.  Just a really versatile one."
TrueDoTA2,39cg57,Drop_,9,Wed Jun 10 22:08:31 2015 UTC,"As a brief addendum to your counters section, I find AA strong against the recent surge of BS picks. AA's magic amp makes the nukes even more problematic for seeker pre-BKB, a properly timed cold feet plays him at his own game by making it risky for him to stay near the person he's ruptured, and of course if he gets dinged with ice blast he isn't going to heal off any kills."

TrueDoTA2,39cg57,oopsorry,2,Thu Jun 11 01:27:59 2015 UTC,"I've been enjoying great success with a version of Panterra's build. He's a very, very high MMR player, and I'm only 2.5k, but it's worked very well for me.  I start with QB and Stout, putting PMS into quickbuy. This leaves you with quite a bit of gold, which you can put toward PMS or a salve if your camps are exceptionally bad. In theory, no camp is impossible to chokepoint at level one as BS with good mechanics, but I mess it up too often, so if all my camps are Wildwings, Hellbears, Centaurs, or big Satyrs, I get a salve and finish the first hard camp. From there, the build is 2-0-3-1 at 6 into 2-1-4-1 at 8. Two points in Rage give the spell 100% uptime, which makes you jungle safely and extremely quickly. Gank before six if you can, otherwise gank mid or your safelane as soon as you get Rupture. If the enemy team is exceptionally mobile, I sometimes wait until my first point in Rite.  Since I don't go for a right click carry build (It's certainly viable, but I don't find it as fun or effective. :-), my first item is always Midas. Then brown boots into Euls into Travels. This doesn't give BS many stats at all, but it gives him incredible roaming and killing potential. Since I start in the jungle, I don't expect to have to carry like a traditional hard carry, I try not to frontline in teamfights, preferring to stay on the outside, disrupt with Euls, Rite, and Rupture, and dive in only for kills.  After this, the build is extremely flexible. My preferred seven slots at the moment are Ethereal-Dagon-Manta-Euls-Linkens-Travels-Moon Shard. With those items, BS gets decent stats and incredible utility. It's really hard to bring down a hero with 200 right click damage, huge magic burst, 700 MS, Linkens, Manta, Euls, an AOE silence, and Rupture. Many other item builds can work on the hero, but I feel he is underwhelming as a traditional melee carry after the Blademail fix, as his damage output depends on reducing his EHP. Before the fix, BM was super broken and I think he was better as a pure position 1 right clicking frontliner.  Anyway, I've found that I love this hero a lot, and he's super effective for climing MMR in the 2k bracket for me. Here is a pretty much ideal game I played yesterday, if you want to take a look at a replay of my playstyle."
TrueDoTA2,39cg57,jaccarmac,2,Thu Jun 11 17:18:11 2015 UTC,"Bloodrage +midas heals you.  Rupture is really good against fragile yet mobile heroes: antimage, quop.  Jungle tips: learn to make chokepoints with quelling blade.  Buy 2x slippers on the courier and wait for mid to get bottle.  Items: I always go treads PMS Aquila.  Then usually either drums or sny.  Then BKB or dagons.    The choice to dagons... Basically if their supports are poor and can't afford HP.  Dagon 5 + bloodrage is incredibly scary in this situation, you can quickly create a 5v4.  Otherwise, safer to focus on your right clicks... Basically buy abyssal.  Don't go mid unless you're confident in the matchup.  Popular mids can make your life very hard."

TrueDoTA2,39cg57,UNBR34K4BL3,1 point,Thu Jun 11 20:38:19 2015 UTC,"BS is a very versatile hero, which is a large part of why he thrives in the current meta. It's hard to county him via draft, and he has a large utility of abilities- he drafts great with nukers (due to synergy from both Thirst and Bloodrage), can rarely be outpaced, is semi-tanky, offers AOE and silence, and completely trashes heroes who rely on mobility.   Jungle is great, but you need to employ chokepoint jungling early on, unless your safe lane doesn't mind you killing their small camp or you get lucky spawns. Quelling Blade, Stout Shield and 1 Slipper of Agility. Build a Poor Man Shield ASAP, then your choice of boots (I prefer Phase, lots of strong arguments for Treads though). Any, but the draft is going to decide if a solo BS can get away on offlane. He can carry, he can mid, its all good. It's preference based on your playstyle, I generally like to max Blood Rite first, and evenly level the other 2 skills. Sometimes I evenly level them all if AOE or Silence isn't as useful in the game. I generally like a Eul's/Blademail rush, but there's a lot to be said for an early Dagon, or going pure DPS and getting a Basher. Mjollnir can really add a lot to your teamfight as well. You might be picking up a theme here, but its all pretty situational based on game state. My one caveat is I don't like lifesteal on him, I think his Q should cover that adequately and a pickup of a Satanic would be a waste. Zeus + BS is a thing still, but not in the way you think. Not because BS powers up Zeus to ult, but because Zeus's ult immediately gives a large burst of Thirst benefits to Bloodseeker. Nukers should throw them more readily in teamfights with Bloodseeker on their side, as it will immediately improve his DPS abilities. I also like him with ganking supports, such as BH or Spirit Breaker. Blood Rage: I might be underutilizing this ability, but I don't see much nuance to it. If someone can initiate safely with a damage ability, drop it on them. If an enemy is getting ganged up and doesn't have the ability to get a kill of (i.e. a Storm without mana), drop it on them. Otherwise just apply as needed as you drop your nukes or farm. I feel like there aren't any hard and fast rules to follow for it, but usually the situation and your playstyle up to that point make it pretty clear what the right decision is."
TrueDoTA2,39cg57,Ailodierap,1 point,Wed Jun 10 21:37:26 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna say this first, I haven't played him this patch. And that's because I jungled him, and junglers in general get noticeably less farm than the last patch. I even practiced in lobbies with my pub junglers like enigma and it's and its straight up forcing you to be greedy with your starting items and forgo flying and supporting for a long time.   Having said that: for any lane, max thirst by 7. One of blood seeker's strengths is to find a lone hero and trade with them. Whether they have nukes or not, the thirst damage when both of you are low will let you full heal from killing them and they can't run because of thirst speed. The faster you get there, the better.   Blood rage only scales the damage and cool down, not the heal, so if you're leaning leave it at two points to have the option to have it on 100% of the time.   Max blood rite whenever you want. The damage isn't as good as the silence scaling so if you need silence, get more of it.   Blood seeker is just a lot of good mechanics needed at some level. Be good at getting boots+tp to help your allies and build appropriate items. If your team needs a right clicker, maelstrom yasha isn't bad as a default. BKB is needed in a lot of games. Dagon is unreliable, but honestly an option.   I personally found many games to be lacking chase, soft initiation, and lockdown. And I built Atos in a large amount of my games. It solves your mana issues largely and gives you HP. It sets up your bloodrite and let's you snowball really hard. Blood seeker doesn't need damage items early. If he's up against man fighters like ursa, leshrac, or naix, blade mail those heroes.   Euls is for games versus QOP and etc where Atos doesn't secure bloodrite. But blood seeker owns those heroes with rupture and his vision anyways.   Blood seeker is not survivable. He only seems scary. He has good armor and average HP, but he has bloodrage on him most fights.   Some ganks it lets blood seeker be more survivable and focus fire someone better if you bloodrage the enemy. Especially early in the jungle. But if you do this, think of it like a maledict/medallion that buffs your enemy too. If you bloodrage someone with AOE they'll heal when they kill creeps and heroes around you. I have learned this by blood raging kunkkas, axes, and ember spirits.   Also, phase boots are really useful and usually should be your default. They let you chase through creep waves where treads would own you with pathing. Treads are the HP boost you need sometimes though."

TrueDoTA2,39cg57,maddotard,1 point,Thu Jun 11 00:37:00 2015 UTC,"Use your silence to cut people off.  It will force them to run, be silenced and damaged, or stay and fight you.  Usually they pick the latter.  Don't pick BS into a bunch of crazy strength heros like CK, Pudge, or Sven.  Try to have high damage heroes on your team like Zeus and Magnus so that you get your thirst bonus.  Try to spread your levels of blood rage out over the course of the game. Instead of leveling bloodrage, consider getting stats, as although bloodrage will increase your damage output, it also increases damage taken, so you are really easy to pop if they have a nuker.   I usually max thirst first with one point in blood rage and my silence becaues the silence and healing are nice, but in my opinion, thirst is probably his best ability.  Don't buy force staff; it's really gimmicky.  But uh yeah.  If you cooperate with your team you'll take over the game and be knocking over rax by 25 minutes."

TrueDoTA2,39cg57,h0ist,1 point,Thu Jun 11 16:32:53 2015 UTC,"I have been rolling people in very high skill non ranked games with jungler BS.  You go treads,  Aquila, right into silver edge. Then BKB. By then you can't really die. I have been getting desolator as my last item because damage = health for BS.   I don't like blade mail anymore because it does add the 40% on the return damage. You are better server with any other item that returns damage.   I basically gank the map with the silver edge by going 4 1 4 2. You case bloodrage on yourself and go invisible. It makes your opener do almost 500 damage to most  heroes. Also starts you out next to them and you still haven't even cast rupture. I also like invis because mid game it applies pressure and late game most heroes Dont have space for dust or gem on carries. I use it to get away.   After ganks go back to jungling but put your treads on intelligence. You will regen at 3 mps. That is enough to be able to gank again after clearing the jungle on round."

Always get your first point in Q to heal from killing/denying creeps. Those are my only real ""tips.""  I personally prefer to offlane since you need extremely serious harass to be slowed down. But he's flexible in that regard. I also prefer Thirst first to Rite (except for 1 point for the way it makes enemies play around it), but either way can work."
TrueDoTA2,39cg57,Spuuky,1 point,Thu Jun 11 23:48:32 2015 UTC,"go to jungle but you're not meant to afkfarm, keep being close to lanes and jump in when your allies decide to go for an engage.  Once you're 6 jungling it over for good, look for opportunities around the map. I suggest power treads into sange-yasha with bkb to follow up. Some people like blademail but honestly it's very situational. Mjollnir is pretty good, especially against lancer etc. Butterlfy is sick when you already have bkb and opponents aren't close to building mkb"
TrueDoTA2,39cg57,Mlcrosoft1,1 point,Fri Jun 12 17:25:07 2015 UTC,"Jungle yea or nay?   Viable, he's a very fast jungler who can't be screwed by bad spawns and stays full health after lvl2~3. Problem is he can still be messed up by Bounty Hunters and other heroes roaming your jungle and he loses the opportunity to dominate an opponent laner, so I'd rather avoid jungling if laning is an option.  Build is Stout + Quelling Blade into PMS into whatever, you don't really need the tangoes but it might be necessary depending on which camps are blocked and the spawns   If not jungle, which lane? Safelane? Mid? ...Offlane...?   Any lane as long as you can farm. He works wonder as an offlaner against weak dual lanes or even against trilanes if you have a strong hero to help you, but i'd still rather go safelane (you can solo from lvl1 and win pretty much any 1v1). Mid is a little bit harder until you get the hang of it, Lina/QoP matchups can get pretty hard if you start missing lasthits, you NEED to hit most lasthits and denies if you wanna survive that.   Skill build?    NEVER do anything except for maxing Thirst first. Really, it's just the best passive in the entire game, sometimes you just run down people at lvl3 because someone on the other side of the map lost a little bit of HP. The most popular build is Q>E>E>Q>E>R>E>W, having 100% uptime on bloodrage is pretty good so you wanna grab that second point but getting blood rite at 3 or 4 might be decent if you're absolutely sure it'll be important.   Itemization?   Really depends on the game and preference. He's one of those heroes who can be built in a lot of ways, from the Dagon build to the manfighter build with Blademail to builds with Euls. You mix it up depending on the game, I usually decide between Euls and Blademail and then build survivability with a Mjollnir thrown in. Boots are also up to you, i usually get Travels (you're fine with only having Brown Boots until later) if i don't need Phase/PT to fight the opposing laner.   Synergies?   Forget about abusing Rupture with things such as Skewer or Lasso, it's Thirst you gotta think about. Bloodseeker is great with anyone who can deal a lot of damage to a lot of people at once, so Gyrocopter, Zeus (it's like the best thing ever, just Zeus ulti + bloodrage got a little bit nerfed), QoP, Undying, Earth Spirit, Spectre and Leshrac are all excelent with him, any of those heroes hitting people for 10% of their health is enough for you to go full Sonic. Only problem he could have when it comes to synergy is if lanes end being farm oriented and no one on the opponent side loses HP, like all above 90% all the time.   Counters?   Really can't think of any. Juggernaut with his healing ward can be a bitch in teamfights fucking over your Thrist, plus he doesn't really care about Blademail (he does care about Euls tho) and can manfight you. Wraith King is also decent for obvious reasons regarding his ultimate and he isn't afraid of fighting you. Storm doesn't care about Rupture a whole lot and can instanly disable you but can't really fight you and absolutely MUST avoid blood rite. Disables overall are good like against any hero but Beastmaster takes the cake because BKB is usually core on BS and that stupid pig reduces your power by a lot.   And finally, Blood Rage tips specifically?    Well it depends. Is your Windranger safely hitting a tower with focus fire? Bloodrage her. Is your BKB + Satanic + Divine Gyrocopter going ham without 5 people focusing him? Bloodrage him. Is your SF low and going to Raze a wave? Bloodrage him. The same goes for you, if you think the damage amp on yourself is worth dealing increased damage then use it, but if you're with your team focusing a hero down then it's usually better to Bloodrage the target so everyone deals more damage.  Also remember to Bloodrage Roshan when doing it with your team."

TrueDoTA2,39ah4m,Redrum01,12,Wed Jun 10 12:35:03 2015 UTC,"Congratulations!  You have caught the Kunkka bug.  I made a post about a week ago about this hero and got some good discussions on the swarthy fellow.  The general consensus is this:  He is terribly average.  He does a lot of things but does none of them supremely well.  If you want to build him as a carry, why not just go Ember?  If you want a long range initiator, why not just get Wyvern?  His ganking power is low since he is hungry for levels to do anything.  All of his skills are great but the big question is which one is more valuable?  I've been spamming the hero for the past week to really get a feel for his limits.  I didn't want to agree with the rest of the community and tried hard to find his place in the meta.  I'm still looking.  I think the beauty of playing Kunkka is that he is so versatile.  If you want to play him as a carry, you can.  If you want to play him as a support, you can.  It's addicting to play him because you feel like you can do anything with this guy.  I think what you're asking is ""what is the most reliable way to play him.  In my personal experience, I'm finding more success playing him as a semi-carry/ganker.  I will get an early point in Tidebringer for some lane presence, then get 1 point in Torrent and 3 points in X-mark.  By level 6 I can do my full combo.  At this point you can make a decision:  Do I need to initiate from even further away?  Max out X-mark.  Do I need to get more burst?  Max out Torrent.  To answer your question about how the combo is done, this is what I do (X mark lvl 3 required):  X-mark the hero -> Cast your boat on the same X -> Cast Torrent on the same X -> Count to 1 -> Return X -> Success!  This is the easiest way to do your full combo.  After 1 second, the X will return the target right on time to get hit by the torrent.  The stun + slow from the torrent will guarantee a hit from the boat.  At lvl 3 X, this will get them right at the outer radius of the boat.  At lvl 4 X, this will hit them dead center.  As far as item build, I've tried it all as well and nothing has been 100% reliable.  The latest build I'm experimenting with is a ""Cleric"" type build where I focus on keeping my allies alive.    1) This means a Bottle for early sustain.  The X-self + TP combo works wonders for keeping a push going.    2) After that I will go Drums and then Arcanes (to later build into a Greaves).    After this it's all situational.    3) AC + Crimson or Vlad are good for the armor.    4) Greaves are ridiculously good.    5) Pipe is nice but your Rum debuff helps in taking the edge off of magic burst teams.    With these items and Coco's Rum, your team is nigh impossible to kill.  Why even bother with that if you can get the same thing with Omniknight?  That's because Omniknight can't gank from 1000 range like Kunkka can.  With this playstyle you will have to depend on your teammates to land the finishing blow from your combo.  You will not be a one-hit wonder.  You will not team-wipe a team with a lucky crit.  Your job is buff your allies and use your skills wisely to keep them alive or get a pickoff quickly.  You will be a playmaker but not the play finisher.  If you're playing Kunkka though... it's totally worth it."
TrueDoTA2,39ah4m,back2bassics,2,Wed Jun 10 14:40:42 2015 UTC,I go 4 in torrent 4 in tide bringer and 1 in x for back to base bottle refill. Learn to fake your torrent casts and cast from fog to land torrents. No need to have x at 3 until later if you practice.
TrueDoTA2,39ah4m,ZachForTheWin,2,Wed Jun 10 13:07:06 2015 UTC,"Maxing torrent means that at lv7 you have a lot of burst damage with torrent+boat. I would say in an easy lane max torrent, in a more difficult lane put points in tidebringer to take last hits/deny (I hope you know that tidebringer damage works with denies, but doesn't put it on cooldown or cleave). You don't need more than 2 points in x most of the time.  The battlefury - blink - stack crits build is really good if you can get the items quickly because you can x yourself to blink in and tidebringer safely for lots of damage. This is a more farm oriented build that leads to tons of late game damage. Blink is just amazing for Kunkka because of the synergy with x, and also allows you to catch out people from 2000 units away (blink and x into torrent boat).  You should try armlet. I was trying out armlet as a replacement for the battlefury build or as a initial item before battlefury. Toggle it on, tidebringer, toggle off. It's cheap, easy to build, and makes you tanky. With boat buff and armlet you're pretty much immortal. I buy it if I know I won't be able to farm a battlefury fast enough, and need to fight immediately.   Kunkka's x + torrent combo is pretty easy to pull off. Just x, wait a bit over a second, and then torrent. Torrent delay is 1.6 seconds and radius is 225 so if you x after just a bit over a second most heroes can't walk out of it. X lasts 4 seconds so you have about 2 seconds where you can walk back to boat after torrent.  Teammates will be teammates lol"
TrueDoTA2,39ah4m,OrientalGentleman,2,Wed Jun 10 14:29:14 2015 UTC,"One thing I always feel is overlooked about Kunkka is the X-marks + Teleport abuse. It's such an underrated mechanic, and it functions for either support OR core Kunkka. Mid Kunkka can afford to rush Boots of Travel for free bottle refills every 45s in lane, while support Kunkka can focus on synergies with heroes like IO or Skywrath. It's just as abusable, IMO, as the other notorious Kunkka combo support, Shadow Demon."

Not to mention boat is so fucking good in teamfights, as not only is it a big nuke/stun but the rum buff is really strong.  If you want to practice in bot games, don't bother trying to land naked torrents, practice x'ing someone and then torrenting them, or x'ing and then ulting them. Knowing when to send them back so they get the dmg/stun is the most important part of playing a good kunkka"
TrueDoTA2,39ah4m,L0rdenglish,1 point,Wed Jun 10 14:59:08 2015 UTC,"283 games, 61% wr, I am 4.2k  I'll be assuming you mean core (and likely mid) kunkka and not support.  1.  Max tidebringer first, then torrent, then x marks. You can choose to get an early level in x marks for a free fountain trip (x yourself, tp base & heal, come back full hp/mana) but I don't always do this.    2. Depends on the game. You can go for the glass cannon blink & crit/divine sort of build which !Attacker is fond of. Some people say battlefury is good on kunkka but I disagree. Honestly I feel like !Attacker does well with his build because... Well, it's his build. Plus he's a great kunkka player and a highly skilled player in general, no surprise it works for him. It's a farming item and if you're afk farming kunkka then you're doing it wrong. His ult isn't a low CD for no reason.  If you look at my recent game you can see I went for drums, silver edge, crit and then divine. I don't always get full drums but the enemy team was doing a lot of fighting early and I felt like I needed the investment.  Honestly when you're wondering what to buy just look at the enemy team. Decide based off their heroes what items you buy. For example I never buy BKB unless the enemy team is such that my hand is forced.    3.  Practice. Once you have 3 levels in x marks you can 100% hit your x-torrent-boat combo if you don't fuck up your x timing. As far as hitting torrent/boat combo without your x marks? Lots more practice.    4.  Just suck it up, pubs flame. This is dota. If you don't feel like being the primary initiator then just say so in chat and ask who you think should be to go and initiate. However, if your team is lacking then you have to fill that role. Don't try to go for the 5 man boat, single out one important hero (a powerful support without bkb, e.g. witch doctor) and remove them from the fight.  If you have any questions feel free to ask."
TrueDoTA2,39ah4m,BuffKunkka,1 point,Wed Jun 10 16:12:43 2015 UTC,Go offlane (with tide) torrent and tidebringer first. Urn>tranqs>crys>euls>daed. After you get your first two items start game lanes with allies in them. Works decently up to 3.5k mmr
TrueDoTA2,39ah4m,Redd-9,1 point,Wed Jun 10 17:35:02 2015 UTC,Sorry to hijack your thread! But what is your skill build for support kunkka? 2 torrents 1 tidebringer 2 marks X? And how much level of marks X is enough?
TrueDoTA2,39ah4m,Ah-Bin,2,Thu Jun 11 05:53:22 2015 UTC,"Typical skillbuild for Support Kunkka ignores Tidebringer.  You will max out either X-marks or Torrent first.  What you max out depends on what you need.  If you have good setup in your lane like a Shadow Demon or a Bane, you can max out Torrent to maximize damage and slow.  If you don't have a good setup, I would go for a 2-0-3-1 build by level 6.  This will ensure you can pull off your entire combo by 6.  For a lot of people, 3 levels in X-marks is enough.  I prefer max level because that lets me cast my X from 1000 units away.  That's very good for either chasing or initiating from a relatively ""safe"" distance."

Seriously, though, you want to pick Witch Doctor when you know fights are going to be in close quarters or with multiple enemy heroes attacking one or two of your team. This can apply to your team combination and the enemy's team. He's a great counter to Io and any of its partners since they make a good set of cask targets. He also counters heroes that require/benefit from illusions so CK, Naga, PL, TB, etc. all make great cask targets. He also works really well when you have heroes on your team that can pull the team into an enclosed area. Enigma, Dark Seer, etc."
TrueDoTA2,39a4be,Whilyam,1 point,Wed Jun 10 14:14:41 2015 UTC,"I'd like to make a counter argument against the ""he's good against illu heroes"" statement. Sure, them having illusions works when there's only a couple of them, like against early game CK, TB, because you can ensure it'll bounce at least once to them, locking them down for a maledict+death ward combo. After a while though, the illusions start multiplying like crazy, like after CK, Naga, and TB get their mantas. PL, you're never going to beat without aghanims, and that's only if you're sure which is the main PL, so you can cask him first, and target him with death ward.  Other stuff like LD, though, who basically only works with himself and the bear, gets raped due to the stunlock. You also don't want to pick him specifically for close quarters, as you WILL get focused down once you start looking at it go. He works best at medium range, as Death Ward's cast range is actually pretty big, and you can pick a target with it to maximize bounces."
TrueDoTA2,39a4be,PeenoyDoto,3,Wed Jun 10 14:47:24 2015 UTC,The illusions count as creeps and get stunned for 5 secs per bounce though. Can slow down illusion damage which helps against some of them more than others.

I think he is about as good a first safe pick as it gets in this game, even if you know nothing about yours or the enemy team."
TrueDoTA2,39a4be,fourthirds,2,Wed Jun 10 19:57:02 2015 UTC,"I'm late to this thread so hopefully someone will see this. Witch Doctor is typically a good pick. To start:   He's a pretty strong lane support - it's hard to trade with him because of his high base damage, decent move speed, and voodoo restoration/maledict.  Cask is a semi-reliable stun. The projectile speed and random bounces make it less reliable than an instant stun. He can also farm the jungle with it. This and his laning presence makes him versatile He's great in teamfights if the enemy team doesn't stop him.   I think WD is a good pick in most games, and great in others. He's not a great initiator because of his semi-reliable stun. It's just not as effective as other spells at initiating. He's great as a follow up to initiation though, and counter initiation can work as well. Heroes like Magnus, Void, Enigma, Dark Seer that want to initiate and have follow up work great with him. Additionally teams with few disables can be destroyed by him.  I have problems with him against Silencer. Typically you want to hang back and get a good cask + ult in for teamfights and Silencer can just ruin that. Skywrath is a tough one, either dropping Mystic Flare on your head when you ult or silencing you (or both). Typically heroes with disable and/or the ability to kill you quickly (Slark, PA, Drow) will make your life more difficult.  While Rubick is great against most heroes with a channeling ult, WD can toggle his heal after ulting (mid-channel, it won't break) and Rubick will steal the heal. Lift is still good at stopping you though."
TrueDoTA2,39a4be,mdk132,3,Thu Jun 11 03:29:31 2015 UTC,Silencer vs. WD always seems to turn into which one can afford to be patient with their ult.
TrueDoTA2,39a4be,Nailbomb85,1 point,Thu Jun 11 07:14:08 2015 UTC,Silencer just makes it difficult in my experience. If they get a good initiation he can silence to stop counter initiation or silence right after your team's initiation to stop your follow up. Have to catch him in your initiation to do anything.
TrueDoTA2,39a4be,mdk132,2,Thu Jun 11 11:40:17 2015 UTC,"He's incredibly strong against teams that like to hunt together or situations where 2 enemies are frequently together, e.g. against Io or LD picks he is really really strong.  but those 2 heroes are pretty weak already.   His ult works really well with anyone that can lock down enemies too.  So magnus, tide, and treant seem to work well with WD.   It can be hillarious if you have a CM on your team.  The mana aura can mean you're like a walking fountain in the early and midgame if you level restoration."

TrueDoTA2,399zqw,PurePhaze,8,Wed Jun 10 09:16:29 2015 UTC,"I'm going to disagree with most of the comments here so far. Draft depending, but Storm can certainly make a great sidelane carry. I've even seen him run in tri-lanes in both the competitive scene and in high (6k+) MMR games. Generally you see a Storm run this way rush a Soul Ring, and proceed to spam out the lane (or leave it to his supports) and then transition into Jungle to make stacks and spam his Q. Running Storm in this manner does handicap his exp (although the jungle transition helps to ease that), but it has the potential to guarantee you more farm then you might secure in mid, and dodge dangerous match-ups or roaming ganks from the alternate lane. I am also a big fan of cores who can leave lane for the supports to get some catch-up farm as well.  You might choose to run a Storm this way if a rushed Orchid or Scythe would be key to securing victory or a lot of space for your team, while the timing of him hitting 6 doesn't matter as much (perhaps because the opponents have some sort of defense against mobility, but not silences or hexes). Alternatively I've seen Blitz do this to rush a Bloodstone and completely snowball his way to victory, but you need to be secure in your ability to outplay the opponents if doing that."
TrueDoTA2,399zqw,Ailodierap,3,Wed Jun 10 14:23:02 2015 UTC,"This guy hits the nail on the head, but to put a finer point on it to address some of the other comments here:   You don't put a hero - any hero - in the safelane with supports in order to get levels. You do it to get farm. Storm getting level 6 freaky fast is irrelevant if there are a bunch of heroes on the other team with long silences/chain disables - the likes of Lion/Skywrath/Silencer - who make ganking tough and dangerous.   If disabling the enemy with an Orchid or Hex would allow you to gank better, then your priority becomes gaining gold, not gaining XP. Gaining gold can be hard in the mid lane against strong laners like QOP, Viper, SF, etc.  The XP will come. If storm NEEDs the orchid and is going to have a hotly contested mid, then running him safe is usually going to be the better choice."
TrueDoTA2,399zqw,ValentineSmith,2,Thu Jun 11 22:55:58 2015 UTC,"The thing with storm is that you want to hit 6 asap - at that point, the entire concept of hero, the flow changes and it becomes a scary beast.  In order to do so, you need solo XP - which is usually decreased when playing along with 2 supports."
TrueDoTA2,399zqw,vraGG_,1 point,Wed Jun 10 09:19:41 2015 UTC,"While in the mid lane I agree with you when I play him safe lane instead of prioritizing getting 6, I prioritize getting Treads + Soulring + Bottle to flash farm the jungle and get Bloodstone asap. Not sure how viable it is in higher mmr but I feel that playing him safelane instead of mid relieves a ton of pressure on the storm player to gank early."
TrueDoTA2,399zqw,vraGG_,1 point,Wed Jun 10 09:34:29 2015 UTC,"There is no ""need"" for storm to gank. Of course, you do so if you get a favourable rune - since it creates space and is equally beneficial to farming. If you do not have the chance to gank, it's perfectly fine to continue pressuring mid.  After all, farm there should be equal to farm on any lane, except you get more XP since no supports are near. Sure, you are more vulnerable to ganks, but you are storm, and there isn't so many scenarios (especially after lv6) where you can be taken down easily if played properly. Not to mention that a failed gank has a high cost on enemy supports that wasted their time and resources to rotate."
TrueDoTA2,399zqw,Drop_,2,Wed Jun 10 10:48:29 2015 UTC,Mid lane is often much more contested for farm than safelane.
TrueDoTA2,399zqw,cloudy100,-1,Wed Jun 10 17:23:57 2015 UTC,"actually, the real reason is storm's a piece of shit in early game. He can't really fight, have no escape. So he needs every bit of advantage. Going safelane means giving further advantage. If u're winning 1v2 or even 1v3, you've already won before the game started because you're facing terrible opponents."
TrueDoTA2,399zqw,pepe_le_shoe,-2,Wed Jun 10 09:53:39 2015 UTC,"I think he does better offlane than safelane.   You have easier access to a rune for bottle, and you can still get the xp you need.   Use remnant to last hit, and use the charge you get to harass.   Once you have level 6, go look for a gank opportunity, preferably on mid."

Usually you'll counter pick for different reasons, Shadow Demon is good, Darkseer is decent as he's quite tanky and can zone her out. Nyx is also really good against her I've found.   If you want to counter her in a fight then BKB if you're a hard right click carry, then build into a basher or mkb. If you're playing support you can build a ghost sceptre, it shuts her ulti down hard lategame just make sure you time it correctly. If you're playing a core that doesn't transition into late game too well you should probably build a blademail.   There are tons of heroes who do well against right click as well as items that you can pick up. Playing support and can't seem to survive even long enough to pop that stun? Build up a solar crest. Such an amazing item. Invisibility is incredibly good against Windrunner as she can't lock you down so consider a glimmer cape."

Combine that with any support with a disable and she's even easier to deal with.  I'm a Lion player so I'd obviously recommend him if you see a WR. He can get 7+ seconds of single target lockdown, and has a big ass nuke that she can't evade. He's my favorite support by far in all situations, but works extremely well against WR as well"
TrueDoTA2,397j8a,Phritz777,8,Tue Jun 9 22:11:21 2015 UTC,"You already have a lot of good ideas, but a lot of them are focused towards late game transition, which isn't wrong.  But you have to feel out how strong lyralei is at different points in the game. Late game with those items, sure she's scary. And mid game, getting blink shackled is amazing. It's one of the reasons I've been playing her as a blink dagger support lately.   But assume she's mid or safe lane levels of farm, maybe she's solo off lane with free farm.   Let's assume she's playing slashers way with blink dagger somewhere between rushing it and aghanims.   She is overly reliant on bottle as regen. Control runes. Maybe go as far as sniping her courier. Play furion if you notice bottle crow.   Wind runner won't get bkb early. Use this to your advantage as heroes like Zeus and Bounty have tons of nuke damage she can't handle when both heroes have their nuke maxed.   Speaking of bounty, wind runner builds no armor items. I'm a fan of tranquils on WR. But let's assume phase boots. She can't handle a surprise burst of physical damage. A few seconds of clinkz strafe will catch her off guard and things like NYX will own her.   Back to bottle weaknesses,  players are over reliant on it. Wind runner is a hero that has no cool down on fighting. She doesn't need focus fire to help team fights. But she only has bottle for mama regen, which is roughly 240 mana, that's about two spells. Mana burn her and she's screwed.   Diffusal blade owns her. It mana burns. I want to say it doesn't purge off windrun or focus fire though. But you can take shackles off allies... Unless you're shackled to that hero.  Minus armor carries like SF and slardar fare well against her late game. They aren't super item independent and but BKBs and mKBs and wind runners don't buy shivas or assault often enough.   Mid game, when she has blinks aghs, she is vulnerable to blade mail slightly and does enjoy magic damage flying around like fotm Lina, qop, leshrac, or a patch ago, Zeus, who still works."
TrueDoTA2,397j8a,wildtarget13,6,Tue Jun 9 21:44:40 2015 UTC,"I've been on both sides of this matter so I'll share my thoughts.  The problem playing as WR core is that you have 15 sec between each focus fire so you may wanna play triple core on that.  Clockwerk shits on her till bkb with blademail, but since WR isn't really dangerous before Aghs + 1 dmg item BKB shouldn't come so fast unless you force her to get it and then her farm will be slow cuz bkb isn't what you can call cost effective as far as farming is concerned.   So that's one way to deal with her : agress early, she's a bad comeback hero. Other heroes who work well in this scenario : Centaur, Beastmaster, Slark, Lion, Spirit Breaker (although you'll need to rely on allies for this one)  Then you can choose to go lategame and then you'll have to wait till she activates focus fire and then go hard on her while trying to save the focus fired ally.   You seem to already have a grasp at dealing wiht her lategame so I'll keep this short :   she's very fragile and dies fast.   try not to fight in jukepaths  MKB is indeed pretty good but not always necessary, unless of course when your hero only deals physical.  magic dmg is her fear (Lion, Lina, Qop, Lesh), now there's glimmer cape but I didn't play her in this patch so careful with this advice it may be no longer true.  PA can wreck her hard lategame, my go to choice would be CK as carry since he's very good against her having CB and RR to help against windrun + she has a hard time against illusions + you can OS almost any hero as CK when you use ult once you have a bit of farm."
TrueDoTA2,397j8a,Ken1drick,1 point,Tue Jun 9 22:52:45 2015 UTC,"Lotta stuff here. I skimmed.   But with Clock vs WR, forcing her to get a BkB isn't the problem. A correctly played WR probably will get force staff first instead of blink and own clock. Force does about half the things blink does, but also gives regen to WR, something she doesn't usually have.   Also, I like the point about CK. Windrunner maelstrom is Garbage weak and forcing her to get it versus illusions is amazing.   I've been failing at re-explaining why maelstrom is weak on WR, but I got it now. You can't proc maelstrom while the first one is in the air. This is 3/4ths of a second meaning you are severely limiting focus fires transition potential. Unless you are versus high armor tanky targets like Naga, slardar, or dragon knight, this will not be helpful to you more than straight damage items with little attack speed."
TrueDoTA2,397j8a,wildtarget13,4,Tue Jun 9 23:14:39 2015 UTC,You can't proc maelstrom while the first one is in the air.   That was fixed in 6.81:   6.81  Fixed Chain Lightning not functioning properly when it procs while a previous proc is still bouncing   Maelstrom is amazing on WR.
TrueDoTA2,397j8a,alexbarrett,1 point,Wed Jun 10 11:11:16 2015 UTC,"Agreed, Maelstrom brings an instant value to her ult that you don't get from just about anything else. It's a trade-off/investment like any other item, but it opens up item progressions that are totally viable."
TrueDoTA2,397j8a,Harlequeens,2,Wed Jun 10 23:58:48 2015 UTC,"Force does work well against clock but I really don't like picking it up opposed to blink on core WR for mobility.  Now, against clock you're right if no one else is gonna have force you'll probably get that but then that's more delay for dmg aswell.  Meanwhile clock works on his blademail and has it by the time you start getting frightening so you don't really own him once you have force you just survive if he's alone or his team isn't able to catchup. He could also be catching you while you windrun out of a situation.   I've had hard times against some clocks but it's true when his lane goes bad and you go ok/well you do own him as WR, but in clock's defense I think it's a hero that performsl according to how well he's played, you can always get something out of the lane if you play good by using power cogs on creeps & sniping lasthits/pulls with the rocket :)"
TrueDoTA2,397j8a,Ken1drick,3,Tue Jun 9 23:31:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I thought about it after I typed it up. Wind doesn't have the damage to kill clock with similar farm or even if clock is behind.   If she forces out, she still can't fight him, with or without blade mail. Also I'm a pretty good clock player of I'm allowed to say. I'd probably own a Windrunner all game.   Clock also can but blink> aghs if people start using leaps and force staves. Also, if you max cogs instead of rocket, you can hook shot into cog mana drain (200 mana drain)."

Slahser's way WR is going all-in on her ult—that's her main teamfight contribution, so if you can take that away from her it will drastically reduce her impact. Winter Wyvern, for example, is one of my least favorite supports to play against; in terms of cores, competent Earth Spirits and Pucks are super-annoying. As for not picking the ""wrong"" heroes against her, some melee cores like WK and PL can become a big problem in the late game if their teams prevent me from shutting them down early on (more on this in a moment), but for the most part melee cores are my favorite prey as WR, and people love them—for example, you might be able to bully a lot of heroes as Ursa, but if there's a WR in the game you'll have to play around her in fights unless you are well ahead. Early magic burst and hard disables are great against her. QoP, for example, has a strong enough mid lane presence to ensure WR doesn't have an easy lane, can slow her with dagger, is more mobile than WR, and can blow her up even if WR picks up an early BKB to break Orchid's silence. Lion on the other hand is a support that's good against her, too, because even if she gets a good shackles off she won't be able to capitalize on it if she's a chicken. Counterpicking her isn't as important as itemizing against her. If you're someone like Weaver who can feasibly get MKB/BKB/Linken's as your first one or two items don't waste valuable time farming a Deso first. If you're the support a simple Force Staff or Glimmer Cape can go a long way towards saving her FF target. Edit: forgot to mention Ghost Scepter is good if you are a support or position 3 that just really needs to survive against her, and Blademail is also a pretty good ""don't hit me"" item until she gets BKB. If I'm WR, I'm going to focus on reaching critical mass by the mid game, which typically means lots of early activity around the map. WR's kit is geared much more towards fighting (especially pick-offs and skirmishes than full-on fights) than it is passively farming. Beware banking too much into the late game if you don't have a lineup that can weather the storm; people love fighting early this patch."
TrueDoTA2,397j8a,Harlequeens,2,Tue Jun 9 23:39:53 2015 UTC,"Core windrunner is a complete bitch to deal with late game, rush aghs and you can 100-0 towers easily, rush blink and you can 100-0 heroes easily, late game when she has deso/mkb/bkb/manta/skadi or whatever you want to build on her she can almost always get a core down before windrun and bkb wear off unless you have multiple cores with abyssal or bkb-piercing stuns, and honestly focusing down a windrunner with one of your big stuns leaves you so open for her team to jump you.  her downsides are that she farms reasonably slow if she gets shut down in lane, is very mana reliant (shackle + windrun + ulti + power shot is most if not all of her mana pool at early levels) she has bad regen and stats and normally relies on windrun as her escape early game, so putting nukers like Zeus or qop mid against her can really stop her coming online fast, slows are also very good against her, PA's dagger for example will normally keep a windrunner in range until windrun wears off so you can kill her, and if you have decent positioning, shackle is only a ministun really.  basically, don't let her initiate late game, slow down her farm with ganks, and try to pick at least one bkb piercing stun (Pudge or Bane are very good against her at the worst of times due to high pure damage and solid disables.) she's somewhat harder to deal with than most cores later in the game, but overall isn't as big of a threat once her ulti is off CD, since she almost never builds attack speed."
TrueDoTA2,397j8a,Avvulous,2,Tue Jun 9 23:43:26 2015 UTC,"Blink + Agh's + BKB    That's 10k gold and all you need to survive it is 1.5k gold item.  If you allow for any hero to farm that much early on, its not the hero which is the problem, but your plays. Even a pudge with those items can kill anyone he wants, and some cores who excell in early domination, like huskar - give him 10k gold to get proper items and game ends before the 20 min mark no matter what you do.  Good heroes to deal with her at any point of game: clock, storm,cent, disruptor, lion, es, in early game heavy magic dmg kills her easily - zeus, es, lina, meepo, in late game she cant deal with illusion based heroes like pl, ck or naga or much harder carries like spectre and am."
TrueDoTA2,397j8a,dirtyslarkpicker,2,Wed Jun 10 07:26:31 2015 UTC,"Played a ton of core WR lately, and the thing I fear most is blademail, and counter initiation. WR can 1v1 90℅ of hero's and outside of focus fire is overall pretty weak. I feel bloodseeker is a pretty strong counter blademail is a common pick up and rupture goes through bkb and her windrun!"
TrueDoTA2,397j8a,azwaldor,2,Wed Jun 10 08:59:22 2015 UTC,Yep. Blade mail just leaves you standing there waiting as they run away. Juat using bkb to avoid the blade mail is a shitty feeling playing WR. Centar is alsi strong against her. Just his feedback does boat loads of damage.

Return if she Focus Fires you for some reason, and she takes a boatload of physical damage that isn't blocked by BKB. If she targets someone else, Agh's Stampede reduces damage her target takes by 60%. And in the midgame Stomp + Double Edge owns WR. And Stampede to catch up through Windrun.  I'll try Centaur the next time I see a core Windrunner picked and see how it goes."

Bloodseeker is annoying but not a counter pick (I just windrun and tp out). Ogre, Tinker, and Zues cause her problems and look to pick those who shut her down early with magic damage. Basically heavy magic damage really hurts her.  Silencer is strong to pick as well you can burst her down before she can windrun when you ult. Think magic damage and roaming as 5.   Slark is her worst enemy when he gets silver edge.   Treat her like pa. Rush mkbs. When you get mkb against her playing her core becomes much tougher and slaher guides doesnt address that."

TrueDoTA2,397j8a,Defiled-,2,Thu Jun 11 06:33:14 2015 UTC,No one has mentioned Tiny yet.  She can't ult you - Craggy will almost constantly proc and this will force her to A) Buy a BKB and B) Use a BKB just to focus fire you.  Tiny has a decent lockdown and burst magic damage. Initiate your combo as soon as she activates windrun and she is dead.
TrueDoTA2,397j8a,Trollul,1 point,Thu Jun 11 10:51:34 2015 UTC,"Craggy Exterior only procs inside a 300-range radius though, so you can't really count on it. Other than that, avalanche+toss combo is a pretty solid tool for killing WR mid-game."

TrueDoTA2,397j8a,cantadmittoposting,2,Wed Jun 10 00:51:44 2015 UTC,It does reflect focus fire so if you happen to free the target before focus lands you get a pretty significant turnaround

TrueDoTA2,397nzs,Firtree8,9,Tue Jun 9 21:10:05 2015 UTC,"Not sure if you learn the same way I do but when I first started learning it was by playing Invoker Game and having contests between friends to see who could get the best score. Then I went into a bot game with cheats enabled and gave myself 4-6 core items and went 1v5 on hard bots (all players level 25) to learn how to cast under pressure. From there I just started learning how to use the spells properly by playing and watching replays.  I would recommend not using macros for Invoker, I see it as cheating but everyone has their own view on that.  The main thing I want to stress is not focusing purely on combo plays. I see too many Invokers go max Exort with Euls for the Sun Strike, Meteor, Deafening Blast combo and then not have any idea what to do while they are on cooldown."
TrueDoTA2,397nzs,Daevii,7,Tue Jun 9 21:24:23 2015 UTC,"Hi.  I think you should definitely play some bot games first. For me, I've played a lot of bot games and I'm still not comfortable to pick Invoker.  I'll play him if I random him, but I know it will take a few tries to shake off the rust.  I also did some private lobby practice with WTF on practicing the major combos:    Tornado->Meatball->Deafening Blast Eul's  ->Sunstrike->Meatball->Deafening Blast Tornado->EMP   It's possible that I'm just too old for this, but I really think Invoker is a different level of Dota.  I will let players with more experience speak to item builds and counters etc.  I don't see how OD counters him particularly though... Dotabuff has them nearly even in matchups."
TrueDoTA2,397nzs,nice_guy_threeve,3,Tue Jun 9 21:27:15 2015 UTC,Something like this really helps. Idk if this one is going to force you to log in via steam or something stupid. There was a version that didn't do that. But one of these types of games really helped me solidify the combos.  http://www.invokergame.com/
TrueDoTA2,397nzs,broccolincheese,3,Tue Jun 9 22:12:26 2015 UTC,"I only play invoker now. He's my favorite and I think personally the best hero in the game. He is ridiculously flexible.   I started in pubs and lost a lot of games, who cares, now I win most games.  Build:  To pick your build, at the start of the game I look at our teams. If I think I need to be a damage dealer, and I think that the other team doesn't have a lot of gank potential, and doesn't have any characters I particularly want to EMP/control, or I think I can safety and usefully split push, then I go QE.   If our team has some good carries or damage, but lacks control, or if their team has people that need to be shutdown/emp'd (wk, antimage, dusa, other big carries, lots of magic heores), or if I think I can do a lot of ganking, then I go QW.  Most times I end up QW.  Items:   You can build invoker a million ways, generally I go for either speed and utility, speed and spells, or speed and right click. So usually I start with phase boots into euls. Then you can move on to basically whatever you need, you can get sheep stick/atos, blink/forcestaff, aghs + refresher, or bkb/shivas/skadi, you can get tp boots and a necro book if you want. Basically anything your team needs or any way you feel like playing. Speed is important with QW especially, by the end of the game I am just running around the whole map without a care in the world causing as much chaos as possible.  Spells:  Start with a couple of combos and build your way up. Again its all just about practice and being flexible. The main QW combo you need to hit is tornado emp to open up fights. To do this, invoke both, then just cast emp first, then tornado on the same spot. For most of the game you want to cast emp first and then they wont have time to run. You can follow that up heaps of ways, def blast, cold snap a kill target/carry, ice wall the whole team by turning sideways, drop a meatball, whatever.  The main QE thing is just hitting sunstrikes, its not that hard and just takes practice.   Also you need to be able to qqw your way out quickly for both builds.  Tornado is one of the best spells in the game, you can purge so many things with it it's truly amazing. Omni knight casts his ulti, you can strip it off their whole team. Be careful you dont mess up your team mates combos with it though, just like euls.  The easiest way to learn the spells for me was by color (this is a bit weird). The colors of the spells and their icons generally line up with what they take to invoke. For example, meatball is mostly orange and firey, but it has a tinge of purple in the animation, so thats eeq. Ghost walk turns you blue but you have some crackling pink energy - qqw. tornado is mostly purple but has a tinge of blue in it, qqe. Cold snap is totally blue, qqq. EMP is totally purple www. After a while your fingers will just do it themselves. Add more spells in slowly. Most important first stuff like alacrity later.  Counters:  There are none (if youre QW), the fact that you can completely strip anyone's mana, stealth away, disarm and stun, ice wall etc means that you can always turn a fight around or escape. Even anti mage is so easy to deal with with tornado emp. If you are QE then heaps of stuff can mess you up, especially gankers.  Invoker is not that hard to play really, and is insanely powerful, as well as crazy fun. Enjoy."
TrueDoTA2,397nzs,w4rtortle,1 point,Wed Jun 10 01:00:19 2015 UTC,"Tornado mostly purple with a tinge of blue QWW.  And forget about the actual animations of the skills, the icons themselves have the exact same color scheme of blending the amounts of blue/orange/pink."
TrueDoTA2,397nzs,Jmadman311,2,Wed Jun 10 20:09:43 2015 UTC,"It doesn't matter if you play bot games or real games.  The most important thing is to be able to rapidly ghost walk.  Q Q W R D will get you out of a lot of pickles if you can just keep your head and push the buttons.  The easiest way for me to start was the 4Q/4E build, at level 9 this gives you double forge spirits and cold snap and you can just click on people or towers, and its a pretty stable build as you have access to great HP regen and attack damage to last hit with.    What helped me a lot was coming up with a logic for why spells were invoked a certain way.  E is damae, W is movement, Q is disable.  So sunstrike is all damage, meteor is mostly damage but it moves a little, tornado moves a lot and stuns a little.  Idk if you learn stuff the same way but this was easier than rote memorization for me."
TrueDoTA2,397nzs,UNBR34K4BL3,3,Tue Jun 9 22:35:41 2015 UTC,"It absolutely matters if you play bot games when first learning any hero. If you have the option to play a game to learn the hero, why wouldn't you take that? That way, you don't ruin 4, potentially 9, other player's game.   I'd rather have someone at least try to cycle through the spells in a bot game for the first time than in my game.   Yeah, ghost walk is a nice spell, but if that's all you know, you're a worthless invoker lol. At least have a clue about which combos to use, even if its just one. Hence, bot games."
TrueDoTA2,397nzs,ProfessorMonocle,1 point,Wed Jun 10 05:55:08 2015 UTC,honestly the best thing to do is go into a private lobby with cheats and just fuck around.  I don't think you can learn anything from bot games.

TrueDoTA2,397nzs,ConquestAce,2,Wed Jun 10 08:30:08 2015 UTC,"I dunno why its gotta be such a big deal like people are making it out to be. If you're 4k you understand the game so playing invoker is just a matter of practice. Don't play fucking bot games or whatever because bots aren't even vaguely analog to 4k players. Just play the hero, play it alot, use coldsnap forge spirit as a crutch until you get good at the hero, because colsnap forge invokers pretty much as strong as most heroes in dota even without any other skills being used.   Dont rely on ghostwalk as an escape it wont ever work after the first time in a game at 4k. Use it as initiation or as a way to move around the map. Dont bother to learn the flashy combos and shit, its not actually useful in games, except tornado EMP. Tornado EMP is amazing use it.   Every game you have to decide early whether you can get away with QW invoker, because its alot better but sometimes you cant do it. If they have heroes that dint die to Orchid Coldsnap ect, or if you wont get any cs in lane without exort (this can be worked on, but be realistic, if you go qw vs a storm or queen player you aren't going to get any creeps as a newer invoker player)   Let me know if you have any questions but id be careful of some of the other advice in this thread, as it seems to come from lower skilled players and you may not benefit from it."

One thing you may not have considered is that a good invoker player should be manually casting orbs just for their passive effect quite a bit during the game, even during teamfights when invoke is on cooldown. Another drawback to your idea of ""important"" spells vs ""less important"" spells is that your skill set will change depending on whether you are QW vs QE invoker, whether you are rushing mobility items or damage items, and whether you are dependent on aghs/octarine/refresher or not.  Anyways if you're dead set on learning invoker this way, the most reflex-dependent skills are ghost walk, tornado, icewall, and deafening blast.

I think there are 3 ways to look at it:   Reflex (i.e. ""oh shit"" moments, and ""there's an opportunity"" moments) Spells you use most frequently (changes based on Q/W or Q/E) Combo Sequences   For true reflex spells, you basically have:   Cold Snap - someone jumps on you / you see a kill opportunity Ghost Walk - need to GTFO and hope they don't have detection Tornado - good for fast fight set-up, reset, stalling, and saving allies Deafening Blast - similar situations to Tornado Sun Strike - opportunity somewhere on the map Ice Wall - used in retreat, stalling, and it can be used offensively   In terms of frequency:   Cold Snap - general laning and ganks; good for both primary Invoker builds Forge Spirits - [Q/E] used regularly Tornado - [Q/W] primary setup spell (eventually used somewhat regularly in Q/E unless you get Eul's or something) EMP - [Q/W] primary follow-up spell Sun Strike - [Q/E] used for global presence   In terms of primary combos:   Cold Snap + Forge Spirits (+ Sun Strike) Tornado + EMP Tornado + Meatball + Deafening Blast   However, I think there is also the consideration of ease of Invokation. Cold Snap, EMP, and Sun Stirke are all super easy to invoke since it is 3 of the same orb.    Personally, I think I'd want:   Cold Snap Ghost Walk Tornado Deafening Blast Sun Strike   to all be easy access. Especially Cold Snap and Tornado since they give you time to invoke other spells to combo with."

TrueDoTA2,392zad,genetalgiant,4,Tue Jun 9 04:33:48 2015 UTC,"I have 1 piece of advice for supports that will help them gain MMR:  Support players, your mid is more important than the carry player. This mainly applies to 4k MMR players. The player who picked mid is probably the guy who wants to climb MMR the most, and the litmus test for that is if he picks a strong mid hero (storm, QoP, Lina, etc) or a completely shit mid hero (Alchemist or Treant mid or some shit).  If you prioritize keeping him safe, keeping him ahead of the enemy mid and allowing him to get as much farm as he can, he can end up dominating the game whereas a carry needs probably 100 more cs to dominate as much as the mid can.   There are some exceptions to this, the main one being safelane Slark, who you want to protect because once he gets rolling he dominates."
TrueDoTA2,392zad,aznscourge,1 point,Tue Jun 9 23:34:48 2015 UTC,"Seriously, winning mid lane is absolutely massive at this mmr. Whenever I play support at 3K mmr, I will either start in mid or immediately rotate to mid if our carry is able to hold his own. I can't believe how many times the enemy team will turn on their mid player (esp Storm) for losing the game when he's been fighting 1 vs 2 the whole time in mid without any help from their own supports."
TrueDoTA2,392zad,pucklermuskau,1 point,Thu Jun 11 03:11:20 2015 UTC,"That's why i pick viper :P  That's also why I think 2-2-1 lanes (dual lanes with solo off) are seriously underused in pubs. Even if you're just stacking up a hard camp and protecting the mid from dives, that can make a huge difference in the outcome of the game. Winning mid is great, but it's not nearly as good as losing mid is bad. Losing mid hard (and generally that's how people in pubs lose mid, when they do) can just be a lost game right there.  Generally though, most supports should make sure their carry is not only able to hold his own, but able to freefarm on his own (or with help from the other support) unless mid is either having serious issues or is in a particularly bad matchup. Some support players will find that their style of play is more suited to rotating on mid and they should do that. (play to your identity) The more stable attitude, however, is that as long as your mid is at least able to draw even or be only a little bit behind, get the carry freefarming first."

TrueDoTA2,392zad,christoosss,1 point,Thu Jun 11 02:10:22 2015 UTC,"The single best way you can make a difference in the mid game is to win the lanes. Supports are the most important units on the map in the laning phase, and you need to be making your impact there, before the cores start to outscale you.  Once you hit the mid game, you need to focus on not getting caught out before fights, while being at the fights and able to get your spells off before your damage dealers go down. Tranquils are really useful here, because the movespeed when out of combat will allow you to get most places quickly, and while hanging near the back of a fight waiting for it to start, you can more quickly move in to get your spells off at a key moment before anyone's able to catch you out.  Blink is useful on many supports for the same reasons.  Also it's important for you to keep wards up at all times, preferably ones that see enemy heroes moving around the map. wards that see the rune are rarely all that bad for this. Try to replace them before they fall; once they get to a minute or so, just replace them.  Similarly, when you see an enemy support place a ward, or when enemy heroes react to your team's movements that they can't have seen without a ward, or any other time you figure out where an enemy's ward is, counter it! Having vision is important, and by extension, eliminating opposing vision is crippling.  Some of this stuff is covered in this article, the rest will be covered in the followup articles on zoning and harassing, and warding and map movement.  Thanks for the read and comment!"

TrueDoTA2,394es1,ZoggZ,11,Tue Jun 9 04:33:04 2015 UTC,"Well, it's not even a matter of ganking. Being able to consistently hit razes is a key part of the hero, it's what makes him such a strong farmer and laner.   That said, the only way to practice is to play. You'll get a really good feel for how the razes have their range. If you want to specifically practice razes...I guess you could make a lobby and spawn heroes and just run around and hit them consistently. But yeah, they're not secret. Just practice."
TrueDoTA2,394es1,pastplayer,6,Tue Jun 9 05:06:01 2015 UTC,"because I'm not confident in my razes to get kills   IMO, this is the (your?) biggest barrier to playing SF well. I feel that he's a hero that feeds off the user's confidence. You need confidence to play SF to the best of his abilities. My advice would be to go ahead and gank/counter-gank if you feel that your team can come out top in a fight with you in it. Don't worry about screwing up your razes or getting flamed - after all, that's how you learn. In the AllStar days, I picked up SF and got proficient with him by playing him exclusively for a few months until my ZXC keys became almost as worn out as my ASDF. Just keep dropping those razes to get better.  Clicking on the hero to land a raze is a waste of time as well as dangerous. Its a waste of time because your cursor needs to travel over to the enemy before travelling away again to last hit or something. Its dangerous because in clicking on the enemy, your hero might move in a direction that opens you up for ganks. What I usually do is click around my hero and if you want to raze, click on the ground in front of SF to make him face that direction, then drop a raze. In terms of actual distance I suppose I'm clicking roughly 2mm away from his model?   Another effective technique to pick up would be raze cancelling, but be wary of over-relying on this. I've seen SFs that could have killed someone with the raze but they accidentally, or instinctively hit 's' instead. By the time they drop the intended raze, the enemy is just out of range. Raze cancelling is helpful if you're trying to drop a lucky raze on an invis hero or is someone dodging left and right to escape.   Hope this helps, and happy razing! (:"
TrueDoTA2,394es1,0root,4,Tue Jun 9 07:40:18 2015 UTC,"Skip the Midas. SF farms so fast that you absolutely do not need it. There's a lot of good items on SF so I would never say that there's an ideal build for him. If you look at my dotabuff you'll see that my itembuilds differ a lot from game to game. Ideally you'll want raw damage, of course. However in most games you just cannot do that. You have to build your items according to what you need. Sometimes just purely tanking up up with HotD / Skadi / Satanic / Butterfly is needed, sometimes getting HotD into Damageitems and a very late Satanic is good.  I'd say that basically all traditional carry items can be be built on SF. S&Y, Skadi, Daedalus, Butterfly, MKB, Satanic, Desolator are all viable itemchoices on SF, sometimes even stuff like EBlade and Diffu work.  As for the Ganks: If you get shittalked for not ganking, just mute. SF is horrible at ganking unless you have a really nice rune (Invis / Haste). Just farm up. Your team will profit way more from you having a metric shitton of farm after 15mims.   Of course, if your team wants to push really early you can do that with items like Mek.  However, ganking is not a good idea as I said above.   Here's my DB: http://www.dotabuff.com/players/31392545/matches?date=&hero=shadow-fiend&skill_bracket=&lobby_type=&game_mode=&region=&faction=&duration=&timezone=Etc%2FUTC"
TrueDoTA2,394es1,DasFroDo,2,Tue Jun 9 05:08:27 2015 UTC,I'm no SF expert but I've seen several guides which suggest clicking as close to your hero as possible to aim and never at your target. Clicking as close to your hero should minimise the risk of pathing issues
TrueDoTA2,394es1,Hans93,1 point,Tue Jun 9 09:28:09 2015 UTC,"This is exactly what I do - you shouldn't be clicking any units, just directly in front of your hero in the direction you want the raze to hit."
TrueDoTA2,394es1,Defiled-,2,Tue Jun 9 15:46:12 2015 UTC,"Clicking on the target itself is poor fundamentally and is a bad habit to develop if you plan on playing SF a good amount.   Explanation: If you click on your target to raze it will guide SF to your target for auto attack range. So, clicking works in the case of no obstruction and headed straight toward your target, i.e. walking down lane, etc. However, this is a poor habit to develop because when you're going in for moderate to more difficult razes, which become more common as you have to play more defensively and with better positioning, you will be facing to wrong direction to raze, but still headed toward your target.   For example, if you're walking back from bottom rune to middle lane and see a CM with a quarter of her health left running parallel to you in the river you can do one of two things.    Click on CM to aim raze. If she is out of your attack range SF will continue to run toward middle lane, thus making you raze nothing but grass under your T1 mid tower. Not an ideal outcome.  Click just in front of your hero, in line with where CM is going, raze the appropriate distance (more of a feel thing than explainable), and CM dies.    This is why always clicking is a bad habit. It can slow down your farming, as razing camps you don't have vision of happens every game you play SF and increases jungle farm efficiency by quite a bit. It destroys your potential at very, very important kills, the ones that usually ""get away"" are often just misplays by an SF who doesn't understand that raze should not be used as a click target ability.   Cheers.   EDIT: As far as item builds go it's fairly variable. Some people say you should build appropriately to the team your facing and the situation you're in, which is no doubt true, but if there is a play style you are simply better at playing, play it.  I'm much better at the blink/euls/mobility SF than I am the walking tank mek/bkb/skadi SF. So I play to my strengths. I can adjust if necessary but if there is a situation where I'm not 100% sure what would work better I always go with what I'm comfortable with."

I would explain in-depth the reasoning for a Midas purchase but this is not the place for it.. Anyhow, with SF your job is to stay one item ahead of the most farmed hero on the enemy team, or break even at least. If you can't do that, your method of recovery is usually BoT/Blink and split push the enemy so that you are threatening an objective everytime they try to take one of yours."

Without question, it's either this precise situation I've described over and over again until we finally get outcarried and lose, or my team is on top of shit and we rax them before 30 minutes and it's GG from there. It's by far my biggest gripe with pub play, if I don't get all 5 teammates talking at the pick screen, and we don't agree to an early game lineup, everyone just fucks off to do their own thing until they realise they can't put a scratch on the enemy carry and suddenly noob cyka team report. Ugh.  It's part of the reason I enjoy playing LC so much. You build a steady advantage in the early game, and then nobody can fight you afterwards, cause you take a quarter of their HP in one swing. I found that Ursa is pretty good for similar reasons. If you snowball, nothing can stop you. If you don't, and barely have items, you're still much more of a threat than most underfarmed carries would be. Altough it sometimes can give you a false sense of power.

TrueDoTA2,394gcb,ilikebuildingsheds,1 point,Tue Jun 9 15:55:11 2015 UTC,"autoattack down a creepwave and push it into the enemy tower after coming to gank,   Depending on the timing and success of the gank, this can be the right thing to do. If you've made a kill or two or forced the enemy out of lane, its a good opportunity to get some good damage on a tower. There's no opponent to defend or get last hits or xp, so it's fine. In your safe lane, you have the opportunity to pull it back easily after the push. Mid creep equilibrium isn't a big deal. And if you just ganked their carry, you probably had to dive the tower aND if their team didn't TP to support, you ought to push because it makes it even tougher for their carry to farm.  Now if this is happening really early game, you probaby don't have enough damage to actually push the tower very well and the enemy will have a quick respawn time anyway so they don't lose much if they can TP back to lane in 10 seconds. So, not a good idea then.  Overall, I'd say pubs are actually bad at translating kills into objectives, which is kind of the opposite."

TrueDoTA2,393x2o,ExtraRicey,8,Tue Jun 9 02:08:45 2015 UTC,"It's actually one of the best early game items for ember. If anything, you want a basilius on ember at least.   Read slash strikes guide to ember, I'm on mobile and don't feel like acrobat linking.   Assume you're maxing flame guard and chains in some sort of progression. It won't be magic damage that kills you when you have a maxed flame guard, it's physical damage on ember when he has 2 armor with drums and terrible agi gain for an agi hero.   You won't be building armor on ember any time soon since you'll be rushing damage items or stat items like manta, bkb, or Skadi. Aquila and bottle should honestly stay in your inventory for a long time, probably more than wand.   It allows you to pressure towers earlier alone as ember, as remnant pretty much guarantees you won't die outside of blink hexes, global, glimpse, etc.  I read over your post again and realize you agree with the aura part. The armor is important though. Also, drum isn't bad for the reasons you mentioned. Movespeed is important in ember as his remnant is movespeed based and if you don't have a defensive one down, or decide you need to yolo forward, items like Yasha and Euls make a noticeable difference, especially versus slows.   And before your first damage item, ember right clicks with attack speed matter a lot, it happens to be the timing when you don't have max sleight of fist.   Also, attack speed is important is a reason treads is overlooked on ember too much. Phase boots Rush is a relic from when you could go 4-4-0 to be aggressive early on ember. If your doing 4-0-4 like most ember players right now, surviving and being in the middle of fights during flame guard favor treads more and right click dps."

The idea of travels is that you kind of just purchased a no damage, no survivability item. I'd buy a drum on most heroes, and it's not a terrible item here. But you don't do too much different things with the drum.   I'd probably not get the battle fury next. I'd probably maelstrom or double maelstrom like he suggests as I have the slot space now. Or something I haven't tried, a sange into silvers edge. The hp buildup seems safer, but shadow first lets you be the split push master.  The rule of thumb is to ask yourself what you want that game: greed, damage, and survivability. If they have no lockdown, skip on survivability. If they have no HP, consider forgoing damage for HP as you don't want to out glass cannon them ( maybe you do).   If you go travels you have the farming aspect, just not the damage or stats. Maelstrom is fast damage and drums or something like sange or Yasha. Or s and y or Skadi."

I like travels on morph first, but if I'm feeling stupid if I go travels first, I go brown boots into ethereal rush or Yasha into travels.   It gives you the option to make manta or s and y if you realize you don't have the space to go greedy items. Like if they find orchid and you have travels, you're boned for 5k for manta or bkb, lotus, or Euls respectively.

I think that if you are farming well enough to be able to purchase drums early, then you're doing well and will probably snowball just fine (so do it). Otherwise, if you're having trouble laneing and stuff, then aquila might not be too bad. I think, overall, it's a situational pickup.

TrueDoTA2,3947vv,goblinbiddin,6,Tue Jun 9 03:33:32 2015 UTC,"I think the thing about players in general, myself included, is that they have in their head a threshold of damage they think they can take. As many cores, you can get away walking places supports cannot at many points in the game.   It becomes a problem even if you play a game as an over farmed support the previous game. Then if you play a normal farm support or under farmed core, you overestimate your limits of your own damage.   It's things that cores can do also like farm creep waves in lane. It's risky, but the cores need farm and have a chance of surviving. A support 9/10 times will die and not be worth it. Like my friend tps to farm lane creeps late game as venge or even someone more acceptable like Lina, but even staying til the end of the creep wave can be an open invitation for a hank."
TrueDoTA2,3947vv,wildtarget13,6,Tue Jun 9 03:48:46 2015 UTC,"My first pice of advice is some game are going to be hard. Some games are 70/30 against you from the draft and laning choices. Some games are going to be dead easy because your opponent makes those same dumb choices. Step 1 - What type of game is it going to be.  Step 2: Mechanics - if you cannot chain pull/pull through/stack properly and zone and offlaner properly then don't support. If you are playing a position 4 jungler support - your role is still to SUPPORT this does not mean 20 min of AFK jungling to be the 4th core, it means using your farm advantage and space to get something done and make a difference.  Now that said. Look at your draft, look at your lanes and then set up a game plan. Is this a game where i am going to need to gank mid early, can I even do that with a jungling void who started in the pull camp and now my carry is sitting under the enemy T1 against a dual lane because he is auto-attacking creeps.. maybe this guy cannot be helped and I could be more useful elsewhere. Do i REALLY need brown boots right now even though it is 7 minutes in and I'm solo support and there is no vision and the void is still in the jungle? Maybe i should change my build and sacrifice for my team and spend the desperately earned 400+ gold on 4 sentries and protect the lanes from the roaming bounty. Support is about efficiency. Can you enable early ganks, if the answer is yes then go for it, if the team feels they need to play passive and you can't make anything happen then ward defensively and stack all the things - i mean stack EVERY xx:53 every time - 7 stack at 7 minutes will make a big difference and hope nobody feeds. If a lane is getting rekt (3 deaths before 5 minutes) try work out why and see if you can go help or if you can be better use elsewhere. Maybe drop them a useful ward and get one gank in. This can turn around a losing lane. I am not gonna lie and say it is easy. If there are 2 supports in a game you may be able to split the workload and make it happen - co-ordinate with the other support. If you are the only support, tough it out and make the best decision you can. Lastly itemise for the game you are in. Just because you always buy X item on hero Y doesn't mean it is the best choice every game. I have bought mana boots on heroes that really don't need the mana because my TEAM was mana hungry and we needed the sustain to push. I have bought a solar crest because our right click wasn't good enough to take rosh in a reasonable time and so on.  Abuse FOG. If you are always showing the enemy knows they are safe or maybe they don't bother coming after your core who looks to be solo farming a lane. If you are in the fog though.. then they either have to play scared or take risks. Vision is everything in Dota and support live and play with vision.  Most important - Don't feed. If you cannot be of help in the fight don't go in extra late and try ""help out."" look at the state of the fight and decide what can i do if the answer is ""not much"" then back off and go stack or farm a little if you can to be more useful next time.  And finally: A support has the most time to focus map awareness - use your mic and chat wheel and alt-click items. Keep the team informed of ganks, set up ganks, keep track of enemy item progression, call plays. IF they don't want your help or tell you to STFU. Game is hard, mute that guy and see who WANTs your help."
TrueDoTA2,3947vv,greenhatman99,1 point,Tue Jun 9 08:49:19 2015 UTC,"Pulling is not as good as people pump it up to be. It screws up your core's lasthits, damages the tower and burns your teammates regeneration, ruins lane equilibrium and doesnt' even deny a lot of exp to begin with. For the 1 benefit of pulling there's a dozen negatives and as a rule of thumb when i play support (70% of the games) or core (the remaining 30%) you should NEVER pull. It's easier to deny the enemy out of exp and keep the creep wave stationary while also enjoying kill potential than to pull and having the lane push with 2 waves to your opponents tower feeding him gold, lots of exp and giving him relative safety of the tower.  Games where your support mlgpr0pentapulls and games where your carry isn't capable of holding the lane stationary are the worst and no amount of pro pulls will fix the lack of experience/skill of your teammate. Carries that don't have basic knowledge of lane control will struggle even more if you throw in pulls aswell and supports will just fuck up the timings and pull at the wrong time and stack your creep waves or leave you hanging with no creep wave and the whole enemy creepwave under your tower."
TrueDoTA2,3947vv,InvisibleBlue,2,Wed Jun 10 23:29:25 2015 UTC,"Hm... I find myself not pulling in many support games, but in most of those games, if I go back and study the replay, i'll find at least one instance where I probably should have.  I agree that most pub supports overpull, however.  The best use of the single pull is to take down the opposing offlane t1, but make sure your carry is capable of making a jungle transition after you do this, or it can get pretty awkward.  Overpulling is a thing many supports do, but also many carries static farm when they shouldn't. Some carries don't like taking down the offlane t1 early in the game, but really, as soon as you can use your own jungle effectively, you should try to take that tower down, not only for the gold, but because it closes down your opponents' space (tower vision and especially creep vision are important for controlling space.) For this reason, when you've managed to force an offlaner out of lane and back to his jungle, for instance, it's a pretty good time to go for a single pull and start chipping away at that t1."
TrueDoTA2,3947vv,InvisibleBlue,1 point,Thu Jun 11 01:47:12 2015 UTC,Getting a pre 8 min tower safelane with drow has been one of my recipes for success. Pulling has it's uses but as a rule of thumb it's usually best to play without it in lane aside for the intentional single pull pushes which i love.
TrueDoTA2,3947vv,greenhatman99,1 point,Thu Jun 11 02:24:26 2015 UTC,"Drow is good at hitting buildings; drow should hit buildings whenever she can. I agree that repeated single pulls are generally shit. Chain pulls are actually pretty damned good. Stack-pulls are also fine. Pulling certainly has its place in the game. Just don't pull because ""it's what you do."" There needs to be a reason."
TrueDoTA2,3947vv,enferder,1 point,Thu Jun 11 03:31:32 2015 UTC,"When I refer to pulling I mean to so do make the lane SAFER for the carry. I.e pulling through (double pull) or stack pulling - to deny the entire wave and bring the creep equilibrium back to my tower.  If you are trying to lane support your carry under the enemy tower in the safelane you SUCK at your job and so does your carry for pushing the wave unnecessarily.  Against a solo offlaner you cannot zone without a decent distance between the creep wave and their tower. Against a dual offlane their kill potential is MUCH higher when your carry is almost on the river.  Also by pulling and not camping the lane, you are giving solo XP to a carry which is REALLY important if the solo offlaner is getting farm, as they will outlevel your carry otherwise. In a dual offlane situation I usually only pull once to bring the wave back if it get to far and to give the carry one or 2 waves of solo XP while I get solo XP from the pull. When i return to lane we have an XP and gold advantage.  If the lane has massive kill potential, like a undying + bane or lina + shadow daemon or something then prioritising carry defense is critical. If you don't have defensive capability in that lane is often just better to join the other support and roam or attempt to aggro trilane the offlane.  If you are in a tri-safe lane - then you ask the carry and other support to push a little while you chain-pull. So you can outfarm/level them. And both support should be securing runs and stacking as necessary to give the carry a boost when he comes to clear a few jungle camps.  Pulling the lane back also give your mid or other support ganking potential if the lane is just outside of your tower range and the dual lane is greedy enough to come in for last hits.  It is game dependent - but if you cannot pull-through (chain-pull) or stack->pull consistently you will ruin the lane for the carry.  One last thing - against an axe or dark seer or any lane-skipping hero - pulling is very high risk and should only be attempted if your carry is a natural pusher.   Note: In 90% of lane equilibrium mistakes carries make it is overpushing the lane. Pulling and heavy creep denying by both carry and support is the only viable way to bring the wave somewhere safer."
TrueDoTA2,3947vv,Dwavenhobble,8,Thu Jun 11 09:40:47 2015 UTC,"It's one thing for people to not immediately perform well as a support because it's not their usual role, but you can remedy that with guides and experience. If the issue persists, then the problem might lie in their mentality.  Many ""supports"" enter the game thinking ""I'm giving the core roles to you scrubs so you better do your job,"" and it's evident when they lose and say ""My teammates can't carry."" That kind of arrogance is what you do NOT want to have when you're playing support. Think about it, your mid player probably has enough ego for two teams, no need for you to add to that.  At the same time, you need to maintain confidence in yourself. Most pro captains play support. Likewise, you're not a ward bitch. You're a bodyguard, and the bane of your enemy. You have the right to not feed, even if it means not dying together with a core who messed up. You're also entitled to some farm. It's the cliche ""You can't support others if you can't support yourself."""
TrueDoTA2,3947vv,Whilyam,2,Tue Jun 9 06:21:52 2015 UTC,"Yeh no. I tend to find putting carries in their place early stops this. If they start getting mouthy, you blast them right back. So many carries seem to think they can play support better than you, you simply have to force them to focus on their game not yours. Yes they have Ego for both teams but you want that Ego focusses on their own play not pestering you. Believe that you know best how to support (especially if you've been playing support for a long time)  I've had carries moan about lack of wards with 4 wards up and try to order me to place them in really dumb spot. When you've learned where to ward, when to ward and have an idea how the enemy team will react (e.g. do they like to gank a lot and set traps, if so side wards can work well, if they like to fight then run off and farm the jungle then wards on jungle paths are good.)"
TrueDoTA2,3947vv,Whilyam,2,Wed Jun 10 05:02:29 2015 UTC,"One of my main problems in all roles is that my team does stupid shit instead of trying to win the game. Instead of knocking down the T4s and throning them, my team retreats after I've already initiated and goes to farm Radiance."

I do stupid shit, my teammates do stupid shit, we're all same rank, screw it.  If you find that a problem then first and foremost improve yourself and discover a way to dictate the battlefield. Wards are mind controlling beacons of light that attract flies and players alike. If you plant down a ward in the enemy jungle your teammates will see the enemies farm and as such be a hundred times more likely to go and gank into the jungle. Tricks like these are thefore paramount in controling the pace of the game.  Remember, wards attract players if the wards provide vision of enemy players. You can use them to dictate pushes, aim ganks, encourage teamfights etc.  Never ever resign to the mentality of ""if i had a better team x and y would have happened""  If x and y never happens the common denominator is you. If you can't climb mmr in 40+ games then you need to improve, not your teammates."
TrueDoTA2,3947vv,InvisibleBlue,1 point,Wed Jun 10 23:44:36 2015 UTC,"I feel like I can't win when I play support despite being very comfortable doing it.  It's always just a crapshoot.   Sometimes I make questionable plays or expect follow up from teammates or try to save clearly doomed cores.  But many of the times I just have shitty cores who don't know what the fuck they're doing.  Or just shitty picks.   There's honestly only so much you can do with a safelane LC / Ursa (who goes jungle at level 3 and then proceeds to suicide to roshan twice in a row before realizing he needs level 4 to be able to do it), with a solo offlane Antimage - who cant contest a luna.    Won the lane for our safelane convincingly, got myself experience, had great wards up most of the game and dewarded 3-4 enemy observers.  Didn't rotate mid because as a solo support our safelane woud have been crushed by the offlane viper.  But in the end their safelane basically 1v5'd our team because our highest level heroes just didn't work.  the LC lost 3 duels to the enemy carry where she had no right to be popping duel.  The ursa decided he was invincible and dove on their side of the map (their T2's) with Aegis, only to die twice.    The problem is that you really don't have nearly as much control over a game as a support.  PARTICULARLY a solo support as is the case with most pubs.  People like to pretend that supports have the most control over a game, because in pro games Kuroky and Puppey can roll the game from the start with rubick and enchantress, or because Fenrir and fy can just completely wreck the game with Bounty Hunter and Earthshaker.  Or whatever.   But the thing is you don't have that type of coordination or the ability to call shots in pubs.  And you have much less leverage on overall momentum despite doing well early.  Plus, again 9 times out of 10 in pub games it's solo support.  And that's probably for the best.  It sucks a dick for the solo support but having duo supports in a team that can't close out games early (like is often the case in pubs) can be a pretty big liability."
TrueDoTA2,3947vv,InvisibleBlue,1 point,Tue Jun 9 21:37:40 2015 UTC,"Play Captain's Mode, pick 2 supports, win many games :P  Sometimes people throw, they do this in core roles, they do it in support roles. we can't play all 5 roles on our team at once, even if we may want to.  I actually find that 2 support teams don't actually start falling off when compared to solo support teams until well after 60 minutes, so considering the advantages of having 2 supports, and the likelyhood that the game will end or one side will have an overwhelming advantage before that point, I think that 2 support teams are generally superior, and that dedicated junglers are generally pretty bad, especially in this patch (with some exceptions)  Something to keep in mind, when running a 2 support lineup (such as one with a safelane tri) is how to get some farm, or at the very least a good chunk of xp, on to those heroes. This is a shared responsibility between cores and supports, and one that requires communication. In ""4 core"" situations with only 1 support, it becomes nearly impossible to do this (they're nearly always off doing support things), and eventually that 1 support starts falling so far behind that it's nearly impossible for them to get back into the game.   This is a big reason that 2 support teams, when run properly, are generally better than solo support teams, and even if you run a dedicated jungler like enigma or chen, it's best to split the load and have, perhaps, 2 of the cores help the support out, (buy a few wards, buy smoke and dust, etc) even if it just means buying a couple hundred gold worth of support ""stuff"" and dropping it from stash (for god's sake guys, this dude is running around all game trying to make your lives easier, throw the man a bone)."
TrueDoTA2,3947vv,InvisibleBlue,1 point,Thu Jun 11 02:03:18 2015 UTC,"How to win as support.   1) pray to Your respective deity (Dire or Radiant) that the carry on your side has at least the brain capacity of the average Labrador   2) make sure some other poor sap on your team buys the courier, in pubs buying courier and wards will mean your team will expect you to do nothing but do that, even with sentry wards which they'll claim is your job to place in all 3 lanes at once. 3) Force Staff. If nothing else when a carry on your team does something dumb you can save them, or throw them onto a cliff for  while  4) Ward often. Late game you always want one ward near Rosh, my favourite spot is the dire Secret Shop overlooking their ancients as most teams smoke in sight of that spot but not in sight in the river."
TrueDoTA2,3947vv,dirtyslarkpicker,1 point,Wed Jun 10 04:56:19 2015 UTC,"To be a good support you need to calm the fuck down and take it step by step.  ALWAYS question yourself: WHAT CAN I ACHIEVE HERE AND HOW CAN I DO IT.  Be decisive and make timely decisions. Sometimes you'll waste a tp and sometimes you'll make the most insane 1hp save plays. Never ever let yourself fall into the trap of thinking too hard about stuff. Make an informed decision based on what you know and remember that moment.  based on the options and relative chance at success decide what's the best course of action and stick with it. Don't walk back and forth between lane and small camp just so you're close enough if your carry gets dove but far away enough not to contribute to the lane. Go to the jungle with a tp scroll and stack or gank one of the lanes. If you're not actively making the lane easier for your carry it's better if you leave. BAD CALLS hurt the lane. Don't be over aggresive. If you can't establish a raport with your lane mate leave the lane and gank mid then double back and try to gank the lane you left. Many people underestimate kill potential and fail to take advantage.  Don't feel burdened by farming or leveling. a level 2 or 3 support at 5 min into the game is nothing to be horrified about. As a support you only have 1 resource that's important in the early game and that is time. Spend it wisely.  It might seem counter intuitive that you need to calm down while making the most out of every single second but it is important. You should never feel rushed but you should also never be idle. You have the time to gank, you have the time to stack and you have the time to ward, you just need to take it. By feeling pressured for time you expose yourself to mistakes and bad calls.  To be a good support you need to understand that your time is valuable and that how you spend it isn't dictated by an arbitrary lane you or your team decided for you."
TrueDoTA2,392f3t,ShamanisticRapeDream,15,Mon Jun 8 19:35:03 2015 UTC,"Historically  There is a lot that goes into it, especially because with a lane of 3 heroes there are an massive number of ways to compose your trilane.  Originally, trilanes were used as a way to absolutely destroy 2-1-2. Three strong laners against a dual lane meant that they could kill the dual lane enough to offset the XP balance, or zone the dual lane while the carry free farmed. If the lane got pushed out, you could drop back and pull to restore the equilibrium.  Trilanes became the standard and teams had to adapt. You don't want to sacrifice a full lane of XP, so you get solo offlaners that can survive the 3v1 ""suicide"" lane.  In a 3v1 lane, you don't necessarily need 2 supports zoning a solo offlaner full time. This opens you up to greedier supports that cannot zone well/lack in laning ability, want farm from jungling/pulling, as well as roaming heroes.  This kind of leads into the next idea here...  Not All Trilanes Are Equal  Hero composition determines a lot of what a trilane is capable of, as well as matchup.  Trilanes can get kills, they can guarantee farm, they can control the lane, they can be greedier and try for more gold/xp, etc.  It all depends on what you want to accomplish in the laning phase and what you expect to be up against.  You cannot just throw 2 supports and a carry in a lane and expect it to work though. Like let's say we put together a lane of Anti-Mage, Omniknight, and Abaddon -- opposing team picks Dark Seer. That lane is going to be hell for the trilane because they have no way to effectively deal with Ion Shell, nor can they do much about Surge.  Potential Benefits  Since there are a lot of ways to build a trilane, there aren't exactly a set of benefits. But some things you can get from trilaning are:   Kill potential Guaranteed carry farm Supports that generate threat (i.e. when they are MIA, could be ganking, could be pulling, etc.) Extra gold/XP from pulling or jungling Controlling the lane (e.g. where the creep waves meet via pulls) Controlling the runes Reducing what they offlane(rs) get out of the lane   Downsides  Generally, the biggest downside is sharing XP. Also, there is a lot more communication needed, as well as being able to read the lane.  In a pub match, these can turn into disastrous results. Some of the most common issues you see with newbie trilanes are:   Pulling   This can be the support's fault - pulling too much and forcing the lane under the tower Can also be a novice carry that does not farm the lane well and either fucks the supports over by giving them no opportunity to pull, or just has no idea how to last hit under tower  Supports that do not abuse positioning   A huge benefit of the trilane is having 1-2 supports that are regularly off the map -- if they both sit in lane is generates no threat anywhere else on the map  Aggression   Teammates need to read the lane and know when to get in position to go for a kill on the offlane A lot of carry players also fall short in laning because they cannot lane for shit and either get zoned by the offlaner/never pressure the offlane, and they also play passively way behind the creep wave so they cannot go in for kills Some supports are overly aggressive when the teammates cannot be and end up feeding offlaners who are often fine trading blows if they have more regen/access to gold  Inefficient use of time   Lots of supports sit and mooch XP while doing nothing There are tons of things to do - pulls, stacking for farm, being MIA, controlling rune, ganking lanes, setting up kills, etc.  Itemization   Players that are unused to trilaning often bring stupid shit to lane, or do not allocate resources well For instance, heroes like CM and Sand King often benefit from starting with boots so they can actually set up kills (i.e. when you know you will lane against an offlaner you can kill) In a number of pubs, you also see a pull get warded and then the supports are both sitting in lane doing nothing instead of starting with Sentries on one support (which is more necessary when you have two supports that cannot roam well, cannot jungle, and cannot reliably kill the offlaner) A lot of noobie trilane supports also just buy stupid shit if the other support buys wards/courier -- like Ring of Basilius, Null Talismen, a full Magic Wand, Headdress, etc.    So when it comes to pubs, it's hard because people have vastly different levels of knowledge (i.e. you don't have to be an expert at everything to hit 5k) and you need players to be roughly on the same page when it comes to trilanes. A lot of players just know the motions of the trilane and have no idea how it works -- which is kind of like knowing the Knight in Chess moves in ""L"" shapes, but not knowing how to use that to your advantage."
TrueDoTA2,392f3t,Axosh,0,Mon Jun 8 20:41:21 2015 UTC,"When talking about the benefits of a trilane you saying it's good because you can reduce what their offlane gets out of the lane. But that comes with the added cost of your offlane getting fucked as well. Not really a benefit. Also you can guarantee your carry getting farm in a 2v1,2v2 if you pick a strong laner. In addition supports will have the same threat regardless where their designated lane is. If they go MIA it makes no difference if one of them is laning bot and the other top. In fact you could argue it's actually better because they can cover a larger area at any point in time. So in conclusion, when picking a weak afk-farm carry(AM, dusa,) I can see the benefits of a trilane. But with a gyro, jugger, pos1 lesh I cannot see the benefits."
TrueDoTA2,392f3t,UNBR34K4BL3,2,Mon Jun 8 21:42:16 2015 UTC,"The original trilane was a counter to 2-1-2.  Two aggressive supports + a carry easily win against a dual lane.  Typical offlane hero, but going against 2 heroes instead of 3.  Its win/win.  Every counter has a counter.  The simplest is to mirror, run your own trilane and solo offlane.  An alternative is to aggressively trilane and use your safelane as a 1v1 lane.  Finally you can run a very strong dual lane, essentially out pick your opponent so that the 3v2 works against them."
TrueDoTA2,392f3t,goblinbiddin,1 point,Mon Jun 8 23:13:21 2015 UTC,"Notail once said, you're always making trades, in dota. The benefit of the trilane is it's safe. Your carry will almost certainly farm. Your mid will probably end up 1v1. Your offlane is picked as one because he can handle the role, even 3v1. This is a good starting point to develop a lineup; assume you'll run a safelane tri and adapt when it makes sense to.   If you get a jugger or gyro that does open you up to running an aggro dual, or a dual mid, with the support stacking for a shadow fiend or something similar. or a BB + 1 offlane that really causes problems even for enemy safelane tris. This is part of why those heroes are strong.  However, this does not mean you cannot run a safelane tri and still get your supports farmed up. A jugger or gyro can buy a MoM or HotD quickly and rotate into the jungle, allowing him to farm reasonably well while staying out of vision so he can't be ganked. This opens up space for the supports to get additional farm and levels.  Your offlaner will likely be forced out of his lane at some point, and he may fall back to pick up some jungle stacks, at which point a support can rotate over and defend the tower when it gets pressured, allowing that support some farm and xp. The same thing may happen when mid goes to gank.  The idea is, just because your carry can help himself to secure his own farm doesn't mean it's a bad thing to commit 2 supports to making damned sure it's secured, when you have a plan to get them their farm and levels as well.  Then again, you're right, you shouldn't feel like you're glued to the idea of an aggro tri just because it's often good and safe. if you see an opportunity to go for something else that will be more rewarding, try it! maybe run an enigma jungle with a safelane dual, for example."
TrueDoTA2,392f3t,ThePerpetualGamer,5,Tue Jun 9 01:53:25 2015 UTC,"Trilanes hurt exp in pubs because no one executes them properly. A well played trilane will zone out the offlaner until either they kill him or force him into a level disadvantage against the carry, at which time they can roam and put pressure on the lanes. Pubs often forget that it is the supports' job to gank, not necessarily the mids.  As to your question, trilane when you have supports that can zone out the offlaner to secure the carry's farm. A good example of this is SWM."
TrueDoTA2,392f3t,Sublixt,4,Mon Jun 8 20:01:19 2015 UTC,"People dont understand creating an advantage for the carry over the offlaner. 99/100 pub trilanes I encounter consist of the supports stealing 2-3 levels from me, rotating mid, then flaming me for not having farm or dying because I can't farm against the level 6 timber as a level 4 hero."
TrueDoTA2,392f3t,bravo_six,1 point,Mon Jun 8 22:44:42 2015 UTC,"Most of the pub trilanes are terrible and they lose the game. They don't know how to zone out the offlaner, they don't know when NOT TO PULL. I play carry or offlane 90% of the time and trilane is never good for me no matter which role I am that game.  As a carry player I'm not supposed to farm under my tower with trilane, never. And I'm not supposed to back out away from offlaner and he's is not supposed to harras me. They usually don't stack either.  As an solo offlaner I just can't count on supports at all through the first 20mns. I almost never get a tp from supports when enemy dives me under my tower, and 90% of my games as solo offlaner, I never have anyone from my team in my lane for the first 20mins."
TrueDoTA2,392f3t,goblinbiddin,3,Tue Jun 9 13:43:42 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, although this is a great question, it is backwards.  The safelane tri is designed to protect a carry in lane so he can freefarm and have his impact as soon as possible, which is what most teams want their carry to do, so the more appropriate question may be: When should you NOT go tri lane, and there are certainly situations where that's the case.  A quick example is this: Your offlaner cannot challenge the farm of the opposing carry by himself against a trilane, and you don't like your chances in a freefarm trade between your carry and theirs. In this case, it often makes sense to run that aggro dual, as this forces them to fight you for the lanes, and not just trade freefarm.  As for being hurt by having trilane XP, it sounds like people are just staying in the trilane for too long. If you like, you should take a look at my ""Thoughts on Laning"" which covers ways to get supports caught up after running a standard safelane tri, as this is important."
TrueDoTA2,392f3t,Drop_,3,Mon Jun 8 22:25:20 2015 UTC,"I think we're going to see more and more 212 setups.  Trilanes can still be really good, but it's got to be a really dominant trilane.    What /u/Axosh posted is a fantastic primer on trilanes.  But I would say he left out one other factor on the weakness of trilanes - you are potentially allowing complete free-farm for their carry.    So if you're in a situation where their carry is a PL and your carry is something sub-par for a carry like Dragon Knight, it suddenly becomes a huge risk to trilane defensively.   Though aggro trilanes are a way to switch this up, they are even higher risk and require better coordination, and usually you can get better results by simply running a 212 and having a support rotate top with a smoke.    I say generally you should trilane when you have a better lategame carry who isn't as good at recoverying (e.g. something like medusa), and you know that with your trilane picks you can deal with the enemy's offlane.  There is no point in going trilane if their solo or duo offlane is still going to bully you, and in fact it can be a huge disadvantage against some heroes (e.g. Broodmother) - if you end up at a level disadvantage without being able to kill brood, suddenly she can just run down the supports with her spiderlings. Leaving the carry to fend for himself.  Disaster."

TrueDoTA2,392qcp,wakek3k3,3,Mon Jun 8 20:49:07 2015 UTC,"IMO, Doom mid isn't great, but here are my thoughts:   There are going to be times when either a Stick/Wand and/or Shield is core, based on the match-up. Always consider those as options based on who you are facing. I would skip the Arcane Boots in favor of a Bottle. Bottle should give you adequate mana regen. You will need to master the art of creep equilibrium. You don't have any really great AOE abilities to push quickly, so you'll need to respond to your opponent's potential push attempts and counter them quickly. A Ring of Basilius would probably be core here too, but now you're looking at a lot of ""small"" mana fixes that compromise slot efficiency.   Doom mid should be built as a utility disabler. That means items like Abyssal, Scythe, and/or Silver Edge should all be considered based on the opponent's line-up. Your items should vary drastically based on the line-up, so make sure you understand itemization and all the different counters on hand.  Once you get your 6 you want to use your ult to win one of your side lanes, as mid will probably not be in your favor. You will likely need to TP/smoke for it to succeed. I would only use it on mid if your side lanes are actually doing pretty ok, or if mid is actually their best late game.  Doom mid is a similar principle to Timbersaw mid: you should draft it when the disruption to your opponent provided would exceed what a ""better"" farming mid would accomplish.  What kind of creeps are you looking to score in mid? Some early considerations could be the Troll for a ""ranged"" disable, and the ability to push quickly when they bail lane, or stack for you to potentially eat a Wildkin and get mad farm later (plus a decent pushing aura). Alternatively the Satyr would provide 8 HP regen (IIRC) or the Priest for a pretty decent mana aura (this would be really nice if you wind-up versus an OD). Centaur can provide a critical stun if you're rushing a Blink or SB. The one minor Satyr with the Purge can be situationally key if you're looking to gank someone like an Omniknight. I would not get the Wolf early on. Lastly, maybe that Lightning Harpy for some sick midlane harass, but you'll probably need to stock up on Mangoes to get your money's worth which would only be worth it if you're in a pinch and desperate from some XP (which mid Doom should really not be having an issue with)."

On the positive side, you are crazy strong when the enemy is level 5 and you have level 1 lvl death.  Maybe you can win the lane at level 5.  You can eat the ranged creep to help push out for runes.

Then the item progression builds like an agility carry to maintain attackspeed and decent damage. This works against (in my experience) all carries that dont have EXTREME mobility such as AM, Weaver, possibly PA and Morph (if his spells are on cooldown he's toast).

My current favored build is phase boots into sange and yasha; the ability to chase is so good on him. If you have a trustworthy initiation, you can try your luck with a less chase-focused build, but I really have been having a much better time forgoing treads and going phase into yasha.  You take levels in hos slow as you need the range it gives for early slows, I usually leave it at level three then start maxing rage. I always max feast first, its why hes such a good laner. His autoattacks will always do significant damage due to feast, and if you can hit their hero in lane, or if you're laning against melee heroes, you should have an alright time.  Lifestealer is very strong in lane, and is mostly countered by heroes that dont let him hit them. If you know the enemy team will have a pudge or ember spirit mid, take lifestealer mid vs them for a good time. Grab orb of venom too.  After sange and yasha I usually go for attack speed then a basher, or go straight for a desolator if its early enough to justify the purchase.   I havent done this, but honestly, the only way I'd skip buying movespeed items on life is if I rushed an early blink or had initiation that I trusted, like a storm/blink infest combo. Otherwise, phase yasha for all my days.  Drums fits the theme, but I don't really need it for anything. SnY is enough cheap stats imo"

TrueDoTA2,391j4a,ThePerpetualGamer,7,Mon Jun 8 15:59:13 2015 UTC,"Earthshaker is viable, of course. He is a good 4, and can be a decent 3 (2 shaker seems rather silly to me, but i have seen it work). The problem is he isn't amazing at zoning or harassing, and his laning phase impact mostly involves protecting people from ganks. \  I like him quite a bit in the 2-2-1 (dual mid, solo offlane) setup to protect your mid and stack up a hard camp for either the mid or just himself to fissure or even ES down to get his blink. For a traditional support (trilane or aggro dual), he's pretty far down on the list IMO.  Some things to keep in mind if you run an ES support (still imo his best role): Get him some room to farm before the laning phase is over. Have the offlaner or even safelaner rotate into the jungle and give him some last hits, when you go gank as the mid, let him know, and have him grab a bit of farm in mid. He needs that blink and the earlier he gets it the better of you'll be as a team.  This also means your other support will be extremely poor (at least until he gets his blink), and needs to be strong in lane to make up for ES's deficiencies. Some heroes fit this bill just fine (skywrath is a good option, for instance) but if you pick a shaker, your team works a little differently than other teams, and you need to plan accordingly.  So in answer: Yes, he is viable, yes his impact is high enough (especially post blink), Yes he can be justified over other supports (if the rest of your team can handle the early game strain of running an ES support.) Just keep his weaknesses in mind and make sure your team does as well."
TrueDoTA2,391j4a,goblinbiddin,2,Mon Jun 8 18:38:29 2015 UTC,"Thanks for taking the time to write up that response. I've never tried the 2-2-1 setup you mentioned, probably because I'm well below the reddit 7k standard. It definitely seems like something that would work well with someone like Shadow Fiend who wants those early stacks. The problem with Shaker in pubs in my opinion is that pubs don't understand the concept of two supports. So, many times if I play Earthshaker, our team doesn't have many wards on the map until after the blink. Then they die because of bad map awareness (something I'm guilty of as well) and blame it on no wards. Any suggestions to alleviate this problem?"
TrueDoTA2,391j4a,kwanzhu,3,Mon Jun 8 19:56:50 2015 UTC,"Shaker is my most played hero and my way of playing him is extremely aggressive. It is so easy to set up kills in the safe lane its ridiculous. That's usually how i get my gold. Always be there to save your 1-2 with tp but in the mean time be setting up ganks from the fog. Never tp to a lane to gank always walk. Have a mango, especially when you get lvl 3, for more kill potential.:  But my number one tip for playing es in the trench tier is always tell your team you want solo off but don't demand it. It doesn't matter if you get solo or not, what matters is that other people think you aren't willing to support (which of course is wrong). Someone else will pick one up. This frees you to be aggressive, and move around setting up kills. Have fun slammin!"
TrueDoTA2,391j4a,goblinbiddin,2,Mon Jun 8 21:42:32 2015 UTC,"Euhm... well i mean, it's something i struggle with as well, as do many players, but bad team mates usually means bad opponents. Look for opportunities to punish mistakes, because both sides will be making them.  2-2-1 with ES/SF mid is actually one of the best ways to run the 2-2-1, as, like you said, SF likes the stacks, and also ES can protect him from dives and ganks, which are a serious weakness of SF.  People die from poor map awareness at all levels of play. Map awareness is a VERY difficult skill. Communicate with your teammates as well as you can (without raging, because we want to win games) to not only prevent them from dying to ganks, but to help your team set up ganks that your opponents will likely react just as poorly to as your teammates do (I think i split three infinitives in that sentence...)  Whenever someone asks for advice on teammates, i tell them (and myself, because i know it can be hard sometimes) to look to their own play, and see what they could have done better. Usually, especially on supports, if you feel like the game has gotten to a point where you can't do anything, watch the replay and try to see opportunities where you could have done something earlier in the game.  ES in general, like i mentioned, is a different support hero than others, and people have a poor understanding of how to play him and play with him. He is a difficult hero to make an impact with early on, and because of this, figuring out clever ways to do so is ESSENTIAL to playing him well.  Thanks for taking the time to read my response!

Take a look at the recent pro tournament on Dotabuff and look at the Bans when SF is picked, in most games you will see QoP/Lesh/Viper as priority bans as they all have favourable match-ups. Also Wisp+Tiny mid is horrendous for SF, if supports don't come to babysit him, he gets totally destroyed in lane. Also a spirit breaker offlane who gets early levels can make mid SF life terrible if your mid has early burst like a Lina. Speaking of which Lina does OK against SF.   One other option is a hero that just wants a few level before roaming and doesn't need the farm as badly. Pudge is a good example and SF has to be careful about clearing a whole wave with raze as he opens up for hooks.  Full Disclosure: I don't play mid normally, I do however play the 5 role pretty damn often and I known when I am going to have to gank mid often to help against an SF or when i can leave mid alone because  the matchup is terrible for him."
TrueDoTA2,3903c5,greenhatman99,3,Mon Jun 8 07:35:01 2015 UTC,"Uhh qop actually is a toss up between equally and decently skilled opponents. QoP has to get close to the wave to do anything to sf and is unbelievably squishy, sf needs to play it relatively safe until level 3 at which point he positions himself to hit qop anytime she moves in and 2 nukes from sf is enough to make qop wish she had stayed on her side of the river.  I am fairly familiar with this matchup in the 4k bracket but you are probably accurate in that qop is easier to play in this matchup and defaults to winning if the sf has no idea how to play the matchup. Just wanted to point out sf should learn how to play it as he can easily win the matchup just by having some balls and not being afraid to use his e."
TrueDoTA2,3903c5,kslidz,1 point,Mon Jun 8 13:44:28 2015 UTC,Qop can blink right next to sf and he can't do much about it except hit her with a single raze.

TrueDoTA2,3903c5,kslidz,2,Mon Jun 8 18:31:21 2015 UTC,"I am not great, 2500 mmr, but SF is always my go to against viper.  Viper wins the first couple waves CS battle but with a few souls SF can contest.  Once SF can raze the wave Viper has a hard time since he has no wave clearing abilities.  So Viper can't leave the lane to gank or get runes without sacrificing mid tower.  SF is stronger late game and forces Viper to stay in lane when he is relatively stronger."
TrueDoTA2,3903c5,calky,2,Mon Jun 8 14:09:54 2015 UTC,Viper can zone him out if the creeps are anywhere near the middle of the river. Any harass traded will favor viper from the corrosive armor + viper strike and the added nethertoxin damage acts very similarly to sf's souls.
TrueDoTA2,3903c5,orgodemir,1 point,Mon Jun 8 23:17:30 2015 UTC,Yeah I get why the first few minutes favor Viper and it will be hard for SF to get his first few souls.  But Viper wins his lane early against everyone.  Viper does not have good creep clearing abilities and SF can push the lane hard with raises forcing Viper to stick around to defend tower and gives SF easy access to runes.  In my experience SF does better than most heroes against a Viper.

TrueDoTA2,3903c5,Firtree8,13,Mon Jun 8 13:07:26 2015 UTC,"I play a lot of SF and there's a couple of heroes that I struggle with.  1 is probably Leshrac. Lightning spam is just unsustainable which leaves you with using razes for farm.  A well played TA doesn't care too much about your razes and with a good rune she just kills you.  Viper is obviously horrible for you.  Exort Invoker also reks you too if played well.  However, unless you get ganked a lot, you are never gonna be shut down completely. Worst case scenario is that you get almost no CS in lane but then you can just concentrate on stacking camps (you can stack two camps at the same time on Dire) and farming them after a couple of minutes.  A lot of people say that you can dominate SF if you make sure he does not get any CS in the first couple of waves. This is only partially true as you can always use your razes to CS a couple of creeps after Level 3 (get one point in Souls and two in Razes) to catch up."
TrueDoTA2,3903c5,DasFroDo,1 point,Mon Jun 8 14:07:22 2015 UTC,"Exort Invoker, that makes sense. I'm far from an INvoker palyer, so that didn't come to mind.  It's true that SF does catchup once he has razes, even if you deny his first wave or more. But At that point, he's going to catchup and that wave if your only chance of dominating and free farm.   Puck for example will probably lose the matchup if he doesn't deny SF and can kill SF early too. I'm guessing QOP can too, but the obvious risk is level 2 razes do so much damage that going aggressive can leave you in a weird right click war.   I just had this idea and I'm typing here, but what about Tinker? He's a strong laner and has similar push and huge kill potential and blind can make raze trades if you end up in a right click war."
TrueDoTA2,3903c5,AbareKiller,3,Mon Jun 8 08:03:53 2015 UTC,"Raze push out better than March pre rearm spam. Laser Rocket tinker can do ok, but then if you don't snowball the SF will outfarm you hard in the jungle.  QoP's strength is level 1-3 domination with dagger, and the kill potential at 6-7. A couple of right clicks and SF is dead to scream + sonic"
TrueDoTA2,3903c5,BuffKunkka,9,Mon Jun 8 08:10:27 2015 UTC,One key thing when facing an SF mid is to gank him. If you have a support who can roam on mid early (for example Lion w/smoke) then your own mid can be anything so long as they can contribute slow/stun/nuke to the gank.  If you haven't picked roaming supports then you should either be focused on winning other lanes really hard or you should have drafted differently.   But if you want to just pick a hero that shits on SF without help then just consider any lane dominator. I've personally played a lot of storm and found the matchup to favour storm. You can get your own last hits easily enough with remnant and overload (or use overload to harass) and at 6 storm 100% can kill the SF.
TrueDoTA2,3903c5,mriswith-,3,Mon Jun 8 08:27:16 2015 UTC,"You have to understand when SF is weak and when he is strong to lane effectively against him. Players who get owned by SF typically don't realize this.   SF is insanely weak and feeble at level 1 and 2. You have to take maximum advantage of this, get all the CS and as many denies as you can before he hits 3. You should have your bottle and depending on what your starting items were, good headway towards boots when he hits level 3.   Levels 3-5 SF is more powerful than almost every other laner. His nukes hit hard and zone you out of the wave, and he stacks up the souls because you can't deny him anymore.   Levels 6 onwards depends on your hero. Most of the common mids get a big power spike here (qop/storm/lina/etc) and should try to kill the SF right at 6. This is lane defining and if successful will make keeping SF down a lot easier.   TLDR; aggressive and maximum attention to cs levels 1-2, cautious levels 3-5, instant kill lvl 6 is how you lane against SF. Regardless of which hero you pick, you need to be thinking about what the earliest timing is that you can kill SF as ultimately that's how you keep him down."
TrueDoTA2,3903c5,phob,2,Mon Jun 8 07:59:27 2015 UTC,"Yes, TA wrecks SF.  Start with wraith band (maybe 2 branches) and rush bottle.  Get 1st level in psi blades and harass the shit out of SF, meanwhile beating him in denying and lasthits.  The only way the TA vs. SF matchup goes well for SF is if he has supports rotating for him.  Once TA hits level 6 it's no longer safe for SF to even approach the creepwave to nuke it down; she can simply dive him and kill under tower with trap slow and meld."

(but let's be honest, who doesn't want to live dangerously). I'm in a pretty low MMR bracket (1500) and whenever I see a hero that is planning on farming in the jungle, I put ward priority there, and just keep tabs on when their health is low and gank early and often. It leads to more fights that can go 50/50 early on in the game, but if you keep the pressure up, more often than not, you'll end up being on top, and they are one hero down that's underfarmed/underleveled. And also since people in my MMR bracket love fighting like all the time, even more than getting farm, they will always come to help out on jungle ganks. Anyways I don't know how experienced you are, probably more so than me, but that's just my two cents, you probably knew about this anyway, I'm just bored at work!"
TrueDoTA2,3903c5,Endzior,1 point,Mon Jun 8 16:22:28 2015 UTC,"At that MMR people are not very likely to be stacking for themselves, let alone other stacking for them, so you might not even have to ward his jungle.  I think the main problem is at that MMR (I was there once) games are more decided by who makes more mistakes in teamfights since nobody farms well anyway. It doesn't matter that much if SF gets completely shut down if your team can't capitalize on that advantage. Also convincing people to gank mid is hard, and ideally a mid Bane or Shadow Demon wants a support to gank mid a few times as Bane/SD + 1 is more or less a guaranteed kill against an SF. You should also gank the sidelanes—neither of those heroes are farming mids—but it's important that you get a + 1 and kill SF mid several times to set him back on levels.  Though if you're up for some fun go mid with one of those heroes, win lane ridiculously hard and buy a dagon. Clowny, but you'll probably get a ton of kills with a 10 minute dagon at 1500 MMR. You'll eventually fall off hard if you can't win fast, but it's amusing while it lasts. Shadow Demon in particular takes some practice but if you're good with him you'll never lose a 1v1 matchup. Also at 1500 MMR nobody knows how Shadow Poison works, which is free kills all day."

Go for a plasma field and static link oriented build and just continually land that near max range plasma field on him and be sure to nail your runes to keep yourself spamming. If he ever tries to right click you (usually due to invis/haste rune) static link him and start manfighting.
TrueDoTA2,3903c5,thegrackdealer,1 point,Mon Jun 8 17:33:36 2015 UTC,"PA used to be a some-what decent counter to SF, since you can farm with dagger, and deal good harass to SF (dagger + blink, SF can only response with 1 raze)"
TrueDoTA2,3903c5,Dancatpro,1 point,Mon Jun 8 19:01:16 2015 UTC,Huskar kind of sucks to play against. His spears do work with SF early on.
TrueDoTA2,3903c5,Dancatpro,1 point,Mon Jun 8 22:12:09 2015 UTC,"That weirdly makes sense. He can go phase boots ( something I already did) and doesnt desperately need bottle.   SF can't kill huskar with razes, he needs to finish it with right clicks. If huskar just walks up to sf's high ground he can orb walk trade with him."
TrueDoTA2,3903c5,punriffer5,2,Tue Jun 9 03:53:43 2015 UTC,"Huskar can also just dive the tower with SF and die while getting a kill with the burning spears if you decide your ultimate goal is to just stall the SF.  If SF is dying, he is dropping all his souls and having a bad time.  Also Huskar doesn't have the best base damage, so he can't out last hit SF very well. He has to go very aggressive to win the matchup."
TrueDoTA2,3903c5,Dancatpro,1 point,Tue Jun 9 04:08:10 2015 UTC,"He can outlast hit him if you kill him though.  Not sure about what happens if Huskar kills SF first but does to tower/creeps if SF gets souls.   SF definitely gets full almost souls from hero kills though if I'm not mistaken, so if you die first, you're kind of just feeding."

As in, get a high ground ward mid and start wreck him with the small base damage difference and snowball your lane from there. Played properly, SF has to make jungle stacks, and that's coincidentally when you gank and kill him again."

I'm assuming you're going net/poof/clone.   SF has 513hp without stats, +16% EHP vs phsyical. 320 magic damage = 240 real damage.   Net, double poof, net. He has 377*1.16 = 317EHP after poof  2 meepos, 46 lvl3 damage, (317/46)/2 = 3.44 rounds of hits. So you need to get 7 attacks off with meepo, on top of the dbl poof.   meepo swings at ~1.25/1.7 a/s. .73 attacks per second. To get off 4 rounds of attacks, it'll take ~5.4 seconds. 4 seconds if the creeps help out and you only need 3 waves of attacks.   In most cases i feel I can maim a SF. Leaving him at <100 hp, that is if he doesn't turn and kill me. (If he gets 2 razes on my approach i'm dead). What's the trick to finish him off?"
TrueDoTA2,3903c5,oneslowdance,-1,Mon Jun 8 11:54:00 2015 UTC,"Boots first, body block with meepos, harass him with auto attacks before going for the kill (still 100-0 as you;re not backing off), maximise net time, don't overlap the nets, cancel raze animation with net"
TrueDoTA2,3903c5,mjjdota,0,Mon Jun 8 20:59:08 2015 UTC,"He wins the auto attack war though. How many auto attacks does he get off, even netted, before you can approach him? Also it's not 100-0 if you have to harass first. I did math on it, and of course you do win if you start in melee with him, obviously, but i don't see the real world application of it :/ Do you have any videos to show a demonstration of equal skilled people, hell unequal skilled 100-0 would be useful."

There is already pretty limited space (e.g. the UI takes up like 1/3 your screen to begin with, there is limited space for streamers/sponsors to put their own graphics on screen) If you add scrolling inventories or something like that, the UI becomes less usable.  Six is also consistent across everything, so interfaces are reusable and familiar (which is just generally good design)     the fact that you can't drop an allies' non-sharable item from the courier   You can tell it to return items to Stash and it will put them in their respective player's stash. Courier has to be in base for that part to work, but it does free up courier space.

It will give you constant vision of the pit.  Otherwise I just use the closest tree's to your typical ward spots for where you need vision and the jungle/lane positions you have already covered.  Be mindful with this tactic. I really don't think it's worth obsessing over unless the enemy team has no way to conventionally get rid of tree's (i.e - they're force to buy and hold a QB). I still think it's a decent aghs but it's a bit of a gimmick."

Spam it as much as possible, sure there are some nice hill spots but quantity is better than quality with it. Typically the enemy team only has one way to clear them, and having a hero carry both a gem and qb all game means that's two item slots they can't use for fighting. And typically it has to go on a core, because a support can get picked (due to vision) and the gem stolen."
TrueDoTA2,38zj9f,goblinbiddin,6,Mon Jun 8 03:52:20 2015 UTC,"It is probably a better investment to put the 2k gold into cheap stat items or mobility items like blink and force staff, which increases the chances of winning the next big teamfight if the other team go highground. With kills being worth so much especially when already behind, I think that is a better use of the gold rather than the midas. The only situation I'd consider midas is if you are behind but somehow know that the other team won't push highground for a long time"
TrueDoTA2,38zj9f,Phorky12,1 point,Mon Jun 8 04:38:37 2015 UTC,"The ""rubber banding"" nerfs in 6.84 may actually make midas a better choice than it used to be for supports when behind, as winning 1 big fight doesn't give you the kind of advantage that it used to, and you need to be able to win the fight after that, and the one after that.  Trying to get as strong as you can immediately is a common thing to do when behind, and it has its merits, but the problem is, if you end up losing that next big fight, the game is as good as over."
TrueDoTA2,38zj9f,Lazarous86,13,Mon Jun 8 17:20:20 2015 UTC,"You are probably behind because your two supports went midas instead of support items like wards, TPs, and smokes.  This is bad idea.   I am not saying going midas is never an option. I have done it when my early ganking is successful and before I knew it I had 2.5k gold. So I got all the wards and midas at like 11 minutes. It does work well, but shouldn't be the plan from the start."
TrueDoTA2,38zj9f,greenhatman99,5,Mon Jun 8 04:32:15 2015 UTC,"If you're going midas as a reaction to being behind, then it's not the cause of being behind. Supports need to buy wards, and i never said to stop, in fact i specifically mentioned that at least 1 or 2 wards need to stay on the map at a time.  Some supports actually can plan on going midas from the start, the issue is that they need to be prepared to abandon that plan if it's clear it's not happening, and also be prepared to have the midas at like 20-25 minutes and be ok with that, that, however, is not what i'm talking about here."
TrueDoTA2,38zj9f,SepthSilver,5,Mon Jun 8 17:23:26 2015 UTC,"Right time for the when to Midas discussion. Midas is a timing item it take roughly 10 minutes to pay for itself in gold but give a pretty hefty XP bump, which is pretty good if that is what you need because you are stuck in base or not involved in fights etc (AA i'm looking at you) and is usually the item you want/need to get you from level 11-16 faster than the other team. However, if the hero doesn't benefit from attack speed then the value of midas is minimal if your hero becomes a dead weight for 10 minutes! In 6.84c more than half of my losses have been down to a core or jungler going midas when they shouldn't. More importantly supports should ALWAYS be warding. I have bought smoke just to get wards into my jungle so our carries could get something. 100 for smoke + 150 for obs + 200 for sentries - 450 on a poor behind support is doing more for your team than trying to farm a midas.  PS: As a support if I see Midas on the enemy team and can judge their current strength as weak I encourage the 5 man push and take every outside tower and probably a lane of Rax by the time the Midas is ""online"""
TrueDoTA2,38zj9f,Ukgamer66,3,Mon Jun 8 07:19:50 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind we're talking about a support here, so the XP bump is huge, and our hero was likely picked because of the amount of impact we can have with little to no farm, so it isn't as if going midas will make us useless."

IMPORTANT PART: DISENGAGE.  Immediately get back to safety, take that small amount of gold and Xp and do something useful with it.  Too often do teams stick around trying for a wipe with half mana and skill on cd when the other three heroes come in and wreck or worse, the team waits so long it becomes a 5v5.  Take some easy targets and win back the game gradually. If you are that far behind a single wipe of their team won't make the difference.  Keep Rosh warded (inc sents). A surprise Rosh swipe may turn the tide, especially if they wipe and you take it.  You also (as a support) should be keeping an eye on your teams farm compared to theirs and suggesting when to group up for objectives.  Too often people pick up a Spectre or a Alchemist and get ""farm vision"" and forget they can get a lot more gold with some well timed kills. Get them out of the jungle and into the game.   Lastly, never underestimate Medallion. If you are struggling to survive long enough in team fights to be useful then buy this, cast it on their biggest hero, watch the game turn around."

Sure, Aghs for everyone without using a slot sounds crazy cool, but the tradeoff is having something as utterly useless as him on the team.

I'd recommend not touching the hero in serious environments until he gets a rework/buff...."
TrueDoTA2,38wds2,AngelDarkened,5,Sun Jun 7 14:15:43 2015 UTC,"He just got increadibly overnerfed. I used to play this hero a lot and I really liked him but I agree: Right now he's just trash.  I've had games where I was three items ahead and still couldn't win fights. You're squishy, your armor is low and you get kited to fucking hell.  I do not disagree that he needed nerfs but ultimately it was just too much. The night vision reduction killed him.

TrueDoTA2,38wds2,DasFroDo,5,Sun Jun 7 20:06:41 2015 UTC,"He's pretty bad as a mid. He works well in some circumstances as a safelane carry or greedy position 4 support.  As a carry he works well if and only if you are completely uncontested. If they have an offensive trilane or a strong dual lane then you're not going to have a good time. If you can get free farm and keep their offlaner away from xp range then you'll have a great time with early levels in greevils greed.  If you need a greedy support who can initiate well and farm quickly then Alch can do well in that position, especially if you have a hero on the team that would love a free aghs like leshrac. Get stun at lvl 1 and level up greevils greed, go between stacking and pulling and ganking your lane or mid with a smoke.  In both cases you want to fill up your slots before buying other people aghanims. This means that if you're carry then you build battlefury, get fighting items like SnY, shadow blade, abyssal and heart then farm up those aghanims. If you're playing support then I like to get cheap items that are useful for farming and fighting like medallion, stout/pms, basi and wand and then farm up an aghs or two before building for lategame."

TrueDoTA2,38wds2,AbareKiller,5,Mon Jun 8 01:59:30 2015 UTC,"ITT: people that suck at alch. Alch is fine, maybe even good. He's risky as a carry but works well as a utility core and can function as a roaming support to start.  Get medallion asap and run around hitting people with 500 damage stuns.  Use acid spray to push, to farm jungle, and as area denial in fights. No one can sit in acid spray + medallion, -14 armor 2 stronk.  Buy items that your team needs. You can get halberd, meka, Vlad's, cheatstick, solar crest etc online very quickly even just farming only jungle and leaving lanes/ancients for team.  Alch has massive presence early game with 450 dmg unavoidable stuns and acid spray is like Weave on crack. Falls off midgame so use the space created by winning early fights and taking towers to farm items your team needs to win at 35, this can include buying agh's for a teammate.  Alch is probably not a top tier hero but he's still effective. People just play him wrong and especially draft wrong."
TrueDoTA2,38wds2,Thalnagath,2,Mon Jun 8 16:04:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah. I think he is great in the mid farm role. I think the build is treads, battlefury, silver edge. After that you can start getting what benefits your team most. May it be Bkb, AC, or an Scepter for your Witch Doctor or some other support that is amazing.   Power Rangers against alliance just ran a safe lane alchemy that had an offlane weaver. His first scepter went to weaver for the time lapse. It made their entire team hard to kill. Won the game because Alch got too big too fast."
TrueDoTA2,38wds2,Lazarous86,1 point,Mon Jun 8 16:22:11 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure why you'd go Bfury, honestly.  You already farm stacks really fast with acid spray and I'd think Maelstrom/Mjollnir gives you more bang for your buck, especially with Mjollnir's static shield and Alch's insane BAT during ult.  Lothar's into Silver Edge is kind of a given since Lothar's is so useful for Alch.  I personally feel that you need to draft a team that can take advantage of a free Agh's if you want Alch to be a good pick.  Tinker is probably my favorite choice because his Agh's is fucking insanely overpowered but is often overlooked because it's not an item that gets reset by Rearm (and many Tinkers go for a farm-focused build with March rather than lasers and missiles first.)  A Tinker with a fast Agh's is just devastating against a lot of lineups."
TrueDoTA2,38wds2,Thalnagath,3,Mon Jun 8 22:46:52 2015 UTC,Honestly it helps your damage increase substantially. You 3 or 4 shot most camps and farm without using mana. After you get the bfurry you don't need to use mana to farm. Just right click and pop your ultimate sometimes for big camps. When you start ancient stacking the mjollnir does nothing while the bfurry is just as good.
TrueDoTA2,38wds2,Lazarous86,2,Tue Jun 9 00:01:01 2015 UTC,"I still think he's quite weak but people need to know what his timing window is. If you're an Alch trying to get 6 slotted and aghs for your team before you take any objectives you will probably lose the game. He gets out carried hard by most of the typical carries in the game.  However, no one can farm as fast as him. I personally would like to see him in a early-mid game push line up. His ult gives him crazy sustain to stay healthy and spam acid spray and you can buy items like AC very early in order to strengthen your push.  People are definitely playing him wrong right now. He needs stat buffs in order to compete with the other carries and if he receives them he would be close to being too strong (depending on just how much of a buff if it is of course)."
TrueDoTA2,38wds2,Defiled-,2,Mon Jun 8 11:14:55 2015 UTC,"Beware, shit-tier MMR opinion ahead. Take with salt.  If you're dead set on playing him and not shitting up somebody's game, I think the ideal way to play Alch is to leverage greed to destroy an enemy with an abundance of farm, with a close second (and the more viable way) as a ganking greedy support with max spray and concoction.  However, I feel ok shitting up my friends' games with a semi-carry kind of build. I enjoy playing him mid and farming a fast armlet + blink dagger and just run around ganking/teamfighting. I don't rush midas, maelstrom or bfury. Post 6 and with an armlet you can play him a little bit like old alchemist ult. My skill build is usually 1?-1?-1 by 2, 1-1-2 by 4, 1-2-2-1, by 6, 1-4-2-1 by 8, and then max out spray and finally greed. I wrote about it more here  Starting items is typically stout + tango + QB into fast bottle. I find the QB to be pretty mandatory on Alchemist since it's the cheapest way of assuring out base-damaging an enemy mid. Games in which I've skipped it have been pretty sad. Mid game is bottle -> armlet-> Blink | PMS | Phase in some order that makes sense. I really think Armlet is an underrated Alch item in general since it synergizes so strongly with his ult, also that he's a strength hero, and it literally gives him all the stats he could want.  You should be playing very aggressively in your own lane once you finish your armlet + have 6 (6-8 minutes is doable with brown boots + bottle + some lucky rune spawns and a gank from your lovely supports), and in other lanes once you finish your blink. Your job is to charge stun, ult, armlet, blink, throw stun and spray and then whack on people while they're under stun + spray. This works better if you've got some other sources of minus armor + physical damage on your team (like a Dazzle, or a Venge).  After you have your core of blink + armlet, eventually completing your boots of choice, you should be making your own space rather than consuming it. Farm the parts of the map you're in since you're going to get the most out of it with your points in greed. If you don't foresee a fight happening in the next 45 seconds, spam your ult since it's great for sustain and farming speed. After this point you can buy whatever items you want.  The way I look at it is Alchemist farms more efficiently than any other carry in the game. Usually people look at it as ""get 6-slotted as fast as you can"", but I see it as ""I can farm for short bursts and otherwise fight constantly without falling behind in farm"".  The issue is you get outclassed by other mids too easily and your stat gain is awful for such a high-risk mid. Like, how do you lane as an Alch against a QoP? Or an SF? It's such a shit lane. But he really benefits from the solo experience, so I'm not really sure where else you'd put him for this style of play. And if the enemy has some annoying instant disable before you can get your ult off like hex, seal, or lift? It's pretty awful. However, if you can snowball a little off of kills it's a really fun way to play the hero. I think if a team were drafted around him falling off in mind it would be an ok way to play him without it being awful.  I saw VG.Hao went middle and got a fast mek which seems interesting to me. I don't know how it is in the latest iteration of 6.84. I rarely get the opportunity to play Alchemist because I have to convince my friends to let me play a fairly shit hero and I've been too busy to play as of late."
TrueDoTA2,38wds2,amttc,1 point,Mon Jun 8 19:30:56 2015 UTC,"I actually do quite well vs SF at mid. I get a bottle of the 0 min rune, then start to max acid spray and he just cannot come to lane."
TrueDoTA2,38wds2,Koolaidguy31415,2,Mon Jun 8 22:36:42 2015 UTC,"My friends and I play him in a five stack with a mid like Zeus or warlock that can rush refresher while being fed an aghs. On alch we put him safe lane normally tri with an off that has a good aghs like WR or centaur, sometimes void. Alch rushes radiance and in 3 minutes can farm an aghs with stacked camps.  It works quite well, never tried it in pubs.    You just have to make sure you can win off of that massive damage lead you have from a refresher aghs mid."
TrueDoTA2,38wds2,benji1the1dog,1 point,Sat Jun 13 01:00:10 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, the problem is that he just needs to much of the available exp and gold in 6.84 to be effective. Sure he can get an early six slot or 4 slot and a couple aghs but that kind of cripples any other farming your team would get.  I think if creep bounties hadn't have been reworked he would be much better.   I feel like the bounty rune giving 400 gold (I think?) was a band-aid approach that ultimately failed. In the end, he works like meepo taking farm but doesn't come online at any definitive point in the game as opposed to when meepo gets a blink/travels"
TrueDoTA2,38wds2,DasFroDo,2,Sun Jun 7 20:01:31 2015 UTC,"The problem with Alchemist, as I see it, is what he needs. He first of all, assuming they have burst which 90% of team compositions have, armor and HP. His statgain is just shit. If you don't fix your HP and Armor you just blow up. Then you need damage items because Alchemist on his own hits like a kitten. After that you need lockdown because your stun is incredibly unreliable.  In items that's AC, Heart/Skadi, Basher/Abyssal and maybe Shadowblade/Silveredge/Blink. That's basically what you need to start unless your team plays really well.  Farming is not a problem on the hero after Level 6. The problem is that you are almost useless unless you already have 2 - 3 expensive items. If you look at other carries that are popular you'll see that they don't need a lot to be a threat.  And if you can't finish after you're maxed (which is pretty fast in an ideal game) you're just gonna get outcarried."
TrueDoTA2,38wds2,non_clever_name,2,Sun Jun 7 21:28:22 2015 UTC,"On the other hand, he's the most space-to-farm efficient carry in the game. While he sucks a lot of farm, he's far more efficient than a Naga, Tinker, Terrorblade, Meepo, etc who more or less completely deprive their team. Alch can get comparable net worth to those heroes with far less space. The problem is that he needs way more than comparable net worth to be useful. He also can't create space for himself like those heroes, which may be a bigger problem."
TrueDoTA2,38wds2,wildtarget13,1 point,Mon Jun 8 03:48:20 2015 UTC,"It's been my nostalgia for a while, but what if we gave him his old stun back? Or made it scales better in a different way?  I feel like then the only thing that would've changed about the old Alch is the base HP vs higher HP regen."
TrueDoTA2,38wds2,Snoop_doge1,1 point,Mon Jun 8 00:07:10 2015 UTC,He is a trash hero. Dont bother picking him at all.
TrueDoTA2,38w759,ExtraRicey,6,Sun Jun 7 10:05:09 2015 UTC,"I usually march as the creeps arrive, which is around x:14 and x:44 in the mid lane. If I intend to get a rune I march at :44 and go to the rune; I lose out on exp but I get some of the gold still.  To take stacks with march, you will need rearm, bottle, and either a soul ring or bottle crowing (or both), although the last part depends on how much mana you have and how large the stacks are.  Yes, the CD is prohibitive until you get ultimate. For that reason, you don't really march with the intention of taking down stacks until then. However, if you are using match to stack neutrals, you'll naturally kill some over time. But you have to work out the timing on that; I haven't practiced it.  You need lvl 3 march to have a reasonable time in the jungle. Yes, I get a soul ring if I intend to farm outside of lane (which you usually do). You can stack the camps on your own, but I don't have any explicit timings memorized. Usually I either just march the lane and go stack or I'm against someone who kills the creeps quickly (SF, TA) in which case I can usually just go stack then come farm the creeps under my tower."
TrueDoTA2,38w759,vple,3,Sun Jun 7 10:15:10 2015 UTC,"This is good insight, discussing patterns backed by explanations that cover Tinker's strengths and limitations.  For the timings, here's a good guide:  Offtopic: I'm not sure how TA clears creeps in the same league as SF/Lina/Lesh. Care to enlighten?"
TrueDoTA2,38w759,PeenoyDoto,3,Sun Jun 7 14:02:38 2015 UTC,"She nukes a creep with Meld+Refract, using spill damage to take out the rest of the wave in the process. Not as fast as SF/Lina, who can just burst the wave down with 2 spells, but could be compared to Lesh."

TrueDoTA2,38w759,pepe_le_shoe,1 point,Mon Jun 8 02:00:44 2015 UTC,Yeah sorry it farms 3 camps but it doesnt stack the small one. You generally use the same spots to farm multiple camps as you do to stack them
TrueDoTA2,38w759,non_clever_name,1 point,Mon Jun 8 02:35:27 2015 UTC,"I don't like picking him on dire, because the jungle camps are too far away.   If I have to pick him on dire, I farm lane and rush bots first (after bottle), then go to the jungle and let a support or someone else farm mid. You can TP to the top lane creeps of the top T2 tower to jungle dire, but it's not optimal, and like I said, I generally won't pick him if I'm on dire.  On radiant, I go bottle, brown boots, soul ring, level march a little earlier, and rotate between farming lane normally, and marching in the spot that hits both mid lane jungle camps on radiant."
TrueDoTA2,38w759,tinkeringabout,1 point,Mon Jun 8 12:14:56 2015 UTC,On Dire it's slightly more mana intensive and I get rearm earlier. You have to push the wave out with march and then rearm and stack the camps. If you don't use march to push the wave behind their tower you'll miss a little too much xp since the camps are so far away.  I like him a little more safelane on Dire than mid overall though.
TrueDoTA2,38w759,pepe_le_shoe,1 point,Mon Jun 8 16:15:59 2015 UTC,Except that you can double stack both camps on Dire with March but you can't on Radiant. Dire Tinker is actually alright if you know what you're doing.
TrueDoTA2,38w759,tinkeringabout,1 point,Tue Jun 9 21:05:14 2015 UTC,"The problem is more that you leave a greater window for the opposing mid to free farm. When you're on radiant it doesn't take as long to leave the lane, march, then come back to the creep line."
TrueDoTA2,38w759,PSYOPPA,1 point,Wed Jun 10 05:56:21 2015 UTC,"Yes, I know what you mean. It's a difference of about 5~6 seconds every minute which adds up if you're going more than once.   For Radiant you can afford to leave the lane at 47 with Boots and still make it in time for the big camp stack, but for Dire you have to leave as early as 41 to make it work. Plus, stacking it requires you to walk even further away from the lane, so it's a bit of a stretch... Anyway I take back what I said about not being able to double stack on Radiant because I just tested it and turns out you can too."
TrueDoTA2,38w759,ThumperLovesValve,1 point,Wed Jun 10 06:37:12 2015 UTC,"By marching close to the rune spawn timings you can put the enemy in an awkward scenario. The wave will be pushing to their tower so they have to make the choice:  A. Contest rune and miss an entire wave of exp and gold  B. Get the exp and gold but don't get rune, have to bottle crow ect  March almost always gets an entire creep wave at later levels so you can just March and go rune knowing you are winning some sort of trade off with the enemy mid"
TrueDoTA2,38tmfu,elgskred,13,Sat Jun 6 18:37:59 2015 UTC,"Well I main support. So here is my 2c and dotabuff - http://www.dotabuff.com/players/64801692  I strongly advise Disruptor and Bane my dotabuff should give you an idea of how I itemise. Disruptor because he is strong from early game all the way to extreme late game and his aghs is just disgusting.   Bane because he is the support that people run away from. There are few supports I can think of that tick that box. He is REALLY strong in laning and if played well is superb in skirmishes - 2-4 hero engagements. Which occur a lot in this patch. I played him to get out of my comfort zone. Nightmare one - Fiends grip the other, instant fight won.  If you like dishing out huge damage try Lina - she seems to work well for a lot of people. I plan on giving her a go shortly. CM is good but falls off pretty hard as the game goes on but is situationally really strong.  And a special mention for Earthshaker. A) he is fun B) he can wreck face c) it requires a slightly different way of thinking to most supports in my opinion d) he really helps to set up ganks early and this patch rewards that. e) if it start to drag on he always stays relevant.  PS: Dazzle is pretty damn strong this patch. If you like that play style consider also Winter Wyvern and get a glimmer cape.  PPS: Wisp. I am going to man up and play this hero soon. Check out http://www.twitch.tv/mikushiru for 7k wisp plays and marvel."
TrueDoTA2,38tmfu,greenhatman99,1 point,Sat Jun 6 20:17:45 2015 UTC,"Can you talk to me about Disruptor? I love that hero but aren't massively experienced with it. At least, not since Dota 1.  You seem to max Thunder Strike, when I always thought you ALWAYS maxed glimpse. That's why you pick the hero, no?   You also seem to go Ags a lot. I always thought it would be far more situational."
TrueDoTA2,38tmfu,Rasket,1 point,Mon Jun 8 11:12:03 2015 UTC,"Well this patch Disruptor is really good because of how gank/kill heavy it is in the early game.  Now to explain the builds and items: In most game I get lumped with position 5 support. And there is no way a solo support can zone a dual offlane with right-clicks. Thunderstrike does a LOT of damage even with a few points in it, and can easily zone out at least the squishy in the dual lane. This give me time to stack/pull as necessary. I also often have to get a point in Thunderstrike early to secure a kill because there isn't enough damage coming out of my laning partner, in a trilane you will almost always skill glimpse first.  NOTE: Never skill with Disruptor until you have to, different lanes require different choices, I have skilled Kinetic Field at level 1 a few times against really bad offlane combos that are melee. Axe + Omni for example just to keep a carry alive. But i almost NEVER get to 7 without at least 2 points in glimpse. I like to have 2-2-1 at level 5. Then you need to decide if the team is going to rely on you landing the static storm/kinetic field combo + the glimpse to get them there, if so start skilling the field.  Now Aghs is a tough one, basically the build up allows you to tank up. Which is often a necessity, and it massively increases your damage output. But most importantly it stops BKB if you initiate. And BKB is the auto-counter to Disruptor. If nobody goes BKB early get Solar Crest asap - it help with mana, give you armour (EHP) and is another tool to help in team fights and secure rosh. You should own every teamfight until BKBs come out. These days I often go Arcanes --> Veil --> Aghs/Solar Crest depending on the matchup. This has been very successful in 6.84c because of the tendency of your teamates to pick nuking heroes AND the changes to veil - which make it almost perfect to thunderstrike + Veil a creepwave and a few last hits and now you can push a little and get some recovery farm to get you the aghs :p  Hope that helps. I think he is so strong right now I am scared he gets nerfed."
TrueDoTA2,38tmfu,greenhatman99,1 point,Mon Jun 8 23:33:55 2015 UTC,Changes to veil?
TrueDoTA2,38tmfu,musclenugget92,1 point,Tue Jun 9 10:04:12 2015 UTC,"A. It's cheaper. The CD is 20 second now and the active time is 16 so downtime is only 4 seconds and you can probably use it twice in fights and for using less mana and burning down creep waves faster.  B. And reduced mana costs means you can pick it up earlier and still have enough mana to ""do stuff""   From the wiki:  Magic Weakness cooldown reduced from 30 to 20 seconds. Magic weakness duration reduced from 20 to 16 seconds. Magic weakness mana cost reduced from 75 to 50 mana. Recipe cost reduced from 1250 to 1100.  PS: It builds out of null talisman which is useful by itself during the laning stage and the helm by itself is also good. I.e the buildup is easier and the individual items have good value. The HP regen is really good for sustain so you can maintain your activity on the map without having to retreat to base all the time."
TrueDoTA2,38tmfu,greenhatman99,1 point,Tue Jun 9 16:32:42 2015 UTC,I didn't realize thanks (: was that 6.84??
TrueDoTA2,38tmfu,musclenugget92,1 point,Tue Jun 9 21:01:26 2015 UTC,Yip. Been running it on a lot of my supports these days as the item after Arcanes if its a magic burst lineup. Really good fun in a Disruptor + ES support combo or that ever common Lesh core as he won't have the space for it.
TrueDoTA2,38tmfu,greenhatman99,6,Tue Jun 9 21:45:41 2015 UTC,"To pick in cm? Warlock. To play myself? Venge.  Warlock's 600 range and nuke/heal in lane are great for zoning or challenging a lane, and his ult is powerful in teamfights and then transitions in an easy and obvious way into taking objectives, which are more important than in 83.  As for why i pick venge for myself, it's mostly that i've played venge since around the time warlock was added to dota 1 :P But she also has a good stun and decent ability to zone and contest, while swap is a powerful ability to counterinitiate or pick off isolated enemies, wave's -armor is a powerful overall teamfight tool, and aura is a great way to help with (you guessed it) taking objectives!"
TrueDoTA2,38tmfu,goblinbiddin,5,Sat Jun 6 18:51:08 2015 UTC,"CM, aoe and slow with q, stun and jungling ability with w and mana regen for the whole team with e. Since this patch is more fighting orientated, spells will be cast more and your aura will be more efficient. Ultimate with glimmer cape is also very strong"
TrueDoTA2,38tmfu,dootdootskeleton,5,Sat Jun 6 19:11:06 2015 UTC,"People never seem to realize how devastating CM's ult can be. Had a match the other day where I picked her (for the aura since all our heroes were mana hungry) and just spammed the fuck out of her ult. I died a bunch as CM is wont to do but holy fuck it was so satisfying watching the standard pub stomper heroes get obliterated because they wouldn't focus on me. As an aside, I wish people understood that the perfect blink BKB ult all five enemy heroes almost never happens. Frostbite on their carry? Fuck it, have an ult. Ultimates are useless if you never cast them."
TrueDoTA2,38tmfu,Saarlak,2,Sun Jun 7 01:46:49 2015 UTC,Especially true with the cooldown reduction on the ult now. It's really worthwhile to draw aggro and attention during team fights even when suicidal
TrueDoTA2,38tmfu,cantadmittoposting,4,Mon Jun 8 14:45:51 2015 UTC,"Same as always, Lich. I have around 80% winrate with him. People just can't deal with being completely zoned out of lane in pubs, and lich can out harass even many dual lanes. Games are surprisingly easy to win when carries get uncontested freefarm. Also you get a fast 6 from sacrifice and you can usually find a free kill or two because they don't expect you to have your ult so early and they'll be really low if they're still in lane."
TrueDoTA2,38tmfu,Abismos,1 point,Sat Jun 6 21:05:16 2015 UTC,"I agree with this. Sacrifice is so great for slowly winning the lane and securing the xp you need. Lich is also one of those heroes that is pretty devastating mid game with high damage output and great sustain. You don't offer any real stuns though, so you need to be correct in your execution with the Ults. But a support that can have a very big impact."
TrueDoTA2,38tmfu,Lazarous86,1 point,Mon Jun 8 04:39:28 2015 UTC,"I used to play lich a lot, heck, he's still my favorite hero but lately I can't seem to get the same impact in a game as I did before. Yes, he kills the lane but since the patch is more fighting orientated, I like to play a support that gives me more control. My go-to hero has been lion. After you get lvl 2 you can sustain your mana and spam spikes. In a fight you might get a 2 man spike plus a hex, that gives your team time to turn on bkbs or focus a key enemy.  bane is also as good as always and I'm quite surprised more players don't go to him."
TrueDoTA2,38tmfu,beculet,4,Mon Jun 8 13:34:53 2015 UTC,"I haven't seen anyone say it, so my favorite support this patch has been Bounty Hunter. BH is a really good way to punish squishy early game heroes and when combined with a team with half-decent lockdown, can be devastating. And it's pubs, so a lot less people actually purchase detection, making it so easy to entirely take over the early game. A good example of this is a game played by Jerax recently, I don't remember who it was against, but if anyone has the VOD, please post it.  EDIT: Found it!

He's been silly as hell since they changed his ult to have a 4 second CD at all levels, he doesn't need anything except level 6 and maybe tranquil soul ring to be a serious force to be reckoned with.  With this patch (6.84) It's become even better, as it's highly unlikely you'll get a big lead off track gold early in the game and then get turtled out and outcarried, as the reduction of ""rubber banding"" means that being essentially a 4 core lineup (Just because of the silly amount of gold that BH himself gets off track in a game where you're not getting stomped lets him act as a semi carry even if he's got 30 last hits at 40 minutes.)   With the gold lead that this will generate, there's no reason to assume you won't be able to secure 3rd rosh, get aegis and cheese, break high ground and end the game no matter how many dusas snipers and gyros are on their team."

I think he's really strong right now as he enables heroes that aren't as aggressive as Queen of Pain or Spirit Breaker and give them more fuel to do things with.   Recall becomes really strong forms of regen w/ TPs and Mana Leak is really strong versus many heroes right now. He shouldn't mek anymore personally and I've always been on board with force staff first to make use of mana leak disable.   You just have to rely that your allies aren't blind edge panning players or players who don't click on the minimap to move their camera enough. You should communicate with them, but at some point realize which cores or heroes you can rely on.  Also, Abbadon has been really strong for me as it makes your greedy free kills and gank targets on your team much harder to kill. He also needs very few items and already has decent movespeed to move around the map without boots so you can consider getting wards/detection at 8 minutes if you still haven't completed tranquils or just brown boots.   He also is almost ungankable once you get a blink dagger, allowing you to aggressively ward for your team.

TrueDoTA2,38ur0j,TommyVeliky,7,Mon Jun 8 09:53:04 2015 UTC,"5k here - I think Pa's pushing abilities are far too weak for this to be viable compared to other heroes like AM. Also, Pa doesn't necessarily fall off compared to other heroes as they need to have to have 2 items just to catch up with Pa's passives. Whereas Pa can work on other items since she's already up in that regard."
TrueDoTA2,38ur0j,TommyVeliky,3,Sun Jun 7 02:17:35 2015 UTC,"if pa builds something like scythe she has the utility to be an excellent hard carry in ultra-late, but overall the best hard carries have unique abilities which can't be itemized don't they? stuff like sniper even, with range, troll warlord with early game evasion and bashes etc, fotm 'op' heroes have always had solid gimmicks which they relied on to win consistently with.  her pushing abilities aren't insane, but her with deso hits t1s very hard early, and with just deso bf and Vlad's she can tear through a t3 and a rax in well less than a minute, while also being able to contest and possibly kill or scare away anyone who comes to stop her, a trait very few rat heroes have.  this definitely isn't going to be good in the 4k+ bracket, unless you build a team with 4 heroes who have excellent counter push and the enemies never have tps or anything like spirit breaker or zeus which can seek you out, its utterly insane at the level which pa already does well in with not much farm though.  splitpush, evasion, crits etc are difficult to deal with for teams without good cohesion, combining them all, plus the fact that pa can push a whole side of a map without being noticed on the map is pretty damn solid."
TrueDoTA2,38ur0j,sintoras2,3,Sun Jun 7 02:32:26 2015 UTC,"I've been having a HUGE amount of success with Solar Crest PA in this meta, it's seriously good. 1-1-1 build into Crit>Dagger>Strike>Blur, build is to start with stout and regen, then Boots>PMS>Aquila>Drums(situational, try to skip)>Solar>BKB>Basher/S&Y. It's good mid since you have so much kill potential with just level 6, a medallion, and 4 non-crits on creeps, and it lets you fight super early and take rosh off the back of a fight. Blur takes nearly all of the sting off of the Solar active unless you're against a Bristle or something, you can blow up any support you see, and the Crest evasion helps a ton against the inevitable Silver Edge. It isn't a build for every game but it's really really great against a lot of lineups. 3k gold Solar Crest is pretty nasty, and with most supports who know what they're doing buying 30 minute Glimmers the early BKB charges are justified. If you get a fast medallion or go bottle for whatever reason you don't even need to upgrade your wraith band."
TrueDoTA2,38ur0j,Antisceptic,1 point,Sun Jun 7 19:04:23 2015 UTC,"solar crest pa is just evil to be honest, if you're planning on hitting enemies not towers it generally outclasses desolator in most ways because the extra evasion just isnt dealable before people have mkb on two heroes minimum, even when you only have a level in blur pre-11, overall desolator makes it much easier to just jump a target with your w giving them no time to react, and the tower damage is worth it considering the cost reduction."

The most important things to note are:   Dont pick her if the enemy lineup sucks too much for her, there are better picks which you need to determine while in that draft. Dont miss lasthits, ever, at all. A huge portion of the midlane is determined in the first (and maybe second) wave, so you better be the more skilled lasthitter with TA's superior damage and solid animation. Stack, stack, stack, stack the ancients. About that many times before you kill it. Recognize when you can kill enemies on the map relatively risk-free and do it when the opportunity arises. Kills catapult TA into the sweet one-shot territory where you can close the game.   Bonus: Traps; learn to place them beforehand and learn to activate them manually. My way is making a unit selection rectangle -> activate trap with q. -> F1 to return to hero control."

TrueDoTA2,38svtx,non_clever_name,1 point,Sun Jun 7 16:41:45 2015 UTC,"That might be worth trying, although I would assume blink allows for more kills in the 9-14 window where the entire map trembles before her power. I might be wrong though and I'll try it asap."
TrueDoTA2,38svtx,occz,1 point,Sun Jun 7 16:54:57 2015 UTC,"The reason I like deso first is if you go blink first you have to get kills. When you can outplay everyone like Waga does that's not too hard, but with deso you can do rosh, farm better, and wreck team fights. A 12 minute deso is really really potent. There is less solo killing though."
TrueDoTA2,38svtx,non_clever_name,1 point,Sun Jun 7 19:29:55 2015 UTC,"I honestly dont agree with your point about having to kill people with the blink. You should usually try, and you will probably be better off if you do, but the blink has excellent defensive capabilities on TA. On more than one occasion I've been able to save myself from a very bad position (stunned by a rotating support, impending doom and all that) by blinking away at my last defensive refraction charges. And as long as you can farm the deso by 17-20 minutes you should be fine.  Though I do suppose a deso first could push your general timings into even better territories, which could allow for the sweet spot I believe I've mentioned earlier in this thread. It's in the very least worth having as an alternative if the game goes completely south (bad dagger timing, good farm on everyone on enemy team allowing for no ganks etc.)"

He would get solo'd by the enemy Earthshaker.
TrueDoTA2,38svtx,HRP,2,Sat Jun 6 19:51:54 2015 UTC,"To be fair, although he's usually played as a support with his build centered around Echo Slam (Blink, Scepter, Veil, Refresher, maybe support items like Arcanes/Greaves or Pipe as necessary), ES is naturally durable, has an array of low cooldown stuns, and a guaranteed 500% damage hit. Tanky, disables, and burst damage? A core ES actually sounds like a pretty decent counter to Shadow Fiend, so long as he initiates and doesn't get surprised Requiem'd."

He's not a significant threat outside of teamfights (Lich cannot solo kill Meepo) and his ult is easier to work around than Earthshaker or Ember Spirit. As he lacks scaling burst damage he also can't deal with Meepo lategame.  Also Lich kinda just dies if Meepo just blink-poofs him midgame. Bonus points for hex and he can't even get an ult off.  Sven and Ember are far more annoying to deal with, Ember for obvious reasons and Sven with ult basically 3 shots a Meepo and is pretty hard to solo kill pre-hex (and even then if he lives through the hex Meepo pretty much has to net and run)."

I prefer to build Viper in more of a carry with items like S&Y and Silver Edge, and for WR I favor Orchid into Aghs. For SF, I feel like one of his biggest strengths is how ""mechanical"" his mid lane becomes if they don't apply any or enough early pressure—raze the waves, double-stack jungle camps at odd minutes and gain an overwhelming economic advantage against most other mids."

TrueDoTA2,38svtx,Ishmael_KingOfTheSea,3,Mon Jun 8 19:33:34 2015 UTC,I'm not sure why bloodstone first lina isn't the accepted mid build.   Phase boots are worthless if you can't cast spells to build up fiery soul stacks and aghs first isn't very good since your other spells pump out more damage in fights and you can only really one shot a CM or a Luna.  Bottle into Arcanes into Bloodstone into Blink wins games.
TrueDoTA2,38svtx,cilantro_avocado,1 point,Sun Jun 7 09:43:00 2015 UTC,"Bottle + Phase + Eul's gives lots of mana regen without sacrificing your right click damage. And it comes online faster than a Bloodstone (costs 1210g less, maybe 4 minutes?). The Eul's scepter mana cost nerf hurt other heroes, but not Lina since her int gain is very good. It's still amazing for the stun setup for solo pick offs.  The main benefit of Bloodstone is the additional HP. But it doesn't matter much if Lina can just kite everyone with superior move speed and range or blow them up solo in seconds with the Eul's combo. She don't need to be in the middle of everybody in a fight to do damage like Storm Spirit, Leshrac, or Timbersaw, so the HP isn't as critical. Maybe against strong long range gap closers/gankers it can help her survive. But unless they have BKB active or she is perma-disabled, Lina can Eul's and/or stun them and run away.  It certainly viable to go first item Bloodstone, but it has no synergy with her fiery soul buff which is a big part of the hero when played as a core. Like most things in Dota, its depends on the specific game and personal playstyle.  Aghs rush is just silly because you don't need a BKB-piercing pure nuke until the other team actually has BKBs. Maybe rush it if there's a Huskar who is snowballing."

PL relies on his high armor to mitigate damage.  You don't care about that.  He doesn't buy BKB.   Maybe if he gets heart or Skadi you start having trouble clearing the illusions (probably not though), but by that time you should have killed him many times over along with his team and probably won the game.

He does not have 7 base armor, its 5 first of all. Second, his flash farm requires him to put more points in Remnant, allowing you a window of opportunity vs his team.         Did you gank him in his jungle? yes, i killed him, and then the second time he just zips away.    Then don't just back up you fool. Pressure some lanes. A Storm with no mana is the most unhappy Storm you will ever see.   Did you play safe, but get raped BY him?   That's not playing safe is it? You can punish his aggression easy since if he balls in, he isn't going to have mana to ball out.   well gg, cos now the second u appear on map he can kill you again, and he will eat your jungle in 10 seconds too   Well if you show yourself on the map as a sub 1000 hp hero after seeing him snowballing, you're in for a world of hurt. Fog is a wonderful thing   Did you COMPLETELY OUTPLAY him, eat his jungle, take his towers, etc? well fuck that, all he has to do is wait a few mins for a perfect opening on your team's snowballer and now it's as if he was the snowballee. 0cs storm now has bloodstone at 22 mins.   Well he could've built proper shit like a Scythe and you could've lost from that point.    you bought orchid to counter?   Linkens / BKB is expensive if he's countering Orchid. Euls counters Orchid. But he doesn't have anything against heavier lockdown and more of it, so don't get lazy when countering Storm.  Hero isn't that broken to be completely fair. But whatever you say I guess."
TrueDoTA2,38urke,TheArchist,2,Sun Jun 7 14:50:57 2015 UTC,"Well, first of all, he has 5 base armour, not 7. And without items, he cant really flash farm jungle as well as other popular mids such as lesh, qop, sf, lina, ta. Large stacks do massive amounts of damage to him, and he has to rebase after stacks even with a bottle.  Literally, just slow down his item progression. Without orchid or bloodstone, he cant really kill most cores solo, and most supports can survive the burst long enough to stun him. The best way to counter him is the same as a pudge, put up some wards so he cant roam as effectively, play safe against him. Early game, storm has no chance tower diving even 1 hero on full hp never mind 2.  Don't feed him early kills, and his ""flash farm"" build weakens his ability to gank. If, after this, he still gets good gold by killing your farmed hero, it doesnt matter. A storm without a good start is not very effective late, and the longer you delay his orchid bloodstone the better. And I'm sorry, if you get an oblivion staff and don't finish an orchid before storm gets linkens, theres something wrong with your ability to farm. The difference in gold of those 2 items is huge, and any core should finish an orchid before that linkens comes out."

TrueDoTA2,38qsnf,sadgasm420,11,Sat Jun 6 00:56:54 2015 UTC,"Puck is primarily played as a highly mobile, elusive, initiator/counter initiator. She/he/it is a fairly strong laner with a decent amount of kill potential as well as hard to kill unless the player messes up or gets completely outplayed. Generally played in the mid lane, occasionally in the offlane as well.  Why would you pick it over QoP/other nukey mid heroes? Well, Puck offers a lot more control. What does QoP offer? Damage, and then more damage. Puck has a silence, a vision giving orb, and a fairly strong teamfight ability in its' ultimate. While Puck can do a decent amount of burst damage, it moreso fills the roles I mentioned previously.   Puck's strengths come in with his spells being powerful in their own right, him having high mobility and decent burst with just a few items. A good Puck player is near impossible to kill, and the itemization Pucks take heavily reflects this. Generally speaking, the build is starting items into bottle, boots, (treads) blink. After blink the most common pickup is euls. With euls, blink, and Pucks abilities its incredibly hard to lock it down, and becomes a huge pest for the enemy to deal with. You mention dagon, and its situational. Pucks may start with a null which makes the buildup easier, and it lends itself to a more burst/dmg oriented role which can be needed if your team lacks such (or doesn't lack the teamfight you can otherwise contribute).   Aghs is an item seeing some increase in popularity with its changes. Piercing BKB is pretty huge and often times unexpected in pubs, making it a very good item to get. Not necessarily first item, but still decent. Situational, of course. You can't really build him as good of a right clicker that QoP can be but he still can hit for a bit later in the game. He won't build anything like a maelstrom, but with his hex/euls/aghs/refresher, the int alone gives him some good damage.   Overall, if you're interested in understanding Puck I recommend you watch high level games with him in there. The hero has a really, really high skill cap. One of the most recent games I can remember him being incredibly utilized was DAC by EG.Fear, against Secret I believe. He really showcased the heroes strengths, and obviously he himself is an excellent player.  He's the kind of hero that requires a lot of practice and experience with in order to really utilize his strengths, so it makes sense that your one game hasn't really given you a good impression of him. Just watch and try, and you'll find out he's a super fun, impactful hero."

You really should focus on winning your lane, and failing that, maxing orb by 7 and pushing out lanes at X:43 and then stacking the neutral camps near you or securing runes.   Try to trade right clicks with your opponent and come on top with phase shifts. It is unlikely that you use phase shift between the laning phase, but get as many trades with it as you can. You can dive most heroes with just one level in orb and one level in phase shift.  You pretty much build him as a blink dagger initiator, and if you're mid, your level advantage makes your double nukes very potent, as well as your right clicks very relevant to your killing power.   If you are snwoballing, I find getting a dagon really limits you unless the enemy team has no teamfight at all. I find getting Orchid or Shivas or something to make you more formidable as a right clicker. Aghs is only good when you need to coil carries BEFORE they BKB. Usually pucks job late game is to silence and initiate on supports and blow them up.   Most of what I'm saying I stole from Chaq, but it's really what helps me think about puck all game.  Remember what spells you have to keep you alive. If you're stunned, you're dead. But you can dodge most projective stuns with phase shift. ""Phase Shift is your BKB"" make sure you don't phase shift if your blink dagger is on 3+ more seconds if you're dead when you come out. Try to get your orb off before you phase shift in most cases.   I've been spamming puck...mostly because I've figured out how to cliff jungle him reliably with few items when people pick more cores.   The best thing to do, as with many heroes, is too look at what can kill you on the enemy team. DO they have blink heroes with instant stuns like rubick. Do they have blink stuns you can dodge if you're really good like Ravage or centaur stomp (yes I know they're different). Are there silences on the enemy team and that you need Euls or Lotus orb for to remove? Are they things that damage you out of a weak phase shift? LIke timbersaw chakram or radiance DOT? If you are turning the right way, you can even avoid these, but sometimes we get sloppy or panic early phase shift and are still facing the enemy base."
TrueDoTA2,38qsnf,wildtarget13,3,Sat Jun 6 01:58:07 2015 UTC,"Not a huge fan of Puck at the moment, mainly Puck is good for winning mid and then setting up teamfights with blink -> silence -> coil for followup from teammates. He gets a lot of farm (flashfarming with nukes), and is a good candidate for picking up hex and cyclone later in the game.  The biggest reason to pick up a puck is that you need to be able to hold people in place and initiate from the mid position with a strong laner. Dream coil also has a fairly short cooldown, and blink silence from the fog remains effective at all stages of the game.  Most of the heroes that are traditionally good with a puck don't seem very exciting right now, (Things like jakiro, enigma, venomancer, kunkka) but there is a notable exception in witch doctor. If you blink in, silence and throw down a dream coil, a half decent witch doctor will think christmas came early.   You could consider running a puck if you can get a favorable mid matchup and a tanky carry like WK, and since you have a strong initiator mid, your offlane is free for something like bounty hunter, who is a very strong hero with the 4 second CD track, but suffers from a general desire for an offlaner with some tankiness and initiation power, and not being able to deliver in those areas.  Obviously, this is pretty narrow. As I said, i don't consider puck to be all that exciting at the moment.  Bottle -> blink are clear musts. Aghs is for magic immune targets and essentially nothing else. Dagon is fine but may not be as good as eul's or hex."
TrueDoTA2,38qsnf,goblinbiddin,1 point,Sat Jun 6 06:16:18 2015 UTC,"I think the thing about Puck is that he is probably the best mid laner for the first two levels and after that he can drop off really hard, especially against heroes like an SF with decent CS, Bristle, DK and a smart QoP. All of which are super popular picks right now."
TrueDoTA2,38qsnf,Ban-ath,2,Sun Jun 7 12:08:51 2015 UTC,"Puck is a strong mid tho (550 range, 52 damage, phase shift and orb are all great laning tools), can beat any of those heroes 1v1, if he's played well (which is obviously very difficult). He doesn't recover with jungle stacks that well, tho, and generally wants a lot of levels (you want 14 as quick as you can, because all your skills want to be maxxed!) They payoff just doesn't seem to be there right now, as this is a difficult hero to use mid, although he can win mid very hard when played well, but then he doesn't do enough after the lanes, as blink silence coil -> wait for followup isn't really what teams are looking for out of their mid right now.  Maybe we could revisit offlane puck with a recovery midas? Offlane puck was a thing a long time ago, maybe it could be again, block the pull camp, spam out orbs to get a few last hits and push the lane out, which will cause it to ping pong back under your tower for some farm, then with the recovery midas to get the levels and blink into hex or something (and aghs if people are getting bkbs, which they do frequently and early these days) maybe puck could be a pick again?  Remember to think outside the box!"
TrueDoTA2,38qsnf,goblinbiddin,1 point,Sun Jun 7 16:57:55 2015 UTC,"Puck was played offlane a fair bit in 6.83 with a pretty bad winrate IIRC. I'm not really a fan, he offers less than other blink initiators in the offlane and can't catch up in the jungle if he gets zoned out really hard."
TrueDoTA2,38qsnf,non_clever_name,1 point,Mon Jun 8 16:36:07 2015 UTC,"I'm only 2.3k, but I always get bottle, treads, then dagon. I generally stomp, unless they have really tanky heroes like Axe, Pudge, and Bristleback. Pudge really counters Puck, because rot stops you from using blink dagger, since you have to come back for a split second after phase shift. You can dodge hooks with shift, but if he gets the drop on you with blink you're dead."
TrueDoTA2,38qsnf,Monsieur_Skeltal,3,Sun Jun 7 04:23:22 2015 UTC,"You're playing it wrong against Pudge if you think he counters Puck. When you phase, the little stars that it leaves behind form an arrow and if you blink in the direction it's pointing you don't actually have to leave phase shift to blink. It's only if you decide to turn to blink out of phase. Pudge is actually one of the best heroes to play against as Puck since silence is a great counter to him, Orb isn't countered by rot and you will always destroy him in the lane. Euls, a common pickup, is also a great counter to Pudge as well. And I don't want to sound like a dick but you're wasting heaps of the hero's potential by constantly going Dagon. He's way, way, way better if you pick up (if you really think you need to)dagon after treads, blink, euls and situationally aghs; though I'm a fan of Aghs being core on puck for the 4.5s bkb piercing disable. I actually think dagon is a really rubbish item on Puck in most situations. It only really works if you're very far ahead because items that give stats and utility are much better. Using dagon sort of keeps you from having to learn how to position yourself to just be able to auto attack people down. Adding to that, orb, waning rift and coil are a great burst combo already."
TrueDoTA2,38qsnf,Ban-ath,1 point,Sun Jun 7 12:21:34 2015 UTC,"I'll stop getting dagon when I stop going godlike solely because I have it. As for the blink thing, that's really helpful. I didn't know that. Thanks!"

TrueDoTA2,38qsnf,pucklermuskau,0,Mon Jun 8 17:27:47 2015 UTC,"you can sometimes catch people off guard by orbing in after a wave clear. think siege situation. if you orb a few times to clear the creeps they might just assume the next one is the same and bunch up on it. Jaunt, silence, coil, and blink out after a phase if you need to."

If we already have an asston of carries and nukers, I'll go blink>euls>hex/linkens and then whatever. If we don't have enough dmg and/or I'm assraping mid, a lvl 3 dagon by 20 mins(with blink ofc) essentailly wins you the game cause until you fuck up, no ones gonna kill you, and you can pretty much blink silence coilorb out and then dagon from a safe distnace, this ones by far my favourite way to play. Also max orb 4 lyf, only decision I make is whether to skill orb or jaunt lvl 1."
TrueDoTA2,38q44r,SavageRS,13,Fri Jun 5 21:51:12 2015 UTC,"I mean, Drow already wrecks towers with just Manta + Agi/Damage items. Deso would be a good addition if you don't intend to go Satanic or MoM, both of which are pretty great on her. And since the Deso effect lasts for a decent amount of time, you can Frost Arrow - regular shot - Frost Arrow to slow someone and wreck their armor."
TrueDoTA2,38q44r,DangerAwar,4,Fri Jun 5 22:21:48 2015 UTC,I'd probably just go Skadi.  Skadi and Frost Arrows stack so you just alternate hits.  Skadi also plays nice with lifesteal.
TrueDoTA2,38q44r,Thalnagath,6,Sat Jun 6 05:18:07 2015 UTC,That was back when MoM was the go to build. I think deso definitely has a place for the mid game snowball for Drow. I agree though that Drow doesn't have sustain without lifesteal.  You could probably only run that build if you had someone on your team that could heal.
TrueDoTA2,38q44r,Lazarous86,1 point,Sat Jun 6 13:15:18 2015 UTC,Or just have someone vlad's. Same as the PA build I advocate. I just think you'd usually drow with the intention of abusing the aura and you need to stack agility for that.
TrueDoTA2,38q44r,Thalnagath,2,Sat Jun 6 13:50:32 2015 UTC,"Vlads + max Drow Aura is 51% bonus damage from agi. Level 3 ult alone would give 121 damage, a Butterfly would have its damage go from 60 to 75 (+25%) and Skadi is 25 -> 38. Seems like a great build."
TrueDoTA2,38q44r,subraizada3_,1 point,Sat Jun 6 23:02:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah but they're talking about Deso, not bfly or another AGI item (Manta Style would be closer to total value.)  I mean, Deso+Vlad's is honestly pretty OP right now on any hero that already gets a decent amount of damage from their baseline - PA, Drow, fucking Clinkz, probably even Sven and Leoric.  I think it's about one of the most balanced, most efficient general-purpose damage builds you can go for right now."
TrueDoTA2,38q44r,Thalnagath,2,Sun Jun 7 00:03:58 2015 UTC,"I think Skadi is actually a pretty underrated item on Drow; it's one of the few ways to slow down an opposing core through magic immunity when they BKB out of your silence. How do you think these two builds compare these days:   HotD and Shadow Blade. Stack Ancients as much as possible and go for your first big item, Butterfly or Skadi. Ideally, you'll get a BKB if needed somewhere around this point and break their base, but if the game goes late your inventory can grow into Butterfly, Satanic, Skadi, etc. and can upgrade to Silver Edge for Break and even more HP/slows. (Basically, the ""classic"" Drow build with SB/Silver Edge instead of a Crystalys/Daedalus and Skadi instead of Manta.) MoM and Blink. Cycle through the lane and the woods as fast as possible for your first big item, probably Butterfly (MKB + Skadi combo could be good here too) a la BurNing at DAC. Depending on the gamestate you could go base-breaking with BKB + Aegis or look for another item. MoM definitely feels weaker than before on this hero to me since the movespeed is very missed on Drow.   If you can get away with subbing in a Manta for BKB in a particular game, do it. Otherwise, Manta isn't that great for increasing your DPS against structures even now that your illusions get the bonus AGI. If it's a Diffusal game, the Diffusal + Manta combo actually seems to be well worth considering, but I haven't tried it very much."
TrueDoTA2,38q44r,Harlequeens,0,Sat Jun 6 15:27:23 2015 UTC,"I would never replace Buriza unless I really needed that Break mechanic.  Crystalys and Buriza are probably the most cost-efficient damage items in the game.  Not a fan of MoM+Blink.  Relies too much on not getting caught, and blinker is damned near worthless with how many heroes spam cheatstick now.  MoM is still situationally good but heroes with enormous burst like Lina, Lion, and QoP are trending right now which makes MoM extremely risky to consider."
TrueDoTA2,38q44r,Thalnagath,2,Sun Jun 7 00:19:06 2015 UTC,"I think the choice to build despite (on almost any hero) should come down to the timing of the item and the goal of the team. Trying to close early? Go for it, and make sure you're pushing. Think it's gonna go late? Maybe it's better to save your orb for a skadi and lifesteal."
TrueDoTA2,38q44r,ubermeatwad,2,Sat Jun 6 04:03:38 2015 UTC,"Personally, I think Deso on Drow is pretty legit but I already strongly feel Drow is best drafted in line-ups capable of fighting in the early and mid-game where her physical DPS is hard to handle—pick heroes that benefit from her aura, win your lanes and start taking objectives as a team. Vlad's + Deso Drow can do some serious work in such a lineup. There are more traditional, stable builds which are less front-loaded, but not unlike PA (another good AGI Vlad's + Deso candidate) I overwhelmingly prefer to win in the mid game with Drow as opposed to trying to outcarry the enemy in the late game."
TrueDoTA2,38q44r,Harlequeens,3,Fri Jun 5 22:46:39 2015 UTC,"Drow is similar to PA in that she's actually pretty weak later in the game and is most definitely a hero that reaches her apex in the midgame.  A Drow draft should be looking to end the game at 35 minutes, not 60 minutes."

That break helps me counter PA and void like never before and of course sniper.  It also allows me to skip satanic sometimes for hp reasons and also early / mid game victories.

TrueDoTA2,38q44r,Digitaldark,1 point,Fri Jun 5 22:22:03 2015 UTC,Hmm MoM 1800 is very effective at pushing... deso is cheap but not THAT cheap. Even vlads is more expensive (MoM is cost effective specifically because of the malus)... do you do run-up of any sort? Boot->RoA->Treads->? Or just rush deso?
TrueDoTA2,38q44r,cantadmittoposting,1 point,Sat Jun 6 00:07:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, thats the idea, deso as a core item instead of mom/dominator yasha. Deso cost = 3500 /  yasha+mom = 3850. I think that the +50 damage and -7 armor to towers/heroes is more cost efficient for doing damage than the mom-yasha combo. The only ""negative"" thing is that you dont have lifesteal for sustain in jungle."
TrueDoTA2,38q44r,AbareKiller,1 point,Sat Jun 6 01:35:21 2015 UTC,"You don't need lifesteal to jungle. You can just toggle frost arrow and kite. The bigger problem is the lack of MS to move around, and losing the ability to sustain against ancients, which is a big part of drow's farm"
TrueDoTA2,38q44r,cantadmittoposting,1 point,Sat Jun 6 02:29:28 2015 UTC,Well you should definitely bring the vlads into the build imo.
TrueDoTA2,38q44r,AbareKiller,1 point,Sat Jun 6 03:40:11 2015 UTC,"If you want Vlads for 5 manning, there are better Vlads carriers. Drow needs either MS for kiting and chasing and running away (hence MoM SnY build), or just tank up more (SnY + Skadi gives both). Lifesteal is just a bonus. The reason MoM is so good on Drow is that it gives her 3 things she needs/wants - DPS, MS and Lifesteal"
TrueDoTA2,38q44r,Harlequeens,1 point,Sat Jun 6 04:18:29 2015 UTC,"Vlad's + Deso is a different approach to Drow aimed at seizing her early game power-spike to kneecap the enemy before you have to worry about kiting them. Vlad's + Deso is a surprisingly potent early/mid-game package on Drow that starts with Vlad's. There's a significant difference between getting Vlad's on a support or something later in the game versus your Drow having it at seven or eight minutes. You push very hard very early. I originally got the idea from this sub and was pleasantly surprised by punishing it was as my the team pushed into the enemy's high ground with Aegis sub-20 minutes multiple times. It's not an every-game build, but the power-spike is explosive and well worth considering if the enemy has a weak lanes or a jungler."

TrueDoTA2,38ng5t,wildtarget13,12,Fri Jun 5 10:17:25 2015 UTC,"This definitely depends on the MMR bracket, but I don't think the best mek carriers are able to use mek right away.  Needing upgraded boots (1450), Urn (875), soul ring (800), bottle (700), and wand (465) to properly use mek (2300) seems like too many items to get mek in a timely fashion.  That's 4290 gold before the mek, totaling 6590 gold.  Compared to bloodstone rush: booties (450), bottle (700), stick (200), stout shield (250) -> bloodstone (4900) for a total of 6500.  Nearly identical price, but let's check out the DotA 2 calculator.  Assuming level 11, your build:  HP: 1252 (9/s)  Mana: 952 (4.3/s)  Armor: 8.32  EHP: 1877(phsyical), 1669(magical)  Bloodstone Rush:  HP: 1467 (10.5/s)  Mana: 985 (11.4/s)  Armor: 2.06  EHP: 1648(physical), 1956(magical)  If literally no one else can carry mek on your team, I guess Timbersaw can make it work.  But you can have a better snowball item for the same price, and your aggression is stronger with bloodstone because of better mana regen and more mana overall (since mek's manacost is so high).  edit: first line initially stated the opposite of the point I was trying to make."
TrueDoTA2,38ng5t,James_McNulty,3,Fri Jun 5 14:24:48 2015 UTC,"Mana: 952 (4.3/s)   If you include the actives from GG boots (3.6/s) and Soul Ring (5.0/s) there's a lot of potential mana in OP's build (12.9/s total).  Obviously you won't be using the actives every time they're off cooldown, but the potential is there."
TrueDoTA2,38ng5t,alexbarrett,1 point,Mon Jun 8 10:22:32 2015 UTC,"That assumes another 1650 gold item, the GG recipe.  For that price, you could buy Platemail, be most of the way to Blademail, or have a Perseverance (13.3/s) which builds into Lotus Orb.  Perseverance yields 15.5hp/s and 13.7m/s, more than GG build and with more useful buildup imo.  Plus if the point is to build Timber tanky for early engagements, factoring in Soul Ring's active hurts.  Either way, the main point of my post was that discussing ""early game"" Mek carriers which require 6500 gold isn't that practical, especially when you're 5-slotted until 8000 gold, when you complete GG.  Compare Dark Seer, Viper, Razor, Nec, or other popular Mek carriers: they usually go Mek right after boots or upgraded boots, and their kits either allow them to fight without much mana (Razor and Viper) or provide enough mana to use Mek and still be effective (DS and Nec)."
TrueDoTA2,38ng5t,James_McNulty,2,Mon Jun 8 14:21:05 2015 UTC,"Ah yes sorry, the title of this post being ""Guardian Greeves Timber"" threw me off. I see now you were talking about the build pre-greaves.  The Arcane Boots active is still an effective 2.45 mana/s, but of course that is offset by the large mana cost of using Mek."
TrueDoTA2,38ng5t,alexbarrett,1 point,Mon Jun 8 14:53:25 2015 UTC,"Ty for maths. I do agree with your point about not being about to have a mek timing and use it because you can't have the mana pool items to use it with yet at the same time.  I still feel it's strong. I didn't even mention the silence removal/purge which really helps Timber, something Bloodstone builds can't boast. Also, Bloodstone doesn't help your team unless you die. Your first two volleys of spells probabyl are the same. It's probably bloodstone that lets you use the third volley off spells without having no mana to escape. But at that point, Greaves has 45 second cooldown and Soul has 30."
TrueDoTA2,38ng5t,James_McNulty,1 point,Fri Jun 5 18:38:05 2015 UTC,"I think part of it boils down to what you're trying to accomplish.  Mek->GG is a teamfight, 5-man item where you want to be fighting as much as possible.  However, you're going to have trouble taking objectives after a teamfight with no mana.  GG having a 45s CD doesn't help if your regen doesn't allow you to cast it.  Bloodstone is more of an aggression item.  You can gank very effectively, which makes you stronger, and you're probably taking better advantage of runes by jumping around the map than grouping up and taking teamfights/pushing.  At the end of the day it comes down to team composition, but I'd rather run Timbersaw as an aggressive initiator/nuker than utility."
TrueDoTA2,38ng5t,genetalgiant,4,Fri Jun 5 19:14:34 2015 UTC,"The problem is that you are just better off going Dark Seer. He can get Mek and Arcanes into greaves much faster than Timbersaw, and he still has utility. Timbersaw wants to remain in the fights as long as possible to do as much damage as he can, but it is really hard without the proper items and bloodstone just gives him too much to sacrifice.  It is really just a poor investment on the hero. The item is strong, which is what makes it seem good."
TrueDoTA2,38ng5t,genetalgiant,1 point,Fri Jun 5 14:30:26 2015 UTC,"I feel picking FOTM hero will always seem better. I've been picking dark seer since long before his buffs and honestly he jungled faster than he does now, pre something like octarine.   Dark Seer and Timber are very different heroes though. Dark Seer Enables: Ion shell+Vacuum+Surge. Timber does damage. Almost only damage. Both are hard to gank and kill all game.   If you read the above guys calculations, it only becomes a problem when magic damage is involved to a much higher degree than physical damage. And I feel this can be overlooked with glimmer capes on your team or casual cloak into pipe on timber himself.   I've gotten well timed bloodstones and honestly feel the INT/ Mana pool or amount of bloodstone is overstated here. It's only once you have the 10+ bloodstone chargers that you feel it, and from that point, you probably have a significant advantage from kills to overstate it.   Also, the utility between Greaves and many other items like Hex, Lotus Orb or Linkens overshadows Bloodstone's suicide, even if you're ahead.  You do still remain in fights with my build. I don't ever think I've being conservative with my mana, or yolo with it.  I do agree with you that mek/greaves itself being a good item makes it seem god...but I don't think it makes it bad or suboptimal on timber for that reason."
TrueDoTA2,38ng5t,genetalgiant,1 point,Fri Jun 5 18:33:38 2015 UTC,"The raw HP, mana and mana regen that Bloodstone gives is what makes it good on him. Then there is the lower death cooldown, suicide and easy buildup. Also getting Bloodstone means you can actually spam your spells to clear creep waves and have your mana up relatively quickly to use it again.  Greaves is just a teamfight item with little purpose outside of that which makes a bad on a hero who is capable of dishing out tremendous amounts of damage. It is basically the same concept as buying greaves on any other carry type hero, it doesn't make much sense when there are better carriers and you can get better items for yourself.  Then there is the fact that before you actually complete the greaves, the meks mana cost will starve timber if he pops it. The arcanes alone wont cover the mana cost and if you buy 800 gold soul ring you are simply 800 gold behind getting your greaves."
TrueDoTA2,38ng5t,genetalgiant,1 point,Fri Jun 5 19:48:23 2015 UTC,"Considering it doesn't cost mana once you hit the greaves, it is comparable HP when you are alone and only becomes more EHP for your team.   It takes all three spells to kill a creep wave if you don't right click, this is usually 190+chakram level X Mana. Soul ring covers 150 of a creep wave and soul ring is up every 30 seconds.   If you are doing this in the jungle, you definitely need more than Greaves mana, but usually this is just Euls/Orchid/Hex level mana regen (150%) and INT items help.  If you're forced to dodge fights and farm, then the enemy is stronger than you. If you teamfights with Greaves, you aim to solve this. If they are weaker than you, Timber can easily deal with split push and doesn't need that level of mana. He can also handle deathball.  If you are aiming to farm for the next 10k gold between Bloodstone+Next Item, then you must be needing something like Hex or Orchid or something specific, because I don't know why you would need to dodge fights until that time.  I think we only have the mindset of better carriers because no one buys it on Timber. Yet. If you're in a fight where you need to have 4+ volleys of your spells, then having your team back up you up might help that situation, hence the Greaves. If you want to 1 v 3 them, go for it.   Honestly, if you think about the progression I go, it's not far from Bloodstone once I have Arcane Soul. But momentum and snowballing your team is much better than finding the items to farm all three lanes and the jungle...leaving your other cores with..anyways.   As much as Greaves are a Mek, it's both that, and an upgrade to your arcane boots. It is silly to say it has little purpose outside of teamfighting as it gives you an aura than lets you manfight harder at low health and remove debuffs and silences or whatever might hinder timber.   I think both of us are very set in what we are theory crafting (at least I'm theory crafting). I would say that I tried it and you haven't. Get back to me if you try it and if you find it useless, well I can tell you right now that I would say it was probably your playstyle our of the the hero's grasp in the game in the first place.  But you shouldn't knock it until you try it."
TrueDoTA2,38ng5t,Redrum01,2,Sat Jun 6 00:32:40 2015 UTC,"Ok I tried it. My thoughts on it:   Mek and Greaves are just super strong items in general. Can save you or win you a teamfight when popped. The build up was pretty good, especially for mek. The 1650 for Greaves is not too bad either. You can get alot of gold if you win a teamfight. Using 2 creep clearing combos puts you at around 30-40% mana, making it harder to flash farm. Always feels risky to use Greaves to give yourself mana. Incase you need it to escape or to save your teammate. You have more mana issues after finishing greaves than you do before it. Don't have mana to do Timbersaw things, like using Chakram to slow down creeps when enemy is pushing. You get low on mana in teamfights.   All in all, it's not bad. It is really strong when you can chain in and save someone or use the greaves to dispell something to save yourself. It is a really powerful item. But your damage and snowball ability is severely limited. Constantly running low on mana, have trouble farming and you don't take advantage of Timber's early powerspikes.  I would say, it is really good in lower MMR games where people do not have a designated mek carrier. It can win you games. It feels like a great second item for Timber in higher games, but at that point, you can get aghs and destroy the enemy team. It's a hard call."
TrueDoTA2,38ng5t,nice_guy_threeve,1 point,Sat Jun 6 22:26:13 2015 UTC,"That's good feedback honestly. Since it is kind of an ""boots"" upgrade for you it wouldn't hurt to have both Greaves+Bloodstone. In either order.  But I personally would have to say I would be more liekly to recommend and personally build a Lotus Orb to compliment a bloodstone since it does the dispel part of Greaves, which I value more than the low HP threshold/Guardian aura. BUt Lotus Orb first Item is bad without HP with compliment it.   Greaves is kind of the Half mana/HP component. And from there, I would look for a big ticket mana item solution or something smaller like Euls or Voidstone/Perserverance for Linkens.  I would say that I would never find I need too much more mana than one soul ring for two spells for about 200 MP usage to clear one wave. If you're using all 3 spells to do it without watching creeps HPs  then you should be able to solve it with a very small mana piece like a voidstone or even MP pool like 3 Stat Items or INT.   If you're doing things like keeping chakram out as counterpush to say a t2 tower, I would argue that even having a bloodstone level of farm at that point is a risky situation as you have less armor and no dispel at that point and are likely needing to fight, something Greaves will help tremendously more with. If you're defending like that, a bottle crowing action is all you need to do. I never really find the need to use all 3 Timber's spells off cooldown unless I'm farming the jungle. And if you're farming the jungle without getting ganked, then Bloodstone was probably the right choice if not another straight mana item as you're not getting pressured (less HP regen, something like Hex or Euls).  If you're defending T2s and have theoretically more than a bloodstone level of farm, like let's say you're close to finishing Shivas, you could ideally have say Guardian Greaves+a voidstone or possibly a Euls and easily have enough mana to kill a creep wave by keeping out chakram.  I think that for most people, me included, that this idea will feel clunky compared to how good a bloodstone with extra charges will feel. But I feel it's extremely doable and transitions you almost as well as a snowball while doing it more safely.   I'll try it more, time will tell. ANd realistically few people will stray from their bloodstone because of this mindset:  If I'm ahead, of course bloodstone will help more. If I'm behind, only Bloodstone will keep me relevant. But I feel players that buy Hex or Linkens first a patch ago will consider those items, and maybe Greaves if they're feeling extremely situational. But I feel it could be bigger, not to mention the build up is nice for many points in the game. The weird thing about Greaves also is that the items gives teams a lot and it'll essentially be a item that you have to keep with boots of travel or replace with something big."

You probably wouldn't find all the small mana pool items like sage's masks items and soul ring at decent enough times.  Offlane timber. I just saw bulldog play it, and he caught up, but it was his team setting up his combo. I'll link video later if I remember...  Edit: Here I haven't finished watching it, but he just got Bloodstone after his team recovered his horrible start. He had like brown boots+stout at like 12 minutes. Here Whoops wrong game i linked one time"
TrueDoTA2,38ng5t,Jackolope,2,Fri Jun 5 18:35:21 2015 UTC,"I think I would like to try it.  I don't like timber mid because Timberchain becomes so useless and I feel it's his strongest ability before Chakram.  The only other concern that I have is that Aghs is just so, so good on him.  Eul's has always been the fallback plan (often with blademail, which I've never found to work out very well.), and I could see the Eul's regen subbing for Bloodstone with only one Chakram.  Perhaps if it goes late you go ahead and build Octarine into Aghs.  Possibly vice/versa.    At any rate, I think if you can get Bloodstone by 15 you should.  This is the same way I feel about Leshrac - If I get bloodstone by 15 I can do everything: farm, splitpush, teamfight, and pretty much close out the game by 30.  Otherwise, it's time to search for alternatives, and hope my team is going to pick me up.  And with Timber, my problem has always been actually getting the bloodstone.  Leshrac as an example just has a much easier time farming early than Timbersaw does in my opinion.  All that to say I can see going straight into Mek/GG just because getting a fast bloodstone on him is not something that often works out for me personally."

Pre 15 is amazing yes, but not every game is going to be that good.  Checking datdota, the pro stats on Bloodstone back me up.  Yes, it's bought first almost always, but the average pickup time in 6.83 was 21 minutes.  That's average... so for each 15 minute bloodstone there's a 27 minute bloodstone (or many 24 minute bloodstones) counterbalancing it."
TrueDoTA2,38o68h,qwortec,7,Fri Jun 5 14:10:46 2015 UTC,"Hey, you've probably noticed that Oracle doesn't seem to be as great as last patch. While this is debatable, the consensus seems to be that the changes were ultimately a nerf to his play-style. That being said... this is a game. Play who makes you happy. Oracle is not a tier 1 support right now, but he's not garbage either. At 2.5k there is plenty of room for improvement and you can absolutely keep improving with Oracle, hell shoot for #1 on the leaderboard.  That being said, you're going to need to do some work. Now you mention your mechanical skill is not amazing. Well knowing how to improve is half the battle! Changing supports isn't going to improve your mechanics, only experience and practice will get you there. Beyond that I recommend studying Dotabuff and learning Oracle's match-ups. Recognize when the draft will be hard for you!  Wagamama is one of the best TA players out there and he has purposefully sought out pub games where TA is disadvantaged, to better push himself and learn how to handle poor match-ups. Recognize when you're at a disadvantage, and learn how to handle yourself. Beyond that keep improving your mechanics and learning to work with your team.  You can do this, and Oracle is absolutely still a viable pick for someone willing to put in time on him."

TrueDoTA2,38o68h,dirtyslarkpicker,1 point,Fri Jun 5 17:58:49 2015 UTC,"Oracle is not as good as before? People were saying the 6.83 sniper sucks and no one will pick him because of shrapnel change to not dmg building and the ministun removal, when in fact it become the top pick and was cancer during that period.  Same goes for current oracle, the invisibility removal doesnt mean anything for him, his ulti is now stronger and even though the cd is increased it's still far from enough for such a spell. This only changed about the solo mid oracle, he cant be play like that anymore, get lvl 7, ulti yourself and go solo kill someone, but for a support he's actually buffed."
TrueDoTA2,38o68h,Lazarous86,9,Fri Jun 5 22:56:06 2015 UTC,"Oracle + bloodseeker is pretty amazing right now. Once BS is thirsted he dives in, you wait till he is low and just ult him. Be sure not to steal the killing blows on heroes and he will pretty much tear through the team while healing to full. Really strong right now even at high skill brackets. You play 5 stacks, so you could also run a Zeus with that combo to make it as powerful as possible.   He also pairs well with Undying. Undying offers an instant heal and Oracle is more heal over time. This allows for heal stacking and pretty much making sure the Ult'ed target doesn't die.   What I am getting at is maybe your team needs to pick better around you supporting. If you are playing Ranked AP, I would pick oracle first. The only hero that really messes with him is AA.   I would also say, don't spam Oracle because he is a high skill cap hero and one that doesn't work in every lineup. He needs certain heroes to be most effective. Unless you run him mid. Then he is pretty strong. the E change allows you blow away most heroes mid game and secure farm in the early game much easier. All food for thought."
TrueDoTA2,38o68h,Thalnagath,1 point,Fri Jun 5 16:25:56 2015 UTC,The heal is applied before the damage. If someone in false promise takes damage equal to their total health they will die when it ends. Axe can also dunk them through it
TrueDoTA2,38o68h,Lazarous86,4,Fri Jun 5 17:55:04 2015 UTC,I don't understand what point you are trying to make. If he last hits someone with blood rage buff up he heals for double. So you are looking at a 1k heal in the mid to late game for one killing blow. The biggest thing is you can't stop him from killing you for 6 seconds. He can usually finish you off in that amount of time.   EDIT. I get what you are saying now. That means that team must throw up on 2k damage on a hero that is already almost dead. I think it is ok if that scenario happens. You probably won the fight if they had to kill the BS twice.
TrueDoTA2,38o68h,Thalnagath,2,Fri Jun 5 19:23:23 2015 UTC,It basically just means the healing portion of false promise doesn't matter much.
TrueDoTA2,38o68h,Kensike,3,Fri Jun 5 20:40:29 2015 UTC,"That's correct, but you're completely missing the point /u/Lazarous86 was trying to make. He's saying since heals are doubled as a result of false promise, that bloodseeker can bloodrage himself and score kills with an insane amount of heals. He's not justifying tower diving a 5 man team, he's saying that the duo pairs well because bloodseeker gains a large amount of health regenerated from his Q ability."
TrueDoTA2,38o68h,Thalnagath,1 point,Sat Jun 6 05:25:51 2015 UTC,"The heals are doubled at the end of False Promise, not during it.  Your health doesn't move during False Promise.  Instead, all healing and all damage is tallied and applied (as HP Removal in the case of the damage) when False Promise ends, with the healing being doubled and applied before the damage.  Note that because it works that way, it does not matter how much healing you receive.  If you have 1000 maximum HP and take 1000 damage, you will die, no matter if you received 20,000 healing in the same timeframe.  And since BS is taking up to 40% more damage from all sources during Bloodrage, it's highly likely he'll soak far more damage than he has health if he's ramboing around with False Promise.  I mean, you're still looking at potentially wiping the enemy team in exchange for a Bloodseeker, but it's very unlikely BS will survive once FP falls off.  The healing component of Bloodrage is almost completely irrelevant during False Promise.  I'm curious to see who would be awarded the kill and heal when BS dies after FP ends, though - does it operate off of total damage done, or simply most recent damage done?"

The reason for Oracle not being so great this patch is that almost every team has high burst magic damage and Fate's Edict effectively makes teamwork with these teammates hard. Oracle is now good against high physical damager or with high physical damage. Or with Huskar/Ursa etc.   What are you itemising, what lineups are you playing with?"

I do try to pick him up against physical damage but we play unranked so people wait to the last second and all pick or go late and counter pick.
TrueDoTA2,38o68h,Koolaidguy31415,1 point,Fri Jun 5 15:37:26 2015 UTC,"These days I would probably only go mana boots the changes make it worth it, and you can always become the mek/gg boots carrier if you have to - also everyone loves mana so you support your team more. I would skip Urn and Force unless the game completely required it. And rush either Euls - for move speed, sustain and ""the combo"" OR glimmer cape - make the ulti really nasty and give you an escape you may need.  I will say that I now think glimmer cape is core on Oracle even more so against high magic damage lineups. In rare cases consider going medallion --> Solar crest if nobody else is going to get that or there is no negative armour, this way you can help during rosh, make the carry even harder to take down (all mitigation accelerates heal and miss chance) Also in combat - solar crest + fates edict someone and they melt to physical. This way all you need is one right clicker and yourself and you can almost guarantee a kill on 90% of the hero pool even mid/late game. I know urn looks like the obvious choice with the Ulti - but it doesn't work well in battle."

If you ult Huskar when he's at % health and he has inner vitality on then he can run around without being disabled and double healing for the inner vit amount plus double lifesteal.  Also you can cast purifying flames on him at will due to his magic resist.  Even if Huskar dies after your ult, he just got to put in 6-8s worth of damage which in the mid game means at least two kills, if not more.  Just look for combos with Oracle."

TrueDoTA2,38oxwl,goblinbiddin,3,Fri Jun 5 17:14:29 2015 UTC,"I had commented this before, but I would love to see a piece addressing ""niche"" drafting where you pinpoint immediate weaknesses in a draft. Things like when to draft certain situational supports like Silencer (for instance versus heroes who can't spam in lane like Phoenix, Viper, or Pudge), Nyx (when you spot high int heroes), Pugna (versus heroes who can spam), KoTL (Mana Leak can devastate certain heroes, like Timebrsaw) and Bane (Nightmare makes Bloodseeker a sad panda) would be useful. Sometimes a key draft like that can tear apart an enemy's line-up, but I struggle to consistently identify when it would fall apart versus certain abilities and instead find myself leaning on generic tier 1 supports too often.  I would also caution you to slow your roll a little bit with all the articles. I think allowing the community time to read, process, and discuss things would best allow us to appreciate your work.

I want to stress that ""Countering"" heroes is a poor practice in general and that drafting a ""way to deal with"" a hero or combination your enemy has shown you is a much better way of thinking about it (just so you don't get caught up in, ""what? viper is bad against PL, don't pick viper!""

TrueDoTA2,38ng8j,ExtraRicey,8,Fri Jun 5 10:18:15 2015 UTC,"I don't see any advantage in mechanical keyboards, people just prefer them because you can feel the switches engage or whatever so they know with 100% certainty that when they press a key the thing actually worked. Sometimes laptop/normal keyboards can wear out and the key doesn't work every time. It also provides a bit of resistance, determined by what kind of switches you use, to prevent things like accidental key presses.  Absolutely get a headset with a mic. I don't know about speakers, I see no point to having both, but a headset helps you tell if something is just off to the right of your screen or to the left, etc. A mic is critically important to having any strategy beyond ""Go on this guy"" or ""go here.""   Mice can be important. Having extra buttons can help if you bind things to quickcast on those buttons, for example you can pull off some crazy Blinks with it. My 5th and 6th slots are specifically for Blinks or whatever else I want to put in that slot that I want to Quickcast or be able to get to at a moment's notice (Treads, Phase, BKB, Mek since it's not targeted anyway and timing is important, etc.), and these are bound to the buttons on the side of my very basic gaming mouse.

The common claim is that they break easily. Personally, I've gone through several, typically they break or one ear's audio goes out. You're probably best off getting a stand-alone mic (e.g. clip-on, or one that sits on your desk), and headphones/earbuds/whatever your want.  Minor Payoff - Mouse  Everything else is a minor contribution or preferential. Extra keys (especially on the mouse) can be useful. If you watch player streams, you'll see a lot of them have items mapped to their mouse buttons.  For mice, get something that is comfortable.

Minor Payoff - Keyboard  Similar to mice, really is preference. Some keyboards may have extra keys you can map, or they are laid out slightly differently. Mechanical keyboards are also just a preference.   just use my laptop's keyboard   Given you are using a laptop keyboard, it may be worth it to get a stand-alone keyboard. Laptop keyboards are pretty flat and it is very easy to hit multiple/wrong keys (could just be my personal experience). I also personally find the way my hands rest on them to be very awkward. If you have a similar experience, even getting a cheap $10 keyboard could make a big impact."
TrueDoTA2,38ng8j,Axosh,2,Fri Jun 5 14:37:49 2015 UTC,I dont know getting a mouse that allows you to move fast and accurate is pretty key in dota.
TrueDoTA2,38ng8j,Endzior,1 point,Fri Jun 5 14:50:05 2015 UTC,"My feeling is that you can get by with a garbage mouse while you are still learning. Basic decision making and mechanics are going to heavily outweigh any peripheral.  I think it starts to make a difference when you're a high level player that relies heavily on reaction time and mechanical skill, or you're playing at the competitive level.  There is a floor to it as well. Like if you had a trackball or something, it would hold you back. But if you're like the OP and have a generic optical mouse, that will be fine for now."

Keyboard might be more comfortable, but if you are happy with what you use now, it's not hugely important.  Mouse - yes, absolutely a gaming mouse will make playing much easier, your mouse movement will be more accurate, you can use the extra buttons which are more easy to use than some of the default key bindings, and it will be more comfortable, since gaming mice are usually more ergonomic."

The logitech G430 occasionally get a shout out on MadlustEnvy's headphone thread, but you still need a proper headphone amp to drive it.  You're better off getting a good can live the Creative CAL and stick a clip-on mic on it.

For mouse, get whatever you like and feels comfortable. As for keyboard, I have a mechanical myself, they dont give any advantage but in my opinion are nicer. If you spend a lot of time with it, better to use something good. As of brands, I wouldn't recommend any gaming mechanical keyboards.

TrueDoTA2,38ng8j,AbareKiller,0,Sat Jun 6 02:38:55 2015 UTC,"Advantage? No. Comfort, yes.  A good headset, I think is critical to any computer setup, but that's because I enjoy hearing as much of the audio file as I can. A clear and crisp headset designed to produce good sound will blow away any cheap headset, but only if you are able to notice the difference. Some people don't care about audio quality, and that's fine, it'll probably save them tons of money. I'm not talking about the ""audiophile"" level of investment, but spending $100-$150 on a headset is a reasonable price for a nice one. You also have to be careful of manufacturers that charge a high price but don't have a quality product (and unless something has changed in the last few years, bluetooth or wireless audio doesn't produce as good of a sound as wired) If audio just needs to be audible to you, then you can save yourself plenty of money.  A basic gaming mouse is pretty necessary to be able to tune the sensitivity properly, and having side buttons definitely helps, unless you want to get used to using ctrl or alt keys for your items. Beyond that you need to look at what suits you. I bought a G700s because I have trouble with smaller mice, and I really liked the curved thumbrest to avoid having my thumb drag on the mousepad. I bought a hard mousepad to go with the mouse because I like having a smooth feeling of movement. This doesn't give me much in measurable advantage, but I'm more comfortable when I play and I'm not trying to remind myself to pick my thumb off the desk. I'm also applying the amount of pressure that I prefer to use when moving my mouse around the screen.   You can argue about some forms of performance increase in the ability to reach the engagement point of a key on a mechanical keyboard versus the little plastic domes, but I doubt that'll do much for you. However, I bought a mechanical keyboard a year or two ago and I won't go back. The smoothness and the lightness of touch that you can apply to the keys is quite nice when typing. I don't notice it for gaming, but after sitting at my computer for work all day, the smooth transition of the keys is easier on the joints of my hand and increases my level of comfort.  A gaming chair, or a ergonomic chair, again, doesn't provide you with better performance, but it does make you more comfortable. You can sit in the correct posture for long periods of time without causing yourself back pain.  In short, its up to you. If you are uncomfortable, or you think the chance of being more comfortable is worth the price tag, then make the changes and buy some higher end equipment. If you aren't, then keep playing the way you do now. Its not going to make you a better player directly, but over time you'll notice the difference in your setup and you won't want to go back."

TrueDoTA2,38j6s2,sevhead,3,Thu Jun 4 19:23:55 2015 UTC,"Generally they seem unexciting, although standard BoTs with the new 45 second cooldown are amazing. The only thing i can see the level 2 BoTs being useful for is if you have a hero that wants to fight with the team, but also wants to push out lanes at the same time, and wants to be able to get to the fights even if his team is not near creeps. I don't see this happening all that often, except for with heroes that can already do this, like prophet or spec, so it seems to me mostly like a luxury for the point in the game where we just don't have anything else to buy."

TrueDoTA2,38kjyn,Attil,7,Thu Jun 4 20:38:27 2015 UTC,"I have to disagree with your conclusions.  I do not agree with you that PL can be 100% win with the appropriate last pick, and I also do not agree with you that he would be the lone example (the best example of that I can think of would be Huskar). I would agree that he requires a little bit more drafting around then most traditional carries, but I also feel he is not as hard as most either, as he starts to fall off once the supports have ways of dealing with diffusal.  Dagon Brood or Basher Brood both have extremely potent late game, so I'd disagree with you there. I disagree that PL doesn't need items to annihilate; he definitely needs comparable farm to the enemy carry, assuming they are itemizing appropriately and are not out-drafted. I also disagree that only Mjollnir counters him, I think Battlefury serves in a pinch as well as various AOE items. Veil is a niche pick-up depending on your line-up (remember it can be used to spot the real illusion). Both Shivas and Radiance can have some impact as well (both do AOE, Radiance helps weaken all the illusions and greatly reduce their damage, Shivas helps reduce damage output and ""catch"" the real PL). Crimson Guard basically makes his illusions useless.  I do agree with your analysis of Meepo, Storm and Techies. I would not necessarily be opposed to making Mjollnir unpurgeable.  I do not think your conclusions are based on a solid ground at all and I think PL is in a great place balance-wise right now, both for pubs and the competitive scene (49% winrate for both categories)."

If its all-pick I usually try to draft my support around the enemy carry. Positioning is big too, but that's pretty context specific. Sometimes you're just going to feed a death, but in team fights if he's focusing you, ideally your cores are taking advantage of that.   Where did you get the winrate stats?

TrueDoTA2,38kjyn,brinebold,3,Fri Jun 5 02:11:27 2015 UTC,"Okay, first, he's not uncounterable via items. You just need more than one hero to build his item counter(s): blademails, mjolnirs (for the lightning attack procs, not just the shield), and/or a crimson guard. One item usually doesn't do it, you usually need 2 of them unless you have a hero or two with good AOE.  Second I don't think PL needs a nerf but the AOE dagon equivalent is definitely interesting.  There are already several reverse soul rings though. One of the more popular ones is called mekanism, dagon can also serve much the same purpose."
TrueDoTA2,38kjyn,subraizada3_,1 point,Fri Jun 5 03:40:08 2015 UTC,"Why Blademail? As he is illusion based, he's one of the only heroes (aside from summoners and Meepo), who can ignore it without BKB. Maybe I have overlooked something, have I?"
TrueDoTA2,38kjyn,subraizada3_,1 point,Fri Jun 5 19:19:59 2015 UTC,"1) PL has very little HP until he gets his Skadi or Heart but still does a considerable amount of damage, if he rushes those before his Manta + Diffusal he's either left with no damage (Manta -> HP) or no way to purge off Orchid (Diffusal -> HP, unless he uses the charges on himself).  2) His illusions take 500% damage. If they're all hitting on a Blademailed target, the illusions should lose HP at 80% the rate of the real PL (16% of PL's damage, multiplied by 5 when it's returned by BM), allowing you to find out which one is real (and then kill him, since he has no HP)."
TrueDoTA2,38kjyn,wildtarget13,1 point,Sat Jun 6 23:17:23 2015 UTC,"They actually take a lot more than 80% of the damage the main one does early. Diffusal proc damage gets reflected too so they more or less 1-shot themselves before his first ultimate orb.  Also, taking out the first wave ASAP is essential so blademail + whatever AOE your team can muster clears them out much faster then you can then start beating on the real one and it makes it so that mjol procs can take care of the injured illusions that spawn pretty quickly."

Also, Crimson guard makes your team immune to about half his damage if you can get it at the same time he gets his diffusal.   From there, take objectives and hope your team can handle the other 4 members of the Phantom Lancer's team. Sometimes the answer is no or requires serious plays from your team.   Just play the hero yourself and you can realize that you can be evasive, but you're not the strongest hero on the map all game. You're pretty weak early actually."

Maybe its just my 4,2k mmr badness, but I have some problems with it.  Crimson Guard does not reduce his damage as Damage Block does not work on diffusal damage  With Shadow Blade you have a very good point! I have never thought about it, but Silver Edge should disable his passive spawning, making it easy to manfight him. This is the exact point I was searching for.  As for me playing him, I never said he is OP, just that he is binary. Usually when enemy team was mostly single-target or had no reliable, spammable, high-damage AoE like Axe's counter helix, Overwhelming Odds or even Lina's combo i had no problem getting out of control and carrying the game. But when enemies got Ember Spirit, Earthshaker etc, I was mostly useless.  Why would you say he's weak early? Extremely good base damage, above average hit points, 200+ damage spammable nuke. While not a Gyrocopter-like powerhouse, he's certainly nowhere near spectre-level useless.  EDIT: Just checked it in custom lobby, Silver Edge is dispelled by Doppleganger, so this strategy doesn't work."

Does CG still block quill spray and the like?  If so... is it because it's specifically an active or is there an oversight in the item (either in CG itself or that it affects the item - based and not ability based burn damage). Does it block AM burn?
TrueDoTA2,38kjyn,subraizada3_,1 point,Fri Jun 5 15:19:45 2015 UTC,Vanguard: The damage can block 100 % of the damage from illusions in the early game. They can block Phantom Lancer's illusions efficiently in the late game (they do the lowest amount of damage). Can't block mana burn's damage.  I do believe Crimson Guard behaves the exact same way.  Source: http://dota2.gamepedia.com/Vanguard  Apparently that's bullshit and Crimson Guard active blocks the Diffusal damage. I guess it's connected to the damage block rework in 6.84.
TrueDoTA2,38kjyn,lolfail9001,2,Fri Jun 5 02:57:28 2015 UTC,"It's been like that since before 6.84. Diffusal adds the bonus Feedback damage directly to autoattack damage (like AM's Mana Break). Something like Clinkz's Searing Arrows however does damage in a separate instance, meaning each autoattack would be blocked twice until 6.84 made it so damage block no longer works on spells."

TrueDoTA2,38kjyn,subraizada3_,2,Fri Jun 5 01:15:29 2015 UTC,I know that it sounds stupid but you just need to snowball against him. His laning presence is not the greatest one and if he'll rush diffusals both he and his illusions will be too squishy. Go to 20-25 minutes highground push and there is not so much PL can do.  Basically PL and Naga can be unstopable if Naga will get radiance or PL will get diffusial + yasha/vlads. But if they'll lose all the outer towers at 20 min mark there is not much they can do.
TrueDoTA2,38kjyn,lolfail9001,2,Thu Jun 4 21:06:36 2015 UTC,"The problem is Radiance has a 3800 component while Diffusal's most expensive is 1k, which can easily be achieved even with only reliable gold. Also, to be unstoppable Naga Siren need 5k Radiance + 2,5k BoT + 5k Manta Style to remove silences. While she is at that point stronger than PL, that's a lot of time to get her shut down. Not so much with PL's 3k core. Of course, snowballing against him works. It works against every single hero. I dont think there is a hero that shines when all enemies are 5/0. And his laning phase is not atrocious like Spectre's, Phantom Assassin's or Riki's, just mediocre."
TrueDoTA2,38kjyn,subraizada3_,2,Thu Jun 4 21:16:25 2015 UTC,"I'm an avid naga player and completely disagree with you saying naga can be countered even with a bad draft. If they didn't pick heroes that specifically counter me I'll win the game unless I fuck up.  She is a really strong laner, farms off the map well(pre radiance), is pratically immortal past 6, and auto wins the game if the enemy hasn't raxed at 18 minutes."
TrueDoTA2,38kjyn,subraizada3_,2,Thu Jun 4 22:25:30 2015 UTC,"It is the only hero that can be 100% win after the draft.   Bold claim. Lots of heroes do better depending on the draft, broodmother comes to mind.    He is 100% uncounterable by items nor by playstyle.   Again, another bold claim. You can itemize against him; battlefury and maelstorm both provide aoe to heroes that lack it. You go on to mention mjollnir, so I don't know why you said 100%.   I just don't think PL is as unique as you do in this regard."

TrueDoTA2,38iqik,Omnikiller,11,Thu Jun 4 14:11:31 2015 UTC,I feel like the life steal is so minimal it wont help as much as the armor and active from mek. Theres probably gonna be a better vlads carrier on the team.
TrueDoTA2,38iqik,ishkabum,10,Thu Jun 4 14:31:06 2015 UTC,Theres probably gonna be a better vlads carrier on the team.   Can't you say the same thing about Mek?
TrueDoTA2,38iqik,stolemyusername,20,Thu Jun 4 14:32:30 2015 UTC,Timing on mek is super important. That's why you see mids pick it up often in competitive. A 12min mek has way more game impact then a 20 min mek. Getting a 12 min Vlad's does basically nothing as your damage is still to low for the lifesteal to matter.
TrueDoTA2,38iqik,f5f5f5f5f5f5f5f5f5f5,5,Thu Jun 4 15:12:45 2015 UTC,"Also, Viper's damage has a significant magical component and doesn't rely on attack speed."
TrueDoTA2,38iqik,subraizada3_,1 point,Thu Jun 4 15:49:06 2015 UTC,"Nethertoxin also adds a significant amount of physical damage to it, 160 per attack when the enemy is at 20% or less. Simply last hitting a creep would heal about 20 damage, equivalent to a melee hero hitting for a bit over 130 damage with a normal attack. I personally just go for a raw Morbid Mask if I feel like I need lifesteal. Vlads also still wouldn't amp the Nethertoxin damage and Viper doesn't really focus on building up agi like Drow or PL do, so going for the HotD into a later Satanic seems better.  EDIT: Poison Attack is a UAM, Morbid/HotD/Satanic doesn't work on Viper."
TrueDoTA2,38iqik,CaptainComo,5,Sat Jun 6 23:06:10 2015 UTC,"From what I understand, the point of having a Mek on the viper is that 1. He can get it faster than a position 4-5 support (you can prob get it by 12-14 min if your lane went decently). 2. You can deathball push with it while Viper is at its peak. So while Viper might not be a good 40 min Mek carrier, the point of having a Mek on Viper is to push and gain an surmountable advantage in the early mid game."
TrueDoTA2,38iqik,kroxldyphivian,2,Thu Jun 4 15:12:58 2015 UTC,That's why I don't really get mek on viper anymore either. Even as far back as the 6.82 nerf to mana cost I started not liking mek on viper so much. But now in 6.84 with the popularity of heroes like undying I think its best to leave mek to someone else on your team. If we have no better mek carrier then I will still get it on viper but i still feel it isn't optimal. I'd rather get better ganking items like blink/solar crest/atos/guinsoos/whatever. Same reasoning for vlads.
TrueDoTA2,38iqik,Harlequeens,2,Thu Jun 4 15:17:50 2015 UTC,I also not a fan of Mek on Viper and prefer using my lane dominance on items to increase my carrying power.

TrueDoTA2,38iqik,-Hellfire-,0,Fri Jun 5 01:46:45 2015 UTC,Orchid is a much better item. Follow that up with Aghs and Ethereal to basically kill any hero during the duration of Orchid.
TrueDoTA2,38iqik,Jackolope,2,Fri Jun 5 03:40:15 2015 UTC,"Why not both the mek and the vlads? Mek first, for impact. But you also have mana needs and everything else it offers makes you a better man fighter. Situationally, I think it could let you kill a few heroes you wouldn't be able to without it."
TrueDoTA2,38iqik,goblinbiddin,2,Thu Jun 4 15:47:14 2015 UTC,"Vlad's is one of my favorite items in dota. That being said, no, i don't think it is any substitute for mek on viper, or even all that interesting of an item on the hero. If you want to skip mek, for instance because someone else on the team is buying one, i recommend either just sprinting right for the ahgs, or if you prefer, going for treads drums. What viper needs, really, is stats. While vlad's is a great item, it isn't a stat item, not even with the recent inclusion of a headress. The stattier you are, the longer you can last in fights, the more ults and poison attacks you can throw around, and the longer people have to deal with your ever infuriating corrosive skin."
TrueDoTA2,38iqik,wildtarget13,2,Thu Jun 4 22:59:43 2015 UTC,"It's good. Deso+Vlads is really solid on viper, and a lot of carries. Your HP pool isn't as good though, so you have to account for that. It also allows you to rosh earlier"

I think it depends also on your team. if you have a tanky front liner carry (assuming you play mid), I mean, why not? viper is a good aura carrier since he is naturally tanky and etc."

TrueDoTA2,38j9ty,goblinbiddin,3,Thu Jun 4 16:19:00 2015 UTC,"While Manta does sound good, if you plan on getting it, get it after AC. The aura is amazing and will let you melt towers even more quickly while keeping your army alive and hitting faster.  Also, Crimson Guard should never be bought. The active does not work on creeps or summons, only heroes."
TrueDoTA2,38j9ty,thundrfang,1 point,Thu Jun 4 17:39:40 2015 UTC,"The idea with manta is to make you more of a threat without actually having to be present while also making it easy to move between mid and a sidelane or into the jungle without having to spend an ult or TP cooldown, allowing you to be everywhere at once, essentially, once you have manta, AC is amazing, but AC is just so damned expensive that i don't think it's worth it to get before manta unless you're sure people are just going to sit there letting you hit buildings (and at that point in the game, if you're allowed to just hit buildings, you've probably already claimed a set or two of raxxes)  Hm... right you are about crimson, that's odd, since buckler does affect creeps... w/e that was just some random thing i thought of as i was writing this, editted OP, thanks for the catch."
TrueDoTA2,38j9ty,wildtarget13,1 point,Thu Jun 4 18:10:31 2015 UTC,"Hello. It seems you are flooding the subreddit with many TL:DRs that I may skim.   Just a heads up, manta is 300 gold less than assault and honestly has just about as difficult of a buildup. Assault secret shop is a little harder, but you really dont' need manta rather than BKB any game. If you want to be cool and dodge venge stun or scout will your illusions instead of your wolves, then buy it and say BKB is a boring item. Your aura from illusions will only linger if your enemy isn't tping to the tower. If they aren't defending tower, you should be hitting it with your hero anyways. If the vlads isn't on a tower, the aura is really negligible as it really is about letting your creeps tank tower shots more. Tanking enemy creeps wont' matter.  The thing about lycan is that if he is allowed to farm anywhere, he becomes a monster that split pushes and takes rosh when the enemy is scared of even entering their jungle.   Heroes that scout rosh easily and can contest a small rosh fight easily really hurt the vlads for rosh strategy. AA ult, clockwerk, TA traps, and assassins. I honestly am more of a proponent of getting medallion into solar rest on the hero instead of vlads in many situations. Just think of how often you're around your allies with vlads, you're losing out on a huge potential of the item if you demand that you buy it. The regen is slightly worth it, but I find a bottle solves all of the regen issues lycan needs fixing.   Also, Roshan has been getting buffed, but Powertreads+bottle medallion makes rosh about as easy to kill as vlads. Especially if you have one more hero with you. Now that solar crest gives a miss chance, it becomes really easy to solo it. Of course, Usually skipping vlads means getting a faster necrobook. And while Arteezy and as a result, me, both get vlads on the hero, I've seen him go treads+into straight necrobook because necrobook also allows you to pressure and take rosh when you need to."
TrueDoTA2,38j9ty,on_rocket_falls,2,Thu Jun 4 21:57:17 2015 UTC,"I actually usually like to skip treads because i'll be getting travels as soon as necrobook is done. also, the manta is to provide vlads aura and some extra pushing power to make my pushes threatening without having to volunteer my hero, which bkb doesn't do at all. Why does no one seem to think that vlad's damage aura on creeps does anything? Having played with the item for nearly as long as it has existed i can assure you that the damage on lane creeps, your wolves and necrominions is significant.   The big buildup item i like in manta is the yasha, so i can move around the map quickly without using my ult or travels, which although they are short cooldowns, is a nice boost to my strategic mobility. Then again, maybe I only like getting a yasha because i can't justify getting blink dagger, which is without a doubt my favorite item in dota.  AC is purchased as soon as possible after the manta, I usually find that the ability to take towers without volunteering your hero is worth more than an AC which, until you have the manta to provide the aura, doesn't do anything unless your hero is present. AC, however, is a very strong item and i wouldn't fault you for going AC first, especially if you're the type that is determined that vlad's is terrible and shouldn't be bought.  I only really sneak rosh a lot when i run jungle lycan, which i don't really like to do, because it weakens the lanes. My preferred way to play him is actually in the offlane. I suppose a mid or safelane lycan would be capable of sneaking rosh effectively as well, but i don't really like running him in either of those roles.  If he's a safelane farmer, it's likely that the 4 man unit in the 4+1 tactics won't have a hero that scales all that well into the late game, forcing lycan to come to fights more and more often as the game drags on, which is not what he wants to be doing, lycan wants to hit buildings.  If he's mid, he likely wont win the lane. He can easily not lose the lane, but he is much more likely to lose than to win, just by virtue of the fact that he's melee and doesn't have an aoe nuke to spam out like shockwave or even thunderclap. Although this type of mid hero can be viable, i generally find that, especially in matchmaking, the easiest way to lose a game of dota is to lose mid, and lycan is much more likely to do that to your team than your opponent's.  I like solar crest on lycan, as a concept, but I never seem to get it, because i never feel like it's going to give me what i want at the time i'm considering it.  This isn't really intended to be a lycan guide, but more a demonstration of what it means to run ""4+1"" midgame tactics, from the perspective of the split pusher (the ""1"" of 4+1). This is a followup on my post concerning midgame decision making and strategy in general, found here:  Thoughts on the Mid Game  I'm sorry if you don't enjoy my posts, they are rather lengthy, i know, but I have a lot to say ^  Thanks for the input."
TrueDoTA2,38j9ty,literallymetaphoric,1 point,Thu Jun 4 22:50:56 2015 UTC,I usually try to split push as Weaver (with maelstrom) but occasionally get flamed by my team for doing so. When should I be in team fights with my team vs split pushing?
TrueDoTA2,38j9ty,non_clever_name,1 point,Fri Jun 5 22:50:39 2015 UTC,"If your team isn't fighting yet and you want to force TPs before TPing yourself, if the structure you're pushing is worth more than the structure your team is defending (say T1 vs T3), or if you know your team can't win fights and you need to go for decent trades instead then you should be split pushing.  A lot of players without good game knowledge think that they have to contest EVERY push their opponent makes. That just isn't the case. If your opponent moves all 5 of their players to take a tower in a lane, glyph it while sending 2 of your own teammates to the other lanes to apply pressure while getting a core/carry famed up in the jungle. Your opponents will actually lose a good amount of farm/time from doing so, and if they keep going then TP a few supports back to help clear the waves.  Also, you should consider making your own thread next time. You'll get more replies."
TrueDoTA2,38hwdo,FabulousMrFox,11,Thu Jun 4 09:22:50 2015 UTC,"It sounds like you need to work on your micro skills. Watch RTZ whenever he is losing a Naga game, and note his illusion micro. He will cut the creep waves and time his illusions perfectly. First just one single illusion goes. He'll use that illusion to drag the creep wave back, kill the ranged creeps (with a ""Riptide""), and take the melee wave to half HP. Next his 2nd illusion will arrive after the first dies to further drag the creep wave back and finish the wave off (without using ""Riptide""). This is a key element to Naga, as it secures you farm and secures your team space, since the enemy team can't push without a creep wave.  The game state determines what you other illusions do, but generally it will be farm the closest jungle camp while your main Naga tackles a medium camp. Otherwise it will be the same deal with an alternate lane's creep wave. If he is losing extremely badly I have seen him do this type of thing even while in the fountain, its just difficult to micro both of those illusions that well. RTZ has actually memorized timing on creep waves so he can stack shift-queue move orders blindly and have his illusions arrive on time and perfectly kite the creeps without micro.  If losing, go Octarine after BoTS; if even or winning, go for Manta. You need to learn where the creep waves will be based around the game clock at any given time, and also be able to keep track of ""partially wounded"" creep camps in the jungle and creep waves you previously weakened with illusions. Don't gank, don't rotate, or don't play Naga. It will cost you the game if you play Naga that way, as it slows her farm down. Naga wins by consuming the whole map and delaying with her illusions. You need to choke the enemy anytime they leave an area and group up."
TrueDoTA2,38hwdo,Ailodierap,3,Thu Jun 4 15:17:15 2015 UTC,yes I am in 4k and play naga.  You are not a ganker in fact i skip net until 12 and only 1 point until later   pre 20 radi unless you have lost a set of rax should win the game with proper management and a team that doesnt feed endlessly. send illusions down lanes and stop pushes before they get anywhere close while farming your items.
TrueDoTA2,38hwdo,kslidz,1 point,Thu Jun 4 12:18:14 2015 UTC,"The problem is, this meta encourages early agression so much it is quite likely you are almost confined to your base by the time you get radi. Consider this, a typical ""hard"" 6.84 game imo:  You are a mid naga, laning vs a heavy early game ganker (eg qop, Lesh). You do well in mid, maybe even outfarm your opponent with the help of jungle camps. But your opponent pushes out the wave and leaves mid to go kill your safe lane at around 10. Even if the gank fails, your allies are forced out of the lane and t1 falls. The enemy camp your jungle getting pickoffs with their pudges/ baras. The lack of map control means you can't really take t1 solo. Eventually, the gank ball rotates mid and gets your t1 at around 20.   So, you have radi, it's 20 min, your jungle is lost, the enemies are taking mid t2. You are 10 kills behind and your teamfight is weaker. The normal naga move would be to pressure enemy safe lane t1 and farm the enemy jungle, but by the time you even get there your mid t2 will fall. You don't contribute much in fights as your naked illusions get focused down in a second. You don't have enough time to cut the wave as the deathball is already there and your team does not try to trade. Instead, they group mid as 4 and try to take a fight they can't win, so cutting waves delays the inevitable for maybe a minute or so. GG report Naga  P.S. I do not claim that this happens to me every game, but to climb mmr you need to be able to win the ""hard"" games. And since 6.84 is so snowbally I am just scared to play Naga"
TrueDoTA2,38hwdo,jaccarmac,1 point,Thu Jun 4 14:27:39 2015 UTC,"Cut the waves, then. If it's pre-20, no one will be able to deal with your illusions alone, which means you can cut the lane they are pushing ad infinitum. Can't push T2s without creeps...  EDIT: Just read your bit on cutting. What do you mean by ""the deathball is already there""? Even five heroes at 20 minutes will not be able to take a tower without creeps very easily. If they have creeps at the tower, then you aren't cutting effectively enough."

We were down 1 rax but sending one illusion down 2 seconds after the first allows you to aggro the wave and to pull it back over and over and over until your team can get farm and then enemy has to make a commitment. It isnt about getting 1kgpm at that point it is about creating space for your team. with your ult you can still safely farm a jungle if the enemy isnt sieging.

TrueDoTA2,38fon9,HM_Slaver,15,Wed Jun 3 22:19:58 2015 UTC,According to Dotabuff Jakiro does best against:   Meepo (lots of AOE) CK (lots of AOE) TA (lots of damage over time) WK (stuns and slows) Axe (stuns and slows) Slardar (stuns and slows) Medusa (stuns and slows) Omni (stuns and slows) Treant (liquid fire counters living armour?) Tiny (stuns and slows)
TrueDoTA2,38fon9,icheyne,9,Wed Jun 3 23:00:09 2015 UTC,I play CK a ton. I die a little everytime someone picks Jakiro.

TrueDoTA2,38fon9,reivision,3,Thu Jun 4 00:45:33 2015 UTC,I kinda like him in a team that's going to 5-man pretty hard. he's horrible if you leave him alone or in a group of 2 but really shines as a teamfighter.  He's a really good pickup if the opposing lane is very susceptible to harassment in the laning phase. People vastly underestimate the value of 2 points in liquid fire and 1 in dual breath by level 3 for putting a lot of pressure on the opposing laners.

TrueDoTA2,38fon9,alzer9,3,Wed Jun 3 22:47:23 2015 UTC,"I think Jakiro is good versus kiting heroes and some AOE combo heroes.  Just imagine centuar, tide, and other melee range initiators, if you icepath where they are going to be, it really messes up their timing, but also requires good timing on your part.  Jakiro is usually a walking liquid fire for pushes and can even combo well versus AND as a combo with things like clockwerk and duel."
TrueDoTA2,38fon9,wildtarget13,3,Wed Jun 3 23:43:41 2015 UTC,"I think it's most important to note that, especially with heroes like Jakiro, it's more about what heroes he's good with than what heroes he's good against. Jakiro needs a team that wants to take objectives(to make use of liquid fire), usually a fairly strong laning support partner (Low movement speed and 400 range limit jaki's effectiveness at zoning, even with liquid fire) and something to hold people in place for ice path (which is hard as hell to hit) and especially macropyre (which is devastating if it lands). With this in mind, at least from a drafting perspective, Jakiro is a good pick when you see a team built around, say, a medusa, or with multiple hungry cores, because you'll be able to hit them before they're ready to fight. Unfortunately, that kind of style of team (the turtle and farm sort of team) is extremely unpopular at the moment, and so I don't favor Jakiro as a pick right now. The only way i'd run a Jakiro right now is if i were going to run a jakiro skywrath void safelane, and even that has its weaknesses."
TrueDoTA2,38fon9,goblinbiddin,2,Thu Jun 4 03:25:49 2015 UTC,"You don't nessicarily have to ""hit"" an ice path. While having a nice stun to start is certainly good, you can use ice path very similarly to fissure. It's not nearly as good as fissure, of course.  You're not wrong, I just wanted to point out that ice path is a great zoning tool as well as a stun.   Also don't forget animation canceling, it can be key to adjust placement of your path or simply to fake out an observant enemy."

TrueDoTA2,38fon9,hackmun,1 point,Thu Jun 4 15:34:10 2015 UTC,"Jakiro excels against physical right clicks, minus Ursa for the same reason Enchantress' Untouchable falls flat against him - his attack speed overrides any IAS impairments, unfortunately.  I play Jakiro regularly as it's one of my faves quite frankly.  Typically rush Liquid Fire followed by Ice Path. Dual Breath last. While I'm short on nuke damage that way I make up for it by controlling fights and saving allies' butts all over the place.  A BKB SF/Jugger/Troll/<insert right click carry> will get screwed over by Liquid Fire, hard - particularly in the mid game where IAS isn't in the extreme yet. If you get somewhat decent farm and get a Shivas in lategame it only gets more ridiculous. Go to Roshan with a Shivas and Liquid fire; he's hardly even moving.  Finally, once Liquid Fire is 2-3 you pretty much win your lane(s) most of the time. Easy harass and if manually casted does not draw creep aggro. Plus the nuisance factor it puts onto the enemy's carry when trying to last hit.  Against the heavy physical line ups I generally also pick up a Solar Crest. Jakiro gets so tanky it's not even funny."

You cast the macropyre to force him to stop beating someone up because he's no longer immune to all the incoming damage and he doesn't have the health pool to support standing in the fire. I've done the same thing to riki on occasion.  I agree that for the reasons you mention jakiro isn't a great pick vs slark but I have played him vs one. Keep in mind that purging stuff during a fight also costs him as much health as one of the nukes would have done.

TrueDoTA2,38gwn8,alexja21,1 point,Mon Jun 8 03:57:33 2015 UTC,"Taking a wild guess, I would suppose for tread-switching because so many embers get bottle.  Drums and treads both beef up Ember's HP and mana pool, both of which need a little beefing up."
TrueDoTA2,38gwn8,Drop_,2,Thu Jun 4 03:52:31 2015 UTC,"I haven't seen Aquilia Treads.  Lately the curious thing about Ember is the blink dagger pickups on him.  Both Zai and Yao went that route.    The problem with Bfury and Crit is obvious to me.  Let's say you rush bfury and crit, after a bottle, and boots of choice.  You're talking ~10k gold until you come online.  And to make it worse, ember's early to midgame strength is in Flame Guard and Bolas.  But to leverage both of those skills you need some HP otherwise you will just get right clicked down.  But if you're rushing Bfury and Crit it means that taking part in any fights before you are level 16 is a HUGE risk.  Particularly because this patch demands teamfighting often before the 30 minute mark.  With that said Zai did go the relatively traditional bfury crit.  After aquilia treads blink dagger.    So some things: Treads are really good now.  Tread Switching is really strong on ember and really anyone who picks up bottle.  The buff to 9 stats not only increased potential damage significantly from treads, but also increased value out of tread switching.    Treads + Drums is pretty solid level of bulk for Ember early on.   I don't think yasha is worth it in general.  Maybe if you need a manta for the self purge but I honestly think it's kind of a weak item on him.  I think if you really want a self purge Euls is probably better as it gives more movement speed which seems to be the other justification for yasha.  The attack speed of yasha is ok once you have a butterfly, but the ability to spam skills with Euls would, IMO, make up for lost farm from attack speed.    Finally I still think that Travels are the way to go on Ember.  They give him too much and I'm surprised I don't see them on more pro embers lately.  They obviously have better grasps of the game, but I think that it's worth going for a little early game stuff (drums + Bottle) straight into travels due to how much it speeds up everything you do.  Also the move speed is massive on him."
TrueDoTA2,38gwn8,EDDE12345678,2,Thu Jun 4 16:16:44 2015 UTC,"Ember has great carry potential with bfury and crit but it take lots of gold to come online and vs instant disables your screwed as you don't get much hp items. On the other hand a ember with, tp, aquilla, treads, bottle  and two maelstroms is gonna do so much more for you than an ember with phase, bottle, wand, drums, tp and bfury which was the standered ember build for a long time. In the past you could often get away with this greed but nowadays there is so much focus on early agresion via ganking or deathballing with heroes such as qop, undying, dk, chen and clockwork that you simply can't get away with such a  greedy build unless vs a greedy lineup and/or one that is countered by the battle fury build (heroes like ck meepo etc) where battle fury gives tons of extra damage. Some great builds to play around with are the following  Utility build AKA puck build(if your team has lots of damage without you) BoT(or trainqs if not doing well) bottle wand, blink, euls pms suitable for mid or offlane ember or evamn suport if forced into it.  Late game one shot build(if your team is gonan have to take it late game yet has bad late gane damage) basicly just the cleave+crit build best on safelane ember or vary situationally on mid ember  shadow blade (great if you need to create space or if a  silver edge is need also if you have a wombo combo team with heroes like treant tide or magnus) this build is great because if you slight of fist just after you shadow blade you get the bonus damage of shadow blade on each sleight of fist attack and still be invis. I like this build quite a bit and your items in mid game will foten look like this Silver edge/shadow blade, boots, drums, aquilla, bottle and deso. This build is great on offlane, mid and situationally safelane!  -armor build( great if you have other -armor sources like wave of terror or if your snowballing hard and have other phisical damage dealers but not much in pushing power and in general if lacking pushing power or ability to do roshan) This is one of the best builds in 6.84 in my opinion with the desolator cost reduction and a more objective based meta its fantastic. Also this build is great with a shadow blade second item, mid game the build will probably look like  deso, boots, tp(unless you have BoT), bottle, aquilla and drums  Beefy build(if your team lacks a frontliner yet dosn't lack damage). This build might look like Skadi, drums, treads, wand, tp and bottle. This build focuses on being tanky and providing auras and debuffs for the enemy, making items such as ac, solar crest, vlads, skadi and drums great for this build its a great build for any core position.   Double maelstrom build( great if in a deathballl team and snowballing or versus one, great if your behind or just want more farm but need quicker contribution than a battle fury will offer) This item build might look like tp, drums, wand, treads and double maelstrom. It works on all core positions but probably best on safe lane and mid. Also only go mjolner if you have a hero that uses the shield well, just sell the maelstrom/s for a late game item in the super late game.  Items to consider that i have not mentioned yet  Urn of shadows: if doing well and desiring lots of tankyness   Manta style: good vs silences and your team requires you to do damage rather than have utility(so no euls build)  Bkb: Your go to item if your required to just initiate and deal damage vs a team that is prone to bkb's.  Linkins sphere: Good if you need to split push especially up against heroes like beast master or legion commander.  Guardian greaves/mek: situational if doing well your team, is focused around deathballing and your team just needs more sustain and tankness and the other heroes on your team for whatever eaason arn't as suitable/willing to get mek/GG boots.  Abyssal blade: Only really good late game versus magic imunity.  Sange and yasha: pretty good if you need more stats say versus lots of burst damage and/or you have a yahsa but manta isn't needed.  blademail: not that bad if quite behind and your team could use some tankyness(combined with stats items like wand, drums, aquilla and treads).  Daedlus/crystilus: both great if you need damage and no other item with utility is needed more.  Mkb: if needed for evasion.  Butterfly: if your being forced into manfights a lot and they have lots of rightclick but no one who is a natural mkb carrier.  Shivas/hex:both pretty good for the puck/utility build  vanguard/crimson guard: pretty good vs lots of small physical damage such as brood mother or troll warlord. Only really good on 3 position, especially if your job is to handle brood mother 1v1.  Difusel blade: Only really good vs warlock and omni.   satanic: pretty Good late game as it gives you tons of sustain and hp.  Heavens Helberd: Good id they have 1 hardcore right clicker like ursa or troll warlord.  Orchid: Pretty great if your doing well and you need to gank but they have lots of escapes(storm spirit, clinkz etc).  Necronomicon 3: Actually pretty good if you need pushing power and your team is a deathball based one especially if you have other necrobook carriers such as invoker beast master etc as their aura stacks.  E-blade:situationally vs right clickers in order to save people inside chrono or in omnislash.  All the other items i consider never to be the best one possible to get ay any given moment so that's it for items.  In terms of skill build you almost always wanna go max bolas and flame guard first with one point in ult than max sleight of fist and than stats in favour of maxing your ult (it dosn't scale well). Sometimes you might want to max blas and sleight of fist(ie vs tons of magic damage so that flame guard will instantly break or get a value point in it to set up stun or max it after going 4-0-3-1 because you would rather have sleight of fist than an extra 50 dmg and one second of bolas, also occasionally you might wanna max ult say in a wombo combo team where you want as much aoe burst damage as possible but those situations are rare.   In terms of positions i'd say mid is best as it will let you reach your early game power spike faster than safelane alowing you to get farmed for a great early game and letting you transition better for late/mid game next best position is offlane letting you get levels and contest the supports well with flame guard and support is not something you would ever want to do in my opinion unless you went offlane and got hard shutdown.  Any why contrary to popular belief ember is incredibly versatile."

TrueDoTA2,38gwn8,Defiled-,1 point,Thu Jun 4 22:16:26 2015 UTC,You can't just go BF and crit if you go mid. Ember has a good powerspike in the early-mid game which drops until he gets a lot of farm. The idea is you go these mid game items in order to help secure your dominance and lead for your team by actually being active.
TrueDoTA2,38gwn8,greenhatman99,1 point,Thu Jun 4 07:50:49 2015 UTC,"Remember that as good as battlefury is, it takes a while to farm. The current meta is very gank/kill gold oriented. So by the time you get the BF you will be too far behind and not contributing to fights which for and Ember is bad."
TrueDoTA2,38gwn8,lolfail9001,3,Thu Jun 4 10:35:27 2015 UTC,"Drums/Treads only help you contribute in really early fights, Ember is designed to fall off around 25-30 minute mark hardcore without damage items. If you invest fuckton into BS ala treads-drums and don't stomp the game, you are fucking done for."
TrueDoTA2,38gwn8,Ailodierap,1 point,Thu Jun 4 13:31:14 2015 UTC,"A lot of Embers go Manta because Silences counter him so hard, and move speed synergizes with his kit as well. I have even seen some players experimenting with Eul's as an alternative, or a supplement, but I haven't been too impressed with that. Aquila/Drums is pretty standard for him though, since his stat gain is so ass. I guess that's the same reasoning for picking up Treads, but that makes me feel like its a little bit of overkill as I feel like either Phase or a BoTS rush are too good on him to pass-up."
TrueDoTA2,38gwn8,Drop_,1 point,Thu Jun 4 14:33:34 2015 UTC,"Manta is honestly the worst self purge in the game.  It has the longest cooldown, high mana cost, and honestly Ember illusions are some of the worst in the game.    Euls is 2850 gold, 175 mana, and 23 second CD.    Manta is 4950, 165 mana, and 35 second CD.    Euls also gives more move speed (or it's roughly the same if you have travels).  You miss out on the damage / attack speed / hp of Manta, but 2100 gold goes a long way toward remedying that.  Plus ember can really leverage the mana regen of euls to increase his farm by more than the attack speed increases it.    Euls also gives him a lot more offensive utility.  You can set up easy searing chains by eulsing someone, walking up to where they'll fall, and chainsing.  You can also do things like euls, drop 3 remnants, activate them when he comes down, then chains, etc.   And while yeah, euls isn't as impressive on ember as some other items, neither is manta.  I can't remember the last time I was impressed with a manta ember.    I think going for a overall heavily midgame oriented ember would be interesting.  Drums + Aquilia + Treads + Euls.  Into lategame with something like Deso and Deadalus, and replacing treads with travels.    Anyhow, Euls is underrated on ember, particularly against silences."

TrueDoTA2,38fs0z,chadronsyoloswag,8,Wed Jun 3 22:42:07 2015 UTC,Quick question since I don't play Tusk much - Can you Walrus Punch from Shadow Blade invisibility? I know the bonus damage doesn't get added to your crit but do you keep the damage or does casting Punch remove it?
TrueDoTA2,38fs0z,DangerAwar,6,Wed Jun 3 23:04:28 2015 UTC,"Indeed, my good friend! The 175//225 damage gets added as a flat bonus on top of your punch. Just be sure to activate your armlet before you use shadow blade. I usually use alt+R to toggle autocast on walrus punch if I'm about to use it to make things easier."
TrueDoTA2,38fs0z,DangerAwar,5,Wed Jun 3 23:14:23 2015 UTC,"That's pretty useful then. I was thinking that it would be pretty shitty if you had to land the SB hit and then use Walrus Punch. As for your build, yeah, it's pretty strange that nobody's really thought of trying Armlet Tusk till now. Every time I've seen pros use him, he's a support who gets positioning tools to save people with Snowball, and while I think that Tusk makes a pretty good support, he doesn't seem like a particularly bad core, aside from his slow farming. And in this meta, slow farming isn't nearly as much of a handicap; with Armlet, Tusk can probably find some easy pickoffs and get huge. The only problem I have with this is, why Tusk? It seems like there are cores out there who can do more with less.  Sorry if any of that is just stupid or wrong, as I said most of my Tusk experience is from bot or lobby games. I've never really tried him in pubs."
TrueDoTA2,38fs0z,SendMeYourQuestions,3,Wed Jun 3 23:20:59 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't call his farming slow if you have mana,  shards and snowball can just about clear a wave or small stack of neutrals."
TrueDoTA2,38fs0z,DangerAwar,2,Thu Jun 4 02:50:06 2015 UTC,"Ah, you're right, I forgot that they lowered the Shards mana cost from 120 to 90. That makes a big difference in spamming it for CS."
TrueDoTA2,38fs0z,cantadmittoposting,1 point,Thu Jun 4 02:58:32 2015 UTC,Most people do land the SB hit and follow with walrus punch because a typical itemization uses medallion->solar crest.  Then the combo for a pure gank becomes    SB / Edge Attack (invis break proc) snowball  MoC Shards Walrus punch.   Edit: you can probably punch->shards for the same effect
TrueDoTA2,38fs0z,Thalnagath,-1,Thu Jun 4 15:06:20 2015 UTC,Armlet is very OP on STR heroes now. You need an extremely good reason not to get it now.

TrueDoTA2,38fs0z,sylvain_soliman,5,Thu Jun 4 18:30:29 2015 UTC,"Hmm, I'm a huge Armlet lover and have been meaning to pick up Tusk. Sounds interesting.  How does the damage output compare to say a Medallion (1.2k) or a Solar Crest (3k) or a Deso (3.5k)?  How does Armlet interact with Snowball? Can you toggle while in Snowball? Do you lose HP from the drain while you're in Snowball? I can foresee a lot of cute midgame plays with Armlet + Snowball, especially since it stuns when it lands, giving you the window to toggle up."
TrueDoTA2,38fs0z,phob,2,Thu Jun 4 00:42:35 2015 UTC,"How does Armlet interact with Snowball? Can you toggle while in Snowball?

TrueDoTA2,38fs0z,cantadmittoposting,2,Wed Jun 3 23:55:54 2015 UTC,"I love Medallion on him, but it sounds like OP's playstyle is centered around Shadow Blade ganks and immediate burst damage when breaking invis. Medallion falls short in that regard because, if you can Medallion them, they potentially have time to react. It sounds like OP doesn't have the item slots, or it would slow down his key burst items. He is also running Tusk in a solo core role, so he could potentially be encouraging his supports to pick it up for him."
TrueDoTA2,38fs0z,Slothtimistic,2,Thu Jun 4 15:32:48 2015 UTC,I'd say this is the typical reason for not seeing armlet on tusk

You can secure runes for mana while roaming from lane to lane. And runes on tusk are pretty big.

TrueDoTA2,38g9xy,PepperJohn,5,Thu Jun 4 00:38:49 2015 UTC,"There's a video on youtube I think by fierce about positioning - you should watch that. It does depend what support you're playing. If dazzle, for eg, hang back and heal teammates. If WD, walk to middle, ult, shadowblade.  Things to concentrate on are warding in the right spot (not just at the  runes all game), pulling (double pull always), zoning if possible, roaming and smoke ganks, controlling your team (tell them what to do)  munqster on youtube is a 6k player that plays 95% support - pretty good videos."

TrueDoTA2,38g9xy,SKjEi2,3,Tue Jun 9 04:04:45 2015 UTC,"Pick Rubick. Roleplay as Rubick. You are an immensely powerful mage, but you're really just in this battle as a spectator. Steal spells that you think look cool.   Seriously, though, it does sound like some of the issue is the players you're with. Don't worry. In most games at your (and my) levels, the support is not nearly as hardcore (i.e. you can take some last hits as long as your carry isn't taking it).  If they're too scared to last hit, ask yourself why? Is the enemy threatening them? Go behind the creep wave (so you don't draw aggro) and right click them to zone them out if you have ranged attacks. Zoning is when you attack the enemy carry or supports to move them out of the way. You can sometimes get away with this from a distance behind your creep wave, but it's usually easier and more efficient to wrap around and attack from a little behind their creep wave. The goal is to get them away from your creeps and also not to leech too much experience from your carry.  Good warding spots. There are videos on this, but obvious spots are the ones with eyes on them. Know who you're up against. You'll want a ward looking at your jungle if they have a ganker like Pudge, Ursa, or Clinkz. One thing I've learned is that you don't really want a ward that shows the MOST of the map. You want a ward that shows the most ROUTES to an area on the map. A good ward behind Radiant top tower can show you a sliver of the map, but is great because it shows you who is walking up behind the tower, who is going up to the SS/top rune, and who is going from top to mid.  You should also make sure you know how to pull and when to pull. Pulling is using jungle creeps near dire top or radiant bot to pull the respective lane creeps out of lane to let your wave push in. You want creeps to meet close to, but not under your towers so that your carry can farm the easiest. Learn the timings and you'll help your team when they want to gank someone or when they're at risk of being ganked."
TrueDoTA2,38g9xy,Whilyam,2,Thu Jun 4 01:17:57 2015 UTC,"I worded the description badly, I understand zoning, I just don't understand how to zone well. I understand to get wards against a certain lineup but I just don't know where to place most of these wards.   Managing gold is also something I find extremely hard. I can either spend 100 gold on a smoke or on a tp, I find with carry, you just farm the lane, if they have a ganking hero ask your support to get a ward to cover the jungle and you simply just get a good farming pattern, get some items and simply win the game.   I also find I die way too often because everyone always over commits on me, even if I am in the back and waiting for the initiator (Tide, Bat etc..) to go."
TrueDoTA2,38g9xy,Aesyn,4,Thu Jun 4 01:28:27 2015 UTC,"Gold for a support comes mostly from successful ganks (or successfully turned ganks) this patch. If you happen to stay alive after a kill or two, you'll begin to build up your bank.  Most of the passive gold gain goes towards wards/cour upgrade/dust/smoke/tp scrolls. When you pull of a few successful ganks, you'll have a surge of gold so you can begin to work towards those items like arcane/force staff whatever. Only thing I don't delay is the brown boots.  If there's no kills/assists for you in the foreseeable future, double pulling the jungle is the way to go. Though I find last hitting neutrals are a bit harder, I think there's something funky with their hp bars, so try not to miss those last hits. (In this part, you might want to pick some supports who can farm jungle easily like Crystal Maiden until you get used to)  Also apart from the obvious ward spots around the rune, there are few lane wards which helps your team (generally your carry) immensely. If you are gonna roam/jungle, you might want to put a ward in front of their t1 tower(outside of its range). This lets you see the river entrance, tp's to their tower and jungle entrance from the safelane. As a result you won't be ganked directly from their offlane unless they use smoke. Another similar ward spot is anywhere around middle of the map, when you lose t1 mid tower you also lose a lot of control there so try to regain it by using wards.  Another good ward place is between the t1 and t2 towers middle. The exact place does not matter that much. There are lots of rotations going on there so you'll get a lot of information. This one is for mid-game.  Also whenever pushing t1 towers, you might want to put a ward behind their towers so you'll see them coming a bit earlier. This also works for keeping an eye on their carry, so you might choose best time to gank him.   There are few focus points in jungle you can ward. Most known is directly below the radiant hard camp in the middle for example. Just try not to block the camps with wards because they can easily figure out where your wards are this way. Legit wards in every stage of the game, helps with spotting rotations, and ganking jungle farmers.  When you get familiar with these spots, you'll find that every spot is a ward spot. Just ask yourself, do I need ward to keep us safe from ganks, or spot their rotations between lanes(helps with pushing/aggresive farming), or spot them farming so we can gank them. Then try to figure out where would they be and drop a ward. Don't be afraid to waste a smoke so you can ward deep in their jungle, chances are your pub aren't gonna utilize them anyway and that ward might be more useful.  edit: I forgot to talk about ancient wards. People generally try to ward enemy ancients while having the vision of rune with the same ward. That works, but if you actually want to gank them, try to put the ward a little further (to their escape path). (Dire: somewhere around secret shop, Radiant: somewhere around ancients entrance in front of the t2 middle tower, put the ward in high ground of course). They are also hot spots for rotations so those wards spot lots of things.  And as a note, always have some kind of vision around roshan pit."

TrueDoTA2,38g9xy,pepe_le_shoe,1 point,Thu Jun 4 11:28:01 2015 UTC,"I just don't understand how to zone well.   They key is learning the xp ranges, and knowing if the enemy is in them, and if you are able to push them out.  You have two goal states:  1) enemy laner(s) out of xp range  2) enemy laner in xp range sometime, but unable to get last hits or denies.  Obviously the first is better, but often with a 2v2 lane you are stuck with aiming for the second. Constantly keep track of the enemy tango/health pots. If they get low on health and look like they're going back to use a health pot, chase them and break it. If they are using a tango, you have to make a judgment - will the tango heal them to full health before ending (115), and thus waste some of it? if so, don't harass, you'll be increasing the value of their tango (Good players won't usually make this mistake, but it's a good efficiency gain that's easy to do, and punishing poor players is your job). If the tango will not take them to full hp, just keep harassing as normal. If you stop harassing while they have a tango active, they will feel safe coming in for last hits while their regen is high - don't let them feel safe.  Are you behind the trees where the enemy can't see you? Get back behind the trees.  Get in to the habit of immediately deny-clicking a friendly creep after every harass hit on the enemy - that way, if you ever accidentally draw creep aggro (try not to do this), you'll get rid of it.   I also find I die way too often because everyone always over commits on me, even if I am in the back and waiting for the initiator (Tide, Bat etc..) to go.   An important thing to learn is that 'the back' is quite a fluid thing. Depending on the stage of the game, the enemy heroes, and your team's positions, even hugging a tower is not safe. You have to learn to be able to know when a tower can no longer protect you. There will come a time when your enemy can safely dive you under a T1/2/3, and you need to know if they can or not. and if they can, you leave altogether, or you get way way back, back to the tower behind the one they are pushing. You are not the initiator, if a fight breaks out, you go along and join in once it starts. If your team aren't initiating, there isn't a fight, so get out of there. Go to another lane, push it out, farm a camp somewhere if it's safe - just stay away from the enemy. You don't go near the enemy if your team aren't with you."
TrueDoTA2,38g9xy,jjohn268,1 point,Thu Jun 4 11:38:58 2015 UTC,"For ward placement, it really comes with experience. Obviously there are the common: river wards, the high points, the two you can put in the enemy base, ancients, etc. But these have a high chance of being dewarded.   There is a map someone made on viable ward spots, and you should also experiment yourself. One thing I found useful was watching replays of my own matches, you can see where opponents were warding,and use those spots in the future."
TrueDoTA2,38g9xy,OverweightPlatypus,2,Thu Jun 4 12:07:26 2015 UTC,"Don't know how 'highly experienced' I am at support, but here is what I do(3.2k ranked, but greater than 3.7k unranked).  Carry a TP early, and counter-gank often. The biggest thing I find is that enemies LOVE to dive, but are bad at actually diving. As soon as you see the enemy start diving TP in immediately(if its safe to do so) and help get the kill on the enemy. Think of it this way: If you get the kill you get like 200 gold. A TP costs 100 gold. If you don't get the kill, you lose 100 gold and some time. If the enemy gets the kill, your carry loses gold, and they get gold. In other words, its much better to TP in, lose a bit of gold and time in the worst case scenario, than it is to let your teammate die. Of course, all of this is relative to who you're playing and how the game is going, but generally in the laning stage pre-10 mins, this is what you want to try and do.  Supports are strongest pre-20 mins. Any gold they get only extends that effective strength time by a bit, or helps them be even stronger in their 20 mins of peak strength. Use that to your advantage. Roam and try to step up kills as much as you can.  Ward effectively. A lot of the times I see players just ward the top and bottom runes in the same exact spot because they don't know where else to put a ward. Think of warding like this: Where do you want to secure for the next 6 minutes? Runes are good places to ward, but sometimes there are other places that are better. Like the mid-lane on the high-ground on the enemy side. It gives your mid-laner a significant advantage, and you get to see when you could possibly rotate in for a kill.  At your level, play strong supports with good killing potential that punishes mistakes. Witch Doctor is a very solid choice, because his Death Ward annihilates the enemy team if they don't shut you down. Disruptor is also quite good, but he's a little difficult to play."
TrueDoTA2,38g9xy,truncatedusern,2,Fri Jun 5 13:13:10 2015 UTC,"I'm around 4.1k and primarily a support player.  Although I've grown to enjoy playing this role for its own sake, the main reason I usually choose support heroes is because, even at this tier, I see a lot of common and avoidable mistakes from other support players that can make it very difficult for their team to win.  One of the biggest problems I see is that people pick support heroes without embracing the support role.  They farm instead of babysit, gank, or defend, and they spend their limited gold on offensive items instead of prioritizing support items.    You mentioned that you buy wards - this is good, because it's one of a support's most important jobs.  However, I see a lot of people buy one or two observer wards occasionally, and get defensive when they're asked to buy more.  When you are playing a dedicated support role, you should buy ALL the observer wards, ALL THE TIME.  If you ever see them come off cooldown in the shop, buy them.  If there are ever more than two wards in the shop at any point in the game, you have not been buying enough wards.  And don't tell me that you don't have enough money to buy wards when I can look in your inventory and see all the other, less important, items that you have been buying.  Wards are more important than your boots, more important than your wand, more important than your mek (more important than pretty much anything you want to buy, except for possibly a tp scroll).  At your MMR, map awareness is not a strength for many players, which is a shame because it is one of the most important and generally useful skills for you to develop as a player.  It may feel like your wards are going to waste because your teammates still aren't very aware of what is happening on the map.  It is very likely, for example, that they will become so focused on their farming that they don't see an otherwise obvious incoming gank.  This is a perfect chance for you to practice your own map awareness and make yourself even more of an asset to your team.  Watch the spots that you've warded, and call out ganks and rotations to your teammates.  If you see an incoming gank and you're not nearby, teleport to your teammate to back him up.  This is one of the ways that a support hero can have a large, positive effect on the outcome of the game.  When your team goes on the offensive (either pushing or ganking), use that opportunity to place offensive wards.  (Don't go into the enemy jungle while your team is farming its own side of the map.)  These enable safer and more successful pushing and ganking, especially as you move into the mid- to late-game."
TrueDoTA2,38g9xy,unr4v3l,2,Thu Jun 4 04:17:06 2015 UTC,"Tbh at your mmr you should focus on snowballing asap, instead of selfless supporting. People at your mmr dont even lasthit well, and dont even know good farming pattern. If you are solid at playing core you should take that role for team."
TrueDoTA2,38g9xy,darren_kill,2,Thu Jun 4 14:10:42 2015 UTC,"I dunno, I've found playing a support with decent game input can really be useful around this mmr. Noone wants to play support because they think kills are the most important, but a well warded map is IMO. If you play a hero with strong zoning and can roam for kills after you secure lane, you're already half way to winning the game. I've been playing WD, Silencer and VS, where once you win lane just rotate for kills while carry farms lane (generally carry is useless at low levels because they have no impact until 40 mins when the game is already won or lost). All you have to do is make sure good wards are put up while you roam for kills to make sure carry is safe."
TrueDoTA2,38g9xy,cantadmittoposting,2,Thu Jun 4 02:26:50 2015 UTC,"This isn't good generic advice honestly.  If a 5k woke up tomorrow with a 2k mmr account, he'd find it trivial to win with virtually any hero regardless of the entire rest of the game, it just happens snowballing heroes are the fastest way to win.  A good impact 5 position can turn a game in to a win easily even with marginal/average carries."

I see what you're saying but a 5k in 2k games even if they picked a support hero wouldn't play a ""proper support"" and zone and concentrate on warding and support items, they would run around killing everyone and buy greedy items and generally turn their support into the most farmed hero in the game."
TrueDoTA2,38g9xy,TheMoeBlob,2,Thu Jun 4 15:27:03 2015 UTC,"This advice isn't great. I feel it is much better to play support because, if you are a good player, then you can actually make the plays that the team needs and get your cores to snowball.  If you win the first 10 minutes of the game because your supports can get stuff done then you more often than not can win the game because no one believes a come back is possible. Gank the enemy mid enough to make him tilt and then watch the rest of his team fall apart as they blame the ""noob mid"" for feeding."
TrueDoTA2,38g9xy,SendMeYourQuestions,1 point,Sat Jun 6 17:16:05 2015 UTC,"Support is all about anticipation. For vision control  you look at the map and the objectives and the relative strengths of both teams and predict where they will be spending the next 5 minutes and place wards there. Where they think you'll be, you place sentries there. With laning or team fighting, know where they want to go, or who they want to go on, and protect that space / player.   Support is all about strategy and anticipation. Predict your enemies strategy and you are a good support.   This extends to things like meta game strategy too. Stacking, pulling, blocking enemy neutrals, all these tools can be used to accomplish something (launch your carries into power faster, control lane positioning for safe farming, slowing down enemy carries) are things you should think about when deciding how to beat your opponent.   Does that help? Carries are the super soldiers, supports are the tacticians."
TrueDoTA2,38g9xy,WhompWump,1 point,Thu Jun 4 15:53:26 2015 UTC,"Support is an interesting position  The best supports are going to have an understanding of the game on a level that they can plan and look out for what's going to happen. Thinking about what the other team is doing and placing wards at important spots, helping get ganks off, getting that crucial disable in the team fight. When you compound it all together it is a very complex position.   The way I see it support is playing off the metagame. You're not going to be the one (more than likely) rolling through their team like a carry, but you can be his sidekick riding on his shoulder pointing out the enemies after you've set traps to make it easier for him to catch them. Through warding ganking and harrassing among ways to be a nuisance for the other team.  It's kind of like american football with an offensive line. When they're bad the team suffers, but when they're good it makes the rest of the team look a whole lot better.  edit: realized this was more of a rant and didn't really hit the point well. Basically I think the best advice for playing support is to just keep playing and learn the game. When you know the characters and their weaknesses and strengths, learning game situations (are they going to rosh now? Is someone in jungle? Could they be ganking now? Can I gank now? etc. etc.) will help you efficiently know where to ward, how to effectively harass/zone, when and how to gank, etc. Remember as a support you have a lot of influence even if it's not just through mowing people down like a carry, help set your team up to be able to tear through people."
TrueDoTA2,38g9xy,_tpyo,1 point,Thu Jun 4 06:32:17 2015 UTC,"You don't understand zoning? Perhaps I can help. As a carry I hope you appreciate how to hold a lane in place where you want it? So assuming the carry knows how to hold the lane we don't want to pull because that will spoil it. What we want to do is fight either 2v1 or 1v1 against the enemy offlaner without any creeps joining in. This drains the offlaner of their consumables and xp allowing your carry to get all the gold and xp and resulting in them being able to solo the lane ASAP against a weakened offlaner a little bit later on. Your perfect 4 minute timing is the support and offlaner with almost zero consumables and zero xp and the carry with as much gold and xp as possible. Then you can roam at the first night with the rune and your carry should be fine alone, stack some camps, jungle a bit if you can or double pull (it would be okay at this point as the gap in xp between solo offlaner and carry has been established).    So with that in mind lets look at a pretty picture:    http://i.imgur.com/2fxwuZJ.jpg  This is basically where you want to start your fight with the offlaner at the start of creeps clashing. Consider using a tango (I buy two sets myself) before starting the fight. The ranged creep is super important to maintain the equilibrium of the lane and does a fair amount of damage so you never ever want to pull its aggro. If the lane is pushed to far to make this position possible without taking aggro from that creep you pretty much have to pull.    That's more or less zoning in a nutshell. Just remember some heroes suck at this (CM and pretty much any melee except maybe Ogre) whereas others excel (Dazzle, Shadow Demon, Silencer).    In terms of dying too much some tips:     HIDE. Never be visible, when your team pushes highground for example you pretty much want to be hiding somewhere almost a screen behind them before the fight starts. FARM. Just because you're playing support doesn't mean you don't get gold. It took me a very long time to realise this yourself. CM and Shadow Demon do great @ farming jungle and CM especially needs her tranqs asap. SD wants tranqs + soul ring. If a lane needs farming and the team shouldn't be fighting now then take that gold. If there are creeps you can take, if a lane needs pushing, if your team is too stupid to farm the jungle or take the lovely stacks (great supports stack very often and can even double stack by using abilities) you've made. BUY HP. Bracer, Point booster, Urn. All fantastic items. Buy them.   and   SMOKE GANK. Once you've established your carry's dominance check to see if you can gank. Is your mid lane strong enough to get a kill? Is your offlaner (smoke and tp)? Do you need a couple of more levels yourself first? Is it night-time? Wait for the correct moment and gank. If you can't gank then stack/ward/pull/protect runes or just hang around backing up a team mate that you think will get ganked themselves."
TrueDoTA2,38g9xy,goblinbiddin,1 point,Thu Jun 4 10:21:41 2015 UTC,"Generally, compared to core, supports want to stand back, preferably out of sight, the fog is your friend. if you're having trouble keeping tps in your inventory as a support you're probably using them too much. after the laning phase, try not to use your tp unless you're actually teleporting TO something, not just ""back to lane."" Supports can benefit a lot from just dealing with walking places (and tranquils are an excellent way to do this)  As for warding, i'm going to get flamed for this, but just keep the wards up over the runes for most of the game. Yes, it's not always correct, but it's rarely all that wrong. The rune spots are high traffic areas, and you'll be able to see ganks coming fairly easily, and also see where enemies are isolated (gank when you can generate a local numbers advantage, warding is essential to knowing when you can do this)  I may write a piece on supporting, as there is a lot to say about it, but for now the posts I've written on Mid and Late game decision making and attacking the laning phase may be of some help to you, or at least the bits of them that relate to supporting.

Well that lies in two things. Making your deaths worthwhile and making yourself as useful as possible without farming. Try to watch pro players playing support. See how they die (usually as a sacrifice for a teammate or in an initiation), watch their early game movements, and just learn stuff about individual supports. Support heroes are diverse and have many different things you can do with them. In fact, most every role that cores can fill, can also by filled by a support. They just do less, and don't farm."

By way of example, I often find myself playing offlane when I captain, because many people just don't know how to play the role. I also have to steer clear of picking heroes like puck, ember or lycan for mid, because most pub-midders cannot play these heroes in the mid lane. Also, most pub supports have no idea how to play AA in my experience."
TrueDoTA2,38fid1,pepe_le_shoe,2,Thu Jun 4 12:19:10 2015 UTC,"My best role is offlane, in general, but i like to communicate with my team during drafting to figure out what heroes and roles they like to play, and i've found myself filling every role at one point or another when drafting. Generally i'll only pick heroes i'm sure nearly everyone can play unless i get a specific request, or i'm picking a hero for myself."
TrueDoTA2,38fid1,Ailodierap,2,Thu Jun 4 15:12:41 2015 UTC,"I feel your ""core"" terminology is a little offbase. A core is someone who is allocated a higher priority of farm, but that doesn't mean they're going to be farming in lane early on. An offlane Lich would probably see less farm then the 4 position Crystal Maiden in the first 10 minutes, but getting him accelerated to his ult would be why he was designated a core, while the Maiden is using her farm to get wards up and is pulling/stacking for her carry. You sort of re-iterate this in your ""Choosing an Offlaner"" section where you reference their low farm environment and how they need to ensure they're applying pressure.  Besides that small nitpick I thought this was a great read. I think your mid section could potentially be expanded to discuss the farming mid style for heroes like Morphling or Naga Siren, but I haven't seen too much of those outside of the competitive environment in 6.84. Great write-up and also great job formatting. I particular enjoyed the ""Winning Your Lanes"" section, which I think is underappreciated among most people in my MMR.  I think you could potentially add in some more information about the current meta and discuss drafting a little bit more in-depth with specific examples. An example might be a small list of heroes who are easily counter-picked and should never be picked early (i.e. Broodmother, Huskar, or a heavy heal team without banning AA) and a small list of heroes who make great early picks in almost any draft and allow you to structure your strategy around them (i.e. Centaur). This might be more specific then you are looking to get though, since this article seems based around empowering a player to critically think, as opposed to a reference guide.  When do you usually draft your mid hero, or what criteria do you consider before doing so? What determines your drafting order? I normally see the generic recommendation be ""draft your supports, then your offlaner, then your carry, then your mid"", but obviously that varies a lot based on securing key heroes."
TrueDoTA2,38fid1,ancoree,3,Thu Jun 4 14:29:58 2015 UTC,"I use ""core"" to basically mean anything that isn't a support, and a support to mean someone who doesn't have a lane to farm during the laning stage, people use ""core"" to mean so many things that i won't be able to make everyone happy with a single definition, so i merely explained how i use it.  I would get more specific, but this post is already quite long winded as it is, I would probably prefer to write a new post on the kinds of things you're talking about in detail.  Right now I like to lead with a support and take a carry 4th, as i feel like that tends to leave me open enough, but, again, viper is a very strong hero, and i'll often take him over a second support in the first phase if i'm just not all that excited about the supports that are left in the pool. I'll often pick my offlaner last, first of all because i will often have snapped up a viper early in the draft, and second of all because my personal best offlaner is nyx, which no one ever seems to pick or ban.  However, this is all dependent on what's left on the board and what i see my opponent having. for example if i see a melee support and a melee carry early on in the draft, i'll snap up a dark seer or tidehunter on the spot, to punish that.  Still, I feel that generally picking supports early in the draft, especially supports that are strong in lane, leaves you open and therefore better equipped to react to what your opponent is doing.

I mean, many people are just bad at mid (ahem, me) so avoid it like the plague and don't know what certain match ups are like.  I like the idea of flexible picks (the WL example) and opening with two supports/cores isn't always a good move. But when they leave both Gyro and Undying (happened recently to me), take them.  One question: when you pick your own hero do you ask the opinions of your team? What you would like to play may influence what you think could be a good pick."

Meanwhile if its 70 min in the game, your carry doesn't have buy back, and he decides to go farm clear on the other side of the map, with no vision, with all heroes missing, without his team (say he just greedly BoT there) and instantly gets picked off by 5, in which enemy quickly ends game because carry doesn't have buy back, that was a feed.  To me its similar to the metaphor, if you feed someone, you provide them (net) substance for growth. If its simply careless, with no purpose, then it is a feed.  Intentional feeding is obvious.  note: Just because you are support, does not excuse your deaths. That is such a stupid mindset to have.

What I think is that while he would do great in the mid/lategame, the super mobile early game aggression metagame with heroes like Spirit Breaker, QoP and Bloodseeker put so much pressure that it's hard for Timber to really have some space. I'm not sure yet I have to play him a couple of times more but if these BS / SB kind of heroes stay FotM I fear that Timbersaw won't really shine."
TrueDoTA2,38e4b8,Sbsvn,3,Wed Jun 3 17:31:50 2015 UTC,"Completely agree. Timber is strong against the right lineup, which includes not have some of the most popular picks. QoP, SB, Bloodseeker, Clock, Rubick etc all do really well against him.  I've played him a few times and if he doesn't get off to a good start it's so hard to do well on him. Octaine is great as a 5thish item, but it's just too difficult to get there. Items like Euls/Blink can help with this and do well against his counters, but that's money not toward your bloodstone/aghs/sheep/shivas.   The hero itself isn't bad, but his place in the meta might not be."
TrueDoTA2,38e4b8,pastplayer,3,Wed Jun 3 21:22:51 2015 UTC,"Sure. I think timbersaw is a hero that requires too much space early as an independent off laner. He can't initiate on anyone with full health before hex, euls, or Dagon.   He is easily zoned out of farming and sometimes even of xp range. And cannot catchup in the jungle. He catches up through winning bad harass games and trades with heroes that can't out man fight reactive armor and his nukes. And he overly relies on allies being in combo range to the point where even if they jukes tree angles they are dead.   He does well once he finds the right item threshold to stay alive, usually the right amount of HP. From there his AOE damage with levels really prevents heroes from extending under towers or sometimes just even near trees.  People get away without building early game or defensive items on him and I feel it's a huge reason timbers with late bloodstones or sometimes even timely bloodstones could do a lot more in the game by patching up his weakest stage: early game.   Things like basilius or PMS aren't bought enough on him. Urn, treads, and even the new solar crest transition well for him. Euls,and blade mail often will secure more than an early bloodstone if timber is allowed to fight instead of farm.   I think timber is a mid hero or position 2 priority hero more than an off laner. He does well versus QOP, puck, and gyro.   His late game is super strong. Aghs is good. First big item hex or linkens is underrated.  Lotus orb is untapped amazement. Removes silences, gives regen and armor. Makes nuke. Burst trades wins for timber."
TrueDoTA2,38e4b8,wildtarget13,5,Wed Jun 3 17:55:48 2015 UTC,"I dunno my experience with timber indicates the mana problems solved by first item bloodstone are pretty critical.  Timber is already situational, but being pure damage, it really seems like he's pretty much equipped to rock already... he's missing the sustain needed to do so is all. He flash farms amazingly well, counters str melee heroes exceptionally, and cuts through most defenses (short of bkb) quite well. High mana - providing items just seem so natural that delaying them seems very dangerous to me..."
TrueDoTA2,38e4b8,cantadmittoposting,0,Wed Jun 3 20:01:18 2015 UTC,"As good as it is to focus on bolstering timber's mana pool. Bloodstone is a snowball item. It does so through the infite nature of his mana regen and how HP prevents you from dying and feeding streaks.  Similarly, I find that staying alive in general keeps timber's farm way up. Resistances,stats, and armor are things that most timbers neglect while finding bloodstone. And usually it becomes a mindset that bloodstone is as core as say a blink dagger on an initiator, which it is not.   He flash farms well with mana and usually needs HP regen only to tank through long fights, which are made longer by...guess what, staying alive. Reactive armor does okay, but I played with a friend who was farmed on timber, but went blood>Aghs>octarine. He ended up dying a lot to amplify damage. It was a huge mistake many people probably would fix with shivas after bloodstone, but bloodstone+shivas is way too expensive for a hero that half the time is an offlaner and who knows out of either scenarios gets enough farm through kills.  Just downgrading those items in my head to mid game and early game items seems logical to me. Urn gives HP and 50% regen. It's not a lot, but it gives utility early too. Solar crest/medallion give utility too. Usually blademail is more standard for midgame price though and gives int.  About INT and stats. As good as bloodstone's regen is. You don't have Aghs, let's assume were still talking first 5k item. Bloodstone vs Hex and linkens seem too bloodstone favored by people. The 150% mana regen from Hex is made stronger by the INT it provides. I'm sure I can't crunch these numbers without looking up how mana regen works, but I always know that more INT gives more mana pool and regen. Bloodstone does the same thing but it tied to how well to get bloodstone charges and how often you don't lose them.   For storm spirit, bloodstone is the item you get when you deternimne the midgame is coming around and heroes will have BKBs and you can't silence them.  For Timber, it's the opposite. A bloodstone makes timber a strong tanky force to be reckoned with, but versus many matchups, will leave him weaker than say a hex initiation.   Another way too look at it is this, if they have orchid carriers or hex initiatiors. Linkens will makes their life harder to initiate on you, as well as giving HP and MP regen, and stats to make both of those stronger."
TrueDoTA2,38e4b8,wildtarget13,1 point,Wed Jun 3 23:40:05 2015 UTC,"Sure. I think timbersaw is a hero that requires too much space early as an independent off laner. He can't initiate on anyone with full health before hex, euls, or Dagon.   Why do you say he needs Hex, Eul's or Dagon? Sure, in some cases I go for Hex or Eul's, but they are REALLY situational items. He works very well without them.   He is easily zoned out of farming and sometimes even of xp range. And cannot catchup in the jungle. He catches up through winning bad harass games and trades with heroes that can't out man fight reactive armor and his nukes. And he overly relies on allies being in combo range to the point where even if they jukes tree angles they are dead.    I disagree with this as well. Thanks to Reactive Armor, he can only really be zoned by trilanes. A single support doesn't do much against him, especially if he has good aggro management and gets a few armor stacks from creeps whenever he can. Thanks to that, keeping a level advantage during the laning stage should be an easy thing. Since initiation on his own require seither a blunder in the enemies' positioning or them to be overly aggressive, you usually try to counter-initiate, wait for a gank or, when you reach lvl 6 or feel confident enough, bait them into attacking you.   I think timber is a mid hero or position 2 priority hero more than an off laner. He does well versus QOP, puck, and gyro.    Not really. He can stand in the midlane, but unless the enemy is a melee hero it usually isn't a good lane for him. He's a melee with no proper harassment tool against ranged heroes."
TrueDoTA2,38e4b8,Infrisios,1 point,Thu Jun 4 06:58:33 2015 UTC,"I say that he has no initiation because if he has let's say bloodstone, his initiation is timberchain to a good, if possible, angle to get a multiple or single man chakram. If they get to half health through his damage alone then they are slowed to point where they become possible to kill. If not, you've just thrown a nuke at them.   If you euls someone, it's like one inch closer, but at least you can reliably get chakram+whirling off on them. Dagon can ensure they you at least get the chakram slow off depending on the game state.  If timbersaw gets an angle for all three spells and the enemy team has to run away from him while he's on top of them, then the game is already in a weird space where the offlaner or mid is owning too hard and the enemy team doesn't have the appropriate HP or burst damage to kill timber.  I think that timber is a good offlaner if he gets level 2. If he doesn't, he's impossibly behind. If he gets reactive to play with aggro tricks, he has no chain. If he has chain, it's extremely possible to kill him as he has no armor. Not to mention if one support can keep timber from freefarming in lane versus a safe laner, timber won't have enough farm usually. Boots first doesn't seem like timber and I feel if he goes stout and stay in XP range, he'll barely get level two safely unless the supports are busy elsewhere like mid or being greedy with junglers.  I feel that timber isn't being picked right now because these points are super straightforward and it doesn't take more than one support to prevent his level 2. If they feel one support can't do it, two supports can secure that timber can't contest the carries farm after he leaves usually. From there, the assumption that timber will get good farm even if the supports don't zone him. Timber is paper without items and level advantage and will die to burst damage. If players chase him, sure he'll have options, but if he has to make the pressure himself, he cannot do so without putting himself in danger.  I feel that for the reasons that I'm saying timber can't handle the offlane, he's suited better to be the mid hero: he needs many value points to start laning well.   People usually say there aren't enough trees to utilize timber mid, but I feel that isn't what you would say first. He is a melee hero, but usually the lane turns into one of these two situations. He's versus a lane bully like SF or QOP and has the option to get reactive armor and safely last hit. If he is versus other standard ranged heroes, he can skill his q first and secure last hits with Q, securing his first wave and level 2, and zone while he rushes a bottle."

But the current early teamfight meta really fucks him over, I struggle to find the space to farm the necessary items.

TrueDoTA2,38e4b8,PITN,1 point,Thu Jun 4 12:53:04 2015 UTC,"Timber can get a lot of use out of arcanes, a soul ring, and a single point in his reactive armor. It's 300 mana a minute,  provided you are dropping the arcanes whenever you soul ring. And that's just what you keep,  if you don't use the temporary mana. With a bottle,  you're ready to rock and roll for roaming and team fights.   However, bottle isn't always viable if you can't get it fast. The most viable time to pick timber is versus multiple strength heroes. There are only two ranged strength heroes in the game, which means the vast majority of them are incredibly vulnerable."
TrueDoTA2,38e4b8,Jackolope,1 point,Wed Jun 3 22:19:21 2015 UTC,"He's a very good hero but against some lineups (against heroes such as Skywrath, Witch Doctor, etc.) he becomes a liability.  Pick him against STR hero-heavy lineups and with a team that already has a lot of stuns, as well as with a Pos. 1 who can take full advantage of the space you provide.  Build Bloodstone as your first item if you're balling out of control, Eul's first if you need a little help and there's a silence or two ruining your day. Consider BKB if you find yourself getting chain-stunned; Linken's is even a good idea on occasion. Then you eventually want to get Sheepstick, and then Agh's into Octarine.  The thing with Timber is that you don't need to ""ball out of control"" to get these fancy items. He's an absurdly good farmer, and even more so upon getting Agh's."
TrueDoTA2,38e4b8,_Muddy,1 point,Thu Jun 4 01:07:16 2015 UTC,I used to play quite a lot Timbersaw and recently picked up Octarine Core - Its honestly only good as 4th or 5th item - you always want bloodstone + aghs + shivas/hex/blink as they increase your impact more than octarine core - it is nice as a kind of overkill item at the end of the match to seal the deal and provide the power to fight inside of their base   tl;dr good in super lategame but situational
TrueDoTA2,38e4b8,minesterdota,1 point,Thu Jun 4 03:01:45 2015 UTC,"Items:  You should consider throwing in an armor item. I usually get a casual platemail after my Bloodstone (sometimes I go for other items of course, like a chainmail into Blademail or even Crimson Guard).  If the enemies don't care much for physical damage it isn't that important, but getting some basic armor really helps you to block huge amounts of damage before you got stacks.  My only fixed point is going for Bloodstone, after that it really depends on what I feel I need. Aghanim's is, of course, always a good item to go for. But if the game is going really bad and a mobile hero with silence and similar disables is what's killing me, I sometimes consider rather unconventional items like Glimmer Cape or Lotus Orb.  Octarine Core, while definitely a great item, is so expensive that calling it a core item on him is a bit of an exaggeration. You should of course go for it after Bloodstone/Aghs, but actually getting it is not the most common thing.  Skillbuild:  That's a bit of a cookiecutter build, I don't vary much.  A point in Reactive Armor to stand harassment, 1/1/1 by 3 for both lasthitting and escaping, max Timberchain, then Whirling Death. Get Ult whenever possible. Against heroes with Illusions or summons, a second point in Reactive Armor can be useful. Timing of that depends on the situation."

Besides the arguable pick-ups of Battlefury and/or Aghanims, he has no real mana solutions besides Tread switching and Wand. None of these are great solutions to the fact his combo (Time Walk + MoM + Chrono) requires 265/340/415 mana. At lv6 with Int Treads his combo requires 67% of his total mana pool. At lv16 with Int Treads his combo requires 70% of his total mana pool. That's a combination of not enough mana, yes, but there's also no real incentive to go items that bolster that mana pool, and there is a large need for great amounts of mana to complete his combinations in team fights."

Void isn't one of them, he needs other items with much higher priority.  Imagine a Void who just MoM'd to clear the enemy jungle, when he gets spotted by a hero with good chasing abilities (say, SB or Slark). Void may have to Timewalk away more than once, using up his mana. Meanwhile, heroes from both teams converge towards those 2, and a fight breaks out nearby.

He doesn't need anything from shadowblade except for the attack speed which he can get easily from other sources. Battlefury is maybe a little more acceptable now with the quelling blade change as it will increase your farm rate. I think it's okay if you have a synergistic team that allows you to chrono and not rely on your own damage output.   I haven't looked at your dota buff to see your games, but are you just picking void because you want to play him? Do you find yourself countered or without synergy for chronological on your team? There's a lot of factors that could be at play.   I think void is fine in this meta. He provides some team fight as soon as he hits 6 and without farm.

With his mana issues I've been trying   treads -> maybe aquila -> morbid -> diffusal -> whatever the game calls for  skills would be  2-1-2-1 or 1-1-3-1 at 6.  The build isn't great for taking out multiple enemies but it will take one person out fast. Diffusal gives him mana and damage aswell as draining your opponents man so even if they do survive they can't do anything.

TrueDoTA2,38aj3z,pepe_le_shoe,2,Fri Jun 5 08:56:57 2015 UTC,"Too expensive for the contribution it provides. PA already has 50% evasion, so you only get half the effectiveness of the evasion you'd normally get with Solar crest, plus the enemy team doesn't need more of a reason to buy MKB.    Medallion is good because of how cheap it is. The added cost of Solar Crest is half the cost of deso. It's far better to work towards deso instead."
TrueDoTA2,38aj3z,pwnies,3,Wed Jun 3 20:02:06 2015 UTC,"PA seems decent right now, I think the best build would be something like:  Treads(or)Phase/Aquila/Lifesteal(Any)/BKB/Basher, Silver Edge, Deso, SNY, Skadi, pretty much what ever you need for the current game.  But honestly builds aren't static, and should change around the game, hope this brief outline helps in your matches :)"
TrueDoTA2,38aj3z,fragilefigures,-2,Wed Jun 3 00:18:23 2015 UTC,You don't need BKB that early.
TrueDoTA2,38aj3z,Thalnagath,2,Wed Jun 3 16:00:26 2015 UTC,"Depends on the enemy lineup. If they have stuns that don't go through bkb, then you need it asap."
TrueDoTA2,38aj3z,pepe_le_shoe,-1,Thu Jun 4 11:45:18 2015 UTC,"No, you don't. Stop playing her like a STR hero.  If you rush bkb basher they're just going to ignore you because you have no damage.  And your bkb will only be 5 sec when you actually have damage.  You should never get bkb on any hero until you have damage first."
TrueDoTA2,38aj3z,Thalnagath,1 point,Thu Jun 4 11:49:17 2015 UTC,"If you rush bkb basher they're just going to ignore you because you have no damage.   When did I say rush bkb basher?  I said you want bkb asap if they have stuns that don't go through bkb.    You should never get bkb on any hero until you have damage first   This is an over-generalisation. I sometimes get it as my first big item on sb or lesh, depending on the situation."
TrueDoTA2,38aj3z,pepe_le_shoe,1 point,Thu Jun 4 12:26:38 2015 UTC,Lesh is an exception because he already has damage.  You never make bkb before you have damage. A PA that makes bkb as her first item will just be ignored because she won't be a threat.
TrueDoTA2,38aj3z,Thalnagath,2,Thu Jun 4 16:31:08 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I thought you were saying you never get bkb before you have a damage item."
TrueDoTA2,38aj3z,pepe_le_shoe,1 point,Thu Jun 4 17:16:20 2015 UTC,"I don't, on right-click heroes. Lesh, krob, etc get their damage from spells and it's possible bkb is their best way to tank up."
TrueDoTA2,38aj3z,Thalnagath,5,Thu Jun 4 18:50:10 2015 UTC,"Deso is amazing on her since she's, obviously, a high physical damage carry. Aquila/phase into deso can be really really powerful if you don't need a bkb. Otherwise, get a bkb. Also consider S&Y, I really like it and is a midgame option (though manta might be better in some situations).  Vlads isn't awful, but a casual morbid mask is probably best. If it goes late you can eventually make it a satanic.  As for battlefury, well, that's definitely not an early fighting kind of item. However, it's situational. If you need cleave against something like a PL or you know the game isn't going to end/you need to outfarm them (they have excellent counterpush with like a techies or something) then you can go it. PA can be strong late game but usually her peak is mid just because she falls off as the enemy gets BKBs/Ghosts/MKBs/any form of control for her like a hex."
TrueDoTA2,38aj3z,pastplayer,3,Tue Jun 2 23:53:20 2015 UTC,Don't forget about diffusal for situations where they build ghost or against an omni.
TrueDoTA2,38aj3z,ubermeatwad,2,Wed Jun 3 01:13:06 2015 UTC,"Diffusal is actually really good on her.  Just... not as good as Deso or the more traditional HotD+Basher build.  Very good when the situation calls for one, but shouldn't be seen as core."
TrueDoTA2,38aj3z,Thalnagath,1 point,Wed Jun 3 06:34:30 2015 UTC,"And warlock. Also, I like diffusal rush vs void, because if you hit him a few of times you can make it so that he can't chrono in the early game."
TrueDoTA2,38aj3z,pepe_le_shoe,2,Thu Jun 4 11:44:47 2015 UTC,"I also like to get bfury if there are multiple melee heroes clumping in an area focusing you during fights (while you have bkb) or the enemy generally has poor positioning and clump up a lot. It literally allows you to 1v5. It also helps if you want to split push, because you can blink into 2/3 creepwaves and nuke it down very fast. I once lost a set of rax mid-lane (and I was the only one snowballing in my team), so I had to get a battlefury to quickly push lanes out lanes and it definitely worked.  So while it may not be a good first item, but situationally you can get it as a 3rd/4th item after bkb in the above scenario. People have this notion in their mind that battlefury is purely a farming item on PA, which is not always true. It has also allowed me to comeback in many games because by the time I had battlefury, enemies were forcing our highground. So what I did was, push out a lane, force out a TP to defend, and immediately ask my team to fight 5v4, ultimates get blown while I TP to our base. Now the enemies are overconfident, out of position and most of the ultimates have been used. This is the perfect time to initiate and win the teamfight. If you don't have battlefury in this scenario, the other enemies will just stomp you, while you focus a single target. Battlefury allows you to take advantage of their poor positioning and spread your damage.  I don't want it to sound like it's the best item but it's not bad at all like reddit makes it to be."
TrueDoTA2,38aj3z,FusionX,3,Wed Jun 3 10:32:48 2015 UTC,"Supporting the Deso choice. Its GREAT. Crits melts the enemy, just like TA."
TrueDoTA2,38aj3z,SavageRS,2,Wed Jun 3 00:09:32 2015 UTC,But you need to have Vlads if you want lifesteal with deso. Sell it late game when you're switching away from the deso (if you haven't won already)
TrueDoTA2,38aj3z,darren_kill,3,Wed Jun 3 01:02:49 2015 UTC,"True. I don't think lifesteal is overly necessary. With evasion/poor man's/bottle/aquila you don't take much damage and can regen what you do. Deso, when applicable, is too good to not go even if you can't get the morbid. Should just skip lifesteal then imo, until ultra late, as you mentioned."
TrueDoTA2,38aj3z,pastplayer,2,Wed Jun 3 01:06:24 2015 UTC,"Vlad's should still be seen as core, especially as aggro-focused as the meta is right now.  It's more damage for PA and lifesteal for her, but you can't discount the +5 armor aura for your creeps and teammates.  Vlad's and a support with Meka is +10 armor on demand - extremely potent in the early game for pushing t1's and taking early teamfights.  You can have a teammate build it instead (and probably should), but that also relies on that teammate always being relatively close by.  If you're doing that bullshit Omniknight+PA combo, it's usually great to have Omni get the Vlad's since he'll always be near PA anyway.  Vlad's also makes Roshan a cinch."
TrueDoTA2,38aj3z,Thalnagath,2,Wed Jun 3 06:29:46 2015 UTC,I like her in combination with omni. Nuke and repel are very strong and let her fight earlier.
TrueDoTA2,38aj3z,Dirtydeal,2,Wed Jun 3 11:54:56 2015 UTC,"PA? AFK farmer? Oh lord, no. Reminds me of every time I played with pub Juggs (before he was third most picked or whatever in 6.83 and everyone did the MoM shit) and I would glance at their inventory to find Boots of Speed and a Perseverance because ""you rush Battle Fury and farm jungle with crits, duhhh""  No son, farm heroes. These carries need the blood of their enemies to snowball. Not only is it more efficient in terms of gold and XP (Midas rushes notwithstanding) but you also deny the enemy XP while they're dead, cost them their death toll, and prevent them from farming. You also make it easier to push and force a teamfight when you get pick-offs. If you focused on AFK farming as PA past 10, 15 minutes at most in, you were doing it wrong. Luckily this patch is geared towards helping you get it right.   Phase / PMS / Aquila / Dominator, Q on a lone enemy, then W on the same enemy. Repeat as necessary. Have fun.   E: The Deso suggestion: Not bad but Deso does fall off and you really want the armor shredding early on while it's still relevant (taking 7 armor away when most people have <10 is a big deal, not as big of a deal when everyone has 25 because of the diminishing returns of high armor) I would consider it a situational pick-up. If you can't really rush it then it might leave you kind of squishy if you don't have a good team to support you. Medallion of Courage might be a worthwhile investment since it gives you the same effect, albeit without the extra damage, for about a third of the price."
TrueDoTA2,38aj3z,EdenBlade47,0,Wed Jun 3 05:41:21 2015 UTC,"Deso is core on PA after the price drop.  3500 is incredibly easy to come up with and it's by far the most efficient damage item in the game now (for PA, at any rate), except for maybe rapier.  Have a teammate get Vlad's or just get one yourself if you feel you need lifesteal (Vlad's is great early on anyway for the armor aura for pushing, if nothing else.)  You'll eventually sell the Deso but not until very, very late in the game.  But with Deso builds you'll probably win at 35ish mins most games you win, anyway.  Deso builds leave her no more squishy than HotD builds - it's not like HotD+Basher tanks her up.  You'll be a bit squishier than SnY builds but you'll also hit about a billion times harder than those builds, too.  If you get the Deso early enough, you can literally one shot supports with a crit once you're at least lvl 11.  You don't even need to dagger, you just blink and swing for the fences, and if it connects, they just fall over.  Deso build is even more potent after that fucking insane Mekansm nerf.  It's a lot harder for teams to get enough bonus armor on everyone to reduce the impact of the Deso without sacrificing a lot to do it (you basically want, like, a vlad's and then a medallion to be used defensively on whoever PA is targeting, and a Meka.)"
TrueDoTA2,38aj3z,Thalnagath,4,Wed Jun 3 06:42:58 2015 UTC,"it's by far the most efficient damage item in the game now (for PA, at any rate)   True.   But the real problem with pa is not the dmg or physical attacks in early game, it's the amount of spells that can just delete you instantly without being able to hit anyone - underfarmed support can kill you insanely easily. A roaming es with no boots can kill you, all he has to do is just pull the combo off and you'll die, a jungle sk with blink can kill you, pudge that can hook you at least 1 and you'll die, etc. etc. And what's left saying for a lina/qop mid?   That's the real problem with people who lose games with pa, a hero who dies to literally 95% of the 2 man ganks, how can you not die as an 800 hp hero at that stage of the game with current spell dmg present in the game?    you can literally one shot supports with a crit once you're at least lvl 11   You are right, however, think about real game scenario: If your lane is good and you can freefarm, the fastest you can get a deso (with boots ofc) is around 13-14 mins, depending on your ability to farm and whether you get tower lasthit etc. If someone can do a couple of stacks, you can even get it at 12 mins, with no kills involved. At this stage, if you havent died once and you werent afk, you'll be lvl 11, with deso. You can kill any support, but that support can disable you and nuke you, or just keep you disabled for long enough time for him to tp out, go out of vision or just someone else to come help him out. You have 1k hp, with phase even less. Sure, you can jump on and one shot a lion, but if that lion hexes you, stuns you and ulties you afterwards, you are dead - from an underfarmed support as a 1 role in your team, not nice right? Even if you survive this, you have no way to regen, try clearing a hard camp stack with deso pa with no lifesteal, even with maxed evasion and that high armor you'll get really low, a smoke gank and someone will just randomly throw an ulti on you and you'll die. And to complete the vlads, which is another 2k gold, you gonna need another 3-4 more mins, if your jungle is farmed by someone else at the same time sometimes even 5 more mins, because going to a lane to farm at this stage with these items is a suicide literally.   In short: this build only works if you have an omni/wisp/oracle/aba/dazzle (in that order) as a lane supp, in which case you can even skip the vlads because these heroes are more legit vlad and mek carriers than others. But that requires one supp to constantly be around you, and that opens new places for the enemies to gank and get fed, so game is gonna still be difficult for you unless you are doing a lot of pressure and killing a lot (requires some rng in pa's case as well). In most cases, avoid this build."
TrueDoTA2,38aj3z,dirtyslarkpicker,0,Wed Jun 3 19:51:53 2015 UTC,"That's the real problem with people who lose games with pa, a hero who dies to literally 95% of the 2 man ganks, how can you not die as an 800 hp hero at that stage of the game with current spell dmg present in the game?   By not pretending you're Leoric.  You have a 1200 range dagger and 1000 range blink, why are you trying to manfight?  PA isn't any squishier than most heroes.  20+1.85 STR puts her comfortably within the upper half to upper third of all non-STR heroes, with most INT and many AGI heroes starting with less STR and often gaining very little more than her (and sometimes less.)  Most heroes have to be leery of QoP ulti or Lina Agh's, which is a major part of why those heroes (especially QoP) are trending so hard right now.  But PA has insane range on her primary skills, so there is absolutely no reason for her to be manfighting in the first 25-30 minutes of the game - she's an opportunist, not a tank.  You aren't a fucking Centaur, stop trying to act like one.   You can kill any support, but that support can disable you and nuke you, or just keep you disabled for long enough time for him to tp out, go out of vision or just someone else to come help him out.

Applies to literally all PA builds except BKB rush, and BKB rush is garbage.   In most cases, avoid this build.   In most cases, use this build.  It's unquestionably the most effective, most efficient general build for PA in the current meta.  Vlad's is cheap and comes online quickly and enables your team to push effectively and take fights effectively while also opening up early Roshan.  You use the gold from towers and teamfights along with basic farming to complete your Deso and continue pushing and being aggressive, taking t2 towers and more fights, as well as Roshan whenever it's possible (with Vlad's and Deso your team should be able to butcher him quickly.)  You take the aegis (whether it's on PA or someone else) and use it to pressure and siege high ground while PA is most likely working on her BKB now - with Vlad's+Deso she has plenty of damage to leverage during Avatar.  With BKB finished and possibly an aegis on her team somewhere, pushing high ground should be relatively simple.  Repeat the process as many times as necessary.  Compare this to any other common PA build and it's clearly better as a general purpose build.  HotD+Basher gives you a lot of control but leaves you with very little damage output and doesn't tank you up.  HotD+Battlefury is extremely expensive and leaves you without additional control and very low damage for the cost - it's a build you use if you need to cleave enemies down (you have a Magnus, they're heavy on melees, you're vs broodmother, illusion heroes, meepo without a proper counter to them, etc) or if you know your team can afford to let you spend an additional 10-12 minutes afk farming after you finish Bfury before you're able to participate.  Vlad's+Deso gives you an enormous amount of damage and pushing strength very quickly.  Vlad's gives creeps and allies 5 armor in addition to the lifesteal aura, very potent for early fighting and pushing t1's.  The lifesteal and armor also make a very early Roshan simplified.  Deso gives you a flat 60 damage and scaling damage through the -7, which also applies to buildings, which makes pushing t2's very simple and makes Roshan practically free.  I really appreciate the detailed response but you're just incorrect here."
TrueDoTA2,38aj3z,Thalnagath,2,Wed Jun 3 21:45:23 2015 UTC,"This is a nitpick.  You don't get battlefury to counter Meepo.  You just get damage.  If you crit one, they all die.

TrueDoTA2,38aj3z,-Hellfire-,1 point,Fri Jun 5 03:53:02 2015 UTC,"You play PA the same way you've always played her - as an opportunistic assassin.  She has never been a late-game afk farming hero.  Pros got away with that through intelligent drafting, taking advantage of gaping holes in the enemy draft (which is the only reason RTZ ever got away with sending PA mid, because she's a fucking horrible mid) and by using teamwork to cover for the inefficient ""I won't contribute at all for 25 minutes"" Bfury builds.  Pubs got away with it because... well, it's a pub.  But PA is best played as a mid-game snowball hero.  That was true before, and it's especially true now that Silver Edge is a thing.  You don't need BKB on PA until you're pushing high ground, and sometimes not even then.  You have 1200 range on daggers and 1000 range on blinks, no cooldown on either, no mana cost on either, so why are you pretending you're a Wraith King or a Sven and charging right in?  Hang around on the edges of fights, flip dice daggers at people to try and outskill them with crits (pure skill), and then blink in when you have an opening.  You have no business being in the middle of a fight when Rexxar shout, Bane grip, QoP wave, Lina ulti, etc haven't gone out - hell, you should be leery of jumping in even if VS hasn't stunned yet.  You have 1000 range on your blink, you don't need to be in the middle of the fight until it's safe.  And if the fight shifts and it becomes unsafe?  Use that 1000 range blink to glomp a creep or teammate on the fringes of the fight and return to opportunistic mode (or just run away, whichever is the best course of action.)  Some games with demand a fast BKB just to participate in fights at all, but that's a drafting error (you picked PA into a bad lineup, or you picked early and they counterpicked you.)  With intelligent drafting, you won't need BKB until it's time to manfight enemies.  Doesn't matter where you lane her.  She's a fucking horrible mid, but if they picked a really greedy/weak mid, you can get away with sending her there.  She's fine in the offlane because 1200 range on daggers means you simply can't completely zone her out - you won't get a lot of farm but you'll get some.  Safelane is typical for her.  I think she's better in duo lanes than tri lanes.  She starts having solid lane presence around lvl 3 with either 1/1/1 build (tanky build for trading hits or dealing with heavy harass) or 2/1/0 (CS/harass focused build.)  Don't worry about farming.  You're an assassin, not a farmer.  You want to farm heroes, not creeps.  Build a Vlad's, build a Desolator, and go one-shot enemy supports.  Build your next item (usually BKB at this point), take rax, win game.  You can have a teammate build the Vlad's instead and you get whatever.  Yasha, Drum, and casual Ultimate Orb are all similar in cost to Vlad's and each have their own benefits.  Works very well if a teammate gets Medallion into Solar Crest - -17 armor on a particular target is insane (or you can give PA +10 armor and +30% evasion for a goofy 65% total.)  Draft PA as part of an aggressive, push-focused lineup.  She doesn't need much to start being dangerous - mostly lvl 11 and her vlad's+deso combo.  Vlad's+Deso also means easy, safe Roshans and ancients.  Omniknight is extremely strong combined with PA and covers nearly all of her potential weaknesses, so pick the two of them together if possible.  Of course, Shadow Demon completely fucks both of them, so you need to be sure to ban the SD (or have someone on your team pick him if it's allpick or something.)  Rubick is also frustrating to play against as either hero.  While he doesn't get dagger crits, dagger is incredibly obnoxious to deal with, and Rubick uses all of Omni's spells better than Omni himself uses them."
TrueDoTA2,38aj3z,Thalnagath,2,Wed Jun 3 06:28:08 2015 UTC,"This post pretty much covers all my thoughts.  I actively resent battlefury PA players as they really just do not understand how to get the most mileage out of the character.  I acknolwedge it can be a situational item on her, but that situation is they are 5 melees who clump all the time.  Outside of that she wants most other offensive items far more and the new Vlads + Deso build is completely insane on her in the current meta."
TrueDoTA2,38aj3z,feralminded,1 point,Wed Jun 3 15:25:27 2015 UTC,How do you feel that silver edge is effecting her viability? I actually havent seen her in any of my games this entire patch (3800 MMR)
TrueDoTA2,38aj3z,XavierCugatMamboKing,3,Wed Jun 3 01:13:27 2015 UTC,I honestly don't think it's a big factor. It's an expensive item and she builds bkb anyway.
TrueDoTA2,38aj3z,ubermeatwad,0,Wed Jun 3 01:14:43 2015 UTC,"It's a huge factor.  It absolutely ruins her late game, when her BKB is only 5 sec.  Enemy team has a sheeper and silver edge.  Assume they also have at least a couple of disables that are blocked by BKB.  We'll be nice and assume that they somehow didn't pick a hero with a disable that goes through BKB despite the PA pick (maybe you last picked the PA and they didn't see it coming.)  Is sheeper available?  You have to BKB or you'll get sheeped and probably die.  Is BKB down?  You get hit with Silver Edge and either die or basically do less damage than a melee creep while they murder your team.  Alternatively: they hit you with Silver Edge, you are forced to BKB in order to be useful, and you get sheeped when BKB falls off and you/your team dies.  If you have a Manta Style to deal with the Silver Edge, it just becomes another layer (is manta style available?  are you willing to sacrifice its damage and siege potential in order to have it available to remove silver edge?) to the equation.  Halberd pushes it even farther against PA since that then gives them a solution to the Manta Style (manta out of silver edge, grats now you're disarmed instead.)  Even Solar Crest can function as a soft counter to PA, since it can either be used on PA to blind her (BKB out of it, see flowchart above) or used on PA's target (must have MKB.)  Silver Edge just made it even more apparent that PA is terrible late game and anyone that ignores her powerhouse early game and middle game in favor of pretending to be a shitty Anti-Mage is playing the wrong hero."
TrueDoTA2,38aj3z,Thalnagath,3,Wed Jun 3 06:47:16 2015 UTC,"Well, I agree with you mostly. I think she's still really strong late game in the right hands, but you certainly aren't aiming for the lategame. Yes, there are counters but honestly most of the things you said counter everyone.   My point in the original comment is that while silver edge is nice, it doesn't really counter what PA wants to do - dominate the early-mid. It's expensive to rush, and if you're relying on break vs her evasion that gives her room to get a butterfly which makes her even more annoying (break doesn't stop items). Then you have to build an mkb which will be late. By this time, a successful PA will be ending the game."
TrueDoTA2,38aj3z,ubermeatwad,1 point,Wed Jun 3 06:59:41 2015 UTC,It depends. A hero like Slark or DK can get away with rushing a silver edge and neuter PA in the mid game.

TrueDoTA2,386fja,Joelramones,3,Tue Jun 2 20:38:13 2015 UTC,"Pretty strong TA patch in my opinion, atleast when compared to Sniper/Troll, DP/Razor or Furion/Tinker. Don't let couple of shit games fool you. Also cheap deso is godlike.  I don't know what kind of tips are you looking for, but something that works in +5k is the casual win midlane -> push tower -> take rosh -> push more towers. Never leave to gank, just farm, push towers and kill everyone that comes contest."
TrueDoTA2,386fja,Joelramones,2,Tue Jun 2 08:48:24 2015 UTC,"I've been using the same general strat with Lesh with huge success.  I don't gank until they I push the T1 down.  You want to leave mid to gank? Be my guest.  Instantly call missing, pop Diabolic Edict, and melt your T1 easy.  Only difference is I usually rotate to a struggling lane after their T1 is down to get a gank/push that T1, then I take my buddies I was helping in that lane to rosh with me.  None of the pros level Edict first, but I've been having huge success with it with this strategy (0-4-4-1).  Melting rosh and T1s is a fantastic way to start your snowballing early and put them on their heels."

Im sure since a lot of in-the-meta heroes have damage instances that bring down refrcaction hurts her but how isnt she good in the snowbally meta were in?"

Then either bkb or upgrade medallion if I want the dodge or extra damage.  I like to play her as a glass cannon outside of refraction. If you pick up a dd or regen rune, can rosh pretty early with the medallion.  Can easily two hit supports with blink-medallion-meld hit."

That doesnt make sense, either go phase into deso and then a blink (situational of course, sometimes you wont even need it) or go treads into blink and then deso, so you can actually kill people before they tp out or run away.   If you are not killing the enemy mid at lvl 6-7 or just forcing them out of lane completely then you are playing the hero wrong. Also, solo kills > ancient stacks right now."
TrueDoTA2,386fja,Phorky12,1 point,Wed Jun 3 17:20:39 2015 UTC,"Honestly you don't need attack speed on TA, I usually just double wave mid over and over, stacking ancients and keeping rune control. Once I get deso, I rice for blink extremely quick and terrorize the rest of the map. Her auto attack animation is so godlike for strafing, attack speed actually hurts your ability to stick  and move IMHO which is why I never liked the drums Yasha build."
TrueDoTA2,386fja,MestHoop,1 point,Tue Jun 2 14:41:06 2015 UTC,"I find in this patch it is important to have a strong 15-20 minute impact with TA. So what I personally prefer is going phase boots (for even stronger lane domination and easier ganks) over treads. Also I find it a bit strange that you go for desolator BEFORE blink dagger. I'd only really do that if completely dominating early game, otherwise getting blink first allows you to have stronger ganking potential early in the game if you co-ordinate with allies. To get this blink asap try to stack ancients when getting runes, and then when you take the ancients give the mid-lane to a starved support."
TrueDoTA2,386fja,phob,3,Tue Jun 2 08:42:13 2015 UTC,"I liked phase when going for the racecar TA build, but I feel that without drums and yasha, she seriously lacks some attack speed. Treads solve that. I also used to go blink first, but after the cost of deso was reduced by a lot, I like getting it since desolator gives her a lot more than a blink. Besides after getting a deso she farms very fast, and getting a blink after it very easy. In contrast, blink is a more riksy pick-up, since you have to be successful at ganking, which in pubs doesn't happen always.  I'll work on my ancient stacking though. I always start stacking ancients too late."
TrueDoTA2,386fja,mriswith-,3,Tue Jun 2 09:15:38 2015 UTC,"Wagamama made a pretty good guide on current TA a while back. Ancient stacking is best done on radiant side, as you can leave the lane at around 40 sec mark, stack ancients and move to top rune straight away. Just make sure you start pushing the wave before the 30 sec mark if it isn't already. Aggressive psiblades on range creep or multiple melee creeps shouldn't make this too hard."
TrueDoTA2,386fja,0xym0r0n,5,Tue Jun 2 12:38:55 2015 UTC,"(The guide)  You still stack ancients on dire, but it will cost you more CS to do so.  It's still worth it when you can get sub-11 minute blink + aquila + phase."

TrueDoTA2,38576q,Harlequeens,5,Mon Jun 1 22:59:46 2015 UTC,Soul ring is a great pick up for pretty much infinite sustain and oo.
TrueDoTA2,38576q,MissionaryImpossible,3,Mon Jun 1 23:55:04 2015 UTC,"Soul Ring was amazing but its gotten worse over successive patches. The mana cost nerf to PtA means you only get 40 mana out of the use at all levels rather than 70/60/50/40. The change to MoC means you need to put 2-3 points into it earlier to get the CD reasonable rather than leaving it as a value point. This means that you probably don't have the second point into PtA until 9 or 10, so for the early game all the active gives you is 40 mana and 0 hp.  Get Medallion instead, its the same mana regen but a bunch of armor and offensive power."
TrueDoTA2,38576q,Carnot_AoR,3,Tue Jun 2 13:58:12 2015 UTC,"Indeed, I have found Phase + Drums + S&Y to be surprisingly effective on LC—always have, actually, but it probably has even more merit now if your lanes break down early. The key take-away from this thread seems to be that itemizing into mobility followed by tankiness is the way to go, after all. It's not like LC can't make significant contributions with her spells if the teams start grouping up to fight. Drums are pretty useful now for being able to run fast, hit things decently hard early on, and having enough mana to cast PtA a lot (the heal/Purge is just so handy in pubs). Be liberal with the charges and use Duel to finish off fleeing opponents as a ""reward"" for winning the fight... if you have a line-up that can dish out or at least withstand early aggression, LC can use her speed to play early game fights not completely unlike a Night Stalker in terms of weaving in and out of battle to isolate targets. While I don't doubt Blink is best mobility item and the correct choice most of the time, movespeed and stats might be a more decent back-up plan than it's given credit for if the game's starting to get away from you."
TrueDoTA2,38576q,DarkFazy,4,Tue Jun 2 06:10:51 2015 UTC,"The ""standard"" build, as far as I know, is 4-1-1-1 into 4-4-1-1, Phase/Treads (both have their merit) into Blink into Blademail into BKB into AC (usually). It's the conservative and quite fail-proof build. Bottle, Magic Wand and Soul Ring are common companions (usually one of them) of this build.  Phase vs Treads: Treads are safer, offer more DPS and go better with Bottle. Phase Boots obviously give way more mobility and allow you to bully people more in lane and be speedy.  Upgraded boots, Blink and BKB are ""most core"" of those items. You usually want to pick up 1 midgame item and it often is Blademail, but there are other options.  New upgrade to SB, Silver Edge, is also quite powerful item for LC and can be even combined with Blink (you can go PtA, activate Blademail, BKB - if needed, blink, Silver Edge for break/debuff and Duel).   I've seen some good LC players get SnY instead of Blade Mail in some games in order to chase down mobile enemies and get the sweet midgame package this item offers.  I am really not sold on Armlet, but to be honest, I have not tried it much.  Desolator is solid, the item is at quite good spot after last patch and is very efficient damage option.  BKB is needed in overwhelming majority of games, but you obviously want to get it after Blink + damage item if possible.  AC, MKB, Abyssal and Mjollnir are most common lategame choices, with AC being the least situational one, because it's basically all LC wants. Moon Shard is also great luxury. Heart and Satanic can do work in some specific scenarios, but it's rather rare.  Dotabuff example 1  Dotabuff example 2  Dotabuff example 3  I personally play LC as offlaner and sometimes safelane/mid and I usually go for this standard build. I also think Midas is fine if you can get it under 10 minutes (obvious not an option for offlane LC).   Medaillion/Crest is meh, it's just weaker than Blademail and except for enabling you to do Roshan more easily, it does not give you that much damage/duel-winning power. Besides, it's so much more effective when you don't have to buy it, because LC's budget is quite tight, she's not that great at farming (can be helped by Maelstrom in some games, definitely not often though)."
TrueDoTA2,38576q,mjjdota,1 point,Wed Jun 3 20:32:09 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the post, and especially for linking Moo—I did not realize he liked the hero. He was discussing the state of the hero a bit yesterday on his stream. It's interesting that he likes Midas (sub-10 minutes) a lot on the hero to get a faster level 16 and finds S&Y to be a key pick-up basically every game... pretty cool to get his perspective on the hero, and see how he makes it work so well."
TrueDoTA2,38576q,reivision,2,Tue Jun 2 01:35:04 2015 UTC,"Blink / Shadowblade -> Silver Edge is fine. You definitely want some kind of initiation item, you should be able to get a feel for which is more appropriate. Second item I'll usually go for BKB, unless it seems like I won't need it, which is rare I find. Definitely tanking up is the way to go, since you'll be getting plenty of damage from duels. SnY is the premier item against heroes that can't man fight you. That's why it's so effective on Troll. I'd avoid this item if they aren't actually going to run away from you, like against Ursa. Solar Crest I've never gotten on her, can't say. Mjollnir might be ok. Theoretically it seems silly - she already farms stupid fast, her attack speed doesn't affect moment of courage. However if your duel damage gets really high then aspd will be your most efficient dps increases. Basher is good despite the moment of courage anti synergy. Consider though that your duel targets won't be the only units hitting you. Blademail is strong if they don't have BKB heroes.   Be flexible but overall I like going initiation into tankiness... as a general rule you want to go as dps heavy as you can afford to go without dying. If they have Treant + Wisp and are low on damage, then tanking up is incorrect vs rushing a Crit or w/e."
TrueDoTA2,38576q,Skyro620,2,Thu Jun 4 17:56:34 2015 UTC,"I'm a bit late to the party, but man I gotta say I love your posts to this sub. I remember your Orchid alternatives for QoP post and at the time (as is being repeated here) I found I agreed with a lot of your findings. Great stuff, and well-written too.  I've played a lot of LC in the past and a few games in 6.84. I've also posted a few times about LC on the sub in the past, though like you it's been mostly to ask advice. She's definitely a unique hero with an interesting balance between gank, snowball, farm, carry, and tank. She's one of my favorites to play.  I've never been a fan of Armlet on LC, which is a bit odd as I'm a huge fan of Armlet in general. I guess it's mainly because you can't toggle during Duel and I feel that crucial first 2k gold item needs to be something that gives you mobility instead (Blink, Shadowblade, or maybe even Drums in a tough game).  I'm coming to think that LC's main priorities throughout the game are:   Mobility: Blink/Shadowblade to secure those crucial early Duel wins. I used to go Phase, then Treads, and now I'm back to Phase. The mobility, though somewhat marginal, is pretty big and I feel early mobility is more important than ever in the meta of early fights. Survivability: Like you've found, unless the game is going supremely well I find I need a midgame tanking item. I have been a longtime fan of S&Y on LC and often go for an early Sange, even before Blink/Shadowblade if the game is going terribly early on. I generally don't like Drums because LC runs out of slots fast with so many good options in the mid price range (Blink/Shadowblade, S&Y, Blademail, Armlet, BKB, etc). Magic Immunity: If needed. Otherwise your Duels are just gonna get wrecked by almost any support or stun. As an LC player I curse the popularity of Lion and Lina and even WD. More tank and more kiting prevention: AC is the undisputed king item on LC. Gives her everything she wants outside of kiting prevention (armor, attack speed, armor reduction to scale with Duel damage). I actually really liked going for Skadi late in the game for BKB-piercing, reliable slow, beefiness, and all the manapool I could ever want. S&Y + Skadi + AC means you can manfight pretty much anyone. Of course this was my ideal build back when Duel muted items like crit and bash, but I still think it's an overall better way to build LC than going for items like Daedalus or Abyssal except in extreme cases.   Specific Items:   Maelstrom/Mjollnir: I always liked this buildup on LC, but it leaves her on the fragile side in the midgame. You farm very quickly with it though. I would go Treads/Phase Blink Mael S&Y. Another issue with it is that I'd rather have an AC than a Mjollnir overall and the buildup is kind of awkward if I decide to transition partway through. I rarely go Mael/Mjollnir anymore. Silver Edge: I've tried this in my new 6.84 games and have had great success. Granted, I had safelane farm so it was pretty easy to get in a timely manner. I used to never go Shadow Blade on LC, but the damage spike and attack speed is nice, plus forcing sentries and vision from enemy supports. The cooldown reduction makes it juuuust short enough to use it sometimes for escape after a pickoff and fight. And the Break is very useful against many enemies (though BKB negates it). 225 damage from invis will chunk most supports into instant kill range with a Duel if you catch them out early in a fight, even without PtA. And the extra Strength gives you that survivability early on that you so desperately need. I like Silver Edge overall. I like it a lot. Abyssal/Basher/Crit: Luxuries. While they work now during Duel, LC needs defensive capacities from her items too much to pick these up any earlier than 5th or 6th slot luxuries. Satanic: I haven't tried this yet, but I can see it working late. I think overall I might still prefer Skadi, but they are probably roughly equivalent depending on your situation. Solar Crest: Meh...I can see the attraction but again if I'm aiming for an AC later (which I always am on LC), I'd rather have items that address my mobility/utility/straight tankiness with raw HP (S&Y).   The new MoC is very strong early on, and I usually max it or at least go 2-3 deep after OO while leaving PtA for last. The higher proc chance is actually an early DPS increase in disguise, which helps secure those early Duels with Phase Boots.  LC is just in such a weird place where on paper she's a strong hero with great stats (movement speed, stat gain, etc) but her role ends up making her almost completely subject to having a successful midgame and her kit doesn't really help her out too well in that stage of the game. I have a lot of fun but also get often frustrated with this hero. shakes head  TL:DR; Phase Boots, Basi + Wand or Bottle, Silver Edge, S&Y/BKB, AC, Skadi/Satanic is probably my build for 6.84. Early points in MoC are quite good and I prioritize it now over PtA, though OO still gets top priority."
TrueDoTA2,38576q,Carnot_AoR,2,Tue Jun 2 01:37:03 2015 UTC,"Thanks! While the highly flexible nature of the hero let me off the hook to an extent, I never did work out a truly comfortable personal approach to Queen—I look forward to revisiting her in a future thread (perhaps soon because she's trending real hard as of late).  The thing about QoP is that she has a lot of viable options item-wise; during my QoP phase I maintained a 60%~ winrate and 3.0~ KDA despite max-Dagger right-click builds, Linken's rushes and other questionable techniques. I've had much less success experimenting with LC, where S&Y (and to a lesser extent, Silver Edge) is pretty much the only thing standing between myself and the match feeling like a 50/50 toss-up. LC just needs a lot more things at certain times, I suppose.  Speaking of which, I'm in full agreement with your assessment of LC's needs throughout the game—it's pretty close to the item progression Moo (the third player linked by /u/DarkFazy) seems to favor on LC. My plan for future games will probably be to prioritize Blink and Sange, then upgrade to either S&Y or Silver Edge depending on the gamestate followed by BKB and AC unless the game calls for other items such as MKB or whatever with Satanic being the end-game ""we won"" item of choice.  I do plan on giving Solar Crest alongside Blink a fair shake too, perhaps next time I wind up in the offlane or something."
TrueDoTA2,38576q,kryonik,1 point,Wed Jun 3 01:08:19 2015 UTC,"I almost always go Blink/Mael/BKB. After it it depends on the team compositions (AC and Skadi being good late game pickups).  -Blink is essentially needed to get good Duels off consistently (i.e. ones you have a high chance of winning).  -LC needs attack speed as she already gets good damage from Duel bonuses. Mael/Mjol give that plus and AoE for her to push lanes and accelerate her farm.  -BKB is pretty much core on her to not get disabled constantly. You can't avoid getting it, the only question is when to get it, which is whenever you believe teamfights are going to happen.  -Silver Edge I would only get late game if I needed the break.  -Blade Mail is really more of a catch-up item if you get off to a horrible start. This lets you secure kills even vs. opposing carries who are significantly ahead of you.  -All other items sound good on LC but in practice just isn't as effective. The key to playing LC is simply winning duels as consistently as possible, and no other items do that as consistently as Blink and BKB, and after you get those you don't want to use up your remaining item slots on mid game items like Armlet, Drums, Medallion or S&Y.  -Also I prefer a Bottle over Soul Ring. Personally I think LC is best run mid."
TrueDoTA2,38576q,Thalnagath,1 point,Wed Jun 3 23:11:54 2015 UTC,"Skill Build: 4-1-2-1 at 8. You need two points into MoC to get the CD a bit more reasonable. After that max PtA or put one more into MoC then max PtA.  Medallion and Solar Crest:  These are amazing items on LC because not only do they give her regen and durability as well as significantly increasing her single-target damage, PtA removes the debuff. So MoC can give you a 14 armor advantage and Crest a 20 armor advantage and effectively 50% evasion (30% evasion and 30% blind).  Blink vs. Shadow Blade/Silver Edge: I significantly favor Shadow Blade over Blink. While Blink allows you to initiate better, LC has always been a poor initiator. Shadow Blade is much better for running around the map and finding pickoffs. Its much easier to scout while invis to find targets, the 175 break damage is very important, and you can easily Duel slippery targets by casting it from Invis. Silver Edge is very strong on LC for the break and damage reduction, but doesn't need to be rushed except against certain heroes (eg. Void, Troll, PA, Ursa).  Blademail: No, unless you are very far behind. Other items are as good or better for winning Duels and scale better.  Armlet: Incredibly efficient for winning Duels, pick it up when you want a good mix of damage and durability.  Halberd: This item is the best way to deal with Linken's. Its extremely gold efficient even without the active or passive, giving both Strength and evasion (an EHP multiplier), and is a good manfight item outside of Duel (maim, evasion, disarm when BKBs are down).  BKB: (Take this with a grain of salt since one of my flaws as a player is I don't like getting BKB) Not strictly necessary until you start teamfighting. The Duel target can't cast anything anyway so unless there is a +1 that can mess you up, its not worth it. Other items are better for winning Duels and snowballing."
TrueDoTA2,38576q,kryonik,2,Tue Jun 2 05:23:01 2015 UTC,"I think Silver Edge should only be built in games where you want the break mechanic. All the other team needs is dust, a gem or sentries and all of a sudden your initiation is lost."

SB/SE are not initiating items and LC is not an initiating hero until she has a bunch of items and damage. In the late game I add a Blink or switch out the SB for one.  Dust doesn't prevent you from finding heroes, it takes a lot if sentries to protect the jungle, and gem is only useful if the enemy groups up. The net worth trade of SB vs. a bunch of sentries/gem favors SB since the former has significant value even without invis while the latter only function to reveal invis units."

This isn't to say every pick has the exact same potential (some are clearly more favorable in more circumstances than others), but seeing as how there are fairly successful spammers for just about every hero including left-field stuff like carry Io, I'm confident you can do reasonably well for yourself on just about any hero with a varied/deep enough understanding and a lot of practice."

You're going to be running about in fights wailing on people, and items like AC, abyssal, and armlet are going to help much more than a Skadi.  He is also (like most melee carries) succeptible to being kited around in fights, which is why BKB is so important to him.  Deso will also help bursting people down, and Skadi won't stack with it.  And because of his aura, he can get by without lifesteal.  TL;DR: It's not a bad item, it's just that other items do a better job."
TrueDoTA2,385yqw,alexja21,6,Tue Jun 2 03:03:12 2015 UTC,"I play a shitload of WK and honestly feel like there are some items that fit his play style so well that items like Skadi are not bad but there will always be better options. Items like Blink, Blademail & Mjollnir are my items of choice in 90% of the games, and it's followed up by an Abyssal blade in almost all situations.   The play style is to initiate and be very aggressive, putting your opponent in the position where they start the fight in a disadvantage and can't retaliate. The advantage of Mjollnir, Blademail & Blink are that it allows you to go very aggressive without being punished for it (Radiance situationally). Later in the game you just want to be able to lock someone down long enough for you to beat him down (if necessary together with your team), and an Abyssal Blade is a perfect addition for that. You want to be able to dish out as much damage as possible (or just kill) before your opponent is able to move again, and Skadi I feel doesn't really compliment this play style.   Even as a luxury item I'll almost always prefer going AC / Rapier / Refresher / Some other dmg item over Skadi. It's just a bit lackluster for the play style WK is fit for, and I don't see the item ever offering something which WK would need. Skadi's not bad on any hero but there's always a better alternative for WK."

TrueDoTA2,385yqw,EDDE12345678,1 point,Wed Jun 3 00:13:25 2015 UTC,"Armlet is honestly OP as hell on STR heroes - you need a really good reason not to get armlet on a right-clicking STR hero.  It's especially compelling on Leoric since his aura helps compensate for the health cost for free, and his ult also means he doesn't even care that much if he loses too much health from armlet in a fight.  WK only really needs to be concerned about mana drain effects - it doesn't matter if the enemy team has a boatload of stuns because you'll die, come right back, and now their stuns are on cooldown or they're OOM and you just walk around critting them into the dirt.  Armlet+Deso is just so disgustingly efficient on him.  Sometimes you can't swing for the Deso because you have to get a blinker or something to deal with enemy mobility skills or kiting, and since Leoric doesn't farm well, it's kind of hard to get Armlet+Deso+blinker+etc without the game basically already being over."

Situationally, I have thought that Skadi could be a great item for him. Specifically, vs mana sapping enemies. It should prevent some kiting,  help you tank up during your lives, and give you some much needed mana.  Of course,  I haven't actually built it on him yet,  so I don't know what it's like in practice. In the same vein, Atos? Never seen it,  but it's kind of right up his alley.

Late game when you have the money for the item people will have blink/force and other escapes while you still have to run up on them to apply the slow and risk being burst down the whole time.  There's a reason most of the best carriers are ranged, I'm sure it can work but I don't see it doing anything special for WK.  I guess I just don't feel like Skadi will ever turn the fight/game for you when a clutch Armlet toggle or Blink>stun might."
TrueDoTA2,385tlj,-narcoticc,12,Tue Jun 2 01:40:47 2015 UTC,"In the first 10 minutes, unless your side lanes are getting absolutely crushed, you do not leave mid.   You win mid - you get 60+ cs, then you start making things happen. If you're a carry who wants to keep farming, start pushing the mid lane into the enemy tower, then go farm a jungle camp, rinse and repeat, just like a position 1 vs the offlane T1 tower.  If you're a ganking mid - hit your key level or key <10 minute item and start looking for oppourtunities, either TPs to other lanes getting dived, or oppourtunities for your supports to gank mid."
TrueDoTA2,385tlj,pepe_le_shoe,4,Tue Jun 2 11:48:02 2015 UTC,"Learn good timings when to push the wave, so you can go stack the jungle quickly. If you're playing DK, learn Quelling Blade shortcuts in jungles (streamers like Barnnny or BananaSlamJama are great for efficient jungle paths). If you're playing Invoker, master microing your Forge Spirits to go stack multiple camps at a time, while you stay in mid and counter the opponent. Leaning on a Bottle for regen is okay, but you're right that its going to short-change your farming. Make sure trading hits with the opponent mid laner is going to be worth the networth loss (ideally by securing a kill)."

TrueDoTA2,385tlj,dotlyze,7,Tue Jun 2 09:31:52 2015 UTC,"SF is not a ganking mid. You farm the lane and 1-2 jungle camps while the lane is pushed out. You want at least your Mek to start pushing towers with your team.  Running around the map as SF is not good, as you dont have any slow or silence, so you basically can't make anything happen. What you can do tho (and you should) is look for opportunities when have a good rune (dd, haste, invis).  Also always carry a tp at about minute 5, so you can tp and clear the low hp enemies if they dive you somewhere.  But generally, don't feel bad for staying on the lane and farming as Shadow Fiend."

TrueDoTA2,385tlj,WhompWump,2,Tue Jun 2 10:15:46 2015 UTC,"Something to consider is that generally farming mid is more exp and gold than rotating to get 1 kill.    Always have a TP, so that you can countergank.  It's better to countergank as a farmer than to try to set it up yourself.    Push out the wave, then stack neutrals for yourself.  Same idea as pushing and then getting the rune.  Call missing, encourage supports to place lane wards, shout out relevant items.  It's important for your team to know that puck has a blink, for example.  farm relevant items!  the faster you can become relevant and join in fights the better.  often you can win a gank and then farm that lane for a couple waves, which is very efficient."

TrueDoTA2,384m0q,NightBane,18,Mon Jun 1 20:36:23 2015 UTC,Get smokes and gank. Also deward. There is a game inside the game going on.  Being observant on the map is much easier. You can also make a lot more happen. I agree with the other that stated you should also try to coordinate ganks.   I personally find the 1 position the must boring. You have to basically avoid fights until it is advantageous for you to TP in. You don't get to create fights the way supports do in the early game.   Supports get to be much more aggressive early on. Play Mirana if you want a high skill cap/high reward support.   Edit: said mirana was a carry at the end. When in reality  she is one of the top supports in the game.
TrueDoTA2,384m0q,Lazarous86,1 point,Mon Jun 1 22:40:45 2015 UTC,"Observation is a huge help at higher level matchmaking.

This type of play calling can allow your carries play more effectively - getting the right item choices and reacting on-time to fights & plays."

I'm around 3.5k and people just want to stay mechanically stuck in the lanes.. And will yell at you if you don't.  My friends also are very aggressive.. To the point where I have this friend that thoroughly enjoys Spirit Breaker. Now you'd probably say, ""okay, What's wrong with that?"" Well, the problem is he doesn't stop the charge, even if he dies while doing it, under tier 2. It's not to say that my friends are bad, but.. Well, they're not thinking of the late game. So while he leaves me in botlane, to go and dive the top lane while they're waiting for him to kill himself, I'm left alone against the carry with the support that are basically waiting at any chance to jump on me and kill me.  Still, thank you with your suggestions, I will keep trying it."

TrueDoTA2,384m0q,Lazarous86,1 point,Wed Jun 3 11:05:20 2015 UTC,"Just run a trilane. Don't lane with the SB. The reason you are doing it alone is because you are not trilaning. The idea of the Tri is that you zone the offlaner away from your carry enough that the carry has a clear level and item advtantage after about 2 or 3 minutes. Enough that you can safely leave the carry alone and smoke to gank mid. After whatever you do mid, successful or unsuccessful, you then assess if you can move to offlane and really screw up the farm of their carry, or if your carry now needs help to keep snowballing. Maybe after you have secured your carry and mid an advantage by proper smokes, you look at the other support and say, ""go top and make sure our carry can keep farming. I am going to roam., if you have the better roaming hero and they have the better zoner.   This is what makes playing supports so exciting early game, you really can dictate the early game success with proper movement, wards, and efficient timing. Say you are the support to go back top to secure the carry farm.  You should stack a large camp and secure rune if you are close to an even minute timer.  You don't necessarily need to rush back top. Think about what is most efficient movements.    Another thing worth mentioning is securing runes for your mid and offlane. You early game can be really exciting if you communicate with your mid properly and secure runes with them or move so your team gets both. Also, get obs and sentries early. That can be huge for keeping your lanes safe. I usually don't leave my carry along without a jungle/rune ward so he can see movements to his side of the map.   These are just small parts of playing support, really basic concepts.  There is also advanced things like double or triple stacking."

My best advice is to stop holding the carry players hand and leave him be. Most carry players in the lower skill brackets (hell, even in the highest skill brackets) tend to think they are God's gift to the team and it is their divine right to farm uncontested, when in reality, this hasn't been the case for years ever since 4p1 strategy faded away.  If your mid and offlaner need assistance, most of the time, prioritizing them can give you a bigger lead in the mid game which will give your carry more space to farm. Your carry being an item or even two up in the mid game while the rest of your team has little and you have lost map control is a formula for a lost game."
TrueDoTA2,384m0q,pepe_le_shoe,5,Tue Jun 2 18:19:43 2015 UTC,"Ok so I play a LOT of support - about 95% of my game are support in the slightly roast potato bracket.   For maximum fun learn the basics first so you can do it without thinking. Pulling/Stacking and good warding/dewarding.   Now.. smoke and gank like a beast. 6.84c is a GREAT patch for supports. No more winning the early game only to have a little comeback mechanic ruin it for you. A lot of supports single handedly DESTROY certain cores - learn these and have a barrel of fun.  Oh.. look someone is playing Phoenix/EbolaSpirit etc.. Silencer. Storm spirit .. STATIC FIELD.. Disruptor absolutely destroys Storm - never lost a game against Storm with Disruptor. Really hard to nail down heroes like Puck or AM, Bane.. hehe - ruin their life. And if they go PL/CK/Brood an Earthshaker is a barrel of laughs. Also... LOOK AT IT GO.. is always amusing.  In all seriousness though.. supporting is hard. You will be squishy, you will have less farm and levels and you have to make a difference. You need to learn to fog yourself, don't be visible on the map unless you have to be, make the enemy team uncomfortable.  Remember when you played core roles what supports made your life difficult or just ruined your games outright and think why.  If your team is willing try a few jungling heroes Ench/Chen/Enigma/KoTL (basically Cores in disguise)  Lastly watch how the pros do it: Watch AUI_2000 get a 13 min Aghs on KoTL and literally carry the game or an Fy Sand King with a 10-12 min dagger appear out of nowhere and own the next 15 minutes of the game.

If you're a good support, and you've got a good carry, you'll find you only need to do that once or twice in the first 10 minutes of the game.  The real point of a support is to do all the hard jobs, warding, ganking, contributing to fights without dying, without lot's of items.   You have to ward - being good at warding is hard. Placing good wards without dying or getting spotted is hard. Learn to ward. You are a spy in the enemy territory - warding is fun!  Kills - supports facilitate kills. For the large proportion of the game, your carries can't get solo kills, they need the supports to help, and in most cases, the support contributes more to achieving the kill, by way of stuns, nuke damage, and good positioning.  Pick supports with stuns, and every 30 seconds, look at the minimap and think ""who can I kill now"" - if a lane is pushed in, it's ripe for a gank. If mid creep equilibrium is in your mid's favour, tell him to start denying and you can gank mid.  If your own lane is going well, tell your carry to deny as much as possible, and go hide behind trees and wait until the enemy moves out of position, then kill them."
TrueDoTA2,384m0q,Dread_Boy,3,Tue Jun 2 11:42:45 2015 UTC,"I'm going to take a different position than most people here are taking. Rather than changing your playstyle, I would recommend playing more supports and finding ones that you enjoy playing. For me, Rubick is always a blast for me to play. His personality makes even games I get stomped in fun (After respawning, ""I'm coming, friends! Wait for meeee!""). There is more than just a ""support"" role in this game, different supports have sub-roles. Find one that you enjoy playing even if it's just pulling and stacking."

I find support to be a lot more fun in the early game as you have so many different things to do. In the mid/lategame I find support to be a lot of fun just due to the number of active items to worry about in fights and having to dodge carries as you fight and ward/deward.  Tldr; mix it up, supporting isn't just sitting in lane harassing"

TrueDoTA2,382ex1,Aesyn,16,Mon Jun 1 10:53:47 2015 UTC,"Since you are alone in the lane, you are not guaranteed to land the stun   That's bad reasoning .... mid lesh sometimes skill stun....  Anyway, he has low armour and no escape (320ms though).  If the enemy has a proper trilane they should be able to harass you out of lane, in pubs no-one properly trilanes until very high mmr.  In pubs I guess it's ok"
TrueDoTA2,382ex1,Dancatpro,2,Mon Jun 1 11:00:09 2015 UTC,"Yes this is for pubs in mind. Author of the guide I found says that he spammed Lesh from 4k to 5k+ following this strat.  Also I think that's not bad reasoning at all. Following this playstyle, your goal is to deal as much damage as you can(to anyone, creeps, towers, heroes), with limited resources in hand. Whether you kill them, or they have to use regen, or they back to base doesn't matter. Since split earth is the least reliable tool for this purpose, this build doesn't pick it up until later. It is really rare to hit 2 heroes (and creeps) with a single stun, but not that rare with storm. So nearly all of our mana goes to storm spam. Edict is there to:  1- Dealing with zoning supports.  2- Finishing towers after you starved their lane.  Also in other reply you told that Lesh needs lots of farm, which is absolutely true. But even in offlane I could farm really well, thanks to lightning storm again. I start last hitting creeps with storm beginning in level 3, while harassing enemies at the same time. Earliest bloodstone I finished playing with this build was 12 minutes, with average around 14-15."
TrueDoTA2,382ex1,Dancatpro,0,Mon Jun 1 12:13:35 2015 UTC,"Edict is there to: 1- Dealing with zoning supports.   Any non-retarded support will just walk back to the creep wave so your edict does fuck all, is put on cd and you wasted mana"
TrueDoTA2,382ex1,poppyspeed,2,Mon Jun 1 12:16:10 2015 UTC,"You don't cast edict if they are that close to their creep line. It's more effective when juggling around the trees, trying to contest runes or creep pull. Even in the situation you are both in the lane and close to creeps, you can get few more hits on support than he lands on you, and that might be enough.  Of course there are situations stun is better than edict, but the advantage edict gives as in early tower pushing, and as a scare away tool is a bit more valuable. They cannot follow you into the trees when they don't have vision of you at all times, because few seconds of edict while they were chasing you might turn the gank around immediately.  Also I don't even consider not leveling lightning storm after trying a game without it (slahser build), I think it is as powerful as something like 6.83 shrapnel with its target acquisition range, relatively low mana and super low cd. So the choice is between stun and edict only."
TrueDoTA2,382ex1,Dancatpro,2,Mon Jun 1 12:27:33 2015 UTC,"The popular mid-lesh build atm is to max lightning storm with at least 2 points into stun.   You lightning storm, stun, lightning storm and can kill or heavily harass the enemy mid."

TrueDoTA2,382ex1,Thalnagath,2,Mon Jun 1 11:18:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah true, or if you have a mid that needs to be ganked to keep the supports busy.  The only other problem is that lesh needs LOTS of items which may be hindered if he gets no farm and only levels for 10 minutes"

Before 6.84, I played over 70 games of Leshrac mid, maxing edict. You will almost never have an opportunity to use this on someone solo, and even if you did, you were probably going to kill them anyways. Waiting for a rune with 2-2-0 is a solo kill on 95% of the heroes if you land the stun in range of edict. I can't speak to the effectiveness of it vs two targets,  maybe it would be decent."

Lesh excels with farm, if you watch games where lesh isn't top of the net worth chart, he's usually super ineffective. Stun is an important part of his jungle farming, not skilling it at all is a huge mistake.  I like the 2-0-3-1 into 2-4-4-1 build personally."

Gets easy last hits, and at the same time keeps enemy harassed enough to scare them away manning up on you, then you can last hit with auto attack as well. My best record in the 7 games I've played in last weekend is minute 12 bloodstone.  I didn't need to leave offlane and enter the jungle for getting farm, even if I did I doubt it would be effective. Because in pubs, most likely there will be a jungler already there since you are solo offlaning, and supports won't stack much for you.  Later in the game you'll have stun anyway."

I didn't need to leave offlane and enter the jungle for getting farm, even if I did I doubt it would be effective.    This makes me doubt you actually even play leshrac.  You have a lot to learn and a long way to improve as a lesh player if you think farming the jungle is not effective. That's true for 99% of carries, but especially lesh, because he can farm multiple camps at once, and clear paths through trees."

Never tried to climb, never stuck with few heroes)  Lesh could have serious problems against duos/tris who are dangerous from the first level, but after getting a few levels it gets easier.  Also by jungling, I meant early game jungling, where you failed in lane and trying to get back up. Later in the game you can already jungle in anyway you want, this is besides the point."

If you make it work, you make it work. I just can't get behind the idea that it's leshrac.   I mean, looking at your dotabuff, in the games you win, you're getting serious farm, much more than I would expect from an offlaner in an even game.

TrueDoTA2,382ex1,V-ktr,1 point,Mon Jun 1 18:32:44 2015 UTC,"The lane your up against will be a huge factor, but I've tried this offlane build, and it's pretty effective.  The major issue is keeping your mana up, and 75% of your last hitting will be via lightning which doubles as hard hitting harass.  The range on Lightning is 800, and all you have to do is be within 800 of the nearest creep, the bounces will take care of the rest.  Your biggest fear should be long-range stuns that can be stacked.  Otherwise you should be able to keep a large distance between you and the creep wave.  One bonus that comes with Lightning is that you can still last hit with a support between you and the creeps due to the lightning bounce.  It takes a lot of practice to time it all and get a feel for Offlane Lesh, but from what I've seen/experienced it works fairly well in capable hands."
TrueDoTA2,382ex1,V-ktr,1 point,Mon Jun 1 20:51:06 2015 UTC,"Offlane lesh has been a thing for a while.  You need both supports to stop him from getting levels, and then that keeps them low level.  Once you get level 6 you can pull some serious 1v3 kills."
TrueDoTA2,382ex1,Phritz777,2,Mon Jun 1 16:44:35 2015 UTC,"I am still improving my games, but I find letruck works best as a mid. I alternate maxing my lighting and stun with emphasis on lightening foe the harass and farm. I usually go tango and gg branch x2 into bottle. Then arcane boots and start building Euls.   From here I either go bloodstone or oct core.  If the game will go long and we are ganking well, the bloodstone will be great in the long run. I then build right into Oct core. This item is a game changer for lesrach with the life steal from spells. Your ulti keep you healed as long as you don't get killed by crits or everyone focusing on you. It has great range and damage and allows you to provide dps at the edge of the fight without much personal risk. If someone wants to fight, zap with your e, stun with q, cast w, and use Euls if needed.   Important note on euls, your ulti works like dp ulti and will still do damage if you are in the air and it already running.   I am still working on this and don't have many games, but at my mmr (2400 solo, 3.1k party) it works well.   http://www.dotabuff.com/players/11235089/matches?date=&hero=leshrac&skill_bracket=&lobby_type=&game_mode=&region=&faction=&duration=&timezone=Etc%2FUTC"

I found most success when buying like full regen (tango salve clarity mango etc.) possibly 2 mangos and rushing boots or soulring dependent on the lane. I did a similar build but 1-1-2 by 4 then max E -> W (and R whenever available)  Lightning spam is so damn strong and you aren't that afraid of trading right clicks with supports due to immense regen and extra hp per/sec from mango(s).

So it accelerates your dmg output and mana usage as 4 tics would do 70 + 204 = 150 mana vs double-ticking at 2seconds each = (70 + 20 + 20)2 = 220 or 70 extra mana for toggling the ultimate on.   It's up to ~1 second faster in upcomming dmg dependent on how fast you toggle the spell on and of so yeah considering infinite mana it's always worth doing so.

The mana is so little compared to what you are spamming out, you are going to get soul ring early anyway, you might even get a bottle.  The extra 4 armor has saved my ass so many times, and you should definitely be rotating at some point, which is faster with Tranquils.  This is the only big gripe I have with Leshrac item builds in general.  My personal preference is to get force staff after Bloodstone, but there are lots of other good options as well.  As for offlane, I guess.  Like some other commenters have said, the farm is important.  You aren't really scary until bloodstone, but once you have that, you can get a lot done, and the earlier it is the more impact you will have.  When I get farm as Leshrac, on average, games are much shorter and more successful than when I try to play support because everybody else picked melee carry."
TrueDoTA2,382ex1,EDDE12345678,6,Mon Jun 1 12:42:25 2015 UTC,You always go Arcanes on Leshrac because you always (as a core) go Bloodstone. You just disassemble the Arcanes when you go to finish your bloodstone and then upgrade to whatever boots you want after.
TrueDoTA2,382ex1,Furryk,2,Mon Jun 1 12:47:51 2015 UTC,"I'm going to continue to challenge the conventional wisdom and say that Tranquils are as good or better.  Sure I do this very thing on Timbersaw, but he has built-in regen.  It's a different situation.  Getting tranquils you might get bloodstone a minute later, but you can be more aggressive in lane, possibly securing kills or avoiding death that make up for the 500 you spend on the rings.   Also I forgot to address the ""stunless"" part of the OP.  I really value split earth highly, even as a single point, and will often skill it first for a rune fight.  So I would have a hard time skipping it altogether.  Then again, Leshrac can be sort of like Mirana in that some games the stuns just don't seem to hit at all, and you get your ass kicked."

I think you can skill stun once and go something like 1-1-4-1 by level 7(1-0-2-0 by level 3). It is definitely worth to try. I just feel like  the difference between lvl 1 and 2 edict is too much.  Getting tranquils before arcane I don't think is a good idea though. With spamming storm you need all the mana you can get, while trying to keep away enemies from yourself. Ideally, they shouldn't get near you so you should manage to sustain yourself with tangoes and passive regen from soul ring."

If your trying to reach for a higher MMR, every win is a step forward and every loss is a step back. You start to feel scared of stepping too far back and every time you step forward you don't want to risk losing your progress.  However, if your simply trying to improve, every win and loss is a step forward. If your good enough to have a higher MMR then your  MMR will rise gradually; don't expect 40 wins in a row.  I think a good mentality to have is knowing that when you improve at the game, you will reach a higher MMR. To have this mentality you need somewhat trust the MMR system and realise that improving and climbing MMR takes time.  Maybe this won't help, but when I play with this mentality I manage to become less emotionally-attached to each win/loss and find it easier to queue again.  Also I think playing 2 games at a time is a good place to start. There is little more depressing (in DotA,) than losing your 3rd game, regardless of whether you win or lose the first 2."

It's one match that is completely isolated from any other match. If you have the mental/emotional fortitude, you'll be best served as a player if you think about what you could have done to improve in the match. Consider reviewing these parts of the replay.   Another concept that I keep firmly in mind is that being on tilt can often lead to a toxic attitude. Do not let toxicity take over. Toxicity creates a team imbalance. You already have 5 enemies on the opposing team, do you really need to create 4 more on your own? I don't like the odds of winning that matchup.    Ultimately you ask yourself some simple questions: *Did my last game suck? *Is there anything I can do to change the outcome of that game now that it's over? *Is there anything I can do to change the outcome of my next game? *Am I going to fixate on it in a negative way and tilt or a positive way and learn?    You must embrace the logical best possible outcome. There is only one way to answer those questions if you want to be a better player. Those same answers will make you a better person. Be positive and learn something so you actually create a team advantage in your next game (delight in the fact that you just lost 25mmr and matchmaking thinks you're weaker than you really are). Or be negative and prematurely sabotage your next game. To tilt or not to tilt, the decision has always been yours."

I know it's weird but I try to go into every game with some faith in my teammates and sometimes it doesn't happen and I get disappointed but it goes away. Also it's only a game :) there are always plenty more to come and if you're good enough you will naturally carry a lot of games yourself.

I sometimes go on tilt when other people blame me, which the muting helps... but more often, it's because I want to find someone to blame, so I start flaming my own team.  It's a form of self-handicapping where I can tell myself that I didn't lose the game, my teammates lost it for me.  I stopped flaming as much when I became aware that flaming is just a way to stroke my own ego and tell it that everything is OK and it's not my fault.

TrueDoTA2,383699,maxemoe,1 point,Mon Jun 1 23:26:06 2015 UTC,"Self-handicapping:       Self-handicapping is a cognitive strategy by which people avoid effort in the hopes of keeping potential failure from hurting self-esteem.  It was first theorized by Edward E. Jones and Steven Berglas,  according to whom self-handicaps are obstacles created, or claimed, by the individual in anticipation of failing performance.   Self-handicapping can be seen as a method of preserving self-esteem but it can also be used for self-enhancement and to manage the impressions of others.  This conservation or augmentation of self-esteem is due to changes in causal attributions or the attributions for success and failure that self-handicapping affords. There are two methods that people use to self-handicap: behavioral and claimed self-handicaps. People withdraw effort or create obstacles to successes so they can maintain public and private self-images of competence.  Self-handicapping is a widespread behavior amongst humans that has been observed in a variety of cultures and geographic areas. For instance, students frequently participate in self-handicapping behavior to avoid feeling bad about themselves if they do not perform well in class. Self-handicapping behavior has also been observed in the business world. The effects of self-handicapping can be both large and small and found in virtually any environment wherein people are expected to perform.

TrueDoTA2,37ybav,physics223,10,Sun May 31 12:40:17 2015 UTC,"He hasn't really changed much. He'd just been given a lot more opportunity to shine.  You can either tank him up with urn > drums > blademail (if being focused) > glimmer > shiva's/assault in a deathball team and use him as an initiator. Lategame pickup more utility items based on team needs like halberd or lotus.  Or you can pick up items like Urn, Shadowblade (Highly underrated item on SB. Invis charges with bonus damage on the first hit are great ganks, the initial bash does not break invisibility), MoM, or Armlet in a ganking team and use him for pickoffs. Lategame pick up more carry items like a mjol and drop the mask for a satanic.  The one thing you don't want too do with him now is deny him early levels and preferably farm so no trilanes with another carry unless you think you can go aggressive tri and make some great early plays. He is optimal if active early and needs treads + 1 item to really pull off either role well IMO.  Most skill builds pick up charge first, then bash, then a point in aura. After that, most max bash first then charge but sometimes charge is better than bash if you're going more for the utility tank build."
TrueDoTA2,37ybav,brinebold,4,Sun May 31 13:57:27 2015 UTC,Agh's is very good on a utility build. It's like a bkb piercing sven stun.
TrueDoTA2,37ybav,Thalnagath,6,Sun May 31 16:47:38 2015 UTC,"I second this.   Many people say aghs on Bara is weak, but it's a bkb piercing stun with a huge range and 12 second cooldown, it's like Clockwork hook but can't miss."
TrueDoTA2,37ybav,Brave_lil_Nora,4,Sun May 31 19:41:36 2015 UTC,Good point but I think it's the semi-interruptible nature that legitimately throws people off the agh's.

There are the odd ones here and there, that's why I still prefer shadow blade.  but yeah bkb and SB/GC are very necessary as it seems like.  He is a very fun hero to play and very versatile.   With Shadow Blade a deadly ganker that isn't seeing rushing in at ~800 ms  Bkb makes him nearly unkillable.  Aghs strengthens his utility.  He has weak points but the new items are pretty decent on him and he is finally coming back into the meta."
TrueDoTA2,37ybav,Brave_lil_Nora,1 point,Sun May 31 23:43:53 2015 UTC,Tbh though with the range upgrade on the aghs to 900 you don't need to initiate with the charge. You can legitimately glimmer (or follow-up SB after the ult) and then charge. This can potentially guarantee two greater bashes towards your team to really mess up their positioning.

I've played SB and he's my go to for crushing ranked as an offlaner against a weak early team.  I'm personally loving going treads-urn-shadow blade-bkb-(if needed)-(any form of armor will do it depends on the situation)-and it's super situational after that but don't underestimate aghs scepter!  I would say no to late game life steal items, because bara's natural right click is pathetically weak and you are not a pa.   If you have enough items to have good attack speed, damage, an armor item, a good utility item, and you can afford a satanic as an offlaning SB you already won lol.    you won't get much from a satanic considering the cost of it.  You are a balls to the wall ganker that will often die from ganks, but you will create space and get kills.  That's why people get mask of madness.    The best thing about SB is how goddamn tanky he is early and mid game.  He has amazing starting hp and he starts with like 5 armor.  This allows you to survive ganking that SF under tower and taking his death ult to the face.  That's why I say no to mask of madness.  You will almost always die and you need the gold without losing most of it from dying if that makes sense."

Yeah, Bash and ult are magic damage, but Crest lets you tank up and gank very well (+-10 armor 30% evasion/miss) and being able to give it to allies is super good."
TrueDoTA2,37ybav,Dirst,1 point,Sun May 31 22:59:32 2015 UTC,"I really favor a tank/utility build for Spirit Breaker. Not much has changed for him, but I do think Glimmer Cape and Lotus Orb could be very good items choices. Glimmer Cape would be nice due to SB natural get-all-up-in-the-face style and he could avoid being bursted down. Lotus Orb for the same reasons. The longer SB lives to sow chaos and disruption in a team fight, the better. My favorite items are Urn, Aghs, BKB, Armlet, Blademail, Heaven's Halbred.   I know some people will disagree, but I think Mask of Madness is a bad pickup since it goes against my philosophy of being a tanky monster in the middle of teamfight."
TrueDoTA2,3809g5,EDDE12345678,5,Sun May 31 22:04:59 2015 UTC,"He can definitely hold his ground against many other traditional mids with low-HP and no natural sustain. SS, Zeus, QoP, SF etc all depend on tangos/bottle to heal up and are not particularly tanky. Warlock has two great damage over time abilities in the form of his Q and W, which once landed cannot be dodged. He's not very mobile and thus perhaps not the best at rune control, but with enough harass in lane and delaying the other mid's bottle, he might be okay at it.   Counters would probably be anyone with lots of HP and/or regen, like Dragon Knight, Necrophos, and Bloodseeker. Slark might do pretty well, too, since he has a purge against the DoTs and a decent pair of nukes himself in the form of Pounce + Pact.  He can gank pretty great with a single level of Upheaval and Chaotic Offering, and the uptime of the Golem makes it easy to push immediately following a successful kill.   In short, he's not going to dominate all the time, but he definitely fits in with the early push/kill meta. So long as you're not facing anyone who can outheal your harass or has a harass advantage (Lina, Sniper, Skywrath) or beat you at level 6, he should be pretty good."

TrueDoTA2,3809g5,jobsak,2,Mon Jun 1 06:03:11 2015 UTC,"When to Warlock  I think he's fine when:   You can control the game enough to fight around Warlock's ult You can get Warlock consistent farm   In part because he does not farm well outside getting Midas and needs to have good ults that result in kills/pushes This also means that he doesn't die repeatedly at mid from ganks ==> only get him if you can rotate a support to mid occasionally, or the other team cannot effectively gank a Warlock  You aren't going super late / are not relying on Warlock to be a late-game core   Eventually Warlock will turn into a Utility/Support if the game goes long enough    Who Might Like Warlock as a meta pick  I think he might be a meta pick for teams that focus on:   Team fighting Timed pushes 25-40 minute game ending windows (give or take) Giving their heroes what they need to be effective (e.g. for Warlock this might mean support rotations to mid to guarantee a good lane)   Concerns Around Picking Warlock   Has difficulty catching up in farm Golems are effective when you are ahead In late game Warlock's ult is mostly just a stun (at least in the context of team fights) ==> you lose a lot of your raw damage (still contributes with Fatal Bonds) Generally have to fight around his ult"

TrueDoTA2,3809g5,wildtarget13,2,Tue Jun 2 00:00:50 2015 UTC,"I think it's only good in pubs versus lineups that have heroes with lots of core items that can't find room for diffusal. A lot of agility heroes already can buy diffusal but possibly refuse to because of reasons they've invented in their head, like PA, Viper, Morphling. They have other items that help also, like Mek viper, BKB PA, and ehtereal blade morph. But if you own a Warlock's early game with good golem kills, you'll have won a huge part of the game if they're devoting farm to a core warlock.   You can buy it on supports to act as a Lotus orb, Abbadon sort of effect. Or you can buy it on heroes with any attack speed that don't have a desolator.   I don't think he's going to be a huge meta pick right now as long as Phantom Lancer who even weak competitive drafters have glaring in their head as diffusal carriers.   If he's strong right now to you, people who you're playing against just aren't used to playing against it probably or countering it effectively. The same could be argued for any unpopular hero, especially in pubs, where if your average pubber hasn't seen an elder titan in a while, they won't remember to build armor and magic resist. Or if they're playing against OD, they won't build INT items if they have low INT or magic immunity to stop the orbs."
TrueDoTA2,3809g5,wildtarget13,1 point,Mon Jun 1 00:03:33 2015 UTC,"well pl is a hero who is gonna have ban priority in lots of games anywhy so you ban him and than if they pick od or legion than make it a support warlock with max upheealvel comboing with slark riki ursa or a carry who needs to stick on his or her target. And while people arnt countering him like they wpould if he was more popular other unpopular heroes aren't having the same success when they are picked(death prophet, doom, timber and od all of which have win rates below 50%) while warlock is with 55% he has also seen some success in pro games recently like col vs NAR in ti5 qualifiers"
TrueDoTA2,3809g5,EdenBlade47,1 point,Mon Jun 1 00:36:08 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I have to ask, why in particular is legion od a counter to warlock? I'm not saying they don't do well against warlock, but that's because warlock really doesn't counter anyone specifically except maybe Meepo with fatal bonds.  I'm aware that core warlock is a thing, March did it last TI in my most recent memory and it was a first phase ban against them for flavor/respect reasons.   But many teams who practive probably don't have in their player arsenal, say a patch ago, to go diffusal on troll warlord or juggernaut, even when those heroes carried the item very strongly. Most of them would probably forget and still buy madness/lifesteal into BKB.  Winrates are an interesting story. But it's not what I do when it comes to theory crafting versus pick rates.   DP, Doom, and Timber all have many reasons why they aren't played. The first I can think of is how ""easy"" and fun poeple may think those heroes are. Not to mention DP and Doom were popular and then the game changed a lot.   As good as warlock is as a support for pubs, the supports right now are very centered around having reliable disable again. As usually, earthshaker, lion, and rubick are big. Warlock has good teamfight, but as a support will have a hard time finding level 6 if he's making space for his carry. Aui_2k tried to do it for a while, and it was hit and miss.   I just don't think he's going to become even a t2 meta pick any time soon as long as Pro Players dont' bother investing time to think of strategies around him that really favor him. I think most of them would probably go along the same line of thought that I have that many heroes can buy diffusal. If anything he'll be a very one time only pocket strat or 5th pick wonder."
TrueDoTA2,3809g5,kieran_n,2,Mon Jun 1 02:52:28 2015 UTC,Legion's Overwhelming Odds deals 25% of summons' HP in addition to the regular damage. OD's Arcane Orb does 100/200/300/400 extra pure damage in addition to the base damage to summons and illusions.

TrueDoTA2,3809g5,kieran_n,3,Mon Jun 1 03:25:44 2015 UTC,"Damage type is generally irrelevant for magic immunity piercing. Some abilities pierce and others don't depending on balance needs.

TrueDoTA2,3809g5,wildtarget13,2,Mon Jun 1 06:07:48 2015 UTC,It's also why Pugna actually makes a good counter to OD: nether ward really messes with him since he burns mana so fast (100 mana per attack = 175 health lost per attack. Sanity does 568 damage to himself at lvl 3 and astral hits him for 315).  All this happens to a hero with only 1k HP at 16 so he has to pop a BKB just to be able to cast anything without taking out half his health by the cast alone (assuming you have wards up).

Aghs, veil, dagon, Necro, whatever. It all doesn't matter after a point because you're going to face (near or actual) magic immunity at some point. If you had those three items and are wrecking with it, you likely could be doing it even harder with a traditional build. It's a pretty uncontested fact that a Huskar with armlet just has more to offer. You can farm faster with it and just never die to magic once you hit level 4 in your passive.   Point I'm getting at is, if you had all three, you could have had HotD, armlet, and an AC instead. Eventually your mage build will fall off, and when it does you might be crying because you had the potential to possibly end the game by crushing them with right click.  Am I telling you it's a bad idea and should never be done? No. But unless you have a necro on your team, the 60% dmg from aghs will fail you eventually. Someone will dodge it and come back at you, or just stun you down and kill you before you can finish them with your shitty right click."

TrueDoTA2,37ytbn,Dancatpro,10,Sun May 31 16:27:09 2015 UTC,"Rushing anything aside from rad on naga (after the ever vital aquila) is never a good thing to do, unless for a really good reason, as radiance boosts your farming speed so fucking much. Sure, after that, if there's something you really wanna stop from hitting you, like doom or rupture, sure, go ahead and get a linkens, but never as a first item."
TrueDoTA2,37ytbn,PeenoyDoto,5,Sun May 31 17:08:07 2015 UTC,"I personally kinda hate the radiance rush heroes like spectre and naga, because last hitting creeps for so long is just kinda boring to me.  But OP, naga is the absolute best radiance carrier by a mile.  It boosts your farm and if micro'd right you can farm half the map with illusions.  You can watch players like purge play Naga get a a radiance from playing mid or safe and then their gpm goes through the roof.     I don't see why you rush linkens it seems like a really situational in general and I don't even like building it on weever, it's just so expensive and just gives you a little damage and attack speed, why be hard to kill if you're not even a big threat?  I'd rather take out a WD or a ES who has their ulti up than a naga with a rushed linkens sphere mid game that gets some health and armor, 25 damage, and 15 AS from a 5100 gold item.  The active is great don't get me wrong but won't a naga be mostly attacked by aoe spells anyways, and isnt it already hard enough to get single target spells off since she is always surrounded by illusions?"
TrueDoTA2,37ytbn,kpub51,0,Sun May 31 23:38:19 2015 UTC,"Spectre is not a radiance rush hero.  It's not a bad build on her if you have the opportunity (really good lane farm/first blood), but you should be thinking about Diffusal, Yasha/Manta, or Vanguard on her after boots (and maybe urn if that's your thing) in 90% of games, specially in this current meta, or else you're ""doing it wrong"".  She is so damned strong with any of the above and so much quicker than radiance.  Remember she's not even all that special WITH radiance, it's not until after you build another item that it becomes interesting and by then given today's meta the game is decided either way and you really weren't part of it."
TrueDoTA2,37ytbn,feralminded,3,Wed Jun 3 15:37:26 2015 UTC,I think icefrog balanced radiance really well it's such a major pain to deal with now. You basically get rewarded as a radiance holder f you survive the early game and slight boost to farming as well. Always get radiance now no matter how late it is that's how game changing it can get.
TrueDoTA2,37ytbn,forkkind,5,Sun May 31 18:49:27 2015 UTC,"People are dismissing this very quickly but this used to be the go-to build back at TI2 when Naga was the highest priority carry of the tournament. However mind you Naga was played a safelane carry. I still think it's a decent build, but like others have said at the moment radiance on Naga is just too good to pass up on. I think the rtz build(aquila -> radiance -> BoT, then either octa or manta) is superior, but Linkens is definitely not bad on her."

TrueDoTA2,37ytbn,Turtlez4lyfe,1 point,Tue Jun 2 17:05:38 2015 UTC,"The play happened because of an execution error on iG's part, and the difference between Dota 1 and Dota 2. In Dota 2, there is a small gap between song ending and ravage, so there was time to BKB"
TrueDoTA2,37ytbn,AbareKiller,1 point,Wed Jun 3 00:48:53 2015 UTC,"Strictly speaking, that's the Meracle build, though I believe people were doing it before him nobody really saw its full potential.  And rtz didn't invent Octarine on Naga either. As far as I can tell /r/truedota2 did and the first pro I saw use it was Pajkatt and it spread from there.  But yeah, Linken's is definitely very good on Naga but nowhere near as good as Radiance."
TrueDoTA2,37ytbn,non_clever_name,2,Mon Jun 1 05:43:01 2015 UTC,"I can see it being viable if you're playing Naga as more of a ganking hero.   Linken's  is normally my go to item on heroes like Bounty Hunter who need to be able to fight one person at a time and avoid a stun or hex to kill them.   On a hero like Naga who is normally played as a farming carry, I can't see it having any synergy  with that role.  However, if you are playing a fighting Naga (similar to the classic antimage build of no battle fury) I can see it being viable since you will be able to straight up wreck supports midgame with your team because of Naga's net and armor reduction while having more hp an regeneration than you would with only a radiance.  This style of play is untraditional and a bit more risky though since you are relying on kills for farm, so I'm not entirely sure that it would be better than the radiance meta."
TrueDoTA2,37ytbn,Ishmael_KingOfTheSea,2,Sun May 31 17:29:44 2015 UTC,"Naga Siren in a core role without Radiance is living up to a fraction of her potential. There are heroes far more suitable to rushing Linken's than Naga (not like a good Linken's timing is outright bad on most heroes, but you have to consider the big picture—Radiance does a ton for Naga and it's just been buffed)."
TrueDoTA2,37ytbn,Harlequeens,1 point,Mon Jun 1 01:14:36 2015 UTC,"People are saying don't get linkens. They are mostly right.  But I'll bear with you for a second. Radiance naga doesn't fight early and skills 4-0-4-1 With optional points in net, but never past one and get stats so they can have illusions with stats once you have radiance. If you go linkens....I would even consider going as far as building Agility right clicking illusions. Something like diffusal, butterfly, octarine. Your illusions probably can still clear camps, but would not be as fast as radiance. In this situation, I would even go as far as to go a less illusion heavy build and go 1-4-4-1 to get kills with Net+Riptide. I would probably get something like soul ring into linkens instead of bottle. Just be warned that naga does like no damage with a linkens. Going diffusal first is probably the right choice. Sticking to radiance when you have no other items and your team is losing won't be salvaged by radiance most of the time since you won't have a strong net and your team was already 4v5ing and essentially needs to split push without radiance and defend high ground without it. Even with it, sometimes the enemy just has too strong of a deathball. A radiance less naga finding agility+stats heavy illusions+octarine is what you will have to have to use as a poverty transition build. Maybe after a diffusal+maybe drum you can go back for radiance, which is probably what you should do if you don't see the game ending soon. Late game radaince isn't bad if you have to keep up the split push.   Also, if you do this: you have to set up kills with net around the map. You're pretty becoming the S4 space creator for your team. Aghs might even be better, but let's not go overboard into support 4 position status yet. Sometimes your team wants to do the exact same thing you want to do:farm and assume someone else is going to distract the enemy and protect you the oh so important core/carry. But naga is one of the few heroes that can do so really well instead of getting a radiance. Song to save allies, net goes through BKB. Illusions give great vision. It's why she can be played as a support. Being a 3 position that can song and then net+diffusal you to death can be a thing if your offlaner can't intiate and your mid is another farm intensive hero like Tinker (you should've lost at this point in the draft, doesn't mean you can't change your game plan in a pub, especially if you're the naga)."
TrueDoTA2,37ytbn,wildtarget13,0,Mon Jun 1 07:58:47 2015 UTC,Why not do a Drums + Diffusal build instead? The build is better and you'll have pretty good killing potential just buy yourself.
TrueDoTA2,37ytbn,CNHphoto,2,Mon Jun 1 00:19:13 2015 UTC,"If you want to play PL just play PL. PL is literally better than drums+diffusal Naga in every way. If you're going to play the hero as a core, just buy Radiance."
TrueDoTA2,37ww8i,shockkk,7,Sun May 31 02:02:10 2015 UTC,"Naga is my favorite hero and I've been collecting the points with her a bit right now. Octarine Core absolutely core on a carry Naga. It just synnergises with your goal way too well.    You become more mobile due to BoTs cool down reduction You can get more illusions out with both mirror image and manta You are more safe with reduced cool down on ult You don't need to go back to base to refill mana   All of this leads to more split push. Of all my games the spell life steal has seemed fairly negligible. It's been nice in a couple of games where my illusions were killed and I was buring all five of them. But, generally your burn isn't always affecting the enemy heroes, your illusion burn is, so you get far less life steal in fights than you should.  When to get Core? Best case is you go radiance, BoTs, manta, core. Core is way more useful when you have manta than just mirror image and BoTs. If I'm unable to farm safely, I might go pms, bottle, aquila, arcanes, radiance, core, BoTs, manta. The early tripple mana items isn't necessary if your lane is going well, but if you can only farm lane with illusions and are forced to reside in jungle more, it will sustain your mana well enough to spam spells.  What items next? Diffusal is just too good to not get. And while heart sustain isn't too necessary, you still want the beef from it. Also you still want the damage from butterfly; the evasion is nice, but not necessary. Because of slot problems I usually get skadi because it's the best of both worlds. Your 6 items should be BoTs, radiance, manta, core, diffusal, skadi. Sometimes you just need heart over skadi if they have really heavy spell cores though."
TrueDoTA2,37ww8i,Sublixt,2,Sun May 31 08:27:35 2015 UTC,"In that thread I criticized it. I've changed my mind. I like it after Radi/BoTs/Yasha now. Reasons I changed my mind:   Naga doesn't have the mana to spam all her spells normally. But with Octarine, you can cast Mirror Image and Riptide as much as you want while still having mana to Song and TP, or net someone. Octarine single handedly gives her enough mana to use whatever she wants. 33% more illusion uptime, 33 second BoTs CD, 45 second Song CD. I completely forgot that Octarine works on item CDs as well. That doesn't affect Naga too much but a shorter CD on Manta and BoTs gives her some superb ratting and escaping. The HP it gives is actually pretty good. It's no Skadi or Heart but it actually is a decent durability increase for the illusions.   A well played Naga can probably win 90% of their games if they can get an Octarine with any decent timing. Of course, in this meta, that actually isn't as easy as it sounds."
TrueDoTA2,37ww8i,DangerAwar,2,Sun May 31 06:58:34 2015 UTC,You can also go arcane boots early for the mana sustain.  Then disassemble for bots and keep the arcane booster for the eventual Octarine core.
TrueDoTA2,37ww8i,Drop_,1 point,Sun May 31 07:34:29 2015 UTC,Why not? Naga is pretty potent in the early game.
TrueDoTA2,37ww8i,Thalnagath,1 point,Sun May 31 16:42:35 2015 UTC,"I've played a couple of Naga games and I think OC is very good on her. I honestly think that once you have OC and Radiance, it's gg. The rest of the game is just a formality honestly. If you play correctly, the enemy has no chance to kill you, push lanes or ever cross the river.  I'm not entirely sure when to get it though. Before or after Manta Style? Personally I like it a lot more pre-Manta since it boosts your farm a bit as well. It also pretty much gets rid of all of your mana problems on the hero.  My 6 slot on Naga is now BoTs/Manta/Radiance/OC/Skadi/Diffusal. Heart and Butterfly are ignored since evasion is given by Radiance (Miss chance but essentially the same thing), Heart out because OC + Skadi give more or less the same hp and with the spell leech on Naga, you have no hp problems anymore. The benefit of Skadi + Diffusal also means that you do quite a significant amount of physical dps as well whereas Heart did nothing for your right click. Diffusal also gives more agi for your illusions than Butterfly."
TrueDoTA2,37ww8i,somethingToDoWithMe,1 point,Sun May 31 03:53:23 2015 UTC,"It should boost your farm more than yasha or manta, which to mean seems like it should be picked up before it.    On the other hand a single yasha is really cheap."
TrueDoTA2,37ww8i,Drop_,1 point,Sun May 31 07:32:51 2015 UTC,"I didnt catch your post, but I did play naga with oc in a couple of games on 5700+ just 1-2 weeks ago so here are my thoughts:  OC is definitely a great item on naga, but is not a replacement for heart as you said. Its more of a replacement for butterfly, here's why: As soon as you get oc even the minor rightclickers on the enemy team will get mkb, and that makes getting bfly wasted, and your illusions will still die, not necessarily from autoattacks or mgc dmg but combination of both, and you gonna find out that even though the illusions get lifesteal from the radiance you still need to tank them up. If you are vs a tinker or lesrhac or aghs timber etc. you just have to get a heart, the lifesteal from the oc or the bonus hp doesnt help for shit in these cases, but i think in most games you can get a skadi (which is much better overall) and still solve the problem.   The most important thing about it so to get it after the manta and after that its pretty much preference to the player of what to build next."
TrueDoTA2,37ww8i,dirtyslarkpicker,1 point,Sun May 31 07:21:27 2015 UTC,"Another important factor that I have seen in pro games is the heal that  she and her illusions get from the radiance burn. It isnt that much, but when your pair it with the new miss chance of radiance, it takes almost 5 more seconds to focus down an illusion."
TrueDoTA2,37wt3t,Thalnagath,12,Sun May 31 01:34:14 2015 UTC,"My opinions:  Phoenix is good 1v2 or 1v1.   Phoenix is not very good against lanes with lock down or who rely on spells rather than auto attacks to do damage.  I think he can work in a dual lane that really wants to go for kills,  but it's kind of greedy because he really needs xp and a bit of gold.  After level 3, Phoenix can solo kill pretty much any carry if they're left alone.    Level 1 ult isn't awful as long as you're staying ahead on levels and level 2 ult is really good.  I don't think the ult sucks... it just requires you to get fire spirits up on the dangerous people and hopefully you have a team where the enemy can't just all drop what they're doing to attack you while you're in the egg.  I think with Phoenix you kind of have to just create a ton of space and let your team snowball.    I don't know that he's that underpicked... he's like 27th in times picked this patch and 29th in p+b.    I think he's pretty bad against a lot of the other popular heroes this patch, though.   I think it's niche is that it shuts down right clickers before bkb and forces an action in team fights (aka if you don't kill this egg, you will die)."
TrueDoTA2,37wt3t,DroppinBird,9,Sun May 31 03:35:39 2015 UTC,"Agreed with your points. I feels like OP can't hit his fire spirits before he ulti or something. Lvl 1 ulti is really weak, but just compensate by not egging to close enemy heroes and the huge aoe will take care of all"
TrueDoTA2,37wt3t,chowies,2,Sun May 31 03:49:01 2015 UTC,level 1 ulti is like a 900 range aoe leshrac ult that doesnt cost mana and has a bkb piercing stun....
TrueDoTA2,37wt3t,manatwork01,5,Sun May 31 03:52:30 2015 UTC,"It's weakness is that it takes 5 hits... which means that it can be taken care of fairly easily if there's a big team fight going on.  The 8 attack version at level 11 is stronger because people usually haven't started building their attack speed items yet.    I don't think that calling it weak (even though I just did) is necessarily correct, it just requires a lot more effort I guess in how you decide to use it."
TrueDoTA2,37wt3t,DroppinBird,1 point,Sun May 31 03:57:32 2015 UTC,"I'm not even convinced that you'll die if you fail to pop the egg - maybe if you try to kill the egg and fail and then eat the stun, since you were probably getting pounded on while trying to kill the egg.  But if you ignore the egg, you're essentially fighting a 4v5 while Phoenix voluntarily stuns himself for 6 seconds.  Getting hit with a BKB piercing Ravage after 6 seconds will hurt, but if you've already killed an important hero (or two) in those 6 seconds, it probably won't make a big difference."
TrueDoTA2,37wt3t,chowies,6,Sun May 31 05:25:53 2015 UTC,"Dude, you are missing the point of phoenix.    The fire spirits aren't hard as connect with enemies if you launch them while diving. Plus the fire spirits deal tremendous damage: 280 X 4 = 1120 magical damage. Plus the big factor in the mid game is that enemies would not have magic immunity yet, and the fire spirits decrease attack speed by 140 percent.   What about the ulti? It is a 60 damage per sec for 6 secs for up to 360 damage. The large aoe almost guarantees that you will hit every enemy hero in the teamfight, so that is 360 health off every enemy. You focus too much on the stun part, which I agree is pretty weak (1.5s, 2s, 2.5s). You wouldnt want to use this because you want to stun people, and that is partly the reason why comboing other heroes like enigma, faceless, treant, doesn't necessarily win you the teamfight.   Also your point about dive scaling badly with damage is true. But choosing stats over points in dive is worse, in a way. An alternative is to add the skill points into sunray, but you will find that your meagre hp pool at low levels without items make punishing you for using sunray every easy. Just casual level 4 nuke and you will be close to death if not already dead.   Speaking of sunray, it is actually the one skill that allows phoenix to scale in the late game, because of how a portion of the damage it deals is based on the percentage of life the target has. People will under estimate the amount of damage you can deal and before they realize it they have eaten 50 percent worth of health from your sunray.   Your point about sunray being hard to hit is only partially legit. Because sunray is a line protruding from phoenix, it means that when phoenix turns, the end of the ray covers more distance as opposed to the start of the ray. In other words, when targeting enemies with this spell you want to keep them at a distance rather than hitting them with the start of your ray. If you can master this,you will learn that sunray is actually perfect for and  deadly for chasing escaping heroes, as phoenix can also move while raying. Sunray is also perfect for defending seiges because of its long range.   OP: if you TL:DR, phoenix has spells that I feel you are unable to master and therefore judge them as underwhelming. His damage potential goes through the roof and allows you to win teamfights in the midgame, giving you considerable mid game control. On the other hand, you do have a point in that phoenix feels underwhelming this patch, but not necessarily based on a) your assessment of the hero and b) you are under qualified to pass judgement since you have failed to master him. Rather, I find that when I play phoenix, I can dominate but still manage to fall off despite controlling the mid game, being 4 slotted with mek shiva midas refresher/halberd. On this your eye on the public winrate does have some traction and I'll give you that."
TrueDoTA2,37wt3t,pucklermuskau,-2,Sun May 31 07:33:31 2015 UTC,"Plus the fire spirits deal tremendous damage: 280 X 4 = 1120 magical damage.   If you hit all 4 on the same target, if you time them perfectly to land exactly as the last tick finishes so you don't overwrite any damage, if enemies will let you sit there and chain fire spirits together for 16 seconds.  In reality you'll do maybe half that much damage because you won't land all 4 spirits on the same target and you certainly won't chain them together perfectly.   But choosing stats over points in dive is worse, in a way. An alternative is to add the skill points into sunray, but you will find that your meagre hp pool at low levels without items make punishing you for using sunray every easy. Just casual level 4 nuke and you will be close to death if not already dead.   Sunray takes too much HP to use early, but taking stats to increase your health pool is bad because it's better to take an extra 20*4 damage on your mobility skill.  Wait, what?   People will under estimate the amount of damage you can deal and before they realize it they have eaten 50 percent worth of health from your sunray.   So you're relying on the enemy team not knowing how Phoenix works.  What happens when Phoenix is being used against competent enemies that discovered that standing in a giant laser beam is bad?"
TrueDoTA2,37wt3t,chowies,2,Sun May 31 13:15:36 2015 UTC,"you rarely want to hit your spirits on the same target. you want one instance on each hero in the fight, thus ensuring maximum damage, and crippling the fighting ability of the other team. phoenix is not a single target ganker, she's a team fight swinger."
TrueDoTA2,37wt3t,Magnets,-1,Sun May 31 17:28:37 2015 UTC,"Phoenix is male, specifically referred to as a ""son of suns.""  I can understand Fire Spirits being good for the first 20ish minutes of the game but after that Phoenix falls off hard compared to almost any other offlane choice, so why would you pick Phoenix over those other choices?  What does Phoenix bring to a fight or draft that can't be found elsewhere through items or a different hero?"
TrueDoTA2,37wt3t,pucklermuskau,1 point,Sun May 31 22:26:23 2015 UTC,"Dude, 600 damage is still pretty Fucking legit. Let's just assume you are shit at aiming the fire spirits, that would still guarantee a kill if you find someone alone.   Yes, you do actually take the extra levels in dive because there is no better alternative. And besides, dive like all his other skills can potentially hit more than one hero. Additionally you can use this to farm multiple camps with fire spirits,very effectively.   Competent enemies will still have a hard time dealing with sunray. If they are focused on getting out, they are moving and not doing any attacking. If they are trying to siege high ground, sometimes there really is no choice for them but to eat the damage because you are so far away. And as I said earlier, having your ray stick onto your target is actually easy once you know to keep them around the end of your ray, such that it actually is very difficult to dodge the ray. And let's not forget that the ray heals your allies: if your carry is manfighting the enemy carry, cast your ray and it'll make it very disadvantageous to him to continue. You can even use fire spirits while using ray, or even items like halberd, to make sure you help your carry win.   You will realize that phoenix has so many uses over some of the other offlaners. He has something to deal with any situation."

TrueDoTA2,37wt3t,Magnets,7,Sun May 31 22:27:28 2015 UTC,"Phoenix voluntarily stuns himself for 6 seconds.    Phoenix usually does spirits, dive then ult. The key point you are missing is that once you finish the ult it refreshes your dive/spirits.  Around the midgame I usually let the fight start then dive behind or to the side of the fight and do spirits -> ult. Once your ult finishes you have dive + spirits to catch any runners."
TrueDoTA2,37wt3t,sevhead,1 point,Sun May 31 10:38:43 2015 UTC,"exactly. early game the egg is there for the refresh, not the damage, and certainly not for the stun. early usage is as a way to stay in lane once youve brought yourself low, its only later in the game, with lvl11 ult and a blink dagger, that you can start being more aggressive, blinking into trees near an ongoing team fight to ult from an unhittable area."
TrueDoTA2,37wt3t,K_osoi,3,Sun May 31 17:31:04 2015 UTC,"You might not die if you ignore the egg, true.  But, if they're eating the egg damage/spirits damage/dive damage for the whole duration with new spirits and dive afterwards and you still lose the fight then it was either not a good fight or you would probably lose the fight regardless of who you picked.  Your team shouldn't be dying if you landed your fire spirits.  It's like undying tomb on steroids that doesn't last as long.  You either drop what you're doing to try and kill it, giving the rest of the team to try and get all of their stuff done in the fight, you run away from it, or you risk ignoring it and you take a ton of damage over the course of a fight.  I don't think Phoenix is an amazing hero right now or anything, but I definitely think he's a lot better than you give him credit for.  His biggest issue is that he falls off super hard ~30 minutes into the game."
TrueDoTA2,37wt3t,K_osoi,3,Sun May 31 14:15:21 2015 UTC,"I've been playing a lot of phoenix recently (3.6k solo ranked).  It is really weak before level 3, you can easily get zoned at level 1 and there's not much you can do about it.   After that it's a decent offlaner, the only problems are: you can easily push the lane if you spam spirits on enemies and tag the creeps. The dive has a really long buildup but is still a good escape.  Once you have tranquils + magic stick + urn you hardly ever go back to base.  The entire hero revolves around landing your spirits and getting your ult levels ASAP. I think one of the strongest things is that when you ult, people don't see the spirits burn effect and start to attack you then 1 second later realise their attack speed is fucked then start running."

Just a few examples (for pubs at least):   If the enemies or your team has a void or clockwork, Phoenix can dominate the teamfight. If you have an invoker or axe, Phoenix can act as a better initiator than magnus, especially if the enemy has many melee heros. For solo offlaning, Phoenix can often get more out of the lane against heros such as slark and do better against supports which only have stun projectiles. Phoenix needs no 2250 gold initiation item to become relevant in teamfights and thus, he can build items which actually support his team such as urn/euls/shiva. You can snag runes with icarus dive. Phoenix is great against the physical damage reliant meta due to his fire spirits. Sunray and support items which are purchased instad of something like blink allow you to push faster, take more towers and sustain teamfights.   Just naming a few. But again, it heavily depends on your and the enemy teams composition!"

Slark is one of the best counterpicks to Phoenix!  Just one point in Dark Pact nullifies his most effective and powerful spell.   Phoenix needs no 2250 gold initiation item to become relevant in teamfights and thus, he can build items which actually support his team such as urn/euls/shiva.   Sure, but he does less with gold than those blink initiators do.  Magnus with 7,500 gold is several orders of magnitude more dangerous than Phoenix with 7,500 gold.  This wouldn't be an issue except sending Phoenix solo offlane means you're intending to give him farm priority for at least a little while - so you're giving farm to a hero that almost doesn't scale with items.   Phoenix is great against the physical damage reliant meta due to his fire spirits.   Competitive data doesn't reflect this.  Fire spirits are unreliable and there are a lot of ways of getting around them.  Heroes like Luna and Gyro don't care if their attack speed is slowed because their primary damage source in the early phases of the game are their spells.  Heroes like Slark can purge the debuff automatically.  A Troll Warlord pick completely counters Phoenix.  What heroes are you talking about, that Phoenix is great against?  Most of the popular right-click heroes either don't right-click early in the game or have ways of more or less ignoring the impact of Fire Spirits.   Sunray and support items which are purchased instad of something like blink allow you to push faster, take more towers and sustain teamfights.   This doesn't bear out in the games I've watched.  Meka is terrible on Phoenix after its repeated nerfs and Phoenix typically doesn't go for Guardian Greaves to make the Meka worth buying.  Urn is good but literally any hero can get an urn.  Sunray is terrible for sustaining a push compared to Dazzle's heal, Omniknight's heal, Dubstep's aura, etc.  You're looking at getting maybe a Mekansm, most of a Eul's, or like Urn+something else for the same cost as a blink dagger.  Does Phoenix with a Meka have the same game impact as a Magnus or Axe with a blink dagger?  I'd say nowhere near as much, and he farms that item much slower than either of those heroes farm their blink."

Sure, but he does less with gold than those blink initiators do. Magnus with 7,500 gold is several orders of magnitude more dangerous than Phoenix with 7,500 gold. This wouldn't be an issue except sending Phoenix solo offlane means you're intending to give him farm priority for at least a little while - so you're giving farm to a hero that almost doesn't scale with items.   What level do you play at? Sending a hero to a solo offlane does not mean you are giving him farm priority. It actually means the opposite in most cases since 2 good supports can completely zone you.   Competitive data doesn't reflect this. Fire spirits are unreliable and there are a lot of ways of getting around them. Heroes like Luna and Gyro don't care if their attack speed is slowed because their primary damage source in the early phases of the game are their spells. Heroes like Slark can purge the debuff automatically. A Troll Warlord pick completely counters Phoenix.   Are we talking about competetive dota or pubs? In competetive dota, both magnus and phoenix offlane are niche picks at the moment. Also, saying something like ""troll warlord completely counters phoenixs"" is a somewhat useless argument. In that sense, enigma is a useless hero since silencer completely counters him or all physical dps heros are useless since omni ult counters them.  Also, I said twice that it heavily depends on your and the enemies team composition.   What heroes are you talking about, that Phoenix is great against? Most of the popular right-click heroes either don't right-click early in the game or have ways of more or less ignoring the impact of Fire Spirits.   Most storms don't know how to handle fire spirits and fuck up their zip-zap attacks. Slark will still get counterd since you can always reapply the buff after he dark-pacts and if he uses it solely for your 1 fire spirit, your team can initiate onto him with stuns. Also, it obviously doesn't scale into the lategame. Its main purpose is to make your egg near unkillable in the early game. At lvl 6/7, you can easily gank any lane and make something happen.  All in all, I'm not sure you understood what I was getting at. For the 4th time: It depends on the hero composition. If the enemy has a void, mag/axe will have 0 impact while phoenix does well against a chrono (egg outside+spirits, enemy team can't get to you). Same thing against e.g. a clock or enigma.  I am not arguing that a freefarmed magnus will, in most cases, have more impact than a phoenix. It is just that chances are you won't farm at all in the offlane. And while any disable + slark can easily solo a magnus, phoenix will be able to get a bit more out of the offlane. Which doesn't really say anything as both are not too usefull in the offlane at the moment."

I don't play at a high level (4k ish) but very few heroes are going to get good farm in the offlane vs decent supports in my opinion. Phoenix is able to get levels and doesn't need a blink dagger to be useful like other offlaners  (magnus,axe)."
TrueDoTA2,37wt3t,pucklermuskau,2,Sun May 31 15:48:44 2015 UTC,"Slark is one of the best counterpicks to Phoenix! Just one point in Dark Pact nullifies his most effective and powerful spell.   In theory, yes, but in game its far from that. In lane, you cant take a creep vs a good phoenix, because when it comes to purging yourself, if you use it when the first spirit lands, you gonna suffer from the rest and take insane amount of dmg, 1 dive here at this stage is enough to kill you, and if you save the purge for the last, you gonna die because the spirits deal insane amount of dmg starting from lvl 3, you'll for sure die again in this situation, and you cant kill him because dive breaks the leash and the range is insane. Magnus on offlane vs a slark is just a free kill, melee, skewer is bullshit, after 5 hits he wont have mana to even tp out. There's not a single melee carry that counters phoenix in laning stage (maybe jugg pre-spin nerf).   Fire spirits are unreliable and there are a lot of ways of getting around them.   Well, that's why he's not a retard-proof hero like tide for example, where just smashing buttons on your keyboard is enough to make it work. A good phoenix will in most cases hit his spirits, based on prediction, hiding in trees or just being out of visual range.  Think of phoenix like a brood in offlane - definitely op hero, can ruin your safelane and whole game if not properly counterpicked and requires a high skill to be played effectively, but however, these heroes in the hands of a low player will feed with them in most cases.   http://www.twitch.tv/waveafterwave2ndlife   Best phoenix pub player, I've played against this guy and god can he make this hero just looks insanely strong with 2 basic items.

TrueDoTA2,37wt3t,Drop_,1 point,Mon Jun 1 04:06:52 2015 UTC,"because the spirits deal insane amount of dmg starting from lvl 3   Why are you letting him get levels so easily?  He's slow, has negative starting armor, and even has low attack damage and range.  What're your supports doing?  By time Phoenix hits 3, your safelane farm hero should have enough levels that fire spirits don't much matter.  Spirits are also either damage on someone who's afk, or you carpet the area to get the debuff on them, sacrificing damage potential to do it.  I guess if they're a melee farmer who just brainlessly walks up to last hit you can get a ton of damage on them, but I don't see how a competent player is just going to let you tag them with slow moving spirits from 1400 range.  And if you're really worried, just pick a spell carry who doesn't rely on right-clicking for their damage and just bully phoenix out of lane.   Best phoenix pub player, I've played against this guy and god can he make this hero just looks insanely strong with 2 basic items.

TrueDoTA2,37ug1r,fanta34,12,Sat May 30 14:17:25 2015 UTC,"I don't follow the ""meta"" much from pro games. But what I've seen from my pub games is that games are much more active and it's much better to farm kills than farm creeps. Ember is very good at being effective early game. He also snowballs very hard if you play him right.  If you're mid, play him like puck. Ganking with team and making them snowball is much better than getting kills solo (not that it is bad). You NEED to be there in every fight! Play him like a space creator.   Mid-game, as heroes get tankier and get more levels in their magic spells, your magic shield becomes useless and you can no longer go  1v1 like early game. This is the time where you're maxing your SoF and getting battlefury. This is where you fall-off slightly (if you aren't playing position 1 and are mid). This is where I play a bit passive and start hitting creeps. Once you get your battlefury up, it's almost impossible to lose teamfights if you play properly (start playing him like sniper at this point). I've had so many comebacks with ember in this patch, simply because it's so hard to push against an ember with a battlefury and enemies simply underestimate him. Even if I'm having a rough game, I'm always confident that I'll snowball from kills after getting battlefury.  You can also go for Boots of travel and play him as an insane split pusher. If I'm slightly snowballing I get phase and become active. However if I'm losing and getting solo kills is tough, I ditch everything and go for BoT and split push like crazy. Enemies can never push as 5 this way and get fights in your favor this way. Honestly, I do this with most heroes during a losing game.  I'm not sure if I answered your question, this is more of a mindless ramble. So TL;DR Ember is more relevant than 6.83 because early game kills matter, which he excels at. You play him the same way you used to always."
TrueDoTA2,37ug1r,FusionX,1 point,Sat May 30 15:12:34 2015 UTC,Is it normal to get dumpstered by almost every mid as an Ember?
TrueDoTA2,37ug1r,FusionX,6,Sat May 30 15:16:51 2015 UTC,"Not really, you can always play defensive. Most mids are heavy magic nukers and you can deal with them with shield. I just soak xp in this case and hope for the best.  Bad mid matchups are: OD and QOP (edit: huskar too). Razor is also a bad matchup but not the worst. I think you can kill the rest of the mids at lvl 6 if you play smart (if I didn't miss anyone). Personally, this patch I've been losing mid a handful of times as ember but I almost ALWAYS make it up later."
TrueDoTA2,37ug1r,FusionX,2,Sat May 30 15:24:31 2015 UTC,"It is always Storm or QOP for me. QOP for obvious reasons, but Storm (regarded as a terrible laner himself) easily bosses me out of lane with overload stacks and right clicks, and it only gets easier for him when he gets his Orchid and insta kills me wherever I am because there is no way in hell I can get away from him or man fight him. The suffering never ends because he is picked in almost every game except in the lowest of the low MMR brackets."
TrueDoTA2,37ug1r,ferret_80,6,Sat May 30 15:34:00 2015 UTC,"Storm shouldn't be hard. He'll keep pushing into your highground and at lvl 4 you can harass him to low hp when he does that (shield and searing chains). Don't overdo it or he may kill you. Try to control the runes by pushing with shield or just missing few creeps. If you successfully get a couple of runes, he should be low at mana. At level 5, get 3 points in chain and 2 in shield. Check his mana, if he's low and he uses remnant near your high ground, immediately go on him and you should be able to kill him. While it's not important to kill him to win the lane, it's not an unfavorable matchup. I'll personally just try to harass him out of lane a couple of times with shield and chain to create some space for me to farm creeps.  Silence really messes up ember, but if you've good positioning you'll never get silenced. Be careful when storm is missing, don't split push, always stay behind one tanky teammate near mid game and don't go for solo kills if storm is missing. Think of how you'll play sniper when there's a storm in enemy team. During fights try to stay near a tower so he can't kill you from behind. If he tries to go on you, he has to go through your entire team. Even if he manages to do this, you should carry a defensive remnant so you can remnant away as soon as silence expires. You can also get manta or linkens, but I personally don't like it. Any good ember will never be in a position to get silenced. I've avoided getting silenced in teamfights against a skywrath and 2 orchid carriers."

TrueDoTA2,37ug1r,jamespirit,2,Sat May 30 19:46:34 2015 UTC,"Against storm you have to play passive until level 3, then have two levels of flame guard and play aggressively since he doesn't have enough damage to remove it.  use it to push lane near rune spawns and secure farm.  play very cautiously once he is 6.  If you can secure runes (usually with support help), prioritize bounty runes so that you get a brief window when you are 6 and he is 5 and immediately go for a kill.  If he hits 6 first, just play safe and look for ganks in side lanes, you can't kill storm unless he fucks up.  Against quop, an early level of sleight of fist will let you dodge shadowstrikes.  Remember that chains prevents blinks, you might be able to get a kill if a support helps you out.  This is actually a matchup you might want to consider going chains/sleight and use that to harass her.  once she's 6 just always have a safety remnant and look for ganks in side lanes.  be prepared for her to build orchid."

I used to get schooled as ember mid but these days I generally find I can count on a pretty sweet lane phase even with the inevitable support rotations.  A level 3 kill is really possible with 2 points in chain and one in flame or vice versa. Trade a bit when there is one or two creeps left then pop flame and chains= high % kill for me usaully.

TrueDoTA2,37ug1r,genetalgiant,5,Sun May 31 14:14:30 2015 UTC,Singsing played him as a safelane carry against NiP. He did well and got a lot of early kills because ember is a good carry for a lane with another disable because of his early lockdown and damage output
TrueDoTA2,37ug1r,Ziggyjunior,2,Sat May 30 15:09:57 2015 UTC,"He cannot thrive in a lane enough to make use of his early game power spike and then he needs alot of farm for his lategame power spike.

TrueDoTA2,37ug1r,TheArchist,2,Sun May 31 01:41:10 2015 UTC,"I've had success recently by playing him on the safe lane. I think he's too weak of a mid hero right now and the meta favors strong mids that can dominate the lane. If you go safe lane you can get a head start on lh as well as some kills on the enemy offlaner.  I usually try to rush BoTs after Aquila/Wand because it makes your farm accelerate later by sparing you TP scrolls, and it's an awesome item on Ember, you can join fights any moment and you can do the TPing to fountain - remnanting back out trick. Sometimes though I'll rush Battlefury if I have very good farm and I consider the game is going to go late.  I do the Battlefury build only in some cases, I used to always do it but I've found that Manta - Skadi or SnY or double Maelstroms or Silver Edge are all better depending on the situation. I don't buy Drums anymore, it just feels like it costs too much for what it does and slows you item progression in the mid game."

TrueDoTA2,37ug1r,DasEnde7861,1 point,Sun May 31 09:09:56 2015 UTC,"Honestly think he's great this patch, at least where i play him (3.2k). Yeah, he suffers against popular mids like QoP and Storm, but against a lot of other's he can hold his own and even get some kills out of it. You have to play around his power spike, which is lvls 7-11, where he has max chain and max flame guard, and 1 point in SoF to set up chains. Run around and gank side lanes if the opportunity presents itself, or make sure you have a tp in on you to counter-gank if one of your teammates is getting dived on. He can turn around fights super quickly within this power period and rack up kills for himself.   As for items, I like the rush BF build. Bottle -> Phase -> Battlefuryx2 -> Daedalus. From then on you can get a skadi or whatever your heart desires, as long as it works. If the other team has a silence that will fuck you over, build manta before your second battlefury. Stay on the edge of fights with SoF once you have your battlefury, and make sure you ALWAYS have a remnant up to get out of there. Try not to place it too far away from the fight in case you need to run back for an extra SoF to kill a target or two. But yeah, once he has a BF and a crit item, just position well and try to hit as many heroes with SoF + Chains spam as much as you can. If the enemy team  has an illusion carry or brood, building two battlefuries is ideal compared to building battlefury + daedelus."
TrueDoTA2,37ug1r,dirtyslarkpicker,1 point,Mon Jun 1 22:21:22 2015 UTC,"Seriously, BoTs first. I use to laugh at this build now I swear by it. It allows you to be in every fight and get free trips to base every 40 seconds. This is huge because he use to be a shit junglier pre battlefury, now you can farm with flame shield. Use all your bottles, heal and refill and repeat. Plus remnant is based off his movespeed so that's nice. After battlefury if you need to go aggressive get deso/crits/another battlefury for defensive linkins/skadi/bkb."
TrueDoTA2,37tpfj,Ukgamer66,5,Sat May 30 08:36:33 2015 UTC,"What you are asking for is an inexpensive channeling interrupt or lockdown. The game intentionally makes them expensive. Silence is an extremely strong mechanic and that is why only one item gives it.  Thinking about it, if it was a charge system like diffusal or drums, that could be the way to keep it somewhat balanced, but it wouldn't build into anything. Just a 2k item that gives 2.5 seconds of silence with 5 charges."
TrueDoTA2,37tpfj,Lazarous86,3,Sat May 30 14:30:50 2015 UTC,"What you are asking for is an inexpensive channeling interrupt or lockdown. The game intentionally makes them expensive.    Exactly. Silence, along with hex and stun are very strong abilities. Looking at items, we have Orchid (4075g) for silence, Scythe (5675) for hex, and Abyssal (6750g) for stun. No other items unless you count the procs from basher and MKB. If you want this stuff early you need to pick a hero with an abilty that does it.  To expand on this, try to think of how many heroes have multiple hard CC stuns/silence/interrupt abilities. You've got  AGI: Venge, Nyx  STR: Earthshaker, Clockwerk, Pudge, Tiny, Kunkka, Magnus, Tusk, Elder Titan, Earth Spirit, Night Stalker, Spirit Breaker   INT: Bane, Lion, Enigma, Disruptor, Shadow Shaman   And out of all of these, only Bane, Lion, Shadow Shaman, Venge, Spirit Breaker, and Night Stalker are ones with reliable unit targetting."

Although I think it will need to be around 1000 (medallion-ish pricing) Sages Mask + Robe of the Magi + Recipe  I would probably have the silence run on a 25 second cooldown which makes it only once per fight unless it is a long fight.

TrueDoTA2,37px1g,Sublixt,6,Fri May 29 14:30:02 2015 UTC,"I thought that was the old x? The new x only scales with cast range,  doesn't it?"
TrueDoTA2,37px1g,shinto_,6,Fri May 29 19:49:11 2015 UTC,"I'm assuming it's because level 3 X has a cast range of 750 and Boat travels 1000 range, but has an impact radius of 425. It's essentially the bare minimum for an almost-guaranteed boat."
TrueDoTA2,37px1g,Ballazard,2,Fri May 29 20:36:14 2015 UTC,"I prefer to get 4 levels in X because I can immediately cast my boat right on the X and then cast a torrent to maximize the CC.  Also, being able to initiate from 1000 range with X is really invaluable when you're about to siege a tower or get ready for a teamfight."
TrueDoTA2,37px1g,Drop_,5,Fri May 29 20:53:54 2015 UTC,"I played him last night and he seems unplayble to me now.   Needing to max X for it to be remotely useful really hurts.  Rank 1 torrent does no damage, and neither does rank 1 tidebringer.  I don't know, he just seemed like hot garbage mid trying both builds.    I didn't try 1/4/4/1, I did do 4/4/1/1 and 4/1/4/1, but both seemed really underwhelming.    His mid presence just seems low now, I feel like his torrent feels easier to juke for some reason.  I don't know.  I used to win with him a lot but it just didn't feel right last night.    He doesn't have the damage to justify safelane carry.  His tankiness/escape make offlane seem like a bad idea unless you have a strong support for a duo lane (maybe undying?), and his mid presence just felt bad to me.  Particularly against all the really strong ranged heroes this meta like QoP, SF, WR, etc.    I don't know.  Maybe I'm doing something wrong.  But he felt spectacularly weak."
TrueDoTA2,37px1g,Drop_,1 point,Fri May 29 15:57:48 2015 UTC,"You're absolutely right.  With the meta change, Kunkka's role has to change as well.  What I'm advocating is a shift from a damage-one-shot-kill build to a set-up-my-team-to-win oriented skill/item build.  I like him in the offlane because he can push slightly with Tidebringer harass and if he goes with a strong support you can just farm heroes.  I generally do not like dual melees in the kill lane, but Undying is definitely something to think about.  An X->Torrent combo with a Totem sounds like a devastating combo.  I think the issue is that many of us are playing solo queue so it's hard to completely depend on your team.  If you play any support though, you already are doing that anyway.  A possibility could be to put Kunkka in a trilane.  The issue with that is that he's generally greedy for levels so he would come online MUCH later, hence the duo offlane suggestion."
TrueDoTA2,37px1g,Drop_,2,Fri May 29 16:40:36 2015 UTC,"The problem I have with that is that fundamentally his boat and torrent are only guaranteed to hit 1 hero, and that's if you combo it with X and if you have good timing to hit it every time.   Compared to say Axe or Centaur - it's much easier to hit 2-3 hero stomps / calls with just Blink Dagger, while Kunkka doesn't get that much value.     I dunno, it just felt really lackluster to me as that role."
TrueDoTA2,37px1g,cantadmittoposting,3,Fri May 29 16:47:08 2015 UTC,"There's a slight difference in roles for Axe/Centaur and Kunkka in my opinion.  Axe and Centaur are what I would consider primary initiators.  If Kunkka is your only initiator, then I think your team is outdrafted already.  I don't believe Kunkka should ever be a ""first in"" kind of hero.  Axe and Centaur fill this role beautifully.  Kunkka's boat can be used to deny an area where the teamfight is breaking out.  The enemy will have a choice to either disperse or eat the boat.  Either way you've successfully destroyed their positioning.  Do I think Kunkka is a Tier-1 pick?  Absolutely not.  Do I think he can fulfill the role of a primary initiator?  No way!  But does he have a place in the meta beyond a niche pick?  I would say yes."
TrueDoTA2,37px1g,punriffer5,1 point,Fri May 29 17:18:52 2015 UTC,"But then who can you play him with?  I mean, if he's not a great mid (I don't think you're claiming he is), that means offlane is probably best, which means heroes like Axe or Cent can't really offlane with him.  Leaves him to basically being an Enigma who is offlane rather than in the jungle, to complement something like jungle axe or Magnus."
TrueDoTA2,37px1g,Furryk,1 point,Fri May 29 22:53:28 2015 UTC,"I don't have a good answer for that.  In all the games I've played so far, I ran him in a dual offlane combo and just kept the aggression up.  In one game we had a Faceless and Earthshaker so there was some decent initiation there and in another game, I laned with a Tidehunter (UGH I HATE THAT GUY!).    I think having an Axe/Centuar AND Kunkka would just make for a very greedy lineup."
TrueDoTA2,37px1g,Drop_,0,Sat May 30 00:08:23 2015 UTC,"He's fundamentally only able to solo - combo 1 hero, yes, but with a combo initiation he can do so on multiples... dark seer, Magnus (especially with empower), axe, and (ironically) tide hunter come to mind as VERY powerful combos. (Other blink stunners are fine too... CW, Lion, Sand King, maybe nyx, but fuck nyx's cast animation and how narrow his stun line is tbh)     Also while I was writing this... if we're talking specifically about boats and initiation... what about an Atos? You can spam spells a bit more and get a bunch of hp to tank missed initiations, as well as quasi - guaranteeing 2 heroes hit with the initiation... (I think euls range would be too short for that purpose?)     There's always Refresher kunkka..."

On the other hand there's boat-> blink forward euls/x a second target for 2 gaurenteed hits    Or Shadow blade, walk to 700, cast and then insta-euls, they have .57 to get out. Or you hit them with a torrent. You will have overshot them by 300, but its a 425 radius  So the gaurenteed 2-hit combo vs 2 targets holding hands is shadow blade/whatever, at 700 range of taragets.   Cast boat at them, as soon as cast completes you euls the first guy and x the second. Half a second after you x, you cast torrent 2.5 euls,  .4 x cast time, .5 wait after x, 1.6 torrent delay    So Boat, shift-que euls, shift-que x, wait .5 seconds, cast torrent, wait 1.1, x-back. Torrent goes off, from 2.5 euls time to 4.03. Boat hits at 3.07. The issue is that the stuns overlap, losing a lot of the utility, just keeping the damage."

Getting the boat in as well you really need it to be at least level 3 (preferably 4), but you still gain huge advantages from the Coco's Rum buff even if the actual boat doesn't hit.  Remember that you can re-cast X to trigger it early (now you can, didn't used to be able to I don't think). That makes the torrent combo massively easy to land and even the boat combo if you don't get the timing completely right (if you cast boat too early for example)"

You follow this with cheap items, take advantage of your new pushing ability, and your ungodly amount of health in the early game.   So basically it goes something like 3-4 bracers, phase or str boots, and then auras. You fall off around 13 but still can provide things like AC, vlads, and drums."

X + Arrow is decently reliable and can be further followed up with torrent (as if it were even necessary).  There are some other niche uses of torrent like removing refraction stacks from TA that might give further incentive to picking Kunkka instead of a different AOE stun.  Boat is obviously really great.  I think he is underused.  I don't know what items to build on support Kunkka thought.  I feel like you need mana pool and armor mostly.  Atos seems pretty good.

You don't have to commit heroes to it completely, just start getting the creeps onto the high ground at all lanes so their towers slowly start to take damage.  Techies can defend one, maybe two lanes solidly depending on how farmed he is but is is too slow to effectively get all his mines continually down effectively enough to stop creep waves and a full out 5 man hero push on any lane."
TrueDoTA2,37ppay,Llama_7,6,Fri May 29 16:31:31 2015 UTC,"I play techies sometimes and do decently (we don't always win, but I typically have a decent KDA in scrubmatches)  If you've not played Techies before, here are some facts that will affect what they are capable of (demystifying them helps them psych you out less):   early-game mana is a huge problem. I typically do Soul Ring + Arcane Boots until I can get a Point Booster. There are other builds, but upping mana-regen is a factor, and early mine-laying is slower because it's rate-limited by both cooldown and available mana. Q-mines are timeless, so they stay around forEVER (until they blowup) but are limited to 20, globally. They can be stacked exactly on top of each other (the better Techies players I've seen do this since it optimizes the lethality of the kill zone -- if someone is laying them out in a spread, I typically think they're not a seasoned Techies player). Thus: mine stacks laid in the beginning of the game may not blow up until the late game. You probably wont' see Stun-mines until late game. Not worth it in early/mid except maybe in a teamfight Suicide attack denies you XP for Techies dying and reduces the downtime by 1/2. (so if I would normally be dead 30s I'll only be dead 15s). It costs mana to do this and has a substantial cooldown (~a minute, IIRC?). It also does a bunch of damage. If they rush at you and have mana available, run or stun them. Remote mines can be detonated even if Techies is dead.  (AND Techies still gets XP + gold from kills) Right click speed is wicked slow and low-damage. They're not terribly good at farming (though they make an excellent practice hero for LH timing because of this, my best so far is 50 LH by 12:20, I think). They also move slowly, by default.   Here are some strategies that I use, that I've adapted from watching others play (Purge, Assholes's guide, and a few others) and found successful:  Possible strats your opponent Techies may use against you   hero-killing landmine stacks at the tops of stairs. there is no visibility at that cusp if you're on the wrong level, day or night, with or without gem. Same with Rosh pit -- if you are playing Ursa or Troll vs. Techies, EXPECT TO FIND MINES IN THE PIT. hero-killing landmine stacks under either rune, especially around 10-20mins in (decent mana regen, remote mine access, and more roaming happening) -- I don't typically do early rune stacks since I can't quite build up a lethal stack in < 2 minutes that early. If they rush a blink dagger, expect to see blink in, landmine, suicide. I've gotten double kills with this mid-late-game pushing with remote mines -- dropping single remotes all down all three lanes for the sole purpose of wiping entire creep waves with one mine (with Aghs, pre-Rax creep waves all fall to a single remote) mine stacks in the jungle transition points (the parts of the jungle where you go from either lane to midlane). These are fun because people don't always pay attention when they're running through here since it's a transitional spot. OR they're kiting my teammates and are low on health and they just won't have time to look ahead and plan where they go. Sideshops are another good spot, since they're less frequented. Tag-team mining. If I'm tag-teaming with a Vengeful Spirit, Pudge, or (in a pinch) Storm Spirit, or if I can get a Force Staff, I'll lay my stack somewhere safe and force you into the stack to blow you up. Mining on the near-side of a Tower (either kind), to catch you at the moment you feel safe after having just downed a tower. The nearside of the tower (nearside for techies) is a great place to put a lethal stack of EITHER mine because (a) you can't drop sentry wards nearby, (b) your creeps are probably all dead, and your health is probably not max if you just pushed a tower. (c) the Tower keeps enemy creeps from accidentally blowing the mine stack pre-emptively (usually) Stun mines in the jungle, to stop you if you're kiting my people, so they can get you Q mines in your jungle camps, so they don't respawn Some Techies players (me, for example) will do a stack rush in one of the jungles. Like: Enter battle, buy TP + Soul Ring recipe + ~6 clarities and immediately TP to edge of a lane and start building a lethal stack somewhere. I can almost always get a kill before 5 minutes with this. Sometimes first blood.   Counter strategies for each of those  Golden rule: If you personally (or the creep wave) has not been to an area in a while, always assume there are mines there. I don't mean to psych you out, but it's the easiest way to know when you have to be extra cautious. Never assume that just because a mine-stack blew up somewhere that Techies won't build there on that exact spot again (or that they WILL build there again)   Avoid stairs where possible OR send a patsy ahead of you. Others have suggested Necro / Helm for the creeps (both would work). Illusions (Manta / Rune / Naga Siren) also work fine. If you haven't gone up or down a stairway recently (within the past 2 minutes) be sure you're at full health, if possible in case you encounter a stack-in-progress. Alternately, through a sentry ward at the top of the stairs somewhere and watch your creeps run by -- you should have enough LoS to see them.  Sending patsies in first can work if it's landmines (so the 10-15 minute mark). There might be remote mines, but this is less likely because I would rather place remotes elsewhere (they're costly early on and require observation...though don't assume I won't put remotes there.) Be super careful in the late midgame about going to Runes. They're less frequented and so more likely to have landmine (Q-mines) stacks there. Make sure your support puts obs wards in the jungle nearby to watch for Techies. It's not foolproof but is an easy counter-measure against early game Techies kills. (Techies can pull this off as early as level 2). Try not to stay too close to your lane-mate so if he gets one of you he doesn't get both. If you hear a blink pop, run like hell. This is perhaps one way that Techies really shines in the late mid-game. The main counter-strat is to get a Gem or Necro so that you have truesight and then just melee each individual mine. Even if I blow them up, it probably won't be enough to kill you. These take time to lay, since I have to move around the map and lay each one. It's a good investment of a Gem here to do a minesweep around 25-30mins, especially if the T2/T3 towers are all down on your side. If their Techies doesn't have Ags, you're less likely to see this. They're also less effective (but not ineffective) once you've taken one of Techies' rax (more of the creeps will survive the mine) I'm not sure what to suggest here that doesn't imply you should be super paranoid. Jungle mines will probably not be lethal stacks unless your health is low. Just be careful when roaming your jungle, especially if you're planning on farming. If you have true sight, do not AFK run through the jungle or I will probably get you. (ie. keep your camera on you and don't get distracted by watching fights elsewhere) Look at the hero lineup, and tell your team if Pudge/VS is missing, and watch Techies inventory for a Forcestaff.  Always lead with your creeps, illusions, etc. One mindhack that is fun to do as Techies is to identify places where players typically let their guard down, and one way to do that is to get them immediately after a threat is resolved (ie. tower is down, or their juking through the jungle or something). Not to say never let your guard down, but have a disposable lead that you can vet your path in these areas. Having someone with a Gem is useful here. The mines will be super obvious and easy to avoid. Honestly, if you're juking / kiting, just cross your fingers and hope Techies hasn't been through there recently. If you can follow a teammate, a creep, or have been through there VERY recently (< 1 minute) it's more likely to be safe. Jungle is a tricky place to be because it's less frequented and so is a riper territory for Techies. Just walk in with full health and blow it up. No gem needed. I'm not wasting more than one mine in your creep camps for this purpose, so this will most likely not kill you, unless I see you doing this a lot...then I might make an exception. Before the battle starts (and runes appear) go check your jungle really quick. Look in creep camps (they're safe places since creeps haven't spawned yet). Expect to hit one or two mines going in. If 2 minutes of gametime (post 0:00) have gone by and you've NOT done this, assume there is a lethal stack somewhere in the jungle."

Especially when it's only one or no ranged heroes, a Force Staff will easily deal with them.  There is one dumb sounding strategy that works against weaker Techies players, though. You can pretend there are no mines there at all, and get your most useless hero (usually 5 position at that point) to just walk into them. If the Techies is impatient and inexperienced, he'll det, and you can then push 4v5 up highground with no mines to deal with.

Generally, in mid to late game, the red mines become pretty much MIA because, typically, the techies will have scepter. At that point he will place a shit ton of green mines around the towers - this is when you need to take objectives. If you can get a ward on high ground, sentry and obs, and see where the mines are clustered (because they usually only mine 1 rax really well and the others get left behind), you can make a more informed decision. In my experience, the best thing to do is get bkb's and go for objectives. Hope this helps."

Alternatively, get an aegis on one hero and try to get the other heroes in ""over the wall"" somewhere else (to teamfight behind the minestack  while the aegis carrier stands on the mines)... blink and forcestaff (or lifestealer infest, clock hook, Centaur aghs ult) will accomplish this...since we're talking a 'game is won"" scenario that should force an unfavorable choice and a 4v4 (since techies strengths will be concentrated on your aegis holder).

TrueDoTA2,37rxnk,Jbergur,4,Fri May 29 22:13:34 2015 UTC,"Medallion (and Solar Crest, by extension) are very good on weaver. Not exactly a new build, but should definitely be built on occassion.  I do have a couple of issues with Guardian Greaves. First off, he needs to be able to actually use them. A big issue with weaver is that unless you go for a 1-4-1 stats build (my personal favourite) he's far too squishy. How do the guardian greaves help with him being disabled? An instant lift/hex into more stuns or just big burst will kill him before he has a chance to use greaves. Whereas with linkins, that cannot happen nearly as easily.  In addition, despite him coming ""online"" earlier than the linkens build, it's still pretty late. Compare the totally cost of Greaves, 5850, with a desolator, 3500. In addition, he can also do immense damage whereas with greaves, he can't.  Finally, why couldn't a better suited ""normal"" carrier just get greaves? Weaver gets the benefits. A viper/huskar/enigma etc. I think that's the main problem I have with this. Even if weaver wasn't a BAD carrier, he's still not particularly great, and there's so many better items out there.  So, I personally do not think it would work. -33 armor is arguably overkill, and you don't even need the greaves to get that. A bottle + aquila solve him mana problems really easily, as long as you aren't stupidly spamming his spells. I think you put in a lot of work and hey, maybe it could work, who knows."

I doubt you'd have the mana to use swarm, invis and ult, as well as cast mek before you get greaves, so I feel like that item isn't giving you bang for your buck early on enough. Chances are there will be better mek and/or arcanes carriers in your team than weaver.  I actually don't like first-item linkens on him, unless the enemy's lineup really demands it. I think there are other items for coming online sooner without going the greaves route. Crits or desolator, maybe?"

The addition of Lotus Orb is much more relevant to weaver for removing silences and manta and/or diffusal was already great for removing them. Unless you're against Riki+disruptor, BKB would be your other easier answer.  I think a Heart would be better for Weaver to complement Solar crest as you need to solve your Health Issues to complement your resistances. Skadi is fine too, but you ahve to choose between whether you need a BKB piercing slow on a hero that isn't easily kited, or an item that lets you regen to full health in the middle of shukuchi fights.

TrueDoTA2,37rxnk,pepe_le_shoe,1 point,Mon Jun 1 11:46:28 2015 UTC,"As a 1, you'll always want damage or bkb first.   As a 3,  I don't see how you can make this work.   Linken's is about avoiding stuns and weaving out of a fight to stay alive. Mekh/greaves are not going to be enough to let you play weaver like a tank, and if you get stunned (because you don't have linkens), then you can't time lapse or use greaves active.  The better answer to make him survivable (assuming you really refuse to build linkens) as a 1 is to either use slahser's way (1-4-1-3 + stats until level 16) and build diffusal into skadi, or go for a mixed skill build (1-4-1 early, then 2-3 levels of stats, then level geminate but not swarm) and get aquila, point booster, deso/diffusal, then finish skadi.  I actually like the mixed build the most, because I value geminate more than slahser does, and I'm a big fan of casual point boosters while you farm your first damage item on cores that will later build aghs or skadi. Weaver likes skadi too because he loves stats, and he hates being kited.This is assuming you aren't going to build bkb 1st/2nd item, and if that's the case, just go deso+bkb in whatever order the game dictates.  Generally though, weaver is not supposed to be your tank. My philosophy as weaver is 'be the railgun'. My job is to appear and instantly deal a bagillion damage in 1-2 attacks. If you want to stand there like a meatshield, trading hits with the enemy carry, don't pick weaver, pick tiny or anyone who builds satanic. If you start to go down the 'I'm scared to die' rabbit-hole, you end up wit a six-slotted weaver who never dies and never kills anyone.  If you win the early game, bkb  should be enough to sustain you until/unless the enemy can turn the game around, and you should just always be building damage unless you're losing."

You know that even if you get 5 kills somehow in early game you gonna get the lowest possible gold from every single one of those right? Because am cant solo kill (unless someone from the enemies is overextending and you have ulti), and when you dont get solo kills you get the really low amount of gold from them as compared to your underfarmed team. You'd better be farming or splitpushing rather than fighting with your team unless you have at least 1 good item (manta is ok but not enough, either basher or heart) Until then, you farm and you fight with your team only for defenses, you go push the lanes and care not to die, that's it.  Sny is bullshit for many reasons, just get manta.   And about vlads - if your team has died less than 20 times pre 20 min mark it means they are doing good and you can skip vlads for better items (heart/basher), but if you are pressured really hard and you have literally no place to farm, then its an ok item to get. In a normal game, its a waste. As an antimage in a normal game, this is how you can die: You get comboed by an aghs lina (pure dmg), you get initiated and hexed by a blink lion and then followed up and killed while still a sheep by their whole team, caught in a chrono etc. There isnt any case where that lifesteal is gonna help you survive and that you gonna die there for sure if you dont have the lifesteal - like the vanguard build (if anyone remembers it), the vlads is also not a new build and used to work insanely well but nowadays you just cant survive with those items thanks to the insanely overbuffed spells, you lifesteal for 30 they hit you for pure dmg for 950. If you play as a stack though, you can get vlads for sure, but in solo games its a waste in 90% of the time."

As i said, you lifesteal for very low amount (considering oyur items at that point are pt and bfury). You know how vanguard am got popular (and still is somewhere)? Someone did a math and actually showed that you get more regen from vanguard than from lifestealing creeps, and add on top of it the dmg block and bulk of health so they started buying it - i agree as of now vlads is much better + the components are nice but still, for regen is really awful.   i.e. In both cases of having vlads or vanguard you regen for the same amount, but in most cases those 2 items are a waste of 2k gold."
TrueDoTA2,37p19n,dirtyslarkpicker,4,Sat May 30 00:44:52 2015 UTC,"I don't think you can do any amount of math and find vanguard having similar hp regen to vlads, vanguard gives you only 360 hp regen in a minute, you clear two camps with vlads and you gain more hp than that. It was core last version and it is still core this version, every good AM player gets vlads nearly every game. It barely slows your farm as it allows you farm deeper and more aggressively, you can clear ancients and stacks without losing hp, you don't ever have to return to base after taking damage and you can manfight single heroes that try to contest your farm in lanes and get the hp back easily. If you are in a game where a 1-2 minute delay of manta is gamelosing then by all means skip it but in that type of game AM is a back pick anyway.  Beesa AM  http://www.dotabuff.com/players/170532209/matches?date=&hero=anti-mage&skill_bracket=&lobby_type=&game_mode=&region=&faction=&duration=&timezone=Australia%2FBrisbane  Black AM  http://www.dotabuff.com/players/21289303/matches?date=&hero=anti-mage&skill_bracket=&lobby_type=&game_mode=&region=&faction=&duration=&timezone=Australia%2FBrisbane  Notice both these guys always get vlads, only games they don't have it is where the sold it later for big items. It is simply too good of a qol item on AM to give up.  VG AM got popular because the item was way stronger in Dota 1,"
TrueDoTA2,37p19n,Clarty94,2,Sat May 30 02:41:30 2015 UTC,"you clear two camps with vlads and you gain more hp than that   Not really, you lifesteal 20-30 hp at most per hit (if targets have armor you may lifesteal for as low as 10) but here's the thing: you may waste 2k gold for vlads so you can maintain better hp while farming, or waste 2k gold for orb and get a faster manta so you can actually kill someone by ulting. Its actually slowing the manta, considering 5k gold is not farmed in 1-2 mins by anyone right now, not even am with vlads + you are still gankable and easily killable, i'd rather face an am with early vlads than am with manta.  Now, about the dotabuff links, i believe beesa is this guy:  http://www.dotabuff.com/players/43908335  Maybe that's his smurf that is 7k? Anyway, if that's him I've actually played against him and here's the thing: he's an insanely strong player, one of the best pubbers for sure, but this doesnt prove shit for the vlads, a good player can build bloodstone on am and still win just because he's much better than the others. My theory about his games is that he actually fights and kills very early as an antimage (plus most of his games are in a party), and if everybody tries to copy his builds let me assure most will fail just because they will have nearly the 0 of the sense he has, i.e. he gets vlads to fight early because he knows he can get kills that most am players will not.   If you dont believe me just try it - copy his builds and try it in your games, you'll see that you'll get nowhere near the kills he's getting nor the farm.   VG AM got popular because the item was way stronger in Dota 1   The item is the same, I play for ages and I remember only 2 ""nerfs"" to the vg, the lower of hp for 50 and the change of dmg block mechanics for ranged heroes, everything else was a buff."
TrueDoTA2,37p19n,dirtyslarkpicker,3,Sat May 30 04:32:29 2015 UTC,"It's Beesa's 7k smurf.  VG was good in Dota 1 due to a combination of 50 hp loss, ranged hero block being good and alternatives not existing. Now you can get drum/aquila/OP new wand in place of it when you want an item to tank up fast.  I have copied his AM builds, it boosted my AM winrate from just over 50% to 60% and I learnt a lot about the hero in the process. It is a far superior build I have to say and Beesa outlined the reasons for it in a teamliquid post:  http://www.liquiddota.com/forum/dota-2-strategy/454970-hero-anti-mage?page=12#226  I would say that there are certainly really legit players doing suboptimal builds and succeeding despite them- but Beesa in his posts and watching his replays has always struck me as a player who is very intelligent in his skill/item choices.  http://www.liquiddota.com/forum/dota-2-strategy/454970-hero-anti-mage?page=13#241  The idea is that it barely slows your manta because it gives you a big boost to farm speed and keeps you on the map longer. With AM anyway you don't really want to aim for fighting with manta, ideally you want to keep powerfarming to the next item afterwards. Some games you will be pressured and then you skip vlads but if you are freefarming always get it imo."
TrueDoTA2,37p19n,thundrfang,2,Sat May 30 05:52:40 2015 UTC,"VG is the same, 50 hp nerf was the only one and the range block change didnt affect am at ALL cos he's melee, drums existed since 6.70 (around the time i started playing actively), aquila was added around that period too, that was NOT the reason why vg was bought on am instead of vlads, vlads didnt give regen nor stats and am had lower dmg, then someone realized you can skip those to get manta so everyone who was good started playing him like that.  The guy has a point and he's right about it in general, but i have a point as well: You can go away without vlads in every single game of am that you have won (if you play him properly ofc), and in a game where you are losing hard, vlads will not help you at ALL, and i cant say the same for manta. With manta, you may have 35-40% chance to survive a gank in a losing game, which means you are dead unless very precise/lucky, but with vlads, you have literally 0 chance to survive.    if you are freefarming always get it imo.   if you are freefarming you dont need it, that's my point."
TrueDoTA2,37p19n,Sublixt,6,Sat May 30 07:30:30 2015 UTC,"I think you should still be farming and ratting with AM. He doesn't contribute to team fights as much as any other good carry could, so if you want a fighting carry, don't pick AM."
TrueDoTA2,37p19n,Lazarous86,3,Fri May 29 12:39:39 2015 UTC,Seriously though. If you are picking an AM to have effect in team fights before 23 minutes you you picked the wrong hero.
TrueDoTA2,37p19n,wildtarget13,6,Fri May 29 14:27:54 2015 UTC,I think a smart TP is always an option though. You need to farm and watch the map. If you can TP in and user ult effectively that can swing a fight. I would never want AM yo be there before the fight breaks out. That is a waste of his time. But to say he can't contribute before 23 minutes is just a farm centric tunnel visioned approach.
TrueDoTA2,37p19n,SupALupRT,1 point,Fri May 29 14:36:53 2015 UTC,"You pretty much just skip battlefury and find the same items: yasha into manta, BKB, Vlads. From there, just build whatever you needed. There aren't that many antimage items. It's Heart, Abyssal, or Butterfly. Few players go MKB, even versus evasion. It's kind of weird, but considering antimage has a really funny playstyle where you don't need to manfight PA.   If you fight early, you want to hit a point where you have manta+4-4-1-1 and like 2 levels in stats. Some AMs don't level mana break before 3+more levels of stats."
TrueDoTA2,37p19n,forkkind,2,Mon Jun 1 08:08:12 2015 UTC,battlefury to vlads or manta is still the way to go
TrueDoTA2,37p19n,ProfessorMonocle,1 point,Fri May 29 11:47:55 2015 UTC,Bfury and manta is still the best am build. Once it becomes 3am you can start fighting and you can start dictating the game flow until you have enough ehp to team fight.
TrueDoTA2,37p19n,Drop_,1 point,Fri May 29 18:13:53 2015 UTC,"What's so great about AM is that he can play whatever you need. He has the ability to split push, team fight, or flash farm.   I made a comment below to another one of your comments, but I'll post another one.   The burning skill build is 1-1-1-stats. Allows you to be tanky and participate in team fights.   Maybe get treads, Aquila, magic wand before getting battlefury so you can team fight. That skill build has a noticeable difference in fighting early on."

TrueDoTA2,37p19n,BlackCommandoXI,1 point,Sun May 31 02:25:52 2015 UTC,I've never seen an Antimage do well with anything but the standard Battlefury build. I think he is one of those heroes that has only one build that works that is just way better than anything comparable.  It's sad because in theory it would be exciting to see alternatives but that's just the way it is.
TrueDoTA2,37p19n,Thalnagath,5,Fri May 29 11:05:37 2015 UTC,"An old build for Antimage was vanguard vlads. It worked alright with 4-1-4 build. Combined with another ganker or just a slow you could use the mobility to run people down. You were quite tanky and could easily dive towers and take a disable or two before blinking away. Keeping in mind that at the time vanguard was stronger than it is now, both directly and relatively (though we now have crimson guard). So I dont know how it will work now. Perhaps you could run an offlane plus one against magic burst supports. No idea how it would play out though."

TrueDoTA2,37nghs,kamarovscommentary,8,Thu May 28 22:46:10 2015 UTC,Id like to see this with a dusa or a timber as well. I am not sure about storm because you still need to be within range for that to work and he generally won't have mana problems mid/late game when he has a bloodstone or orchid online.
TrueDoTA2,37nghs,larharth,5,Thu May 28 23:33:30 2015 UTC,For storm I was referring to those really long range jumps that do a bunch of damage that drain your entire mana pool. Weaver just needs to be near where he lands to cast his ult on storm.
TrueDoTA2,37nghs,Thud_Gunderson,8,Thu May 28 23:39:43 2015 UTC,Does the agh upgrade not also revert their position? If it does then it's pretty useless for storm. If not then sure yeah sounds good
TrueDoTA2,37nghs,deeleelee,4,Thu May 28 23:53:21 2015 UTC,but then you do two long distance jumps!
TrueDoTA2,37nghs,Too_Much_Overtime,3,Fri May 29 06:26:10 2015 UTC,"you're right, it does. This wouldn't work for long distance jumps, it would just slap storm right back to where he was."
TrueDoTA2,37nghs,FreshExpress,1 point,Fri May 29 03:03:20 2015 UTC,Weaver just needs to count 4-5 seconds after Storm's arrival.  Storm just needs to survive for 4-5 seconds depending on weaver's accuracy.  If SS plays it right where his arrival and 4-5 seconds of nukage brings him to around 0 mana then weaver's ult on him could at that point have been used to pretty much max potential with that combo.
TrueDoTA2,37nghs,Too_Much_Overtime,3,Fri May 29 08:44:37 2015 UTC,"....which would be right where he started, on the other side of the map."
TrueDoTA2,37nghs,FreshExpress,-1,Fri May 29 09:33:38 2015 UTC,"If SS plays it right where his arrival still gives him 4-5 seconds of mana left for nukage, then weaver's ult (4 second reversal?) will put him back at his arrival with 4-5 seconds of nukage left.  This is kind of a min-max scenario and is not very practical in the heat of a battle, and very risky unless the team has 7-10 seconds of lockdown..."
TrueDoTA2,37nghs,kspacey,2,Fri May 29 09:56:00 2015 UTC,He'd still have almost no mana left when he arrived which is not a good situation for storm spirit to be in ever.

TrueDoTA2,37nghs,TommyVeliky,1 point,Sat May 30 23:48:21 2015 UTC,"if you have that many blood stacks as storm you won the game anyway, doesn't really count as a viable way to utilize Weaver aghanim's as a pick."
TrueDoTA2,37nghs,freelance_fox,8,Wed Jun 3 04:52:10 2015 UTC,"The most obvious one to me is the Skywrath Mage you mentioned, and invariably since Weaver and Skywrath would both want aghs here Alchemist. Another hero that can empty their manapool: pseudo support/int carries like refresher Lina or Shadow Shaman during the late game. Most of the other obvious heroes (Medusa, Timbersaw, Storm Spirit, Leshrac) can't empty out their manapools in 5s, or in the case of Storm I guess you could divebomb in and just get a long-range Time Lapse home?"
TrueDoTA2,37nghs,CategoriesAndSheaves,3,Fri May 29 02:33:58 2015 UTC,"tbh I'm surprised we haven't seen more aghs weaver.  In some FaceIt games, HR.Dread was playing (iirc) offlane weaver and going solar crest -> aghs/deso.  I saw him pull off some pretty neat aghs saves on a tiny, but he seems to have lost most of the games he ran this build.  If you have anyone who can blink in and burst down an enemy support within 4s, (but then doesn't want to stick around) this could be really good.  The health/mana change + the Kunkka X's effect on a 20s cooldown could do a lot.  But you still end up having to build a 'utility' weaver, and I'm not sure how you would end up playing that.  I feel like the early stat items + diffusal from the Slahser's way weaver build is a good place to start.  Going medallion/crest -> aghs on top of that seems like it could work, but at the end of the day, is this better than something like a support kunkka?  Could be really cool.  Guess I have to try this in some pubs now."

Any item build that requires him to commit and go in for kills, e.g. normal damage builds like Deso or defensive builds like BKB/Linkens that allow him to tank. Solar Crest, Maelstrom, Aghanims, and perhaps Lotus Orb are the items I'm thinking of. Maybe a late-game Manta or Hex."

You don't need to have a Storm or whatever, saving any carry or even a support with a 20s cooldown is never a bad thing, the real drawback here is the fact that you have to click on Weaver if you want to timelapse yourself instead of simply pressing R like you'd do without Aghs so this might hurt your survivability."

TrueDoTA2,37ms0p,marlybarrow,19,Thu May 28 19:46:16 2015 UTC,"First, stop getting midas. It is not good anymore on furion. You want to be ganking, not afk farming. It just delays your efficacy in ganks.  he has a very flexible item build. For jungle furion, I like basi+clarities to start. Disassemble basi and turn it into a medallion when you can. It does so much for furion. You can kill jungle creeps faster, get an early rosh, take away enemy's armor, give ally armor, or give armor to the creep/treant that is tanking the tower to extend ur pushes. Other early items are viable too but medallion is my favorite lately. Boots of choice (either phase or treads but I prefer treads). Teleport scrolls are core for furion. I know you have a tp spell but scrolls are actually MORE effective on furion than any other hero because you can really abuse your map presence. Teleport behind enemy lines to get the courier or a red-lined retreating hero then scroll out before the other team can react. Very strong. STOP GETTING MIDAS.  Extension is incredibly flexible. You can go full push and get things like blink OR Shadow Blade and necro and vlads (actually decent on furion now after the buff). You can go full gank and get dagon. You can go a right click build that can both fight and push by getting a deso or mjolnir. JUST STOP GETTING MIDAS.  You want to keep an eye out for ganks as soon as you get teleport. That means at level 2 you should have ur eye on the lanes looking for opportunities to kill. You have the best ganking spell in the game. Abuse it. STOP GETTING MIDAS.  For positioning, well that is just something that you learn with experience. That being said furion is the hero with some of the best positioning because of his teleport. When going for ganks you can teleport into the treeline then break them by summoning treants to surprise the guy you're ganking. Just keep playing really and you'll learn the best time and position to teleport to. Not much else to say here besides just practice. STOP GETTING MIDAS.  In conclusion: STOP. GETTING. MIDAS."

TrueDoTA2,37ms0p,CitizenKeane,1 point,Fri May 29 00:36:03 2015 UTC,You can absolutely aim to split push in the mid and late game and its still very effective. But in 6.84 fights happen so early and often that it would be a waste not to take advantage of one of the best ganking skills at least in the early game. That's why I don't like midas in this meta. Ideal midas timing overlaps with the timing where you should be contributing to early skirmishes. No other hero has more map presence in the early game.
TrueDoTA2,37ms0p,kroxldyphivian,1 point,Fri May 29 01:00:20 2015 UTC,"I have to disagree with you here. Midas is definitely not a must have every game but it is far from a bad item. I find myself getting it about 1/3 of the games that I play JUNGLE Furion, on offlane natures prophet I just go treads first almost always with the occasional phase boots. My reasoning is simple, there are 2 ways to win the laning phase, getting gold and exp from your lane or constantly killing your opponent. In my opinion what makes jungle furion viable is that he can manage both. If the lanes go evenly, even with you in the jungle (which in lower mmrs it should), then you just won your team the laning phase, one person is getting solo exp and gold, and even you are earning more than their support who is in a trilane or one of the dual lanes. If you see that you won't be killing any time soon, midas will help you win the laning phase harder as you come out higher levelled than you would've with treads or another item. Even when rushing midas furion is far from useless in ganks. Considering your basi into what i assume treads build, you get about +14dmg, 50ms, and +30attackspeed. Midas gives you +30 attackspeed and about 1 1/2 level advantage (translating to 4-ish damage and bonus hp, plus negligible agility, we're not even counting the benefits in ganking of having an extra treant to bodyblock with, ult ready earlier, lower tp cd, or longer sprout), movespeed isn't that important because a well placed teleport will get you where you need to be in a gank anyways. Midas is also useful when paired up with farm hungry heroes, they usually take most of the creeps, so you need the most value out of the creeps you do get with transmute (it kinda helps).   Furion DEPENDS on being better farmed than his opponents. I can't count the number of times I've been forced to carry my team because our carry couldn't, being able to manfight with their carry simply because I was six slotted at 35 minutes or less (with constant Ult spam, which I only recommend you do if you can't count on your team AT ALL, midas, and not dying at all, which isn't too hard). His global tp allows him to get farm that no one else can, and can avoid ganks by just continuing to farm somewhere else. Midas helps in expediting this even more."
TrueDoTA2,37ms0p,ZoggZ,5,Tue Jun 2 08:05:50 2015 UTC,That is dedication to a hero you suck at.  I commend you.
TrueDoTA2,37ms0p,Drop_,3,Thu May 28 20:10:51 2015 UTC,"Here's a few common mistakes that I see on NP and we'll see if you can relate to any of these.   Don't do the same build every game. NP is super flexible in his item builds. Diagnose the game and determine if you want a man-fighting build, a split-push build, a burst damage build, a silence/hex/disable build. AFK Farm for the first ten minutes. NP can active on the map from about level 4 onward (2 points in Treants, 1 in Teleport and 1 in Sprout). Sometimes a well-timed sprout and a few right clicks can secure first blood. You can also snipe couriers, place deep wards, etc. Simply AFK farming is a losing strategy. You are forcing your team to fight 4v5 and you'll be trying to fight from a disadvantage. Stop feeding. This one is a bit personal for me. I get overconfident and I don't respect my teams killing power. If you're split-pushing or man-fighting, you need to not die. Going 4 null talismans + blademail means you should understand when you can man-fight and when you can't. Split-push witha good exit strategy or know they can't contest you. Suiciding for tower kills, courier snipes, killing a fleeing hero are a bad idea everytime. If you do want to do some near-suicidal shit, at least carry a TP scroll. I buy them every game now. Don't spam your ultimate every time it's off cooldown. Use it wisely. NP is not the position 1 carry so don't steal farm. Don't push lanes unnecessary. It's fine to use it to boost your gold gain, but just be smart with it. Having it ready in a teamfight can be really helpful."
TrueDoTA2,37ms0p,CNHphoto,2,Fri May 29 05:58:05 2015 UTC,"I don't know your play style, but you should concentrate on split pushing and showing up at ganks.  Create space on the map without feeding. Get used to knowing when to TP out - this is hard and really only comes with practice. I am not great at it, but SB/blink helps for when you screw up.  Deso I think is good to lower armor on towers to help the push, as is a necro."

TrueDoTA2,37ms0p,ubermeatwad,1 point,Fri May 29 03:58:00 2015 UTC,Slahser's Way for Furion is excellent. You have a Nature's Prophet who contributes early rather than just PVE AFK in the jungle for the first 20 minutes.
TrueDoTA2,37ms0p,icheyne,1 point,Fri May 29 13:38:16 2015 UTC,"I've been having a lot of success with this jungle furion build:  Max treants, get 1 level in sprout and tp, get ult when you can, then max tp, 1 more level in sprout, then stats if you don't feel like sprout is that effective that game.  I start with gloves of haste and clarities, so you can either go treads or midas depending on the laning situation. I get either midas or treads in the jungle, depending on whether  or not you feel like you can get away with midas, if you're winning the laning phase/being aggresive, treads, if you're even/losing, just get midas and go for mid lategame redemption.   Afterwards, shadowblade, BUT you need to very familiar with how to scout using treants, dust will screw  over so you have to sb out before they get in range of you (it helps in damage output/ganking, pseudo escape, scouting tool). I then like going necro/deso. Necro if they have no way to deal with the creeps (no cleave, splitshot, to easily just erase them, or if they do you're confident that you can work around them;this is what usually happens with me). Maelstrom is also viable if you need to delay the game by keeping waves pushed out to dodge fights, though this is really only a desperation item now in my opinion. I then like getting AC OR necro/deso. AC if they have lots of physical damage, Necro 3/deso if you can afford to focus on just pushing. Then just buy whichever item you haven't yet. This is a critical point for furion in my opinion. If you manage to keep the lanes pushed, they will NEVER be able to fight a good 5v5, much less touch your base, unless your teammates suicide to them or something stupid. With these items you melt towers ridiculously quickly, and a 30 second fight will cost their team a t3 and a melee racks (if they keep sending someone back, destroy the ranged racks as they don't heal and you can pick up where you left off in another fight). I tend to like saving for buybacks at this point, BKBs/hex would be next. If they send someone back, you can hex them, wail on their towers for an extra 3.5 seconds. Bkb has the same concept, except it forces them to send a physical dpser and not a support with a stun to slow you down as you can ignore them for a good 10 seconds otherwise. At this point your enemy should be on the verge of tears, they can't seem to escape the rat. As their towers get wailed on by your megacreeps, you tip your fedora at them and type in all chat, ""you may have won every battle, but you still lost the war."" #objectivegaming.  Seriously though, if at this point you still haven't won, you can consider getting an mkb as it improves your DPS vs buildings OR get a refresher if you can micro a courier in the treeline. Tp to their trees, spawn treants, necro, ult their creeps, refresher, spawn more trees, use necro again when appropriate, and have them watch as their towers melt even with backdoor protection on, and see their towers vanish underneath the onslaught of your rat army."
TrueDoTA2,37ms0p,ZoggZ,-9,Tue Jun 2 08:25:55 2015 UTC,"I'll tell you why. You're picking an intelligence hero with absolutely no attack steroids whatsoever and attempting to be a carry. Then, the other team's real carry destroys you.  Lose the Silver Edge + Desolator stuff, it's dumb. Any real carry with the same items does much better than prophet ever will.   I assume you're fairly low rated, judging by the items/heroes in your games, so learn the null talisman jungle start into dagon rush, and try and keep an eye on the map. Teleport into ganks, sprout, few attacks and a dagon blast will make so easy kills. One thing people cannot do at a low rating is consider anything outside of their screen, so they go for stupid kill attempts that a dagon prophet can turn right around. Of course, that requires you to look outside your screen too.  Any further advice is going to go over your head until you change how you approach the hero.  On a completely unrelated note, I'm on an 8 game win streak wherein every single game has been double-digit kills. I'm scared to play again.

Poor man's shield will take you farther in those early engagements, for pretty much the same price as that wraith band. I still think Basi ring is a good pick up, just that what you get from the wraithband in sub par to what you could get somewhere else.  If you are having so much trouble in lane you want to build an Aquila, just build a PMS instead. If you're doing well you can skip the Aquila and go for something more helpful, like Drums, finished treads, or starting towards your aghs / blink."

TrueDoTA2,37mly5,Drop_,5,Fri May 29 08:24:17 2015 UTC,"Have fun running at breakneck speeds towards you opponents with that Aquila.  Tiny is unique in the fact that in the mid game he can essentially ""1 shot"" people on a 12 second cool down given he has enough mana. And no this doesn't mean I want to wait around waiting to regen mana after finishing someone and waiting to dive his ally because my Aquila needs to give me my mana.  2 attacks is what tiny gets off. The AS and damage don't matter at all when you have a combo that is doing 800+ in magic damage.  You aren't killing people by chasing them down and autoing. You are killing them by spending 240 mana in burst and fucking them up. There is a reason people will get phase on him now. 24 damage is ass, +% speed is everything when it comes to being in melee range.   Tiny, even if played as a carry, will always want to take advantage of his mid game damage once his tower is down.  Not to be offensive, but you really need to let go of this. Tons of people have come in telling you why it's a big waste of money. This seems like a really 2k gaming idea that you are trying to defend. I can see how a basilius might be nice if you are just going to farm safe lane for 15 minutes.. But that's not how you play the hero"

TrueDoTA2,37mly5,PeenoyDoto,5,Fri May 29 11:45:51 2015 UTC,"Poor armor and poor attack speed aren't the only problems with Tiny. He needs so many items to stay viable from the mid game to the late game, if he is expected to carry his team. As such, he often needs to rush his core items; aghs or dagger, to approach the mid game so that he doesn't fall behind later. Aghs allows you to farm much better, dagger allows you to always have the option to pick off lone targets at 1k health.   What has this got to do with your point about aquila, you ask?  1) he needs to be efficient with his gold and slot spending.  2) the bonuses aquila provides can be provided from other early game items. They are treads (with switching), wand, bottle.  2b) since you made quite a bit of comparison of aquila to drums, imo you don't want to get drums either. It is less gold efficient now, you don't want to manfight, you get hp and mana from the aghs you are already intend to get,plus aghs let's you farm while drums doesn't, and getting drums sets you back.  3) in the mid game, you want to perform your avalanche toss combo, but you don't want to man fight in a teamfight. While stats from aquila / drums allows you to have more hp/mana/minor attack speed to manfight, you aren't playing tiny right if you intend to manfight. Just do your combo, snipe someone and get out, waiting for spells to cooldown  Besides, aquila will never be that item that you are glad you got because it saved you in a clutch moment. In the early-mid game, bottle wand and tread switching will do that for you. The small stats may look good in theory but you will struggle to make those stats count or justify itself when you actually are in game.   P. S. Give some credit to the replies you are getting, instead of ruling them out because they don't agree with you."

TrueDoTA2,37mly5,punriffer5,1 point,Fri May 29 08:42:34 2015 UTC,"1) if he is not allowed to free farm, then any other choice of item is worse. Doh. You seem to be missing the point of ""core item"".   2) if you are really concerned with damage mitigation get a stout shield, pms if you must, or add that 1 value point in craggy exterior if you must. Besides, there literally is no item build for any hero, much less tiny, that getting armor would let him carry the game.   3) no, he really can't manfight early. Don't be deceived by his high attack damage, none of his skills allow you to actually utilize it, and that is also why he is so item dependent, because items let him utilize his attack damage,see?   Look at ursa, pa, naix, slark. They all have a skill or two that rewards you for being able to stick onto your target and manfight. Or rather, they literally can't do much if they can't manfight; and that is also why you can build stats on them with drums and aquila and have success. Tiny on the other hand, has the uniqueness of having a nuke combo that is deadly to the point of one shot, and if that doesn't net you the game, you can still fall back on the siege attack type of aghs to slow siege/split push, and also the raw attack damage to manfight given that you have enough items to overcome your shortfalls of armor, attack speed, like you repeatedly mention. This should be your mentality when you play tiny, instead of building him to manfight.   4) when you mention ""does not stand out"", I hope you realize that you yourself have already admitted that aquila over basi gives pitiful bonuses. Extra dps from the +3 str? 22 % less physical damage? Get real that's just 1 or 2 armor worth. Stout shield master race. Cheap price of 1010 gold? You do realize that's 25 cs worth of gold?   Maybe one day you will realize how bad aquila is, if you do try building it in some games on your tiny. And if that day comes many months from now, may you look back on your posts and replies and cringe in disgust."
TrueDoTA2,37mly5,CNHphoto,2,Fri May 29 16:49:34 2015 UTC,"A lot of the time when I'm going to lane as a tiny, be it mid or in safe lane, I'll pick up a stout shield for survivability, and I upgrade it to a PMS.  PMS provides 6 agi (instead of 9 + dmg) and easily builds up very quickly. In the same vein of thinking as OP, the agi helps tiny's terrible early attack speed, and helps to keep him up in lane (despite low armor).  I do like this Aquila idea though, and I haven't toyed with it much. The mana regen seems like the key aspect that really makes the difference- I'll definitely try it out today."
TrueDoTA2,37mly5,dxroland,2,Thu May 28 19:52:14 2015 UTC,"I think basi is probably better as it's more efficient on him.  And I think vlads is probably legit on tiny - he gets so much damage out of the aura due to his insane base damage.   I don't think aquilia really provides enough for him.  Agi is arguably the worst stat for non-agi heroes.  Armor is cheaper on armor items.  AS is WAY cheaper on AS items.  Spending that extra 500 gold on Wraith obviously isn't going to make or break you, but for what you get out of it (6 damage, 9 attack speed and a trivial amount of hp/mana) it just doesn't seem like the value is there to me.

Aquila solves both problems with an unbeatable cost benefit that no other item below 3k can do it . Getting any other more expensive item delays aghanim too much and aghanim itself does not solve both problems ."

I see the argument, but I just don't know if I agree with delaying treads or point booster on tiny for an aquila.  I mean, for mid I think bottle and/or wand + treads into scepter or blink is a better idea personally.  For lane I feel like just wand + treads works.  I dunno about replacing the wand with an aquila.  I see the argument but I don't think the value proposition is there."

TrueDoTA2,37kvat,Hans93,29,Thu May 28 11:03:08 2015 UTC,"Having played this matchup at least 50 times with various opponents, I'd say this matchup is slightly QoP favoured, mostly because her play is easier.   QoP has slightly better stats (except for BAT), however she has 50 less range and significantly worse attack animation (attack point), with slightly higher missile speed.   This 50 extra range and slightly better animation have to be utilized by WR in order to get off more hits + get better CS.  QoP has a superiour harassing spell in Shadow Strike and WR has to play perfectly around it. Its range is the glaring weakness that allows baiting QoP into taking extra hits. Utilize fog and dance just outside of her range. If QoP blinks aggressively, you can punish her heavily with Windrun and win that trade. However getting hit by multiple Shadow Strikes will mean that QoP wins the sustain war.  QoP has supreme rune control, nevertheless Windranger has less risky waveclear and she also can max it straight, while QoP should  have at least 2 ranks in SS by 5.   QoP also a lot stronger power spike at level 6 and WR has to respect that or set up a bait play with Magic Stick and Windrun.   To sum it up, WR should abuse her extra range, better autoattack animation and BAT and outplay potential of Windrun (potentially also Shackle). She can also focus on stronger lane control and force QoP to choose between getting XP or rune. Master Powershot, play the bait, know ranges and respect Sonic Wave.  QoP should mercilessly abuse every positioning mistake by WR and break her laning flow by always threatening to Shadow Strike and also by playing the creeps correctly. Use breathing room created by harassing to either push the wave and get a rune or to keep the wave back and zone even harder (you go for this when you are ahead in the sustain war). Set up an ulti kill before reaching 6 (harass WR a bit, calculate neded mana and dmg). Abuse runes. Switch up your rhythm in lane to avoid easy powershots, force WR to choose between hitting you and creeps.  Therefore, WR has to use Powershot very well and a lot of this matchup depends on that. She should almost always cast it from fog and watch QoP's lasthitting pattern closely.   The matchup is overall very nuanced and there are no ways to really brute force it (maxing Shadow Strike as QoP gives WR quite simply counterplay - win by having superiour wave manipulation and deny QoP all the runes or XP/farm).   Gotta go for now, but I will expand on builds + few more details later if there is enough interest.  Edit: On the builds. I assume both heroes start null + tangoes + (branches). You should get pooled 2 tangoes, if not, you gotta buy them.  Alternatively you can try different combination like branches + tangoes only for bottle rush, blades of attack + tangoes (on WR) or even some experimental builds with Ring of Protection, however in this matchup most of those builds are risky. Buying or getting pooled 1 ward can make the lane very easy to win for both heroes, makes dodging/hitting powershots quite simple. It's quite big investment though (not in gold, but using one of two early game wards).  QoP is 100% rushing Bottle and WR should too in majority of cases. Alternative build for WR is faster PPhases or boots + extra Null or basi, but Bottle is almost always better. Stick is somewhat relevant in this matchup, but not necessary for either side. It can surprise QoP and screw her combo, it's less useful for QoP herself because if the WR is any good, she should be casting Powershots from fog anyway.  Both heroes should bottlecrow if able (WR will naturally crow more because QoP will usually get more runes).   Even after Bottle, WR can get Basi to be able to control the lane more and pressure tower if/when QoP is roaming. Mango can be bought by QoP for surprise extra Scream or to get combo mana at 6/7.  QoP should 2-1-2 as mentioned, 2-1-4-1 by lvl 8 and then max blink - that is the standard build. Alternatively you can max SS, however you need to gain solid advantage and/or few kills for that not to hurt you later (maxed scream and blink are both needed after laning is over). It is important to note that rank 4 Shadow Strike decimates heroes who are caught far from tower and enables you to kite people a lot.  WR can delay Shackle for extra levels in Windrun, however the payoff is not huge (extra 1 or 2 seconds matter and extra slow can definitely matter, but meh). Maxing Shackle is generally better, just gotta be able to hit creep -> hero Shackles consistently. You can delay taking Focus Fire for a bit (because you need higher level Shackle for it to be good against QoP anyway), but it can be okay for pressuring the tower early."

Yeah, Wind Ranger can manipulate the wave better if Qop only has a level 1 Scream, Qop, after the recent blink buffs, will almost always get the rune from a Windranger if she decides too. The blink range is just too much and even if WR wastes almost the double amount of mana required, to use Wind run to get to the rune easier, she can't cover the same ground with Qop in a single blink, she has wasted her escape mechanism (which qop will have also done but oh well) and she just got screwed royally mana wise, since qop used less mana AND has a bigger mana pool than her."
TrueDoTA2,37kvat,L3vathiaN-,4,Thu May 28 12:00:40 2015 UTC,"I meant to deny her runes by pushing the lane, not going for the rune yourself. I wouldn't try to race QoP to rune with Windrun.  The blink buff definitely skewed this matchup more towards QoP, but it still is manageable as WR, I feel it's around 60/40 or maybe 58/42. I"
TrueDoTA2,37kvat,DarkFazy,3,Thu May 28 13:39:26 2015 UTC,"Thanks, really good advice from both sides."
TrueDoTA2,37kvat,L3vathiaN-,4,Thu May 28 12:03:57 2015 UTC,"Qop has pretty big maneuverability, so she should be able to avoid most of the powershots, if not all the non fogged ones. On top of that, what can actually make the lane for Wind Ranger is a well placed shackle of skill level at least 2.   Qop can absolutely dominate the lane if she literally maxes her Q. The only heros that can go 1on1 with a maxed Shadow strike Qop are the ones with self regenerating abilities and Wind Ranger sucks at that. This comes with a cost though, considering your scream will be kept at low skill levels till you're level 10 and your blink will only be level 1. You have to decide what you want to do, completely destroy the wind ranger or be able to get off evenish in lane and become a ganking powerhouse by level 7."
TrueDoTA2,37kvat,AngelDarkened,8,Thu May 28 11:19:30 2015 UTC,"Qop has pretty big maneuverability, so she should be able to avoid most of the powershots   Care to explain? QoP has low MS, no particularly great turnrate and Blink has a 0.33 cast point. What's her edge over other heroes against Powershot?"
TrueDoTA2,37kvat,L3vathiaN-,0,Thu May 28 11:42:26 2015 UTC,"I said maneuverability, not mobility. Qop has 550 attack range, which in mid allows her to almost always be up on her side of the cliff and farm the waves, which means she will almost always have vision of Wind ranger. You really don't need to Blink to avoid Powershots. And in the rare cases you can't avoid a powershot, you can always hide behind your creeps to receive less damage. An option that Wind Ranger clearly does not have, since QOP's nuke deals the same damage, maximum, to all targets hit by it.  The 550 range thing and her positioning are the main reasons she can predict and evade Powershots.  On top of that, a base movespeed of 295 is not ""low"", it's 5 below what's considered average."
TrueDoTA2,37kvat,AngelDarkened,5,Thu May 28 11:50:24 2015 UTC,"Qop has 550 attack range, which in mid allows her to almost always be up on her side of the cliff and farm the waves   Why? I can't make sense of that. Creeps don't always meet right in the middle. Just because a hero has decent range doesn't mean he/she can always have uphill vision - especially considering that oftentimes you want to stand close to the creeps to give you an edge on lasthitting.   WR should not get hit by Scream of Pain unless QoP blinks forward, putting herself in a more vulnerable position (including creep aggro or even tower) unless she is able to near-instantly kill WR (which means WR heavily overextended).  I don't see QoP having better positioning than other ranged mid heroes, especially considering her low range on SS and SoP.  Agreed, her movespeed is not CM/Viper low, but it's definitely ""not good"".  I'm trying to figure out the ""credibility"" of your claims, in case I can learn a thing or two. ;)"

On topic: The 550 range is much better, compared to other heros, eg. TA/Shadow Fiend/Storm Spirit/Razor/Tinker/OD/Lone Druid who all have (much) less and is on par with heros like Puck(same range) and Viper(viper has 25 more, 575)for your positioning while being able to last hit.  And all that without factoring in the melee heros of course, like Magnus or Ember.  Your point about being near creeps to take advantage of the projectile timings, Wind Ranger will do that too. That's when you get your chance to spam your spells.   To put a big TL;DR on this, the lane is much in favour of Qop, but WR is no pushover. Also, most common mids face bigger problems vs WR than QOP."

And yes, both have the potential to capitilize on an overextension and snowball to oblivion from there. Especially when it comes top Qop, things shackle (and other long disables like that, eg. Max Strength Morphling Adaptive Strike) is pretty much the go to if you want to kill her early."

Windranger is very easy to kill as long as you know when to commit your blink. Make sure you get runes to keep up your harass and itemize accordingly based on your situation.
TrueDoTA2,37kvat,IAmNotACreativeMan,1 point,Thu May 28 11:23:41 2015 UTC,"Whoever is better. There's that old famous video of EE vs Arteezy mid, where they do this matchup from both sides and Arteezy wins both as QOP and WR. Granted Arteezy is a bit better at mid position than EE, but I still think it's pretty much even as far as characters.  Here's a muted version of it  It's a bit dated, but I still think it's winnable from both sides dependent on skill. I think WR is more easily ganked in a real match though. I don't think either has a strong advantage. If I could find the one with the audio you'd see EE remarking at how Arteezy wins from both sides."
TrueDoTA2,37kvat,suitsareawesome,1 point,Thu May 28 22:40:37 2015 UTC,"I don't understand how you're getting hit by powershot.  It needs the full channel for max damage now, which is a full second.  Keep moving and never have the creep wave between the two of you.  Get a ward for the other side of the river or have a support do it if that helps keep her in sight.  Getting hit powershot when you can see the WR is like getting hooked by Pudge when you can see him... it just should not happen."
TrueDoTA2,37kvat,samnya745,2,Thu May 28 11:53:45 2015 UTC,"From what I remember from the patch notes, it still required a full second before. .2 second cast point and .8 seconds of channeling. They got rid of the cast point and just made it require the full 1 second of channeling instead."

TrueDoTA2,37kvat,samnya745,2,Thu May 28 18:43:16 2015 UTC,"Right, but it also had a .2 second cast point, so it was still a full second from beginning the cast to getting full damage. They got rid of the cast point but made it channel the full duration for max damage."

TrueDoTA2,37l6ne,OldManDankers,3,Thu May 28 12:56:35 2015 UTC,"Although /u/subraizada3 said everything, the raw formula for magic damage is:  Actual damage =  magical damage  × (1 − natural resistance)  × (1 − first resistance bonus) × (1 − second resistance bonus)  × (1 + first resistance reduction) × (1 + second resistance reduction)"
TrueDoTA2,37l6ne,SeeImSane,1 point,Thu May 28 14:40:43 2015 UTC,"Bonus magic damage is applied the same way as magic resist in the magic damage formula. If your hero has a base magic resist of 25%, they take 75% damage from magic. If the hero is ebladed, they take 140% magic damage. To calculate the total magic resist, you multiply the magic damage they take   0.75 * 1.4 = 1.05   They will take 105% magic damage, or 5% more than what is listed on the ability. An Anti-Mage has 25% base resist, so he takes 75% damage. Max Spell Shield gives him 50% resist, so he takes 50% damage from that. Eblade is 40% bonus, so that makes it 140%.   0.75 * 0.5 * 1.4 = 0.525   He has 52.5% magic resist when ebladed, so he takes 47.5% damage from magic (37.5% when not ebladed but with max Spell Shield).  Pure damage ignores magic resist and always does the exact damage listed unless the enemy/you have some overall damage amp/resist (Bloodseeker thing, Ursa Enrage, Bristleback Bristleback, Centaur Stampede, etc.). BKB still blocks some pure damage though (pure doesn't always mean BKB-piercing, pretty sure Pierces Spell Immunity also doesn't always mean the damage goes through BKB)."

It's great for tower pushing and defending, especially at the T3s, and also at the Rosh pit. The increased range on mana burn in particular means you can spam it on enemies 900 units away with that 4s cooldown, which makes it very expensive for certain enemies to stay within range of a burrowed Nyx. Meanwhile the 1050 range impale lets him counter-initiate like a beast if the other team tries to get the drop on you.  Basically the Aghs makes Nyx more useful in teamfights. Without one, you're basically limited to an initiation role: blink in and get the best impale you can, then skilldump on a squishy or key enemy, use carapace and cross your fingers to see if you survive. Aghs simply gives you another option if that approach isn't working out for whatever reason, which IMO is what all Aghs effects should do - open up more ways to play the hero."

At that point, I like to invite who ever was baby sitting the carry to take over mid if they are behind. I'll take over ward and babysitting duties and be ready to relocate the carry into easy ganks.   I can't stress enough how hard it is to utilize IO properly if your team doesn't speak the same language or doesn't understand how relocate/tether works. You should be zipping around the map making things happen but instead you'll end up stacking camps. If you say a friendly greeting during the loading phase and you don't get a response, just stick to buying a salve and trying to keep the safe lane alive."

TrueDoTA2,37hgaf,Slatheros,9,Wed May 27 17:40:46 2015 UTC,"I've written some posts on Necrophos in earlier patches on the sub and have tried him out a few times with the new items in 6.84. Frankly, I'm a little disappointed. I think the hero is actually fairly weak in 6.84. Or rather, weaker than he used to be (say, pre-6.83). He's still decent and I'd say a mid tier hero right now. Which is a bit sad for someone like me whose most played and highest winrate is on the hero.  I thought the new items would be great for Necro, and while they're decent for him, the meta shifts make it more difficult to play him. Or maybe I'm actually reaching a tier where people can punish Necro harder. I don't know how much each contributes to the difficulties I've had with the hero.  I play him in a very similar style: Null, Headdress, Wand, Tier 2 boots, Mek, then go push all the T1 towers with your team. I have reached very similar conclusions (about power curve on the hero, importance of staying ahead in terms of survivability, and lack of mobility/utility on the hero). I usually ran him mid, but that's becoming less and less viable for me as Necro is a fairly weak solo laner and gets wrecked by properly played mids like QoP, SF, TA, Lina, etc. I think he works best as part of a trilane or solo safelane against an offlaner with low early solo kill potential like a Tide or Timber.  Like you noted, Necro basically wins by playing from ahead throughout the entire game and becomes very fragile if he ever falls behind. With the prominence of midgame gankers and teamfighters in 6.84, I find it harder than before to gain and maintain that crucial survivability lead over the enemy team. One death in the early or midgame can set you behind a lot as Necro, and you may never fully recover. He's not particularly good at farming or comeback and his main strength (early/midgame 5v5 teamfighting) can become a liability if his laning stage goes awry. At which point he becomes relative deadweight on his team except for being a walking Scythe (which isn't weak of course, but it's really not what you want out of your 1 or 2 position).  I have a bunch of thoughts on itemizations and strategies with Necrophos and was typing them all up but I think in the end I'll just make some TL;DR statements.  As much as it pains me to say so, the safest ""general-purpose"" 6.84 build for Necro is likely to be the ""delete enemy heroes"" build with Blink+Agh's and other optional items like Midas, Dagon, Refresher. Probably an optional Midas into early Dagon 1 for that ""instant delete"" spike in the early midgame into Blink and Agh's buildup with an eye on a luxury Refresher or even Eth Blade.  Alternatively, a heavy push strat with early Greaves and tanking Necro can work as well, but your team has to commit to the push and to crippling the enemy team before the 25 minute mark (all outer towers and ideally at least one set of rax). I think this will be pretty effective but haven't had the right team composition to try this yet.  As good as Oct Core sounds on paper, I don't think it's the item for Necro this patch. It's simply too expensive (= comes online too late) and overlaps in functionality as a primary bulking item with other alternatives like Atos and Agh's which are both arguably better and inarguably cheaper. For a similar amount of gold I could have Atos and a mobility item (Blink/Force), which I'd take on a midgame tanking Necro build any day.  And mobility in teamfights I think is more important than ever. You have to be able to shed aggression with Force or aggressively ""alpha strike"" with Blink alongside your initiator to instantly wipe an enemy hero from the fight. Gone are the days that you can leisurely walk through a fight and count on the gold you invested in tanky items to keep you alive.  Also, since Oct Core is so expensive, it comes online late after a Treads/Arcanes, Mek, Wand start (even later if you finish Greaves). I don't think aiming that late with Oct Core is a good idea, as Necro just doesn't scale as well once all the items come on line for the enemy team: BKBs on the carries, Blinks/Pipes on the initiators, and Glimmer Capes on the supports. You have to strike hard while Death Pulse and Sadist regen are still significant factors proportional to HP values in the game, or have to aim late with Reaper's Scythe-focused builds and rely on your team to do the heavy lifting. The Scythe-focused Necro builds is fairly reactionary, which I really don't like. You have to rely on your team to create a favorable teamfight scenario that you can then seal with your ultimate. If your team can't do that as 4, you're pretty much deadweight.  Honestly I don't really enjoy playing Necrophos in 6.84 that much against a meta full of heroes like QoP, BH, Lion, Lina, Spirit Breaker, Slark, Disruptor, Warlock, etc. It's fairly stressful and the path Necro has to walk to win is becoming too narrow and unforgiving for my liking.  I've actually switched over to Bristleback as my main ""tanky teamfight"" hero and have been having much more success. I build him with a somewhat similar mentality, but his laning is so much stronger and I like that he's flexible enough to be played in nearly any lane really (so I can first pick him without any real fear). I like being based on physical damage as well and having the option to hybridize into a right-clicking build if needed. He also plays from behind much better than Necro IMO. I go Basi, Brown Boots, Wand, Mek, Arcanes, Greaves into Pipe (usually), Vit Booster, then Medallion/Solar Crest or Heart. Game is almost always over by that point, but extension would be AC or BKB if needed. Plays similarly to the way I play Necro but feels much more stable. It's nice to bring midgame Mek/Greaves capability to your team from the offlane and BB's physical damage output is more reliable than Necro's magic IMO (cuts out BKB, magic resist as counters), plus Quill damage is instant instead of slow Death Pulse travel time. Plus Goo helps out with Rosh in a meta where solo Roshing carries have faded a little (except Ursa).  That said, I think Necro is still quite good in pubs at lower skill levels where proper focus fire and coordination aren't as present and enemies are more likely to put themselves out of position. He'll always be good in those situations. Like I said before, I'm not sure exactly how much of my recent struggles with Necro are from the meta shifts and how much are from the higher caliber of games I feel I've been in recently, but I do think he's become overall weaker in 6.84.  If I had to pick a build that I think would be optimal to stay faithful to the style of Necro you and I both play, it would be:   Null + Tango (Bottle: if mid, and optional) Brown Boots Headdress Wand Treads Mek Atos Force Shivas/Agh's/BKB as needed   Greaves are nice but expensive and require dedicated team push to justify their cost IMO. I've pointed out my issues with Oct Core. The new Radiance also seems fun but is highly impractical unless you're stomping the early game super hard."
TrueDoTA2,37hgaf,reivision,2,Wed May 27 20:28:16 2015 UTC,you should never lose to any mid hero your aura and 600 range makes you out harass any mid if creep dragging and played properly.
TrueDoTA2,37hgaf,kslidz,2,Wed May 27 21:13:00 2015 UTC,"As /u/pepe_le_shoe points out, it's not really that hard to play around a level 1 Heartstopper. An extra set of Tangos will pretty much negate any early advantage you might get from your aura, and a lot of other mids have better, more consistent rune control. Bottle and runes or Bottle-crowing really shits on Necro's laning since his main method of harassment is...his aura.  And if you're assuming equal skill for the mid players, the opposing mid will be manipulating creep aggro as well. And if you're at a decent skill level people will know the range of Heartstopper and can often spend 50% or more of their time outside of its range.  Necro is also quite slow (290 ms) and has low starting armor (2.1). You trade even at best with enemy mids, even with a Null start. Heartstopper tips trades in your favor slightly, but again it's not too hard to deal with and really the only kill opportunity you get is if someone plays aggressive on you and underestimates Death Pulse. Which doesn't happen often, because Death Pulse is such a shitty skill at ranks 1 and 2. Super high mana cost for minimal heal and damage. The skill is balanced around hitting multiple heroes, so in a 1v1 lane it's very mana inefficient. You can only really start using it liberally on creep waves once you have decent levels in Sadist, at which point the laning stage is already over anyway. If you compare to skills like QoP Dagger, Windrunner Powershot, SF Raze, Lina Dragon Slave, it's clearly inferior.  Necro usually can hope at best to break even with the enemy mid and just get farm up for his Mek. Maybe push the enemy tower once he's past level 7 if the enemy mid rotates to gank another lane.  I used to be able to win mid with people underestimating the Death Pulse + Scythe + right clicks combo at level 6/7, but as I'm playing against more competent players now I often struggle to break even. And Necro gets wrecked hard by any kind of gank. It sets him back very hard and he often doesn't recover until 10 minutes later in the first T1 pushes if he gets lucky with a good teamfight. This is especially crippling against snowballing mids with high damage output like QoP, Lina, SF, TA, who will just repeatedly blow up Necro with an early lead.  So yeah, in my opinion Necro is not a good mid overall."

This has been my experience. I calibrated way too early, then spent the better part of a year learning the game and getting better in unranked. When I started playing ranked again, I could take pretty much any hero mid and crush the opponent. As my mmr has risen, and the quality of my opponents has started to match my own, I can't get away with stupid mid picks like greedy melee carries vs ranged heroes. Bristleback mid with a stick is still pretty solid though. Necro mid hasn't worked for a while, an equally matched player on qop or storm shuts a mid necro down hard.  Necro + wisp mid might work, but who is gunna do that..."

Mostly that was because they weren't fair fights, but, as viper for example, you can basically get 50/50 lh/dn, and can usually bully him out of the lane enough that his aura doesn't even put a dent in you. His aura alone, vs a strong mid hero, isn't enough to stop them from dominating him, especially if they recognize his threat, and adjust their play accordingly.  A casual headdress is usually enough to shut him down, unless he goes all in on aura, in which case you just dive him a kill him because he can't heal enough."

TrueDoTA2,37hgaf,wildtarget13,2,Wed May 27 23:18:44 2015 UTC,"I consistently disagree with others on the real strength of Necrophos. It isn't being able to blink in and obliterate someone. Lots of heroes can do that.   Necrophos thrives by turning fights around and applying incredible amounts of pressure. His real power lies in being crazy durable as long as he's getting kills.  To that end I much prefer to rush Phase Boots and Blademail to things like Mek or Dragon. Mek is too costly now in the early game, and Dagon is unnecessary and doesn't give him the durability he needs. Phase gives him sorely needed mobility and chase potential. Lots of damage early game ensures he's getting all the last hits and bullies pretty much anyone out of lane. With Blademail, he can pretty much 1v1 any hero that jumps him. From there you just need to build some HP to maintain your durability (Atos is amazing, Aghs and Octarine are also good pickups) and snowball to victory."
TrueDoTA2,37hgaf,tulisin,1 point,Thu May 28 13:51:51 2015 UTC,"I guarantee you, most of this sub doesn't think necro's strength is in burst damage, but rather sustain in fights."
TrueDoTA2,37hgaf,ProfessorMonocle,2,Fri May 29 05:09:00 2015 UTC,"Yes, he's a reasonable pick. In my mind, Necrophos is to pubs as Batrider is to professionals.   Batrider in professional play: despite repeated nerfs, he still sees play because his ult is incredibly strong at that level of play.  Necro in pub play: his ult adding 30 seconds to spawn time, plus preventing buyback with aghs, has tremendous impact. Farmed or not, core or support, in the lead or behind, a well placed scythe on the enemy carry is invaluable, and always will be. 30 extra seconds of missed farming, especially in the early game, makes a significant difference."
TrueDoTA2,37hgaf,nbwk,5,Wed May 27 18:44:30 2015 UTC,"In pubs, I think Aghs is a little bit overrated because of lack of late game saving for buybacks."

TrueDoTA2,37hgaf,nbwk,1 point,Wed May 27 19:49:59 2015 UTC,"I let someone else get the mek if possible.  Usually start with treads and then either rush blink or go atos/blink instead.

Always pick up a magic stick early, the burst heal is great.  Get blink as early as possible (after treads stick and optional bottle) UNLESS you are getting burst down, then just go for atos for the bulk.

His aura is one of the best harassing tools in the game, maybe even the best if you don't factor in orb-walk enabling abilities like Frost/Fire arrows. Level 3 and onwards, you'll notice your enemies developping, what I like to call, a tango addiction. Add another ranged hero to that and they probably are unable to farm.   One of the best duals I've seen is Pugna + Necrophos. Maxing Ward and Aura. Lane literally unplayable.  PS. Greaves. Greaves is so broken, oh God I can't even begin to describe it.

After that I try to finish the Octarine for the cooldown reductions and at that point the game is usually ending. If not then I would go Heart/BoTs/Rrefresher/Greaves.

The only fun and best way to play necro is definitely the Dagon necro. The burst lets you destroy everyone with ulti and let's you control the game because no one is going to approach you. Dagon also helps with creep jungling by bursting down the big creeps improving your farm as well. Sadism from waves is usually enough to keep your mana up.

I love the hero and I was happy that golems can now be killed by march, but the overall gold nerfs on creeps/jungle hurt him pretty bad, especially when coupled with the insane amounts of roaming that there are these days. Even if the enemy doesn't pick some popular solo pickoff hero like Storm/Queen etc. early roaming from supports wrecks him and its harder to bounce back by farming.  The way the game revolves right now makes the old item build (Dagon 5-> Ethereal) extremely risky, so you need to have some kind of protection early on, thats why many Tinkers go for either Glimmer Cape or Bloodstone.  Generally I don't like the hero in this patch, he can shine if given the space and his team is built around feeding him kills, but as thats a hard task, I don't think he's in a good place."

Anyway, I really find Tinker interesting now he's not in a super popular OP state (I always hate the first pick OP heroes), and he actually feels relevant again compared to last version. I think I still need to figure out how well he does with the new items (Lotus Orb / Glimmer Cape / Bot2 seem pretty good), but I think he's viable. I do think he should be played with a bit less focus on farming and a bit more on fighting early with rockets / laser. I'm going to give it some more games and see how well the new items work, but I'm having fun. While /u/JaCKaSS_69 mentions the roaming hurts him, I feel like an active play style actually suits him as well. Playing Tinker in combination with the popular BS / BH / SB is actually pretty nice considering the insane Rocket range and nuke potential, not to mention the possibilities with the new Boots of Travel."

I often find myself with allocations like 2/2/2/1, it just depends on how much jungle stacks you get and when you want to take them and what is needed. With all the early roaming, Laser and Rocket can net you some easy kills. Even the defensive capabilities of Laser are pretty nice in that sense. I think it'll still take me a while to get fully comfortable with the hero in this patch, but looking at other top players for Tinker it seems like there are a lot of different builds being ran (The most common seems to be 2/2/4/1). I really like this, being able to adapt to games in terms of skill builds is very pleasant and makes the hero pretty versatile."

And yes he can gank sidelanes but he has to get a good rune or hope there's no wards (unlikely).  And what about if tinker gets ganked or has a bad matchup?  If he went qw he's basically fucked since he can't farm.    Obviously qw is good but what I'm saying is that both builds are situational and you can't just throw in points willy nilly just because you stomped last game with the same build.
TrueDoTA2,37hbrk,Thalnagath,1 point,Sat May 30 21:12:47 2015 UTC,"now he's not in a super popular OP state    He never really was OP, just popular and annyoing to deal with. I think he didn't even make it above 50% winrate (competitive not even above 45%)."
TrueDoTA2,37hbrk,PrettyWhore,2,Thu May 28 07:04:05 2015 UTC,"I really want to see an Alchemist-Tinker game with Alchemist trying to get Tinker a fast Agh's, maybe by 20 mins or so (Alch has to get a couple items for himself first.)  Alch in a general utility/support role rather than carry role.  Tinker Agh's is fucking insane.  Like, just fucking nuts.  But players don't get it because Tinker ideally wants 6 active items in his slots, so that every time he hits Rearm he gets to push all 6 buttons again.  With Alchemist, Tinker doesn't have to make that choice.  And I'm telling you, that Agh's is OP as fuck.  Laser bouncing at 550 range with no damage reduction and no limit to how many targets it can hit is just... ugh."
TrueDoTA2,37hbrk,Thalnagath,2,Thu May 28 00:05:55 2015 UTC,"On the topic of the aghs laser you can actually bounce it off creeps onto Heroes, extending the effective range by that 550"
TrueDoTA2,37hbrk,rabbihitler,1 point,Thu May 28 00:20:31 2015 UTC,"Yup!  Considering each bounce does the full 320 pure damage and applies the blind effect, I honestly think his Agh's is pretty overpowered.  I feel like it either should lose damage with each bounce but retain the blind effect (like Fade Bolt), or do full damage and lose the blind effect on subsequent targets.  And, of course, this ignores missiles literally doubling in effectiveness.  But it likely won't see a lot of use because, as mentioned, most Tinker players would prefer an inventory full of items they can refresh with Rearm.  Still think it might be worth it to get a relatively quick Agh's and play Tinker as a teamfighter more than a split pusher - maybe an item progression like bottle, Soul Ring, BoT's, blinker, Agh's, Bloodstone?  Tinker isn't one of my better heroes but that seems like it might be doable."
TrueDoTA2,37hbrk,natedogg93,3,Thu May 28 02:21:51 2015 UTC,Does it bounce on illusions? It could be a pretty good counter to PL
TrueDoTA2,37hbrk,rabbihitler,2,Thu May 28 04:25:48 2015 UTC,"Yes It is really good versus illusions. PL however can just dispel it with dopplewalk so it can be tricky to time, as if he gets a second on you with diffusal illusions you are done."
TrueDoTA2,37hbrk,natedogg93,3,Thu May 28 12:57:29 2015 UTC,"So maybe really good against CK ult, and TB (but who even picks TB anymore)"
TrueDoTA2,37hbrk,Thalnagath,2,Thu May 28 13:17:02 2015 UTC,"CK ult is the one that comes to mind since its really on a timer, but yes or even good versus heroes like AM and Tiny that like to have tanky illusions that do a lot of damage with mantas.  I had a hard time versus the one Naga i played recently but I think that she is just a better late carry and hard to deal with in general as tinker."
TrueDoTA2,37hbrk,PrettyWhore,0,Thu May 28 13:26:20 2015 UTC,Not sure.
TrueDoTA2,37hbrk,natedogg93,0,Thu May 28 04:50:46 2015 UTC,Yes.
TrueDoTA2,37hbrk,Thorbought,2,Thu May 28 07:44:55 2015 UTC,"I mentioned it in my comment as well, but the aghs is great against illusion heroes.  Ive been getting it relatively early just to see how effective it can be and I think its a pretty solid item, some lineups get torn to pieces by the 4x rockets"
TrueDoTA2,37hbrk,natedogg93,2,Thu May 28 12:56:18 2015 UTC,It's both good and bad against illu heroes since rockets will suck but laser will be great.
TrueDoTA2,37hdns,CitizenKeane,4,Wed May 27 17:24:19 2015 UTC,This would be stupid broken. The whole point of the ultimate is that healing is doubled so that you can counter nuke damage. If they always survive why even heal?
TrueDoTA2,37hdns,benji1the1dog,3,Wed May 27 17:31:57 2015 UTC,"I think you could balance it by adding a healing soak to the effect if they would have been killed.  For example:  Huskar has 250 HP, Oracle casts false promise.  Huskar takes 750 damage, Oracle does no healing (for ease of explanation)  False promise ends, Huskar now has 1HP and a debuff that lasts until he dies that soaks up the next 501 healing done.  Now it's not the same as shallow grave where he just meks then immediately gets back into the fight, but would allow niche plays that would end in death without the aghs (ult+TP for example) and allow the carry to live if the fight is over before FP falls off."
TrueDoTA2,37hdns,j0a3k,5,Wed May 27 18:05:49 2015 UTC,A healing debuff from an aghs? It just seems like a bad idea with a bandaid.
TrueDoTA2,37hdns,benji1the1dog,2,Wed May 27 18:56:04 2015 UTC,"Well it wasn't my idea to begin with, but as far as aghs go it is an upgrade and it needed balance.  Even if it looks like a negative for the aghs to give a healing debuff, the alternative is the target just dies.  I don't think the base idea would be balanced without this sort of mechanic."
TrueDoTA2,37hdns,j0a3k,1 point,Wed May 27 19:05:57 2015 UTC,"Because if you don't heal they are reduced to 1 hp and will immediately get killed. With the lack of invis, Oracle's ult is now better used on carries that excel at running in and decimating everything (Sven, Huskar, etc). Having them reduced to 1 hp in the middle of the fight doesn't do much for them.  My reasoning for the upgrade is to make Oracle more diverse, for example in a teamfight he would be able to choose between saving a squishy support or using it on the carry.   edit: changed the post"
TrueDoTA2,37hdns,benji1the1dog,1 point,Wed May 27 17:41:07 2015 UTC,"Sorry man that just doesn't work. Max you can have without octarine is 3 stacks of healing (I think?) that are all ticking health up independently... If you as oracle has good timing and never gets disabled yourself. It's really not hard to just burst through it. You're missing the point of the ult which is double healing and disable removal. Edit: the whole 1 hp thing, which is already a skill that dazzle has, works for dazzle because he has a BURST heal.  I do think that an int modifier to the amount the heal does would be a good aghs though. I haven't crunched too many numbers here, but each int adds 0.5% percent more healing or something. If you had 100 int (that's a ton right?) then you would heal them for 250% of the heal."
TrueDoTA2,37hdns,ItsDominare,5,Wed May 27 17:55:36 2015 UTC,"The problem is that (apparently) a bunch of notable dota people in their 6.84 review videos said that they thought Oracle's ult was stronger now than before. This theorycrafting by people who obviously don't play the hero has spread, and now people will argue with you if you tell them Oracle's ult is pretty shit now compared to how good it was before. If you suggest that they're just parroting what some caster said and that they should try actually playing Oracle, you'll get argued with and/or downvoted.  As for your suggestion, I think the ult will probably end up getting another rework soon so I doubt he'll be getting an Aghs upgrade until IF finds a way to balance the base spell."
TrueDoTA2,37hdns,Shawn_Spenstar,3,Wed May 27 18:45:42 2015 UTC,"The only reason new ult is worse then old ult is because old ult had a 20 second cool down which was broken as all hell. New ult is better in ever possible way for competitive play with the exception for a cool down thats 4x longer. The new ult may be worse in low level pubs where no-one ever bough detection, but a constant strong dispell is way better then invisibility."

TrueDoTA2,37hdns,fearsomeduckins,2,Thu May 28 01:36:34 2015 UTC,But it's supposed to be worse. It was a rework and a nerf. And most of what's worse is the cooldown.
TrueDoTA2,37hdns,ItsDominare,2,Thu May 28 07:00:55 2015 UTC,"But it's supposed to be worse.   I know! That's why it blows my mind that people try to argue the case for it having been buffed in 6.84 - it was crazy OP, it needed a nerf, it gone one. You'd think that'd be easy to grasp but apparently it isn't."
TrueDoTA2,37hdns,fearsomeduckins,1 point,Thu May 28 10:15:32 2015 UTC,"I think most people who say it's better probably mean that it's better during it's uptime, rather than better overall."
TrueDoTA2,37hdns,pucklermuskau,1 point,Thu May 28 10:21:34 2015 UTC,thats not really a rebuttal though.
TrueDoTA2,37hdns,ItsDominare,0,Thu May 28 10:08:57 2015 UTC,"I don't have the energy to have that particular debate again; it always boils down to ""you're wrong because these three e-famous dota streamers said so on their youtube video""."
TrueDoTA2,37hdns,Shawn_Spenstar,1 point,Thu May 28 10:14:03 2015 UTC,"See what, the core ability is much better now that's not debatable. The cool down was going to he nerfed either way, it could be a 80/60/40 second CD with the invis, or it could be 80/60/40 CD with the strong dispel. Thats why they say it's a buff. Because the core ability is now better then it was before. The spell got buffed. The CD got nerfed. All your doing is arguing semantics."
TrueDoTA2,37hdns,ItsDominare,0,Thu May 28 22:57:41 2015 UTC,"That's a pretty ridiculous position to take - the cooldown is an inherent part of a spell's attributes, and buffs or nerfs to a spell often take the form of cooldown adjustments (see e.g. Dark Seer). You can't backtrack and say ""oh well that part doesn't count"" because obviously it does - the spell's attributes in their entirety determine its relative strength, not just certain parts of it. Therefore its perfectly accurate to dispute the claim that Oracle's ultimate got buffed in 6.84 because overall it clearly didn't, even if the active part is more powerful (and shorter) now."
TrueDoTA2,37hdns,benofnebb,2,Fri May 29 00:51:10 2015 UTC,"I personally think it's a little worse in low level pubs since people never bought dust to counter the invis, but overall neither better nor worse, just different. Previously the ult was better for initiation, now it's more of a situational spell with the right team comp. You might be right about the ult rework though, only time will tell what The Frog has in store for Oracle."
TrueDoTA2,37hdns,forkkind,3,Wed May 27 19:02:08 2015 UTC,I've always liked the idea of increasing the cast range of ALL of his spell with Aghs. Say 400 units or so. It would fill a similar role to a blink or FS and would be quite unique. Often a big issue with Oracle is that you aren't in the position you need to be in to effectively deliver all of your spells.
TrueDoTA2,37hdns,Lazarous86,2,Wed May 27 22:20:53 2015 UTC,"Might as well not pick dazzle. With icefrog it's too boring and with the direction he's going aghs on oracle will slightly reduce cool down, give the carry increased attack speed and 520 movement speed watch as your carry transcends time !"
TrueDoTA2,37hdns,Digitaldark,2,Wed May 27 18:03:50 2015 UTC,Just give back the invisibility component. That's all.
TrueDoTA2,37hdns,prezuiwf,2,Wed May 27 18:11:37 2015 UTC,Its a valid attempt to fix the hero. However it would be broken due to the double healing. Its essentially why dazzles shallow grave is fair. Still he is still a fairly new hero and will probably take a year or so to completely balance him to the point of viability.
TrueDoTA2,37hdns,Carnot_AoR,2,Wed May 27 19:32:30 2015 UTC,"The problem with a change like this to Oracle is that even though he doesn't win much in pubs, he's considered strong to the point of being broken for pros (he's not yet in captain's mode). So a buff on him would really make him more unbalanced, even though pub players don't typically do well with him."
TrueDoTA2,37hdns,punriffer5,2,Wed May 27 20:19:28 2015 UTC,"I think you are operating under a misconception. The point of False Promise isn't to save or heal an ally. It's to give them guaranteed uptime where they are unkillable but also need to be either ignored or focused, because a moderate amount of damage will be negated by heals. The 6.84 change further optimized it for this function by getting rid of the invis and introducing the constant dispel, making the hero unstoppable as well as unkillable (at the cost of duration and CD). An Aghs upgrade should follow this theme.  -Greater uptime of uptime: Reduced CD and/or increased duration. Perhaps the buff length might decrease at a slower rate if Oracle is in proximity (similar to Doom Aghs).  -Guaranteed length of uptime: Buff duration doesn't decrease during certain unpurgeable debuffs.  -Charges: give two heroes the buff or one hero extended uptime.  -Draw fire: Redirect damage to the hero and increase heal multiplier. Alternatively, make the buff expire more slowly the greate r the ratio of healing to damage taken."

TrueDoTA2,37h5g9,anotherbaldguy,12,Wed May 27 16:28:46 2015 UTC,"I've gone on plenty of losing streaks in my dota days, the key to breaking them is preventing them before they start. I used to go on tilt after a particularly frustrating game and immediately queue up for another game, usually thinking ""OK I gotta win a game to make myself feel better"". You can see how the cycle starts.   Make a personal rule for yourself that you will take a break after a certain amount of losses in a row, or if you feel especially tilted after a game. Also keep in mind that setting a limit for overall games played in a day can be a good idea too. 2 games with 2 wins is a lot better than 6 games with 3 wins.   From your post it looks like you are also concerned with your mmr. My advice to you is don't even acknowledge mmr. Don't look at it, don't think about it, just play with the sole intention of doing your best, not to increase your mmr. For some people the threat of losing mmr can cause them to play worse.  Good luck bud"
TrueDoTA2,37h5g9,CitizenKeane,2,Wed May 27 17:32:13 2015 UTC,"Adding to this with my personal view-I usually play in a 3 stack.

Helps break up the pace and we usually have fun with what happens."

Sometimes you play your heart out but the riki assumes invisibility makes him immortal despite the fact that the enemy bought a gem 5 minutes ago which they have already used to kill him three times.  It's ok.  It's a team game.  Sometimes you will be the guy who gets a phone call in the middle of a crucial teamfight and fails to shackle that enigma that just 4 man blackholed your entire team.  To err is human.  Dota is an insanely complex game, and even professional teams go on slumps sometimes.  The most important thing is don't play ranked while on tilt.  If you aren't feeling it then jump in the clown car and queue up for some no pressure ability draft.  Play against some easy bots and try to see how fast you can throne them.  Remind yourself that you're playing a game during your free time for the purpose of entertainment.  It's not your job.  You don't get money for increasing your MMR.  You don't get punished in real life for losing MMR.  TL,DR: If you're on tilt, then you're not enjoying yourself.  If you're not enjoying yourself then why in the fuck would you spend hours continuing to play?  Stop yourself from making the quest for increasing a pointless number rating your performance in a game into something more important than your happiness.  Go outside, read a book, drink, smoke, have sex, masturbate, hang out with friends.  Dota will still be there when you stop tilting."

Step back and do some other activities that enrich your life and you'll come back to the game with some great energy. Personally, I like to take a break after a crappy game and play some piano while I wait for another match. Usually clears me right up!   Finding a good group to play with is key and the only real way to find a good group is to be the kind of guy that regular, nice people want to play with. I've played on and off for years and have been in all kinds of stacks, but they would usually fall apart just because there are always a few negative people and it becomes tiresome to play with them. I also usually play unranked because I know I'm not committed enough to the game to be stepping on potential teammates who really care ; ). When you are playing with a really fun group, even the losing streaks and steam rolls aren't too bad. You usually have way better communication, timing and overall teamwork. You'll eventually put together that kind of stack just by using calm, positive voice communication (not too much) that recognizes good play in others. Don't go out of your way to (even internally) flame the mistakes your teammates make. You can do nothing about those and most of the people I meet in this game who spend time correcting others are also some of the most unlikable due to bad personalities.  Whenever you feel bad about getting stuck with crappy teammates, just imagine that most of my last 200 games were as IO (my favorite hero) in unranked matches. Usually playing solo with four stacks who don't even bother to communicate their plans with in-game VOIP.

That is almost double a radiance (granted the radius is a lot less). That's pretty good at all stages of the game.   Not to mention that you can have more than one ion shell out at a time. So imagine a team fight with 2 units with ion shell on them. Thats 180 DPS for most of the duration of the fight for everyone in range.. which will be everyone because of vaccuum/wall etc.   This is also the reason why Mek is so good on DS. He keeps the shell bearers alive for longer.  Also, with the extended shell duration of 25s.. That means you can possibly have 3 Ion shells out at one time.

A good example of this is EG vs secret and at one point in the laning stage universe was lvl 5 on clockwerk and zai was lvl 1 on dark seer, so he decided to ditch the lane and jungle up until he was a similar lvl to universe and maxing ion shell proved useful, it is also very strong to apply to your carry and is useful early game, just because you max something first, doesn't mean it's always going to be useful throughout the whole game"
TrueDoTA2,37kl6b,chvhch,1 point,Thu May 28 11:30:26 2015 UTC,"You admitted level 2 does same as radiance, bit don't want it to be better at level 4? Its his only damage spell (not really), and it falls off later on. Why wouldn't you max it? I don't understand what other option there would be."
TrueDoTA2,37gw13,MustacheGolem,10,Wed May 27 15:23:00 2015 UTC,"My thought is to have aghanims give him a damage shield (like flameguard) scaling with the amount of mana used in the ball lightning.     Allows him to initiate much more aggressively while both making him a target that needs to be nuked, but at the same time soaking those nukes. Increases damage in a different way than just improving the numbers on his spells. Doesn't mess with his mana/mobility scaling while at the same time provides a scaling damage/survivability mechanic that gets better as he gains mana pool throughout the game."
TrueDoTA2,37gw13,j0a3k,2,Wed May 27 18:29:05 2015 UTC,I really like that shield idea
TrueDoTA2,37gw13,Thorbought,7,Sat May 30 19:52:35 2015 UTC,My idea for a Storm Aghs is to allow him to cast Ball Lightning during Ball Lightning. You'd be basically invulnerable for as long as you have the manna to sustain it.
TrueDoTA2,37gw13,Carnot_AoR,2,Wed May 27 16:05:00 2015 UTC,This would cause people to only lvl the ultimate once. And exploit it's lack of speed for invulnerability. I don't  thing it would  be that good even then. Unless it removed the cast time as well
TrueDoTA2,37gw13,CobeySmith,3,Wed May 27 16:14:58 2015 UTC,The mana used is percentage based..
TrueDoTA2,37gw13,zenmod3,3,Thu May 28 11:52:24 2015 UTC,"Lol, people would not do this."

TrueDoTA2,37gw13,Carnot_AoR,4,Wed May 27 16:10:17 2015 UTC,"During his ult, Storm can attack and use items/abilities as normal while invulnerable. However, he will have periods of vulnerability after each jump since he needs to cast ult (and maybe change direction). If he could cast ult during ult he could be permanently invulnerable but not disabled (as long as he has mana), which would be something no other hero could do. Against instant disables and other abilities this could be very powerful."
TrueDoTA2,37gw13,Thalnagath,2,Wed May 27 16:18:10 2015 UTC,Storm is already this in practice.
TrueDoTA2,37gw13,Carnot_AoR,1 point,Wed May 27 16:35:17 2015 UTC,"Even with chained ults Storm has brief period of vulnerability that the enemy can exploit. The upgrade would get rid of those moments, though at the cost of a gold/slot and mana. It's certainly not something that would be picked up every game, but would be powerful in some situations."
TrueDoTA2,37gw13,Aikaterime,1 point,Wed May 27 16:43:38 2015 UTC,"The period of vulnerability is basically aslong as storm wants it to be, it's effectively irrelevant."

TrueDoTA2,37gw13,Tr0wB3d3r,3,Wed May 27 16:30:38 2015 UTC,"I was thinking about making him automatically drop a remnant every 4(?) seconds that uses no mana, doesn't share CD with his own skill and activates the passive. (Maybe not so useful?)  Or make his vortex grab everybody in an area around the main target applying a hit to everybody with the passive active. Creating a remnant of that hero on each of them(?) They already have all their electric remnants models done because ability draft.  Or change his passive so that it could be stackable, like 3 charges maximum? And apart from the charges he gets from using skills also give him 1 charge every 5 seconds (?)  Maybe some of these seem op but you are getting aghs on storm and except of alche giving you one, it uses 1 slot and doesn't give you much mana pool/regen compared to orchid/bs/linken/octarine or whatever.  Just my 2 cents."
TrueDoTA2,37gw13,functionals,3,Wed May 27 16:46:26 2015 UTC,"How about making every auto attack Overloaded, and perhaps making his autoattacks drop remnants (whether they do full remnant damage or partial)"
TrueDoTA2,37gw13,KnyghtZero,2,Sat Jun 6 18:38:16 2015 UTC,"I like this. I think an Aghs that upgrades or adds to his regular skills would be good, though I don't honestly know how good."

TrueDoTA2,37gw13,loveisdead,6,Sun May 31 00:13:23 2015 UTC,"Storm is really strong right now and an aghs upgrade that gave him more power with jumps would be easily overpowered. Right now you HAVE to build MP regen items on him, and that helps limit his power, even though the items are strong in their own right. I think if you reduced the need for mana on the hero it opens slots for other items and the hero would become silly overpowered.  Aghs upgrade would have to come in the form of something new for the hero, but right now he's powerful in the mid and late game, so its difficult to think of something that he really lacks."
TrueDoTA2,37gw13,Thalnagath,4,Wed May 27 15:30:13 2015 UTC,"Honestly his mana costs are still way too low. I don't think ss can have an agh's til his ult loses some baseline functionality, there's simply no room to give him an agh's upgrade when he's already so fundamentally OP."
TrueDoTA2,37gw13,loveisdead,1 point,Wed May 27 16:41:40 2015 UTC,Yeah once you get familiar with the hero you learn how easy it is to save mana and pretty much dodge any incoming damage.
TrueDoTA2,37gw13,Thalnagath,1 point,Wed May 27 16:51:04 2015 UTC,"That's true he's aready strong, but we also have to remember building an aghs on him early would  be incredibly  counter productive, giving it an excuse  to be fairly  powerful.  Tho makings itens active remnants sounds really  broken, would be really fun tho. Almost  every item in the game would be decent  on him."
TrueDoTA2,37gw13,longbowrocks,1 point,Wed May 27 16:12:13 2015 UTC,Not really. Bottle soul ring and eul's remove his mana costs. Going into agh's instead of orchid or finishing bloodstone would cost him nothing.
TrueDoTA2,37gw13,Thalnagath,5,Wed May 27 16:39:01 2015 UTC,"I feel like I'm missing something important, because you appear to be claiming that Bottle, Soul Ring, and Euls will solve all mana issues for a hero that can drain his pool even with a 200 charge bloodstone equipped."
TrueDoTA2,37gw13,dirtyslarkpicker,2,Wed May 27 18:57:32 2015 UTC,"""Mana issues"" in context means being able to zip in from 1000+ range, blow someone up, and still have enough mana to zip 600+ units away to safety.  Having those three items, assuming you're smart and sip bottle while zipping so it can't be interrupted, allows you to do that.  Obviously the scaling mana cost means it's probably not possible to literally zip nonstop across the map without pausing for regen, but that's not what we're talking about."
TrueDoTA2,37gw13,Andrew_Squared,0,Wed May 27 23:38:37 2015 UTC,"The problem is not him being strong, but being insanely retard-proof and easy to use and strong at the same time. If anyone remembers storm from a couple of years ago, now that was a hero that required some skill to be used effectively, the number of storm players that built soul ring after boots on a mid storm was so low (because bloodstone didnt require soulring then) and only those people knew how to play him and own with him (similar to meepo 3 maps ago). But right now, a guy who just installed the game can take a day or two and start playing and owning with storm on his own lvl, so long for the skill gap.   The best aghs upgrade for storm would be this solution: Return his old mana cost and percentages for the ulti, but make it so that with aghs he gets the current (or maybe more adjusted) mana cost with proper new percentages, that way if you want to use storm only for go and disengage escapes you gonna need to buy the aghs which will waste your gold and slot, but if you want to use storm properly and still gank/kill with the hero and not use the ulti just to run away because you have no idea what you are doing, then you gonna not need the aghs and go into better items."
TrueDoTA2,37gw13,loveisdead,-1,Thu May 28 05:43:22 2015 UTC,"I was thinking an ability to return instantly to where you last jumped from. So, you zoom from half way across the map to get into a fight, if you don't do any further jumps it can be used to dis-engage. Or if you are doing a lot of small jumps, it can be used to re-position back where you just came from."
TrueDoTA2,37gw13,Lazarous86,8,Wed May 27 15:45:08 2015 UTC,"That would be completely broken. One of the weaknesses of the hero is that if he uses his mana, he's pretty much dead. Allowing him to use his mana, or most of it, and still escape would be far too powerful. He'd also become a splitpushing nightmare, I think, which would add too much to his kit. The upgrade would be far too easy to abuse."
TrueDoTA2,37gw13,maddotard,2,Wed May 27 16:00:06 2015 UTC,"Overload is stack-able. Up to 5 charges for 10 seconds. Each attack use a single charge.   Thing with storm is you either make his spells more efficient (which I think is too good) or you make him have a new dimension to his abilities. Having overload be able to stack lets you be more aggressive with spell timing and not lose charges in the process. It is also good enough people would build it, but not good enough that it is going to launch his damage into a new tier. BKB still makes this upgrade useless."
TrueDoTA2,37gw13,longbowrocks,2,Wed May 27 16:46:43 2015 UTC,"it can be utility improvement , direct improvement and lastly totally new introduction.  Looking at recent agh addition , the pattern for for str and agi is much clear now. For int , it just pure improvement.  meh , ignore that. My suggestion.  Allied they get passed through with lightning ball will get static remnant benefit(air vision and the proc) , when the remnant properties is proc they also gain one charge of overcharge."
TrueDoTA2,37gw13,Red_Editor,2,Wed May 27 16:57:03 2015 UTC,Make the jump startup cost equal to its maintenance cost!
TrueDoTA2,37gw13,Its_no_use,2,Wed May 27 18:53:12 2015 UTC,"1) Whenever Storm Spirit uses Ball Lightning through a Static Remnant it deactivates then he carries the Static Remnant in the Ball Lighting dropping it once he stops.   Although it might be OP, it could return the mana he used to cast Static Remnant if he Ball Lightning through it. (70/80/90/100 depending on level).   For example. Storm drops the remnant then wait's 3.5 seconds for it to go off cooldown then uses Ball Lightning to initiate on another hero. He carries the first remnant and it's dropped when he leaves Ball Lightning. Remnant goes off then he drops another one instantly.   2) Changes Ball Lightning into two skills. Thunder Ball & Wrecking Ball skill. Thunder Ball does no damage, doesn't activate Overload and costs less mana for zip zaps. Wrecking Ball does more damage, activates Overload maybe even adding extra damage for it and costs more for mid to long range zaps.     Thunder Ball is for escape, traveling and dodging. and Wrecking Ball is more for team fighting and pick offs."
TrueDoTA2,37gw13,L3vathiaN-,2,Wed May 27 19:46:52 2015 UTC,So like Earth Spirit for the first one?

TrueDoTA2,37gw13,JaCKaSS_69,1 point,Thu May 28 12:32:51 2015 UTC,I think being as incredibly powerful as he is now the upgrade would have to be something more team oriented like allowing storm to grab a teammate with his ult and zip with them or be able to grab a teammate while zipping kind of like tusks snowball.

After the skill expires, Storm Spirit will enter a burnt out mode in which his move speed and zip speed are severely reduced until the skill comes off cooldown. Storm's remnants can be controlled as subunits until they expire or collide with an enemy unit. Remnants can zip only a max distance of 600 before expiring."

It works for Shadow Demon, and it makes Storm Spirit a bit more useful in team fights instead of only pickoffs. It's a very good ability, and making it a two charge or maybe even three charge would be awesome. You'd have to fiddle with the recharge time to make it not too OP, but pulling two people into a remnant, or getting X times 2 disable length on one target would be a great Aghs upgrade.  Either that or remove the 7% initialization cost for ball lightning. It's useful and not OP, but it's just boring.   Edit: also,why is OPs post being downvoted?

This latest crop of Aghs upgrades tended towards ""make this hero better at X"", as niche pickups. I think crowd control would be a niche pickup on Storm. Plus, it's not like it's a BKB piercing disable like Purge. I think two charges would be great, but not OP if done the exact same way as Shadow Demons. I.e. if you use one before the recharge time is over, they both reset"

Mostly uploads storm videos which are also applicable for other mid heroes. Demigod Dota: Replay analysis, coaching and teaching each and every hero roles (complete guide to dota 2). Recommended as well. Slahser: His coaching videos are very good. While he may not be as eloquent, but he explains himself very well and is a good teacher. Aui_2000: Very good replay analaysis. Most experienced player in this list and definitely recommended. Only problem I have is, he can not explain himself properly and not very eloquent. But still definitely recommended if you can get through that. Merlini: High quality and very good videos. He'd be at the top of the list if he updated his channel more. Simply Dota: He's a good player and very good teacher. You'll have fun listening to him. Has plenty of good videos. One complaint I have is, he has plenty of irrelevant and filler videos.

Hes been incredibly useful for me as I've been playing but also really helpful to those who just copy the pros, for example people pulling and double pulling but not knowing why they're doing it or when to differ from the stock item build (PA is one of the best examples at the moment with the debate between Deso + Vlads vs BF + HotD)"

TrueDoTA2,37gbzl,kolis764,2,Wed May 27 12:39:52 2015 UTC,"Hey, I've played on a lot of teams and captained a couple myself. The first thing you can do is stick with it. Your teamwork gets better and better over time and coordination can do wonders, no matter what the roles are or whose playing what.  The last team I formed I posted a tryout to reddit and found 4 friends and I kind of just served as a coach. It was by far the best environment to learn and despite me being much better skill wise going into it, I learned A LOT by playing with them because I put time into studying the replays and helping them learn as well. WATCH YOUR REPLAYS AS A TEAM TOGETHER.  I also came up with a bunch of drills to improve mechanical skill, which you can see here.  When it comes to ""captain"" someone is going to fill this role naturally, as in who is calling the shots in game. It's important for someone to be calling shots and say ""defend this tower"" or ""push here"" but it's also very difficult to do when just starting off as a team because everyone's going to be kind of uncoordinated anyways, so just try to force synergy and picking heavy teamfight lineups until your coordination gets better. Great practice. Maybe the captain will show themselves naturally through this.  As for drafting, I highly suggest letting just one person do this. Understanding drafting is something that takes a little bit of time, and bad drafting usually goes unpunished by your typical teams you run into, and you won't learn until you experience some stronger teams. To find stronger teams, start playing tournaments. I suggest playing Sunday Evening Cups Series (SECS) and TECS which can be found at http://www.semiprodota.com/. Free tournaments. Lots of good teams. $100 prizepool every first sunday of every month. Don't quit your dayjob. Additionally you can find tournaments at http://dota.playon.gg/ but require a buy in (very small). I'm actually not up to date on them, maybe there are some free tournaments.  For roles, support is by far the harder role to play, and so is the offlane. Anyone can play mid and carry because anyone can hit creeps. Put your most cautious player on the carry, whoever is the most consistent. Keep your supports and offlaner consistent and be willing to suck for a while.  As for picking your individual players, there's no correct way to sift through the thousands of competitive dota 2 players. I'm a free agent. Jus sayin ;)  Anyways hope this info helps, good luck to you on your adventures :D"
TrueDoTA2,37gbzl,thadpole,1 point,Wed May 27 15:23:45 2015 UTC,"Awesome advice !  ""everyone's going to be kind of uncoordinated anyways, so just try to force synergy and picking heavy teamfight lineups until your coordination gets better"""
TrueDoTA2,37gbzl,chvhch,2,Wed May 27 16:32:19 2015 UTC,"You could do with a coach as well Also, keep in mind that a good captain is one that can be honest with the team but not detrimental, you should let the team decide on the captain to be honest unless one of you is clearly the better drafter and decision maker, if you try each games so many other factors come into play on whether you win or not rather than just being the better captain. A coach/manager to help you look at your progress from a third party is also really good in improving your team. Personally, I believe that roles don't always have to stick, for example the positions 4 and 5 can switch (obviously) but if you know that a certain pick is key in a game to carry and your offlaner can play him better than your carry and your carry can play the off lane quite well, switch it up, this is done on every level from amateur to teams like EG. Also switching roles earlier on in forming a team is useful in finding out where everyone fits in and this could mean kicking people out. (for example zai played support for EG as they had universe yet now he is comfortably one of the best pro scene offlaners) One thing to keep in mind for improving your level and kicking things up a notch is you have to be ready to make changes if you need it, but at the same time keep in mind that you shouldn't go for changes just because you are doing badly but you could stick together and improve as a team, a good captain will know when to make that call. Hope this helps"
TrueDoTA2,37gbzl,soprof,2,Wed May 27 16:03:43 2015 UTC,i started a team with one of my best buds   won't work. You either play with friends or play to win.  Yes you should stick to roles. Professionals are good at one thing.
TrueDoTA2,37gbzl,sylvain_soliman,3,Wed May 27 12:46:05 2015 UTC,"Yes you should stick to roles. Professionals are good at one thing.   I don't really agree there… First pros are usually excellent at one position, but they are still very good at other roles too, which allows for instance a support to play an offlane NP when needed (and he might be better NP than the usual offlaner) and the offlaner to switch to supporting…  Moreover, the OP hasn't stated a level, but assuming it is not (semi-)pro level, if switching roles from times to times ensures a better morale (fun !), then please do it! It might even be beneficial to your global level assuming one of you might need to standin at another position in case one of the players is absent and your official standin has no idea how to play that role.  About other best practices:   set up a regular training schedule, and stick to it get more than 5 players (i.e. at least one standin) and train with the standin(s) too! get some means of communication IRL, so that when someone doesn't show for a match (or even a training session) you can reach him/her even if their internet is broken get some means of vocal communication in-game (TS server or equivalent) get some more means of communication (forum, facebook group, whatever…) for announcements, discussions, etc. keep the communication inside the team positive, even when things go wrong. If that means kicking someone out because of his/her negativity, well, do it. consider getting a coach, or at least a stronger player assuming that role from time to time enjoy!"

TrueDoTA2,37ewvm,nakulmhatre,16,Wed May 27 03:06:33 2015 UTC,"People online always hate battlefury. I think it's better this patch because of the quelling blade being added. I think it's game dependent, but if you forsee the mid game having a lot of time for farming then I would recommend it. I think it's also relevant vs PL / Chaos Knight / Meepo / Naga for illusion clearing. I think it's good, but not for every game. I think it's dependent on how tightly the enemy team groups, and also if there are things you need to clear. I think it's also only good coupled with HOD because of blinking micro allowing you to get between woods camps quickly. Haters going to hate, but I think it's relevant, and the crit cleave clear illusions out better than Mjolnir, and BF is more useful than BKB when facing Meepo / PL (not that BKB isn't useful still in most situations. At the end of the day I am a scrub who plays at a mediocre MMR, but I still can find use out of the item on many carries."
TrueDoTA2,37ewvm,Trollcommenter,11,Wed May 27 04:00:06 2015 UTC,"People dont' hate the battlefury itself. It's just generally a greedy item seen on Pa's with phase boots lifesteal and no HP. This results in a PA that gets blown up by good plays and ganks on the hero.  If you get away with it, aka dont' die, of course you can get away with it. But it is the best farming item for PA, better than midas, radiance, or other traditional farming items.  In most cases though you need HP and a BKB or else PA will die in the midgame. These Battlefury rushing Pa's we seen in our pubs who can't find farm or get pressured seem too set on completing battlefury and get it late and are useless all game. It usually overlaps with Pa's that don't last hit with dagger and don't solve their mana issues with anything but a perserverance."
TrueDoTA2,37ewvm,wildtarget13,1 point,Wed May 27 08:25:52 2015 UTC,PSA: Always build a battlefury with a backup plan and be ready to switch if you get pressured. QB first in many cases to get faster farm then build either broadsword (for most heroes) or claymore (for a few heroes like kunkka who would build a shadowblade) first so you can turn it into a more useful items if you abandon the build. That perseverance does little to nothing for most carries if they are forced into fights and can only be built into a battlefury or a highly defensive Linken's.  Remind your team of this every time they pick a battlefury carry and if they get pressured early.
TrueDoTA2,37ewvm,brinebold,0,Wed May 27 14:40:30 2015 UTC,"Well it can also be built into a lotus orb or refresher. I'm not saying either is good on PA, just nitpicking."

Now PA isn't seeing play again and people are again saying Bfury is only good for farming for 25 minutes.   Bfury is a pretty decent fighting item in all honesty. 65 damage was of course better before, but 55 is still pretty hefty. I feel comfortable fighting with just BF Treads at 16-18 minutes and get kills pretty reliably. Just as reliably at most other points in the game pre-bkb. You can do a lot of variations off the build as well. My favorite right now is BF Treads Manta Basher BKB HotD Abyssal Satanic. Manta is a great PA item and Bfury gives you enough HP regen and some mana regen to compensate for the 150 per use cost, allowing you to delay your hotd a while and take advantage of Manta.  If the game looks very fighty and you won't have time to safely farm a Bfury you can always go Treads Aqui Hotd Basher BKB and that's fine too.   Bfury is a greedier build but it's really not such a bad fighting item for PA. Blink Strike + 55 damage is pretty strong. If you're farming a 12 minute BFury, the fact that your gold isn't 100% efficient for teamfighting doesn't mean you're not capable of contributing at teamfights. It may not be totally optimal, but it's probably still the best in your match."
TrueDoTA2,37ewvm,Now_you_fucked_up,2,Wed May 27 15:34:30 2015 UTC,"Bfury is strictly niche on PA now. It was bad before and it's even worse now. Deso was already 110% better before and it's just stupidly good now, far and away the most efficient damage in the game.  Build basi, preferred boots, vlad's, deso.  BKB as needed, manta style highly recommended (purge silver edge), get heart or skadi instead of satanic. Get aquila and maybe a drum if teammates will get the vlad's.  Welcome to PA 101.

RTZ also isn't the only pro to have success with PA or Bfury, Hanni played it a good amount, Era has had a few games, HR played it decently as well. Bfury is a viable option in a sizable portion of games so long as you know how to not miss free CS. If you can't figure out how to fight with it or where it's viable, that's on you.

Do you have trouble reading?   Actually Branch is the most efficient stats item in the game.   Drums is a deadend item that doesn't do much for you for almost 2k gold. Its greatest asset is the aura and charges now, it's a really bad item for most cores. It doesn't give you jungling ability, radically speed up your farm, or give you any unique properties for almost 2k gold. I would rather just hold out a couple hundred and buy a flat Ulti Orb if I were that desperate for some stats. At least that goes into Manta. If you have Treads Aqui and still for some reason demand more stats, just buy the Ogre club for your BKB or Belt for your Basher, then build an actual item.    You apparently don't know jack about PA.   Apparently neither do any of the other top 100 PA players on Dotabuff, because Deso is rarely purchased. Deso and Bfury are ENTIRELY  different item builds. You would have to be really new to the game to be honestly comparing the builds unless one was just flat out worse in all situations. If you aren't looking to close the game out at 35 minutes, Deso isn't the build. If Deso isn't the build, then you should either go Aqui Helm Basher BKB (manta somewhere in there), or look to a Bfury build if you can get 10 minutes of free farm and don't need to be at 100% power for a few minutes after that.   Deso is neat new tech, but you rabid PA NEW META nerds are just as obnoxious as you were every other patch. The build is okay and certainly unique, but it's not the best build in every situation.  PA's strength right now is she has 3-4 good builds and 2-3 variations off of all of them. Blindly going Deso every game is just silly.

TrueDoTA2,37ewvm,Now_you_fucked_up,0,Wed May 27 17:19:55 2015 UTC,"It doesn't give you jungling ability, radically speed up your farm, or give you any unique properties for almost 2k gold.   It doesn't matter if it doesn't speed up your farm.  PA is an assassin, not Anti-Mage.  You farm heroes, not creeps.  With Silver Edge in the game, PA is under even more pressure than she was before to end the game quickly.  That's part one of why Battle Fury is trash on her.  And it does give you unique properties for 1800 gold.  Namely the aura, which is very significant - 20 IAS and 10% move speed to all surrounding allies, including summons and Chen/Bambi creeps.  Those bonuses translate into easy towers and huge bonuses in teamfights, which is good, because PA should be fighting early and fighting often, not pretending to be a really shitty Anti-Mage.  And because it's clear you don't read what you respond to, the suggestion of Drum is only if someone else on your team will be getting Vlad's - upgrading Basi to Aquila and buying Drum has a very similar total cost to upgrading the Basi into Vlad's.  It doesn't matter if it's a ""deadend"" item - you can sell it back after it's no longer useful to recover 925 gold (hey, that's close to half the cost of that ultimate orb already!), and the Drum charges should pay for themselves in towers and kills (or the prevention of kills on your team) by time you run out.  What're you doing, using Drum charges to farm ancient stacks or something?   Apparently neither do any of the other top 100 PA players on Dotabuff, because Deso is rarely purchased.   Dumb people are dumb.  What else is new?  Tons of people were doing that moronic 2x Ring of Protection build that one pro player made popular (was it EE?  I'm pretty sure I remember a bunch of that moronic ""EE-Sama kappa"" crap surfacing around discussions of the build) even though five minutes of napkin math conclusively proved it was a bunch of garbage.  People used to buy Hand of Midas on Crystal Maiden, too.   If you aren't looking to close the game out at 35 minutes, Deso isn't the build.   You should be looking to close the game at 35 mins, because PA is awful late game.  She's been awful late game even before 6.84, but the addition of Silver Edge makes it even more obvious you can't allow them to survive to the late game.   If Deso isn't the build, then you should either go Aqui Helm Basher BKB (manta somewhere in there)   Straight up inferior to Deso builds now.  It was competitive before they made Deso overpowered (seriously, 600 gold in one patch?  volvo pls...), now it simply isn't.  You don't need to bash them when you can literally one shot them 15 mins into the game.  Manta is the most common follow-up item after the Deso, too, especially with Silver Edge in the game.  You can also afford to delay BKB somewhat against many teams with a Deso build because they simply won't live long enough to be an issue.  You will literally one-shot most supports with a crit, maybe two if they're chufty like Ogre Magi or something.  Even most cores can't let you bang on them, assuming you're getting Deso at a fast timing in the same way you'd get your Basher+HotD or Bfury (3500 gold, so let's say... 14-15 mins?  Fair?)   I won't respond to your other points because I don't think you're very good at theorycrafting and it's not worth anyone's time.

TrueDoTA2,37ewvm,forkkind,1 point,Wed May 27 03:23:09 2015 UTC,Maelstrom is a waste on PA because she already gets a big attack speed boost when she blinks. Best item on her imho is basher
TrueDoTA2,37ewvm,sarcastic_potato,1 point,Wed May 27 14:13:14 2015 UTC,"Actually, it would speed up her farm considerably and allow her to stop ratters because of 1-2 chain procs when she blinks in on a creep wave. It's a midpoint between the huge greed of a battlefury and the fighting PA builds because it has a cheaper, more flexible, and easier build.  Building it into a mjolnir is probably a wasted move until you really can't build anything else but you could always sell it lategame instead if someone on your team picks up an AC to give you AS."
TrueDoTA2,37ewvm,brinebold,1 point,Wed May 27 14:49:19 2015 UTC,"i guess it depends on the game. BF + Coup de grace crit is pretty damn strong, esp if you have a dark seer or magnus or enigma on your team to group up enemy heros. But I agree that maelstrom might be just as good if you're trying to get an item to help with farm, because it's cheaper."
TrueDoTA2,37ewvm,sarcastic_potato,1 point,Wed May 27 15:27:06 2015 UTC,"Definitely not an every game item but if the situation calls for you to get a farming item or pick up some wave clear but you can't afford to stay away from fights long enough to farm a battlefury I think it has a decent place for that niche. It's definitely not a core item but then again, battlefury itself probably shouldn't be core in as many games as people build it in either."
TrueDoTA2,37ewvm,brinebold,-1,Thu May 28 00:46:59 2015 UTC,"Potato is incorrect thinking that Maelstrom is bad because PA has an AS steroid already.  However he is correct that Maelstrom is a waste on PA. Maelstrom procs don't work off of PA's amazing crit multiplier, there are much better items for PA than Maelstrom. Hell just a Yasha probably speeds up her farm more. Manta is an amazing farming tool on her as well and gives her good defenses. Maelstrom is just some dead end damage that doesn't synergize with her kit remotely.  I thought to try it out during the Maelstrom craze and it was pretty poor. Then Maelstrom got nerfed, now it's really fucking bad.   AC is pretty shitty on PA though, you're right. Most AS items are pretty weak on agi heroes. Butterfly isn't so great on PA, but Manta takes care of most of your AS needs if you want to go that route."
TrueDoTA2,37ewvm,Now_you_fucked_up,1 point,Wed May 27 15:29:01 2015 UTC,"I dislike battlefury on PA and here's why. PA has a very strong window once she hits level 11 with max dagger and evasion. Her evasion is what makes her so strong at this stage.  Going for earlier items like helm/basher/sYy allows you to kill people with good crits from level 2 coup de grace and them not being able to hit you since you've maxed evasion before they could farm up a MKB. Going BKB means all blur will do for you is hide on the mini map because once you have the bfury and start farming other items, this gives the enemies time to farm up their MKB making your evasion basically useless in fights. These are just my thoughts."
TrueDoTA2,37ewvm,DasEnde7861,1 point,Sat May 30 18:41:44 2015 UTC,I never saw the point of bf on PA. Farming PA has never been great.

I only really pick PA when I see a squishy line up...
TrueDoTA2,37ewvm,Mr_Affluenza,6,Wed May 27 09:43:28 2015 UTC,"AC is really not a good item on PA. Your evasion protects you well enough against right click which makes the armor less valuable, usually there are much better AC carriers on your team. You'll almost always need a BKB as PA after helm and basher.

TrueDoTA2,37dl56,Icephoenix231,30,Tue May 26 21:14:52 2015 UTC,"Clinkz is really strong right now.  I've played him a bit successfully from 6.84 and really like him.  Some tips:    Don't be married to Orchid.  It's a good pickup in some games particularly if there is an enemy hero who you need to silence to kill.  Heroes like Brew or QoP - heroes who don't always buy bkb or a defensive item forces them into it with an orchid - so it's a good pickup there.  But in general it's timing item and if you don't get it up early in general it's not as good, and it's a heavily pickoff oriented item, which can also make it a little less great on clinkz in a meta focused heavily on teamfighting.  Soul Ring is a great item on clinkz.  Soul Ring + Treads is ridiculously good for his ult - Treads to STR -> Soul Ring -> Treads to Int -> Death Pact -> Treads to Agi -> Kill the rest of the camp and stealth.  Almost effectively 0 mana cost and basically 0 hp cost because of the Death Pact HP gain.   The buff to deso is ridiculously potent on Clinkz.  When I play him it's part of my general core (Treads -> Soul Ring -> Deso).  You can pick it up very early, and your damage output is just massive with treads + Deso and rank 4 searing arrows.  Other items I think worth mentioning are HotD - you can get ridiculously high HP creeps to eat with it, or you can HotD enemy creeps for jungle level death pacts in lane.  Pretty decent utility that way.  I don't personally like it because I prefer deso as my orb.  Diffusal is another good item for utility and if you can get early on can be used for pickoffs - the purge is effective, and the mana burn and agi work well on him.  Really diffusal is a good item for both pickoffs as well potential via ratting as you can purge dust.  Scythe of Vyse - great for teamfights and pickoffs.  I tend to pick this up myself - once I have Deso I rarely feel the need for more damage until very lategame, - and hex is just so powerful in most contexts.  Also BKB - sometimes you need it.   As far as playstyle goes - a lot of people try to play Clinkz as solely a pickoff hero, but he's really potent as a split pushing rat hero as well.  If you were to rate his strengths overall I would say he's strongest split pushing and ratting, second strongest picking off and ganking, and weakest in team fighting.  You'll probably want to sort of engage in all 3 in any given game though.   When teamfighting, key is to get into an advantageous position past their frontlines to be able to pickoff their supports.  You have to be careful with this for gems and sentries - if you try to setup too early they can see you and kill you.  But if you go in the right time (after your team initiates), you can use the stealth move speed to get a pickoff while enemies are occupied.  Once a support or two are dead winning the teamfight should be much easier.  This is generally how most invis heroes should be played in teamfights imo.  Last resort is staying on the backline of your heroes, and plinking on their carry after engage, but I find this most risky unless your team has good counterinitiation.   For pickoffs as stealth heroes - the key is map awareness and good situational awareness.  If the enemy team is all missing except for 1 hero and you go on that one hero solo know that you will die.  It's really basic - you have to judge how many heroes are on the map, how long it will take you to kill the hero, and how long it will take the enemy team to get from the nearest tower to where you are taking the pickoff.   A general tip for playing stealth heroes - consider stealth as a tool to get across the map without being seen, less emphasis on stealth as an escape (though the skeleton walk move speed really helps for escaping).     Anyhow those are my thoughts.  I tend to prioritize searing arrows, ult, and then either strafe or I split strafe and skeleton walk points."
TrueDoTA2,37dl56,Drop_,4,Tue May 26 21:41:05 2015 UTC,"Great post, so I'll try to add to this rather than make a new one.   Diffusal is another good item for utility and if you can get early on can be used for pickoffs   Diffusal is criminally underbuilt on heroes like Clinkz and Windrunner. Other than its slow, /u/Drop_ mentions purging off dust (works for Track or Amp Dmg as well.) You can also purge Ghost Scepter's ethereal form (which was made cheaper and more accessible in the last patch for supports.) You can self-purge things like Orchid's silence if heroes like Storm or Qop rely upon it to pick you off (you'd be surprised how often this lets you skip BKB.) Lastly, you can unhex teammates and even cancel out an enemy carry's DD or Satanic.   But if you go in the right time (after your team initiates)   The reason why your team initiating is a good greenlight is that opponent supports use their disables. If your Earthshaker jumps, a well-zoned Rubick or CM will attempt to break his combo by lifting or biting. So if you want to skip a step, your ""greenlight"" is when enemy support disables are down. If the Rubick lifts your Bristleback, he can't stop you from killing him with Bolt or Spell Steal.  All teamfights follow this rhythm. Very good carry players are watching for specific disables to be used and then wreck face in the 10 seconds those spells are cooling off. During this gap, the enemy supports are using Forcestaff, Glimmer Cape, and Ghost to similarly survive.   For pickoffs as stealth heroes - the key is map awareness and good situational awareness   A note about solo pickoffs: Clinkz thrives when his team has very strong lanes. You're probably winning yours due to Arrows and if your team can prevent the enemy cores from getting their first few items, your midgame is scary as hell. If you are losing your lanes, reconsider your role. Your tier ones are probably down (longer reinforcement time to your pickoff location,) enemy supports have gold for detection and more levels to return kill. It's not ideal, but cut the lone wolf crap when you're behind. Either farm until you have an opportunity for strong objective holds or get supports to smoke behind you."
TrueDoTA2,37dl56,MrEShay,2,Wed May 27 13:50:04 2015 UTC,"Do you ever go orchid after soul ring?  I feel like if you're getting orchid you get enough mana and regen from that and soul ring becomes redundant.  I.e. you choose which to get depending on how fast you get your first Sage's Mask and how you see your farm progressing from there.  Also, if you HoD an enemy creep in lane and then death pact it don't you lose out on the gold from the creep?"
TrueDoTA2,37dl56,dbssaber,1 point,Wed May 27 03:18:43 2015 UTC,"You do lose out on the gold if you HOTD first  and then death pact a creep, whether in the jungle or lane.

TrueDoTA2,37dl56,DangerAwar,5,Tue May 26 22:02:35 2015 UTC,"I found that using searing arrows really makes it easier to last hit with Clinkz, and not because of the damage bonus. I feel that it is much easier to time then his actual auto attack."
TrueDoTA2,37dl56,jjohn268,7,Wed May 27 02:32:57 2015 UTC,"Someone correct me if I'm wrong, but I think its all in your head. The normal auto attack should have the same front swing, back swing, and projectile speed as searing arrows."
TrueDoTA2,37dl56,undatedseapiece,6,Wed May 27 10:25:17 2015 UTC,You're probably right. I feel searing arrows gives you more confidence in attacking earlier because you know you have that extra damage.

TrueDoTA2,37dl56,Ukgamer66,3,Wed May 27 08:45:37 2015 UTC,"Lots of good stuff mentioned here, so I'll only add one thing; Max searing arrows first and foremost. I seriously can't remember the last time I lost a lane with clinkz because he's such an enormous bully with those arrows. No creep aggro (if manually cast), extra PHYSICAL damage (I love watching an omni stop to repel only to die because he couldn't get out of range) and honestly, really low mana cost. His other spells are heavy on the mana, but if you're not using arrows to last hit, you shouldn't run out until you have your soul ring/oblivion staff if you're conservative."
TrueDoTA2,37dl56,icarus-_-sky,2,Wed May 27 22:46:11 2015 UTC,"I almost never lose as clinkz, I've posted a clinkz blurb here in a different thread before I believe. Max searing arrows and manually cast in lane, these allow you to literally do huge damage to the opponent for free. Other tips I can give is that soul pact is like a midas that provides a HUGE buff to you, on a shorter cool down than midas to boot. Always try to eat a big jungle creep for free money and damage. Another thing is that max level shadow walk offers near capped ms, and should be applied liberally for farming speed and positioning, just like bounty hunter be sure to wait the invis out a little bit, that way you can recast if needed. Sentries will reveal your positioning, however they won't stop the movespeed from shadow walk, which is scary. I've been know to run him mid and play like storm spirit, kill early, then stay off the map until it is time to gank. Playstyle is extremely important to clinkz, items are situational. Deso is really good, and Orchid allows you to literally become storm spirit on the map. The HotD trick is a pocket strat, remember that you do not get the gold from the creep and you almost never build satanic on clinkz, so beware of it becoming a dead end. Anyway I think Clinkz is very strong, and with max q, w and Deso you can melt towers faster than pretty much anyone."
TrueDoTA2,37dl56,DeanofDeeps,2,Wed May 27 13:43:04 2015 UTC,"I got him for all hero challenge last year and he's one of those heroes I had to grind (okay maybe like 2 games), he's weird. Now whenever I get him, I always end up behind and building stat items instead of damage. I believe this is the correct way to play him when you don't have carry levels of farm as he does decent damage with his innate abilities anyways.  You have to be very liberal with your searing arrows. I've done it as a roamer when 4 cores are picked. But you really should not run him as that, and don't run him as an offlaner versus competent teams.  You can't play him like a riki, it's closer to a bounty hunter, and only when he has max invis. You have to keep in mind you only have an invis more like every 30 seconds instead of 15 or like Riki.  You have to be really good at orb walking and attack moving before you have something like orchid+treads. Treads alone you still will waste a lot of chasing time backswinging.   Don't be eternal envy and build no mana items and go blink crit. But you dont' need orchid or hex rush every game. Medallion, soul ring, and bottle are all options for different purposes. Bottle is best for early skirmishes and soul ring is more for dodging fights and farming. Medallion is great right now because solar crest is amazing. Neither give as much mana as orchid, but you can find a way to solve it with orchid/hex/skadi later.   Yasha really helps you farm, which is something most clinkzes dont' pick up because of ""movespeed"" when you're in invis.  Just play him as a ganker and split pusher and invade their jungle. If you can't do that safely, rely on allies to assist you in kills."

TrueDoTA2,37dl56,errant_zebra,1 point,Tue May 26 23:01:59 2015 UTC,"Seeing that builds and playstyles are already mentioned in other posts, I'll recommend abusing orbwalk and learn to animation cancel with this hero for the earlier stage of the game, particularly in lane to pressure your opponent. Since he has searing arrows, you could manually cast it without drawing aggro, then immediately issue a movement, move and cast it again to harass opponent heroes more efficiently. Still, his bad atk animation is something to look out for and this by no means alleviate his slow attacks but merely made it possible to put in one or two more arrows before the opponent runs away from the creep wave. But hey, it slowly adds up!   Also, past 20 minutes be very careful with his invisibility. If you start spotting sentries on support, try to play the hero with the mindset that he has no invisibility, which generally goes true with other heroes that relies on invisibility as clinkz is pretty squishy without his ult so if you're caught out by a few heroes with dust or sentry you are basically dead. Good luck with clinkz!"
TrueDoTA2,37dl56,wuulala,1 point,Wed May 27 01:05:51 2015 UTC,I play clinkz fairly successfully ~60% win rate on him. They key is to move around the map. Clinkz isn't great in a team fight unless you have bkb and still that's not always enough. I generally get orchid for the good mana regen and disable to kill supports. Then I go Bots to allow tons of map movement. I also tend to run in behind the team fight and pick off supports or people out of position. He's tricky to get the hang of but he is very good once you learn how to play. Also use your ultimate when running through the jungle towards a gang or fight. The hp is tremendous.

She has a strong, level one targeted nuke, fast ms for chasing and escaping, and her aura means that her supports can easily win the harass-off that is a trilane vs trilane scenario.  This is the spot where I feel she outshines her competition.  I love to build her as a nuker, starting out with a Null, a pooled Tango and a Mango, getting quick brown boots and then rushing HotD, using that to stack ancients while building Phase and then disassembling it into a Mask of Madness to finish off the ancient stack with level 4 glaives, which gives me enough my money for my Veil of Discord which completes the early core.  From there, an Aghs, into BKB and into Refresher, and then I'll go for a Manta for base wrecking purposes.  If you have a good, mobile, tanky target for your Eclipse, it is one of the best high ground breaking abilities in DotA."
TrueDoTA2,379l8j,Starcraft_III,2,Tue May 26 03:13:44 2015 UTC,"That's a fine build if you can win early, but all it takes is Luna getting focused or the enemy picking up BKBs (or having Jugg, Omni, Lifestealer, etc) to become useless. Also certainly not ideal for farming."

Also, SD or Bane along with another hero that requires a good setup, like Mirana or KotL or Leshrac or Lina should work well."
TrueDoTA2,379l8j,Starcraft_III,13,Wed May 27 19:13:07 2015 UTC,"Disclaimer: I have a 15-5 record with Luna. I think she's sleeper OP at the moment but may be biased by my success.  Lucent Beam is cheap, has disgusting range, and is an instant stun for busting channels. Someone compared her to a weaker version of Gyro which really isn't fair: in ideal circumstances Gyro does more damage. But Rocket Barrage is short range, does damage over time, and spreads damage equally between nearby targets. In lane stage it is utterly nullified by creep positioning or any hero with a stun or escape. While Homing Missile has high stun and damage potential, it takes 10 years to land. Not suitable for breaking Black Hole, Fiend Grip, Freezing Field, or even a boring old TP channel.  Lunar Blessing makes last hitting a cinch. She has respectable hitting power to start with, but by level 4 with a 2-0-2 start, she's hitting like a tower.  Besides making pushing easier, Glaives can amplify damage on a single target if there's only 1 or 2 nearby targets. Makes Ancient farming very very easy.  Eclipse and Call Down are like Lucent Beam and Rocket Barrage in reverse. Call Down is fairly reliable and deals consistent damage. Eclipse targeting can be thrown off by nearby creeps and the damage is spread out, but in ideal circumstances? 900 damage after standard 25% reductions at level 7. That's absurd. It's bordering a level 3 Aghanim's Laguna Blade.  Laning: I run her mid fairly often. Last hitting power and quick 6 for ganking. Her absurd 330 base MS should make rune control laughably easy.  Otherwise, safe lane. A very effective partner is KOTL. The 2 of you have 2 high range and high damage nukes and Chakra Magic sustain. Plus the buff to Chakra makes it easy to land 2 Lucent Beams within a very short time frame.  Mid game she can do an awful lot. Treads / Aquila / Yasha / Dominator / BKB, she can clear waves and Ancients easily and very few can afford to fight her.  Scepter remains a situational pick-up IMO. Not a focus item for her."
TrueDoTA2,379l8j,EdenBlade47,3,Tue May 26 05:40:36 2015 UTC,"Agreed on all points except agh's. It's now core on her. You draft Luna with a blink initator or someone fast and tanky and staple a supercharged Eclipse to their butt. Greatly reduces her reliance on early BKB.  Luna won't be op as long as they keep nerfing bkb. Lina agh's ends her. Qop in general wrecks her. Bane, Rexxar, Mag etc ruin her. SD agh's fucks her like it fucks everything else (if you wanna talk OP...)  Good hero but you need agh's and the right kind of draft.  I also like stats over extra pts in aura. Less damage but the IAS and HP add up fast."
TrueDoTA2,379l8j,Thalnagath,3,Tue May 26 14:37:09 2015 UTC,"I feel like unless you've got another carry on the team, you lose out on late game potential by doing core Scepter. I'm always wary about focusing on carry Heroes' abilities rather than complementing their physical damage and survivability. But with that said the current meta is geared towards more 30-40 minute games, so if you're lacking teamfight other than Luna I guess it's the way to go.   Each level of stats is 2 attack speed, 2 damage, 0.29 armor, 38 HP, and 26 MP. Her aura is 14 damage, then 8 a level. I don't think it's worth skipping, not just because she will hit harder with it, but because a flat bonus of 38 damage to all allied heroes is absolutely huge for fights.   Yes, she's countered pretty hard in the early/mid game by any hero with a long disable and BKB-piercing. Late game if you can survive that, it's as simple as popping off Satanic afterwards to make up the difference, but she is definitely not as hardy as some carries."
TrueDoTA2,379l8j,EdenBlade47,3,Tue May 26 16:16:38 2015 UTC,"But Luna is worthless in fights without 20k net worth or Eclipse. Most of why she rushes BKB is so she doesn't get spammed down 2 sec into her eclipse but that just means you have a 5 sec bkb right when you want 10 sec to right click with. Agh's solves ALL of that, hence it's core.  You will replace it super late, but it's dumb to plan for 80 mins in when you could win with agh's at 35.  Agreed on aura. I prefer the extra stats but some prefer the aura, I think it's about playstyle. I don't think her right clicks matter in fights until later in the game."
TrueDoTA2,379l8j,Thalnagath,5,Tue May 26 16:49:02 2015 UTC,"I don't know if I agree on stats over aura, but not for her right clicks as much as for her team's right clicks and how much it helps pushing towers down after a won teamfight.    But definitely think that Agh's is underrated on her now.  You can skip bkb and have a really high team fight impact without being in the middle of everything.  It's really intimidating having to deal with a big area of aoe damage and it's kind of hard to judge the area in general.  Combined with say an overgrowth or any other ""keep you in place"" skill it's a won teamfight with zero risk for the luna."
TrueDoTA2,379l8j,Drop_,2,Tue May 26 21:13:11 2015 UTC,"But definitely think that Agh's is underrated on her now. You can skip bkb and have a really high team fight impact without being in the middle of everything.   Exactly.  You can't really skip BKB on her, but you don't need to rush it if you get Agh's.  You do something like aquila, treads or phase boots, HotD (or maybe even Vlad's?  Vlad's is better IMO unless you can't rely on teammates to stack), then get your Agh's.  Maybe get another item after Agh's, then BKB, and by that point if you haven't won or lost, the game is getting late and you transition from fighting primarily around your Eclipse into fighting primarily around your clicks and you can sell the Agh's when needed.  That said, I think it might even be worth it to have Agh's+Refresher on Luna, especially if you get other items that can be refreshed like Satanic, Abyssal Blade, etc.  Two Agh's Eclipses back to back sounds like a fucking planet cracker for sieging high ground - 2500 cast range means you can drop it on their high ground from WELL outside possible initiation range (except Hookshot, but if Clockwerk hookshots you to low ground... you probably won that fight anyway) and 675 AOE means it covers pretty much the entirety of the tower area.  One thing about that though that I guess I should just test - can you have more than one Eclipse run concurrently, like Razor ult?  Or will starting the second Eclipse end the first one?"
TrueDoTA2,379l8j,Thalnagath,3,Tue May 26 22:02:48 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure the second one ends the first one.    Now I just want to spam luna and go Treads -> Aquilia -> Agh's -> Octarine Core/Refresher   Just start every fight from 1.5k range or so, then run in to clean up.    Or I might just go arcanes and go for the skill spam in lane.  Then make the arcanes into core lategame.  I've had a lot of success with cores getting early arcanes in dual lanes in 6.84."

I've had a lot of success with cores getting early arcanes in dual lanes in 6.84.   THANK YOU.  People always act like I'm crazy for getting manaboots on CK, but it completely eliminates his mana issues, allows him to spam his skills practically on cooldown in lane, and facilitates extremely aggressive play (one of his strong suits.)  I mean, I was doing that before manaboots got boosted in 6.84, but I feel it's even more legit after they got double buffed in 6.84.  As for boots on Luna, I actually really like Phase Boots.  Since I usually go stats instead of extra points in aura, I get STR from stats to compensate for lost STR on treads, and with phase boots she can get pretty close to 500 ms very early in the game, making it very difficult to chase her down or escape from her."
TrueDoTA2,379l8j,Thalnagath,2,Tue May 26 22:33:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah I went offlane with Omni as Sven the other night.  The sven buys first item arcanes and I'm thinking this guy is insane.  First item arcanes on Sven!?  But I didn't say anything because I needed the mana.    In the end though we dominated the laning phase hard.  Got several kills on their safelane carry and support, and just snowballed to end the game.    I think they're so potent now that they got so buffed in the last patch too.  I think they're probably legit on any core in a lane with pretty much any kill potential."

TrueDoTA2,379l8j,Thalnagath,9,Tue May 26 22:44:12 2015 UTC,"She doesn't really do anything that gyro doesn't do better. Early game damage? Gryo rocket barrage is crazy, and much better than lucent beam.  Farming? You might go for a 4--2-2 if you want extra farming with glaives, and that might be a little faster since there's no cool down, but gyro can still farm as fast and a carry gyro only maxes two skills, whereas Luna will want to have points in all three.   Mid game damage wise, Luna has a great ultimate, but gyro calldown provides slow as well as great damage, yeah it won't follow you but with the aoe buff that is less of an issue now with smart placement.   Lategame flak cannon will get everything. Regardless of proximity to the initial target.  Luna has a damage aura which is nice, but pick drow or venge if you want that. Basically she just doesn't have any amazing strengths that you can't get with another hero that does more, and unless people start building her a little differently, she's still very BKB dependent."
TrueDoTA2,379l8j,Waltzman,14,Tue May 26 00:43:36 2015 UTC,"Well let's talk about some of her strengths, I know she might seem weak compared to gyro, but she has strengths too.  Like the aura is much better than drow's early and it helps her support harass.  It also gives her great early damage to help her last hit.  Gyro has garbage damage early, but he has better projectile speed and range.  It's kinda a trade off but it's a strength to have great early damage on a ranged hero.  Gyro's ult has decent damage its the slow that is good and the cool down.  Luna can do like over one thousand magic damage on a lone target, but the reliability is garbage of course.  I'm trying to play devils advocate, and  I see gyro's strengths but it's not like he trumps her in every way.  I kinda don't care for the heroes voice either lol don't ask why"
TrueDoTA2,379l8j,Waltzman,4,Tue May 26 01:07:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah gyro's damage early isn't great, but in level one engagements the rocket barrage will do a lot, especially with the cast point change. I'm not trying to say she's garbage tier or she's not viable. Just trying to look at it from a competitive perspective.   Her harass potential with lucent beam and extra damage is great. Answering one of the questions you raised in your original post, I think she can definitely be a good pick, in the right lineup, similar to drow. I might consider running her as a carry and put earlier points in glaives to speed up jungle  farming.  Personally I would want to run her mid. She would benefit a lot from the levels, lucent beam is good harass or last hitting aid, and her damage is good. The downsides are she has no escape. She is actually pretty fast as I have been reminded. I might consider a blink on her, with a sange and yasha. If she goes mid depending on the carry I can see an argument for silver edge as well.  I think she is still a strong hero, but doesn't provide enough as a carry to give her the 1 priority, but I think with the right lineup a mid Luna could be great"

Luna mid needs to harass with Lucent Beam starting at level 3 (2-0-1) She's best against melee mids and weakest against nukers like Skywrath and Zeus who can whittle her HP down quickly, but fine to run against say Necrophos, Bloodseeker, Dragon Knight, etc. Also good against farm mids: as long as you consistently hit and deny, she'll destroy SF, who needs last hits to build up Necromastery for his auto but is also a fairly squishy hero, yet slow in comparison to Luna (305 base?

TrueDoTA2,379l8j,stoner_cough,-5,Tue May 26 07:16:58 2015 UTC,"levelling her passive early has never seemed like a good idea to me. pushing the lane that hard, just to let your support harass a little better?"

TrueDoTA2,379l8j,Electrohooker,2,Tue May 26 06:04:44 2015 UTC,It will let you dominate lane as far as last hits go. Even one point is enough usually.
TrueDoTA2,379l8j,Thalnagath,5,Tue May 26 01:51:15 2015 UTC,"I believe Luna is a much better late-game carry than gyro is, mostly because glaives is a passive, and not on a per-attack basis, like flak."
TrueDoTA2,379l8j,stoner_cough,4,Tue May 26 02:03:51 2015 UTC,"The glaives have a %35 damage reduction for each hit however, and you only get to hit six targets.  Gyro flak cannon has 1000 search range, no damage reduction, and no target limit. Yeah you only get six shots, but with a couple big damage items six will bring most heroes low.  Don't get me wrong, glaives are awesome. Break that tower and Luna will clean up the rax faster than almost anyone with her glaives, but in a straight up team fight, late game with comparable farm a gyro will do more damage to everyone with his right clicks"
TrueDoTA2,379l8j,forkkind,5,Tue May 26 02:24:16 2015 UTC,"Well that's why you generally get damage items on Gyro, while Luna is generally built more tanky.  In the late game she has more sustainable dps and push.  Also, IMO, she's the best basebreaker in the game."
TrueDoTA2,379l8j,L3vathiaN-,2,Tue May 26 02:43:35 2015 UTC,Luna is a much stronger teamfight hero than gyro at any stage of the game.
TrueDoTA2,379l8j,Waltzman,1 point,Tue May 26 14:40:31 2015 UTC,Unless it's just two people sitting next to each other. But otherwise you're probably right.
TrueDoTA2,379l8j,stakoverflo,2,Tue May 26 12:18:20 2015 UTC,"Luna is basically bad anti Mage and gyro condensed into one. The only way to play her is your bkb timing and farming up your ancient stacks then you're ready to go. She's not that great early game which makes her a really bad mid but as soon as you get bkb after your helm of Dom it's basically go time for your team to hard push and abuse your passive and Glaives. If she doesn't snowball off that push the game will start getting harder as she can't compete 1v1 against other cores unless they completely disregarded bkb. Aghs is great on her but the stat increase is negligible, she needs to be the one in the front hitting towers  and she's still going to get nuked by magic damage."
TrueDoTA2,379l8j,stealthmarauder,2,Tue May 26 19:29:06 2015 UTC,"I have about 100 games with Luna with a winrate lightly above 60% win rate. I love playing her as the greediest carry possible. I go to lane with Ring of Protection, Circlet of Nobility and regen. I procceed to buy brown boots and morbid mask. I then let my two supports farm the lane, around my level 5 and immediately move onto the jungle. my build is 0-0-2-0 at level 5 with 3 kept skill points. You use those skill points when you leave the lane and you upgrade your Glaives. You don't want it earlier cause your lane will be constantly pushed.  After Morbid mask, I procceed to finish Aquila, Treads and Domi. At that point, Luna is one of the best GPM machines in the game. You clear 3 jungle spawns and a wave of lane creeps every minute, bottom if you're Radiant, mid if you're Dire.   I procceed with a Yasha, Ogre club and then I have to decide between BKB and Manta. Usually I go for Manta. The skill build is 0-4-4-0 at 8 and 4-4-4-0 at 12. If there is heavy magic immunity implied, you just get the single point in Beam for the ministun utility and you skip the rest of the points and Eclipse completely, getting stats instead.  Luna is a hell of a pusher and sieger. She can demolish towers, her glaives are ridiculous and people often underestimate them. A 22 minute Luna that has Treads Domi Ogre Club and Manta can take down a lane of racks in one or two waves of her creeps, with ease.   Overall, she jumpstarts at the lane getting her boots+morbid, procceeds to jungle, leaving space for your supps to get farmed up, she builds an impressive jungle gpm while stacking ancients and is a constant threat from lvl 8 and ownards. Downsides? Extremely squishy, heros like Lina and Lion melt her till she gets BKB, dual or tri offlaners can create serious problems to her and of course, the unorthodoxness of this build may cause pubbers to get... extremely vocal with their judgement. But it works.   One of the best games I've had with this build: http://www.dotabuff.com/matches/1450558370 a little less below 5k EU. The power of the Glaives shows really well in this game. At around 18-20 minutes I got jumped by an Infested Huskar and a Magnus Skewered next to me. He missed his RP with my Manta timing and Luna+2 illus procceeded to kill a Huskar, a Lifestealer and a Magnus of almost the same level, all of them, in 5 seconds."

TrueDoTA2,37atmr,NutellaManatee,12,Tue May 26 06:48:11 2015 UTC,"I'm a big clockwerk player. He's my most played, and dare I say I can play him decently. I play him in unranked as well as ranked, which is 4k+ if that matters to you.  Now, the first thing I can say is his item range is HUGE. He can go 6 items one game and 6 different items the next. It is of my opinion that offlane is his best role for him. While he can play mid decently, there are much better heros out there, and in addition, he is one of the best offlaners. Tanky, can mess with pulls/harass supports, threaten a kill on anyone in lane, and only needs exp.  Early Game  Clock's biggest problem early game is his mana. Assuming no stat items, at level 6 he actually cannot cast all of his abilities consecutively. So, most builds revolve around that.  Bottle - Probably most core on him. The static mana regen is very nice for a an early game low mana hero like clock. The hp regen is nice as well. Clock shouldn't really be in a lane post lvl 6/7 unless his hook is on CD, so he'll constantly be getting runes, all of which are great on him.  Urn - Urn is, also, great on him. Helps a lot with his mana problems, the strength is great for hp and right clicks, and he'll definitely be getting a lot of charges (remember to use them offensively!).   Soul Ring/Medallion - I'm lumping these two together because they're very situational but not very good. Soul ring has some synergy with Traqns (I'll get to boots in a sec) but the hp regen isn't great (b/c you'll have tranqs), bottle is cheaper and has more utility with runes. Medallion is again nice but most of your damage comes from magic. I suppose it could be good if you want to do rosh early but you have no good medallion carriers.   Boots   Power Treads - These are probably the safest choice. These good great with bottle/urn because of tread swapping, which is something that is excellent on clock. The extra 9 int can be great, as you'll cast you hook/cogs/BA before you even start to right click/take damage, when you can then swap to strength. Probably the best, the only downside is their cost. Tranquil Boots - Probably my personal favourite. I mostly see NA players going for these. The regen is great if you only have a bottle/non hp regen item, since clock gets tanky quick just through stats, and bottle regen might not be enough. The move speed is also quite good for positioning, which is KEY on Clock. I'll elaborate on that later. In addition, the cost is really cheap and allows you to get better items quicker. The build up is great, especially if you start with a ring of protection (not awful).  Phase Boots - These use to be the most popular and I believe still are due to guides, but I really don't think they're that good. The increased movespeed can be good but you're generally taking damage/using spells anyways, and tranquils can do that at a much lower cost. You can't phase through cogs. The damage is comparable to treads which give way more utility. Maybe get it against something like a NP for phasing against treants...but against an NP you'll want a force, which will do the same anyways. Don't recommend. Arcane Boots - These solve your mana problems which means you won't need a bottle. You might still want an urn for hp regen, though. However, these offer no damage, no hp, and no tankability. I'd really only recommend this if you're going something like a mek, because then you need the mana for the active and greaves are a strong item anyways. Brown Boots - I see Universe do this a lot. Stick to brown boots then get a blademail/forcestaff (usually a blademail) to have a quicker impact. This can be good, but it's really hard to roam without other ones. In addition, Clock often has trouble with slots which means you'll want to get the most out of yours (which means upgrading boots). You could argue a travels rush and this is actually something I've theorized a lot on. I think it can be good as it'll save you the tp slot and allows you a lot more global ganking/counterganking, which is nice. But it's 2k gold that could be a blademail/force/half an aghs. I wouldn't recommend. BoTs - Detailed above.   Mid Game  Okay, so we've started to get to the mid game. Laning is over, you're trying to gank a lot, maybe team fights are happening, maybe they're not. Most of the items here will be utility, to help you survive since now people can actually kill you. Clock rarely builds for damage. Early game he has damage through abilities, late game he hooks in, cogs as best he can then probably dies. Such is the life.  Blademail - Most built and has a lot of synergy with the hero. You isolate someone, blademail, now they can't attack you all while you're killing them with BA. However, I do think it's slightly overrated. The damage sucks, the armor is nice but minor, and the same goes for the int. The buildup is easy, which is good, but this item is very much countered by magic immunity and doesn't help at all with positioning, which again is HUGE on Clock. The earlier you get this, the better. Or perhaps later if the enemy isn't getting bkbs. That's why you see some brown boots into blademail builds. I'd say this is good against a lot of heroes but not all. Some examples include Skywrath, Huskar, Lina, etc. Hero's that rely on burst damage. These heroes can often times just kill you if you jump them (or they're nearby) so this will help.  Force Staff - I'm gonna start writing less so I don't hit the text cap. Anyways. Force staff is usually your second item half the time, the other half usually being blademail. The int is amazing, hp reason is minor but nice, and the active is ridiculous on Clock. Force into someone and cogs/BA, hook in then back up, cog them for mana burn then push them into it again for twice the proc. You can also force someone into you then cog them and literally be EG.Universe. Cog someone then force out if you need to live, force to highground...this item is great. Very good. In addition, it can be picked up more frequently than just mid game, but is best mid game.  Mekansm - As mentioned earlier, this should only really be gotten with Arcanes, otherwise you really cannot sustain while using it. It just got nerfed so I'm not sure how good this pickup is, but if you're looking to 5man early and noone else can pick it up, Clock isn't bad. More tank, active is great cause you'll always taken damage, and Greaves are strong.  Eul's - Mana is great, movespeed is very good for positioning/chasing, active is great for chasing. Easy buildup too. The negatives are it's more expensive than other items, and it offers no survability beyond delaying your death by 2.5 seconds. The mana cost just got nerfed so this is probably less viable than before, though of course it gives mana. Very situational.  Blink Dagger - This is rather unorthodox, but one I think is good. I wrote a lot about this here: http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueDoTA2/comments/33d9vm/lets_play_a_game_undervaluedovervalued_items_by/cqn2w6f?context=3 TL;DR Positioning is great, can be like a non-stunning/dmg hook. However gives no stats, tough buildup, and is tough is games w/ good blink disablers (spectre/zeus being obvious). Situational.  BKB - BKB is just a strong item cause magic immunity is OP. However, in the meta of QOPs/Linas, this loses some strength (though blademail is of course great against those!). You're always gonna be in the midst, so this can be good, though honestly tanking spells and dying can be useful, because those aren't going to your carries. However, being useless is not useful, so if the game calls for it, get it.  Halberd - Sange is great because it's one of the best items for strength. The active is excellent against right clickers but especially Huskar, or PA, or WR. Evasion helps you live more, and if you can get a maim proc, great. Good item, but as always, situational. Also, it's the best progression if you pick up a casual sange. S&Y isn't good. Bone7 did it in their elimination game against Navi at ti4, and even after watching the replay (which you should, Bone destroys) I cannot for the life of me find out why you would ever go that item over others. I just can't.  Aghs Scepter - Probably the most overrated item on Clock, but that doesn't mean it's bad. Stats are nice and that also makes the buildup easy. A 12 on hook is nice, but if you rush this you don't have the mana for it. You will be able to kill heroes earlier than 12 seconds, and if you can't, that means you probably died, or they're a huskar. Late game, if you're hooking in, two things will happen: 1. You will die because you hooked in. This is to be expected. 2. You will live, and this probably means you won the fight, which means that hook being up means nothing because the enemies are dead.  If the game is teamfight heavy that means 12 seconds will spell the end of the fight, and if the game is pickoff heavy that means you only need to land one hook to decide the next minute. 40 seconds is a short time late game. Consider going something that helps your team more, or counters one of their heroes harder. Though this item is ridiculously fun if you're good at aiming hooks.  Late Game  Late game you're basically good for your hook and cogs. You can maybe kill a support but even that gets harder. Clock is an early-midgame hero, so don't be surprised if you drop off.  Shiva's Guard - Probably my favourite item to pick up late. The active is amazing for chasing and since you're going to be hooking into the enemy during fights, it will affect everyone. The armor/attack speed slow will also help you survive a lot, and the int means you don't have mana problems.  Necro - One time I read a theorycraft on this. Basically you hook in, then deploy the necro, and the person on your cogs gets wrecked. Necro got buffed (at least 1 and 2 did I think) and the stats are nice. It's good for pushing, it's good for dewarding, and good for invis enemies. But there are usually better items.  Will continue."
TrueDoTA2,37atmr,pastplayer,9,Tue May 26 08:41:36 2015 UTC,"Scythe of Vyse - Sheep is a great item. I believe it got nerfed because it no longer uses break, but still. Against a Storm, AM, or QOP (or other heroes) the active is still good. It offers more control for you.   Orchid - I'm putting this in late game but it can be mid game oriented instead. I've gone for builds a couple times where I go boots into orchid. Maybe a bottle/urn in between. It can be good, but the issue is you won't be able to get it early to be impactful, because a Clock can't farm really well due to his skill set and because he's normally off. In addition, if you go for this early you won't be able to roam/have as much as an impact that you might have otherwise. That said, the stats mean that you can roam and kill really well and the active is great for kill people that can normally not die to you. This includes blink heroes (QOP/AM) or heroes that can just escape (Slark/Mirana). Morph can escape, Lifestealer can rage, Rubick/Kotl can push you out of cogs...the list goes on. This solves that...BUT AT WHAT COST?  Heart - Gives HP, allows you to tank more things. Good for a 5th/6th item.  Refresher - I'd honestly recommend this over aghs in a very late game scenario. You will die in three hits late game to their carries. You will not have 12 seconds to get another hook off. However, with this, 4 seconds of bkb piercing lockdown may just win you the game. In addition, double hex/bkb/abyssal are very good. Get this if one fight (or one kill, for that matter) will decide you the game.  Abyssal - Only really good if you need the lockdown, and a sheep stick or refresher will give you that.  New Items  I'm putting this in it's own section because I haven't played with any of them yet. All of this is theory.  Mango - I like to get one of these if I'm not going boots. The HP regen is actually super nice in lane, and he can use the burst regen to get cogs/BA off. This has netted me kills (I lied about not using new items, but this is the only one) quite a few times.   Solar Crest - I'm pretty sure this item is strong in general, just not on Clock. Maybe get it if you're going medallion, but would not recommend.  Glimmer Cape - Again, I think this item is strong in general. Invis allows your BA to keep going, huge magic resistance is always good, utility is just insane. Mana cost is a huge downfall though.  Lotus Orb - I actually like this a lot in theory. It's like the rich man's blademail, or the suicidal man's bkb. I think it'll be really good against single target heavy lineups, and just magic teams in general. It's also not stupidly expensive.   Octaine Core - This gives you a 9 sec hook with aghs I believe. All your spells benefit from the CD reduction. This item is best with spell users that have many low-mid cooldown spells, which clocks fit. But, the lifesteal kinda sucks since magic immunity and you don't really care about dying. It's also way too expensive. Do not recommend.  Moon Shard - never get this unless you're 8 slotted, gems/smokes/wards are on CD, and you have three times the amount of gold you need for buy back, and for this. Attack speed is beyond useless for Clock.  Crimson Guard - I'm putting this here because I forgot about it even though I built it 4 hours ago in a game. Get this against PL, it's great. Otherwise, eh.  So, that's that! I didn't even detail all the items I could have (shout out to Pipe/Vanguard/Greaves/Mijollnir/Armlet/Vlads/AC) but it's 5am and I spent an hour to write this.  Quick note on starting items cause I forgot: I usually go Stout, Tangos, Mango. Might get a salve, branches, or a ward depending. The other alternative start could be boots/tangos. Ring of protection can also work.  I'm sure I made tons of mistakes but I'm too tired so if you have any questions on items, or the hero, or anything I will answer them in 7~ hours when I wake up. Hope I helped. Cheers."

TrueDoTA2,37atmr,pastplayer,0,Wed May 27 15:21:34 2015 UTC,I play alot of clock too. I m kind of surprised since what you say is contrary to what i do alot. that being said i dont mind learning. (my MMR hovers around 3.7k)   I usually go phase boots first with into blademail then aghs or orchid most of the time. I like phase boots since you can just waltz up to people who are isolated and then snipe them solo. blademail comes up early since its my second item and i continue to gank until i get my aghs.  That being said i ve noticed i ve lost games despite having very good scores as i fall off once their carries get bkb or if they start travelling together.   I m surprised you didnt mention the one new item i was considering for clock which is the silver edge. Definitely a good pick vs many carries and annoying heroes.   I like bottles but i like to get my phase blademail asap so i dont know where i d fit the farm in for it.   Just a different opinion i guess. Do you have any insight on heroes who can shut down clock in the offlane solo. I ve found Drow and Antimage to be great counters to a solo clock. they have a trilane for the first few waves then drow and antimage basically can handle clock on their own.  good post in any case
TrueDoTA2,37atmr,sheerstress,2,Thu May 28 21:11:09 2015 UTC,"Hey, I don't want to come off as insulting you, so please don't take it that way, but I do disagree with what you do.  I think phase into blademail into aghs is awful. I used to go that when I started, but I really don't think it's good. You get no mana, you have no utility, no hp. The only thing to mitigate damage is the small armor you get from blademail, and that's an item countered by magic immunity. As for your reasoning for phase: I think tranquils does that as well, but at any rate you have a hookshot that isn't a particularly long cooldown. Use that. Most people just walk away if they see you phasing up to them. If they don't, they're just not good.  Silver edge...I think its pretty garbage. That is, what, 5400 gold? Attack speed is bad, damage isn't great. Strength is nice but the sange alone just gives you that. I can't even think of what break would be nice for. Huskar, maybe? It lasts 5 seconds, and it's not like you're a slark who relies on right clicks that might want to disable PA's evasion or something.  That gold can be an aghs, a hex, a force and blink...I think that's extremely wasted.   As for bottle, I would get it after brown boots. Oftentimes if you get zoned out you might only have brown boots + bottle and maybe a stout or something after you hit 6.   Heroes that shut down clock solo? Most melees can't. AM himself is good against melees just because his mana burn and animation is amazing, and his blink ensures he won't die. Any strong laners really. Lina, Qop, Puck, SS, Drow, Viper, SF, Gyro. Plenty of others.  What you're talking about is pretty standard. Supports give the carry farm and exp, so that advantage allows the carry to lane by himself.   Clock ususally does decent against melees simply because he can BA and often times get a kill. His animation is also decent and can tank a lot.  I don't really know what to say. I didn't want to sound mean so sorry if I did, but I'd love to hear your justification on why you play that way, and especially on silver edge. Maybe you see something I don't."
TrueDoTA2,37atmr,pastplayer,0,Thu May 28 21:28:33 2015 UTC,"no worries i dont take it that way. I just saw another clock player with such a vast difference in how to play him. good to have some healthy discussion  I ve gone phase into blademail because i ve been extremely successful with this style. its hard to describe what you do in lane since it depends so heavily on the heroes and if they overextend to zone you. but basically whenever people go to stack or get runes i can just go in for kills with phase boots.   With tranquils i havent tried it much so i guess i cant comment on its effectiveness vs phase. I will say phase also helps last hitting immensely and doesnt force you to stop last hitting to prep for a gank. phase means anytime someone is out of position, you re good to go  i like blademail as a standard since it usually opens up another hero or two you can solo snipe. if i m having a good game i can basically just sit in the jungle and gank constantly until i m out of mana or they group as 5.  My playstyle is basically to make a big gank with my team try to get at least 2 pickoffs farm the jungle with BA until i run out of mana go heal and gank again.  I default to aghs after that but i ve found that its not always that effective since i am so countered by bkb so i ve been loooking for alternatives to aghs as my 3rd main item. i like shivas and sheep of course but the build up is tough and still doesnt necessarily help against bkb heroes.  As for silver edge, i havent actually tried it but since many carries have strong passives this would help your team take down a carry adding some utility. plus having a shadow blade enables another way to get pickoffs without using hook and possibly escapes.  I definitely dont tink it ll be terrible espcially since it has a much easier build up than a hex.  As for forcestaff and bottle, like i said i think a bottle would be great and i ll give it a try but i dont like delaying my blademail.  Forcestaff i ve known to be a good item but i rarely feel like i need it and for the 2k i d rather have a blademail or be on my towards orchid or aghs. The exception would be for a hero such as naix but you dont see naix ever anyways"
TrueDoTA2,37atmr,sheerstress,2,Thu May 28 22:51:07 2015 UTC,"That's cool. I definitely see your justification for phase, and I do think we just play differently. I also understand with not delaying your blademail, that makes a lot of sense.  I do encourage you to pick up a forcestaff though, even after your blademail/aghs. The item is useful just in so many way. Have you ever died within your own cogs? Or needed to save an ally? Or needed to get in better position for a hook/cogs?  I think its a bit less of a selfish item. I really do think it is good, but if you're winning without it then hey, no sense in fixing what isn't broken."
TrueDoTA2,37atmr,pastplayer,2,Thu May 28 23:17:46 2015 UTC,"My clockwerk play and standard items have changed a ton.  Right now, I've had huge success going mid with him. I was inspired when Dendi did it. He went bottle rush, brown boots, urn, then Aghs. It's super solid and you can go items in between as needed. You just have to be really careful with your slots. Notice no mention of wand or stout or blademail or force. These all are good, but you have to watch your slots. Keep in mind things like dust and TPs.  If I'm offlane I go tranquils+soul.   Orchid is always necessary versus mobile escape heroes. Another option is necrobook. Hex is usually more solid than orchid. It just matters what order you get it. Orchid rush at 14 minutes can be a thing, but if you get a blademail or vanguard or something, you should abandon orchid. But orchid solves your mana issues and if I'm going orchid it usually replaces soul ring.  Experiment with blink on Clockwerk. It's better than Aghs half the time and let's you snowball way easier. It also owns people who are positioning well and hiding from hookshots behind creeps. You can kill any hero as long as you have battery assault up.   It also counters clock's biggest weakness: force staves. The problem is it gives no regen, no mana and no survivability or damage. It sounds really bad, but it's one of the best snowball items AND catchup items. I play a lot of sh** support clock when people pick 4 cores after me. Tranq soul into blink is usually my build."
TrueDoTA2,37atmr,wildtarget13,2,Tue May 26 07:16:21 2015 UTC,"I played him recently and went bottle->treads->blademail->aghs, which seemed to work OK.  I ended up having to go mid after the start, but it turns out Clock is a pretty good matchup versus Pudge."
TrueDoTA2,37atmr,-sideshow-,1 point,Tue May 26 14:49:39 2015 UTC,"Like many I use a typical boots->blade->force->aghs core.  I'll skip aghs if I team fights are close in and generally fatal to multiple heroes quickly. I'll get aghs if I'm relatively ahead and they have significant escapes or kiting heroes, or the game is very spread out and gank heavy.  I'll skip blademail if I'm behind (not enough hp to make it relevant).  After the core as past player demonstrates.... it's ALL situational, typically to combined defense/offense items."
TrueDoTA2,37atmr,cantadmittoposting,1 point,Tue May 26 19:44:34 2015 UTC,"Generally speaking, I got Treads + Bottle. That usually comes together at around level 6 which lets you be active and try to snowball. After that, I prioritize Blade Mail and Aghanim's (order depends on what I'm up against). After those two, I look to go Force Staff. I've seen a bit more Tranquils instead of Treads + Bottle, which is fine, but I feel more threatening with my usual choice. An older build I did before the Mek nerf was Arcane boots + Mekansm, but the mana cost is too high. His core set is Aghanim's, Blade Mail and Force Staff.  Late game choices, I would consider Hex, Shiva's, Lotus Orb, Guardian Greaves, Heart or Heaven's Halbred. Orchid sounds good in theory against Storm, but I would hope that you have a teammate that's a better fit pick that item up. With the exception of Force Staff, I like all of Clockwerk's items to make his EHP higher. In the late game, he excels when he can stay alive and be as disruptive as possible."

Like, if you're able to safely lock down the Magnus so he can't RP (and so isn't a threat), you can cluster around him to focus him down so the Clock can't isolate anyone, that sort of thing."

Like for target that surely dead , ask them to do whatever they can to help the remain surviving heroes to trade at very least. Be sure your team is clear about the threat and top priority target so you can easily focus fire at anytime - really old tactic , dunno if work in modern dota."

TrueDoTA2,378ti8,City_of_Orphalese,8,Wed May 27 13:49:02 2015 UTC,The main reason people buy it is because meepo illusions also apply their own instance of geostrike and the extra slow is useful to prevent getting kited

TrueDoTA2,378ti8,Hef34,1 point,Tue May 26 11:43:43 2015 UTC,It's definitely better to get earlier if you need to split push/mega farm for late game.  When sing sing was playing a lot of mid meepo he would go for scythe and manta before skadi if he was playing catch up for the almost guaranteed scythe kill and endless split pushing.  I'm by no means a good meepo player but from watching others skadi first is normally when youre stomping because the build up is so bad. It was the same thing when Medusa was really popular.
TrueDoTA2,378ti8,joesii,1 point,Tue May 26 13:39:07 2015 UTC,"Skadi is just for stats, not it's passive. Scythe has a really long build up because there's a good 3400 gold or something that is useless to Meepo. Once he gets it it's nice though."
TrueDoTA2,378ti8,Ninecent,1 point,Fri May 29 22:56:27 2015 UTC,I want to add that it is a very safe way to scout areas and poof gank people in the enemy jungle and such. You don't waste a whole lot if you fail to come across people.
TrueDoTA2,378ti8,joesii,1 point,Tue May 26 20:57:24 2015 UTC,"The best argument I've heard someone give in favor of Manta Style is that it can be used to scout as well as spot for nearby enemies if you're pushing a lane or hitting a tower. It won't prevent invis heroes from ganking though, so it's not necessarily as good against them.  Any other reason is very minor. They can't really tank significant damage (a good player will know it's an illusion before either attacking it —if it was hit by AoE already— or after just 1 or 2 hits.), and deal terrible damage compared to other heroes (since Meepo illusions deal 1/5th the damage of other hero illusions relative to normal hero's DPS)."
TrueDoTA2,378ti8,owner_of_steam,-1,Sat May 30 00:18:47 2015 UTC,"Why? I don't like it personally either. Maybe it's because I already played 306+ games without it. The DPS is comparable to Ethereal blade in terms of DPS FOR HEROES especially after the buff to geostrike damage assuming they have normal base magic resistance (25%). It's the utility that manta gives, where you can split-push with them, use them as a pseudo ember spirit remanent etc. is what is valued over eblade imo. I never really experimented with Manta but I guess it has some situations where it might be viable."
TrueDoTA2,378b78,wildtarget13,9,Mon May 25 18:24:02 2015 UTC,"Ethereal targets can still attack in Duel and deal damage because Duel, but Ethereal targets are immune to physical damage in Duel so they don't take right-click damage during Duel.  Blink Dagger Ghost Scepter Black King Bar on a jungling Legion Commander can be a niche strat against something like a farmed Sven, Phantom Assassin, or Tiny. You commit your position 4 LC to take the enemy position 1 out of the fight for 5 seconds every time you fight, and Duel goes through magic immunity so even if they buy a BKB, you can still tie them up.  Edit: I tested in a bot match. You cannot use Ghost Scepter while BKB is on, and BKB purges Ghost Scepter's effect. However, LC can be Ethereal Bladed and if LC BKBs and Duels after, the immunity to physical damage during Duel persists."
TrueDoTA2,378b78,pretty_meta,4,Mon May 25 18:39:15 2015 UTC,That seems like a bug but would be really interesting if it works.  You also can't ghost in bkb but you can ethereal blade in it.

Having one mango is great if you're playing super-aggressive with heroes who need mana quick (like Tiny), but three is silly. I think you'd be better off with a stout shield in most situations.  Another issue with your build is the lack of quick heals. People often question only having tangoes and no salve when laning (because it takes too long to regen if you get super low), but mangoes only is even worse."

BKB has a 5 sec duration by late game, and that BKB is pretty much the only way PA can do anything.  Pick Shadow Demon, give him an Agh's, and PA is going to be literally useless 90% of the game (you don't get to crit, you lose your evasion, and you're purged for literally the entire duration of your BKB.)  Pick Rexxar and stun her for 4 sec through her BKB.  Pick Viper and laugh at her as she waddles around with -80% movespeed for the duration of her BKB.  Pick Axe and just call her.  Or just have someone buy Abyssal Blade.  Silver Edge also has a 24 sec cooldown (very, very brief cooldown if you can arrange to not use the backstab until the invis is about to time out), compared to 5 sec BKB's 55 sec - so you can hit her twice in the time it takes for her BKB to recharge.  There's also the issue of items like Heaven's Halberd and, yes, sheeper.  You get hit by Silver Edge and congratulations, you now do approximately less damage than their Crystal Maiden does and lost your primary defensive mechanism.  You can BKB out of this... but the second your BKB ends you're going to get sheeped, disarmed, and generally laughed at by disable spam until your BKB is available again.  You can also Manta Style out of Silver Edge's debuffs, but heroes like Lion are still trending and can easily and instantly eliminate both illusions, and Manta Style won't do anything to protect you from regular disables, sheeper, Heaven's Halberd, etc.  Silver Edge is extremely strong against PA because, combined with a competent draft, it can easily force into a ""you're fucked no matter what you do"" situation.

There will be games where other item choices and combinations will be better (you might need to get Diffusal Blade with that gold, or you might be able to setup multi-hero cleaves and Battle Fury would be great, etc.)  But standard does mean ""this is the most efficient choice for a majority of situations.""  PA cannot afford to let games go late, not with Silver Edge in the game (while I think the item is overpriced it can still easily force PA into a no-win situation late game.)  You need to win early, or at least have a commanding lead so that by time they can get that combination of things like Silver Edge, sheeper, Halberd, etc to force you into those no-win situations, your team's so far ahead of them on XP and farm that it doesn't make enough of a difference.

I don't see any game where it's worth it to be a part of your 6 items unless you're against an omniknight.  The stats from diff blade are mediocre for PA because she doesn't use agility all that well for an agi hero.  Mana burn isn't great because you shouldn't really have to attack your target more than a few times.  Purge is good for ghost scepters but you already have a slow and a blink to chase and there's other better options if sticking to a target is an issue (Basher/Skadi/SnY/Casual OoV).  Defensively purging off silences isn't all that valuable to her either.
TrueDoTA2,3771rx,Dirst,1 point,Mon May 25 14:54:26 2015 UTC,"If fighting is what you want to do, I think it's great. Same with Medallion/Crest on PA.

Manta Style to follow, maybe getting BKB first if necessary.  After that... either IAS (probably Moonstone), tank up (Heart), or build to counter enemy heroes (usually means something like MKB.)  Only reason I'd deviate from Vlad's-Deso is if I require a different item early on (such as Diffusal Blade against a Warlock or Omniknight), my team is setup to make hero cleaves easy (Magnus, Enigma, Dark Seer, Axe, etc), or things like that.  Vlad's-Deso is unquestionably the most cost efficient item build for PA right now, and with Silver Edge in the game, she really can't afford to let the game go late (90% of why you get Manta Style at all is to give you an extra option for dealing with the eventual Silver Edge.)  You can have a teammate get Vlad's if that's convenient for everyone.  If they do that, I like to finish Aquila and spend the leftover gold on a Drum for the extra stats (get Phase Boots in this case since you probably won't need the STR on demand from treads.)"

TrueDoTA2,3771rx,vraGG_,-1,Mon May 25 14:36:11 2015 UTC,"Thing is, your natural item progression includes Abyssal, BKB and Satanic. Coupled with another DPS/Farming item from midgame (ie. battle fury/manta), that alone gives enough DPS.  PA is not the strongest of ultra late carries (but I won't elaborate on that). Her issue becomes being controled - when supports save enough for that ghost scepter and force staff, hexes come online etc.  At that point of the game, it doesn't matter if you can output 100 more DPS, or if you have 500 more health - what matters is if you can kill people before they can escape (= positioning and lockdown) and your own mobility (= BKBs/blinks/range). Now PA is not a ranged hero, so she naturally has to come close to the enemy to deal damage.  In order to do so efficiently, you NEED to have that BKB. It doesn't matter if you have a rapier, if enemy lion has hex, that is basically where I am coming from. If you can kill that threat before he can cast anything (BKB and/or Abyssal used here), that is what you should do. Issue is, it only has ""one charge"". Refresher enables you to do that again.  I hope I explained this decenlty, I tried to stay on plot."
TrueDoTA2,3771rx,l_HATE_TRAINS,1 point,Mon May 25 15:58:56 2015 UTC,PA isn't a caster. She doen't lack spells. All she needs is to be able to right click and make that right click stronger and faster. Of course you can go for some utility or some situationally needed items but that's about it.

TrueDoTA2,377itd,cloudy100,1 point,Tue May 26 00:07:13 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying the hero didn't kill them im saying the way it is worded in the wiki it can be interpreted as only dmg from the owners own skills and not from his items, and this isn't far fetched as we are talking about a system that handles game logic. I'm pretty sure Valve didn't instill DOTA with an intrinsic knowledge of the concept of ""guns dont kill people. people kill people"". Fact of the matter is that we don't know how the game is coded. Without that knowledge one cannot state with any certainty that    Heals from any damage the owner does which does not come from its attacks.   includes items. One also cannot state with certainty that it does not, and this is why i asked and also why i can't accept your explanation of the game logic because it is based on how it works in real life and the cause and effect within real life.   Now with that said i was definitely wrong and you were right just not for the reasons you stated in your post.  The thread you referred to does indeed mention that items do lifesteal, I have no reason to think that someone would make this up and then not be proven wrong by another redditor so i will take it as proof. It is to my purposes good enough.  I think we can agree that the wording is piss poor and far from unambiguous, the main culprit being the word ""spell"" which has no definition in Dota, e.g. hero ""spells"" are not spells they are abilities, item ""spells"" are not spells they are ""item actives"" or ""item passives"" of course when we humans talk about spells there is usually context to indicate what you really mean so that the listener can construe what you really mean.   As you can see from the thread no one really knew what you could lifesteal from until someone actually tried it and witnessed it with their own eyes.   I will edit the wiki article and clarify with the extra information from the excellent thread you linked to. Thanks for bearing with me :)"

Otherwise you can just pick a hero more suited to being the hardcarry and put BB on the offlane, where he has a relatively good time as well.  And just think about the stuff you'll wanna get. Basic armor is a must-have, in some situations also magic resistance, and some HP. Then you wanna go for Radi? That's pretty late already.  Edit, to answer the main question: Yes, it is viable. But not as a first item, it would be a rather late thing to get, helping you to heal up and deal some additional damage after you got core. Yes, I think that Radiance is actually good if gotten late in this case."
TrueDoTA2,377itd,pepe_le_shoe,2,Mon May 25 15:57:42 2015 UTC,"""...situationally strong."" You can say the same of MANY items.

TrueDoTA2,377itd,Dirst,2,Mon May 25 15:54:09 2015 UTC,"If you want a straight damage item, basher is better. It's cheap, as carry items go, and it synergizes with the as you get from warpath.   If you want to build radiance + oct, you need a 4 prot 1 draft, in which case there are much better carry options.  You talk about bristle not dying, but the reason for that is because he buys tank items, early, and never stops.

TrueDoTA2,373udb,UrbanCommando63,21,Sun May 24 17:30:58 2015 UTC,Because Oracle is hard. Most broken hero in dota actually but one of the hardest to play.  Literally the lowest pub winrate.  He's more like a theory-crafter's wet dream instead of playable hero.
TrueDoTA2,373udb,ItsDominare,8,Sun May 24 17:44:24 2015 UTC,"Because Oracle is hard.   It isn't even that he's hard so much as it is that people are lazy. I'm no Dota savant, but I decided to put the time in with Oracle when he was released and it only took me about 20-30 matches to feel like I had a solid grasp of the hero. Also yeah he's crazy good, perhaps not quite as broken since the ult nerf but still very strong."
TrueDoTA2,373udb,Alieksiei,6,Sun May 24 18:06:28 2015 UTC,He's actually stronger at extremely high level play now because of the removal of cc and the other buffs.. But in pubs the 6.83 Oracle was stronger because people aren't as good with detection allowing them to be raped by invisible carries.  I'm not good with him but I don't get my teammates killed. These are my stats with him: http://www.dotabuff.com/players/263450824/matches?date=&hero=oracle&skill_bracket=&lobby_type=&game_mode=&region=&faction=&duration=&enjoyment=any
TrueDoTA2,373udb,Alieksiei,6,Sun May 24 18:09:22 2015 UTC,"His winrate on very high skill went down come 6.84 tho.   His ulti became a lot stronger in a way, but lost on so many other aspects. The increased cooldown means you can't use it after a disengage to fully heal your carrier, the lack of invis means you cant use it to start ganks, nor to let your allies start ganks, and so on.  He has a crazy niche right now, but he needs to support the right cores for that to work. Having an oracle supporting a bristleback makes as much sense as having a wisp supporting an anti-mage."
TrueDoTA2,373udb,lolfail9001,2,Sun May 24 23:34:41 2015 UTC,Well Oracle has one of the highest skill ceilings and floor in the game - that's why I said extremely high level play (as in the pro scene) instead of saying the bracket of very high skill.
TrueDoTA2,373udb,Alieksiei,1 point,Mon May 25 05:18:47 2015 UTC,"The team with Oracle has a high risk of being overwhelmed, since as a support his laning phase, to put it bluntly, sucks. He can be compared to an omni in that regard, though omni can find some levels and gold by farming the jungle a bit when the game slows down. Oracle is a lot better at zoning a solo offlane hero, though.   But neither of those can gank too much - Fortune's end can work but it's a bad spell to initiate with, especially now that his ulti doesn't grant invis anymore. Fate's edict rely a lot on synergy with your team, so it's very situational.   Overall, his ulti is definitely stronger in that one niche - However, the hero itself doesn't do as much as it's usually claimed. In fact, with the cooldown and versatility nerf to his ulti, he does even less than before the patch."

Basically, you stick False Promise on someone and they are completely unstoppable until it ends.  I'm a big fan of Oracle+Omniknight drafts.  Pick a couple of heroes BKB-reliant heroes like PA, Luna, Sven, etc and then one more hero to fill out the team and start 5 manning early and just never stop.  It's so incredibly hard to deal with - Oracle and Omniknight produce a lot of healing potential, you can't kill Oracle while Omni's alive, you can't kill Omni while Oracle's alive, and even if you get a Diffusal Blade to stop shenanigans with Repel, they'll just use False Promise instead.  Give Omniknight a pair of Guardian Greaves so he can remove silences from himself and it's just gruesome."

TrueDoTA2,373udb,Thalnagath,0,Sun May 24 21:27:07 2015 UTC,The general consensus is that it's a huge boost. Good players already had detection (gem etc) for the old version anyway.
TrueDoTA2,373udb,DeepBurner,2,Mon May 25 14:29:11 2015 UTC,"It was the 20 second cooldown at level 1 that made it OP, the invisibility was gravy. I know the general consensus is that overall its a buff, but that's constituted of a majority of theorycrafters that don't actually play the hero. I do, and I think the ult is definitely better lategame in exchange for being much, much worse early - something that was needed because Oracle was pretty broken. Getting that shit off twice in one fight at the 15m mark was common, and now it isn't possible.. and don't forget the duration also got nerfed.

TrueDoTA2,373udb,Thalnagath,1 point,Mon May 25 22:28:24 2015 UTC,How can I go on learning him? He seems like a really fun hero but I played him only once so far and had no impact at all D:
TrueDoTA2,373udb,Drop_,2,Sun May 24 18:58:04 2015 UTC,"Do a few bot matches first. Go mid. Oracle is a decent mid, you probably shouldn't play him mid in pubs but for bot matches it is fine. Get a feel for his spells first. Your build should generally be Boots -> Urn/Medallion -> Eul's -> Blink/Glimmer/Dagon (Only if you are doing super well)/Force/Ghost.  Remember some combos.   E -> Q -> E is a classic one. Does about 1k magic damage to the enemy. Learn to pull it off.   E -> Eul's -> Q -> E is the much easier to pull off combo. I do this one against enemies that are mobile.   E -> Q -> E -> Eul's -> E is the obvious continuation.  W -> E to heal. You can get 2 flames for level 1 heal theoretically now though I don't know if you can manage with the cast times.  Use your W as much as possible and this spell is probably the hardest spell to use as Oracle and you will need a lot of practice on this. This is what the bot matches is gonna teach you. You need a general understanding of the damage types that heroes have. For example, don't W when you are killing someone when you have a Zeus. Always W if you have a PA however. This is where the hero is super complicated cause not every hero has damage that is 100% blocked or 100% amped. Slark for example has more magic damage at low levels than physical damage. Only W after Slark has done his magic burst. There are some that I don't think we'll ever know which is better like with Void. In early game, Void does more magic damage than physical. So, is it better to give 50% pure damage on his physical portion or leave the enemy not edicted?  Promise is a pretty simple spell to use now. Try to save it for when someone is about to die and then promise them. Generally you can give them one flame or two if you think it's possible to save him. Don't bother with the W since you don't want to disarm your carry when he is unkillable unless there is nobody to save.  Remeber your Q purges. Just pick Oracle against Omni. Easiest game of your life. Your Q even purges repel however you can't target someone repeled. Just remember that."
TrueDoTA2,373udb,heartoftheforce,2,Sun May 24 19:20:12 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind that False Promise can be used proactively as well as reactively.  It continually hits the target with a strong dispel throughout the duration so you can easily give Sven a False Promise as he runs/blinks in and he won't even need to BKB because anything that hits him is just going to get purged off anyway.  False Promise is actually quite difficult to save someone with, since the total healing is dealt before the total damage is dealt.  So even if you heal someone for 1500 damage after the modifier, and they get hit with 2000 after the effect ends, they're still going to die - the healing is almost completely irrelevant unless they were already basically dead and you fully healed them and the damage they'll take will be less than their maximum HP.   Your Q even purges repel however you can't target someone repeled. Just remember that.   Bunch of BS if you ask me :P"

TrueDoTA2,373udb,EDJE,6,Sun May 24 20:20:41 2015 UTC,"Because it's pretty gimmicky, and Dazzle and Oracle don't have very much control between the two of them.  You'd have to get cores that have disables, etc."

It does bring a lot of utility and defensive abilities, but with a support duo you generally like to have at least one reliable stun. I dont really count oracle's Q as a reliable stun given the channel time for it, but being 2.5 seconds at level 1 is no bullshit either"
TrueDoTA2,373udb,ItsDominare,2,Sun May 24 17:46:38 2015 UTC,Run Oracle solo offlane or mid so he can farm Eul's. You can channel your Q on a cycloned target. Get another disabling support to pair with Dazzle.

TrueDoTA2,373udb,ffn,2,Sun May 24 18:00:24 2015 UTC,Oracle's q is not even a root or stun - it just changes their movement speed to 0 until the duration is over.   The amount of healing combined with Oracle's ult should allow allies to tank MASSIVE amounts of damage.
TrueDoTA2,373udb,sprkng,0,Sun May 24 17:58:50 2015 UTC,"You'd get the disables from other picks.  A favorite sample draft for me would be Omniknight solo off, Lina/Necro/Lesh mid, Sven/Luna/Leoric safelane (all three have a stun; Luna's has short duration but short cd and huge range, and 0.6 sec is still long enough to setup LSA or Split Earf), Crystal Maiden or Sand King safelane/jungle, and Oracle dedicated safelane support.  Everyone on your team is extremely hard to kill, you have plenty of damage potential between your safelane right-click and your mid lane spell-carry (and that damage is fairly evenly split between magic and physical, meaning a Pipe doesn't instantly neuter your team's damage), and with the suggested mids, suggested safelanes, and either of the two suggested jungles, you also have a decent selection of disables and can purchase more (Eul's is a common and effective item on any of those mids as well as Oracle.)"

There's a little more to it of course, but if you're looking for the answer in a nutshell, you can't really do better than this.  Another example of that kind of support pair is Abaddon and Omniknight - absolutely incredible defensive power and utility between the two of them, but you don't see it done because they're both melee and they don't have proper CC so they can't really gank."

Both sound mediocre to what is available.   Sheep is still good. Manta is still pretty great. Skadi is great. Eblade is great. Your 6 slot Meepo is going to be something like Blink/Ags/Boots/Choice 1/Choice 2/Choice 3. If you want to disable some passives, I think Silver Edge could be legit on Meepo.

But in situations where you need to lock someone down for an easy pick I think blink sheep is a lot better. Or in situations where there is an enemy QOP or AM or similar I think you have to go sheep...
TrueDoTA2,374wsl,owner_of_steam,1 point,Sun May 24 23:11:58 2015 UTC,"Okay so I have experience with meepo and I've been in those shoes before (excuse that Divine build, I just wanna boost my Divine Rapier winrate))  Honestly, I won't be closed minded and say no, I'll give you something to think about, because there are some times when it's viable. Health points, if you think about it... == more DPS (unless you're disabled) because the longer you live, the more DPS you can dish. When I first started playing meepo thats how I thought. You already do considerably above-average DPS without damage/stat items and I thought it went pretty well--for most of my experiences (in the normal skill bracket AND in ~2011). People got smarter and I coudlnt just get away with just tanking every single hit, I died eventually and was properly perma-stunned. However, say if you get a reaver, they just can't kill you because you're too tanky. That's a different story.  Nowadays, I never build reavers... it's probably because   Skadi is more all around I like DPS better than being tanky   My play-style with Meepo consists of flash farming and getting one-sided pick-offs then taking advantage of 4v5s. I always want to kill them as fast as possible to limit the chances of escape and/or backup to arrive. While looking for these pickoffs, I farm my ass off. Reavers do not help either of these. It doesn't help you farm faster nor does it help my ganking. Reavers are for teamfights... something I try to discourage.  Expanding: I'll ask you why do you build sheep-stick? For me, it's for pickoffs PRIMARILY. Theres this time of the game when you get your blink and aghanims, and you can basically kill people in a matter of seconds. Then, they start getting, Bkbs or whatever defensive items. Thats when you have your sheepstick. The Aghs>Blink>Sheep build just works so well for me. Going Aghs>Blink>Heart just gives me unnecessary benefits that I dont usually need.  It's up to you mostly and the playstyle you wanna develop. Experiment. I say you try building skadis instead and see how it feels for 15 games. Then try eblades. Part of the fun of learning meepo is experiment with the situational items."

TrueDoTA2,373lg7,genetalgiant,12,Sun May 24 18:59:11 2015 UTC,I disagree with the part where you say that winning the lane does not matter as much as it used to. It matters way more than it did in 6.83. The thing with Pudge however is that he doesn't need to win his lane. He just needs levels.
TrueDoTA2,373lg7,wickedmike,2,Sun May 24 20:47:44 2015 UTC,"Yeh that is what I meant. You can sit in lane with Pudge, soak XP, get 5 cs compared to your opponents 25 cs and still get way ahead of him with just a few kills from other lanes.  I feel like winning ""a"" lane is important in 6.84, putting a hero so far ahead that he can't be dealt with in midgame, but not necessarily winning lanes. You can lose 2 of the 3 lanes, deathball and win the game rather easily depending on your lineup."
TrueDoTA2,373lg7,genetalgiant,1 point,Mon May 25 14:00:28 2015 UTC,Flesh heap also allows pudge to snowball really effectively.
TrueDoTA2,373lg7,captainburnz,2,Sun May 24 21:51:18 2015 UTC,IMO winning the lane is one of the most important things this patch. It's just that Pudge isn't that farm dependent so if he's losing he can leave lane more readily than the majority of mids.

Before as a carry it was a lot more efficient to stay in lane or just generally farming more than it was to join fights. Unless you were able to get multiple last hits in a fight or your team absolutely needed you it would be better to farm especially as an AM, Naga, Dusa or Tiny and then just join up with your team after a fight for an objective like Roshan or a tower. This was mostly because of abysmal AOE gold make joining fights a huge struggle of opportunity cost. Now with 6.84 its almost always a better idea to group with the team and fight. Even if you don't get the kill the AOE is still fairly substantial."

She doesn't need a farm-accelerating item to kill heroes at all.   I am almost invariant in what I do build; basilius (sometimes into acquila), brown boots, Hotd, phase, basher. I VERY rarely deviate from that,because after a fucking ton of PA games that is how you kill people. 24 damage from phase, 20 damage from hotd, 25 from bash (+60 per proc). This is how you kill people, not pissing gold away on bfury regen and cleave.  Here is my past 3 PA games.  This one, 4 stack, only PL wasn't with us. The two supports dispruptor and kotl are both ~1500 mmr lower than the Invoker and myself. Played 3 days ago, and SNY was the only odd item choice. Poor GPM here, a lot of 5v5 posturing and waiting around, was a long-ass game. You can see the upgrades for basher and hotd, these are partly why they're so good. Cheap early kill-items that have beastly upgrades.  This one, first of two today was myself + a 4 stack vs a 5 stack. Same old stuff in the item build, basi > acquila (obviously sold earlier), basher, hotd and both their upgrades, then the mkb was luxury and I stole the rapier. Same style, farm these cheap early items and go KILL people. Teleport into fights, pick any enemy support and end his life. Kills are so important in 6.84, gold and xp is insane in fights, much more than the recently-nerfed creeps give.  And, if you're not entirely bored of this yet... This one. Again solo queue, same shit. Lane with a support, buy phase basi hotd basher and go kill people. Moonshard because it's stupidly good and I wanted some attack speed for more lifesteal against the pesky SB. Upgrade basher first because the active is pretty much a 100% solo kill on any squishy and they can't do a goddamn thing about it.  Conclusion - PA is excellent in this patch. Less emphasis on farm, more on getting results. Killing and pushing an objective, rinse and repeat. PA has everything for this. Easy damage, easy builds, and even the crazy stuff like built in evasion early/mid when no-one has MKBs. She's in my top 3 most succesful heroes, and I have her arcana because it's fucking sexy. Love this hero, and I love being called a retard when you rock two crits and melt a 2500 hp carry. It takes a lot of practise to understand when and how you can contribute early on with PA, but when you get used to it she's an amazingly fun hero to play, even in a magic-oriented patch like this one."

If you can get a lot of farm through laning and jungle and outfarm your opponents, you can still win easily in most cases. The problem is that heroes who need supporting and time to come online (let say medusa or am) are in a big disatvantage compared to heroes who can farm and kill at the same time because of the new aoe gold distribution. As a gyro, you can solo kill and get a lot of gold through that kill, but as medusa or am you gonna need a support and even if you kill an important target you get much less gold than compared to solo, because the most gold will go to the assits (or helpers) in your kills. In games, a solo gyro with 15 less cs than a freefarm medusa, both having 2 kills on their own, the gyro will have a little bit more networth because he got his kills solo (because he can) contrary to the medusa.   There was a game I played with a close friend of mine and he wanted to try something with wisp, so i picked slark and we went aggresively vs their trilane (ck, cm and veng), so i did fb and double kill, then at around min 5 I was already 6-0 but my networth was only a little bit higher than the enemy mid even though we had the same cs, and he was only 1-0 - why? Because most of the gold from all those kills went to the wisp, so the graph in networth looked like this: 1 was me, 30 cs, 6-0, 2 was enemy mid, 30cs, 1-0 and 3rd was the wisp, 0-1-6, 2 cs, 4rd our safelane, 35 cs, 1-0.  Solo kills are just worth insanely lot and the gold you can get from assists as a poor support can be insanely high, this doesnt mean farming is dead, it just opens a new way to play and new calculations to make in the game. Sometimes, it may be worth to teleport to ult and kill a supp on the enemy team as a spectre and tp to base, and no matter how much gold you think you may lose because you are not farming in that time you can get more gold from that kill alone cos its a solo kill, as compared to kills in lane where you gonna have other people involved."

TrueDoTA2,36zl61,Snoop_doge1,1 point,Mon May 25 21:22:24 2015 UTC,"I recently switched from playing offlane/supports to more carries and definitely this patch is hard on carries.  In 6.83 even when my team was doing shit I could solo win games when I had enough farm.  In 6.84 I often already have terrible lanes and even when I have 2 supports they end up feeding a undying dual lane, and therefore makes my life miserable, or I get no support at all with one useless jungler.  And in this patch, if you get no early farm it's really hard to comeback, it's not that bad a thing I mean 6.83 was a terrible patch for supports, they often had no impact on who won the game, it was all about who had the greediest lineup (or troll/sniper).  So like everyone else I tried gyro, and he's really good in lane, making it way easier to farm, and then snowball.  When I see a stupid in my team insta portrait to the jungle I often pick a carry that can solo, like QoP, which I had good success on.  To me this patch is all about the mid lane. A good midder can solo win a game way more than a carry in this patch."

TrueDoTA2,36zl61,tomatomater,1 point,Tue May 26 09:43:15 2015 UTC,"Yes, this patch is pretty midgame oriented. specifically, gank oriented. however, lategame carries are made stronger again (like TI2 era patch) so the meta i've observed is to try to participate in clashes despite being a farming hero.  One of the safest and most effective strategies I've come across are having a primary and secondary carry. The primary one joins with his team in ganking squads, getting most of his farm from kills, whereas the secondary one solo farm while pushing a lane and has to be able to escape well."
TrueDoTA2,36zl61,brinebold,1 point,Sat May 23 15:43:55 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's necessarily gank oriented. I think the meta is actually going to be early to midgame teamfight.  Teamfight is the counter to both gank and farm lineups in this patch. You prevent pickoffs vs gank and snowball vs farm. Rat DOTA with NP and Brood could see a comeback as the counter to teamfight again though, trading towers evens up vision and makes the snowball a lot less effective as long as your team doesn't try to defend while at a disadvantage.  I predict lots and lots of smokes being bought in this year's TI."
TrueDoTA2,36zl61,SeeImSane,1 point,Sat May 23 18:21:29 2015 UTC,you say that it isn't gank oriented but rather teamfight and then you proceed to blur the line between the two.

This may or may not line up with everyone else's definition though.  Full teams teamfight whether the opposing team participates fully or not. IMO a 5v2 is still a teamfight, just a really bad one from one side.  A couple of heroes roam around and gank."
TrueDoTA2,36zl61,SeeImSane,1 point,Mon May 25 16:47:05 2015 UTC,"Can you use 5man or deathball instead of teamfight, as teamfight doesn't sound like a strategy. It's a thing that happens when you fight 5v5.  Imo you can push, turtle or gank (aggressive, defensive or greedy). And all of this you can do solo, in small squads or as whole team.  So teamfight doesn't counter gank, turtle does. And teamfight doesn't counter farm(turtle), push does.  But you can mix those ""strats"", turtle with four while Furion split-pushes the lanes. Gank duo while the rest pushes. And so on..."

Of course, this is dependant on you being able to get lh in lanes a little bit, so if you can't lh well (>50lh min in lane) it won't work as smoothly, but try this build out sometime. Skill build is you usually skip mystic snake, and focus on stats and splitshot, getting mana shield when you want to fight. Start with wraith band and tangoes, make an aquilla in lane, then get treads, then mask of madness (sometimes stopping for a wand). After you get MOM just farm jungle, try to get the lane creeps if they're in a good space, but just farm all 5 jungle camps each min, next items are yasha and maelstrom to increase your farm even more. You should easily be getting more than 10cs/min at this point, and if you can't than this build won't work. Once you have those items keep farming, ideally to skadi, butterfly and mjollnir. The idea is you let your team fight 4v5, then come out 6 slotted at 35 minutes. You can't abandon all fights of course, but that's what playing carry is, choosing when to go to fights. I've been consistently getting >750 gpm with this build, and usually my team can hold their own while I farm, they'll lose some fights, but not anything that I can't bring back.   This can also work with luna if you want to try, the build is to skip lucent beam, max aura and glaives, get a hotd, farm all 5 jungle camps each min while stacking ancients with dominated creep, then get manta, farm ancients, then butterfly, satanic and likely bkb if you need it. You can probably farm even faster with that build and can join your team earlier if you predict early pressure from the enemy.  Here are some example matches I did with both builds.  Medusa: http://www.dotabuff.com/matches/1491853156  Luna:http://www.dotabuff.com/matches/1405776966  If you just focus on farming you can usually double or triple the last hits of any enemy or allied hero, and if you get to do that the game is basically won.  Edit: this works a little better on dire because the jungle is faster to farm. Also once you get your items you want to rosh then break base, and that's also easier to secure on dire."
TrueDoTA2,36zxca,Abismos,1 point,Sat May 23 19:52:16 2015 UTC,"Really thank you for your answer, I'll have a try with both Medusa and Luna, then.

TrueDoTA2,36zxca,Abismos,1 point,Sat May 23 20:45:47 2015 UTC,"I haven't tried it mid before, but it could work depending on the way the game goes. The thing is these builds are great in a passive game, but you can be useless if you don't get space to farm. The advantage of mid is that it' 1v1, so you won't be in a 2v2 with a useless support if you're unlucky. I think luna might work better, because with a few levels you can play it like shadow fiend, quickly push out the lane and then farm a few jungle camps in time for the next wave. I think it could work in static mid matchups, but you'll probably never get solo kills unless your opponent makes a big mistake, since you're skipping your 2 best laning abilities, beam and snake. Another thing is that if you go mid, you might also have a farming carry, so there might not be enough farm for the two of you; it really just depends on the game."

TrueDoTA2,36zxca,FusionX,1 point,Sun May 24 16:21:05 2015 UTC,I play mid Medusa and max mystic snake. Once you get 2/3 points in it spam it such that you'll get the ranged creep and the enemy mid. That should restore most of your mana. This should win your midlane and create space for you to farm. The play style and item build is the same as above although I like to get linkens/bloodstone after MoM and try to help my team with stone gaze when I can (you can't win solo if they end before you get your items). I then get a mkb - skadi - rapier. I get a rapier when I'm not dying in teamfight (usually when I get skadi) but lack the damage to win those fights completely.
TrueDoTA2,36zxca,kpub51,1 point,Mon May 25 06:15:22 2015 UTC,"Luna is great I've got my best farming records on dotabuff with her.  The thing is her skills are weird.  Obviously you want the nuke as quickly as possible because her ultimate is worthless with low levels in beams, but you are a carry and want farm.  I've always done the nukes first build, because aura doesn't scale amazing, and you push lanes really early with the glaives.    Edit: oh yeah she is incredibly squishy to nukes.  Like she isn't TB bad but she is a fairly weak laner so idk about 2.5k solo queue, it'll be hit and miss for sure with supports.

Timing matters because the later the game goes, less towers you have, specially in a meta that rewards early game fighting and pushing. Naga can comeback in a losing game, but it's much harder if you lost a few T2s or T1 mid and safe lane. Sure you can farm from inside the base, but you'll be XP starved and they'll just shove the waves again easy to kill illusions. Wombo combo is not relevant here because Naga will be farming in the first 25 minutes Radiance and BoTs and, if possible, no fight at all. Change in gold mechanics, Radiance cost and meta made Naga weaker. If you can get away with it, she's stronger, of course, and that's not because of Radiance, it's because of Octarine Core."

And once again, in uncontested farm, the only thing radiance and creep gold changes did is delay radiance timing from ~15th to ~18th minute, significant but not deadly against line-up that can't get high ground or full map control in this time period and even in this meta there are not many line-ups capable of that (even though there are plenty of deathballs incoming i betcha)   that's not because of Radiance.

TrueDoTA2,36z1jp,TerminatorXPS15,1 point,Sat May 23 14:02:56 2015 UTC,"Octarine core is pretty situational. If you can delay the game and you know it'll be moving towards a super late game, you can grab it after Manta.      However, a major strength of Naga is already her farming rate, and it isn't overly necessary to boost it. The changes to diffusal were massive, and allow you to get both a diffusal and a Skadi. This is brutal to try and support against. A single Naga illusion with a miss chance, mana burn, and move/attack speed slow is so difficult to play against.       We've also seen a huge shift towards heros like KotL, Zeus, Shadow Demon, Dazzle, and Witch Doctor. Each of these heroes are super squishy, deal abysmal right click damage, and will be forced to use a spell on Illusions rather than heroes. In a team fight sending a Skadi/Diffusal illusion or two to attack supports can essentially win the team fight. They can't run, they can't fight and it's already putting them in a difficult position.     In theory, Octarine Core is a good item, but even with a better song CD and longer Illusion up time it doesn't directly boost your fighting power. This means you have to be absolutely sure you can make it to the late game, in order for the gamble to pay off. I still think the average Brownboots - Aquila - Radiance - BoTs - Manta - Skadi/ Diffusal - Skadi/Diffusal (get one before the other depending on the game) and then moving into Heart/Butterfly/Sheep/AC/Whatever the game needs.      These are just my thoughts, I've played Octarine Core only a few times so I could be wrong, but in my experience both in Ranked and Unranked players still have a really difficult time dealing with multiple heroes being pressured by Illusions."

When you pick support huskar , there is no place for jungle since your presence in lane is not that strong and while going on offense you still prone to death.  Combo :  concept - empower your magic output. Accomplish the initiation you provide ; burst.  Second Support Combo:   SWM - disgusting! Venge Shadow Demon Bane Mirana Veno Lion CM rubick AA rashta disruptor   P1 combo , abuse to full potential.   PL pugna Luna Jug DR Sniper Bloodseeker Slardar Brew WK Naix Alchemist   generic combo.  concept - you will eventually cast your ult   IO WD NEcro Omni     Like night stalker , you will get URN as your first item , since your are not providing much wards and smoke is always your responsibility. And then , mek is probably your top priority. Your initiation is very dangerous one against blinker. So if you planning to play him as support be sure you pick him last. Skillbuild , you maybe abandon your E. Note the change to Inner Vitality - it now based on main attribute and be twice efficient when go below 40% hp , thats why I say you will go full offensive with support huskar. And your P1 must have sick stat gain or stat item spammer (dr , pl , naix immediately get into my list).  Glimmer Cape + Agh is probably for your super late game , for the abuse. And then your only enemy is vision and responsive ally."
TrueDoTA2,36xtnh,spacedog41,12,Sat May 23 00:36:22 2015 UTC,He's always been good.  It's he has mana problems so no one picks him.  Which is stupid.  If you can get a CM or kotl on hid team he destroys.   Now with mango he might be picked more.
TrueDoTA2,36xtnh,Zdfl,9,Sat May 23 01:10:58 2015 UTC,"I think his biggest problem is not mana, its the really long cooldown of the ult. The downtime is so long that if you use it and dont accomplish much enemy can punish you heavily"
TrueDoTA2,36xtnh,tiradium,1 point,Sat May 23 04:55:14 2015 UTC,"The illusions do 100% of your damage + the crit chance. One CK game I was totslly carrying my team, steamrolling them. I could imagine enemy pudge's feelings when I use Realityn rift and then 7 Chaos Knights surround and bodyblock him, every single one crits about 900. Before I considered Chaos Knight to be garbage but then I changed my mind. With enough illusions, you will have a ring of Chaos Knights that block enemy from moving, bodyblocking, as I explained above. It was cool."
TrueDoTA2,36xtnh,Sakkeus_II,7,Sat May 23 08:21:22 2015 UTC,"While what you're saying isn't wrong, it isn't countering /u/tiradium 's argument. Yes, his ult is VERY powerful, but it has a very long cooldown, and even though they are strong illusions, they're still illusions. A lion can kill one every few seconds with mana drain, Medusa clears all your illus with her ult, same with LC's Overwhelming odds.   It isn't bad, but it is counterable and has a long CD. If they can manage to juke you as soon as your ult is popped, you better hope you are standing near an objective they HAVE to defend, either they will just disengage or sack that t1 tower you're close to."
TrueDoTA2,36xtnh,MestHoop,2,Sat May 23 13:57:36 2015 UTC,In dota being countered happens. It would be like me saying that Medusa isnt good because Antimage or Lion can drain her mana. The point is that some heroes are direct counters to others. CK seems to oblitorate people without AoE.
TrueDoTA2,36xtnh,Snoop_doge1,-6,Sun May 24 10:29:58 2015 UTC,"Downvoted for being correct.  Sigh, Reddit."
TrueDoTA2,36xtnh,Thalnagath,1 point,Sun May 24 14:03:23 2015 UTC,"Agree 100%. Had to get Refresher on CK before, because after the teamfight the illusions were down and we couldnt push fast enough vs buybacks + survived stragglers"
TrueDoTA2,36xtnh,LemonRaven,-3,Sat May 23 22:59:02 2015 UTC,"A lion can kill one every few seconds with mana drain, Medusa clears all your illus with her ult, same with LC's Overwhelming odds.   Lion will die instantly to CK illusions.  Just walk up and Reality Rift him.  Dusa will counter your illusions, yes.  So either don't pick CK into her, or force the Stone Gaze and ult afterwards.  LC can hurt them bad with her Q, but you can also just instagib LC with Reality Rift, too.   If they can manage to juke you   You've gotta be really bad at CK to get juked, especially if you have illusions out."
TrueDoTA2,36xtnh,Thalnagath,1 point,Sun May 24 14:02:54 2015 UTC,"I think you're missing the point I was making: It is a very strong ult, but it is as strong as it is because there are numerous ways of countering it.   You've gotta be really bad at CK to get juked, especially if you have illusions out.   Aside from this comment going against the purpose of this sub, it is also incredibly ignorant. Both CK's abilities have a decent cast animation and are cancelled if CK loses line of sight. Any experienced player will try to juke into forests or up cliffs to prevent the CK from getting that reality rift off. Even if you stun first, manage to get it off, there's a chance you never manage to get a RR off if they juke well and the stun timer rolls a low value."
TrueDoTA2,36xtnh,MestHoop,2,Sun May 24 15:53:34 2015 UTC,"Yes, and this is compensated by CK having one of the fastest move speeds in the game and illusions providing vision.  All you have to do is split your illusions to cover multiple paths and they aren't going to be able to fog you."
TrueDoTA2,36xtnh,Thalnagath,2,Sun May 24 16:38:13 2015 UTC,"The thing is that he fucking sucks at getting farm, so unless you're getting kills after kills, you're not going to be effective later on in the game. And when people see a CK and a CM on the team, they know exactly what to expect out of the lane and back the fuck up.  CK is just so easy to shut down in so many ways.  Luckily for him right now games tend to be on the much shorter side of things, but..."
TrueDoTA2,36xtnh,stakoverflo,6,Sun May 24 23:25:04 2015 UTC,"My question is does he actually suck as much as people think?   Short answer: No, but he still isn't good.  What follows are some random thoughts on CK who remains one of my favorite heroes, in no particular order:  As someone else pointed out, the shift in the meta has helped him a bit because he tends to be quite snowbally - if you can farm heroes with him after grabbing your basic gear you can do well. Basic gear is pretty much always going to be treads & armlet which you should be able to have by around 12 minutes (less if you manage to get one or two kills in lane).  He does have mana issues but it actually isn't insurmountable without specialist supports like KotL or Wisp feeding it to you - the trick is managing your use of chaos bolt since that's the expensive one. It sounds obvious, but you really want to avoid throwing a bolt earlygame unless it will absolutely guarantee you a kill or save someone from death. He's an excellent candidate for both Soul Ring and Bottle (virtually no other melee hero benefits from having a bottled illusion rune as much as CK does!).  Reality rift is a very powerful harassing tool against solo offlaners right from level 1 since it adds a large amount of bonus damage and is only 50 mana - rift them, hit them once or twice and then back off and keep farming. Enemies will usually blow their escape skills the first couple times you do this to them, then they'll often realize you're not committing to the fight and stop wasting their mana. This makes it easier to suddenly bolt them after the rift when you've got a support doing a wrap around or something. Mind games! CK's relatively powerful lane presence is a benefit to your team because he almost never needs a babysitter against a solo offlaner like some weak carries and can thus enjoy full XP while your support goes to do something useful, returning occasionally to gank.  As mentioned by OP, he doesn't really want to be building any of the major farming items, but at least a quelling blade is a good idea (also lets you escape trees if you get one of those weird rifts that leaves you stuck in them). Heart is stupidly powerful on CK because each of his ult illusions gains the full +40 damage from it, plus it serves as an ersatz farm accelerator because you can leave your armlet on all the time once you've got the heart. It is important for CK to be at full hp when any fight breaks out because he wants his phantasms to have full hp too - ulting when you're at 50% life often makes your illusions too easy to kill.  Speaking of which, one of the main problems CK has is that anti-illusion tech absolutely fucks him. Lion and Medusa are both hard counters, while heroes like LC and OD can also be problematic at times. Like most STR carries he can also have problems against diffusal-illusion enemies because he needs his mana to fight properly; without being able to spam rift with phantasm running his threat is greatly reduced. A reasonably early Skadi is usually advised in these games to increase his total mana pool while still giving a decent amount of strength.  Anyway having said all that the biggest thing with him is still that his primary steroid is a relatively long cooldown ultimate. While its nowhere near as bad as it was a few patches ago its still an issue for him because it means he's less good with both aegis and buyback than other carries which is a major problem and will likely remain so unless the skill is reworked. It needs to be something you have to use carefully because its arguably the best single rightclick steroid in the entire game, increasing your damage output by anything up to a rather silly 500%. Anyone who plays CK knows the joy of catching a key enemy hero slightly out of position and 'one-shotting' them in a second with a phantasm/rift combo!  Anyway if you made it this far through all my rambling, go you. Bottom line, CK still has quite a few problems and there are several things he can't deal with properly, but he's a ton of fun to play and can take over games if he starts well. He'll set you bouncing on Armageddon's flank."
TrueDoTA2,36xtnh,ItsDominare,0,Sat May 23 12:07:06 2015 UTC,"He does have mana issues   Wrong.  Either buy manaboots (cheaper than treads+X, and while it was already good before, it's even better after buffs to manaboots), or just buy treads+bracer, treads+bottle, or some other similar combination.  With just treads+bracer at lvl 6 you have enough MP to stun twice, ult, and reality rift - you should be able to kill multiple heroes with that many spells at that point in the game, especially with allies assisting you.  Manaboots are, IMO, the best boots for him unless you have a Crystal Maiden, KotL, or multiple allies who will be rushing manaboots themselves.  You want to be pushing and being aggressive with CK and manaboots facilitates this very well (recharges your mana and your buddies' mana.)  It's also much cheaper than any treads combination while also giving superior throughput to any treads combination.  Look at your team lineup and see if manaboots will be good this game - your team shouldn't need more than 2 manaboots, so ask your supports if they'll be rushing (as in, first item, before wand, before regen, etc) manaboots.  If they aren't, you should get manaboots and they should get brown boots, tranquil boots, or even treads.  Obviously this isn't necessary if you have a KotL (one pair of manaboots will still be necessary but they don't need to be rushed), CM, etc - get treads in those cases.  Heart is very strong on CK but I tend to prefer Skadi.  More stats in a single slot, a slow that pierces BKB, etc.  The health recovery from Heart is very noteworthy, but generally speaking I feel that for the items having relatively equal cost, I would rather have the Skadi slow.   Lion and Medusa are both hard counters, while heroes like LC and OD can also be problematic at times.   Lion really isn't a hard counter because you can just Reality Rift him and instantly kill him.  I suppose if you're just letting him hang back and suck your illusions one by one he's a ""counter"", but CK is one of the best heroes in the game for just barging into a fight and picking off supports.  Unlike AGI heroes like PA that are great at picking off supports, CK doesn't need to wait for the right time - he's tanky and fast and can just ult and run right on in and yank them to him with Reality Rift.  Medusa is very problematic, especially later in the game.  It's easy to force out the Stone Gaze early on, but late in the game she won't have to use it until after you ult, and you probably won't have the raw DPS to force it without your ult, and later in the game her Split Shot will make short work of even tanky Phantasm illusions.  Don't pick CK into a Medusa, and ban Medusa if you pick CK.  Heroes with huge AOE damage are far more problematic than LC and OD.  Sand King (Epicenter), Venomancer (Poison Nova), and Earthshaker (god can't help you now) are heroes you need to play very carefully around.  Even Tidehunter (very OP hero right now) can be an issue since Anchor Smash affects illusions.   While its nowhere near as bad as it was a few patches ago its still an issue for him because it means he's less good with both aegis and buyback than other carries which is a major problem and will likely remain so unless the skill is reworked.   Not really, it's just something you play around like any other, similar skill.  If you have Aegis, you don't ult until after you pop Aegis.  If you have buyback and are planning on using buyback, you don't ult until after buyback.  Though, really, like all similar abilities and items, you just play it by whatever makes the most sense.  Sometimes ulting before Aegis etc makes more sense because not only do your illusions keep pounding away while you're reviving, the overwhelming damage output they produce may put the fight into your favor such that it doesn't matter if you can't ult after you revive.  CK without his illusions is still very potent, especially in teamfights.  You're really underselling how powerful Chaos Bolt and Reality Rift are if you act like he doesn't have much presence once Phantasm is used up."
TrueDoTA2,36xtnh,Thalnagath,5,Sun May 24 14:20:58 2015 UTC,"Wrong.   You're talking about building arcane boots on a hard carry. That's because he has mana issues. So no, not wrong.   With just treads+bracer at lvl 6 you have enough MP to stun twice, ult, and reality rift   Most CK players don't take Phantasm at 6, it isn't worth it compared to maxing his Q and W.   Heart is very strong on CK but I tend to prefer Skadi.   That's fine, they're both good. Like I said, Skadi first can be very handy against mana burn for example, whereas Heart gives you more raw damage. Depends on the game.   Lion really isn't a hard counter because you can just Reality Rift him and instantly kill him.   If he's bad, sure. If the enemy team are no good at Dota, you can go Dagon CK and win. If he isn't bad, he's going to stay out of sight like a good support until you're already engaged, then he's going to blink in and skilldump while you're occupied. There's also a pretty good chance he's going to have a ghost scepter if he's got half a brain.   Don't pick CK into a Medusa, and ban Medusa if you pick CK.   On this - if little else - we agree.   Heroes with huge AOE damage are far more problematic   Only to the extent that they are problematic for all illusion carries. CK's phantasms take quite a bit less damage than other illusions, so if you're at full hp when you ult and you went Heart, you'll have about 3.5k life in the midgame which means they need to deal 1.75k AoE to kill off your illusions, more if your team has a Pipe (which against ES etc they should).   If you have buyback and are planning on using buyback, you don't ult until after buyback.   I'd rather win the fight the first time mate, but to each their own. I don't go into any fights planning to die and buyback, because by the time I return my team could be dead. I suppose it could be argued this one is a matter of personal playstyle. Either way, you've got to concede that compared to a buyback on someone like PL or AM who aren't remotely cooldown dependent, buybacks on carries with long cooldown steroids like CK, Sven, Terrorblade etc are less good.   CK without his illusions is still very potent   Not usually potent enough to kill the enemy carry though, unless you're already way ahead of them. CK without his phantasm isn't going to be able to toe-to-toe a similarly farmed PA or Tiny or even Jugg - and that's because his other steroid (chaos strike) isn't very good relatively speaking. Yes he can still contribute with his powerful spells, but providing stuns isn't what you should be mainly expecting from your carry in the lategame, is it?  Look, its fine to have suggestions and debate about the best way to address CK's shortcomings, but trying to tell us they don't exist isn't going to accomplish anything; I'm really not sure why you tried."
TrueDoTA2,36xtnh,ItsDominare,0,Sun May 24 14:49:40 2015 UTC,"You're talking about building arcane boots on a hard carry. That's because he has mana issues. So no, not wrong.   ""Mana issues"" would require a lot of farm to fix.  A single item doesn't mean the hero has ""mana issues,"" otherwise every single hero in the entire game (even Viper) has ""mana issues.""  And why wouldn't you build manaboots?  They're far more efficient than treads+X, both in terms of gold and in terms of item slots.  You're losing 30 IAS and that's it, and you can easily get the IAS elsewhere as part of your normal item progression.  They also help your entire team, which is important because playing aggressive is a core component of being an effective CK.   Most CK players don't take Phantasm at 6, it isn't worth it compared to maxing his Q and W.   Most CK players are really bad at the game, then.  It's guaranteed double damage on demand, with a 50/50 shot at being triple damage instead.  That double damage also comes in the form of an illusion that can stack/pull, bodyblock, scout, and do all the other things illusions can do.  It used to be pointless to take ulti at 6, but it's been buffed repeatedly since then and you're an idiot to not take it at 6 now.  One extra point in Reality Rift will NOT be worth more than Phantasm now.   If he's bad, sure. If the enemy team are no good at Dota, you can go Dagon CK and win. If he isn't bad, he's going to stay out of sight like a good support until you're already engaged, then he's going to blink in and skilldump while you're occupied. There's also a pretty good chance he's going to have a ghost scepter if he's got half a brain.   Sure, but where's he getting the farm from?  Upgraded boots, a wand, a blinker, and now he has a ghost scepter too?  Who's been buying the wards, dust, etc?  If he's in range to kill illusions, he's in range of reality rift, which means he's about to be dead.   Either way, you've got to concede that compared to a buyback on someone like PL or AM who aren't remotely cooldown dependent, buybacks on carries with long cooldown steroids like CK, Sven, Terrorblade etc are less good.   I'm not disputing that, but why would you draft a team that only has one source of right-click damage anyway?  Just give aegis to someone else who can use it better if you're concerned that CK's contribution without Phantasm won't be enough to turn the tide.  I thought the days of 4-protect-1 were long since past."
TrueDoTA2,36xtnh,Thalnagath,7,Sun May 24 15:29:36 2015 UTC,"He seems really good right now as long as he has some solution for his mana problems, which is easy right now with the buffs to Arcanes (meaning your teammates are more likely to get them) and KOTL. With kills being worth more and farm being worth less, his slow farming is less of a handicap - go ganking once you have an item or two and snowball."
TrueDoTA2,36xtnh,DangerAwar,2,Sat May 23 01:23:04 2015 UTC,"He doesn't have mana problems.  That's a myth.  Even just treads+bracer eliminate your mana problems.  lvl 6 CK with INT treads and bracer has 462 MP, enough to ult, stun twice, and reality rift without factoring in baseline MP regen, stick/wand, etc.  If you can't kill multiple someones at 08:00 with two stuns, your ult, and a reality rift... I dunno what you're doing wrong.  A CK that built manaboots has 558 MP at lvl 6, which is enough to do all of the above, with ~100 MP left over.  Pop boots for the +135 MP, and you now have enough to stun another two times, use reality rift as much as you want, etc.  Manaboots is also considerably cheaper than treads+bracer, treads+bottle, etc.  Poor farming speed has always been his handicap, but that's why you farm heroes, not creeps."
TrueDoTA2,36xtnh,Thalnagath,5,Sun May 24 14:07:31 2015 UTC,"And if you aren't successful in farming heroes, you're fucked.  Everyone knows CK is going to melt you if you let him get close, that's why they play defensively and then he's basically neutered."
TrueDoTA2,36xtnh,stakoverflo,2,Sun May 24 23:27:26 2015 UTC,"And if you aren't successful in farming heroes, you're fucked.   Hence why he's not OP.  Honestly, I think Battle Fury would be viable on him as a stopgap to help him farm, especially now that it includes QB as part of the recipe.  Any idea if this has been tried at the competitive level?   Everyone knows CK is going to melt you if you let him get close, that's why they play defensively and then he's basically neutered.   Meh, you force fights, that's how you get them to fight you."
TrueDoTA2,36xtnh,Thalnagath,5,Sun May 24 23:56:40 2015 UTC,He's actually amazing but too risky and easily countered to pick often in the pro scene. Right now I'm winning about 75% of my games with him getting treads/bottle/armlet/s&y or manta. With bottle I start to fight with my team constantly and usually snowball games. This is at high 4k/low 5k games if that means anything.
TrueDoTA2,36xtnh,BADMON99,4,Sat May 23 13:29:46 2015 UTC,"I think he's actually quite good this patch due to meta changes and I think he was also buffed(?). From what I remember he has a good win rate in very high skill games this patch.  As you said his slow farming won't affect you rly due to your mmr so I would say go for it , he's a really fun hero imo."
TrueDoTA2,36xtnh,NappySlapper,5,Sat May 23 01:08:34 2015 UTC,"I think Chaos Knight is very strong right now. Probably top 10 carries. I really, really dislike playing against CK now. He benefits a ton from the 6.84 changes, and I thought he was almost a strong carry even in 6.83.  The 6.84 emphasis on laning and early game power really benefits CK, who has very high kill potential early on, especially if he's paired with an aggressive support or two. He's also quite comfortable in lane with high base movement speed, high tankiness, and fairly high (if inconsistent) base damage.  His main weaknesses and how 6.84 affects them:   Mana issues: Wand and Treads were both buffed in 6.84 so his mana is easier to manage with the additional stats. Drums and Armlet also received buffs BTW, so that helps too. Farming speed: Armlet attack speed being 25 regardless of being on or off I think was an underrated buff that many people overlooked. This helps speed up CK's farming a little. More importantly, the balance in gold income between kills and creep farming has shifted more towards kills, which benefits a hero-killing carry like CK. Yes there are still no great ""standard"" farm accelerators for CK like Bfury or Radiance or Midas, but I think overall the buffs to most of his core items help out a lot. Long cd ultimate: This is still an issue. Manta helps out here though and I think overall the mitigation of his other weaknesses in 6.84 weighs more. It's not like this problem got any worse in 6.84; his other problems just became a lot more manageable.   He also has a similar effect to PL/Meepo/Slark in that enemy teams that don't have specific ways to deal with his hero almost auto-lose simply by getting run over by Phantasm. If the enemy team has mostly single target abilities, it's very hard to deal with a CK. Linken's and even the new Lotus Orb are very good on CK too.  Plus the hero himself was buffed IIRC with more consistently high damage on Chaos Bolt or something."
TrueDoTA2,36xtnh,reivision,1 point,Sat May 23 14:30:51 2015 UTC,"Mana issues are a myth.  Treads+Bottle, Treads+Bracer, Treads+Soul Ring are the most common solutions, but just getting Arcane Boots is better in most ways.  You lose 30 IAS in exchange for vastly superior throughput... for far less gold.  Obviously, skip the manaboots if your team already has a couple pairs or you have a CM, KotL, Wisp, etc.  Armlet is so stupidly overpowered on STR heroes.  I really don't know why it keeps getting buffed.  2600 gold for the stats it provides, the effortless build up, plus the option of toggling... just so, so stupid.  Volvo pls.  Radiance could be doable on CK if you're having a really baller early game, it got the miss chance back, and with his high move speed and tankiness he's actually not a bad aura hero.  Whether Radiance would be better than 5k worth of other items... not sure, I actually haven't tried Radiance on him in a long time.  I feel like it would be very good if you could get it really early though (like 15-20 mins?), far better than SnY or other comparable items.  Phantasm's long cooldown is his major balancing factor and needs to stay the way it is.  You'd have to remove the automatic free kill effect from Reality Rift with illusions if you wanted to reduce the cooldown on Phantasm.  And yeah, he's still vulnerable to anti-illusion/anti-swarm counters.  Like you I'd still list him as being in the top 10 for carries right now, but he does require an element of strategy and planning to drafting."
TrueDoTA2,36xtnh,Thalnagath,3,Sun May 24 14:29:23 2015 UTC,"If you're running him without cm/kotl/wisp, please don't forget to pick up basi!"
TrueDoTA2,36xtnh,mojo1287,2,Sat May 23 09:10:08 2015 UTC,"The answer is no he doesn't...  I think the good thing about CK for me is that he doesn't really have a point in the game where he is weak.  He's very mana dependent but that can be mitigated a number of ways.  Once you get armlet his jungle farming becomes a lot easier, when you have drums+treads is when you should really be killing stuff around the map and never jungle farming.  Your method seems pretty good, CK is also one of the heros you can consider picking up a bottle on with drums, it really helps your mana and you will be moving around runes a lot anyway.  SnY is good, but I'm a huge fan of drums->armlet->heart->manta because you can just leave armlet on permanently...  It's all about making the illusions stronger.  Once you get these 4 items you can solo pretty much anyone in the game except a few direct counters like medusa.  His weakness is he is very ulti dependent late game, so ulti management becomes a crucial skill.  Say you get caught out and they burst you to half, the temptation is to use ult and maybe stay alive, but especially if you have buyback then you should just save your ulti.  CK is all about knowing when a fight is about to happen and preparing your illusions beforehand so you can instagib someone.  Also if they pick medusa it's going to be a hjard game to play CK, I usually just pick something else if they do that.  It's not IMPOSSIBLE to win as I have done it by having my team bait out the ulti and then using my ult, but he greatly reduces your power to run all over their supports in teamfights."

TrueDoTA2,36xtnh,Thalnagath,2,Sun May 24 14:22:57 2015 UTC,"I think I'm 15:2 on him. He's so good in an aggro trilane or generally aggressive lineups. His only major problem is IMO his long ult cd, not his lack of farming abilities (you should take him in a lineup where you can farm heros too)."
TrueDoTA2,36xtnh,Thefelix01,2,Sat May 23 08:48:04 2015 UTC,"He's one of the most dangerous heroes in the game at lvl 2.  A natural pairing with a Crystal Maiden, maybe a little less so with Keeper of the Light (KotL works well on a team with him, less effective in a lane with him.)"
TrueDoTA2,36xtnh,Thalnagath,2,Sun May 24 14:23:45 2015 UTC,"The last three games I've played with CK have had a crystal maiden in them, and I've gone godlike in all of them. So I think that's the secret."
TrueDoTA2,36xtnh,brendan10211,1 point,Sun May 24 02:10:58 2015 UTC,"CK+CM is a natural combination.  They're great in lane together, and the aura is just generally useful for him.  Both heroes have immense kill potential at level 2.  If CM goes nova/frostbite at lvl 2 (get aura at lvl 3 and buy a bunch of clarities and a mango), the kill potential for the two of them is pretty obscene."
TrueDoTA2,36xtnh,Thalnagath,1 point,Sun May 24 14:30:37 2015 UTC,"Do you think Octarine Core would be worth the cost on him to knock down the cool down on his ultimate? It seems like (on paper) a great pick up with the one exception of the cost. You get stats, regen, some lifesteal, and cd reduction which are all things he needs."
TrueDoTA2,36xtnh,Saarlak,1 point,Sat May 23 12:10:17 2015 UTC,"I think it could be viable if it wasn't for the incredible cost and long build up but I do agree with your points. It seems every thread since the patch hit consists of ""omg OC op on (any and every hero)"". I was just doing some paper theory crafting and it seemed an answer to his problems (excluding the cost of course)."
TrueDoTA2,36xtnh,Saarlak,3,Sat May 23 13:11:17 2015 UTC,"Flatly, no. He doesn't need mana THAT badly, it only gives him Int when as an illusion hero he needs stats-stats not HP bonuses from the Soul Booster (illusions only benefit from Str/Agi/Int, they get nothing from damage items or hp items.) and the only lifesteal is on his stun. I think you'd be better off with a Refresher if the game got that late, or a Satanic for your lifesteal problem, or if you really need a late game mana solution I think Skadi would be pretty decent."
TrueDoTA2,36xtnh,Saarlak,1 point,Sat May 23 14:13:36 2015 UTC,"Dude, I feel dumb. Somehow I had the +all stats from Skadi mixed up with the +int from OC. I'm... Im a special kind of smart today."
TrueDoTA2,36xtnh,MestHoop,2,Sat May 23 23:29:15 2015 UTC,"It's a very bad idea. You can flat health and mana gain, which your illus don't scale off of. The massive mana you get is wasted (cheaper items will suffice until you get something that provides other uses as well, like skadi). The lifesteal is only affects chaos bolt damage (unless the hit from reality rift counts) so it is absolutely marginal health regen (less than a magic wand). The CDR is the only truly useful stat, and is not worth the 6k gold investment with terrible buildup for the hero.  You're far better off spending it on something that actually increases his damage or surviveability that also scales with your illus."
TrueDoTA2,36xtnh,Saarlak,2,Sun May 24 00:29:45 2015 UTC,"Thanks for dumbing that down for me :) I very rarely play illusion heroes so I never really ""get"" their item builds."
TrueDoTA2,36xtnh,MestHoop,1 point,Sat May 23 14:14:06 2015 UTC,"For future reference: Illusions scale off of your base stats. So Strength, Agility and Intelligence. Obviously they can't use mana, so int does nothing unless you yourself are an int hero. They don't gain flat bonuses of any kind: attack damage, health, attack speed, movespeed, etc.   The other thing illusions do get are auras. So illus will get the aura advantage of items like Vlads and AC, even when the main hero isn't around. This is why Radiance works on heroes like Naga siren, because it is considered an aura. Other auras include Gem of truesight, headdress regen and the items headdress builds into, etc.  Illus don't gain any orb effects (also known as attack modifiers), so they can't lifesteal, bash, slow with SnY or Skadi, etc. The only exceptions are attack modifiers that come from auras (like Vlads lifesteal) and Diffusal blade. Hence why heroes like PL and specter often build Diffusal: their illusions burn 100% of the Diffusal blade mana when they attack, even if their normal damage is lowered compared to the main hero.  TL;DR: illusions only scale with stat items, auras and diffusal blade."
TrueDoTA2,36xtnh,Alieksiei,2,Sat May 23 14:19:27 2015 UTC,"Illusions do scale off flat health bonuses, and are not affected by auras other than atkspeed ones. They do pass on the aura effects tho.  Edit: also movespeed bonuses all affect them"
TrueDoTA2,36xtnh,Saarlak,1 point,Sat May 23 16:27:48 2015 UTC,"That was really well written! I think my confusion just came from ""what do illusions get"". Stats, auras, and nothing else (well diffusal)."
TrueDoTA2,36xtnh,Thalnagath,-2,Sun May 24 00:22:10 2015 UTC,"People are retarded.  CK is very strong.  CK has been very strong for multiple patches now.  They seem to think that he has mana problems (he doesn't), or that he's reliant on Wisp (he isn't.)  One of the best stuns in the game, third highest base move speed in the game, strong stat growth across the board, he has a blink, he has a 3x crit, and his ulti is basically a Sven ulti except better.  Easily one of the most dangerous heroes in the game at level 2, and if you can go boots first or get boots quickly, it's very difficult for enemy supports to survive in lane - blink, stun, they're dead, because a support with 290-300 ms isn't going to escape a CK with 375 ms.  He doesn't have mana issues.  You can solve them a variety of ways.  Soul Ring.  Treads+Bottle.  Manaboots (even better now after the buffs, they're even cheaper than treads, especially since you can disassemble and sell the energy booster later on.)  Allied manaboots for pushing.  Pick Crystal Maiden or Keeper of the Light.  And on, and on, and on.  CK's mana costs are actually pretty low because Valve is dumb, which means he quickly reaches the point where a major balancing factor of his (having to juggle mana costs) stops being a factor.  People also like to skip his ulti at level 6, because it used to be weaker, and because they feel like he can't afford it at lvl 6.  These people are stupid.  CK's ulti is one of the best ults in the game.  At level 1, without the bonus illusion, it's just a flat double damage.  You get two CKs for the price of one, each doing full damage, and the illusions only take a small amount more damage than CK himself does.  If you proc the bonus illusion, it's a triple damage rune.  It's not like you'll ever have issues with illusions not being able to hit your target when Reality Rift plops everyone together.  CK that used ult is basically instant death for any support that gets into Reality Rift range; you don't even need to stun them, they'll just fucking die before they can blink because CK's damage output with ulti is absurd.  Ulti does have a long cooldown, but it also has a long duration.  Unless you do something stupid like ult into a Poison Nova or farmed Leshrac or something, there's not much downtime between when the illusions disappear and when you can ult again.  Even if you lose the illusions quickly, CK isn't reliant on his ult, not anymore than Leoric, Sven, etc are.  You still have one of the best stuns in the game, you're still almost impossible to kite, you still have all those crazy good stats.  CK's benefited from a lot of changes in the past few patches too.  Desolator got cheaper by 600 (volvo pls) gold.  Armlet has been buffed again and again, as if it wasn't already disgustingly overpowered on STR heroes (and even moreso on CK, who doesn't even need to keep it active for his illusions to receive the +25 STR bonus, and illusions don't lose HP from HP degen.)  While CK himself probably won't get one, Solar Crest is also incredibly strong combined with him.  Manaboots are both cheaper and more effective than they used to be, meaning they're even stronger than before - whether CK himself gets them, or an ally gets them.  But seriously, manaboots are great on CK.  You lose out on 30 IAS and that's about it - you gain far more constant and recovered mana than by INT swapping on treads, and it costs far less gold than treads+soul ring or treads+bottle.  It's also far more efficient for when you inevitably need to get boots of travel, since you can disassemble them and sell the energy booster instead of having to sell boots and buy BoT's whole.  Only get treads if you know you can rely on allies having manaboots by time you start pushing and being aggressive (usually around 12-15 mins), or if your team has a mana recovery mechanic (KotL or CM.)"
TrueDoTA2,36vgjn,loveisdead,19,Fri May 22 13:09:19 2015 UTC,Personally I like to get an urn. Gives you some mana regen and extra hp. And if you haunt in to a gank you get a some free urn charges for hp.
TrueDoTA2,36vgjn,brtd90,4,Fri May 22 13:11:45 2015 UTC,"this, an urn is not a whole lot of gold so you don't delay radiance a whole lot. gives mana regen for more daggers and haunt uptime, as well as decent early game strength to increase her tankyness and thus her dispersion damage. also if there are lots of kills you participate in you have lots of heals + you can contribute a significant amount of damage just by using the urn on enemies in fights"
TrueDoTA2,36vgjn,ferret_80,12,Sat May 23 02:51:28 2015 UTC,"You should at least have a stout, that alone will mitigate a ton of the damage you take in jungle. Additionally even with radiance QB is still a nice to have as it still nicely boosts farm. A naked RoH is pretty big game on Spectre ... usually you get it before radiance and it provides all of the sustain you will need in lane.  It can be turned into a Vanguard (an amazing item on spectre, even late) and at that point you can largely ignore all but the most dedicated harass until very late. You shouldn't jungle if there's a lane available.  Spectre has better than average escape once you are even the slightest bit tanked up so you should eat lanes with that radiance and apply map pressure to the enemy team while avoiding fights Always be where your team isn't, which really means always be farming.  Spectre can be safely played like an NP or Tinker in that you wait for fights to start and then you teleport in to take advantage of the situation.  The benefit is you never really stop farming."
TrueDoTA2,36vgjn,feralminded,7,Fri May 22 14:24:25 2015 UTC,"If you're not going vanguard turning the stout into a poor man's shield is totally worth it too, even more so now that base stout shield is nerfed."
TrueDoTA2,36vgjn,Tarqon,3,Fri May 22 22:33:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah the PMS is extremely efficient on Spectre, adding a lot more tank than people expect."
TrueDoTA2,36vgjn,feralminded,9,Fri May 22 23:40:36 2015 UTC,"This is one of the benefits of ""slahser's way"" Spectre. If you get Urn charges you can jungle thanks to the heal. Ideally though you want to farm a lane if it's safe. Jungle is a last resort."
TrueDoTA2,36vgjn,journalctl,3,Fri May 22 13:43:45 2015 UTC,Do you gain urn charge if an illusion is near a kill?
TrueDoTA2,36vgjn,samnya745,6,Fri May 22 14:25:27 2015 UTC,"Nope, but keep in mind with the recent Haunt change you can Reality into a kill and quickly Reality back to your original position."
TrueDoTA2,36vgjn,journalctl,1 point,Fri May 22 14:27:38 2015 UTC,wait what...how?
TrueDoTA2,36vgjn,FusionX,4,Sat May 23 09:01:35 2015 UTC,"The 6.84 change to Haunt and Reality:    Reality no longer kills the target illusion, it now swaps positions   When Spectre uses Reality, she swaps places with the targeted illusion, and she can swap back before the end of Haunt's duration."
TrueDoTA2,36vgjn,Animastryfe,9,Sat May 23 20:05:59 2015 UTC,"something no one else mentions but i feel is mandatory to add to your skillset on Any HERO; pull the camp all the way to the edge of its return(leash) point, then start hitting it on its return path. This takes longer but if a fight is about to pop or your in danger of getting ganked, you can not risk being low hp."
TrueDoTA2,36vgjn,zzmane,4,Fri May 22 13:56:03 2015 UTC,This works really well when you have Radiance.
TrueDoTA2,36vgjn,zzmane,7,Fri May 22 14:06:11 2015 UTC,id rather spend that extra 5-8s clearing a camp this way rather than going home and taking an extra 30 plus TP cost/cd.
TrueDoTA2,36vgjn,treefreeme,2,Fri May 22 14:10:21 2015 UTC,"yeah, this is definitely the majority of what solves this problem. when you jungle, you dont just sit in the camp and man fight the creeps, you kind of run around so that you're affecting as many camps as possible with your movement and micro your attacks so that you're taking as little damage as possible."
TrueDoTA2,36vgjn,Kaitohi,2,Fri May 22 23:42:48 2015 UTC,"Aquila is a must before radiance I think, gives way too much value for the gold to pass up and spectre doesn't really need other smaller items so theres no downside to having 1 less slot, the regen is defintiely noticeable. If you like to fight more in the early game and your team doesn't have one yet then urn is also an option."
TrueDoTA2,36vgjn,Kaitohi,4,Fri May 22 13:21:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah Aquila is good, but it doesn't give HP regen."
TrueDoTA2,36vgjn,subraizada3_,5,Fri May 22 13:33:49 2015 UTC,But you can farm faster and you take less damage which means you stay at higher hp.
TrueDoTA2,36vgjn,pucklermuskau,2,Fri May 22 14:06:50 2015 UTC,"Right, but I'm asking about how to efficiently regenerate HP and I don't see how the Aquila solves that problem. If you are attacked, or you lose HP anyways during your time in the jungle the item doesn't help you gain it back."
TrueDoTA2,36vgjn,Now_you_fucked_up,4,Fri May 22 14:17:23 2015 UTC,"Aquila gives 3 armor, meaning you don't take a much damage, meaning you need to regen less. Aquila gives 18 damage and 9 AS, meaning you kill creeps faster, so you need to regen less. It reduces the damage you take, hence effectively increasing your total HP (so it's more efficient to farm until getting low and then going to fountain) and also boosting the value of your base HP regen if you don't go to fountain to heal"
TrueDoTA2,36vgjn,Drop_,2,Fri May 22 14:56:00 2015 UTC,"Yes, you take less damage, but you don't take zero damage, or even negligible damage. The question is what is the most useful item on Spectre to gain back the HP when you move into the jungle. In this case the Radiance was picked up and the wave was pushed out, so it was time to move into the jungle, but the creeps still hit Spectre for a significant amount. The goal is to use the jungle without having to go back to base frequently, especially since Spectre can join fights at a moments notice.  To solve this problem many heroes build Mask or Helm or Vlads or Vanguard or Battlefury.   The options appropriate to Spectre seem to be Mask or Vanguard or Urn if your team doesn't have one."
TrueDoTA2,36vgjn,Now_you_fucked_up,1 point,Fri May 22 17:18:24 2015 UTC,"the most efficient way to regenerate hp is to avoid losing the health in the first place though, its a legitimate response."
TrueDoTA2,36vgjn,ferret_80,2,Fri May 22 14:49:00 2015 UTC,"This is the most frustratingly absentminded comment chain I've seen in a while.  Obviously Having 90 damage helps you lose a bit less life jungling than having 80 damage. OP is not asking what will make him lose 5 less health farming jungle, he is asking what will make him be able to farm SUSTAINABLY.   Obviously because he is asking for a farm accelerator, he is going to need a cheap item, as needing a farm accelerator implies you do not have good farm yet.   So OP is asking for a cheap item that will help him jungle for a while to get gold.  Aqui will not help him farm sustainably, it will help him farm one camp a bit faster, and then he will not have enough health for the next Ursa camp.  In no world is ""buy some damage"" an answer to someone who is asking for sustain.   There is a reason many heroes buy lifesteal, and a reason why RoH is built into Bfury. Damage is not jungling capability, Regen is.   If damage was budgeted enough to allow jungling at a low price point, there would be no reason for regen to even exist. The game is not completely broken and imbalanced, you need an item specifically designed for health regen to keep your health sustainable in jungle.   In short, suggesting Aqui is moronic."
TrueDoTA2,36vgjn,gu3st12,2,Fri May 22 17:00:56 2015 UTC,For some reason your post made me want to try Battlefury Spectre.

TrueDoTA2,36vgjn,Peetipablo,1 point,Sat May 23 02:54:58 2015 UTC,"Plus, reducing damage (or doign more damage) doesn't help your overall sustain when moving around the map.  If you've just won a fight, having 0 regen will kill your push, where having some regen items will allow you to at least continue pushing and taking objectives.  It's why Mek is such a good item in this current early push meta.  Helps you win the fight, or regen to full after the fight."
TrueDoTA2,36vgjn,lel_jenk,-1,Fri May 22 20:38:28 2015 UTC,"Okay, so you're saying that after I get Radiance I should push out the wave and then sit at my tower to avoid losing HP by killing creeps in the jungle?"
TrueDoTA2,36vgjn,KELonPS3in576p,2,Fri May 22 15:50:46 2015 UTC,"IMO rushing radiance is a bad idea. Regardless, the previous poster is trying to say that mitigating 100 damage is the same as regenerating 100 damage. By having higher armor and killing the jungle creeps faster because you have more damage, you will be taking less damage overall."
TrueDoTA2,36vgjn,TheAwesomeHNH,0,Fri May 22 16:31:04 2015 UTC,"But I would still be taking damage and eventually I would need it back. I know what each stat does, I know what armor does, and I know what extra damage does. However, none of those bring me from 500HP to 900HP, unless you want to argue that +strength adds 0.03hp/second per point."
TrueDoTA2,36vgjn,wildtarget13,5,Fri May 22 17:05:08 2015 UTC,Yes but in the same regard you are also ignoring that you don't have to regen the hp because you would not be that low in the first place.   I have less than 10 games as spec but I like to do phase boots vanguard and then radiance. Gives me damage and sustain.
TrueDoTA2,36vgjn,kjhgfr,-1,Fri May 22 18:13:57 2015 UTC,"So if I have Aquila and Radiance I will be able to farm stacks in the jungle without taking over 200HP of damage (given that her HP should still be ~1k by the time Radiance has been purchased, 200HP is significant)?   I haven't tested it but it seems highly unlikely given that with brown boots, I think I had a stout, and radiance, but without Aquila I was taking between 100-200 damage each camp."

TrueDoTA2,36vgjn,TheArchist,1 point,Fri May 22 17:21:06 2015 UTC,it's all about that 0.09 hp/second
TrueDoTA2,36vgjn,TheArchist,2,Sat May 23 07:50:00 2015 UTC,"I like to go Mask of Madness after Poor Man's Shield, Quelling Blade, Treads or Phase and Wand. It allows me to jungle easily and gank low health heroes. After that Radiance into what the game demands."
TrueDoTA2,36vgjn,functionals,2,Fri May 22 13:44:48 2015 UTC,"MoM Vanguard or Urn  EDIT: Bottle too, its also good to just ferry a salve to yourself sometimes."
TrueDoTA2,36vgjn,TheArchist,2,Fri May 22 15:46:27 2015 UTC,"Vanguard is honestly solid. Spectre does a lot of damage based on his HP, I'm surprised it's fallen out of favor. It also makes early game ganks on him super hard compared to say urn or vlads or bottle. Delaying radiance isn't bad anymore since it's worth more with miss chance and makes you tankier. The biggest problem is no mana to dagger or ult."
TrueDoTA2,36vgjn,ferret_80,1 point,Sat May 23 00:16:42 2015 UTC,"Vanguard is solid, the issue is that it gives you 0% increased farming speed, only sustain.  Mask of Madness gives both and mobility on top of it, but no HP and it slowly drains your mana."

Now with the PL rework, he benefits so much from lifesteal and Skadi slow due to this manfighter incarnation while Naga now gets Octarine due to cool down reduction.

TrueDoTA2,36tsxx,CommandX3,13,Fri May 22 01:44:24 2015 UTC,I'm wondering why you'd build a sny at all with that build order. You might as well just finish the silver edge and start your manta. Or another item. (Also you said disassemble sny and make silver edge and butterfly....heh)
TrueDoTA2,36tsxx,ubermeatwad,2,Fri May 22 01:59:13 2015 UTC,I think the strength of S&Y is its versatility of upgrades. You build it in the middle game and you can adapt to a wide range of situations.
TrueDoTA2,36tsxx,f5f5f5f5f5f5f5f5f5f5,-1,Fri May 22 14:38:32 2015 UTC,"Well, I'd have S&Y right away, and only keep it until I get the recipe for Silver Edge.

Edit: got rid of dumb off-topic question."

TrueDoTA2,36tsxx,ubermeatwad,3,Fri May 22 04:09:33 2015 UTC,"Break would make you much more relevant in the mid game when trying to take out stronger heroes as it makes you much harder to manfight.

TrueDoTA2,36tsxx,Drop_,-1,Fri May 22 02:43:41 2015 UTC,The only issue with that is that Blademail isn't as great on him since they changed the way Blood Rage interacts with Blademail.
TrueDoTA2,36tsxx,Pingudiem,1 point,Fri May 22 02:53:07 2015 UTC,Blade mail is still really good. It's just not absolutely core anymore. I still would say that it's almost always a good buy.

TrueDoTA2,36tsxx,fourthirds,2,Fri May 22 10:08:04 2015 UTC,I have been rushing silvers edge on him with treads. The OoV is an interesting item. I usually get BkB after silvers edge. It has worked well. I also wonder if I should go blademail before silver edge for even more snowball.   Another thing is that I have seen the pros only putting one point inti the silence and I tend to agree after playing him a bit. You are better off going 1 1 4 1 into 4 1 4 2.

TrueDoTA2,36tsxx,fourthirds,2,Fri May 22 11:20:08 2015 UTC,"I play a lot of BS. My standard carry build order is treads-Aquila-yasha-sange-silver edge, from there going bkb, butterfly, and/or skadi. I go yasha SNY silver edge - the yasha move speed bonus is important for sticking to targets, and it's also a good farm accelerator. I don't like going SB straight away because that 2800 gold comes slow, and if your early ganks fail you fall behind. Also, the extra bulk from sange is very useful.  You are right that OOV is good. It just depends on slots - you want boots, qb, tp, Aquila, SNY parts - from there choose between stick/wand or OOV.  Mael is good but you need to think carefully if you need it - it helps you push but it gives you no extra bulk. I find that bs's issue isn't doing mad deeps, it's surviving. For that reason I usually tank up with skadi/bkb/butterfly instead of going lightning."
TrueDoTA2,36tsxx,Mezkh,2,Fri May 22 12:58:36 2015 UTC,Sure. Silver edge is situational though. I would not get it unless you need the break effect. Halberd or solar crest are better otherwise IMO.

There's 2 ways it could go down.   Since one of your Meepos dies, you simply die. This is fair but entirely unfun. They won't go for that. One of your Meepos just disappears with no negative consequences to you. This is even worse because this let's you get out of banks at no cost! Say an enemy isolates one of your Meepos and is about to kill it when you drop your Aghs and escape death. This is heaps more unfair than not getting an Aghs slot because you weren't patient enough. They won't do that either."

Anyway, why do heroes that can drop their aghs deserve effectively an extra slot, this is unfair on ogre, tree, timber, meepo,  etc. FOR NO REASON."
TrueDoTA2,36r4qy,GINnFIN,13,Thu May 21 13:52:08 2015 UTC,"Well it's not FOR NO REASON.  It's because those Aghs grant additional abilities (or in Meepo's case an additional hero). Coding the removal of an ability is probably trickier than adding one. What happens if Timber has his Agh's Chakram out and drops or sells his Agh's? Does it stay there forever?  In almost 99% of cases pre 6.84 you never had a reason to try to sell Agh's on these heroes anyway. It's only because of the introduction of Agh's Alch that this is really an issue.  I'd say that it's an oversight that may or may not be addressed (again depending on how difficult it is to code the removal of added Agh's abilities). Calling out bullshit and getting all drama queen about it probably isn't gonna help your case.  And I'd hesitate to even label it a nerf, as that's the way it's always worked. Sure, maybe relative to some other heroes who also rush Agh's like, uh....QoP sometimes and AA who rarely gets 6 slotted anyway. But it's not like IceFrog has an agenda and is out to nerf your precious Meepo."

TrueDoTA2,36m50f,Aesyn,26,Wed May 20 12:00:39 2015 UTC,"PS: My view is from a pub mentality.  He's my ""I want to win this game"" hero at the moment. He's basically everywhere, on top of that, deals lots of damage early game.  My skill build is 1-1-4-1 by level 7, at that point, with just a treads and an Urn, you can 100-0 most supports and lots of cores by yourself alone. I generally fish for greater bashes when I'm in lane. If I get one on a squishy, it's pretty much gg because 2 more bashes are guaranteed from skills and it is generally all you need.  Also I advocated Shadow Blade few times before on this subreddit and I want to restate here, it is freaking amazing. I generally cast charge on a squishy hero whenever I see them on the map. Later I decide to keep going or to cancel charge, and shadow blade works wonders with this strategy because it gives a bit more time to decide essentially. If your target put himself in a bad position, take your free kill and tp away. If not, don't worry you are still invisible.  You also don't pop out of invisibility when you reach your target with charge. It only ends when you first auto-attack them. Use this to cause major disruption out of nowhere. If they have dusts or sentries, just get away, by the time they use detection you will be in a safer position because you still have ms bonus from invisibility.  And since they don't see you until the moment they are stunned, believe me you get more successful charges with invisibility. Also you get baited less(last second eul's, phase shifts, mass tp's to a nearby tower).  Since this is the patch of aggression, I agree, Space Cow is great. Also as side bonuses if things don't go according to plan, Barathrum generally creates a lot of ""space"" if your carries need to farm more, and has great disables through bkb's later.  Edit: I thought I needed to state his weaknesses too, since he definitely has them. Stuns/silences wreck him really hard. Don't expect to pull of an ulti if you are in the focus of the fight. You'll need a bkb 9 out of 10 games. Enemies/teams with great sustain are also the bane of Bara because you are so front-loaded. If you and your team are not able to get off one/two pickups during your 3/4 man stun charges, and your ulti, enemies may overcome your utility."
TrueDoTA2,36m50f,sequence-,5,Wed May 20 12:14:28 2015 UTC,Do you pop shadow blade during your charge or before?   Can you link your dotabuff?

But if silver edge counters my enemy (pa, bristle) I get it before bkb. AC last. My other item choices would be sny for more snowballing, mjollnir/moon shard for more bashes, but couldn't fit them into the build.

TrueDoTA2,36m50f,pretty_meta,3,Sun May 24 03:45:35 2015 UTC,"SB is a ridiculous hero because his kit is ridiculous, not because he fits into this meta. He has enormous eHP in the early game, and if you run him as a position 5 you can gank any lane after level 2. You can almost always trade your life for an enemy 1-3, which is always beneficial to your team. This damages the enemy team's farmers' economy in the early game. Then you pick up shit like Shadow Blade and become undetectable during your goddamn charge, and then supports can't even stun you as you charge in, and now they have to buy detection on the off chance that their carry gets charged.   This hero seems to synergize really well with the ""meta"" we've seen at the Summit. Get a pick off/take a skirmish then push for objectives.   That's every ""meta"" ever...   Able to easily lock down and dispatch popular ""glass cannon"" picks like QoP, Storm, SF   SF definitely. QoP and Storm should be elusive enough that they can't be solo killed by SB (QoP has blink and Storm has pretty high armor IIRC21), nor can SB prevent them from pressuring the map. I'd think SB is better against heroes like Sniper and Gyrocopter who rely upon not trading hits with their enemies."
TrueDoTA2,36m50f,cilantro_avocado,2,Wed May 20 18:39:06 2015 UTC,"Well, QoP can't blink away from a charge, so she has to wait until after the charge connects and it's guaranteed bash. She can't blink away from Nether Strike either,so if SB casts it and she blinks during the cast animation, she's still not going to get away.  Also she is squishy enough that if at least 1 auto-attack bash procs between the during that time, she won't get a chance to blink away.  As for Storm, I forget how Charge and Nether Strike interacts with Ball Lighting. If Storm can time it right, maybe he can avoid them by being invulnerable during the connection time. Anybody know for sure? But if Storm doesn't avoid it (either because he can't or just fails too), he is susceptible to the same lock down as QoP. He has slightly higher HP and better armor than QoP, but probably 2/3 of Spirit Breaker's damage is magical, so the armor isn't decreasing the damage that much. However, once Storm has a Point/Vitality/Soul Booster or even Bloodstone (+200/250/450/500hp), he isn't a total glass cannon, so he has a much better chance to slip away unless the Spirit Breaker has Ogre Magi like 'skill'."
TrueDoTA2,36m50f,musclenugget92,1 point,Wed May 20 20:47:15 2015 UTC,If you blink into trees before SBS ulti connects does it still connect?
TrueDoTA2,36m50f,cantadmittoposting,1 point,Sat May 23 09:30:55 2015 UTC,"has pretty high armor IIRC   Worth noting that bash and nether are magical damage, but yeah the auto attacks are needed eventually"
TrueDoTA2,36m50f,Aesyn,1 point,Wed May 20 20:29:28 2015 UTC,"qop early game is quite kill-able. if she doesn't blink back to her tower and you charge stun her in a good place, you can deal enough damage with +1 (preferably your mid). Before your first stun ends, chain your ulti, she cannot blink escape your ulti once your noticeable ulti sound kicks in. You'll travel with her and hopefully finish her. In my experience, she doesn't have the luxury to wait your ulti too.  Obviously you need to be 6.  (If she does blink and you can only charge stun her in her tower range, don't do that if she's still healthy. Abort mission. Do stun her if she's half hp or so)  Storm Spirit though, you cannot chain your ulti because any time he zaps your ulti channel ends. You kinda rely on him to waste his mana before."
TrueDoTA2,36m50f,AchaMahide,0,Wed May 20 20:48:45 2015 UTC,"That's every ""meta"" ever...   Well, not really. 6.83 teams were never actually seeking pickoffs... they would just turtle, and the only fights we ever saw were rosh fights/high ground fights"
TrueDoTA2,36m50f,Godwine,2,Wed May 20 21:47:16 2015 UTC,"My pub games has been littered by SB lately, luckily I play a lot of stun support, and honestly Shadow Demon, Rubick, Bane and Lion wrecks him pretty hard, especially if you see him coming.  Wards and stuns, helps me take care of SB picker pretty effectively IMO."
TrueDoTA2,36m50f,JaCKaSS_69,2,Wed May 20 18:58:25 2015 UTC,Get a pick off/take a skirmish then push for objectives.   Hasn't this technically been the meta for a long time?
TrueDoTA2,36m50f,Whilyam,1 point,Wed May 20 21:48:06 2015 UTC,Not really. There have been incredibly defensive/turtly metas in the past where early aggression (SB's niche) was useless. See 6.83 comeback mechanic abuse with Sniper.
TrueDoTA2,36m50f,quarrelated,2,Wed May 20 21:49:52 2015 UTC,"Not go-to, but definitely a potent offlaner and position 4 support imo. Especially if the enemy doesn't have too many instant disables and he's allowed to farm up a bit so he can transition to midgame he's very good. He also pairs up very well with the current BH roaming support role who can reveal the weak junglers/glass cannons/supports and with a SB charge + ult and BH combo its an easy and fast kill."
TrueDoTA2,36m50f,thadpole,2,Wed May 20 12:13:11 2015 UTC,"Agreed. In the games I've played, it's very rare that the team with SB will lose. Played as Disruptor against an SB and, even if I glimpsed him back, he was smart enough to go on targets who were almost dead so the glimpse didn't actually save them. So even against a counter, you can still make it work."
TrueDoTA2,36m50f,Ronikan,1 point,Wed May 20 15:10:10 2015 UTC,how would you lane him as a pos4 support? just roam from the onset?
TrueDoTA2,36m50f,Thalnagath,1 point,Wed May 20 16:18:26 2015 UTC,"Spam pull for your levels, bully offlaner with your superior base damage, armor, and hp pool. Roam on the squishies early in tandem with your other support. Once you get 6, the amount of single target cc sb offers is over 3 seconds, which is basically roar that does more damage albeit interruptable. I reccomend maxing bash as its the most utility you get from the hero.  If you are solo support, give your safelaner an advantage by sacrificing your early levels to zone the offlaner, then spam pulls to level 6.  Sb is a fairly level dependant hero, and it's important to be able to consistently chain pull."
TrueDoTA2,36m50f,Jbergur,1 point,Wed May 20 22:22:14 2015 UTC,"IG has been running SB on Luo a lot these days. He forces teams to play defensively and group up, punishes split pushing, and his pickoffs allow teams to go for objectives at a low risk."
TrueDoTA2,36m50f,Bentomat,1 point,Wed May 20 15:06:08 2015 UTC,Not the new sniper. Probably not overpowered but he's very obnoxious to play against. The new items definitely help him. In particular he's a natural choice for a silver edge or glimmer cape.
TrueDoTA2,36m50f,brinebold,1 point,Wed May 20 16:22:52 2015 UTC,"Might very well be.  In .83 I was completely undefeated with this hero, with like 9 wins or something, every match going to the offlane, soaking xp and trying to win the other lanes so our carry and mid were stronger than theirs.  Typically I built Tranqs, urn, mek, pipe and stuff like that and just became a meat shield with all the goodness of auras for my team.  I can see this being a very valuable strategy in .84 as well, yet you still rely a lot on your cores doing well enough to be worthy of your support and ganks."
TrueDoTA2,36m50f,Thalnagath,-6,Wed May 20 14:17:45 2015 UTC,"No. The patch is about taking towers and Roshan, Spirit Breaker offers nothing for these objectives."
TrueDoTA2,36o1zo,NightBane,28,Wed May 20 20:03:16 2015 UTC,"this looks identical to the Lina challenge, which is blink in and stun two heroes. it's possible that this is a bug and he has the wrong hero's challenge. Valve likely fucked up  or if you're not terrible at dota you simply need to play against a windrunner, blink next to her and one of her allies with lotus orb up as she shackles you, and reflect the shackle back onto two heroes. simple"
TrueDoTA2,36o1zo,zenmod3,10,Wed May 20 20:26:39 2015 UTC,"I had the Lina one and I did it with two instances of Blink followed by a one-man stun. They did not have to be stunned together, which was counter to my expectations. Made it much easier though.  Then I rolled Techies. IceFrog pls"
TrueDoTA2,36o1zo,reivision,2,Wed May 20 22:33:51 2015 UTC,What's wrong with techies? I've done most my challenges with him.
TrueDoTA2,36o1zo,synobal,6,Thu May 21 11:02:55 2015 UTC,"this looks identical to the Lina challenge, which is blink in and stun two heroes. it's possible that this is a bug and he has the wrong hero's challenge. Valve likely fucked up   A lot of heroes have a ""Blink and stun 2"" challenge. I've had it for Sand King and Earthshaker."
TrueDoTA2,36o1zo,DangerAwar,4,Wed May 20 20:53:51 2015 UTC,"word, it looks like invoker was mistakenly added to that group"
TrueDoTA2,36o1zo,zenmod3,1 point,Wed May 20 22:20:27 2015 UTC,Lion has it too.
TrueDoTA2,36o1zo,Consumption1,3,Thu May 21 01:20:01 2015 UTC,That seems like an extremely unlikely scenario
TrueDoTA2,36o1zo,Eldritch12,18,Wed May 20 20:31:24 2015 UTC,...and reflect the shackle back onto two heroes. simple
TrueDoTA2,36o1zo,MrAngryBeards,3,Wed May 20 20:33:08 2015 UTC,That's what Timbersaw said
TrueDoTA2,36o1zo,Eldritch12,0,Wed May 20 20:39:18 2015 UTC,"I think its a bug,  I had the same challenge as ES and it didn't register. I tried both blink fissure and blink totem but it didnt work"
TrueDoTA2,36o1zo,tiradium,1 point,Thu May 21 12:42:08 2015 UTC,Blink into Echoslam is the normal combo because Echoslam doesn't have a cast time. Did you try that?
TrueDoTA2,36o1zo,MagnusT,2,Thu May 21 13:01:56 2015 UTC,"It was actually saying blink and stun 3 enemies so I tried to either blink and enchant totem or fissure. Echoslam doesn't stun though, does it?"
TrueDoTA2,36o1zo,tiradium,3,Thu May 21 13:12:16 2015 UTC,Echo slam stuns the  exact same way enchant totem does...    Your passive.
TrueDoTA2,36o1zo,Ishmael_KingOfTheSea,2,Thu May 21 14:24:32 2015 UTC,Lol I am such a dumbass. Thanks for telling me about that I rarely play the hero and I already discarded the challenge. Muh coins
TrueDoTA2,36o1zo,tiradium,-1,Thu May 21 15:29:06 2015 UTC,"I got it too but with lion, looks like it it just chooses a random hero and doesn't take into account their skills."
TrueDoTA2,36o1zo,Apkoha,5,Wed May 20 21:35:06 2015 UTC,But you can get a two man stun with Lion
TrueDoTA2,36o1zo,eskaolin,7,Thu May 21 06:25:20 2015 UTC,I actually JUST finished this challenge. It worked completely fine for me with a blink-tornado combo. Not sure why it's not working for you.. Maybe just jump in another game and do it again.
TrueDoTA2,36o1zo,Po1r1er,1 point,Wed May 20 22:53:13 2015 UTC,"Okay, I'll give it another shot."
TrueDoTA2,36o1zo,occz,1 point,Wed May 20 23:01:18 2015 UTC,"Can confirm aswell: both tornado and deafening blast count (first game I tornadoed and later lost, second I deafening blasted and later won)."
TrueDoTA2,36o1zo,P373R1,6,Thu May 21 18:07:38 2015 UTC,Its clear they want more people to buy abyssal on invoker
TrueDoTA2,36o1zo,gu3st12,2,Wed May 20 21:32:29 2015 UTC,abyssal ac mjolner treads invoker. so smart.

TrueDoTA2,36o1zo,LaM3a,2,Thu May 21 06:25:18 2015 UTC,Phase boots + Aquila + MoM + Abyssal of course.
TrueDoTA2,36o1zo,cantadmittoposting,3,Thu May 21 15:05:56 2015 UTC,Does tornado or the disable from deafening blast count?
TrueDoTA2,36o1zo,cantadmittoposting,3,Wed May 20 20:04:06 2015 UTC,"Tornado doesn't count, and Deafening Blast is just a knockback."
TrueDoTA2,36o1zo,StopLurker,2,Wed May 20 20:06:06 2015 UTC,"I was just throwing it out since presumably it's possible, and those are disables at the least? Looks like abyssal  invoker time?"
TrueDoTA2,36o1zo,cathetertube,2,Wed May 20 20:16:41 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind that it says ""At once"". I can't do two heroes with seperate abilities, this isn't the first time I've gotten this challenge. with a character that has minimal stuns. (Windrunner)."
TrueDoTA2,36o1zo,ColumW,2,Wed May 20 20:18:53 2015 UTC,"I don't think it was to be at the exact same time though, just in quick succession.  One of the challenges is ""blink and stun 3 enemies as Tidehunter"" or something, Ravage needs time to travel outward so some enemies will be stunned before others.  So technically, if you blink, cold snap someone, and then immediately abyssal someone else, it may work"
TrueDoTA2,36o1zo,wildtarget13,3,Wed May 20 21:32:28 2015 UTC,Just tried blink > abyssal > cold snap. No dice.

TrueDoTA2,36o1zo,DasEnde7861,2,Wed May 20 22:33:27 2015 UTC,You could try Cold Snap + refresher?
