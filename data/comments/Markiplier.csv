Markiplier,3e22tc,gomotion100,7,Tue Jul 21 10:39:49 2015 UTC,those spammer people are getting out of hand:/ Hopefully Mark doesn't have to say that after every comment!
Markiplier,3e22tc,shadowofadeadgirl,7,Tue Jul 21 14:39:40 2015 UTC,Google really need to sort that out...
Markiplier,3e22tc,Ryonez,6,Tue Jul 21 20:04:00 2015 UTC,Can't someone report those fucking spammers?
Markiplier,3e22tc,Metalcentraldialog,6,Tue Jul 21 19:00:50 2015 UTC,I try to do it everytime I see it. I think if you have an account you can report any spam in the comments
Markiplier,3e32ae,Mdaybloom,2,Tue Jul 21 16:06:17 2015 UTC,"That touch at the end was really sweet.  Mostly posting to share this, Mark put it in the description.  Over things like that you had no control  A rock set in motion will continue to roll  No matter how hard you tug and heave  You were always pushed and forced to leave  Then one day you never returned  My tears so hot they almost burned  Aware now about what I lack  But crying and mourning wont bring you back.  Reddit won't let me format it correctly. I googled to find the source. This was the first thing to come up.    I appreciate when he puts in little touches like these for us. It's a very somber beautiful poem."

Markiplier,3dtn0p,harrison1017,2,Sun Jul 19 09:59:46 2015 UTC,"Mark made a whole new account in order to do it, likely with a new email set up specifically for his account. You might have to do this, too.  I don't know exactly how revenue works, but I believe there's a part of your page you can click on to access it and sign up. I think it's the upload page that has it, but I'm not sure.  Also, let me know when you get things started, I'd love to check out your videos!"

Markiplier,3dr4wg,Myusha123,3,Sat Jul 18 19:07:30 2015 UTC,I hope he feels better. And honestly it'd be amazeballs to see him play Inquisition. But I imagine that's not a game for the channel to enjoy. xP

He said that if he censors himself it makes the moments where he blows up and swears profusely even more funny. That makes sense to me, if he swore like a sailor all the time it wouldn't mean anything."

It really puts a smile on my face to know Hank knows of and appreciates Mark and what he does. :)  Side note, I didn't know Mark was going to Vidcon. This will be the first youtube specific convention he's been to I think. That should be interesting. It's July 23-25, that's less than a week away."
Markiplier,3do1qz,Mdaybloom,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:39:54 2015 UTC,"I'm excited for it because Mark is gonna be able to branch out and meet more non-gamers. I mean, he has a lot of non-gamers already but I think it will be interesting to see him more in the ""vlogging"" setting because he's not that large group. But yeah, Hankiplier would be awesome to see in a video, lol."
Markiplier,3do1qz,Mdaybloom,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:04:56 2015 UTC,"Agreed, it should be pretty cool. It's a great opportunity for him. :)  As for Hank and Mark making a video together, I don't have high hopes. Mark usually only does videos with his friends. Which is cool with me. I just think it's cool that someone as accomplished as Hank recognizes Mark's accomplishments. But yeah, it would be awesome."

Markiplier,3datn0,WellKnownSecrets,2,Wed Jul 15 00:44:09 2015 UTC,Actually to contrary it was one of the best days of my life. My sister got engaged at PAX south at his panel and he is an amazing person. So genuine and kind
Markiplier,3datn0,CapnAngie,7,Wed Jul 15 19:53:01 2015 UTC,"Met him at SDCC last week. It seemed he had a decent amount of people coming so I didn't want to hold him up. However, he's so energetic. The people in front of us wanted him to sign a couple things, and he was talking about his limit, but agreed to do so anyways. He kept calling the kid greedy, it was cute and Mark-like. When the piles of comics next to him were falling, he would tell people to fix it, not like, harshly, but in a more comedic manner. As I've mentioned in a previous submission, the guy is dedicated to his fans, pretty down to earth from what I saw. I wish I had said more to him but I was kinda starstruck. He's a great guy, pretty approachable & humble."
Markiplier,3datn0,Mdaybloom,6,Wed Jul 15 02:54:40 2015 UTC,I did at Indy Popcon. It was kinda brief as they were trying to meet as many people as they could. They all were very nice and seemed very happy to meet with fans. I wrote about my meeting them here in excessive amounts of detail if you're interested.
Markiplier,3daw22,tryingMyBest001,7,Tue Jul 14 21:15:44 2015 UTC,There's no real rhyme or reason to contact him. He's only 1 person and people act like there's a super secret way to reach him.

Markiplier,3daw22,KingOfElysium,2,Thu Jul 16 22:06:39 2015 UTC,The best way honestly is to go to a con he is at and go to his signing other than that emailing tumble or twitter are the only ways to talk to him sorry

Markiplier,3d5js4,KingOfElysium,2,Tue Jul 14 07:21:51 2015 UTC,That was so cute. :) I like the call back Mark did to his Comi Con 2013 vlog by asking people what their favorite thing about the channel was.    I recognize the girl with the ukulele from Tumblr. Here's a video from her meeting Mark that she put up on her blog. It's really sweet. :)
Markiplier,3d2dzd,Mdaybloom,10,Sun Jul 12 23:44:45 2015 UTC,Fine. We'll just go make our own convention. With blackjack. And hookers!

Markiplier,3d2dzd,lady_ninane,8,Mon Jul 13 02:25:57 2015 UTC,"Having just got done working comic-con myself, let me just say that:   The entire place was packed tighter than a can of sardines. There were other booths around the area. Almost all of them had lines but it was apparent that Red Giant was one of the most popular in the tiny area jam packed with people. In fact it was very busy for a Sunday according to people who have been there longer than I have and had more than one other year to compare it with. There was no way around it.  It's comic-con A.K.A (as someone else I was standing next to in a cut off panel line with put it) ""Line simulator 2015."" Paranoid fire marshals have a right to be paranoid with that many packed-in people. Especially that close to closing and the rush to vacate the building so things can be taken down and packed up on time. I was at the panel. When he announced that he was going to be doing last minute visits I knew the line was going to be bigger than all other days (including Saturday) combined. Seriously, I did laps around the building multiple times and and every single time sans like Wednesday there was a line around the booth. That mixed with the con ending in like 15 minutes, something like this was sadly a possibility."

Markiplier,3d2dzd,KingOfElysium,0,Mon Jul 13 09:55:17 2015 UTC,This sucks. I hate to think how many people got cut off because of this. I expect Mark to provide more details in tomorrows vlog. I hope it was nothing too serious.

Markiplier,3cx7t4,FouxFhang,3,Sat Jul 11 18:25:55 2015 UTC,"Aww, I'm sorry to hear that's what happened in your case :( I honestly got lucky that my friend spotted him because my short self could hardly see around the people walking about me. Thank you though!"
Markiplier,3cx7t4,FouxFhang,2,Sat Jul 11 18:35:59 2015 UTC,Heh he wore the same shirt on the first day of indy pop con. Me and a friend did a warfstache duo cosplay. He was really excited to see us both cosplay. Soooo many people there tho.
Markiplier,3cx7t4,FouxFhang,1 point,Sun Jul 12 00:36:06 2015 UTC,Nice! Was there really? I honestly wasn't really sure how I dealt with all the people at Comic Con my friends and I had to basically hold onto each other and start a train to get through the crowds without losing each other.

Markiplier,3d03gq,LimoneBlu,7,Sun Jul 12 10:20:19 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I think something went wrong during editing. I think he records his games and reactions at the same time, but I could be wrong. Maybe he was editing in a hurry before going to SDCC? Atleast, that's what I like to think.  EDIT: He says on twitter: Sorry about the out of sync video, I'm currently at Comic Con and can't fix. It was fine when I edited last night :/"
Markiplier,3d03gq,monalona,4,Sun Jul 12 10:49:34 2015 UTC,"He posted on his twitter that the video was out of sync, so it was probably just a processing error and he didn't have time to fix it before leaving for SDCC.  EDIT: Link to the twitter post"
Markiplier,3d03gq,darkrilin,3,Sun Jul 12 10:51:55 2015 UTC,"A common way to record these videos is to record the audio and video separately. I've been trying to make some videos, and have been using this method. So, it does leave plenty of room for syncing errors. It's a pain in the butt."
Markiplier,3d03gq,Jenicsaco,1 point,Sun Jul 12 14:35:18 2015 UTC,"He definitely records them at the same time, just with two separate programs. Sync errors happen, and it's amazing that it hasn't happened before with the amount of videos he has! I guess he just pays that much attention to detail. :)  But chances are you WILL see it again, it's just a factor of life when it comes to editing and making videos. I'm sure Mark'll just fix it again when it happens though. n.n"
Markiplier,3czuts,EpicGeek77,3,Sun Jul 12 07:47:31 2015 UTC,A link would be nice
Markiplier,3czuts,Iammaybeasliceofpie,3,Sun Jul 12 10:17:06 2015 UTC,Found the image OP is talking about. OP please include a link in your post next time.
Markiplier,3czuts,Mdaybloom,0,Sun Jul 12 16:03:09 2015 UTC,On my Kindle and I couldn't.t get a link unfortunately
Markiplier,3czuts,glados131,2,Mon Jul 13 02:51:47 2015 UTC,"Dang it, I was crossing my fingers for Maes Hughes."
Markiplier,3cvvgd,Catorak,8,Sat Jul 11 05:18:56 2015 UTC,"I hate to agree with you but I do. He seems so different now to how he used to. I watched his Timore video a few hours ago and I liked him so much in that.   But Mark has gone through a lot of small changes in his time on YouTube, so maybe he'll go back to his older self a bit more. I'm sure that if it's not just us who feel this way, he'll notice."
Markiplier,3cvvgd,Need_a_Ladder,2,Sat Jul 11 12:28:25 2015 UTC,"Maybe, but I can't hope for that. It's his channel and he will do what he wants with it. That's the way it should be. If he is enjoying what he's doing then great! I tried to word this as best I could so it didn't seem like I was faulting him for this, it's just the way things are now I guess."
Markiplier,3cvvgd,Casen_,6,Sat Jul 11 17:51:51 2015 UTC,I just want to see more longer lets plays of games like Dead Space. Those were fantastic go watch.
Markiplier,3cvvgd,stachldrat,7,Sat Jul 11 14:52:45 2015 UTC,I still enjoy his content but what's really been bugging me is how it seems to become more and more of a habit for him now to just cut the 'relevant' parts together and leave out the gameplay in the middle. I hated that about PewDiePie - among other things - and the fact that Mark didn't do this was one of the things that made me appreciate his videos.
Markiplier,3cvvgd,TheNiffles,1 point,Sat Jul 11 15:59:01 2015 UTC,"I totally feel you. I've been dying to see him start an actual LP but we haven't seen one since Evil Within, I think. Hundreds of one-off's in between actual content just doesn't do it for me.  Edit: Grammar"
Markiplier,3cvvgd,geckogirl191,5,Sat Jul 11 17:52:58 2015 UTC,"Actually I want to ammend what I first said. Mark, as a person, hasn't changed very much. I think people are resistant to the whole ""Marks Changed"" argument because its like we are saying he's somehow become worse. Mark hasn't changed, the content has. I subscribed for his content and his personality. Over the past year I feel that we arent getting his thoughts, opinions, and theory's out of an LP like we used to. The videos have been short and impersonal and THATS what's changed."
Markiplier,3cvvgd,geckogirl191,3,Sun Jul 12 02:10:19 2015 UTC,"It's a bit of a bummer to see a fellow fan go, but I can completely understand your reasoning. There's a plethora of different reasons why people watch someone's Let's Plays. Some watch them for the gameplay (likely so they can see what the game's really like before they'll want to purchase it, or to learn more about the game's certain aspects), whilst others watch them for the player (in this case for Markiplier's personality, reactions and jokes). I will admit, Mark's most recent video on ""The Arm"" was pretty boring and, granted, not all of his videos can be winners but, personally, the reason I didn't unsubscribe is because I was more interested in the player (Markiplier) than in the games (not that all of the games he played were uninteresting or unworthy of attention). Now, Mark is starting to do his own thing more and more without feeling too pressured by his fanbase, and I can see how some people might be turned off by this change.  It must have been a rough choice to make, but you ultimately chose what you felt was true to yourself, and I wouldn't want to take that away from you."
Markiplier,3cvvgd,FabbrizioCalamitous,1 point,Sat Jul 11 12:12:25 2015 UTC,"You're 100% right. Like I said I'm super happy that what he's doing is working for him. With the way his shtick has shifted it just doesn't appeal to me anymore. I'm interested in more mature, topical humor. (i.e Game Grumps with Erin and Dan or Two Best Friends Play) I hope it doesn't sound like I think Mark is wrong for what's taken place, that's not it at all. It just doesn't fit well for me anymore."
Markiplier,3cvvgd,Mdaybloom,1 point,Sat Jul 11 17:57:32 2015 UTC,"I don't think you're being harsh on Mark there.  The thing is, Game Grumps and Two Best Friends Play involve more than one player. When they converse and exchange opinions and/or jokes during gameplay, this creates juxtaposition, which makes for engaging (and often hilarious) conversations to listen to for most people. Markiplier's Let's Plays are more of a one-man show, which doesn't leave much wiggle room for juxtaposition. However, he does try to compensate for this through giving his audience a sense of community by reaching out as often as possible."
Markiplier,3cvvgd,FouxFhang,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:10:05 2015 UTC,"Game Grumps... Mature humor... are we thinking of the same Game Grumps?  I mean I love their videos and give me many laughs every single day, but let's be entirely fair here. Mature humor is not a word that describes them."
Markiplier,3cvvgd,Kartyac,1 point,Mon Jul 13 07:46:23 2015 UTC,That's how I would describe it. Their jokes and banter aren't meant for the same demographic that Mark has been aiming for. Erin and Dan clearly put out content for an older audience in their own age group by playing classic games; their dialogue is in no way meant for kids.
Markiplier,3cvvgd,HappyNarga,14,Mon Jul 13 13:45:26 2015 UTC,"It feels like we get posts like this every few weeks. Which is fine, but they never personally make any sense to me.  This week has been short on game play content because Mark is at a convention. So soon after Indy Popcon, it makes sense that there would be some silly videos thrown in to pan out the schedule. Even so he only finished The Evil Within: The Assignment DLC  a few days ago. Regardless, as far as I can tell he's always played low quality indie games. I just scrolled back to a year ago on his channel and found Safari Showdown, Double Hitler, Extreme Treadmill Survival. It's just something he's always done.  It bothers me more than it should when people say stuff like this. It's perfectly okay for you to stop watching if you don't enjoy his videos anymore. But maybe consider the possibility that your tastes have changed, rather then there being anything inherently worse about his content now."
Markiplier,3cvvgd,Elderberrian,2,Sat Jul 11 12:26:15 2015 UTC,"I'm not the only one who feels this way, me and my friend were talking about this. Marks last really good long let's play was to the moon, I was crying and such. But lately he's been playing these super quick easy indie games, which aren't all bad it's good for a quick laugh. Maybe his promise to upload two videos a day is making his work load too much. So that's why he opts out to quick easy indie games as he can crank those out quickly. I dunno but I hope he gets out of this funk soon."
Markiplier,3cvvgd,a_jill_sandwich,2,Sun Jul 12 00:40:19 2015 UTC,"I only discovered Markiplier a couple weeks ago, but I feel like his Let's Play videos are much less serious than when he first started. I thoroughly enjoyed his older videos, especially his play-through of Amnesia. Sure there were plenty of snarky comments, but it felt like he was actually playing the game. His older videos had a more serious atmosphere which made it easier for me to become immersed in the game.  In some of his more recent videos, I get this feeling that he's just saying as many ""lol so randum xD"" things while playing a game in a background. I don't really mind it in the more light-hearted games that he plays, but I really wish he would be a little more serious while playing the more serious games.   One of the more recent examples I can think of is Fatal Frame 2. I couldn't watch further than the first couple of videos because all he was doing was constantly spewing random bullshit whenever he wasn't in a ""battle."" Not only that, but he had to read the comments to even realize that he could even upgrade his camera and change film types. Did he ever realize that the camera filament thing in the bottom right hand corner of the screen was basically the ""there's a ghost in the direction you're facing"" indicator? These seem like basic things that you'd pick up on right away while playing a game, but he didn't which gives me the feeling that he wasn't actively trying to comprehend the game. Instead of thinking about the game he was playing, he was thinking about the next lulzy thing he could say.   Nevertheless, I will be looking forward to his playthrough of SOMA, and will watch his playthrough as soon as I finish mine. I sincerely hope he sets a more serious tone in his SOMA series by focusing on the gameplay and the story rather than his next witty comment.  TLDR: srs game = srs face"
Markiplier,3cvvgd,Elderberrian,2,Sun Jul 12 23:18:02 2015 UTC,"I guess not all of us can keep watching without feeling like a little something has faded from Mark's channel. So long then, I hope you enjoyed the time you spent watching our lovable doof, and if you ever decide to come back, it'll be to open arms."
Markiplier,3cvvgd,TheNiffles,2,Sun Jul 12 01:38:06 2015 UTC,"Hate to say it but I kind of agree with you.  Mark is by far one of my favorite youtubers, since I found his channel in early 2013 and watching his channel grow from then 100,000 to 8 million and watching his content daily I've noticed a change in his commentary style and quality.  I'm not saying that the quality of his videos have gone downhill, if anything its obvious that he's working harder on it more then ever.  I'll always support the charity livestreams he does but for daily content I've been looking for other channels and unfortunately can't really find anything as entertaining.  Oh well look like I'll have to venture ... outside ... and do something out there ..."
Markiplier,3cvvgd,BecomeTheKnight,2,Sat Jul 11 07:09:34 2015 UTC,"If you're looking for something to watch, I've been enjoying MattShea and his Facade LP these last couple of days. He's doing a Yandere Simulator LP too."

Markiplier,3cvvgd,Iammaybeasliceofpie,2,Sun Jul 12 02:56:10 2015 UTC,I totally get this. Marks play through from last year were so much more chill. We went on a journey together and it wasnt just a string of edited reactions. I feel like he's become a caricature over the last year.
Markiplier,3cvvgd,carioXX,1 point,Sat Jul 11 23:42:00 2015 UTC,I'm sorry to hear that man :/ I can definitely see where you're coming from. I think he'll take it back to where it used to be eventually. May take some time though...
Markiplier,3cvvgd,Iammaybeasliceofpie,1 point,Sat Jul 11 22:06:35 2015 UTC,"I personally feel like he hasn't necessarily pandered to a demographic, but he has adjusted accordingly. Let me explain why I'm sad I don't enjoy his content but I'm still happy with him. I, when I first got into Youtube gaming content, loved him. He was funny, uncensored, talked about mechanics, etc. Over time, he expanded, and his subscription base diversified. Nowadays I feel like he creates a very basic level on content and censors himself to an agreeable person. This makes it so I do not enjoy his content as I feel like it isn't the person I loved to watch, but there are things to consider. The younger portion of his fanbase are very devoted and he becomes an outlet and relief for kids who do not have one. I feel like his shift of content has been out of love for his audience who is so very thankful for him. Between his donations and love for his audience (view his million mark videos,) I feel like he has changed his channel despite what I'd like, and that's ok. You do you Mark."
Markiplier,3cvvgd,carioXX,-2,Wed Jul 15 01:17:04 2015 UTC,I honoustly just watch the video's for his personality. He could stare at a brick wall for 3 hours straight and I'd watch it probably. I'm personally not that bothered by it.

Markiplier,3clpjx,geckogirl191,6,Sat Jul 11 01:53:32 2015 UTC,"That depends on the way you love him.  Being gay means being sexually attracted to the same gender as you. If you find yourself in love with someone like Markiplier but don't feel that you want to be particularly intimate with him, then that's not exactly gay. It just means you find him attractive in a way that's not necessarily sexual. As a male, you can still be in love with another male and not be gay.  Besides, there's nothing wrong with being gay at all. We're in a generation where non-hetero orientations are becoming more accepted."
Markiplier,3clpjx,smittenimp92,2,Thu Jul 9 01:37:26 2015 UTC,Not necessarily. I mean are you just in love with what he stands for and the happiness he gives you or is it more like 'holy cow I could totally see me and him settling down together and being happy together for the rest of our lives' love?
Markiplier,3clpjx,CallMeCaliban,2,Thu Jul 9 10:58:27 2015 UTC,"Feelings and behaviors don't have their own sexualities. People have sexualities - and if yours includes Mark, that's fine! That doesn't make you gay, or mean you have to start defining yourself in a certain way or using a certain term for your feelings. You are who you are, and you care about who you care about. In my opinion, that just makes you human."
Markiplier,3clpjx,fortyb4five1,1 point,Thu Jul 9 06:41:14 2015 UTC,"Yes its gay to be ""in love"" with him if you're male. If you love him then thats completely different."

Needless to say, Markiplier got me into Minecraft. a game that i used to say ""why would anyone find this fun?"" about. It may not have been a HUGE change in my life, but Markiplier changed my life. He has also shown me what life can be like if you're just a little kinder, a little friendlier, and a little more open to new people and new experiences.

Also I understand about the changing your life thing he has really helped me to not be so down and to smile he has a way of just bringing people back and making them feel like it isn't so bad
Markiplier,3ci64d,shord143,3,Wed Jul 8 17:17:56 2015 UTC,"It was some fnaf episode, can't remember exactly now.   I literally didn't understand what he was saying/screaming. English isn't my native language, and his accent didn't do it for me. It was okay after I watched some episodes which he talked clearer though."
Markiplier,3ci64d,InksieDaisy,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:43:41 2015 UTC,Cool what is your native language?

Markiplier,3ci64d,Mdaybloom,2,Wed Jul 8 11:04:10 2015 UTC,"The original Octodad. Someone linked to it and I watched it because I was bored. I thought he was pretty funny and had a good laugh at his rendition of Going the Distance, but I ended up forgetting about him for awhile. Mostly because it was during my ""why would anyone want to watch other people play video games?"" phase."

I have no idea why I thought that'd be a good idea since I'm a big chicken, but it was really great and scary games are a lot less scary watching Markiplier play. c:  I can't remember what my first reaction was except that for some reason I thought he was married and had a kid."

I had this assumption that they were all obnoxious Pewdiepie clones.   I found him again through Fnaf. I only really got into his videos during fnaf 2 as I found myself binge watching a lot of his stuff between parts. After watching OFF I had to subscribe, and after watching through his vlogs Markiplier became my favorite channel."

Markiplier,3ci64d,TheCourier666,2,Wed Jul 8 09:21:40 2015 UTC,"My first video was his FNAF 3 Aggressive Nightmare Mode Completion, just because I was looking around FNAF 3 videos (I'm not one of those obsessed kids, thank God) so I just browsed a few more of his videos and he was pretty funny and seemed to have a nice personality.   Naturally, I watched his Draw My Life, and that showed me how much he had been through, but at this point, I had seen so many other YouTubers' Draw My Life that it didn't affect me as much as it should've.   What really did it for me was the 6 Million Reaction video. I honestly didn't remember the last time I saw a YouTuber cry. I'm an emotional person, and I was close to crying in that video, but I didn't. I saw a different aspect of him. A side willing to show vulnerability to his audience. That's what made me start to fall deeply in love with him.   I'm pretty new to this community (joined at 6 mn) but I already feel like I've known him for ages. I have a feeling he'll be my favorite YouTuber for a very long time."
Markiplier,3ci64d,TheCourier666,2,Wed Jul 8 11:45:15 2015 UTC,I cried during all of those but I am a very emotional person and Mark has helped me through a lot so seeing how much he cares always makes me cry
Markiplier,3ci64d,SaiyanSquad,2,Wed Jul 8 17:14:33 2015 UTC,I think it was Amnesia or maybe Minecraft. The first thing I thought was that his hair looked like that one guy from Yu Gi Oh because it was so angular.
Markiplier,3ci64d,SaiyanSquad,1 point,Wed Jul 8 11:53:51 2015 UTC,That is amazing! He does have very anime ish hair when he grows it out lol
Markiplier,3ci64d,SaiyanSquad,2,Wed Jul 8 17:13:04 2015 UTC,"I'd seen FNAF screenshots on Tumblr and was curious as to what it was, so I Youtubed it; Mark's Let's Play was the first thing that came up. About a week later I'd managed to watch a good 75% of his backlog.  My initial thoughts were ""wow, this guy has a great voice and I love listening to him"". But by the end of the first week, I realised he was just a genuinely nice guy who likes entertaining people, and I've been watching him ever since."
Markiplier,3ci64d,Ging287,2,Wed Jul 8 12:28:13 2015 UTC,Ive heard of a lot of people who showed up during fnaf it's awesome he was top of the list during that game
Markiplier,3ci64d,FouxFhang,2,Wed Jul 8 17:11:55 2015 UTC,"I don't really remember, I saw his older videos back during g the whole YouTube horror let's play boom, didn't think much of him then, then when FNAF came out, I found myself coming back every day to see mark complete nights.   Then I really got a feel for Mark as a person when I saw hid DML video, starting catching his monthly Saturday streams whenever I could, and I watch whatever vids he releases daily.  It's kind of funny, usually Mark picks games that I'm playing and I'll completely put my own playthrough on hold to watch it with his commentary, even at the cost of spoiling it for myself, for example, I got The Evil Within and Alien Isolation about a week before Mark started playing them, and I still haven't gone back because watching mark play the games was good enough in my opinion.  My opinion of him now, he's one of my favourite youtubers, it doesn't hurt that Mark seems like a pretty genuine dude, he interacts well with his fans and I've put quite a few of my friends on to his videos, nothing but good things to say.   I've also been watching Bob, Wade, Yamimash and Jacks vids because of Mark, so there's that."
Markiplier,3ci64d,FriendlyHeavy,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:25:25 2015 UTC,I have never met a more genuine person even when something upsets him he let's you know while still keeping his cool I love how real he is
Markiplier,3ci64d,holdtheolives,2,Wed Jul 8 17:10:49 2015 UTC,"It was an indie horror game that for the life of me I can't find anymore, I really want to watch it again. I just remember one part of it, he was behind some bars and you could see the monsters glowing eyes just beyond it. It was a low poly 3-D game."
Markiplier,3ci64d,BecomeTheKnight,2,Wed Jul 8 14:52:01 2015 UTC,Is it possibly Mark's playthrough of The Room?  Other options might be The Lost Souls or 7 Days. That style was pretty popular among Indie Game Developers during 2013.

They've been watching his videos together since they first started dating, and Markiplier quotes and references have become a mode of shorthand communication for them. Kasumi may not remember the word ""frustrated"" every time she wants to use it in English, but ""Wheeeeeere's the blaaacksmiiith?!"" gets the same point across to her husband. Ricky and I are both ESL teachers, but we're only half-kidding when we joke that Mark's better at teaching her English than either of us.   All three of us have been there for each other through some crazy ups and downs in life, and personally I owe both of them a lot. I also think they're a great example of the kind of borders Mark and this community are crossing, and the way that something as simple as watching a guy play video games in his underwear can be a building block for something as huge and wonderful as a marriage like theirs."

Markiplier,3bipfr,Mdaybloom,2,Mon Jun 29 15:34:08 2015 UTC,"Sorry this is kinda out dated. I just got back from Indy Popcon and I was surprised that no one had posted it yet.   The concept is not really unique, but you can absolutely tell all the hard work they put into it. Not to mention how cool it is to hear Mark sing as the leading voice. Those lessons are paying off and he sounds great. I found the whole song very catchy and I'll definitely be listing to it. :)  Speaking of Indy popcon, would any of you guys be on board making a discussion thread about it? It's a kinda silly idea since we haven't had one for any other convention I know. The whole event was so crazy, I'd really appreciate being able to talk with some people about it. Alternately we could go over here. Use the twitch chat as a chat room to talk about it. Whatever works.   To those that weren't there, if you have any questions at all about it I'd be more than willing to answer. I realize that's pretty egotistical of me, sorry. I just want any excuse to talk about it, because it's all that I can think about right now."
Markiplier,3bipfr,CallMeCaliban,2,Mon Jun 29 16:01:45 2015 UTC,"Color me an excuse to talk about it! Did you get to meet Mark? How did it go? Was there anything about the experience that was really different than what you expected? I'm always curious about people's personal experiences at events, so bring on the details!"
Markiplier,3bipfr,CallMeCaliban,3,Tue Jun 30 14:00:09 2015 UTC,"Thank you! :) I'll go through your questions in order.  I did! I got to meet Mark, Bob, Wade, and Jack for about thirty seconds each. After a accumulative six hour wait in line. But it was completely worth it. Just to thank them in person for everything they do means so much.   They all are so nice and completely genuine. I didn't really talk to Mark as much as I talked at him, I just had so much I needed to say. He was very nice about it, ""I'm glad I could help,"" Is about the only word he got in before I had to move on to Bob.   He was very nice, I remember my conversation with him better. He said ""How are you?"" and I said ""Incredible!"" ""After so long in line you're still incredible?"" ""If I'm exhausted I can't imagine how you guys feel."" ""No, we're just sitting here"" and I think I just blurted out ""You're hilarious"" and he was kinda like, not really but thank you, and I thanked him and moved on to Wade.  Wade was so cool. I told him I was at his first charity live stream. He immediately said ""Thank you so much"" and pulled me into a hug. I started talking about how amazing it was. For those who weren't there, the fundraising goal was five thousand dollars for the whole twelve hour stream, and by the end we had nearly tripled that. It was such a mind blowing thing to be apart of. I think I worried him right before I moved on to Jack. I said ""I just stumbled into it through an email notification and it was the best night of my entire life."" He kind of gave me a sad look. I didn't mean to make him feel bad for me, but I don't regret saying it because it was absolutely true.  Jack is awesome! He seemed high energy compared to the rest of them, as he was standing up and smiling all the time. I said ""Thank you so much"" and he said ""You don't need to thank me. I enjoy making videos."" I responded that I have to, because your videos have helped me through such an incredibly hard time and I'm so Grateful, it means the absolute world to me. He smiled even more and said ""Well thank you so much. It was nice to meet you!"" I said in an awkward feeling way, that it was very nice to meet him too.    Was there anything about the experience that was really different than what you expected?   Yeah, I think I'm going to sort it out into three cheesy named categories.   The Good  Tyler was so awesome! While the guys were pinned down at the signing table, Tyler was busy hanging out through out the line, taking pictures with people, signing things, and just generally being cool. I was really impressed that despite being new, he was so passionate about supporting people and good causes. He seemed thrilled to be there. A quote from him that I don't think was recorded that warmed my heart was, ""I can't be stone faced, you guys keep making me smile."" He's @Apocalypto_12 on twitter I would recommend that you follow him, he's a great guy.  The Bad  There were a lot of awful mismanagements on the con staffs part. Lot's of miscommunication, bad planning, and broken promises lead to many people getting screwed over. I was very lucky. Many of the staff were working there hardest, but there were so many goof ups that ruined peoples experiences, it was really inexcusable. I suspect it was mostly because Indy Popcon was a small convention only last year, and Mark in Jack blew up the attendance numbers in a way that they just weren't prepared to deal with. I felt just horrible for the many people I talked to who came from all over the country only never get to talk to any of the crew even once.  The Ugly  There was one time on Sunday where a mob formed around Mark, Bob, Wade, and Jack. It was right after the signing closed, they all had to get going. But it took almost an hour for security to clear a path for them to escape. People were shouting things at them and taking pictures. They seemed to handle it very well, but it was honestly very scary.   Sorry for writing an essay. Thank you for letting me gush.  edit. The ugly may not be very accurate after doing a little research. It really wasn't as bad as it looked from the outside."
Markiplier,3bipfr,Sathoren,2,Tue Jun 30 17:41:50 2015 UTC,"Tyler was there? That's so cool! I have a soft spot for that guy - he reminds me A LOT of one of my best friends from high school. I also think he's really cool for diving right into this stuff with Mark at this stage in the game - it's gotta be surreal when two buddies from your hometown somehow become internet sensations with six-hour lines full of people who can't wait to meet them, but it sounds like he's having a great time being part of the LP crew and embracing the whole experience. Hope you got to say hi to him!  As for the bad part, that really sucks. Here's hoping Indy Popcon learns from the experience this time around, and uses what went wrong this time to get things running smoothly in the future. It's always the fans that suffer the most from dumb organizational disasters. Mark seemed pretty offended by that rude sign they put up, himself.  Glad the ugly part wasn't as bad as it seemed, though! I spent some time in the music industry abroad, and it's nuts how quickly scenes like that can get out of hand - but they often do look a lot worse from the outside than they seem to the people at the center of them. Some performers develop their own tricks for settling down big crowds over time, as well, and I bet that the more experience Mark & Co. get with this kind of thing, the better they'll get at helping the security staff help them.   But overall, it sounds like you had an incredible experience! Your two minutes with the guys sounds well worth the six hours. Did you meet some cool people in line while you were waiting? I am going to cheerfully envy your hug from Wade for a while! All of those guys seem like such great people, and I get so excited when people have a good experience meeting them in person. Thank you for gushing!"

Markiplier,3bfoa6,smittenimp92,2,Mon Jun 29 10:47:29 2015 UTC,Thats awesome! My only suggestion is if you want to see Mark make sure you show up HOURS in advance and I mean like 3-5 to get in line and if the line isn't open for him wait because there are so many people and lines get capped fast

Markiplier,3b1pwk,DaBendyCindy,2,Thu Jun 25 06:55:12 2015 UTC,What? Yes? Why do you ask?
Markiplier,3b1pwk,Mdaybloom,2,Thu Jun 25 17:09:55 2015 UTC,"He does. If you would like to check out one of Mark's spoons, you can do so here.  That may be the weirdest statement I have ever typed, but there you go."
Markiplier,3avv2q,PsichoBrony,5,Tue Jun 23 22:33:17 2015 UTC,"That's a really good question. I hope he does. I'd love to see his reactions to it. Might not be his type of game, though. From what I remember he hasn't done any episodic games of this genre."
Markiplier,3avv2q,monalona,2,Tue Jun 23 23:55:42 2015 UTC,"He said he wouldn't during the livestream, I think. He said it's because he heard they were similar to The Walking Dead games, and he really didn't like that kind of game."
Markiplier,3avv2q,Mdaybloom,2,Wed Jun 24 03:05:31 2015 UTC,"Well, that's a bummer. Thanks for the reply!"
Markiplier,3avv2q,Mdaybloom,2,Wed Jun 24 03:19:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah sorry, let me give you an alternate recommendation. Have you watched Jacksepticeye's play through of Life is Strange? He's playing the game as it comes out."
Markiplier,3avv2q,Vallavi,3,Wed Jun 24 03:34:58 2015 UTC,Oh don't worry mate. I'm already watching his playtrough :)
Markiplier,3avv2q,SloventotheMax,1 point,Wed Jun 24 03:49:39 2015 UTC,It's a shame that he won't. The general mood and storytelling of the game kept me completely distracted from the gameplay. It's honestly my game of the year.

Markiplier,3auc3j,SloventotheMax,2,Tue Jun 23 18:01:29 2015 UTC,"When they get affected or get a fever of some sort you can play the sound of the guy saying SUPER HOT in one of the game demos he has played. As a quick relief from the symptoms, you can press B to blow, but it wouldn't be enough to cure the infected.  Try not to make the sounds or whatever (not sure how the game will be) be too repetitive because it can get annoying and I do see him get annoyed by the sounds of his voice used as attacks in fan-made games. If you make it ridiculous enough to the point of hilarity then I think Mark will love it :)"

You, with every nice comment, with every good intention, make this community the wonderful place it is. I'm floored daily that we can be so large an yet still do such incredible things. It's no accident, it wouldn't happen without you.   It's kinda like, ""No raindrop thinks it's responsible for the flood,"" only now it's a good thing.  Thank you."

Markiplier,3aqt1b,YouGotDoddified,11,Mon Jun 22 20:55:08 2015 UTC,Tears man..
Markiplier,3aqt1b,stonecrusher13,19,Mon Jun 22 20:00:41 2015 UTC,"He's an amazing person... seriously. I'm a fairly new subscriber of him and I really enjoy his let's plays. He's so incredibly genuine and the ending had me in tears. Hell, I cried during the whole video!    edit: not sure why I got downvoted but that's okay. Just stating I think he's a really great person. :)"
Markiplier,3aqt1b,Caerum,10,Mon Jun 22 20:06:35 2015 UTC,"I'm a long time subscriber and I got emotional from beginning to end. I saw the original at 1 AM and once Emma's song at the end started, I just couldn't take it.  Mark is such an incredible human being just for being there. I have gone through really, really tough time the entire time I've been subbed to him and he never ceases to brighten my days up. I hope you have fun watching his videos and you stay subscribed."
Markiplier,3aqt1b,ClockFaceIII,5,Mon Jun 22 20:34:50 2015 UTC,"Man, I always just lose it as soon as he starts crying. It really hits me harder than I expect everytime. Mark is a genuine article and I'm glad he strives to acknowledge and talk to the fandom as much as he does.   He's good people."
Markiplier,3aqt1b,Doc_LaVoy,3,Mon Jun 22 21:29:27 2015 UTC,He's real.
Markiplier,3aqt1b,TerraChron,6,Tue Jun 23 11:44:43 2015 UTC,"He's right. I've been up all night thinking about how right he is, and I still don't have the words for what I really wish I could say.  What's infinitely more important than supporting him at this point is the support we show each other. This has all gotten too big for one guy to manage on his own. If we all want it work, we have got to take the same kind of responsibility for each other's well-being as Mark does for all of us.  And I know that it's scary. It's natural to appreciate the light that someone brings into your life. It's much, much more difficult to understand yourself as a light source every bit as valuable and capable as the one which gave you something that you couldn't give yourself.   But I feel like that's what he's really asking us to do, here. I feel like that's where he could really, honestly use our help. He's asking us to do exactly what he does, and to trust that we can be the one to make someone else smile, or laugh, or think a little differently about themselves, or just know that they're loved.   I have seen this happen before - and I have seen it turn out in the best way possible. I have seen one guy with a guitar break down as a human being, and be gutted by the fact that he can't be there for every one of us personally, and ask for the help that Mark's asking for here - and I have seen people who never thought fuck-all of themselves a day in their lives rise to the occasion, and become someone else's Markiplier. I've seen people with wide open wounds on their hearts become fucking superheroes in their own lives, and the lives of others. They didn't heal to do it. They didn't change to do it. They just wanted to help so fucking badly that they helped.   It works. What he's asking for is something that every single one of us has in us. I wish I could find a way to climb through computer screens and share just how strongly I believe this with everyone, heart to heart. He is absolutely, positively, 100% asking for the very thing this community has in them to give to each other - and it's the thing that makes all the difference in the world.   I am not a perfect person. I am impatient and snarky and people not being accepting of other people makes me so fucking angry that it's hard for me to be accepting of them, sometimes. I can be mean and shitty and bossy and a total pain in the ass - but I love humans. I love Mark, I love you guys, I love that guy with the guitar and the family we're both part of. Being flawed myself doesn't make my good intentions any less genuine, or an excuse not to share the good things I do have to give with the people who need them.   That's all Mark's doing, and that's all he's asking of us. We have it in us to take care of each other, no matter how faulted we are or how many mistakes we make along the way. This is about millions of people. Mark is one of them, and his place in the community will always be special and unique - but so is my place, and your place, and everyone else's.   We can all do this. I believe in us."
Markiplier,3aqt1b,CallMeCaliban,6,Tue Jun 23 15:32:28 2015 UTC,"I'm just going to repost what I did as a comment on this video if you guys don't mind:     Hey Mark,  I know you probably won't read this but regardless, I just wanted to share my gratitude toward you and this whole project.  I played a small part in the creation of this when I submitted my video to it and just knowing that myself and this generous group of people were able to invoke so many emotions out of you and all your fans is pretty surreal.  I feel simultaneously delighted and heartbroken by the reaction you shared with us. I really feel like you opened up to your fans in a way no one has ever seen before and showing us that vulnerability really put things into perspective as to how you feel about having such a huge fanbase.  The part where you broke down about how you can't know every one of us individually really spoke to me and I just want you to know that even though that is the case, you have impacted all your fans in unique and individual ways. So despite the fact that you may not know us all personally, you've definitely done your share of reaching out to all of us in different ways.  Please remember to always take care of yourself and just be proud of the fact that you've created a fanbase so involved with each other that we can provide each other with help whenever we're in times of desperate need.   Thank you for creating one of the most special and welcoming fanbases I've ever been a part of, Mark. I really, truly mean it."
Markiplier,3aqt1b,ThatAwkwardGinger,4,Tue Jun 23 05:39:55 2015 UTC,"Not gonna lie, but the part when he talks about not being able to help all of his subscribers just broke me. I never wanted him to see him that upset over something and it broke my heart. No one should feel that kind of responsibility and yet Mark does. But I look at the comments and everyone is begging for him to not cry and to be happy, and there are virtual hugs flying left right and centre. It's amazing."
Markiplier,3aqt1b,mommatiely,3,Tue Jun 23 07:11:28 2015 UTC,"Mark should be really proud of himself for being the leader and inspiration for a kindhearted community.

Mark in turn makes a reaction video for each to show his appreciation.  For six million markiplierSINGSbadly released this video which featured over 650 fans. Mark reacted to it here. A slightly edited version of that video is what you see in the bottom left.  For eight million markiplierSINGSbadly edited together videos sent in by over a thousand fans reacting to Mark reacting to the six million video. That can be found here.

Markiplier,3ar8e3,mommatiely,5,Sat Jun 27 17:19:54 2015 UTC,"I found Mark on the FNAF hypetrain. I was researching the game since I'd heard so much about it, and the video I watched had a clip of him reacting to it. I'd never seen a Let's Play before so I didn't really know what to search, so I just put in ""Five Nights at Freddy's"" and his videos were on the first page.  I started watching Mark right before a big breakup. It was a rough one that punctuated an emotionally exhausting 2-year relationship with someone who I loved, and who loved me, but felt very uneven from the start.   Honestly, it'll sound lame, but through watching Mark I learned there were people out there with a soul ike mine — one that, at the risk of sounding braggy, sees so much to love in everyone and everything and truly invests in the people that are important to them. I felt taken advantage of for years, and honestly for my whole life, and for some reason I felt that Mark's soul was similar to mine. I saw so much empathy radiating through him, even through his goofy LPs, that I no longer felt like I was strange or that there was something wrong with me. I didn't feel like I would go through the rest of my life being taken advantage of for how I've been since birth. He restored a lot of my faith in humanity, because for 2 years, I honestly thought I could never find another person like me, let alone someone who was praised for being that way rather than taken for granted and brushed off.  I know that was probably a lot deeper than needed, but I guess that should back up my claim if anything (hah). I just watched the video, too, and haven't felt this calm in months.  There aren't a lot of people on Youtube like Mark, let alone in the world."
Markiplier,3ar8e3,squarepeghearthole,5,Tue Jun 23 02:04:59 2015 UTC,"There aren't a lot of people on Youtube like Mark, let alone in the world.   Sure there are. You're one. I'm one. Tons of people in this community are full of the same love and investment in their fellow human beings that you described - but I feel like a lot of people are just scared to show it. Nobody wants something genuine to come off as bragging, so maybe we hold back with each other more than we should about stuff like this.   You're a total stranger to me, and I've already found some stuff to love about you just from the things you've written here. Thanks for sharing!"
Markiplier,3ar8e3,CallMeCaliban,2,Tue Jun 23 05:23:10 2015 UTC,"That made my day, thank you! I guess the better phrasing would have been, ""I haven't watched a lot of people on Youtube, or met a lot of people in the world like Mark."" All it would take is a little more investigating on my end. :-)"
Markiplier,3ar8e3,squarepeghearthole,2,Tue Jun 23 13:35:09 2015 UTC,"I haven't watched a lot of people on Youtube, or met a lot of people in the world like Mark.   That, I definitely agree with! Mark definitely stands out from the crowd, and I admire his bravery in that regard. I feel like I can really relate to what you see in Mark, and how you used to feel about yourself. For a long time, I saw my own kindness as weakness, and thought I must be missing a backbone based on how often I found myself looking past people's shitty qualities to the innate human things I could love about them, and then getting screwed over for doing so.  I'm glad that Mark was there when you needed him, and I hope you keep finding more and more Marks in your life! Everyone deserves a world full of people who are willing to share their kindness and empathy with others."
Markiplier,3ar8e3,CallMeCaliban,3,Tue Jun 23 15:49:21 2015 UTC,"I think that would be good for him to know, that he's helping people without directly talking to them. He said in the 8M video that it was devastating he couldn't talk to everyone who needs him, but I don't think a majority need to talk to him to get his help. Yes, we'd all love to, but hopefully he sees that he's helping just through being himself.  I definitely related to his sadness about not being able to care for everyone. I hope he is careful, because he could slip into caring for others so much that he neglects himself. I still struggle with that. It's an amazing quality to have, but has the potential for very quick burnout.  Nevertheless, the most touching thing anyone could do for me is tell me how much I am appreciated, so his reaction really struck a chord. And thank you, I hope I find more Marks as well! I can tell through your comment you're a kindred spirit, which has helped me quite a bit already."
Markiplier,3ar8e3,squarepeghearthole,2,Tue Jun 23 16:02:19 2015 UTC,"the most touching thing anyone could do for me is tell me how much I am appreciated   I think this hits on the most important thing we can do to help Mark, and each other - which is just letting people know that they're appreciated, and worthwhile, and that there's some love in this world for them.   This guy is gutted because, in his words, ""I know there's people who need me to talk to them, and I can't do that. I know there's people who need me, and I want to be there so badly for them. I wanna bear that burden for them. And I can't.""  And that's something that we as individuals really can do, for him and for each other. We can reach each other when he can't. I would love to do some kind of pay-it-forward fan projects for each other, and really let him see that the people he can't reach personally aren't alone without him - they're with the rest of us, and they're being appreciated by more people than just him.   Thank you for your kind words, and for giving me a chance to appreciate you, too! There's a lot more kindred spirits for both of us to discover out there, and I feel like the more we connect with each other, the more everyone will feel at ease, including Mark."
Markiplier,3ar8e3,CallMeCaliban,4,Tue Jun 23 16:59:47 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure the exact point when I found out about Mark, I think it was around the 1 million range. I was attracted to his humor and humility. The community that he created that surrounds him with love for not just him but each other.    I participated in the 8 Million Fan Video and it was amazing experience. Mark's inspired me to start my own channel by doing that I've been happier than I have ever been in my life."
Markiplier,3ar8e3,niflick,3,Mon Jun 22 22:42:27 2015 UTC,"I found Mark about a year ago while searching for videos about one of my favorite games. I, though I thought the video was entertaining, did not really watch any other videos on his channel until about a week after I found out he was in the hospital. I saw genuine love in his update videos and the comments from the community, and I knew that he wasn't ""just another Youtuber"". Eventually, I watched his 6 million reaction video and, today, his 8 million reaction video. Throughout, I could only think of how great of a person Mark is, and how wonderful it is to be part of a fantastic community despite being fairly new. I only wish I would have been there for longer.  A huge thanks to Mark for everything he does. He truly brings people together in both good and bad times, and his kindness and dedication to his job and his fans touches us all. I am proud to be in this community, and I bet millions of other people are too."
Markiplier,3ar8e3,Silverskipper17,3,Mon Jun 22 23:22:47 2015 UTC,"For me, I ""discovered"" Markiplier through one of my friends. He showed me the slender interview as well as his playthrough of the original Slender. I subbed Markiplier soon after and he just makes me happy and cry sometimes. I really like his videos. He inspired me to just continue on with my life and never feel down."
Markiplier,3ar8e3,Masterdoctorn7,2,Tue Jun 23 01:57:05 2015 UTC,"I can't exactly remember how many subs he had, but it wasn't too long after he uploaded Mental Hospital, because it was only like a day or two old when I first saw it. It was in the recommended section when I was watching someone play a little bit of Amnesia. Been hooked ever since.  He gave me something to look forward to every day when my depression would kick in, he's inspired me to chase my dreams, whatever they may be, and to make the world a better place."
Markiplier,3ar8e3,floodimoo123,2,Tue Jun 23 02:17:27 2015 UTC,"I discovered Mark through a friend of mine who was watching him at the time. He really put a smile on my face, and the fact that he wants to make people happy and laugh is why I made my channel, cause I want to share something with the world, ya know?"
Markiplier,3ar8e3,MegaSpacePigeon,2,Thu Jun 25 18:00:56 2015 UTC,"I've already written a letter to Mark, but I don't mind responding to this. (Happy Birthday Mark!) Maybe he'll see it, who knows? :) I found Mark when I was too chicken to play Outlast. I decided to just watch him play it, instead. He's helped me brave my way through horror games. (Which I really love alot now.) There was something about him that resonated with me than any other walkthrough person. And after awhile, I just kept going back to watch his videos just for fun, whether or not I was playing the same game or sometimes he'd show me new games, so I really loved that. His positive energy is addictive. I watch a video in the morning, at lunch break, and before sleep. It just cheers me up and I do my best to bring that energy into my daily life, which makes my life better. I have Mark to thank for that. I wish he were my friend, but I guess in a way, it's like he is."

Some that I know are Lumen and Super Hot. The poop game, velocibox (awesome reaction) are cool as well, and believe it or not, I am Bread is one of them for me. I like seeing all the different faces that Mark can create whilst playing and I just like watching him overall :)"
Markiplier,3ar6ux,SloventotheMax,1 point,Tue Jun 23 03:40:15 2015 UTC,"I really liked his playthrough of Ib. Even though he was getting frustrated and rushing through the last couple of episodes because he thought he was closer to the end of the game than he was, the game was just so interesting and unique. I liked the Witch's House too, because it's a similar kind of game but he played it at a slower pace. There was also that one with the school that gets put under a dead girl's curse, but I don't remember the name. I also really liked Year Walk, because it's an extremely interesting concept with cool visuals, and because of how much Mark was clearly into it.  Basically, in general I like the slower paced, atmospheric horror games more than I like the frantic ones."

Did you know about it before hand? (What was it like when it happened?) Did your sister know he was going to propose like that? How was it like speaking to Mark, Bob, and Wade?   It was certainly the highlight of an already great panel. I find it kinda funny and also heartwarming that it started kinda a trend of proposals if Pax East was anything to go on. :)"
Markiplier,3apuig,Mdaybloom,4,Mon Jun 22 17:19:41 2015 UTC,"1) fantastic she already has her dress picked out and the are planning it for October of next year 2) I was the original person to come up with the idea and I mentioned it to him. We both planned it for months 3) she kind of was wondering but she had no idea it was going to be like that hence the massive amount of tears lol 4) freaking amazing we got to talk to them a little after the panel and Bob told her stories of when he proposed to his wife. Wade and Mark just gushed over the whole thing and they told us how amazing they we're and how happy he was. Every time any of them saw my sister or her fiance they would stop for a second and talk to them. Even during the meet up Mark saw my sister's fiance he yelled out ""hey that's the guy who got engaged!  Everyone clap for him!"" It was beautiful!!! They are so kind and genuine. Amazing freaking people! Also I greatly appreciate those kind words it was literally the best weekend of our lives. I could not ask for a better opportunity or for anything to have gone different. Also I cried when he asked her lol"

I can't watch a lot of his Let's Plays because I only have one eye and the jerky motions make me ill (same reason I can't watch 3D movies). Mark is a very caring, very warm and outgoing person. And although I am almost twice as old as he is, I still find a lot of wisdom and encouragement in his videos. Yes, even ""old"" women need encouragement. I can easy see why he has risen up so high. I think he will go much farther than just YouTube. I am proud to call myself a fan."
Markiplier,3aooik,EpicGeek77,7,Mon Jun 22 07:32:13 2015 UTC,"That was what drew me and my wife to watching him. He's just so...genuine. It's refreshing. It's what drove me away from Pewdiepie. After a while his videos felt really canned and forced. I've never really gotten that vibe with Mark. His emotionality is one of his greatest strengths. Also, monthly livestreams that routinely raise $50,000+ for charity? That shit is NUTS and super awesome."
Markiplier,3aooik,historynutjackson,3,Mon Jun 22 09:49:21 2015 UTC,"yessss, the geniuneness is what i like.  i'm not a fan of his one off videos, because he's often just dicking around and being silly (not inheritly bad), but his longer playthroughs are usually a lot more thoughtful, definitely my faves.  like kholat, alien isolation.. any big ones like that, he's almost always talking about interesting stuff and being smart in general. it's nice because i learn stuff and i get to watch mark geek out over and over C:"
Markiplier,3aooik,gullibeans,3,Mon Jun 22 11:59:23 2015 UTC,"I like him more for his actions than his videos. I like his videos too but it's just how he acts that's really admirable.   I feel bad for him though. He seems to be collapsing under the pressure of running a channel like his alone. Women putting him on a pedestal and all that.   Mark if by some long shot you see this, I'm sorry. Not because I have done anything that could wrong you or whatever but because all of us can give you back kind, motivational words like you give your fans any chance you have but we don't really know what to say to someone ""famous"" such as yourself   I'm sorry that none of us can really understand what you're going through and I hope you have good people around you in life that can relate to you more than the fans."

His attitude, his awareness, and the way he treats other human beings are what I really love.  To me, the videos are just something to do together as a community; Mark has fun making them, we have fun watching them, we all have some common ground to gather on because of them. They give us a reason and a way to connect with each other.  But that's not why I'm here, or why I love Markiplier. I'm here because he's a good person who wants to change the world and make it a little kinder. That's what I want to do, too. It only makes sense to pool resources with this guy who has so many good ones at his disposal, and millions of other people who want to do the same thing."
Markiplier,3aooik,CallMeCaliban,2,Mon Jun 22 15:23:24 2015 UTC,You should watch his videos from his first year on YouTube. You'll like those even more because he wasn't even performing his LPs on camera at that point - just a guy playing and talking about stuff here and there.

I watch a lot of let's players, and Mark really does bring an unique energy to commentating that's all his own. It's rare that he releases a video that doesn't at the very least make me smile. I'm very grateful for that.   I do agree that his kindness and genuine attitude with his fans is what makes him special. It's helped improve the lives of millions and inspired people to get passionate about making the world a better place. That is so much more powerful than just fun videos ever could be."

I've seen this community catch people so many times.   That's why, despite all the shit the Markiplier community sometimes starts, I still honestly mean it when I say I adore you guys.

Markiplier,3akbsr,Mdaybloom,10,Sun Jun 21 01:14:42 2015 UTC,"...And that is how you Human.  Seriously. +1,000,000 Self-Awareness points to Mark Edward Fischbach. He's got eight million people pointing out his good sides every single day. People feed his ego enough fuel to launch it into the freaking delta quadrant. He's got a LOT of positive reinforcement to look past if he wants to stare the cold, hard truths about himself right in the eye - and he's still doing it like a fucking boss.  It takes guts to face your faults and flaws under any circumstances - but I imagine that it takes a special kind of active determination and commitment to yourself to stay grounded and keep seeking them out, no matter how perfect the world is telling you that you are.   To me, that's strength. That's putting your sense of self-worth to the ultimate use. Avoiding the skeletons in your closet is easy. Marching in there by choice, and dragging them out with your own two hands to dismantle them in the light of day means really investing in yourself.   People who don't love themselves don't make that investment. I can understand the impulse to assure Mark that he's wonderful, but I honestly don't see a man who's seeking reassurance in this post. I see a man who is choosing to hold himself responsible for every single aspect of who he is, from the good to the bad to the downright ugly. I see a person whose self-respect and thirst for self-improvement brought him to some conclusions that no one wants to hear, including himself.  But he's right. Some of these things needed to be said. Mark is not perfect. He will fuck up. He will cause pain, he will feel pain, and nobody involved will like it. He does not need to be protected from these things. He does not need to be insulated from these facts. He needs kindness, understanding and respect as much as any other human being - but he does not need to be saved from the unique and sometimes difficult realities of being Mark Fischbach.  I don't mean for any of this to sound harsh. I love this guy. My respect for him grows by the day - and after this post, I can honestly say that I trust him. I trust him to handle his shit. I trust him to manage his resources. I trust him to seek comfort for Mark when Mark needs comfort, and get brutally honest with Mark when Mark needs some brutal honesty. I trust him to surround himself with people that will make him feel safe and valuable when his personal successes aren't enough to do that. And I trust him to know when he doesn't need to feel safe and valuable. I trust him to get his hands dirty digging through the shit in his own head when he needs to.  Let's let him do this, guys. Let's step back and let him go to these not-so-pretty places - and when he invites us into them, let's respect the strength it took to do so instead of trying to fix the things we see as weaknesses. Let's spot him from the ground while he walks this tightrope. If he falls, we're here - but give him a chance to use his own balance, first.   tl;dr: We feel pain when we're injured. We also feel pain when we're growing. Just because he's hurting doesn't mean he's wounded. I feel like we should be proud of Mark for owning his flaws, not feeling bad for him."

Markiplier,3abvrd,RobbieNewton,36,Thu Jun 18 22:46:02 2015 UTC,"I loved how he was, his dumb jokes and that he told us the viewers what he thought about the games and he knew when to be silent when he played.   I can definitely understand what you're talking about, and see the differences in his commentary between his older content and the newer stuff.  But to be honest, I'm not sure that Mark ever ""knew"" when to be silent while playing a video game. I really don't get the impression that his early LPs had a lot of active style choices in them, or that he intentionally set out for a certain ratio of jokes to interesting comments to quiet time in his videos.   I also don't think that the changes in his commentary style are a calculated move on his part. The more comfortable Mark gets, the more he seems to talk. I don't know him personally, but I'd bet money that this is a Mark Fischbach thing, and not just a Markiplier thing. I know plenty of people who are very quiet when you first meet them, but never shut up once they feel comfortable in a situation.  The commentary he gives us these days may get loud and annoying and completely bizarre at moments, but I do feel like it's still genuine. It's like he turns on his mouth when he turns on the camera, and whatever half-formed weirdness that's floating through his head at the moment comes straight out of it.   Personally, I'm fine with that. I've definitely noticed the changes, but I don't feel like he's acting weird, or like they're coming out of nowhere. As long as Mark's having fun with a game, I still enjoy watching him play it.  As I said, I can definitely see where you're coming from. The content he's putting out now might not be for everyone, and that's totally fine - I'll never judge someone for not liking what he's doing, or saying why. I guess I just see the changes in his channel a bit differently, and while I don't love every single video he makes, I really appreciate what he does overall."
Markiplier,3abvrd,CallMeCaliban,13,Thu Jun 18 23:33:54 2015 UTC,"Well he is an introvert, probably changed the amount he talks now that he feels that a lot of people watch him."
Markiplier,3abvrd,SloventotheMax,7,Fri Jun 19 00:22:28 2015 UTC,"He probably changed how much he talks as he gets more comfortable in front of the camera. I know I started streaming here and there a while ago, and now I even talk to out loud when I'm playing off camera because I've gotten more comfortable with speaking. The more I do it, the more I let my internal dialog out.  He's been doing this for years. He probably doesn't even think about the camera most of the time now."
Markiplier,3abvrd,forgettableme,1 point,Fri Jun 19 19:48:07 2015 UTC,Has he said he's an introvert? I'm still discovering his personality outside of LPs.
Markiplier,3abvrd,squarepeghearthole,2,Tue Jun 23 02:13:29 2015 UTC,"He has in one of his videos. Ugh, I feel like such a stalker knowing all of this about Mark."
Markiplier,3abvrd,SloventotheMax,1 point,Tue Jun 23 03:34:35 2015 UTC,"Don't! It's good to know a lot about someone/something you're interested in. I like to figure out if people are introverted/extraverted when I first meet them, and he's always been hard just because his LP persona is extremely extraverted.  I watch a lot of Matthias' videos, and his daily vlogs when Mark is around does kind of show Mark's introversion, now that I think about it. He's always goofy but never really says much. You can see his ""offline"" personality more.  EDIT: Changed ""outgoing"" to ""extraverted"" because you can be outgoing as an introvert, too."
Markiplier,3abvrd,squarepeghearthole,2,Tue Jun 23 13:38:49 2015 UTC,Well yeah I just kind of pick on the little things he says while he is playing games. He talked a lot about himself during that 7.5 hour livestream with Wade and Tyler because they did a QnA and you get bits and pieces of what he is like outside of his channel :). I would recommend watching that when you work out or study or something
Markiplier,3abvrd,SloventotheMax,1 point,Tue Jun 23 14:20:35 2015 UTC,That's the one video I haven't watched of his in the last month lol. The 7.5 hours intimidated me. I will have to break it up into segments to listen to while I jog!
Markiplier,3abvrd,squarepeghearthole,2,Tue Jun 23 14:52:48 2015 UTC,"When they are playing Yoshi, its good to watch Mark get PISSED at Wade for sucking so badly. I recommend watching the video for those times and when they did storytelling. Man, were they hilarious."
Markiplier,3abvrd,SloventotheMax,11,Tue Jun 23 15:52:36 2015 UTC,"I know a lot of people don't like this topic, and for good reason, but people do genuinely change (even if you don't think it's for the good)  Personally I subscribed to Mark because he seemed like a down to Earth, mature guy. I do see a change in his maturity level especially with his screaming. But, I still think he's an awesome dude and will continue to watch his videos for the foreseeable future."
Markiplier,3abvrd,godziraaa,5,Fri Jun 19 01:35:08 2015 UTC,"generally when someone is newer to youtube and making videos they are not as loud or open or funny as they end up being a few years later. this is due to confidence and support. the more support the youtuber gains, the more confident and outgoing they generally become.  mark is still mark, but he's probably more confident and outgoing than he used to be, and reflects in his excitement in videos. it may seem like careless screaming to you, but to me he is still as interesting and funny as he seems in his older videos, just maybe slightly less frequently.  you are also still you, but you've also changed as well. it's hard for people to realise that change also happens to themselves. maybe you're not as into it because you are also changing."
Markiplier,3abvrd,mighty_claw,11,Fri Jun 19 11:39:16 2015 UTC,"You can't expect a person's content to stay exactly the same. PewDiePie had the exact same development; at first he was kinda shy, made jokes here and there and was silent more often then now, but then he opened up a lot and really connected to his fanbase. Mark did the same thing. I still love them both."
Markiplier,3abvrd,SupremeKai4,2,Fri Jun 19 00:35:34 2015 UTC,"I don't agree. On Kholat he spent a lot of time quiet pondering the serene and solemn beauty of the landscape. Very insightful comments. And I loved how he freaked out at a few of the choice jump scares, esp. the cabin - O.M.G."
Markiplier,3abvrd,ar40,6,Fri Jun 19 23:14:41 2015 UTC,"I personally don't see what you mean, but that's fine. You mentioned talking over dialogue, but I've been thoroughly enjoying Kohlat for just the opposite reason. I've never noticed a big change in his content honestly. I have seen a lot of people share your sentiment though, so I might be the odd one out."
Markiplier,3abvrd,Mdaybloom,4,Fri Jun 19 02:30:15 2015 UTC,"I agree so much with you. I've been in this community since 12k subs and honestly, I don't see much of a change in Mark. His quality has indeed changed, no doubt, as he looks different, he sounds a litle different (mostly because of a much better mic that he uses), he uses a very different lighting, but his commentary is pretty much the same as always, I deem."
Markiplier,3abvrd,The_Grand_Secgend,3,Fri Jun 19 16:42:14 2015 UTC,"I disagree completely. He's always given quality content and he's still Markiplier. I mean his style of commentating hasn't really changed - i'd say it's evolved. I feel the word ""changed"" is implying that he made a conscious effort to manipulate the way he plays, and I don't think that he has. It has grown and changed as he has. The reason why some may think he has changed I can understand it. His most popular videos are older and he definitely commentates differently in his most popular videos, but if you were to watch his videos in a very chronological order I don't think you would be able to identify any major changes. They just happen over time."
Markiplier,3abvrd,Eunoic,8,Fri Jun 19 23:53:54 2015 UTC,"mark is just being mark,people wont allways stay the same way forever,i love him regardless of whether he's changed or not,and honestly,i've not noticed it,he's allways been a funny,rather over the top guy.  i dont see the comparisons to pewdiepie,either,you might,i just cant see them for the life of me,honestly,mark is still one of the most down to earth and amazing youtubers on youtube,i'd much rather hang out with mark then pewdiepie,pewdie is far too over the top to the point it's just grating,when mark does stuff it's funny,he's found the right sort of balance,imo."
Markiplier,3abvrd,KingOfElysium,2,Thu Jun 18 22:22:09 2015 UTC,"ALSO, u CAN't compare him to PEW. Pew comes across as manic for the sake of being manic. Like he's playing it up, digging for the laughs.  To me, Mark is sincere, and his fun-spirited sometimes-lunacy is just his natural personality. That's what draws me to Markiplier over any other Youtuber."
Markiplier,3abvrd,ar40,3,Fri Jun 19 23:16:20 2015 UTC,Yeah that is why I despise pewdiepie in his videos. The occasional yells from a scare during SCP was fine but now it's like hes trying to cater to that younger audience who loves pew
Markiplier,3abvrd,OyabunRyo,1 point,Thu Jun 18 22:27:22 2015 UTC,I feel exactly the same. Also it feels like he  puts less effort into his videos
Markiplier,3abvrd,dany99001,5,Thu Jun 18 21:58:46 2015 UTC,"I don't think he puts less effort into his videos. In fact I think his editing is better and more thought-out than ever before, and I don't feel like he puts any less into into actually playing or commenting on the games. It just seems like his comments have changed. I remember, in between his reactions, he used to do fair little mini-reviews while playing a new game, and would sometimes go on little tangents about the technical stuff behind game design (which the programmer in me enjoyed). Now he tends to just make more jokes and sillier ones at that. I think he's just started focusing more on a younger audience, whereas before he might not have even had a specific demographic in mind for his videos. I don't think that counts as less effort, just a bit of change in targeted appeal."
Markiplier,3abvrd,F4cetious,1 point,Fri Jun 19 12:34:12 2015 UTC,Can you link to any examples?
Markiplier,3abvrd,Mdaybloom,1 point,Fri Jun 19 02:21:50 2015 UTC,"From what I can remember, I think Scale or Super Hot are videos where he talks about game design/mechanic"
Markiplier,3abvrd,SloventotheMax,1 point,Sat Jun 20 02:59:39 2015 UTC,I was referring to /u/dany99001's claim that Mark puts less effort into his videos. Sorry if that was unclear.

Markiplier,3abgle,Mdaybloom,3,Fri Jun 19 02:24:55 2015 UTC,"Hey, what a coincidence. He's continuing it. :)"
Markiplier,3abgle,SloventotheMax,1 point,Sat Jun 20 21:11:28 2015 UTC,I like to think he lurks around this subreddit :)
Markiplier,3abgle,Mdaybloom,1 point,Sat Jun 20 22:25:28 2015 UTC,"Me too, I've noticed a few coincidences like this one that make me think he might. He mostly likely doesn't since he's so busy, but it's possible."

The orange 'tan' is from bodies lying out on the bright white snow, the missing tongue is because of scavengers (scavenging animals will often go for the tongue because it's relatively soft tissue), the assorted injuries and destroyed camp are from the avalanche, the nudity is from paradoxical undressing (hypothermia causing people to feel super-hot because the brain is malfunctioning, so they strip). It's really only a ""mystery"" because it was spiced up in the retelling, and because the Soviets were secretive about it (like everything else)."
Markiplier,39qkwa,Kyyni,2,Sat Jun 13 22:45:02 2015 UTC,"There was also reports that some of the victims clothes were extremely radioactive, and some sources cite that flying orange orbs were seen in the area around the time and metal debris was littered around the area. The place of the incident happens to conveniently be on a straight path between Baikonur Cosmodrome, a missile test launch site and Chyornaya Guba, a nuclear test site.  A nuclear weapon or missile mishap would also explain some of it, and would definitely be a big reason for the Soviets to try to hide everything.  Weird, though."
Markiplier,39qkwa,LordJiro,2,Sun Jun 14 18:37:12 2015 UTC,"The radiation and orbs never appeared in the initial report, though. They were added in later retellings.  The avalanche is the most likely explanation. The Soviets just kept it a secret because they kept EVERYTHING a secret."
Markiplier,39qkwa,LordJiro,1 point,Mon Jun 15 01:17:24 2015 UTC,"Interesting, thank you for sharing. Paradoxical undressing sounds absolutely terrifying to experience.   Anyway, still makes a good camp fire story if you pretend there was something more to it."
