Habs,3e4f9y,FeelsLike93,9,Tue Jul 21 21:43:30 2015 UTC,"No, our forwards are much more valuable then him."
Habs,3e4f9y,fatneszsebby,14,Tue Jul 21 22:12:50 2015 UTC,"Absolutely not. I don't think he'll be in the organization anymore anyway, but even if he is, there will likely be better goalies for those teams to pick from. Nowadays most goalies are all like 6'2 at least. Tokarski is only 5'11 and not that good."
Habs,3e4f9y,willhabs,4,Tue Jul 21 21:57:08 2015 UTC,"I kind of wonder if Tokarski would even be taken in an expansion draft. I think most teams wouldn't protect their backup goalie unless he was a blue-chip prospect almost ready to take over full time. I think at that point there would be better goalies available.   A team like Anaheim can't afford to protect Andersen and Gibson, and likewise with teams like SJ (Stalock/Jones), STL (Elliott/Allen), VAN (Miller/Markstrom/Demko), WPG (Pavelec/Hutchison/Hellebuyck), DET (Howard/Mrazek).. The list goes on. If any four of those aforementioned guys are unprotected (not to mention a ton of other maybe's) that's 4+ goalies right away that would, IMO, go before Ticker."
Habs,3e4f9y,AlabamaLegsweep,2,Tue Jul 21 22:54:02 2015 UTC,Yeah but we don't know who the GM's will be for the new teams. It could be THAT guy from every fantasy league that drafts four goalies.
Habs,3e4f9y,imtoocoldforthisshit,2,Wed Jul 22 00:06:20 2015 UTC,"Nah. Were pretty stacked at D. Assuming Markov retires by the time this draft takes place we'd protect Subban, Petry, Beaulieu and I'd rather lose Tokarski (as much as I'd like to keep some Saskatchewan representation on the team) and keep whatever variation of two of Emelin (that's right I said it. Little overpaid but still a good second pairing D-man), Juulsen, Tinordi, Pateryn etc. Whatever two are the biggest factor when the time comes."
Habs,3e4f9y,imtoocoldforthisshit,2,Wed Jul 22 00:12:55 2015 UTC,Last draft was protect 9F-5D-1G or 7F-3D-2G. So expose 2 F + 2 D in order to keep an extra goalie.  You'd be looking at exposing Weise-value or blue chip prospects + Tinordi/Pateryn type in order to save Tokarski. Doesn't make sense with the goalies in our pipeline and his forgettable NHL stats.

Habs,3dve21,RamRam_,13,Sun Jul 19 21:05:52 2015 UTC,"It seems like nobody understands that the 3 players on the top line are very rarely the 3 best forwards on the team. A playmaker, a sniper and a grinder is a very traditional line. The grinder is rarely a star. When you find a combo that lets you get production out of a 4th line player like that, you milk it for all it's worth and take advantage of the boost to other lines. Or at least, it's a viable option not sheer idiocy.  Weise is an asset and it's great that he can draw enough attention to give Patches a little breathing room.  Of course, that doesn't mean he's underpaid."

Habs,3dve21,prplx,-3,Mon Jul 20 01:18:43 2015 UTC,This team can not move forward with DW in the top 6
Habs,3dve21,MessageBoard,-9,Sun Jul 19 21:59:08 2015 UTC,And Eller is exactly where I expected him to be.  people who see him as a top six are delusionnal.  He is a good third liner.
Habs,3dve21,quadriplegic_cheetah,13,Sun Jul 19 23:34:14 2015 UTC,Only Malholtra and Prust were used in a more defensive role than Eller this year among regulars. Prust was only 1% less offensive zone starts. I would explain usage to this sub again but I'd rather not have an aneurysm.
Habs,3dve21,Gourmet_Bacon,2,Sun Jul 19 23:43:08 2015 UTC,Same... When you give Eller top 6 forwards even two rookies (kid line) he turns into a 50+ point player.
Habs,3dve21,MustardTiger1337,8,Mon Jul 20 02:37:40 2015 UTC,"When he plays with top-6 players, he puts up top-6 numbers. When he plays on the third line, having to carry a contingency of rotating 4th liners (+ Sekac and DLR), he still puts up third line numbers. I don't see the delusion in expecting Eller to do better than, say, DD, if he had the same linemates, nevermind the OZ starts and the weaker conpetition."

Habs,3dqnk6,hkycoach,2,Sat Jul 18 14:50:22 2015 UTC,My prediction of what happens on D  Tinordi come out to camp in  good shape and makes the team. Gilbert is shipped once a team gets a injury. Tinner gets chances over pateryn early in the season as the 6th d  Bealieu starts as 5th an but breaks into the top 4 by the end of the year. The surprise will be that it comes at the expense of markov who will be the target in the top 4 because of a lack of footspeed by other teams
Habs,3dqnk6,bsaures,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:32:14 2015 UTC,I also think Tinner needs to come out not only this season but the first 2 months. If he is not preforming well by then his value will only go down. I say if he does not preform well he is shipped out in mid December.
Habs,3dqnk6,fatneszsebby,-3,Sat Jul 18 23:05:02 2015 UTC,Tinordi does not make this team. Even if Gilbert or Emelin get moved he still won't crack the bottom 6.

Habs,3drbn8,quadriplegic_cheetah,2,Sat Jul 18 21:07:40 2015 UTC,I think he'd make a good middle-six winger who can shift depending on situation

I would guess Fucale is the starter in the ECHL since Condon was ridiculously good last year. At least until Condon is called up/traded. There's no rush with Fucale, he'll be in the AHL for 3-4 years.  Could also be Fucale is moved before the season starts, but I doubt it."

Habs,3dnlmz,boomboomsubban,3,Fri Jul 17 23:13:02 2015 UTC,Only losers blame others for their failures. Leblanc failed on his own. Habs gave him plenty of opportunities. He's just not very good.
Habs,3dnlmz,Swiffer-Jet,-1,Sat Jul 18 11:54:32 2015 UTC,"He may not be very good, that doesn't change the fact we gave him a crappy opportunity. Do you really not understand that circumstances influence results?"
Habs,3dnlmz,boomboomsubban,1 point,Sat Jul 18 12:41:59 2015 UTC,And he didn't make the best out of those. Why should he have been given more? Why should he have played with Pleks and Patches? Your reasoning is silly.  He played on a third line with third liners and still was expandable.   Dale Weise earned his top line minutes by playing well with shit teammates on a fourth line. Leblanc never deserved a comparable treatment.
Habs,3dnlmz,Swiffer-Jet,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:25:03 2015 UTC,"It's really hard to judge if a player made the best of a shitty opportunity. The line I mentioned scored at a greater rate than general with Bourque on the ice, and gave up zero goals against. What in that is saying he didn't make the best out of it? How are those 44 minutes enough to draw your conclusion on his abilities?   When did Dale Weise play well with shit teammates on the fourth line? That never happened, he was put next to Desharnais and Pacioretty after 4 games of zero points and three goals against."

Habs,3dnlmz,boomboomsubban,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:55:28 2015 UTC,"next season we will be icing the following players in at least some capacity: Galchenyuk, Gallagher, Beaulieu, Pateryn, Bournival and Tinordi, with more than likely at least one of Hudon/Andrighetto/Scherbak/Carr/McCarron as well.   We have an extremely young team. I love our prospects and I want them to succeed too, but it's not realistic to ask for like 7 developing players to all be dressed at the same time in the NHL. They would get manhandled."
Habs,3dnlmz,AlabamaLegsweep,2,Sat Jul 18 17:06:43 2015 UTC,"We didn't for most of last year, I don't know why you think we will this year.   Funny, the last Habs games I remember involved us getting manhandled by more than 7 developing players in a lineup.

Habs,3di3lh,IBoris,27,Thu Jul 16 13:26:58 2015 UTC,I think Gallagher will score 30 goals this year.
Habs,3di3lh,athiestweed420,5,Thu Jul 16 13:30:07 2015 UTC,He's 100% capable of doing it.
Habs,3di3lh,FamousTee,17,Thu Jul 16 21:41:08 2015 UTC,"Bournival will bounce back and make the third line the second most productive line on the team.  Tinordi will have a breakout camp and make the team. DSP will come in to camp in bad shape.  Getto and Pateryn will get traded with Emelin and DSP.  Subban and Markov will be separated. Markov starts his decline.  Kassian will be the second coming of Andrei Kos.  Habs will only make significant trades in September.  To everyone's surprise, Price will remain hot. Patches, not so much.  Plecks will get traded in October November.  Our D Corp will terrorise the eastern conference. Look for the Habs to lead in defensive stats all season.  Subban will get the Norris this year again and there will be little debate on if he deserved it."
Habs,3di3lh,Alfr_d,16,Thu Jul 16 13:39:44 2015 UTC,"some of this sounds great, some of it sounds terrible"
Habs,3di3lh,Gabroux,4,Thu Jul 16 13:59:09 2015 UTC,"1- I hope Bournival can produce at this rate, but I never quite saw his upside. People will say that he have a ridiculously high points per 60 mins ratio, but that can be resulted into his low minutes. I don't think it means much in his case. 2- I think Tinordi will make the team, but around November-December when one of our defencemen goes down to injury. Then it's on him, another poor showing and he's out in my opinion, if instead he does great, we can expect MB to trade either Gilbert or Emelin for him. For DSP.... well I hope you're wrong! lol 3- I don't see Ghetto or Pateryn being traded, MB is really hard on having players come from within. 4- If Petry played RD, they would have been seperated right away. I doubt that Beaulieu can take the job for now. Markov will play less, but he will continue with Subban 5- Maybe, but the second coming of AK still produces more than Prust. Let's hope that MB discovered another Weise 6- I think the team will stay intact for now, trades in December and March are expected 7-  Well Price have been hot for 2 years, he won't cool down now! Patches always have bad starts, it would be a surprise if he produces at a crazy rate from the get go. 8- Traded for who? That's the big question. I don't see any team trying to get rid of a winger in October-November and I don't want MB to waste a good asset like Plekanec for only picks. 9- Terrifying D-Corps indeeed (Subban, Markov, Petry, Beaulieu, Gilbert, Emelin, Pateryn and Tinordi is nothing to be ashamed of) 10- I think we will see a lot of Norris talk between Subban and Karlsson in the next years. Subban will win it at least 2 other times in his career.    Let's see who wins!"
Habs,3di3lh,hkycoach,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:08:37 2015 UTC,"I think the only problem with #2 (assuming he has a poor showing) is that Tinner would have to clear waivers to go back down to the A.  So if he's not performing I could see him being traded.  Edit:   Also, I don't see Emelin moving with his cap hit.  Although maybe we can eat 1m of his cap just to get rid of him."
Habs,3di3lh,Gabroux,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:53:50 2015 UTC,He does not have a big caphit though. So you can keep him with the club until a trade happen

Habs,3di3lh,FakeCrash,2,Thu Jul 16 14:25:01 2015 UTC,"The thread title is ""crazy predictions"". What if they have a terrible start to the season, like 4-13-1 or something through October? It's unlikely, of course, but I could see it happen."
Habs,3di3lh,televisionceo,3,Thu Jul 16 14:33:50 2015 UTC,I guess I'm just more confident about our team
Habs,3di3lh,deus_vult_a_cracker,2,Thu Jul 16 14:58:53 2015 UTC,"If play is comparable to last year, and Price gets off to a shaky start, things could go badly.  Let's say Price is merely a league average player with a Sav% of .915 for the first 20 games.     We averaged 30.1 shots against last year, so that Sv% brings us to 2.56 goals against, instead of 2.24.   That's against 2.61 goals for.    That's a positive difference of .05 goals per game over the season.    For comparison, Boston had a difference of .10, so slightly better than that.  They didn't make the playoffs.  LA had a difference of .16, and they didn't make the playoffs either.    Dallas was the only team with a goal differential that close that made the playoffs, and they are a different team.  For LA and Boston, both GF and GA hovered around 2.5.  They are defensive teams, and their defence just didn't work out for them last year.  For Dallas, it was 3.2 per game for both.  So they play a high-risk, high-reward game, which is completely different than Therrien's style.    So, if Carey Price is merely average for 20 games, we probably won't be in a playoff spot.    I like our team.  We have a ton of talent.  We have three star players, who should be considered in the top 5 in their positions.  We have several young players who are very talented.  Gallagher, Galchenyuk and Beaulieu could all break out this season.  With good linemates, (like Hudon/Desharnais/maybe DLR or Bournival) and Kassian/Andrighetto,maybe even DSP) Eller could become a solid two-way center.  Bournival, Mitchell, and Wiese would be one of the most threatening 4th lines in the league.  We have one of the best #2 centers in the league.  Any combination of Pateryn, Tinordi, Gilbert and Emelin makes a solid 3rd string of D-men.    All we really need to be a real contender as far as the lineup goes is for Gallagher to break out, one prospect to pan out as a top-9 forward, and one pickup on the wing (opposite the side of the prospect), maybe at the trade deadline.    Everything else wrong is coaching."
Habs,3di3lh,televisionceo,3,Thu Jul 16 16:15:19 2015 UTC,It's assuming that our prospects and kassian are shit so we are not improves overall (something I highly doubt though)
Habs,3di3lh,deus_vult_a_cracker,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:17:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Kassian is easily a good 3rd liner, and Eller is a much better center than Matthias.  He might even do OK as a 2nd line winger, but that's a bit of a stretch."
Habs,3di3lh,hkycoach,2,Thu Jul 16 16:39:45 2015 UTC,"I actually think you may be right.  We could feasibly get off to a really bad start where Price's performance comes out of the stratosphere, and our other players just aren't producing.  The lack of production could be from the system, or even just having young or unfamiliar players in said system.  Either way, I see a lot of pressure being put on MT after a bad start."
Habs,3di3lh,Mean_Mister_Mustard,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:58:21 2015 UTC,"I don't know... If Therrien finishes the year, he would become the first coach since Pat Burns to complete a fourth year as Head Coach of the Montreal Canadiens. (And Burns left for Toronto at the end of that year.) Heck, by showing up on opening night, Therrien will become the first coach since Alain Vigneault to coach more than three full consecutive seasons with the Habs. (Of course, 2012-13 was a lockout-shortened season, so that helped a little.)  Like it or not, Therrien has reached the point in his tenure where you'll see questions about whether he has ""lost the room"" every time the Habs lose two in a row. God forbid they should have a 4-game slump in the middle of January, Therrien might as well start packing his office if that happens."

Habs,3di3lh,televisionceo,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:00:19 2015 UTC,"Probably yeah, but they can play him 26 and seprate the time between the others guys. Beaulieu is no scrub either and seem ready to take a bigger role in the team."

But we did have a decent share: http://canadiens.nhl.com/club/page.htm?id=67176  I think we were primarily lucky that we didn't have significant coinciding injuries.  Like if Chucky/Petry/Patches all suffered their 'injuries' (Flu/Flu/concussion Upper Body Injury) simultaneously.

I would prefer MB to not sign anymore UFA and go with a rookie on our top 6. Ghetto, Hudon or Scherbak can fill it. I prefer a 15-20 goals production from one of our rookie than overpay a UFA like Semin or Tlusty for the same result"
Habs,3di3lh,thawizard,2,Fri Jul 17 23:20:38 2015 UTC,Carr doesn't play D.
Habs,3di3lh,televisionceo,0,Thu Jul 16 14:44:04 2015 UTC,have you read the article that was posted today  about him ? he seems promising
Habs,3di3lh,Gabroux,-5,Thu Jul 16 19:25:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah he's good, that's for sure. But can he pass Gilbert, Emelin, Pateryn and Tinordi in one camp? I'm not sure. He will play for us, but I think it will be in 2 seasons"

It would also be acceptable to keep this 3 millions for next summer where the UFA market should be ridiculously good.  The first defencemen that will be traded IMO is Gilbert or Tinordi and it's depending on Tinordi's play.
Habs,3di6e4,Gabroux,2,Thu Jul 16 15:16:12 2015 UTC,Why does Tinordi have to clear waivers?
Habs,3di6e4,athiestweed420,3,Thu Jul 16 13:55:31 2015 UTC,He's over the years under NHL contact rules.

Habs,3di5nw,torontodreamer,-3,Thu Jul 16 18:49:42 2015 UTC,He turns 24 in November. He's pretty much reached his potential.
Habs,3di5nw,Violaceum,0,Thu Jul 16 21:29:18 2015 UTC,You mean like Streit when he came in the NHL ?......
Habs,3di5nw,jo_maka,2,Fri Jul 17 03:33:44 2015 UTC,Streit was an elite player in Switzerland for half a decade. We didn't even draft him as a prospect. We drafted him to get exclusive negotiation rights. It was right after that the NHL changed the rules so you can't draft 25+ year olds.
Habs,3di5nw,MessageBoard,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:22:19 2015 UTC,"We didn't get Carr as a prospect either. The guy just put up record numbers in the SHL, he could be very very good for us."

Habs,3di5nw,jo_maka,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:56:34 2015 UTC,Diaz was a legit top 4 guy for us until his concussion. He was never physical but he went out of his way to avoid contact after that.
Habs,3di5nw,MessageBoard,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:57:08 2015 UTC,"Great comparison. A Defensemen who put up great numbers in the Swiss A league, to a guy who gets half a pt per game in the AHL"
Habs,3di5nw,Violaceum,2,Fri Jul 17 14:45:20 2015 UTC,Did you see me make a direct comparison between the two players ?  My point is 24 years old doesn't automatically translate into ''reached potential''.   By the way Streit got better and didn't stall when we got him. And Rafael Diaz was also an elite Dman in the swiss league so make of that what you will.
Habs,3di5nw,jo_maka,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:58:09 2015 UTC,"I don't know what to make of Diaz, but he doesn't have much to do with my point. Some players don't make the transition over from European leagues. No real big deal.   You did compare Carr with Streit when you brought Streit's name into the topic. One thing to consider as well, which you probably know, is that a defenseman like Streit will mature a little later than a forward. Carr has a little less time before his opportunity is up."
Habs,3di5nw,Violaceum,2,Fri Jul 17 15:59:33 2015 UTC,"He said:  24 years old - meaning already reached potential.  I said no, Streit was and still not topped potential.  I never directly compared Streit and Carr. C'mon you're smarter than that, you know what I mean."
Habs,3di5nw,jo_maka,0,Fri Jul 17 16:04:44 2015 UTC,"What did you mean by Streit, if not a counter example? Whether it is direct or indirect, it is a comparison."

Habs,3dff10,jo_maka,9,Wed Jul 15 21:07:09 2015 UTC,He's gonna do good.   MB gotta be cookin smth because I don't see him sending the kid away by waivers.
Habs,3dff10,LeMAD,3,Wed Jul 15 21:35:11 2015 UTC,If he has a poor camp he will clear waivers. If it's he has a decent camp that could make things more difficult. A trade perhaps.  But if he has a solid camp that's Emelin that could be gone.
Habs,3dff10,jo_maka,3,Wed Jul 15 21:55:25 2015 UTC,"To a cap floor team, Emelin might look good.  Wait and see."
Habs,3dff10,PermanentlyObscene,6,Wed Jul 15 23:22:48 2015 UTC,so this just leaves chucky left to sign then right?
Habs,3dff10,Kuciv,8,Wed Jul 15 21:20:29 2015 UTC,"Pretty much, maybe a couple lesser players. Not sure if we've signed Ellis yet.  Yes"
Habs,3dff10,LegendaryWolfee,11,Wed Jul 15 21:30:58 2015 UTC,"No matter what, I think we should keep him, Chara has very similar stats to Tinordi the same age I believe, took Chara 3 whole seasons , (not playing 20 games and sent back to AHL) to get decent numbers. We just have to be patient, remember when McDonagh wasn't do so hot so we got impatient and traded him? If worse comes to worse, he will be a great AHL captain for our up coming stars"
Habs,3dff10,IcariteMinor,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:44:05 2015 UTC,"McDonagh never even attended a Habs camp, he was still in university when he was traded. It had nothing to do with the pace of his development, it was just a shit trade."
Habs,3dff10,jo_maka,0,Thu Jul 16 12:20:57 2015 UTC,"He was never to be a Habs. He was a faller that landed on Timmins lap, much like Collberg. He was never targeted. He was always to be a trade bait."
Habs,3dff10,Shenji06,5,Thu Jul 16 15:45:51 2015 UTC,let's not forget he played and hid a injury for 3/4 of the season last year i guess he really wanted to stay up but now its is time to shine wether he got send down fairly or unfairly this is year to prove he belongs with us or prove to someone else to take a chance on him for a trade.  personally i hope he stays once we clear up on d-mess (meaning if we keep emmy and gilbert )
Habs,3dff10,snakers,29,Wed Jul 15 23:55:13 2015 UTC,My $0.02: I don't think this guy has been given enough of  fair shake by the organization.
Habs,3dff10,Sehs,5,Wed Jul 15 21:14:16 2015 UTC,"I have mixed feelings about him. Not so much mixed feelings as much as maybe worried/puzzled because I know defencemen take longer to develop, let alone a big guy like Tinner. I'm hoping he gets more of a chance this season because I think he can be a valuable player on the team in a few seasons."
Habs,3dff10,LeMAD,17,Wed Jul 15 21:40:37 2015 UTC,"I completely disagree. Tinordi just had pretty terrible couple of years and the best the Habs could do for him was to give him a lot of icetime in the AHL, instead of playing him 8 minutes per game in the NHL where he would have been a liability anyways. If the guy ever becomes a NHLer, it will take a while, as he has still no idea what to do with the puck. And in today's NHL, there's no place for a defenseman who can make a good first pass.  For him or any other young player, the best you can do for their development is to keep them in the minors until you are sure they are ready."
Habs,3dff10,BinaryChode,-5,Wed Jul 15 21:46:17 2015 UTC,what this guy said
Habs,3dff10,TheJustin72,-4,Thu Jul 16 01:35:40 2015 UTC,"Yes they've continually pissed away important developmental minutes for young d-men on old retreads who have no business playing for the team. It's quite bizarre.  And now not only do they not know if Tinordi is an NHL calibre d-man, but he now can't be sent to the AHL without clearing waivers.  Great job!"
Habs,3dff10,Powdreams,17,Wed Jul 15 21:29:43 2015 UTC,I remember when he and Beaulieu would be playing fine but as soon as they made one mistake they were sent down. God i love how Therrien instills confidence in these two. Meanwhile he played frankie bou bou in their place because we all know what a future he had with the team
Habs,3dff10,televisionceo,18,Wed Jul 15 21:56:40 2015 UTC,"he has not done so great recently, let's be honest. Pateryn was way better (very unexpected IMO)"
Habs,3dff10,Powdreams,3,Wed Jul 15 22:06:33 2015 UTC,You're right but they haven't handled him very well from the start. That absolute moron of a coach who i can't believe hasn't been fired yet in the AHL pressures tinner to fight and goon it up. Pateryn has been great although he is a righty while tinner is a lefty
Habs,3dff10,televisionceo,8,Wed Jul 15 22:10:54 2015 UTC,"maybe. BUt i think he had multiple occasions to shine in the canadiens and he did not.   Mtl love big guys. He was put in a position where it should have been relatively easy to succeed. All we ask of him is to bring a physical presence. He does nto have the skills beaulieu has. But he has the size. And every time we recalled him he made some hits first and then completely stopped. It's a big problem and if he does not start to understand that because he has limited skills he needs to compensate elsewhere, he won't make the NHL, at least not for the habs.   Now is it the coach's fault ? I could not say."
Habs,3dff10,Powdreams,-8,Wed Jul 15 22:14:59 2015 UTC,"Ah well,  the habs have so many d prospects that eventually 1 out of 10 have to stick.  Pushing out Emelin will be tough for him since the coach and gm loves emelin.  Coming back from a broken knee?  4x4 extension!!! Franchise player and win a norris? Play contract hardball,  god i love this gm"

That is a totally cheap shot on Lefebvre.  Show me one clip, one of either Tinordi or anyone in fact, claiming that his coach is asking him to goon it.  Everything I read points to the opposite, they kind of want him to tone down the fighting stuff, it's hardly needed in the NHL nowadays anyway.  But Tinordi has in his head this is how he is gonna make it in the big league.  Lefebvre is a former d men, and he hasn't done to bad with Beaulieu and Pateryn, who are both NHLers now."
Habs,3dff10,Powdreams,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:03:35 2015 UTC,"Ahaha you actually think Lefebvre is good coach? At least Therrien supporters can use the record. Lefebvre is absolutely awful, no playoff appearances or anything even close. My favorite Lefebvre moment is when he scratched Andeighetto to make him a ""better person"" . The habs organisation is too generous,  always looking to make someone a better person."
Habs,3dff10,prplx,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:32:16 2015 UTC,"I didn't say he was a good coach.  What I said, in line with this thread about Tinordi, is that he seem to have done a decent job with those to d men (Beaulieu and Pateryn). I don't follow the AHL and I can't really comment all that much on Lefebvre's quality.  I know that NHL coach are paid to win, and their record is a very good way to judge how good they are at their job.  And I know that AHL coach are primarily paid to develop players, and winning comes second (at least in MB philosophy as he said it himself).  Would Lefebvre be a better coach if he benched his young players, and played his veterans (that will never play in the NHL) and made it to the playoffs?  I thin not."
Habs,3dff10,Powdreams,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:13:24 2015 UTC,"He already did that this year. I cry like a baby about Therrien all the time but Lefebvre is actually worse. My personal favourite theory is that the reason they have such a horrendous AHL coach is because it gives them motivation to want to move up rather then suffer under that moron.  Teams that develop prospects well make the AHL playoffs. Look at Tampa and Detroits AHL team,  they've won the Calder cup and they have great prospect development."
Habs,3dff10,paul_33,2,Thu Jul 16 18:53:15 2015 UTC,That's the issue here. It's one thing to punish young 'uns but don't be a hypocrite and allow terrible vets to do the same night in and night out. Remember Murray?
Habs,3dff10,Powdreams,2,Thu Jul 16 13:01:56 2015 UTC,"Gotta love the Therrien double standard just like some fans love just being in the playoffs and consider a 2nd round exit okay just because they were third last a few years ago.

Habs,3dff10,Batmarde,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:29:58 2015 UTC,Tampa had much more years at the bottom to draft Hedman stamkos and kucherov tho
Habs,3dff10,Powdreams,3,Thu Jul 16 15:35:48 2015 UTC,"I'll give you stamkos but the habs have a close equivalent to hedman in subban. The triplets were all acquired through a 2nd, 7th and undrafted signing.  Could you imagine therrien ever putting three youngsters on the same line for that long a time? Last time was the EGG line but we all know how long that lasted despite the success."
Habs,3dff10,Batmarde,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:40:46 2015 UTC,We had a DLR-Eller-DSP line last year. Eller is 26 DLR is 19 and DSP was 22 (turned 23 last month)   I don't see how that's not a young player line  We also had Pleky Gally and Chucky for a good portion. This is like 2 thirds of the EGG line except pleky is more productive than Eller atm
Habs,3dff10,Powdreams,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:15:02 2015 UTC,"You got me there. But i doubt they played as many minutes as the triplets,  were kept as a line for that long nor got pp time."
Habs,3dff10,Batmarde,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:17:51 2015 UTC,Triplets are one of a kind though. Doesn't happen or work on every time. I'd love to see rookies break 40-50 points but the reality is it doesn't happen often   Chucky might break 60 and he's been in the league for like 3 years now and he's a first rounder
Habs,3dff10,Powdreams,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:26:41 2015 UTC,"Agreed,  i just hope ghetto,  Carr,  sherback or Hudon get legit offensive chances"
Habs,3dff10,Batmarde,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:37:17 2015 UTC,I think ghetto has the best chances we have a rw spot open in our top 9 and with a good camp he could definitely break the roster
Habs,3dff10,Ptrainer87,2,Thu Jul 16 16:44:14 2015 UTC,"I am very disappointed in how Therrien handles our young players. On the other side, defensive mistakes cost games since our offence is minimal to non existent. Doesn't have much of a choice to send them down so they can learn."
Habs,3dff10,Powdreams,8,Wed Jul 15 22:06:20 2015 UTC,"Or... Maybe since the habs never really have had to fight for a playoff spot due to Price putting up historical most likely unsustainable numbers,  they should've let them learn from their mistakes instead of playing vets. Look at the ducks defense,  they played their young guys (vatanen,  lindholm) tons and tons despite their young mistakes."
Habs,3dff10,Gabroux,5,Wed Jul 15 22:09:06 2015 UTC,"Please Vatanen and Lindholm are far ahead of Tinner. Also, MT played Pateryn and Beaulieu over vets. Stop repeating the same overused crap"

Habs,3dff10,Ptrainer87,4,Thu Jul 16 21:40:14 2015 UTC,"Correy Perry, Ryan Getzlaf and Ryan Kesler. With offense like that you can afford a mistake goal once a night. The HABS play a defensive minded game where we win by 1-2 goals. There's no comparison here."
Habs,3dff10,Powdreams,4,Wed Jul 15 22:14:01 2015 UTC,A... Defensive minded... Game?  The one that needed price to post an unsustainable historical season? The one that had us come 22nd in possession stats? The one that has them ice the puck as a default breakout strategy? The one that has them ringing the puck around the boards off a won d zone draw? The one that had them near top 10 in scoring chances against? Sounds very defensive to me
Habs,3dff10,prplx,3,Wed Jul 15 22:25:27 2015 UTC,"Like how he is handling Gallagher, who is playing on his second line and power play?  Or Beaulieu who was playing solid minutes in the playoffs until he got injured?  Or Galcheyniuk, who is 21, a regular NHLers, and was playing against the Lightening during the playoffs while Jonathan Drouin was watching the games from the press box?  Therrien tends to use players he likes (Gallagher) a lot, and not use the players he doesn't like (Parenteau), like any other coach.  And like most coach, he tends to have a shorter leash for younger guys (except for team that are tanking).    He could have done better the way he handled Subban specifically, but all in all, I think it is unfair to say he is particularly bad with young players."

Habs,3di6mb,Gabroux,9,Thu Jul 16 14:41:02 2015 UTC,"The article is great. The sensationalist title is pure garbage though. I hate this about Berkshire.   The article presents scoring chance statistics in the regular season vs playoffs for the Habs. The data shows that Prust created the most scoring chances of any Habs player in the playoffs (based on their criteria for scoring chances).  It's all great information and shows what I noticed anyways, that Prust had a great playoffs. Wonderful stuff.  Here is where I have a problem with the article:  1) He makes no argument as to why the Habs may or may not have made a mistake trading Prust. Because....  2) He doesn't show the same statistics for Kassian while he was on the Canucks.  We can't come to a conclusion on his initial question because we're missing the other half of the data required to make a proper analysis.   A more honest title would be ""Brandon Prust lead all Canadiens in scoring chances in the playoffs"". But we all know that wont drive traffic to this site, unfortunately, so they have to go with the clickbait-y title. It's frustrating because his analysis is good enough to stand on it's own without always having to turn it into a question of competence in the Habs front office."
Habs,3di6mb,theres__no_time,2,Thu Jul 16 15:49:37 2015 UTC,"Based on the comments, and the downvotes, I'm guessing no one read the article.  But I agree with them, Kassian was the right trade for right now."

Habs,3di6mb,Ferg8,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:44:00 2015 UTC,"I will miss prust, along with a lot of other people, he brought character into a team that didn't have much when he joined, but the trade wasn't even a trade, it was a robbery, and Montreal got it good with the trade, got a Big right winger with top 6 potential, who's younger, and cheaper, along with a 5th round pick, in exchange for a older declining player. I find the only thing I'm unsatisfied by is that we lost a tough guy, and with Tinordi and McCarron coming up the ranks, I'm sure that'll go away in time. Best of luck for Prust"
Habs,3di6mb,LegendaryWolfee,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:11:27 2015 UTC,Who is Prust ?
Habs,3di6mb,televisionceo,0,Thu Jul 16 14:28:55 2015 UTC,"Prust is getting injured more often every year, and with his playstyle I don't see that trend stopping. Better to trade him now than when he has 0 value."
Habs,3dgx7y,Royal_Flush13,11,Thu Jul 16 04:33:45 2015 UTC,"I mostly agree, but Desharnais isn't as bad per his advanced stats. He actually has pretty good possession numbers and impacts positively on linemates' goals/assists compared to Bozak.  He's just not a #1 center."
Habs,3dgx7y,TheHydroImpulse,2,Thu Jul 16 05:27:31 2015 UTC,"The real question is ""Is he the best guy to pair with Max (or Phil)? Does he get the most out of our most skilled winger?"" I don't think so. Though I wonder why the possession stats are better."
Habs,3dgx7y,thawizard,3,Thu Jul 16 05:31:51 2015 UTC,"Bozak and Kessel probably allow more shots/turnovers/goals than Pacioretty and Desharnais. Kessel was -34 last year, Pacioretty was +38. The difference in the way they play probably has a big impact on their respective centres."
Habs,3dgx7y,acdc51502112,2,Thu Jul 16 06:13:18 2015 UTC,You can't compare the +/- of those two teams. We had way better goaltending and defence.
Habs,3dgx7y,Powdreams,3,Thu Jul 16 20:36:52 2015 UTC,Tough to hate on dd as a person when its the coach who plays him in that position / those minutes
Habs,3dgx7y,paul_33,3,Thu Jul 16 15:34:33 2015 UTC,Same reason one can't hate Weise. It's not their fault they are misused
Habs,3dgx7y,paul_33,4,Fri Jul 17 14:38:28 2015 UTC,"Completely, but I'll take DD over Bozak any day."
Habs,3dgx7y,Funkenbrain,2,Thu Jul 16 14:52:34 2015 UTC,That's depressingly accurate.
Habs,3dgx7y,MessageBoard,2,Thu Jul 16 04:43:17 2015 UTC,I would agree except for the similar trade value part. Pierre McGuire came right out and said Desharnais wouldn't be claimed in an expansion draft. He and LeBrun also said there was literally zero interest in Desharnais around the league. While Bozak may not be a top line center he is good defensively.
Habs,3dgx7y,axepig,3,Thu Jul 16 09:11:22 2015 UTC,"DD isn't bad defensively though, he's really underrated in that area. I remember a lot of times he comes back and stick lift or pokecheck the puck, Bozak can be more physical though"
Habs,3dgx7y,quadriplegic_cheetah,2,Fri Jul 17 04:07:31 2015 UTC,While Bozak may not be a top line center he is good defensively.   Bozak is absolutely horrid defensively. Trust me.
Habs,3dgx7y,MacerV,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:37:03 2015 UTC,I think that's a stretch. Playing on the PK does not equal good defensively. The Leafs have had abysmal PK numbers for years.

Habs,3dgx7y,SonofMustachio,3,Thu Jul 16 04:40:17 2015 UTC,"Maybe but the age gap makes them more difficult to compare. Eller has put up 26-28 pts in 77-79 games on three separate seasons with constantly shuffled, grinding linemates and plenty of defensive shifts. He could very well put up twice that many pts with a sheltered role and a great scoring wing."
Habs,3dgx7y,ConvertsToMetric,3,Thu Jul 16 05:08:32 2015 UTC,"I have taken a few defensive shits, but mostly they are offensive."
Habs,3dgx7y,HammerOfTheSlobs,-2,Thu Jul 16 12:51:32 2015 UTC,No way. Eller has less than half the vision DD has. Have you seen him in a 2 on 1? He never generates a scoring chance. His instinct is to always take it to the boards.
Habs,3dgx7y,SonofMustachio,4,Thu Jul 16 05:25:54 2015 UTC,"After seeing Prust and Weise fail to put any finish on anything he might have some fairly warped instincts.  It's a lot easier when the basic (sometimes only) strat is ""set up Max"". And Eller is always starting shifts 200 feet away."

Habs,3deefd,LeMAD,2,Wed Jul 15 19:29:18 2015 UTC,"As far as I rememeber, McDonagh never struggled to make the lineup and was never considered a purely defensive D either. He was a college player at the time he was traded, so he never even participated to the Habs training camp.  Most people thought Gainey was hilariously stupid to make this trade."
Habs,3deefd,BuddhasLittleWarlock,2,Wed Jul 15 20:26:20 2015 UTC,"I think that last line isn't right. Gomez was a big name player who helped attract other big name free agents. Many thought McDonagh was going to be another David Fischer, if I recall correctly."

He's a serviceable Marc Methot-type player that we currently have no use for.
Habs,3deefd,webu,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:16:53 2015 UTC,"Tinner had a wrist injury during his last callup at the end of the season and it sounds like he hid it from the team - he wanted NHL ice time at any cost while the team didn't know the reason why he was sucking so much. After he was sent back to Hamilton it all came out & he had to have surgery and missed the rest of the season (and was not called up as part of the Black Aces). Reading between the lines, MB and MT seemed beyond pissed. Then his dad made waves in the press about his son not getting a proper chance, which is the type of attention that MB loathes (especially after the hidden injury debacle). Note that MB drafted a D in the first round & has recently signed a laundry list of free agent D-men with two-way contracts. Tinordi has lost favour with the bosses & I wouldn't be surprised if he gets traded. Now that we've got Petry/Beaulieu/Pateryn he is fully expendable. We can expect other D (the new guys) to get callups before he does, but a callup is probably inevitable in order to try to raise his trade value.  tl;dr Tinner is in the doghouse (and also recovering from an injury)"
Habs,3deefd,HammerOfTheSlobs,2,Wed Jul 15 18:53:29 2015 UTC,"I really don't get the feeling Bergevin or even Therrien have a doghouse, at least in the long term. The team mentality is play well and you'll get icetime.  And I think he was still injured in the playoffs, so that would explain why he wasn't part of the called-up group."

Habs,3dacef,axepig,3,Tue Jul 14 19:05:19 2015 UTC,I believe so. I think MT has to keep him in the bigs.
Habs,3dacef,jo_maka,10,Tue Jul 14 19:30:16 2015 UTC,It's basically a year to prove if he's an NHLer
Habs,3dacef,Batmarde,3,Tue Jul 14 19:38:16 2015 UTC,"He's still pretty young though, and every time he played in the AHL, he was the best player.  He may simply be a future Torrey Mitchell. But it's better than nothing. You still need these guys."
Habs,3dacef,LeMAD,3,Tue Jul 14 19:55:33 2015 UTC,Oh yeah I know but the 1 year contract is usually what they give riskier guys. Basically 1 year to prove you have a future with the team
Habs,3dacef,Batmarde,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:58:27 2015 UTC,I agree with that. If he doesn't manage to crack the lineup by the deadline he might be moved if not then at the draft. Hard to get full value for a healthy scratch though so hopefully that doesn't happen.

Time to see if Bergy is gonna try to move some bigger tickets to make way for the kids. I don't blame him though, he's playing it safe.

And with Pateryn's play last year, we don't need him on the 3rd line.  Emelin could go too, if it weren't for his NTC.    DD has no trade value.  Better to use him as our 2nd/3rd line LW.  He's cheap, and a pretty good player, even if he's not a #1C.    Eller could go, but I don't think we'd get good value in return; he didn't have the best season last year.  With DD on his left, and maybe Kassian or Andrighetto on his right, that could make a decent scoring 3rd line."

Habs,3dacef,Kuciv,3,Tue Jul 14 20:17:23 2015 UTC,"It is a luxury to have him as a #5. A lot of teams would want that. We should see what he's worth on the market, it's possible we wait till there's a major injury somewhere in the league on the blueline before this happens, but I'm sure MB is working his phone."
Habs,3dacef,jo_maka,0,Tue Jul 14 21:08:40 2015 UTC,"This is incorrect. The contract signed was a 1 year two-way 600k, meaning he can transfer between the NHL and AHL."
Habs,3dacef,PhenStiller,3,Tue Jul 14 20:15:55 2015 UTC,"Two-way contracts just means he will get paid less in the AHL than the NHL, it has nothing to do with waiver eligibility, I think there's a period where waivers aren't activated though so he could spend the year in the AHL but could not be brought up without going through the waivers"
Habs,3dacef,axepig,3,Tue Jul 14 20:48:29 2015 UTC,You are correct when you say his two way contract has nothing to do with his waiver eligibility - it's all about games and seasons played.

Habs,3dacef,Kuciv,3,Tue Jul 14 20:15:05 2015 UTC,I don't think people realized how big of a hole was left in our defence when we traded Gorges. He was one of the best shotblocking defenceman to wear the Bleu blanc et rouge other than maybe Hal Gill in recent years.
Habs,3dacef,PhenStiller,4,Tue Jul 14 20:27:04 2015 UTC,He was also essentially playing goalie in front of the goalie resulting in deflected goals or shots that Price couldn't see.
Habs,3dacef,jo_maka,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:05:01 2015 UTC,Thankfully we have competent people in place managing the team and not a bunch of overly emotional Facebook commenters or we'd be pulling moves like Sweeney in Boston left and right.
Habs,3dacef,BAITER_ELITE_MASTER,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:20:12 2015 UTC,^ I'm pretty sure Sweeney reads all the Bruins fans comments left on every social media page to gather input on business deals.
Habs,3dacef,PhenStiller,3,Tue Jul 14 20:55:34 2015 UTC,And DD. Don't forget to trade DD because he's literally the most useless player in the history of the whole league and every time he backchecks it results in 5 goals
Habs,3dacef,Batmarde,3,Tue Jul 14 22:39:08 2015 UTC,This.  The only reason DD is playing in the NHL is clearly because he is Therrien's darling.  Never mind the fact that he rakes up more point then most players on the team.
Habs,3dacef,prplx,2,Wed Jul 15 00:24:42 2015 UTC,All his points is because Patches does everything and DD just rakes up the 2nd assists !!!

I am sure every team sub has guys like that.  I just don't get it.

Yeah, well,better then you guys who are juste cheerleaders!""  Blah blah blah.   The truth is, if you read most people comments in this sub, including my own, you will see that we alternate with support and frustration.  We praise the good moves and pester the one we perceive as bad.  We get upset at some of Therrien's actions (or lack of) but we can also acknowledge what he does right.

You thinking Therrien is an awful coach is not a ""fact"". We had already qualified Bournival so we pretty much had to sign him so now is not the time to complain. The time to complain was when we qualified him and no one wants to hear it again. People downvote you because you're an asshole who thinks he knows more than everyone. Just right in that comment you act like you're the only person who understands advanced stats. You bring up the same stupid shit regardless of the thread. And if anyone here should be a leafs fan it's you because they are used to pessimistic asshats."

Habs,3dc7jp,hockeyrugby,6,Wed Jul 15 03:21:20 2015 UTC,Excellent bottom 6. Great work ethics. Good shot. Great speed. Decent vision. Defensive acumen.  I didn't expect that much from the return of Ryan O'Byrne.
Habs,3dc7jp,jo_maka,2,Wed Jul 15 10:49:55 2015 UTC,"Agree with everything except the shot. I think that if he could improve his shot, he could be a middle-sixer."
Habs,3dc7jp,jshare,2,Wed Jul 15 11:01:45 2015 UTC,His shot is not accurate but it's still relatively heavy. Not a dizzying release. He makes up for it by shooting whenever he can though. So I'd say it's still good. Not great. But good enough.
Habs,3dc7jp,jo_maka,2,Wed Jul 15 12:33:29 2015 UTC,His shot is the only reason he is not playing for us right now
Habs,3dc7jp,televisionceo,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:48:29 2015 UTC,"I'd say the concussion is what cost him his spot, not any failures in his game"
Habs,3dc7jp,boomboomsubban,3,Wed Jul 15 18:55:41 2015 UTC,"At the very least, he's a fast, aggressive, strong 4th liner.  He can fill in on the 3rd line to cover injuries, but I'm not sure if he has the offensive ability to stay there."
Habs,3dc7jp,deus_vult_a_cracker,0,Wed Jul 15 03:54:10 2015 UTC,"Great speed, weak shot - perfectly sums up Bournival."
Habs,3dc7jp,AwkwardAwkwardness,3,Wed Jul 15 07:38:56 2015 UTC,"The fourth most goals per minute on the team, if his shot is weak he's making up for it with shot quantity and quality."
Habs,3dc7jp,boomboomsubban,-1,Wed Jul 15 08:17:26 2015 UTC,Thats just the manipulation of data from a small sample size. He has 2 goals in 1 game.
Habs,3dc7jp,bsaures,3,Wed Jul 15 11:58:31 2015 UTC,"I used his entire 84 games with the Habs, I'd use a larger sample size if I could. Smaller than ideal, but nothing like you're describing."
Habs,3dc7jp,boomboomsubban,0,Wed Jul 15 12:25:26 2015 UTC,"That's why I like him on a line with Wiese.    Both have great speed, and Bournival can do everything Wiese can't.  Protect the puck, dig it out of the corner, recover loose pucks.  And Wiese has a pretty good shot for a 4th liner.  They'd make a great 4th line."
Habs,3dc7jp,deus_vult_a_cracker,2,Wed Jul 15 08:09:40 2015 UTC,I hope we trade him so he can help another team.  I love him and he can play in the NHL but not with us

Habs,3dc7jp,BuddhasLittleWarlock,4,Thu Jul 16 00:19:56 2015 UTC,I think they should have avoided signing Mitchell/Flynn and just kept this guy. Unfortunately now there is a logjam.  I mean maybe it's me but I expect more from this guy than I do DSP.
Habs,3dc7jp,paul_33,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:22:48 2015 UTC,"Bon, mes amis, but not bon enough."
Habs,3dc7jp,BuddhasLittleWarlock,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:18:31 2015 UTC,His development was impaired by being rushed into the NHL after his strong pre-season and now he is only a decent bottom 6 without a strong shot. More time in the AHL top 6 would've helped develop his game.
Habs,3dc7jp,SiegeWar,0,Wed Jul 15 07:14:03 2015 UTC,"Dunno who would downvote you. This is precisely correct, he was rushed and his initial offensive production petered out as he wasn't used to the NHL. He could've been a solid 3rd liner if things had gone better."
Habs,3dc7jp,WhiskeySeven,3,Wed Jul 15 12:17:14 2015 UTC,"Cmon,  he has never been the most talented guy."
Habs,3dc7jp,televisionceo,-1,Wed Jul 15 12:49:29 2015 UTC,"Many people expected better NHL-level production out of him, and he was better in his first stint than any subsequent stint."
Habs,3dc7jp,WhiskeySeven,0,Wed Jul 15 16:20:23 2015 UTC,"Objectively speaking, he's a fringe 4th liner whose only in the NHL because he can skate like the wind. He's Tom Pyatt's french twin with way less intelligence (dumb as bricks). His signature move aka crossing the blue line and taking a terrible shot is extremely easy to defend/read. The only other benefit to having him in the lineup is his ability to create turnovers"

Habs,3db22b,televisionceo,-2,Wed Jul 15 17:59:57 2015 UTC,He plays on the Montreal Canadiens and is horrible. I don't care if he's from Quebec or anywhere else.  He doesn't belong on this team with the quality of ice he gets.  Fucking pathetic to assume that I care about what language he speaks or where he's from.
Habs,3db22b,BrokenRetina,3,Wed Jul 15 18:57:44 2015 UTC,He plays on the Montreal Canadiens and is horrible.   Sorry that just simply isn't true.
Habs,3db22b,theres__no_time,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:25:20 2015 UTC,he is good and the only reason so many people complain about him are not pretty. He is still one of our most creative players. He is not the ebst but to say he has no place in this team is bigoted at worst and misguided at best.
Habs,3db22b,televisionceo,-1,Wed Jul 15 19:00:24 2015 UTC,"Lol.  You are creating something out of nothing.  He doesn't belong here.  He is hindering the development of a better center man.  He is not good.  His winger's goals combined for more than he has points.  He plays close to 3mins on the PP, no SH time, 11th highest OZone starts league wide and is sub 60 pts.  To top it off he plays with not only our two best wingers but one of the best goal scorers in the league.  The only bigot thing about the Habs is the fans (in Montreal) agreeing that the coach/GM must speak french, and when a non-French speaking coach was hired there were protests.  People outside of Quebec do NOT care what language someone speaks.  Its only an issue in your sovereign state."

You bring up the fact he's French Canadian and assume I care then you run from the argument after I stated multiple times I don't care where he is from  You pick out 1 portion of a statement and claim holy than thou status, when in reality I don't care.  I don't dislike DD because he's French Canadian, I dislike him because he's garbage there is the difference.  Only this teams fan base uses language as a differentiator between who ""real fans"" are and who aren't.  You aren't a fan of the Montreal Canadiens, you are a fan of Quebecois born players.  Fuck off you dirt bag."
Habs,3db22b,BrokenRetina,0,Wed Jul 15 20:56:15 2015 UTC,You misinterpreted my comment.  I'm saying your bias comes from the fact that you think we care about language when all we care about is that dd is doing a fine job.   I believe it's not 100% conscious on your part.  It is simply brainwashed.  I won't insult you personally because I understand where you come from.
Habs,3db22b,televisionceo,0,Wed Jul 15 21:12:25 2015 UTC,"Lol at this hogwash.  Sure you care or you wouldn't have made that ridiculous statement. He's not doing a fine job and he's not even close to it. He's ranked 11th in the league in Ozone starts and has a pitiful 48pts to show for it. The 3rd liner who is ranked 117th in the league (for centers) for Ozone starts has over HALF his point total without any PP time and playing with 4th liners. The 21 year old ""will probably never play center"" has 1 less pts in less Ozone starts.  The only people that defend this shrub to no end are those that think people dislike him because he's French.  Again, avgs 2:32/game on PP, plays with a 35+ and 20+ goal scorer. No SH responsibility, below avg defensively, weak on his skates, 48pts; DD is doing fine.  Ok then."
Habs,3db22b,BrokenRetina,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:31:37 2015 UTC,"He is far from my favourite player but the way you and others talk about him make it sounds like he is Jan bulis.  He is hard worker,  a great passer,  has probably the best vision in the team.  He could be used differently though"

Habs,3d98pr,athiestweed420,16,Wed Jul 15 18:12:06 2015 UTC,Petry. I did not even know the guy before we got him. And it's one of the most complete dmen I've seen with the bleu blanc rouge.
Habs,3d98pr,televisionceo,11,Tue Jul 14 14:37:57 2015 UTC,"I was hoping for a while that Pateryn would get a chance, most were hoping Tinordi would get the spot, but Pateryn has more pro experience.  Also wanted the Habs to ""win"" the Grabovski trade.  Good choice for your question."
Habs,3d98pr,shiram,4,Tue Jul 14 14:29:51 2015 UTC,Pateryn was a great surprise. I really liked his style of play.
Habs,3d98pr,HammerOfTheSlobs,20,Tue Jul 14 14:42:50 2015 UTC,"Price, not because I don't think he has massive talent, but I really wasn't expecting the kind of legendary year he had."
Habs,3d98pr,HammerOfTheSlobs,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:44:14 2015 UTC,I hope people don't lose their minds when he comes back down to earth. He's a star but very few can repeat such a great year. He had people believing they could win the cup on his back.
Habs,3d98pr,paul_33,19,Wed Jul 15 17:45:26 2015 UTC,"Another one is Jacob de la rose. For a 19 year old, he is amazing defensively. We might see next year if he can bring something offensively"
Habs,3d98pr,televisionceo,12,Tue Jul 14 14:47:16 2015 UTC,"I really hope they keep JDLR in St-Johns the coming season. Which is not a knock against him, but more so the idea that with the IceCaps he could get a bigger role, work on his offensive game and play big minutes. In Montreal, he does a good job of playing 4th line minutes, but he won't learn to play a top position, or get more responsibilities."
Habs,3d98pr,shiram,3,Tue Jul 14 15:13:42 2015 UTC,Not every player needs to end up being a top 6. He would probably have a better career being a really good 3rd liner than if he had a career being a subpar 2nd liner
Habs,3d98pr,Batmarde,2,Tue Jul 14 17:32:56 2015 UTC,"Still, there should be enough depth on the Habs that he could be used in St-Johns, getting big minutes, and special teams. Even a third line player is expected to bring some contribution to offence."
Habs,3d98pr,shiram,3,Tue Jul 14 17:36:55 2015 UTC,"I prefer to see DLR on the bottom 6 than someone like Ghetto, Hudon or Scherbak"
Habs,3d98pr,Gabroux,2,Tue Jul 14 17:46:48 2015 UTC,"Mitchell, Weise, DSP, Eller, Flynn and Bournival are most likely going to be the bottom 6."
Habs,3d98pr,shiram,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:55:49 2015 UTC,Bourni hasn't been the same since his injury last season. He might have changed his mindset during the summer but he definitely seemed different

Habs,3d98pr,televisionceo,10,Tue Jul 14 20:42:48 2015 UTC,DLR was my surprise. I did not expect him to be as NHL ready as he has appeared. Hopefully he can start producing more points and so on.
Habs,3d98pr,hockeyrugby,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:14:00 2015 UTC,"He's an odd prospect. When they called him up, I knew he would stay. Not many players are as reliable defensively as he is at that age."

Pacioretty is a fitness freak, and at that level they push their limits, so things like his injury can happen. All in all Brulotte does not bring much forth."
Habs,3d9dtb,shiram,3,Tue Jul 14 15:17:20 2015 UTC,Agreed.  Patches has been pro for 7 seasons now?  And most likely worked just as hard for 4-6 years as an amateur; but the injury was avoidable because there wasn't 'professional supervision'?    I'd rather have Patches oversee my workout than the 'professional' trainers at most gyms.

The guys are decent, but their big stars are price and subban. Yet the team is solid."
Habs,3d5t4m,Akoustyk,14,Tue Jul 14 00:08:53 2015 UTC,real top superstar forwards   Pacioretty produces goals at a superstar rate. Not his fault that Therrien won't play Chucky at center instead of DD
Habs,3d5t4m,SiegeWar,5,Tue Jul 14 01:37:11 2015 UTC,I hope Galchenyuk will be a center this year. For all the fucking year.
Habs,3d5t4m,Ferg8,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:39:32 2015 UTC,Does he though? Seems he's scared to pull the trigger on a top six player.
Habs,3d5t4m,MustardTiger1337,4,Tue Jul 14 00:29:14 2015 UTC,I think he has done very well. If it weren't for the players meltdown they could have made the conference finals for the second time in a row.   It's easier said than done to get a strong top 6 player.
Habs,3d5t4m,Akoustyk,3,Tue Jul 14 00:36:13 2015 UTC,Who knows? Kassian might end up being the real deal
Habs,3d5t4m,BuddhasLittleWarlock,0,Tue Jul 14 00:42:15 2015 UTC,Kassian couldn't put up points playing with the Twins in Vancouver.
Habs,3d5t4m,MustardTiger1337,3,Tue Jul 14 01:45:51 2015 UTC,Maybe he needed a fresh start. Maybe he just couldn't get on the same wavelength as the twins. I guess we'll find out in a year if he was a good pick up or not.
Habs,3d5t4m,BuddhasLittleWarlock,-5,Tue Jul 14 01:48:59 2015 UTC,I mean do you really want him playing on the top line with DeeDee and Max? I'd rather have DW LOL
Habs,3d5t4m,MustardTiger1337,4,Tue Jul 14 01:55:50 2015 UTC,"I'd be willing to give it a shot. I mean, even Gretzky played with goons. Maybe having a physical guy to go deep in the corners and cover the pint-sized DD would be good for the team."
Habs,3d5t4m,BuddhasLittleWarlock,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:08:31 2015 UTC,Because it worked so well with Prust/DSP/Moen/etc?

Habs,3d5t4m,MustardTiger1337,4,Tue Jul 14 00:29:28 2015 UTC,"Personally thought a few of the forwards made a bigger impression. Right handed dmen aren't exactly an organizational weakness. His uncles is Pittsburgh's coach though so ""bloodlines"".  Seems to fit in with signing our assistant GM's son to be an assistant coach in St. John's though. Really hope this isn't the start of us becoming and Edmonton style old boys club.  That said I hope he does well. There's pretty much zero chance he'll ever play for the big club but hopefully he can push some of the other RD in the AHL like Lernout and Dietz into competing harder. Some guys thrive on competition."

Habs,3d4bbp,JMPesce,3,Mon Jul 13 13:04:58 2015 UTC,I love that I'm seeing this everywhere.
Habs,3d4bbp,hkycoach,8,Mon Jul 13 14:58:03 2015 UTC,"I like Hudini, but I'm still putting my money on Ghetto.  I think his experience with the team last season still gives him the edge over Hudon.  He (Hudini) will get some time with the club, and if he proves he can be an impact player, then he'll stick.  But again, I think Ghetto's experience at the NHL level gives him ""the inside track""."
Habs,3d4bbp,jo_maka,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:12:27 2015 UTC,"Thing is Ghetto is on RW and we're getting clogged on there: Gally, Kassian, DSP, Weise, Holloway (I suspect he'll get at least a very long look). Hudini's on the left and we're thinner there, especially in an offensive capacity: Patch, Chucky (which shouldn't be), Rosie (shutdown, and should be C anyway IMO), Bourny."
Habs,3d4bbp,A_Montrealer,5,Mon Jul 13 17:24:34 2015 UTC,Ghetto can play all 3 forward positions very well
Habs,3d4bbp,hkycoach,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:15:06 2015 UTC,"We are pretty clogged up there, but in my (ever so humble) opinion; Weise and DSP should be wingmates on the 4th line.  Neither has the offensive capabilities to be up on the 2nd/3rd line.  I know people like Weise's rags-to-riches tale of how he left VAN and came to us and suddenly he's getting ice time, and scoring goals.  But he's not a viable solution to our scoring woes.  And DSP... well - he likes to hit... but beyond that I haven't seen much offensive production from the guy (even in creating offense from his checks).  Of course we have a pretty small sample size for DSP, so the jury is still out on him for me."
Habs,3d4bbp,jo_maka,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:27:23 2015 UTC,"The fourth being a shutdown is gonna need a southpaw though. If you wanna have two right-handed there, the second one better be your centerman, and that's already Mitchell's gig (with Flynn in his shadow)."
Habs,3d4bbp,hkycoach,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:38:01 2015 UTC,"I think that depends on the usage of the 4th line.  If it's a line you throw out to shut down someone's 2nd or 3rd line, sure you need a balance.  But if it's a line to go out and mix it up with the opposition's 3rd/4th line for 45s, I think you could get away with 3 RH shots.  Lets be honest, these guys aren't on the team because they handle the puck well and are going to be setting each other up.  They're here because they play aggressively.  Edit:  Also Ghetto is a lefty - so I imagine he could be slotted in on the left side..."
Habs,3d4bbp,jo_maka,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:46:32 2015 UTC,"True. But they need to be put in a position to be able to win battles along the boards and not cough it up due to positioning either. So I'm pretty sure, in a risk-averse system as MT's, we're bound to have a leftie there."
Habs,3d4bbp,hkycoach,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:50:51 2015 UTC,"I haven't really looked into it too much, and I don't think over-analyzing our 4th line will bear much fruit.  But here I go anway...  There are a lot of techniques that players can use whether they're on their off-wing or not.  If, say Weise is slotted in on the left, he may have to learn some new techniques to win those battles, but that would be something that their coaches would have to identify and teach.    I think (in this hypothetical case) Weise would likely be open to shifting to (and learning to play) the left side if it was his best option for getting ice time, if the alternative was to be a healthy scratch in favor of a natural lefty.  Whether or not MT and his staff think Weise (or DSP) could pick up on playing the left-side, and still be better than the next replacement is something that they'd have to figure out.  But looking at our dearth of options for checking LWs in the A if they were to make the move I think even Weise on the left would be preferable to one Connor Crisp for a straight checking line.  We could feasibly bring up Bournival or Bozon to fill in the gap over our transplanted winger, but I'd much rather see those two on the 3rd line with line-mates who can help us get a better idea of their offensive potential - rather than putting them with the knuckle-draggers."
Habs,3d4bbp,jo_maka,4,Mon Jul 13 19:03:26 2015 UTC,"Bournival has to stick here next season, man. He did nothing to warrant being sent down, and he actually has decent hands on top of his speed."
Habs,3d4bbp,hkycoach,2,Mon Jul 13 19:16:53 2015 UTC,"I'm hopeful that we see two or even three come up from the A next year.  Last year DLR stuck, but I'd definitely like to see the ""youth movement"" turn into a surge of talent over the next two years.  Ghetto, Bournival, Hudon and Scherbak could all be regulars by the end of the 16/17 season.  I wasn't too impressed with Tinner last year, but he could stick, as could Juulsen in 2-3 years."
Habs,3d4bbp,Charble1,2,Mon Jul 13 22:44:51 2015 UTC,"I really second this. I was very surprised we did not see him in the playoffs at all, when he actually scored quite a few pretty important goals in the 2014 run. He just doesn't get the ice time, in my opinion. Should be seeing third line minutes; we need to get over putting an exclusively checking player on the 2nd/3rd lines, even if it means benching one of DSP, de la Rose, or Mitchell. Our 3rd line is basically non-existent."
Habs,3d4bbp,hkycoach,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:47:36 2015 UTC,What about CT?
Habs,3d4bbp,Swiffer-Jet,3,Mon Jul 13 15:45:51 2015 UTC,"Well, I don't really count him out.    The article really speaks to Hudon making the cut, and I'm (still) favoring Ghetto at this point.  CT could make a showing too, and honestly I could see Ghetto/CT both getting significant time on the roster.  They're both RFAs at the end of the season, so we need to find out what we've got."
Habs,3d4bbp,MessageBoard,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:02:33 2015 UTC,Thomas is mostly uninteresting.
Habs,3d4bbp,habsdane,-6,Tue Jul 14 03:38:37 2015 UTC,No NHL potential. They gave him 20 games to prove himself and he proved they made a mistake. The acquisitions of Kassian and DSP make it unlikely he ever sees the NHL again. Unlike Andrighetto Thomas can't play left wing.
Habs,3d4bbp,quadriplegic_cheetah,4,Mon Jul 13 16:45:05 2015 UTC,"Lol, AHL first liner and no NHL potential? I get he had 20 games but that's limited ice time, and his first time playing in the show. Give the kid a break."
Habs,3d4bbp,MessageBoard,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:55:33 2015 UTC,"He's not an AHL first liner. Our first line varies between, Bournival, Andrighetto, Hudon, Dumont and Carr. All of whom are better than Thomas. It's debatable as to whether or not Thomas is even an AHL top 6 forward."
Habs,3d4bbp,habsdane,-1,Fri Jul 17 18:24:07 2015 UTC,"In what world is he an AHL first liner? His numbers are terrible. He's the worst top 6 player we have in the AHL, take it from one of the only people on this sub who watches AHL games. His play on the ice is absolutely terrible for a guy who's a one-way forward. The only thing ""NHL-Caliber"" about him is his shot. Which he can't even get off in the AHL with any sort of regularity.  Complete old boys club garbage(hyped as ""bloodlines"") is the only reason he got a call up. His play was worse than any random AHL vet we've had the last decade. The only reason you know Christian Thomas' name is because of who his dad is. It's the only reason he was traded for and it's the only reason he was called up. Nothing that has happened in his professional career has been based on merit."
Habs,3d4bbp,MessageBoard,2,Mon Jul 13 18:10:51 2015 UTC,"Okay, for the sake of the argument lets say he's a third liner. You really think they 'let' him play 20 games last year because who his dad is?  Let's pretend I've never even seen him play, why would they sign him to another year if he has ""no NHL potential"".  You did nothing in that comment except imply that you are smarter then the Canadiens Scouting staff, that's why you got downvoted.."
Habs,3d4bbp,quadriplegic_cheetah,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:32:47 2015 UTC,"Look around the league at all the sons/brothers who were signed for no reason other than family connections. Heck even Jordie Benn gets to play in the NHL regularly despite being one of the worst dmen in the league. He wouldn't even be on our top pairing in St. John's. Stephen Gionta same thing. NHL is possibly the most nepotistic business on the planet. Scouting staffs, farm teams, management groups are all littered with sons/brothers of former players.   Aside from nepotism the only possible explanation for him getting 20 games is he and Bournival were the only forwards who had to clear waivers this year. Normally you don't give 20 games to guys like that but he showed nothing in the first 10 and likely due to nepotism they gave him another 10 to prove himself. Neither of them proved they deserve a spot and that's why we traded for DSP and Kassian.  For the record Scott Gomez was a terrible person to acquire as soon as it happened. It was clear to absolutely everyone. Scouting staffs can be retarded some times and are not immune to criticism.  They also re-signed Morgan Ellis who has no NHL potential. The farm team still needs players."
Habs,3d4bbp,Swiffer-Jet,1 point,Tue Jul 14 06:32:36 2015 UTC,They brought him up for 18 games. He got one goal. A singular goal. He didn't really do anything at all. Look at his stat lines. He was signed for AHL depth. You need to ice two teams remember?
Habs,3d4bbp,MessageBoard,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:25:53 2015 UTC,"Totally agree with you. Thomas just doesn't offer anything interesting. Too small to grind, not a consistent goalscorer, not at all a playmaker or puck carrier, definitely not shaping into a two-way forward, etc... so what chair do you give him?   Put him on a line with DLR and Eller, you know exactly what you're getting from these two, but Thomas? Well you'd want him to be a finisher. Capitalize on the plays and space created by the other two. Is he able to do this? Meh, there seems to be better right handed options."

He had an amazing rookie year and everyone loves him and the Staals. I doubt they would see him go because he puts more effort into each game than every player but Gerbe. Skinner didnt perform too well this season, but he was still spectacular. I don't think you know Skinner at all to propose that trade because it doesnt address their needs. The Canes would never accept that. Maybe if you gave em a first and a prospect with Eller, but Skinner is younger, produces more, and has put a lot more effort in his game.   Unrealistic, but I'd love to see him as a Hab."

He's not very good defensively (don't give me the back check crap or that he broke up a handful of plays).  He's mediocre offensively while playing with a 35+ goal scorer.  Plekanec is a two way beast who dispute playing poorly every play offs doesnt hurt the team.  Eller while pigeonholed into a defensive role, plays well defensively and continues to improve of faces offs.  4 straight years of leading the bottom 6 in points.  DD is the odd man out.  5+ mins of PP/game, no SH responsibilities, highest O-zone starts, all sub 60pts all while playing pretty much exclusively to Pacioretty is garbage."
Habs,3d8bif,Swiffer-Jet,3,Wed Jul 15 06:16:04 2015 UTC,Hey I'd like to acquire players with unfair trades too OP!  It's almost insulting that you say that it would beneficial for both teams when you're clearly being a fanboy incapable of truly looking at it with a neutral perspective.  Why would Eller play a better role there? They already have two veteran centers ahead of him in the Staal bros. They also have two good young centers in Lindholm and Rask. Eller would still be at best on the third line. You're also assuming that if Eller would have more minutes and better teammates he'd automatically perform better but that's unproven and a risk the Canes would not take.
Habs,3d8bif,Swiffer-Jet,-6,Tue Jul 14 10:31:00 2015 UTC,"Buddy, if you are capable of reading. I clearly stated that and I quote ""if the value isn't fair, we can make the second a 1st or add prospects.""   Not to mention that the article I linked suggest that theyre looking for a Sutter/Bozak kind of player. Eller is meant to be a second line center but plays third line because Therrien prefers to play the more offensively minded Desharnais in the top 6. It is not unfair to the team to suggest that a potential second line center could flourish in a situation where he gets to play top 6 minutes.   Also, let's not forget the kind of deals Kessel and Sharp were traded for. This sets a standard to the rest of the league. Players are going for much less than they should. Especially someone who has had 2 concussions in a very short span of time.   Edit in response to your edit: Staal plays wing next to Staal. And no, its not unproven that Eller would produce better in a top 6 role. He has produced every time he was placed into that role. Especially during the playoffs. Except this year be had very limited time in that role and thus could not show that. However, if you've followed the team for at least the last 4 years, you'd know that yes he did produce at a much higher rate with better linemates."
Habs,3d8bif,Swiffer-Jet,2,Tue Jul 14 10:36:13 2015 UTC,"You're still forgetting Lindholm and Rask.  Two more offensively gifted centers and younger than Eller. Carolina is doing alright at center, they need wingers."
Habs,3d8bif,Swiffer-Jet,-4,Tue Jul 14 10:45:17 2015 UTC,"Lindholm would make more sense in there but Rask does not. I can't see us departing with a roster winger tbh. Not to mention multiple moves have to be made for us to be able to accommodate Skinner as a winger if that's the case. Chucky can't be a winger forever and with the DLR/Eller/DD logjam, we we have to move one."
Habs,3d8bif,Gabroux,1 point,Tue Jul 14 10:46:22 2015 UTC,Well that's what the Canes need. Let's not trade with them then.
Habs,3d8bif,jo_maka,-2,Tue Jul 14 10:47:31 2015 UTC,"I edited.  To continue...  What could be done is moving Eller for a pick (or DD whichever one), in a later trade thus allowing us to trade a winger prospect + a 1st for Skinner.   But for them to want a Sutter or Bozak means they might move both Rask and Lindholm into wing"
Habs,3d8bif,jo_maka,1 point,Tue Jul 14 10:48:06 2015 UTC,"You're putting all your fate on one shitty blog post that might not even be true. What's true is that when I look at their current roster, center is not their weak point. I don't what they'd with Bozak/Suter while weakening their LW and still having an abysmal RW.  What's funny is that in all your replies you're mostly talking about the Habs situation... thus proving the point I was trying to make."
Habs,3d8bif,jo_maka,0,Tue Jul 14 10:59:14 2015 UTC,"What's funny is that in all your replies you're mostly talking about the Habs situation... thus proving the point I was trying to make.   Ah yes attacking my argument, how wonderful.  Except you seem to be forgetting that they're a rebuilding team. Fine, a roster player isn't going to be what they need thus why I suggested a prospect like Andrighetto who would help fix some of their RW issues while they also get a 1st round pick they could use to draft a winger.   In return, Montreal, a playoff team, would get the goal scorer they need that may help them score more and become a cup contender  Skinner is young, sure, but a rebuilding team could probably benefit more from dealing him in exchange for pieces that will be ready by the time they're done rebuilding. Because Carolina right now is one of the favourites to finish wayyy out of the race. They don't care to win now. They want to win when Hanifin hits his prime. Skinner would be out of his prime by then.   Before you say anything, Andrighetto is the favourite to slot into our 2nd line RW spot out of all our prospects this year."
Habs,3d8bif,AwkwardAwkwardness,1 point,Tue Jul 14 11:05:41 2015 UTC,"Well now you're starting to make more sense. Though if I'm Carolina, Ghetto is not the kind of prospect that would make me all that excited. Give me Scherbak and we can start talking about that Skinner trade."
Habs,3d8bif,AwkwardAwkwardness,0,Tue Jul 14 11:35:44 2015 UTC,"I think moving Scherbak, Hudon or McCarron is out of the question for Bergevin. So if Carolina did counter with that, the deal would be called off."
Habs,3d8bif,MessageBoard,2,Tue Jul 14 11:52:35 2015 UTC,"Not interested. Another small player who's probably one concussion away from retiring. He's a nice player, but I doubt that he will stay in the league much longer"

We're trying to get bigger, and you wanna get rid of one of our only good physical player who is also a good defensive player to acquire a small damaged overpaid offensive forward to have him play in a risk-averse team system anyway ?  You're just digging a bigger hole. One that we're already almost out of in the last 2 years. One Skinner won't help if we need to get rid of Eller for that to happen.  The problem is not just the personel. It's mostly the use of said personel."
Habs,3d8bif,LeMAD,-2,Tue Jul 14 11:05:33 2015 UTC,"See, this is the shit the fan base is going to feel.   One way: ""oh boy Eller sucks its not fair value you're a homer blah blah blah""  The other: ""oh god Skinner is weak we need hits""  Like fuck damn. I'm suggesting something that could help out the Habs score more not hit more. If Eller doesn't get moved then move a prospect but Skinner is one of the only wingers available that could become part of our core.   Skinner is still rather young. He has huge potential but has no one to protect him. In a system with players like Kassian, Weise, Pateryn, Beaulieu, Pacioretty, etc. he will be much better protected."
Habs,3d8bif,quadriplegic_cheetah,3,Tue Jul 14 11:09:33 2015 UTC,"Easy young blood.  I'd rather bank on 0 concussion no cap hit Ghetto than invest in someone else's damaged goods that'll tie up good numbers in the books.  Bring me someone else than Skinner, we'll talk about it. But this is a no-no."

Habs,3d7f3b,jo_maka,12,Tue Jul 14 03:09:53 2015 UTC,"Kassian, Wiese, and maybe even Hudon will put up more points in 2015-2016 than Gionta will (if Gionta plays). Love the guy, but he doesn't fill an empty role in MTL."
Habs,3d7f3b,djohnston02,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:07:26 2015 UTC,I thought Hudon was a LW.
Habs,3d7f3b,deus_vult_a_cracker,-4,Tue Jul 14 16:48:44 2015 UTC,Kassian has a chance if he can pull it together. Weise Wont come anywhere close and hudon would have to make a big leap to do it. You seem to be forgetting that even with the garbage he played with last year he had comparable ppg to previous years and next year he will likely be on eichels wing so a dip in production is unlikely. He is by far the safest bet to put up the most points next year  Theres also a bunch of stuff goonta did that none of the guys you listed provide. He was an elite nhl pker. He had one of the best relationships with the referees (funny how we went from the team that got the most calls to one of the fewest the moment he left)
Habs,3d7f3b,GenZero,2,Tue Jul 14 03:23:50 2015 UTC,"Haha yeah, I swear to god we didn't get one goal overturned/allowed the entire year this year, it really got to me"
Habs,3d7f3b,SiegeWar,5,Tue Jul 14 04:28:01 2015 UTC,Wrong.
Habs,3d7f3b,quadriplegic_cheetah,2,Tue Jul 14 04:29:02 2015 UTC,These are pretty baseless opinions. Highly unlikely he's with Eichel. Very very unlikely. And our PK is dominant without him. And you really seem to be sleeping on Hudon. Hudon seriously has 40-50 point potential as soon as next year. Much rather him right now.
Habs,3d7f3b,quadriplegic_cheetah,1 point,Tue Jul 14 06:02:17 2015 UTC,"Gionta right now is their best natural rw and is arguably their best winger defensively it makes a lot of sense for him to be there. Plus with the ""character"" that is on that team who do they want in eichels ear kane? Ryan the tims smasher? Or brian gionta the player with a long successful career and one of the most respected players in the  league?   And im not sleeping on hudon im just not wearing the homer glasses on this one. Dsp last year was coming in with the same ppg in the ahl the previous and he didnt come close to 40 points. Bournival was scoring at the same pace in the ahl last year after being sent down and he couldnt crack the habs roster. Until hudon actually does it its way more likely he cant than can."
Habs,3d7f3b,quadriplegic_cheetah,0,Tue Jul 14 11:47:22 2015 UTC,"And so was Gallagher.... Are you implying there is a direct relationship between AHL and NHL point totals? Because Gallagher actually scored at a worse pace than DSP, Hudon and Gallagher have more talent than DSP and Bournival.   You suggested an option, but nobody really agrees with you. Like at all. Nobody wants a 37 year old 5'7 PK guy for our top 6. So stop telling everybody they are wrong.   And yes Kane and Eichel will play together. 100%. The whole reason they acquired Kane is to give Eichel/McDavid a young winger when they get here. And it's likely they will play with either Ennis or ROR as well. Gionta at this point is nothing more than a 3rd liner/ PK guy, and we have enough of those."
Habs,3d7f3b,JMPesce,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:56:24 2015 UTC,Gallagher can be explained easily as a short term outlier who was eased into the ahl so he didnt get the necessary icetime.   Care to give me some evidence to prove hes a 3rd line guy because no one has beyond the hes old comments. Points wise he was 40th among rw which given there are 30 teams makes him an above average ro elite second liner. Ppg makes him look even better. Then there is the defensive side. He has constantly been among the players who player the hardest minutes and has played them effectively includig generating offense as shown above. Ao if he is top 6 material offensively and has elite level defense where exactly does that add up to third line?
Habs,3d7f3b,paul_33,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:40:28 2015 UTC,"No Gallagher can't be at all. There is very minimal correlation between AHL success and NHL success. Loon at Marko Dano, it's the same thing. Hudon has the talent to play well in a top 6 role, just like Gallagher and Dano.  Gionta is starting to regress, we can fill his spot with cheaper, and younger players. It's the better option."

Habs,3d7f3b,MessageBoard,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:32:55 2015 UTC,Yeah he clearly lost a step. Being force fed first line minutes on an all time level bad team is the reason he even kept up his pace.
Habs,3d7f3b,hank0,2,Tue Jul 14 09:46:06 2015 UTC,Except he was playing extremely defensive minute always having top 3 defensive zone start percentage and qoc he wasnt being given easy mins by any stretch
Habs,3d7f3b,WaldorfTheGreat,0,Tue Jul 14 12:31:52 2015 UTC,That was because he failed miserably when they tried to give him offensive minutes. Therrien absolutely loved Gionta and even he pulled Gionta from the PP by the end of the season. Double bicep tear ruined him as an offensive player.

Habs,3cz0k9,habuheard,3,Sun Jul 12 21:24:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah, playing wing clearly limits one's ability to score."
Habs,3cz0k9,SonofMustachio,2,Sun Jul 12 16:40:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah, playing wing the wrong position clearly limits one's ability to score."
Habs,3cz0k9,MustardTiger1337,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:44:25 2015 UTC,It's not like they're putting him on defense. That's where he prefers to play. How is it the wrong position?
Habs,3cz0k9,SonofMustachio,3,Sun Jul 12 20:13:03 2015 UTC,prefers to play? He's a center.
Habs,3cz0k9,MustardTiger1337,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:26:55 2015 UTC,He was only for a bit in junior and hasn't been since.
Habs,3cz0k9,SonofMustachio,2,Sun Jul 12 20:33:41 2015 UTC,He was drafted as a center and wants to play center. Don't know why you are trying to argue this?
Habs,3cz0k9,MustardTiger1337,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:44:39 2015 UTC,"Markov used to play as a forward.   Chucky can play both C and LW. Obviously we want him as our future 1C but if he can't play that at NHL level, he can't."
Habs,3cz0k9,BusShelter16,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:17:02 2015 UTC,"So one gets the ""that level"" by playing out of position? Gotcha"

Habs,3cz0k9,CorsiGod,2,Sun Jul 12 10:51:12 2015 UTC,"We could be anywhere from 2-5, I think Tampa will win the conference. But who knows, Carey Price is the answer"
Habs,3cz0k9,Razorback101,2,Sun Jul 12 05:01:04 2015 UTC,I see us being in the 4-5 range
Habs,3cz0k9,outtokill7,1 point,Sun Jul 12 08:57:38 2015 UTC,"I think we have the potential to be a Stanley Cup contender, but we need to wait and see how the team pans out. Our offence might be weaker, but it certainly has potential, and until that is tested it is very hard to tell. With the new additions we could get a very stellar combo on a line or two that we just didn't have before. Lots of testing to be done in order to get the most out of our players."
Habs,3cz0k9,hockeyrugby,1 point,Sun Jul 12 07:17:18 2015 UTC,I think we need to remember the realistic quote that Bergevin said last summer. We need to make the playoffs and then see what happens.
Habs,3cz0k9,eriverside,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:47:25 2015 UTC,"Last year we had great defence, outstanding goaltending and shitty offence.  If our defence stays as good and Carey has a similar year we should perform even better. Because if the offence doesn't pick it up, MB won't have a choice but to make some coaching changes."
Habs,3cz0k9,TurboDragon,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:20:55 2015 UTC,"We'll be second in the Atlantic behind Tampa and above Detroit. We'll win the first round against the Red Wings but lose to the Lightning in the second.  However, we'll make it to the Stanley Cup final the following year."
Habs,3cz0k9,fatneszsebby,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:48:52 2015 UTC,We will be better then last year. Just know that.
Habs,3cz0k9,clearsimpleplain,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:57:22 2015 UTC,"We aren't the best team in the East. We probably aren't even the top 5 in the West. But we can finish 1st in the East and top 3 overall because of Price. Regular season favors us because our best player plays 60 minutes for the majority of games. Goaltenders can make that difference. So that's my prediction. There's no way we have to fight for Wild Card.  Playoffs are a different animal. I said we aren't the best team in the East and that's true, but we're good enough to beat any other Eastern team and not have it feel like robbery. The flip side is that we can lose to any of the Top 8 teams in the East pretty easily too and it won't be totally shocking. It's close. We could lose first round or make it to the Cup Finals, it just depends on our fortitude and luck.  The West is where things fall apart. Whoever comes out of the West will be a monster. But we aren't so bad that we can't steal a 7-game series. It'd have to be a steal but it's a shot. There are a lot of teams that would kill to be in that kind of position, and it's an opportunity for sure.  If I had to make a playoff prediction, I'd say we're good enough to make it to the Conference Finals, where we either lose to a better team or win, then quickly lose to a much better team in the Cup Finals. But while a first-round exit would be disappointing, we could easily face a better team than us first round and lose."
Habs,3cz0k9,Baratatat,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:12:08 2015 UTC,"probably middle of the pack somewhere, unless we change up some strategy. If we go into the season with the same dump and chase system with the same shitty powerplay then we'll end up 2nd or 3rd in the division. The additions really dont change the team that much. Kassian has always played below his potential, and I think this city is going to turn on him and run him out of town a month into the season.   Theres some promising rookies but I have a hard time seeing Therrien giving them too much ice time. I have a bad feeling we'll end up trading one of them because they ""didnt fit the system"" or some other generic line.   As long as the franchise stays healthy, we'll probably make it into the playoffs. Maybe we'll win a round if we play a weak opponent. The only reason we beat Ottawa was because of a flukey goal by Gallagher and an egregious ref mistake. We barely outplayed them that series. But beyond that we didn't fix the actual problem (offense) and management seems hellbent on defending the tactics that we used last season.  If Price goes down I can see us missing the playoffs entirely."
Habs,3cz0k9,scelement,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:48:08 2015 UTC,"My prediction is that we place 4-5th in the east. Tampa, Washington, Rangers, islanders and maybe Ottawa are all pretty secure playoff teams in my mind but if we can fix the power play and add some scoring this team is very solid."
Habs,3cz0k9,MustardTiger1337,2,Tue Jul 14 01:45:14 2015 UTC,This team will not win a Stanley Cup with Desharnais playing in the top 6. Bank it
Habs,3cz0k9,Funkenbrain,-2,Sun Jul 12 16:42:40 2015 UTC,"That's the big if. If Price is merely above-average then we're fighting for a wild card spot. As he gets better, we get better. I see us making the playoffs, 2nd in the Atlantic behind Tampa. The Metro's going to be a bloodbath next season, with 5  good teams in the hunt, so we'll be in a fight every round."
Habs,3cz0k9,TheHydroImpulse,6,Sun Jul 12 02:14:35 2015 UTC,"People asserting we'd have 30 (or X) more goals against (and thus be a much worse team) if Price was average is nonsense. If Price was average, then the team in front often has to play that much better to win, or push that much harder. You can't simply go back in time and try tweaking different numbers to reflect a different scenario because the team probably wouldn't play like that in that case. They would certainly compensate appropriately, like any other team does.  Statistics have their place, but just because MTL leaned a bit on Price's performance doesn't mean they need to do that. I believe the team has enough pieces to compensate for a more average goaltender. Are we the same team? Maybe, maybe not. We certainly shouldn't be scared in making above average goaltending a part of the team."
Habs,3cz0k9,boomboomsubban,2,Sun Jul 12 06:06:12 2015 UTC,"If there are better ways to play without Price, why aren't we using them with Price to be a stronger team? What strategy isn't improved by having an elite goaltender? Stats are used to emphasise points, no one is saying things would go exactly like they show."
Habs,3cz0k9,Funkenbrain,1 point,Sun Jul 12 08:09:59 2015 UTC,"Well, we have 1 piece of information in that regard, how the team played without Price last year. Presumably you expect the team to give up fewer shots knowing that Tokarski's in net?  When we look at the numbers, when Tokarski started we gave up 32.7 shots against per game, with Price 29.6. So, our defence was worse overall, and we picked up 10 points out of 28. How many games would it take, do you think, for the guys to start trying harder?  Asserting that the team will magically play better, or that MT will change tactics to fit his team, just doesn't seem credible.   Also, I didn't assert any of the things you mentioned.   So, can we score more next year? Maybe. Kassian's should outscore Prust, and we've got kids with offense, but it's still going to be a transition team giving up shots."
Habs,3cz0k9,TheHydroImpulse,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:21:40 2015 UTC,"Its a bit harder to reason about it when we don't have a larger sample size. But I agree during those games, the team didn't play well, neither did Tokarski.  I don't think its magical or anything. In fact, I believe MT's regular season system would be the issue.   The bottom line is that good teams need to adapt, that's it. I guess when people point to MTL only being a single man team, it's a demonstration that people don't believe we're a good team.  When Patches got hurt last time, the team adapted to compensate for it. When Tokarski played in the conference finals, we were certainly able to keep up for the most part, the games were pretty close iirc. We just keep breaking down during game 6 when we have a significant series deficit."
Habs,3cz0k9,Funkenbrain,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:10:26 2015 UTC,"Then you have an opinion I don't, that our regular season system helps.   For the record, I do believe in our team, just not our coach.   I think we make the playoffs, but I don't think MT can bring us home. I'd be happy to be wrong."
Habs,3cz0k9,TheHydroImpulse,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:09:42 2015 UTC,"Oh I don't believe in the regular season system, sorry. I chose the wrong wording for that."
Habs,3cz0k9,Funkenbrain,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:23:18 2015 UTC,"Remember that Pacioretty quote from around the end of the season though? 'We've been playing playoff hockey all year.'  There wasn't a major change at the end of the season, and everyone was already gassed."
Habs,3cz0k9,MustardTiger1337,-4,Mon Jul 13 13:14:20 2015 UTC,This team cant score. If Price lets in 1 more goal every 5 games we miss the playoffs. Not that hard to understand.
Habs,3cz0k9,Boomsticks,-3,Sun Jul 12 16:35:42 2015 UTC,"I honestly believe that we will miss the playoffs.  Two things happened last year, Price had one of the greatest goaltending performances of all time and we had very little to no injuries.  I am willing to bet that if Carey's save percentage dips by a couple hundreths of a percent, it will be the difference between 4-5 wins on last year, and that will be significant enough to knock us out of the playoffs. Columbus and Florida are MUCH better and will be in the hunt.  The thing that might save us is how will the Red Wings adapt to Blashill? They are the only team in the East that I can see potentially dropping out of the playoffs (besides the Habs) and if that happens we will be in a dog fight with the BJs and Panthers for the last spot.  Michel Therrien did a good job, but he is not going to get anything else out of this team. He needs to go, and missing the playoffs will hopefully do that. The scary part is, who will succeed him?"
Habs,3cz0k9,thejokersrs,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:36:04 2015 UTC,Dood.  Even if Price get's injured and we have to rely on Tokarski we are still placing 3rd in the division.  The Atlantic is incredibly weak.
Habs,3cz0k9,Boomsticks,0,Mon Jul 13 20:02:27 2015 UTC,"Seriously?  Withouth Price, the only team that is MAYBE worse than us are the Leafs."
Habs,3cz0k9,thejokersrs,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:02:33 2015 UTC,"C'mon man, you can't really believe that.  We are much better than Boston and Florida. Ottawa is a worse team than us, unless they get their goalies to perform miracles. Buffalo is a wild card, they could be great, or they could be basement dwellers, I'm guessing basement for 1 more season.   Detroit and Tampa are far better than the habs"

Habs,3czcgb,notwithoutmypenis,12,Sun Jul 12 03:53:35 2015 UTC,"Our young guys will most likely fill the hole ""if there even is one"" at the start of the season. Hudon already has the potential to play as a top 6 forward. And he could be a really good one next year. Galchenyuk is primed to hit 60+ points. Andrighetto can fill a top 6 role as well, and from what we've seen, do a great job. And we got Kassian who is going to be a huge bonus, most likely getting is 15-20 goals instead of 8 from PAP.   We didn't have a lot of offensive support last year, we basically had 5 top 6 guys due to injuries to PAP. The only difference is that our young guys will be hitting their stride (Galchenyuk, Gallagher) and are more than ready to fill the holes with top 6 talent (Andrighetto, Hudon). And some people are speculating Sherbak/ McCarron might be ready for a shot as well.   We have a lot of options right now for that last top 6 spot. Our depth is arguable better than last year."
Habs,3czcgb,quadriplegic_cheetah,7,Sun Jul 12 05:21:55 2015 UTC,"If the Habs can fix their abysmal power play, they don't need one. Stop worrying. =)"
Habs,3czcgb,thinkinofaname,6,Sun Jul 12 04:16:49 2015 UTC,"We would have another 8.6 goals if we had a 20% PP ranking (above league average). If we had the best power play in the league (25.5%), we would have an additional 22 goals (Assuming we still had a total of 243 opportunities). While we theoretically have the players to produce a killer PP, I don't think it's realistic to expect that after a few years of having an awful PP.  However, the PP during the regular season wasn't that bad. People love to announce that MTL is 23rd this or 22nd that, when in reality, the jump from low 20s to top 10 is a meagre 6 goals on 13 less opportunities. Most of these statistics have small sample sizes (during a single season), so a few increments (or decrements) can do wonders to rankings.  Our PP in the playoffs was indeed awful! If we had kept our 16.5% PP efficiency, we would have been good.  Also remember that Chicago had a 17.6% PP efficiency, and The New York Rangers had a 16.8% PP efficiency, the latter netting a goal less than MTL. But how many times have the media mentioned this?  Comparing our PP scoring to TB (18.8% with 53 goals on 282 opportunities):  They basically have three main scorers in Stamkos (11G, 12A with 3.52 TOI/Gm), Callahan (10G, 6A with 3.01 TOI/Gm), Johnson (8G, 9A with 2.21 TOI/Gm). The rest of the scoring is pretty distributed with players having 3G (Hedman, Palat, Drouin) or less.  For us, we have: P.K. (8G, 13A with 3.62 TOI/Gm), Pacioretty (7G, 4A with 2.58 TOI/Gm), Plek (7G, 8A with 2.13 TOI/Gm), Markov (4G, 21A with 3.19 TOI/Gm). Then we have Gallagher (2.40 TOI/Gm) and Galchenyuk (2.18 TOI/Gm) with 3G 5A and 3G 8A, respectively.   edit: For reference, during the 2013 season, MTL was ranked 19th in PP % (17.2%) with 48 goals on 279 opportunities. The league average was 17.9% during that year.  If we can maintain a respectable, consistent (i.e., throughout the playoffs) PP (even if it's slightly better than last years') it'll be fine."

Better now than in February, but here's hoping that they bring in some forward depth so that Pacioretty doesn't have to rush back and or play too many big minutes too soon after recovering.  It's a marathon not a sprint.  And there are some decent stop gap/low risk options out there via UFA too, so they don't even really need to use assets on a guy like Sharp."

Habs,3cu9p8,chrislopez_,5,Sat Jul 11 01:18:36 2015 UTC,"It's true, the guy usually plays with Desharnais and whoever Therrien pulls from the 3rd line. If he had regular talent along side of him he would be one of the games greats."
Habs,3cu9p8,ancienthunter,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:04:45 2015 UTC,Anyone who has followed advanced stats is well aware of how good he is. The guy has some of the best corsi and PDO out there.
Habs,3cu9p8,CrossingSign,-3,Sat Jul 11 15:18:51 2015 UTC,We gotta get him a first line centre not a guy who's thrown into the first line just because his name is French.
Habs,3cu9p8,Brys_Beddict,-1,Sat Jul 11 04:18:14 2015 UTC,"Oh come on. I'm tired of this Desharnais/French-bashing bullshit. AFAIK, he's the best playmaker on this team and he developped a chemistry with Pacioretty that no one else has been able to reproduce on the same level. If it makes you feel better tho, Desharnais is hated just as much in the french community. Montreal is lucky to have someone to complement Pacioretty, Otherwise they'd have only one line, because Plekanec would be the only worthy centerman for him. Eller is a 3rd liner, he lacks the creativity and vision to establish himself as an offensive player."
Habs,3cu9p8,thetruekimmox,2,Sat Jul 11 16:34:43 2015 UTC,"I am French and he's not a great play maker. He gets top minutes and top PP minutes and his amount primary assists for a ""number 1"" is pathetic. On any other team he would be a high third, low second centre."
Habs,3cu9p8,Brys_Beddict,2,Sat Jul 11 18:38:02 2015 UTC,"Who said he was a ""number 1"" center? I only talked about his playmaking skills, and him being the best playmaker on this team, which i agree with you sucks a lot because he's not a ""Great"" playmaker. Montreal's big problem is on the offence, it's been this way for years and it's the main reason they're stuck with a defensive system, they don't have enough talent to consistently pass the blue line with the puck. Anyways, if you guys really think he's getting icetime on an NHL TEAM because of his name, you need to watch some more games from around the league. Desharnais is not a number one center nor a great playmaker. He still got above average talent and seems to give great services during the regular season. But hey, maybe Dale Weise(Who's an awesome guy BTW, would love to have him in CHI) could fill in this spot in the line-up too. Nobody wants to trade big centermen with talent. Anyways, what's up with Galchenyuk? Why is he still a winger?"
Habs,3ctu0b,hkycoach,2,Fri Jul 10 18:51:53 2015 UTC,sickkkkkkkk footage
Habs,3ctu0b,Grand_Chief_Mathieu,2,Fri Jul 10 20:25:03 2015 UTC,"Oli is probably watching Carey now and is so proud. This is an amazing video, thanks for sharing!"
Habs,3ctu0b,enstrut,2,Fri Jul 10 20:28:05 2015 UTC,"Haha CP sounds like such a hoser, ""They say I'm Olie Jr..."" Hilarious. Great video."
Habs,3ct6tg,KantanaBrigante,11,Fri Jul 10 16:01:02 2015 UTC,"To sum up, his lines would be:   Patches/Pleks/Gally Chucky/Eller/Kassian DSP/DD/Weise Sven/Mitchell/La Rose Subban/Beaulieu Petry/Markov Emelin/Tinordi & Gilbert/Pateryn   Price/who cares  Your thoughts?"
Habs,3ct6tg,hkycoach,10,Fri Jul 10 16:01:23 2015 UTC,"I'd prefer:   1st line: Patches/Eller/Gally  I'd rather see Eller on the 1st with Patches/Gally, I think he and Gally would be good even with bad zone starts - coupled with Patches' finishing power and we'd have a line that could start in our end and end in theirs.  Second line: Chucky/Pleks/Kassian  Assuming that the 1st line (above) doesn't get all the OZone starts, we could soften the workload for this line, giving them the opportunity to show that they can be an offensive threat.  Third line: DLR/DD/Ghetto  I think DLR and Ghetto have enough offensive talent to put together some good shifts, but enough grit to be disciplined defensively.   Fourth line: Weise/Mitchell/DSP  Power and grind, enough said."
Habs,3ct6tg,Funkenbrain,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:59:04 2015 UTC,No space for Hudon though?
Habs,3ct6tg,hkycoach,1 point,Sat Jul 11 17:17:35 2015 UTC,"Well, with Patches out now...  But with Patches in, I think Hudon would have to knock Ghetto off the 3rd line.  As much as I like the look of Hudon I think 3rd line duties fit better with Ghetto."
Habs,3ct6tg,shiram,7,Sat Jul 11 17:25:42 2015 UTC,"DSP is a RW, and Andrighetto would be wasted on the 4th line. I can't see Therrien playing Beaulieu on the top D pairing."
Habs,3ct6tg,TheJustin72,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:03:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah, not posted RW LW. Just posted wingers.   Agree about Sven; it's exactly what Pacioretty was talking about when he was brought up the first time around. Sven is a top 6 or he's not playing in the NHL. Problem though is that he's going to have quite the time cracking that top six."
Habs,3ct6tg,Phridgey,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:06:41 2015 UTC,"I disagree, he just can't be in a 4th line role.  The NHL now, almost every team heavily relies on at least 3 lines for offence. Given some decent PP time, there's no reason to think Andrighetto can't be effective on the 3rd line.  It's when you use a player like him on the 4th line with career 4th liners that it doesn't make any sense."
Habs,3ct6tg,TheJustin72,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:10:09 2015 UTC,The Hawks most productive playoff line was the third. There's definitely a place for Ghetto playing a similar game.
Habs,3ct6tg,Phridgey,7,Fri Jul 10 17:54:38 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure how you concluded their 3rd line was their most productive in the playoffs since Toews, Kane and Hossa were their 3 highest scoring forwards....but I'm not going to nitpick.  I agree with you, in todays' NHL you need 3 lines that can score if you want to be a contender.  I believe Andrighetto and Hudon could both be a part of the habs' top 9 next year."
Habs,3ct6tg,TheJustin72,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:28:43 2015 UTC,"You're right, my statement is flat out false. I'm actually primarily a Hawks fan, and I'm trying to figure out where that came from. Maybe something to do with non-PP, combined linestats? The Hawks PP was uncharacteristically good, but make no mistake, the third line was absolutely incredible."
Habs,3ct6tg,shiram,3,Fri Jul 10 19:39:50 2015 UTC,"Haha it's all good dude.   Seems like the vast majority of people on here would either make some catty remark or just ignore the fact that they were wrong, so big ups to you for admitting as much.  That's often the way it goes in playoffs though especially, the top 2 lines really cancel each other out in many ways which leaves the depth lines as the most important.   Tampas' offence past their top 6 was absolutely non existant offensively in the playoffs basically from start to finish, while Chicagos' 3rd line on many nights was very dangerous.  In a way you were perhaps right too, it could be argued that the Hawks' 3rd line scoring depth was the difference between winning and losing in the end."
Habs,3ct6tg,TheJustin72,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:43:33 2015 UTC,"There's plenty player on RW, but apart from Gallagher, none have cemented a place on the roster. I do agree with /u/TheJustin72 that 3rd line can be ok for Andrighetto, but that depends on how Therrien uses the line."
Habs,3ct6tg,MustardTiger1337,0,Fri Jul 10 16:12:13 2015 UTC,"Another issue with the 3rd line and potentially using Desharnais there, is that he relaly just doesn't ahve the 2 way acumen to be able to ""carry"" young/inexperienced players. And likely that will be necessary  with whoever is on that 3rd line at center."
Habs,3ct6tg,TheJustin72,0,Fri Jul 10 16:18:43 2015 UTC,So other then that its gold? LOL what a mess
Habs,3ct6tg,paul_33,3,Sat Jul 11 15:10:37 2015 UTC,"That 3rd line sucks, that's my thought.  This is the conundrum for the Canadiens.  Eller clearly deserves more minutes and opportunities than Desharnais, yet if you move Desharnais into a 3rd line center role, with the poor scoring depth on the wings this team has, you are basically icing what could possibly be the worst 3rd line in the entire league."
Habs,3ct6tg,TheJustin72,2,Fri Jul 10 16:10:54 2015 UTC,Then get rid of DD and stop signing plugs. The third line needs to produce not just waste ice time.
Habs,3ct6tg,paul_33,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:05:42 2015 UTC,"I could not agree more. It's a non starter anyways, Therrien will never promote Eller and demote Desharnais.   The GM continues to cater to the coach, and the coach hasn't the slightest idea what he's doing.  Every single team statistic indicates this team has progressively gotten worse over the last 2 seasons, yet Bergevin is ""disappointed"" people would dare question the work of Therrien.  Quite frankly it's disturbing."
Habs,3ct6tg,MustardTiger1337,6,Fri Jul 10 17:16:28 2015 UTC,Because wins. Forget looking into it any deeper.
Habs,3ct6tg,TheJustin72,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:08:41 2015 UTC,Move DeeDee to the 3rd line Wing. Problem solved. He looked great there last year
Habs,3ct6tg,MustardTiger1337,0,Sat Jul 11 15:08:37 2015 UTC,"Lol, no he didn't."
Habs,3ct6tg,TheJustin72,3,Sat Jul 11 15:50:00 2015 UTC,LOLz. Yes he did. Not only did he get the easier match ups some of our young natural centers finally got to play their natural positions.
Habs,3ct6tg,MustardTiger1337,1 point,Sat Jul 11 16:52:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah, there were other benefits in the line up to finally removing him from a position he has no business playing in.  But he didn't play well. His numbers were atrocious, and eventually Therrien once again put him up higher in the line up without him earning it."
Habs,3ct6tg,TheJustin72,1 point,Sat Jul 11 17:14:37 2015 UTC,"No don't you remember the BS reason MT moved him back up? Chucky pulled MT aside and ""asked"" to be moved back to wing b/c he was uncomfortable playing his natural position. BUT this all was confirmed false this offseason"
Habs,3ct6tg,MustardTiger1337,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:15:52 2015 UTC,"Of course I remember that.   Like I said, another example of Desharnais getting a promotion in the line up despite neither earning or deserving it.  Disgraceful nonsense like always with that arrogant fool Therrien."
Habs,3ct6tg,TheJustin72,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:16:54 2015 UTC,Hate to say it but MT isn't the one pushing DD to the top line.
Habs,3ct6tg,TheJustin72,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:10:34 2015 UTC,Uhhh...does someone else make the lines?
Habs,3ct6tg,TheJustin72,-2,Sat Jul 11 19:27:31 2015 UTC,"But, if we could somehow get Gally to play third and replace him with a stud first line RW... While I'm dreaming here, hoping Kassian becomes the prototypical power forward on 2nd, cause we all should know that the likelihood of that happening are way below 50%."
Habs,3ct6tg,paul_33,13,Fri Jul 10 16:16:03 2015 UTC,"Gallager to play the 3rd line?  Good lord, sorry man you lost me there.  Maybe he's not a high end #1 RW...but he's without a doubt in the top 30-40 RW's in the NHL today."
Habs,3ct6tg,paul_33,-2,Fri Jul 10 16:20:06 2015 UTC,"Yes, to what you said.  Agreed, he's great. All I'm saying is IF this team could acquire a true 1RW and push Gally down to the third line (w/ Kassian working the 2nd; I'm in dream land), we would be in business. Don't get me wrong, love the heart, love the compete, love the character, but we still need a 1RW"
Habs,3ct6tg,TheJustin72,6,Fri Jul 10 16:29:05 2015 UTC,"I guess I just cannot really fathom how your ""dream land"" involves Gallagher playing on the 3rd line behind Zach Kassian of all people."
Habs,3ct6tg,SiegeWar,0,Fri Jul 10 16:38:52 2015 UTC,"That's what dreams are made of, mate; fluffy clouds and sweet popcorn.   It seems like you agree that the chances Kassian lives up to his fine words are next to nil. Agreed. Now, if we add a 1RW, where do you place Gally? On the 2nd? Yes, he would do his deeds well there, but does Gally need the line-mates to be effective? He is who he is. He will get you the crease points no matter where he stands in the lineup. He's an ultimate, but his skill set allows for versatility and does give the HABS the opportunity to open up that 2RW to Kassian (or Bozon, Sven, Sherbak, 'insert skill talent')"
Habs,3ct6tg,TheHydroImpulse,7,Fri Jul 10 16:50:00 2015 UTC,Kassian is not top 6. I'm not sure I understand where this keeps coming from. He's a plugger
Habs,3ct6tg,TheJustin72,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:06:36 2015 UTC,"Guess people are jumping on the bandwagon that once was owned by Buffalo and passed on to the Nucks. People believe that they're the ones who can make the difference, who can be the change he so desperately needs to be the player he SHOULD be. Saying all this, you're probably right..."
Habs,3ct6tg,player-piano,5,Fri Jul 10 17:10:51 2015 UTC,"He's going to be just like DSP: a bust. This team seems to love signing and trading for players that should be better but can't get it to the next level (Kovalev, Kostitsyn, Bourque, Gomez)"
Habs,3ct6tg,MustardTiger1337,5,Fri Jul 10 18:10:11 2015 UTC,"No, I think Kassian can be an effective player. But he's never scored 20 goals in a season and is older than Gallagher so it seems either wildly optimistic or flat out illogical to think he'll pass Gallagher in the depth charts any time soon.  Also if you've watched Kassian play much in his career, you'd know he is probably never going t obe a prototypical power forward, it's just not in his make up."
Habs,3ct6tg,MustardTiger1337,-2,Fri Jul 10 16:58:28 2015 UTC,I'll agree with that.   Still need a 1RW.
Habs,3ct6tg,Funkenbrain,6,Fri Jul 10 17:02:30 2015 UTC,GALLAGHER PRODUCES LIKE A FIRST LINE RW. HE JUST DOESNT HAVE THE ICE TIME HE DESERVES
Habs,3ct6tg,jo_maka,6,Fri Jul 10 19:44:25 2015 UTC,"We already have one. Gallagher is a lot better than most people think. If the PP gets up to par, he could very well hit 30 goals. Statistically speaking he's been excellent in 5v5."
Habs,3ct6tg,TurboDragon,4,Fri Jul 10 17:28:31 2015 UTC,"They aren't getting a better RW via trade than Gallagher.   And if we really watn to talk about what this team ""needs"" a #1 center is a far more pressing concern anyways."
Habs,3ct6tg,hurray4kimchi,-1,Fri Jul 10 17:15:31 2015 UTC,you have retarded dreams
Habs,3ct6tg,MustardTiger1337,2,Fri Jul 10 17:00:53 2015 UTC,If anyone is really hoping Kassian is going to slove our top 6 scoring problem I am sorry but its not going to happen. Kassian couldnt produce when he was pair with the twins.

The Habs couldn't have bested that offer in some way to get Matthias?  A nice smooth skating guy with size and the ability to pot 15+ in a season?   If the Habs really were interested, how do they not find a way to get him?"

Habs,3ctczw,casparbain,19,Fri Jul 10 16:48:10 2015 UTC,"Keep him, have him in St-Johns competing with Condon for the #1 spot. His stock has fallen, so his value is down, not worth trading, might as well see what he can do. Goalies take time to develop, so be patient."
Habs,3ctczw,shiram,2,Fri Jul 10 16:51:44 2015 UTC,"Yes,....long before Montreal can use him,there will be other teams looking to add someone to their roster.  There will be many teams looking for new blood by the time Fucale is ready,....and some of them might be in great need.  Not every team has an exceptional farm system."
Habs,3ctczw,ShivasIrons983E,6,Fri Jul 10 19:48:40 2015 UTC,"I think Fucale was compared to Price a lot in his career, but I think he's more of a bigger Halak. He's gonna let in some, but he'll make the clutch save. And he got hustle. So really, he's the hybrid of Price and Halak in term of style.  As for his value, there are 2 good times to trade a young goalie: in a package deal not too far removed from his draft when his value is really high, or when he's good enough to be a starter but the logjam keeps him down (e.g.: Bernier). Right now, Zach is in the lull between those 2 points. We should never trade him during that time because his value is at its nadir. When I look at goalies of his generation (Makarov, Dansk, Comrie, Jarry, Subban), I'm pretty sure Zach will do more than okay in the NHL. Give him time."
Habs,3ctczw,jo_maka,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:55:36 2015 UTC,"Bernier hardly got anything (a backup goalie (Scrivens), 2nd and C tier prospect (Frattin)."
Habs,3ctczw,willhabs,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:43:19 2015 UTC,"Trades also depends on the market. The quality of the return is never guaranteed. If you choose, will you take Bernier as a starter or Martin Jones ?"
Habs,3ctczw,jo_maka,2,Sat Jul 11 00:45:54 2015 UTC,"Too early to call him a bust, but he seems to be very low on confidence or completely out of form right now, and therefore his value is way too low for him to be traded. Personally, I hope they send him to ECHL to start the season and get his groove back if possible. Condon is currently the undisputed AHL starter with another AHL vet Pasquale backing him up, so I see no place for Fucale there, and honestly, at the moment he doesn't even seem to be good enough for the AHL team, which desperately needs some success after a few quite disappointing seasons."
Habs,3ctczw,blind_,3,Fri Jul 10 19:17:49 2015 UTC,"most goalies nowadays are drafted after the 2nd round, your point does not make sense."
Habs,3ctczw,realcitystar76,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:12:31 2015 UTC,I guess we're spoiled by the fact that Price was a 1st round pick
Habs,3ctczw,SiegeWar,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:35:18 2015 UTC,"It's hard to tell if the kid will have any future, I mean he never played a pro game yet. Last memorial cup he almost got stolen his starting goaltender position by Callum Booth (2nd goalie of the Quebec Remparts), but overall the kid has done well.  We have to see how he does with the IceCaps before judging, but with Mike Condon also there, I wouldn't mind trading him away in a block trade if that brings us that much needed scoring"
Habs,3ctczw,realcitystar76,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:41:37 2015 UTC,"It was a poor and illogical use of a high 2nd round pick.  Goalies take a long time to develop, so he was likely never going to be an impact player with this teams' core.  And goalies historically have pretty middling trade value for the most part as well, so even as a trade chip it's highly unlikely he'd help out this teams' current core.  No real sense trading him, no one is giving up anything for him. Just a wasted pick."
Habs,3ctczw,TheJustin72,0,Fri Jul 10 19:13:53 2015 UTC,"So..........basically, you're saying we should never draft a goalie if it's in the first 2 rounds ?  I'm sure happy that Gainey did even when he still had Theodore."
Habs,3ctczw,jo_maka,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:30:35 2015 UTC,"I think there's a big difference between drafting a goalie at #5 than drafting one in the 2nd round.  I think it's pretty obvious when you look at recent trends in drafting that the value of goalies when it comes to draft picks is very questionable.   And to add to that, Theodore NEVER had the big game pedigree that Price had, even at his best he was still a bit of a smaller guy who relied more on his athleticism than anything. Price is just surreal in the way he plays the game.  But in any event, yes if I'm a GM I would not use a top 60 pick on a goalie, especially not if I had a goalie like Price in the organization.  They take much longer to develop than d-men and forwards, they have weaker trade value than d-men and forwards, and since there's only one goalie that can start a game it means that it's much more difficult for a young goalie to have any impact on the organization.  It's great that Price turned out amazing, but I don't think he is proof that the Fucale pick was a smart one.   What is your rationale for defending the pick? Anything to do with Fucale or does it all revolve around Price?"
Habs,3ctczw,TheJustin72,2,Fri Jul 10 19:50:22 2015 UTC,"Actually, if you remember before the draft, Fucale wasn't even supposed to get past #30. Teams tend to look for quick fix and would rather get a forward or Dman instead of a goalie because of their ETA. That is what takes away the value. But it doesn't take away the skillset of the goalie, especially when you draft as per BPA (which Mtl tends to do past the 1st round). We had 3 players that was pegged as late 1st in our 2nd. We definitely could afford to have him. The first player we took in the 2nd is already an active contributor to the team right now. That draft was deep enough that you can't get hung up on the wording ''2nd round'' to really find a cutoff in the skillsets of the prospects. Anything until mid-2nd that year could have been a 1st rounder and nobody would lose any sleep.  All in all, what I'm saying is this value you attach to drafting goalies in the second is not set in stone, it depends on the team drafting.   Also, I mentioned in this thread that when we drafted Price, we already had Halak since 2003. Well, when we drafted Fucale, we didn't have anything resembling a goalie pipeline. Only now we have Fucale and Hawkey. Condon will take the AHL spot, but since he's closer to the NHL than Fucale, we'll probably lose him to the logjam. Which is why, even in the ETA is long, when you have a good player available, you just draft.   If you really wanna talk about wasted pick in 2013, I'd say it was the 3rd used for Crisp. Especially since Duclair was still on the boards."
Habs,3ctczw,jo_maka,0,Fri Jul 10 20:06:27 2015 UTC,"I have always said that if it wasn't for the higher 2nd round pick used on De La Rose there's no way they would have ever used that pick on Fucale.  With the De La Rose pick, and another late 2nd, they had the luxury to take a goalie.  Still doesn't mean it made sense.  Halak in 2003 has nothing to do with Price.  And Price in 2005 has nothing to do with Fucale.  Drafting goalies is just clearly the lowest value pick you can make in the draft, and for a team with a franchise goalie it's odd to use such a high value pick on one.  But, in light of the other picks, it makes a bit of sense."
Habs,3ctczw,TheJustin72,2,Fri Jul 10 20:23:40 2015 UTC,"Yes the Halak pick mattered in drafting Price. If you watch the draft interview of Gainey after McGuire's freakout, he mentions it, essentially pointing out that he's doubling down on goalie depth because he wanted to make sure we were never weak at that position."
Habs,3ctczw,jo_maka,-1,Fri Jul 10 22:55:25 2015 UTC,"Lol, who cares what McGuire says?  A 2003 7th round pick had no more to do with drafting Price 5th overall in 2005 than drafting Price 5th overall in 2005 has to do with Fucale.  Goalies are a huge risk when it comes to drafting, and even if they pay off, 9 times out of 10 they are going to take significantly longer to have an impact on the organization than a d-man or forward would.  This team, in 2013, had Price, Subban and Pacioretty already in the fold and already looking like franchise cornerstones...  Fucale was a luxury pick made possible by the picks acquired by the much maligned Gauthier. Not really a big deal taking him there, but they could have made better value picks."
Habs,3ctczw,TheJustin72,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:33:31 2015 UTC,"""Value pick"" is really just a pseudo-scientific notion. Draft by its very nature is a crapshoot. What you do is try to pick the prospects most likely to become good players. And since those can come from any round, you just pick the best guy.   Who would you have taken in his spot ?"
Habs,3ctczw,jo_maka,1 point,Sat Jul 11 01:48:07 2015 UTC,"I'm not a scout and I don't really follow prospects.  But I would have taken a d-man or a forwward.  And it's not ""pseudo-scientific notion"" (whatever the hell that last part means lol) it's a straight up fact.   Goalies take far longer to develop than d-men and forwards."
Habs,3ctczw,TheJustin72,3,Sat Jul 11 02:02:28 2015 UTC,"And they can be bust just as anyone else also.   Also, how can you tell me this pick was a wasted one if you can't even tell me who wouldn't have been a ""waste"" ? Because at least 27 teams picked one of those things you like in that same round and I don't see a single one of them making the league yet. They can become a Lucic but they can also become a Maxwell. Shorter ETA doesn't help you win right away if it's not a key piece but only a supporting cast. Plus think how much you will be ransomed if you plan on trading and never developing your own goalie. And if there is a good goalie available at the spot you're picking then you pick a goalie. How much did Boston get for Martin Jones ?"

Habs,3ctczw,BinaryChode,8,Mon Jul 13 04:24:51 2015 UTC,That is extremely short-sighted. We had Theodore (and already drafted Halak two years prior) when we drafted Price.
Habs,3ctczw,jo_maka,-2,Fri Jul 10 18:27:30 2015 UTC,Trade him. He's our most overrated prospect and his value will depreciate in the AHL.
Habs,3ctczw,PuckingEh,4,Fri Jul 10 19:58:01 2015 UTC,Why would you trade him? He is worth about peanuts right now. You wait and see if he gets better or he is still peanuts. Nothing too bad can come out of him besides a wasted pick.

Habs,3csrye,casparbain,6,Fri Jul 10 14:08:55 2015 UTC,"To me it's more about the roster spot. Trying to develop Kassian, DSP or a rookie is a better use of that roster spot for the team.  And PAP was on a 4 million cap hit, not 6."

Habs,3csrye,Tastytunasandwich,0,Sat Jul 11 12:24:41 2015 UTC,"No surprise there, a lot of statistics indicated that Parenteau wasn't even playing particularly poor last year.  To add to that, he was with a new team, had some injury concerns, and had a lower shooting % than his career number.  Quite frankly, I don't find this belief that they needed to buy him out to give young players chances at roster spots anyways...it's counter productive if anything.  An open roster spot means that SOMEONE has to fill it.  A veteran like Parenteau there means that you have to EARN that spot.  When you add in the cost to replace Parenteaus' roster spot, the savings are a bit over 2 million, and it leaves them with a needless 1.3333 cap hit next year too.  Pretty poor asset management overall, no matter how people would like to argue otherwise."
Habs,3csrye,TheJustin72,2,Fri Jul 10 16:02:09 2015 UTC,"yeah, i really was hoping PAP would get another season, but nope."
Habs,3csrye,player-piano,0,Fri Jul 10 16:58:12 2015 UTC,"Especially when you factor in the total lack of signing any FA's I haven't the slightest idea how the 2 or so million the yultimately save on Parenteaus' cap space this year made sense to trade him.  In season, if a move came up and they needed some space, what are the odds they wouldn't be abl eto retain some salary on his remaining contract and move him out?  Just absolutely atrocious asset management. This teams' pro scouting has been abysmal for years."
Habs,3csrye,TheJustin72,2,Fri Jul 10 17:14:54 2015 UTC,"First of all you can't trade what no one wants. Just because you say ""oh just trade him during the season and retain salary"" doesn't mean it's possible to do so. I'm sure they tried to move him last year and couldn't. But lets go ahead and say they could, and they had to retain salary. TML signed him (without having to give anything up like they would have in a trade) to 1.5 million. So, if the Habs trade him mid season and the team that wants him is only willing to pay 1.5 out of his 4 million, then the habs are stuck with 2.5 million against their cap. 2.5million>1.3million.   You seem to be very adament that this was ""Terrible asset management"" by the Canadiens (you've said it 3 times now). Yet your arguments are far from convincing.   Edit: Spelling"
Habs,3csrye,theres__no_time,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:35:07 2015 UTC,"2.5 million against the cap this year might be >1.3 million  but when you factor in the 1.3 million on NEXT YEARS' CAP as well it is not really.  I'm not sure how my argument isn't convincing.  They traded the 1 year left on Briere for Parenteau, and proceeded to buy out Parenteau.  In 2015/2016 and 2016/2017 they will have a 1.333 cap hit for a player not with the organization.  How does it need to be argued that this was terrible asset management?  How could anyone with a straight face claim it was anything else?"
Habs,3csrye,TheJustin72,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:53:07 2015 UTC,"An interesting take on PAP.  While I agree on a lot of points, I'm not entirely convinced that a younger player would be given enough opportunity to earn a spot on the roster."
Habs,3csrye,TheJustin72,-2,Fri Jul 10 18:37:31 2015 UTC,"Then Bergevins' issue should be with Therrien, should it not?  In any event, there were no issues last year with sitting Parenteau despite having some of the worst forward depth in the entire league.   So why the need to buy him out?   Especially with one year left and the ability to retain salary.  This is another example of terrible asset management by Bergevin. It's really annoying that more people aren't calling him out on it."
Habs,3csrye,theres__no_time,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:26:11 2015 UTC,"When you add in the cost to replace Parenteaus' roster spot, the savings are a bit over 2 million, and it leaves them with a needless 1.3333 cap hit next year too.   Ok fine.   In any event, there were no issues last year with sitting Parenteau despite having some of the worst forward depth in the entire league. So why the need to buy him out?   So you're suggesting it would be better to have a player on the team with a $4mil cap hit sitting in the stands (not playing) taking up a roster spot than $1.3mil cap hit for to not play and which frees up a roster spot?"
Habs,3csrye,TheJustin72,0,Fri Jul 10 20:28:51 2015 UTC,"Yes, when you consider that because they  bought him out they now have a 1.3333 cap hit for a non roster player in 2016/2017 I am absolutely ""suggesting"" it would have been better to have a player on the team with a $4 mil cap hit sitting in the stands.  Actually, they could have waived Parenteau, and the cap savings provided would have been more than enough to make room for any single young player they deem ""ready"" to contribute on the Habs next year.  When you add in the potential to trade Parenteau as the season goes along and his salary is less AND the ability to retain salary I'm quite frankly baffled why nearly everyone insists on calling the buy out a good move.  I also find it funny that people downvoted my remark, would be curious to hear some of the reasoning behind those who downvoted it."
Habs,3csrye,Batmarde,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:50:47 2015 UTC,No team wanted parenteau at that salary. MB probably shipped him around to the entire league before buying him out.

Habs,3csrye,TheJustin72,1 point,Sat Jul 11 01:48:31 2015 UTC,"Right, and he compounded on that move by trading him for Parenteau.  And then he compounded on that move, by buying out Parenteau.  A terrible UFA signing.  A terrible trade.  And a terrible buy out.  Just asset mismanagement 101."

Let's be honest here, who doesn't make mistakes? I'm not saying the PAP case was a mistake, not saying it was a good thing either, but however you see it, why do you have to whine about it? It's such a drop in the bucket. You are just coming off as bitter/jealous of all the praise MB is getting.  Nobody hits home runs all the time, sometimes you strike out.

DD has many flaws, but when stuck along the boards with the puck in his feet and a D trying to pin him, he'll win his battle about 50% of the time. If he can't come out with the puck, he'll at least dish it somewhere where the play can go on.  Chucky is great in open ice, but rarely wins any battle along the boards. He still hasn't learn how to shield the puck in tight quarters. He tried to dangle and ends up being too easily separated from the puck. He needs to take cue from Eller, who's perhaps the best Habs' forward at protecting the puck along the boards."

He's good at one thing and that's passing to Pacioretty.  Him being on this team is stunting the development of a player that is much better suited to play that role.  People complain that Galch is bad defensively, which is funny because DD has the least amount of shifts in the dzone than anyone else on the team (if I remember correctly).  Galchenyuk will get 10 games once again at center and be moved back at wing, if he's producing (once again) or not, MT plays favorites and that has pissed off over half the team."

That's ok, our idea behind it is that it is a for the fans by the fans tournament. We don't care about skill level, as long as we fill out a roster that can meet the requirements of skill level you can play. We don't want to cut people out, but we also don't want insanely stacked teams.  So our idea is to limit the amount of players on each team depending on the levels they play. So for example only 2-3 new/not very good players. Only 1-2 semi-pro/college/junior players. Only a certain amount of AAA and AA players. Then fillout the rest of the roster with house/A players."

Habs,3coj3l,jo_maka,11,Thu Jul 9 16:23:43 2015 UTC,Agreed. Do people really think MB doesn't realize we need more offensive firepower? It's not like he can unilaterally acquire a top 6 forward.
Habs,3coj3l,lehabs,3,Thu Jul 9 18:03:22 2015 UTC,"This is an excerpt of Friedman's 30 thoughts:   13 - Marc Bergevin is one of the more active GMs, in terms of working the phones. It’s difficult to know sometimes from the outside if he’s trying to do something, or simply collecting information. The Canadiens were in on a few things. They took a run at Matt Beleskey, but weren’t willing to go five years like Boston. There was dialogue with Shawn Matthias, but it’s tough to tell how far it got. And, knowing their needs, I’d be surprised if they didn’t at least inquire about Oshie. Again, though, I’m not sure it went anywhere. One agent did say Quebec’s taxes are a bigger factor than we consider, because they have to bid higher or give more term to overcome. Bergevin is very wary about that, because it will block his young players. One GM pointed out that Daniel Carr (who led AHL Hamilton in goals), and Sven Andrighetto (fourth in points) are waiver-eligible after next season. The Canadiens have to find out if they are NHLers."

Habs,3coj3l,GibierJaune,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:08:01 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure Ghetto stays and Carr is the first call-up. That waiver situation has to be decided before we even get to the trade deadline.

Habs,3cmcwp,Ptrainer87,20,Thu Jul 9 00:58:37 2015 UTC,"Everyone listen here. We were 9 goals away from how much Chicago had, look closely, 9 GOALS. Kassian will easily produce more then Prust, making us a middle of the pack offensive team. Now you may say ""Oh but it is only middle of the pack"", yeah, middle of the pack + CAREY PRICE, and not to mention Petry and some youngins possibly stepping up. Most of say ""If we don't get a 30+ goal scorer we will never be offensive. Not true, MB has tweaked little things here and there to make us that much more offensive. Mitchell, Kassian, Petry, youngins, and hopefully a half decent PP. All of that makes us so much more offensive."
Habs,3cmcwp,fatneszsebby,15,Thu Jul 9 05:50:56 2015 UTC,Honestly with like 5% more on the pp we finish first and we probably make it a 7 game series against tb  The powerplay was so bad it fucked us over
Habs,3cmcwp,Batmarde,2,Thu Jul 9 11:22:50 2015 UTC,"The lack of discipline in game 2 vs tampa fucked the habs. They could have made a series of it, and could have made the finals, had they just played a responsible game in game 2.   That's what was rough for me. Brutal. All that work, squandered because they couldn't hold it together and stay out of the box."
Habs,3cmcwp,Akoustyk,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:52:55 2015 UTC,CP played out of his mind also and stayed healthy. In the end I think goal scoring was the biggest issue.
Habs,3cmcwp,Akoustyk,3,Thu Jul 9 16:47:44 2015 UTC,"Goal scoring was, but hockey is a very momentum typed game. When they lost game 2 like that, so stupidly, that made a big difference. Then they went to tampa, and tampa coming home all fired up, that puts them in an essentially must win game. If they would have won that game, their game 2 blunder could have been erased.   But they gave tampa bay a key game. It put them down 2-0 going to tampa, that was brutal.   If they wouldn't have spent the whole game in the box, they would have scored more goals that game. If I recall, they did win 2 games in the series on a late comeback, if they would have won game 2 it could easily been a series to 7 games, and then anybody's game, and they are in teh cup final.   Sure, more scoring would be good, and sure, Carey Price will always play amazing and win games for them, but can't score goals.   But if you meltdown and sit in the box, just being undisciplined, you can't win a stanley cup. They need to be better. Not just get different players, but mentally play better. Just one game of meltdown was all it took.   It's a shame. They did alright, but I wouldn't be proud of it if I was them. If you lose but played honourably, I can be proud of you. But not if you lose like that. I don't think they achieved what they were capable of.   So, sure, add firepower, but if they play below their abilities like that, it won't make a difference."
Habs,3cmcwp,paul_33,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:30:53 2015 UTC,Well said. Not much to add there. I would very much prefer the scoring come from in our system. A couple prospects have caught attention so far.

Habs,3cmcwp,BrokenRetina,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:02:43 2015 UTC,"The problem isn't the talent, it's the approach. They couldn't figure it out in 82 games + playoffs, I have no faith they can next season either. They need new people running it.  I understand the logic behind keeping Therrien based on wins, even if I don't agree, but I do not understand keeping the assistant coaches who are terrible at their jobs."
Habs,3cmcwp,carbonated_turtle,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:23:27 2015 UTC,They haven't figured it out for close to 2 full seasons (including playoffs).
Habs,3cmcwp,habuheard,6,Fri Jul 10 14:18:33 2015 UTC,"Chicago may have won the Cup, but it wasn't because of the goals they scored in the regular season. They were 16th in scoring, so it's not even like they're anywhere near the highest scoring team in the league.   Chicago won because they're a good team, and they had a lot of chemistry. I think Therrien is a great coach, but how does he expect anyone to gain any chemistry if he's shuffling the lines every other game? He just wasn't able to find any lines that really clicked all year. And we absolutely do still need more goal scoring. 18th in the league isn't a high scoring team, and our place in the standings would've been a lot lower if we didn't have the best goalie in the league.   It's crazy to think we'll do any better next season unless Therrien figures out lines that work and a PP strategy that works, and until Bergevin gets us at least one more consistent scorer. We have a great team, but it's not a Cup winning team."
Habs,3cmcwp,BrokenRetina,1 point,Thu Jul 9 12:57:39 2015 UTC,"Agree with you we have to fix the PP but the point is that our offense only scored 6 less goals this year than the team that won the SC.  No one is saying Chicago won the SC because of the goals they scored in the regular season.  That's a straw man.  Fixing the PP, tweeks and player development will go a long way towards improving offensively."
Habs,3cmcwp,carbonated_turtle,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:55:26 2015 UTC,"A good coach will coach to his players strengths and reward them.  A bad coach constantly alternates players, plays favorites, and sets defined strict rolls for his players eventually alienating them."
Habs,3cmcwp,televisionceo,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:20:32 2015 UTC,"And that's the problem. After a full season with this roster, Therrien hasn't figured out whose strengths work best with other players.

Maybe Holloway steps up. If not we will have some trouble. Really liking the defense, Guys like Petry and Beaulieu are going to be huge bonuses this year. Goaltending is amazing, Price should have another strong year. However I think we fall in the standings.

I don't follow any other sports team, but the feeling in Montreal during hockey season, especially in the playoffs, is absolutely addictive! I'm not personally a big sports nut, but the love of this team in Montreal makes you want to be a part of it. Even people who move away from Montreal continue to spread their passion for this team."
Habs,3ckj1e,Alura0,6,Wed Jul 8 17:32:54 2015 UTC,"Yup, the last season was my first year living across the ocean. If there's one thing that carried on with me from Montreal, it's the passion and the fever I have for the Habs. I made everyone sure they knew it and taught them a lot about the sport and our club.  Edit: in addition, some locals also recognized my jersey (some were from really small towns too). I also saw a Bruins fan, he had a hat, in the metro yesterday. Told him ""Fuck the Bruins! Go Habs go!"""
Habs,3ckj1e,zeMVK,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:34:16 2015 UTC,"To be fair, the fact that this was only done in nine cities could make the results fairly misleading. Ottawa and the Alouettes being a bigger brand than the Oilers? If most of the surveyed cities were in Ontario and Quebec, maybe, but I don't think that's accurate at all. Jets higher than the Canucks? Actually, that makes sense for now, as they still have the comeback story going for them and really know how to push merchandise, but that will likely fade in a few years."

Habs,3clp8e,MessageBoard,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:40:52 2015 UTC,I had trouble finding much on him. Apparently he was ranked 111th in the draft but no one took him. Presumably he got an invite to attend the Habs' development camp.

I think in part because we haven't signed anyone out of our development camp the last few years. If we give a standout a contract it could help us secure the ""high end"" guys in future years knowing we reward taking camp seriously.   We're not even close to the contract limit so no real risk. Especially when you consider how bad of players have gotten contracts from us in the last decade like Philippe Lefebvre, Robert Mayer and Alain Berger. AHL contract is fine too."

Habs,3ckhks,hkycoach,8,Wed Jul 8 16:50:01 2015 UTC,I remember when Tangradi iced the puck (as a failed dump-in) during an intense shift when he was only like 3 feet from the red line with no defenders near him. It led to several more minutes in their own zone with a tired line and eventually a goal.  Pretty sure Therrien benched him right then and there and his fate was sealed. Good luck in Detroit.
Habs,3ckhks,Royal_Flush13,6,Wed Jul 8 17:04:39 2015 UTC,"It was against the Wild or Ducks. It's all I remember from him. He played like a dumbass. He iced it twice and was on the ice for a goal against. Therrien called a timeout and looked right at Tangradi and said ""Smarten the fuck up"". I don't think he played another shift. Glad he's gone."
Habs,3ckhks,quadriplegic_cheetah,3,Wed Jul 8 17:06:17 2015 UTC,Yup against the ducks! I was there and remember this happening directly in front of me.. It was brutal to watch that shift!

Habs,3cikmu,hkycoach,5,Wed Jul 8 04:44:17 2015 UTC,"I suppose we are better off than before the draft but still not by much, we cant score and nothing thus far has been done to change that.   We cant expect Price to have a historical season every year."
Habs,3cikmu,ancienthunter,9,Wed Jul 8 12:48:33 2015 UTC,"nothing thus far has been done to change that   Kassian is an upgrade on Prust for that. Holloway is essentially a sniper who was in the Kings system, got caught in the logjam, went to Europe and exploded offensively with Skelleftea.   Those moves are not big splashes, but they're very smart moves to  the right direction. Plus our young guns who got more seasoning and are primed to get a spot on the roster are aaaaaall offensive threats (not defensive a la DLR or Tinordi).  We are doing something to address that, my friend. Just not in bombastic fashion. After all we only scored 9 less goals than the Stanley Cup champions, even if all the hockey world, especially on the internet, tends to forget it. Large entities feeding itself off hyperboles and exaggeration would do that."
Habs,3cikmu,jo_maka,5,Wed Jul 8 13:32:03 2015 UTC,"you're probably right, I just feel like this team has been offensively challenged for a long time (dating back to the Martin era). I know im being overly critical but I just want an elite top line."
Habs,3cikmu,ancienthunter,3,Wed Jul 8 13:34:11 2015 UTC,"I feel we're getting close. We're not there yet, but we're definitely inching closer. It's just that in the cap era, it's a pretty huge gamble to drop the patient work to get a big piece, unless you're on your last legs in terms of window opportunity (read: Pittsburgh), or the GM is desperate for his job (especially vis-à-vis cap situation). Prior to 2005, it was conceivable to just go out there and pick a big piece that will get us over the hump very easily, and I think a lot of the fans still remember those days. Which makes the wait so much harder."
Habs,3cikmu,jo_maka,2,Wed Jul 8 13:56:13 2015 UTC,"I don't know if it's a trick of the eye, but whenever I see video of Holloway playing in Europe it seems the game is a lot slower there, or at least there is a lot more space for the D to cover, so the forwards have the luxury of deking rather than having to immediately shoot/pass. I hope he pans out because we could use a sniper, but until I see him playing on the smaller ice surface against NHL-caliber d-men I will remain skeptical."
Habs,3cikmu,HammerOfTheSlobs,3,Wed Jul 8 14:55:26 2015 UTC,"Which makes sense, definitely. Me I'm not really expecting him to deke around that way, the ice is way smaller and I'd say the NHL Dmen are more adept at closing the gap than in the SHL. But what we can't take out is the quality of his shot. Wrister, slapper, you name it, the guy got it. Hard and accurate. So if we give him a patient enough playmaker, I think he's at least an upgrade on PAP as a right-hand option just by being a better skater. If his floor level is above PAP, I think we can be optimistic about his eventual ceiling :)"
Habs,3cikmu,jo_maka,2,Wed Jul 8 15:12:16 2015 UTC,"""Those moves are not big splashes, but they're very smart moves to the right direction.""   I agree 100% with this. MB has def made a name for himself when it comes to small/smart moves. Diaz for Weise was my favorite. I don't think he is done yet, things may move once Chucky signs."
Habs,3cikmu,Ptrainer87,2,Wed Jul 8 23:26:52 2015 UTC,No doubt. Kassian will be better than Prust.
Habs,3cikmu,televisionceo,2,Wed Jul 8 11:45:39 2015 UTC,Yes. All of our prospects seem to have good news about them and we also got a ridiculously good trade for Kassian and a 5th. Kassian has the ability to score 20 so I would say we have improved quite a lot.

I don't even think he has a contract at the moment. If he does ever end up saying pro, he will definitely be starting out in Europe/ ECHL most likely."
Habs,3cfzw8,quadriplegic_cheetah,2,Tue Jul 7 16:56:04 2015 UTC,"I don't see him playing either, he doesn't have good stats from his past seasons and we already have a lot of depth at his position in the AHL, unless there is a lot of injuries."
Habs,3cfjib,jshare,6,Tue Jul 7 14:55:14 2015 UTC,Seems pretty reasonable to be honest. I've only been to the Bell centre twice but around game time (before and especially after) that road is pretty much already a pedestrian walkway
Habs,3cfjib,Corazu,7,Tue Jul 7 15:33:29 2015 UTC,"As someone who never drive downtown, it would be a nice thing. Constant parties in front of the Bell Center. Coderre might approve the idea"
Habs,3cfjib,Gabroux,4,Tue Jul 7 15:33:13 2015 UTC,"I hope they do not put a permanent TV at the end of Drummond street. It would be cool to watch a game from that space, but it would look like shit within 5 years most likely. I wonder if they are ending their contract with the cage au sports as that seems to be where the new entrance would be, and getting into games was an absolute mess this year."
Habs,3cfjib,hockeyrugby,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:07:39 2015 UTC,Agreed. Great at game time - home or away - but a potential eyesore the rest of the time

Habs,3cf607,jo_maka,2,Tue Jul 7 12:58:43 2015 UTC,I'm really curious on what type of player he'll end up being.
Habs,3cf607,Mustafarr,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:49:22 2015 UTC,"So am I. An irrational sleeper pick of mine. Not on hockey strength but he seems like a genuinely great guy. He almost made the WJC 2 years ago, and he won a scholarship two years in a row to the point where he just gave up the second one to the runner-up. That's really impressive."
Habs,3ceu6c,jshare,2,Tue Jul 7 10:41:38 2015 UTC,"Great album. Really does highlight the season. One thing, I'm curious as to why they chose pictures of Carey getting scored on to put in the ""Best of"" album."
Habs,3ceu6c,hammyp,2,Tue Jul 7 11:34:43 2015 UTC,For the absolute best goaltender I've ever seen after Patrick Roy. So proud of him!
Habs,3ccpj3,hkycoach,6,Mon Jul 6 21:58:58 2015 UTC,"I feel conflicted. Beliveau was a Habs legend. On one side, I feel like we could annoy potential Nordiques fans with them living in our shadow. On the other, it feels like the next Quebec team is taking our legend for theirs. I wouldn't feel right having Peter Stastny or some other Nordiques nammed place in Montreal.   In the end, if Beliveau's family feels it's honoring his name, then that's fine. But it just feels weird that they would put his name in front of a place with fans that will/already hate us."
Habs,3ccpj3,zeMVK,2,Tue Jul 7 05:40:39 2015 UTC,"Beliveau is just as much of a Legend to Quebec city (From his Junior Days) then he is a legend to us. He did alot of big things for that city, they have all the credential needed to name a space in his honor in front of their arena from his Hockey accomplishment and dedication to the city already, now couple that with the fact he was a wonderful man who deserve all the recognition he gets, this does not feel weird in the slightest."
Habs,3ccpj3,PerfectisSh1t,1 point,Tue Jul 7 11:20:30 2015 UTC,I think it's the Quebecor factor that makes people feel weird about it. Like using Beliveau as a PR stunt. That said I agree with you it's not really weird
Habs,3ccpj3,Batmarde,1 point,Tue Jul 7 12:27:53 2015 UTC,"Videotron will say no because of the investment they will make to bring a concession to Quebec City. EDIT: I misread, I thought they wanted to rename the building, sorry guys."
Habs,3cgcxz,hkycoach,7,Tue Jul 7 18:21:48 2015 UTC,"I don't see how the Tarasenko deal is a comparable for Galchenyuk, their stats are wildly different."
Habs,3cgcxz,shiram,2,Tue Jul 7 18:27:56 2015 UTC,Just simply from the point of their NHL experience...  And their numbers were similar going into the 14/15 season.  And it's the off season...
Habs,3cgcxz,shiram,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:37:42 2015 UTC,"The way I see it, Chucky either signs a bridge, 2 years around 2.5 to 3 millions. Or goes for long term, and that mean 5 to 8 years, from 4 to 6 millions. Term might be off, I'd need to check UFA years."
Habs,3cgcxz,shiram,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:46:10 2015 UTC,"I think you're right on the bridge.  It doesn't make sense for him to lock in 8y/5m for his first big contract when he has the opportunity to show that he's worth more.  However, maybet hat's what MB is trying to do?  Lock him down cheaper long term?"
Habs,3cgcxz,mattyv11,2,Tue Jul 7 18:56:08 2015 UTC,"I've heard, consider it a rumor, that Alex Galchenyuk is the bread maker for his family (sister and both parents). If that is the case, it could be that he is looking for more money now.  That said with Bergevin at the helm, we probably won't get anything of substance untill the deal is signed and annouced."
Habs,3cgcxz,fromage1,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:59:24 2015 UTC,His dad played pro hockey for 20 years and coached in the O. I'd assume they've done okay money wise. Chucky does live with his mom and sister in Montreal though IIRC.
Habs,3cgcxz,shiram,2,Tue Jul 7 19:35:16 2015 UTC,"Assistant coach in the O doesn't make that much money, and playing professional hockey in Russia/minor leagues isn't a very lucrative employment, especially in the 90s. That's probably why the entire family packed up and moved to Montreal.   They're basically living with off Chuckys money. This has Jack Johnson written all over it."
Habs,3cgcxz,fromage1,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:50:15 2015 UTC,Yup that is what I'm afraid of.
Habs,3cgcxz,jo_maka,-4,Tue Jul 7 19:54:31 2015 UTC,"His sister is just being a primadonna/minor celebrity, despite not having a single talent or job but being good looking."
Habs,3cgcxz,shiram,8,Tue Jul 7 19:56:01 2015 UTC,"She's actually a former world class figure skater who served as vice president of a junior hockey team in Boston a while back (2011 IIRC).   But yeah, she doesn't look like a shaved chimp's ass walking backwards so of course, she has no talent...........  SMDH"
Habs,3cgcxz,mattyv11,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:19:10 2015 UTC,"She's a model from what I know, so that's to be expected. Still she should be able to provide for herself."
Habs,3cgcxz,Tomy2TugsFapMaster69,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:59:14 2015 UTC,Yes but it is still above average income... I really don't think this has anything to do with the hold up in negotiations. I could be wrong of course but I think it's more about Alex simply wanting to get his first great payday.
Habs,3cgcxz,shiram,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:58:22 2015 UTC,"Wasn't his original salary $3.25 million/year?  I seriously doubt he would sign a bridge deal for less money than his original contract considering he has actually been somewhat productive.  If its a bridge contract it wouldn't really make sense for it to be under $4 million, maybe $4.5."
Habs,3cgcxz,Tomy2TugsFapMaster69,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:13:33 2015 UTC,"That figure includes all possible bonuses he could attain, and most likely did not, as those are usually set way high.  Considering the market for players similar to him, I feel like somewhere around 2.5 to 3 on a bridge is fair."
Habs,3cgcxz,TheHydroImpulse,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:15:29 2015 UTC,"His cap hit was $3.25 so I can only assume that means he earned that money.  Also to compare, Subban was making under $1 million before he signed his bridge which was just north of $2.5 million.  A high draft pick like Alex is not going to settle for less than $4 at this point, I would be pretty surprised.  Just my two cents anyways."
Habs,3cgcxz,quadriplegic_cheetah,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:18:51 2015 UTC,"According to General Fanager, his cap hit was $925,000 and his AAV was $3,225,000. He had bonuses worth $2.3M."
Habs,3cgcxz,BuddhasLittleWarlock,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:45:58 2015 UTC,"The issue is Galchenyuk has a lot of potential and could very well be a 70 point scorer like Tarasenko as soon as next year even. I agree with you though. You don't focus on the future, you focus on what he has done."
Habs,3cgcxz,Powdreams,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:19:18 2015 UTC,"A bridge contract makes the most sense for Galchenyuk. Because he hasn't nearly broken out the way that Tarasenko has. Obviously, being fourth or fifth on the team in points is no small feat, but it's not inconceivable that his production could be replaced this year by someone else."
Habs,3ccg7h,hkycoach,2,Mon Jul 6 20:49:54 2015 UTC,Definitely a good comparison. Especially when he's 6' and 195lbs. Let's hope he continues to impress.
Habs,3cdkn5,Lyver,14,Tue Jul 7 02:06:31 2015 UTC,My money would be on Andrighetto.
Habs,3cdkn5,slayeryouth,6,Tue Jul 7 02:12:10 2015 UTC,"Andrighetto or Hudon, potentially both could be in our lineup by game 82."
Habs,3cdkn5,quadriplegic_cheetah,7,Tue Jul 7 02:14:56 2015 UTC,"I saw a picture of Andrighetto today from the camp, and holy fook, they guy is short but he looks like a TANK. Definitely has packed on  some muscle."
Habs,3cdkn5,hank0,3,Tue Jul 7 08:15:27 2015 UTC,"This guy is the total package, if he wasn't on the shorter side. If he packed muscles on top of that then Gally just got a new friend."

Habs,3cdkn5,televisionceo,3,Tue Jul 7 14:30:39 2015 UTC,My bet is on McCarron
Habs,3cdkn5,hkycoach,1 point,Tue Jul 7 11:00:06 2015 UTC,"Andrighetto has a significant lead going into the off season after getting ice with the club last year.  However, I'd expect Scherbak to make the decision difficult.  He has the size that Ghetto lacks.  Edit:  Also Ghetto is an RFA after the season, not sure if that will weigh in.  They may want to get him more time on the roster to see if he's really ready for the jump, or if he'll need more time.  Also at 22, he's entering his prime."
Habs,3cdkn5,axepig,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:24:11 2015 UTC,"I think Holloway actually have a good chance of making the team, he's a super good shooter and has good hands. His skating is meh apparently but it's alright for a 3rd line+PP"
Habs,3cdkn5,Funkenbrain,-4,Tue Jul 7 19:06:25 2015 UTC,"Hudon seems most likely to me, maybe Andrighetto. Scherbak and McCarron deserve a look too. They're also the 4 most likely to be traded of course, so this may change pretty fast."
Habs,3cdkn5,jo_maka,5,Tue Jul 7 03:28:30 2015 UTC,That last sentence is very unlikely
Habs,3cdkn5,hockeyrugby,1 point,Tue Jul 7 04:19:24 2015 UTC,if you want to get a top 6 forward and trade a defencemen then yes one of these guys (most likely ghetto or hudon) would be involved
Habs,3cdkn5,jo_maka,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:52:58 2015 UTC,"Or, we could also turn one of those into a top 6 forward while they still have little to no impact on the cap because we have franchise players to lock down."
Habs,3cdkn5,hockeyrugby,-2,Tue Jul 7 16:10:13 2015 UTC,"hudon and adrighetto are not going to be top 6 forwards long term IMO. If they ever have 2 seasons scoring more then 20 goals, and 20 assists I will buy you schwartz"
Habs,3cdkn5,PhenStiller,0,Tue Jul 7 16:21:08 2015 UTC,"not necessarily, if MB is planning on making any big moves before the season starts, we should expect maybe one of our good prospects will be traded."
Habs,3cdkn5,SiegeWar,9,Tue Jul 7 05:27:29 2015 UTC,MB   Big Moves   prospects will be traded     Not sure how long you've been following the Habs
Habs,3cdkn5,televisionceo,4,Tue Jul 7 06:09:34 2015 UTC,exactly. MB is always very careful about what he does and he is commited to use his prospects to build a cup winning team.
Habs,3cdkn5,PhenStiller,1 point,Tue Jul 7 13:08:23 2015 UTC,"Which is the smart way of building a team! cough Detroit cough Tampa, but as of next season, we obviously need more goal scoring, which may lead to one of our better prospects to be traded for an immediate contributor."
Habs,3cdkn5,paul_33,2,Tue Jul 7 21:01:17 2015 UTC,People keep waiting on some big blockbuster move where the habs magically trade Plekanec for a 50 goal scoring elite centre. It's not going to happen.
Habs,3cdkn5,PhenStiller,1 point,Tue Jul 7 13:23:54 2015 UTC,"I didn't say MB is known for his blockbusters, it's actually the opposite. I'm saying if we actually want to win a cup while our star players are in their prime, we need that extra player to push us over the edge. If you think we can win with our current lineup then i'm not sure how long you've followed the NHL for :p"
Habs,3cdkn5,SiegeWar,0,Tue Jul 7 20:40:58 2015 UTC,It is safer to let one of our prospects grow into a top player than to trade for one
Habs,3cdkn5,PhenStiller,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:42:35 2015 UTC,"Absolutely agree, but we need firepower next season, and unless one of our top prospects steps up into a 25 goal scorer position, we need another finisher. Without a doubt before the start of the season, MB will make another move, he's just reluctant to trade away our future potential, which is understandable."

Habs,3cbjw2,djohnston02,5,Tue Jul 7 00:17:27 2015 UTC,You can see the need for a top 6 winger more than a top line centre. Rolling 2-3 scoring wingers and a bunch of grinders isn't going far.
Habs,3cbjw2,montrealcowboyx,2,Mon Jul 6 17:40:23 2015 UTC,"That need was also evident 3 years ago. Gionta was never a force on the ice, despite his good locker room presence."
Habs,3cbjw2,CarelessPotato,2,Mon Jul 6 19:40:58 2015 UTC,"Gionta was quite effective actually if you consider his role as a PK and shutdown winger, and that he had bicep surgery. Still managed to have a 20G pace while doing all this as a 5'7 guy. He was a great athlete and leader"
Habs,3cbjw2,djohnston02,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:50:53 2015 UTC,"True, but he was way overpaid for that role. One of the guys who was paid for what he had already done, not what he will do."

Habs,3cbjw2,montrealcowboyx,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:40:42 2015 UTC,"He had 2 20 goal seasons out of his 5 in Montreal. Then one was shortened by the lockout, the other was injury.   I don't dislike him, but I don't think he was an elite winger, is all."

Habs,3cbjw2,Kuciv,12,Mon Jul 6 17:10:31 2015 UTC,"Mitchell is better than Halpert, so I guess centre is better.

Habs,3cb5sq,suicypher,5,Mon Jul 6 23:12:08 2015 UTC,"Well, maybe now someone will be in Bergevin's ear about how shitty Dump-and-chase is."
Habs,3cb5sq,hkycoach,7,Mon Jul 6 15:53:12 2015 UTC,Yes the system is the dump and chase. Every game therrien takes out his board and jsut tells the players to dump it and chase it.
Habs,3cb5sq,Batmarde,12,Mon Jul 6 16:08:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah totally, I heard the development camp this week they are just going to be dumping and chasing all week long, you know, to get them ready for when they join the big club."
Habs,3cb5sq,televisionceo,27,Mon Jul 6 16:17:31 2015 UTC,I heard McCarron acted like an ass to his girlfriend just so she would dump him so he could chase her again.  It was not required but it's good practice
Habs,3cb5sq,televisionceo,8,Mon Jul 6 16:23:53 2015 UTC,Part of MTs personal betterment program.
Habs,3cb5sq,Royal_Flush13,7,Mon Jul 6 16:25:36 2015 UTC,We won the gold medal last winter with this stupid strategy
Habs,3cb5sq,televisionceo,10,Mon Jul 6 15:55:46 2015 UTC,With far superior players and more ice to maneuver around.  The international game is different. Very different.
Habs,3cb5sq,Royal_Flush13,4,Mon Jul 6 15:58:39 2015 UTC,"Of course.  When you have big and superior players who can always get out with the puck,  it's pretty good."
Habs,3cb5sq,televisionceo,3,Mon Jul 6 16:12:11 2015 UTC,So you're saying we should acquire Getzlaf? I'm in!
Habs,3cb5sq,r_slash,4,Mon Jul 6 16:29:41 2015 UTC,Or just McCarron.  This guy is a total beast on the boards.
Habs,3cb5sq,boomboomsubban,3,Mon Jul 6 16:40:00 2015 UTC,And it was a team with limited practice time. It's probably a lot simpler to implement a D&C strategy than a zone entry strategy.

Habs,3cb5sq,Kuciv,0,Mon Jul 6 18:49:01 2015 UTC,Elite goalie and bad coach = New Jersey last year  Elite goalie and good coach = Montreal last year
Habs,3cb5sq,paul_33,-1,Mon Jul 6 18:52:31 2015 UTC,Swap Price and a 'good' goalie like say Halak or Crawford. Are you seriously suggesting given how badly they were outshot and outplayed night in and night out they would still be in the playoffs?
Habs,3cb5sq,Kuciv,2,Mon Jul 6 18:54:05 2015 UTC,Yes. Probably not first but playoffs 100%. Because it happened in 2013 where Price's numbers were nothing stellar and we made the playoffs or how about when we lost Price in the playoffs and we were still competitive with Tokarski?

Habs,3cbvpk,televisionceo,0,Mon Jul 6 22:28:01 2015 UTC,"""According to NHLe, that would've translated to a 66 pts season in the NHL."" Dunno what's NHLe but that's total bullshit. Not even close.  The Czech league is really weak nowadays. It's about the same caliber as the ECHL. And it's a larger ice, which help Reway a lot.  Reway had the season we tought he'd have. He's a really skilled player, but the step for him to succeed in the NHL will be huge.  I don't think he will make it, as in addition to the lack of size, he's not the greatest skater, and he tends to float too much on the ice. If he makes it to the NHL, it would be as a PP specialist. Still, he's an intriguing prospect."
Habs,3cbvpk,quadriplegic_cheetah,4,Mon Jul 6 20:14:51 2015 UTC,NHLe uses the stats of all the players that have made the transition from the Czech League to the NHL (53 players). They had 0.74 as much pts in the NHL than in the Czech League so that's where that number comes from. You can read more about it here.

If they act offended, ask about Lucic (pronounced Loo-cheech).  7) At this point you should probably start bobbing and weaving, counter punching is encouraged.

That's the main thing I couldn't stand watching the NBA Finals this year was that the second the Cavs did bad for more then 30 seconds the fans gave up and basically went home.
Habs,3c9pfz,hkycoach,2,Mon Jul 6 16:53:41 2015 UTC,"It really depends on the team, but every team has at least some loyal fan base.  Most Habs fans are pretty rapid, even teams like Winnipeg have very loyal followings.  You end up with a lot more fair-weather fans with teams like Florida and Carolina, who saw early success, but then faltered.  If I were to rank the top fan bases by ""most loyal"":  1) Montreal  2) New York (Rangers)  3) Philidelphia  4) Detroit  5) Edmonton"

I couldn't say for Edmonton but I feel like it's similar"
Habs,3c9pfz,axepig,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:07:16 2015 UTC,Montreal has a LOT of fans so if you look online and at the Bell Center you will see more hardcore fans but if you come to Montreal sometime and talk about the Habs in a bar or in a public place there will be a lot of fair weather fans. I know a lot of people didn't watch the 2011 season (where we finished almost last in the league) but they are all watching it since then because we're a playoff team.   Also if we're getting destroyed in a game you will see a bunch of people leave the arena but that's because the tickets are expensive as hell so there's a lot of companies that get tickets and those people sometime just go to the game for funsies and are not real hardcore fans.
Habs,3c9pfz,axepig,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:06:02 2015 UTC,I'd love to go to Montreal and see a game. I need to brush up my french though first. I plan to either move there or France.

AHL, OHL... you name it, it seemed to be there.   At the end of the season, I put my account on hold until October 1st, so I don't eat up my subscription.  I think it's in HD720. Iirc. There's no doubt that cable has better quality but I say F-U Rogers and your Habs blackout for anyone living east of Belleville.  I learned about hockeystreams.com from other Habs fans here, on this site. Want to say thanks again!"
Habs,3c9pfz,RagnarokAM,2,Mon Jul 6 13:57:42 2015 UTC,+1 for Hockeystreams.  Much better service than Gamecentre in my opinion.
Habs,3c9pfz,TheDaliComma,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:13:02 2015 UTC,"Best way to learn the game is just to watch and if you come across something you don't understand just ask in this sub or /r/hockey (I'd ask here first. There's a lot of irrational Habs hate in /r/hockey).  Another thing to note if you're new to the sport is that international hockey kicks absolute ass. If Canada plays Russia at the world juniors just know that no lead is safe.  Here is the world junior gold medal game in it's entirety. This will get you started (NHL games are hard to find that's why I linked that), hope you enjoy it and the season for Montreal starts back up in October (preseason in september)."
Habs,3c9pfz,snipeftw,1 point,Mon Jul 6 05:46:10 2015 UTC,"I watched the game. While it hard to get into something where you have no drive for either team to win(Likely I'd support the French and USA teams like I do international football), it was pretty thrilling none the less.   A few questions if you don't mind me asking. What caused the Empty Goal in the last few mins of the game? I don't think you'll know this but where all those hard jump cuts commercials? One of the things I really like about football is the fact that it's contentiously 45 minutes + stoppage of sports but if the jump cuts are the only commercials played it sure beat out football and baseball for sure."
Habs,3c9pfz,snipeftw,2,Mon Jul 6 07:46:00 2015 UTC,"The net was empty at the end of the game because if a team is down a goal or two they can pull their goalie out for another skater. Its basically a desperation move to try fo a quick goal.   And here the commercials were edited out. Im a fan of Football (American and a bit of European), Baseball and hockey and European football definitely has the least commercials but as American sport go I'd say hockey has less than Baseball and american football.   Edit: Also it's a great time to start cheering for USA in hockey. Jack Eichel just got drafted second overall by Buffalo and Auston Matthews is the projected first pick next year. Team USA will be very tough to beat in the 2018 olympics. France isn't so good (not trying to be insulting, its just not a big sport there)."
Habs,3c9pfz,snipeftw,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:57:03 2015 UTC,Yea I know hockey isn't big in France but sometimes you have to have your team and a fall back. After France got knocked out of wwc last week I got to cheer USA to kick Germany's ass lol.
Habs,3c9pfz,snipeftw,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:09:52 2015 UTC,"Some of the hard cuts weren't commercials. I'd blame the uploader. Might have been done to keep the video under an hour in length. Commercials are often quick during Hockey games as the game is always flowing unlike Football or Baseball.  The empty net at the end of the game was a tactical decision by the Russian team. The team can choose to remove their Goalie from the ice in exchange for putting an extra skater on the ice for the team (Might be hard to count, so you'll see that Russia has 6 guys attacking Canada's net by the end of it. They were focused on trying to tie the game, which would force the game into a Sudden Death extra period of gametime where the first goal would solidify a win for whichever team scores.  If you're looking for random hockey games from last year, I have been following this Youtube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwe1f0Lza9RCmXZP2VrdK8Q. While most of the recent videos are interviews, back a ways in the upload history are full length games. Youtube actually has quite a few games uploaded from the past year so you'll be able to jump in and watch a few.  Best of luck!"

Scherby is 20 years old by December 30th IIRC, so he's eligible to make the AHL. Which pretty much means, he's not going to the CHL anymore."

His defence is so bad that's all he would be able to work on under therrien, or really any NHL coach.   Let him go to the AHL where he can spend 1/4 of his time learning professional defence, positioning and self preservation, and 3/4 of his time learning to put the puck in the net at the next level. I remember Patches asking to be sent down for that exact reason."
Habs,3c7g1q,quadriplegic_cheetah,-5,Sun Jul 5 22:51:30 2015 UTC,His defense is bad are you a complete moron? He was 19th in plus minus in the entire league playing with linemates who were terrible. He played about as complete of a games as you possibly could  Patches asked to be sent down because he was playing on the 4th line and wanted icetime not because of defensive issues

Habs,3c8wpp,PhenStiller,8,Mon Jul 6 00:17:02 2015 UTC,I'd take my chance on Semin first
Habs,3c8wpp,SiegeWar,0,Mon Jul 6 00:24:05 2015 UTC,"Semin? The guy who hasn't scored 30 goals since 09, and who is wildly out of his prime? I'd rather score Sharp who has shown consistency over the seasons."
Habs,3c8wpp,axepig,7,Mon Jul 6 00:31:26 2015 UTC,"Semin is younger and I believe was more talented than Sharp. Sharp is more of a two-way player, Semin is a pure sniper and if we can get him on a 1 year 2~M max I'd be thrilled because it's not a big risk and it can be a HUGE reward"
Habs,3c8wpp,axepig,-1,Mon Jul 6 00:42:17 2015 UTC,"Although I believe Semin also has some potential, Sharp for 5.5 Mill next year, then 5 mill the year after works with the Habs salary cap, and we gain an elite winger, which we are in desperate need of. If we could sign Semin 1y/1mill, then I think it would be a good signing."
Habs,3c8wpp,axepig,3,Mon Jul 6 00:47:24 2015 UTC,"Is he an elite though? I'm pretty sure he was on the 3rd line in Chicago and he wasn't really getting it done, here he would probably be a 1st liner but I don't think it would be a lock-in. Gallagher plays VERY well on the 1st line so paying for an older supposedly very good winger at 5M? Reminds me of someone... Was it Vanek? Nonono that was Briere... Or was it PAP? Hmmm so many names"
Habs,3c8wpp,axepig,-1,Mon Jul 6 00:49:55 2015 UTC,"That's exactly the point. He proved he was elite by producing with 3rd line players like Vermette and Terrivenin. During the playoffs he had 15p in 23g while playing on the third line. Gallagher doesn't need to be first line, he can play with Galchenyuk on second."
Habs,3c8wpp,habsdane,2,Mon Jul 6 00:57:23 2015 UTC,"Taco is super skilled, and Vermette is probably a 2nd line center on most teams. He wasn't playing with scrubs and he got 16 goals 43 points... I really wouldn't call Sharp ""elite"" anymore. He's good, pretty good even, just not elite and I don't think a pretty good is good enough for an older guy at 5M"
Habs,3c8wpp,Isomniac,-1,Mon Jul 6 01:01:36 2015 UTC,"I agree that Teuvo will be a star someday, but Sharp was really the backbone of that line. I think his pay of 5 mill is a little too high, but with only 2 years left on his contract, he wouldn't bust while still on our team. He still has a few productive years left in him for sure."
Habs,3c8wpp,BuddhasLittleWarlock,1 point,Mon Jul 6 01:08:42 2015 UTC,"I agree that 5M won't bust the team but he will get lots of icetime and will limit our ability to trade or sign someone else. I'm sorry but after having Vanek, Briere and PAP I absolutely cannot trust in a old scorer who is on the trade block and 5M is too much if we're getting another one of those guys. I'd much rather take a little risk with Semin or even play Holloway on our 2nd or 3rd line he looks like a great scorer"
Habs,3c8wpp,CarelessPotato,0,Mon Jul 6 01:10:53 2015 UTC,"PaP and Briere were probably the most underwhelming things to happen to the Habs in a while haha, but both were under different situations than Sharp. PaP has always been an underachiever, the prime of his career when he played with Tavares. Briere was bought out by the flyers, then the Canadiens had the brilliant idea to sign him for 4mill a year like wtf. If Chicago could keep Sharp I know they would, but their cap problems are forcing them to act a little desperately."
Habs,3c8wpp,BinaryChode,1 point,Mon Jul 6 01:17:29 2015 UTC,Not elite.

This isn't a Kovalev or a Kovalchuk where at least when they were on they were really something this is just a meh player that Im tired of hearing about. Let someone else sign him and just watch him hit waivers a month into the season.  I'd sooner take Semin and Im not exactly jumping at the idea of Semin.

Habs,3c3h08,Captain_Roy,2,Sat Jul 4 13:22:05 2015 UTC,Its always interesting to  go diggingand see why a player wasnt drafted. Miceli is the typical too small to make it reasoning but mcgauley kinda came out of nowhere almost  doubling his production. His draft year i think people would have thought he was just the benificiery of playing with good teammates in brandon but maybe theres more to him.  Size is decent as well on him
Habs,3c3h08,bsaures,1 point,Sat Jul 4 15:48:55 2015 UTC,I thought so too but he was the top scorer in Brandon and yet I only saw defensemen taken from the wheat kings in the draft.... Provorov and Pilon

Right, you can't, because you're just a little tiny cock trying with all your might to produce something akin to a thought.    Given that Price just reached out to aboriginal communities, my comment is 100% not racist. Cunt."

Habs,3c5y00,suicypher,10,Sun Jul 5 14:38:22 2015 UTC,"Let's judge the person by what he brings to the ice.  Whatever his personal issues are, they're his to deal with and nobody else.  If he sucks at hockey because of them, the organization will deal with it, not us, the fans.  Right now, I can't tell if he's playing well enough for the Montreal Canadiens to warrant a deep dive into his personal life.  Can you?"
Habs,3c5y00,jo_maka,3,Sun Jul 5 05:36:12 2015 UTC,"I actually thought it was public knowledge at this point. Kassian has a radulovesque approach to life, only more harmless, less mean and more ... bryzgalovian if you will.   But from what I understand, he had a good talk with MB before the trade went official, ever since he can't stop talking about maturity. And this being his contract year with him being a RFA with no leverage at the end of the season leads me to believe even his agent will be breathing down his neck for this season. So, I wouldn't concern myself."

Habs,3c0suj,AwkwardAwkwardness,27,Fri Jul 3 18:51:46 2015 UTC,"Best of luck to Prust, when he came to Montreal he was exactly what the team needed, an injection of vigor and energy, and he delivered each game.  The team moved on and improved, he was not as important anymore, he had flareups in the playoffs too, and that might have helped push him out the door.  I think Vancoucer is a good place for him, and I wish him the best of luck there."
Habs,3c0suj,shiram,21,Fri Jul 3 18:55:23 2015 UTC,ahh I'm gonna miss ya Prust :(  I still remember MTL vs the Ducks this season when Maroon hurt Patches really hard I was so pissed and a few seconds later Prust was there going after him. Great team player! Plus whenever he would score in a game they would win them :(
Habs,3c0suj,omlette1,21,Fri Jul 3 20:25:10 2015 UTC,I guess that's why I never understood the hate some of our fanbase threw at Prust at the end of this year. The guy bled for the Habs and he wanted to be there.
Habs,3c0suj,Gabroux,12,Fri Jul 3 21:21:24 2015 UTC,Prust was a warrior for us and I truly wish him the best. He left it all out on the ice.

I have to admit though that it seemed like he was turning a little more of a dirty player.  Even though I don't like Ben ""Dives as well as PK"" Bishop I didn't particularly like what Prust was doing to him either.  I really hope Kassian does put his money where his mouth is as I think he does have the potential to be a good player for the Habs."

Habs,3c5oth,nninja,-7,Sun Jul 5 02:03:29 2015 UTC,I'm just worried Therrien is ruining him. He seemed to regress this last year. He's not like PK who's so confident and ridiculously talented that he can flourish under any moronic coach.

Habs,3c5oth,GlorifiedHobo,4,Sun Jul 5 12:13:18 2015 UTC,We need help on the attack but I don't think a no.1 centre is as important as a top 6 winger.
Habs,3c5oth,nninja,2,Sun Jul 5 02:28:57 2015 UTC,As long as we believe Nyuk can be our #1 center than ya it makes more sense to go after a top 6 winger.But who wouldn't sign Kopitar next year if they got the chance?
Habs,3c5oth,Almostneverclever,1 point,Sun Jul 5 03:33:44 2015 UTC,"Not really, no. What we need right now is a RW who can put in 30 goals, has speed, character, is defensively responsible and preferably is big."

Habs,3c5oth,nninja,9,Sun Jul 5 03:30:12 2015 UTC,"Oh look, he was 25th in scoring for all centers! IIRC there are 30 teams in the NHL, meaning 30 #1 centers......."
Habs,3c5oth,Almostneverclever,-2,Sun Jul 5 03:37:02 2015 UTC,"Right. So by your logic Pleks is better than Bergeron, Duchene, Backes, E.Staal, because he has more points?  I'd take those 4 players before Pleks. Even the organisation knows Pleks is not a #1 center and that's why we got Nyuk.   And what the #30 center on the list is a #1 center but the #31 is a #2 center? One point makes that much of a difference eh."
Habs,3c5oth,Kartias,17,Sun Jul 5 04:08:44 2015 UTC,"A #1 center is either A: someone who plays center on the top line for an NHL team, or B: a bullshit term thrown around meaning someone who is arguably top 5 in the league.       I'm really tired of this attitude that there is a clear blueprint for building a franchise and anything different is just wrong. It's horseshit. Pittsburg has 2 #1 centers, nobody can deny that, but they were not contenders last year. Tampa had a clear #1 center and put him on the second line and slashed his ice time.... And went to the finals.          Yes Montreal could use a superstar center. No that's not the only way to get to the promised land."
Habs,3c5oth,axepig,1 point,Sun Jul 5 04:31:38 2015 UTC,"Agreed on the whole, except I believe Pittsburgh could have been a real contender if it weren't for the injuries to their top 4 Dmen. Any team with those injuries would lose their contender status for the season, but I really believe they were a really good team."
Habs,3c5oth,nninja,5,Sun Jul 5 16:34:45 2015 UTC,"Bergeron, Duchene and Staal had a bad year. Plekanec is better than Backes IMO and he is just slightly worse than Bergy. Pleks is a bit below-average #1 center or a great #2 center. He consistently get 60 pts per season even when playing with guys like Gionta, Armstrong and such.. He's really underrated"
Habs,3c5oth,axepig,1 point,Sun Jul 5 22:03:31 2015 UTC,"He's more than slightly worse than Bergy, Bergy is very clearly better, by a decent margin. For me Pleks is comparable to Kesler, and Kesler has always been considered a great #2."
Habs,3c5oth,nninja,3,Mon Jul 6 01:09:41 2015 UTC,"If you look at points, Pleks is very comparable to Bergy. They both have 60 pts per season or very close to it BUT Bergeron plays with better wingers like Marchand and I think he played with Pastrnak? Or was it Eriksson? This year Pleks got to play with Chucky and he was MUCH better offensively than the previous years.   As for advanced stats, I don't think they really indicate a player talent with no fault. Stats are good but they don't show everything. Also I usually think of Bergy, Pleks and Kesler as ""similar"" as in they are the best 2nd line centers of the league, good enough to be on the 1st line and do a decent job. I frankly believe having 2 2nd line centers a la Bruins (Bergy and Krecj) is better than having 1 big 1st line and a meh 2nd line center like Edmonton with Nudge on the 1st and Roy on the 2nd line(I think?)"
Habs,3c5oth,axepig,0,Mon Jul 6 01:18:21 2015 UTC,"Bergy is not considered a 2nd line center at all. Have you watched him play? He gets way tougher minutes than Pleks and is better than him in every way. Neither Kesler nor Pleks have even been nominated for a Selke and it's no surprise why. Bergy is the level in between Pleks/Kesler and Toews/Kopitar, not quite elite, but far from a 2nd line center. You think a 2nd line center would be making 8.75mil this year?? No it doesn't happen. And nobody is calling Bergy overpaid because anyone would take him and his contract."
Habs,3c5oth,nninja,2,Mon Jul 6 03:22:33 2015 UTC,"What I said was a personal opinion. I guess I have high standards but to be a #1 center (for me) you have to do more than 60 pts per season. Kopitar, Toews, Datsyuk, Eric Staal, Getzlaf, Thornton, etc. Those guys are the ""true"" #1 centers. For me, guys who put up 60 pts~ are great 2nd liners because they are not quite elite but they are hella good. I realize that Bergy is much better defensively, but that isn't the #1 center role to me. The 1st line is supposed to be a line of scorer who doesn't make too many mistakes, the 2nd line can be a shut-down line if it wants to but the 1st line is not the right place to be defensive in my book. Now I know you will probably disagree but that is a personal opinion, I know scoring is way down and 60 pts is now considered a 1st line amongst the league but even with that, I expect more from a #1 center of a playoff team. Also as I said earlier, I personally think having 2 2nd line centers a la Bruins (Bergy, Krecji) is a better way to do things compared to having a #1 and no #2."
Habs,3c5oth,zbingu2,1 point,Mon Jul 6 03:33:51 2015 UTC,"Bergy is one of the best two way centers, he gets buried in the d-zone way more than any other #1 center, that's why he doesn't score as much. He takes the most d-zone starts than ANY other top center and still puts up decent numbers. His advanced stats prove he is a legitimate 1st line player. You think Team Canada would bring on a 2nd line center with the talent pool they have? 8.75mil...let that sink in and really consider if the GM is crazy or if he is really that talented. Also if you watch him play you'll see he's one of the most dominant players on the ice, much more dominant than Pleks. He's  incredibly hard to play against. He's not a Selke winner for nothing.   This isn't just an opinion thing, Bergy is a #1 center, he has the awards, the cup, the medals, the salary, and the advanced stats to prove it. Not to mention praise by everyone in the NHL who recognizes him as a #1 center."
Habs,3c5oth,Muter91,1 point,Mon Jul 6 04:11:44 2015 UTC,"He was definitely better then the Staal, Duchene and Backes this year. Both offensively and defensively. People still define no 1C like we're in the 70's and there are 12 teams around."
Habs,3c5oth,quadriplegic_cheetah,1 point,Sun Jul 5 15:58:06 2015 UTC,"What logic is that? I'm simply stating facts. You, on the other hand, are giving your opinion.  I guess we could factor in zone starts, age, quality of team mates, and the like but I'm not willing to get into a debate about what makes a #1 center right now."
Habs,3c5oth,quadriplegic_cheetah,2,Sun Jul 5 04:24:10 2015 UTC,"Don't do that, because it will show Plekanec is a top 30 centre."
Habs,3c5oth,nninja,0,Sun Jul 5 04:31:16 2015 UTC,"Plekanec is better than Backes and Staal lol. That's not even debatable. And if you want proof, ask a St. Louis Blues fan or a Hurricanes fan."
Habs,3c5oth,bsaures,0,Sun Jul 5 04:31:41 2015 UTC,You serious? Erik Stall has a 100pt season and a captained his team to a SC. It is damn well debatable. Let's see who gets the bigger contract when they're up for UFA next year. I guarantee out of the three it won't be Pleks.
Habs,3c5oth,quadriplegic_cheetah,3,Sun Jul 5 06:13:13 2015 UTC,Eric never captained his team to a stanley cup and if we are picking players based on decade old stats can we get cheechoo he had alot of goals one season and cheechoo is fun to say
Habs,3c5oth,jo_maka,2,Sun Jul 5 12:50:57 2015 UTC,The key work here is had. And iic you base quality off of contracts you're nuts. At this moment in time Plekanec is better ham both Backes and Eric Staal.
Habs,3c5oth,nninja,7,Sun Jul 5 06:32:44 2015 UTC,He actually acquired one. In June 2012. He's coming along nicely I might add.
Habs,3c5oth,slayeryouth,-7,Sun Jul 5 02:34:21 2015 UTC,Nicely? He regressed this last year
Habs,3c5oth,chrislopez_,5,Sun Jul 5 03:28:53 2015 UTC,"Only if you define ""regression"" as ""being demonstrably better in nearly every measurable area.""  Which surprisingly enough, you wouldn't be the first person here to do that, so who knows!"

Habs,3c5oth,fatneszsebby,7,Sun Jul 5 06:38:30 2015 UTC,"When asked about whether he could try to find a true No. 1 centre:  “My reality, it might not be the same as the PlayStation that I play at night. I made a trade last night (on PlayStation), called the GM this morning and he hung up on me. So, to get that top centre, I’d love to get him, but I don’t see that happening. I think the last one was probably Joe Thornton (in 2005). Ryan Kessler had a limited trade clause, he got to choose where he went. … The reality is a lot of teams are looking for the same thing and often it’s just not available. We’ll look at the possibilities to improve our team at centre, if those players become available. But I don’t see any that are available.”"
Habs,3c5oth,nninja,4,Sun Jul 5 01:43:04 2015 UTC,"We don't really NEED one, it would be nice to have but why pay for one when we have Galchenyuk developing into one. Plus all of our centres are all decent, instead of having just one really good one."
Habs,3c5oth,fatneszsebby,-1,Sun Jul 5 01:54:51 2015 UTC,Because every cup winner of the last decade+ has had a real #1 center.
Habs,3c5oth,LeMAD,4,Sun Jul 5 03:32:02 2015 UTC,Which will be Galchenyuk. Develop vs instant.

Habs,3bzqph,prplx,3,Fri Jul 3 14:45:19 2015 UTC,"Indeed. I'm a Canucks fan who was disappointed by this trade. Kassian has a lot of upside. Heck, consider that last year he got 10 goals in 42 games. If he matures a bit, he's got all the tools to become a consistent 20 to 25 goal-scorer who strikes fear into the opposition.   On the other hand, three different NHL coaches have worked with him and haven't managed to make his consistency, so his opportunities are getting few and far between."
Habs,3bzqph,dbarefoot,2,Fri Jul 3 15:39:39 2015 UTC,exactly. I was not super excited by this trade but Kassian is making me like him more than I probably SHould right now
Habs,3bzqph,televisionceo,3,Fri Jul 3 16:11:23 2015 UTC,The fact that the both GM's are saying he wasn't playing consistently as he should  should light a fire under his ass.
Habs,3bzqph,gypsyblader,3,Fri Jul 3 16:19:26 2015 UTC,"At least he admits his faults. Some players, and some in our team right now, can't."
Habs,3bzqph,televisionceo,3,Fri Jul 3 16:30:11 2015 UTC,"Easy, this is a contract year... if he can't perform to his potential this year, who would sign him to anything but a short-term, low-money contract?  As much as I question Therrien's system, it does seem to incorporate fundamentals and reward responsible play. I think this environment will be good for Kassian if his attitude is as good as his comments indicate.  That said, I don't necessarily anticipate a break-out year for him, but I do think he will have ample opportunity to show consistency and show his worth on both ends of the ice."

I'm getting back into things due to growing interest and the fact that in a few months, I'll be teaching Athletes in Quebec better English skills to prepare them for call ups to their respective major leagues. I figured it was correct to look into their sports, and Hockey just kinda clicked.  That being said, I knew I needed to watch a team and while there were many business/work reasons why the Habs made sense, I also just really felt drawn to the members I read about. Didn't hurt that Price was a superstar this past year. So I read up on them and even watched the draft. Now I'm subscribed to this subreddit.  I want to thank everyone for just talking about the Habs here. I have learned a ton about hockey and the Habs through what I read here. Though there are a lot of critical posts about the Coaches and the team, I feel like I'm getting the hang of what the club is about and what is expected of them.

Habs,3bw9iz,jo_maka,3,Thu Jul 2 18:48:00 2015 UTC,"A lot of the Manitoba players seem to be tied with the Habs in a way or another. I might be wrong, but I think we were the favourite team in that province when the Jets were out. It could have something to do with the closeness and ensuing rejection of the Leafs too."
Habs,3bw9iz,Fabien_Lamour,5,Fri Jul 3 13:16:34 2015 UTC,Well fathers of guys in their 20s watched hockey in the 70s and the Habs were tearing it up back then.
Habs,3bw9iz,BinaryChode,3,Thu Jul 2 18:36:16 2015 UTC,Habs had a jr affiliate there way way back in the day I think. So a lot of the older people there are hab fans.

Habs,3bzr7i,hkycoach,7,Fri Jul 3 13:50:45 2015 UTC,I think that the fact that he wants to use his prospects fill the holes is good.  I'm pretty confident we have the elements to fill our needs in the team right now
Habs,3bzr7i,televisionceo,2,Fri Jul 3 14:16:12 2015 UTC,"Yea, I went off on a rant the other day about making sure that we give our prospects a chance; but I keep forgetting that DLR, Beaulieu, and Pateryn are progressing into larger roles with the team.  I guess it just feels so... glacial.  But it's not like we're drafting early in the 1st and getting players that can immediately make that leap to the NHL."

After watching just about every playoff game, I don't think Montreal can beat teams like Chicago and Tampa Bay, and some others in the west, who play that style.  The team needs an offensive injection, but of course that would mean giving up some quality players."

It's an odd place because they have been building a while. But as we have seen. The McDavid effect has opened doors to players it didn't before.   It's still incredibly unlikely (but it has been a WILD OFFSEASON) that Ebs moves.   If he did I am not sure Montreal would want to pay the price.

Habs,3bxe4q,bsaures,1 point,Fri Jul 3 12:57:44 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't call it a surprise at all, Oshie is a perennial second liner. Good player but only one 20 goal season and his career high in points is 60. He would have been a great addition to our top six, but I think he's a tad overrated and that he went for reasonable value"
Habs,3bxe4q,LegendaryWolfee,-10,Fri Jul 3 13:01:02 2015 UTC,So you were willing to give up gallagher or galchenyuk?
Habs,3bxe4q,bsaures,13,Thu Jul 2 23:15:02 2015 UTC,What they gave up for oshie wasn't anywhere near the value of galchenyuk or Gallagher
Habs,3bxe4q,LegendaryWolfee,-6,Thu Jul 2 23:17:47 2015 UTC,Brouwer was within 4 pts of both of them   Copley is an excellent  goalie prospect (925 sv pct last year) and a third  From st louis's perspective it would take gallagher or galchenyuk to match that
Habs,3bxe4q,bsaures,10,Thu Jul 2 23:30:48 2015 UTC,"Brouwer is a older player, who has most 3 years left in his prime, galchenyuk and Gallagher haven't even got to the age of 24 yet"
Habs,3bxe4q,SiegeWar,-9,Thu Jul 2 23:33:18 2015 UTC,Which is why they added the prospect and the third.
Habs,3bxe4q,bsaures,1 point,Thu Jul 2 23:46:44 2015 UTC,"That still isn't anywhere near the same value.   Brouwer is a 3rd liner, the Gallys are second liners (Gallagher actually produces at the rate of a first liner). Not to mention that potential and age are the biggest factors.   In fact, we could have gotten Oshie for  Desharnais + Condon + a 2nd"
Habs,3bxe4q,SiegeWar,-5,Thu Jul 2 23:52:03 2015 UTC,Brouwer was third among washigton forwards in icetime he played more than galchenyuk and gallagher but ya hes a 3rd liner. Brouwer also is a much moee complete player being a effective pker as well as offensive somethig gallagher and galchenyuk  dont do. He is also bigger and much more physical than both of them throwing more than 50 more hits than the two of them combined.   Stlouis is about winning now and right now brouwer is as good of a player as gallagher atleast.
Habs,3bxe4q,bsaures,5,Fri Jul 3 00:09:24 2015 UTC,"No, Brouwer is not as good as Gallagher  While it is true Brouwer is better than a third liner...  However, Galchenyuk  is slightly better than Brouwer while being 8 years younger and producing more with a MUCH higher ceiling.   I hope you're aware that potential and age are one of the most important factors in determining value.  Not to mention both players produce more points per 60 than Brouwer does."
Habs,3bxe4q,SiegeWar,-4,Fri Jul 3 00:15:31 2015 UTC,Im well aware that age affects value i am also aware however that a teams situation also has a big effect on teams valuations.   For example lets look at your brilliant idea of dd. First off they already have backes Stastny and lehtera as their top 3 centres. All three are better players than dd. Desharnis also doeant fit with their team mold of bigger players. The blues have only one player who is shorter than 6 feet and less than 200 pounds and thats Schwartz. They obviously put a premium on size something as you may be aware desharnis  lacks. So they need a winger and value size...sounds like troy brouwer is the exact kind of player they would overvalue.  Im not saying that i would do it because i wouldnt but coming from stlouis end they wanted a winger back and with max being to far ahead and weise dsp etc not being worth enough any trade would have to include one of the two for them to do it. You dont have to like it but thats rhe reality.
Habs,3bxe4q,SiegeWar,2,Fri Jul 3 00:52:33 2015 UTC,Backes is a natural winger. Moving Desharnais as their third line center and using Backes as their top line winger would actually be very beneficial.   Not to mention I only suggested a player with similar production as Brouwer. I would have said Weise but his value isn't close to that of Brouwer's.  You seem to also have completely ignored the fact that Gallagher is already a much better player than Brouwer
Habs,3bxe4q,SiegeWar,1 point,Fri Jul 3 00:56:07 2015 UTC,First off they already have backes Stastny and lehtera as their top 3 centres   would you look at that... they signed Kyle Brodziak who is a center

Anywhere I can fit in and help the team win, I’m more than happy to do so,” said the 2010 Memorial Cup champion, who has 25 goals and 66 points in 198 career NHL games. “I don’t look at it as Top 6 or Bottom 6; if you look at the teams that are winning nowadays, they have four lines that all play. Anywhere the coach wants me, I’ll thrive in that role and try to make the team better.""  HE HAS THE RIGHT ATTITUDE that is for sure"

Habs,3bvjxg,supersillybuffalo,5,Thu Jul 2 14:49:29 2015 UTC,"The official posting on the Habs website does mention that it is a two-way. Unless he takes a huge step in progression, I agree. He will be regularly used in the AHL"

Habs,3bvjxg,Backfire16,3,Thu Jul 2 19:13:35 2015 UTC,Kassian Smith-Pelly Wiese Andrighetto   None of these players have the skill/finesse to play 2nd line RW for a cup competitive team.
Habs,3bvjxg,quadriplegic_cheetah,2,Thu Jul 2 22:32:50 2015 UTC,"We don't know much about Kassian yet, he has the potential to be a 20 goal scorer.  10 goals in 42 games, 14 goals in 73 games in his last two seasons. You don't need to be deep at every position in order to win the cup. You have to be good at most positions yes, but not all. Look at the 2012 LA Kings, their offence was pretty poor. Also DSP is 22 and has yet to really showcase everything, and Wiese is actually an above average 4th liner. Also from what we've seen, Andrighetto could have top 6 potential."
Habs,3bvjxg,Vegaz77,0,Thu Jul 2 23:28:44 2015 UTC,I thought the whole point of a 2-way contract was that you don't have to clear waivers?
Habs,3bvjxg,EricLapointe,2,Thu Jul 2 23:56:12 2015 UTC,2 way is that you are paid less while in ahl. Waivers depend on age or game played. That's why a lot of 2 ways don't have to clear waivers.
Habs,3bvjxg,Vegaz77,1 point,Fri Jul 3 02:56:21 2015 UTC,"Ah, thanks.  I'll have to look up the age/games thing.  2-way also gets to remove the cap hit entirely, I believe, right?  Though 2-way cap hits also tends to be below what gets removed from a 1-way anyway.."
Habs,3bvjxg,Muter91,5,Fri Jul 3 11:46:48 2015 UTC,"I like Thomas, he is relentless on the forecheck. When he was on a line with Bourni and JDLFR they tore other teams fourth lines to shreds."
Habs,3bvjxg,HammerOfTheSlobs,12,Thu Jul 2 15:27:18 2015 UTC,"He is an electrifying player, I would like to see more of him."
Habs,3bvjxg,Fabien_Lamour,19,Thu Jul 2 14:59:01 2015 UTC,electrifying? Seems kind of an over statement.
Habs,3bvjxg,HammerOfTheSlobs,4,Thu Jul 2 15:49:05 2015 UTC,"He's a lot better than he's given credit for imo. Hard to the puck, never stops moving, fast and gritty. He may not have amazing stats, but he makes things happen when he's on the ice. He just happens to be playing about 8 min a game on the 4th line, so his GAP line is pretty sparse."
Habs,3bvjxg,Batmarde,2,Thu Jul 2 18:21:45 2015 UTC,He played 19 games and had 1 point. Calm down lol
Habs,3bvjxg,HammerOfTheSlobs,7,Thu Jul 2 18:24:06 2015 UTC,"18 games, but whatever, I am not saying that he was the second coming of Wayne Gretzky, just that when he was on the ice he was noticeable and clearly gave it his all."
Habs,3bvjxg,Batmarde,0,Thu Jul 2 18:47:55 2015 UTC,I know but there's people coming out with all sorts of fancy advanced stats saying he put up elite scoring chances when he was in Montreal but was only limited to about 8 min of ice time each game. Maybe the fact he had great numbers is because the sample is really small? I mean according to shooting percentage and scoring chances Nyquist should've won the Maurice Richard this year but shit averages out over a whole season.   I liked what I saw but all it did was give me hope that he might not be a career AHL player. That said there's other rookies I'd put on the top 6 before him

Habs,3bwj1b,axepig,4,Thu Jul 2 19:16:27 2015 UTC,"I think Chucky will stay at left wing through the 15/16 season.  Pleks will be a UFA at the end of the season and we'll re-visit Chucky at center then.  I hope we re-sign Pleks, but who knows at that point.  Chucky will continue work in to the C role a bit this year, but I think the team will stay largely unchanged down the middle this season.  Eller is a decent #3, and while we (/r/habs) love to hate DD, he's not completely shitting the bed as our 1C, so no reason to force the change.  So down the left we have Patches, Chucky, DLR (since I'm assuming Eller is staying at 3C).  If we trade Eller, which is entirely possible after his... unhappiness... with his usage last season.  I could see some movement.  Specifically if Pleks falls off (because hey, he isn't getting any younger) and we trade Eller; then I could see Pleks moved to 3C, Chucky into 2C and trying to bring in an LW in the Eller trade.  So... Eller + Fucale for a 2LW?  Pleks to 3C, Chucky to 2C?  I could see that happening.  It's all just speculation though."
Habs,3bwj1b,hkycoach,3,Thu Jul 2 22:00:32 2015 UTC,"It's July second, I think plenty can change between now, and the first regular season game.  Beyond that, If Chucky plays C, DD can play wing, or be traded for a LW."
Habs,3bwj1b,shiram,5,Thu Jul 2 19:03:44 2015 UTC,"Even Eller can play LW (ya ya, Eller can only play C, even though that's not true) I think those three are interchangeable at C and LW.   It is important to remember that Patches was on only natural LW last year as well."
Habs,3bwj1b,Almostneverclever,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:05:09 2015 UTC,"Chucky-DD-Eller-DLR are all centers and two of them are going to play left wing. I don't know which two, but I'm guessing Chucky and DLR.      Of course all this is moot because I really don't think MB is done."

Habs,3bvrcr,Sehs,5,Thu Jul 2 15:46:17 2015 UTC,Yeah it actually wasn't that bad. Bergevin was simply attempting to clarify a common misconception about the team's perceived shortcomings (defensive-style of play) with its actual shortcomings (lack of offensive punch). It just seems like a lot of people confuse the two issues.
Habs,3bvrcr,axepig,3,Thu Jul 2 17:20:34 2015 UTC,"Even though I'm not a Therrien hater, that response from Cantin seems pretty stupid if true. He could more or less easily have pointed out that we were the lowest scoring team to have made the playoffs. Guess he really wasn't prepared at all?"
Habs,3bvrcr,theres__no_time,8,Thu Jul 2 16:01:29 2015 UTC,"Chicago literally have a dozen goals more scored than us though. It's not about being offensive, it's about being clutch."
Habs,3bvrcr,Sehs,3,Thu Jul 2 16:03:19 2015 UTC,"It's about being balanced. I think we would all agree that Chicago has more offensive punch than the Habs. I have no doubt that with Chicago's forward group, Therrien's system would have produced more goals for."
Habs,3bvrcr,axepig,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:15:11 2015 UTC,Oh I know but if he wanted to try to back up his point he could have referenced our goals scored and goals against compared to other playoff teams. It certainly seems to point to us being a more defensive team and it's better than mumbling and having no answer.

Habs,3bvrcr,Gabroux,1 point,Sat Jul 4 22:32:03 2015 UTC,"No, not saying that.  The Hawks won and we lost in the second round because they were a better a team.  I'm just saying that our offense scored six less goals this year than the team that won the Stanley Cup."

Habs,3bvrcr,Reggief,10,Thu Jul 2 15:46:31 2015 UTC,PA just said to tony Marinaro the Canadiens system is defensive first hockey.  He also agreed the Habs are one of the most defensive teams in the league.  This is coming from a player on last years roster so why did MB get so bent out of shape?  I heard the question and I believe it was fair. This team uses a  dump and chase system instead of entering the zone with speed.  This is exactly why a player like chucky is having some trouble flourishing with his unique skill set.

Habs,3bvrcr,televisionceo,4,Thu Jul 2 16:39:38 2015 UTC,However he also ran the best PP unit in the league. Babcock runs a defense first system and lots of teams do but that shouldn't mean you stifle offense
Habs,3bvrcr,WhiskeySeven,2,Thu Jul 2 18:39:32 2015 UTC,"Right but when we talk about ""defence first system"" we're referring to 5-on-5. Obviously they aren't going to be playing defence first on the PP.   Montreal scored more 5-on5 goals last season than Detroit did btw.  So the only place Montreal would be ""stifling"" offence would be on the powerplay where Detroit score twice as many poweplay goals as Montreal."
Habs,3bvrcr,theres__no_time,2,Thu Jul 2 18:54:31 2015 UTC,"yep, it's quite similar to therrien's system. And it's alo why the leafs will have more success this season."
Habs,3bvrcr,WhiskeySeven,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:41:56 2015 UTC,"Babcock plays a possession game, which is inherently defensive. The Therrien-Habs play a risk minimization game, which is inherently retarded.  edit: I know I'm new here but what's with the downvoting habits?"
Habs,3bvrcr,Fenrir,2,Thu Jul 2 19:52:22 2015 UTC,"What quantifiable measurements are you using to define a ""possession game"" vs a ""risk management game"" and how *do Therrien vs Babcock fit into each?"
Habs,3bvrcr,theres__no_time,5,Thu Jul 2 20:04:16 2015 UTC,"Quantifiable? Oh there's all sorts of analytic number crunchers for that.  As I come to understand it: a defensive system minimizes shots against in whatever way it can, and when you have the puck you automatically minimize shots against. You can have a defensive system that is more of a neutral-zone trap, like Lemaire, but it won't necessarily be a possession system going forward.  Hockey is weird in that there are zonal plays and philosophies that are hard to categorize. What I've come to learn about Therrien is that he isn't defensive, our ShotsAgainst and other stats are middling, it's that he's risk-averse - dumping in, long-stretch passes (a la Carbonneau), dumps off the glass.  He wants to minimize turnovers in the neutralzone and giveaways in the o-zone. The idea is to throw, throw the puck down to the other end and capitalize on their mistakes and miscues.   I'm not a fan because his system is entirely predicated upon effort and speed, and not on skill or creativity. It's not an offense-based or defense-based system, it's literally a risk-management one."
Habs,3bvrcr,axepig,3,Thu Jul 2 20:31:30 2015 UTC,"This is 100% correct. Therrien has the team play conservatively, not defensively.  If anyone has any doubts, go look at Detroit's shots against or scoring chances against and compare them to ours."

Habs,3bvrcr,axepig,-2,Thu Jul 2 21:08:00 2015 UTC,Remember that PA played in NYI and Colorado... Those places aren't really defensive so I don't think PA is a good source for that.

Habs,3bvrcr,Kovechkin,2,Thu Jul 2 16:50:43 2015 UTC,No one has played for every team but PA did play in both conferences so he did play against every team a few times. He would be great person to ask about whether or not a team is defensive.

Ask about the godawful PP and why he re-upped the idiots in charge of it.  Ask him if he really believes Price can have another vezina year with zero injuries to key players, essentially the only reason they got into the playoffs. A betting man says next year won't be so good.  EDIT - And while we're grilling him, ask why this is the only team in the NHL without a captain and why they have such difficulty in picking one.

Habs,3bvrcr,lehabs,-5,Thu Jul 2 16:32:53 2015 UTC,"Well the point is DD and Eller are making enough to be the second line centre. However we also have Plek, who switches in and out. Someone needs to go so that Galchenyuk can get time on the third/second. As is I find it's wasted money"

Do they communicate, yes, but it is rare that a GM will not intrude on coaching decisions and MB has stated repeatedly that this is his philosophy. With that said they do talk but line-up formations are not MB's doing.  Someone needs to go? Maybe, but we don't know what MB is working on so maybe he is trying to do that. It is the off season so we could all relax and let the guy do his work. You also need depth."

Habs,3bv66o,HammerOfTheSlobs,-1,Thu Jul 2 14:07:13 2015 UTC,Really so being knocked out multiple times already in his career makes him a good fighter?   The only thing going for him is he is big as anyone with a boxing background will tell you he has terrible form relying way to much on his reach and his size constantly leaving himself exposed. The pedan fight is the perfect example he got knockout with a clean shot because he wasnt protecting himself properly. Watching a few more fights of his its painfully obvious that he doesnt have any technique.  Chris nilan pointed the same thing out after he got popped that he will not last long fighting the way he does and among the habs community no one knows more about fighting in hockey than him.

Habs,3bv66o,BuddhasLittleWarlock,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:31:44 2015 UTC,Here is the gazette article that had some of nilans comments   http://montrealgazette.com/sports/hockey/nhl/montreal-canadiens/habs-prospect-tinordi-getting-knocked-out-brings-up-questions-about-fighting  I agree with his general assesment. One thing that is also very obvious during the fight is he has trouble keeping his guard hand  in place which would have blocked or deflected the knockout  blow.  Pedan from seeing tinordi in junior knows his style and immediately goes to the inside to take tinordi out of his comfort zone and takes advantage of his weak defense.    By contrast watch mccarron fight. Same size and build yet he doesnt get lit up like that because he doesnt open himself up for those hits. Keeps himself protected while pushing the pace.
Habs,3bv66o,bsaures,0,Thu Jul 2 15:20:17 2015 UTC,Fights are overated anyway. It's all about sending a message

Habs,3bs5rs,Sehs,3,Wed Jul 1 19:37:09 2015 UTC,Just wait until the season starts.  A part of the reason why Colorado traded him was because of a falling out with the coaching staff.  Looks like the same story here.
Habs,3bs5rs,habuheard,17,Thu Jul 2 00:12:36 2015 UTC,"I can't stand Therrien, but let's be realistic. The group of guys who have been traded/waived from this team the past few seasons and have complained after they left, all tend to be flakey, sub-par players.

Habs,3bs5rs,zeMVK,27,Wed Jul 1 18:59:34 2015 UTC,"I'm sure there's plenty of people on the team they feel this way. Sekac was another player that got the shit end of the stick and was removed from the team.   I'll never like therrien a coach, he makes stupid decisions all the time."

So we can either get used to it or hope the habs have a terrible season, miss they playoffs and he gets canned."
Habs,3bs5rs,theres__no_time,1 point,Thu Jul 2 13:49:05 2015 UTC,"Your comparisons are poor.  Evaluating Therrien solely by wins is the same as saying that all undergraduates who graduated are the same, that all departments in a successful company are well run regardless of their individual results and that every member of a sales team is great as long the department's overall sales are good.  None of which are things any reasonably intelligent person would suggest."
Habs,3bs5rs,Fenrir,1 point,Fri Jul 3 02:20:46 2015 UTC,"And evaluating him solely on shot metrics is equally poor.  EDIT: I would argue any reasonably intelligent person would also evaluate a persons performance holistically using as much information as possible.   Your opinion of Therrien is pretty clear through your comment history. It seems as though you're comments all seem to revolve around the same stats constantly being regurgitated to argue his lack of competence as a coach yet you willingly discard any information or evidence that would suggest otherwise. Your argument that PK Subban has become worse is a good example of what I'm talking about. It's intellectually lazy. But hey what do I know? I'm less than ""reasonably intelligent""."
Habs,3bs5rs,theres__no_time,0,Fri Jul 3 03:05:55 2015 UTC,"Yes, which is why that's not what I've done. There's tons of evidence indicating Therrien is a poor coach."

Habs,3bvqwd,BuddhasLittleWarlock,2,Thu Jul 2 15:27:14 2015 UTC,My money's on Bergevin looking at Joel Ward or Eric Fehr. Maybe Shawn Matthias. I know that those guys would be on Therrien's wish list.
Habs,3bvqwd,axepig,4,Thu Jul 2 15:29:20 2015 UTC,"Fehr is a defense expert, he would be another 3rd-4th line checker I doubt we really need him even though he's good. Also we already have a plethora of centers so I doubt we take Matthias unless we trade DD or Eller(plsno)"
Habs,3bvqwd,Staks,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:31:58 2015 UTC,"Ward could be great for the right price and he is probably the best choice out of the remaining UFAs. 6'1, 226 pounds, can score goals (however I don't know how much of that is due to Backstrom... Did he play on the PP with him?) and is not afraid to throw his weight around.  However I think he would just be a minor upgrade, and not the real solution we need. I still think trading for someone like David Backes would be a much better choice.  The only concern is our line-up becomes much harder to adjust. The most likely in this scenario would look something like this I would imagine, which is cutting De La Rose, who was a great performer last year:  Pacioretty - Desharnais - Gallagher  Galchenyuk  - Plekanec   - Ward  Weise  -   Eller    - Smith-Pelly  Flynn  -   Mitchell - Kassian  Our right wingers would have quite the combined weight lol. The problem is, we actually have a lot of right wingers now. I don't even know what we'd do with Weise and Kassian."
Habs,3bvqwd,axepig,3,Thu Jul 2 22:28:07 2015 UTC,"If MB is really ballsy he will go for Semin for a 1yr contract. Otherwise I think Ward/Tlusty will be targets, depends on the asking price though"

Habs,3bvqwd,axepig,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:06:42 2015 UTC,Semin has the skills to be our top RW though.. If it's a 1 year contract he might actually give a shit and play

Habs,3bvqwd,axepig,1 point,Thu Jul 2 22:05:47 2015 UTC,"Tlusty is pretty good too, I wouldn't say no to Ward depending on his $$ and MAYBE Bergenheim but that's a bit of a stretch"
Habs,3bt0w1,LegendaryWolfee,2,Wed Jul 1 22:21:59 2015 UTC,He is a 6'1 200 pound Left D who is from Montreal. He is 25 and will most likely be an insurance marker if someone gets injured.  Edit : 600k with gurantee 325k.
Habs,3bt0w1,ANAL_PROLAPSE_,5,Wed Jul 1 22:24:03 2015 UTC,So it's Jarred Tinordi or Mark Barberio when some one gets injured eh?
Habs,3bt0w1,ANAL_PROLAPSE_,10,Wed Jul 1 22:37:19 2015 UTC,We have lots of D depth it can be whoever plays the best at training camp and during the season really.
Habs,3bt0w1,mr_potroast,3,Wed Jul 1 22:38:25 2015 UTC,"Probably a dumb question but what does it mean when it says ""one year two way""?"
Habs,3bt0w1,Emperor_Billik,13,Wed Jul 1 22:35:04 2015 UTC,It is a one year contract and two way means when he is sent down to the AHL his salary changes. For example if this was a 1 way contract and he signed for 600k then if he played in NHL or AHL we pay him that set price but a 2 way means when playing in AHL it will be much less. I think I fully explained that best I could.

Habs,3bt0w1,BuddhasLittleWarlock,-1,Wed Jul 1 23:53:32 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure a 2 way contract means they don't have to clear waivers to play in the AHL despite age
Habs,3bt0w1,SiegeWar,3,Thu Jul 2 00:32:58 2015 UTC,"That is often the misconception of it but waivers goes off of age and games played. I learned that not long ago I thought it was like the video games but EA has it wrong.  Here is what it is from the wiki.  ""A two-way contract is a professional sports contract which stipulates that an athlete’s salary is dependent upon the league in which the athlete is assigned to play. This is opposed to a one-way contract that would pay the same salary regardless of where the athlete is assigned to play.""  ""Two-way contracts are common for professional ice hockey players who aspire to play in the National Hockey League (NHL).Any hockey player entering the NHL for the first time will sign an entry-level, two-way contract with an NHL team stipulating that he will receive a higher salary if assigned to play with the NHL team, but will receive a lower salary if assigned to play for a team in the minor leagues such as the American Hockey League or the ECHL."""

Habs,3bs2bt,televisionceo,12,Wed Jul 1 18:19:48 2015 UTC,"Sounds like it's a good hockey trade that just sucks from a locker room perspective. It's inevitable that we sometimes lose the heart and soul guys we love.  Also I think Beaulieu's presence allows Prust to go without leaving a big hole, we still have a guy who can throw punches when needed."
Habs,3bs2bt,webu,3,Wed Jul 1 18:26:55 2015 UTC,Isn't that Kassian?
Habs,3bs2bt,Almostneverclever,2,Wed Jul 1 19:40:15 2015 UTC,Exactly.
Habs,3bs2bt,BuddhasLittleWarlock,13,Wed Jul 1 20:28:08 2015 UTC,"I'm really just kind of confused about this trade.  Now we get the rights to the Kassian gifs, though."
Habs,3bs2bt,FeelsLike93,10,Wed Jul 1 18:14:21 2015 UTC,:( I liked Prust
Habs,3bs2bt,CareyPrice,6,Wed Jul 1 18:15:08 2015 UTC,"Sometimes I did, often I didn't.  If Kassian is the same, at least we save money."
Habs,3bs2bt,HLef,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:19:18 2015 UTC,"If Prust had better hands with the puck he'd have been more useful. Also if he was faster. And a heavy weight. That's not to say I didn't like Prust. Prust was a real character guy and when he was acquired he brought a lot of heart and grit to a team that sorely lacked it. With the third line as good as it is losing him won't hurt us and Kassian has potential to put up more points as is, plus his age, size and physicality is above that of Prust."
Habs,3bs2bt,tattlerat,22,Wed Jul 1 23:08:13 2015 UTC,This better not be Weise #2 ffs
Habs,3bs2bt,clocks52,23,Wed Jul 1 18:19:40 2015 UTC,This better be Weise 2.0 ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Habs,3bs2bt,OatsNraisin,4,Wed Jul 1 19:09:13 2015 UTC,"Honestly.  Theres a good chance it could be.  The only reason I can see the nucks trading him is that they may be making room for a few prospects to come up.  That's the only thing I can think of.  Because for us to have Prust, doesn't make too much sense.  Guess we'll see what happens!"
Habs,3bs2bt,clocks52,9,Wed Jul 1 19:30:39 2015 UTC,Canucks fans aren't happy so that may be a good sign
Habs,3bs2bt,Powdreams,6,Wed Jul 1 18:20:46 2015 UTC,He's one of their rising stars at 24 and we sent them a 31 year old. Of course they aren't happy.
Habs,3bs2bt,RagnarokAM,8,Wed Jul 1 18:58:13 2015 UTC,Not a rising star. Just a player with inconsistent skill and seemingly untapped potential.
Habs,3bs2bt,IamHobs,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:19:22 2015 UTC,"Canucks fan here.  He is young but anything but a rising star.  He has not shown anything to say he is going to live up to anything near what his potential was when he was drafted.  He has had huge issues with laziness and commitment, and 4 coaches (including Buffalo) have not been able to get through to him.  He is also known to party too much, which could be an even bigger issue in a city like Montreal.  Also, he's dealing with horrific back injuries as well.  There were times where he couldn't even get out of bed last season, and Burrows said today that Zack used to come to the rink some days with tennis-ball sized lumps on his back.    That being said, its not like MTL is giving up a ton with Prust having only a year left on his deal, and they did get a draft pick in return.  In that sense, I would say you won the trade.  You might also get Prust back after this season in the UFA market if you want him, as his fiancee is a TV personality in Montreal.  From what Benning is saying, the Canucks want to be active on the big names in next years UFA market, and therefore may let Prust walk after a season for cap reasons."
Habs,3bs2bt,guap_,1 point,Thu Jul 2 07:21:41 2015 UTC,"Great insight! Thanks for the inside perspective, and hope that Kassian hits his maturity peak here before it ruins him.

Habs,3bs2bt,AwkwardAwkwardness,6,Wed Jul 1 18:38:09 2015 UTC,There's gotta be something else going on. To me that's a pure cap move.  Prusty can't be happy about having to move either.
Habs,3bs2bt,Microdinosaurus,2,Wed Jul 1 18:16:08 2015 UTC,Did you not watch the Tampa series? He was done after that. I had no problem with it but it seems some one MT? MB? had issue with it.

Habs,3bs2bt,Lyver,4,Wed Jul 1 18:14:26 2015 UTC,Although Prust has been at the heart of this team for a while we save money and get almost the same player back with maybe more offensive upside. I am fine with this deal.
Habs,3bs2bt,tinran,3,Wed Jul 1 18:18:39 2015 UTC,"Sorry to see Prust go,but it might be for the best.  I'm willing to wait it out and see how this works out.  One other good thing,....it's out of conference too."
Habs,3bs2bt,ShivasIrons983E,5,Wed Jul 1 18:18:57 2015 UTC,I don't understand this trade from Vancouver's perspective.  Why did they do it?

Habs,3bs2bt,ProjectileHerpes,3,Wed Jul 1 20:29:43 2015 UTC,Damn. I love Prusty. Didn't see him being moved at all.
Habs,3bs2bt,Kain292,3,Wed Jul 1 18:26:58 2015 UTC,Wait - which way did the pick go?  Everything I'm reading is it's a MTL -> VAN...
Habs,3bs2bt,hkycoach,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:27:32 2015 UTC,The pick is coming from VAN. Title is misleading; it's Prust for Kassian + 5th.
Habs,3bs2bt,birdsong4j,3,Wed Jul 1 23:08:19 2015 UTC,I think we won this trade. Kassian will likely grow on me eventually but until then he reminds me of that weird smelly kid in grade school. The kid that used to sneak down to the fridge for a mouthful of liquid nesquick every night.
Habs,3bs2bt,imtoocoldforthisshit,3,Wed Jul 1 19:41:22 2015 UTC,"At least we won't have to worry about refs hating on Prust for 'breaking a code' or some BS. Still, he was a decent player for us. Kassian is 3 inches taller and 20 pounds heavier with a mean streak and better hands. I'm sure we'll be OK."

Habs,3bs2bt,MTL9,2,Wed Jul 1 19:07:49 2015 UTC,"Any word on who this Kassian guy is?  I've never heard of him.  Gotta say despite his good attitude, I won't miss Prust.  He was a great character and a good locker room guy but he wasn't good at anything except fighting."
Habs,3bs2bt,OatsNraisin,2,Wed Jul 1 19:08:16 2015 UTC,My girlfriend broke up with me at the beginning of the month. She was the reason I am now a Habs fan.   Now Prusty is off the team? I don't know what hurts more.
Habs,3bs2bt,walexj,2,Wed Jul 1 21:01:48 2015 UTC,Just to save $1M?  Why throw in the pick?
Habs,3bs2bt,jshare,4,Wed Jul 1 18:14:08 2015 UTC,Apparently we got the pick!

Habs,3bs2bt,mondt,3,Wed Jul 1 18:19:09 2015 UTC,"Because Kassian is 24 and was a 1st round pick, he could become solid. If he hits his full potential, everyone will be thinking about how great of a trade this is."

Habs,3bs2bt,hkycoach,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:18:07 2015 UTC,I agree. Being up against the cap means you can't pounce on opportunity when it's there.

Habs,3bskm8,MrDudeRI,2,Wed Jul 1 20:29:26 2015 UTC,"Stupid question here: does the habs have certain rules (except for the retired numbers) or players are free to choose any available number?  I mean, many numbers seems to be chosen over and over again."
Habs,3bskm8,Robot_Reconnaissance,5,Wed Jul 1 20:35:43 2015 UTC,"I don't believe it's restricted much beyond retired numbers. For example, I think it's New Jersey that doesn't allow high numbers? I'm fairly certain we have no rules regarding that kind of thing."

Habs,3bskm8,VenomenonMTL,1 point,Thu Jul 2 00:52:16 2015 UTC,Cause Lou wants to seem like a hardass for no reason. Maybe to make the Devils seem more like a legit team? I dunno
Habs,3bskm8,OliWood,4,Thu Jul 2 01:45:47 2015 UTC,"I think there are some rules that aren't public. Sekac was assigned a number, 26, and allegedly wanted to change it. Plekanec told him not to ask, and just take the number.   That said, it was Pateryn's number that he wanted (64) and despite not being on the main roster at the time, that may be why Plekanec told him not to ask. And the Habs never said no since he never formally asked."
Habs,3bskm8,TreCool71A,3,Wed Jul 1 21:07:21 2015 UTC,"Didn't Gallagher and Galchenyuk change numbers rather early into their NHL careers?  Perhaps just Gallagher, but I can't see them giving a hard time other than retired numbers, and in this case some one else's number. AHL affiliate or not."
Habs,3bskm8,hockeyrugby,4,Wed Jul 1 21:56:24 2015 UTC,"Galchenyuk with the 27 is weird, i'd love to see him rock the 94 like his junior days!"
Habs,3bskm8,zebra_heaDD,3,Wed Jul 1 22:29:45 2015 UTC,"Gallagher changed from #73 to #11 when we traded for Ryder. IIRC, Gallagher wore 11 in junior and was assigned 73 when he made the Habs full time."
Habs,3bv9d6,Captain_Roy,7,Thu Jul 2 12:55:21 2015 UTC,"Yes, you are allowed to go over the contract limit and be over/under the cap ceiling/floor during the off season. There's a deadline by which time you have to have everything done right before the season starts."
Habs,3bv9d6,MacerV,1 point,Thu Jul 2 13:02:44 2015 UTC,I knew about the cap situation just not the contracts. Thanks.
Habs,3bv9d6,jo_maka,1 point,Thu Jul 2 13:04:32 2015 UTC,I think the deadline is before the preseason IIRC.
Habs,3bv9d6,Gabroux,1 point,Thu Jul 2 13:06:23 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure it's before the regular season, just like the cap"
Habs,3bv9d6,MacerV,2,Thu Jul 2 13:20:03 2015 UTC,"Was looking at the CBA and one quick thing to note;   Age 18 and age 19 Players who were returned to Juniors, and who have not played 11 NHL Games in one season, shall be exempt from inclusion in the 50 Player limit.    So Nikita Scherbak, Brett Lernout, and Jeremy Gregoire, don't count towards the limit.   Couldn't find the thing about the preaseason deadline but I'm pretty sure its there somewhere. It'd make no sense to cap a team from taking on prospects in deals simply because they don't have the contract room."
Habs,3bv9d6,Strifezard,2,Thu Jul 2 13:28:39 2015 UTC,"I keep track of all our contracts on an excel sheet, as well as cap hits, and a bunch of other stats. Started doing that when capgeek originally went down. We should have only 40 players signed right now. That number doesn't include RFA's or UFA's, like Tinordi, Thomas or Gakchenyuk."
Habs,3bv9d6,sex_panther_by_odeon,4,Thu Jul 2 13:54:51 2015 UTC,"Those 51 count bowman, Allen, gonchar etc. So no panic"
Habs,3bv9d6,jshare,0,Thu Jul 2 13:05:09 2015 UTC,Those players actually aren't counted (I actually counted them to make sure).
Habs,3bv9d6,supersillybuffalo,2,Thu Jul 2 13:08:10 2015 UTC,"I think you miscounted, and Fanager's count at the top is misleading in this case.  If you add up the headline counts: 11+7+2+1+21= 42. That doesn't count U/RFAs but it does include PAP as a buyout."
Habs,3bw9m9,hkycoach,8,Thu Jul 2 17:51:04 2015 UTC,"Why is Galchenyuk orange? He was drafted by Bergevin, with a draft pick that Gainey/Gauthier didn't trade for."
Habs,3bw9m9,KarlPilkingtonsBrain,2,Thu Jul 2 18:01:33 2015 UTC,"Because Bergy just arrived and I think Timmins did the draft alone-ish. He says MB didn't do much in the draft, if it's true the 2012 draft should be an exception and should be neither GM's accomplishments, Timmins did it"
Habs,3bw9m9,axepig,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:07:46 2015 UTC,"Also, it was Gauthier's moves that led to that shitty year and get the pick. MB just called the name, Gauthier lined them up and knocked the failure pins down."
Habs,3bw9m9,Hoarse-horse,3,Thu Jul 2 18:15:16 2015 UTC,So? Bergevin could've easily gone for a different player if he wanted. Gauthier wasn't the one who got the final say because he wasn't there. It was all Bergevin's to make.
Habs,3bw9m9,SiegeWar,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:43:07 2015 UTC,"Not screwing up a third overall pick by giving trust to your scout is good delegation imo, something MB does very well"
Habs,3bw9m9,ClassActDude,7,Thu Jul 2 19:28:26 2015 UTC,"Change isn't always a good thing. By this logic Boston's GM is a mastermind because he's flipped a big part of his core.   Bergevin inherited some good pieces (Plekanec, paccioretty, Price, DD, Gallagher, Subban, etc.), so he didn't have to completely overhaul the roster. He's done a good job at getting rid of bad players and contracts (Cole, Gomez, Moen, Bork, Briere) and acquiring depth. He may not have acquired many core pieces in his 3 years, but to say that he hasn't done a good job is just stupid."
Habs,3bw9m9,athiestweed420,12,Thu Jul 2 18:51:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah, no.  Bergevin drafted Chucky.  I can't take Andrew Berkshire seriously anymore."
Habs,3bw9m9,SiegeWar,13,Thu Jul 2 18:00:54 2015 UTC,it's increasingly  harder and sad because they had a lot of potential. They are smart but they have an agenda and it's ruining their blog
Habs,3bw9m9,televisionceo,9,Thu Jul 2 18:16:44 2015 UTC,Berkshire is also kind of an ass on twitter.
Habs,3bw9m9,bsaures,7,Thu Jul 2 18:28:54 2015 UTC,He is one of the worst and most unproffessional writers that follows the habs with any regularity. He is one of those writers who claims to judge players using advance stats but only picks the stats that support his point never paiting a full picture that would contradict his point. Then if you bring up those points he acts like a dbag to you.
Habs,3bw9m9,jo_maka,6,Thu Jul 2 18:48:43 2015 UTC,Yea I've had a few arguments with him on twitter where I was civil and just trying to argue like adults and he went full douche. I've seen him do that to others such a child. I have zero respect for him or his page ever since.
Habs,3bw9m9,paul_33,3,Thu Jul 2 18:51:20 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say the most unprofessional because that wouldn't be fair. There are a lot worse than him.

Habs,3bw9m9,bsaures,0,Thu Jul 2 19:37:06 2015 UTC,"I don't whether it's funny or sad that you think you can identify what ""cherry picking"" is after providing such a brilliant example of it when you did your terrible Emelin analysis.  Berkshire can be a jerk, but I have yet to see any one call him on cherry picking and actually demonstrate it. Indeed, if you can direct me to one article where there's a clear error of logic or an example of cherry picking, I'll write it up and go post it on his site tomorrow.  He over states his conclusions on occassion, and doesn't always point out minor or confusing contrary evidence, but he's usually careful to define his parameters and his methods are very much in line with those of the broader analytics community.  The vast majority of the criticism he receives is from people who don't like his conclusions and his attitude (which is fine) but I've yet to see anyone come back at him with an argument that demonstrates clear intent to deceive, or even a crippling flaw in the analysis. Both of which were painfully present in the WOWY analyses you did, fyi."
Habs,3bw9m9,slayeryouth,1 point,Fri Jul 3 02:49:27 2015 UTC,Well since you bring up my emelin post wele discuss his analysis of him. The only arguement he has ever used is corsi (which is deeply flawed) he never acknowledges the fact that the other d pairings get a distinct zone start advantage at his expense as evident by him having a extremely low ozone start percentage but a better ozone finish percentage than all but subban.   Then theres his offense. Despite not getting Any of the opportunities offensively other dmen get at his expense he been arguably our second best dman offensively the last 3 years 5 on 5. He has an almost identical 5 on 5 ppg as markov. For a team that lacks offense he is in a real hurry to dump one of our best dman offensively.   Finally theres the playoffs last year. Emelin and petry were by far our best pairing in the playoffs. Despite taking some of the toughest mins possible emelin came out of the playoffs with better possession numbers than  bealieu who had just about the most sheltered  minutes possible yet when he comes out with his depth chart the ONLY player he moved was emelin below bealieu. Thats blatant bias as there was no evidence both regular stat or advanced stat in the playoff to support that change.  His work is extremely  flawed based heavily on possession stats (ask la and carolina how haveing good corsi worked out for them this year)
Habs,3bw9m9,SiegeWar,2,Fri Jul 3 03:27:23 2015 UTC,"Bergevin has said that he was eyeing Morgan Rielly in that draft, but deferred to the scouting staff who wanted Galchenyuk.  Which I mean, good for him for not just showing up and swinging his dick around because part of being an effective manager is knowing when to step back, but given his reluctance to take credit for drafting Galchenyuk, I'm not sure why anybody else shouldn't be reluctant to give it to him either."

Habs,3bw9m9,Fenrir,1 point,Thu Jul 2 21:16:26 2015 UTC,"Timmins drafted Chucky? Bergevin wanted Reilly and the scouts basically vetoed him. So, good call for Bergevin to listen to his scouts. Obviously."

Habs,3brw5g,LegendaryWolfee,14,Wed Jul 1 17:28:01 2015 UTC,Habs Sign Pateryn to a 2 year 1 way extension 575k / 750k / 850k in his 3 years left. I fully expect him to take over Gilbert's spot and Gilbert will be off the team by trade deadline.

Habs,3brw5g,Fenrir,5,Wed Jul 1 18:32:22 2015 UTC,Gilbert will be off the team by trade deadline.   Likely. That's another savings.
Habs,3brw5g,Almostneverclever,4,Wed Jul 1 18:52:27 2015 UTC,"Don't be so sure. Have to go into the season with at least 7 NHL caliber defenseman, preferably 8.       We have markov/emelin/baulieu/tinordi on the left and Subban/petrey/Gilbert/patteryn on the right. We could easily go into the season with say Tinordi in the AHL and Patryn or Gilbert in the press box."
Habs,3brw5g,habuheard,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:10:55 2015 UTC,"that's a good point.  That would be a hell of a good defense if we had all 8 of them going into the season.  If Tinordi and Beaulieu step up then great we can trade one or two of Emelin, Gilbert or Tinordi to get picks or in a package to get that 1C/1RW we need.  Until Beaulieu or Tinordi step up we would have Gilbert and Emelin for depth and to provide competition."

Habs,3brzxq,CaffeineHangover,26,Wed Jul 1 18:15:42 2015 UTC,Hockey wise I think we win the trade... but this still hurts. The guy was loved in Montreal and in the locker room. We do free some salary space.
Habs,3brzxq,BrutalRamen,12,Wed Jul 1 18:17:47 2015 UTC,"I really want to agree with that on an intellectual level, but yes, I'm much more sad about seeing Prust the person leave, rather than Prust the player."
Habs,3brzxq,CaffeineHangover,10,Wed Jul 1 18:19:37 2015 UTC,I think they definitely win this trade from a hockey perspective:  Kassian had 2 less points and 6 more goals in 40 less games than Prust. He costs 750k$ less than Prust and is 6-7 years younger. Add in a 5th rounder and there is no question Habs win this deal.
Habs,3brzxq,theres__no_time,5,Wed Jul 1 18:26:32 2015 UTC,"First, we are getting the 5th rounder. Second, pretty much everybody agrees Prust has very limited hockey sense.

Habs,3brzxq,Funkenbrain,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:17:14 2015 UTC,"Actually prust's value is that he does have enough hockey sense to be fairly effective on any line, as needed. He's strong on the boards, fast and makes very good passes down low.      The problem is that his body is breaking down. He hasn't really been fully healthy for a long time now, and may not be. He's a seriously positive influence on any locker room though, which may be what Vancouver needs."
Habs,3brzxq,Almostneverclever,11,Wed Jul 1 20:18:21 2015 UTC,Sold Prust at his highest value
Habs,3brzxq,fromage1,12,Wed Jul 1 18:24:28 2015 UTC,"Kass has all the tools.  Size, snarl, great skater, good passer.   Needs to be put in the right role. Can he play a 4th line roll? Yeah. But he's got the skill set to be a 2nd liner."
Habs,3brzxq,zebra_heaDD,2,Wed Jul 1 18:14:01 2015 UTC,Much like DSP. It will be nice to watch them battle for position of 2nd-3rd RW. Weise will keep them active too. We have the sneaky Gally backed up by three solid hockey players.
Habs,3brzxq,Adam87,0,Wed Jul 1 20:14:13 2015 UTC,If we're looking at Kassian or DSP as our 2nd winger.. goodbye hopes of producing more offence.

Habs,3brzxq,Microdinosaurus,2,Wed Jul 1 18:03:31 2015 UTC,"This is going to hurt the habs more than people here seem to think.  Prust was pound for pound the best fighter in the league.  Just him being there gave the Habs a large amount of respect from tougher teams, respect they badly needed because the drop off from him to the next fighter (Beaulieu?...Gallagher?) is pretty drastic."

Habs,3brzxq,FeelsLike93,7,Wed Jul 1 18:08:06 2015 UTC,"I like this, a younger and bigger Prust, and we get some more cap space. Sounds like an upgrade to me."
Habs,3brzxq,KimonS,3,Wed Jul 1 18:17:56 2015 UTC,It is. It's just sad to lose Prust. The guy was liked by everybody.
Habs,3brzxq,BrutalRamen,5,Wed Jul 1 18:26:39 2015 UTC,"Against the grain here, I like this trade a lot. Prust wasn't staying with us past this season, as much as I love him he wouldn't have been re-signed. Kass, if he stays the same as he is now, is Prust on a good offensive streak, and I think he could end up as a good 35 point guy who can jump up to top 6 in a pinch. Love it."
Habs,3brzxq,bcg_music,5,Wed Jul 1 18:18:46 2015 UTC,"Just found that it was Kassian + 5th to MTL...  I love this deal.  I liked Prusty but as Knuckles said on TSN, being the ""good guy in the room"" means that you've already got one foot out the door.  My break down of this trade:   Dropped 750k in cap space, in a tight cap situation. Got us a younger player with more upside* He's an RFA at the end of the season (easier to retain). And a draft pick.   Bergie, I love you.  Edit:  *My feeling is that Prust is at his peak.  Kassian may not be the player that Prust is right now, but I think he'll either pan out, or move to the 4th line - where frankly Prust would probably end up during his decline anyway."

Habs,3brzxq,Fenrir,3,Wed Jul 1 18:22:19 2015 UTC,"i think more than slightly, he had 10 goals last year in 42 games. More than anyone else in bottom 6 (besides Eller)."
Habs,3brzxq,nootz123,3,Wed Jul 1 18:28:50 2015 UTC,"Exactly. 9 of those were even strength, too. There's some talk that his numbers are maybe inflated by his teammates, though."
Habs,3brzxq,Fenrir,2,Wed Jul 1 18:35:08 2015 UTC,"His advanced stats are good and his linemates tend to score more when he's on the ice than his own points indicate, so he might be somewhat of an anti-Clarkson playmaker. (Source: not thrilled to see him go)"
Habs,3brzxq,smopecakes,2,Wed Jul 1 19:03:09 2015 UTC,Exact opposite. He usually ended up playing with unskilled guys that couldn't do anything when he gave them the puck.

Habs,3brzxq,theres__no_time,2,Wed Jul 1 18:11:58 2015 UTC,"It's not, unless there's something about Kassian we don't know.  I don't know why anyone would have problems with this."
Habs,3brzxq,Fenrir,2,Wed Jul 1 18:20:49 2015 UTC,Emotional reaction. I loved Prust as a player and rep for the team and the city but he's served his time and this is a business.
Habs,3brzxq,theres__no_time,2,Wed Jul 1 18:24:42 2015 UTC,Sure. Prust is fun. I'm sure Kassian is a swell guy too.
Habs,3brzxq,Fenrir,2,Wed Jul 1 18:28:19 2015 UTC,"Friedman misspoke. Yell at him.  And meh, I liked Prust's place on the team, but yeah Canucks seem even madder about this trade, so it's probably a good one."
Habs,3brzxq,DisgruntledPorcupine,2,Wed Jul 1 18:29:55 2015 UTC,Kassian + 5 round for Brandon Prust It sucks to lose Prust.
Habs,3brzxq,fred_flag,2,Wed Jul 1 18:25:09 2015 UTC,Although Prust has been at the heart of this team for a while we save money and get almost the same player back with maybe more offensive upside. I am fine with this deal.
Habs,3brzxq,tinran,2,Wed Jul 1 18:16:47 2015 UTC,"It's for Prust and a fifth. We save money and Kassian is maybe a little better offensively. Not a bad deal.  Edit: Oops, we get the fifth. Even better."

However Kassian is younger, faster, cheaper and more offensively gifted than Prust.  And we get a fifth too.  It's hard to argue with that kind of return."

Habs,3brqb7,MustardTiger1337,3,Wed Jul 1 20:07:49 2015 UTC,"Maybe you are purposely wearing bleu blanc et rouge tinted glasses but Hamilton was a player to rebuild around. They had the money to resign him but they were worried an offer sheet would come so they traded him. Other issues came up in this as well.  Saad wanted to be a Blackhawk, it's been popping up all over the place that he didn't want to leave. Blackhawks had the money to re-sign and were working towards that if Saad's agent hadn't done what he did.   My point is that Chucky, or someone else may force their hand. If another team gives money and commits to giving him better minutes in a better position. Does MB really want to Ryan O'Reilly himself by matching an overpaying contract like Calgary forced Colorado to do? It would hurt future efforts for the team and hurt current relations with the team. You may not like what I write but it's a possibility that has happened in the past with other teams."

Habs,3bsine,Funkenbrain,2,Wed Jul 1 20:51:19 2015 UTC,I'm surprised the Leafs didn't give Kessel a chance to play for Babcock. He really could've made Kessel into a much better player.
Habs,3bsine,pm27,2,Wed Jul 1 21:37:29 2015 UTC,Crosby and Malkin will make Kessel a better player. You saw what having a good C did for Kessel in the last Olympics. Ask Pacioretty. Sorry to see Kessel go....we will miss him. Until the Leafs make the playoffs....Go PENS!!!!
Habs,3bsine,TazzyGurl1,1 point,Thu Jul 2 00:53:08 2015 UTC,"You're right about that. I think this trade will go down as one of the most lopsided, unless at least two of the prospects pan out. Kessel could have a 100 point season next year."

Habs,3bsine,Lost_Downtown,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:12:26 2015 UTC,Kapanen is a stud in the making. Got to watch him in the AHL Penguins development and he made opponents look ridiculous at times.  At the moment the Pens won the trade though.
Habs,3bsine,mbean12,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:48:24 2015 UTC,"This... this trade makes no sense.  The Leafs got very low value for one of the better offensive wingers in the game.  The Penguins have essentially hamstrung themselves with salary - they have 38 million tied up in five players (Crosby, Malkin, Kessel, Letang and Fleury) and have six million in change now to fill five roster spots (four forwards and a goalie) at a minimum (they are currently at eight forwards, six defensemen and one goalie).  That's 1.2 million per player - enough for the (backup) goalie, I guess, but that means four Erik Condra level players to fill out at forward.  And that leaves them at the cap with no wiggle room and no spare players.  If we assume two extra players (a forward and a blueliner) and a million in spare cap space you get 757,000 for Hallischuk's, Diaz's and McElhinney's.  Something else has to happen in Pittsburgh.  Is Malkin in play?  Letang?  Not likely, but I don't know if people are going to be lining up to acquire an aging Kunitz or Dupuis..."
Habs,3bsine,mr_potroast,2,Wed Jul 1 23:19:38 2015 UTC,Maybe they buy out one of those guys? Dupuis hasn't been able to to stay on the ice the last few year? Or maybe they trade and keep some of the salary?
Habs,3bsine,mbean12,2,Thu Jul 2 00:30:56 2015 UTC,"Can they buy anyone out now?  I thought buyouts had to be done before the FA period.    As for trades - like I said Malkin or Letang could be in play.  The other guys are maybes - is anyone going to want Kunitz or Dupuis?  Perron and Sutter might be more attractive to buyers but they don't buy the same kind of room and won't net much of a return.    Could be interesting times in Pittsburgh.  I really hope if Malkin is in play that MB is working the phones like mad.  There's not much I wouldn't give up for Malkin (Price, Subban, Pacioretty...)"
Habs,3bsine,MacerV,-1,Thu Jul 2 01:25:49 2015 UTC,Yeah...I'm not sure I trust the current management with trades anymore.
Habs,3bsine,Cookedmonkey,3,Wed Jul 1 20:11:10 2015 UTC,"You were never gonna get much more than a 1st for Kessel, you were sellers and there isn't many buyers at that price range. I know you would of liked to keep him but he would of just gone down in value."

Habs,3bsine,Cookedmonkey,3,Thu Jul 2 02:57:21 2015 UTC,"Of course, hes a top 10 goal scorer in my opinion, anyone would be silly not to want him. But hes most valuable now, and best you start a full rebuild so you can look like the sabres soon!"
Habs,3bsine,TazzyGurl1,0,Thu Jul 2 12:04:14 2015 UTC,just look at our prospects. I'm not worried! No pain...no gain!
Habs,3bsine,MacerV,1 point,Thu Jul 2 01:04:28 2015 UTC,The gain was a little lack luster. Keeping the 2nd or going after another prospect would have been a good idea. I think getting Matt Murray out of Pittsburgh would have been a possibility and if we need to throw in a B lvl winger prospect so be it.
Habs,3bsine,TazzyGurl1,0,Thu Jul 2 01:10:48 2015 UTC,I am lumping the prospects we got at the draft in with the ones we got for Phil. I wish we could have gotten more for him or maybe waited a while. Babcock said it would be painful. Wait til the season starts.

Hero Chart: http://i.imgur.com/V93PrtM.png  Ultimately, I think Tlusty's greatest benefit is functioning as a cheaper finishing forward on a line with a bonafide possession-driving player, like a Bergeron, Datsyuk, Kesler, et al.  I'm not sure the Habs should commit to as much money & term as Tlusty might command. That being said, the Habs need finishers up front, as they currently have only the one in Pacioretty (with a hat-tip to Gallagher). Desharnais is a possession-driving forward, believe it or not, who desperately needs a finishing winger. Perhaps the two of them could form two-thirds of a solid scoring line."

Habs,3bpzvr,MonumentalMyth,17,Wed Jul 1 05:32:58 2015 UTC,"Lars Eller can play the powerplay for sure, he will actually shoot the puck unlike DD and he has a pretty good one-timer that usually hits the net, you know like this or this.   About the usual ""Eller has no vision"": It seems like people don't watch the games. How many passes did Eller make for Prust/Weise or any other of his usual grinding linemates that could have been a goal? Plenty. Eller is a kind of guy, who will do whatever it takes to fill out his role, so right now he is a perfect 3rd line center, but he has never been giving a consistent chance on the 1st/2nd line with decent line-members."
Habs,3bpzvr,rembot,6,Wed Jul 1 08:54:38 2015 UTC,"yeah, i dont see why people dont complain about prust more on this sub. how many times has he gotten a break away or solid chance and just fucked it up?"

Habs,3bpzvr,Funkenbrain,0,Thu Jul 2 02:24:11 2015 UTC,Eller got a tunnel vision. If you are in front of him he will see you and make a great pass. If you are on his side he will have no clue and things happen like offside or whatever.
Habs,3bpzvr,EricLapointe,7,Wed Jul 1 19:14:06 2015 UTC,"Yes, a successful NHL player can magically not see to his sides. Do you people even listen to yourselves?"
Habs,3bpzvr,Fenrir,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:42:41 2015 UTC,"he cannot see to his sides. Do you think every players who made it to the nhl has no flaws?  Eller is good at face offs, good at hitting, makes good passes on the tape (if he sees you) have good positioning, sound defensively and have a good shot. But he can't see to his sides.  He understands hockey tho. So if he plays with a north south type of guy (gally, Weiss, prust, dsp) he can guess where they are but he won't see creative guys unless they are right in front of him just watch him play you will see. He is doing so many things tight, there is a reason he is not one of the best centers of the nhl."

Habs,3bpzvr,Fenrir,-2,Fri Jul 3 03:17:12 2015 UTC,"Eller is a grinder, so he does fit in with a grinder line. Just look at the 2v1s where he handles the puck, he never passes or shoots, but drives it behind the net. That's what he's most comfortable doing, taking it to the boards."
Habs,3bpzvr,SonofMustachio,25,Wed Jul 1 15:46:25 2015 UTC,I'd honestly love to replace DD with Eller on the PP. I think Eller has a lot more potential than what he's being used for.

I don't think Eller is the answer for a good teams top 6 or Powerplay personally, but I'd be ecstatic if I was wrong.    Personally I think Eller is the exact kind of 3rd line center that good teams have, and that's all I expect from him.  Defensively sound, and good for 30 or so points with below average linemates.  I think he could be a 40 pointish center with average linemates and I'm happy with that."

If he's a top 6 player, then it's really nice, if he's not... well he will be our 3rd center again.  I feel that if a team relies on Eller as an offensive production, this team is in major trouble"
Habs,3bpzvr,Gabroux,2,Wed Jul 1 13:35:15 2015 UTC,I would love to see that! He's a great player and I want him to get some more playing time
Habs,3bpzvr,omlette1,2,Wed Jul 1 13:01:21 2015 UTC,We should try him on a more offensive capacity. Especially now that we have Waldemar de la Rose in the fold for defensive assignment.  But we know it's not gonna happen.......
Habs,3bpzvr,jo_maka,2,Wed Jul 1 13:40:53 2015 UTC,"The issues with the PP are not going to be solved by mixing up the players. If the team can't score with Patches, Plekanec, DD, Galchenyuk, Subban and Markov, Lars Eller is not going to fix the problem.  The problem with the power play is the coaching. I couldn't find the exact quotation, but I'm relatively certain that Bruce Boudreau said something to that effect at the end of the season. And so, the Ducks fired their PP coach. Do we even know who's coaching our PP? Suppose it doesn't matter, seeing as how MB said he's super cool with our coaching staff as is.  Go compare our top forwards to Detroit's, who actually had a good coach. At even strength our top forwards have more goals and generate slightly more shots. Detroit doesn't have an obviously superior top 6 to ours, especially not with their two best players getting older. But Detroit crushed it on the power play and so ended the season with significantly more goals than us.   The PP and shot suppression are the two biggest knocks against Therrien, as far as I'm concerned."

All depends on who has a good camp. Could also be a signing (Frolik?)   Third line looks solid with our oldest player on it being Eller.

Habs,3bngy6,bsaures,3,Tue Jun 30 20:04:54 2015 UTC,Would only work if we have a goal scorer in the empty spot. A guy like patch who shoots before passing. Because with DD and Pleky as center and lw we can't afford having another playmaker/all around guy on that line. We need someone who'll put it in when the other 2 set up a play.   I really wish we could've signed vrbata last year he'd be such a perfect fit it's ridiculous
Habs,3bngy6,Batmarde,2,Tue Jun 30 20:08:42 2015 UTC,DD showed playing with eller he will shoot while not playing centre with patches. Another shoot first player would  be  good though. Or this is a bit outside the box put dsp on the line and have a more shutdown line and keep the icetime close to ellers line. Put sherbak on ellers line and give them some decent offe sive mins and we should have 3 lines that can generate offense.

JDLR is a great guy to hope around the line up in a time of need.

Habs,3bngy6,Doc460,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:42:09 2015 UTC,A DSP DLR Eller third line is definitely able to score some good grinding goals. Both Eller and DSP are great at battling along the boards   It'll probablt be weise Mitchell prust with Flynn as 13th skater for injuries or if prust weise or Mitchell have a couple off games.
Habs,3bngy6,Batmarde,2,Tue Jun 30 19:49:46 2015 UTC,"Eller is a great 3rd liine center, for sure.   DSP has produced shots and goals for at a 4th line rate, and thats with time seen with solid guys.   I like JDLR's defensive game, but I really don't see scoring from him.   If we get strong scoring guys like Boyes or Frolik on our 2nd and third lines, I'd be happy. Or let kids try their hand. But either way, I don't see the grinders we have losing their place."
Habs,3bngy6,Doc460,4,Tue Jun 30 19:55:04 2015 UTC,DLR was 19. DSP had to adapt to a new system and new team. I'm fairly sure all three of these guys can put out 30 point seasons if they don't get injured or anything.
Habs,3bngy6,Batmarde,2,Tue Jun 30 19:57:04 2015 UTC,DLR never had a big offensive skill set. And DSP has never really produced at a strong level in the NHL with the exception of a few times when he rode with Getzlaf and Perry
Habs,3bngy6,Doc460,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:01:34 2015 UTC,"Exactly, you have to make the Bottom 6 players compete against each other so that they give everything they have every single shifts."

Habs,3bngy6,papercutssc2,4,Tue Jun 30 17:46:20 2015 UTC,"I don't disagree with adding depth for cheap, except in this team where we have a coach that always overplays these role players while not developing the young talent at all. This needs to be the year we see what angrighetto, bournival, Thomas and Hudson are made of."
Habs,3bngy6,hurray4kimchi,31,Tue Jun 30 17:12:02 2015 UTC,"Hello Broken Record! In the past years we've seen many young guys make their room earlier than expected or pushing away veterans. Gallagher, Galchenyuk, Bournival (2 years ago), De La Rose, Beaulieu, Pateryn.  But hey, let's rail on Therrien. Way easier.  Last year none of Andrighetto, Thomas and Bournival deserved to play more than they did in the NHL last year. I don't expect Thomas and Bournival to do much in the NHL anyway. Hudon, Andrighetto or even Scherbak all have the cards to push veterans aside. It's up to them to make it happen. Others did in the past."
Habs,3bngy6,Fabien_Lamour,3,Tue Jun 30 18:18:00 2015 UTC,Seriously. I hate Therrien and even I get really annoyed when people cherrypick like that.
Habs,3bngy6,DisgruntledPorcupine,7,Tue Jun 30 20:31:18 2015 UTC,"I'm paying less attention to this sub now. I'm starting to hate the vocal fan base of our beloved team, either French or English, in here and on r/hockey. What used to be the French fans Koivu bashing is now the English fans Desharnais-Therrien ass-raping.  Although I'm not Therrien's biggest fan, the guy has a great record with the Habs. Noone can say that the team hasn't improved since Bergevin took office and Therrien, so far, is part of his plan.  The future of the bleu-blanc-rouge franchise seems bright to me. I like how we are building on character, how great we are at drafting and I love our team's core. I don't get it when I see all the hate on this sub."
Habs,3bngy6,BrutalRamen,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:22:08 2015 UTC,I don't think it's as bad in r/hockey. Having other fanbases give an outside look helps imo. Seen a lot of other teams fans defending emelin and saying DD is a solid player.

This and the love for unproven youngters instead of supposedly overpaid veterans. A guy like Thomas will probably never be a regular NHLer, here or elsewhere, but it seems some people want Therrien to use him on the 2nd line. And obviously there are a bunch of other exemples."

Habs,3bngy6,ClassActDude,-6,Tue Jun 30 21:24:28 2015 UTC,"You know your right. Having DD getting all the prime minutes, bumping wiese up to the 1st line while burying Eller with shit line mates all season instead of actually giving the young guys a chance. What a great coach man, benching Tinordi after one mistake yet keeping Boullion at 18-20 per game.   He doesn't develop shit. Thomas deserved a spot, Bournival got shit minutes and terrible responsibilities like DLR. Beaulieu took over a year longer than it should have and even now he gets shit minutes. It took several injuries before Pateryn even got a shot and then got pulled.   Our coach clearly favours grinders and vets over our young skill. It's so unbelievably clear. If you can see that you are beyond a lost cause."
Habs,3bngy6,vonwarewolf,12,Tue Jun 30 19:31:50 2015 UTC,"Any NHL coach would favor a guy like DD who puts up 50 point seasons for 3 years now and defensively safe veterans for the 4th line.   And say what you want about Weise but he was way more consistent than Thomas, Bournivalr or Andrighetto. The only rookie that deserved to stay was DLR because he's an amazing two way forward at that age."
Habs,3bngy6,Batmarde,6,Tue Jun 30 19:48:38 2015 UTC,All of the players you listed are average at best in the AHL and you want them in important roles in the NHL. Common man get real.
Habs,3bngy6,theres__no_time,-1,Tue Jun 30 19:54:40 2015 UTC,And you know this because you've seen them in that situation?   But I suppose Dale Wiese belongs up there too?
Habs,3bngy6,vonwarewolf,9,Tue Jun 30 19:59:58 2015 UTC,Thomas : 1 goal in 18 nhl games 22 points in 52 ahl games -12  Weise : 29 points in 79 games +21  Yeah Thomas isn't gonna fix the team and put up a 15+ goal season
Habs,3bngy6,Batmarde,4,Tue Jun 30 20:05:27 2015 UTC,"Christian Thomas NHL linemates --> 4th liners.  Dale Weise NHL linemates, DD & Patches , Pleks & Patches for long stints produced 22 points with those linemates.  I'm not saying I disagree with you, but those 2 players were in wildly different situations when they played for the Habs."
Habs,3bngy6,A_WHALES_VAG,2,Tue Jun 30 21:04:21 2015 UTC,"I know but if you check TOI/G Weise has only played 3 more minutes than Thomas. It's also less time than prust, bourque and even Sekac."
Habs,3bngy6,Batmarde,2,Tue Jun 30 21:19:24 2015 UTC,"Quality of linemates man. It was the same with Andrieghetto, guy plays 2 games gets 1g 2a on a 2nd line setting, starts his third game this season and is on the 4th produces like crap next game sent to Hamilton.  I'm not disagreeing with you but putting a player who has never played that role in Hockey their entire lives then expecting them to succeed in that role when their skillset is clearly not designed for it is a recipe for developmental nightmares and horrible numbers.  If and when Andrieghetto/Scherbak/Hudon make their appearances they need to be put into roles where their skill sets can shine I.E with other likeminded/creative players, it's not always about raw numbers TOI/G or PPG .. It's about personnel deployment. Put players where they are more likely to succeed based on how they've played all their life.  I.E Don't but Scherbak on a line with Prust and Mitchell because he is young and inexperienced, it just won't work.  You wouldn't put a blood hound in a race vs grey hounds. You wouldn't bring a grey hound to a hunt."
Habs,3bngy6,A_WHALES_VAG,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:27:06 2015 UTC,You make it sound like Weise only scored when playing with first liners. He actually had a decent production anywhere he was.
Habs,3bngy6,Fabien_Lamour,2,Wed Jul 1 04:19:07 2015 UTC,Bingo. You can't expect a small scorer to succeed as a grinder.
Habs,3bngy6,vonwarewolf,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:19:56 2015 UTC,Hoping our young guns step up and Flynn ends up being used as a trade piece later in the season. At least they got him cheap.

Habs,3bngy6,Gabroux,3,Tue Jun 30 18:26:05 2015 UTC,"He's a grinder. They seem a little too obsessed with those - Mitchell, Flynn, Weise, Prust and DSP. One wonders why people bash Eller for not producing when he's always stuck with boat anchors on his wings"
Habs,3bngy6,paul_33,5,Tue Jun 30 18:43:56 2015 UTC,"I beleive that Weise and DSP can give us 30-35 pts next season, which is fine for bottom 6 players, also DLR should give us more pts than last year. People seem to forget that he was only 19 years old"
Habs,3bqxac,Batalar10,3,Wed Jul 1 12:50:17 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately his breakout year wasn't even that great - statistically speaking.  In 12-13, he put up 15 goals, but still only mustered a CF% of 49%.  Additionally, he had a PDO of 104 and a shooting % of 16.5%!  Those kinds of numbers (specifically the PDO and shooting percentage), as evidenced by his PD regressing to 100/96 and shot% to 11/7 over 13-14/14-15 seasons.  If you look at the charts below it paints a middling picture.  Playing  2nd line minutes, he's all over the page for production, and effect on line-mates.  He improved some this past season in terms of being a 'good linemate'.  But I think we don't need more ""this guy might do something for us if he has a good season"".

I can see how MB would have had trouble clearing cap space, not being able to trade PAP probably put the nail in the coffin (I bet MB was trying to get a pick for him at the draft). Also would be hard to come up with the payment for Saad without killing our future - I bet the Hawks would have insisted on a Scherbak/McCarron/Andrighetto/etc and we're already short on draft picks next year.  Also makes sense that Versteeg was considered as part of a larger bundle somewhere during the discussions (the actual trade involved 7 players)"

Habs,3bmugc,hkycoach,21,Tue Jun 30 14:22:53 2015 UTC,"Well written and researched. I agree. We aren't exploiting young players on cheap contracts. Best way to extract value out of players.   We're in a weird place where Bergevin says we're in transition, but our coach wants to play it safe with veterans and a risk averse system. We treat making the playoffs as the achievement, when we have the best goalie in the league on a great contract, a thirty goal scorer on arguably the best contract in the NHL, and a perennial Norris candidate.   We have to push young players to succeed, not insulate them. Playing it safe isn't getting this team anywhere fast."
Habs,3bmugc,dearyleary,13,Tue Jun 30 16:46:50 2015 UTC,"Of course they need a new mentality. Look at teams like Tampa bay, they represent something we could be. If you are not the big, scary team, be fast. Make the opposite team run after you. Dont rely on 1-0 or 2-1 games almost every game."

It's a disaster area of FA pickups and players that have fallen out of his favor.  Unfortunately, and I think the author nailed it, Therrien thinks he's close to a cup, so he's not going to change what he's doing.  I can only hope that MB starts moving guys like PAP, like Emelin, for nothing; for picks, I don't care; just something that is going to force Therrien to play the lineup that will help us in the long-run.

The point about Beaulieu could look better, if the author didn't totally overlooked the fact that it's his first complete season in the NHL.  Thomas posted Elite numbers in scoring chances in 18 games, talk about sample size. You know what else he did in 18 games? One point.  And I could go on and on... I'm not the biggest Therrien fan myself, but this is really cherrypicking statistics. I think MB is trying to build a team that can win year after year after year, not just that one time. He's learned from the bests in Chicago and I think we can trust him with that."

The problem then is do we have DD as a winger and if so then that might be an issue because that line would be pretty small.

Habs,3braq7,ghostfan9,21,Sat Jul 4 17:54:32 2015 UTC,I'm so sick of this Emelin circlejerk. Is he our best D? No. Is his contract great? No. Is he a disaster-on-ice? No.
Habs,3braq7,MessageBoard,-6,Wed Jul 1 15:10:39 2015 UTC,The hilarious part is this subreddit comes in and defends DD as if he were their brother. A player MUCH worse in his role than Emelin.
Habs,3braq7,BrutalRamen,10,Wed Jul 1 15:50:38 2015 UTC,"Wait wtf are you saying, this subreddit shits on DD. There is not one thread where someone does not whine about DD and/or Therrien. Including this one. Both Emelin and Desharnais are not the crappy players this sub portrait them to be."
Habs,3braq7,Fenrir,2,Wed Jul 1 16:31:22 2015 UTC,DD is an ok player used poorly. Emelin is just not very good.
Habs,3braq7,Fenrir,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:51:23 2015 UTC,Measured how? DD meets expectations better than Emelin does.

Habs,3braq7,Gabroux,2,Wed Jul 1 15:56:55 2015 UTC,Well he played with Paccioretty most of the time.... of course he will get o-zone starts
Habs,3braq7,SonofMustachio,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:59:45 2015 UTC,Who's second? Pacioretty. I wonder why someone would dare use those 2 players in the offensive zone. It doesn't make any sense!
Habs,3braq7,Batmarde,0,Wed Jul 1 20:16:36 2015 UTC,Do we need to explain again how it doesn't mean shit? Our other centers at the moment are Mitchell Eller and Pleky. All 3 really good at face-offs and as two-way forwards. Why would we start dd in our own zone if we can start these 3 other guys instead.
Habs,3braq7,SiegeWar,-7,Wed Jul 1 17:24:00 2015 UTC,"Alright, yes, he's an NHL defenseman.  He's a physical player, but he's a liability - particularly in our Top-4.  I also tend to lump his contract in with him, which is just bad for a player who should be a 3rd pairing at half the cost."
Habs,3braq7,Julien_fucke_bouzzin,13,Wed Jul 1 15:16:54 2015 UTC,"Emelin   Is a disaster-on-ice, I'm not saying any more.  This is completely wrong"
Habs,3braq7,Fenrir,0,Wed Jul 1 14:53:30 2015 UTC,"I dont get your point of view on this one. Many times in arguments , you used the advanced stats to show how a player is misused or how MT run a bad system, while emelin dont have good advanced stats but you still value him. I dont checked advanced stats every time i evaluate a player because sometime things are obvious. Obvious like when emelin is on the ice, its almost an impossibilty to get the puck out of the zone, when emelin is on the ice we are more often then not we are bottled up in the zone giving up multiple scoring chances. Just in case your eye test failed you , here is his official stats http://www.nhl.com/stats/enhancedstats?season=20142015&gameType=2&team=MTL&position=D&country=&status=&viewName=advancedStatsSkaterShooting&sort=&ord=&gp=1   You will notice that his stats are sucking balls deep when the score is tied or when we are ahead, which is dangerous to display a player like that on the ice to get the W.  Edit: i forgot i was on r/habs and anything that isnt criticizing MT , DD or claiming that Eller is a superstar backed up with some habs eye on the prize garbage analysis by some ""i know everything"" GMs and coaches that never been close to be in the pros authors with cherry picking stats is considered as shit and should be downvoted."
Habs,3braq7,quadriplegic_cheetah,-4,Wed Jul 1 15:13:17 2015 UTC,He's horrible!  Any time he gets the puck in the D-Zone only leaves by dumping it into the NZ.  Show me any relevant stat that he's above average in.  Head over to war-on-ice and look at his Shot Rate Against with/without - we're better off without him every where in the zone.
Habs,3braq7,theres__no_time,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:04:07 2015 UTC,"This is 100% correct.   And don't stop at on ice/off ice shot rate. Do it for Fenwick or Corsi or High Danger Chances too. Check out his time on the PK if it makes you happy. Adjust for zone starts, teammates and competition, no matter how you slice it he's not very good.  That's not to say that he's bad defensively in the traditional sense. But his inability to clear the zone means that we have to play more defense when he's on the ice."

Habs,3braq7,habsdane,9,Sat Jul 4 01:04:07 2015 UTC,"How is removing 3 role players cleaning house exactly?  The habs finished with 110 points last year and made it to game 6 of the 2nd round against the team that went to the finals. (And in my opinion played them pretty damn close) Did they rely heavily on price? Yes. Does that mean they are a bad team? No. People act like last year was a disaster and they need a new ""mentality"" and to ""clean house"". To me this is nothing more than alarmist overreacting that is so common with habs fans that it makes discussing the team a chore.  Sorry for the rant. Happy Canada day  Edit: I would honestly be fine with them doing nothing until trade deadline. None of the ufa bring what we really need. A scoring winger."
Habs,3braq7,habsdane,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:33:44 2015 UTC,"I agree with your edit...   I'm in favor of doing nothing over picking up one of the FA's this year.  The reason why I called it a ""house cleaning"" is that I feel that because of their experience our ""role players"" are put into roles that they don't fit into.  Like when Weise/DSP were put up on the 1st line.    I really just want to see the role players play in their role, and see the prospects come into more and better opportunities.  But I get the feeling that Therrien isn't going to give them those chances unless we clear out the existing role players."

He's got potential upside, but the dude is one of the most frustrating players I've ever watched. The ""lazy"" label has some truth to it, not to mention (when he was with the Caps, anyway) he took quite a few pretty awful penalties. The joke in D.C. was calling their penalty box ""The Sasha Box"" for a reason."

Habs,3bn96b,HanshinFan,0,Tue Jun 30 17:25:38 2015 UTC,"I'd love it if we could get him for a year at $3M. With Markov to mentor him and playing on a line with Pacioretty he could really be a threat. He's still got insane skill.  That said, someone will offer him way more than that, for sure, and he's not worth the risk that goes with a big contract. I really doubt we get him."
Habs,3bn96b,Fabien_Lamour,7,Tue Jun 30 16:19:45 2015 UTC,"He's 31 years old, he doesn't need mentoring. He's Kostitsyn 2.0."
Habs,3bn96b,HanshinFan,4,Tue Jun 30 16:30:07 2015 UTC,"If he's 31 and acts 21, he could use a mentor. A change in environment might wake him up. For the right price, I wouldn't mind having him around. You can't teach that wrist shot."
Habs,3bn96b,theres__no_time,5,Tue Jun 30 17:16:56 2015 UTC,"Because WSH and CAR had no one to mentor him? At 31 if he's not able to play consistently with conviction, he will not magically gain it by playing with Markov."

Habs,3biuoy,thehabsnerd,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:22:12 2015 UTC,That's probably the only thing that may help him.  He just doesn't battle at all.  He has some offensive upside... some.  Always recovering from something doesn't help in the quest to earn a roster spot either.

Maybe lock him down for more than a simple bridge, or to just give us more flexibility after his contract is signed.  2) The 'youth movement' that you mentioned.  My concern is that with the youth movement - who moves into the 2nd line role with Pleks/Chucky?    The options appear to be (in no particular order):   Andrighetto DSP Scherbak Thomas Weise   Of those, the only one I see filling the role is Andrighetto, but I don't think Therrien will put him out there, he'll favor putting DSP up there to bring some physicality to the line.

Habs,3biz9j,televisionceo,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:03:39 2015 UTC,"I think it's fair value for him but it's too much for us. If he loves Montreal soo much, maybe he'll take less. Who knows, maybe he didn't want to play in Winnipeg anymore and declined their offer solely on that reason.  Actually, we could sign him at 5mill and still re-sign Galchenyuk. But we won't have enough cap space in the likelihood we have an injury and need to get another player. I don't think we'll sign him for 5mill. But we can fit him, we'll just be very tight on money if we do."
Habs,3biz9j,zeMVK,4,Mon Jun 29 17:56:55 2015 UTC,Will have to settle for 2.4 and like it.

Habs,3bl5d2,fatneszsebby,5,Wed Jul 1 22:21:08 2015 UTC,"He would fit, but Emelin isn't going anywhere. He is a solid 2nd line dman."
Habs,3bl5d2,GibierJaune,0,Tue Jun 30 03:19:07 2015 UTC,Let me strongly disagree. Putting Emelin on the ice basically means we're gonna spent the next 30 sec or so in our own end.  Edit: http://www.habseyesontheprize.com/2015/1/26/7908619/is-it-time-to-say-goodbye-to-alexei-emelin
Habs,3bl5d2,slayeryouth,2,Tue Jun 30 10:23:01 2015 UTC,"Maybe that's what some people want from a defence man?  ""Hey, it's called defence so you need to be in the defensive zone to play it!""  Otherwise I can't figure out how anybody could think Emelin's particularly good at it, much less top 4 calibre."
Habs,3bl5d2,GibierJaune,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:50:08 2015 UTC,I'd rather have a player that can't play D but always brings the puck in the O zone than an excellent defender that can't get out of his end.
Habs,3bl5d2,slayeryouth,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:15:30 2015 UTC,"Even if he can't clear the zone, it would be nice if he could suppress shots and scoring chances, you know, like a defenceman is supposed to do.  He's got an alright shot and throw big hits, but if the situation doesn't call for either of those things he's like a lost puppy."
Habs,3bl5d2,Gabroux,2,Tue Jun 30 23:03:52 2015 UTC,"Not really, I don't think that the Habs defence was as bad as people made it. Just that since our offence could not keep the puck in O-Zone, they had a lot to do"

If we do sign him, we'll definitely have to trade Emelin at the very least, that might be difficult with his NTC and teams that will most likely see our defense overabundance+cap situation.  I guess we could try, just to piss off the Lightning. But I don't see it working out."

Habs,3bk8tx,HanshinFan,3,Mon Jun 29 22:47:45 2015 UTC,That'd be a good reason to give Quebec a team.
Habs,3bk8tx,ExtraCunt,2,Tue Jun 30 00:41:33 2015 UTC,"I don't think so. The contract is a tie-in with Rogers and was done before Quebecor could acquire any team. The contract has to be honored. If Quebecor somehow become shareholders of the Habs and not just the broadcasters, then we might have a problem."
Habs,3bk8tx,jo_maka,2,Mon Jun 29 22:50:54 2015 UTC,"Problem is TVA Sports have all National coverage which means Saturday games, special games, playoff games and events. The deal will stand even if Quebecor owns the Nordiques. Rogers (SN) and Bell (TSN) are both part owners of the Maple Leafs, and it does not seem to give problems to anyone really. Worst case scenario, TVA Sports is biaised on the Nordiques side, but TSN//SN already does it for the Maple Leafs, so nothing new here.  Also TVA Sports have 2 channels, so they can play both Nordiques and Habs games on Saturday.   Would I prefer RDS to have all the games, yes. Will it happen? No"

Habs,3bogak,HammerOfTheSlobs,11,Wed Jul 1 00:18:45 2015 UTC,"He would have looked good in Montreal, but how would we fit him in the cap? He's apparently looking for over $6M/yr on a long-term deal. It's not like we could trade salary back to Chicago to make space seeing as cap space was their issue. It would have been nice, but it was never going to happen no matter who the GM was."
Habs,3bogak,HabsJD,-15,Tue Jun 30 21:28:41 2015 UTC,"Emelin and DD gone, gilbert too. We could have made it work  Edit: downvotes for suggesting we could dump DD, Emelin and Gilbert in order to clear cap space and acquire a player, Sharp from Chicago has a large 5.9 cap hit as well, we would need to clear some to acquire him too or any other high calibre player."
Habs,3bogak,ClassActDude,9,Tue Jun 30 21:59:59 2015 UTC,"Gone where? DD's contract isn't bad for what he provides, I don't see us getting rid of him, besides Saad would be almost double the cap hit for 15-20 more points if he continues to progress and doesn't just stagnate - in which case we'd be almost doubling the cap hit for the same production. Emelin's contract is bad for the role he's going to be playing now that Beaulieu is likely moving up, but he's got a no trade clause and his contract isn't all that much more attractive to anyone else. Gilbert's fine for a third pairing guy and his contract isn't outrageous, not to mention trading him likely wouldn't free up enough to sign Saad plus the other FA's we need to get locked up.  Our bad contracts were basically Emelin and PAP. PAP is taken care of, but Emelin is hard to move and we're not going to buy him out and have a further reduced cap for six years."
Habs,3bogak,HabsJD,-2,Tue Jun 30 22:43:46 2015 UTC,"I believe Emelin could be moved, same with Gilbert. Together they would clear 6.9M."
Habs,3bogak,ClassActDude,6,Tue Jun 30 22:49:50 2015 UTC,"Moving a guy with a NTC isn't that easy, dude. You're acting like MB didn't even try, when neither you or I know anything about his wheeling and dealing so far this off season. For all we know, the only offers he got would have hurt us."
Habs,3bogak,comeupoutdawatah,0,Tue Jun 30 23:57:30 2015 UTC,"I think Emelin would waive his NTC if MB had a deal in place, he would know he isn't wanted by the organization. Yes he could veto a trade but look at Gorges, he said no and then still got traded to another team."
Habs,3bogak,ClassActDude,4,Wed Jul 1 01:11:56 2015 UTC,"First you've got to find a trading partner willing to take on these contracts without sending contracts back our way. There's not a lot of teams in that situation, and I would be surprised if there are any out there that can do that, want Emelin, and that Emelin would waive his NTC to go to.  IF you do find a team meeting these criteria and you make the trade, you're then relying on the assumption that Beaulieu, Pateryn, and Tinordi are ready to play every day in the 4, 5, 6 slot on defense. And if we lose a defenseman to injury, who then steps up?"
Habs,3bogak,HabsJD,1 point,Wed Jul 1 00:07:34 2015 UTC,"I do personally believe those three can fill those roles. I think Tinordi is more than ready to play. Number 7 can be anyone, perhaps Beauchemin or Nygren could join the team."
Habs,3bogak,ClassActDude,1 point,Wed Jul 1 01:10:22 2015 UTC,"I think there's a good chance that those three are ready to play every day, but I'm not sure enough to bet the whole season on it. Emelin is incredibly tough to move, and Gilbert isn't a huge priority to move, so instead of being upset about our only actually bad contract, I prefer to look at them as a safety net, which is nice to have while we move the young guys into the every-day lineup. Maybe trade partners will open up during the season and those guys can be moved if the three young guys prove they're ready."
Habs,3bogak,HabsJD,1 point,Wed Jul 1 01:26:32 2015 UTC,"I agree that Gilbert isn't a bad contract, but that's why it could be easily moved to clear cap in a trade for a top six player, because we have a lot of money tied in our defense. Agree to disagree on when to roll with the young guys but personally I think the time is now for training camp."

Habs,3bk9wb,SiegeWar,5,Mon Jun 29 22:25:30 2015 UTC,"With the way Sweeney is running the ship, Gilbert for Bergeron straight up is realistic.  It would take something like Beaulieu, Chucky, etc. Young talent is probably what they want, though they never seem to hold onto it when they have it, i.e. Kessel, Seguin, Hamilton.  Really, there's no way we could trade for a superstar and make it worth it. We have a good core that gets along well, there's no sense dismantling that."

Habs,3bh6ma,HammerOfTheSlobs,8,Mon Jun 29 11:52:23 2015 UTC,It's a pretty huge reach to go from possible implication (and  I disagree with you that anything can be inferred from Versteeg's quote) to outright stating that he blocked the trade. Particularly when Friedman states he doesn't know why the trade didn't happen.
Habs,3bh6ma,badunkadunk,2,Mon Jun 29 12:05:52 2015 UTC,This is exactly what I was thinking. It explicitly says 'I don't know why the traded didn't happen'. How can you say that implies that Versteeg nixed the deal?
Habs,3bh6ma,NastyKnate,1 point,Mon Jun 29 13:06:57 2015 UTC,"others have reported he vetoed the trade. all hes confirmed is he didnt veto it due to not having an extension. im not sure how he has that power as i dont think hes got a NTC, but thats where were at"
Habs,3bh6ma,bearshiit,18,Mon Jun 29 13:34:25 2015 UTC,Versteeg is garbage. Should thank him for blocking the trade
Habs,3bh6ma,zeMVK,5,Mon Jun 29 05:28:50 2015 UTC,"Meh... I don't buy it. From what I've seen, versteeg doesn't have a no trade clause. The rumor went from Versteeg stopped the trade from happening to it fell through for some reason."

Habs,3beuel,MustardTiger1337,5,Mon Jun 29 01:37:18 2015 UTC,Good PAP always have been an overated player anyway. He can only produce with Tavares and let's be honest a 12 years old kid with one leg could produce with Tavares

Habs,3beuel,Doc460,7,Sun Jun 28 16:56:37 2015 UTC,He was our second best right winger and at the very least a good 3rd liner....
Habs,3beuel,BinaryChode,11,Sun Jun 28 16:26:31 2015 UTC,He was terrible. Absolutely terrible. The only place he looked like an NHLer this season was in the shootout. He came into training camp in possibly the worst shape I've ever seen a pro hockey player. He was slower than Hal Gill and it took him until January to get into decent shape. His game does not translate to the bottom 6 at all either. He's top 6 or bust because he is putrid defensively and not even remotely physical. He can't dump and chase which is a large reason he's ineffective here.  Dale Weise did more with the time he was given in the top 6 than Parenteau did. That should tell you how bad Parenteau was cause Weise is not a top 6 player by any stretch.
Habs,3beuel,Doc460,12,Sun Jun 28 16:37:38 2015 UTC,"No, it should tell me that MT loves Wiesse way too much.  PA's CorsiAgainst per 60 was that of a strong 2nd liner. His dCorsi Against per 60 was roughly -2 (negative is good).   He isn't great. But he is really useful. He certainly is fine defensively. He is CLEARLY better than Wiesse or DSP."
Habs,3beuel,BinaryChode,3,Sun Jun 28 16:42:56 2015 UTC,His corsi was good which resulted in what exactly?
Habs,3beuel,MustardTiger1337,4,Sun Jun 28 16:48:09 2015 UTC,"Being a better possession player than most, so preventing goals against and once his sh% goes back up, I bet he returns to being a decent point producer from that strong possession"
Habs,3beuel,MustardTiger1337,2,Sun Jun 28 18:14:36 2015 UTC,I Know what it means and I like Possesion play as opposed to dump and chase but it really didn't translate to much production from the player. He is 32 on the downside of his career he isn't returning to anything.

Habs,3beuel,Doc460,1 point,Sun Jun 28 17:16:53 2015 UTC,"Parenteau has been a decent NHLer but the fact is that he didn't play that well last season and the season before that.  The only time he's put up more than 30 points was when he was playing with the Islanders with Tavares, which are incidentally the only seasons he played almost every game (excluding the lockout season).  For two seasons in a row he has missed about a quarter of the games due to injury.  Sure Weise had bad possession stats, but he also scored more (P60 1.81) than Parenteau (P60 1.56)  playing less per game with much less offensively favourable zone starts.  For a team that's fairly close to the cap and looking to add pieces the trade-off is more cap room in exchange for giving up a someone that's unlikely, given recent performance, to be much more than a peripheral player.  I'm sure Parenteau was shopped around too which would indicate that no other teams feel that he's worth the money.  $4 million is a lot to pay for a player that is injury-prone and poor defensively."
Habs,3beuel,quadriplegic_cheetah,0,Sun Jun 28 17:27:32 2015 UTC,Honestly I wouldn't say he is better than Wiese.

Habs,3beuel,Phridgey,1 point,Sun Jun 28 18:17:37 2015 UTC,"Well career stats aside (Which is kind of irrelevant) Wiese put up more points, and goals over the playoffs and regular season than Parenteau while playing with weaker line mates on average.

Habs,3beuel,Doc460,1 point,Sun Jun 28 19:03:05 2015 UTC,"You also put up with far worse possesion, and the very real risk that Weise's sh% won't be as good and PAP's will be much better next season"

Habs,3beuel,Doc460,2,Sun Jun 28 19:14:13 2015 UTC,"Yes it does, but the 3 years prior to this year, he has a sh% of 8.87, 14.08, then 12.66. A drop off from that to 5.88 seems very extreme and not likely due entirely to age but also just bad luck"
Habs,3beuel,discoinfiltrator,2,Mon Jun 29 03:29:10 2015 UTC,I'd assume PA's will be better. He'll be in the AHL. Wiese will have to face NHL goalies.
Habs,3beuel,slayeryouth,3,Mon Jun 29 10:44:18 2015 UTC,I watched a lot of hockey. But you can't judge a player just on watching them. Because humans are really bad at judging things from their eyes. That's why we have stats
Habs,3beuel,Doc460,1 point,Sun Jun 28 19:23:53 2015 UTC,And you can't judge a player solely based on a few stats.  The stats don't tell you everything and assuming that a handful of observations is somehow the only true representation of a player's value is false.

Habs,3beuel,Doc460,8,Sun Jun 28 17:07:30 2015 UTC,"PA has a whole career of being a good NHLer. And he was one last year. I'm fine with giving Andrighetto a shot, but not at the expense of the guy who played better than Wiese or DSP"
Habs,3beuel,Funkenbrain,-7,Sun Jun 28 17:11:18 2015 UTC,So you want to pay a guy 4mill to play on the 3rd / 4th line? When he has trouble keeping up on the top 2? Glad your not le coach
Habs,3beuel,eriverside,2,Sun Jun 28 17:22:35 2015 UTC,Who are we going to get for ~2.7 million thats better than a possession driving right winger who normally is a strong point producer?
Habs,3beuel,YellowRiv,1 point,Sun Jun 28 18:23:28 2015 UTC,"That's the real question. Has to be an acquisition, right? If no-one new turns up then this is just a horrible move to clear cap, if we use this space to pay an elite, or at least reliable top-6, winger then maybe it's an improvement.   PAP is/was a good player, but he had a bad year last year, that's undeniable. If he'd stayed, I'd assume the coaches were expecting a rebound. If he's leaving so we can have Sharp, and the coaches don't see recovery, then I'm okay with that.  Fundamentally, PA is not the problem, we know who the problem is."
Habs,3beuel,MacerV,0,Sun Jun 28 16:43:01 2015 UTC,"He gets paid whether or not he plays. So if he's more useful than cheaper players play him anyways, his cap hit is there regardless."
Habs,3beuel,Batmarde,2,Sun Jun 28 16:50:20 2015 UTC,"I don't think most would fit in Therrien's ""system"". The team had a good record but without that guy in the net I think Therrien would be gone in a heartbeat. But what do I know."
Habs,3beuel,TheJustin72,2,Sun Jun 28 17:13:11 2015 UTC,Really that strapped for cash? 1 more year and the contract would be up.
Habs,3beuel,Batmarde,14,Sun Jun 28 17:20:47 2015 UTC,It's about 3 Mil freed up. It's the difference between a 5m free agent and a 8m free agent.   Not saying they'll necessarily sign someone but freeing up space for a player that's not part of your plans is good
Habs,3beuel,quadriplegic_cheetah,-25,Sun Jun 28 17:33:23 2015 UTC,2.6667 is not very much to find a quality top 6 in UFA.  Just another case of terrible asset management that the apologists are spinning as a smart move.  Hilarious.
Habs,3beuel,Cheydabob,9,Sun Jun 28 17:20:10 2015 UTC,... I'm an apologists for stating facts?
Habs,3beuel,zeMVK,4,Sun Jun 28 17:56:18 2015 UTC,It is if you add it to the 4-5 mill we have.
Habs,3beuel,TheJustin72,3,Sun Jun 28 16:19:07 2015 UTC,"And PAP was a quality top 6 player???  Fact is, the Habs have roughly 5 Million in free cap space right now with Galchenyuk, Flynn and Tinordi all to be resigned.   Buying out PAP gives the habs closer to 8 Million.  Leaves some room for them to get all 3 of those guys resigned and still have some options on July 1st.    A buyout is never good asset management in that you are losing some cap space for nothing, but sticking your head into the sand and not acknowledging a mistake can be just as bad.    Habs need cap space, and it's doubtful that anybody would take PAP without getting a draft pick with him.  Similar to how Bergevin got a 5th this year in the Briere for PAP swap."
Habs,3beuel,quadriplegic_cheetah,6,Sun Jun 28 16:27:33 2015 UTC,We are not strapped for cash we must have something in place.
Habs,3beuel,webu,1 point,Sun Jun 28 17:24:20 2015 UTC,"We have a couple RFAs that need to be re-signed, mainly Galchenyuk. I think the cap space freed up allows us to re-sign Chuck and call up at least one of those RFAs. We'd have to trade a contract in order to acquire a new player via trade or UFA."
Habs,3beuel,Muter91,-11,Sun Jun 28 17:46:44 2015 UTC,"Michel probably told him to do it so he just did it.  Something in place?  Lol, have you seen the work Bergevin has done with the forwards in his 3 years?"
Habs,3beuel,webu,2,Sun Jun 28 18:26:33 2015 UTC,"What has he done wrong? We've made the playoffs three straight years, and have some good young talent. I'd say he's done fine."

Habs,3beuel,theres__no_time,6,Sun Jun 28 18:29:06 2015 UTC,"Yes, a player who accumulated 227 points over 347 games in the hyper competitive NHL spent their entire career ""floating.""  Any more nuggets of wisdom you'd like to share?"
Habs,3beuel,hank0,1 point,Sun Jun 28 21:06:34 2015 UTC,"While you are correct that no NHL player with those point totals is a ""floater"", we used to have a player who has 747 points in 1045 games in the hyper competitive NHL, which by the way is a much higher PPG than PAP. Unfortunately, his production fell off a cliff after one season in Montreal and he was eventually bought out. He was criticized far and wide as a ""floater"", when in reality he just wasn't very good anymore.  The problem isn't what PAP has done in the past, its whether he's likely to continue to do those things in the future. Obviously Montreal management and every team he was shopped to think it's not very likely. Personally, I don't think he's a floater, I just don't think he's that good anymore."
Habs,3beuel,MustardTiger1337,1 point,Sun Jun 28 21:23:27 2015 UTC,"And that's fine.   My reaction was specifically to the person calling a 20 goal scorer a ""floater"" which at the NHL level is a bullshit term that people use to describe hockey players when they don't like the way they play."

Habs,3beuel,habuheard,-7,Tue Jun 30 06:02:57 2015 UTC,"Oh my fucking god. What an idiotic move. One year left at four million?! And now 1.33M will count towards the cap for the next two years. What in the fuck. We are saving 2.67M, is that enough to get someone to replace PAP? Doubtful. Guy was jerked around all season, longest he played wit consistent line mates was 12 games and they produced very well. Unless MB makes a move, we have RW depth of Gally, Weise, and DSP. Therrifying."
Habs,3beuel,Doc460,3,Tue Jun 30 13:51:21 2015 UTC,"Off season is just starting though. If that's our RW in October, I'll be worried, but I'd wadger someone else will be added through either trade, UFA or promotion from the AHL. My guess is either Sharp, Frolik, Andrighetto or Scherbak, all of which are upgrades on Parenteau IMO."
Habs,3beuel,slayeryouth,2,Mon Jun 29 05:25:17 2015 UTC,Yeah Sharp and Frolik are absolutely upgrades. Andi and Scherbak are unproven though.
Habs,3beuel,SiegeWar,2,Mon Jun 29 04:36:39 2015 UTC,"Guess management didn't think Parenteau would be able to bounce back.  I was hoping he could since we have poor RW depth after Gallagher and he's not that old but management knows more about his outlook than we do.  He is probably the most expendable player on the team although Gilbert is a close 2nd IMO.  Gilbert is still a solid depth defenseman who could be useful if we were to trade Emelin.  Parenteau, on the other hand, brings almost nothing to the table except a 4mil cap hit especially if he can't bounce back like management thinks."
Habs,3beuel,slayeryouth,2,Mon Jun 29 04:59:08 2015 UTC,"Its not about being retarded (shouldn't use that word in that context though). Its about MB giving in to MT's old school thinking, which is WAYYYYY worse"
Habs,3beuel,Muter91,4,Sun Jun 28 16:57:13 2015 UTC,So basically I'm not the only one expecting MB to pick up some grinder to replace him?  kinda joking but not really.

Habs,3bj751,Corazu,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:25:28 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure PAP had a one way contract, which mean his cap hit was the same for the club in the minors or not.  Regardless, they announced his buyout already so the point is moot."
Habs,3bj751,schmuck55,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:12:00 2015 UTC,"Just FYI, a player's salary is the same in the NHL and AHL if they're on a 1 way deal. Their cap hit is reduced by the minimum NHL salary + 375k (last season that = $925k). So for example, if a player making $2 million gets waived and sent down, he still makes $2 million, but counts for $1,075,000 against the cap."

Habs,3bhaqz,MessageBoard,6,Mon Jun 29 05:43:33 2015 UTC,"Actually he's an RFA, which means we'd have to give up a lot of money to sign him.

Habs,3bhaqz,Captain_Roy,0,Mon Jun 29 05:57:11 2015 UTC,"Arizona has cap room, but not actual $$ to pay salary. Why do you think they took Pronger's contract. Pay $500k for $5mil cap hit, to avoid spending $4.5mil they don't have."
Habs,3bhaqz,djohnston02,1 point,Mon Jun 29 13:00:03 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure that isn't how it works. The player gets paid in full, they just count for less against the cap"

His Average salary over the life of his contract is $5mi, which is the cap hit for every year of the contract.  The flyers also kept $500k of the other guy traded to Arizona with Pronger. So really, the Yotes burn up $5mil in cap room for free."
Habs,3bhaqz,djohnston02,2,Tue Jun 30 04:24:43 2015 UTC,So you want Chucky first C and Eller second C. Where do you get RW with DD and/or Plekanec in your plan?

His biggest problems in Montreal were a low shooting percentage which isn't exactly controllable in as much as on ice shooting percentages tend to vary from season to season but generally regress to the mean, injuries which obviously aren't controllable either, and a lack of consistent line mates to build chemistry with which is controllable, just not by him."

Habs,3bfcls,fatneszsebby,10,Sun Jun 28 18:50:22 2015 UTC,"He's an RFA, which means that if a team make an offer to him, Montreal only needs to match it to keep him. IF they don't match it, Montreal will receive a compensation depending on the salary the other team gave him.  For now, there's no issue with Galchenyuk."
Habs,3bfcls,Gabroux,2,Sun Jun 28 18:57:15 2015 UTC,He still has to accept offer sheets.
Habs,3bfcls,fromage1,1 point,Mon Jun 29 11:59:53 2015 UTC,"Pretty much. To expand other teams can give an offer sheet to Galchenyuk starting July 1st. If a team makes an offer to galchenyuk and he ""accepts"" it,  the Habs can match it and Galchenyuk is signed with a contract equal to that of the hostile offer. If the Habs do not match the offer they will get compensated for it (all of this doesn't apply if there's no qualifying offer. Without one of those the player becomes a ufa) depending on the salary. So if you were to sign a guy for 6 million you'd give your next 4 first round picks for it.   This is what happened with Phil Kessel. Toronto had to give away 2 first rounders to Boston."
Habs,3bfcls,Batmarde,5,Sun Jun 28 21:12:01 2015 UTC,"Phil Kessel got traded, not given an offer sheet, no? The return was two firsts(2010, 2011) and a 2010 2nd. Boston used those picks to draft Seguin with the 2010 1st, Jared Knight with the 2010 2nd and Dougie Hamilton with the 2011 1st"

Habs,3bfcls,slayeryouth,1 point,Sun Jun 28 19:06:37 2015 UTC,"They've made him a qualifying offer, so the worst case scenario is that he signs an offer sheet from an other team and the Habs have the chance to match it, or he does like PK before signing his bridge deal and holds out at the start of the season.  If he's not signed come the end of August then maybe start worrying, but keep in mind that he's a 21 year old kid negotiating his first real contract, and is also in the somewhat unique position of having some leverage in terms of being able to negotiate based on future potential instead of past accomplishment, so it's bound to be a bit of a tricky process."

He was a steal at the 6th round. Thing is he's gonna return to college next year again so he can't develop at the AHL level
Habs,3bcv0p,IBoris,4,Sun Jun 28 03:27:56 2015 UTC,"Most likely not imo. Fucale's stats in the QMJHL are top 10 (under 900 sv% is normal in that league). As a goalie, Fucale has a higher potential."
Habs,3bcv0p,SiegeWar,1 point,Sun Jun 28 01:48:58 2015 UTC,"Also, Fucale's league is a shooting gallery: his stats are more meaningful IMHO."
Habs,3bcv0p,LeMAD,0,Sun Jun 28 09:11:57 2015 UTC,I didn't mean this off stats
Habs,3bcv0p,SiegeWar,1 point,Sun Jun 28 03:25:00 2015 UTC,Hawkey just had a terrible season. Much worse than Fucale.
Habs,3bdjlv,FeelsLike93,11,Sun Jun 28 05:03:26 2015 UTC,Its been confirmed that we won't lose his rights. It appears we have the rights till 2017 AFAIK.

Habs,3bcbwn,Lyver,2,Sat Jun 27 21:35:25 2015 UTC,Damn this kid dominated. Like hard. I think he he played last year his stock would be much higher.
Habs,3bcbwn,quadriplegic_cheetah,2,Sun Jun 28 05:43:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah he seems like a steal. It's almost as if Timmins knew he wasn't on anyone's radar because in a press conference he said ""no one knows much about him - that's how we got him!"""

Habs,3bbij0,Vendura,2,Sun Jun 28 01:25:20 2015 UTC,Yeah but can he do a hockey?
Habs,3bbij0,thawizard,7,Sun Jun 28 11:03:23 2015 UTC,Looks like he has really solid numbers for a defenseman in the 6th round! And he's a lefty
Habs,3bbij0,Sharks9,7,Sat Jun 27 18:11:09 2015 UTC,Everything I've read about him is saying he should have went much higher. Could be a steal at this round. We'll know in a couple years.
Habs,3bbij0,MessageBoard,4,Sat Jun 27 18:13:39 2015 UTC,The only concern is the upside. But that doesn't really matter in the 6th round. If we get a second or third pairing dman in the 6th round that is good.
Habs,3bbij0,DoctorWett,8,Sat Jun 27 18:58:03 2015 UTC,"Nice, he was very good with Rimouski"

Habs,3bb8s4,bcg_music,-10,Sat Jun 27 15:50:43 2015 UTC,He's also 19 and was ranked as a 6th rounder.

Habs,3bb8s4,HammerOfTheSlobs,2,Sat Jun 27 16:43:10 2015 UTC,I think the reason for his low ranking was due to injury concerns though. And he does look pretty solid on paper. Hopefully we got a sleeper here.
Habs,3bb8s4,DisgruntledPorcupine,1 point,Sat Jun 27 18:00:36 2015 UTC,"Another reason is that by his age most of the top swedish players aren't playing in the J20, having graduated to the SHL or Allvenskan"

Habs,3bb8s4,My_McJingleBalls,5,Sat Jun 27 17:46:57 2015 UTC,Aa far as I can tell he was ranked 36th coming in. Nice pickup!
Habs,3bb8s4,MessageBoard,2,Sat Jun 27 15:58:03 2015 UTC,36th amongst European skaters. That's actually extremely low.
Habs,3bb8s4,Kuciv,1 point,Sat Jun 27 16:08:45 2015 UTC,Mm no. Puts him in the 75-100 range so this is normal
Habs,3bb8s4,MessageBoard,-1,Sat Jun 27 16:21:29 2015 UTC,No it doesn't... There typically aren't even 30 European skaters taken in a given year. European skaters list doesn't include Europeans playing in the CHL/USHL/NCAA.
Habs,3bb8s4,Commandant1,1 point,Sat Jun 27 16:23:10 2015 UTC,Don't know why you are being down voted.
Habs,3bbl5p,Strifezard,6,Sat Jun 27 17:36:36 2015 UTC,"It'll be interesting to see him next year. Played 1st/2nd line on a reaaaally young team but lit up the first round of the playoffs. With their core all hitting 18 next year, the 67's should be pretty good, hopefully he can snag that spot next to konecny for most of the year."
Habs,3bbl5p,bcg_music,4,Sat Jun 27 17:46:32 2015 UTC,Good pick IMO. I was hoping for a decent sized LW who can put some points up.
Habs,3bbl5p,Adam87,2,Sat Jun 27 17:43:27 2015 UTC,"Sens fan here who has seen a lot of him. great pick, one of the steals of the draft. I'd put money on him becoming one of the best third line wingers in the league."
Habs,3bbl5p,AskMeIfImAHuman,1 point,Sat Jun 27 18:41:20 2015 UTC,I think this is the best 7th round pick we've made since Sergei Kostitsyn. Although we mostly make terrible 7th round picks. I much prefer picks like these to undersized Americans who are going to the NCAA. We have very little luck in drafting those guys late and them actually developing/putting on enough weight to be NHLers. With a pick like this you take a guy who's already shown huge progress in his draft year and hope he can take it to an even higher level.

Habs,3bbo0x,TheHydroImpulse,2,Sat Jun 27 18:10:11 2015 UTC,"I think Montreal is in a win now kinda mode   Don't you think we'd make a move with our late first rounder then? That's what's left me really perplexed is we didn't improve our team at all in the short term. I know the summer is long, it's just weird that nothing got done in yesterday's craziness."
Habs,3bbo0x,mario1687,3,Sat Jun 27 23:31:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I agree. I'm still hopeful that something happens this summer to improve the team next year, we definitely still have a missing piece or two."
Habs,3bbo0x,TheHydroImpulse,5,Sat Jun 27 23:48:28 2015 UTC,"In terms of the actual draft, I'm pretty pleased with our first-round pick. Everything else is a shot in the dark, and I hope one of those players turns out like Gallagher."
Habs,3bbo0x,Alfr_d,1 point,Sat Jun 27 18:25:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah, we're stacked with RHD now with Subban, Petry, and now Juulsen. We will definitely be able to trade Petry or Juulsen in a few years. It's great cause they have more value than left handed guys, and there would be a lot of teams interested in a right handed guy."
Habs,3bbo0x,Iknowwhereyoualllive,1 point,Sun Jun 28 13:22:39 2015 UTC,Is he right handed? I saw him sign with his left hand on his way down. It's pretty rare for someone to write with their left hand and not be left handed otherwise but it's not unheard of.  I throw and write as a rightie but a left golf/baseball/hockey swing.
Habs,3bbo0x,HLef,2,Sun Jun 28 14:22:13 2015 UTC,Yeah he shoots right. I'm left-handed but golf/bat/shoot right. I had to look it up just to make sure since you said that.

I'm comfortable with the team we have""  Alarming quote, anyone in their basement who watched the games could see the glaring holes and needs of the team. I'm really beginning to think this guy is clueless.  Here's another one ""Jeff Petry & Torry Mitchell that's my July 1st, I'm not chasing players on July 1st""    This is our Gm ladies and gentlemen.  Another 2nd round exit next year I see. It can't be this hard to get a competent person to run a franchise."

Bergeron is about two things: building through the draft and making hockey deals. I think trading picks for Petry has paid off, and a hockey deal isn't going to be made on draft day or the beginning of free agency. If it turns out that he's done nothing to upgrade our top 6 by end of the first quarter of the next season THEN I'll be concerned but otherwise I'm content to be patient."

At least we could say he tried. But him just sitting there talking shit with his thumb up his ass massaging his prostate is worrying.   ""We finished second overall with the team we had.""

Nygren looks like he has no place in Montreal Thrower looks like a bust (he's been bad in ECHL this year) Bennett, Dietz, Ellis, Didier are all long shots. Lernout looks good but will start in AHL next year.  D might be our weakest position in the prospect pool before this pick."
Habs,3b9hhe,Commandant1,1 point,Sat Jun 27 02:44:11 2015 UTC,"Don't you think it's too early to give up on Thrower ? His injury at the beginning of the season really messed him up. Maybe a new setting will help with his confidence ? (New squad, new town, etc)"
Habs,3b9hhe,jo_maka,3,Sat Jun 27 11:37:44 2015 UTC,"His post draft year in the WHL showed no progress from his draft season, in fact it showed regression.  So much so that as a late birthday, Montreal could have signed him in the summer of 2013 and put him in the AHL.  They choose not to, sending him back to the WHL to play an overage season.  For a second round pick, not going to the AHL as soon as possible, and going back to junior for an Overage Season is very rare and not a good sign.  Then he had a good year (2013-14)... Good not great considering it was his fifth year of junior hockey and he was an overage player.  Overagers are expected to dominate.  Still it was a step forward (not a leap, but a step) and he got signed.  Then last year he struggled in the ECHL.  Like really struggled.  The thing is the number of guys who climb that later from ECHL to NHL is really small; goalies a little more than skaters, just due to the fact you might put your second best minor league goalie on a team he can start instead of backing up in the AHL; but skaters is pretty rare.  The Habs have one guy on there team who played a significant amount of time in the ECHL and that was Desharnais.  As an ECHL rookie, he ran away with the scoring title, won rookie of the year, ECHL MVP, won the Kelly Cup, and was ECHL Playoff Scoring leader and Playoff MVP.  Thats the kind of season in the ECHL that says hey... this guy might have some talent, lets give him some big minutes in the AHL and see what happens.  Thrower on the other hand is really struggling, like even in March when his injury should be healed, he's still really struggling in Brampton with the speed of the game.  Things arent going to get any easier.  I think we can hope he suddenly figures it out.  But at this point, when you are planning the future of the team, you can't count on him.  He's under contract the next two years, if he shocks me... great, I was a big fan of him in junior and was excited when the Habs picked him, I'd love to see him fulfill the potential.  I'd absolutely love it.  But thats my heart talking.  My head says that its unlikely at this point."

Habs,3b9hhe,jo_maka,8,Sat Jun 27 12:57:46 2015 UTC,"Developing prospects is a long process, it usually takes around 3 years for a prospect to be NHL-ready, sometimes even longer (especially goalies and defensemen). We need offence now, luckily we drafted good offensive players in the past years. We don't have too many good defensemen in the pipeline right now however so it could be useful to draft some to make sure to have them ready when we need them. Gotta give credit to Trevor Timmins, he almost always draft a few years ahead of our needs. We're going to have Scherbak, McCarron, Hudon, Reway and a few others forwards fighting for a NHL spot this year, we really didn't need to draft more offensive talent. In 3-4 years, when Markov, Emelin and Gilbert are gone and Petry is going to get older, we'll be glad that Timmins drafted Juulsen."

Nobody who picked outside the top 15 really did that well. Kreider, O'reilly, Panik and a handful of others went after Montreals first pick but it was kinda a weak draft.  Timmons isn't God and I never said he was. But if there's anyone out there who I trust to take someone slightly out of left field it's him.

Habs,3b9hhe,Commandant1,2,Sat Jun 27 06:46:38 2015 UTC,Not a huge fan of the pick. Don't see the same upside as Jeremy Roy had who was available. Feels like there's too many holes in his game that need to be developed. A big dman with average skating just reads like a nightmare to me. At this moment it looks like his max upside is a second pairing dman. I think trading down may have been the better option if the scouting staff didn't believe in Roy's potential as a top pairing dman.
Habs,3b9hhe,MessageBoard,4,Sat Jun 27 11:31:39 2015 UTC,"I don't think he's a bad skater.  Speed... good, not great.  However... pivots, edgework, agility, all of that is great Balance and power are also great.  Overall his skating is well above average IMO."
Habs,3b9hhe,Commandant1,2,Sat Jun 27 03:43:50 2015 UTC,"It's above average in the WHL. At the NHL level it's painfully average, which is not a quality many NHL defensemen possess anymore. You gotta be fast to keep up with today's game now that you can't clutch and grab. The guys who can't end up out of the league or as #7's.   It's fine when you take that risk on a guy like Brendan Gallagher in the fifth round. I'm not so sure about taking the same risks in the first when the payoff isn't very big. I guess if he pans out to a top 4 dman and half of the first round busts we'll look back and be happy but right now there's not a lot to be excited for like with a Scherbak or Beaulieu pick."

You gotta be fast to keep up with today's game now that you can't clutch and grab. The guys who can't end up out of the league or as #7's.   First off, I think you are undervaluing his skating.  We differ here, I don't just think its average for NHL level, I think its better than that.  He's also an 18 year old kid who can continue to develop and that includes improving skating.  Beyond that though, his straight line speed isn't what i'm concerned about, he's more than above average in the things that are really important.... pivoting, his first few steps, his agility, his changes of direction.  The ability to keep a forward in front of him is all about those things.  Its like the opposite of a Ryan O'Byrne.  O'B was fast in a straight line, but sucked at anything that required lateral movement and thats why he didn't last in the NHL."

Habs,3b9hhe,quadriplegic_cheetah,3,Sat Jun 27 02:08:01 2015 UTC,Beaulieu would probably have placed high in an NHL skating contest immediately after being drafted. Most guys with poor skating don't get better. It is not an easy trait to work on if you haven't done it by the time you get to the draft. Gallagher is one of five or six examples in the league currently of actually improving to a great level. Skating is definitely not one of the things that is typically underdeveloped in teenagers.

Habs,3b9hhe,poub06,1 point,Sat Jun 27 03:47:44 2015 UTC,"Right but if that's the player they were targeting, and odds were he'd go to the second round, then why not trade our 1st for a high 2nd and a 3rd? I don't doubt his abilities but there was probably a way of getting more out of our 1st."
Habs,3b9hhe,BuddhasLittleWarlock,2,Sat Jun 27 03:50:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah you're right, I thought that Montreal would have done that type of trade with the dept that the draft have.. Maybe they didn't want to take a chance of losing him or their was no team willing to do that type of trade with a pick high enough that would allow the Montreal to draft him.."
Habs,3b9hhe,Fabien_Lamour,-4,Sat Jun 27 06:51:01 2015 UTC,So... we drafted the guy who wants to be the next Kevin Bieksa? I can't say that I'm happy.
Habs,3b9hhe,poub06,6,Sat Jun 27 14:39:15 2015 UTC,A late first rounder turning into a Bieksa type player is actually pretty good. You can't get superstars all the time.
Habs,3b9hhe,ChickennDiddle,3,Sat Jun 27 06:49:02 2015 UTC,"He said that his play style is similar.. I'm pretty happy with that, a tough, big and good moving D-Man can be really important."

The talent and the skills are there, but it’s just a matter of honing them for Juulsen to become an NHL defenseman. It may be a bit excessive of a projection, but Juulsen may take longer than most, and we may not see him in the big league until the 2019-2020 season. It’s wise not to rush defensemen, so two more years in the WHL and then two years of AHL hockey would be best for his development."

I wonder if there are more players involved here, i.e. someone like Bickell who somewhat fell our of favour towards the end of the year and hasn't produced much but brings that size we want in our top 6  That would be a great landing spot for Gilbert too. Low salary and dependable depth dman for them that they were missing during the year  Pleky + Gilbert for Bickell + Sharp?"

You want to get something, you got to give in return. Otherwise, we're just giving picks. Although, SJ are looking for defense. If we aren't giving any of the above, then we have to give a defenseman, picks and prospects. That's not going to give us much leeway. Not to mention you have to take in account Logan Couture's cap of 24mill over 4 years. But I guess it's possible.  Emelin, Scherbak, 1st, 3rd? Emelin, Pateryn or Tinordi, DD or Pleks, a pick?"

Habs,3b7c24,SiegeWar,2,Fri Jun 26 17:26:58 2015 UTC,"A forward HAS to go back. They probably won't want DD unless we send back an additional pick or prospect. Maybe Plekanec, but honestly, Couture's way better. Only upside is that Plek is 1 mill less and has 1 year leaft, so it could work for SJ if they want to rebuild and want to free cap space.  You can't just send them defensemen. Then we would have too many forwards and SJ would have to fill the gap left behind by Couture. At least one forward has to go."
Habs,3b7c24,zeMVK,0,Fri Jun 26 17:31:20 2015 UTC,A forward HAS to go back   We are not coerced into making a deal.
Habs,3b7c24,jo_maka,2,Fri Jun 26 17:57:13 2015 UTC,"Well, yea. This is just a rumor. But I expect SJ wants a NHL defenseman and forward prospect.

Habs,3b7c24,Muter91,7,Fri Jun 26 16:15:48 2015 UTC,Galchenyuk is a 21 year old (almost) 50 point C/LW. Not even in a 1-1 for coco does that make sense.

Galchenyuk is hype and promise, altho very promising... if a GM wants to win NOW, then that deal makes perfect sense... although, with Beaulieu, youd get more than just Couture."
Habs,3b7c24,Muter91,3,Fri Jun 26 16:30:33 2015 UTC,"Yes he is a great player, but so is Galchenyuk. Chucky is cheaper, younger, and his salary can be controlled for longer because of his age. Trading them one for one makes absolutely no sense for the Habs. It would be a big loss."
Habs,3b7c24,Grand_Chief_Mathieu,-2,Fri Jun 26 17:17:00 2015 UTC,"Still, it remains proven vs. unproven player... In the same context, say Im the Sens for example, and lets use Mika Zibanejad in place of Galchenyuk (perfect comparable), I would also do that."
Habs,3b7c24,Muter91,6,Fri Jun 26 17:20:24 2015 UTC,"How can you say he is unproven? He is a bonafide NHLer with three seasons of experience, highest scoring player in his draft year, fourth highest scoring forward on our team with tons of room to grow."

Habs,3b5bme,Sehs,1 point,Fri Jun 26 04:23:46 2015 UTC,Stastny got 7 mill AAV. O'Reilly's posted better numbers in the last few years and hasn't peaked sionce he's much younger. He'd get more.
Habs,3b5bme,quadriplegic_cheetah,2,Fri Jun 26 11:59:04 2015 UTC,"Is he really worth it though? Career high 64 points. Plekanec had 69 points in his third full year. I don't watch him enough but considering he's also on a very offensive team, isn't it odd that he doesn't have a higher production? Shouldn't we expect more from a #1 center?"
Habs,3b5bme,Sehs,4,Fri Jun 26 05:18:41 2015 UTC,"Ryan O'Reilly IS Plekanec. Literally. And this is the way I see it. Ryan O'Reilly is 10 years younger. Plekanec makes 5 million dollars. Would you pay Plekanec 7 mill a year if you could guarantee he would play like he did in his 20's? I would. And when you factor in the cap, a 7 million dollar contract is probably the same as a 6 million dollar contract 5 years ago. In a way we are paying 7 million dollars to extend a guy who plays the exact way as Plekanec. But this guy is in his prime. And as the cap keeps rising, it will be less."
Habs,3b5bme,quadriplegic_cheetah,0,Fri Jun 26 07:17:21 2015 UTC,"Would you pay Plekanec 7 mill a year if you could guarantee he would play like he did in his 20's?    That's the thing, I'm not sure that I would. That's way too much for a 2nd line center, even with the cap increases."
Habs,3b5bme,Sehs,1 point,Fri Jun 26 13:38:11 2015 UTC,Plekanec in his 20's was a first line centre.
Habs,3b5bme,quadriplegic_cheetah,1 point,Fri Jun 26 18:03:43 2015 UTC,Kind of debatable. He could and still can kind of fill that gap but is he a first line center on a cup contender? I think he could probably put up more points now if he played with competent wingers but he usually has a revolving door of linemates who aren't always productive.
Habs,3b5bme,titanstats,1 point,Fri Jun 26 18:28:49 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say so. He's a first line centre. People get ""first line centre"" and ""elite centre"" confused all the time."

I can see that causing a massive political hoopla though, seeing as though back in the day, the Maroons were for the Anglo community, and the Canadiens were there to appeal to the Francophones.  We could also just have another team somewhere off the Island. Call them the South Shore Ticklers, or something."
Habs,3b6s1q,MainHaze,3,Fri Jun 26 14:01:56 2015 UTC,The South Shore Tickler was the name of Quebec's least successful serial killer. True fact.

Habs,3b6s1q,Funkenbrain,3,Fri Jun 26 15:58:26 2015 UTC,"While Montreal is a big hockey market, the loyalty lies with the Habs. It would be blaphemous to cheer for another team. That being said, Quebec City is primed for another team, and I think Toronto could support another team just because of how bad they have been playing, people want a chance to support another team in the Toronto market."
Habs,3b6s1q,icantfallasleep,2,Fri Jun 26 15:11:26 2015 UTC,Montreal isn't as big of a market like Toronto or New York which can support 2 or 3 teams. Better off putting a team in Quebec city.
Habs,3b6s1q,athiestweed420,1 point,Fri Jun 26 14:16:11 2015 UTC,"I'd rather see a QC team before a 2nd MTL team, but both might be possible. I don't see the Nords taking away any fans in the MTL area.  Winnipeg's not much bigger than QC, which itself isn't much bigger than Laval, population-wise."
Habs,3b2y4n,Ravenous27,18,Thu Jun 25 15:21:07 2015 UTC,"I think Carey should remain in his ""prime"" for another 6-7 years barring any injuries."
Habs,3b2y4n,Sehs,9,Thu Jun 25 15:49:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but eventually, he'll need a new contract, and that will put a damper on the cap. He'll probably eat a greater % of the cap then affording the team less maneuvrability. Pacioretty will be getting a new deal in that same time period, and he will hit the bank, if he keeps up playing like he does now, or improves, he could certainly come close to 8 millions AAV.  So there is a Cup window to think of."
Habs,3b2y4n,shiram,2,Thu Jun 25 15:57:02 2015 UTC,"I don't disagree that there's a window now but I think it can last for a while provided we have the core of Carey/PK/Patches. The Rangers have gone pretty far the past two seasons and Lundqvist has an 8.5M cap hit. It's true though that in 3-5 years, those three players will account for a lot of the Habs' salary cap."
Habs,3b2y4n,Sehs,3,Thu Jun 25 16:05:24 2015 UTC,"It's a balancing act for sure. Bergevin strikes me a s a prudent GM, but in a couple years he might to roll the dice a bit more forcefully. Galchenyuk is getting a raise, and if it's a bridge deal, likely he gets another raise in 2 years."
Habs,3b2y4n,shiram,3,Thu Jun 25 16:07:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah if Chucky does ""break out"" in the next two seasons, it will be safe to assume that he's likely going to count for 5M+ as well in a couple of years."
Habs,3b2y4n,Sehs,5,Thu Jun 25 16:18:32 2015 UTC,"With the way the cap is, and seeing what players are asking this year (Soberbeg and Beleskey are looking for 5 millions, ROR is looking for 7.5-8) Galchenyuk could be asking for more than 5 when he hits UFA."
Habs,3b2y4n,shiram,2,Thu Jun 25 16:20:50 2015 UTC,Yeah I'm probably being too optimistic. We'll see!
Habs,3b2y4n,Sehs,2,Thu Jun 25 16:21:47 2015 UTC,Heh I'm in shock seeing the numbers those players are asking!
Habs,3b2y4n,shiram,1 point,Thu Jun 25 16:24:28 2015 UTC,"I wonder if someone of Carey's position, someone who could clearly win a cup, would/has ever volunteered to take a pay cut, or refused to take a pay rise.  Hear me out.  If your one dream is to win the cup, would you prioritise that over an extra $1-2m a year? Obviously if you're only earning $1-2m in the first place then its different, but if you're already earning $6+  Would you, in the knowledge that taking less money would leave more cap space to bring in a better team in front of you, ever refuse more money?   You would never be able to as it of him, of course, it'd have to be something he'd do of his own accord... I just wonder how big the hunger is and what sacrifices players would be willing to make off the rink to get there."
Habs,3b2y4n,rabbyt,1 point,Fri Jun 26 01:26:02 2015 UTC,"We don't know how the cap will evolve though. If the canadian dollar hadn't tanked, it would have been in the 80-90 millions range, allowing us to retain Patches and Price without too much worry."
Habs,3b2y4n,TurboDragon,3,Fri Jun 26 15:15:29 2015 UTC,You can't always bet on that. Look at Rick DiPietro.
Habs,3b2y4n,BuddhasLittleWarlock,10,Thu Jun 25 15:57:08 2015 UTC,"""Cup window"" is an odd term, given that CHI has won 3 in 6 years.  I think we're pressing for a cup right now, but with good management and leadership we should be competitive for the foreseeable future.  It may feel like a 'limited time offer' since we're just coming back into relevancy after a decade of futility, but I think we have a good core and some decent talent coming up through the system.  As for Fucale - keep in mind that Price took 10 years to get where he is now from the day he was drafted."
Habs,3b2y4n,hkycoach,3,Thu Jun 25 16:53:50 2015 UTC,"Look at it this way: Bergevin set Chicago up for cup success with his management and skillset that made them into a dynasty. He's what we need as well to set us up for the future, so I agree completely with what you're saying."
Habs,3b2y4n,JMPesce,2,Thu Jun 25 19:18:29 2015 UTC,"Price and Patches is just about equivalent to Kane and Keith, and I say this as a Hawks fan. Plekanec is even somewhere between Saad and Hossa. The Habs really arent that far off. All they need is one more reliable scorer, and to lose a little bit of dead weight, and they will be a sleek, effective contender."
Habs,3b2y4n,Phridgey,2,Fri Jun 26 03:02:55 2015 UTC,"What player out there, that their team is willing to trade could Montreal land? Many are on expiring deals, and would risk to sign elsewhere after one season. If you're talking trading one of the Habs top 6, opposing GMs would ask for Gallagher, Galchenyuk, or even maybe Pacioretty.  I'm all for improving the team, but I am curious what player out there works out for the team. Keep in mind the other teams needs."
Habs,3b2y4n,shiram,1 point,Thu Jun 25 15:26:36 2015 UTC,"Eberle, Oshie, or Yak could all be available. Create a package using Emelin, Eller, Scherback, Tinordi, Patyrn, Fucale and picks."
Habs,3b2y4n,habsdane,3,Thu Jun 25 17:14:15 2015 UTC,"Why is it that people are just throwing around Scherbak's name like some random spare parts ?  Not only will MB never part with his 1st rounders until he test-drived them for a while, but if you somehow like Galchenyuk, you need to understand that Scherbak is Chucky 2.0 and that he'll be very serviceable while being paid entry level by the time he makes the squad. With the likes of PK and the big tickets of the core, the balancing act won't work if we don't keep high end prospects and pay them peanuts while they still contribute. That is a way better deal in the long run, on a hockey level and money level, than trading a blue chip like that for a Kessel.   Picks ? That can work. 1st rounders rookie ? These are golden nuggets to hold on to  when managing the cap."
Habs,3b2y4n,jo_maka,1 point,Fri Jun 26 00:09:50 2015 UTC,Doubt Chiarelli will trade Yak or Eberle in his first year as the EDM GM unless if he's getting a very good return. Something that we would have to compensate.
Habs,3b2y4n,zeMVK,1 point,Thu Jun 25 21:17:07 2015 UTC,Okposo and Soderberg are two players Id love to see on the Habs. Their not solutions but would be upgrades.
Habs,3b2y4n,Gabroux,5,Thu Jun 25 19:18:18 2015 UTC,"Okposo yes, Sodenberg hell no. Sodenberg is asking for 5m a year to be a 3rd center."
Habs,3b2y4n,zeMVK,1 point,Thu Jun 25 20:40:19 2015 UTC,"For real, Soderberg at 5m+? No way. Especially since he was mainly producing with Erikson around. Then wasn't so great while Erikson was injured.  Not to mention we would have to trade at least a center in order to put him in. Most likely that would be Plekanec as it would allow us to work with the cap if we were to acquire Soderberg at that cap.  Nah, no way.  Edit: Well, seems like the Avs have the rights to Soderberg now. I guess this may make ROR free."
Habs,3b2y4n,Kuciv,2,Thu Jun 25 21:15:56 2015 UTC,Our window is the next 3 years imo. Price should still be in his prime then and our young guns will be more mature and Chucky is out number one C. Lets just hope within the next 5 years the cup returns home.
Habs,3b2y4n,Powdreams,4,Thu Jun 25 16:27:10 2015 UTC,When MB came to Montreal he said he had a 5 year plan. We're about to enter year 4. I think his plan is working because I see us being a real contender in year 5.
Habs,3b2y4n,scelement,1 point,Thu Jun 25 16:38:47 2015 UTC,Yup as do I. I fully trust MB he has done nothing but good things for our team since he became GM. Although I may not agree with them all I trust he has best intentions.
Habs,3b2y4n,jonathangariepy,1 point,Thu Jun 25 16:40:01 2015 UTC,There's always a chance he might walk if they keep playing the system that puts all the pressure on him to be unbelievable every game. That or he's going to cost at least 8-9 million a year.
Habs,3b2y4n,jonathangariepy,1 point,Thu Jun 25 22:12:39 2015 UTC,"There's not a whole lot of options here this off season for solid wingers and centres. We may have to wait until regular season to have a big trade unless they actually sign Sharp which I don't think will affect the team that much.   On the positive side here, we have galchenyuk and gallagher who are getting better every season, our 4th line seems to be pretty legit right now it's just our 2nd and 3rd lines that are failing to really produce productive numbers and I think therrien has gone through every line in the books last season.  Eller has the potential to be a really solid player but tossing him on the third line every season is only wasting his skill and he'll most likely be playing on another team eventually because of this. Give this team 2-3 more seasons and I think we'll be a legit contender for the cup we just need to find a few missing pieces to the puzzle and we're set, mainly a #1 center and a winger that can hopefully match what Pacioretty brings to the table."
Habs,3b2y4n,Phridgey,0,Fri Jun 26 09:22:12 2015 UTC,Kessel is on the market...
Habs,3b2y4n,zeMVK,4,Thu Jun 25 16:09:16 2015 UTC,Would be what we need but I don't like his term.
Habs,3b2y4n,YellowSC,1 point,Thu Jun 25 16:27:07 2015 UTC,"He's paid what he's worth, he's a top 10 scorer in the NHL over the last few years...  We're spoiled thanks to Pacioretty and Price contracts  I'd be surprised if his production didn't go up on a good team like Montreal !"
Habs,3b2y4n,cardiographer,0,Thu Jun 25 18:33:41 2015 UTC,Kessel could be everything the Habs need and more. Assuming some...internal source of influence doesnt stifle him into dumping the puck when he's had a clear zone entry.
Habs,3b2y4n,YellowSC,-1,Fri Jun 26 03:06:00 2015 UTC,"Sure, Kessel's worth that contract. But the problem with his term is having to adjust our salary cap for Kessel's 8mill every year for 7 years. Toronto, is ready to pick up contracts in return, but supposedly not as much as Kessel's value. Not only would we be giving plenty to get Kessel while dumping some contract(s). We would have to make another trade in hopes of ""dropping"" sufficient cap in order to keep Galchenyuk for at least next season.  A 1st, Scherbak, top prospect on entry level + say PAP, for Kessel. Then having to make another trade to get rid of more space where we'll likely have to give more in order to get less back?  I know we have a window right now. Kessel would go a long way. But we need 2 top 6 players, not just 1, unless we feel like DD can take us as a 1st C.  Getting Kessel would be Hell to manage cap wise. It's possible, I think. But it will be tough to manage with all the contracts we will need to re-sign over the years. And it isn't as simple as waiting for players to become UFAs."
Habs,3b2y4n,cardiographer,-1,Thu Jun 25 21:12:21 2015 UTC,Lucic kessel and sharp. Pick 2 and we have a good chance.

Pretty much all the 25$ ones are bought up in the first week of September but on gameday a few (like 100) tickets are sold, and I think once a month another couple hundred are put up for sale. So get in on the september thing. There are also Scalpers, ticket agents etc, but I would suggest the Ticket Vault (where season ticket holders sell their tickets) if you can not buy on the day that single tickets are released.   I dont know your age, but we take pride in out bagels (Fairmont or St. Viateur. A must is a trip to Schwartz for smoked meat. If anyone is Catholic we have a pretty awesome church on the mountain that is worth checking out, but it is not as good as the church that is on Montagne street just below Rene Levesque. The old port is nice for walking at least at this time of year and offers european like flair. If you visit at the end of the month of March you may be able to go to a sugar shack. If you are from a place that does not have a zoo and want an indoor activity during the  day check out the biodome, or if you want a montreal history museum go to the McCord. I think that certain collection are free if you are under 30. Before the game go to a bar above Rene Levesque on Montagne/Crescent/Bishop and you will probably see other fans around."

Maybe Chucky simply said at some point during his conversations with his agent that be would like more ice time, and he expected it to be confidential considering any professional should have kept it so. We just don't know.   The only people who know are the ones directly involved and anything else is rumour, however some people seem to keep repeating it as fact."

Habs,3aytjx,PuckingEh,5,Wed Jun 24 17:02:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm not jazzed on the idea either.   Seems to be that Sharp's started his decline and with Chicago looking to clear some cap space they won't be taking any of our bad contracts.  Hopefully this is just Bergevin testing the waters and guaging the market like the author suggests."
Habs,3aytjx,slayeryouth,3,Wed Jun 24 17:38:04 2015 UTC,"MB spent a few years in the Blackhawks system before coming to MTL. If there's something valuable in Sharp, he'll know.   No arguing the 2014-15 numbers were poor and he is on the decline. But he is also only 1 season removed from 34 goals and 44 assists."
Habs,3aytjx,djohnston02,3,Wed Jun 24 17:09:41 2015 UTC,"MB left in 2012 so aside from the nepotist element there's not going to be much there, and he still had that decline on the most offensive team in hockey. I think sacrificing a 1st for him in this draft (thats the rumour) would be shooting ourselves in the foot with a machine gun. Stanley cup winning teams don't sacrifice a 1st for a guy like this unless they're clearly cup contenders, which we're clearly not."
Habs,3aytjx,PuckingEh,2,Wed Jun 24 17:14:15 2015 UTC,"You're right, but he's still a big, scoring winger that will beef up our top line with some real scoring talent besides Pacioretty.

Habs,3axr16,sex_panther_by_odeon,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:01:06 2015 UTC,"Karlsson deserve an award for best offensive defensemen. He doesn't play on the PK, doesn't take many defensive faceoffs, plays almost 15% of his time on the PP and when they play against big players (Ovi, Crosby, Stamkos, Tavares) the Sens coaching staff tries their best to avoid the match up.  Karlason is almost single handedly put in offensive opportunities. Where he should be because he is best in those situations. That's why I don't see why he should win the best overall defensemen if he isn't used in defensive plays.  I think Doughty or Keith (Subban a close 3rd) should of won the Norris this year and there needs to be a new award for best offensive defensemen which Karlsson should win.  Plus Subban is completely different than Karlsson. He plays a major role on the PK and is used as the main guy to stop Crosby, Stamkos and Ovy. But PK is not as good offensively than Karlsson."

Habs,3axr16,sex_panther_by_odeon,1 point,Fri Jun 26 15:59:34 2015 UTC,"But having Karlsson win the Norris is like having Bergeron win the best forward. Sure Bergeron is amazing defensively and good enough offensively but a forward's job is to put offence first. That is why Bergeron will never be the best forward.  Why don't we use the same logic for the Norris. Weber, Doughty, Subban and Keith are all Elite defensemen that defend first then adds to the offence. Karlsson is the other way around. So unless you create a ""Selke"" for defense (Bobby Orr award) I don't see why a purely offensive guy should win a defense  award."

Habs,3aufe7,Ptrainer87,1 point,Wed Jun 24 05:50:33 2015 UTC,The most obvious  to go is gilbert.  Ld cap  Markov 5.75 Emelin 4.1  Bealieu 1 Total 10.85  Rd Subban 9 Petry 5.5 Gilbert 2.8 Total 17.3  We are spending way too much on the right side and gilbert is the odd man out of the three.  For the forwards pap is the most obvious  option to go.

Habs,3aufe7,habuheard,9,Tue Jun 23 17:29:10 2015 UTC,Pateryn can definitely  take the 3rd pairing role. Emelin is not and should not be going anywhere.  He was by far our best ld in the playoffs last year. Markov was a train wreck again in the playoffs and emelin posted better possession numbers than bealieu despite being buried in dzone starts so that bealieu could be heavily  sheltered.  Markov is getting older and any strides bealieu  makes this year will be replaced with markovs decline so weaking the left side is unwise.   We finally have a great shutdown pairing in emelin and petry that can take on the oppositions best and heavy dzone starts while generating some offense out of it. If we want subban markov/bealieu to keep get ting a disproportionate number of shifts in the ozone we need them. Gilbert is expendable.
Habs,3aufe7,Fabien_Lamour,2,Tue Jun 23 17:46:11 2015 UTC,Tinordi 7th D?
Habs,3aufe7,djohnston02,2,Tue Jun 23 20:42:10 2015 UTC,"Petry is the perfect partner for Emelin. Emelin is alright defensively, very physical, but has no vision for offense trouble passing the puck out of our zone, which Petry excels at."
Habs,3aufe7,shiram,1 point,Wed Jun 24 10:34:50 2015 UTC,"Even if we didn’t make any trades or change a thing our lineup would look something like:          Pacioretty         DD             Gallagher, Galchenyuk       Plekanec       Parenteau, DLR/Hudon       Eller/Mac       DSP/Sherback, Prust                Mitchell          Weise/Flynn  Markov     Subban, Emelin      Petry, Pateryn     Beaulieu, Tinordi (7th defenseman)  We would have perhaps the best blueline in the league and plenty of depth.  + Carey Price + Gilbert, if we didn't trade him."
Habs,3aufe7,BinaryChode,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:00:41 2015 UTC,"I honestly don't think our defence should be touched. Parting with Gilbert only frees up 2.8 mil, and Emelin is going to be pretty hard to move. Also, our organizational depth on LD is VERY shallow and weak. Pretty much just Tinordi."
Habs,3aufe7,bsaures,0,Wed Jun 24 01:06:42 2015 UTC,That's some stupid calculation. It's not like Gilbert is the one making that RD salary go up...   Replacing Gilbert with Pateryn gives you only 2M.
Habs,3aufe7,Tomy2TugsFapMaster69,-5,Tue Jun 23 23:17:47 2015 UTC,"Trade Emelin, re-sign Chucky at a reasonable $3mil/year, and the habs can afford Patrick Sharp."
Habs,3aufe7,Ptrainer87,18,Tue Jun 23 16:30:04 2015 UTC,"Don't really want Patrick Sharp though, best years behind, nearly 6 million in cap hit."
Habs,3aufe7,KimonS,4,Tue Jun 23 16:41:00 2015 UTC,"exactly, I don't know why anyone would think it's a great idea to pick up sharp."
Habs,3aufe7,zamerf,4,Tue Jun 23 17:13:38 2015 UTC,With some of the new players in the block and based on chicagos ask it would make way more sense to go after okposo and we can shave off money by moving parenteau.

Habs,3avtex,CP31,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:20:10 2015 UTC,"I'd love to get Sprong, and if he's not available, I wouldn't complain about Bracco, he's small but Johnson and Gaudreau and Gallagher have shown that that doesn't really matter."
Habs,3atj1s,DoctorRavioli,3,Tue Jun 23 11:42:46 2015 UTC,It could be that he was in town for personal time. I'd assume that some teams wouldn't mind sending somebody to make an initial interview before there were talks with the GM. There are teams out there looking for a coach. So it could be one of their representatives.
Habs,3atj1s,zeMVK,5,Tue Jun 23 12:59:37 2015 UTC,I wouldn't read too far into this. A Quebecois in Quebec during the offseason seems pretty normal!  Wouldn't mind seeing him back somewhere in the Habs organisation though.
Habs,3atj1s,Fabien_Lamour,3,Tue Jun 23 18:46:48 2015 UTC,"He says he wants an NHL head coaching gig, and I can't really see Therrien agreeing to have Boucher as an assistant.  But if they could convince to accept a position coaching in Saint John's with the understanding that he would be the first in line to take over the Montreal bench when Therrien is let go and that all NHL coaches have a limited shelf life, I'd be pretty happy.   The problems with that though are that while Boucher doesn't have the luxury of choosing where he goes, he has turned down offers from NHL clubs so he probably doesn't have to settle for a ""coach-in-waiting"" position either.  And given Bergevin's comments at his end of season presser and his close relationship with Therrien, I'm not sure how eager he'd be to have viable competition for the head coach's spot that close to the team.  But a boy can dream....."
Habs,3atj1s,slayeryouth,7,Tue Jun 23 19:31:13 2015 UTC,Was this the man he was talking to?

Habs,3atj1s,Kakemphaton,2,Tue Jun 23 18:50:49 2015 UTC,"It really seems like he's just waiting for the right offer.  He's said that he's already turned down NHL head coaching gigs, so I would guess that he has a pretty good idea of what he wants to do and where he wants to do it and doesn't mind waiting for it.  I suppose that the longer he stays away from the NHL the harder it will be for him to get back in, but it's not as if he's coaching in Kazakhstan or somewhere so he can still build a respectable body if work to show for himself in the meantime."
Habs,3atj1s,slayeryouth,2,Tue Jun 23 19:37:21 2015 UTC,"coaching in Kazakhstan   Verrrry niiiiiice, Kazakhi Bears is good team! I like!"
Habs,3atj1s,JMPesce,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:02:29 2015 UTC,Hmm. Drummondville has bright red colors. They were Boucher's old junior team. Maybe he was just consulting or reconnecting with old buddies.
Habs,3au8y5,hkycoach,4,Tue Jun 23 15:36:42 2015 UTC,I really hope that it's Sprong.
Habs,3au8y5,BuddhasLittleWarlock,1 point,Tue Jun 23 18:55:33 2015 UTC,"We are already pretty deep at LW, yet choices 2 and 3 are both LW? I hope that Sprong is available, he seems to be the best fit in the current lineup."
Habs,3au8y5,Mikash33,3,Tue Jun 23 17:17:05 2015 UTC,"How are we deep al LW? We have one legitimate LW on the roster. The rest are centers (Galchenyuk/ De La Rose) and converted right wings (Prust). I mean I'd argue our best prospect (Hudon) is a natural LW, but he's been moved to center. So I'd say our thinnest position is LW."
Habs,3au8y5,quadriplegic_cheetah,4,Tue Jun 23 18:00:27 2015 UTC,"Even if we were deep at LW, nobody we're going to draft is going to be drafted based on our current needs."
Habs,3au8y5,KarlPilkingtonsBrain,3,Tue Jun 23 18:03:42 2015 UTC,"I agree completely, you take the best player available."
Habs,3au8y5,quadriplegic_cheetah,1 point,Tue Jun 23 18:05:31 2015 UTC,"Well this is assuming that the coach has not given up on Gally as a center. If so, we are fine but I would agree that if we put him on C where he belongs that we would need a LW to rebalance the top 6."

Habs,3awym4,Razorback101,1 point,Wed Jun 24 14:47:07 2015 UTC,"I meant to make a gif of the play: slow it down and such. Price didn't make the save; the puck is still in the air at the end of the clip. Obviously the game's AI wouldn't allow Markov to attempt an own goal, but why did EA pick that clip? Which player is it highlighting? Price is clearly beat. Markov hasn't prevented the puck from going into the net. The opposition player is clearly out of the picture. The ad guys at EA stared at each of these clips a lot more than I did, editing frame by frame. I still think this has a chance of being intentional/a good-humoured, poke (maybe even an Easter egg of sorts)."

Habs,3as3nm,ChristoPero,12,Tue Jun 23 01:43:45 2015 UTC,"Can't get much better than Pat Brisson... Don't think this changes much right now, I still think he signs a bridge deal.. but might be good for talking about his role on the team"
Habs,3as3nm,Razorback101,9,Tue Jun 23 02:01:25 2015 UTC,"Oh that's good! I heard he's friends with MB, and more communication is always better!"
Habs,3as3nm,Kartias,2,Tue Jun 23 01:50:41 2015 UTC,You think? It sounds more to me like MB wasn't terribly thrilled with the message Galchenyuk was communicating. I kind of doubt he fired Larionov and co. because they were being too tough.
Habs,3as3nm,Fenrir,2,Tue Jun 23 01:54:56 2015 UTC,Pulver was reported to have wanted to get long-term deals at a high price. Maybe he's still pissed about losing Scott Gomez after MB bought out his contract.
Habs,3as3nm,jo_maka,3,Tue Jun 23 03:08:36 2015 UTC,"You don't think Galchenyuk wants a long term deal at a high price?   Again, if what Larionov said regarding Galchenyuk being upset with his usage is true, I don't think he was let go because he was being too tough."
Habs,3as3nm,Fenrir,3,Tue Jun 23 03:37:24 2015 UTC,"I don't know what his angle is tbh. Maybe they disagreed , not on the goal, but on the method. From what I understand the Larionovs and the Galchenyuks are actual friends. Larionov went with Pulver only in 2013. Maybe the Galchenyuks didn't like the methods that Pulver wanted to use."
Habs,3as3nm,jo_maka,2,Tue Jun 23 04:21:40 2015 UTC,"Me neither. It's not like we have ton of information.  I just can't imagine the Galcheyuks being upset over someone being too tough on Bergevin.  My concern is that there's a pattern of young players who have expressed their dissatisfaction. Galchenyuk, Tinordi, Beaulieu, Sekac. I'm sure Subban wasn't thrilled with the way his bridge deal was handled.  I get that young players aren't always going to like the way a club deals with them and it'd be fine if it were a one off, but jerking our rookies around seems to be part of the Montreal process."
Habs,3as3nm,Fenrir,3,Tue Jun 23 04:35:24 2015 UTC,"I really suspect the ""agent and contract"" situation and the ""frustrated player vs coach"" situation are really 2 different issues. And perhaps Pulver's agency is trying to mitigate the damage by putting some dirt on the kid. If that's the case, I'd understand if he wants out."
Habs,3as3nm,jo_maka,1 point,Tue Jun 23 04:43:57 2015 UTC,"I guess. It's my, completely baseless, feeling that Pulver and Larionov didn't defend Galchenyuk's position as strongly as he wanted because they're part of the old boy NHL network and that ticked Galchenyuk off. The whole ""making him a better person"" sounds like NHL speak for, ""he thinks the coach is full of shit"" and needs to be put in his place. That would jive perfectly with Therrien's old school attitude.  And I think that's a terrible way to coach."
Habs,3as3nm,Fenrir,1 point,Tue Jun 23 05:04:06 2015 UTC,Glachenyuck is quoted in the article as saying that what Larionov and Pulver said after the break up is BS.

Habs,3as3nm,quadriplegic_cheetah,2,Tue Jun 23 04:17:55 2015 UTC,Which is exactly why they don't wanna sign a long term contract. They know he'll make bank after the bridge.
Habs,3as3nm,Batmarde,2,Tue Jun 23 04:36:28 2015 UTC,I always imagined Galchenyuk was going for a long term deal around 5 mill. I would give it to him honestly.

Also,   “Ian and I were trying to help him to become a good hockey player but, more importantly, to be a good human being,” Larionov said.   Golly geez, the people in and around our organization are so swell with the way they try to make our players nice people."

Habs,3ari15,habuheard,3,Tue Jun 23 23:07:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah and up until now anyone who talks about Chucky has had nothing but good things to say about him. ""Mature"" and ""Character"" beyond his age is what MB has always said about him. Until it's contract negotiation time. They did the same with Subban, it's ridiculous. And people buy into that crap too."
Habs,3ari15,Muter91,1 point,Tue Jun 23 23:12:07 2015 UTC,"The thing that gets me is that it obviously didn't work very well with Subban, so why try it again with Galchenyuk?  Does Bergevin think he wasn't Subban's negotiation with an eye to the future?  I'm sure Chucky knows better than to take it to heart, but at the same time if I'm him then I'm just kind of going ""I've seen this song and dance before Marc.  It didn't work then and it's not working now."""
Habs,3ari15,slayeryouth,1 point,Wed Jun 24 00:37:04 2015 UTC,"I'm all for tough negotiations and trying to be as fair as possible, but Chucky has earned a long term contract. Subban had also earned a long term contract. Imagine having Subban locked up for 12 years at a 6M cap hit instead of 8 years at 9M. MB screwed that negotiation up pretty badly, before the lockout. It balances out with Pacioretty's beautiful cap hit though.."
Habs,3ari15,Muter91,3,Wed Jun 24 03:13:27 2015 UTC,"“I tried to make him understand that he has to be patient,” Larionov said. “I had to wait when I was a young player; every great player has a time when he’s going to be on the bench, but you have to learn that’s part of the game.”   So is Larionov wrong then?"
Habs,3ari15,discoinfiltrator,2,Tue Jun 23 02:40:48 2015 UTC,Yes. Absolutely.

Habs,3ari15,Funkenbrain,2,Tue Jun 23 05:17:23 2015 UTC,Well it definitely wasn't da system helping him. One of the worst teams in attempted shots/unblocked shots and high quality chances
Habs,3ari15,Powdreams,2,Tue Jun 23 14:36:09 2015 UTC,"Exactly right. For a 'defensive coach,' it was nice how he gave Carey lots of chances to boost that 5v5 SV%."
Habs,3ari15,Funkenbrain,0,Tue Jun 23 18:29:11 2015 UTC,Yes.
Habs,3ari15,Fenrir,7,Tue Jun 23 02:45:25 2015 UTC,"This is the habs sub, even though the way Therrien handled Subban turned Subban into a total scrub, it's clear that minimizing a 21 year olds ice-time (to 14-15 minutes) is a terrible decision. As is literally everything that Therrien has ever done since the day he was born."
Habs,3ari15,quadriplegic_cheetah,3,Tue Jun 23 04:44:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah, they've made him made him worse. I'd rather they not do that to Galchenyuk.  This has always struck me as such a defeatist attitude. We get bounced in the second round and all these fans are like, ""Yay! We did ok."" Which is ridiculous because the argument has never been that we're terrible. The issue people have is that we're not doing as well as we could. The team is not achieving at its optimum which is a sign of mismanagement.  Now, feel free to think that we're not as good as I think we are, but taking refuge behind what moderate success we've had and acting like that's proof of good management is weak sauce."
Habs,3ari15,Fenrir,6,Tue Jun 23 04:59:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah, they've made him made him worse.    Wait what? How are we evaluating that they've made Subban worse exactly?  Last season he had career highs in:   Goals Assists Points +/- GWG S%   He also had a career low for penalty minutes. Not to mention he's playing a much more complete game now.  How exactly have they made him worse?"
Habs,3ari15,Sehs,4,Tue Jun 23 15:14:57 2015 UTC,I was gonna say- is nobody going to point out the fact that buddy just said Subban is worse now than when he entered the league? ಠ_ಠ
Habs,3ari15,AlabamaLegsweep,2,Tue Jun 23 15:49:05 2015 UTC,"Not to mention he's playing a much more complete game now.   Is he, though? I've always kind of felt a lot of his supposed deficiencies were kind of made up.  His CF/60, SF/60 and CA/60, SA/60 are lower than they were earlier in his career at even strength, on the PP and on the PK. He's not controlling the play the way he did in 2010-11 and 2012-13.   Worse probably isn't the best way to describe it. I don't think he's lost skill or anything, it's more that he's not being allowed to use his skill to its full potential and, as a result, he didn't contribute as much value as he has in the past.  Obviously you can't compare years perfectly, he did have a great year and got career highs, as you mentioned. But I'd be hesitant to say he had the best year of his career."
Habs,3ari15,Fenrir,5,Tue Jun 23 15:59:35 2015 UTC,"His CF/60, SF/60 and CA/60, SA/60 are lower than they were earlier in his career at even strength, on the PP and on the PK.   A lot more could be gleaned from your argument if you provided how much lower they were. How significant of a decrease was it?   He's not controlling the play the way he did in 2010-11 and 2012-13.   2010-11 was his rookie season. What was his deployment like that season? Zone starts? Quality of competition?   2011-12 You seem to have left this season out. Should probably include this if you're going to argue Therrien makes him worse. since leaving it out  eliminated half of his games played before Therrien was hired.   2012-13 was a half-season. Doesn't really make sense to compare 48 and 82 game season as A LOT can happen in 34 games. Also, Therrien was the coach that season.  EDIT: On a per game basis, this was his best season statistically (for goals and assists anyways)...Under Therrien. Although I still don't like assigning a half season the same statistical significance as a full 82 game season that starts in October.    Looks like you're making your argument based on cherry picked stats and seasons.    If you believe your argument is sound, why don't you lay out all the relevant statistics for every season so we can actually make a reasonable analysis on whether MT and co have made him worse?"
Habs,3ari15,theres__no_time,2,Tue Jun 23 17:04:19 2015 UTC,"While you make some excellent points, I think our forward core is pretty weak. And that's a huge flaw. A lot of people complain about our poor Corsi, but when you look at the guys we have up front, it's not crazy to think that they play a role in that. I mean look at 2012-2013, Ryder (A huge bonus to the team) Plekanec, Gionta, Desharnais, Gallagher, Galchenyuk, Eller, Pacioretty. Compared to The group we have now? I'd say that's a fair reason. We have the greatest goalie in the world however, so in a sense, we have the greatest Corsi filter in the league.  As much as people hate DD he's actually a serviceable 2nd/3rd liner on a cup winning team. Our problem is he's playing 1st line. We have a lot of young players coming through up front, and I honestly think these holes can be patched (even as Chuky and Gallagher continue to progress). I think our offence will be stronger this year, and our Corsi as well."
Habs,3ari15,quadriplegic_cheetah,2,Tue Jun 23 06:05:27 2015 UTC,"If he's a top 9 forward according to you on a cup winning team,  he would've been traded by now. I'm sure the ducks, hawks, bolts and rangers could use a 1 dimensional small center with a 3.5 cap hit on their team. Guys like Rackell, teravinen and hagelin are no comparison to a top 9 forward on a cup winning team dd"
Habs,3ari15,Powdreams,1 point,Tue Jun 23 14:33:17 2015 UTC,"Desharnais is twice the player Rackell is, better than Teuvo and worse than Hagelin. All this does is prove my point. And Desharnais isn't poor defensively, that's just a myth."

Why should tampa even bother to play Ryan callaghan on their third line in the playoffs,  DD is a humongous upgrade with his superior goal scoring,  play making and the way he never gets pushed off the puck."
Habs,3ari15,Powdreams,2,Tue Jun 23 22:01:19 2015 UTC,"Why would we trade a 2nd/3rd line center man when we are in position to win a cup? That makes no sense. The reason nobody calls is because the know the answer is no. It's the same reason that Rackell, Hagelin, and Teuvo weren't being called for, because why the fuck would a team in position to win a cup trade a top 9 forward? Nobody called for a guy like Marcus Johanssen either? Does that mean he's bad? What a dumb fucking argument.    Bob Murray must have a secret plan to get DD if Matt Belesky walks.    Yes Bob Murray the greatest GM in the league is going to try to pry a top 9 forward away from a cup contender.  You go after weaker teams players, who wanna rebuild, it's really fucking simple.   If we were out of the playoffs and DD had a year left on his contract, then yes MB would be getting calls for a guy like DD to fill a 2nd/3rd like C role, because that's how it fucking works."
Habs,3ari15,quadriplegic_cheetah,1 point,Wed Jun 24 01:38:16 2015 UTC,"As much as people hate DD he's actually a serviceable 2nd/3rd liner on a cup winning team   Honestly, as much I'd prefer Chucky in the 1 C spot, my biggest problem with DD there isn't that he isn't good enough as much as he too often tries to force a pass to Paccioretty rather than just taking a shot himself.  I suspect that he's probably told to look for the pass to Patches first because when they've been separated it hasn't been an issue, but in any case if he had a bit more of a shoot first mentality when they're together I'd bet that a lot of the criticism towards him would die down (except for from the MOAR BIGGER crowd of course.)"
Habs,3ari15,slayeryouth,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:09:42 2015 UTC,It's even more frustrating because DD has a great shot. He has arguably the best slap shot on the team.
Habs,3ari15,quadriplegic_cheetah,1 point,Tue Jun 23 21:00:18 2015 UTC,"I think I'd probably rate Subban's as the best slap shot on the team just in terms of sheer power, but what DD lack in power he makes up for with his fast release.  It's like I'll know he took a slapper because of the follow through, but it happened so quickly I didn't even see the wind up.  It's kind of a shame because he has a really great skill set, but he often leaves what could be a really useful part of it out of his game."
Habs,3ari15,slayeryouth,2,Tue Jun 23 21:09:57 2015 UTC,His SO goal against Toronto is a good example of this. Just a perfectly placed slapper.
Habs,3ari15,quadriplegic_cheetah,2,Tue Jun 23 21:31:53 2015 UTC,"Does he deserve ice time just because?  You could argue that he deserves more ice time than Desharnais (although they were very similar throughout the regular season and DD's ice time is often a function of Pacioretty's) but there are only two other forwards (Plekanec and Pacioretty) that were on the ice more often.   I understand that Galchenyuk is a talented player and should have a bright future but it seems like some people expect Ovechkin.  It seems like few players in their first 3 seasons do exceptionally well and do take some time to develop.  From the 2012 draft Galchenyuk has the most goals (tied with Yakupov), assists, and points.  I totally understand the desire to have him do well but we shouldn't expect miracles.  If you want to compare player progression it looks like Galchenyuk has had a better first 3 seasons than Pacioretty did with more points and goals per 60 minutes of play.  Pacioretty also saw less ice time during that period and that didn't seem to hurt him too much, did it?"
Habs,3ari15,discoinfiltrator,3,Tue Jun 23 03:43:45 2015 UTC,"Does he deserve ice time just because?    No. But he was the 4th best forward on our team and had the 5th most ice time, according to War on Ice.   You could argue that he deserves more ice time than Desharnais   Yes, that's my argument. Not only more ice time but his position too.   I don't understand what anything else you wrote has to do with anything. Who cares what Pacioretty did? The argument is not about where he is in his development. The argument is that he is currently better than someone we're using in his place and it would help his development if he were used appropriately. ""Well, it won't hurt him"" is not a good reason for doing something."
Habs,3ari15,Fenrir,1 point,Tue Jun 23 03:54:20 2015 UTC,"No. But he was the 4th best forward on our team and had the 5th most ice time, according to War on Ice.   The difference between Desharnais and Galchenyuk in terms of ice time was less than 30 seconds per game.  Again, he should arguably see more ice time than Desharnais but it's not like there's some massive difference in their usage.  One of their biggest differences is zone starts with Galchenyuk starting relatively less often in the offensive zone than Desharnais (and his perennial line-mate Pacioretty, right where you want him to be) which might actually be a good thing for Galchenyuk's development.   The argument is that he is currently better than someone we're using in his place and it would help his development if he were used appropriately.   How do you know that?  Are you familiar with the goals and assessments of the team and what they think they see out of Galchenyuk?  Is placing him on the first line with Pacioretty and having him start overwhelmingly in the offensive zone good for the development of a strong two-way player? Probably not.  He's better than Desharnais, but that doesn't mean they fill the same role and should be considered interchangeable.  He will be a great player but he's only 20 years old.  Raw talent and a high draft selection doesn't necessarily mean he should automatically be placed on the first line before having much time to develop as an NHL player.  Larionov and the Canadiens organization sure seem to think so.   ""Well, it won't hurt him"" is not a good reason for doing something.   No, not at all what I said.  I implied that it's common for young players in their first few years of NHL play to not play heavy minutes or produce amazing results and that gradual development isn't a bad thing."
Habs,3ari15,discoinfiltrator,2,Tue Jun 23 04:26:52 2015 UTC,"The difference between Desharnais and Galchenyuk in terms of ice time was less than 30 seconds per game.   Fair enough, but ice time is one of the ways a coach communicates to players what he thinks of them. Especially in the case of a rookie.   How do you know that? Are you familiar with the goals and assessments of the team and what they think they see out of Galchenyuk?   Well, I don't know for certain but I can see how he's playing on the ice and see the numbers he's putting up. I don't really care what the team's goals are or their assessment of him is. The goal is presumably to win the cup (although sometimes I don't think that's what motivates certain members of the organization) and I don't think they're going about it with any particular efficiency. And whatever their assessments are, their player usage is terrible.   Raw talent and a high draft selection doesn't necessarily mean he should automatically be placed on the first line before having much time to develop as an NHL player.  Larionov and the Canadiens organization sure seem to think so.   No, it means he should earn his way there and he more than has. He's a 20 goal scorer. Do you know how few of those there are in the NHL? He is already a very good NHL player, he was drafted to be a centre and he's not going to magically develop those skills if he doesn't play there.  And, again, I don't care what the Canadiens think because I don't think they're terribly competent, and if Larionov agreed with them I'm glad he was fired.   I implied that it's common for young players in their first few years of NHL play to not play heavy minutes or produce amazing results and that gradual development isn't a bad thing.   Sure. And my point is I don't care what is common, I care what is best for the team."
Habs,3ari15,Fenrir,3,Tue Jun 23 04:47:29 2015 UTC,"I agree with discoinfiltrator. Of course we want the cup, but gradual is still good. I'm sure Larionov gave him the best of advice. I don't like what I see sometimes from G's attitude - he seems frustrated on the ice, and ice time should not be the issue. He's like a young paddawan: he needs to channel his inner force for greatness!"
Habs,3ari15,Kakemphaton,3,Tue Jun 23 06:18:14 2015 UTC,"but gradual is still good.   Unfortunately gradual is not something we can easily afford. We have a time limit imposed by the Price and Pacioretty contracts, especially if we don't get a breakout rookie or two."

Habs,3ari15,quadriplegic_cheetah,5,Mon Jun 22 22:51:06 2015 UTC,"I'd say he wants to play center, and that he will next year."
Habs,3ari15,MessageBoard,26,Tue Jun 23 04:46:54 2015 UTC,Can't blame him. Not like he's being benched for star players. He's being benched for David fucking Desharnais.

Habs,3ari15,deanresin_,2,Tue Jun 23 02:00:34 2015 UTC,"It's time to give Galchenyuk a definitive chance at center. If anything, I hope Bergevin forces Therrien's hand again by trading DD, just like he did with Moen/Bourque. At this rate, we'll never develop Galchenyuk as a #1 center if we don't put him there and have him build chemistry with Pacio and Gallagher. 2 more years of Desharnais... shudder I believe the term remaining on DD's contract may make him easier to trade."
Habs,3ari15,slayeryouth,1 point,Tue Jun 23 06:40:10 2015 UTC,Galchenyuk is a an ozone giveaway machine.   Desharnais can gain claim the blueline and protect the puck in his sleep.   Galchenyuk also was in poor fitness down the stretch.
Habs,3ari15,deanresin_,3,Tue Jun 23 17:36:11 2015 UTC,Galchenyuk both produced points at a better rate and maintained better possession of the puck down the stretch and during the playoffs than Desharnais.  On the entirety of the regular season there was only a 0.04 difference in terms of possession in Desharnais favour with Galchenyuk still producing more points per 60 minutes.  Turnovers can be a kind of misleading stat.  Players who have the puck more pretty much always turn it over more just by virtue of having more opportunity to.
Habs,3ari15,slayeryouth,-1,Tue Jun 23 20:02:30 2015 UTC,Desharnais played against much stiffer and competition.  Galchenyuk was heavily insulated.  Protecting the puck/giveaways has very little direct correlation to corsi possession stats which rely on shots on goal for and against.
Habs,3ari15,deanresin_,3,Tue Jun 23 20:31:21 2015 UTC,"Desharnais played against much stiffer and competition.  Galchenyuk was heavily insulated.   You can sort the table by teammate/competition and see that their QoC was actually quite similar.  Desharnais had the benifit of a larger portion of starts in the offensive zone though.   Protecting the puck/giveaways has very little direct correlation to corsi possession stats which rely on shots on goal for and against.   This is just nonsense.  If a player is constantly losing the puck, they can't make shot attempts.  Simple as that."
Habs,3ari15,slayeryouth,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:57:58 2015 UTC,You are misinterpreting the advanced stats here.    Desharnais is a playmaker and takes shots rarely biasing his corsi stat.  He is very good at protecting the puck and I know this by virtue of watching him play.   They both may give up the puck the same amount but Desharnais will have had the puck for much longer before giving it away.  Galchenyuk literally gives the puck up almost right away frequently.  He is so weak on the puck.  He was terrible in the playoffs in this regard.
Habs,3ari15,deanresin_,2,Tue Jun 23 21:46:18 2015 UTC,"If you're going to accuse somebody of misinterpreting advanced starts, you probably shouldn't go and demonstrate a complete lack of understanding how corsi works immediately after.   Desharnais is a playmaker and takes shots rarely biasing his corsi stat.    If he's on the ice for a shot attempt or or against it will bias his corsi stat one point for or against regardless of he is personally taking the shot or not.  Cori's usefulness as an individual stat comes from the fact that if a player is on the ice for a lot of shot attempts for or against we can look at their numbers and extrapolate how good or bad they are at driving possession.  Players who are good at maintaining possession put their team in a position to make a lot of shot attempts.  Players who are bad at it put their team in a position to give up a lot of shot attempts.  We can also look at a player's corsi relative numbers which compares their teams rate of possession when they're on the ice and when they're off it, and Galchenyuk's more favourable numbers down the stretch, and identical numbers to Deaharnais on the entirety of the season, in that regard still doesn't support your assertion of him being an ""offensive zone turn over machine.""  Especially when considering his substantially fewer offensive zone starts.  The bottom line is that when Galchenyuk is on the ice the team is taking more shots in the zone than when he's off it which would be quite impossible if he was constantly giving up the puck.   He is very good at protecting the puck   Nobody is saying otherwise.  The point of contention is that you said that Galchenyuk isn't, and there isn't any evidence to support that.   and I know this by virtue of watching him play.    Galchenyuk is very good at protecting the puck and I know this by virtue of watching him play.  Now we have the problem of determining just how reliable either of our sets of eyes are.  Thankfully we also have sets of subjective data derived from in game events to corroborate our assertions with.     They both may give up the puck the same amount but Desharnais will have had the puck for much longer before giving it away.   So what?  The purpose of possessing the puck is to enable a shot on goal and hopefully score.  You don't get points for playing keep away (although if that's the mindset the Habs have it would partially explain why they were so low scoring).  I'm not really sure that I buy your assertion that Desharnais holds on to the puck for longer either because as a far as I know, the length of time any given player has the puck on their stick isn't really tracked yet.   Galchenyuk literally gives the puck up almost right away frequently.  He is so weak on the puck.  He was terrible in the playoffs in this regard.   You keep saying this, but the available data still doesn't support it.  Maybe you have a super compelling reason why somebody just take you're word for it though over publicly available, testable, and verifiable data?  Or even if we leave the data out of the equation, why anybody should just take your word for it over anybody else's?  How would we go about verifying the accuracy of your eye test?"
Habs,3ari15,slayeryouth,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:36:50 2015 UTC,"Half a season is not a big enough sample size to be using corsi stats to compare players' puck protection skills and giveaways.   Corsi over a longer period can hint at a players puck protection skills but it isn't a direct correlation.    Corsi is shots for and against (as you corrected for everyone on the ice).  That is it.  It is up to the beholder to correctly interpret the data given the player, his position on the team, and his competition, and his tendencies.

But then if you have all that information then why would you need Corsi?   I literally just explained how corsi is useful.  But if you want a quick refresher, if a team has possession of the puck (keeping in mind that it's impossible to attempt a shot without first having possession) more often than not when an individual player is on the ice then it's a good indicator that said player is good at driving possession.  If a team is giving up lots of shots when said player is on the ice, it's a good indicator that they are bad at maintaining possession of the puck.  Corsi reletive provides further context by measuring how many shot attempts team takes or gives up when an individual player is on the ice versus when they're off.   Advanced stats are rarely very useful.     Lol, if you say so.  But for what it's worth there is a robust body of work that's publicly available, verifiable, and testable, and just a google search away that says the exact opposite   Like in MB's own words...  I don't need advanced stats to tell me Galchenyuk struggled in the playoffs.   What possible reason could a GM have to down play a players skill right before entering into contract negotiations.

Habs,3ari15,HanshinFan,2,Tue Jun 23 02:49:00 2015 UTC,"This absolutely nothing like Lindros's situation with the Nordiques.  Lindros said he wouldn't play for the Nordiques before they even drafted him because he didn't like that the city was fairly isolated and spoke French, but for some reason they drafted him anyways.  Galchenyuk is negotiating a contract with a team that he's already played 3 seasons for and has merely parted ways with an agent who he didn't feel like was adequately representing his interests.  Attempting to conflate a player asking for more ice time during negotiations (which by their very nature involve one party saying ""this is what I want"" and the other saying ""this is what we'll give you"" and then going back and forth until they find something they can both live with) is disingenuous at best, much less attempting to compare them to a player who refused to even enter negotiations.  Or maybe you mean when Lindors rightly criticized the Flyers medical staff for failing to diagnose a concussion and allowing him to continue playing with symptoms and Bobby Clark threw a hissy fit?  In which case, this still isn't even remotely comparable."
Habs,3ari15,slayeryouth,2,Tue Jun 23 03:03:32 2015 UTC,"for some reason they drafted him anyways   Because they knew they could trade him for a huge haul. They got Peter Forsberg out of that draft, and he won two Cups with the franchise."

Habs,3ari15,Fenrir,5,Tue Jun 23 00:07:52 2015 UTC,I guess that's true if you consider regression to be showing improvement in pretty much every area from the 2013/2014 season to the season that just past.

It's misleading, honestly. Nobody really cares about how hard a player works, they care about the results. Galchenyuk is the 4th best forward on our team, and has tons of room to grow if he's allowed.  The agents know Galchenyuk has very little leverage as an RFA, so they told him to be patient. He didn't like that, (correctly) feels he's being misused, maybe feels the agents aren't supporting him enough or that they just want to get the deal done, so he lets them go.  We're going to hear more and more of this sort of thing going forward. The fans aren't the only ones who recognize a problem. The players can see it too."
Habs,3ari15,slayeryouth,-1,Tue Jun 23 00:44:34 2015 UTC,I don't obviously.  I never said he regressed.  I said almost.  I was expecting him to become a very good player sooner.  He is the same age as Filip Forsberg for example.  He needs to step up big time.
Habs,3ari15,televisionceo,5,Tue Jun 23 00:23:00 2015 UTC,"I still fail to see how being demonstrably better than the season before is ""almost"" regressing.  The term, by definition, precludes improvement.  I'm glad you mentioned he's the same age as Fillip Forsberg though because there was only one other 20 year old who scored more points than Chucky; if being the top three point scorers for players his age (from a notoriously low scoring team no less) doesn't meet your expectations, I think that says more about you than it does him."

Habs,3apewo,jo_maka,-3,Mon Jun 22 20:44:11 2015 UTC,"Of course they do. But we're talking about a contract negotiation, not a merger or any other of the multitude of mutually beneficial business deals where personal relationships matter. Personal relationships are, in my opinion, a hinderance when it comes to negotiating. Maybe you should care whether I run a business or not since you've made it embarrassingly clear you haven't a clue what your talking about."

Are we talking about hiring a coach whose at the end of his contract and free to take offers from anywhere? No. Jesus. Again, OF COURSE personal relationships in business are crucial. We are talking here about a contract negotiation where the players negotiating rights are restricted to the canadiens and as someone already pointed out, 2 parties with opposing interests getting as much for their respective clients as possible (ie the agent for the player and  and the GM for the team). If chuckys agent leaves money on the table because he's doing bergevin a solid cause they golf together on the weekend, then he should be fired. Are we on the same page yet?

Yes Subban have a big contract, which is deserved, but the bridge deal was still the way to go IMO. It showed that MB have guts, that he won't get walked over by a rookie and that if Subban wanted to win big bucks, he had to earn it. It made a better player and a better leader out of Subban.  The only ''bad'' contract he gave was to Daniel Brière and Doug Murray, and it had little to no impact on the cap. Murray was a 1 year deal and MB managed to trade Briere for PAP, which is not the best player ever but still better than Briere"

So that's four bad contracts.  Price is a bargain now, but at the time, as he was one of the best, but not the best goaltender in the league, it was pretty fair value. Pekka Rinne, pretty comparable back then, got 7 millions a year later.  We'll have to wait to judge Gallagher. It seems good, but not a steal.

Habs,3as289,Funkenbrain,3,Tue Jun 23 15:20:06 2015 UTC,"If there was ever a draft called the ""take the best player available"" draft this is the one. IMO if Kylington (24) is at 26 when we step up, take him, if Merkley falls to 26 (17) you take him, if Svechnikov falls to 26 (18) you take him. This is a very simple draft. To have success in. Same goes with Bittner, and Guryanov. Any of those guys would be great. Ideally if we landed one of Svechnikov, Merkley, or Kylington, we've hit a huge success on draft day.   And it's not crazy for a guy like Meier or even Zboril to fall. It's not likely, but if it were to happen, holy shit. Sherbak fell from 17-18 to 26 last year, and Kapanen fell from 12th to 22nd...

Habs,3alxzr,Corazu,0,Mon Jun 22 19:38:04 2015 UTC,From the numbers it seems more likely that both Eller and Galchenyuk were carried by Gallagher to some extent.
Habs,3alxzr,Fenrir,3,Mon Jun 22 04:20:24 2015 UTC,"Eller is our best possession guy, puts up more than average 3rd line center stats (correct me if I'm wrong)  and he shit line mates. If Chucky and Eller take the 1-2 positions, we won't need desharnais or plekanec anymore, easy 8.5 mill off our cap space, which can go towards a 1st line right winger (who would take parenteau place which is another 4 mill of our cap space) and a 2nd line left winger. Eller being a second liner would help our team in cap space wise, so much."
Habs,3alxzr,LegendaryWolfee,3,Sun Jun 21 16:47:44 2015 UTC,"Good possesion stats does not mean offence. I'm not saying that he's not a good player, just that personally I beleive that he's not a top 6 player.  Cap wise, is it a good move to replace Plekanec by Eller, yes. But I think it would be a downgrade over Plekanec"
Habs,3alxzr,Gabroux,6,Sun Jun 21 16:53:20 2015 UTC,"True, but given his likelihood of starting shifts in the D zone, good possession stats are harder to come by, given the dump-chase system."
Habs,3alxzr,HammerOfTheSlobs,2,Sun Jun 21 19:30:57 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, stats wise, plekanec has shown to be a good player, not taking that away from him at all, same with desharnais, but Eller is a bigger, younger, cheaper plekanec. And it's not hard to have good stats playing with paciorrety, galchenyuk, Gallagher.

Habs,3alxzr,LegendaryWolfee,2,Sun Jun 21 17:12:40 2015 UTC,That's 12.5 mill just by giving Lars Eller a spot up a line. And that's not considering moving Tinordi and pateryn up to the 3rd line pairing for the defence
Habs,3alxzr,LegendaryWolfee,-1,Sun Jun 21 16:49:41 2015 UTC,"i don't get people who say Eller has good offensive skills.  In todays NHL you need to move the puck, and you need to move it fast.  If you take a close look at Eller, you will see that tiam and time and time again, when he gets the puck from his D, he has open line to a winger, but does not pass because he always keep the puck for a second or two, and by that time, it's too late, the opening is gone.  he drives me mad doing it all the time.  Eller has size, speed, he is good on one on one battle, and has decent hands.  But for me, he need to either be moved to the wing, or be a number three center at best, cause he is not feeding his winger fast enough to make them produce."

For fun let's just ignore Eller because thats an entirely different discussion.  Toews could be considered a centre with size - he's 6'2"" and 210 lbs. He plays a lot heavier then either of our centres. MB has never really defined ""big centre"" before but the immediate answers aren't on our team or in Hamilton. I think he just means he wants a 2 way centre that can play on the top line and is heavy enough to push people around, cycle the puck, etc."

Habs,3akfho,Muter91,2,Sun Jun 21 17:37:19 2015 UTC,They dont think he will resign and there short a few picks this year
Habs,3akfho,quadriplegic_cheetah,2,Sun Jun 21 03:56:27 2015 UTC,Sorry but. Re-sign*. Resign by definitions means quit.   I would definitely be interested in acquiring him. Solid offensive player and fills a positional need. As an almost PPG player he would probably command at least 6M in FA when his contract runs out so it would be hard to re-sign him after this year but he could be a nice rental.
Habs,3akfho,TheMoonPrune,1 point,Sun Jun 21 04:52:50 2015 UTC,"The problem is he would be a rental. We would somehow have to convince him to stay or it really wouldn't be worth it IMO. And if we don't keep him, what we give out will have to be not that much."
Habs,3akfho,Gabroux,1 point,Sun Jun 21 02:52:21 2015 UTC,"Well we convinced Petry and Mitchell to stay, people like playing in Montreal, I think he would re-sign."
Habs,3akfho,mvasey29,1 point,Sun Jun 21 13:11:16 2015 UTC,"Mitchell is from Greenfield Park, pretty sure it was easy to convince him"
Habs,3akfho,sageram,1 point,Sun Jun 21 15:11:47 2015 UTC,And Petry played for Edmonton before. So I think it was pretty easy for him as well.
Habs,3akfho,TenMinutesToDowntown,1 point,Mon Jun 22 13:16:34 2015 UTC,"As someone who watches a good ammount of Islander games, he is big, strong and can score but he never seems to reach his full potential. I think he tries to do too much, or at least has in the past. And yes, With someone like JT, he doesn't have to be the playmaker which could be part of why he has done so much better with JT. But then everyone does better with JT."
Habs,3akfho,MessageBoard,1 point,Sun Jun 21 12:59:10 2015 UTC,"I'm a big fan of Okposo. I'd love him on the team for the right price. I imagine the Isles would want A LOT for him, though."
Habs,3akfho,Soutael,0,Sun Jun 21 15:41:00 2015 UTC,Keep in mind he plays with Tavares. He was struggling to be a 40-50 point player in his career before being moved there.  I'd love to have him but would be weary of overpaying. Even Parenteau/Moulson were 70 point wingers with Tavares.
Habs,3akfho,djohnston02,2,Sun Jun 21 11:39:41 2015 UTC,He also just turned 27. So he was like younger putting up those numbers.
Habs,3akfho,SiegeWar,-5,Sun Jun 21 14:27:15 2015 UTC,Taveres makes him look good. like Bozak or DD or ..... Alex Semin.
Habs,3akfho,appzb,8,Sun Jun 21 02:05:54 2015 UTC,"No, he's genuinely good"
Habs,3akfho,SiegeWar,0,Sun Jun 21 02:10:31 2015 UTC,"Probably, but good enough to warrant re-signing at $5 million + per year? That I don't believe. He's good but his numbers suggest he's better than he is."
Habs,3akfho,appzb,3,Sun Jun 21 03:32:05 2015 UTC,Petry is getting 5+ per year.  Okposo is a big guy who can hit and score.
Habs,3akfho,Soutael,0,Sun Jun 21 03:41:59 2015 UTC,"Haha no one's disputing that, I'm just saying Okposo wouldn't be worth the kind of money he and his agent can negotiate, especially in our current cap situation. It'd be the kind of deal that Sharp's contract is to the Hawks currently. Don't get me wrong, Okposo would help us for sure but I just think we'd have to shed a fair bit of salary to make it work, and even then I'm not sold it's all worth it, particularly as Price and Pacioretty, and perhaps some others, are going to get raises in a couple years. Of course my calculus changes if MB unloads PAP and/or Emelin..."
Habs,3aj326,fatneszsebby,10,Sat Jun 20 18:05:10 2015 UTC,"There is nothing to be gained by trading him now. We dont need to get rid of his contract, he is at his lowest value, and hasnt even had a chance to play a ahl game even. It is stupid to write him off at his age especially for a goalie"
Habs,3aj326,bsaures,8,Sat Jun 20 19:14:29 2015 UTC,Right now I think we're too late or too early. Goalies are tricky. At this point we'd be better off developing him to be the best he can be so we'd have more options in the future.
Habs,3aj326,jo_maka,4,Sat Jun 20 20:18:32 2015 UTC,"If someone overvalues him then trade him. Otherwise, let him grow in our system. If he develops into a number one goalie, that just means Montreal has two #1s. Goalies don't have a lot of value on the market anymore."
Habs,3aj326,aaronwrotkowski,1 point,Sat Jun 20 19:44:49 2015 UTC,"Goalies don't have a lot of value on the market anymore.    I agreed with every thing you said, but this , i hear it often. Why? I mean Schneider was never a proven as a number one, yet was traded for a top prospect, Miller was traded for a big price also. I know that goaltender are the most unpredictable position in the game but i dont think its right to say that they dont have value anymore."
Habs,3aj326,Julien_fucke_bouzzin,1 point,Sun Jun 21 08:56:53 2015 UTC,"They have some value but not a lot. You can of course find examples like Colorado paying the Flames a second round pick for a backup goalie, or Varlamov costing a first round pick. But even the Miller trade was because it was a deadline deal, included Steve Ott and Buffalo got Jaroslav Halak an his salary back, whom they flipped. If you go through the last 20 goalie trades, you'll see that they rarely get the same kind of value a forward or defenceman would get."
Habs,3aj326,aaronwrotkowski,1 point,Sun Jun 21 14:09:12 2015 UTC,"Is it more because their isnt a lot of goaler with high value more than they value les on the market? If there is mlrr forwards, there gonna be more good forwards, wich are gonna get traded, for high price. I mean i think a top goalie is worth the same as another top player and vice versa."
Habs,3aj326,Julien_fucke_bouzzin,8,Sun Jun 21 17:44:54 2015 UTC,"Trading him right now would be insane. Goalies take the longest to develop of any position. On average, they don't hit their prime until 27. For Fucs, that would put Price at 34 years old. Unless Price pulls a Brodeur/Hasek, he'll start to decline then. Also gives Fucale plenty of time to develop. Why not keep our options open, instead of pulling a ""he had one bad year in the QMJHL, trade him!!"""
Habs,3aj326,Strifezard,6,Sat Jun 20 18:59:01 2015 UTC,Price was an NHL starter since he was 20 though
Habs,3aj326,SiegeWar,10,Sat Jun 20 22:55:10 2015 UTC,"Price is Carey Fuckin' Price though.  Generational talents don't happen often, so let's be glad we have him and hope Fucale becomes good enough!"
Habs,3aj326,Kartias,3,Sat Jun 20 23:15:48 2015 UTC,"Although we sing his praise almost on a weekly basis, few understand how amazing it is to have such an anchor in the back. A decade of no worries in the nets is golden."

Habs,3aj326,HammerOfTheSlobs,1 point,Sun Jun 21 01:48:49 2015 UTC,Price wasn't an elite NHL goaltender until the last couple of years. Every goaltender needs time to develop
Habs,3aj326,mr_potroast,2,Sun Jun 21 01:28:17 2015 UTC,He's been elite since 2011 season when he got 38 wins.  That's about 23 years old
Habs,3aj326,SiegeWar,2,Sun Jun 21 01:43:50 2015 UTC,"Well, I mean, it all depends on how we define elite. Is elite top half of starters? Is it top 5? Indisputable top 3?  Definition of elite will change from one perspective to the next, but heck, we have one elite player per position at this point, and I don't think anyone can dispute that!"
Habs,3aj326,Kartias,1 point,Sun Jun 21 02:29:36 2015 UTC,"Which he followed up with an ordinary season and a crappy season. Having one good year doesn't make you elite. And having a crappy season doesn't mean you can never become elite (as Price proves), so this all means that we don't need to give up on Fucale just yet"
Habs,3aj326,mr_potroast,2,Sun Jun 21 15:45:47 2015 UTC,Having one bad year does not make you ordinary
Habs,3aj326,SiegeWar,11,Sun Jun 21 17:47:15 2015 UTC,I'd Trade Torkaski  before  I would trade Fucale. He reminds me of a Young Price just give Fucale Time. If Price ever wanted to leave Montreal I would want Fucale not Torkaski
Habs,3aj326,Slushyfarts,9,Sat Jun 20 18:27:31 2015 UTC,What exactly makes Fucale anywhere close to Price? He's had nothing resembling his career statistics wise
Habs,3aj326,Doc460,2,Sat Jun 20 20:22:32 2015 UTC,"/u/Slushyfarts's comment is even more funny when you compare Fucale, Price and Tokarski's records. Price and Tokarski's accolades are nearly identical. Toks however is a much more conventional goaltender."
Habs,3aj326,IBoris,-1,Sat Jun 20 23:22:05 2015 UTC,Oh yeah...  ...it's like they're identical twins.  /S
Habs,3aj326,HammerOfTheSlobs,0,Sun Jun 21 01:52:20 2015 UTC,"Fucale is a great goalie, no doubt, but aside from the Olympic experience (and the U18/U17, but then Toks has the Memorial cup which Price does not have so even Steven in my book), Tokarski has won at every level Price has won.   Tokarski has the pedigree of a starting goalie and on any other team save for the Habs, NYR, Preds, Pens and one or two others, Toks would undoubtebly either be the starter on weaker teams or fighting to be the starter on middle of the pack teams. His smaller size (5""11 vs. Fucale's 6""1 btw) would be the only thing preventing him from being an unquestionable starter on all but the top teams.  Fucale is still young and its unsure where he'll land. He's much more of a gamble. That being said, in fairness to him, his performance in the QJMHL is noteworthy and better than Price or Tokarski as the QJMHL is widely regarded as a scorer's league.  That being said, in all fairness to our lord and savior, Price has performed at a higher level than Tokarski during the events they have in common (which goes back to my comment that Tokarski is a more conventional goaltender vis-à-vis Price; Fucale is too young to tell).

Habs,3aj326,IBoris,2,Sun Jun 21 08:32:01 2015 UTC,"I hate this kind of question. As a rookie, and until he makes his mark, he has very little trade value unless it's to a GM that fell in love with him for some odd reason. Good GMs won't do that. Bad GMs get fired. I think the only train wreck is still in philly, the other ones got shafted.   He doesn't cost anything cap wise, every year is an opportunity for him to develop and increase trade value or become useful to the team. This team is very wealthy, they can afford to keep the cupboards full.   Most goalies take a while to develop anyhow. Let's put this to rest."
Habs,3aj326,eriverside,3,Sun Jun 21 02:39:27 2015 UTC,"I always liked Fucale, everyone expects price to be exactly how he is till he is 40, brodeur started to fall when he was 35. So I would love to keep him for a just in case situation.  But if we had to trade him, it would be towards a team ""just""  starting to rebuild  (Toronto, etc)"
Habs,3aj326,LegendaryWolfee,3,Sat Jun 20 18:45:26 2015 UTC,Price is 27 so by the time he's 35 Fucale will be 28
Habs,3aj326,SiegeWar,10,Sat Jun 20 19:04:58 2015 UTC,Rather be in Ottawas situation with their goalies rather than Edmonton.
Habs,3aj326,LegendaryWolfee,2,Sat Jun 20 19:11:30 2015 UTC,I would trade tokarski and keep fucale as a backup
Habs,3aj326,rednuck,2,Sat Jun 20 18:18:16 2015 UTC,"Fucale is no where near ready for an nhl backup role, he has never played an ahl game even. why trade the cheapest backup that we will find for someone who will not develop and will sit for 65 games this year?"
Habs,3aj326,tinran,-4,Sat Jun 20 19:48:53 2015 UTC,tokarski does need to be moved. Either sent down to the AHL or traded for a 1/2 bag o pucks
Habs,3aj326,MustardTiger1337,6,Sat Jun 20 21:05:36 2015 UTC,Why? He is what we need. A super low payed guy to start 15 games so Price can have a little bit of a break during the season.

Habs,3aj326,Gabroux,1 point,Sat Jun 20 18:36:51 2015 UTC,"As much as I love Fucale, trade him in a package and draft a top prospect goalie this or next year"
Habs,3aj326,bearshiit,2,Sat Jun 20 18:44:59 2015 UTC,"What do you consider a ""top prospect"" goalie? Fucale was the first goalie picked in his draft year (36th in 2013), with a Memorial Cup under his belt and a final as well. Not many goalies have been to the show at all, let alone with a win and a final. The 2014 draft's first goalie picked was 34th overall. The last time a goalie was picked in the first round was Malcolm Subban, 24th by the Bruins. I don't think he's exactly tearing up the league in the AHL. It's way to early to write off Fucale. Look at Price himself! He had his share of struggles before Waite became his coach."
Habs,3aj326,HammerOfTheSlobs,1 point,Sun Jun 21 02:05:45 2015 UTC,He had much lower than average stats in the Q and no goalie has made the NHL with stats like his coming out of the Q. Trade him. Include him in a package. Whatever. He sucks.
Habs,3aj326,Muter91,1 point,Sun Jun 21 03:21:40 2015 UTC,"Despite a rough end to his junior career it is waay to early to tell how good or bad he'll be.  Even if he had ended winning the cup, I would have been on the fence about him.  The facts are:   He won't be playing for us as our #1 - probably ever. He had a bad end to his Jr career - so his stock price is down.   We should hold onto him for a year, let him play in the A and see if he develops.  His stock really can't get much worse at this point, and if he starts to shine - trade him.    He's not Price, and probably never will be.  We're better off trading him when he works his stock price back up."
Habs,3aj326,hkycoach,1 point,Sun Jun 21 03:39:49 2015 UTC,Prospect goalies aren't worth much on the trade block anyway. Not worth trading. They take long to develop and there's hardly any way to know if they'll end up NHL starter good this early.
Habs,3aj326,Fabien_Lamour,0,Sun Jun 21 09:56:55 2015 UTC,"Trade him. Mike Condon will make the Habs before he does. Price isn't going anywhere, so he's never going to play.  I also think he's a bit of a bust so trading him now while the potential is there is probably our best bet."

Habs,3aj326,BinaryChode,-2,Sat Jun 20 20:05:25 2015 UTC,"Trade him, he's a bit too old as he will overlap with price, and as long as price is price, he will be the starter for a while (Fucale would be at least 28-30 before he gets a chance over Price)... Fucale had a pretty bad season and not a great memorial cup from what I saw... His value has severely dropped from when he was drafted... I still think if we package him up with some pieces to an Edmonton, we can get a decent return"

Habs,3aj326,Razorback101,3,Sat Jun 20 18:33:59 2015 UTC,So you want us to trade him while his value is in the gutter? I'm sure we can package him with Emelin as well and get Ovechkin in exchange amirite?
Habs,3aj326,IBoris,-1,Sat Jun 20 18:45:13 2015 UTC,"I'm saying trade him before his value drops forever... I do not think he is a franchise goalie and I don't think his value will raise higher than it is... The only reason he looked so good in his first years in junior is because of the team he had infront of him (Mackinnon, Drouin, Ehlers etc.)... The longer they wait, the lower his value will become"
Habs,3aj326,Razorback101,1 point,Sat Jun 20 20:16:56 2015 UTC,"Well, if you look at his playoff stats from this year, he was back to his usual SV% and (almost) GAA numbers. Sure, he had a rough start in Halifax, and getting traded can cause a period of adjustment (look at Petry) but his troubles this year could be for any number of reasons. It really is too early to tell; he could have a great camp and make a place for himself in the AHL next year. Who knows?"

Edit: If there is someone on the Bruins I would target, it would be Reilly Smith. Young, skilled, cheap.

Habs,3afap1,bsaures,0,Sat Jun 20 02:24:48 2015 UTC,A 2nd and gilbert. They are up * * * *  creek cap wise atm and teams know it so no team is going to give anything  close to face value.
Habs,3afap1,Alfr_d,-2,Fri Jun 19 18:45:40 2015 UTC,"We don't have a second to give.  Tinordi, Fucale, and a Third"
Habs,3afap1,zeMVK,1 point,Fri Jun 19 19:34:42 2015 UTC,"No way! We need to send a contract the other way otherwise we're going to be in cap Hell. And that's without counting Galchenyuk's contract that still needs to be signed.  I'm not trading two prospects and a pick to a team that needs to trade Sharp for cap space. Especially since it would put us in their situation.  They'll have to take a bad contract back, just one that won't cost as much as Sharp and they would probably prefer one that will be short term.   If some other team wants to do a similar trade as yours with their prospects. Then by all means, let them take Sharp. We can't afford to take on Sharp and not send a contract the other way. Giving soo many low cost assets is not in our favor."
Habs,3afap1,Alfr_d,0,Fri Jun 19 20:54:46 2015 UTC,"Then... Parenteau? Not as costly for them, an improvement for us. If we're going to clear cap space, it's not going to happen in a Sharp trade period."
Habs,3afap1,zeMVK,1 point,Fri Jun 19 21:08:51 2015 UTC,"I don't think Parenteau would be cheap enough for them to want. They'd save about 1.9 mill. Maybe Gilbert. But, we'd need to make another trade in order to re-sign Galchenyuk, if we trade Gilbert."
Habs,3afap1,Julien_fucke_bouzzin,0,Fri Jun 19 21:13:47 2015 UTC,"Lol lets get superstar against an unproven defencemen, a really unproven as fuck goalie who dont have a single ahl game AND a third. We are not in your be a GM dinasty on NHL 15 bro."
Habs,3afap1,Alfr_d,1 point,Sun Jun 21 09:12:51 2015 UTC,Sharp's an againg top 6 forward whose contract is the sole reason Chicago is trading him. They aren't taking costly players in exchange.
Habs,3afap1,Julien_fucke_bouzzin,1 point,Mon Jun 22 01:14:12 2015 UTC,This doesnt mean you can offer them a pile of shit pal. Sharp had  78points season last year.
Habs,3afap1,Alfr_d,1 point,Mon Jun 22 04:31:14 2015 UTC,"My offer may be light, but you're delusional if you think the Blackhawks are getting anything remotely close to Sharp's value for him.  Not only is it not possible, but given the circumstances, no team is going to make the Blackhawks an offer they'll love."
Habs,3afap1,Julien_fucke_bouzzin,1 point,Mon Jun 22 12:44:44 2015 UTC,"I never said that. I said that someone like sharp will not be traded for 2 unproven prospect and a third round picks. Realisticaly, would you accept this offer as the black Hawks gm?"
Habs,3afap1,Alfr_d,1 point,Mon Jun 22 18:17:39 2015 UTC,"Realistically, I don't think the Habs can make a trade for Sharp. Like Chicago, we are very low on cap space, and all we'd have to give them are prospects, considering none of our top-6 forwards are probably cheap enough for them to want."
Habs,3afap1,quadriplegic_cheetah,-1,Mon Jun 22 18:23:43 2015 UTC,"A first and a prospect. I don't know what Chicago expects. They want to unload him as much as people want to take him. If they want to keep Saad, they better drop that price."
Habs,3afap1,Razorback101,2,Fri Jun 19 18:16:18 2015 UTC,"There is no way they are getting anything near a 1st for Sharp... They pretty much have to move him, they aren't in the driving seat"
Habs,3afap1,zeMVK,1 point,Fri Jun 19 20:07:03 2015 UTC,"For real, Chicago is in trouble cap wise. They want to trade Sharp so they can keep Saad, mainly. If they don't trade Sharp, they could lose Saad. This isn't the typical situation of ""Oh, we found a younger player to replace this one, so we're trying to get value"", it's more like ""Shit! We're over the cap and we need to sign this better player, we have to make room!""  No way are we trading a first without getting more in return. Plus, we're near the cap limit with still Galchenyuk to be re-signed. No way do we make a trade for Sharp without having one of our contracts go the other way."
Habs,3afap1,fatneszsebby,-3,Fri Jun 19 20:59:14 2015 UTC,"For the right Price, like /u/bsaures said Gilbert and a 2nd or something."
Habs,3af3av,hkycoach,1 point,Fri Jun 19 16:43:27 2015 UTC,"Management needs to take the opportunity that's been handed to them with price and find the missing pieces to the puzzle. The Montreal Canadiens are a playoff team but they are not a contender for the cup if that makes sense. Singing Petry should solidify some holes in our defence and will help out immensely.  The primary focus for this off season was to sign Petry I feel but now they really need to focus on finding a top 6 winger that can score aside from max, a true #1 centre and hopefully tweak some things with the breakout and push away from dump and chase.   Price is the foundation of this team right now, without him it's very obvious we would be pushing for a playoff spot every season."
Habs,3af2r3,hurray4kimchi,5,Fri Jun 19 16:39:24 2015 UTC,Id love Jumbo has a Hab but I don't what we'd have to give up for him.

Habs,3af2r3,Slushyfarts,2,Fri Jun 19 16:49:20 2015 UTC,I don't think we should trade Plekanec. I think it would hurt us. That's why I said I don't think we have the right people to trade for Jumbo
Habs,3af2r3,AlabamaLegsweep,2,Fri Jun 19 17:42:34 2015 UTC,"Plekanec is essentially Diet Logan Couture, and the Sharks are probably looking for some defensemen. I can't see a scenario where we get Joe Thornton and don't send Nathan Beaulieu+ back."
Habs,3af2r3,JPMoney81,1 point,Fri Jun 19 22:49:39 2015 UTC,San Jose would be looking to get young assets in return. I dont think Pleky fits that build. Eller perhaps? But then we would need to include more.
Habs,3af2r3,AlabamaLegsweep,1 point,Fri Jun 19 20:26:17 2015 UTC,"I don't think we need another playmaker. One guy I would be taking a good look at is M. Boedker in Arizona, I'm not sure if he's in the rebuilding plans over there and is exactly the type of guy we could use."

Habs,3afqf6,thefaber451,6,Fri Jun 19 22:36:08 2015 UTC,MRW I learned the price for Sharp and Kessel

Habs,3afqf6,BinaryChode,2,Fri Jun 19 21:49:36 2015 UTC,Now that the price is out there - no. Not worth it
Habs,3afqf6,paul_33,-1,Fri Jun 19 22:43:58 2015 UTC,"Problem is both teams are in cap troubles! The trade would need to include Parenteau. I'd say Parenteau, Tinordi + 2nd would be my best offer to the Hawks."
Habs,3afqf6,benoitloiselle,3,Fri Jun 19 21:16:47 2015 UTC,"That's...not even close to what the Hawks are gonna be looking for here.   I don't think the Habs really make sense as a trading partner for Sharp. Like you said, they're both looking for cap relief (though who isn't this year?) and the Habs aren't in a position to give up cheap young assets for an expensive (albeit talented) veteran."
Habs,3afqf6,BillyTenderness,2,Fri Jun 19 21:23:46 2015 UTC,"I don't know if that's necessarily true, to be honest. The Hawks may paint themselves into a corner if they ask for very much more in that kind of trade because of cap issues (they have others to unload, but Sharp is most likely the top of the list...). Now, I'm not saying that this exact trade will happen (I'm pretty sure their prospect pool is pretty good, especially defencemen), but maybe something along those lines. At the same timmmmeee.... I agree with you. Sharp isn't the solution, but, if Bergevin pulled off some magical shit... I wouldn't mind"
Habs,3afqf6,Lyver,1 point,Fri Jun 19 21:53:14 2015 UTC,"The Hawks aren't in a position to really decide. They'll take the best deal they get, but that's about it.  If they don't want to accept realistic offers than fine, fuck 'em, put down on offer sheet on Saad. I'm sure that will speed up the process."
Habs,3afqf6,quadriplegic_cheetah,1 point,Fri Jun 19 23:46:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah well, I'm pretty sure every team would love Sharp on their roster. So I guess, if the hawks want to resign Saad, they'll need to part ways with heavy cap hit players such as Sharp, and will accept the best offer made to them. But there may be a lot of good offers, and if the price is right we should pick him up. If not, let the others bid."

Habs,3adals,YellowRiv,3,Fri Jun 19 04:31:26 2015 UTC,The blues would be looking to make a hockey deal for him. That would mean top 6 winger for top 6 winger.  Not something we have in excess right now
Habs,3adals,Powdreams,4,Fri Jun 19 14:04:10 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't, a 55 point player who disappears in the playoffs. How does that improve our team? We already have those players."
Habs,3adals,BinaryChode,0,Fri Jun 19 06:58:28 2015 UTC,Offensive depth? That allows Gallagher/ Oshie to play on the second line instead of PAP.   Pacioretty - Desharnais - Gallagher  Galchenyuk - Plekanec - Oshie  Parenteau - Eller - Smith-Pelly   Is an actual top 9  However it depend on what they want in return
Habs,3adals,quadriplegic_cheetah,-1,Fri Jun 19 18:11:31 2015 UTC,"I think we would get rid of Paps in that trade, RW for RW. More like:  Patches - Chucky - Oshie (Or Gally, depends on preformance)  Davey - Pleky - Gally  JDLR - Larry - DSP  I think this would look great."
Habs,3adals,fatneszsebby,-1,Fri Jun 19 18:53:57 2015 UTC,"That's my ideal lineup, except switch Davey with Eller."

Habs,3adals,Staks,-3,Fri Jun 19 07:05:53 2015 UTC,Backes is a goof and he's a ghost in playoffs too. It looks good on paper but it wouldn't be a smart fit for us.
Habs,3adals,hank0,3,Fri Jun 19 07:41:36 2015 UTC,"How is he a ""goof""?  He's a fantastic 2 way player, can put up decent points, plays center AND right wing, is 220 pounds and is captain on a stacked team. I know all this from watching him play, not just ""what looks good on paper"". Either way I am not sure he would be a perfect fit. However, he is WAY ahead of Oshie in that regard.  Oshie on the otherhand is constantly overrated due to his good shoot-out performance during the olympics. Oshie even has LESS career playoff points in the same amount of games with a terrible +-. Despite +- being a terrible stat, Oshie has been known to make lazy backchecks so it's the best non-anecdotal evidence I can give you.  Edited some stuff for clarity."
Habs,3adals,Staks,1 point,Fri Jun 19 08:12:15 2015 UTC,"He's got a bad rep in the Western conference. Blues fans are split on him too. Like I said, he looks good on paper... He's entering the end of his prime and has had concussion problems. I feel the same about Oshie. Overrated."

Habs,3aa630,Kartias,10,Thu Jun 18 13:15:25 2015 UTC,People getting worked up about this is stupid. They have a ahl team too that had a lot of veteran turnover so theres no harm in signing him to a short cheap deal and sending him to the ahl if one of the prospects outplays him.
Habs,3aa630,bsaures,3,Thu Jun 18 15:14:16 2015 UTC,Even at that a Parenteau injury is what will get Andrighetto or Hudon called up. If Flynn is playing poorly or gets hurt it's Dumont or Bournival that gets called up.
Habs,3aa630,Kuciv,1 point,Thu Jun 18 15:20:13 2015 UTC,Anything under 900k can be hidden in St-Johns. But he'd have to hit waivers first.
Habs,3aa630,shiram,2,Thu Jun 18 15:18:56 2015 UTC,And if he gets claimed who cares we can always claim someone  else  if we have to. We need bodues just like any other  team so why not him.
Habs,3aa630,bsaures,3,Thu Jun 18 15:27:58 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying it's a bad thing, there is a contract limit to think of also. That said, I would think a 4th line of Prust Mitchell and De LaRose would have been quite sufficient. Potentially Bournival too, if they sign him."
Habs,3aa630,shiram,2,Thu Jun 18 15:29:36 2015 UTC,I dont agree with putting dlr on the 4th line unless its like last year where they gave him a legit 3rd line spot then when the playoffs  came they bumped him down to 4th becsuse the points werent there. The kid is only 20 not 24 so playing 8-10mins a night is a waste on his development when he could be doing 15-20 in the ahl for a year.
Habs,3aa630,bsaures,2,Thu Jun 18 15:33:07 2015 UTC,"Well sure, AHL, lost of TOI and special teams would do him good. On the Habs though, his skillset and play should relegate him to the 4th line, if we are to have any hope of a third line that can bring in some scoring.  Eller needs some help out there."
Habs,3aa630,shiram,2,Thu Jun 18 15:50:42 2015 UTC,A bit more scoring would be nice and should be easily attainable. People seem to think that because our offense was 23rd last year we are mile behind other teams but the reality is it was only 15 goals that separates us from being a top 10 offensive team. Basically with the lineup we had last year plus a functional powerplay and we vecome a great offensive team. Throw in an improvement over pap in the top 6 and we could be a top 5-7 team
Habs,3aa630,bsaures,16,Thu Jun 18 16:39:17 2015 UTC,I've been reading this sub for awhile now and I think I've worked out the ideal /r/habs 2015-16 roster:  Pacioretty-Galchenyuk-Gallagher  Thomas-McCarron-Andrighetto  Hudon-Dumont-Scherbak  Lehkonen-Audette-Reway  Tinordi-Subban  Beaulieu-Petry  Lernout-Pateryn  /s
Habs,3aa630,webu,2,Thu Jun 18 16:47:06 2015 UTC,Lol no way that would happen. That is ridiculous. Getting rid of nearly everyone.  Edit: Apparently I don't know what /s means.

Habs,3aa630,cheeselover42,6,Thu Jun 18 18:51:44 2015 UTC,People please understand he is not taking a spot from Andrighetto or Thomas or any other scoring prospect. They are not in the same column on the depth chart.
Habs,3aa630,Kuciv,4,Thu Jun 18 19:07:59 2015 UTC,"I think the other angle to take is that he'll be trade bait.  It would be silly to just let him walk when a qualifying offer for him is $726,000..."
Habs,3aa630,hkycoach,0,Thu Jun 18 15:16:30 2015 UTC,That's antiquated thinking. Nothing says you have to have scorers on your top two lines and grinders on your bottom two. Especially when you have guys who play well in both ends like Plekanec and Eller.
Habs,3aa630,r_slash,0,Thu Jun 18 17:50:21 2015 UTC,Sure he is

Habs,3aa630,Razorback101,0,Thu Jun 18 14:12:50 2015 UTC,I just don't see how having so many bottom 6 guys will fix the issue we have with scoring and the issue we have with developing younger guys.

Habs,3aa630,brahzoo,1 point,Thu Jun 18 14:42:45 2015 UTC,"I think we have many players who should continue to improve, Gally, Chucky, Bealieu (maybe DSP), along with players entering their prime (PK, Price, Patches). So most of the same team is not bad. I think many are expecting one trade for a second line forward."
Habs,3aa630,paul_33,1 point,Thu Jun 18 15:03:14 2015 UTC,Where is the room for someone like Andrighetto or Hudon to advance?
Habs,3aa630,bsaures,5,Thu Jun 18 15:10:42 2015 UTC,They will advanve when they beat those players for a spot. Case and point dlr last year when injuries came around he got in the lineup and took a spot. Same with pateryn.   Plus people often forget last year was nothing injury  wise we were by far the healthiest team so havinga couple extra nhl calibre players is valuable when injuries catch up to us.
Habs,3aa630,brahzoo,1 point,Thu Jun 18 15:16:27 2015 UTC,"exactly, its good to have some competition within especially for the bottom 6 players. When Andrighetto and Hudon are good enough, they will get their spot."
Habs,3aa630,Kuciv,5,Thu Jun 18 15:22:19 2015 UTC,Great plan! Let's scratch McCarron all year!

Habs,3aa9ra,paul_33,8,Thu Jun 18 18:16:59 2015 UTC,an incoming Plecky + 1st pick + Chucky trade   No. No one thinks this. Stop.
Habs,3aa9ra,BuddhasLittleWarlock,13,Thu Jun 18 20:11:55 2015 UTC,Trading Galchenyuk would be a monumental fuckup. I wouldn't worry because I doubt Bergevin is that stupid.
Habs,3aa9ra,MustardTiger1337,3,Thu Jun 18 14:47:36 2015 UTC,"Well, I mean, unless it brings in a relatively young 1st line Centerman it would be a fuck up."

Habs,3aa9ra,quadriplegic_cheetah,3,Thu Jun 18 18:43:38 2015 UTC,But you know that we'd give the best deal.
Habs,3aa9ra,BuddhasLittleWarlock,0,Fri Jun 19 05:18:19 2015 UTC,The return would have to be massive to make it worth the deal.
Habs,3aa9ra,ClassActDude,0,Thu Jun 18 17:26:30 2015 UTC,Agreed.
Habs,3aa9ra,Gabroux,5,Thu Jun 18 18:13:16 2015 UTC,"We all know as much as you do, but I wouldn't worry. Chuckie should sign a modest bridge deal, he'll look at PK and how he broke the bank after his bridge and hopefully that will be motivation for him to excel. Another thing to consider, all the players who have signed recently have all said it was a quick process with MB - I think we'll see a deal done by the end of the week. MB will want to know exactly how much space he has to work with heading into trades at the draft"
Habs,3aa9ra,Sehs,5,Thu Jun 18 14:42:26 2015 UTC,Montreal have 5+ millions in cap space with him and a depth forward to sign. It's fine
Habs,3aa9ra,Razorback101,2,Thu Jun 18 21:15:11 2015 UTC,Fairly sure he'll get signed. The only way I would accept trading a 1st and Chucky is if Malkin was the one coming back. So basically I doubt this will happen.
Habs,3aa9ra,PermanentlyObscene,2,Thu Jun 18 15:14:19 2015 UTC,Malkin gets injured though
Habs,3aa9ra,Djeece,1 point,Thu Jun 18 22:50:37 2015 UTC,i would rather have chucky anyways. in a few years malkin will start slowing down and chucky will be a fucking star
Habs,3aa9ra,Sharks9,3,Thu Jun 18 23:20:35 2015 UTC,"IMO, realistically, our cup window is until the end of Patches' and Price's contract, so 3-4 years.  I've always hated every trade proposal that includes Plecanek, but if a player like Malkin is available, you do everything you can to have him."
Habs,3aa9ra,Powdreams,2,Fri Jun 19 18:02:27 2015 UTC,"The fact that he's an RFA should be very reassuring, Bergevin is just focusing on getting the UFAs signed so he can see how much cap space he has before getting into negotiations with Chucky"
Habs,3aa9ra,jo_maka,2,Thu Jun 18 15:20:52 2015 UTC,"He will get bridged, something around 2 years and 4 million. Now if he's going to be playing center over dd,  that's the real question."
Habs,3aa9ra,Almostneverclever,2,Thu Jun 18 15:28:21 2015 UTC,Breathe in. Breathe out.  There is no rush. He's here. He ain't going nowhere.
Habs,3aa9ra,Funkenbrain,2,Thu Jun 18 16:12:26 2015 UTC,"He's RFA and so a qualifying offer will be made fairly soon, but MB won't worry about real negotiations with him until after he's finished with more immediate issues, like UFA's."
Habs,3aa9ra,Fabien_Lamour,1 point,Thu Jun 18 21:22:48 2015 UTC,"We've been resigning everyone else on schedule, and for great value, I'm not worried. 2 years at 3 million, or 5 for 5 should be just fine."
Habs,3a7kx6,LegendaryWolfee,13,Wed Jun 17 21:16:15 2015 UTC,Maybe we can trick Joe into thinking emelin is significant...
Habs,3a7kx6,Internazionale,7,Wed Jun 17 23:25:56 2015 UTC,Colorado's defense is not the greatest. I think he would add some value to their blue line.
Habs,3a7kx6,cheeselover42,2,Thu Jun 18 02:40:54 2015 UTC,"He really is decent just that we are flooding with D, and could use the cap space. Also Emelin still hits a lot. Look at the playoffs he still had a decent amount of hits, in playoffs hits help."
Habs,3a7kx6,brahzoo,3,Thu Jun 18 15:15:15 2015 UTC,"I like him a lot, don't even mind the cap hit, but the defenceman we'd have to give is bealieau and that's a no go for me"
Habs,3a7kx6,hurray4kimchi,3,Thu Jun 18 05:29:00 2015 UTC,We really need some scoring up front. You have to give up something.
Habs,3a7kx6,moonbooty,1 point,Thu Jun 18 13:37:12 2015 UTC,"Beaulieu vs ROR 1 for 1? I do the trade right away. Sure Beaulieu have potential, but we're talking about a top 6 player, ready who can spark up our offence which is our biggest need"
Habs,3a7kx6,Gabroux,1 point,Thu Jun 18 21:11:56 2015 UTC,"ROR has upside for sure, but he still scored less than 20 last year. Markov doesn't have much left, tinordi is unproven and Emelin would likely have to be given up to make the cap room to accommodate ROR. Doing this trade would leave our left side seriously deficient. Considering we're getting Bealieau for only $1 mill AAV and he's possibly our future 1LD, I dunno if this can work. Too any shades of McDonough for Gomez for my liking"
Habs,3a7kx6,hurray4kimchi,2,Thu Jun 18 21:44:26 2015 UTC,"I will be honest with you, I don't buy the Beaulieu's hype. We are talking about an offensive defencemen who scored 13 points in 87 games in his career. It's not bad, but it's not incredible either. I don't think that he will become a top 2 in a team, more of a 3rd-4th defencemen. It's how I see him.  Also comparing ROR to Gomez is unfair IMO. ROR have more upside than Gomez who was just a passing machine. ROR can shoot, pass, have a good 2 way game and never take penalties. Also he's a center and a winger. The only thing I don't like about him is the contract problems. Since MB is big on him, I guess that he have a plan for him. So again a top 6 player vs a potential top 4 defencemen is a trade that I would make"
Habs,3a7kx6,Gabroux,0,Thu Jun 18 23:56:55 2015 UTC,We give up Beaulieu and we have Tinordi to take his place as the shutdown defenseman
Habs,3a7kx6,BuddhasLittleWarlock,1 point,Thu Jun 18 14:59:35 2015 UTC,"Tinordi is far from proven, especially as a second liner. Plus we'd need him to take Emelin's spot (assuming we get rid of him to clear the cap room). Also o Reilly would be a UFA next year and there's no guarantee he'd resign"
Habs,3a7kx6,hurray4kimchi,-1,Thu Jun 18 16:32:26 2015 UTC,"I think Tinordi is capable of taking Emelin's time, he just needs to work on his skating a little more."
Habs,3a7kx6,BuddhasLittleWarlock,1 point,Thu Jun 18 18:12:38 2015 UTC,Me too but he's not a substitute for bealieau
Habs,3a7kx6,hurray4kimchi,2,Thu Jun 18 18:35:49 2015 UTC,"No, they're two different types of player. Tinordi's your stay-at-home shutdown Defenseman, and Beaulieu's a Puck-moving playmaking Defenseman. Tinordi could be a great 5-6 D and work the Penalty kill, but not much else. Beaulieu's the kind of guy that you want on your power play."
Habs,3a7kx6,BuddhasLittleWarlock,2,Thu Jun 18 18:38:10 2015 UTC,Agree
Habs,3a7kx6,hurray4kimchi,2,Thu Jun 18 18:43:56 2015 UTC,I don't think it's worth it unless there is a guarantee he will sign with us.
Habs,3a7kx6,Muter91,1 point,Thu Jun 18 01:01:34 2015 UTC,Im sure he would sign.
Habs,3a7kx6,fatneszsebby,1 point,Thu Jun 18 01:16:22 2015 UTC,What makes you so sure? We have no reason to believe he would sign with us.
Habs,3a7kx6,Muter91,1 point,Thu Jun 18 18:34:18 2015 UTC,Bergiven loves him. I read up and we have tried multiple times to acquire him. Im sure the wizard would sign him.
Habs,3a7kx6,fatneszsebby,1 point,Thu Jun 18 18:45:07 2015 UTC,Okay so that's one side. Maybe O'reilly wants to choose his own fate and go to UFA
Habs,3a7kx6,Muter91,1 point,Thu Jun 18 18:55:26 2015 UTC,"Possibly. I only know as much as you, so I am not %100 where he would go. But I believe quite strongly that he would sign."
Habs,3a7kx6,fatneszsebby,1 point,Thu Jun 18 18:57:18 2015 UTC,"And you have nothing to back that up. I could say I believe he'll fly to the moon and it holds just as much water has you saying you're sure he will sign.   Anyway, if there is a guarantee he will sign for a fair price I would love to have him. If not, he wouldn't be worth the assets for only one year of his services."
Habs,3a7kx6,Muter91,2,Thu Jun 18 19:22:49 2015 UTC,"Would be a great upgrade over dd but could cost us. Also,  he might walk after his contract is done."
Habs,3a7kx6,Powdreams,1 point,Thu Jun 18 15:30:36 2015 UTC,"I would like him, trade Plekanecs and something for him. But his cap is just million too much. Maybe depending what we get rid of. But I think a top 6 winger is needed more then basically what is a younger more offensive Plekanecs."
Habs,3a7kx6,fatneszsebby,4,Wed Jun 17 23:40:44 2015 UTC,they are looking to bolster their blueline. we don't have anything they need

Habs,3a7kx6,fatneszsebby,1 point,Thu Jun 18 00:19:13 2015 UTC,"Sounds pretty good, maybe a bit more but he is not what we need."
Habs,3a7kx6,PermanentlyObscene,2,Thu Jun 18 00:25:54 2015 UTC,"Probably, but MB is a fan of O'Reilly, almost drafted him, and tried to trade for him, etc. Wouldn't be to surprised if a few months later we hear he almost traded for him again."
Habs,3a7kx6,fatneszsebby,2,Thu Jun 18 00:30:41 2015 UTC,Especially since the Avs and canadiens have a Decent trade partnership
Habs,3a7kx6,brahzoo,4,Thu Jun 18 00:43:07 2015 UTC,I think his cap hit is too much for what he brings to the table. and I think they are looking for a single significant player. not a bunch of mediocre talent
Habs,3a7kx6,fatneszsebby,1 point,Thu Jun 18 00:48:00 2015 UTC,"You are right, but if we are to trade for him it would most definitely include Pleky, near same value (I might be wrong), and we already have too many Cmen."
Habs,3a7kx6,ABillyGoat,1 point,Thu Jun 18 01:19:32 2015 UTC,"maybe, but it already is hard to find a 55-64 pt/season player, especially one who is young and has room to improve."
Habs,3a7kx6,fatneszsebby,1 point,Thu Jun 18 15:19:25 2015 UTC,"Not to be cocky or anything, but is there proof of this. I mean I would love him instead of Pleky (I love turneck Pleks) but his cap hit is just a slight bit too high. But hopefully your right!"

Habs,3a7kx6,ABillyGoat,1 point,Thu Jun 18 21:13:44 2015 UTC,"Really? My apologies then. Would be great if so. Maybe not trade Pleky for him, maybe Tinner with a package of picks and another prospect?"
Habs,3a51wn,jshare,24,Wed Jun 17 07:50:31 2015 UTC,"It's a good read. That quote made me ""aww"". I hope pleky and marky retire as Habs. There's been lots of rumors about trading them for cap space. They make sense, but i'm attached to these two. I would hate to see them leave."
Habs,3a51wn,zeMVK,18,Wed Jun 17 08:52:08 2015 UTC,"I'd also like to see them retire Habs but I care more about them getting to parade down 'the usual route' with PK and Carey.

Habs,3a51wn,slayeryouth,6,Wed Jun 17 09:00:45 2015 UTC,"From a cap perspective it makes sense, but my immediate reaction to talk of trading them is still scratching my head at the idea of a team that has trouble generating offence trading away their second and fourth top point scorers."
Habs,3a51wn,prplx,16,Wed Jun 17 16:44:29 2015 UTC,"I like the guy.  They pointed out in La Presse yesterday that for all the flack he gets, Plecky score one more goal then Phil Kessel last season."
Habs,3a51wn,KarlPilkingtonsBrain,14,Wed Jun 17 12:03:39 2015 UTC,All the while being one of the better (and possibly most underrated) defensive forwards in the NHL.
Habs,3a51wn,axepig,7,Wed Jun 17 16:43:46 2015 UTC,"Definitely one of the most underrated player, he puts up the same amount of points as Bergeron and while Bergeron is considered a top 3 defensive forward Pleky has never been nominated to the Selke IIRC"
Habs,3a51wn,Backfire16,2,Thu Jun 18 00:01:06 2015 UTC,This was also Kessel's worst season since 2007. These are not typical Phil numbers.
Habs,3a51wn,prplx,3,Wed Jun 17 21:57:18 2015 UTC,"I know that,  On the other hand, I think people tend to overestimate Kessel's record as well.  Many people would be surprised to hear he never had a 40 goals season.  Actually, his best is 37, 2 less then Patch's best."

Brendan Gallagher, Alex Galchenyuk, and Tomas Plekanec are our 3 other top-6 calibre forwards but since we only have 4 total we end up playing David Desharnais (5'9 center) and a rotating cast of wingers as other 2 members of the top-6.  We do have some good forward prospects though but for now we're hoping that our GM Marc Bergevin does something to address our offense during this off-season."

Habs,3a6zrv,Funkenbrain,12,Wed Jun 17 21:08:19 2015 UTC,"Hey there, welcome to the fanbase! Many people may seem negative or overly critical, but that's really just the passion speaking since we want to be the very best!  The current edition of the team is probably the best since we won our last Stanley Cup way back in 1993, and things are really looking up! Our team can be defined as young speedy team entering its prime, having the best goaltender in the league in the 27 year old Carey Price. A calm concentrated fellow, he is the true leader of the team and our success starts with him.  On defense, we have PK Subban, an explosive player that is one of the best in the league, with a powerful slapshot, but he is also good on dekes and spinoramas. He can score beautiful goals, but is also very sound defensively. The other key member of our defense is Andrei Markov, an old Russian veteran that has been with us since the early 2000s. Other members of our defense include Jeff Petry, just signed and played great in the playoffs, Alexei Emelin (he hits hard!), Tom Gilbert (better than many would say), and our youngsters Nathan Beaulieu, Greg Pateryn and Jarred Tinordi that are making their way into the team.  Next on offense, it all starts with our all-star Max Pacioretty. He is one of the best goal-producers in the league, and plays great no matter where he's at! Many see him as our next captain, as goalies can't be captain. Next we have our turtleneck hero (cause he always wears a turtleneck), Tomas Plekanec! Great center that can score, has been on the team second longest. The two other important forwards are Alex Galchenyuk (Chucky) and Brendan Gallagher (Gally), two youngsters that keep improving. Chucky has the potential to be an elite first-line center, and has the best dekes on the team. Gally is an in-your-face type a guy that never stops pushing, you'll love him. Everyone does.   Probably could spend a bit more time on forwards, but I want to speak a bit of our history. We have 24 stanley cups. That is a lot. Like, a ridiculous amount. We are very proud of our history, and have had some of the best players and teams in the league. Some historical figures you probably need to learn about are Maurice ""Rocket"" Richard, Jean Beliveau, Guy Lafleur and Patrick Roy, which have all helped bring Stanley Cups to our teams across the century.  Anyhow, if you have any questions, ask away!"

It would take too long for the goalie to talk to the referees all the time, and would cause too many unscheduled timeouts. So yea, since the 40s, no goalie has been officially captain."

Habs,3a391h,fatneszsebby,-8,Wed Jun 17 20:15:32 2015 UTC,"I would sign Vermette, then trade plecky, dd or Eller with our first + prospect + enelin or Gilbert for a high top 6 winger.  Vermette is one of the best 3rd line center (great defensively, can put point and very quick). But on our team he would be 2nd or 1st line center."
Habs,3a391h,sex_panther_by_odeon,10,Wed Jun 17 00:32:30 2015 UTC,But on our team he would be 2nd or 1st line center.   Lol no. Eller is better than Vermette. Pretty sure Eller had more ES points than Vermette despite being saddled with grinders and being buried in the defensive zone.
Habs,3a391h,Muter91,5,Wed Jun 17 00:39:42 2015 UTC,First I have to say that I see no purpose in trading Plekanec for Vermette when Pleks is better both offensively and defensively (and Vermette will likely grab more than Pleky's $5mill)...but in no way is Eller better than Vermette. That's not even close lol.
Habs,3a391h,Plekanick,0,Wed Jun 17 03:46:27 2015 UTC,Prove it.
Habs,3a391h,Muter91,0,Wed Jun 17 03:49:04 2015 UTC,"Well, I mean Eller gets 25-30pts a season while Vermette doubles that regularly. That's a very basic way of looking at it, but you can only blame line mates and defensive zone starts so much before you realize that the guy just isn't a point-getter."
Habs,3a391h,Plekanick,3,Wed Jun 17 14:05:19 2015 UTC,"Vermette had one more even strength point than Eller. Despite playing with his teams best offensive players, playing five more games, and getting primarily offensive zone starts.  Still waiting for you to bring something substantial to the table."
Habs,3a391h,Muter91,0,Wed Jun 17 14:10:26 2015 UTC,"The thing is that your sign vermette and trade a package for a good winger. Yes the 1 for 1 trade off of Plecky , DD or Eller for Vermette may not be a huge improvement (or more just a lateral movement), you get a good winger in return. So your team is in a better position overall."
Habs,3a391h,sex_panther_by_odeon,-4,Wed Jun 17 12:42:29 2015 UTC,Eller hasn't proven anything offensively. He really needs to put it in a new gear to show he is worth his contract.
Habs,3a391h,sex_panther_by_odeon,14,Wed Jun 17 00:46:56 2015 UTC,"Because he is used in a defensive oriented role. Give me some centers who start just as much or more in the defensive zone, who score more than Eller, with zero PP time, and have a rotating cast of grinders on the wing. Hint: There aren't many.  Anyway my point was that Eller is better than Vermette. Like I said, he scored more at ES (I think) than Vermette despite a rotating cast of grinders and heavy defensive deployment.   EDIT: Just checked and Vermette had 21 ES points. He got primarily offensive deployment and decent line mates. he played all 82 games. Eller had 20 ES points. Eller was absolutely buried in the Dzone. He played with grinders. He missed five games due to injury. Seems to me it's quite clear who the better player is."
Habs,3a391h,Muter91,9,Wed Jun 17 00:55:07 2015 UTC,"Thank you, I'm surprised people expect so much out of Eller despite his role, deployment and bad linemates"
Habs,3a391h,Powdreams,0,Wed Jun 17 03:53:26 2015 UTC,I love how once again the double standard comes out. When eller fails to put up 30 points its oh he has bad linemates and his deployment is so defensive he doesnt get the chances other like dd gets. Never his fault. Yet emelin under the exact same circumstances gets ripped apart.
Habs,3a391h,bsaures,4,Wed Jun 17 04:28:37 2015 UTC,"Well I'd like to compare Lars Eller with other league 3rd line centers.  He gets 3rd line minutes, roughly 30-40 percent O-zone deployment and no PP time.  He has similar if not more points to other league 3rd line centers (see Jarnkrok, Stoll, Sutter).  Frankly, I'd be stunned if he put up 30 points as its pretty rare for players like Eller in a clearly defined 3rd line center role with almost no PP time to put up that many points.  Sutter had 33 with modest PP time and better line mates.  Emelin just doesnt fit in the top 4 anymore (Subban, Markov, Beau, and Petry).  He's a fine 3rd pairing d-man but paying 4 million for a 3rd pairing d man (with a NTC) is absurd.  I'd prefer to roll with Pateryn, Tinordi or Gilbert on the third pairing.  They are all cheaper options and Pateryn + Tinordi need the development."
Habs,3a391h,Powdreams,1 point,Wed Jun 17 04:44:25 2015 UTC,His deployment is pretty typical of a 3rd line centre. He was 96th among centres for esp this year which is very underwhelming. If as many people assert that he is a 2nd line centre he should have no problem even putting up average 3rd line points in that role but he didnt.  There is zero evidence that  supports the  fact that bealieu  is in the top 4 next year. He had barely better possession numbers than emelin in the regular season despite having one of the most sheltered  roles among regular dmen. In the playoffs when games matter more emelin had slightly  better possession  numbers despite getting absolutely  burried in dzone start % of 39.62 while bealieu  had a insanely sheltered 64.1 %. Bergevin has stated numerous times he values players who perform in the playoffs (the only reason eller is still on the team) and last playoffs proved there is still a huge gap between emelin and bealieu. People were saying how well bealieu played in the playoffs but in reality saying he was subpar is being nice.
Habs,3a391h,bsaures,1 point,Wed Jun 17 13:01:59 2015 UTC,"I've never asserted that he is a 2nd line center. Maybe he has the potential but we'll never know as Therrien rarely puts him in a position to succeed offensively.  I'd be quite happy to keep Eller as 3c for years to come.  Eller is still on the team because no one else is ready to take up his buried deployment and sub par linemates.  Comparing him to every other in the league is absurd. Would it be fair to compare eller to lehtara or kesler? No, it wouldn't. Better comparisons would be Rackell or Lowry. If you compare Eller to other centers who get way more favorable deployment,  way better linemates by a country mile and more pp time,  he's obviously going to look sub par.   Emelin is tricky as he does make glaring mistakes to the eye. I'd be happy if he could win back a top 4 position. Part of me thinks that he would be much better if he learned more English. I can only imagine how hard it is to communicate with him as his d partner."
Habs,3a391h,Powdreams,1 point,Wed Jun 17 15:39:22 2015 UTC,"Rackell is  a 4th  liner last year and it was lowry's first season thats hardly a fair comparison. As far as third liners in his same role he is average theres no way around it.  As far as emelin goes how can he win back a spot he never lost. I must have missed the memo where bealieu  replaced him in the top four because his icetime, point production, usuage, salary, clearly indicate that he hasnt lost his spot."
Habs,3a391h,bsaures,1 point,Wed Jun 17 16:40:14 2015 UTC,"There is zero evidence that supports the fact that bealieu is in the top 4 next year. He had barely better possession numbers than emelin in the regular season despite having one of the most sheltered roles among regular dmen   When you adjust for zone starts, typically done by eliminating the first 10 seconds after a face off, Beaulieu is still a far better player than Emelin. In fact, even if you consider all the points that Emelin himself had a hand in, we would still be better off with Beaulieu on the ice.  QoC is a bit of a tricky thing to measure and there's some debate around how useful it is and what it means, but in general Emelin faced slightly better competition. They had similar quality team mates.  You are making a bigger deal out of the deployment differences than they deserve. Indeed, if you want to go look at the dCorsi number (a measure of performance as compared to expected performance that controls for QoT, QoC, and zone starts) for both those players, you'll find that Emelin underperforms, Beaulieu more or less breaks even, and Eller significantly over performs.  When people say things like, ""stats can be used to mislead,"" it is what you are and have been doing that they are referring to.  Edit:  Corsi For  Corsi Against  To read the Charts:   The black bar indicates the expectation for the player The colored bars indicate how the player actually performed In Corsi For, if the player’s bar is above the black bar, the player exceeded expectations In Corsi Against, if the player’s bar is below the black bar, the player exceeded expectations.   Site.  As you can see, and as numerous different people have pointed out, Emelin has a problem, his inability to get the puck out of our zone. Whenever he's on the ice, he tanks the offense. Significantly too, if you take the time to go look at the actual breakdowns of how we do when he's on the ice.  Don't take my, or this site's word for it, go look at Emelin's on ice stats yourself and report back with what you see. The only instance where it looks like he might be ok, and just ok, is his G/60 when he's on ice. And goals are the least reliable of stats. As soon as you start looking at high danger chances, shots, Fenwick, Corsi, a very clear pattern emerges. And that pattern doesn't change when you adjust for zone starts, or competition or team mates.   The only thing that might indicate we're better off with Emelin as a fourth than Beaulieu is his play against stronger teams, because Beaulieu did not have a great playoffs and it's not impossible that that's some sort of indication there's more here to see. But, as time goes by, whatever slim difference that makes will disappear as Beaulieu learns his role because, everything else held constant, it is harder to find decent offensive players than it is decent defensive players."

Habs,3a391h,Muter91,2,Thu Jun 18 19:20:33 2015 UTC,If Emelin got 30 points I'd be over the moon.
Habs,3a391h,slayeryouth,2,Wed Jun 17 04:58:53 2015 UTC,"Well, to be fair, Eller's linemates and D-zone starts were his burden, whereas Emelin's poor possession was Gilbert's burden. As the article stated Gilbert played very well with Brian Campbell in St. Louis, then had a crappy year with Emelin. So it's not a double standard. Eller's play is being negatively affected by his line mates, and Emelin's play is negatively affecting his line mates."
Habs,3a391h,HammerOfTheSlobs,1 point,Wed Jun 17 13:37:11 2015 UTC,Anyone who has been into analytics  readings the last 5 years knows that brian campbell is one of the best dmen at over inflating his partners possession stats. Campell in florida (not stl) basically drafged gilberts corpse to solid possession  stats .  If emelin was dragging gilbert down why did he also have better possession numbers than gilbert despite also playing a signifigantly harder role in the playoffs ? Gilbert had a 57.14% oz start versus emelins 39.62% with emelin having a significantly harder qoc. The reality is that in florida he was carried by campbell(as he has done with numerous dman) then when asked to pull his weight in a 2nd pairing role he flopped and had to take a sheltered 3rd pairing role
Habs,3a391h,bsaures,2,Wed Jun 17 13:58:13 2015 UTC,"Emelin doesn't need anyone to drag him down, he does it to himself. Gilbert and Emelin were each others most frequent D partner. Both of them played better together than they did apart.  Blaming Emelin's problems on Gilbert is simply incorrect."
Habs,3a391h,Fenrir,2,Thu Jun 18 00:24:28 2015 UTC,Yet emelin under the exact same circumstances gets ripped apart.   If this were true you wouldn't have had to resort to that dishonest analysis to defend him.  The difference between Elller and Emelin is that Eller provides value when you consider the his deployment. Emelin underperforms considering his deployment.
Habs,3a391h,Fenrir,4,Thu Jun 18 00:09:46 2015 UTC,Really hope for the day MT finally gets his head out of his ass and realize Eller can be a 2nd liner.

I would like to see DD cycled out of the lineup and Pleks-Eler-DLR-Mitchell down the middle for a fair chunk of the year. Not because I don't think DD has a role to play, but because I am in the camp that believes Eller could be an offensive asset if he is put in a position to play 2nd-line PP minutes on a line with wingers like Gally and Chucky. Plus DLR could develop as a 3rd line defensive centre. I get the sense that MT hates risk and loves the safe play though, so I don't see this happening."

He can only produce while getting a huge offensive zone start push and prime PP time. He will be looking for a huge contract to close out his career. Offer sheet a good young winger or package a trade for one but there is absolutely no need to throw money at Vermette. I think you need to look at the big picture here.
Habs,3a391h,Muter91,4,Wed Jun 17 14:15:35 2015 UTC,"He got 15 goals aging with 4th liners... That's ONE less tha DD getting playtime with Gallagher and Pacioretty and offensive zone starts. If Eller plays in the top 6, he's a 20 goal scorer."

Habs,39z10t,slayeryouth,8,Mon Jun 15 23:19:15 2015 UTC,He's already a top 6 forward and just turned 21. So he's already above average and climbing.

Habs,39z10t,hkycoach,1 point,Tue Jun 16 02:12:48 2015 UTC,"Has the cap been officially announced yet or are we still just working with projections?  Because if that's the case I'd assume that Bergevin wants to wait untill he knows exactly how much money he's working with when negotiating with such a key player.  It's probably fair to say that he takes cap management seriously, so I would imagine that he wants to make sure he's not writing any checks he can't cash.  Now if Chucky isn't signed by August, then I'll start to worry."
Habs,39z10t,sex_panther_by_odeon,1 point,Tue Jun 16 03:28:47 2015 UTC,It took all summer for Eller. There's really no need to worry.
Habs,39z10t,hkycoach,1 point,Tue Jun 16 12:15:12 2015 UTC,"Flynn is an RFA so he will likely cost nothing, maybe even a 2-way deal and he could play in St Johns"
Habs,39z10t,sex_panther_by_odeon,2,Tue Jun 16 23:22:56 2015 UTC,"I think it's a decent contract.    We're still very tight on cap space, with Chucky still to sign.    Flynn's qualifying offer is in the range of 750k, so I could see them front him that, even if it's just to trade him quickly.  Which leaves us ~1.75m+ to sign Chucky.  The 'Plus' being whatever the cap raise is (rumored to be 71-73m).    Even if Chucky signs a low-ball bridge contract, we're in cap trouble going into next year without some moves.  MB has said he likes his defensive group, but whenever he says he's comfortable with something he surprises us.  So I'm hoping he has something up his sleeve to keep the team going in the right direction."
Habs,39z10t,HammerOfTheSlobs,3,Tue Jun 16 00:14:06 2015 UTC,"We actually have 5 mill. (I hope anyways, damn NHL Numbers)"
Habs,39z10t,sex_panther_by_odeon,2,Tue Jun 16 01:10:52 2015 UTC,"Generalfanager has us at 2.5m  Edit: yea, it looks like NHL Numbers is based on the $71m number for next year."
Habs,39z10t,SiegeWar,2,Tue Jun 16 01:41:30 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure we had about 6.5 after Beaulieu so with this we still have somewhere in the region of 5
Habs,39z10t,Baratatat,5,Tue Jun 16 01:22:58 2015 UTC,We'll have $5m assuming the $71m cap space going into next year.
Habs,39z10t,fromage1,2,Tue Jun 16 01:44:27 2015 UTC,And Chucky will get a contract very similar to Yakopov if he signs for 2 years.
Habs,39z10t,i_love_bubble_butts,1 point,Tue Jun 16 02:14:36 2015 UTC,"Yes, but if he gets the same as Yak, that' 2.5m AAV.  Which leaves us just $2.5m in cap space (admittedly on the low end of the current estimates for the cap raise).  I'm just saying that is not a lot of wiggle room for us to make off-season moves."
Habs,39z10t,tamzarien,1 point,Tue Jun 16 02:37:49 2015 UTC,"There is nothing to in the off season that is very interesting except maybe vermette instead of one of our centers. If we move, it is via trade."
Habs,39z10t,slayeryouth,-2,Tue Jun 16 02:42:32 2015 UTC,Emelin in a deal for Vermette? What is Vermette's contract status? Hawks could use Emelin...
Habs,39z10t,Muter91,3,Tue Jun 16 05:12:47 2015 UTC,Vermette is a UFA so I would trade one of the centers for a prospect or package them with Emelin and our draft picks/prospect for a good winger.

Habs,39z10t,Fabien_Lamour,0,Tue Jun 16 02:00:22 2015 UTC,"Yes let's sign all the fourth liners to three year contracts. Kind of makes it hard for the young guys to find a place on the roster in these ""transition"" years if the spots are constantly filled by vets."
Habs,39z10t,Muter91,2,Tue Jun 16 01:04:24 2015 UTC,Those things aren't mutually exclusive buddy. Mitchell is still moveable if space is needed. You can dig him in the AHL or trade him.
Habs,39z10t,habuheard,-1,Tue Jun 16 12:21:08 2015 UTC,"They kind of are...? If a spot is filled by a grinding veteran, how does a young skill player win a spot? Therrien will go with the grinder almost every time."
Habs,39z10t,Fabien_Lamour,2,Tue Jun 16 16:20:48 2015 UTC,By playing better than the veteran.   Look what happened with Malhotra or Gonchar just a few months ago. Didn't play much in the second half while younger guys got their chances. De La Rose and Patetyn played in the playoffs while these two veterans were scratched.  But hey let's just whine about Therrien. That's easier and doesn't require any thinking.  You also seem to forget the habs have only 11 forwards signed right now. 12 with Galchenyuk. You still need one or two forwards to complete the roster to 23 players. Mitchell could very well start the season as an healthy scratch.
Habs,39z10t,BinaryChode,-1,Tue Jun 16 16:34:50 2015 UTC,"DLR is a grinder. Rookie, but he is a grinder.   I didn't forget anything? 11 forwards? More like 22 including rookies. You're being rather condescending there without doing your research. They could easily fill those third and fourth line roles with young players on ELC's which would be cheaper and have more upside. That would allow MB to have more money to pay someone to score goals. You know, something the team actually needs.   Mitchell could very well start the season as an healthy scratch.   And if Mitchell sits in the pressbox to start this coming season, that's 1.2M wasted. For three years."
Habs,39z10t,HammerOfTheSlobs,5,Tue Jun 16 16:54:55 2015 UTC,"DLR is a grinder. Rookie, but he is a grinder.    And? Okay he's a grinder... That doesn't change anything, it's a younger player tossing an older one aside. Just like you want.   11 forwards? More like 22 including rookies.   Only 11 of those ended the year in the NHL. Why inlcude AHLers? In the end you only need 14 forwards in the NHL.   And if Mitchell sits in the pressbox to start this coming season, that's 1.2M wasted. For three years.    He'll be on fourth line rotation or replace injuries just like many other guy in his situation all around the league. If younger guys can do better than him on the fourth line, good, but he's a really nice insurance you can move around easily. He's perfect for the role. The Rangers have Moore, Glass and Sheppard. The Blackhawks have Kruger, Desjardins and fucking Carcillo. Ducks have Jackman and Thomson. Surely these teams are doing something wrong with all these vets on their fourth lines!  You know nothing about the business of hockey."
Habs,39z10t,Muter91,-1,Tue Jun 16 17:59:34 2015 UTC,"You're hilarious.    Only 11 of those ended the year in the NHL. Why inlcude AHLers? In the end you only need 14 forwards in the NHL.   This proves it. You think our prospect pool sucks so much that not ONE player will graduate from the AHL? Lol. Have a good day.    The Blackhawks have Kruger, Desjardins and fucking Carcillo. Ducks have Jackman and Thomson. Surely these teams are doing something wrong with all these vets on their fourth lines!   Kruger is 24. But totally a grizzled vet eh? Hahaha.

Habs,39z10t,paul_33,12,Mon Jun 15 23:07:49 2015 UTC,Mitchell is better than that and can produce really well for a 4th liner
Habs,39z10t,BinaryChode,5,Mon Jun 15 23:08:57 2015 UTC,"I just like his speed and forechecking, he's like a hyena in their. Even if he doesn't produce a lot of points, as long as he's playing that way and winning faceoffs, he's gunna do alright."
Habs,39z10t,BinaryChode,3,Mon Jun 15 23:51:28 2015 UTC,Gonna grind us to wins
Habs,39z10t,Hoarse-horse,14,Tue Jun 16 01:21:54 2015 UTC,"Right-handed C, faceoff/defensive specialist.   Habs have 0 right-handed centers who can take defensive zone faceoffs... until DLR and/or McCarron become full-time NHL C's and good on faceoffs.  Any R-H C who can have a good faceoffs win % and be OK in the D zone is valuable in the NHL.   Not defending the move, just explaining the context."
Habs,39z10t,Sharks9,15,Mon Jun 15 23:14:55 2015 UTC,"Yup basically a Malhotra that can rake 15 to 20 points a season instead of 4.  And a local boy, which does not hurt."
Habs,39z10t,Hoarse-horse,5,Mon Jun 15 23:31:01 2015 UTC,Only time will tell but from what I saw from Mitchell I believe he'll be much more affective then Moen.
Habs,39z10t,Sharks9,1 point,Mon Jun 15 23:09:54 2015 UTC,"Agree, totally.  When 4rth liners with limited skills lose an edge, they sink fast. That happened to Moen. He was a decent pickup when he first arrived. In addition to grit, he was speedy and could score the odd goal. But his value depreciated pretty quickly when he lost a step.   I'd like our 4rth liners to be composed of guys who are capable of scoring ~ 10 goals a year. I don't see Mitchell possessing this skill."
Habs,39z10t,hkycoach,3,Mon Jun 15 23:22:19 2015 UTC,"Mitchell did score 10 goals in a single season with the sharks.  In the playoffs this year he had 5 points in 12 games, very solid production for a 4th liner.  Having 4th liners capable of scoring 10 goals would be great but I see Mitchell's game being more about adding depth to the lineup since he brings point production (I could see him scoring 10 goals in a good year), defense, face-offs and good skating."
Habs,39z10t,habsdane,-1,Tue Jun 16 00:27:20 2015 UTC,Hey look folks still downvoting people they disagree with.
Habs,39z10t,Hoarse-horse,0,Tue Jun 16 12:16:21 2015 UTC,agreed
Habs,39z10t,quadriplegic_cheetah,-7,Tue Jun 16 01:21:32 2015 UTC,WHY??????
Habs,39z10t,Batmarde,-9,Tue Jun 16 01:16:45 2015 UTC,I really don't understand MB's thinking some times. A lot of the good teams have the 4th line available to help bring along their prospects and get them used to the NHL. Not us. We plug it full of veteran fourth liners and leave our young guns to languish and not pushing their development.
Habs,39z10t,Muter91,13,Mon Jun 15 23:20:33 2015 UTC,Why on earth would you want our prospects playing on the 4th line? Fill it with defensively responsible veterans and put our young guns in the top-9.
Habs,39z10t,BinaryChode,-4,Mon Jun 15 23:34:42 2015 UTC,"Limited time on the ice, allows them to be high energy and get used to the NHL speed and gameplay. Occasional mix into other lines if needed. We basically have Prust, Mitchell and DLR on our 4th line. Would be nice to see our prospects get chances for those spots.  Editing this last part in: I don't understand where everyone seems to think our AHLers get to play and develop on this team. They are not getting room on our 1st or 2nd lines, our 3rd line is supposedly a shutdown line and we aren't going to be sticking defensively liable young prospects on that so that leaves the 4th line, which we are plugging full of older veterans."
Habs,39z10t,LegendaryWolfee,4,Tue Jun 16 00:22:17 2015 UTC,DLR is a prospect...
Habs,39z10t,Powdreams,-2,Tue Jun 16 00:32:19 2015 UTC,In name...  He's earned a spot on the roster...
Habs,39z3ap,hotcoolbb,4,Mon Jun 15 23:21:21 2015 UTC,"I don't understand why people are upset with this. We are very short on right handed centres, and Mitchell is a great centre for the 4th line. at a 1.2M cap hit, it's chump change. MB still has several players to deal with  in terms of alleviating cap space, so I wouldn't be worried.  I was actually hoping that we would keep Mitchell, he really proved himself to me in the playoffs as a great energy player."
Habs,39z3ap,JMPesce,3,Tue Jun 16 12:17:05 2015 UTC,"Yep, at $1.2M we can bury him in the AHL and in year 2 & 3 of his contract the cap hit would only be $175K. But he'd likely be picked up off of waivers anyway. Basically no risk here.  Also worth noting that Mitchell was making $1.9M last year. Great signing by MB I say."
Habs,39z3ap,webu,4,Tue Jun 16 17:51:45 2015 UTC,I think what people are also forgetting is that montreal was by far the  healthiest team last year. We only had 88 games lost last year the next lowest was 126. Those injuries  are when young ahl players get their chance. Last 6ear was a perfect example: pap and eller gets hurt and dlr gets his shot along with a couple others. Emelin on the back end and bealieu gets some mins and pateryn gets a shot.  The chances of going that healthy next year are slim so having quality depth players is crucial.
Habs,39z3ap,bsaures,2,Tue Jun 16 15:11:20 2015 UTC,Good signing.  fair for both sides.
Habs,39z3ap,thejokersrs,0,Tue Jun 16 14:33:27 2015 UTC,Does this leave cap space for Sidney Crosby maybe?
Habs,39z3ap,Mcl94,5,Wed Jun 17 01:29:24 2015 UTC,"You realise the team has to get to 23 players no matter what right? 1.2M is pretty standard for a veyeran fourth liner around the league. If it's not Mitchell it'll be someone else.   If you don't understand the business, don't comment."
Habs,39z3ap,Fabien_Lamour,-17,Mon Jun 15 23:55:34 2015 UTC,why? You don't need to lock 4th liners up to 3 year deals. Who does that? Oh right he's from Montreal

Habs,39z3ap,BinaryChode,1 point,Tue Jun 16 19:41:31 2015 UTC,Prust was signed to a 4-year deal and is a fourth liner. Problems with that?
Habs,39z3ap,lehabs,4,Tue Jun 16 20:01:37 2015 UTC,"To be fair, Prust was a decent 3rd line option when he was signed.  Actually he proved this year he can still that."
Habs,39z3ap,zebra_heaDD,0,Tue Jun 16 20:16:21 2015 UTC,"Prust was mainly a 4th liner though. He can do more and did, sure, and you could say Tory Mitchell was one of our biggest point getters in the playoffs, because he was, but he is a 4th liner. That is like saying Weise is not a 4th liner. He can, and did do more, even did well on the first line, but he is not a first liner, he is a fourth liner."
Habs,39z3ap,lehabs,1 point,Tue Jun 16 20:49:51 2015 UTC,Several 4th line players get more than 1 year deals if they are good at what they do. Mitchell has proven he can generate points when given very limited toi and opportunities something we need out of our 4th line. He can bea regular pker and is great in the dot. All that adds up to his contract easily plenty have gotten more for providing  less.  Also you are a complete and utter moron if you think they are going to  waste dlr's development  putting him on the 4th line. If he cant crack the top 9 he will be going back to the ahl as he should to get more icetime. The kid just turned 20 there is no benefit of  him being a 4th liner to his development
Habs,39z3ap,bsaures,1 point,Tue Jun 16 20:52:53 2015 UTC,He's not French or francophone dumbass. Being from Montreal does not make you either.

Habs,39ydid,clancy6969,30,Mon Jun 15 20:15:04 2015 UTC,"FORWARDS:  Max Pacioretty - The Wolverine. 1LW A scoring machine, with healing powers beyond anything human. Fast, strong, lightning wrist shot. Scores shorties. Came back from a broken neck, punctured lungs, actual incineration. Terrifyingly under-rated goalscorer. Top 5 LW in the league.    Tomas Plekanec - Pleckasex. 1C. Captain Turtleneck. Suave, unflappable 2-way centre. Defensively responsible, nifty passer. Wears nice sweaters. Good dude.    Brendan Gallagher - Gally. 1RW. An irrepressible 5'9"" wrecking ball. Constantly fouled, the evil grin never leaves his face as he charges into the crease and scores dirty, nasty goals. Scores from his knees behind the net with a stick in his temple. A nightmare to play against. Girls say he's handsome.   Alex Galchenyuk - Chucky. 1LW/2C (?) Uber-talented, stick-handling, jinking wizard. Is he a winger or a centre? Controversy. (No, he's a centre) Developing fast. Gonna be a superstar. He and Gally bicker like schoolgirls, trash-talk each other, it's hilarious.   David Desharnais - DD. 1/2C, kinda W. Tiny, tricky, quick hands, fights huge guys for the puck in the corners, gets it sometimes. Gets a bad rap, plays no D. Makes fans crazy sometimes. Gets soft minutes, doesn't convert enough.    P.A. Parenteau - PAP. 2RW. Silky smooth, local boy, loves the club, had a terrible year. Does he stay? Can he get his game back? May be on the block.   Brandon Prust - Prusty. 3LW. Heart-and-soul guy. Fist-swinging, bleed-for-the-flag winger. His team-mates love him, Goons fear his Punching of Justice. Not a big scorer, but it's nice when it happens.   Lars Eller - Larry or Clutch. 3C (maybe 1C). Divides opinion. Some say he's a shifty European with no passion for the game, best used as a grinding 3C. People who are correct say he's a puck-moving beast, and a natural offensive talent who suffers from not getting along with the coach. Quality Centre, good skater, great passer.   Dale Weise - Dutch Gretzky. 3RW sigh He's a puzzle. He plays an unusual role, where he's not good enough to be a legit top-6 guy most of the time, but he's much more skilful than a bottom-6 guy. So he's a grinding skill winger. Forechecks like a motherfucker. Goes on crazy hot streaks. Loves the team.   Jacob De La Rose - DLR. 4LW. Prospect. Bangs and crashes. Coach likes him as a d-line banger, but he's going to be a danger on the top-6 some time. Really good young player. Hits. Oh, the hits...   Torrey Mitchell - no known alias. 4C. Your classic checking C. Good on the 4th line, hit a nice run of form in the playoffs. May be 'Clutch.'   Devante Smith-Pelly - DSP. 4RW. A human cannonball, who half the fans hate because we traded a skilful Czech prospect (Jiri Sekac, ANA, barely saw the playoffs) for him. Coach likes grinders, so hated Sekac, loves DSP. Had some fitness/fatness trouble, got over it. Scores dirty, hits like a bus. Was a Habs fan as a kid.   DEFENCEMEN:  P.K. Subban - The Subbanator. 1D. Sexy motherfucker. Smooth skating, rocket firing, butt-checking monster. The coolest. Dekes like Datsyuk, shoots like Weber, hits like Kronwall.  Andrei Markov - The General. 1D. Silent. Stoic. Russian. The boys make fun of him, cause he's very serious. Adorable when excited, which is never.  Jeff Petry - No known alias. 2D for now. Stole him from Edmonton, loves the team, quality Dman. Skates, passes, big contract, huge pickup for the Habs. Solid guy.  Alexei Emelin - Boom. 2D for now. Controversial. Physical Dman, positioning and passing are a bit weak. Shy guy, little awkward. Hits like a goddamn train, but gets caught out of position. Analytically minded fans don't like him, old-school guys talk about grit and sandpaper and such.  Tom Gilbert - No known alias. 3D. Shifty D-man. Reasonably talented, not super charismatic. Might be getting dumped for a prospect.  Greg Pateryn - Almost certainly Patty or Patter. 3D. Upcoming physical guy. Hits, blocks, first pass is okay. Still apt to panic a little, could be solid in the future.  Jarred Tinordi - Tinner. 4th D. Monstrous kid from Maryland. 6'6"" 220lbs, 20 years old. Eats bear hearts raw, sucks the marrow from lion femurs. Big. Fucking. Kid. Might be in the team full time this year, depending on trades.  EDIT- Nathan Bealieau- The Bulldog. 2/3 LD. Smooth, speedy skating defenceman. Top prospect, good run this year. Not big but plays tough, has a dirty right cross. Likely heir to the top line post-Markov. Will play next year, but how much?  GOALIE:  Carey Price - Jesus, Pricer, Jesus Price. The greatest goaltender in history. Cowboy Moses, here to lead the faithful to the promised land, then rope some steers. Lives to hunt and stop pucks, and there ain't no hunting in Montreal. The best. Quiet guy, total sweetheart, from Anahim Lake BC. Active in charity work. If you meet him, it is appropriate to bow, though kneeling is acceptable. A golden god.      STAFF:  Marc Bergevin - MB/Bergy. GM. Smart, savvy, cool guy. Makes good trades, widely held up as a guy who knows what's up. Picked up grinders at the deadline when the fans wanted goals. Good GM, some iffy calls when he started out.  Michel Therrien - Too stupid and dumb to get a nickname. Plays stupid dumb grinding hockey. Can't evaluate talent. Can't deploy talent. Can't organize his lines. Can't shrink the bench. Will waste Carey Prices golden years, at which point I will finally stab that voodoo doll I've been building. Alternatively, a babcock-esque defensively savvy coach, who likes low-risk plays. Either way, his players believe in him, so we're stuck with his stupid tactics. He's a divisive figure."
Habs,39ydid,Funkenbrain,3,Mon Jun 15 22:29:28 2015 UTC,Forwards  Ah mhm seems pretty non-biased and realistic so far  Defence  Yep I agree  Management  Damn some seriously aggressive opinions. MT really isn't that bad lol. Especially when you look at the offense he's working with. IMO he's been a good coach.
Habs,39ydid,quadriplegic_cheetah,4,Tue Jun 16 01:38:14 2015 UTC,"Like I said, divisive. :P I think his style's too conservative, and a bad fit for this line-up. His conception of the team is inaccurate, pointing the boys in the wrong direction, and this grinding stuff along the walls throttles the teams ability to generate quality scoring chances. Worst of all, he's poor at adjusting on the fly.   At the same time, I understand why people think he's good. They see a positional game, looking for the opponents mistakes, slowing the game down. He could, I accept, win the Cup this way, but I don't think he maximises our chances."
Habs,39ydid,Funkenbrain,3,Tue Jun 16 04:41:36 2015 UTC,"Completely agree with this analysis. I've always thought of him as ""not the best but not the worst"".   My only real problem with him is he doesn't let his highly skilled creative players do their thing, most notably Subban and Galchenyuk. He keeps his gifted players on an unnecessarily short-leash, but for whatever reason gives yards to some less than deserving member.   In the end, the only thing I want to happen this summer (more than picking up another offensively skilled forward) is for Therrien to take a second look at the way our Offense plays."

Habs,39ydid,Funkenbrain,1 point,Tue Jun 16 14:23:31 2015 UTC,"I know this response has been beaten like a dead horse but we win. This is a guy who has been coaching/ in the game of hockey for 20+ years..... He knows way way way way more about the sport than we could even fathom. With the roster we have (a weak offense) he has done a great job at getting us wins. I think out weak offense will change(it could next year) but with the forward core we ice, getting shots is not our strength, however it was in the playoffs.... As long as guys like Galchenyuk and Gallagher keep it going/ getting better this team can definitely win a cup"
Habs,39ydid,quadriplegic_cheetah,2,Tue Jun 16 06:35:12 2015 UTC,"Yup, that's the perfect recap of the pro-Therrien argument. I don't buy that argument from experience though, just because you've been doing something for 20 years doesn't mean you understand it, or are good at it. Milbury and Cherry have decades of experience, doesn't mean you should choose them over Jon Cooper. See also Brian Burke and Randy Carlisle. Decades of experience does not equal competence.  Bylsma had less experience when he took over the Penguins from Therrien, and yet his team suddenly jumped in terms of possession statistics, and then won the Cup the same year.   Getting shots isn't really the point, if anything, over-emphasizing 'get the puck on net' is part of the problem. Controlling the puck well enough to generate quality scoring chances is the point, and the core of this Habs team is good enough to play that way."
Habs,39ydid,Funkenbrain,1 point,Tue Jun 16 14:22:22 2015 UTC,"Bylsma used Therriens system to a tee. Like the players said it was literally the exact same thing. And that's not even an argument, because Therrien got his team to game 6 of the cup final. So saying he was a bad coach is the se as saying Cooper is a bad coach. One bounce this was or that way and Therrien has a cup. And I'm sorry but people like Cherry, Burke and Carlyle are very competent people. Cherry had odd opinions, but he was a good coach. Even Carlyle who is considered a bad coach had much more knowledge about the game than you could ever have. Multimillion dollar sports franchises don't just pick idiots up off the street to hire as a coach, they take people who have been in the job/sport for years and are capable and competent human beings. And that's what Therrien is. Is he the best coach in the NHL? Hell no, but he's most definitely an NHL quality coach."
Habs,39ydid,quadriplegic_cheetah,2,Tue Jun 16 15:12:20 2015 UTC,"And as soon as he left Pittsburgh's numbers improved, they started scoring more, and dominating scoring events. In the time he was there, Pittsburgh had the puck less and less, then things rebounded, consistently, once he was gone.   Teams have won the Cup playing Therrien's way, but they were all big thumping trap teams. There were plenty of competent people in baseball, some of them with decades of experience and Championship pennants, who completely failed to deal with revolutionary changes in how the game is understood. Cherry, Carlyle, Milbury and Therrien understood THEIR hockey, but I do not believe they understand what the game is now.    My fear is that every year the boys will make the playoffs and be exhausted and banged up once they get there, and continue to under-perform against teams that work the puck more effectively than we do. We have a fast skilful team, but Therrien has us playing heavy grinding hockey. Why? Because that's what he knows how to do."
Habs,39ydid,Funkenbrain,0,Tue Jun 16 17:37:08 2015 UTC,"Pittsburghs numbers barely went up. Even Pittsburgh admits to this. All Bylsma did was give them a swift kick in the ass. Therrien got to the fucking finals, Bylsma got to the finals with a hungrier team."
Habs,39ydid,quadriplegic_cheetah,2,Tue Jun 16 17:45:27 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry but that's blatantly false. The Pens were tenth in the East, five point out of the playoffs race (59 points in 56 games, behind Carolina's 59 in 55, and Buffalo's 64 in 56) when Therrien got canned. They finished the season fourth in the East, with 99 points, because they went on a 40 points in 26 games run with Bylsma.   If going from 1.05 points per game to 1.54 points per game is barely up, then I don't know what to tell you. Not to mention that the Pens were standing at a -7 goal differential when Therrien was fired, while they ended the season with +25 under Bylsma."
Habs,39ydid,Fan_of_Misanthropy,0,Thu Jun 18 19:02:18 2015 UTC,This isn't new information to me. Therrien already brought that team to the cup final. The team was playing like shif the next year. The players even said it themselves. Therrien being fired was really just the management saying get your shit together. And that's what happened. It was really just a swift kick in the ass.
Habs,39ydid,quadriplegic_cheetah,1 point,Fri Jun 19 00:14:39 2015 UTC,"Be that as it may, Therrien's system does not emphasize retaining the puck, preferring dump-ins round the board. The team struggles to make east-west passes in the neutral zone, which lead to more and better chances than dump-ins do. That's a tactical choice which I don't think suits us.  Not to mention, it doesn't even translate to better D, we give up a boatload of shots and struggle to clear the zone, let alone exit with possession. We kill ourselves trying to stay safe and give up the puck over and over, it's so frustrating to watch."
Habs,39ydid,Funkenbrain,0,Tue Jun 16 19:31:30 2015 UTC,"Alright than maybe you should start coaching the team. I'm sure you can do a better job right?  I'm well aware of our shot attempts issues. I've said many times he is not a top coach, but with a good roster we can win a cup with him. There are A LOT of shitty coaches out there who have won cups. And we had a 55 CF% percentage in the playoffs. He's not an idiot."

Habs,39xtlf,jo_maka,2,Mon Jun 15 23:44:21 2015 UTC,The rebuild started after 2012. It's still in process.
Habs,39xtlf,Muter91,0,Tue Jun 16 01:21:18 2015 UTC,"We were never in a rebuild. We had a core of Patches, Subban, Pleks, and Price. We still have the exact same core and have added a couple of pieces. We had a good team in 11-12, just insanely unlucky and lots of injuries to key guys."
Habs,39xtlf,jo_maka,3,Tue Jun 16 01:40:31 2015 UTC,"Rebuild doesn't mean blow up. Prior to 2012 we'd always try to patch holes to wheez in the playoffs. Since then we're actually locking some key points while bringing more and more of our prospects in the fold. Gauthier kickstarted it by sending away Cammy, AK who were our main attack for draft picks and depth. PK was a rookie in 2011, Patch was too, Price was still scary. Don't let the names fool you. They were not the people we counted on before 2012.   Call it a retool if you find the word rebuild dirty. But there was a shift in the makeup. And we're still in the tail end of that process. We're not a big move away from being a contender. Not yet."
Habs,39xtlf,Muter91,0,Tue Jun 16 01:50:20 2015 UTC,"PK wasn't a rookie in 2011-2012. He was one of the best defense men in the league. Patch wasn't a rookie in 2011-2012. He was one of the best left wingers in the NHL, and one year removed from a horrific injury. Cammy got traded for speaking his mind. AK lacked commitment and his play suffered because of it. Price had an off year and got injured.  Call it what you want but it certainly wasn't a rebuild. If it was a rebuild we would have tanked in 12-13 and had a high draft pick in 13-14 because MB would have traded assets for high picks. That wasn't the case. At all."

Habs,39zh2e,GibierJaune,1 point,Tue Jun 16 02:01:26 2015 UTC,"Oh I dunno, I think a couple of periods of hockey is more than enough to totally disregard 104 games worth of strong possession play.  The only sample size that matters is the one that I like."
Habs,39zh2e,slayeryouth,2,Tue Jun 16 02:26:52 2015 UTC,"Look man, you don't need to be so sarcastic to get your point across. And on the other side, can't we just admit that this strategy offers enough benefits to be used in the SCF?"
Habs,39zh2e,GibierJaune,2,Tue Jun 16 03:00:04 2015 UTC,"Look man, you don't need to be so sarcastic to get your point across.   Sure I don't need to be, but when OP's point is (ostensibly) since Chicago dumped the puck a few times in the SCF that it's obviously smart and effective hockey as a long term strategy, I see no reason why I shouldn't mock that when all the available evidence suggests otherwise.  Especially when it's a pretty transparent attempt to bait people.  Apologies if you thought it was directed at you though.   And on the other side, can't we just admit that this strategy offers enough benefits to be used in the SCF?   Every team employs dump and chase hockey sometimes when it's the appropriate play, and that's never been the point of contention.  But to suggest that since Chicago, the third best possession team over 106 games this season and one of the strongest possession teams for several season running, are finding success because they dumped the puck a few times in the SCF is a pretty flawed conclusion and a poor argument in it's favour (which again is ostensibly OP's point.)"
Habs,39zh2e,slayeryouth,3,Tue Jun 16 03:22:05 2015 UTC,"Not to mention that dump/chase can be used to put defensemen back on their heels when the opposing strategy is to clog the neutral zone. It's like running a screen in football when the opponents blitz. Dump and chase a few times and all of a suddne the D-men aren't so far up ice, which creates room to skate the puck in.  Using dump and chase as a staple is counterproductive, boring to watch and all-around bad hockey."

Habs,39zh2e,paul_33,0,Tue Jun 16 12:18:47 2015 UTC,"My understanding was that Cherry was showing how dump n chase could be an efficient possession strategy, maybe I'd have to rewatch though."

Habs,39zh2e,paul_33,5,Tue Jun 16 15:04:01 2015 UTC,You guys realise that every damn team dumps and chases right? Every team aims for controlled entries but sometimes the neutral zone transition gets countered and dumping becomes the best solution unless you really like turning the puck over to give quick rushes to your oppenent.
Habs,39zh2e,Fabien_Lamour,-1,Tue Jun 16 12:28:08 2015 UTC,"I hate to do this, but did you even #watchthegames?  Montreal didn't dump the puck as a last resort, and literally nobody would have a problem with that if it were the case.  But when your zone entry scheme on the powerplay- never mind it being their go-to entry at even strength- but on the powerplay off all things is to ring the puck around the boards from the blue line, well that's going to become a point of contention for some people."

Habs,39zh2e,slayeryouth,4,Tue Jun 16 18:54:00 2015 UTC,Well it's really only your voice against mine. I apparently didn't see the same thing as you... what I saw is a team that did both controlled entries and dumps depending on the situation. Just like any other team.  Maybe the habs didn't have the best transition game but when they had the opportunity of course they entered the zone in control.
Habs,39zh2e,Fabien_Lamour,2,Tue Jun 16 19:51:13 2015 UTC,"Dump and chase became a stronger strategy over the years due to the increasing speed of the game.   Possession is big yeah, but what does it matter if youre possessing 60% against a team that shuts down your entries?  If you dont adjust you dont win.    The habs dont have enough players that gain the zone with ease, we've all seen it.  Pacioretty gaisn the zone then misses the pass, it goes back.  Subban takes the puck (sometimes from his own teammates) then gains the zone and runs out of options.  Montreal's success this year came from two things  1. Dump and chase 2. Stretch passing.  Its no secret that the habs havent thought it has been their time yet, we are the only ones do that, so dont be surprised if you see their style elevate over the next two years, its been the plan guys, its been the plan."

Habs,39zh2e,slayeryouth,1 point,Tue Jun 16 20:50:00 2015 UTC,"KevinSquidFart never said anything about goals scored, shots for, scoring chances or suppressing the other team or really anything you mention. He/she simply said that the Habs' success came from dump and chase and stretch passing, which is pretty accurate. The Habs did have success. Were they successful at everything all the time? No, but they did have success and his/her comment was attributing that success to dump and chase and stretch passing. If you disagree that is cool, but why not address the comment at hand because yours simply brings up a straw man argument that deflects away from the comment."
Habs,39zh2e,lehabs,1 point,Tue Jun 16 19:57:12 2015 UTC,"If the Habs success came from dumping and stretch passes, then ostensibly those plays would result in maintaining possession of the puck, shots on net, scoring chances, and goals, all of which the Habs were abysmal at.  Conversely, success in that area would also result in denying the other team possession, suppressing shots and scoring chances and goals, with which the exception if goals the Habs were pretty terrible at suppressing.  So to say that their success came from a process that all the available evidence shows was either flawed or they weren't very good at executing is frankly absurd.  There is absolutely nothing fallacious about pointing out the processes lack of success when their argument is that said process was the source of their success.  To be honest, I'm not even sure on what planet examining the outcomes of a process that was specifically mentioned could be interpreted as a strawman argument."
Habs,39zh2e,slayeryouth,2,Tue Jun 16 20:33:56 2015 UTC,Quite frankly I think a good chunk of the Habs' success came from them falling behind and MT having to abandon defensive hockey for 20 or 30 minutes so they could come back.
Habs,39zh2e,HammerOfTheSlobs,1 point,Tue Jun 16 23:37:19 2015 UTC,"Hab's success should not be measured by any of those things, only on their record which was pretty amazing considering 1st in Atlantic, 2nd in East and made it to second round of playoffs. KevinSquidFart said    Montreal's success this year came from two things 1. Dump and chase 2. Stretch passing.   Success is not measured by the indicators but my wins and losses. You could have the best stats and indicators in the world, but not have a good record. There are teams that have better stats concerning   maintaining possession of the puck, shots on net, scoring chances, and goals   and    denying the other team possession, suppressing shots and scoring chances and goals   But that had less success than we need given that they placed lower than we did.   So to say that their success came from a process that all the available evidence shows was either flawed or they weren't very good at executing is frankly absurd.   I watched 79 out of 82 games this season. The evidence that matters is what happened on the ice, not what happens on an analytics spread sheet. This is not saying that teams should aim to replicate the Habs' analytics and possession stats etc or that the Habs cannot improve in this area. Of course teams shouldn't and the Habs can improve. But, this does not mean that the abs did not derive success from dump and chase and stretch passing, because if you go back and watch all of the games and see what actually happened on the ice, you will see that KevinSquidFart is right. It might not be pretty and might not line up with what advanced stats and analytics says, but that and watching what actually happens on the ice are two very different things and they do not always line up."
Habs,39zh2e,lehabs,0,Tue Jun 16 20:50:54 2015 UTC,"I watchted 82 regular season games, but that's really beside the point.  They explicitly said that dumping the puck and stretch passes were the source of their success, so I pointed out the failure rate of that process.  Then for whatever reason you came along claiming that that was somehow a strawman argument, and now you're saying that those numbers don't matter anyways, which while we're name dropping logical fallacies, is known as ""moving the goalposts."""
Habs,39zh2e,slayeryouth,1 point,Tue Jun 16 21:07:39 2015 UTC,"strawman argument simply means deflecting attention away from the point at hand to a different point.   No, that's not what a strawman argument is at all.  A strawman argument requires the manufacturing an of argument and attributing it to one's opponent.  From wikipedia: ""The so-called typical ""attacking a straw man"" argument creates the illusion of having completely refuted or defeated an opponent's proposition by covertly replacing it with a different proposition (i.e., ""stand up a straw man"") and then to refute or defeat that false argument (""knock down a straw man"") instead of the original proposition."" Given that I was responding directly to the assertion that the Habs success was based on dump and chase and stretch passes, I was neither deflecting attention towards a different point or setting up a strawman.  That's just how having a conversation works.  Now if I had replied by saying something like ""why do you think Price sucks so much?"" and then proceeded to argue against that, then we'd have a strawman argument.   By pointing out the failure rate of the dump and chase process on a general scale you did exactly that because you did not refer to the Hab's success   No, not really, considering that the original point was that the Habs success was based on dump and chase and stretch passes.  If they had said that they Habs used dump and chase and stretch passes and were also successful you'd have a point, but they didn't so you don't.  They explicitly said that the Habs success was on account of dump and chase and stretch passes which the available evidence doesn't support.   you spoke of the general success of the dump and chase model    Again, they explicitly said that their success was based on dump and chase and stretch passes, and again, the available evidence doesn't support this.     when the argument was about the success of the Habs and success is based wins vs losses.   That's fine if that's how you want to measure a teams overall success, but to apply wins and losses as a metric for guaging the success of any individual process a team uses is short sighted and flawed.  Case in point, nobody in their right mind would say that the Habs had a successful powerplay, and yet they were still successful.  Weird eh?   The Habs were a successful team this year. In addition, the argument was that success was gained from the dump and chase AND from the stretch pass.   Yes I know this, which I why I responded specifically to that argument.   But again, you decided to argue about global patterns of dump and chase's success with regard to specific variables or stats    No I didn't.  I responded by pointing out that specifically the Habs patterns of success with dump and chase with respect to specific variables and stats that are useful in measuring the success of plays such as dump and chase or stretch passes. I guess you could argue that I did tangentially, but I'm not sure how you would contextualize any team's stats without a basis for comparison, but it also seems like you have trouble properly contextualizing things so I can understand why you'd find it to be of limited value.   and not to the overall success of the Habs.   That's because the argument was never ""the Habs were successful overall.""  It was specifically about their success being a result of dump and chase and stretch passes.  Would you mind just telling me how many times I need to remind you of this before it sinks in?  Then we can get it over with in one go.   The Habs were a successful team this year. They used dump and chase and stretch pass a lot. It did not work all the time, but the team achieved success from it   Correlation is not causation, and while nobody is disputing that they were a successful team, there still isn't any evidence that it was on account of dump and chase it stretch passes, which again is what the argument was."

Why doubt its record?   The evidence that matters is what happened on the ice, not what happens on an analytics spread sheet   Exactly where the do you think the data on the spreadsheets comes from?  It kills me how most of the debates on this sub don't even concern hockey, per se. Hockey's just the topic that happens to be under discussion. Most of the debates are actually about research and statistical analysis, tools and procedures used in other fields every day.  The number of people here who will happily deny what even the soundest analysis shows is mind boggling. It's like hanging out with a bunch of anti-vaxxers or global warming deniers.   Do you realize how stupid you sound when you say, ""Hab's success should not be measured by any of those things, only on their record."" No, stop and think about it for a minute.

(That company's doing well now, who cares about its debt-load. Let's acquire it!)  And the ""not what happens on a spreadsheet"" argument? Yeah, you're trying to say that the numbers don't capture everything. Thanks, everybody knows that. Why not make a concrete point, point out exactly what it is that the numbers aren't capturing rather than just tossing out a ""Well, hey, maybe there's some things the numbers have missed but I don't know what they are and haven't really looked into it, but I'm sure you're wrong.

Habs,39yeil,Gabroux,1 point,Wed Jun 17 12:38:10 2015 UTC,"I would not move Plekanec, the Habs depth at center would be atrocious without him. DD can't play a 2-way game, Eller cannot produce enough for a top 6 line, and Galchenyuk needs the minutes DD gets to be effective.  Emelin I'd trade for second, maybe throw in a b list prospect to make it work.  Gilbert for a third works for me.  PAP for a 4-5th round pick if there is any taker, maybe a team trying to reach cap floor.  DD for a second seems fair to me.  Prust for a third would be great, he has a big cap hit for what he does/bring.  I threw these together quick, without much thougth, so take it with a grain of salt.  Realistically though, there are no legit sniper in free agency."
Habs,39yeil,quadriplegic_cheetah,5,Mon Jun 15 20:30:05 2015 UTC,"No screw you and your Eller bashing. Eller CAN be a top 6 forward. He doesn't play with top 6 linemates. If Eller were in DD's position, he would have put up 50 points this year. Eller is a better player than DD is, and at the moment he's outer second best centre (technically 3rd behind Plekanec and Galchenyuk)."
Habs,39yeil,habsdane,4,Mon Jun 15 23:55:56 2015 UTC,Agreed but without the angry parts. You can't say a guy being used in a non-offensive role cant produce offensively. Giroux didn't double his point totals coming out of nowhere because he became a special player. He stopped playing third fiddle to Richards/Carter.
Habs,39vque,Mustafarr,14,Mon Jun 15 04:53:37 2015 UTC,"I feel like I'm one of the few that actually likes Parenteau, and I feel he seemed pretty good playing alongside Chucky. In a contract year, I would expect him to reach close to 50 points with the whole team having a nice offensive season."
Habs,39vque,Kartias,6,Mon Jun 15 11:34:43 2015 UTC,Well he can go up.... But how hi can he go? Honestly he had concussion/injuries for a large chuck of the season. He was actually really effective at both the beginning and the end of the season. And he also scored the last game winner of the year. I think if(and that's a big if) he plays for us next year there is no reason not to expect 30-40 points barring injury.
Habs,39vque,quadriplegic_cheetah,3,Mon Jun 15 05:32:02 2015 UTC,"I would like to see him with at least 25G-25A numbers next year, but can he do it? That depends on a combination of his conditioning, his overall health, his line pairings, and MT loosening the defensive strings a bit."
Habs,39vque,HammerOfTheSlobs,2,Mon Jun 15 15:55:33 2015 UTC,"Even if Parenteau does not have a good season next year, we can'T label him as Bourque. Parenteau tries, he's just as talented as people made him to be, Bourque was just a lazy fuck who could only fine excuses for his poor play"
Habs,39vque,Gabroux,1 point,Tue Jun 16 12:44:08 2015 UTC,"I think Parenteau is good enough, but he doesn't fit in our lineup. He's not a true goal scorer, nor is he physical, the two things we need. He's a kind of all-around player à la Plekanec and Galchenyuk. The problem is that we already have those two in the top 6, plus Desharnais who can't score or hit either. That's why even Weise, although less talented, is a better fit."

Plekanec can score 50 when playing mostly defensive duties. Bozak is not very good and also getting older (29) so if he declines even a tiny bit he'll have a hard time scoring 40 a year on a line with top players.

Habs,39vwmc,MessageBoard,-1,Tue Jun 16 16:14:04 2015 UTC,He is the same thing as Eller. Actually has less talent but is better defensively. Playing with Kessel and JVR will boost anyones numbers.
Habs,39vwmc,habsdane,-1,Mon Jun 15 08:10:02 2015 UTC,Yeah he's a very similar player to Eller. We don't need a second line center man.

Habs,39qc3x,Microdinosaurus,22,Sat Jun 13 18:48:12 2015 UTC,"Wow, what a deal. That's a great deal for him to grow with.  MB with another key signing."
Habs,39qc3x,Staks,18,Sat Jun 13 19:00:31 2015 UTC,"Calling it. Chucky getting a bridge contract and MB going for the cup in next 2 years.  Edit: This is because after the next 2 years we will be facing some pretty insane contract signings à la Patches, Price, etc. The next few years are critical at filling in the gaps while we have these superstars at bargain prices."
Habs,39qc3x,Gabroux,12,Sat Jun 13 19:02:59 2015 UTC,"WOW nice good job Master Wizard MB. 65.1 millions already in place for 2 goalies, 7 defencemen and 10 forwards. Galchenyuk and Flynn//Mitchell are next"
Habs,39qc3x,Vegaz77,12,Sat Jun 13 18:55:40 2015 UTC,"Fantastic.  He's shown great strides this season.  He'll definitely challenge for top 4 minutes, this year, maybe even pushing for top pairing (highly optimistic!)?  Excellent value for the next 2 years.  If he plays with Petry, that's just 6.5M combined for the 2nd pairing.  At least for now.  Not bad."
Habs,39qc3x,Gabroux,7,Sat Jun 13 19:04:13 2015 UTC,Pushing for top pairing is a big stretch IMO. He would have to face the best forwards of the NHL while having to back Subban's crazy rushes. Not this year for Beaulieu
Habs,39qc3x,hogglescharms,10,Sat Jun 13 19:56:53 2015 UTC,Happy to see he's got a deal for the next two years. He's a great part of our defensive core and it'll be awesome to see him keep improving.
Habs,39qc3x,BinaryChode,5,Sat Jun 13 18:52:36 2015 UTC,good deal
Habs,39qc3x,Muter91,5,Sat Jun 13 18:53:46 2015 UTC,Great deal for the fourth best defense man on the team. Good steal.
Habs,39qc3x,DevmasterJ,3,Sat Jun 13 19:41:15 2015 UTC,Really good news. Hell of a job MB
Habs,39qc3x,fatneszsebby,3,Sat Jun 13 19:24:57 2015 UTC,Holy crap what a deal! This leaves quite some space for Chucky and mitchell. Still some contracts must go though.
Habs,39qc3x,jo_maka,2,Sat Jun 13 20:56:44 2015 UTC,And I'm pretty sure Larionov will get Chucky on a bridge so he can cash out PK-style

Habs,39qc3x,MessageBoard,2,Sat Jun 13 20:13:13 2015 UTC,Fair price for what he's accomplished so far. I'm not sure why some people thought he'd get more. We still have enough cap space for the rest of our guys plus a little bit. I'd guess PAP/Gilbert are moved at the draft. Maybe bought out in PAP's case so we have room to sign/trade for a top 6 forward to finish our lineup.
Habs,39qc3x,bsaures,4,Sun Jun 14 01:21:55 2015 UTC,Pretty  typical contract for a dman who played less than 16 mins a game. Good on mb not to overpay

Habs,39r20h,Vulpix_Rising,22,Sun Jun 14 13:57:20 2015 UTC,Yes please. I would like a 35 goal scorer.
Habs,39r20h,Muter91,10,Sat Jun 13 23:42:42 2015 UTC,another* 35 goal scorer. Having him and Patches headlining our top 2 lines would be pretty sick
Habs,39r20h,alobro1,2,Sun Jun 14 06:17:47 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. Now would you like to see an all American line of Max-Alex-Phil? Or split the offense up a bit, say, Max-Tomas-Phil and Sven (Andrighetto)-Alex-Brendan?"
Habs,39r20h,Muter91,1 point,Sun Jun 14 18:26:29 2015 UTC,Seeing as we've always been a team thats relied on one line for our offence it would probably be best to split them up
Habs,39r20h,alobro1,1 point,Mon Jun 15 04:26:52 2015 UTC,Agreed.

Habs,39r20h,fatneszsebby,1 point,Sun Jun 14 00:15:56 2015 UTC,"Would probably be a better prospect than tinner, or would have to be tinner+another prospect (Thomas+Bournival)"

Habs,39r20h,Razorback101,3,Sun Jun 14 16:20:10 2015 UTC,Those are still positions teams need to fill. And a big guy who's not a liability on the ice is a plus in my book.
Habs,39r20h,HLef,1 point,Sun Jun 14 16:39:00 2015 UTC,Um no. I want Kessel yes but I couldn't deal with Plek on the leafs
Habs,39r20h,paul_33,3,Mon Jun 15 16:34:14 2015 UTC,That listing(if true) make it actually  likely that they wont have to give up as much. Looking at the teams chi la min bos phi are in way too much cap hell to afford him. Nyr have some space but stepan still needs a contract which wont come cheap eating almost all there cap while still needing 4 more forwards. If pitt goes cheap on d is the only real competition and with the contracts to crosby and malkin they likely wont sheel out that much for 1 player
Habs,39r20h,bsaures,3,Sat Jun 13 23:01:21 2015 UTC,"We would have to make room on the roster for Kessel, which means p.a (and his 4m cap hit) will have to go some place else."
Habs,39r20h,LegendaryWolfee,-9,Sat Jun 13 23:09:03 2015 UTC,The guy is a whiner and complainer who's never ventured into the defensive zone. We do not want or need him.
Habs,39r20h,bigguy1231,15,Sun Jun 14 01:08:09 2015 UTC,"He plays for a bad team though. We do want him, 40+ goals is exactly what we need."
Habs,39r20h,fatneszsebby,6,Sun Jun 14 01:37:56 2015 UTC,Seriously. this guy manages to put up 40 goals on the fucking leafs. we could use someone like that.
Habs,39r20h,Kain292,-2,Sun Jun 14 07:38:44 2015 UTC,"I just thought this out a little, correct me on something if i'm wrong. Lets say Emelin waives his NTC. Trade Emelin for a 2nd or 3rd pick (idk just a pick). Thats 4Mil right there. Next the big trade, Paps, Tinner (Or Mcarron), 1st, 4th (next year or later). I think that trade would go through. So since Paps and Emy take up 8il combined, you have enough space for Phil. Now, at this point we only have 2Mil and a bit to resign Chucky and Mitchell, trade DD for someone with less cap, resign Chucky. Then let some AHL guys walk, but if Tinner were the one to go instead of Mcarron, we would have freed up 1Mil in cap, so enough to resign Mitchell. There, you got Kessel and resigned everyone."
Habs,39r20h,fatneszsebby,3,Sun Jun 14 16:39:50 2015 UTC,"We would have won a cup this year if we had Kessel on our top line instead of Weise. Our lineup is fine defensively, we need someone who can score a fucking goal."
Habs,39r20h,MessageBoard,-3,Sun Jun 14 02:03:15 2015 UTC,The guy is a minus 34 in the plus minus. If he scores 34 goals that would make us even. For the money we can do alot better. Playing 4 on 5 everytime he gets on the ice because he's standing at centre ice waiting for a pass would wear on his teammates like it has in Toronto after a little while.
Habs,39r20h,bigguy1231,2,Sun Jun 14 18:14:23 2015 UTC,"No one said anything about Jeff Petrys plus minus, why? Because it doesn't determine if a player is skilled or not. If that's the case paciorrety > Sydney Crosby, this season, and we all know that isn't true."
Habs,39r20h,LegendaryWolfee,1 point,Sun Jun 14 19:28:31 2015 UTC,"That's not how +/- works, he'd have needed to have had 34 more points than he had to break even.  With Markov slowing up and Subban not quite the best defensive D out there I wouldn't bring in a floater with no backcheck to his game whatsoever to play on the top line."
Habs,39r20h,Emperor_Billik,-3,Sun Jun 14 20:59:25 2015 UTC,"A first round pick, Scherbak, Tinordi and Parenteau is what I would offer. Dunno about if our cap would allow it, if not swap Tinner with Emelin."
Habs,39r20h,poytri,1 point,Sun Jun 14 08:47:09 2015 UTC,Our cap would explode. Of those only Parenteau costs us much but way less than Keseel.
Habs,39r20h,Fabien_Lamour,1 point,Sun Jun 14 12:49:30 2015 UTC,PAP is about half of Kessel... I would give any other prospect than Scherbak
Habs,39r20h,Razorback101,1 point,Sun Jun 14 16:21:23 2015 UTC,We'd need to move Emelin and Pap cap-wise
Habs,39r20h,HammerOfTheSlobs,1 point,Mon Jun 15 00:15:11 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure Emelin is on about $4mil AAV so this trade would be almost cap neutral

Habs,39r20h,Lifegear,7,Sun Jun 14 13:15:45 2015 UTC,The leafs wouldn't even take a look at that deal

Habs,39r20h,alex0816,3,Sun Jun 14 00:57:53 2015 UTC,We don't need a top-talent RW who can score a lot of goals? What do we need then?
Habs,39r20h,JMPesce,10,Sun Jun 14 21:08:40 2015 UTC,We do need him.
Habs,39qi5w,LegendaryWolfee,8,Sat Jun 13 19:42:16 2015 UTC,"If Toronto does not retain any salary, I doubt that it's possible for the Habs to get Kessel."
Habs,39qi5w,Gabroux,20,Sat Jun 13 20:13:29 2015 UTC,It's not for us.  Division rivals. Shanny will make us bleed.  We might as well look somewhere else.
Habs,39qi5w,jo_maka,4,Sat Jun 13 20:17:34 2015 UTC,"You never know.  The Leafs/Habs were trying to do that Gorges deal last summer before he nixed it.  I know that's different, though. Still, both because of his contract and his NTC (which apparently he'll waive for the Habs), there's going to be a pretty specific market for Kessel - and if the Habs are a tenable part of it, something might be able to be worked out."
Habs,39qi5w,iamfromtoronto,3,Sun Jun 14 03:51:41 2015 UTC,"no, you cant have him. i dont care if you give your first rounders for the next 5 years, kessel will never be a canadian (leaf fan, sorry for intruding)"

Habs,39qi5w,quadriplegic_cheetah,5,Sat Jun 13 22:19:10 2015 UTC,"I honestly think that we would overpay for this guy. I mean, I would kill someone to get him on our team, he has some friends on our team (PK, Patches). But I think we are way too tight in cap space to sign him."
Habs,39qi5w,fatneszsebby,-1,Sun Jun 14 02:16:36 2015 UTC,"Plekanec, a first and _______________?"
Habs,39qi5w,chrislopez_,33,Sat Jun 13 21:01:43 2015 UTC,I don't see why Toronto would be intested into Plekanec. They want to rebuild and a 32 years old forward on his contract year is not what Toronto needs
Habs,39qi5w,Gabroux,1 point,Sat Jun 13 19:58:47 2015 UTC,We would take him - only to flip him. But we would need Fucale. We have no hope coming as far as a goalie
Habs,39qi5w,gmoney1393,0,Sat Jun 13 20:14:55 2015 UTC,But he's also a 2 way center that they could use now for a couple of years until the rebuild actually kicks into effect.
Habs,39qi5w,chrislopez_,7,Sun Jun 14 06:02:26 2015 UTC,Which would be true if he wasn't on his contract year. There's no way that Plekanec would sign with a bottom feeder team like Toronto
Habs,39qi5w,Gabroux,-1,Sat Jun 13 20:28:31 2015 UTC,True that
Habs,39qi5w,chrislopez_,1 point,Sat Jun 13 20:52:01 2015 UTC,But even if you have him for a year. The leafs could use a solid two way forward and he will give his all since it's his contract year and you also get a first and a solid prospect. I don think it's a loss for the leafs.
Habs,39qi5w,chrislopez_,0,Sat Jun 13 20:54:38 2015 UTC,"The leafs don't want or have any need for a 32 year old centre who takes a spot away from our younger, more talented guys when we're trying to start from scratch"
Habs,39qi5w,Macknhoez,0,Sat Jun 13 20:55:45 2015 UTC,it wouldnt be about plekanec it would be about the pick and the prospect. im positive theyd want a young d of ours
Habs,39qi5w,NastyKnate,2,Sun Jun 14 14:14:46 2015 UTC,"I don't think saying Sherbak would be out of the question. But plekanec, 1st, and sherbak, while being a good deal for us, Toronto would probably get a better deal else where. Might have to add one more"

Bergy would never part with his first rounders before they make the Bigs. If BigMac looked like a reach, Scherbak was a no-brainer that had no business falling to us. He's not going anywhere."
Habs,39qi5w,jo_maka,2,Sat Jun 13 20:08:42 2015 UTC,fans and media demanding for a top 6 forward. Why not go all in with a 40 goal scorer?
Habs,39qi5w,chrislopez_,6,Sat Jun 13 20:44:46 2015 UTC,Fan and media does not make a good management reasoning.  Having a 40 goal scorer is wonderful. Selling the farm to get him is a terribly awful move. That's creating other holes to fill.  We're building a contender. Not pimping a scrapbook into a Pulitzer with one move.
Habs,39qi5w,BusShelter16,4,Sat Jun 13 21:08:40 2015 UTC,giving scherbak is not giving up he farm.
Habs,39qi5w,Macknhoez,4,Sat Jun 13 21:22:54 2015 UTC,Scherbak is arguably our best prospect with huge potential. I wouldn't want to lose him.
Habs,39qi5w,BusShelter16,1 point,Sat Jun 13 21:57:12 2015 UTC,The leafs would want gally + if you're not going to entertain sherbak+ 1st+ de la rose
Habs,39qi5w,chrislopez_,1 point,Sun Jun 14 01:08:14 2015 UTC,I know. That's why I don't want to trade for Kessel because I know what the cost would be.
Habs,39qi5w,XBM04,1 point,Sun Jun 14 14:17:35 2015 UTC,But I get that in 2-5 years our team could definately be a Stanley cup finalist once a few rookies move up from our farm team. So maybe having kessel now might not benefit us in 5 years. (Hypothetically if we actually got kessel.)
Habs,39qi5w,Alfr_d,2,Sun Jun 14 23:20:37 2015 UTC,"Scherbak is a good prospect. But he is not a guaranteed 30 goals, 65-75 points like Kessel. I'd include him if need be"
Habs,39qi5w,bigguy1231,0,Sat Jun 13 22:02:51 2015 UTC,We'd probably have to sacrifice the Galchenyuk signing to get him.

If they'd tanked during the years that Ovechkin, Crosby, Kane, Stamkos, or Tavares were available, they might have a much better team right now. Nail Yakupov, while I think he'll be a great goal scorer, isn't an elite talent like those guys. Hall might be if he could stay healthy, but still a step below them, IMO, just like RNH. They learned their lesson and FINALLY got the 1st overall pick with an elite-elite prospect available to them."

If his numbers are for real and not a fluke, as a 6-foot 176 18-year-old he could grow into NHL gold in the next couple of years: a big grinder with a scoring touch. His CHL playoff numbers this year are pretty bad though... 0 points and -4 in 3 games."

Habs,39ckgy,dearyleary,1 point,Thu Jun 11 02:16:05 2015 UTC,not sure how much you watched of him. he was actually quite strong out there and i would consider him a force down the middle since switching. he does need to work a bit on endurance but the play through the middle has helped him massively in developing.
Habs,39c39j,hkycoach,3,Wed Jun 10 19:31:01 2015 UTC,I could see Svechnikov dropping to us similar to Scherbak last year. Which would fantastic. I think him or Zboril would be the best outcome. Chabot or Jeremy Roy would be great too. If none of them are availible then I hope we get Boeser or Bittner.

Habs,398iwb,Soutael,-1,Wed Jun 10 01:05:02 2015 UTC,Why so? They got Vorachek and some younger players coming up. For the right price of course. His cap is quite low for his capabilities.
Habs,398iwb,quadriplegic_cheetah,11,Wed Jun 10 01:14:04 2015 UTC,Which is why he's an asset. You can never have enough good contracts. It just gives you more freedom as a GM.
Habs,398iwb,Fabien_Lamour,2,Wed Jun 10 01:45:19 2015 UTC,"Stop looking at trades from only one way. You're still looking at it from a Habs fan perspective only. It makes no sense for Philly to trade Simmonds.  The Flyers priority is to relieve some cap in defense, not getting rid of a fan favorite on a great contract. On the other hand they have one of the most expensive defense brigade and they're not getting the job done."
Habs,398iwb,phillyapple,3,Wed Jun 10 13:45:33 2015 UTC,"As a flyers fan, you're absolutely right. Holmgren left us in a bad cap situation with dumb contracts for our abysmal defense and that is what Hextall is focusing on fixing. There is no reason for Hextall to move Simmonds and we'd probably burn the Wells Fargo Center down if he did."

Habs,398iwb,jo_maka,2,Thu Jun 11 16:47:49 2015 UTC,Obviously they'd give him up for over payment but he costs them almost nothing and is a 1/2 RW who is only playing second line because Voracek is there. Don't get me wrong if we could get him for a decent price then he's like top 3 RW I would like to see added.
Habs,398iwb,BinaryChode,5,Wed Jun 10 02:56:11 2015 UTC,Yes yes yes !!!  Umm....how much ?
Habs,398iwb,caladin,4,Wed Jun 10 01:22:39 2015 UTC,"He would be an amazing addition, exactly what the habs need."

Habs,398iwb,Muter91,2,Wed Jun 10 01:20:56 2015 UTC,Philly would have to be completely fucked in the head to even consider trading him.
Habs,398iwb,BuddhasLittleWarlock,4,Thu Jun 11 14:01:37 2015 UTC,So you're saying there's a chance?
Habs,398iwb,comeupoutdawatah,1 point,Thu Jun 11 23:18:32 2015 UTC,"If they're going to do it, they'd probably make us take a bad contract like Andrew MacDonald or Luke Schenn along with him, just to even the value."
Habs,398iwb,Gabroux,1 point,Wed Jun 10 03:13:15 2015 UTC,"I wrote here months ago about getting Simmonds. He's my dream RW for the Habs, but I find it very unlikely to happen.   The Flyers know they have some major pieces and are on their way to being a good team once again. They have a bonafide all-star in Giroux, a newly established force in Voracek, a Patches-level contract for the man of the hour Simmonds, and a slew of young talent in guys like Couturier, Gudas and B. Schenn. Guys like Streit and Raffl are needed to get the job done too. If Mason is their guy, and he plays to the level they think he can, they're on their way to being a real contender.   I just think the Flyers aren't in a rush to get rid of a guy like Simmonds. His contract is too good and they have other pieces they'd rather try to get rid of (however impossible that may be - looking at you, Vincent). But even if the situation is worse than I may see it, I think Simmonds' contract makes him unlikely to go since he's an affordable, top-level option hitting his prime. Same reason we wouldn't trade Patches.   But if it DID happen, I think it would take Markov or Beaulieu, Tinordi, a 2nd pick and maybe a prospect like McCarron. There might be a chance to swap a few bad contracts for a swap."
Habs,398iwb,comeupoutdawatah,1 point,Wed Jun 10 01:29:14 2015 UTC,"I really don't have the same view as you about the Flyers. Beside Voracek, Giroux and Simmonds their attack is really dry. B. Schenn and Couturier are overhype IMO. They have awful contracts (Lecavalier, MacDonald, Umberger). Their defense is a wasteland and even though they have good prospects (Gotisbehere, Hagg, Morin, etc.), it's unlikely that they can and will be the top 4 defencemen material that the Flyers needs this early in their career. Also who knows if Mason will stay as good.  That's my 2 cents on the Flyers"

Habs,398iwb,peskysens,1 point,Wed Jun 17 00:01:01 2015 UTC,"Yep, he definitely sounds great! So, umm, trade him for Patches? Cause I doubt the flyers would trade him unless it makes sense on their end too."
Habs,398iwb,Batmarde,1 point,Wed Jun 10 02:43:20 2015 UTC,Of course you want him. Every team in the NHL would want him. But his cost wouldn't be realistic to MTL. His cap hit is low and his output is high there is no way a cap strapped team like Philly moves him unless its for Gally + which MTL shouldn't and wouldn't do.
Habs,398iwb,peskysens,1 point,Thu Jun 11 02:04:43 2015 UTC,"Simmonds might be a slight upgrade over Gally.  They're both young, on good contracts.    I'd be willing to give up Gally + a pick.  But I don't think Philly would do that."
Habs,398iwb,Batmarde,1 point,Thu Jun 11 16:25:40 2015 UTC,"I think it addresses the wrong issue in mtl for that trade. Gally is a promising large centre, while Simmonds is another winger.   To me MTL needs to be going after a pure goal scorer. Kessel, Oshie (sort of), Williams, Sharp etc."
Habs,395qe0,hkycoach,7,Tue Jun 9 13:17:19 2015 UTC,"IMO, people need to temper their expectations of McCarron both ways. I keep hearing that he's either a total bust and horrible pick or that he's going to score 20+/ year and is the solution to all our problems.  I think he's gonna be a Brian Boyle or Bryan Byckell: a serviceable bottom 6 forward with size, which is always nice to have, especially in the playoffs, but no game changer."
Habs,395qe0,TurboDragon,3,Tue Jun 9 21:25:03 2015 UTC,I would say his peak is a 2nd 3rd liner who can score 30-40 points in a defensive role. However that peak is very possible.
Habs,395qe0,quadriplegic_cheetah,1 point,Wed Jun 10 16:55:20 2015 UTC,"I agree that he might have a bit more of an offensive game than the players I mentionned. He already seems to have well undertood that he needs to park himself in front of the net.  However, in my opinion, there's a lot of uncertainty surrounding whether he'll reach his potential. His first junior season numbers were pretty bad, and there is a ton of NHL players who tore up juniors as 19 year olds only to underperform in the big league. For example, Smith-Pelly had as many points as McCarron in his last season in the OHL. Moreover, his size makes me extra-doubtful; large guys take longer to ""grow into their game""."
Habs,395qe0,TurboDragon,2,Wed Jun 10 17:26:54 2015 UTC,"McCarron also outsourced Getzlaf and Lucic though as well. Who have a similar frame. I don't think he's going to score like those two (obviously) cbut I'm just pointing out that junior production is not always something to go by when looking for how they will transition. Especially for larger players. They can be very unpredictable. Predicting point totals is not a simple task. The thing I love about McCarron is that he plays his position so well. Always going back to support the defense, and even leading the breakout sometimes. McCarron understands that he is a perimeter player/net front presence, and that in order to be successful he's gotta be in those areas. In conclusion one of the reasons why I am so excited with him, is because he seems to be a smart player, and plays the big winger role really well."
Habs,395qe0,quadriplegic_cheetah,1 point,Wed Jun 10 20:30:29 2015 UTC,"I agree. At one point, I entertained thoughts of him being a bigger Marian Hossa, but I think that ship has sailed."
Habs,395qe0,stretchmeister,7,Tue Jun 9 21:49:07 2015 UTC,I'm really excited about him! If he can translate his size well to the NHL he could become a real force for us. I loved how he looked during training camp and pre-season till he got hurt.
Habs,395qe0,TheMoonPrune,3,Tue Jun 9 13:58:48 2015 UTC,After watching him live at the colisée during the memorial cup he is definitely the prospect I'm the most excited about.
Habs,395qe0,televisionceo,-2,Tue Jun 9 14:28:21 2015 UTC,Hehe :)
Habs,395qe0,jo_maka,2,Tue Jun 9 15:05:45 2015 UTC,"I think his size translates to the NHL. He was pretty dominant physically in the pre-season games (although it sucks he got injured and couldn't finish). I think the main concern is does his hockey IQ and scoring translate or not. And if it does, on what line? It one thing to be productive up until the AHL, it's much harder in the NHL."
Habs,395qe0,zeMVK,3,Tue Jun 9 21:55:01 2015 UTC,I really hope we don't trade him.

Habs,398p16,Muter91,1 point,Wed Jun 10 14:16:26 2015 UTC,While it does factor in zone starts the maps have a signifigant flaw in not adjusting for qoc which in the case of sekac and dsp there was a signifigant differance in qoc which explains the differance
Habs,398p16,bsaures,1 point,Wed Jun 10 14:43:08 2015 UTC,"It may explain the difference, but I would contend that if DSP is having that negative of an impact, perhaps he should play similar minutes to Sekac then.  Basically, if he can't hack it against his QoC, then give him more sheltered minutes.  But again, it's just an interesting look at the stats.  Not sure why it's so unpopular :\"
Habs,398p16,Muter91,1 point,Wed Jun 10 15:20:57 2015 UTC,"Stats that disprove some people's preconceived ideas of how certain players effect their respective team are either ignored or down voted. Cognitive dissonance or denial, take your pick! Thanks for posting this, mimicohero does good work."
Habs,398p16,bsaures,2,Wed Jun 10 15:46:18 2015 UTC,"I figured it is most likely some dissonance, just like when you look at DD's numbers and see he's actually not terrible as a 1C ::GASP::  But I like my internet points too much to post those charts."
Habs,398p16,Muter91,0,Wed Jun 10 15:55:31 2015 UTC,"Ya he probably needed a bit easier of an assignment  but someone has to play harder mins.  I personally dont have a problem with  things like this its more the problem of people who take the simple possession stats from them  as a be all end all for evaluating  players. There are numerous factors that affect corsi and fenwick numbers from zonestarts (which the supposed zone start adjustments often very shakily try to adjust for), quality of competition, teamates, tim on ice to name a few. The dd elller comparison is a perfect example in this case. Many people on here complain about  eller not getting the ice that dd gets but based on these charts dd is wholly justified in getting the role over him."
Habs,398p16,bsaures,1 point,Wed Jun 10 17:38:44 2015 UTC,Yeah if the tables factored in ZS it would look even worse for DSP! Edit: can't spell
Habs,398p16,Muter91,1 point,Wed Jun 10 15:43:12 2015 UTC,There was a 1.2% zs% differance 5 on 5 between the two. Dsp most common line combination was eller and dlr so no they played almost  exactly the same linemates dsp however faced above average competition while sekac was heavily sheltered
Habs,398p16,bsaures,0,Wed Jun 10 15:50:54 2015 UTC,With the Habs? Not even close bud. And how often did the team win with either player in the line up? Now that's how you really evaluate a player!
Habs,398p16,Muter91,2,Wed Jun 10 16:00:37 2015 UTC,Overall during the year which is what the charts measure bud. Ohh and i didnt see the highlight video of jiri's playoff contribution....oh wait his biggest highlight was eating THREE hotdogs in one game in the pressbox. And the in and out for him was simple they won 2 series that he rode the pine and lost the only series he played in.
Habs,398p16,blackleaf2,0,Wed Jun 10 17:14:18 2015 UTC,"I must have missed the hot dog eating highlight, but can you really blame him?

You'll learn soon enough, young grasshopper.   As for your ""in and out"", I can't even. You continue to amaze me with your in depth analysis, bsaures."

We're already close to the cap, and Chicago needs to shed salary so they won't take any of the guys people seem to want to trade (DD, PAP, Emelin, Gilbert). We're not exactly stacked prospect wise so I don't know what they'd want."

Habs,393lca,Tetembe,1 point,Wed Jun 10 02:19:23 2015 UTC,Credibility is questionable. Still fun to think of a team with Marleau or Oshie. I think Oshie could be had... I've seen video when Doug Armstrong spoke very highly of Pleks... Very interesting.
Habs,393lca,willhabs,3,Tue Jun 9 03:57:39 2015 UTC,Pleky is better than Oshie.
Habs,393lca,BuddhasLittleWarlock,1 point,Tue Jun 9 12:54:45 2015 UTC,"But I don't think that they take Plekanec without another Center going back. St. Louis has a veritable log jam at center, with Berglund, Backes, Steen, Oshie, Lehtera, Ott, (possibly Sobotka) and Stastny. Unless Armstrong's plan is to put Plekanec on the wing, I don't know how that's going to work out."
Habs,393lca,willhabs,2,Tue Jun 9 13:11:19 2015 UTC,Yeah he was implying we'd trade Pleky for Oshie but that doesn't make sense for either team. Oshie and Steen play mostly wing but still STL and MTL both have too many centres so we're not good trading partners.
Habs,393lca,Tetembe,1 point,Tue Jun 9 14:36:52 2015 UTC,I agree that the trading partners don't line up and makes this unlikely. I wouldn't call Oshie a centre though. I think he only took a handful of faceoffs all season. Regardless I just see him as a  good fit for the team. I love his play and he's always strong on the puck. Wishful thinking.
Habs,3958oc,jshare,8,Tue Jun 9 10:10:52 2015 UTC,This makes little sense for several reasons.   He will be way too pricey. There hasnt been much buzz because of the playoffs but even looking just at a stat sheet will show teams that he is arguably the best centre in the market especially given his age. There will be atleast 1 team that throws a 4-5 year 3-4 million  per deal and thats something  we can't  and shouldn't  match He is a natural centreman who isnt a first line aka the farthest thing  from a need we have several centres who can play the 2nd-4th line centre role including plekanac dd elller prust dlr hudon mccarron dumont mitchell if he is resigned. We have more than enough centres we need a natural winger. His playing style suggest that he wont transfer well to the wing. The biggest nock on him from bruins fans was that he wouldnt win puck battles in the corner which as a wi ger is a huge part of your job. He also doesnt shoot the puck a lot something we also need out of wingers.   There are plenty of options that make way more sense if we are going to put uo the amounts required to pay  him

Habs,38zouj,lurkerdontpost,7,Mon Jun 8 04:42:58 2015 UTC,I didn't understand his point. How would we be saving cap space by getting Koivu? He could be good at the right price (not high) but his play has declined. He also has consistently choked during the playoffs.
Habs,38zouj,PuckingEh,5,Mon Jun 8 06:43:08 2015 UTC,"Unless it's a package like DD and Emelin or something like that, which isn't enough IMO, there's no trade that would make sense. He's just a taller, more injury prone Plekanec."
Habs,38zouj,willhabs,5,Mon Jun 8 12:58:51 2015 UTC,We could save money by making him wear #11?
Habs,38zouj,paulx441,0,Mon Jun 8 14:50:41 2015 UTC,"No thanks, 14 goals on the 1st line? I think bergivin would rather get someone like Sharp."
Habs,38y49p,CP31,-5,Sun Jun 7 20:54:29 2015 UTC,Spectacular season? Come on...
Habs,38y49p,LeMAD,0,Sun Jun 7 21:41:38 2015 UTC,What? He had an awesome season
Habs,38y49p,Razorback101,3,Sun Jun 7 21:42:58 2015 UTC,"He had the season a 1st round draft pick should have had, nothing more nothing less. Statistically it was a bit disppointing actually, especially the playoffs, but obviously the rest of his team was pretty weak offensively.  He's a good prospect, possibly our best, but he still has a lot of work to do before becoming a NHLer."
Habs,38y49p,LeMAD,6,Sun Jun 7 22:02:43 2015 UTC,He had the season a 1st round draft pick should have had   Exactly. That's called a spectacular season. Besides look at his linemates.... He's carrying the team in the o-zone.
Habs,38y49p,quadriplegic_cheetah,4,Sun Jun 7 22:26:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah...but most 1st round picks with this kind of season after being drafted never make it to the NHL.  At 100 points, it could have been called a great season. With 118 point in 59 games, Oliver Bjorkstrand had a spectacular season."
Habs,38y49p,LeMAD,1 point,Mon Jun 8 12:47:36 2015 UTC,Ummm yea they do...
Habs,38y49p,quadriplegic_cheetah,1 point,Mon Jun 8 13:40:43 2015 UTC,Most players also have atleast a semblance of competant linemates.  Bjorkstarnds team had better offensive third liners than what sherbak had as his linemates.   Sherbak is a very good offensive player but has nothing to work with in everett. You are just trying to find reasons to be a dick.
Habs,38y49p,bsaures,7,Mon Jun 8 13:10:06 2015 UTC,"Sherbak is a very good offensive player but has nothing to work with   Ach, he'll be a perfect fit for the Habs!"
Habs,38y49p,HammerOfTheSlobs,-1,Mon Jun 8 14:20:53 2015 UTC,"No, the dicks are the ones who will shit on him or the team because he won't develop into the player they thought he would, because we massively overhype our prospects, especially if they are Europeans."
Habs,38y49p,LeMAD,2,Mon Jun 8 13:19:35 2015 UTC,"I don't think anybody is overhyping him. He's expected to be a top 6 forward, and has not fallen off course as of yet."
Habs,38y49p,quadriplegic_cheetah,-4,Mon Jun 8 13:42:00 2015 UTC,"He's not ""expected"" to be top-6, he has the potential of becoming one."
Habs,38y49p,LeMAD,3,Mon Jun 8 13:46:09 2015 UTC,No... He's legitimately expected to be a top 6 forward. Probably a guy who can put up about 40-50 points a season.
Habs,38y49p,quadriplegic_cheetah,1 point,Mon Jun 8 13:47:23 2015 UTC,Agreed. Those articles always make people overhyped.
Habs,38y49p,KadruH,0,Sun Jun 7 22:59:11 2015 UTC,He really didn't. He struggled for huge stretches after Christmas. He had a good but not great season. Had a pretty crappy playoffs too. Nothing that would be cause for concern but nothing like Reways PPG season in a mens league to be labelled great.
Habs,38y49p,MessageBoard,3,Mon Jun 8 00:34:56 2015 UTC,People are vastly inderestimating how bad this team would have been without sherbak. They only have 1 other nhl draft pick who was a 6th rounder and only one guy prdicted to go on the draft this year. He proved he is an elite  offensive player ever if he has to carry shitty players. He would have easily topped 100 points with a competent linemate
Habs,38y49p,bsaures,2,Mon Jun 8 02:17:05 2015 UTC,He was on an even worse team last year and put up the same numbers.
Habs,38y49p,MessageBoard,1 point,Mon Jun 8 02:42:45 2015 UTC,Offensively  what he had to work with for linemates was a wash both teams lacked nhl prospects who were remotely close to him. The major swing was his ability to put up moee points while rounding out his game. Everett was a very defensive team so to put up that many points while keeping responsible is huge especially  because it makes it more likely he translates into the habs system. Theee is only so much he can do offensively without teamates  that can help him grow .
Habs,38zdjg,ClassActDude,10,Mon Jun 8 03:01:44 2015 UTC,Aren't all the threads in /r/Habs armchair GM threads?
Habs,38zdjg,HammerOfTheSlobs,3,Mon Jun 8 12:37:31 2015 UTC,"That Malkin idea look, yes, pretty expensive, but very interesting! I still trust Bergevin's plan on getting the habs better. He did a good job, as he said he would, putting a good defence core in front of Price. But i'm very curious to see what will be his moves this summer to improve our too obviously lack of scoring and PP effectiveness ( though I think that's Therrien's job for the PP...) We can't depend on good defence and the Priceless wall we have for a whole season.  I think if he could find a way of decreasing the pressure we have to deal with in our zone and transfer a bit of it in the other zone, our team would be a much more painful threat to deal with than it already is.  Bref, I can't wait for them to start playing again...  GO HABS GO"
Habs,38zdjg,DoubleDareU,2,Mon Jun 8 05:49:00 2015 UTC,"Get a better chair. Higher back, no arms. Lumbar support. One with smooth wheels.  Oh yeah, hum, GM stuff.   trade our top pick for lower picks.  trade P.-A.P., Eller, Markov and Desharnais for more picks or strong prospects/young players.  sign the remaining kids & Mitchell as well. Move prospects up to replace P.A.P., Eller, Markov and Desharnais. Hide all the C badges for another season. Throw money at the best P.P. specialist coach I can find. Find a great English/French tutor for Emelin. Get strength and conditioning coaches for ALL our prospects for the summer. Get them nutritionists, stylists and pimp their ride.  Assassinate Don Cherry's tailor. ?????? Profit!!!"
Habs,38zdjg,IBoris,8,Mon Jun 8 03:44:05 2015 UTC,"I agree with all you just said, except I'd like to see Markov retire in a Habs jersey, and I kinda like Eller."
Habs,38zdjg,Djeece,3,Mon Jun 8 04:09:52 2015 UTC,I kinda love Eller
Habs,38zdjg,quadriplegic_cheetah,1 point,Mon Jun 8 18:23:58 2015 UTC,"Love's not a strong enough word. When Therrien doesn't burn him, he's excellent defensively and almost always comes up with the puck after battles.  ...and I agree with the Markov sentiment. Bite the bullet for two more years, but he did have a good regular season and an average at best post."
Habs,38zdjg,ogie_oglethorpes_fro,1 point,Mon Jun 8 22:45:31 2015 UTC,He had a great regular season
Habs,38zdjg,quadriplegic_cheetah,3,Tue Jun 9 02:04:18 2015 UTC,"Its not the time to get rid of our core for some future prospect, its more time to sacrifice some prospect and solidify our core. Imo"
Habs,38zdjg,Julien_fucke_bouzzin,1 point,Mon Jun 8 18:21:51 2015 UTC,"I would argue that P.-A.P., Eller, Markov and Desharnais are not our core."
Habs,38zdjg,IBoris,3,Mon Jun 8 21:33:09 2015 UTC,I'd argue that Eller would be a crucial part of the defensive core of the forwards. He can be that two-way 3rd liner when given the chance.
Habs,38zdjg,ogie_oglethorpes_fro,0,Mon Jun 8 22:46:29 2015 UTC,"Personally, I don't like his attitude.   All the players that had a shit season were all about how they would work hard during the summer and improve their play. Eller? Not so subtle stabs at the coaching staff about his usage and his linesmates. I use to be a big supporter of him, he was in my mind Pleky's successor, but after seeing how he deals with hardship I'd want him out.   We have enough centers and I think De La Rose proved he could do the job with better faceoff skills.   He also has good value on the market and is signed up. He'd fetch a good return."
Habs,38zdjg,IBoris,2,Mon Jun 8 23:14:07 2015 UTC,"Well, he didn't have a shit season and he was right that his linemates are mediocre for his skill set. Therrien still employs ""scoring"" and ""checking"" lines pretty equally. The new NHL isn't like that anymore. You role 4 lines that can skate and 3 of which can bring a solid attack. Eller is perfect as that 3rd centreman with JDLR on his wing.  I do agree he can bring back some value, but trading a big centreman like him who steps his game up when it matters most....I wouldn't yet. And how has Therrien proven he plays young guys at Centre? Galchenyuk still hasn't gotten his shot, which he has shown he can produce(and those around him produce too...)"
Habs,38zdjg,ogie_oglethorpes_fro,1 point,Tue Jun 9 03:00:43 2015 UTC,"Still, its not the time to wait for a prospect, its time to go for it."
Habs,38zdjg,Julien_fucke_bouzzin,-1,Mon Jun 8 21:35:19 2015 UTC,"trade P.-A.P., Eller, Markov and Desharnais for more picks or strong prospects/young players.   I don't entirely disagree with you, but I don't think this year is the year."
Habs,38zdjg,IBoris,3,Mon Jun 8 21:48:15 2015 UTC,I'd like to never see Emelin put a Habs jersey on ever again.
Habs,38zdjg,Coldmonkey13,14,Mon Jun 8 03:32:19 2015 UTC,Emelin always gets underrated
Habs,38zdjg,SiegeWar,5,Mon Jun 8 04:51:01 2015 UTC,I'll agree with you on that. But I think Emelin would better serve us in a trade than in our system... The defense core was almost close with Petry's 5 years.
Habs,38zdjg,DoubleDareU,2,Mon Jun 8 05:59:24 2015 UTC,No he is not. He is paid like a top 4 and playing like a botom 6.
Habs,38zdjg,Julien_fucke_bouzzin,8,Mon Jun 8 18:22:57 2015 UTC,All defensemen are bottom 6

Habs,38u890,Slushyfarts,8,Sun Jun 7 00:55:33 2015 UTC,You know... Watching this it makes me realize DD is a steal at 3.5 mil.  He may not be a #1 center but the man can setup a play.
Habs,38u890,Staks,3,Sun Jun 7 14:26:49 2015 UTC,He's been getting ~50 points per season since his call-up. He's definitely a productive forward   Also anyone notice that every time he scores off a great feed he always just gives a staredown to the guy that gave him the puck
Habs,38u890,Batmarde,6,Sun Jun 7 22:14:50 2015 UTC,Patches is too legit!!

Habs,38ytra,mr_potroast,1 point,Mon Jun 8 01:39:03 2015 UTC,St-Louis asked for a trade and Richards went for a bigger contract.  I think it's normal for those 2 to be booed.  Boyle got trade so I dont know why they were booing him
Habs,38ytra,itsokqc,7,Tue Jun 9 22:55:24 2015 UTC,"People always boo the other team's best players, it's almost standard practice."
Habs,38ytra,athiestweed420,3,Mon Jun 8 01:06:20 2015 UTC,I think it's their right considering ticket prices.

In all honesty I think it's because he's known to dive, and everyone outside of Montreal hates him.  Edit:  Apparently some people need clarification. Do I think he dives? no. Has he been fined for it? Yes. Find me one team that likes Subban. I haven't been able to find one. And given the racist tweets in Boston last year, it isn't too much of a stretch to pin some of it to racism."
Habs,38ytra,Chuckpwnyou,4,Mon Jun 8 00:29:35 2015 UTC,"I really don't think that it's the racism thing. I think it's more about him being our best player besides Carey Price. And he has a reputation for being ""a whiner""."

Habs,38ytra,jimmybrite,-8,Mon Jun 8 02:02:41 2015 UTC,They can say what they want but because he's black it made me think they were racist as fuck.  Did they not think twice before booing him?
Habs,38ytra,damac_phone,5,Mon Jun 8 04:55:08 2015 UTC,Maybe since they also boo white players it has nothing to do with race?
Habs,38vhmk,Nothingiswrongwithme,33,Sun Jun 7 04:26:11 2015 UTC,"Bruins fan here. Soderberg is an awesome set-up man, with awesome vision (which is funny because he has only one eye). I believe if he had played with any ounce of skill on his wings he would have produced much more than he did playing with the stiffs in Boston. I'm no hockey expert (obviously because I'm a Bruins fan, hurr durr) but it looked to me like Soderberg made unbelievable passes that no one was expecting or just didn't have the hands to tap in. Thus, Soderberg would be a great fit on a line with skilled wingers. I pray to God he doesn't end up with a toilet seat on his chest next season because I really like him and want better for him than that. Alright, GFYs."

I'd prefer Galchenyuk, and trade Plekanec for a winger. Galchenyuk needs time to stay at Center."

Our best RD prospects are Pats and Lernout. I hope things get better for Dalton but I'm not sure we'll get to see him becoming a regular anytime soon.

Habs,38pvaq,Mustafarr,2,Mon Jun 8 17:59:09 2015 UTC,It would take around 3 first round picks+Plekanec+Tinordi+Hudon/Scherbak+A roster prospect
Habs,38pvaq,caladin,9,Fri Jun 5 22:16:58 2015 UTC,"I think you are right. Pittsburgh loses cap hit, and Plekanec makes sense for them. Second C behind Crosby, great two way. MB would have to clear salary elsewhere in a different deal to make this happen. I could see them giving less picks and including Parenteau (1 year left and was good with Taveres, maybe they'd give it a shot with Sid), or maybe they would even pry Gallagher. I'd hate to see him go, but it makes sense from Penguins perspective. Malkin would make this team instant contenders though, and that shouldn't be underestimated.  Patch-Malkin-X as the top your top line and x-Chuckie-x, x-Eller-x as second and third line centres would be extre depth down the middle, potentially thee big strong centremen. Top 4 D with Pk, Markov, Petry, Bealieu and Price in net. That lineup to me sounds like a contending lineup, Chuckie can be eased into centre without having to have the pressure of the top line.   I don't care what anyone says I am dreaming all I want that MB is going to make his mark on this team, because he still hasn't made that big roster move, I mean the kind of trade that happens once and defines a tenure, a legacy. MB has a vision and that includes a big strong scoring centremen.   What makes me giddy is Malkins no trade clause and him liking Montreal. Maybe MB heard rumours and gives them a call that is too enticing to refuse even if they weren't planning on trading him.   I really really really hope this dream comes true"

Habs,38nmg2,bsaures,5,Fri Jun 5 11:25:22 2015 UTC,No offense but using in and out of the line up stats is probably the worst way of determining how useful the player is. These are very shallow reviews of how these players effect the team.

Habs,38m1s4,bsaures,8,Fri Jun 5 02:28:12 2015 UTC,I suppose the next logical thing is to see what Gilbert brings to the table pretty please
Habs,38m1s4,My_McJingleBalls,3,Fri Jun 5 02:32:56 2015 UTC,Alright ive had a look at this is what it was without gilbert:  We went 5-3-2   Gf 30  GA 32  82 game point pace 98.4  Things that stood out:  Alot of these games went beyond 60 mins ( 6 of 10)  The schedule was actually decently tough with 5 of the 10 games against playoff teams and the 5 non games were the back to back games we lost to the sabres (painful) the panthers as they were still in the hunt and two close games with the leafs.  Ticker had 3 really bad games while he was out spiking the GA   The sample size was small but there was an impact.
Habs,38m1s4,My_McJingleBalls,2,Fri Jun 5 03:26:14 2015 UTC,Awesome. Thanks man. Could I trouble you for PAP and possible beau?
Habs,38m1s4,slayeryouth,2,Fri Jun 5 03:40:21 2015 UTC,Im working on a full one for Beaulieu like the post as he has been in and out of the lineup the last 3 years as well
Habs,38m1s4,quadriplegic_cheetah,4,Fri Jun 5 03:42:58 2015 UTC,I assumed as much i will put it together for this year as he didnt play for the habs the last two years.
Habs,38m1s4,slayeryouth,2,Fri Jun 5 02:44:46 2015 UTC,"I would think that the next step would be to look at who was replacing Emelin in the games he wasn't playing, and what other scratches and injuries it coincided with to give a more complete picture.  It would also be cool to know when winning and losing streaks started and stopped in relation to a player exiting and entering the lineup (for example, we lost a lot of games when Gomez got injured in the 2011-2012 season, but we were already losing a lot of games before he got injured, you know?). A team's record with or without any given individual player could be valuable information, but since that doesn't happen in a vacuum I'd hesitate to draw too many conclusions outside of saying ""this seems promising"" without knowing what else is going on.  Now with all of that said, putting all that data together is a pretty tall order, and I'm not going to do it nor do I expect anybody else too."
Habs,38m1s4,quadriplegic_cheetah,3,Fri Jun 5 19:09:42 2015 UTC,"Not a a lot of this is because of Emelin though. You're giving him credit where credit isn't due. I think he's a good piece on our roster as a depth defensemen, but painting as a vital asset on a winning team is a stretch."
Habs,38m1s4,Lyonel_Hutz,1 point,Fri Jun 5 18:02:04 2015 UTC,"My instinct is that since Emelin's numbers are bad to mediocre in pretty much every other category and his WOWY numbers leave a bit to be desired that there are other things going on.  My gut tells me that when looking at a teams performance with or without any given player there are a number of factors that need to be accounted for, but I'm also open to the idea that wins, losses, goals, etc. with that player's presence or absence as the only variable could provide valuable information.  Frankly I just don't know."
Habs,38m1s4,Cheydabob,2,Fri Jun 5 19:25:22 2015 UTC,It's the intangibles!
Habs,38m1s4,Gabroux,4,Fri Jun 5 19:28:38 2015 UTC,"I'm pumped to see this post, I noticed the same thing that when Emelin was out we seemed to lose much more often. I honestly think that f we trade anyone, it's Gilbert, seeing as how I feel Beaulie, Tinordi and patyren can easily fill in the rest of the D core. That being said we really need that winger or big centre. Possibly a trade involving Eller, Gilbert, Markov, or some combination of the two could possibly get us an upgrade."
Habs,38m1s4,Fenrir,3,Fri Jun 5 04:50:57 2015 UTC,"I like Emelin, but with the addition of Petry and the progression of Beaulieu, I feel his cap space would be better used on a top 6 forward.  If none are reasonable available, absolutely keep him and have an even better D-core."
Habs,38m1s4,Fenrir,3,Fri Jun 5 10:39:08 2015 UTC,"Then we need to trade Gilbert. Emelin brings something that our other defencemen lack, Gilbert is basically a poor version of Petry"
Habs,38m1s4,MD_BOOMSDAY,2,Fri Jun 5 15:23:06 2015 UTC,Congratulations on developing a statistic that reveals even less information than +/-.  Are you intentionally trying to mislead? Because this is literally the only set of stats you could have used to advance the argument you're trying to make. Pretty much everything else tilts in the other direction.
Habs,38m1s4,LaughingTrees,0,Mon Jun 8 18:28:36 2015 UTC,Lol aww someones a little butthurt that the actual results dont go along withyour deeply flawed possession stats.   There is nothing misleading about the numbers. There is enough data of him out of the lineup to draw reasonable conclusions that the team fares much better with him in the lineup. Maybe if you weent so blinded by corsi you  would see that.
Habs,38m1s4,jo_maka,3,Mon Jun 8 21:46:33 2015 UTC,"Why would I be butthurt by your using terrible statistics?    Maybe if you weent so blinded by corsi you would see that.   So, your contention is that this gives a better picture of a player than examining his actual time on ice?  Like, holy cow, you're not even arguing that Corsi doesn't give the whole picture. Your trying to make your case by saying, let's not actually look at what the player is contributing, let's look at what happens when he's around."

Habs,38l51e,Muter91,0,Fri Jun 5 00:04:53 2015 UTC,"A college defenseman by the looks of it, plays left. This could mean MB is looking at shipping out one of our other guys at left (probably either Emilen or Markov), but maybe not"
Habs,38l51e,quadriplegic_cheetah,9,Thu Jun 4 23:49:57 2015 UTC,"Markov still another year or two in him as a top pairing guy. No way are we trading him, not only because he's good, but also out of respect."
Habs,38l51e,Mikash33,2,Fri Jun 5 01:19:08 2015 UTC,"I agree he still has the skill level to be a top 6 defensemen, but he can't handle those minutes anymore.   He needs to keep his legs young for the playoffs next year."
Habs,38l51e,Mikash33,6,Fri Jun 5 01:48:28 2015 UTC,"I agree, AM needs to be a 2nd paring guy at the most next year, because he looked totally lost during parts of the playoffs this year."
Habs,38l51e,BinaryChode,2,Fri Jun 5 12:01:54 2015 UTC,"If they play him on the first line, they could take him off the PK to rest his legs a bit."
Habs,38l51e,quadriplegic_cheetah,2,Fri Jun 5 13:39:05 2015 UTC,"True, and probably spot him on the 2nd PP rather than the first, since I feel Petry might be better suited there. He made a bad PP look pretty good."

Habs,38l51e,quadriplegic_cheetah,-4,Fri Jun 5 05:06:56 2015 UTC,It's harder??? Based on what? Everyone knows the west is way tougher than the east. Did you just start watching hockey?
Habs,38l51e,BinaryChode,3,Fri Jun 5 07:08:11 2015 UTC,"It took 98 points to make the playoffs in the east & 99 in the west. Not sure where this whole ""easier"" thing came from."
Habs,38l51e,LegendaryWolfee,1 point,Fri Jun 5 12:20:58 2015 UTC,"The last three cup winners have come for the west, actually i'm going with 4 the hawks should win this one in 4 or 5. The last two years at least the real cup final has been the west final."
Habs,38l51e,Sharks9,3,Fri Jun 5 17:03:03 2015 UTC,"There are 16 teams in the East, there are 14 in the West. Right off the bat it's already harder for eastern teams. With 50% of them making it as opposed to 57%. Not to mention that when you look at the records between conferences, you realize that there aren't any significant differences. Certainly not enough to negate the fact that 57% of the teams make it in the West. So you really just failed to account for the basic math. Did you just start watching Hockey?"
Habs,38l51e,fromage1,-1,Fri Jun 5 17:30:05 2015 UTC,I like how you just used math incorrectly to back up your point ignoring the various other factors in the east vs west. Don't let that stop you from being ignorant though.

Habs,38l51e,LegendaryWolfee,2,Fri Jun 5 12:25:47 2015 UTC,Why first? You'd want to make sure he signs with you before you trade away. Then you have a better idea what you will need in return.

Trading him would be a stupid move. Just because he had a bad playoff doesn't mean he is instantly the worse player on our team.  Also, no trade clause. If we did trade Markov who would take his place? Petry? He's a RD, so that's not gonna work. Beau? Maybe 3 years from now, not anytime soon.

Habs,38imez,JediMasterZao,7,Thu Jun 4 15:11:44 2015 UTC,"He's also making $1.3 million more and signed for longer term.  4.1 million is rich for a third pairing defenceman.  I'd like to use the money (And term) on a forward, and I think that Pateryn, Beaulieu, Petry, Tinordi, would be physical enough in the lineup.  Gilbert can sit in the press box for all i care."
Habs,38imez,Commandant1,2,Thu Jun 4 15:14:03 2015 UTC,"Out of all these guys, only Pateryn demonstrated that he's capable of hitting like Emelin and he hasnt shown he can do it consistently. I do agree that 4M is expensive for a 3rd pairing guy, but with the cap at 70M and climbing, it's less and less so each year. I would much rather keep Emelin over Gilbert, 1.3 million is really not that much these days. Gilbert has no role to fill on this team."
Habs,38imez,JediMasterZao,5,Thu Jun 4 15:19:41 2015 UTC,Hitting is not about how hard it is... its about seperating the man from the puck and all of them have shown capable.  Emelin is a possession blackhole  Look at chicago... they play physical but they dont throw those huge hits.  The only thing emelin does better than say beaulieu or petry is throw the huge hit.. but when the other two are physical enough the value of that hit is minimal.
Habs,38imez,SubbyDoo,0,Thu Jun 4 15:32:22 2015 UTC,Emelin also starts alot more in his own end than the other pairings. Whenever he hasnt been put in a position to fail like last year emelin has been one of our better possesion players but you cant expect a guy whos starting alot more shifts in his own end with partners in gilbert and gonchar who were ill suited for that role to be successful. Emelin and petry were by far our best pairing in the playoffs because he dinally had someone who could play that role with him
Habs,38imez,bsaures,0,Thu Jun 4 15:42:58 2015 UTC,Wrong.  Even adjusting for zone starts and partner emelin is a below average guy.  With the same partners beaulieu has blown emelin out of the water possession wise.
Habs,38imez,SubbyDoo,2,Thu Jun 4 15:47:23 2015 UTC,"Wrong those players when palying with bealieu  were getting his massive zone push and extremely  easy competition compared to when they played with emelin because THE COACH DOESNT TRUST BEALIEU TO PLAY DEFENSE.  Emelin when he was put in the same role as bealieu had this year was better and unlike bealieu actually  put up some offense. Bealieu has only 13 points in 87 career games emelin had 14 in only 68 games despite not getting any of the pp time bealieu  gets.  Ultimately  the proof is in the record our record with emelin in the lineup for the full game this year put us on pace for 115 points over a 82 game season  Without when bealieu  had to ""step up"" our pace was 90 points so with bealieu taking on emelins role we miss the playoffs"
Habs,38imez,bsaures,1 point,Thu Jun 4 16:00:35 2015 UTC,You can get corsi and fenwick adjusted for zone starts though and even there emelin is a poor possession dman.
Habs,38imez,SubbyDoo,0,Thu Jun 4 16:10:20 2015 UTC,You can also measure quality of competition  and what those numbeds show is that bealieu was so ridiculously  shelteredit says a lot that his possesion stats werent better. Of the 197 dmen who played atleast 40 games only 22 had a weaker qoc 5 on 5 and of those 22 none had anything close to the quality of teamates bealieu had. What that says is not only was bealieu insulated with weak opponents but he was also given better linemates because they didn trust him
Habs,38imez,bsaures,1 point,Thu Jun 4 16:20:14 2015 UTC,The sample size on both those paces is incredibly low.  (Our team with emelin but no beau... or with beau but no emelin)
Habs,38imez,SubbyDoo,0,Thu Jun 4 16:07:39 2015 UTC,"If you  have the numbers to make your case, post them and make it.  Because as it stands what you're writing is incorrect and the ""we were on pace to get this many points with x player in the line up"" argument is on its face ridiculous.  Emelin put up a few more points than Beaulieu, but consistently hampered our offense by a significant margin in every single category. The differences in competition were negligible. Whether the coach trusts Beaaulieu is immaterial, because this is the same coach the played Murry until the entire season was on the line."
Habs,38imez,Fenrir,-2,Thu Jun 4 17:01:22 2015 UTC,"Hitting is not about how hard it is...   Haha that is so wrong. Hard (legal) hits wear & tear the other team's players, tires them quicker in the course of a game, it gets to the other team's player's head when they see one of their guy ass over heels and it will also sometimes literally take an opposing player out of the game in case of an injury. All of these things are very major advantages of hard hitting. I'd think someone who played hockey would know this very basic fact. Obviously, separating the player from the puck is important, but to pretend it's all there is to a hit is just ignorant.   As to his possession numbers, no doubt there.... since he's just not a possession d-man. Do you also base your evaluation of a goldfish on its ability to climb a tree?"
Habs,38imez,JediMasterZao,5,Thu Jun 4 15:35:39 2015 UTC,None of that has ever been proven to have an effect on wins.  You know what is proven to lead to more wins ... possession.  Look at the hawks.  Who us their big hitting dman? They dont have one and its not preventing their third cup in 6 years.  Emelin is better than Douglas murray but its ultimately the same issue.  As for playing hocket comments i did.. and in travel contact leagues... but thats just your ignorant assumption that i havent
Habs,38imez,SubbyDoo,-2,Thu Jun 4 15:40:11 2015 UTC,"Riiiiight, taking players out of a game, hurting players & getting in their heads does not impact the flow of a game. Suuuuuuuuuure.   Go back to NHL 2012 man, this discussion's over."
Habs,38imez,JediMasterZao,4,Thu Jun 4 15:41:44 2015 UTC,Next you will tell me we need a goon too.  Again who is the hawks big hitter?  As for your insults can you link me to your  hockeydb profile?
Habs,38imez,SubbyDoo,2,Thu Jun 4 15:44:15 2015 UTC,"Seabrook and Bickel throw big hits. Toews and Hossa are extremely physical power forwards, but dont really hit much. I'm a hawks fan and in general, I agree that it's one of the least important elements that you need in order to be successful. You can obviously build a team around it like LA or ANA and have it work very well, but it's not just some variable that you need X amount of. You build a grinding team that hits, or you dont."
Habs,38imez,Phridgey,0,Thu Jun 4 18:00:41 2015 UTC,"Like i said, over."
Habs,38imez,JediMasterZao,2,Thu Jun 4 15:44:57 2015 UTC,No he isn't. He's paid like top 4 but isn't a top 4
Habs,38imez,paul_33,5,Thu Jun 4 16:47:45 2015 UTC,I wouldn't be too sad if Lars Eller was traded away. Except you know that S.O.B. would probably have a career season if he left.
Habs,38imez,denjroll,9,Thu Jun 4 23:51:33 2015 UTC,The logical choice is markov or gilbert
Habs,38imez,bsaures,17,Thu Jun 4 14:39:36 2015 UTC,"I don't see Markov leaving, I think he is an important part of the team both on the ice and in the room. I think he finishes his two years in Montreal, then retires. Hopefully we can get him a cup before then."
Habs,38imez,titanstats,8,Thu Jun 4 14:59:47 2015 UTC,"Markov needs to play significantly less on the PK next season, and sit on more b2b situations.  His ice time was way too high after 82 games."
Habs,38imez,TheJustin72,-4,Thu Jun 4 15:11:04 2015 UTC,I'm ok with him staying but at a largely reduced role. The playoffs proved time has caught up with him
Habs,38imez,BinaryChode,9,Thu Jun 4 17:36:18 2015 UTC,"Right...so 82 games of him playing like a top 30 d-man in the league mean nothing?  It's just the 12 games where a lot of the team looked bad that show time has caught up with him?  Good god, has time caught up with Plekanec as well???  People have been saying as far back as 2012/2013 that Markov needs to have his minutes managed.  There's a differnece betewen him playing in a ""largely reduced role"" and him having his minutes managed.  I know Anaheim fell short in the WCF, but go and look at Beauchamins' regular season minutes vs. his playoff minutes.  They had a coach who realized the importance of having his best veteran d-man fresh when it mattered most, and so instead of playing 25 minutes a night he played around 22:20 per night.  As I see it, if they give Markov 5-10 games off over the course of the year (primarily b2b games or the 3rd game in 4 nights) as well as use him as a depth player on the PK he will once again be an elite d-man over 82 games...and he might just be able to keep that up through the playoffs as well.  Andrei Markov played the 11th most minutes in the entire NHL last season.  And he played them as an elite top pairing d-man.  His total on the year was 2017 minutes.  If they cut down his PK minutes significantly, and gave him predetermined nights off through the course of the season they could easily get that number down around 1800, without even really limiting his ES minutes over the course of the season.  Largely reduced role? No.  Just a coach who understands that it's illogical to play a 36 year old d-man more than 95% of the league.   Only 2 d-men ahead of him in ice time were over the age of 30, Keith (turns 32 this Summer) and Suter (turned 30 in January)"
Habs,38imez,TheJustin72,1 point,Thu Jun 4 18:25:46 2015 UTC,"Markov played the 11th most minutes in the entire NHL this season.... (regular season)... thats way too much.  He wasn't just good... he was EXCEPTIONALLY GOOD.  The top defence in the NHL for win shares this season. (Basically like WAR in baseball but for hockey... measures offence + defence and how many points we can guess your play accounted for, down by hockeyreference.com)  1) P.K. 2) Erik Karlsson 3) Roman Josi 4) Andrei Markov  He's still a top dman.  We just exhausted him this season."
Habs,38imez,Commandant1,3,Fri Jun 5 04:04:27 2015 UTC,Could not agree more man. Sit him some b2b games and play him sparingly on the PK.  Save 250+ minutes.
Habs,38imez,TheJustin72,-5,Fri Jun 5 04:33:24 2015 UTC,"So what did him playing an awesome 82 regular season games do for the team? Plecs and Markov are not the same age so that point is incorrect. As you see it, I would hate to see that the team looked like as you see it but don't let that stop you. Habs don't have a coach who realizes his min need to be reduced so again invalid point.  He did not play as an elite top pair dman in the playoffs which is what counts, I've already pointed this out to you.  You seem to have forgotten how the sport works. And yes a largely reduced role is what need to happen to a 37 year old dman. You don't seem to understand that as people age they slow down considerably, most athletes peak around age 30 he will turn 37 during next season. I like how you just ignore facts. Great logic"
Habs,38imez,BinaryChode,4,Thu Jun 4 19:13:55 2015 UTC,"What facts am I ignoring? Lol.  Like I said, Markov played like an elite d-man over 82 games of the regular season.  You're right about one thing, the playoffs are what counts.  So next year, they need to manage his minutes...but that doesn't mean he needs a ""largely reduced role"".  And the reason I brought up Plekanec is that he was just as bad, if not worse, than Markov was in the playoffs...so if the 12 game sample size of the playoffs is enough for you to realize Markov needs a significantly reduced role, clearly you must feel the same way about Plekanec right? Regardless of their age.  You're not very good at being condescending by the way, if you're going to do it you should at least be half competent at it."
Habs,38imez,TheJustin72,5,Thu Jun 4 20:44:20 2015 UTC,He had a great 82 game season and played poorly in 10-15 playoff games and now he's done? How do you know he wasn't playing hurt? I wouldn't give up on Markov yet he's one of our most dependable defenseman he just needs to be utilized better. I'd trade Emelin way before Marky.
Habs,38imez,nickdags,-5,Thu Jun 4 17:43:07 2015 UTC,"Who gives a blank about the regular season?????? You do realize the point of the entire thing is to win the playoffs/cup right? And no he was not dependable at all in the playoffs that's the problem, why are you ignoring that fact? He's 37 not 27 he's not going to magically get better. His mins an responsibilities need to be reduced and that doesn't fit with the amount of money he's being paid."
Habs,38imez,BinaryChode,5,Thu Jun 4 17:47:38 2015 UTC,Forget it. I can't stand arguing with irrational Habs fans that take a small sample size and characterize a player based on it. Your gonna base all of your assumptions on 12 games? 12 GAMES? Oh right the season is pointless now it's all about the playoffs...somebody tell this guy how exactly you get into the playoffs..
Habs,38imez,nickdags,-6,Thu Jun 4 17:58:56 2015 UTC,That SMALL SAMPLE SIZE IS WHAT MATTERS. You play to win the cup not to have a great regular season. Where the hell do you get your logic? Jesus where do these morons come from?
Habs,38imez,BinaryChode,4,Thu Jun 4 19:17:54 2015 UTC,"Yes I'm the moron. Your opinion really does seem like a popular one. In case your new to hockey and the NHL, the playoffs are dependent on your regular season hence why only 16 of 30 teams make it. If you don't have a great regular season your chances of winning the cup are slim to none. So Markov helps get you in the playoffs a number 2 seed no less and now that he had a bad run he is now thrown under the bus. Good job."
Habs,38imez,nickdags,-6,Thu Jun 4 19:34:09 2015 UTC,"Thank you for admitting it. It's much easier to make the playoffs than to stay in the playoffs, hence you need your important players who are relied upon to play well. This did not happen with the habs some did, some didn't Markov being one who didn't. ONLY 16 teams? That's more than half the league again your logic is astounding. So Markov gets paid over 5 million dollars a year to play awesome in the regular season and to help the team make the playoffs and get the 2nd seed. Once this is accomplished he doesn't have to play well anymore cause his job is done? Again flawless logic. Just to add further the reason people should be concerned is because he isn't 22 he's 37 which I've already explained but again I wouldn't expect someone like you to understand the ageing process of a human being. I'm glad you admitted you have a problem though. My god this is the worst fan base in the league by far."
Habs,38imez,BinaryChode,1 point,Thu Jun 4 19:43:37 2015 UTC,That's not really how sample sizes work.  12 games are 12 games and the valuable information you can get from them doesn't change on account when those 12 games happen.
Habs,38imez,slayeryouth,-1,Thu Jun 4 20:47:36 2015 UTC,Dman who puts up 50points and plays good defense deserves ice time.
Habs,38imez,Mcl94,1 point,Fri Jun 5 12:23:11 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure what your argument here is. I've stated several times I beleive Markov was a top 30 d-man in the NHL last year (probably closer to top 15 actually) and that it's about managing his minutes to keep him fresh when it matters, not using him as a 3rd pairing d-man or something like that."
Habs,38imez,TheJustin72,-3,Fri Jun 5 15:03:30 2015 UTC,I think had he had a reasonable  contract it would be unthinkable but he didnt do the team any favors with his deal especially considering he didnt play through a large portion of the last one. The habs have been more than fair to him. It would be a purely 8n the best interests of the team decision
Habs,38imez,bsaures,5,Thu Jun 4 15:15:27 2015 UTC,"Yep. I love Markov, but at 36 the best we can hope for is that he sustains his level of performance. While he is firmly on the downswing, I'm not against some veteran leadership on the back-end. Tom Gilbert is nowhere near Markov, but he is younger and if I recall correctly, still pretty dependable. Honestly it all depends on who you can actually move and what the best return would be.  I think Emelin would fetch a far greater return than both Markov and Gilbert, but the likelihood of that happening given the NTC may be slim."
Habs,38imez,Dubious_Dinobot,6,Thu Jun 4 14:47:05 2015 UTC,Markov is still able to play major minutes every game for a full season. A 37 years old Markov is still worth more than Gilbert or Emelin at any age. Markov is still a top 30 defenseman in the NHL.
Habs,38imez,Quattro5,1 point,Thu Jun 4 16:47:45 2015 UTC,Markov played the 11th most minutes in the entire NHL during the regular season.  He just needs less minutes and he'll be fine in the playoffs.  11th most is crazy.
Habs,38imez,Commandant1,-11,Fri Jun 5 01:05:58 2015 UTC,"No he isn't, did you watch the playoffs? I'm going to assume you didn't."
Habs,38imez,BinaryChode,14,Thu Jun 4 17:35:06 2015 UTC,I didn't only watch the playoffs.
Habs,38imez,Quattro5,-6,Thu Jun 4 17:35:59 2015 UTC,"Well Markov was complete shit in the playoffs, multiple goals where directly his fault, he simply could not compete, he was over used during the regular season and time has caught up with him."
Habs,38imez,BinaryChode,6,Thu Jun 4 17:38:55 2015 UTC,"He was definitely overplayed during the season which affected his playoff performance, but now that we have petry signed, he should be able to take some of those minutes away from Markov. He is still a 50 point scoring defenseman, and can still compete so I feel like we really shouldn't get rid of him."
Habs,38imez,HOOCH_IS_CRAZYY,6,Thu Jun 4 17:57:21 2015 UTC,"I'll even go so far as to say that if the PP issues get solved, the solution will go through Markov. Teams all know Subban will take the shot."
Habs,38imez,Quattro5,5,Thu Jun 4 18:12:04 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't move Markov.  I would move Gilbert, but it just doesn't save us enough money to get a top notch forward."
Habs,38imez,Commandant1,2,Thu Jun 4 15:04:13 2015 UTC,I'm betting you could get pretty good offense by trading Emelin. Probably a 20 goals scorer.
Habs,38imez,Quattro5,2,Thu Jun 4 16:51:10 2015 UTC,If true I'd do that trade every day of the week and twice on Sunday.
Habs,38imez,Commandant1,3,Thu Jun 4 17:02:25 2015 UTC,"We'll see.....a few teams are looking for a hard hitting D-Man. I might be wrong (it has been known to happen) but i think there would be a lot of interest for a guy like Emelin. He doesn't have bad hands, usually hits the net when he shoots (next to never) and is not that slow. He could be repurposed for sure."
Habs,38imez,Quattro5,1 point,Thu Jun 4 17:27:20 2015 UTC,"Fair and you bring up good points. The two bigger issues i was looking at are that he's overpaid, and that he's got a NTC which means even if traded he's gonna get to pick his team.  Both of those depress value."
Habs,38imez,Commandant1,0,Thu Jun 4 17:29:38 2015 UTC,To get a top notch forward a forward would be going as well so more cap space would be going as well so there would be more cap going back
Habs,38imez,bsaures,8,Thu Jun 4 15:34:04 2015 UTC,"He's not a defenseman, but my money is on Pleks leaving. There are rumours about him being traded away before the draft (likely to Colorado), and a contact I have (he was an nhl player agent) heard that Pleks was told to sell his house."

Habs,38imez,Gabroux,3,Thu Jun 4 19:36:11 2015 UTC,I just hope it's not a deal with COL
Habs,38imez,habsdane,2,Thu Jun 4 20:12:10 2015 UTC,Highly possible it's going to be him.

Habs,38imez,MTLBroncos,1 point,Thu Jun 4 23:24:47 2015 UTC,"1 year left on his contract.  Wants huge money.  Never been an elite centre, he's a very good 2nd liner, but not sure he's worth the 7mill plus per year he wants and if you don't give it to him you lose him as a UFA."
Habs,38imez,Commandant1,1 point,Fri Jun 5 00:20:58 2015 UTC,Ye^
Habs,38imez,habsdane,1 point,Fri Jun 5 00:45:07 2015 UTC,"Commandant1 how do you know that O'reilly wants 7 mil a year or more and if he doesn't get it he'll walk?  I mean if what your saying is true I would agree we shouldn't trade Plek because I think he is a better player.  However, O'reilly is also younger than Plek so if we could resign him he could be a solid no. 2 center with us for a long time.Plus, he already plays that kind of a defensive center role with the Avs. Plekanec is the better player I believe but Oreilly's stats are not bad and he would bring a physical presence that the team could use on the top 6."
Habs,38imez,habuheard,2,Fri Jun 5 03:32:15 2015 UTC,"I don't know what he wants, but I know he is already being paid $6 million per season, and I'm just using an educated guess to say that if he's getting $6 million now and hes gonna be a 25 year old unrestricted free agent, he'll probably be asking for a raise."
Habs,38imez,Commandant1,1 point,Fri Jun 5 04:00:56 2015 UTC,"Maybe some team will pay more than 6 mil for him as a UFA if that's what he wants which I'm still not sure.  But, yea 6 mil is a high price. I don’t think we should place the highest bid on him but Plekanec is a better player and he signed for 5 mil for 5 years.  Petry we just signed for 5.5.  Eberle who I would love to get is signed for 6 mil.  Unless he just wants to go to the team that will offer him the most money I would think we could sign him for a reasonable price closer to what he’s actually worth."
Habs,38imez,habuheard,1 point,Fri Jun 5 05:37:43 2015 UTC,"Both contracts he signed with Colorado after his ELC expired were tough negotiations.  In the first one he was a holdout who signed an RFA offersheet with Calgary and Colorado matched.    Both times messy things were said in the media.  He's always negotiated really hard and for the most money (which is his right, i don't begrudge him that)... I just think at 6 million now, unless you give him a raise, he's gonna go to July 1st and test the market."
Habs,38imez,Commandant1,5,Fri Jun 5 13:00:14 2015 UTC,"In a perfect situation, Emelin. I used to be a big believer and support of him, but over the past few years I really don't feel he fits in well in MTL. Would love to see the NTC waived and say bye bye to him"
Habs,38imez,ristiisa,2,Thu Jun 4 18:08:22 2015 UTC,Sekac fans.
Habs,38imez,chrislopez_,9,Thu Jun 4 15:38:37 2015 UTC,"I still think Sekac will be good but yeah, people need to let it go. Especially since DSP has a lot of potential still."
Habs,38imez,chrislopez_,8,Thu Jun 4 15:43:51 2015 UTC,yea haha for sure i liked him too when he playted here but everyone saying it was bergevins worst trade really annoyed me. even if it was his worst trade it says a lot about bergevin. it was a win win trade for both teams.
Habs,38imez,schmuck55,5,Thu Jun 4 17:01:17 2015 UTC,It was definitely not his worst trade. Sekac has proven absolutely nothing over DSP at this point. Sekac was a free signing we turned into a different prospect. That's it.
Habs,38imez,chrislopez_,0,Thu Jun 4 18:14:46 2015 UTC,"It's less about the player, and more about what the trade represents. MB deviated from what seemed to be his MO of building the team on skill, by trading away a skill guy for a more ""Therrien-type"" player. You don't want to see a GM get away from his gameplan and try to cater to a coach, it smells panicky.   I certainly hope DSP works out (and I think he can really improve with a summer of Habs conditioning), but I'll still dislike what the trade represents."
Habs,38imez,prplx,5,Thu Jun 4 17:27:16 2015 UTC,"It wasn't that at all though. that's just your perception. Marc Bergevin said, and I'll verbatim quote, that he wanted to acquire Devante Smith-Pelly and that the price for acquiring him was Jiri Sekac. If he could have given up someone else like Bournival or Thomas he would have. Anaheim wanted Sekac. Chiarrelli while still with Boston soon after complained about the trade because he wish he had known Smith-Pelly was available. He had to instead give up two second round picks to Tampa for Brett Connolly.   It had nothing to do with ""Therrien-type"" and everything to do with the cost to get DSP."
Habs,38imez,prplx,1 point,Thu Jun 4 18:16:58 2015 UTC,Awesome thank you for that.
Habs,38imez,Commandant1,5,Fri Jun 5 05:53:01 2015 UTC,"I think he traded a player he thought he had many other in the same mould, for a type of player he didn't have on his team or in Hamilton, or certainly not many.  Also, let's not forget DSP costs next to nothing on the cap, is still very young, still has a year on his contract then will be RFA.  He is the prototype of a 3rd or 4th liner in today's NHL.  Bring some physicality and costs little $$.  he needs to work on his speed though."
Habs,38imez,prplx,1 point,Thu Jun 4 17:41:34 2015 UTC,No one. Subban/Markove Petry/Emelin Gilbert/beaulieu Pateryn as a back up. That's a pretty solid defensive core.  If anyone gets traded it's gonna be Tinordi.
Habs,38imez,Commandant1,5,Thu Jun 4 14:45:52 2015 UTC,And you go with the same forward group we have now?  You don't think we need to move out one contract to clear some cap space for an addition to the forwards?
Habs,38imez,televisionceo,2,Thu Jun 4 15:03:29 2015 UTC,"I was looking only at the defence. I don,t really see who we can move forward.  I know people talk about DD and Parenteau, but who would take them?  Plek maybe.  One that we could easily replace ir Prust.  I don't think he brings as much he costs anymore.  As for Emelin, I don't see him being traded.  people want him out because of his corsi, but he brings a physical presence behind that does't show up in advance stats, but is sorely needed on this team.  Even with him we are not physical enough on the defence.  If he is gone, we will definitely be ver ""soff""."
Habs,38imez,LegendaryWolfee,2,Thu Jun 4 17:36:10 2015 UTC,"I don't think Petry, Pateryn, Subban, Beaulieu, Tinordi are soff.  I think that group is plenty physical.  Physicality is all about seperating your man from the puck, and those guys do it.  If all Emelin is bringing is that one or two big hits a game, I can live without it.  The Hawks don't have a big hitter on the backend, they have guys who seperate the other team from the puck, and they are about to win their 3rd cup."
Habs,38imez,Hail_Aqualung,-2,Thu Jun 4 18:27:08 2015 UTC,"I think Sherbak, Hudon or Mccarron can do a decent job for us"
Habs,38imez,Commandant1,6,Thu Jun 4 15:39:21 2015 UTC,"Sherbak hasn't even played a day in AHL, don't just assume he will be our next star. Same with mccaron, even now he doesn't have a offensive flair. Hudon is our only chance, and MT will throw him on the third or fourth line."
Habs,38imez,Hail_Aqualung,4,Thu Jun 4 15:43:19 2015 UTC,McCarron doesn't have any offensive flair? Did you pay any attention to this OHL season and Memorial Cup Championship?
Habs,38imez,Commandant1,2,Thu Jun 4 15:58:23 2015 UTC,"0.87 PPG after being traded to Oshawa... just over 1.2 PPG for the full season and playoffs.  Those are good but not great numbers, and do not indicate he's going to be a superstar at the NHL level.  For example, Kyle Chipchura, Ryan White, Max Lapierre had similar numbers in their final year of junior."
Habs,38imez,poytri,2,Thu Jun 4 16:42:20 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't look at his decline in production post-trade as anything of huge significance. He was traded to a stacked team set on contending for the Memorial Cup (we all knew they were contending, even back then). His role and the system were slightly different.  He also made a jump and learned to play center. All good things!"
Habs,38imez,Commandant1,1 point,Thu Jun 4 17:21:25 2015 UTC,"I'm more looking at it as ... he no longer was playing with Max Domi and/or Mitch Marner... two of the absolute best offensive players in the OHL.  I truly believe that Domi and Marner inflated his stats in London.  You can see this as Christian Dvorak's stats also went through the roof immediately after McCarron was traded.    His stats in Oshawa aren't a bad thing, they just are closer to a true indication of his talent level then stats he had when he centred Domi for most of the time in London, then Marner took Domi's place when Domi was at the WJC... and both were on the ice with McC on powerplay."
Habs,38imez,prplx,2,Thu Jun 4 17:27:24 2015 UTC,"Getzlaf also had similar numbers in his final year.   I'm not saying McCarron will turn into Getzlaf, but I think he'll adjust to the pro level better than Chipchura, White and Lapierre."
Habs,38imez,Commandant1,0,Thu Jun 4 21:18:42 2015 UTC,"Getzlaf also had 75 points in 49 games as an 18 year old, where McC had a horrible season.  If McCarron becomes a top 6 foward, his 18 year old season would be the worst PPG of any 18 year-old playing CHL hockey who is a top 6 currently in the NHL.  The absolute worst.  He had a really nice bounce back this year, and that shouldn't be taken lightly, but counting on him to be a top line player next year, with no time in the AHL, and after what amounts to one good scoring season in the CHL is asking too much IMO.  (He wasn't a scorer at the US NTDP at 16 or 17 either).  This isn't to say McCarron's development is done and he'll never get there.  Its to say that expecting him to go from 36 points in the OHL to a good but not spectacular OHL season to the NHL top line on a contender, in this short a time span is just too much."
Habs,38imez,chrislopez_,2,Thu Jun 4 21:42:35 2015 UTC,"If McCarron becomes a top 6 foward, his 18 year old season would be the worst PPG of any 18 year-old playing CHL hockey who is a top 6 currently in the NHL. The absolute worst.   You looked at every single 18 years old who ever played in the CHL???  Care to show us your source?"
Habs,38imez,Commandant1,1 point,Fri Jun 5 01:38:13 2015 UTC,"hockeydb.com  Yes I looked at top 6 forwards in the NHL today (using the cutoff to be a legit top 6 you must have 1 season of 20g or 45 points).... PPG McCarron's is the worst for post draft year.  Here is an interesting fact... (note 30g or 60p was my cut off for first line, not second, i went at least one season of 20g or 45 points to be a legit second liner)... Since the 1998 draft. For every forward who played CHL hockey post their first draft and scored 30 goals in a season, or 60 points in a season... only 3 come in at less than 1.2 PPG in their post draft year.  They are Jeff Carter (1.16 PPG), Milan Lucic (0.97 PPG) and James Neal (0.88 PPG)  Things go a little lower when you lower the target to 20 g or 45 points, but nothing comes as low as .515 PPG which is McCarron's total.  Now given the season he had and the improvement he's showed, maybe one day he can be a top 6 in the NHL... but putting him in there with no AHL time and expecting him to make a difference to our offence is foolhardy IMO.  He's a guy we need to be patient with."
Habs,38imez,BinaryChode,1 point,Fri Jun 5 02:09:31 2015 UTC,He won't be a superstar. Milan lucic at that size was an exception for a few years. He's gonna be a solid 3rd liner who could contribute on the second line once in a while because of his size.

Habs,38imez,Commandant1,2,Thu Jun 4 15:44:22 2015 UTC,That's a strange assumption.  What do you see as our top line in that scenario?
Habs,38imez,prplx,2,Thu Jun 4 16:08:55 2015 UTC,"Two of those guys are juniors with no AHL experience.  The third has one year of AHL experience.  Only Scherbak has really high end offensive potential, but he needs work on his defensive game.  Hudon and McCarron are not likely to be first line players... second line maybe.  We really need a top line #1 RW and game breaker.  I'd rather not rush any of them into a #1 role."
Habs,38imez,prplx,1 point,Thu Jun 4 16:36:14 2015 UTC,I don't think we need anything else.  Mtl is building their team differently.  They want to have three lines that can score
Habs,38imez,destroyermaker,3,Thu Jun 4 16:51:59 2015 UTC,"If this season proved anything, its that we still don't have the horses to score enough goals.  Adding one more goal scorer would make a world of difference and really improve them."
Habs,38imez,prplx,2,Thu Jun 4 17:00:36 2015 UTC,"The purpose of a move would be to open up cap space.  We need to sign Chucky and I think Beaulieu.  I'd be willing to give up Emelin or Gilbert for that purpose, because we have Pateryn and Tinordi waiting in the wings."
Habs,38imez,Grand_Chief_Mathieu,3,Thu Jun 4 15:17:11 2015 UTC,"In tha case it should be Gilbert, not Emelin.  Emelin brings something the other D don,t, except maybe Subban.  Gilbert brings nothing we don,t already have.  Specially now with Petry locked long term."
Habs,38imez,Muter91,5,Thu Jun 4 17:37:41 2015 UTC,"If versatility is your goal, I agree.    There's an argument to be made for consistency."
Habs,38imez,MessageBoard,1 point,Thu Jun 4 17:43:57 2015 UTC,"I really think Gilbert and Petry are very very similar: about the same height and weigh, right handed, some offensive flair, good first pass, not very physical.  But Petry is clearly a stp above Gilbert in term of talent.  Emelin is a lefty, and much more physical.  Players think twice about entering on his side along the board.  I said it before, but if Emelin played for any other team, people would say he is exactly the type of player missing in the Montreal roster."
Habs,38imez,Grand_Chief_Mathieu,5,Thu Jun 4 18:06:09 2015 UTC,"See, when I watch Emelin play, I see him get beat to the outside about three times as often as he lands a hit."
Habs,38jzu1,IBoris,4,Thu Jun 4 18:52:45 2015 UTC,"Summary:  He's on his last year.   He's 4 mil./year.   He has a more substantial track records.  His woes with the habs stem from injuries and not meshing with ""ze system"" rather than weak play.  Teams might be tempted to take a chance on him and hope he stays healthy and produces.  Clearing him would be sufficient to keep Emy and Gilberts while signing everyone else.  His spot can easily be taken by one of the kids at reduced cost with likely a superior output if they are healthy.    Frankly I think this would be the best solution. Having Emy and Gilberts as our third pairing is insane. If they don't perform, we can use them as bait next year during trade season for desperate teams or have them as back-up for any Dman that might get injured throughout the season.  Our prospects are mostly wingers and replacing PAP would give them a golden and sustained opportunity while providing them low pressure to perform (PAP's production will be easy to match)."
Habs,38jzu1,CarelessPotato,3,Thu Jun 4 18:56:49 2015 UTC,"Hard to say it was just PAP not meshing, as his numbers with Colorado weren't very good either. His output with the NYI was a result of getting heavy offensive minutes with Tavares on the top line and PP at a time when he was in his prime."
Habs,38jzu1,Kartias,3,Thu Jun 4 21:59:47 2015 UTC,"His first season numbers with Colorado are actually pretty impressive in the shortened season. 43 points in 48 games is more ppg than his year with Tavares. His second year was only 0.6 ppg, but that is still decent second line numbers.  This year was pretty bad, perhaps also doesn't help he only had an 8.2 shot%? I think he will do pretty decently and get back to the 0.5 ppg, which is fine."
Habs,38jzu1,HanshinFan,3,Fri Jun 5 13:57:08 2015 UTC,"I think it's definitely possible that we move him, but I gotta be honest with you - I like PAP. He had decent possession numbers in Colorado and on the Island, and he's naturally a scoring winger on a team that's desperate for scoring wingers. I think if we hang on to him, he might open some eyes next year."
Habs,38jzu1,aaronwrotkowski,-1,Thu Jun 4 21:31:18 2015 UTC,Just buy him out.
Habs,38j5vi,fatneszsebby,18,Thu Jun 4 15:54:12 2015 UTC,"He's been an ok backup.  Frankly, with Price we don't need a really good backup.    My only concern is that he won't play enough to develop his potential.  He might be better off elsewhere simply because he might see more ice-time."

Habs,38j5vi,MTLBroncos,2,Thu Jun 4 16:49:42 2015 UTC,I never considered this. Good call. We need to not resign Tokarski when his contract is up though.
Habs,38j5vi,tbz709,3,Thu Jun 4 16:50:43 2015 UTC,"This. Take it from someone who lives in St John's and got to see him play live. He just didn't try. You could see him wave at pucks he just needed to slide for and hardly chased the puck around the net. He was clearly upset and was trying to make the Jets move him   On the bright side, we get the baby habs moving in this year!  :)"
Habs,38j5vi,Tralfamadorian-,2,Thu Jun 4 22:02:09 2015 UTC,"There was a decision that was very telling when they chose Tokarski instead of Budaj. The deciders knew that Budaj couldn't deliver 2 games, where Tokarski had the potential to miracle. After that, why bother keeping Budaj for the stability of maybe 2 more wins in the regular season."
Habs,38j5vi,burnSMACKER,2,Thu Jun 4 17:00:37 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, that will most likely be the case for all our back ups, unless we find one that is good enough to replace Price for the lower seeded teams to give him more breaks (if he even wants any)"

The League is getting tougher for smaller goalies, and Condon at 6'2'' is more in line with the current average size of goalie.  Training camp will be interesting, and I could see Tokarski getting the Budaj treatment if Condon excells."
Habs,38j5vi,schmuck55,4,Thu Jun 4 16:43:47 2015 UTC,"His contract isn't up this summer, he has a year left. He definitely struggled near the end of the season but he played some great games earlier in the year. I think he had trouble getting used to playing so few games after being a starter the season before - it's an acquired skill to keep your conditioning and focus when you're not playing a lot, and I think it's something he can learn and be better at next year."
Habs,38j5vi,quadriplegic_cheetah,2,Thu Jun 4 17:21:44 2015 UTC,"He's cheap, we really just need a cheap backup goalie. Because Price is going to be playing 70 games a year."
Habs,38j5vi,ristiisa,1 point,Thu Jun 4 17:30:47 2015 UTC,"Backups are always needed, even if the best goalie in the league is playing almost every night.

Habs,38j5vi,Fabien_Lamour,1 point,Thu Jun 4 18:10:35 2015 UTC,Keep him for cheap if he's good with staying backup forever. If he's hungry let him walk. We don't need him. Any cheap backup will do.
Habs,38j5vi,scelement,1 point,Thu Jun 4 18:10:54 2015 UTC,"Tokarski will always be a backup goalie, he simply doesn't have the size to fill up the net. Tokes has flahes of brilliance and other times looks like a total wreck out there, the inconsistency comes from a lack of game play but I don't feel he'll ever get that #1 on any team. The best goaltenders that are being drafted these days are all 6'2+ 200+."
Habs,38j5vi,Lolsteringu,1 point,Fri Jun 5 01:17:51 2015 UTC,"I say trade him, I dont like having a young goalie as backup when they only play 10-15 games, Not good for their development. We need an older goalie who can play limited time and snag us some wins. I wish we would have traded Tokarski instead of Budaj. Probably could have gotten more for Tokarski and Budaj fit the backup role for us better.  Some good UFA's for backup could be Budaj,Fasth,Gustavsson,Emery,Greiss,Ellis,"

They have a few Russian players on the team so if Emelin were to waive his NTC to go anywhere, I assume it would be to a team with other Russian players."
Habs,38k2xd,Kuciv,5,Thu Jun 4 19:56:07 2015 UTC,Anaheim's pick? That's like 57th overall? Basically a 3rd. With no other pieces I'd pass on that one. Maybe add a third or two fifths or something.

Assuming he waives the NTC, what do we think about Markov and Pateryn for Rychel and Anaheim's 2nd (57th overall)?  You get a promising, NHL-ready LW who is projecting to be in the top-6. Columbus gets some NHL-ready defense who can definitely play a top-4 role, and a promising prospect for when Markov ages out.  The right side is Subban/Petry/Gilbert, left side is Beaulieu/Tinordi/Emelin.  Left side looks terrible if Beaulieu or Tinordi can't handle the increased minutes, but I don't think Emelin or Gilbert (instead of Markov or Pateryn) have enough value to get this trade done -- you can't just realistically make trades including Emelin that also bring lots of value back to Montreal, and Montreal desperately needs some scoring help."

Habs,38k2xd,CarelessPotato,1 point,Thu Jun 4 19:52:35 2015 UTC,That isn't realistic man. Although you're the guy who thinks Emelin is just as good as Markov so I guess it's possible it seems realistic to you.
Habs,38jn0g,Mikash33,8,Thu Jun 4 17:41:09 2015 UTC,"Malkin for Pleks AND DD, plus some odds and ends   If by ""odds and ends"" you mean at minimum a first-rounder and a top prospect, then maybe this has a chance of happening."
Habs,38jn0g,HanshinFan,-8,Thu Jun 4 18:04:06 2015 UTC,"1st round pick, Emelin, and other. So yes."
Habs,38jn0g,HanshinFan,6,Thu Jun 4 18:07:26 2015 UTC,"There's no way you get a player like Malkin for Plek, DD, Emelin, and a 1st without taking back an albatross contract the other way. Emelin has a NTC and is way overpaid - if I'm Pittsburgh I'm asking Montreal to not include him in the deal, and that's even assuming Emelin agrees to waive.  Acquiring Evgeni Malkin would require something like Plek, a 1st, a 2nd, and Beaulieu at minimum."
Habs,38jn0g,quadriplegic_cheetah,3,Thu Jun 4 18:15:59 2015 UTC,"Two firsts, a prospect that will be very good and a contract written in blood from Plek that he will stay with Pitt next year. And that's just a starting point."
Habs,38jn0g,HanshinFan,0,Thu Jun 4 18:25:43 2015 UTC,"I love that we got so completely off the track of my original question that you're picking apart the possibility of a trade we have no idea is even possible or requested by any party.  The question was, which is more important, a 1st line Centerman or a scoring Winger?"
Habs,38jn0g,athiestweed420,3,Thu Jun 4 18:29:32 2015 UTC,A scoring winger.
Habs,38jn0g,Roughly6Owls,2,Thu Jun 4 18:33:59 2015 UTC,lol
Habs,38jn0g,athiestweed420,1 point,Thu Jun 4 20:24:09 2015 UTC,"Pittsburgh's pretty tight on cap space -- I don't think they could even afford Emelin/Pleks/DD: that's 12.6AAV against the cap (Malkin's 9.5, by the way), considering they've got to re-sign their entire bottom six forwards and half of their defensemen."
Habs,38jn0g,athiestweed420,6,Fri Jun 5 17:33:05 2015 UTC,"The habs have a #1 center, but he's being used as a left winger"
Habs,38jn0g,Gabroux,2,Thu Jun 4 20:26:22 2015 UTC,"So, do we think he is ready? MT seems to think not, but he has not had a hard look yet. If the Plek really wants out, do we throw him on the 1st line at Center and hope for the best? I honestly think we have another top tier guy for that slot but he gets 3rd line minutes instead."
Habs,38jn0g,BuddhasLittleWarlock,3,Thu Jun 4 21:58:18 2015 UTC,"Chucky looked pretty good with pacciotetty during his short stint at center. I don't think he should immediately become the number 1 guy, but he still needs to get reps at center."
Habs,38jn0g,Roughly6Owls,1 point,Thu Jun 4 22:06:15 2015 UTC,Yea give him some time there
Habs,38jn0g,fatneszsebby,2,Thu Jun 4 23:18:56 2015 UTC,"If the Habs are ready to place Chucky 1st center, then we need a winger. If the team does not think can do the job, then we need a center"
Habs,38jn0g,fatneszsebby,2,Thu Jun 4 19:46:29 2015 UTC,A number one Center might be Galchenyuk. I'd say that we work towards a top-line player (a guy like Stamkos or Giroux) who could play wing or Center equally well.
Habs,38jn0g,BuddhasLittleWarlock,1 point,Sat Jun 6 04:05:11 2015 UTC,"I think Montreal needs a bonafide #1 Center. The Stanley cup winners in the last five years have names like Kopitar, Toews, and Bergeron as the biggest stars on the roster, and they're all known as some of the best centres in the league."
Habs,38jn0g,areid1379,3,Fri Jun 5 17:36:08 2015 UTC,"That's why I thought this was a tougher choice than people make it out to be. Getting someone like a Patrick Sharp or a Jeff Carter would be great (random examples of good scoring wingers, no rumors), but I feel like unless one of the guys on our roster matures next year into the next Toews or Crosby, it will be tough to take home a cup without shopping for a #1 Center.  Pleks is by far the best 2nd line center in the league. If he had someone ahead of him on the depth chart that wasn't DD, we would be a better team for it.  I doubt people will agree, but I think we need to just let Chucky and Eller take on that Center role, especially Eller. He's had a revolving door of wingers for too long, and we still don't know what this kid can do."
Habs,38jn0g,eriverside,1 point,Fri Jun 5 17:46:57 2015 UTC,"1 Winger. Galchenyuk can be a 1st centre. 20+ plus goals, imagine that with a good PP and a two 67's."

Habs,38gaqw,MTLBroncos,8,Thu Jun 4 04:17:34 2015 UTC,"Being a wings fan, frankly, it doesn't matter to me who wins. It's going to be shit either way.  I also think that ""oh we almost beat the cup winner this year, makes us look better."" Is complete donkey toss."

Habs,38gaqw,subwayprophecy,5,Thu Jun 4 02:04:55 2015 UTC,It still hurts knowing we should've won the series. We lost to ourselves.

Habs,38gaqw,zeMVK,3,Thu Jun 4 08:31:59 2015 UTC,"Canadiens first, of course, but after that, it depends on history, geography and proximity to wherever I'm living. Original Six team, Blackhawks. Chicago north of Tampa. Also, I live here, so go Hawks. Easy choice."
Habs,38gaqw,the_trout,2,Thu Jun 4 03:11:43 2015 UTC,"I'm at a loss for this series. On one hand, fuck Tampa. On the other hand, every vocal, ignorant, annoying hockey fan I have ever personally met has been a Hawks fan, so fuck Chicago.  But, I said during the previous round that whoever won the West would most likely win the Cup, so I guess my money is on the Hawks. But I could honestly not care less who won, which is a pretty terrible feeling to have as a hockey fan."
Habs,38gaqw,fifthpilgrim,2,Thu Jun 4 04:23:01 2015 UTC,"Hockey doesn't work like that though. just because Tampa beat rangers, it doesn't mean habs would have, if they beat tampa, so, it doesn't matter to me.  i think I would go for hawks. they are a strong team, and have been for a while, and toews is a great captain, and I think deserves good things."
Habs,38gaqw,Akoustyk,2,Thu Jun 4 06:08:44 2015 UTC,"I was with them until they tried to clog the neutral zone for two periods with a 1-goal lead. That is my eternal pet peeve and I can't cheer for anyone who does it (it is my #1 complaint about MT as well... I miss fast-paced offensive hockey.)  So I was immediately cheering for the Hawks and man was I happy to see them chip away at the Lightning's defense and score a couple late.  So now I am for the Hawks, because I feel like in their system they would seek to extend a lead, not defend it."

Habs,38hwza,jshare,3,Thu Jun 4 09:30:31 2015 UTC,"Yes! First Dumont, now Bournival. We've got a stranglehold on the useless québécois player market."
Habs,38hwza,PuckingEh,2,Thu Jun 4 15:40:15 2015 UTC,"I hear you. I'm not so hot on Dumont, but he's got a good ethic and he'll be a good depth player somewhere a la Chipchura.  I do like Bourni though. Great speed and forechecking. I just want him to spend the whole summer improving his shot. His first goal, that one-timer against the Caps, was sweet, but he's had good chances that he couldn't finish because his shots were just AHL-level"
Habs,38hwza,MessageBoard,2,Thu Jun 4 17:48:38 2015 UTC,"Bournival is one of those guys who you see in practice and think will be a great player in the league. Then you actually watch him play and see he really doesn't excel at anything. He's a great skater who works hard, and that's about it. Doesn't do a whole lot offensively or defensively."
Habs,38hwza,PuckingEh,2,Thu Jun 4 18:12:40 2015 UTC,He's the Tom Pyatt of French Canada.
Habs,38hwza,athiestweed420,2,Thu Jun 4 18:14:26 2015 UTC,If bournival had any finish at all he'd be capable of being a serviceable third or fourth line center
Habs,38hwza,fatneszsebby,1 point,Thu Jun 4 20:28:24 2015 UTC,Borny is a good 3rd or 4th liner. We need him out there. Not so well defencively but great offensively.
Habs,38i1zc,jshare,3,Thu Jun 4 10:30:24 2015 UTC,"TL;DR   Petry's advanced stats are excellent, he will be a staple on the blueline for years to come, and now that he's signed, with such minimal cap left, there will need to be some movement on the blueline to accommodate it. The two likely candidates are Emelin and Gilbert (no surprises here). Emelin and Gilbert's jobs can be performed by Beaulieu/Tinordi, and Gilbert is already halfway out the door, so he can be replaced by Pateryn.   Sorry for the minimal translation, most of the article is fluff anyway; this is the important stuff :P If I'm going along with what the author is saying though, I think that it should be Beau-Pats, and Tinner as the 7th. I love Tinner, but he isn't where we need him to be yet. He will become our Chara eventually (I hope), but for now, he's not quite there."
Habs,38i1zc,JMPesce,3,Thu Jun 4 11:50:07 2015 UTC,"Only problem I have with your suggestion is to paraphrase what Marc-Antoine Godin asked Therrien: ""how is he supposed to adjust to NHL speed if he isn't playing?""  (I think that was about Tinner but it might have been about Beau at the time.)"
Habs,38i1zc,JMPesce,2,Thu Jun 4 12:06:45 2015 UTC,"Yes, you're absolutely right. Like I said, if it was me, I would play him as the 7th. I'd alternate him in every few games (every 3 games, let him play 2-3 games sort of thing) to give him some real exposure. Let him make mistakes, let him adjust his play, let him learn what happens if you put yourself out of position. He needs to adjust by making mistakes and then fixing them. Basically, what we did with Beau and Pats."
Habs,38d8mz,hkycoach,6,Wed Jun 3 13:43:52 2015 UTC,"Just curious about something. If Petry says he likes the system MT plays and that he thinks we are going to be a cup contender do you agree with him? I mean he's experienced these things first hand after all, and he's played the sport enough to know.  Also this is great to hear, I'm sure he was considering being a wing, so to have him stay is awesome."
Habs,38d8mz,quadriplegic_cheetah,2,Wed Jun 3 17:01:46 2015 UTC,"I agree and I disagree.  I agree that we're probably a step or two away from contending.  We've got an All Star goalie, we have some great puck-moving D (particularly with the addition of Petry himself), and we have some decent forwards.  However, he may be seeing things from an angle of ""Damn these guys have their poop in a pile compared to Edmonton.""  Which really isn't saying much.  Regarding the ""going to be a contender"" and liking MT's system.  As with a lot of people, I'm not convinced that our current personnel can pull it off.  We lack a high power duo to carry the first line.  Patches needs someone else on the first line to carry the team.  DD just doesn't hack it as a pair with him.  They're decent together - possibly the best C/W pairing on the team, but they aren't going to make us a contender.  With that said, I don't think there is a viable alternative to DD as the #1 C.  Pleks is a solid #2, Chucky is decent, but as we know, hasn't made the leap and, ""feels more comfortable"" on the wing, and Eller isn't a 1st liner (and probably never will be).  So we're stuck with a vacuum at 1C, which is currently filled with DD.  Every other line I think could contend with the 2/3/4 lines of any given year, but Patches/DD just can't bring enough offensive firepower game-in-game-out.  That's all separate from MT's system.  Which a lot of people don't like.  MT could change it up to something less risk-averse, but in the end it would only mask the problem with our 1st line pairing.  We'd get more offensive opportunities, while giving up more/better scoring opportunities against."
Habs,38d8mz,quadriplegic_cheetah,5,Wed Jun 3 18:18:46 2015 UTC,"I think we are one star forward away from competing for a cup. If we grab one 60-70 point scorer, this team will be deep enough at each position to really make a push. We just need one player so we can put that ""line"" together that makes the opposing coach say, watch out for these two. Instead of worry about Price and Subban, they could be worrying about Pacioretty and (insert name)."
Habs,38d8mz,CarelessPotato,3,Wed Jun 3 19:10:28 2015 UTC,"Agree 100%.  I like the lines: Patches/[Insert Player Here]/Gally  Chucky/Pleks/PAP  DLR/Eller/DSP  Prust/Mitchell/Weise  As much as I like some of Weise's clutch performances, he's as much a 2nd liner as I am.  But as MB said, finding a top-line center would be difficult."
Habs,38d8mz,quadriplegic_cheetah,2,Wed Jun 3 19:43:31 2015 UTC,"Well Weise produced as a 2nd line guy, though one of the lower ones. PAP is the one who is barely a second liner, and produced like a 3rd liner despite getting mostly top 6 time"
Habs,38d8mz,blackleaf2,1 point,Wed Jun 3 22:41:41 2015 UTC,"I was thinking more so  Pacioretty - Insert player - Gallagher Galchenyuk - Plekanec - Eller Parenteau - Desharnais - Smith- Pelly Prost/DLR - Mitchel -Wiese  Although I'm one of the few people who really want Eller moved to the wing as a power forward.   Also the PAP, DD, DSP line was pretty effective in the final stretch of the regular season."
Habs,38d8mz,HanshinFan,0,Thu Jun 4 06:10:47 2015 UTC,"while giving up more/better scoring opportunities against.   We're already in the bottom of the league for giving up scoring opportunities against.   Therrien's system is not effective defensively.  Probably more because of how we clear the puck than the criticisms against his zone entries.    I'd be willing to forgive the dump-and-chase if we didn't spend so much time in our own end, spitting the puck out to neutral zone."
Habs,38d8mz,blackleaf2,2,Wed Jun 3 19:28:42 2015 UTC,"True, I always trick myself into believing the story of being 'defense first'.  But then I always come back to this chart: http://war-on-ice.com/hexteams.html?team=MTL  And realize that we suck at protecting the slot."

Habs,38d8mz,destroyermaker,6,Wed Jun 3 17:09:53 2015 UTC,"This is great and all, but honestly I'd say it's more of an indictment of the way things were done in Edmonton."
Habs,38d8mz,blackleaf2,8,Wed Jun 3 16:00:05 2015 UTC,"Agreed.   It gave me warm fuzzies about MTL, but really thought - damn, EDM must be like East Berlin or something, because he actually likes MT's system."
Habs,38d8mz,Almostneverclever,5,Wed Jun 3 16:34:28 2015 UTC,I've heard a few players on the Habs say they like MT philosophy and systems. More than once actually.
Habs,38d8mz,BlackwaterProject,6,Wed Jun 3 17:09:24 2015 UTC,"It's interesting to note that Crosby has made quite a few positive comments about MT in the past and, IIRC, even went out of his way to call and congratulate him when he got hired in Montreal."
Habs,38d8mz,Mustafarr,4,Wed Jun 3 20:48:25 2015 UTC,"I think it really works for some players and really doesn't for others. So, just a matter of finding the right guys to make things run smoothly. Having Petry is a big boon in this regard."
Habs,38d8mz,Noshellz,2,Wed Jun 3 17:57:23 2015 UTC,"Players may like the system, from a fan's stand point it's pretty frustrating to watch our forwards run into each other on the blue line constantly.  I think that players are looking for two things:   1) Good Direction  2) Wins  MT's system is simple enough that they get #1, and obviously they can get #2 with Price backing them up."
Habs,38a7dg,Razorback101,27,Tue Jun 2 22:01:37 2015 UTC,First good news I've heard since the playoffs ended. Glad we managed to lock him down for a while. Now about that top six RW...
Habs,38a7dg,velocipotamus,16,Tue Jun 2 22:07:08 2015 UTC,and this deal is fucking amazing. I personally think it's a real steal. Some people in /r/hockey don't seem to understand how good he was with us. It's not too farfetched to argue he has been as good as subban in the playoffs. and he is costing us 3.5 M less per season.
Habs,38a7dg,televisionceo,25,Tue Jun 2 22:24:40 2015 UTC,Especially when you consider this was pretty much Bergevin's strategy in getting him from the Oilers
Habs,38a7dg,velocipotamus,3,Tue Jun 2 22:33:24 2015 UTC,"haha this is hilarious, but I don't evem get it"
Habs,38a7dg,Gaglardi,8,Wed Jun 3 00:53:34 2015 UTC,"This is a scene from the beginning of Raiders of the Lost Ark where Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) is trying to steal that golden idol which is on a weighted platform that sets off booby traps if the idol is removed, so to steal it he fills a bag of sand to its approximate weight and quickly swaps it for the idol (although the booby traps still end up going off)  The joke is that Bergevin is Indy, Petry is the golden idol, and a bag of sand is essentially what we gave Edmonton for him"
Habs,38a7dg,velocipotamus,3,Wed Jun 3 01:02:55 2015 UTC,"ahahahaha, thank you!"

Habs,38a7dg,televisionceo,5,Tue Jun 2 23:05:54 2015 UTC,"honestly, I would have been among them if I was not a habs fan. he is not well known in the league"
Habs,38a7dg,Tomy2TugsFapMaster69,5,Tue Jun 2 23:18:49 2015 UTC,"Yea its a fair argument, Most people just remember his time as an Oiler and that was not the best sample they could have gotten."
Habs,38a7dg,Gump_Worsley,5,Tue Jun 2 23:19:43 2015 UTC,"It was the largest sample though.  If he plays well next season I say possibly worth, but thats a lot of money put into the D when habs need scoring upfront so badly."
Habs,38a7dg,titanstats,4,Wed Jun 3 02:44:07 2015 UTC,"I've watched him since he was drafted and I do think he is worth that price and term. He is excellent with his stick and is a legit top 4 D-man. He is also going to get better, he really started coming into his own on Montreal, and you will see more of his excellent play over the years getting better."

Habs,38a7dg,Iknowwhereyoualllive,14,Tue Jun 2 22:35:54 2015 UTC,Having him locked up from 27-33 years old is absolutely perfect! Hopefully those prime years help bring us a Cup!
Habs,38a7dg,HanshinFan,11,Tue Jun 2 22:26:22 2015 UTC,"Other defenceman with a $5.5M AAV (like Petry's extension): Brooks Orpik, Dan Girardi, Matt Carle. According to https://twitter.com/reporterchris  Girardi is 31, Orpik is turning 35, Carle is turning 31 and Petry is turning 28. So I feel like Petry can be better then all those guys by the time he hits 31 if not sooner or maybe thats just me."
Habs,38a7dg,Gabroux,5,Tue Jun 2 22:36:37 2015 UTC,I think Petry is better than all 3 right now (maybe not Girardi).
Habs,38a7dg,Mean_Mister_Mustard,5,Wed Jun 3 01:18:29 2015 UTC,Id take Petry over Orpik and Carle for sure.
Habs,38a7dg,Gabroux,8,Wed Jun 3 01:29:42 2015 UTC,5.5 avg according to LeBrun!
Habs,38a7dg,Soutael,6,Tue Jun 2 22:10:00 2015 UTC,"Going to be tight capwise, but I'm alright with it."
Habs,38a7dg,HanshinFan,9,Tue Jun 2 22:10:55 2015 UTC,He's getting what we were paying for Gonchar to warm the bench
Habs,38a7dg,LeMAD,13,Tue Jun 2 22:28:47 2015 UTC,"In fairness, we were mostly paying Gonchar to not be Travis Moen."
Habs,38a7dg,BinaryChode,3,Wed Jun 3 02:38:19 2015 UTC,"Indeed, saved money for this summer for a Petry type of deal"
Habs,38a7dg,bcg_music,1 point,Wed Jun 3 04:43:40 2015 UTC,I feel Gonchar also did a world of good for Beaulieu in terms of a mentor

Habs,38a7dg,destroyermaker,6,Tue Jun 2 22:30:52 2015 UTC,"I think he could have gotten more somewhere else, Curious to see what Green goes for now but I have a feeling we may make a trade to free up cap still need to sign Chucky and NB"
Habs,38a7dg,quadriplegic_cheetah,11,Tue Jun 2 22:12:30 2015 UTC,Petry>Green
Habs,38a7dg,destroyermaker,4,Tue Jun 2 22:18:18 2015 UTC,Agreed I become a big fan of Petry's quick so excited to see him for years to come and Greens offense capabilities will probably get him 6.5-7 somewhere which is crazy cause I've heard he is bad in his own zone.
Habs,38a7dg,quadriplegic_cheetah,1 point,Tue Jun 2 22:20:48 2015 UTC,I think he would of gotten 6 mill for 4 years on the open market.
Habs,38a7dg,destroyermaker,10,Tue Jun 2 22:36:52 2015 UTC,"I can't handle all of these emotions! So beyond excited. A defence core of Subban - Petry, Markov - Beau, and some combination of  Gilbert - Emelin - Pateryn - Tinordi is real good stuff."
Habs,38a7dg,quadriplegic_cheetah,5,Tue Jun 2 22:10:20 2015 UTC,"I know I'm in the minority but I really hope we trade Gilbert and or Emelin to free up cap, I think Gilbert would be the easier of the two to trade."
Habs,38a7dg,Captain_Roy,22,Tue Jun 2 22:13:15 2015 UTC,you are in the majority dude
Habs,38a7dg,Captain_Roy,2,Tue Jun 2 22:25:25 2015 UTC,Really? Every time I bring it up other then on this sub reddit I get shit on lol. I guess I've found my place to rant then :P
Habs,38a7dg,Fenrir,2,Tue Jun 2 22:29:13 2015 UTC,"We all pooped on Gilbert pretty much the entire playoffs. Emelin a bit, too"
Habs,38a7dg,Fenrir,3,Wed Jun 3 01:32:25 2015 UTC,"We pooped on him in the season, I loved him in the playoffs. As did a lot of people."
Habs,38a7dg,BitterMeanPrick,0,Wed Jun 3 06:05:12 2015 UTC,I wasn't around for a lot of the season. He cost us a lot of plays in the playoffs. It was pretty embarrassing a lot of the time
Habs,38a7dg,Roach6,1 point,Wed Jun 3 18:02:02 2015 UTC,"He was actually pretty good during the playoffs, Markov screwed up in the playoffs. But Gilbert held his own overall."

Habs,38a7dg,ancienthunter,3,Wed Jun 3 01:37:16 2015 UTC,"Gilbert would be really easy to trade imo. He's only got one year left under 3mil. He's a prime deadline day trade chip.  But Emelin has to go. He's making too much, for too little production, especially when we now have ~20 million tied up in 3 defenders who are leagues better than him. Even if we take almost nothing for him, the cap space alone is worth it."
Habs,38a7dg,quadriplegic_cheetah,2,Tue Jun 2 22:28:46 2015 UTC,"I had no issue with Gilbert during regular season but he got whooped in playoffs, I dont know how many times he was on the ice for powerplay goals against I was frustrated seeing him on the pk. Wish we would have scratched him and played Weaver who I love on the penalty kill.   I seen an argument where someone said how bad Gilbert did in playoffs and someone countered the argument with how well his +/- was and everyone was siding with that guy. Only if they handed out a - for powerplay goals against his +/- would have been dead last on team.  As for Emelin I'm not sure if its lack of communication or poor english but he looks lost out there and his positioning is not that good but he does have a decent shot and can lay the body well so maybe a team will call up MB for him.  Not to mention I think NB will get 3 mill so we need to shed either Gilbert or Emelin for sure."
Habs,38a7dg,GlorifiedHobo,3,Tue Jun 2 22:33:43 2015 UTC,"I have no real issues with Gilbert, I think if he was paid ~1.5mil (same contract as Weaver) and played constantly on our bottom pair, people would like him more. Same thing with Emelin. But the reality is, Bergevin gave them both contracts that were too big, and hoped they would grow into the role that fit the contract.  Gilbert is not an elite PKer, but he wasn't absolutely terrible. The whole team was bad. And Markov obviously couldn't handle the added work load of being our shutdown guy on the PK. Weaver would have been ok, if he only played on the PK, but he isn't fast enough to play a regular shift in the NHL anymore, especially not against a fast team like Tampa."
Habs,38a7dg,xNexx_,2,Tue Jun 2 22:42:48 2015 UTC,"Emelin is very much odd man out now, but he has a NTC. His value is also lowered by his contract. Gilbert could probably be moved. Frankly I think that both are replaceable by Pateryn and Tinordi."
Habs,38a7dg,Mbachu,1 point,Tue Jun 2 22:51:30 2015 UTC,I think Tinordi is probably 3rd on the depth behind Pateryn and NB now but anything can happen from between now and training camp.
Habs,38a7dg,xNexx_,2,Tue Jun 2 22:52:37 2015 UTC,"Beaulieu is a top 4, Pateryn 3rd pairing. During Tinordi's brief time on the team he played at least as well as Emelin."
Habs,38a7dg,SiegeWar,1 point,Tue Jun 2 23:04:09 2015 UTC,I would like to see all three of them in the lineup come seasons start
Habs,38a7dg,habsdane,5,Tue Jun 2 23:06:07 2015 UTC,Markov - Subban  Beaulieu - Petry  Tinordi - Pateryn  I wouldn't mind seeing that at all.

Habs,38a7dg,d-radical,13,Tue Jun 2 22:04:54 2015 UTC,Do you guys think that Mike Babcock leaving Detroit affected his decision?
Habs,38a7dg,Powdreams,22,Tue Jun 2 22:15:57 2015 UTC,"I think Montreal Playoffs affected his choice more, but yes, Babcock probably was a factor"
Habs,38a7dg,jo_maka,6,Tue Jun 2 22:24:11 2015 UTC,I think it probably crossed his mind.

Habs,38a7dg,Boomsticks,4,Tue Jun 2 22:23:41 2015 UTC,"I think it's a question worth asking, but I can't see it factoring in."

Habs,38a7dg,YoungMapleLeaf,2,Tue Jun 2 23:04:20 2015 UTC,I know Petry is supposed to be a DFD but I really like seeing him on the PP so maybe he has some hidden offense in his arsenal. Would also take away some minutes from Markov so he is well rested for playoffs.

Habs,38d4k8,Gabroux,5,Wed Jun 3 14:29:57 2015 UTC,Yes. He will use the Mike and this blue line will definitely give a lot of ouch to the opposing forwards.  Can't help it. Sorry.
Habs,38d4k8,swooneytoad,2,Wed Jun 3 13:39:45 2015 UTC,"Markov - Subban  Beaulieu - Petry   Emelin - Gilbert  That's pretty fucking mean, either of the bottom pair can be changed for Tinordi or Pateryn."
Habs,38d4k8,Soutael,2,Wed Jun 3 16:27:46 2015 UTC,We had the highest scoring d pairing last year. 90 points out of Subban and Markov. And Petry was great offensively. Nothing to worry about with the coaching staff.
Habs,38d4k8,quadriplegic_cheetah,1 point,Wed Jun 3 17:11:17 2015 UTC,Considering Therrien's entire breakout strategy is to have the Dmen move the puck across to each other and then all the way down the NZ to a forward - then yes. We will be using their passing skills a great deal.

Habs,38d4k8,bsaures,-7,Wed Jun 3 14:50:33 2015 UTC,Really because the almost 10min per game discrepancy in icetime in the playoffs this season really make the competition  close eh
Habs,38d4k8,BusShelter16,4,Wed Jun 3 14:58:03 2015 UTC,He was also coming off an injury. He'll be top 4 this year.   Our expectations for him is to replace Markov when the time comes. That means future 1st pairing. He needs to play top 4 so he is prepared to take over when needed.
Habs,38d4k8,bsaures,-2,Wed Jun 3 16:54:58 2015 UTC,He played on average just over 14mins in the two games before he was injured. He wasnt even sniffing anything close to top 4 mins
Habs,38d4k8,bsaures,2,Wed Jun 3 17:10:22 2015 UTC,So ?
Habs,38d4k8,BusShelter16,-1,Wed Jun 3 17:15:37 2015 UTC,The guy was arguing he wasnt playing as much because he was coming back from injury i showed that even before injury  he was firmly entrenched in the third pairing.
Habs,38d4k8,nowfindreddit,4,Wed Jun 3 17:28:18 2015 UTC,"yeah, but the comment was about him being in the top 4 next season"
Habs,38d4k8,Morristheduck,2,Wed Jun 3 17:28:55 2015 UTC,"I forgot about those games, but I'll assume it was because it was Nathan's first time in the playoffs. It isn't ridiculous for MT to be skeptical about his performance and lower his minutes as a result.   Regardless, Beaulieu was doing great during the regular season and he's only gonna improve. I'm confident this will be his most improved season so far. Him being in the top 4 isn't too much of a stretch."
Habs,38d4k8,Powdreams,2,Wed Jun 3 17:31:27 2015 UTC,Agreed. He's a bull.
Habs,38d4k8,Muter91,3,Thu Jun 4 00:38:56 2015 UTC,"Beaulieu will be in the top 4 next season if he wasn't last season.  After the season finished he said he finally feels comfortable in the league and feels like an actual NHLer. He also mentioned that he was ready to show us what he can really do. Beaulieu has the talent and it seems that he has the confidence, without a doubt he will be playing in the top 4 beside Petry."
Habs,38d4k8,Lunakhris,0,Wed Jun 3 17:28:37 2015 UTC,"Maybe if our system didn't have our forwards flying the zone so early and being at the red line,  we wouldn't lead the league in icings anymore  Not the best puck moving top four but its good. Anaheim, tampa,  NYR and maybe STL are better."

Habs,38aa00,SiegeWar,9,Tue Jun 2 22:17:40 2015 UTC,"I really like Emelin but there just isn't a lot of room for him because of his cap hit. He could easily be a top 4 defenceman elsewhere but we can't pay $4.1M to a 3rd pairing dman. Unfortunately he has to go, and at the same time Tinordi needs to step up and seize that physical left handed shooting dman spot on the third pair.  I would guess he is most definitely on the go. I assume MB has a larger scheme going on, because Emelin becomes worth more as part of a package deal then as a single trade piece. By himself, maybe a 2nd rounder? Part of a package he could be looked at as a top 4 starting roster player that could look really attractive to some of these rebuilding/fringe teams"
Habs,38aa00,Shooter-mcgavin,2,Tue Jun 2 22:26:56 2015 UTC,He could easily be a top 4 defenceman   I would see him more as bottom 4. I don't think he's capable of really carrying a team on the top pair.
Habs,38aa00,LaughingTrees,5,Tue Jun 2 23:49:47 2015 UTC,"Top 4 - bottom 4  So you two agree he can be a second pair d-man...  You're saying the same shit, each using the wrong term."

Habs,38aa00,Soutael,1 point,Wed Jun 3 20:23:26 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, I guess when I use top 4 I mean a solid second liner who could play top line in a pinch. I certainly don't wholly disagree he's more bottom 4 then top 4 but I was also thinking along the lines of him playing on a team like Dallas or Edmonton or somewhere starved for D, he COULD play top 4 in those places even if he can't here"

Habs,38aa00,player-piano,2,Thu Jun 4 02:41:40 2015 UTC,Doesn't Emelin have a complete NMC in his contract? He's pretty much impossible to move.
Habs,38aa00,HanshinFan,1 point,Wed Jun 3 02:47:01 2015 UTC,I forgot yea it's a full NTC this year and not a modified one until after the year   That doesn't mean he can't be moved just that he can't be moved unless he agrees to it. I don't know if he is so in love with the team and the city he wouldn't accept a trade but I can imagine that knowing at best you're going to be 5th on the depth chart might open up his mind to getting a fresh start somewhere else and getting more minutes

Habs,38aa00,Alfr_d,5,Tue Jun 2 22:18:23 2015 UTC,Emelin or Gilbert. I think Gilbert is easier to move and has more worth. Emelin needs to go more though
Habs,38aa00,damac_phone,4,Tue Jun 2 22:22:51 2015 UTC,Markov?
Habs,38aa00,imtoocoldforthisshit,5,Tue Jun 2 22:24:50 2015 UTC,"Markov would only make sense if it's to massively free cap space for something really good. Markov gone would leave a big gap for a while. As I don't see us having a player that can take his place. If we replace Markov anytime soon, it's with a trade or free agency. Unless Beaulieu make big strides in his development, which would be awesome, but not something I would risk to depend on to build a team."
Habs,38aa00,zeMVK,2,Tue Jun 2 23:04:07 2015 UTC,Gilbert. Pateryn's deal next year is one-way and he played well enough to be our #6. Tinordi hasn't earned a roster spot yet and Beaulieu hasn't earned a permanent top 4 spot. Emelin will be kept until at least the deadline. Gilbert gets cut because he's a right handed bottom pairing defenseman making 2.8. There is a slight downgrade from Gilbert to Pateryn but saving 2 million cap space is worth it.
Habs,38aa00,MessageBoard,7,Tue Jun 2 22:42:22 2015 UTC,I think Beaulieu has earned a permanent top 4 spot actually.
Habs,38aa00,televisionceo,4,Tue Jun 2 22:56:34 2015 UTC,He has.
Habs,38aa00,Fenrir,1 point,Tue Jun 2 23:07:59 2015 UTC,"I don't think Beaulieu has, but I think he has the potential to. Good rookie season for a defensemen last year. Better skater than Emelin."
Habs,38aa00,LaughingTrees,3,Tue Jun 2 23:52:06 2015 UTC,If you look at the numbers there is no question about it. He is significantly better than Gilbert and Emelin.
Habs,38aa00,Fenrir,1 point,Tue Jun 2 23:57:49 2015 UTC,"You're going to have to point out which numbers exactly:  Emelin - 68 gp 3 g 11 a +5  Beaulieu - 64 gp 1 g 8 a +6  Gilbert - 72 4 g 8 a +10  Pateryn, in my personal observation, played better than Beaulieu (hence the flair change). Pateryn is the future Emelin (hopefully better), while Beaulieu is the future Gilbert (probably better)."

Habs,38aa00,LaughingTrees,3,Wed Jun 3 02:53:07 2015 UTC,"I know. Beaulieu has that ceiling though. He's a top 10 pick that fell to us in the draft. I also don't mean to say he'll be as good as the General was in his prime, just that he'll be the one taking Markov's place as the number 2 on the top pairing."
Habs,38aa00,TheBlackLight,2,Wed Jun 3 03:06:03 2015 UTC,"I don't think you can honestly say Beaulieu played too well to be on the third pairing. Parts of his game still need a lot of work. PK was a guy who immediately showed he was too good for the third pairing. Then too good for the second pairing. Beaulieu hasn't done that yet even for small stretches of 5-6 games. Beaulieu shows flashes a few shifts per game, but never with enough consistency that says damn this guy should be playing 20 minutes every night."
Habs,38aa00,MessageBoard,-3,Tue Jun 2 23:21:14 2015 UTC,"PK was a guy who immediately showed he was too good for the third pairing.   Offensively, yes. Defensively... he was 7th Defensemen. However, he really improved this year defensively."

I suspect PAP to be on the block also."

Markov....I think he has gas enough to be on the 2nd pairing. He had too much ice time this season and it led to fatigue. He doesn't need to be with Subban getting top mins"
Habs,38aa00,bsaures,1 point,Wed Jun 3 16:28:44 2015 UTC,If any of the d gets moved (which may not even happen)it will be in the order of gilbert markov emelin.  Reasons:   The right side is our strongest so gilbert at 3 rd is expendable for peteryn. Markov regressed as the season wore on and especially  in the playoffs. Emelin did most of the heavy lifting  on the left side. Emelin is the only one with a full ntc he doesnt move unless he wants to.
Habs,38aa00,zeMVK,0,Tue Jun 2 22:41:23 2015 UTC,"Markov has a modified NTC as of now. Emelin still has a full NTC, only for this upcoming season, then it changes. There's debate that Markov just didn't have enough gas left because of how overused he was. I agree that Emelin got a lot of flack, while it was partly deserved, he still has value. I don't see Emelin being able to compensate for/if Markov's traded though. I can see Markov traded only if it's to free the most cap space possible. Otherwise, Markov could be put on the 2nd line and Beaulieu on the 1st, assuming Beaulieu can pick it up. I can see Emelin being in other teams' top 4D. Just hope that Emelin would waive his NTC for one of them."
Habs,38aa00,bsaures,0,Tue Jun 2 23:17:55 2015 UTC,"Bealieu the guy who couldnt even excel at extremely  sheltered 3rd pairing mins is nowhere near ready to be even a top 4dman nevermind a top 2.  Thee is nothing markov is currently offering that emelin cant do. 5 on 5 emelin  has matched markovs ppg over the last 3 years despite markov getting signifigantly more offensive  minutes and more time with pk subban. Defensively there would be no downgrade and you cant even argue the pp would be worse because with markov qbing the last couple years it has been awful.   Theres That and the fact that emelin is almost 8 years younger, caries a lower cap hit, isnt in the way of naming a captain  that  isn't  him, and can comfortably  play on both sides something none of our other dman have sone for long stretches."
Habs,38aa00,TheBlackLight,1 point,Wed Jun 3 00:12:04 2015 UTC,Emelin drags down everyone he plays with. Everyone posts better numbers when playing with somebody other than Emelin. I also find it incredibly hard to believe Emelin has matched Markov in anything in terms of production. Markov got 50 points this year. Emelin has 50 points in his entire career.
Habs,38aa00,bsaures,0,Wed Jun 3 01:34:18 2015 UTC,Ive posted the numbers before but go look for yourself if you dont believe me. Markov for all the opportunities he gets 5 on 5 with all the icetime and the ozone starts does very little points with it. Emelin has shown that he can produce better than markov given the same opportuities.  One thing that was clear this year on the dcore was whoever was playing on the third pairing was going to be heavily sheltered  as evident by the extremely  low qoc and qoccorsi of bealieu and  pateryn the two players who were almost exclusively on the third pair. Combine that with subban and markovs ozone push it meant whoever played on the second pairing was going to get shafted in terms of usuage. This ultimately  fell on emelin gilbert and gonchar. Emelin played the role the entire  time but gilbert and  gonchar both got time away on the sheltered 3rd pairing. It doesnt take a genius to figure out  that if you  go from heavy dzone starts  to ozone starts and from playing against some of the best to a bunch of bottom six fringe nhlers your possesion stats will get better.  Thats what happens
Habs,38aa00,TheBlackLight,1 point,Wed Jun 3 03:11:02 2015 UTC,I'm not going to prove a point you brought up for you. If you can't provide a source for a claim then don't make that claim. If you can then please provide the source.  To say that Emelin can do what Markov can do after playing a handful of games with Subban and never showing promise at any other time is a huge stretch. For the past while he has been playing like a good bottom pairing dman except he's on our second pairing and making 4 mil. He should go. If Beaulieu still can't play on the second pairing next year then play Gilbert with Petry.
Habs,38aa00,bsaures,0,Wed Jun 3 03:33:56 2015 UTC,"Per nhl .com  Markov ES Points last 3 seasons  2014-15 24 point in 81 games 2013-14 21 points in 81 games 2012-13 7 points in 48 games  For a total of 52 points in 210 games which is a ppg of .2476  Emelin ES points last 3 seasons  2014-15 14 points in 68 games 3013-14 14 points in 59 games 2012-13 12 points in 38 games   For a total of  40 points in 165 games which is a ppg of .2424  Over a 82 game season that is the difference between 20.3 points and 19.9 points so less than half  a point difference. This despite the fact that markov get a much bigger zone push than emelin starting 4.6% more of his shifts in the ozone this year., 3.1 % more in 13-14, while starting .8 percent less in the lockout year when they played together 5 on 5. Which proves another point when given close to the same role and quality of icetime emelin vastly out performed Markov having 5 more points in ten fewer games! So offensively there is zero support for having markov out on offensive situations vs emelin.  Defensively emelin would actually have an easier job if he took markovs role. As shown above the last two seasons markov has had a solid ozone boost compared to emelin. As far as icetime goes 5 on 5 and pk time markov only played less than 2 mins more at ES and 10 seconds more on PK. By the time the playoffs roled around Emelin actually was second on the team in combined ES and PK TOI/Game so basically he was already getting 1st pairing mins minus the PP time. He did this while Markov had Subban a top 5 dman in the league as his partner vs emelin who had former buyout gilbert and 40 year Sergei ""old man"" gonchar as his partners for most of the year."

Habs,38aa00,Fabien_Lamour,2,Tue Jun 2 22:33:29 2015 UTC,"6.9 mill for Emelin(4.1) and Gilbert(2.8) for our 3rd trio is way too much. I agree with you. I'd rather keep those 4 you mentioned as our top 4D. I don't think it's far-fetched if Markov's traded for the cap space though. However, I hope Markov stays a Hab until he retires. Emelin will only waive his NTC for a team he'll want to play for and would definitely free more space than Gilbert. Gilbert is the easiest to trade with no restrictions and 1 year left on his contract."

Habs,38aa00,NastyKnate,1 point,Wed Jun 3 14:27:08 2015 UTC,You still need two 4th liners to complete your roster to 23 players with that 7 millions. That's between 1.5 and 2M less. Let's say 1M to Mitchell plus a rookie making under 1M.  The team is more cap strapped than you seem to think.

So yep we're screwed, main reason why I keep saying that we need to trade Plekanec for a winger (with a lower cap hit). Plekanec is the only one with a little value, DD and Emelin have none."

Habs,384luh,captainhook77,11,Mon Jun 1 21:01:42 2015 UTC,"Here's a quick breakdown.  I don't see Dumont becoming much more than a career AHL'er/4th line grinder at best.  Way too early to tell where Ellis will end up. If Pateryn stays up, he could have a bigger role to fill for the Ice Caps."
Habs,384luh,CarelessPotato,3,Mon Jun 1 21:12:21 2015 UTC,"Ellis has always been regarded as a long term. Before turning pro, he was regarded as a great skater, but didn't have any outstanding skill in any other area, including his shot, IQ, defense, and physicality. Won a Memorial Cup with Bournival in Shawinigan, and as a pro has struggled to establish himself, getting buried in the depth charts and not translating to the pro game as easily. He has steadily progressed, not puttin up amazing offensive numbers (but did this year), but also getting much better defensively. I think coming into a weak Hamilton team his first couple years set him back as well."
Habs,384luh,LegendaryWolfee,3,Mon Jun 1 22:10:33 2015 UTC,"Both of them are ""okay""  prospects Dumont being the better of the two. Can't see them being roster players unless a trade is about to happen"

Habs,383v0n,destroyermaker,3,Mon Jun 1 17:43:11 2015 UTC,"This fundamental misconception is one of the biggest sources of dumb hockey analysis.  It's why I roll my eyes when people talk about Eller not having hockey sense or DD being ""worthless."" Scoring NHL goals is hard, there really aren't that many players who do it on a regular basis. DD's 14 goals put him 167th in the NHL overall. That's top 6 production."
Habs,383v0n,Fenrir,2,Mon Jun 1 19:13:49 2015 UTC,"The frustrating thing is most of the players we have in either of those categories are much closer to the lower end of the points range than they are to the higher end.  We have a bunch of ""good"" players, but very few ""very good"" players and only a couple ""great"" players.  Edit: by comparison, going exclusively from memory, look at the last few cup winners.  L.A. Has Doughty, Kopitar, Quick and a great captain in Brown. I'd compare that to Subban, price, but I'd say Kopitar is ahead of Patch and again, without looking at stats, I believe they had more secondary scoring than we can have with this roster.  Chicago has Toews, Kane, Sharp, Keith, Hossa and more. No comparison.  Boston won with Chara, Thomas at the top of his game, Bergeron, Seguin although he wasn't playing at his current level. That might be the one in recent history that is the most encouraging. No more superstars than us, really. They played better, though.  Pittsburgh has Crosby, Malkin, and a very solid Fleury and Letang back in 2009.  Long story short, we need a bit more ""oomf"" that can force line matching and for the love of God, line stability."

The article didn't say anything about DD producing on the third line because of poor opposition nor do I see how DD producing on the third line because of weaker opposition (which would be a silly thing to complain about) is in any way related to Eller having poor linemates.

He just had a weaker year offensively than what people expected."
Habs,383v0n,Julien_fucke_bouzzin,1 point,Tue Jun 2 00:05:53 2015 UTC,"What do people exactly expect from Eller? 40-50 points from a 3rd liner with constant defensive zone starts and no PP time? If Eller is gonna be used the way he is, he is gonna disappoint a lot of you. I mean, I like him a lot, but he is no Crosby or hell Jordan Stall in his prime (if you wanna use a 3rd liner) but Stall still got 2 min pr. game on the PP. Unlike Eller's 0:28 seconds."
Habs,383v0n,rembot,1 point,Tue Jun 2 00:29:09 2015 UTC,"It said DD was getting first line minutes,.....and he was,along with playing with the top wingers.  The article was right on the money. This team doesn't shoot and when they do they are not very threatening. The PP,......pass it around the perimeter hoping for PK to get a shot....LOL...like that is so hard to recognize and prepare for.  The team has a weak offensive attack."
Habs,383v0n,ShivasIrons983E,1 point,Tue Jun 2 10:07:34 2015 UTC,You realize when DD is on the third line he doesn't face the same competition as when Eller is on the third line right? When Eller is on the third line it used deployed solely in defensive zone minutes. It doesn't matter where you move DD in the lineup he's still getting offensive minutes + PP time.
Habs,383v0n,MessageBoard,1 point,Tue Jun 2 15:05:14 2015 UTC,Lol im pretty sure they were playing together.... Eller as a center and DD on the wing
Habs,382wwk,hkycoach,9,Mon Jun 1 13:47:04 2015 UTC,"Really really excited to see what happens with Mike at training camp, even moreso than any trades/drafts that happen this summer."
Habs,382wwk,Alfr_d,2,Mon Jun 1 14:08:19 2015 UTC,"He's a very complete player. Trusty in the faceoffs, makes big hits, is constantly behind his net making breakout passes and he's in front of the net screening the goalies and missing grade A chances. This is exactly what we need. Except the last part haha. The best word I can use to describe him would be ""reliable"" at this point."
Habs,382wwk,quadriplegic_cheetah,3,Tue Jun 2 17:45:43 2015 UTC,"Can't wait to see how McCarron performs during training camp. Looks focused and ready to make the jump at the pro level, even if it's one year in the AHL."
Habs,382wwk,TellSloanISaidHi,7,Mon Jun 1 15:42:37 2015 UTC,"Its funny how berkshire tries to spin arguements to justify some players performace but not others. All year he rags on emelin for his corsi numbers yet never mentions the fact he was getting shafted usuage wise with partners who couldnt play the shutdown  role with him.  Yet when lars eller produces points below a low end third liner all the excuses come out. He gets put in a more defensive role, he has bad linemates (eventhough in the exact same article he shows that prust sekac weise and dsp were either average 3rd liners or better)."
Habs,382wwk,bsaures,6,Mon Jun 1 14:29:57 2015 UTC,Disagree with him on DD and grab the popcorn
Habs,382wwk,paul_33,3,Mon Jun 1 16:18:02 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry, I know I can't do any better, but I wish Berkshire would stop writing articles.  It's getting to the point where he writes whatever fits his narrative and doesn't shift for anything else."
Habs,382wwk,JMPesce,1 point,Mon Jun 1 20:04:47 2015 UTC,And his reputation is also taking a hit because of that.  I warned him almost a year ago.  He does not give a fuck and it's unfortunate..
Habs,382wwk,televisionceo,1 point,Tue Jun 2 14:26:55 2015 UTC,"This is such a dumb objection. His narrative is that Therrien is terrible because absolutely every piece of evidence that anyone can find supports that conclusion. Writing something that fits your narrative isn't bad if your narrative is correct. It's not even like the conclusions he draws are unique to him. There are plenty of writers and analysts whose conclusions more or less jive with Berkshire's.    I'm still waiting for any piece of quantifiable evidence beyond wins that demonstrates Therrien is doing a good job. Just one thing that a reasonable person could look at and say, ""Hey, the coach is responsible for this and we're doing well in it.""  Because right now Therrien's primary coaching skill seems to be his ability to spell the name Carey Price on the lineup card correctly."
Habs,382wwk,Fenrir,1 point,Tue Jun 2 18:19:21 2015 UTC,👌
Habs,382wwk,JMPesce,7,Tue Jun 2 18:30:22 2015 UTC,Yea I'd really wish he'd try a bit harder to be objective but he basically just chooses favorites and twists stats to promote them/ blame Therrien if they don't play well.
Habs,382wwk,Sharks9,2,Mon Jun 1 14:48:15 2015 UTC,I think Eller capable of a top 6 role.
Habs,382wwk,quadriplegic_cheetah,1 point,Tue Jun 2 06:47:33 2015 UTC,"I think so too. He has shown flashes of brilliance and given the opportunity to stay at the #2 centre position for 10+ games in a row without being benched/shuffled/demoted he might just be able to get a handle on the position.  An aspect of MT's coaching I take issue with is his propensity to play favorites and his maddening inability to just let the roster go for a little while and see what happens. Really, who cares if we finish a season with 110 points or 98? If we arrive at the end of the year with a team that has evolved and is confident in itself, won't our playoff performance be all the better? To me, that's all that matters. This insanity in Montreal of not being able to go on a losing streak without having a city full of radio DJs and scribblers screaming bloody murder is a huge detriment to the team. /rambling rant"
Habs,382wwk,HammerOfTheSlobs,3,Tue Jun 2 16:35:24 2015 UTC,"If you've got anything substantial go on the site and point it out.  There's plenty of evidence that Emelin makes the team worse when he's on the ice if you look for it. His defensive partners do better when they're not playing with him, ergo it is not them who are the problem.  Eller had 15 goals, that's comfortably top 6 production. That's probably more goals than our entire bottom 6 had combined if you don't count the goals Weise scored while on the first line. You can't get assists by yourself, that's a simple fact of hockey. So, the one category Eller has direct control over he does well in, whereas the one he doesn't have control over he does poorly in.  The issue here isn't that Berkshire is spinning, it's that you're wrong and fail to recognize it."
Habs,382wwk,Fenrir,1 point,Mon Jun 1 19:45:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah Eller firmly produces at a top 6 level.   I don't disagree that Berkshire can have some pretty serious biases some times and can definitely be an ass about it a lot, but those were terrible examples of it"
Habs,382wwk,Doc460,1 point,Tue Jun 2 11:40:23 2015 UTC,"His biggest bias is towards things that show up in the numbers. As far as biases go, that's far better than a lot of other biases that you see amongst hockey fans on a regular basis, because at least there's grounds to discuss if you disagree."
Habs,382wwk,Fenrir,1 point,Tue Jun 2 13:48:21 2015 UTC,I was really disappointed when I heard rumours of MB trying to package Mccarron in a trade this past year. I'm hoping this memorial cup may have MB thankful he didn't.
Habs,382xde,hkycoach,5,Mon Jun 1 13:50:52 2015 UTC,"A captain speaks to the officials and takes ceremonial faceoffs. A leader leads the team on and off the ice. Not all captains are leaders, and not all leaders are captains."
Habs,382xde,aaronwrotkowski,9,Mon Jun 1 18:21:29 2015 UTC,"Disagree entirely. There's more to being a captain than talking to officials. Locker room dynamics are a weird thing, and having the ""C"" on the right player can really shift things. It's something that's taken very seriously by players, from what I understand."
Habs,382xde,HanshinFan,11,Mon Jun 1 16:16:23 2015 UTC,"Locker room dynamics are a weird thing, and having the ""C"" on the right player can really shift things. It's something that's taken very seriously by players, from what I understand.   That's where Carey Price comes into play. He's the captain, despite not having a letter on his jersey."
Habs,382xde,Ottawans_Rock,6,Mon Jun 1 16:20:53 2015 UTC,"Do you know that? For sure? I love Price as much as the next guy, but ""best player"" and ""captain"" don't always go together. Price has always struck me as a calm, quiet introvert - I obviously trust him to make saves more than any other goalie in the league, but will he step up and call a players' only meeting when it's needed? Will he chew out a guy for lack of motivation?"
Habs,382xde,HanshinFan,11,Mon Jun 1 16:27:54 2015 UTC,"I definitely can't speak for the players, but from first-hand experience in the locker room he's the captain, but doesn't wear the C. The players defer to his opinion, they praise his leadership endlessly, and give all their respect to him. He's not the kind of guy who demands respect, he commands it, which to me is what makes a great leader.    He's the strong silent type, but he also shows emotion when necessary."
Habs,382xde,Ottawans_Rock,4,Mon Jun 1 16:31:02 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, then. Thanks for that perspective - obviously as a fan my access to the room is limited."
Habs,382xde,HanshinFan,6,Mon Jun 1 16:33:21 2015 UTC,"Cheers! I only had access to the room for two rounds of the playoffs, so I don't want to make it seem like I was there entirety of the regular season.  I have to admit though, he has this presence to him that just makes you sit back and absorb whatever he says.   Again, I might be wrong, but I think that's very important when it comes to leadership."
Habs,382xde,Ottawans_Rock,2,Mon Jun 1 16:36:02 2015 UTC,"Define ""first hand experience"". You seem to have great points though."
Habs,382xde,quadriplegic_cheetah,2,Tue Jun 2 06:50:23 2015 UTC,"I was lucky enough to cover the Habs during the playoffs for a newspaper, which meant I was given access to the locker room & press conferences. I spoke to the players, the coach, etc, and got a slight idea of how the lock room dynamics work.  But I don't want it to seem as if I am all-knowing in that respect, I was just lucky enough to get a glimpse of what goes on behind the curtain."
Habs,382xde,Ottawans_Rock,2,Tue Jun 2 14:44:19 2015 UTC,Oh that's awesome. And you are a fellow Habs fan from Ottawa I assume?
Habs,382xde,quadriplegic_cheetah,3,Tue Jun 2 17:43:16 2015 UTC,"Probably, but a team needs a captain, and the habs can't go on forever without one."
Habs,382xde,mrpopenfresh,2,Mon Jun 1 19:02:23 2015 UTC,We are used to a team having a captain.  A team does not necessarily need a captain.
Habs,382xde,jo_maka,1 point,Mon Jun 1 19:42:51 2015 UTC,"I think it does. Even if there is more than one leader on the team, you need that figurehead at the top leading the players and representing the team."
Habs,382xde,mrpopenfresh,2,Mon Jun 1 19:43:56 2015 UTC,"There is one figurehead who, because of the CBA, is not allowed to have a letter. Leadership is not manufactured, it is organic. This team already chose him as their ultimate leader.   Being a captain for the Habs right now is the same as being the Queen of England. A pompous yet vapid title, because someone already gets that nod."
Habs,382xde,jo_maka,1 point,Mon Jun 1 19:49:37 2015 UTC,"While I agree with you there are others who get similar respect. Those players being Subban and Pacioretty. When Patches walks into a room people stop talking, the listen to him. And Subban is the on ice leader, when he jumps over the boards the plays run through him.  The Habs have more than one leader."
Habs,382xde,quadriplegic_cheetah,3,Tue Jun 2 06:53:08 2015 UTC,I said it a couple of times already here. WE DO NOT NEED A CAPTAIN.  We have one who doesn't have the letter. Then we have a core group of leaders who can officiate as ''A'' to talk to the media and the refs. I like the idea of having a more horizontal structure and not having ''one'' person to point or to rely on when things go bad. This is actually a very progressive approach that is paying handsome dividends in the workplace in many ways. I believe that type of success can be replicated in the locker room.
Habs,38372w,SubbyDoo,11,Mon Jun 1 15:03:58 2015 UTC,"Would like to have him because of his raw talent... But..  1) He has character issues, I don't think he and MT will get along  2) He doesn't seem like a MB type of guy  3) He will ask for alot of money (Do I think it could be worth it, yes, but not sure MB thinks the same)"

Roy knew how to work him when he was even worse back in juniors. I lived in Qc at the time, I still remember. If MT can't handle him, he has no business coaching at all. He prides himself on character more than anything. This is right in his wheelhouse."

Habs,380e40,fatneszsebby,8,Sun May 31 22:39:49 2015 UTC,"You can trade anytime you want. However, the trade deadline is more of a roster deadline. It's a date to determine all the players the team possesses that are eligible for the playoffs. So if two teams make a trade after the deadline, it can be done, but neither player can play for their new teams in the playoffs.  I remember hearing something about teams making trade deals but only accepting to reveal and carry it out after the playoffs are over, in the situation that one of the teams makes the playoffs. This can be a reason to the Plekanec trade rumors that were circulating a couple days ago.  I don't have any examples in mind. But I'm pretty sure there's been trades during the playoffs between teams that weren't involved in the post-season. Usually, you start hearing more trades and rumors once the playoffs are over."

Habs,380e40,burnSMACKER,2,Mon Jun 1 04:14:49 2015 UTC,"Trades between eliminated teams may be made at anytime, including during the playoffs, but since it doesn't change anything, they often announce them around draft day. However, I think it's forbidden, or at least frowned upon, to make an announcement during the Stanley Cup finals, so as not to take exposure away from it."
Habs,380e40,TurboDragon,2,Mon Jun 1 13:18:01 2015 UTC,"I suppose it can be summed up that there are 3 hot times to make a trade.   1) The trade deadline that other people have noted is mostly a roster eligibility deadline for playoffs.   2) IMO between June 20th and July 5th. This is because UFA day is July 1 and teams can start courting players a few days before that. So if you have a trade in the works for player x and player x plays really well with player y who is a UFA you may finalize the trade for player x.   3) The last ""hot time"" for trades is in September and early October when everyone gets to see how training camps are doing and if they have interest in other teams talent pools. The Erat for Forsberg trade comes to mind as in many ways Washington made that clusterfuck of a trade because they wanted immediate aid imo because they thought they were a contender that year.   In short all scenarios happen because of important dates in the league. 1 is because of the trade deadline, 2 is because of UFA day, and 3 is because of the start of the season."

Habs,37vgq6,TenMinutesToDowntown,5,Sat May 30 23:35:33 2015 UTC,"You know, sometimes I feel the bomb from the point actually takes away from Subban's game. It's obviously an awesome tool but the team, and Subban, rely on it too much when he has a host of other skills he can use to score.  A long bomb, no matter how hard you shoot it, is relatively easy to defend against if you can predict it, particularly when it's not tipped or screened, two things that I don't think we do well (although I have no evidence.)  It would be very interesting to see some numbers on how that particular shot of his has fared over the years. My feeling is that it's dropped dramatically in effectiveness because by now everyone knows it's coming. Subban has a great shot, but he can't score with impunity from the same place without some element of surprise like Ovechkin because Ovechkin is otherworldly."

Most of PK's goals in that video were bombs from the blue line or so, and most of them weren't even screened.  I think we could learned a thing or two from teams like the Rangers, Ducks or Lightning (i know, f*ck those guys but their PP is incredibly well played). I think PK's shot is a weapon we should use as often as we could, but create situations, rotations, plays that isolate PK (or anybody actually) for the partially or not screen shot it takes to score.  Ps. I would also apply this thought on our offensive strategy in general... We rely too much on turn overs and ""surnombre"".  GHG!"

I don't want someone on my team, who will be a good leader up to a point, only to suddenly bail on the fans/teammates for nothing other than selfishly being bitter that their own GM didn't favour them for an international team.   That's the exact opposite of a leader, veteran, and team player."
Habs,37sz4b,Fenrir,-1,Sat May 30 23:12:41 2015 UTC,"If your boss, who you've worked very hard for and done an extremely good job for, skipped over you for a position you desperately wanted and were very qualified for, I suspect you might not be so keen on him afterwards either.  It is not selfish for St. Louis to decide that he doesn't want to work with someone who didn't have enough faith in him to pick him for Team Canada. Yes, it's ego. But it's the type of ego you need to have to play hockey, or any other sport, at an elite level.  He's not obligated to play for any team. He doesn't owe the fans anything. There's no indication he gave them anything less than his best.   That's the exact opposite of a leader, veteran, and team player.    Yeah, this is just media narrative nonsense."

And why should he have gotten special consideration merely because it was HIS boss that was picking from the BEST PLAYERS IN THE WORLD. That is such bizarre logic, and I'm extremely glad Team Canada GM's don't just favour whoever plays on their team over younger, more skilled, better players.  When you don't get selected to the most talented team on the planet, you don't know throw a tantrum and demand a trade. It's as simple as that.   It's completely ego, and not something I'd like on my team."
Habs,37sz4b,Fenrir,-1,Sun May 31 00:35:56 2015 UTC,"I'm extremely glad Team Canada GM's don't just favour whoever plays on their team over younger, more skilled, better players.   St. Louis was as qualified as plenty of other players on the team. I'd imagine that was what set him off. It is not special consideration to expect your boss to understand your abilities.   It's completely ego, and not something I'd like on my team.   Well, then you're in trouble because there is more than one player on your team with an equal or greater ego.  He asked to be traded because he was upset. How is that a tantrum?"
Habs,37sz4b,ghuss,2,Sun May 31 00:43:28 2015 UTC,"Well I guess we'll just have to disagree on his talent level.  I just feel that, unless you're Wayne freakin Gretzky, you DON'T demand a trade because you didn't get selected to the most talented team put together in the WORLD."

Thanks to the Lightning, ice hockey  as a sport has grown here, but is isn't like it is up north.  For me to goof aroung with a stick and puck for an hour cost me $20.

Habs,37qega,Duja,10,Fri May 29 16:11:15 2015 UTC,I'd be disappointed if nothing is done to change the top 6 forwards.
Habs,37qega,shiram,10,Fri May 29 16:12:29 2015 UTC,"It's hard to say. I think it's hard to rely on a big but inconsistent FA winger to contribute, though it wouldn't hurt, but there are also prospects who could come in and potentially do a better job at a much better price. I wouldnt mind a low cost-low risk FA."
Habs,37qega,CarelessPotato,5,Fri May 29 16:42:38 2015 UTC,"Not to mention that the FA market is pretty sparse for top 6 players right now -- on RW you've basically got Buffalo cast-offs, Frolik, and Williams, and Williams is no longer the first liner he was, while LW and C is basically ageing career 2/3rd liners (Glencross, Cole are probably the best LWs, Tlusty's probably the only UFA C who hasn't hit his peak).  I think you've gotta treat this FA year like NAshville did last year, siging a couple vets for cheap and hoping one of them works out like Ribeiro did."
Habs,37qega,Roughly6Owls,3,Fri May 29 17:04:26 2015 UTC,"If Boedker doesn't sign with Coyotes, he would be a pretty good RW to get. But I imagine a lot of teams would hunt for him."

Habs,37qega,CarelessPotato,5,Fri May 29 17:02:03 2015 UTC,"Most trades are sideways ones, not improvement. People keep bringing up Plekanec but forget that we simply will not get someone better back. Change for change sake isn't going to make this team a contender.  Ergo let's stop losing picks and prospects for rentals. Draft well and develop and worry about the future, vs the right now.   Because let's face it - ""right now"" is Therrien and he's not winning a cup here. Not going to happen."

Habs,37qega,paul_33,5,Fri May 29 16:58:03 2015 UTC,Oh God not Franson. Overrated and slow as molasses.
Habs,37qega,hank0,10,Fri May 29 16:23:23 2015 UTC,"I actually think Franson's underrated -- he spent a bunch of time in Toronto (where it's hard to look good), then got traded for way too much to Nashville and got scratched cause their D is amazing, so everyone decided he must've been overrated because of how much Nashville paid.  He's no Petry/Sekera, who I think are the better free agents this season, and he's probably worse than Martin or Ehrhoff in terms of pure skill, but I don't think Franson would be bad as a bottom 4 defender. Getting him for that price.. that is a different, harder problem."
Habs,37qega,Roughly6Owls,2,Fri May 29 16:31:55 2015 UTC,The thing with Franson is that he's not that great unless he's being used on the powerplay.
Habs,37qega,Roughly6Owls,2,Fri May 29 19:36:10 2015 UTC,"Mike Green hasn't looked great off the powerplay either, and lots of people want him on their team."

Upshot: Therrien provides very little defensive improvement and stifles offense. I know lots of people like to point to how well we did and refer to calls for his firing as a ""circle jerk"" but I sincerely believe this team's position in the standings was not helped by MT's coaching.   Let's face it, they were a bit lucky at times this year, as they often roared back from deficits and won an inordinate number of games they should have lost, imo. That, to me, is a sign of a team that performs well when the shackles come off and the ""system"" has to be set aside in favor of scoring goals.  Should Therrien be replaced? I won't say that, but I don't think he should be viewed as having a huge amount of job security, either.  Of course I am biased, because I am a fan of this great club, and seeing it turn into a 1990s New Jersey Devils dump-chase clone hurts my soul (and bores me to tears)."
Habs,37q3il,HammerOfTheSlobs,5,Fri May 29 17:07:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's an interesting article. Make sure you click through to read the other piece that guy wrote about evaluating coaches. It's equally interesting."
Habs,37q3il,paul_33,2,Fri May 29 18:19:39 2015 UTC,"calls for his firing as a ""circle jerk""   It's kind of cop out response given a circle jerk insinuates everyone agrees and is just patting themselves on the back. I'd argue the majority here don't agree with Therrien being a bad coach.  Personally until he fixes his coaching issues (unlikely given his history) this team isn't a contender."

Habs,37q3il,slayeryouth,4,Fri May 29 18:56:58 2015 UTC,"Since the Devil's last Cup, only two teams that have won it have been negative possession teams, neither one of them were the Devils, and one of them saw immediate improvement leading to positive possession and the Cup after Therrien was fired.  So if you're hoping for a cup anytime soon through giving up possession of the puck for no reason and not scoring goals, you'll probably be disappointed.  Although I guess it worth noting that since the NHL didn't track missed and block shots before 2005 that it's possible that those teams had negative possession and some how still managed a positive shot differential, albeit not very likely."
Habs,37q3il,quadriplegic_cheetah,1 point,Fri May 29 19:20:10 2015 UTC,"Bylsma year mimicked Therriens system though. That's not even an excuse. It is widely believed even if Therrien stayed that year they would have won. It wasn't just dumb luck that they Pens made it to the final in 07. Regardless of whether it was Bylsma or Therrien they would have won, and that's a thought commonly shared by Pens fans as well. Not just me"
Habs,37q3il,slayeryouth,1 point,Sat May 30 07:52:09 2015 UTC,"They were 5 points out of a playoff spot when the Pens let him go.  Some people might consider that a cup contender who would have won regardless, but they're few and far between.  Bylsma might have even mimicked Therrien's system, but the Pen's immediate improvement upon his dismissal would suggest that either that isn't true, or Therrien wasn't particularly good at implementing it.  Or maybe the entire roster just magically improved by sheer coincidence at the same time Therrien was let go."
Habs,37q3il,quadriplegic_cheetah,1 point,Sat May 30 17:22:20 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure Shero said his goal was to light a fire under his teams ass. Show the team that they have to get their shit together or others will be moved. All Bylsma did was re-use Therriens system, except he had players who were motivated to play for their jobs."
Habs,37q3il,slayeryouth,2,Sat May 30 17:56:03 2015 UTC,"Well here's what Shero actually said:   I didn't like... the direction the team was headed,...I've watched for a number of weeks and, at the end of the day, the direction is not what I wanted to have here. I wasn't comfortable, and that's why the change was made.  It wasn't so much the outcome, it was how the game was played.  He said the Penguins, who played a tight defensive style under Therrien, need to get back to being a fast, offensive-driven team.  With the strengths we have, we should be able to go into buildings and make teams deal with the quality of players we have at every position.   It was also believed that ""they players were no longer buying into his disciplinarian ways.""  So I mean, yeah he probably was trying to light a fire under his players in as much as any GM of a losing team is going to try to, but I'm not sure how one would take away from any of what he said that he saw the players as the source of the problem."
Habs,37q3il,quadriplegic_cheetah,1 point,Sat May 30 18:12:10 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, it's important to remember that Therrien still got that team to a SCF. Bylsma basically did what MT did except he won two more games."
Habs,37q3il,televisionceo,-2,Sat May 30 18:14:55 2015 UTC,I don't think so. Our possesssion will improve anyway because we will have better players and we still have prospects who will improve. And don't forget therrien won't be there in 2 years probably. BUt for now he is doing a good job with what he has.
Habs,37q3il,slayeryouth,2,Fri May 29 19:29:36 2015 UTC,"I really don't see Therrien going anywhere anytime soon barring some kind of huge losing skid or missing the playoffs.  I get that Bergevin feels that part of his job is to manage expectations, nor would I expect him to say anything other than he's happy with the job Therrien's been doing until he's during him, but he also hasn't done much over the past two seasons to suggest that there's much of a gulf between him and Therrien either.  But I wouldn't mind being surprised in that regard.  I don't buy the argument that it's a problem with the roster.  I mean, sure the roster can always get better, but between 2013 and the end of the 2014 season there was a huge drop off in the underlying numbers, and only a marginal improvement between 2014 and the season that just past.  I suppose it's possible that they players just somehow got worse, but not very likely.  Price on the hand has shown tons of improvement since then but it's not really unreasonable to expect a goalie to improve from the season they were playing with a tweaked groin, and if we're going to credit any of the coaching staff with that it should be Stephane Waite since he's the guy who actually coaches the goalies.  I'm not necessarily of mind that Therrien should be fired.  There's something to be said for stability and the guys seem to like playing for him, but unless he's willing to adjust his system and move away from chip and chase and skating in straight lines along the perimeter all the time, I just don't have a lot of faith we'll see a cup win under him."
Habs,37q3il,televisionceo,1 point,Fri May 29 20:09:14 2015 UTC,Just be patient.  Of we did not progress in the next 2 years there will be solid ground for complaining.  Until then we have a lot of reasons to be optimistic. A winning team takes time to build when you don't have offensive stars .
Habs,37q3il,Muter91,2,Fri May 29 20:11:21 2015 UTC,They were one of the best shot surpression teams of their generation though. Habs are literally the opposite.

Do you seriously think that because we are 22bd in the league in shot supression that the Habs players say, damn it, we are so god damn bad. I doubt they even know that. They say we just finished the year with the least goals against. We can complain and arm chair coach all we want, but let's face it, we know nothing about coaching in the NHL. And well we have no idea how to bring results, none of us do. But we all act like it. What if Therrien knows what he's doing? What if he and the team have an idea of how to coach/ play? Just a big what if. We all bitch about Corsi stats and say how bad Therrien is, but the players (excluding Eller) love the dude and in the end what's important is how he and his team gets on the ice and finds a way to win."

Obviously they know what is going on because they often say: ""we need to be better in front of Price, we need to score more, get more chances.""    We can complain and arm chair coach all we want, but let's face it, we know nothing about coaching in the NHL. And well we have no idea how to bring results, none of us do. But we all act like it. What if Therrien knows what he's doing? What if he and the team have an idea of how to coach/ play? Just a big what if.    That was rather condescending. Not saying I know about coaching at the NHL level, but I do know about coaching people in general as it is part of the program I took in university. I never once questioned the coach in my comment you replied to, I simply stated a fact. Anyway, how do you know the players love him? Because of what they say to the media? I think you should take everything said in the public eye about systems and coaching and their peers with a grain of salt.

You are trying to tell me that everything they say to the media is false. Why? Because I said so and it supports my point. Patches said he loves Therrien and he said he's a ""great coach"". ""It's no wonder so many players are having career years"". See Subban, Pacioretty, Gallagher, Price, Wiese Galchenyuk even. They love to play for him, and the only evidence we have for Patches claims are supportive.   Also you're right about the getting outchanced part. I'm sure the players don't enjoy that but a lot of that is on them, not the coach. It's a group problem. Therrien is 125-64-23 since he started, I don't think he's had a bad three years."

Therrien is 125-64-23 since he started, I don't think he's had a bad three years.   Again, I didn't say anything about the coach. I'm not going to argue about the coach because I have previously made my feelings about him public, supported it with clear cut evidence and facts, and there is no point in repeating myself when the only argument I get in return is ""look at the record""."

Habs,37q3il,Muter91,2,Sat May 30 00:14:48 2015 UTC,"No, not even close to true. A scoring chance is counted when a team shoots from inside the scoring chance area.  Read this for further understanding of the definition of a scoring chance. Something the Habs allow a lot of."

Habs,37q3il,habuheard,1 point,Sat May 30 00:38:31 2015 UTC,"It seemed to me too in a lot of games that MTL would often get just as many quality scoring chances as the other team but often not as many shots on net.  I also remember seeing a lot of great plays throughout the season that would lead to a shot off the post.  Plays like that don't register on the stat sheet but are still very good scoring chances that I would take over 3-4 shots on Price from the perimeter any day.  Obviously, the ""quality"" is not measured in hockey statistics on scoring chances so I understand if you have a different opinion.  Also, I just want to say I would like to see in the future MTL not rely so heavily on Price and improve offensively although I don't think they were as bad or are as far from being good on offense as many people give them credit for considering the defensive system."

I merely invited you have a look at the teams numbers which would in fact suggest it's success is because of Price.  I'm not sure why people get so defensive about that, because it doesn't mean that PK didn't have a great season or the Patches scored fewer goals, but players have good seasons on unsuccessful teams all the time, and without Price putting up the season he did, that's how we'd be discussing those guys right now."

Habs,37oqjl,sith33,12,Fri May 29 05:15:35 2015 UTC,I think they always change it to the logo of the next team they play. It's probably the Habs logo now since we'll play against them on opening night.

Habs,37oqjl,swooneytoad,4,Fri May 29 15:16:15 2015 UTC,"I don't even see Toronto as a team rivalry anymore. I live IN Toronto, so I have to deal with all these SHITTY fans that constantly nag me with ""Montreal sucks"" or ""Leafs are better"" and I can seriously only just laugh in their face about that... which usually shuts them the fuck up. The worst part is, most of these ""fans"" are really just fans of their city and have no clue how the Leafs have been doing the past... 40 years. They are not hockey fans, they are shitty city fans.  Boston fans AND team I hate. I mean... everyone hates Boston's team but no one hates the fans more than we do I believe."

Probably because its too easy to rebuke anyone trying to talk smack when your team is as bad as the Leafs."

And I don't think they care too much either.   Because us and them, we all know the same thing: Carey Price is the real captain of the team, regardless of who wears the ""C""."

He's the most talented player on the team and is relied on heavily. He's been great with the media and motivates by example."
Habs,37nw1r,sith33,3,Fri May 29 03:48:56 2015 UTC,"I 100% Agree. PK plays with such passion and always plays to win. Yeah he has had diving issues, but I dont think that matters. He's a player the fans can get behind and he fires up his teammates to play better."
Habs,37nw1r,LukeImInTheGrass,1 point,Fri May 29 05:10:52 2015 UTC,"Talent is not all that important to be captain. Much more important is the no-quit attitude,  the example you set, and the respect your have from officials. It is hard to top Gally's heart or attitude. I think gally sets the best example and I think he is more of a ""coaches kind of guy"". Gally also doesn't verbally abuse the refs like PK does when he gets penalties called."
Habs,37nw1r,Fenrir,2,Sat May 30 13:55:31 2015 UTC,"Gallagher will not be captain this year. He's got less seniority than at least 4 players and he's not a ""star,"" per se. People need to stop acting like this is going to happen.  Lafleur says dumb things."

I don't use it regularly enough to feel comfortable saying that I'm learning French per se, but I've gotten to the point where if I take my time I can stumble through a French article and get the gist of it.  I would imagine that if I used the app the way you're supposed to (5-10 minutes a day every day, not just sporadically whenever you get bored) I'd be further a long."

Habs,37pllv,SiegeWar,2,Sun May 31 02:13:53 2015 UTC,I live in Richmond/Vancouver  I learned French cause its my family's first language and cause there are full francophone schools here
Habs,37pllv,droche22,1 point,Fri May 29 15:17:40 2015 UTC,"I second slayeryouth ... Duolingo is great. Most importantly, it's free. I learned through Duolingo originally but then took French in college. When starting, I feel that vocabulary holds precedence for Duolingo whereas there is a focus on grammar and structure in a school environment. I personally didn't dive too deeply into Duolingo, so I don't know if a heavy grammar focus comes later, but I do know there are plenty of links to French articles that provides the all-important immersion aspect. There are many members and discussions regarding each lesson and other resources (articles, etc.) ... All-in-all it's a great way to learn French and many other languages. Watching Habs games online on RDS/TVA is great too! Pierre Houde has the voice of a god IMO. Can't say I enjoy TVA as much as RDS, but that's a whole different subject there. Also, french.about.com is a good resource for grammar amongst other things such as verb conjugations, etc. Tip: In my experience, Google Translate is great for getting the point across, but doesn't provide the smoothest translation ever. Grammar and choice of words are often sacrificed for more of a ""you get the picture"" approach. It'd be more appropriately coined ""Google Loosely Translate."" So, take it easy on there! Hope this helped."
Habs,37pllv,bsaures,1 point,Sat May 30 20:28:31 2015 UTC,It was kinda a general question to see what i would get response wise. I think i will give duolingo a shot its free and seems to be pretty popular.
Habs,37pllv,Julien_fucke_bouzzin,5,Tue Jun 2 22:24:29 2015 UTC,"To me, we already have a captain. A real one. He is the best player on the team and in the league, he never or almost never takes a night off and it is Carey Price. The captain that will be named will only be there as an official captain while the true one will be in nets."
Habs,37pllv,franken_BEAANNS,1 point,Tue Jun 2 22:35:34 2015 UTC,I honestly don't think Gallagher will be a good capt. I fucking love the guy (even have his jersey) but he is no captain material.
Habs,37pllv,Kartias,3,Mon Jun 1 22:16:40 2015 UTC,"MY problem with this is that who are we to judge who makes a good captain? How is even the media good enough to judge who makes a good captain? The only people that should decide are the players and coach of the team, which basically live with each other and know who would be best.   The ""he is no captain material"" irks me the wrong way, cause how would you know what it's like and why would you get to decide who is or isn't captain material.   Anyhow, sorry for the rant, I really wanted the rangers to win"

Maybe with Patches, it could change.  Eric Staal would be cool. Acquiring him would be expensive as Hell. The Canes don't have much to go on. They will try to get as much as possible out of any trade.  O'Reilly is one center I hope we stay away from. I'm not sold on him. I don't feel like he's proven to be the player to justify the hard negotiations he held with the Avs."

Habs,37lxlq,Sunjag,6,Thu May 28 18:54:26 2015 UTC,"They might just go with what they have. Subban, Beaulieu, Pateryn and Gilbert all play RD, and are all under contract.  I'd be more happy to see an investment made in a top 6 winger.  And frankly, I don't think Petry will sign in Montreal, another team will offer more money than the Habs can afford, considering the amount the team already spends on defense."
Habs,37lxlq,shiram,9,Thu May 28 16:15:20 2015 UTC,"Beaulieu is a LD, and hasn't re-signed yet."
Habs,37lxlq,Strifezard,3,Thu May 28 16:24:10 2015 UTC,"Right my bad, but that's still 3 guys signed for the RD positions. and they'll sign Beaulieu, he's still a RFA."
Habs,37lxlq,shiram,2,Thu May 28 16:34:53 2015 UTC,"Absolutely he'll be back. Still, that leaves us with:  Markov - Subban  Beaulieu - Gilbert  Emelin - Pateryn  A proven 2nd pairing RD to play with Bulldog would help a ton. Then we can cycle Emelin/Tinordi (if he steps up) - Pateryn/Gilbert. Not saying we go after Green, that would be really expensive, but someone like Cody Franson would be perfect."
Habs,37lxlq,Strifezard,1 point,Thu May 28 16:48:42 2015 UTC,Markov shouldn't be on the first pairing after these playoffs
Habs,37lxlq,SiegeWar,6,Thu May 28 18:02:50 2015 UTC,Beaulieu isn't ready to take over top position yet. Markov is still the best we have for that position right now.
Habs,37lxlq,Strifezard,5,Thu May 28 18:30:15 2015 UTC,"If we keep Petry, he should be on the top pairing"
Habs,37lxlq,SiegeWar,2,Thu May 28 19:20:51 2015 UTC,If only because he'll be gassed by the end of the season playing tough minutes next to Subban.
Habs,37lxlq,thefaber451,1 point,Thu May 28 19:53:19 2015 UTC,"I really disagree that Petry won't resign. He's said his first choice is Montreal and Bergevin has stated his first course of action in the off season is to resign Petry. To not resign him would be crazy, especially with Markov retiring soon. I wouldn't be surprised to see Gilbert or Emelin go soon either so I think Petry will stay in Montreal."
Habs,37lxlq,Razorback101,2,Sun May 31 20:56:20 2015 UTC,"If not Petry (Even though I think hell resign), then Franson would be nice, if not, we have gilbert and pateryn already, and alot of RD depth"
Habs,37lxlq,lurkingisgreat,3,Thu May 28 19:40:10 2015 UTC,"Cody Franson.   We know that MB wanted him last year in the nixed Gorges deal. Wouldn't surprise one bit if he would be plan B for Petry. Plus, you would have to think his stock hasn't got any better with the time he had in Nashville.   One positive that no one has mentioned with regards to signing Petry is that he's American so I believe he can get the reduced Income Tax rate of 10% on the signing bonus portion of his contract. Similar to Kessel's deal with the leafs. It would be a rare case that the Habs wouldn't be at a tax rate disadvantage to every other team, especially the Ref Wings."
Habs,37lxlq,chrislopez_,1 point,Thu May 28 17:24:08 2015 UTC,I have a friend whos a caps fan who says Green always turns the puck over in the defensive zone. I havent watched many caps games.

If Franson isn't an option, then I say we keep the D core as it is. Just give Markov's minutes along side Subban to Beaulieu. Sink or swim, kid. That's the only way he will learn, and he will do it alongside one of the best Dmen in the league."
Habs,37lxlq,Roughly6Owls,1 point,Fri May 29 03:23:59 2015 UTC,"I think the Habs need Sekera or Franson if they can't re-sign Petry, not Green.  Green's going to get a massive contract that I don't think he's worth."

I'm a Mooseheads fan so maybe I'm a little biased, though I do think Fucs is overrated to an extent but this is ridiculous.  It keeps on holding Fucale to ""NHL goaltender"" expectations. He's a 20-year-old playing in a very high scoring league, where he's in the middle of the pack, while this article makes him out to be the worst goalie in the Q.  He did also win a President's Trophy this season, but apparently that counts for nothing. The Rockets are a crazy good team and the Remparts didn't help him out much in this game, either.  He's 20.

Habs,37lawf,televisionceo,32,Fri May 29 13:13:54 2015 UTC,Fucale has the same problem as Price. He lacks the offensive instinct that makes goalies really great. I watched the game and Fucale was indeed pretty bad. He did not take a single shot at the net. HOw do you expect your team to win when you just don't put the efforts ?

Habs,37lawf,KadruH,4,Thu May 28 19:22:22 2015 UTC,"Exactly. All the times I've seen Fucale play, he made awesome saves, looking like the best young goalie out there but letting in softies in the same game. I think he's more of a reflexes goalie, he needs to work on his technique but that's gonna happen in the AHL. He needs time.  His real problem is being short, and you can't do anything about that."

Habs,37hzbq,hkycoach,46,Wed May 27 19:49:17 2015 UTC,I'd be fine with it if it wasn't for the fact that the captain's job is to talk to the refs   And we all know how the referees just LOOOOOVE Gallagher.
Habs,37hzbq,Batmarde,14,Wed May 27 21:22:39 2015 UTC,"The refs are supposed to be both invisible and impartial. If they can't check their personal feelings for player or team X, they're not fit to wear that uniform. Team decisions for who should be their leader should have 0% to do with how the refs will feel about it, because if the refs are doing what they're paid for, it doesn't matter."

I posted it on r/hockey at some point and everyone thought it was a joke, regardless of their flair.  And let me tell you one thing: in order to have the majority at r/hockey to approuve a Habs player is being treated unfairly, it has to be beyond stupidly unfair...  No penalty.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1aaPMslp9Y"

Habs,37hzbq,GibierJaune,20,Thu May 28 11:11:07 2015 UTC,I'd give the C to Max and the As to Gally and Subban.
Habs,37hzbq,GlorifiedHobo,4,Wed May 27 21:27:54 2015 UTC,Can't disagree with that. Max is the guy. Alternates for those who earned it. Gally and Pk.
Habs,37hzbq,Tetembe,5,Thu May 28 02:29:08 2015 UTC,"I agree, giving Gally the C would be a slap in the face to Max. Subban's reputation won't allow him to have the C"
Habs,37hzbq,bearshiit,8,Thu May 28 00:18:12 2015 UTC,"Max is a great player, but he just doesn't seem like a leader to me, Gally goes out and gives his all every single shift, max is absent a lot I find."
Habs,37hzbq,Interwebzking,3,Thu May 28 01:14:55 2015 UTC,"The majority of what the captain does has nothing to do with on-ice play. It's mostly about communication with your team and with the refs. Gally and Subban both have horrible reps with the refs, it could be a bad long term choice to name them captain. People like to pretend refs are held accountable but they're not. Naming Gally captain would cost us dozens of PPs for/against a year."
Habs,37hzbq,MessageBoard,1 point,Thu May 28 09:57:32 2015 UTC,"Honestly though none of the players stepped up this season to lead the team, so if not Gally, Subban or Patches, then who? Chucky, maybe at some point? Markov, Eller?"
Habs,37hzbq,Interwebzking,7,Thu May 28 14:10:27 2015 UTC,I really really love Gallagher put the right choice is still Patches IMO.
Habs,37hzbq,Bohmer,2,Thu May 28 00:52:39 2015 UTC,I feel the same way.
Habs,37hzbq,FakeCrash,19,Thu May 28 04:38:51 2015 UTC,And i gotta say I kind of agree.  Patches is far from a bad choice.  And the same for subban.  But Gallagher has showed repeatedly that he is the hardest worker on the team.  And he shows off when it matters.    But I'm not sure about his relationship with the refs though
Habs,37hzbq,televisionceo,5,Wed May 27 20:09:14 2015 UTC,"You could say that for most players of note, at least on the Habs. If we're letting the refs choose it'd be the 4th liner that gets two minutes a game. Choose who we think is the leader of the team."
Habs,37hzbq,canadiancreed,4,Wed May 27 22:00:15 2015 UTC,"Seriously, Brown is the Kings captain. I doubt the refs like him."
Habs,37hzbq,quadriplegic_cheetah,-8,Wed May 27 23:41:27 2015 UTC,"Subban is a bad choice. He's immature, dives, and gets overly emotional when he really should be keeping his cool (which costs games, goals, and gives him a bad rep with refs). I mean, it seems like he really cleaned up after the Stone slash, but he's going to have to keep it up for a long while before I'd consider him a good candidate.   There is a lot more to being a captain than working hard. I don't understand why nobody seems to get this."
Habs,37hzbq,destroyermaker,9,Thu May 28 00:01:43 2015 UTC,"Currently: Patches > Gally. Eventually I could see him wearing the C, but not right now. And, the refs pretty much hate him anyways."
Habs,37hzbq,xNexx_,11,Wed May 27 22:04:19 2015 UTC,"It's not in his personality. Not yet at least.  And I'm not specifically speaking about this comment, but Lafleur is an idiot. If he says something, that means it's probably wrong."
Habs,37hzbq,LeMAD,15,Wed May 27 20:35:26 2015 UTC,Honest question. How do you know it's not in his personality? Do you know him personally?
Habs,37hzbq,blackleaf2,2,Wed May 27 21:00:26 2015 UTC,"No obviously. But what we see of him in stuff like 24CH, the videos on the Habs website, interviews, etc., he doesn't look at all as someone who other players will rally around*. I don't even mean this in a bad way. He looks like a nice kid, but still just a kid.  *Yeah that sentence is messed up but I'm dead tired and I can't find a better way to say this."
Habs,37hzbq,LeMAD,8,Thu May 28 00:17:20 2015 UTC,Gallagher was captain at junior levels tho.
Habs,37hzbq,SiegeWar,2,Wed May 27 23:13:50 2015 UTC,"I was talking about this with my dad during the playoffs and at the time, I wanted Gally to be captain. My dad brought up a point that kind of swayed me; Gallagher doesn't yet have the respect of the refs and you need it to be a good captain.  And it's true. I say let Markov or Plekanec be captain and give it to Gallagher in a year or 2 when they leave."
Habs,37hzbq,lurkerdontpost,6,Wed May 27 23:02:36 2015 UTC,"If they wanted Markov or Plekanec to wear the C they would have given it to one of them last September. Instead, they chose to name 4 assistants. The run was very clearly between Subban and Pacioretty, and while Subban had a Norris trophy nomination worthy year, I think Pax came out on top of that race this season.   Gallagher is unfortunately slightly too young to be the Captain of this group of guys. His relationship with the referees is not relevant. The referees hated Guy Carbonneau and he is widely recognized as being the last great Montreal Canadiens captain (yeah I know Saku was great too)."
Habs,37hzbq,Ali_knows,3,Thu May 28 02:19:07 2015 UTC,"That 24CH episode where patch and dd are signing autographs at place des arts, and patch says he wants to learn french so he can be more approachable to the fans, is when I knew he won the C race. PK is a strong second but patch seems like he has the lead."
Habs,37hzbq,gypsyblader,2,Thu May 28 02:47:48 2015 UTC,"I heartily disagree with him about Gally (there's a lot more to being a captain than just working hard), but agree entirely about Chucky. I pray they try him at center, with different configurations if need be. He needs support both off and on the ice. Once he gets it, he has the potential to be unstoppable."

Habs,37h6gw,Hoarse-horse,11,Wed May 27 16:35:57 2015 UTC,"I really liked this article. I wonder if the conclusion the author draws is the right one. It sounds possible. I know that the Canadiens organization offers french courses but wonder if they should make languages a higher priority (more mandatory) for those players who may struggle. From a personal perspective, I can understand what the author is getting at as Emelin may not feel as involved in the organization because of the language barrier. If true, the difficulty with communicating affects him socially and professionally. Eventually leading to negative impacts on his life and capabilities as a player. Anyway, just wanted to say that I really liked this article and others the author has done."
Habs,37h6gw,Royal_Flush13,4,Wed May 27 16:40:06 2015 UTC,"I wonder if the conclusion the author draws is the right one.   The overarching premise is the right one. Paraphrased as ""give your players the best chance to succeed by leveraging not only their skills but their personality as well.""   I know that language barriers are an issue with latin and asian players in baseball. And that's in a sport where communicating during a game is much less important (you really only need a few keywords). It can be tough to get comfortable in such a foreign place, and you're much more of an outsider if you can't even communicate."

He’s done a very good job all season long. I’ll let it slide … this time.”  So who was Emelin’s partner in crime who got him the cream pie?  “It’s his comrade, for sure,” Price said. “Marky.”  Andrei Markov wasn’t around to take credit or the blame, not that Price was holding a grudge."

Next time I'll keep it to myself, I guess.   As for Emelin, of course he is struggling. IIRC he wasn't speaking a lick of English when he crossed the pond, and that was 4 years ago. I'm sure he picked up all the game lingo, but to express your own opinions to your coach and teammates while discussing gameplan and set plays must be hard. And to have an accomplished social life it's definitely a struggle, unless he stays within his community. And oddly enough, I think this is sort of a rallying cry maybe in the locker room. Everytime Emelin was injured for a substantial amount of time, the team always struggled on the ice, especially in the playoffs (Ottawa 2013 comes to mind). He's doing a lot of things well as long as you don't put too much on him. He looked really good with Petry out there. The year after their Cup, Boston got a kind of hangover season. When asked by the reporters what changed in the locker room that took the wind out of their sail, Julien said ''We let Shane Hnidy go''. You'll never think someone like that could have such a huge impact on a good team. I suspect a guy like Emelin, with all his communication problems and his play might just have such an impact on the roster. It's fascinating, really."

As for players who are in Europe ( in the case of prospect Arturri Lehkonen ), the team now has four years to put them under contract.  The particularity with Reway is that in leaving Gatineau for Prague he was able to move from being a North American player to an European player . This is at least what said Gerry Johannsson , Office Sports Corporation , which represents the interests of Reway in Canada.   So because of the collective agreement, he's okay for 2 more years!"

And it seems like nobody else agree with you either lol.    stop the bias crap, he had a bad playoff... it's okay to say it!   At this point, I would suggest you to ""stop the bias crap"""
Habs,37frj9,quadriplegic_cheetah,0,Thu May 28 20:05:32 2015 UTC,"This is the Habs thread, no one will ever agree, even though it was plain to see (I remember game 3 vs Lightning how bad he played and yet folks were defending his game...). He's good man, real good, however over hyped... but it's ok buddy, you'll be alright, I shared my opinion, no need to get defensive for your favorite Habbie... you'll get through this!"
Habs,37frj9,Grand_Chief_Mathieu,1 point,Thu May 28 20:24:10 2015 UTC,"This is the Habs sub.. Not the Habs thread. Slight difference.  And ah yes that one game he played bad. Damn that sure reflects his career.  Nah man he's the best defensemen in the league, it's hard to be overhyped."
Habs,37frj9,quadriplegic_cheetah,0,Thu May 28 20:28:20 2015 UTC,ouch... in the league haha... oh and forgive me for using wrong lingo...
Habs,37frj9,Grand_Chief_Mathieu,1 point,Thu May 28 20:34:50 2015 UTC,It's fine!
Habs,37frj9,quadriplegic_cheetah,3,Thu May 28 21:40:56 2015 UTC,"PK stepped up more than Patches did in the playoffs when it mattered. Maybe not in terms of goals, but in terms of plays. I don't know if Max should be the captain anymore either. It should honestly be someone like Gallagher. That's a player that leads by example, gives 110% on the ice every shift, and never quits. That's a warrior, and someone who can spark the team when it's necessary."
Habs,37frj9,JMPesce,7,Wed May 27 17:01:51 2015 UTC,"There's a hell of a lot more to being captain than playing hard. Is that really your only requirement?  I love Gallagher, but he's just not that guy. He's the grindy, in your face, in the trenches guy, not the one nobly leading the charge. And he clearly has no taste for diplomacy - he likes pissing people off. I love that about him but it does mean he's not captain material."
Habs,37frj9,destroyermaker,3,Wed May 27 18:08:03 2015 UTC,But he often is the one leading the charge. He leads by example on the ice. He elevates the linemates he plays with.
Habs,37frj9,JMPesce,5,Wed May 27 18:18:05 2015 UTC,"To be fair, Max was stil injured iirc when he made his return to the lineup. He played both series with a concussion, so you really can't judge his performance without taking that into account."
Habs,37frj9,UltimatePylon,5,Wed May 27 17:09:25 2015 UTC,And he was consistently our best player on the ice in the Tampa series
Habs,37frj9,MTLBroncos,1 point,Wed May 27 17:19:58 2015 UTC,"You're right, there is that to take into account"
Habs,37frj9,JMPesce,1 point,Wed May 27 17:20:23 2015 UTC,"He didn't play with a concussion, he was fully healed. Jesus. He played coming off of a concussion but he didn't play with one."
Habs,37frj9,Muter91,2,Thu May 28 01:08:58 2015 UTC,"Subban is the man for the job. But does he really need that pressure? I know he thrives under pressure, but just let him go play without heaping that extra responsibility on him. He is the best skater on the team hands down, and would handle the job admirably... But the refs have it out for him big time. Maybe captaincy would change that, maybe not. Another aspect is that he is a media darling, which helps his case. Him, or Max, or Plek or Markov, they are all worthy of the job anyway, it is mainly just for show. But my vote is for PK."
Habs,37frj9,Muter91,1 point,Thu May 28 01:14:34 2015 UTC,"To me it's a wash. I'd happily take PK or Max as captain. They both never take a shift off, although even with as few penalties as Max takes, they're almost always bad penalties. While if PK will occasionally take a good penalty, he'll take bad ones too such as for embellishment. Does it impact him talking to refs? Probably some more than others, but chatting with refs isn't as important as being a gamer and a locker room inspiration. There, PK has it over Max, although not by much. I like that they both had a good connection with the Beliveaus and are clearly trying to follow #4's example, although Max looks that role more and more.  So let the players vote and that'll be that.  PS I could see Gally eventually being captain, but not yet."

Habs,37frj9,destroyermaker,1 point,Wed May 27 12:05:19 2015 UTC,"A captain needs to be mature, serious, honest on the ice, and be able to discuss issues with refs without getting emotional. PK posesses none of these qualities. I love him, but he's a goofball and not captain material. Maybe in a few years.  Patches, on the other hand, posesses all of these qualities, and is a hell of a player to boot. It's painfully obvious to me he should be captain."
Habs,37frj9,Mack_Aroni,1 point,Wed May 27 18:03:58 2015 UTC,We could trade him for Toews.
Habs,37frj9,Mack_Aroni,5,Wed May 27 15:02:48 2015 UTC,I wasn't really serious.  I just like Toews a lot.
Habs,37enuc,hkycoach,4,Wed May 27 01:57:21 2015 UTC,I'd love him as captain but I think they'll keep it as 4 assistants for this year
Habs,37enuc,Sharks9,-31,Wed May 27 11:44:19 2015 UTC,He isn't tough enough and he has no sense of self preservation.  He has missed or played injured (limiting his ability and effectiveness) in every playoff run we have had.  We have him at a great price.  But I would never make him captain.
Habs,37enuc,deanresin_,13,Wed May 27 06:02:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that Jamie Benn guy, no sense of preservation. Terrible player, and worst captain. He played injured the whole year too, he won the art ross, but that doesn't matter cause a captain shouldn't play through injuries."
Habs,37enuc,SiegeWar,-27,Wed May 27 06:07:27 2015 UTC,wtf?  who is jamie benn?  and what does he have to do with pacioretty?  did jamie benn also get injured every playoff run and become ineffective?  pacioretty was a fucken coaster in the playoffs.  actually he is just a coaster.
Habs,37enuc,deanresin_,16,Wed May 27 06:10:50 2015 UTC,"Are you illiterate or just a really dedicated troll?   Jamie Benn is captain of the Dallas Stars. He played through the entire season with an injury that required surgery, he didn't stop playing because he is the captain. He kept playing until the bitter end and even won the art Ross. That's what a captain does. They play through injuries for their team. You know what he has to do with Patches? Im using him as an example for the fact a good captain actually plays through injuries to motivate the troops and not to hide.   If Pacioretty decided to play through injuries to try and help the team, then that makes him even more of captain material, not less. You call him coaster yet forget to mention he had 6 goals and was 2nd in points on the team behind only Subban, all this while playing through an injury. You blame our fucking playoff losses on the one guy who actually fucking scored and not all the guys actually doing squat (Galchenyuk, Markov, DSP, Eller). Let me guess, you think Petry sucks and needs to go too? You know what Pacioretty has done that others haven't? Score and play defence. You don't lead the league in +/- by coasting out there. You don't kill penalties by coasting. You don't lead the team in goals and points by fucking coasting. So please get your fucking head out of your ass."
Habs,37enuc,SiegeWar,-37,Wed May 27 07:25:17 2015 UTC,You sound retarded.
Habs,37enuc,deanresin_,24,Wed May 27 07:27:38 2015 UTC,Says the guy who thought Patches was a center

Habs,37e0w8,HammerOfTheSlobs,3,Wed May 27 12:59:36 2015 UTC,That line would get lit up. Especially on the road when the other team has the last change. Only McCarron has any sense of defense and none at the NHL level.  EDIT: Downvotes for saying we shouldn't use 3 unproven rookies as our third line?
Habs,37e0w8,Kuciv,1 point,Wed May 27 13:51:22 2015 UTC,"Well, I did say as a scoring third line, so to your point, perhaps used at home only to avoid getting screwed on the final change."

Habs,37d8h2,hkycoach,7,Tue May 26 19:49:28 2015 UTC,"The 20-year-old had a goal and an assist, forechecked and cycled the puck relentlessly and was one of the standout players of a game the Generals won 5-4 in overtime. It would likely have been a more lopsided score had Fucale not made several superb saves among the 50 shots he faced.   I like the picture this paints of two of our top prospects!"

Habs,37d8h2,TheBlackLight,1 point,Wed May 27 15:22:43 2015 UTC,"So reading through my biggest concern is that it sounds like he's being made into a two-way center, which is something that we have, what we need is an offensive minded center.  Granted it's an interview with an athlete, so you're getting the ""110% everytime.  Yea, they're a great team, we just out played them this time..."" blah blah blah.  But I hope that he can keep his offensive edge in the future."
Habs,37d8h2,TheBlackLight,4,Tue May 26 21:18:39 2015 UTC,Except McCarron has always played like that. Before we drafted him it was always his defensive play and physicality that were getting praise. Him scoring like this just started happening this year. McCarron is never going to be a high offense first line NHL centre. Or at least it's incredibly unlikely. 2nd-3rd line is where he'll slot in and he'll remain a physical two way player.
Habs,37d8h2,Soutael,2,Tue May 26 21:47:12 2015 UTC,"Good info, thanks!  Haven't really kept on our prospects as much as I should have!"
Habs,37d8h2,Tetembe,5,Tue May 26 22:07:59 2015 UTC,"No sweat. Also just cause a guy plays a great two way game doesn't mean he can't score a ton as well. Rick Nash and our own Patches are very good examples of this. I don't think Big Mac will quite reach that level but he could still very well score 20+ goals a year which is great. Like a bigger, way more physical version of Pleks."
Habs,37bter,hkycoach,12,Tue May 26 13:54:55 2015 UTC,"“We complement each other well - Mistele is a hard worker and we both try to get Dal Colle the puck,” he said.  Yet another reason to ensure we have a couple of snipers in the fold by the time McCarron makes the big squad. Having this monster digging pucks out of the corners and feeding them to the slot (or to PK at the point) would be a sight to see."
Habs,37bter,HammerOfTheSlobs,8,Tue May 26 15:08:19 2015 UTC,Imagine him on the right of Patch and Chucky.  drools
Habs,37bter,jo_maka,2,Tue May 26 17:26:36 2015 UTC,"He's 36th in goals (28) and 32nd in points (68). He's 49th in age adjusted points per game (0.71) He's very large, playing against a lot of players who are younger than him.  Let's not get ahead of ourselves. He is not even close to a sure top 6 at the moment."
Habs,37bter,Fenrir,1 point,Wed May 27 03:24:40 2015 UTC,He will.
Habs,37bter,jo_maka,1 point,Wed May 27 04:06:36 2015 UTC,What makes you say that?
Habs,37bter,Fenrir,1 point,Wed May 27 04:13:12 2015 UTC,"Because he fills a need no one else does and he's a quick learner. He's happy just being able to play but on top of the hands and the wheels, he got the frame of a woolly mammoth. Gally grinds, Dutch grinds, they've all been used on top 6 to give space to a more skilled duo. That would be BigMac's calling. He is a powerful garbage man. He digs the puck, protects it well, forechecks hard, decent pass, good stickhandling, and can't be knocked. You get a mix of Lucic and Dutch. You want that kind of player to give your best shooter that extra 1 second to shoot. He's gonna be on a top 6 (unless there is a huge logjam)."
Habs,37bter,jo_maka,3,Wed May 27 04:21:57 2015 UTC,"He's an ok scorer in a much weaker league playing against a lot of players he's older than. Do we really need a grinder on our top 6? Haven't we tried that already? Why not just throw DSP there then? He's big too.  I mean, it'd be great if he could develop a scoring touch that holds up in the NHL, and maybe he will, but there's nothing to indicate that he's a top 6 lock. More likely he's a good 3rd line player."
Habs,37bter,Fenrir,1 point,Wed May 27 05:10:49 2015 UTC,"He has a scoring touch. He's no Kovalchuk, but let's just see how he pans out before we decide he's not worthy, shall we ?"
Habs,37bter,jo_maka,2,Wed May 27 10:22:18 2015 UTC,"Because the Habs and their fans have clearly never overhyped the offensive ability of a developing power forward and completely ruined his development because of it, right?"
Habs,37bter,HanshinFan,1 point,Wed May 27 15:22:08 2015 UTC,"There is hardly any overhype. He is dominating at a landmark tournament. We get to say so because it's the truth. This permanent need to shoot down any optimism is not only useless but also really tiresome. He does have skills. How it will translate after some more development ? We will see. But the real question from me to this sub is: do we know how to be happy ? Do we even like to be happy ? Because nothing good or promising can happen to this franchise without everybody just shitting on it. That's what I'm against.   My thoughts, yours, his, ours collectively wouldn't change the path this kid is gonna take. Us fans ''overhyping'' (if there even is such a notion) have absolutely zero impact on his development. To think otherwise is just intellectual dishonesty.   Give credit where credit is due: the kid is doing things that allow us to think he can be better than most predicted. That's it."
Habs,37bter,jo_maka,1 point,Wed May 27 15:38:11 2015 UTC,No problem.  Can we see how he pans out before we put him on the first line too? ;)

Habs,37bter,LaughingTrees,1 point,Tue May 26 15:31:38 2015 UTC,I'd be suprised if he spend a single game in St-John honestly. This kid is read and has nothing else to learn a this level. He is already responsible defensively and his body will give him a chance to enter Therrien's  system very easily
Habs,37bter,televisionceo,2,Tue May 26 16:00:19 2015 UTC,This kid is read   No. He needs to develop physically. He's a 19 year old boy who plays a very physical game. The NHL is a lot bigger and stronger than the OHL. He will get injured at the NHL level. He needs to be developed.
Habs,37bter,LaughingTrees,2,Tue May 26 16:09:48 2015 UTC,He is already a fucking beast but yeah he should get bigger progressively and progress like chucky right now.  His coach said he is ready he just needs to work on his conditioning.
Habs,37bter,televisionceo,0,Tue May 26 16:22:59 2015 UTC,"If he has to work on his conditioning, he isn't ready.  That's not something he should be working on at the  NHL level."

Habs,37bter,bsaures,4,Tue May 26 16:28:07 2015 UTC,He needs work on his conditioning I think. He still has a lot to learn as well for a guy his size.

Habs,37bter,jo_maka,1 point,Tue May 26 17:25:42 2015 UTC,He has a summer to work hard on that. It's up to him
Habs,37bter,televisionceo,1 point,Tue May 26 17:35:04 2015 UTC,Yeah but I mean it can realistically take more than just a few months also. That's the size of an apartment complex he got to work with. And right now he's a bully with the kids but in the bigs the boys are bigger. He's still gonna be bigger than most but he gotta be able to keep up.  But dear god I can't wait to see him screen a la Chara on the PP...
Habs,37bter,jo_maka,2,Tue May 26 17:38:17 2015 UTC,I genuinely believe he is the kind of player that can jump in the nhl more easily than most.

But it's all good, because we'll end up trading him to Los Angeles for Jordan Nolan so they can go on to win their 3rd cup in 5 years, because we need that character y'know?"
Habs,37bter,Corazu,6,Tue May 26 20:38:07 2015 UTC,Great article. I really think Mccarron will turn out to be a very very good draft pick. I was not sure when we drafted him but I really like what I see from him.
Habs,37bter,televisionceo,4,Tue May 26 14:40:04 2015 UTC,"Even last year in pre-season he looked SO strong. The game he got injured he was playing great, pushing (men)people off him like they were nothing. Not only is he big, but he's a great skater with a low centre of gravity."
Habs,37bter,habsdane,-1,Tue May 26 15:43:25 2015 UTC,He is ready IMO. I don't think he can learn anything from junior or the AHL anymore.
Habs,37bter,televisionceo,7,Tue May 26 15:44:45 2015 UTC,Ahl is a pretty big step up from junior. Everyone played in the A. Make him start there

Habs,37bter,televisionceo,2,Tue May 26 16:44:48 2015 UTC,Well it depends. Chuck isn't the same situation. He skipped the last two years of junior. And that probably wasn't that great of an idea but anyways.  Mccarron should move up to the Ahl then we will see from there
Habs,37bter,fromage1,2,Tue May 26 16:56:28 2015 UTC,It was a good idea because he had nothing to learn in juniors.  He could of used a year in the AHL but he wasn't allowed.

Habs,37bter,fromage1,1 point,Tue May 26 18:56:29 2015 UTC,That's just because Detroit hasn't picked high recently. I guarantee when they pick 3rd overall they'll put their guy straight in the NHL
Habs,37bter,Sharks9,1 point,Tue May 26 20:26:07 2015 UTC,"Depends on the camp. I think one of our young prospect will make the team. Sherbak, Hudon and Mccarron are the favorites IMO.

It really helps on the deployment seeing as they could help on the faceoffs and give them a better defensive acumen. Looks trivial, but I think it's pretty awesome."

He's an amazing athlete and player, with great hockey sense for finding space and an amazing shot (which translates to a high shooting percentage), but he's also not really a possession driver and has really relied on good, playmaking centremen to find him on the ice -- he finds space and uses it well, but he doesn't make space, especially now that he's slowing down because of his age.  If that centreman materialized out of Galchenyuk or a trade or some unexpected third path, then I think Iggy/[whoever] would be an amazing 2nd line behind Pleks/Patches. Until they do (materialize), Iggy would still be an upgrade on the RW, just not one worth 5.3 million."

If we can use him in a package for something sure, but I don't having him around.   PAP is done after this next season too, but his cap hit compared to his contribution and injury history make him someone I'd like to move ASAP. Anything really as we have RW prospects who could fight for his position in the middle or top 6 (Ghetto, Thomas, Scherbak, Reway).  Emelin brings something useful to our team, but not at his term and cap hit. He likely will be hard to move, not only becaus of his NMC.

Habs,37d8m7,zeMVK,1 point,Wed May 27 15:15:23 2015 UTC,"Desharnais, Emelin, Gilbert.  First off, I don't buy the Plekanec rumor. I think Bergevin sees value in him. If anything, I think Plekanec could be moved during the season.  I think Parenteau would be traded during the season. It really depends who Bergevin brings in during the off-season, or if a prospect proves worthy enough. If you bring in a goal scorer, then maybe having a play maker like PAP around may not be so bad if he can rebound from this season's funk and injuries. If you bring another RW or a better play maker, then PAP is gone.  Fucale is doing well in his playoffs, imo. If he's traded it's in a package. I don't see a team desperate enough to trade for Fucale alone AND have it be worth it for Bergevin. Fucale still has some developing to do. I think Bergevin will wait on him. We can agree that Fucale will never be a starter here as long as we have Price. Hopefully, Price isn't injured, traded or leaves on his will. But Fucale may be an safety net if any of those happens to Price. Plus, as awesome as it is to have the best goalie. You can definitely see how some teams mange very well with average goalies but with a good team in front of them.  Personally, I don't see Desharnais in our plans. He's good, but he needs to be  well surrounded, too well imo. This is the type of guy who needs to have two scoring wingers like he did with Patches and Cole. He just isn't 1C for us and won't be unless Bergevin surprises us all with 1st line RW. Add the fact that Bergevin might pull a trade to force Therrien to finally use either Galchenyuk or Eller as a top 2 center. Otherwise, DD shouldn't be a 1C on our team. He doesn't have an albatross contract, so he should be tradable compared to Moen and Bourque.  Emelin really only gets traded if we re-sign Petry. We'll need the cap space. I understand people wanting the LHD and RHD balance, but it isn't an absolute necessity. If we don't re-sign Petry, which would be a shame, then Emelin stays. Also Beaulieu's doing really well.  Gilbert is if in case Emelin isn't traded. Gilbert has 1 season left. We also have prospects pushing into the team, which adds weight even if Emelin is traded."
Habs,37d8m7,axepig,0,Tue May 26 20:25:25 2015 UTC,"There's no way Emelin moves imo, he's our best checker and is actually a best skater (although some of his spins are weird) and he really upped his offensive game this year. MB definitely see him as a piece of the puzzle. I think DD will go but only to make more room in the center position, letting Galchenyuk or a trade/FA acquisition (no idea who we could get but it's a possibility)   Other than our upcoming UFAs like Flynn and Allen and such, I think Prust might leave he didn't have a good year at all imo and he didn't really step up his game in playoff, didn't give much energy and was obviously the worst of the 3rd line"

They still need emelin as markov is getting older and bealieu is nowhere near taking his role. Plek has the most value of the centres and i dont see mb trading two french guys in one offseason

From the 2013 draft only burkoovsky and dano are anything  close to regulars after the first 20 picks. The realistic timeline for a late 1st rounder is 3-4 years.

Habs,375odj,quadriplegic_cheetah,9,Mon May 25 17:33:10 2015 UTC,"We need to establish a number one centre either through Galchenyuk or via trade. A number 1 centre needs to be a priority, you can't win the cup without one. I personally think Galchenyuk could fill this roll with hiccups along the way, but he needs to start at training camp. If not then bring in a top centre through trade. Some targets could be Malkin, Nugent Hopkins, Draisaitl, Thornton. I understand these are potentially huge trades, but these are the type of deals a GM makes to put their hand print on a championship team, I'm not saying it would be cheap but it is possible.  Second issue is a sniper on the RW. We need a guy who can provide a finishing touch on the right side. I love Gallagher and believe he's a great player, even a good first line player, but I think we need a stronger player on the top line RW if we want to win a cup. Some potential targets to fill this via trade are Rychel, Sharp, Eberle, Yakupov, Kessel. Once again this is a tough deal to make, and is easier if Chuckie goes top C. Personally I would love to see Rychel or Kessel (Rychel for the cheap cap hit and potential, Kessel for the fact that the man can score goals no doubt about it), but really i would be thrilled with any trade for a sniper on the wing.  I think our defense is really solid (assuming Petry stays), good enough to be a contending calibre D core and it is only getting better as Beaulieu gets better with each game. Hopefully Tinordi gets on track this year and gets a chance. A top four of Subban, Markov, Petry, Beaulieu is really, really strong.   For a trade to happen we would need to clear space, the most logical options to get rid of are Desharnais and Emelin, maybe Plekanec or Prust. Some of these would be tough losses in the topic but last summer MB moved Gorges so I am confident he will move out whoever he thinks he needs to.   I think McCarron, Hudon, Scherbak all have a shot at making the team next year and all players who have the potential to be impact players in the future. I really hope McCarron looks good at camp because he would be a great player to have in our lineup, he provides a very unique element it's just a matter of him reaching that level. I also can't wait to see Scherbak at the NHL level, whether or not that is this year or next.   Anyways that's what I personally think are our needs, I can't wait to see what this team looks like at Training camp (and then again playoff time)."
Habs,375odj,ClassActDude,9,Mon May 25 06:37:34 2015 UTC,"I agree with everything you said with the exception of dealing Prust. He loves Montreal and Montreal loves him- he is GREAT on the PK, a great bottom six guy who adds toughness, grit, and passion."
Habs,375odj,habsdane,1 point,Mon May 25 13:51:07 2015 UTC,"You're right about Prust, love him as a player. If we were to make a move though he may need to be moved due to his contract. 2.5M cap hit for one more year, I was more or less putting it out there but I could definitely see him moved if we were cap tight."

Habs,375odj,destroyermaker,5,Mon May 25 18:41:08 2015 UTC,I think he is third or fourth on goal at five on five in the league for scoring.  I did not believe Gallagher was underestimated by our own fan base by I'm straying to understand why habseyeontheeprize wrote an article about that.
Habs,375odj,televisionceo,2,Mon May 25 12:57:49 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying he's not a top line, I just think for us to win the cup, we would need a sniper or more elite player on the top line and Gally on the second."
Habs,375odj,ClassActDude,3,Mon May 25 13:19:21 2015 UTC,Well the stats i just quoted is an example of how gally is a sniper. All we need is a decent powerplay and we got a 30 goals per season. What we need is a guy that can do the same on the second line.
Habs,375odj,televisionceo,2,Mon May 25 13:30:21 2015 UTC,"Sniper is more of a playstyle thing than a raw stats thing, is it not?  Gally owns but his goals come from spending time in his office.  I think it matters for the kinds of lines you want to build at the strategies you want to use."
Habs,375odj,themaincop,3,Mon May 25 16:50:11 2015 UTC,"ok OK, well a pure sniper like patches is hard to find and those available often have flaws in other aspects of their game, soemthing gally does not have. So a sniper yes but for the second line. We won't find a better player than gallagher for the first."
Habs,375odj,televisionceo,6,Mon May 25 16:54:16 2015 UTC,"I want mtl to guarantee a job to a rookie  "" we have an opening on the offence and the best forward during the camp will get it"" it involves getting rid of some players though."

Habs,375odj,Powdreams,2,Mon May 25 17:00:22 2015 UTC,"Bring in a good puck moving defence man. This is just my opinion but I find Emelin to have very limited puck moving skills, he mostly just passes it cross ice or through centre."
Habs,375odj,scelement,1 point,Mon May 25 05:50:07 2015 UTC,Emelin is a solid shutdown d however...
Habs,375odj,SiegeWar,2,Mon May 25 07:58:52 2015 UTC,I'm curious why people keep saying this. Both his numbers and the eye test indicate he's not very good.
Habs,375odj,Fenrir,5,Mon May 25 10:34:47 2015 UTC,Ya he looked bad trying to be a shutdown dman when he has to compensate for bad d partners.   His two most common partners were gilbert( who was bought out two seasons  ago because the wild who didnt have a strong blueline to begin with couldnt justify having him on the roster). Remember at the start of the year when they started with markov gilbert and pk emelin? Pk and emelin were great together but within a few weeks markov who never says anything about anyone basically says he is a bad partner and doesnt want to play with him. Markov played with emelin for 2 years and never said anything bad which speaks volumes.  Then his second most common partner was gonchar you know the 40  year old dman who has been a defensive liability for several years now. Try shutting down  top players in the league with a guy who was starting out when mullets were still awesome.  Also notice how there were no problems when he was with pk and again once he had a decent partner in petry all the problems went away? Emelin is a good player you just cant ask him to shutdown top opponents when his partners have proven they cant handle anything close to that
Habs,375odj,bsaures,0,Mon May 25 13:58:02 2015 UTC,"None of what you're saying is really borne out by the numbers.   but within a few weeks markov who never says anything about anyone basically says he is a bad partner and doesnt want to play with him   Do you have a source for this?   Also notice how there were no problems when he was with pk and again once he had a decent partner in petry all the problems went away?   No, I didn't notice that because I don't think it happened? In just about every category, scoring chances, high quality scoring chances, goals, the team did better overall when Emelin was off the ice. His inability to get the puck out of our own end means that we pretty much always do better at driving the play with someone else in his place.  Whatever his defensive abilities, which are nothing special, he's a liability and an expensive one.  Both Gonchar and Gilbert were more positive contributors overall."
Habs,375odj,Fenrir,1 point,Mon May 25 23:56:57 2015 UTC,He's two way actually. But he only needs a solid partner and to stay on his natural side. This year he even pinched more often than PK. Also one of the heaviest wrist shot in the squad.
Habs,375odj,jo_maka,2,Mon May 25 15:46:15 2015 UTC,"Sign Petry, Trade DD, Hire special teams coach."
Habs,375odj,Powdreams,2,Mon May 25 17:02:36 2015 UTC,"This is a really odd spot for MTL. On one hand they had 110 points, made it to the 2nd round.  My 2 main thoughts both pull to MTL needing a top scorer.  1) What if Price doesn't have the GODLY year he had this season. It isn't far from possible that could have been his best season in his career. This doesn't in any way mean he isn't going to be an amazing goalie and one of the top5 (probably top3) in the league for years to come. BUT if he doesn't have that godly season I think you see MTL drop down that position list quite a bit. With so few goals and so many 1-2 goal wins I really think they need to address the RW slot asap.  2) The D isn't going to get better soon. Right now MTL has a good D. With young guys in the works, but also key guys getting older. I felt like Markov really started to show his age in the playoffs. Made some big mistakes and was just seemingly unable to keep up. Now I don't mean 100% of the time he was bad. Just the odd time here and there when he was stuck on a long shift, or caught in a bad spot. This is only going to get worse for Markov and MTL. I don't see any one who can step into his role and make up that gap as fast as he is going to decline. The only thing I can say to this is that Petry is a possible exclusion to this matter. IF MTL can re-sign him, he could be a very good pair for Subban, however leaving an aging Markov to work with some lesser D who can't ""carry"" him as well as Subban has.   This again leads to scoring for me because MTL has the youth in D, it just needs time. And instead of relying on the D and Price as much as they have to keep the game low scoring, a top scorer can help fill that gap by helping MTL have more 3, 4, 5 goal games.   While I am a Sens fan first and foremost I still like cheering for teams close to me, MTL is very close and while I have to hate you when we face off I do want to see success in clubs close by. So I hope that the wizard that is your GM can pull something great off for you guys. With the news that Pits is in the hunt for a 1st rounder, I was thinking the Pleky + 1st (probably something more as well) to Pits for Bennette and maybe Sutter would be a solid trade. Sutter is a very under appreciated centre hidden behind the wall that is Crosby and Malkin and Bennette is a up and coming RW sniper that could really benefit from playing with a guy like Patches. I dunno my 2 pennies!"

Desharnais would make a solid 2nd liner, as would Plekanec (who's only getting older), which tells me that Galchenyuk needs to be shaped into the elite center we all hope he can be. Eller, too, has potential to be conditioned into a 1st liner, albeit more of a grinder and less of a sniper like Galchenyuk could be. That failing, pray there's a top-level-ready center left in the first round by the time we take our pick."
Habs,375odj,BosomsaurusRex,1 point,Tue May 26 04:25:40 2015 UTC,"Not that much, honestly. We had 110 points, made it to the 2nd round, losing to a team that looks like it could win it all.  Sign Petry, or another RHD if he goes to Detroit, and a scoring RW if one's available.  Parenteau should be moved if possible.  I'd re-sign DSP for a couple years. There is a chance, albeit small, that with proper conditioning he develops into a solid power forward, but even if he doesn't, he brings a physical element that we otherwise lack."

Habs,375odj,mmss,7,Mon May 25 12:48:17 2015 UTC,We need some scoring up front though
Habs,375odj,LTxDuke,5,Mon May 25 12:59:48 2015 UTC,"the system is working.   Except for the offense and the powerplay. The roster is in great shape, but deployment and optimization have been an issue for two straight years. DD is not a 1C, and dump and chase should not be a primary strategy with this roster."
Habs,375odj,Royal_Flush13,0,Mon May 25 15:32:25 2015 UTC,"Of course we're missing some pieces, most notably a #1 C, but this thread is about what should Bergevin do this summer, not what wishes we should ask for should we find a genie in a bottle. As Bergevin said, the only way to acquire a big #1 C would be to trade Carey Price. They're a rare commodity.  The strategy, however, seems to be working, seeing that we've been having some pretty good results. I hardly see what could realistically be done to make us better. Changing the system is not an answer. A team that has had the success we've had does not change its system."
Habs,375odj,TurboDragon,2,Tue May 26 00:59:15 2015 UTC,"As Bergevin said, the only way to acquire a big #1 C would be to trade Carey Price.   Yeah, but that was kind of nonsense."
Habs,375odj,Fenrir,2,Tue May 26 01:02:40 2015 UTC,"I hardly see what could realistically be done to make us better   A change in systems, like I said. There is low-hanging fruit to be plucked on the PP, breakout, and zone entry tactics.  I see no reason why they shouldn't reevaluate their systems.  There's loads of evidence that it could improve the team. Youve committed a logical fallacy by saying they shouldn't change it because they've had success with another one, namely Carey Price."
Habs,375odj,Royal_Flush13,2,Tue May 26 01:09:01 2015 UTC,The system is working?  You should look at our underlying numbers man :(
Habs,375odj,Powdreams,1 point,Mon May 25 17:02:04 2015 UTC,"If I were Bergevin I would have already had a serious talk with DSP, and would have set him up with a conditioning coach in the off-season. He's not in horrible shape or anything, but I really think he has a lot of potential that could be unlocked if he were to reach his peak physical condition. If he keeps up the way he is, he'll be an OK player for a couple of years, then forgotten."
Habs,375odj,HammerOfTheSlobs,1 point,Mon May 25 20:17:31 2015 UTC,"I would like something done to fix the power play first.  Lacroix has got to go and be replace with someone who can make your PP decent again.  With Subban who has one of the best point shot in the league, and Patch who is on of the top sniper in the league, plus Markov who is a great set up guy, there is no reason our power play should be this horrible.  If you bring our PP around the 20% mark in the playoffs, our offense would have been very comparable to the other team in the playoffs.  I think we need a fresh start, a new thinking in the PP.  Maybe get a specialist, but as I said, we have all the tools here.  And I'd love for them to try Eller in front of the net on the PP.  I don't think Eller will ever be a play maker, he stil take way too much time to get rid of the puck, but he is big, excellent on 1 on 1, and has decent hands in tight places as we have seen in shootouts.  For the life of me I can not understand they haven't tried him as a winger in front of the net on the PP yet."
Habs,375odj,prplx,0,Mon May 25 13:22:48 2015 UTC,Trade Emelin for anything. Hire a competent assistant coach. Fire whoever is in charge of the power play.
Habs,374qh1,televisionceo,11,Sun May 24 21:28:41 2015 UTC,1st period: amazing period for big Mac.  He got his first goal of the tournament on a deflected shot in front of the net (where he should always be)   He also got a nice pass on the second goal of Oshawa in a 2 vs 1. Overall he was also pretty smart with the puck and seem to win pretty much every battles for the puck he is involved in.    He won most of his faceoffs also  Defensively he is very solid and back a lot to help his defense.    I'll be back after the second

Habs,374qh1,XBM04,9,Sun May 24 22:08:45 2015 UTC,"2nd period: overall,  another very solid period for big Mac.  Not as flawless as the first one.  He mad his first mistake,  in his own zone but it was not a big one.    But still,  what is very impressive is how smart he is with the puck.  He almost always take the right decision.  And his passes are very very good.    He is very involved in the game we saw him asking for the puck a couple of times. We had the chance to witness his slap shot.  He missed the net but he has a powerful slap shot.    His best chance of the period was on an attempt to pass a dman with a skill move.  He did not succeed but did not stopped.  He went on the board right away and got it back to make a sick pass behind him to his teammate."
Habs,374qh1,sex_panther_by_odeon,10,Sun May 24 22:25:14 2015 UTC,Just an aside. Does anybody else see a terrifying resemblance to Jason Segel with Big Mac?
Habs,374qh1,quadriplegic_cheetah,3,Mon May 25 03:44:34 2015 UTC,Third period : not big mac's best period. He did not seem as involved in the game and was a bit careless in the first part of the period.   He got better in the second half and made a quite impressive coast to coast play. Surprisingly good skater for his size.   He was used on the pk unit for the first time of the night. Not really his fault but the rampart scored in the first 15seconds.  He looks very tired at the end of his shifts.  He really need to work on his conditioning like some others said.
Habs,374qh1,kozed,3,Sun May 24 23:17:23 2015 UTC,He's been great. Probably the best player on the ice. Only thing is his speed and cardio don't seem to be great
Habs,374qh1,felixthecatmeow,7,Sun May 24 23:53:54 2015 UTC,All he needs is a power skating coach and Gary Roberts boot camp and he can be our Lucic.

Habs,374m9q,Cynepkokc,3,Sun May 24 22:04:01 2015 UTC,"A little of both. He totally has/will get to the size of a 3rd liner. Which is fine because most, if not all, scouts going into that draft had him listed as a 3rd liner with some offensive upside that can kill penalties. Basically the definition of a safe pick. Similar to what the Leafs have in Frederik Gauthier minus the offensive touch (in Gauthier, that is)."
Habs,374m9q,jo_maka,3,Sun May 24 22:08:12 2015 UTC,"I think Freddy G is a Jumbo Joe with a shutdown flair. People kept bitching about him in the WJC but on the last game he owned the last 10 mn like it was going out of style. Love the kid :)  BigMac is more a Lucic mixed with maybe a Vanek flair (but not as high a ceiling): garbage man through and through but looks to become one of the best at it. He got hands and wheels, puck protection and mean streak. If used on top 6 with a dynamic duo, he's gonna give them tons of space to play with and can finish up close. Much like how Lucic makes Krecji look so good."
Habs,374m9q,quadriplegic_cheetah,3,Mon May 25 01:48:57 2015 UTC,Great breakdown.
Habs,374m9q,axepig,3,Mon May 25 02:36:27 2015 UTC,Everyone over rates their prospects. Personally I see him as a 2nd/3rd line split.

Habs,3721so,pm27,2,Sun May 24 20:39:18 2015 UTC,"I see what you mean. I heard something like that about Scherbak when he was in Saskatoon last year. Hard to say with the juniors though. When the team is not offensively stacked, some coaches would actually draw thsse type of plays to get the most out of their only scoring threat. I don't know if that's what's happening with Sprong though."
Habs,3721so,jo_maka,2,Sun May 24 20:59:38 2015 UTC,"I know the Isles coach kept telling Sprong not to be a human highlight reel every time he touched the puck.  Don't get me wrong, Sprong has so much potential, but he needs to play smart and not take so many Subban like risks."

Habs,3721so,Gabroux,4,Sun May 24 03:44:45 2015 UTC,Boeser
Habs,3721so,XBM04,3,Sun May 24 14:34:08 2015 UTC,Better stats than Patches in the USHL. That doesn't really mean much but it's something. His dad has Parkinsons disease and his close friend died and three other friends were seriously injured in a car accident.. seems to have that character that MB preaches. http://www.nhl.com/ice/draftprospectdetail.htm?dpid=98461
Habs,3721so,Muter91,2,Sun May 24 04:14:00 2015 UTC,"I'm hoping for defense, so Kylington if he's around at 26th, or Zboril, who just so happens to be a Habs fan and lists Subban as his favourite player, so there's that.  For forwards, I like how Conner and Greenway look. Big forwards who can score."
Habs,3721so,TurboDragon,4,Sun May 24 04:40:30 2015 UTC,"How about Jacob Larsson? Seems similar to Kylington, maybe a little less talented in the offensive zone, but has better chances of being available when we draft, as he's rated in the 25-30 range."
Habs,3721so,brockblaze,2,Sun May 24 03:24:34 2015 UTC,"Connor will likely be gone in the first half of the first round, if he somehow falls to 26th he could be the biggest steal of the draft."
Habs,3721so,TheBlackLight,4,Sun May 24 07:55:45 2015 UTC,I think Connor will only be taken if Kylington and Zboril are already taken. They both play the style that MB likes and when Tinordi makes the roster the only D prospect with NHL potential is Lernout(who is still only 18/19 years old).  Though to be honest I feel as though all three will be gone by 26.
Habs,3721so,jo_maka,1 point,Sun May 24 17:21:56 2015 UTC,"You gave up on Thrower ? The last 2 years have been rough for him, sure, but Dman are tricky. Most of them have a 3-4 years ETA when they're not late bloomers or have bad luck injury-wise. But yeah, underwhelming. I think Didier might become a good surprise soon too."
Habs,3721so,CarelessPotato,1 point,Sun May 24 03:50:43 2015 UTC,"And Thrower has become lost in our depth of RHD (Lernout, Didier, Nygren, Dietz, Ellis). There is definitely some hope, he was the highest pick among those listed, and some of those listed may not be around much longer)"
Habs,3721so,jo_maka,2,Sun May 24 14:58:22 2015 UTC,No way the Sens pass up the possibility of having Kylington playing with EK
Habs,3721so,bsaures,-1,Sun May 24 16:37:55 2015 UTC,Why would they want kylington to play with EK that would be a beyond stupid decision. Two undersized offensive dman going up against top lines they would get destroyed  nightly
Habs,3721so,jo_maka,2,Sun May 24 12:48:47 2015 UTC,"That pairing is a powerplay coach swede wet dream.  Also, how often have you seen EK get destroyed ?"
Habs,3721so,bsaures,-1,Sun May 24 14:17:28 2015 UTC,First half of this season pretty much  every  game. He showed that without a  very good defensive dman he costs his team way more than help
Habs,3721so,jo_maka,1 point,Sun May 24 14:45:01 2015 UTC,"Methot anchored him, sure. But Kylington is not Cowen. Tell me you feel good seeing EK and a less tall OEL on the powerplay. Their offense from D is exclusively on the right with EK and Ceci. Kylington is too good to go past 20. Let alone 26."
Habs,3721so,quadriplegic_cheetah,2,Sun May 24 14:55:32 2015 UTC,"From what I've heard Zboril sounds like an interesting pick, Kylington would be awesome as well."
Habs,3721so,bearshiit,1 point,Sun May 24 15:03:39 2015 UTC,"Zacha will be a stud, but no way Habs get him"
Habs,3721so,Cynepkokc,1 point,Sun May 24 04:53:39 2015 UTC,"What about Dylan Sprong? Goal scoring forward RW. Isnt that what we need? Everytime I hear about Sprong he seems like a High risk/High rward type of player. Always scattered on the draft rankings, why not? Unless Zacha, Korostolev, or Svechnikov are available. They probably have a more accurate and reachable ceiling than Sprong."
Habs,3721so,quadriplegic_cheetah,3,Tue May 26 06:36:35 2015 UTC,"Why are we stalking up on right wings? McCarron was drafted as a RW and is on his way, and we have Sherbak who has top 6/first line potential as a RW. AND we have Gallagher and Smith Pelly down the right. Makes no sense. And that's not even factoring in vets like Wiese and PAP."
Habs,3721so,jo_maka,1 point,Sun May 24 04:09:34 2015 UTC,"Hudon, Bozon, Lehkonen, Reway, DLR are all C/LW. BigMac is having a good stint at C also.   If anything, we're short on RW."
Habs,3721so,quadriplegic_cheetah,0,Sun May 24 04:52:54 2015 UTC,"McCarrons been playing RW for 50+ games now. We have 4+ RW's at the age of 23 or younger who will be in the NHL in 2-3 years.  Smith Pelly as a bottom 6 forward.  Gallagher as a top 6 forward. Sherbak as a top 6 forward.  McCarron as a top 9 forward.   And we have two veterans in PAP and Wiese. We don't need more RW's there are already 4 developing/on their way. Why on earth would we draft the same position 3 years in a row.  And I haven't even mentioned Andrighetto or Thomas. We are very deep at RW, it's not happening."
Habs,3721so,jo_maka,3,Sun May 24 06:28:49 2015 UTC,"PAP is on the way out. Some of those kids will be trade package chips. If RW is BPA, you go with it. I'd love to get a LD with a high ceiling because we're starting to run low on those, but IMHO those remaining at the end of the first could be ""safe"" 2nd rd type whereas the forward group seems really deep this year. So, RW or LW, I really don't mind. We had Theo when we drafted Price. We have Price, still drafted Fucale. We have Eller, drafted Rosie. We had Markov when we drafted Beaulieu. We flipped Collberg before having PAP and Weise and DSP even when we knew Gio was on his way out. We had PK and Thrower and Pateryn and Dietz and Nygren, still traded up to get Lernout (and after that, MB went to get Gilbert AND Petry that he'd want to lock down long term). Never factor in the immediate roster when drafting. Always go with the best."
Habs,3721so,quadriplegic_cheetah,1 point,Sun May 24 07:05:06 2015 UTC,"You're mentioning vets though. Nothing wring with drafting Beaulieu when we have Markov, or Rosie when we have Eller. They are almost 10 years apart. Same with Theo and Price and Price and Fucale. That's just smart drafting. Drafting a RW three years in a row when we have 5 RW's under the age of 23 all with NHL potential however is not a smart move.  Sherbak Gallagher McCarron Smith-Pelly Andrighetto  Why just add to that? We could be filling an actual need on our team.  I agree though, always draft the best possible player."
Habs,3721so,jo_maka,1 point,Sun May 24 12:10:34 2015 UTC,"Because he can move any of those if he can get an upgrade (although Mac and Scherby won't go nowhere).  Edit: By my count, after PK we had 4 RD prospects and we still traded up to get Lernout."
Habs,3721so,quadriplegic_cheetah,1 point,Sun May 24 19:46:47 2015 UTC,"Which is just a waste of time, we've drafted two NHL RW's in the last two years in the first round. People are always complaining about our RW depth meanwhile it's our deepest prospect position. Wait 1-2 years and it will be fine.   We have one LW on our roster and one legitimate LW prospect in Hudon. Let's draft a Lw."
Habs,3721so,jo_maka,1 point,Sun May 24 19:49:25 2015 UTC,"Nothing is a waste of time. You draft BPA. You keep if it fits in your plan, you trade for a bigger piece if it doesn't. Settle down, this one draft is not gonna make us a contender overnight. I'm rooting for Svechnikov who is a LW. If he's not there, I'll take the next best thing. End of story. Nothing to fret about. It's not like we're picking top 5."
Habs,3721so,quadriplegic_cheetah,0,Sun May 24 19:55:57 2015 UTC,"I agree 100%. But everyone complains about our RW depth. It's twice as deep as our LW depth. Hoping for Svechnikov as well, or a d man. Time to replenish."
Habs,3721so,Muter91,3,Sun May 24 20:11:27 2015 UTC,"McCarron has been playing center for one and a half seasons now, actually."
Habs,3721so,quadriplegic_cheetah,-1,Sun May 24 22:04:24 2015 UTC,He's been playing RW since his return to Oshawa. So 50+ games.
Habs,3721so,Muter91,5,Sun May 24 16:44:37 2015 UTC,"Mmm not as far as I can tell. He has been playing center all playoffs for sure, as I've been watching the games."
Habs,3721so,quadriplegic_cheetah,1 point,Sun May 24 19:42:48 2015 UTC,"I think he's being moved back and forth. I've heard both, but hey you've probably watched more than me. Still though, his position in junior doesn't guarantee his position in the pro's."
Habs,3721so,Muter91,1 point,Sun May 24 20:07:18 2015 UTC,I think the Habs want him in the middle. He is MB's wet dream.
Habs,3721so,jo_maka,1 point,Sun May 24 22:06:12 2015 UTC,I can't see Zacha drop to 26. No russian factor for him. Korostolev and Svechnikov could drop a la Barbashev & Scherbak (fingers crossed).
Habs,3721so,BuddhasLittleWarlock,0,Mon May 25 03:13:26 2015 UTC,"Well yeah, Zacha is Czech."
Habs,3721so,jo_maka,2,Sun May 24 04:51:00 2015 UTC,My point exactly
Habs,3721so,BuddhasLittleWarlock,0,Sun May 24 13:43:26 2015 UTC,Is there a 'Russian Factor' if they're playing in the CHL though?
Habs,3721so,jo_maka,2,Sun May 24 14:06:32 2015 UTC,Scherbak - Goldobin - Barbashev.....  Definitely
Habs,3721so,BuddhasLittleWarlock,0,Sun May 24 14:12:12 2015 UTC,Doesn't make sense to me.
Habs,3721so,jo_maka,1 point,Sun May 24 14:44:00 2015 UTC,To me either. But I like that other teams are being dumb about this. I really hoped for Scherbak last year I'd say at least 2 months and a half before the draft but I thought we'd never get him. The kid is a top 15 talent minimum.
Habs,3721so,Placowdepuss,0,Sun May 24 15:02:22 2015 UTC,"The whole ""Russian Factor"" concept is utter bullshit though. I'm pretty sure /u/jo_maka was going for a sarcastic joke about the idiots wo believe it."
Habs,3721so,BuddhasLittleWarlock,1 point,Sun May 24 15:09:22 2015 UTC,"Well, I mean, it was sort of accurate for Emelin. We drafted him in like, '04, and he only came over two years ago. And Kuznetsov was the Caps pick in like, '09. The Russian Factor to me isn't if they're going to come, but when."
Habs,3721so,Placowdepuss,2,Sun May 24 14:08:01 2015 UTC,"The thing is that people think of it as an attitude problem. If you were offered more money to take a job in your hometown than oversees, why would you move? Sure the company is more prestigious, but you have to restart your whole life. This makes sense, and it can apply to any European player (but mostly the Russians, because the KHL has higher salaries). The problem is that people alsso extend the Factor to Russian players who went to the CHL (like Scherback), which is just beyonf bigoted and stupid, because they've already demonstrated in spades their intention to play in the NHL."
Habs,3721so,BuddhasLittleWarlock,1 point,Sun May 24 14:11:08 2015 UTC,Agreed.
Habs,3721so,bsaures,1 point,Sun May 24 14:16:06 2015 UTC,Emelin just finished his 4th season with the team it hasnt been only 2. And also a much bigger factor in him taking  so long  was that they didn't have a spot for him so why come to play in  hamilton  for significantly  less  than the khl with little chance of a callup
Habs,3721so,BuddhasLittleWarlock,0,Sun May 24 14:20:31 2015 UTC,"So, you're saying that Emelin could not have cracked our lineup over a guy like, say, Hamrlik?"
Habs,3721so,jo_maka,2,Sun May 24 14:43:33 2015 UTC,I think it was mostly because the contract we had were hard to trade away.
Habs,3721so,bsaures,0,Sun May 24 14:59:29 2015 UTC,No im saying that he never would have even had a chance to. Rememver this was the first full year of pk then you  had markov spacek hamrlik gill gorges then wisnewski and sopel and mara at the time one of the  deepest  dcores in the league especially on the left side
Habs,3721so,jo_maka,0,Sun May 24 15:05:58 2015 UTC,"Well, I believe the factor is more about NHL mgmt being too damn frisky and just discarding good prospects due to a very very flimsy reason. And I'm happy Mtl doesn't buy into it. Zacha is czech so he won't be affected. Even if several nationalities play in the KHL, I find it incredibly idiotic that NHL brass would target russian players with this bias."
Habs,3721so,Placowdepuss,1 point,Sun May 24 15:19:06 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Case in point is Nikita Scherback, who I'kmso damn excited for."
Habs,3721so,BinaryChode,0,Sun May 24 14:42:45 2015 UTC,Center
Habs,3721so,tattlerat,1 point,Sun May 24 14:45:56 2015 UTC,I agree. A big strong center that we can develop would be fantastic.

He was a little undisciplined but man he was built like a brick shit house. His hits were huge and there was no moving him out of the way. I'm excited to see what he can bring to the Habs."
Habs,3710c7,DiabloCenturion,4,Sat May 23 22:09:58 2015 UTC,Fellow Kingstonian? What's up!
Habs,3710c7,Backfire16,5,Sun May 24 01:22:15 2015 UTC,There's dozens of us!
Habs,3710c7,Sherlawk,3,Sun May 24 04:01:16 2015 UTC,"Just watching this game, he should be a good 3rd liner in 2 to 3 years."
Habs,3710c7,bsaures,6,Sat May 23 22:15:33 2015 UTC,I have watched him play about 20 games this year both in london and oshawa (thanks to lots of travel and snet has shown quite a few of the gens games) . When he was with london he was in a bit more of a offensive role getting time with domi and they were dominant complimenting each other very well (mccar9n gave domi all kinds of space and he made teams pay big time) I was really surprised at the time he didnt even really get a chance for the us team and they could have used him as he had gone up effectively against many of the top players in the tournament. Of course while the tourney was on he ripped it up in a couple games befow the trade.  For oshawa he has played a much more defensive role but even with that has still put up food numbers. He is kinda playibg the plekanec role except he is 6'6 and likes to beat the crap out of people.   Overall he has developed a  very complete game and should be at worst a shutdown 3rd liner in the nhl but with our strong playmakers he could compliment our top 6 well
Habs,3710c7,televisionceo,1 point,Sat May 23 22:49:37 2015 UTC,"In the game happening right now, I have been pleasantly surprised by his passes. Lots of long passes.. little disappointed in his shot."
Habs,3710c7,bsaures,1 point,Sat May 23 22:57:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah,  even during the camp it was obvious that his shot is his weakness.  But he can pass,  surprisingly"
Habs,3710c7,televisionceo,1 point,Sun May 24 14:10:05 2015 UTC,I have seen his shot better but given the time of the year he may not be  100 percent players rarely  are
Habs,3710c7,Muter91,3,Sat May 23 23:33:23 2015 UTC,I'm going to see him today.  I'll pay attention and give you my impression
Habs,3710c7,thawizard,1 point,Sun May 24 14:08:37 2015 UTC,He is a beast along the boards. He wins a lot more face offs than he loses. A LOT. Wicked shot but needs some time to get it off. Needs to work on his skating and agility and conditioning.
Habs,3710c7,coolkeeper1,1 point,Sat May 23 23:56:20 2015 UTC,"Considering that with London he was used as an offensive player and had amazing stats and that with Oshawa he's a defensive player with almost a PPG, I'd say he's doing pretty good. I watched the game against Rimouski today and he was okay. He got a point, he fought but also had a bad turnover that became a goal for the Oceanic. Considering his face-off performance, I'd give him a 7/10 rating for tonight."
Habs,3710c7,coolkeeper1,1 point,Sun May 24 04:24:32 2015 UTC,"Went to game 6 of the Generals-Battalion series which happened to be my first hockey game live. I was excited to  see him live and one of the first shifts he gets hit in the corner and dives and he got a penalty for it, 2 minutes go by he gets out of the box and immediately takes another penalty so I thought to myself I sure hope he is more disciplined with us.  Other then that he obviously is big and can work the boards/corners well and he was faster then what I thought he would be, I could see him turning out to be a great 2nd or 3rd line Power forward in few years."

Habs,36s5aq,shiram,13,Thu May 21 19:11:33 2015 UTC,"To me the Habs rivalry is the Bruins and that is it.  The Leafs rivalry is mostly media driven. Historically, the Flyers were more of a rival team than the Leafs also."

The Leafs at this point still aren't relevant.  Phaneuf is still their #1 D.  Kessel will be Kessel.  It remains to be seen what impact Babcock will have.  They might be better.  But they'll still fight for a playoffs spot.  Babcock is a great coach, but let's not forget Holland is one if not the best DG in the league and provided him with a good team year after year."

I bet leaf fans will even tell you that.  This organization hasn't won in decades and has been a complete embarrassment for many years.    The idea that the leafs are Canada's teams comes from MLSE who are the puppet masters that control the horribly biased and egocentric sportsnet , CBC and TSN."

The whole thing before the draft definitely  didnt help and likely  closed some doors but the reality was even as a straight player he would have been in tough to  make it.
Habs,36v9it,mollarirulz,1 point,Tue May 26 15:28:27 2015 UTC,"Doug Flutie is not gay.  He was not seen as an NFL 1B cause of his size.  I think he proved them wrong, but was never on a team that could get to the Super Bowl.  In michael Sams case, he was drafted and given a chance bc of his sexuality.  He was drafted by the Rams and then picked up by the Cowboys.  He was cut by both teams.  He is undersized as defensive lineman.  If he is fast enough, he could be successful.  Since CFL field is wider, players are lighter, but their speed helps them cover the extra ground."
Habs,36sxuc,FakeCrash,18,Thu May 21 21:30:30 2015 UTC,"Yea, people seem to mistake first-line with elite player. We have an elite player in Patches and potential elite in Chucky. Gally is a very good first-liner, but yea, not on the level of Patrick Kane, and yea, if Kane was on our team, he would be on the second line, and yea, if we had Marian Hossa, Gally would play on the third line.

I think the current league is so tight that a player's performance will be better gauged in retrospect.  Now, don't get me wrong. I am not saying their numbers being retired is probable by any stretch, but possible? Sure. Gallagher is young, you never know what he could accomplish... Who would have guessed two years ago that he would be a legit 1st line RW? Granted his style of play doesn't exactly scream long-term sustainability, but there is something about him that makes me wonder if he won't just continue to raise eyebrows.  Patches has an even better chance, but even with him it would take a cup and a jump in production.  Not impossible!"

Habs,36sudc,sex_panther_by_odeon,7,Fri May 22 00:23:50 2015 UTC,"Marc Bergevin needs to add some offensive fire power to help out Max Pacioretty, but trading away his first round pick in one of the deepest drafts in the last decade seems like an unusual move for him.   It sure doesn't sound like a Bergevin move. Then again, I've been pretty happy with his trades. He might feel he's getting something good enough in return enough to trade it. Oh boy! It had better be a big fish.  We currently have a 1st, 3rd, Avs 5th, 6th and 7th round picks for this year's draft. If we trade that 1st, we don't have much left unless we're getting picks in return. It would be a shame to pass on such a deep draft pool.   and the announcement would be made in the coming weeks.     I've said my piece on these rumors before. And I still refuse to believe them and think this is just bullshit. I understand that trades can take time to work out, especially such a big one that would include Plekanec and our 1st. But it still sounds to me like this rumor is giving itself an excuse for it not happening.  Edit:   Cette transaction là ressemble beaucoup à l'échange Halak, complétée avant les séries mais annocée après...   What? I don't remember hearing anything about Halak's deal being made before the playoffs, then announced after."
Habs,36sudc,zeMVK,1 point,Thu May 21 21:38:03 2015 UTC,"I really don't check the rumor sites enough, and especially not in 2010. Did you pay a lot of attention to DansLesCoulisses back then?

Habs,36sudc,Kartias,1 point,Thu May 21 22:03:47 2015 UTC,"Well, I've always closely followed the team. I usually remember things like these. I don't remember danslescoulisses from back then though to be honest. There was a lot of discussion after the playoffs over Price vs Halak. But I don't ever remember anything about reports of the deal being made during or before playoffs."
Habs,36sudc,zeMVK,1 point,Thu May 21 22:16:19 2015 UTC,"I think that plenty of rumors would be going around at that time, and anyone would just assume them all the be false because it is so easy to make up with one of them sure to leave. The Pleky one is strange because it is so unexpected, and it really draws attention for being special.  And honestly, when a trade is made, no one cares about when it was first announced in general."
Habs,36sudc,Kartias,1 point,Thu May 21 22:25:06 2015 UTC,"Yea, I kind of agree. Though I think the rumor is well timed. Every post-season, fans have been split on Plekanec. Some expecting him to score more, while the others saying he's on top opponent line shutdown duty. If anything, this post season has sparked more of that. Throwing a trade rumor around Plekanec definitely does not look out of place if you ask me, because at the very least, you're going to attract a lot of attention for such a rumor."
Habs,36sudc,zeMVK,1 point,Thu May 21 22:32:22 2015 UTC,"Is it that deep though? Despite the promising first round, how do we know it's a deep draft pool?"
Habs,36sudc,Staks,2,Thu May 21 22:29:20 2015 UTC,"Reports and most people are saying it's very deep. Obviously, it's a draft, so you might end up with a dud. I trust Timmins as he's been more successful rather than not so far.  We'd be very limited on picks if we trade our 1st for no picks in return."
Habs,36sudc,zeMVK,2,Thu May 21 22:37:52 2015 UTC,"Especially since we don't have a 2nd rounder (Petry deal).  Maybe this is a move for a younger player (19-22 yrs old), which would somehow alleviate the loss of a pick... But I can't see how anyone like that would be available.  Like someone said: maybe Chiarelli wants a C like Plek to help with tough minutes and doesn't see a need to have Nuge and McDavid on the same team."

Then again I wasn't there much for this season as I was in years past. It took forever to load a page since they upgraded the hamsters running their site and I started going less often, so I might have missed some stuff.

Habs,36sudc,quadriplegic_cheetah,2,Thu May 21 22:08:41 2015 UTC,HUGE no. Good yes.   Yak or Ebs are more than likely the key piece.
Habs,36sudc,peskysens,3,Thu May 21 23:08:51 2015 UTC,"Plekanec and a first for Yakupov alone seems a bit much. It's not as if Yakupov has earned being considered a top line RW yet. He's got potential, I'll admit. But so far, it is not nearly a sure thing. Maybe Ebs."
Habs,36sudc,zeMVK,1 point,Thu May 21 23:47:14 2015 UTC,Oh for sure. If it is yak there is something else coming back. A 2nd or something. No way it's straight up.
Habs,36sudc,peskysens,2,Thu May 21 23:56:24 2015 UTC,If that's true then we're getting something HUGE coming back   Chara to Montreal Confirmed.

Habs,36sudc,hkycoach,6,Fri May 22 21:59:29 2015 UTC,"It really looks like this could be a trade with Edmonton. They are still ""rebuilding"", thus can use a first round pick. Plus Plekanec would be a really good center to help McDavid get into the league, being pretty good at pretty much everything, especially for the defensive game that they would want McDavid to develop.  Trade target: I am really hoping for Yakupov. Like really really hoping we get him. I doubt they would trade Hall, and I personally don't like Eberle all that much, especially for his price. Yak is going to explode, especially on a line with Chucky and Scherbak, or at least that'd be my hope.  This dreamin is fun."
Habs,36sudc,Kartias,3,Thu May 21 21:38:08 2015 UTC,"I don't know. Edmonton has plenty of up and coming centers: Hall, Roy, Nugent-Hopkins (who is used at the wing iirc), Draisaitl and soon to be McDavid?  I don't see Edmonton wanting to add another center. Didn't Roy like it there as well? I don't really see Edmonton trading for Plekanec just so he can be a rental and teach their young centers.  Edit: Whoops forgot Hall was a LW.   Edit: Yea, okay, maybe. Roy is an UFA. And I remember Oilers saying Draisaitl being too young and not ready. Maybe. Plekanec could be a good 2nd C for them. I still think Oilers will put priority on defense though. Which they can get through the UFA market with Franson and Green, when you take in account all the cap space they have.  Edit: Plekanec and 2015 1st is a bit much for Yakupov alone though."
Habs,36sudc,zeMVK,1 point,Thu May 21 21:49:56 2015 UTC,"Force them to take Emelin? :P  (I don't actually hate Emelin, I just want both Tinner and Beaulieu up with the big club)  But yea, their center lineup is RNG(but he's mostly winger), McDavid, Draisatl and maybe Roy. If they get Pleky and trade Yakupov, I doubt they keep Roy as he was good for them because he brought Yakupov to have a really nice end of season.  Anyhow, I mostly dream of this for the storyline of bringing back the junior duo back together, and who doesn't like a nice storyline!  Still, all just fun speculation on what is possible and could be fun! We could also get our 4th and second round picks back from the Petry trade."
Habs,36sudc,Kartias,8,Thu May 21 22:01:55 2015 UTC,"Personaly, I would trade Tinordi before Emelin. I feel that he's way underated in this subreddit while Tinordi proved nothing"
Habs,36sudc,Gabroux,0,Thu May 21 22:06:29 2015 UTC,"Yea, I've seen this opinion a few times. I feel like Tinordi has decent vision and can dish out the puck pretty well, at least from what I have seen. His size is also a big asset that can't be overturned, especially since he really isn't slow for being so tall. I really believe Tindordi can be a great top 4 defenseman, while I see Emelin as a very decent bottom 2 D, at least for what I want our team to be."
Habs,36sudc,Kartias,3,Thu May 21 22:11:34 2015 UTC,"Thing is, Emelin does have value even though he didn't have such a great season. I can see him being traded. Most certainly not for Yakupov straight up, but in a package, sure."
Habs,36sudc,zeMVK,-1,Thu May 21 22:20:45 2015 UTC,"Draisaitl for Plekanec a D prospect and a first.   Plekanec develops the youth in McDavid and Nuge to be even better, and then slots in nicely as a two-way third liner considering he's aging.  They can then run McDavid- Nuge - Plekanec down the middle. Which is terrifying, and then they make use out of Drai's value by trading him for defense and a prospect and replace him with Plek.  We get a first line centre and now we have Galchenyuk and Draisaitl who can play with Pacioretty and Gallagher."
Habs,36sudc,quadriplegic_cheetah,1 point,Thu May 21 22:07:13 2015 UTC,"That's a bit steep for a center who has played very few games in the NHL though. I can understand Draisaitl may have plenty of potential. But he's yet unproven. Plekanec, D prospect and a 1st? The big upside for us is that we'd get a young and potentially good center, all the while freeing 5 mill off the cap space. I have my reservations if it's only Draisaitl. It could work out great. But it would look like a huge flop right now, imo."
Habs,36sudc,zeMVK,1 point,Thu May 21 22:18:34 2015 UTC,"I agree, but I don't think he'll flop. He's tearing it up right now in the playoffs.  You have to give up quality to get quality."
Habs,36sudc,quadriplegic_cheetah,2,Thu May 21 22:35:39 2015 UTC,"Hmm. Well, that can be interesting in that case. I don't know if Chiarelli would be tempted to trade a young center tearing it up as a new GM for the Oilers. Especially after trading Seguin. He probably would like to take that one back. haha"
Habs,36sudc,zeMVK,2,Thu May 21 22:41:32 2015 UTC,"He could end up with a Pittsburgh situation if not though. Where you have Jordan Staal playing 3rd line C and not living up to his potential because he plays 12 min a night. He has to show smart asset management, and trading away a surplus for something they are lacking (defensive prospects to play with Nurse) and veteran leadership could be a smart choice."
Habs,36sudc,quadriplegic_cheetah,1 point,Thu May 21 22:57:11 2015 UTC,"How does sticking with RNH and Draisaitl as his top 2 centers provoke that situation though? Roy is an UFA. We both agree that Edmonton needs more defense, that's for sure."
Habs,36sudc,zeMVK,0,Thu May 21 23:12:18 2015 UTC,What do you mean? They would roll Nuge/Drai McDavid  Plekanec down the middle and then trade either  Nuge or Drai
Habs,36sudc,quadriplegic_cheetah,1 point,Thu May 21 23:14:40 2015 UTC,"Oh yea, right. How can I forget McDavid lol. Durrr."
Habs,36sudc,zeMVK,0,Thu May 21 23:18:43 2015 UTC,"My biggest problem with Draisatl is that he's fairly young and not NHL-ready. Our cup window is opening NOW, and it will last ~4 years with Subban, Patches and Price all signed up with known salaries. We shouldn't get a young player, even with all his potential, unless he can help us win a cup in that time window.  That's why I go with Yakupov and RNH"
Habs,36sudc,Kartias,1 point,Thu May 21 22:55:11 2015 UTC,Gallagher 27 Galchenyuk 25 Pacioretty 30 Price 32 Draisaitl 23 Subban 30 Eller 30  5- 6 years is still very doable
Habs,36sudc,quadriplegic_cheetah,1 point,Thu May 21 23:01:10 2015 UTC,"My main argument for that is the end of Pacioretty's and Price's contract, and while we will re-sign them, they will both be due for a healthy raise which might stop us from having as competitive a team as we can have in the next 4 years.  Habs cap salary: http://www.generalfanager.com/teams/16"
Habs,36sudc,Kartias,4,Thu May 21 23:08:50 2015 UTC,The salary cap should be up by 5-6 mill in 5 years.
Habs,36sudc,quadriplegic_cheetah,0,Thu May 21 23:16:54 2015 UTC,"Still, I think we should be going for a cup run asap, with all our stars in their primes. Waiting for Draisatl when we could use some more star power now with a very good core, espcially if Markov can keep his usual stance for next year's playoffs. Those ages show our core is young and to be competitive for a while, but 4 years is still the time period I see as logical, although who knows what Chucky will do."
Habs,36sudc,Kartias,2,Thu May 21 23:20:37 2015 UTC,"Then why are we trading Plek? We have players JUST entering their primes. They are all 25-26-27. They are barely ripe. Price isn't even in his prime. We have two generations, the ones who are developed in Pacioretty, Eller, Subban, Price and the ones on their way in Galchenyuk, Gallagher, Sherbak, Hudon, De La Rose, Beaulieu and now maybe Draisaitl/Yakupov. We could have some guys at 30-31 in Subban, Pacioretty, Eller and Price, Petry at 32-33. While we have players like Galchenyuk, Gallagher, Sherbak, Hudon and (maybe Draisaitl/Yakupov) in their mid 20's. This could set us up for a cup run for maybe 8-9 years if we do it right. Similar to the Hawks with the split between Chicago has stars from 26-36 and they are very competitive. When they won their cup in 2013 Hossa was 34 and Sharp was 31.  Toews was about 25-26"
Habs,36sudc,quadriplegic_cheetah,1 point,Thu May 21 23:39:13 2015 UTC,"This is assuming this trade is true, which we have no proof of. If it is, it should be for immediate assets. Our great players are in their primes, and we need to cap off on it now, not in 5-6 years. Yes, we should be going for cup runs every year for every year we are lucky enough to have Price, which could go for 10 more years. But trading a good current asset in Plekanec for a future asset in Draisatl just doesn't make sense to me, since we want to win now, with many of our players in their prime.  No matter what we want, the most important member for our cup runs is Price, and his prime is now. Let's use it for all we can!  Edit: Also, I am wondering how you are defining prime. In my mind, it's from ~25-29, and with Price at 27, when would he be hitting it? I get that goalies would enter them at different ages, but I don't see Price getting much better than he is now."

Habs,36sudc,televisionceo,1 point,Thu May 21 21:50:08 2015 UTC,"I like the storyline of bringing back the junior duo back together. Yakupov still has the potential that made him first overall, he can easily be a 60 point producer next season under the right conditions, and hopefully Chucky can join him there.  I haven't seen Draisatl enough to comment on that, but I still want Chucky at center with Larry and DD."
Habs,36sudc,Kartias,-1,Thu May 21 21:58:07 2015 UTC,I can't see Yak and MT getting along at all.
Habs,36sudc,BinaryChode,2,Fri May 22 01:15:54 2015 UTC,"If it's true, I hope the fuck we get at least top-3 forward for this.   Bergevin showed us he was a master to get almost unknown guys to do the job, but we're waiting to see if he's also a wizard for huge trades."

Habs,36sudc,PeedOffKitty,1 point,Thu May 21 21:18:44 2015 UTC,"I don't think it be a center. We have too many centers, probably a good winger. I'd like to finally give Galchenyuk the chance to prove himself at center."
Habs,36sudc,R3volte,-3,Thu May 21 21:23:51 2015 UTC,"I'm seriously thinking its Plekanec, 1st overall pick and Tinordi for Draisaitl  All I have is a hunch, but it just makes too much fucking sense"
Habs,36sudc,quadriplegic_cheetah,8,Thu May 21 21:52:39 2015 UTC,"No please no......  If we're trading that many assets, I want a proven player not a rookie. I want a winger in the mid 20's"
Habs,36sudc,Gabroux,2,Thu May 21 22:05:00 2015 UTC,yea I agree.  An unproven rookie would be undesirable.  If we're going to make a trade with Edmonton that involves Plekanec and a 1st then we should be able to get a better return.  Yakupov would be my wet dream just to watch the highlights every night of him and chucky tearing it up.
Habs,36sudc,habuheard,1 point,Thu May 21 22:12:44 2015 UTC,"I would want Eberle or Hall. I know they would never trade Hall, but he would be my first pick"
Habs,36sudc,Gabroux,-1,Fri May 22 00:54:54 2015 UTC,Yakupov is another option. But you have to give up quality to get quality. Nobody here seems to understand this. We're not going to get a potential future star u less we give up big name players picks prospects etc.  Kessel took two firsts and a second. (High firsts)  Seguin took Eriksson (who was a 70 point player) And some good young prospects.  We are not going to get a scoring forward if we don't pay for one
Habs,36sudc,quadriplegic_cheetah,2,Thu May 21 22:32:31 2015 UTC,"Yakupov still has a lot to prove and I think giving up Plekanec and a 1st is quite a bit.  But, yea you do have to give up value to get value.    I have my doubts about an Edmonton trade anyway since Plekanec has a limited no trade clause and I can't see him wanting to go there"

Habs,36sudc,habsdane,1 point,Fri May 22 14:17:31 2015 UTC,Leads the WHL in scoring through the playoffs. I really really want this kid on a line with Patches and Gally. And that's exactly what we need to give up.
Habs,36sudc,quadriplegic_cheetah,3,Thu May 21 22:09:43 2015 UTC,"If we're trading Plekanec, a 1st and Tinordi, I want Eberle or Hall, not Draisatil. Too many players have been all stars in the CHL and do absolutely nothing afterwards."
Habs,36sudc,Gabroux,-1,Fri May 22 00:56:00 2015 UTC,"Every sub overrates their players.... I would want a middle tier prospect (Pateryn, Tinner) an aging but talented vet, and a 1st round pick if I was giving away a future potential 1st line center. You have to give up quality to get quality. And no we're not getting Hall, don't even mention Hall lol. Eberle is a possibility but even the. Yak is more likely."
Habs,36sudc,quadriplegic_cheetah,2,Fri May 22 02:00:33 2015 UTC,"But still I do not want Drai, I think it's really underselling Plekanec"
Habs,36sudc,Gabroux,-1,Fri May 22 02:02:20 2015 UTC,"We all know how valuable Plek is. He's amazing, and most of the league knows it(barring fans). If we trade him it will be tough, to fill that hole, but I think Eller can do a really good job of it."

Habs,36sudc,habsdane,-1,Fri May 22 17:05:06 2015 UTC,No way in what sense? Not enough return? Oshie is a great fit to play with Patches just as in the Olympics

Habs,36sudc,habsdane,1 point,Fri May 22 17:50:38 2015 UTC,I just disagree. I think he'd be a great fit. I love pleks but I see more potential in oshie. The 1st makes the deal tough in a deep draft year but I think it would be worth while.
Habs,36sudc,Tetembe,2,Fri May 22 18:14:08 2015 UTC,Would you take Oshie over Yak?
Habs,36sudc,habsdane,1 point,Fri May 22 18:20:19 2015 UTC,I would. I've always liked the idea of bringing in yak to play with chucky again but I'd probably pick oshie to play with patches instead of yak to play with galchenyuk. I think getting yak is more realistic for sure. What would you seriously part with for yak tho?
Habs,36sudc,Tetembe,2,Fri May 22 20:42:01 2015 UTC,Ummm. I'd go plekanec and a first for yak? I'd go tinner + Eller and a late pick as well. Even Emelin and a package . What do you think?
Habs,36sudc,habsdane,1 point,Sat May 23 02:45:25 2015 UTC,Just so much to give up for yak. I know we need scoring but just such a huge price tag. I'd want someone who is more proven. I'd take him for less no doubt though.
