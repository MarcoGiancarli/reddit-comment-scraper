BiGoneMild,3c9cdj,mylastredditaccountw,2,Mon Jul 6 17:37:17 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much! Yes, black clothing for all seasons in Florida. When I go work health fairs, I get to wear a little more casual clothing and I usually get compliments from my coworkers and clients. I have decided I just need to start my own non-profit and dictate the dress code."
