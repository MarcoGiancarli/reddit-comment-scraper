By the end of it, there was blood all over us both, but we had a great time."

balisong,3e4avf,Human_Evolution,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:35:17 2015 UTC,I tried making my own latch from the videos. I could never get it to work. So I just splurged and bought a latch kit from ButterflyKnifeKits. Works fantastically.

The B209 has a latch issue but latches are overrated unless you're going to EDC it. And there's always paracord latches which I prefer.

If you have an adjustable budget , I'd highly highly highly recommend searching out a Hom Prodigy. It flips like all of the top tier titanium knives and it's built with the same quality. You can look on forums such as jerzeedevil and attempt to contact other members who you can do business with.

I reversed the problem at one point... making the blade too tight with the bite handle.  I'm sure there's a happy medium somewhere."
balisong,3e0hse,squidmaster23,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:15:01 2015 UTC,"With channel balisongs, you want washers that are as tight as possible for minimal wiggle room.

Inner diameter is 3/16 and outer is 1/4. I'd recommend buying several 0.010 and 0.015 and maybe a few .005."

Watch the handles and follow the one you should catch. Once confident, do that, but now just let the handle tap your hand as it falls (don't try to catch it). That way you feel when you should go for it. Eventually you should be able to do it. Remember: When a knife is in the air, both handles are bite handles"

I personally own one of these. Key West and Butterflyknifekits still have some in stock so if you do get one of these purchase from those suppliers as the DHGate and Aliexpress versions have been downgraded in quality and are very poorly made. My friend has the CCC BM42 Clone and he reports that the handles are heavier than the Twist's (steel channels) but the spring latch works great. The Twist flips great but the latch is poorly machined and is VERY loose. This makes the Twist slightly more balanced than the clone but it has a shitty latch. I like mine but am looking for something different. If you get a Twist get from those two suppliers and also upgrade the pivots as well, they are pretty bad.   Note:  Stay away from the cheap Bear and Sons as the pivots are not screws. This makes them last a decent amount of time, but once the pivots are done, they're done for good.   Note 2:  If you purchase under 50 balis you risk the tang cups (pins?) getting crushed and the handles touching.  Some people report this happening, others do not.  One of the tang pins on my Twist actually came out and I had to epoxy it back in, but they do not seem to be crushing so far.  A little pricier - Under 100   Titanium CCC BM4X Clone: Don't know much about these but from what I hear they are pretty nice as they are titanium constructed channel handles. Basically a better more balanced version of the steel BM4X clone. Likely has slightly better quality control than its cheaper counterpart. Also probably good to upgrade pivots still.   Bear Ops Models: Some people like these and say they are the best for under 100 but I would disagree. The steel is better than the 440C on all of the above as it is Sandvik 14Something steel but the handles are aluminum which makes them significantly more fragile and from what I hear the quality control can be shoddy. IMHO you are better off getting a steel or titanium clone and upgrading the pivots, or paying just a little bit more.   A little pricier but probably better - Over 100   Bradley Kimura: These will have significantly better fit and finish than the rest. The Kimura 11 is still available while the rest you will have to hunt for (watch Jerzeedevil and /r/knife_swap). While it has vastly better quality control and finish, the handles are bare steel and in my opinion they can be (11 especially) ugly. If you can spend absolutely no more, this is from what I hear superior to all of the above, but if you can spend a little more the BM51 is a lot more balanced not to mention sexier.   Benchmade 51: This is the most expensive of this cheap list and for good reason. While this knife is very light, it has the best quality of all of the mentioned knives and a killer warranty to back it up. It is better balanced than the Kimura, in my opinion looks a lot better, and has a real non-chinese spring latch. The steel is also better, it is D2 tool steel which makes it good for EDC (warning it is known to rust easily so keep it lubed). You can find these floating around for around 150 used if you're lucky. I recently stumbled upon a tip someone posted, if you have a military friend, their discount along with another code can bring the price of a NEW 51 down to 150. I won't do a full review since there are plenty around the Internet for this and I don't have one, but this is the best on this list if you can afford it and I am currently working towards getting one. If someone wants to sell (or give :3) me one, send me a PM.   Good luck with your search and I hope this helps!   P.S. Sorry if there's grammar mistakes, wrote this on mobile. Gonna fix it later. And if I missed anything, let me know and I'll add it :)  Also please don't flame me for all the cheap balis, I realize that most of these don't hold a candle to the other, more expensive options, but for some this is all that is affordable."

Mostly you see the $15 cheepos at gas stations.  Also, nobody cares if you have one in your home, and It's not worth the time to write a search warrant for a butterfly knife.  Also, the lawmakers in WA are weird.  I would say there's no chance in hell of a law like that passing, but in the past few years we've legalized suppressors, short barreled rifles, and weed.  On the other hand we've imposed mandatory background checks for all gun transfers.  So I don't know, but I'm guessing butterfly knives are low on the list of priorities."

balisong,3dhame,Patrick_McPatterson,2,Thu Jul 16 07:10:20 2015 UTC,"Last week I started my most challenging project ever -- G10 scales for the Kimura XI. The scales in the pictures above are prototypes that I have now abandoned because the screw design wasn't secure enough. My original plan for this design was to use the holes on the Kimura as grounding, but I quickly learned that tapping all of those holes would be an inefficient. For those who are unfamiliar with machining, tapping is basically creating threads for screws to screw into.   My new design will be very similar to the way the 51 and Replicant is assembled. I plan to replace the current spacer screws with longer screws to accommodate for the thicker handles. I'm hoping that the pivot screws are long enough so that I don't have to replace those as well.   I plan on offering these scales on a production level at $70 for a full set of 4 scales and replacement screws, shipping included. The first batch will be red G10 only. The scales you see in the pictures above are a VERY rough outline and serve more as an announcement rather than a depiction. The scales will be rounded with a sweet milled pattern because the Kimura XI desperately needs pimping.   Thanks for reading guys.  -Squid"

balisong,3dg2i2,Nightgale57,1 point,Thu Jul 16 11:17:08 2015 UTC,Pretty much the best bali for $80-100 is the Bear Ops line. I own the Bear Ops B200 and its the best $80 bali I've ever seen. Flips as good if not better than most higher end balis for me. I'm thinking about trying the Bear Ops B400 if I can find blue or black handles.

Washer tolerance is everything when it comes to making a cheap knife flip like an expensive knife. I own 4 different types of washers so I can get the tolerances perfect. I have super thin, thin, normal, and thick. From my experience big washers cut down on play. You can file the inside of the handles (milled handles) where the washers go and or sand the washers if you don't have the correct size washers."

Of course, it could have been just because I was still kind of new to balis, but it definitely took some getting used to.  Sold mine to a buddy after he messed the handles up, but I'd like to have another crack at flipping one now that I have more hours under my belt."
balisong,3d9bjv,iiiwildfireiii,3,Tue Jul 14 16:40:01 2015 UTC,"Flippin with it is kinda akward because of how heavy the blade is and how wide it is in the bottom part. The fact that the pivots are not on the same level doesn't help too (i'm new to flipping too) but after a while you get used to it and, at least for basic tricks, feels like any other bali"
balisong,3d9bjv,crazymutherfucker,2,Tue Jul 14 18:20:00 2015 UTC,what do you think of it. I really like the handle design.
balisong,3d9bjv,statictonality,2,Tue Jul 14 18:29:47 2015 UTC,"I really love it, there is even a cool trick to remove the safe latch when the knife is closed by pushing the handles one against the other in a spot close to it. I love the blade and the a-symmetric design in general"
balisong,3dbb49,Nebxam,5,Tue Jul 14 23:05:48 2015 UTC,"They both have their merits. You should probably try both of them before settling on one, but I can understand that you probably dont' have the resources to buy both.   I'd recommend getting the 42 (if it's priced fairly) first since it's more difficult to acquire than the Flytanium 51. If you end up not liking the 42, you can easily sell it and find a Flytanium."
balisong,3dbb49,squidmaster23,2,Tue Jul 14 23:33:22 2015 UTC,"The problem with finding 42s is they are a little overpriced. I could see them at around 300$ but alot of them now are roughly 425$. I dont think for flipping it would be the best knife as the replicant is about 350$-ish and is widely renounced as one of the best flippers or in some cases, the best flipper. But 42s are often sought after for their collection value.   Edit: Went off on a tangent on the Rep. If you are set on Benchmade, I would recommend the Flytanium as it is easier to acquire and cheaper than a 42."

If you're mostly interested in flipping, I'd recommend the second one. I remember my B400 to be slightly blade heavy, and it appears that the black bladed one has a slimmer profile."

Only flip over carpet, grass, and a bed if you like to keep your knives looking good. I'm thinking about buying a Bear Ops 400 too. I'm liking the $80 ones much more than the $140 ones. I own a Bear Ops B200 and it flips as good as my $330 Replicant (with my flipping style.)"
