ProGolf,3e5gyv,PrettyPointlessPost,4,Wed Jul 22 05:32:13 2015 UTC,Awesome picture! But what is happening here? Did Jordan and Zach fly back on the same private plane or something? Is this common?
ProGolf,3e5gyv,data_analysis_cosby,5,Wed Jul 22 04:01:47 2015 UTC,Yes and yes!
ProGolf,3e5gyv,data_analysis_cosby,4,Wed Jul 22 04:10:08 2015 UTC,"Wow, very cool. Thanks for sharing. The fact that a lot of the guys are friends off the course just solidifies my love for the sport."
ProGolf,3e5gyv,devilsadvocado,-2,Wed Jul 22 05:45:19 2015 UTC,"It has nothing to do with them being friends, it's just incredibly practical to planepool when flying internationally. Every year there's a plane that shuttles players from the John Deere tournament to the British Open."
ProGolf,3e5gyv,data_analysis_cosby,3,Wed Jul 22 07:14:28 2015 UTC,"Directly from /u/Twoto2's link/Zach Johnson's mouth...  ""We had a bunch of guys on the plane.

ProGolf,3e1rab,nysom1227,4,Tue Jul 21 07:59:35 2015 UTC,"They should have mentioned Leishman's missed 5 footer on 16.  There might not have even been a playoff if he makes that one.  Good for ZJ, though."
ProGolf,3e1rab,sizzlingshrimp,3,Tue Jul 21 15:26:01 2015 UTC,How about Jordan's pitch/chip from off the green on 14 or 15 that somehow didn't go in.
ProGolf,3e1rab,Mastershake210,5,Tue Jul 21 17:17:17 2015 UTC,The only thing he's thinking of on that round is the 4-putt double bogey.  Ouch
ProGolf,3e1rab,HawkHogan,4,Tue Jul 21 19:32:48 2015 UTC,this is stupid.  273 shots plus the playoff determined the open.  they all count the same amount.
ProGolf,3e1rab,lafferty__daniel,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:10:53 2015 UTC,That would be my take too. You win or lose over 4 rounds. How about the 2 shots Jason Day dropped on the Saturday morning before play was suspended? or the four or five putts from six foot that Jordan Spieth missed on the Friday. If two of those drop it's a different result. Just looks like an article that someone has written confined to the last nine holes to be honest
ProGolf,3e1rab,FarawayFairways,2,Wed Jul 22 11:15:00 2015 UTC,"Mentioning Jordan's missed bogey on the par 3 is so stupid. If he hits his tee shot to even 50 feet instead of 100, he saves 2 shots there. To me, that was actually the most important of the whole tournament. That was 2 shots, not just 1"
ProGolf,3e1rab,DarthYoda2594,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:43:07 2015 UTC,"Right, but his first putt was terrible -- easily his worst putt of the tournament. It killed any chance of par, but he got it close enough for a bogey that he makes 9 out of 10 times if not more...and he whiffed. I get why they called it out."

ProGolf,3dxmp7,Grandmaster_Corgi,20,Mon Jul 20 13:53:20 2015 UTC,I honestly dont understand why they aren't showing more Speith. If this was Tiger you know we would be seeing every damn shot...
ProGolf,3dxmp7,redsoxman6594,18,Mon Jul 20 14:46:58 2015 UTC,A playoff without Spieth is just not what anyone wants to see
ProGolf,3dxmp7,omgshutthefuckup,9,Mon Jul 20 17:28:28 2015 UTC,"some real good scores already, even a -6 by Arnold. Phil to -8 might make double digits by the end.  I'm guessing the final score to be -15 maybe -16. someone from the -9's will shoot 66 at least, the last couple groups will probably have tougher conditions and higher scores like yesterday and a good score will be 68. spieth shoots another 66 I think it's his, unless oosthuizen matches. anyone close shoots a 63 or a record breaking 62 and it could be out of reach for the last groups if it gets windy.  Dunne hasn't made a bogey yet, three pars on 17 so far is basically getting 3 shots on the field. maybe the pressure will get to him but I would bet 1/1 he doesn't shoot over par.   I want to see Jordan shoot 64 or better and walk down 18 with the cup already engraved, would be the biggest thing I have ever seen in golf and whistling straits would be terrified. I think 67/68 for spieth and Louis respectively is a good guess, with a playoff after maybe including someone else who shoots the low round of the day but after sitting waiting for over an hour with the clubhouse lead doesn't really challenge the two headliners. can't forget about day but I don't think he will shoot lower than spieth or Louis.   I do think we will see a 63 today, hopefully better. with so many people that are still kinda in it, but needing to hit to every flag, with soft conditions It is very probable.  I am so excited, best Monday ever. glad to be sharing it with you guys, let's get the popcorn ready"

ProGolf,3dytbh,megatroneo,6,Mon Jul 20 17:18:52 2015 UTC,Can anyone possibly explain how someone so good at long distance putting has got such ropey stats short?  20-25ft - ranked number 1 at 28.85%  4ft 8 - ranked number 165 @ 64.7%
ProGolf,3dytbh,FarawayFairways,3,Mon Jul 20 19:37:47 2015 UTC,"His mind gets in the way. He has a great pair of hands and coordination. Dufner has similar trend in stats. Once they think about the consequence of missing a putt instead of trying to make it and making it is a bonus, it's over and miss the putts.  So good news is that I think he can fix that Stat and can be more dominant than he has been this summer."
ProGolf,3dytbh,CaveBacon,3,Tue Jul 21 02:12:00 2015 UTC,"Honestly I think it could be the SuperStroke putter grip he has. I threw one on and my distance putting wasn't nearly as effected as my short length. I couldn't put from inside 10 ft, a distance where I am normally confident. Maybe the superstroke helps from far but hurts from close."
ProGolf,3dytbh,clarf6,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:38:08 2015 UTC,"Another thing to consider is his grip. I've found that anything over ~50ft is harder to judge when cross-handed. And I noticed Spieth was left with too many putts in that 4 to 8 range, which is also the area he has to decide to watch the hole or not. I was downvoted to hell in another thread for bringing this up."
ProGolf,3dytbh,stonelore,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:22:18 2015 UTC,"So far as I know, there would be nothing in the rules preventing him carrying 2 putters!  Let's be honest, it's the club that you use the most, and one which can most definitely affect your score if you've fallen out of love with it. With such an alarming discrepancy between his distances, I'd be seriously considering it if the explanation of grip is correct. You wouldn't want to lose your prowess at 20ft plus, but if someone offered you four shots off your score over a tournament just by carrying a second putter? Well lets just say he'd be three quarters of the way to a grand slam right now"
ProGolf,3dytbh,FarawayFairways,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:09:24 2015 UTC,"Very interesting idea. Never thought of that, and more unusuals club selections have been made in the past (read: Mickelson)."
ProGolf,3dytbh,Yoshiman400,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:36:22 2015 UTC,"So much of this game is in the head too. We all know you have hot and cold days with a putter. It might sound silly, but I think having the option to switch between two choices mid round might actually have other benefits as well.   How often do you see tennis players change their racket when they're looking for something to happen? A sort of pyshcological thing could work for you now and then rather than labouring away with a putter that you start to suspect of being possessed by something unworldly  As you suggest, Mickelson carries a veritable arsenal of different wedges which are essentially clubs designed for different distances (OK that's massively simplistic as a wedge has other significant properties) but the question I'm coming round to is, is the concept of a long range putter and a short range putter really that illogical. The speed you hit the shots at are very different (unlike a lot of drives and iron play, where the speed is constant and the distance you reach is determined by the club you select), would the putter (of all clubs) not lend itself particularly to supporting two different designs accordingly?"
ProGolf,3dytbh,FarawayFairways,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:45:37 2015 UTC,"I was also thinking about that one Masters Phil won or contended in with two drivers in his bag, and I know he was using that Phrankenwood as a substitute for a driver as well."

ProGolf,3dytbh,FarawayFairways,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:36:37 2015 UTC,Maybe because he looks at the hole and not the ball on closer putts sometimes?
ProGolf,3dytbh,playervlife,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:44:37 2015 UTC,"You can put an aggressive stroke on a 20ft putt. A 4 footer on greens running 11 on the stimp (not St Andrews, but the typical PGA event) is a very delicate affair. Your head has more chance to ruin things when you aren't accelerating aggressively through the stroke.  It will likely get slowly worse as he ages.

ProGolf,3dtyl8,HitchmoMcStang,4,Mon Jul 20 02:23:09 2015 UTC,"As others have noted, it would REALLY depend on the caddy. Spieth is notable because he's always talking to his caddy, and Sergio does likewise (why they were so well paired today). On the flip side, DJ never seems to talk much with his caddy who is his BROTHER, they just walk the course. (I'm sure they DO chat but not about each shot, almost never.)   But I agree, I think it would be cool even if they did it afterwards like in the NFL with the Mic'ed Up segments. Doing it live might be weird for competitive reasons but later on?

ProGolf,3du2fb,css01,8,Sun Jul 19 13:54:17 2015 UTC,"Turnberry is the answer to the question if you restrict it to courses on the rotation. Nothing matches it.   There is another cluster on the Aberdeenshire coast which have some of the most spectacular high dune systems in Europe. Cruden Bay, Aberdeen, and the new Trump course are all top-100.   Kingsbarns in Fife (just a few miles from St Andrews) is always immaculate and often wins an annual poll taken amongst American players for their favourite  If you define beauty by wild exposure then Machrihanish on the Kintyre peninsula has two courses, one of which is top 100. Finally, you might consider the Highland courses in the same vein. Golf Digest rank Royal Dornoch as Scotland's best course, and that can be supplemented with Castel Stuart, Nairn, Tain and Brora  As regards the best course, last time I spoke with the R&A on the subject I did manage to extract an opinion from someone in a position to offer such view! In honesty, it's a subjective thing but the gentleman concerned assured me it was his favourite and led me to believe it would probably win a vote. The answer begins with the latter 'C' and can be found just east of Dundee!"

ProGolf,3du2fb,FarawayFairways,3,Sun Jul 19 15:52:53 2015 UTC,"Turnberry and Muirfield are my favourites I have been to. Muirfield especially is great,the course is stunning as there is a lot to see nearby Edinburgh is close by on the train. Also the food around there was top notch I've been to the ones in England and to be honest the food wasn't as good."
ProGolf,3du2fb,tallguyxxx,2,Sun Jul 19 18:52:20 2015 UTC,"I've played Muirfield a fair few times, being local, and I found the course to be a total disappointment. It's in great nick, it is incredibly difficult etc, but I found it far from the beautiful Mecca that I expected it to be. It's fairly...flat, for want of a better term. Another course nearby, Craigielaw, is more the course that I expected Muirfield to be.  The exclusivity and the novelty are what makes Muirfield what it is, and such a sought after destination. If it wasn't for the fact that the rough is high enough to tickle your balls, it wouldn't be that difficult a course.  Also, the starter is a prick, but that's to be expected really - I wouldn't have it any other way!"

ProGolf,3du2fb,DuskytheHusky,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:29:03 2015 UTC,"Turnberry hosts the womens Open at the end of July of course, so you should be able to catch some of it. Muirfield is probably the most complete test of a links golfer (you only need to look at the list of past winners to see that). I wouldn't have said that the courses of east Lothian are particularly aesthetic though. I'd have said the Glen Course at North Berwick is about the most visually impressive if scenery is the arbitor, and the Old Course of North Berwick is probably the most fun given that it incorproates just about every quirky links characteristic you could ask for  If you're looking at Open venues though, perhaps we ought to acknowledge we've overlooked Portrush for 2019. Now that links could be held in a similar bracket to Turnberry (Turnberry shades imo) but both courses are due for significant rennovation work shortly"
ProGolf,3du2fb,FarawayFairways,2,Mon Jul 20 11:19:38 2015 UTC,"Can't really answer your question properly but I think you couldn't really go wrong with any of the open courses, they are all beautiful.   Personally I would advise going to one that is near Edinburgh so that you can visit the city as it is a treat (might be a little biased as I'm from Edinburgh) and kill two beautiful birds with one stone. There are also some really nice links courses you could play on the east coast such as courses in Musselburgh, Gullane, North Berwick and Dubar."

ProGolf,3dsyml,nohopeleftforanyone,4,Mon Jul 20 13:42:15 2015 UTC,I agree but I don't know what they could really do to St Andrews to make it harder without a complete redesign.

He's said numerous times (and reiterated it recently) that he won't play on into old age. Once he concludes he can't win anymore, he'll walk away etc  Open venues have been scheduled until 2019 (Portrush) albeit it's a badly kept secret that St Andrews is likely to slip a year and next host in 2021 for the 150th anniversary. That makes Tiger 45 by then  To think that last year a debate was just starting to rage about whether or not he should be given a wild card for the Ryder Cup as Tom was seemingly in the process of lowering the bar to permit his inclusion. I'd imagine less than 10% would be calling for his selection today were we teeing it up again in September?"
ProGolf,3dt818,FarawayFairways,5,Sun Jul 19 11:10:47 2015 UTC,"Don't former champions of the Open automatically qualify if they're 60 or under on the final day of the tournament?  Assuming that St. Andews continues its 5-year rotation and hosts in 2020, 2025, 2030, and 2035 ... Tiger will have four more times he'll be automatically in the field. If they push back 2020 to 2021 and don't quickly correct back to years that end in 0 or 5, he'll still be ""60 and under"" in 2036.  Even if he reaches the conclusion that he can't win anymore and walks away, will he completely walk away? I could see him still wanting one final appearance at the Masters, at St. Andrews, at Pebble Beach, etc.  And he'll be eligible for the Champions Tour in 2026. Is that something he's willing to consider?"

ProGolf,3drg08,Shavenyak,8,Sat Jul 18 19:08:34 2015 UTC,"St. Andrews is special because it is the ""Home of Golf"" and every golf fan should know some stuff about it.  It is one of the very first places where golf was played in the 1400/1500's. It was never ""built"" in the modern sense; people hundreds of years ago just found this patch of land and hit balls around it. The concept of a fairway, green, rough, and bunkers were in part because that's what was there at St. Andrews. That's also why it has some weird stuff like double greens and huge fairways.  It seems weird to us because now golf course design is very much a science, but back then they just found this land and marked out holes. Of course over the years they've tidied the place up but it still retains much of its original character. It gives the course so much charm and it's absolutely amazing how the earliest known golf course is not only still around, but still of the quality and caliber to host a Major."
ProGolf,3drg08,kevo31415,5,Sat Jul 18 20:30:50 2015 UTC,"The oldest course in the world that is still recognisable and played today, is a 9 holer at Mussleburgh on the infield of the racecourse (used to host Opens until the Honorable Company moved their HQ to Muirfield in 1894)  It wouldn't be correct to say that the links is the dominant style in the UK though (as posted in another reply). Most courses are still the inland parkland courses. The best courses are the links courses, followed by the heathland courses around London  We get asked occasionally about which course is the nearest (or perhaps most faithful would be a better description) to those which were used by the ancient pioneers.   The answer we tend to give though is Machrihanish Dunes (built in AD2009!) but which observes so many of the original constraints that a course would have had to all those centuries ago. Only 7 acres were subject to any earth treatment, the fairways are maintained by sheep with grazing rights (as they would have been back then) and no aritifical chemicals are allowed to treat the turf. Askernish is another that would have claims to be relatively faithful to the originals  The original game was developed on links land and sand dunes of course, which really meant that solitary indviduals would adopt a stretch of coastline and devise their own personal challenges based on their interpretation of the landscape, and the features they found in it. As time passed they compared notes with each other and recognised routes got adopted to the point whereby they started to pass as a course. It became polite to play in company of fellow golfers when comparing notes, and ultimately early clubs started to form. The oldest in the world with a continuous unbroken verifiable history is actually Royal Burgess (1735)"
ProGolf,3drg08,FarawayFairways,6,Sat Jul 18 21:31:27 2015 UTC,"It's an entirely different style, sometimes denoted ""Links"" golf, which is the dominant style in the UK. Also, it is the original style of golf. It's a ""style"" because the different layout of the golf course and different weather means that you should play differently."
ProGolf,3drg08,ahumanlikeyou,3,Sat Jul 18 19:20:34 2015 UTC,"Links isn't the dominant style of course in the UK. Links are by the sea and on sandy soil. Not all courses by the sea are links, but all Open courses are links. I'd say at a guess maybe 10% of courses in the UK are links."
ProGolf,3drg08,flarkey,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:37:04 2015 UTC,"yeah, links doesn't actually mean golf in the UK, it does mean Golf on the coast. But, it's come to denote certain features which are often also associated with golf in the UK. but it's right of you to keep it straight"
ProGolf,3drg08,ahumanlikeyou,2,Sat Jul 18 22:59:04 2015 UTC,"I made the error recently in the clubhouse at Royal Burgess of talking about links courses and mentioned Kingsbarns (world ranked top 50ish). The drinks were thumped into the table, with the observation ""Kingsbarns isn't built on links land"" - they were of course correct, and I had to beat a retreat!.   The Castle Course at St Andrews is a cliff top course and therefore not a links. Castle Stuart is another that comes to mind as perhaps not being able to survive the purest definition. The only course used on the Open roster that doesn't run up to a shoreline incidentally is Royal Lytham, (probably the one that's got the most to worry about too going forward) but that is regarded as a links course  In America Pebble Beach is sometimes referred to as a links course, strictly speaking it isn't. Mind you, I've even heard some people try and pass Whistling Straits off as a links course!"

ProGolf,3drg08,FarawayFairways,4,Sat Jul 18 19:29:41 2015 UTC,"A favourite quote of mine comes from US golf writer, George Peper when addressing the Fife Golf Association (Fife is the area of Scotland where St Andrews is located)  ""Someday I hope to bring my grandchildren here to Scotland – not to show them what golf is but what golf isn’t – that it isn’t $200 million resorts and $200,000 membership fees, that it isn’t six hour rounds and three day member-guests, that it isn’t motorized buggies, Cuban cigars, and cashmere headcovers. It’s a game you play simply and honorably, without delay or complaint – where you respect your companions, respect the rules, and respect the ground you walk on. Where on the 18th green you remove your cap and shake hands, maybe just a little humbler and a little wiser than when you began."" - personally I don't think I've ever read anything that better encapsulates it, and hopefully it might give you a little bit of an insight into the 'home of golf' moniker that you will have heard bandied about  It's worth noting that unlike so many of America's apex golf courses, a lot of Scotland's are surprisingly accessible. The St Andrews Links Trust is protected by an act of parliament last updated in 1970 IIRC, and the Old Course itself is a public course  To give you some idea of context and scale, Scotland has 14 courses ranked in the world's top-100 by Golf Digest. The country has a landmass similar in size to South Carolina! (imagine that!). Of these 14, Loch Lomond is the only one where you'd really struggle to get a round (the only one that isn't a links course too - albeit you could correctly argue that some of the 'links courses' are actually seaside courses that aren't built on pure links land). Muirfield isn't easy either, but it is possible with a bit of planning."
ProGolf,3drg08,fisherking67,2,Sat Jul 18 22:37:08 2015 UTC,"The course was built in the most frugal way possible. (Edit) because back when they invented the game, everyone volunteered to help maintain it because they all had jobs and this was ""for fun"". So they tried to keep it simple but challenging. Simple meant, walk out and walk back. Hence :  Front 9 out and back 9 back - sharing as many fairways and greens as possible to reduce upkeep efforts. If you're a RH player and draw the ball you're gonna love it. If you fade/slice the ball you're in for a very long grind. Because with shared fairways on many of the holes, the bail out is the fairway of another hole. Which is friggin awesome if your ball flight agrees with it."
ProGolf,3drg08,c-fox,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:16:34 2015 UTC,"St Andrews originally had 22 holes, but they combined some of them and ended up with 18.  All other courses followed suit, and this is now the norm."

I don't think anyone minds a sensible vocal appreciation of a good shot, albeit personally I'd prefer to see the ball in flight at the very least before offering one. I mean, how stupid are you going to feel shouting ""great shot"" as it hooks 50yds off line and ends up in a gorse bush! I think there was an incident on 18 though where someone shouted something at Sergio and he seemed to look over and recognise them, laugh and wave, and even pointed his caddie in the direction who also seemed to acknowledge them.   I did note a group got warned about shouting mashed potato on a Spieth shot. The following hole they'd toned it down a bit to some excitable noise rather than a banal advert for fast food.  I also think someone needs to get hold of that piper playing in 'Golf Place'. If I was standing over a 6 footer on a hushed 18th tomorrow I don't think I'd want to have a bagpipe dirge filling the air myself. It's fine for the tourists, but from a melodic standpoint, the seagulls make a better noise! - just hope no wild haggis runs across the fairway and picks the ball up!"

The rules official told Jimenez to move the ball back instead of Dufner, and as he was about to shoot it, they got word it was supposed to be dufner, but Jimenez had already moved his ball.  So the let him drop his ball back in the original place.  Then Daly got sick of waiting and lines up to hit and the official said hold on sir and Daly said ""Why my balls in play, I don't want to get behind"" and then the rules official was like ok I guess your right and he hit then Jimenez hit his and then dufner moved his back and hit his."

Realizing how much money they'd lose if he did, they let Steve keep his shorts on.  That's the last time I can remember anybody talking about caddie shorts. Didn't realize the rule was changed at some point because I never paid close enough attention and it's not a big enough deal that the press would discuss it."

Played it cool too, had it cupped and never hit it during either interview, then went after it when the camera panned... Perfect. And to all the folks who'll argue.. I am fairly certain there have been a few tobacco products enjoyed on that tee in the past. No big deal."

ProGolf,3dhulc,BIGDIRTYDADDY27,14,Thu Jul 16 16:35:02 2015 UTC,"If you honestly think that ""having fun"" is defined as attending a golf tournament and shouting out a stream of inane banalities, which actually detracts from the enjoyment of the majority of spectators, then there really is nothing to say. It's a strange definition of ""fun"", but sadly not one with which I'm familiar  If however you're framing ""having fun"" as alcohol consumption, then I suggest you actually see where America ranks in the global consumption league tables. I'll save you the research though, it's lower than just about every country in Europe  Admittedly you do get some American 'fans' who think this is fun, but most I speak with don't. Ultimately the PGA could police it if they chose to, but they make excuses and choose not to.  If you don't believe me, then try answering this  How long do you think it would be before they acted, if spectators took to shouting out the brand name of rival sponsors? I somehow suspect they'd be onto someone who shouts ""UPS delivers faster"" rather quickly?.   Oh they could do it if they wanted to, like they do at Augusta"

ProGolf,3dhulc,IHaveLargeBalls,3,Thu Jul 16 19:28:00 2015 UTC,"Not at all  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_alcohol_consumption_per_capita  The World Health Organisation places at least 29 European countries ahead of the US (depends where you draw the European boundary, but I've erred on not venturing too far into EurAsia where it would increase further). I'm only counting 5 lower down the list (largely because it's so expensive in Scandanavia - about $12 a pint last I knew).   There's only one western country I can think of that's ever tried to prohibit the consumption of alcohol by law, and in a lot of states the legal age to drink it is 21. These are hardly signs of a deep drinking culture. I've spent enough time in the US (Ok, New York) to see that myself.  Irrespective of any of this, I still don't see how shouting ""mashed potato"" at a golf ball, equals ""fun""....   Look you only have to take a quick spin around cyberspace and the golf message boards tonight to realise that the issue of crowd shout outs has been picked up. The overwhelming majority of fans (mainly American) are saying how pleased they are, and how much more they've enjoyed watching because of the absence of ""in the holers"""
ProGolf,3dhulc,ForeTheTime,3,Thu Jul 16 20:27:20 2015 UTC,"I'm not going to say that I'm for or against yelling weird phrases after a player hits his shot. I will say, however, that golf is unique to sports that Americans attend, in that it's the only one that requires politeness (same goes for tennis, actually). I just think the American sports fan has been conditioned to associate sports with raucous behavior. But what do I know, I'm just a dude with large balls."
ProGolf,3dhulc,FarawayFairways,-3,Thu Jul 16 20:51:58 2015 UTC,It's just our mentality. Especially for younger people that it's more fun to cheer and yell than to sit there in silence.  I like to think of it as enthusiasm and if it ruins your time we honestly don't give a fuck. If you don't enjoy it out enjoyment isn't affected
ProGolf,3dhulc,Wild__Card__Bitches,5,Thu Jul 16 23:13:34 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure who you think 'Our' is, in terms of 'our enjoyment' but were you to look across the American golf boards tonight who have threads running on this subject (Reddit's not alone), you'll discover that most of the people (like the original poster of this thread, who used the words ""idiot"" and ""childish"") are appreciative, and they're overwhelmingly American contributors.   I speak to plenty of American golf fans on a regular basis and the overwhelming view is that it's mildly irritating at best and damn annoying at worst. Indeed, quite a few have stated that they'd welcome the sort of text system they use in baseball to anonymously point out offenders and have said they'd have no compunction about using it if they thought for one second that the PGA would do anything about it  The bottom line is that it's less than 1% of the people attending golf events who are responsible. It might be American's doing the shouting out, but its equally American's who are the most fed up with it"

Johnson or Oosthuizen/Open Championship runner up, or Spieth/Kaymer/McIlroy or Mickelson depending on if McIlroy's healthy enough to play by then."

I've got a driving 2 iron from mizuno, same idea. I'll get it 250 on a dry fairway, and it's easier than a driver to hit on line."

Go spend time with your kids, build courses or go play the field (literally)... do anything with all that money you have saved. or 2) Start playing every week and even on the shitty events.  Just get his confidence up and start enjoying the game again.  When i watch him play now it is painful.  Almost like he knows he is going to shank a ball before he swings.  Did you see how sweaty he was on the 1st tee?  It was frickin cold out there... he was nervous over the ball and hit it fat about 45 yards behind his playing partners."

One is ESPN and the other is... well, no one has said anything since I started watching it a few minutes ago, just showing crews getting water off the course. So I don't know. But I'm assuming it's the British broadcast.  During the first round, I think it had streams from 3 different sources, though I'm not really sure what one of them was cause I only opened it for a moment. Might've been Golf Channel."

I've been watching it from the app. not a single shot shown in an hour. they are seriously about to show the tape from 2010. what a joke. masters and us open apps had 3 different video feeds and was excellent.

ProGolf,3dgtjr,bl1ndvision,6,Thu Jul 16 14:07:32 2015 UTC,"I am inclined to agree.  So many of us idolized Tiger in his younger days, so we all WANT to see him come back and play like the Tiger of old.  It's not going to happen.    The competition these days is stronger...the kids who grew up wanting to BE Tiger are now grown up and have surpassed him.  Most of the younger guys can outdrive him now, he's clearly not mentally there on the golf course anymore, and he will never be dominant again.  Tiger is basically relegated to a ""has been"" at this point.  Sad, but true."
ProGolf,3dgtjr,mreatsum,3,Thu Jul 16 14:21:38 2015 UTC,"Yes, I hate to say it, but he lost that fierce competitive desire. He has done a great service to golf, unlike anyone has.

ProGolf,3dgtjr,mootangclan,5,Thu Jul 16 17:18:03 2015 UTC,"It's actually a really easy hole. There are statistics online with numbers and the what not. The old course is aptly named, old as fuck. There's a lot of history there and I would definitely recommend reading more into it. For example, the bridge is something like 600-700 years old.

ProGolf,3dgtjr,DetroitBreakdown,3,Thu Jul 16 11:09:40 2015 UTC,Tigers career is finished.
ProGolf,3dgtjr,tesd44,4,Thu Jul 16 19:15:58 2015 UTC,He tried getting to 18 before getting to 15.
ProGolf,3dgtjr,meyer_33_09,3,Thu Jul 16 19:47:06 2015 UTC,Tiger needs to get some psychiatric help ASAP.  He hits the ball well on the range. He plays well during practice rounds. But he makes bogey after bogey after bogey when it matters. Something is clearly wrong mentally.
ProGolf,3dgtjr,tesd44,4,Thu Jul 16 13:43:07 2015 UTC,By this evaluation I also need to seek treatment then. My range game is out of this world but the courses are different.
ProGolf,3dgtjr,jmt970,2,Thu Jul 16 13:47:49 2015 UTC,My range game is out of this world but the courses are different.   I hear this all the time. It's because it's a hell of a lot different when your misses have consequences and you've gotta go look for your ball in the woods instead of just reloading another one five seconds later.
ProGolf,3dgtjr,meyer_33_09,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:50:00 2015 UTC,"I think that's pretty natural for an amateur. But for a pro, especially of Tiger's caliber, not being able to transfer the work he does off of the course ONTO the course is pretty baffling and a much more serious issue, in my opinion, than the whole ""Process"" and ""swing change"" thing he claims is the issue."
ProGolf,3dgtjr,mreatsum,5,Thu Jul 16 14:12:11 2015 UTC,"He shouldn't have changed in swing the first time. What is it now, four different swings since he first played at Augusta? His swing was never the problem. I seriously question the PGA drug testing policy and his former family life for his downfall on the course."
ProGolf,3dgtjr,meyer_33_09,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:19:12 2015 UTC,"I think the initial swing change was necessary in that it was pretty stressful on his knees.   But I agree in the sense that the last few changes have been unnecessary and are a sign of Tiger being ignorant to the fact that the swing wasn't the problem, HE was the problem."
ProGolf,3dgtjr,mreatsum,2,Thu Jul 16 14:23:42 2015 UTC,"He needs to stop trying to be a ""Brady Bunch"" sponsors dream and get out and play with some blonds. Golf, Hank Haney, and blonds are Tigers ticket."
ProGolf,3dgtjr,ORazorr,0,Thu Jul 16 14:10:35 2015 UTC,Dead last in GIR.  He just needs to play and play and play.  And I think it'll eventually start transferring.

ProGolf,3dejw9,Yoshiman400,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:39:44 2015 UTC,and hopefully they don't ruin it by having the women's open there right after. they readily admitted they had to hold back the greens from getting as fast as they should have been to make sure they were fine for the girls. wasn't fair for the ladies either having thousands of divots all over a open course. great concept but piss poor reality.
ProGolf,3dejw9,omgshutthefuckup,1 point,Fri Jul 17 10:25:23 2015 UTC,"Huh, I never knew a men's green speed would generally be too fast for the women. I figured once you get into short game range, everyone hits the same shots, and even then, I thought maybe the women having slower ball speeds would be an advantage on faster greens. I totally understand and agree with the divot part though, you'd either have to make the course way too long or way too short (and you definitely can't mix and match the two too much) to avoid divots being an issue.  On the other hand, the women's tournament only played a bit harder overall and actually yielded a lot more lower rounds on Sunday. (Although Kaymer running away might have had something to do with it as well.) It's kind of a shame all the USGA stuff is tied to one network, because you might be able to do a good double dip with a couple of weeks between the two events without sending broadcasting crews in, out and then back in."
ProGolf,3dejw9,Yoshiman400,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:40:30 2015 UTC,"sorry, I could have been clearer. the truth is that in order to get lightning fast greens the grass must be in a sort of limbo between living and dying. basically you just don't water it for a couple of days and while not the healthiest green it will be the fastest. therefore greens take a week or two to recover from being brought down to us-open level quickness. if they had given the guys the hardest greens they could have,  there is too good a chance that the woman's tournament would have suffered. so Thursday/Friday night last year the usga elected to hose down the greens, opting for safety which is alright too"
ProGolf,3dejw9,omgshutthefuckup,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:02:13 2015 UTC,"Oh, so you're saying the USGA slowed the greens way down for the men, so they'd dry out in time to be optimally fast for the women? If so, that's interesting cause maybe that little bit of less speed helped contribute to the mens' scores being a bit lower. Still enjoyed both events, though."

Then they reset the points for the tour championship, meaning anyone can win it. A player could win 20 titles in a year and all the playoff events, but not the Fedex Cup if he finishes down the field in the Tour Championship.  The scoring system sucks."
ProGolf,3d4j6x,c-fox,5,Mon Jul 13 14:41:36 2015 UTC,"It beyond sucks, the FedEx Cup is total bullshit modeled on Nascar in a vain effort to attract new fans to the game of golf (cf. putting USGA events on Fox). They tinkered with the point system constantly after the inception of this nonsense, and it still hasn't taken. The players will say they care because they're paid to, and likewise the networks will keep highlighting FedEx Cup points and standings because they're paid to. It's not going to make the fans care. The players want to win, period, and majors in particular.   I haven't heard Spieth list the FedEx Cup on his list of priorities for the rest of the year, which are exactly two: the Open Championship, then, when that's done, the PGA Championship. The biennial team events might get an honorable mention, but we all know that golf is an individual sport, and that's how players forge their reputations and legacies. Shane Ryan made a good observation that players like Ian Poulter might make such a big deal about the Ryder Cup because they are compensating for their failure to excel where it counts, i.e., majors.  If the FedEx Cup has accomplished one thing, however, it's strengthened the fields of the so-called ""playoff"" events that occur after the PGA Championship. But this overall improvement has come at the detriment of individual players who play consistently well but might have gotten hot at the wrong time, FedEx Cup-wise. The bottom line is that the Tour is trying to create more ""franchise players"" who are widely recognizable beyond golf-fandom, but one of the great things about golf is how difficult it is to sustain excellence from week-to-week, and the FedEx Cup is trying to appeal to the shortest attention span."

ProGolf,3d4j6x,omgshutthefuckup,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:52:26 2015 UTC,This is the same in every sport. Some sports it's even harder. In football you can go undefeated all year and get knocked out in the first round if you have a bad game. That's why they have the playoffs. Just because someone has a great year they shouldn't be rewarded a championship if they suck the last 4 tournaments in the playoffs. If we are going to reward someone for having a great season then just cancel the playoffs and hand him the trophy.

Like all sports, winning the championship is not necessarily about being the best during the season, but being the best through the playoffs. The playoffs should count for more points because you are going against the best of the year. If it was only about how well Speith played through the whole year, then why even have the FedEx playoffs, just give him the trophy."
ProGolf,3d4j6x,NOLAblonde,3,Mon Jul 13 14:46:11 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. I definitely understand that point, and largely agree with it. We want the playoffs to mean something. However, I'm merely making the point that if Spieth manages to complete the Grand Slam, it would seem kind of absurd for someone else to win the FedEx Cup. In theory, someone who did not win on tour all year could get their first win at the Tour Championship and take the Cup over a guy who won all four majors that year."
ProGolf,3d4j6x,BARTELS-,3,Mon Jul 13 14:53:15 2015 UTC,"The good thing with golf is that most people tend to view the majors separately from the FedEx Cup. If Speith gets the Grand Slam most people won't care if he doesn't win the FedEx. Hell, even if he doesn't win The Open or the PGA I'm assuming his season will be remembered far more for the 2 majors than how he does in the FedEx."
ProGolf,3d4j6x,NOLAblonde,2,Mon Jul 13 14:56:20 2015 UTC,"Definitely. The Cup is nice, but all of those guys would give it up in a heartbeat for a major. And the fans feel the same way, I'd venture."

The only sports I watch outside of American sports is the World Cup and that also follows the theory of the ""regular season"" can only get you so far.

ProGolf,3d4j6x,Assumer,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:34:14 2015 UTC,"That's why I said ""regular season.""

ProGolf,3cuab7,MassageTeaser,5,Sat Jul 11 01:42:41 2015 UTC,I like Poults. He can be a bit bitchy but I like the fact that he shows some personality and emotion. I love Rory and Spieth but they're almost like robots.
ProGolf,3cuab7,PeteG1986,3,Sat Jul 11 00:46:30 2015 UTC,"I'm not a massive Rory fan but hurling his club in the water, stating that golf has stupid rules and saying that you prefer playing in totally clear conditions is not the behaviour of a robot.  On the other hand, claiming that you're on a level with Tiger when you've never even won a major isn't exactly the kind of personality I value."
ProGolf,3cuab7,EastofEgen,3,Sat Jul 11 01:04:25 2015 UTC,"First things first, I totally agree with your first point.  People want to act like they are holier than thou and judge a guy losing his temper (without hurting anyone), but all sorts would be pretty boring if a little personality didn't shine through.  As for your second point, I think you are totally wrong.  One you don't get to that level without thinking your the best and if you're not confident enough to say it out loud, it'll probably come back to hurt you in the Ryder Cup, and we all know that's all that matters to Poulter.  I still like him though, because of point one."
ProGolf,3cuab7,shpike66,1 point,Sat Jul 11 06:57:17 2015 UTC,"I get where you're coming from but personally I disagree with that. Obviously self belief is important, but Poulter believing he's better than every golfer except Tiger isn't self belief, it's self delusion. He's the same age as Tiger, but he has 0 majors compared to 14, 2 WGC's compared to 18, 16 wins compared to more than 100. By all means be confident in your own ability but claiming that he and Tiger are in some sort of league of their own is just demonstrably untrue and pretty disrespectful to other guys he plays with. Also, I don't really understand what you mean by it'll hurt you in the Ryder Cup if you don't make those claims out loud?   Also, do you honestly believe Poulter cares about the Ryder Cup that much? He definitely loves it, but I imagine he'd rather win majors than Ryder Cups."
ProGolf,3cuab7,EastofEgen,1 point,Sat Jul 11 10:01:19 2015 UTC,"The Ryder cup comment was just a sly dig at Poulter, since that seems to be the only time he shows up top play.  And I don't think he really believes what he says, but has sometimes lying to yourself at that level is okay.  Maybe he thinks if he says it enough it will be true.  Obviously, he's a long, long way from that though, but I doubt anyone takes real offense to it since they would all likely say the same thing."
ProGolf,3cuab7,shpike66,1 point,Sat Jul 11 14:34:47 2015 UTC,"He didn't say that he was on a level with Tiger. If you look at what he actually said it was this - ""Don't get me wrong, I respect everyone who is a professional. But the problem is I know I haven't played to my full potential yet. And when that happens it will just be me and Tiger.""  You'd probably find that well over half the world's top-50 would agree with him that if any of them played to what they felt their full potential was, they'd also be in the top-2. The other thing I'd suggest is that they're probably right as well. The issue that really defines such a statement though is the temporal range.   Last year Jim Furyk shot 59. Sergio hit a 29 for nine holes. Look at how Rickie played the final few holes of the Players. If that's their full potential, then they'd easily be top-2 if they were able to replicate it each week. Just about every golfer in the top-50 would achieve the same ranking if they could take the pick of their best form, bottle it, and then turn it on like a light switch on command.  To some extent Poulter is more guilty of stating the bleedin' obvious than anything else"
ProGolf,3cuab7,FarawayFairways,1 point,Sun Jul 12 08:08:44 2015 UTC,"I suppose the thing is that I don't believe Ian Poulter has anywhere near that much potential. He's not all that naturally gifted, he's passionate and ballsy and I respect him for that, but I disagree that he ever had the potential to play on a level with Tiger Woods. He wasn't even a scratch golfer when he turned pro, so when you look at it like that he hasn't underachieved or failed to meet his potential, he's overachieved hugely. I'm not saying I hate Poulter or anything like that, but I'm still not on board with his statement.   To me, playing your absolute best golf every week and living up to your potential are pretty different things. Obviously golfers aim to play well every round, but realistically it isn't going to happen and they know it, even world class golfers 'lose' a lot more often than they win, that doesn't mean they haven't lived up to potential."
ProGolf,3cuab7,EastofEgen,2,Sun Jul 12 09:43:06 2015 UTC,"IIRC, Poulter had just gone top-10 when he gave that interview. Now if he feels he's playing within himself, or had identified areas where he knew he could improve by 2 shots etc and didn't actually know yet where his performance ceiling was, I can easily see how an ambitious apex sportsman on an upward trajectory, could be seduced into thinking he had another 5%, and that when he found it, he'd continue overtaking other players. As i said, I suspect most of the world's top-50 would broadly agree with his sentiment about playing to their potential. It actually makes sense. If you've gone top-10 in the world without winning much, and have done so knowing that you're making mistakes, it isn't a blind leap of fantasy for an ambitious player to start thinking along the lines of how good I might actually be if I really click    What happened of course is that the media misquoted him, and the story of ""Tiger and me"" gained traction. He clearly never said what people think he said. Poulter wasn't to know it then, but he'd already hit his ceiling, but you can easily see how at a snapshot in time he wouldn't believe he had (nor should he have done either)  I suspect that in the fullness of time people will look back on Poulter more fondly as a character. I think it's worth drawing a paralell with tennis. Ask tennis fans for their favourite era, and most will name the likes of McEnroe, Borg, Conners, Nastase etc Today the game is suffering a little bit for a production line of anodyne corporate androids. If golf starts churning out similar characterless clean living types according to a mould, then we too will start to lose ground. We do need our more colourful characters and whereas Poulter might cause us to whince now and then, I wouldn't say he's a bad influence on golf, but I do worry about certain players drawing in inappropriate gallery inter-actions, and the danger that this could start to embed itself in the game if we aren't prepared to act on it"
ProGolf,3cuab7,FarawayFairways,0,Sun Jul 12 15:43:05 2015 UTC,"Woods hasn't won a single major either, he won 14 of them. I feel it's important to note that.   I've won as many majors as Poults."

First time I went out to play I snap hooked everything and shot a 104. I guess what I'm saying is if it didn't affect my game at all, why should it bother world #1?"
ProGolf,3crpvd,darkshadepigbottom,2,Fri Jul 10 18:28:39 2015 UTC,I had a meniscoid type lesion removed from my ankle in 2004.  They also removed an extra ligament that I had on the outside of my ankle at the time.    It took me three weeks (with therapy) to be able to put weight on the ankle.  It took three to four months for me to feel confident in putting that ankle down hard on the floor and it was nine months before I felt comfortable jumping on it and landing upon it.
ProGolf,3crpvd,Spockwouldbejealous,2,Fri Jul 10 14:48:54 2015 UTC,"Not completely the same, but I figure I can give some insight FWIW:  I play golf in college. I partially tore the same ligament in the same ankle playing basketball this past spring (you can imagine my coach's pride :) ). I could put virtually no weight on it for a couple days, even in a boot. Still, 2 weeks and a day after the injury, I was able to pop some ibuprofen and play in a tournament with not a terrible amount of discomfort. I didn't have a significant drop in distance maybe other than with the driver, and I don't think the ankle caused bad shots as much as the rustiness from time off did.  The key word here of course is that I ""partially"" tore it, so Rory's obviously is more serious. And, he has much more power than I, so the torque he puts on his ankle is certainly higher. Still, just thought I'd put it on the table."

Same thing could happen with Spieth. The guys that come in 2nd, 3rd, 4th when you have one of those run-away-with majors suddenly have much better odds when the players that tend to run away with them (Tiger, Rory) are out of the picture."

ProGolf,3ccdnz,Gamblingplease,-5,Tue Jul 7 00:54:36 2015 UTC,Nah Tiger is my favorite golfer. I'm not upset that Rory is the second best golfer in the world now behind only Spieth. I just only root for American golfers. Non Americans I dislike and root against.

ProGolf,3ccdnz,Rtuttle12,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:00:53 2015 UTC,So why does that stop you from rooting for a Non American player in an individual sport?
ProGolf,3ccdnz,dboti,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:04:39 2015 UTC,Just a choice. Sure there are one of two exceptions like Justin Rose and Ernie Els but the majority is American golfers.

ProGolf,3caiaz,yardstickgolf,6,Mon Jul 6 11:31:27 2015 UTC,"This is nothing.   At the municipal course I used to play (Tenison Park in Dallas), (reportedly) there used to be a kid who made his living playing there with just a Dr Pepper bottle tied to a broom stick. (Oh, the kid's name was Lee Trevino, and he made a somewhat better living once he got a full bag of clubs.)"
ProGolf,3caiaz,JustMe8,3,Mon Jul 6 18:59:57 2015 UTC,"I'm slightly curious about his choice of club? I remember Crenshaw smashing up a putter against Eamon Darcy I think it was in a Ryder Cup. IIRC, he elected to putt with a 1 iron. Well that kind of made sense. With it's closed face it was probably the nearest thing he had. I'm surprised Streb took a wedge though, albeit it didn't seem to do him any obvious harm"
ProGolf,3caiaz,FarawayFairways,7,Mon Jul 6 14:18:35 2015 UTC,The swing weight of a lob wedge is closest to a putter.
ProGolf,3caiaz,rgeckler,3,Mon Jul 6 16:11:46 2015 UTC,"He said it was his caddies choice for him as it had the most square leading edge of all his wedges. Any of the wedges would of worked but that gave him the best shot. Belly-ing(sp?) will get you closest to normal putter contact, feel and pace."
ProGolf,3caiaz,CaveBacon,2,Mon Jul 6 18:33:09 2015 UTC,"I've tried to track down the Crenshaw story. It was 1987 and he snapped his putter on the 6th hole. He solved it by playing with both his 1 iron and his sand wedge depending the type of putt he had to execute. IIRC he used the 1 iron for short putts and the wedge for longer attempts?  He lost by one hole, but was further behind when he snapped it, so I suppose you might say he improved"
ProGolf,3caiaz,FarawayFairways,-14,Mon Jul 6 21:37:20 2015 UTC,"He broke his putter in anger during the round I'm guessing,....so would not have been able to replace it during the round.  He did good with his wedge though.....and probably learned a lesson in anger management"
ProGolf,3caiaz,ShivasIrons983E,10,Mon Jul 6 13:56:19 2015 UTC,"Just tossed it to his bag and it fell apart, I heard."
ProGolf,3caiaz,kelticslob,-19,Mon Jul 6 14:13:45 2015 UTC,"No,...he must have slammed it into the ground or something first.  If the club is broken just putting it back in the bag,in the normal course of play,he could have replaced it.  He must have done something to it."
ProGolf,3caiaz,ShivasIrons983E,7,Mon Jul 6 14:16:32 2015 UTC,"You are wrong here. I was listening to the tournament on my drive Sunday and they clearly covered the situation. Tossing your putter to the bag is not considered ""normal course of play"" which is why he couldn't replace it mid round. It was not done out of anger, just a bit of bad luck, though he made the best of it."
ProGolf,3caiaz,thelastofthemohicans,-10,Mon Jul 6 18:07:46 2015 UTC,"How was I wrong? I said he must have broken it somehow other than in the normal course of play,.....I speculated that it might be out of anger,but that point is moot,.....it just doesn't matter.  He did it outside the normal manner of play. Tossing a club isn't considered normal,therefore he couldn't replace it. He must have tossed it hard enough to fuck it up at some point....or whomever is building his clubs are fuckwits,because they just don't fall apart with a casual toss."
ProGolf,3caiaz,ShivasIrons983E,5,Mon Jul 6 18:25:13 2015 UTC,"Not trying to get into a back and forth but Kelticslob said he ""just tossed it to his bag"" which was correct. You said ""No,...he must have slammed it into the ground or something first"" which was incorrect. You also continued to push the idea that it was done out of anger or frustration which wasn't the case.  That's why I said you were wrong, but my apologies if I misunderstood what you were saying."
ProGolf,3caiaz,thelastofthemohicans,-10,Mon Jul 6 18:36:57 2015 UTC,"Did they let him replace the club? No.  So he broke it. THAT IS ACCORDING TO THE RULE...and the only thing I care about. An official obviously judged he broke it in the toss.  I never once said he DID IT in anger,.....I said he might have done so,.....I never saw the incident. Maybe an official saw him slam the club into the ground or his foot prior to the toss.....who knows,who cares,....an official judged it to be out of the ordinary course of play.  If you toss or slam clubs,...that's a risk you take....damage,breakage,or playing characteristics altered"
ProGolf,3caiaz,ShivasIrons983E,2,Mon Jul 6 20:05:27 2015 UTC,I never once said he DID IT in anger   you actually did say that earlier   He broke his putter in anger during the round I'm guessing
ProGolf,3caiaz,Instantiated,-7,Mon Jul 6 22:59:01 2015 UTC,"I never said he did....I said I'm guessing.  What part of ""I'm guessing"" don't you fuckwits understand?  Down vote me all you want you fucking twats.....a curse on all of you,.....may you all 3 putt every fucking green you walk on,shank every fucking iron,.....and slice every drive 100 yds into OB"
ProGolf,3caiaz,ShivasIrons983E,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:09:59 2015 UTC,"I didn't downvote you  Saying ""X is true, I'm guessing"", means you take the opinion and are of the position that X is true.   So your entire position after that stems from the fact that you believe he did it out of anger, you guess.   So yea, by saying you guess he did it, means that you believe he did it, which means you did say it.  Does that make sense?"
ProGolf,3caiaz,Instantiated,2,Tue Jul 7 00:10:06 2015 UTC,He did say this was the third time that putter broke. I wonder if he will switch shafts.

The show isn't about the flag. The car isn't about the flag. That's just something thats on the car.   Here's how we should treat the flag: it's use should be discouraged.

Then Lindsay leaves in early 2015 and he goes through struggles until this week right after allegations about a relationship with Mrs. Duff.

But otherwise, it's great. The only issue I have is when he covers the Ryder Cup towards the end - the results of that tournament are obviously well known so this isn't a spoiler, but in talking about Tom Watson, I felt like Ryan was a bit...disrespectful. He's admittedly not a lifetime golf fan and though I'm sure he knows who Watson is and his legacy, he talked more smack about him than I thought Watson deserves - he might not be a great coach/captain but he's one of the best golfers of all time and seemingly a great guy too.   That was my only quibble though. I think I read the whole book in two or three days."
ProGolf,3bvi7c,greebytime,1 point,Thu Jul 2 22:18:28 2015 UTC,"Worth remembering who the last American was to successfully captain a Ryder Cup team in Europe too?  Whilst I'm at it (don't know if the interview screened in America) but straight after his closing round in the USPGA, Sky did an interview with Mickelson that involved throwing him a friendly and easy question to sign off on (they held the broadcast rights in Europe so were doubtless trying to use it to build things up a bit). Suffice to say Mickelson gave a strange answer. When they cut back to the studio Paul McGinley was sitting there with a great big grin across his face. He knew the significance of what Mickelson said (or failed to say). The American team was fractured before it ever got to Gleneagles. Lee Trevino made a similar observation earlier this week about player appetite"
ProGolf,3bvi7c,FarawayFairways,1 point,Fri Jul 3 09:45:35 2015 UTC,What did he say?
ProGolf,3bvi7c,Robkmil,1 point,Fri Jul 3 11:20:49 2015 UTC,"Remember in finishing 2nd at Valhalla he'd just qualified for the Ryder Cup, you might have expected it to be at the forefront of his mind, after all it was by then only 6 weeks away. He was asked what future challenges he was looking forward to. Under normal circumstances you'd have expected him to nominate the Ryder Cup? As one of America's leading totems, I would have expected that, and clearly the interviewer (and McGinley) did.   Instead he said he really wanted to represent America in ..... the Olympics!!! and how much he thought he'd like to add a gold medal to his collection. He didn't mention the cup once, it didn't even register with him. McGinley had a massive smile on his face and raised an eyebrow. He knew straight away the significance of what Phil had said. Then about 2 weeks before the cup his PR machine went to work telling us how committed he was to the cup and how it meant everything to him etc Yeah .... like when Tom Watson blocked out two days at Gleneagles in July for a reconnaisance round on the course just after the Scottish Open. 25 American players were invited. 2 turned up (Furyk & Bradley). Mickelson was one of those who played at Aberdeen (along with Fowler and Walker). Aberdeen is about 2 hours drive from Gleangles and about 35 mins by helicopter. They weren't interested though.   There's a lot of reasons why America keeps losing the cup, but I'm equally confident they could put it right once they embrace the new generation. Ask yourself this though, is there any other team sport you can think of where the captain/ coach doesn't select the players? The best 12 players needn't make the best team. If I were the PGA I'd be looking at selecting all 12 and building a team around the emerging generation. That would frighten Europe. Send out Phil, Tiger, Jim, and even Bubba again, and we really aren't scared of them"
ProGolf,3bvi7c,FarawayFairways,4,Fri Jul 3 11:44:56 2015 UTC,"Most of the best golfers is the world are American, look at the rankings and history. The reason we don't win the Ryder Cup as often is because we just don't care as much. Europe rallies together with this whole ""beat America"" goal, and as a result it clearly means much more to them...also it seems like a lot of Europeans have a chip on their shoulder towards the USA, so the Ryder Cup garners a lot more media hype and build up for the Europeans....hopefully this changes in the future, because The Ryder Cup has the potential to be some of the most exciting golf"
ProGolf,3bvi7c,detailorient,1 point,Fri Jul 3 12:04:14 2015 UTC,"I think there's a lot of truth in that, and it's why I also feel that the PGA is missing a trick here in not recognising that it has something of a USP. At it's very best, team matchplay is compelling and fast moving. It's a fantastic shop window for golf. The American sporting landscape is dominated by domestic competitions. Golf is one of the few major sports that has an international team event where the US competes with expectation of winning (the Olympics is a little bit too abstract I think to call it a team event given that it crosses something like 27 different sports).   I think the Ryder Cup is coming to a crossroads. There have been sports in the past which America used to dominate (heavywight boxing, mens tennis, track athletics etc) but as their grip on these sports waned, people stopped watching them (viewing figures rather than stadium fill).   I read alot before Gleneagles about how Tiger had to play for viewing figures (apparently in all seriousness). My own suspicion is that the American sports fan will embrace success and similarly turn away from failure. A team that wins with Jordan, Rickie, & Dustin to the fore would be even more powerful I reckon. Especially if it all comes down to the last putt!!! The question is how many more failures will America absorb before she turns her back?  I should also point out that 'team Europe' is 36 years old, but is still made up largely from the rump of the old GB & Ireland team, plus Spain with Sweden. There's only ever been 11 players represent Europe outside of these four countries. Despite having a population of 80M, Germany has only ever produced two players in this period. The Molinari family has produced more than the rest of Italy, and it's only very, very recently that the French have shown signs of getting interested in the game. It simply isn't played at all in eastern Europe. The development of the European team therefore is likely to follow the games spread in non-traditional countries. America surely has to move to its next generation who you detect possess more of an appetite for the event then the one that's offering to go over the horizon now"
ProGolf,3bvi7c,FarawayFairways,1 point,Fri Jul 3 13:34:51 2015 UTC,"That's a great point about golf being one of the only international sports that Americans are interested in....I personally love the Ryder Cup, but there's no denying it's taken more seriously by the Euros....here's to hoping to a brighter, more competitive future RC!"
ProGolf,3bvi7c,detailorient,1 point,Fri Jul 3 14:27:25 2015 UTC,"It deserves it's own sub to be honest, but golf could become 'the' outlet (almost uniquely) for America to express a national team sport identity through. The PGA should be all over the Ryder Cup, and that also means getting the players to attach a level of importance that so many of the golf fans do. There is no way that the likes of Kenny Perry, Chad Campbell, Anthony Kim, Stewart Cink, Ben Curtis, Boo Weekley or BJ Holmes are golf legends, but it just shows what you can achieve when you have a hungry team that genuinely wants it, rather than one that just trades in soundbite patriotism, or a media that builds the event around a single player."
ProGolf,3bvi7c,FarawayFairways,1 point,Fri Jul 3 19:29:07 2015 UTC,"The thing is...after a long and grueling Fedex cup and fall finish, guys like Phil and Tiger don't really want to cross the ocean for an 'exhibition' match.

ProGolf,3bvi7c,Robkmil,1 point,Fri Jul 3 13:40:24 2015 UTC,"No. You'd have to have been watching European television to have seen it. One caveat however was that Tiger Woods was still under consideration at the time the interview was given. Perhaps Phil became more interested in the cup once Tiger withdrew?  The Ryder Cup is a big part of the Sean Ryan's love of golf though. I think I'm correct in saying he regards it as the best sporting event in the world, or if he were allowed to cover one single event, that would be the one he'd choose.  I tend to agree. It has all the ingredients that great events need. I should point out incidentally, that ticket sales by country of origin for Gleneagles shed another little reported light on this global event. Two of the countries in the top 8 didn't even play in the event (Canada and Australia). I'm sure it's one of golf's best showcases and that it's being undersold"

When they cut back to the studio the panel were a little bit surprised and tried to spin it for Phil by saying what a great professional he was setting himself these long term goals, what focus he has etc  McGinley for his part practically had his fist rammed down his throat trying to prevent himself from laughing and celebrating. Here he was, 6 weeks away from leading a Ryder Cup team out at Gleneagles, and all America's premier senior pro could think about was how good he'd look with a gold medal round his neck in 2016  I thought Tom showed dignity at the subsequent press conference    I think there's an issue about genuine passion and press releases put out by your agent in order to massage your public image. Detailorient is correct I believe when he says that the cup means more in Europe. America needs to generate the same level of appropriate passion and you can't do this through PR or shaving USA into your hair. It isn't restricted to Europe though, the rest of the world also adopts team Europe, so the chip on the shoulder accusation needs to be extended across the globe.   I do think however that there is a generation coming through to whom the cup means more and that America will start to see the benefit of this young breed"

Consequently they called it what it is, ""The Open Championship of Golf"", as they clearly had a requirement to open it up to everyone in an attempt to generate prize money to support the purchase of a red Moroccan leather belt with silver buckle. Indeed, in 1871 they had to cancel because they couldn't get a prize together. It was only in 1872 that they raised enough funds to get a claret jug made (wasn't ready in time and was first awarded in 1873).   In 1860 America was slipping into civil war and the telephone hadn't even been invented. It was always going to be a small field, so I think it's perfectly understandable how the name came into existance. Indeed, you might argue that it's under-stated, as they didn't try and call it a 'World' championship or anything, they actually used a very descriptive title which was probably an attempt to invite people to participate more than anything  Just by way of trivia caveat, a couple of the holes that were played in 1860 at Prestwick are still there today. A few of the others have only been altered marginally. Prestwick last hosted in 1924 which might have been a blessing in disguise for it had the effect of locking it in time and shielding it from some of the design paradigms that followed. The consequence is that its an adorably quirky course in places, lifted  straight out of the 19th century"

ProGolf,3ay576,stone_solid,3,Wed Jun 24 18:32:08 2015 UTC,"growing pains. They really want to pull it off and are putting in tons of money and effort to do it. They need to work on their presentation, but they are paying for all kinds of advancements that NBC never thought worth their time. This was the first year that the USGA had laser data (drive distance and distance to hole) on every hole at the Men's and Women's. This is the first year that you will see the putting break during the Senior and Women's. Fox helped make that happen. This is also the most TV coverage the open has ever. Yeah some of it was sketchy, but it was 12 hours of  coverage a day, as opposed to NBC's primetime mentality. They'll figure it out."
ProGolf,3b59of,golfpinotnut,4,Fri Jun 26 02:10:00 2015 UTC,"She knows her golf - Fox misused her by relegating her to a useless role where all she COULD do was smile, ask inane questions and then have them cut away. (She also seems to have decided to look trashier and more stripper-esque in the last few years, which, you know, god bless - but I'm not sure it's helping her career-wise. Those eyelashes are comical, and the blogger who compared her to Madison Ivy wasn't wrong.)   I'm not clear that ""sideline reporters"" EVER add much to the mix, and that's essentially what they had her doing here (and will do on the football field with her later this season) but sad that she's solely now being used for her physical assets, when at least with golf, she genuinely knows her shit."

It is an insult to all of us to suggest that the reason she's there is because of her reporting skills or her insight on the game.  Instead, we get these fluffy interview pieces where they've set her in front of the camera in the most unflattering way. I do sincerely think that Fox screwed up by not making her look hotter.  They've got this vivacious personality, and they've given us the worst camera angle that they possibly could.  In my mind, it is another solid example of how Fox screwed up the broadcast.  At least ESPN -- when they're giving us Pam Oliver or Erin Andrews on the sidelines -- does a better job of selling the question-girl as a serious reporter type who happens to be attractive.  Fox gave us the opposite. I make no apologies for recognizing the fail."

A lot of awkward silences, I agree completely with the article.  Especially so the point of the lack of seeing the balls land.    That said, I do remember a couple of years ago when Faldo started commentating.  It was difficult to watch at first since this was a new role for him.  He has gotten much better at it and I look forward to listening to him because he does have an insight that most other commentators do not.  I also love how Miller has no qualms about calling it like it is, and does so frequently.  Norman could use a lot of polishing in that area.   Overall, I felt the Fox coverage was lacking.

ProGolf,3as4nq,scoobyru1,17,Tue Jun 23 01:52:21 2015 UTC,The US Open coming to this course was a mistake from the very beginning. I really don't mind the course playing hard and the greens being ridiculous. It's the US Open. Deal with it. The only part that bothered me was the fans not being able to see the event they paid to attend especially when this course was supposedly designed for the US Open.
ProGolf,3as4nq,Rtuttle12,7,Tue Jun 23 03:22:31 2015 UTC,"This is excellent perspective, and a viewpoint that we certainly wouldn't get from any other media source.  Really makes me wonder about the decision to dry out the course by the USGA.  Great insights, thanks."
ProGolf,3as4nq,4par,10,Tue Jun 23 02:49:47 2015 UTC,"Definitely an honest assessment, and I think fairly accurate.  I'm from New England, and looking at that course was like looking at the moon.  On one hand, the architecture is so dramatic and compelling.  On the other, a lot of the hate was justified.  Perfect shots being criminally penalized, and perfect putts not dropping (should NEVER happen in a major).  Handled differently, I think this course would immediately go into my top five bucket list courses."
ProGolf,3as4nq,ORazorr,-3,Tue Jun 23 02:53:39 2015 UTC,"Perfect shots being criminally penalized, and perfect putts not dropping   I see what you're trying to say.  But if they missed, then they weren't perfect shots.    It may not be ""fair"" when a ball lands a few feet from the pin, then slowly rolls & rolls until it's off the green or into a hazard, but that's how the course was setup."
ProGolf,3as4nq,bl1ndvision,2,Tue Jun 23 13:59:50 2015 UTC,"I think my bigger problem in terms of perfect shots being criminally penalized is what happened on either 16 or 17, whichever was the ~330 yard par 4. The hole slopes left to right, hard. You can hit a literally perfect drive drawing into the left side of the fairway, and there's literally no way to stop it from rolling all the way across the fairway down into the bunker. Sure, Ernie Els holed out from the bunker for eagle, and a few fortunate souls were able to carry it onto the green, but that hole just didn't feel like it was playing like a golf hole should play."
ProGolf,3as4nq,jpole1,1 point,Tue Jun 23 14:57:48 2015 UTC,"Jordan Spieth and several others did just that on 16. It wasn't impossible but if you went for the green instead of the little landing area,  it had a good chance of going in the bunker. They require precise tee shots -  that's the US Open. Collin Montgomery's putt that dove away from the hole at the last second was more disconcerting. That shouldn't have happened."
ProGolf,3as4nq,Spfeifer,8,Wed Jun 24 04:04:12 2015 UTC,"I feel like I am the only one that loved it being played there this year. I thought the course looked gorgeous. I wasn't too enthused with the putts jumping from time to time, but most people have blown that WAY out of proportion. The vast majority of the putts rolled true. Yes, I understand that the spectator experience wasn't great, but I knew that was going to be the case a long time ago. It's why I never considered going. Besides, thousands of people go to the event, millions watch it on TV. People keep saying that it was a disaster because the spectators had a sub-par experience. That's BS. Obviously the USGA wants the spectator experience to be better than it was, but that is a relatively small thing. 99% of the people that wanted to watch it were able to. Great course, great drama. I don't know what else you could ask for in a US Open."
ProGolf,3as4nq,Pappy091,3,Tue Jun 23 13:58:40 2015 UTC,"I was there on Sunday. I like the points about the color of the course,  and the idea that they should have shown off what the Pacific NW really looks like. There are so many beautiful golf courses and views that could be showcased. In general,  the course is amazing in person,  though.   That being said,  the playability was the same for everyone, and I get that they want perfect greens. That,  I agree, could be fixed. More than that, they could have given more grandstand seats for 50,000 or so people. It was so hard to see the players and follow a group you had to find a place to sit all day. The 18th had 8,000 seats that were full 5 hours before the last group teed off. We sat on the 16th and luckily it had a major effect on the tournament like we hoped. I loved seeing people play through on the driveable hole. Epic.   I'd like to hear other people's experiences too!  The hunger we have up here for this kind of event was not satiated by one trip up. They need to come up again soon. The sales and volunteer records show that."

ProGolf,3as4nq,what-the-what-what,3,Tue Jun 23 15:46:52 2015 UTC,"Here's my two cents:  Normally Chambers is greener but it's not Augusta. The course is fescue grass which has a different natural color but yes, the PGA cut back on watering and burned out the course like they have done for all recent U.S. Opens.  Most golf analysts say it'll be back and even Mike Davis (head of PGA) said they'd like to come back. The most important part though is they made a ton of money and companies follow the gravy train. The 2015 iteration set new merchandise sold records.  Personally, I enjoyed the course and the experience but I knew what to expect in terms of topography and viewing experience because I've played the course before. Even with the elevation changes, I found plenty of places where I was 10-15 feet from golf shots. You needed to get around and find what worked for you. I imagine they'll level out some of the berms to improve the experience for next time. The planning is probably already underway.  Above the criticism is the fact that Chambers is an incredibly unique place, in a gorgeous setting, and the course just is draws you in.  The best part and strongest argument for the U.S. Open coming back is the main problems (green surfaces and spectator viewing) can be easily fixed.  I look forward to it returning. I'm not guaranteeing it's will but the criticism is overrated."

Now that Chambers Bay is ""the NW course"", the region may be screwed from them coming back, idk."

I agree they were a bit anal on where you could stand and watch,  I mean at the masters you can get extremely close.   The tv cameras didn't do the greens justice on color, it was more green in person, and the greens being bumpy isn't right, but at the same time if this was at the British open they would be like ""oh bumpy greens are a part of the old heritage of golf in Scotland"" or something like that and just shrug it off.   And we've had a crazy dry June this year, last year it rained for most of the US open week, so I think they had to keep it dry in preparation of a classic PNW spontaneous rainstorm that would have made the grass more slow,  and when it didn't rain they just kept it dry to make it harder.  Just my take on it, I loved going I got to see all my idols growing up. I mean I saw Tiger Woods walk by me about 5 yards away, it was a dream come true."

This bodes well for a links style golf course like St. Andrews.  2) His lag putting is the best in the world. St. Andrews has some of (if not the) largest greens in the world. If he's 60 feet from the hole, he can reliably get in with two putts.  3) Plenty of fairway to work with if his driving gets shaky. The first alone is almost 100 yards wide. 4) He will not beat himself. What impressed me the most about his win at Chambers Bay was that he immediately bogeyed the first with a three putt. He played like shit until the 6th, where he started getting into a better rhythm and giving himself birdie opportunities. But he didn't a drop a shot even when he was struggling and soon began to capitalize on his chances. His emotional composure under pressure and the ability to grind out an under par round is the most impressive thing about him. He will never let a round go completely off the rails; this is what made Tiger so successful. He will have to be beaten, and there aren't many that can do that. 5) He has a sense for history and pulls off the right shots when he needs to. He's been on Tour for three years and, just off the top of my head, he has: holed a bunker shot at the John Deere to get into a playoff, holed an impossible putt to extend the playoff at the Wyndham, holed a putt to make it into a playoff at the Valspar, holed putt to make it into the playoff at the Shell Houston, holed a putt at Colonial to be part of a playoff if Kirk bogeyed the last (he did not). Basically, he's clutch, and if he has a putt for the win or to enter a playoff, he will make it. 6) He won with his B game at Chambers. He said this himself and it was evident in the statistics: he averaged nearly four putts more than normal over the tournament and still won. If he has his A game (which he does more often than not), only a few people in the world can beat him. You could even make the argument that only one person can beat Spieth when he's on his A game. That person is Rory Mcilroy."
ProGolf,3aq22t,FarawayFairways,3,Tue Jun 23 05:24:24 2015 UTC,"He will be up there with Rory as a favorite no doubt. The way he has played this year has been remarkable and I think he will be competitive on any course. However, I haven't seen a great deal of him in the wind so if the weather get's a bit nasty it could make things interesting. Oosthuizen won the last time the Open was played at St Andrews and he looks in great form, so I think Spieth will have his work cut out for him."
ProGolf,3aq22t,cheetahlip,3,Mon Jun 22 19:03:21 2015 UTC,"I don't think he'll have any problem with the course at St Andrews. The greens are massive and few hit long putts better than Jordan. Also the yardage brings it back to most players, albeit the recent trend has been for longer hitters to over power it. The secret normally is to keep it in play, as finding a bunker (particularly a fairway bunker) is nearly always a dropped shot. I also tend to think Jordan will go well at Troon next year, albeit a few young American hot shots have come over for their first taste of links in the past and gotten smashed up by Troon (Jack and Tiger both got battered at the 11th - both would go onto win at St Andrews too). There is perhaps a cautionary note there, but his course management is good, and I think a young Jordan is better equipped than a young Tiger or young Jack for that matter  I'd have said of all the Open venues St Andrews will suit him more than any. The bigger threat might come from the hype and the inevitable encroachment of the corporate people who'll increasingly demand a piece of him"
ProGolf,3aq22t,coffeesleeve,2,Mon Jun 22 19:37:27 2015 UTC,"he's fairly long and hits a draw....I'm sure he knows the ""texas wedge"" which is always a key shot at the old course....it'll translate."
ProGolf,3aq22t,ExactlyUnlikeTea,2,Thu Jun 25 18:39:15 2015 UTC,He is very impressive. I think his latest performance shows he can handle the links at St. Andrews.

ProGolf,3aq22t,Agent_Switters,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:16:36 2015 UTC,"The only remarkable part of his game is his long putting, but he is so steady and so consistent- and three putts are so damn expensive for tour players!- that he almost never plays himself out of a tournament.  I think he will do well at St. Andrews.  McIlroy at his sharpest is better. Much better. But he (McIlroy) spends a lot of his time at far less than his sharpest."
ProGolf,3aq22t,byingling,2,Tue Jun 23 19:30:43 2015 UTC,You and I must be watching different McIlroys
ProGolf,3aq22t,Agent_Switters,1 point,Thu Jul 2 13:37:13 2015 UTC,"Curious, why? Because you think McIlroy spends a lot of time playing his best? Or because you think McIlroy at his best is not  much better than Spieth?  To me, McIlroy can at times be as unassailable as Tiger was in the early 00s. But he certainly hasn't spent years at a stretch playing at that level. He misses cuts. He shoots 76. But when he is on for 4 days, he can demolish the field- just like young Tiger. While Spieth won handily this year at Augusta, I don't see him as quite as stunning or amazing as McIlroy can be and Tiger once was. But I think McIlroy will continue to have his 'off' periods. We won't see a ten year stretch of dominance, but we will see brilliant flashes over a 10 year period.  Of course, this could all be hogwash. Well, in fact, it is. It's sports opinion. Not much worth less."

ProGolf,3ar475,Zemulon,3,Mon Jun 22 22:09:14 2015 UTC,"...and 8 players still finished under par, five more than the previous three years combined.  The USGA realized that Chambers Bay wasn't going to be as tough as they originally thought.  That fescue and those Tatooine sized sand traps didn't really factor into the outcome that much because the fairways were so wide, and the players were playing those backstops behind the greens perfectly.  The USGA prides itself on U.S. Open courses being so tough, they had to bake the greens to avoid a repeat of Congressional, when they got slammed for the course being too easy.  Tight fairways, trees, strategically placed water hazards, and five inch high rough is all you need to challenge tour players.  There are plenty of old school courses that provide all that.  Getting on the green should be a reward for players, not a punishment."

ProGolf,3ansov,Twoto2,35,Mon Jun 22 00:59:32 2015 UTC,"Let me tell you - I went to the tournament Friday and Sunday.  Today, I walked the perimeter of the course. I started at the 1895 Club (hospitality pavilion near the 13th fairway), and it took about two hours.  Do you know how many golf shots I saw during that two hours?  Maybe 20.  To me, the biggest reason they shouldn't come back to Chambers Bay is because the experience for the fan was just horrible.  You couldn't take up position along the edge of a fairway and watch shots.  If you wanted to watch shots hit into a green, your options were to sit in the grandstand.  Walking between holes offered no views of the course.  Sadly, the best viewing spots were probably along the perimeter of the course from above, but you were watching from hundreds of yards away.  I had Sunday tickets for the US Open - I traveled 3000 miles to attend, and I left three hours early so I could watch the end on television.  EDIT - Gracias por el oro.  Also, I expounded upon this a little over on /r/golf here if you're interested.  EDIT 2 - I just remembered why I like it better here than at /r/golf - a bunch of sniveling little shits over there,"
ProGolf,3ansov,golfpinotnut,7,Mon Jun 22 03:53:39 2015 UTC,"That's why they're going back. Not a stellar course architecturally, but Torrey is easy to set up and good for fans."
ProGolf,3ansov,ExactlyUnlikeTea,6,Mon Jun 22 04:24:37 2015 UTC,"To come back, they need two things; one is wait for the Poa to take over, and properly maintain it as the surface like many other west coast golf courses. That should take 20 years at least. Second, they need to knock down some of the mounds for better fan experiences, even if it would sacrifice the original interest of the site. Course otherwise is very good I think."
ProGolf,3ansov,ExactlyUnlikeTea,6,Mon Jun 22 05:21:28 2015 UTC,"I agree on the poa, pure poa greens are so money. I played a tournament in Bremerton, within an hour from Chambers Bay, with poa greens and they were rolling 13 and pure. Funny enough, some dude named Spieth won that tournament too."

ProGolf,3ansov,ExactlyUnlikeTea,1 point,Mon Jun 22 06:38:26 2015 UTC,"That's because those greens were brand new, less than a few years old. There simply isn't an easy way to keep Poa out, and it's basically impossible to keep it out completely, especially in the Pacific Northwest. Letting it grow in would be a better option, or I have heard they could plant Poa perennia, which is different than annua, and those would coexist much better."

I realize that this is new territory for them and they should get better over the coming years, but some of the mistakes were just so obvious and easily correctable."

The PNW has had little rain and this is what happens to our grass out here with little rain.   People really need to respect the course and the country that it is at. This is a British style course, who cares if it isnt your normal US open."
ProGolf,3an731,CiscoCertified,6,Mon Jun 22 06:35:52 2015 UTC,"They're bumpy as shit and unpredictable. This brings too much luck into putting...The greens were in dog shit condition and it was a joke that Mike Davis had to lie all week about it being in ""championship condition""  I guarantee you the greens at real links courses overseas look a hell of a lot better for The Open  all of this ""this is PNW grass"" excuses are bullshit, and if it's the truth well then your grass sucks!"
ProGolf,3an731,detailorient,1 point,Mon Jun 22 11:29:14 2015 UTC,"One issue is that it isn't true links.   The quarry has been shaped for the course and the setup this week is uniformly considered 'tricked out'.  Good golf is not enough and there are a number of pins where ridiculous (but actually not hard) putts up hills is wrong directions are required.  The other issue of different green grasses growing at different speeds throughout the day and some greens being mud and dry grass only exacerbate the issue.  That said, the guy who is playing the best golf in the world right not won."
ProGolf,3an731,GnarlyBear,3,Mon Jun 22 19:22:59 2015 UTC,"I get why he was frustrated (despite shooting a 67, I believe) and I think he should be able to vent and do what he wants on the green...but complaining about it doesn't solve anything - and it didn't stop Spieth, Louis, DJ, etc., from going four and five under.   I don't think it's okay for golfers to expect pristine, perfect conditions on every course. The beauty of the sport is that talent, setup and tee boxes not withstanding, we all play by the same rules and in essence play the same game (with vastly different results). While I don't expect these guys to play on greens with tire marks from carts like some Munis I play, but a few bumpy greens isn't the end of the world.  Frankly, Brandt Snedeker has the biggest reason to complain - his ball shot straight up in the air halfway through his putt on the back nine. Never seen that, and Fox didn't replay it close up, so my guess is THAT green had something horribly wrong with it and they didn't want to draw more attention to it."
ProGolf,3an731,greebytime,7,Mon Jun 22 18:11:44 2015 UTC,"As if these guys aren't humans like us who get frustrated, just like us.

ProGolf,3ailcq,Caecilius_McBamf,13,Sat Jun 20 15:18:56 2015 UTC,What he said about the course not being spectator friendly is absolutely true. I'm literally at the course writing this from one of the lounges because you can't see jack shit out there as a spectator. The only thing you can do is park your ass on one of the most uncomfortable bleachers ever and watch the players from over 100 yards away. I'm honestly pretty choked I paid over $1000 between airfare and tickets just to sit here and watch it on a TV screen.

I had a hard time seeing anything, as all hills seemed roped off, and you couldn't get close to tee boxes etc. It also didn't help that the sky was white when I was there, and the yellow grass makes it extremely hard to pick the ball up in the air.

ProGolf,3ailcq,Thugalsby,3,Sun Jun 21 13:24:34 2015 UTC,I agree with this. Chambers is not spectator friendly but over the week the USGA has opened up more and more of the course. There's a spot on 11 that I parked for quite a while and was 10-20 feet from most 2nd shots. There are some spots that are bad and some that are very good but overall it's not the most accessible spectator course. They'll learn from this event and make the experience better for the next time.

For one, it makes you realize these guys are human. Two, it's going to make for an interesting Sunday, lots of contention for the lead, anything could happen.

ProGolf,3ailcq,ExactlyUnlikeTea,4,Sat Jun 20 20:05:36 2015 UTC,You think Chambers is easier then Torrey Pines?
ProGolf,3ailcq,InHoc12,6,Sun Jun 21 01:12:47 2015 UTC,"Definitely. Torrey has many trees and rough to snarl me and my wayward drives. Chambers I can hit the fairways and run shots onto greens. Remember, they're playing Chambers far longer and somewhat faster than normal. They're also playing it as a par 70, when for everyday play it's a par 72. Those two strokes make a hell of a difference. This week as well the winner will not be the only one under par unless they really tuck the pins tomorrow. In Torrey 2008 Tiger and Rocco were both the only people under par at -1. There were a few others at even par. Chambers, to boot, is way more interesting of a course architecturally. I'd never travel for Torrey- there's better courses within a few miles of where I live."
ProGolf,3ailcq,ExactlyUnlikeTea,1 point,Sun Jun 21 02:58:46 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, I just ask cause I live in San Diego and play Torrey a few times a year and have never found it particularly challenging.

ProGolf,3ailcq,InHoc12,1 point,Tue Jun 23 00:43:32 2015 UTC,"110 isn't a bad score. I think I could shoot that at Torrey after a few rounds, or would like I think so anyway. Chambers I could make actual birdies though, provided the correct tees. If I played the very back tees at Chambers, I'd get shit on, but from say 6200-6500 yards it's a scoreable course for the amateur."

ProGolf,3ailcq,ExactlyUnlikeTea,1 point,Sun Jun 21 21:28:33 2015 UTC,"I didn't explain myself well -  I meant did you find it considerably easier than Bethpage Black?  I haven't played the Black Course (although I have played another one of the courses at the park) but I know the layout and yes, it is a very thin course.  But it's a completely different style of course, so I don't know where the comparison starts - if you're hitting the ball well, how hard of a course is Chambers Bay?  And how is it in comparison to Bethpage?  (for the record, I'm not an excellent golfer - breaking 100 is a good day playing from the blues)."
ProGolf,3ailcq,IN_THE_KLOUDS,2,Sun Jun 21 21:40:20 2015 UTC,"It would depend on the strengths of the player in question, but a wider playing corridor will always be huge for the weaker player.

You can just go out on your first round and expect greatness like others.  This cup has been difficult and close. We are seeing golf at its finest.   I also live in Seattle and deal with fescue grass daily. I'm shocked that the players are having an issue with it. Fescue is standard operations in the PNW.

When he has complete freedom and a budget he designs stunning courses...I think you can ask him a thing or two."
ProGolf,3ailcq,BenyLava,4,Sat Jun 20 20:28:09 2015 UTC,"Actually, correction: he thinks any contour on greens is ridiculous. Player on green design:  ""Golf architects are making courses too tough and greens too undulating. I've been around professional golf for a long time, and believe me, there's nothing more irritating to professional golfers than playing on undulating greens. If it irritates professional golfers, can you imagine how it irritates the weekend golfer?   When a golf architect has to make undulating greens to make it a test, he's a poor architect. Anyone can make a 6,000-yard course tough if you put in undulating greens. But it takes a special architect to make a course where your greens are soft and friendly and yet it's still a good test.""  First off, I love putting. It's my favorite part of the game. I do not want flat greens, and neither do the pros. Spieth said at The Masters he likes seeing the lines on a course. If the lines are all straight it's boring.   Second, he wants less water use but still thinks he can keep his greens ""soft and friendly"". You can't make greens soft without HIGH water use. Also,you can't make a test at all if there is no penalty for being far away from the hole. Look at this year's Shell Houston- JB Holmes went low despite missing almost all the fairways and being 20-30 feet away on his putts. That shouldn't happen. It doesn't reward skill when all you have to do is hit at the green, and not play positionally. Firing at the flagstick and having the ball stop immediately is not golf.   Third, his courses are repetitive and, aesthetically, they're the absolute worst behind Desmond Muirhead.   I will say Gary is right on the length issue. But this is an issue that can be resolved by people getting it over their egos and teeing it forward."
ProGolf,3ailcq,ExactlyUnlikeTea,1 point,Sat Jun 20 20:57:06 2015 UTC,"Top 100 what? Golf Digest? They have the Alotian in like the top 30. Don't trust them. Player's courses are highly unnatural, with narrow one-dimensional fairways, ineffective bunkers, hideous mounding, artificial and contrived greens, with just as much silly contour as Chambers, only playing wetter and worse. He, like Nicklaus, designs only for players of his skill level, which leads to a good course for only those that can fire at every flagstick with impunity."

Those are the only two Nicklaus courses I've played and absolutely love 'em. The former - Sunrise at Las Campanas CC - has birdie chances for the highest of handicappers and is a super course. Had no idea he wasn't that esteemed as a course architect."
ProGolf,3ailcq,DaveFromNewcastle,1 point,Sun Jun 21 21:46:45 2015 UTC,"Nicklaus is better than Player or Palmer, and better as a course designer as of late, but as an architect does design for very aerial games and lots of long irons. You can see a bit of any pro's golf style in their courses."
ProGolf,3ailcq,ExactlyUnlikeTea,1 point,Sun Jun 21 22:02:44 2015 UTC,"Ooh, fair shout, the 19* hybrid is in heavy use out there on approach shots. Even if you're a long hitter playing the blues there's not many wedges in out there, but mid irons (with my grandpa golf, 19* hybrids). My friends that are better golfers than I get plenty of three and four iron work when they step back to the tips at 7,640 or so. If they want to try and cut corners for shorter approaches, confidence in long carries over trouble is mandatory."

ProGolf,3ailcq,Sok543,0,Sat Jun 20 18:43:36 2015 UTC,I think his argument about attracting amatuer golfers is stupid but the complaints of the course itself are valid. I can't think of a worse US Open venue in my lifetime and neither can player who is a lot older than me. I'm glad they are trying new things but this was a bad choice from day 1 and players have been complaining about it since its selection. With all that said I've enjoyed watching it due to the tight leaderboard. It can be pretty frustrating to watch because of the greens and how frustrating it is.

I'm not even mad if they miss a drive here or there, but when a leader is putting for birdie can you please show the goddamn putt, Fox?   Spieth had an uphill birdie putt at 12 and they cut away to other people and when they returned the commentator said ""and here's Spieth for birdie on 12...wait, this is Spieth for par on 12 he missed his birdie putt""   It's actually a bit comical, and wasn't just a one-time thing. They missed quite a few shots, and a lot of the time they would show shots 5 minutes after they happened... for the leaders. I understand if someone is at +8 and holes out and they need time for that pickup but if a leader just made a birdie putt can you show it within a reasonable time frame? I accidentally spoiled myself multiple times from looking at the leaderboard to see someone was 1 shot better (or worse) and then 3-4 minutes later seeing the putt made (or missed)."

ProGolf,3ae6xp,jra322,5,Fri Jun 19 11:53:36 2015 UTC,He's playing bad golf though.  He still has to believe that his best can win.  Problem is his best is back in 2009 pre-Pga Championship.  I feel for him.
ProGolf,3ae6xp,what-the-what-what,2,Fri Jun 19 13:10:29 2015 UTC,"I grew up watching in win tournament after tournament. In my life he is the greatest golfer that I was lucky enough to watch. Its horrible to watch this rebuilding phase again but I cant look away. I wish he would just smash a 3iron off the tee and play longer shots into greens and work out his kinks with the driver and 3wood away from tournament play, but what do I know"
ProGolf,3ae6xp,yobay,4,Fri Jun 19 13:25:23 2015 UTC,Couldnt agree more.  He is trying to play to win when he should be playing to make cuts and build from there.  Dude looks miserable out there.
ProGolf,3ae6xp,barfolamew,3,Fri Jun 19 19:34:24 2015 UTC,"From everything I hear he's just too stubborn. His driver is his main source, everything else is pretty good right now.   Some of the corp nike guys were at our course this week and said they saw him at a fitting and refuses to play a softer driver shaft that spins. They said he was getting around 1,800 max with his current shaft. You can't really control a ball that spins too low. There is a sweet spot for every swing. I think if he backs off 2-4mph on his driver swing with a softer shaft and he's piping it just over 290-300 all day. You don't need to hit it 325 to score on tour."

ProGolf,3ae6xp,whitecompass,4,Mon Jun 22 04:05:36 2015 UTC,I will be the last to give up on Tiger Woods. I refuse to give up. 2 years ago he was the best golfer in the world. I believe
ProGolf,3ae6xp,yobay,1 point,Fri Jun 19 14:21:13 2015 UTC,"dont get me wrong, I by no means want to give up on him, I want to see him break Jacks major records, but if we took this video at face value and he continues to miss cuts, or sneak in and then blow up on the weekend, he might just step away altogether. I root for him and I want nothing more then to see him win, but he said these words and I think he meant them"
ProGolf,3ae6xp,FarawayFairways,2,Fri Jun 19 19:38:23 2015 UTC,"I've wondered a few times if Tiger truly loves golf, or if he truly loves winning. If it's the latter, then his love of the game for the games sake won't be enough to keep him involved. Indeed, there's a strong nuance in this clip from 2006 that this is what he's saying.   The new replaces in the old in all walks of life, and Tiger was never going to be immune from that. I do wonder however if he's looking in the right direction now? Tiger has always been a technocrat, obsessed with a perfect swing. Over indulging anything can lead to distraction as you immerse yourself more and more in it.  Would he better off just taking a few weeks out playing lower key events on the European tour for instance, where he won't be subjected to the same level scrutiny and just reconnecting with the game and seeing if he can find it fun again.  Bunkering down hasn't helped so far, and there is a bit of me wondering if he'd now be better liberating himself for a bit and saying ""you know what, I'm just going to go out there smile, laugh, and have some fun hitting it, and see where it takes me""  He won't of course, but has he locked himself in the lab too long now"
ProGolf,3ae6xp,yobay,-1,Sat Jun 20 08:37:16 2015 UTC,"well after what hes shown with Chirs Como guiding him, I guess this is pretty much it after this year.. lucky for golf fans there are so many young players who are going to keep us on the edge of our seats (Rory, Jordan, Hideki, Rickie)"

ProGolf,3afc6w,missdawson03,7,Fri Jun 19 17:51:08 2015 UTC,"Fox is awful. They came in bragging about their innovations, etc. but they did not understand that you can't just walk in and cover a U.S. Open. There are so many flaws in the coverage not just on Fox Sports but also online. In trying to follow the featured groups, it's clear the commentary is less than stellar. The commentators are often found bumbling around trying to understand certain things like yesterday they didn't know what shot Rickie/Louie were hitting on 8. Was it their 4th shot? Their 5th? Who knows!   They also don't get yardages regularly and when they do they are often way off the mark. Earlier today at 13 they said Justin had 250 to the hole and then put up a graphic that said he had 217 or so to the hole. That's a 30 yard discrepancy. Even PGATOUR LIVE@ week in week out gets accurate yardages every single shot and gets good reads on how to play each shot and putts as well. For a Major Championship the viewers deserve better.   On top of that, they also regularly miss shots. One of the reasons to watch featured group coverage is to not miss a shot from any one of the 3 members unlike network coverage which won't show every drive or approach or putt. They have multiple times now come back from break and said ""we missed their drives"" and have NO CLUE where the drives went so they have to call in the on-the-course commentator to tell everyone where the drives went. They can't even show replays of the drives that we missed.  In addition to that, the camerawork in general is pretty sloppy. They boasted about how great their camerawork would be, but they were all bark and no bite. They show Jordan (Spieth) about to hit a putt on #2, and then cut to a zoom-in on him (a super zoom-in) and keep the camera zoomed in on his face while he hits and it misses but we couldn't see it until after it had already missed they showed where it ended up. There are numerous other examples of sloppy camera work not showing shots but that was the most recent one."
ProGolf,3afc6w,the_vadernader,3,Fri Jun 19 18:41:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I saw that Speith zoom in putt and was screaming WTF.  Really disappointed in this FOX coverage.  Amatuer hour without a doubt."
ProGolf,3afc6w,what-the-what-what,4,Sun Jun 21 03:22:44 2015 UTC,"They definitely should have gotten an event before this to work out the kinks. The camera work is not that great. I know it's probably difficult to pick up the ball with this course as a background, but they aren't even switching to the correct camera in time and are having a hard time framing the shot properly.   I do like the use of protracer and the graphic over the green, viewed from the fairway, with the yardage to the hole."
ProGolf,3afc6w,faceback,2,Fri Jun 19 18:18:13 2015 UTC,"I totally agree,  it's hard to follow.  I had to mute it as well because the announcers are terrible.  I feel like it's to big of tournament to start with.  I was looking forward to watching all weekend.  Irs making it hard to watch though."

Edit: oh wait, it seems to be more about vertigo. Which, as a sufferer of chronic vertigo, I can heartily say also sucks. Hope he recovers either way and will be fit to continue."
ProGolf,3adel4,mreatsum,2,Fri Jun 19 20:40:25 2015 UTC,Last hole of the day I hope he can finish.  But I don't know much about vertigo so I don't know how possible that would be.
ProGolf,3adel4,ashdrewness,2,Fri Jun 19 20:45:03 2015 UTC,"Mine is due to both a vestibular asymmetry and a cyst in my brain and comes and goes pretty randomly. Sometimes it's bad for a whole day, other times just an hour or less. I manage it with medication, which works most of the time to stabilize me but not for the more severe attacks.  Anyway, it looks like he'll manage to finish up, which is great. Hopefully the vertigo subsides before his round tomorrow."

Splotchy greens aside (upon which the ball seems to be rolling well regardless), the scenic vistas, the different sightlines, the elevation changes, the slopes, the trains, the various tees and approaches to many holes all make for a unique viewing (and challenging playing) experience.

Speculation continues on whether or not this is the start of his long-awaited comeback, but for realzies this time.  Rory disappoints by missing yet another cut.

Tiger shoots like old Tiger and makes it into the final pairing, with a young up and comer who's been hot recently... Ricky Fowler.  Rory makes the cut but shoots a 96 on Saturday after he shoots a 22 on hole 6 due to multiple penalties.  He then breaks every club in his bag except one (ala Tin Cup) and finishes the round out with nothing but his driver.  Duffner shoots below par and is in the top 10 until hole 14 on Sunday when his ex-wife runs out on the course in a bikini screaming ''DUFFY I MISS U SO MUCH IM SORRY I FUCKED DJ AND DID COKE WITH HIM, PLZ TAKE ME BACK''.

ProGolf,3a8uq4,SketchArtist,2,Thu Jun 18 22:04:16 2015 UTC,"These greens are making me nervous on thursday. By Sunday we could see a joke on our hands. With the severe slopes Chambers Bay offers, as the course bakes out the poa annua will make it's presence known. I'm not just talking about the speed of the greens, but that could become an issue too. The bumpiness is what I'm worried about, we're going to see a lot of guys hitting 3 or 4 footers solid and having it bounce hard left/right on them and have them shaking their head. Always hate to see the game come down to so much luck and it's unfortunate that our nations pride & joy is being played on really bumpy greens. And that's just 3 or 4 footers. Imagine the 50ft+ lag putts guys will surely be hitting, those bumping all over the place could lead to balls sliding sideways off line into slopes where the green curls into bunkers or 60yds away in fairways.  There's not really much the USGA can do about it now, either. They should have sucked it up and re-sodded the greens with something like TifEagle well in advance of the Championship. These greens won't hold til Sunday and we might as well build a windmill or clown's nose on some of these greens. (#7, #12, #18 just to name a few)"

I lucked out and got a chance to play the Vancouver Golf Club on Monday. The greens were the hardest and fastest greens I've ever played in my life. On any green with any kind of a slope, if your approach ended up above the hole... forget about it, may as well just pick it up.  Every time it happened, I would just lightly tap it toward the hole... and queue the dramatic roll all way to the other side of the fucking green... Jeezus it was nuts.  I've become a consistent mid to high 80's golfer. On this day, tee to green I was playing the best game of my life... and ended up with a 95.  Without the greens the way they were, it may have been my best chance yet to break 80.  Kinda pissed me off!  But I did love the roll I was getting on the fairways!  Anyway, excited to see how the pros do in these weather conditions on an obviously much more difficult set-up than I was playing."

The US Open is one of my favorite tournaments to watch because of how the USGA sets up these courses to make these guys go out and try to just shoot par."

Once you get to about +8 though, then it starts getting ridiculous. I think +8 is probably a good benchmark for this because with how much the USGA worships 70 as their par number (as they will this year), +8 then correlates to 288, which would be E on a par 72."

So that's a lot of good players at one site (they give more spots to this site, but still). Most of the other sites may have a couple names you'd recognize, but more web.com and mini tour guys and good amateurs.  Also, it depends so much on the course. -1 got through out in Washington, but you could've shot -11 and NOT qualified in Georgia. Nuts."

(3)Gouged out to the bottom of the hill in front of the green. '  (4) A chunked pitch (even my wife said it was ugly) that hit on the green but rolled back past his feet to the bottom of the hill  (5)A failed flop that went into the bunker   (6)A bunker shot that he made sure made the green but could care less about.

ProGolf,38t4v5,NoFunRob,5,Sat Jun 6 16:52:40 2015 UTC,I'm predicting a very fast paced round.
ProGolf,38t4v5,nohopeleftforanyone,3,Sat Jun 6 20:08:32 2015 UTC,No marker required?  What does that mean?
ProGolf,38t4v5,g00dj0b,6,Sat Jun 6 18:35:47 2015 UTC,some tournaments require a marker to play if there is an odd number of players on the weekend. A marker is someone who's not on the PGA Tour but is skilled enough to play the course and give that one person a playing partner for the day. Generally it's the club pro or a club pro from a nearby course. it happens quite often and markers get once in a lifetime chances to play with the pros. it actually happened last year at the US Open at Pinehurst.
ProGolf,38t4v5,nohopeleftforanyone,3,Sat Jun 6 18:58:05 2015 UTC,It's up to the tournament if a marker is required?    So I'm assuming the only way to ever play alone in a tournament then is to be in last with an odd number of players after the cut and no marker required?  Am I understanding this right?
ProGolf,38t4v5,g00dj0b,3,Sat Jun 6 19:17:17 2015 UTC,Correct
ProGolf,38t4v5,warriorsbro,7,Sat Jun 6 20:59:12 2015 UTC,"I still think his game is salvageable. The thing is, I don't think he'll be able to do it in private like he wants to. He wants to fix his swing, then come out and play good.  Its a viscous cycle of anxiety undoing his swing progress, which brings out more anxiety, and so on. He can't practice anxiety management in private.   Imo he should go back to Butch, which would be a mental breakthrough in itself. Then since he's pretty much eternally exempt he should play a lot more than 8-10 times a year. When he's gone for weeks and months, all this pressure and expectation builds up for his return, which feeds the issue I mentioned earlier.   It is partially an ego thing for sure. He'll never go back to Butch, and he'll never bat it around at lesser events hoping for made-cuts while he searches for his game; not unless he loses the ego and lets his guard down.  Butch, an honest & confident sports-psychologist, and reps. That's my prescription."

ProGolf,38t5fe,TotallyAGG,6,Sun Jun 7 15:06:36 2015 UTC,"Tiger was the dominant golfer from 1997-2004.  That was a long time ago folks.  He has had flashes of brilliance since then(eg. 2013), but the rest of the competition got better.  He hasn't won a major since 2008, which was 7 years ago.  He is 40 years old and nowhere near the elite level of play of today's golfers.  I think the public should just accept this fact, rather than focusing on Tiger every tournament he tees it up and blather whether he's back or not.  How about when/if he plays a decent tournament we talk about Tiger.  Gretzky and Jordan were pretty good in their twilight but nowhere near what they once were.  The respective media's understood this and focused more on the upcoming stars.  They weren't shoved down our throats every time they donned a uniform.  I say if everyone wants Tiger to sort things out and be competitive again, leave him alone, don't focus on him as much, and let him get his head and game right."

He's almost certainly right from what I've read about it, it looks like beautiful drives could be in jail, landing on the green could not be the best route to a par, etc.   Will be interesting to see who does win and how familiar he is with the course. Not every golfer has the luxury of Tiger to play it earlier and skip other tournaments but the very best do. I'm surprised they're blowing off the chance to get that knowledge."

ProGolf,38jxnp,JoeSchmoe300,2,Fri Jun 5 03:07:56 2015 UTC,"If you have the latest copy of Golf Digest, man ... the course looks terrifying. One giant sandtrap, essentially.  There is a quote in the article from someone saying that sometimes to make par you need to intentionally MISS the green, a statement I've been trying to reconcile ever since reading it.   Should be fun. The average score in the 2010 US Amateur there was 79.2 ... Spieth didn't even make the cut as an amateur. Obviously, different level of golf, but some really good golfers are going to have some ugly scores there."
ProGolf,38jxnp,greebytime,0,Fri Jun 5 03:13:47 2015 UTC,"So how does it work for him to play 9 holes in 3.5 hours?  I mean i know pros usually play free but seems like that would be upsetting the course's business right now.  Or did Tiger just let everyone play threw?  Or did he rent it out for the day?  I saw he was playing 4 or 5 balls, probably chipping and putting from every location around the green as well. Does anyone know the logistics of this?"
ProGolf,38jxnp,_glenn_,6,Thu Jun 4 21:25:59 2015 UTC,Course is probably closed this close to the open.

I am just so tired of all of the hype and it takes away from the great golf the other players are actually producing.    That said, I think Tiger is very dangerous.  If he ever gets another major, I think I would be safe to say watch out. That deep seeded hunger of his for more that took him down could also make him impossible to beat if his game comes around.  There is one thing that still might scare folks is that when Tiger is on, he is almost impossible to beat."

ProGolf,384ojz,what-the-what-what,3,Tue Jun 2 13:37:20 2015 UTC,"He is literally a mental case on the course these days.  It was the first time I literally cringed watching him play a few months ago in the latest tournament that he withdrew.  That was the tournament that I, at a 4 handicap, could have beat him.  He was hitting shots extremely fat, blading others.  I don't recall him hitting a fairway in 13 holes.    I think if he was honest about his game and would just play tournaments and not do this thing like he has always done of playing 12-16 times a year, his game would improve measurably.  If it were me, I would be playing as much as I was able just to get that experience inside a tournament setting and get comfortable with the swing.    I see a lot of things wrong with Woods.  Forget about his personal life.  His father was correct when he stated that Woods should never get married.  He obviously knew something.  Maybe it was his father's death that let everything fall apart.  I don't know.    He is an extreme example of a type A personality that when things started falling apart, he had no idea what to do because he has never been in that position before.  He also has it compounded by those younger players that all they knew growing up was Tiger Woods.  These new breed players are fit athletes that bomb the ball 330 yards.    I was a walk on in college at Wake Forest.  I played a round a few years back with Webb Simpson and Bill Haas in Winston.  It was insane that they are hitting it so far. There is a par 5 at Old Town (Wake's home course) that is around 585 from the tips.  It takes 265 to carry the front edge of the fairway from back there.  I was barely on and rolled out to a respectable 285 (still 300 yards out from the green, which is a blind dogleg right over a creek to a double green).  Both Haas and Simpson put it out at 340 on the top of the hill of the dogleg.  They hit 4 irons into the green!  I layed up and got my par.  My point being, the game has changed and Woods did not have that competition when he started and was destroying fields.  Now you have players like Simpson, Haas, McIlroy, Mahan, etc, that simply just are not scared of Woods and play better than him.  The field tightened around him and he never made changes.  Rome burned when Nero was partying so to speak."
ProGolf,384ojz,Spockwouldbejealous,2,Tue Jun 2 14:04:35 2015 UTC,"He competed well since then, but I think you are right - today, he's a JAG (Just A Guy). A far cry from the days of Tiger-proofing courses, etc."

ProGolf,384ojz,Zeppelanoid,2,Wed Jun 3 19:24:31 2015 UTC,"Read what I wrote.  I stated that as a 4 handicap, I could have beaten Tiger on that day he withdrew as poorly as he was playing.    I was fortunate in my time at Wake to play with several players who later joined both the PGA, and LPGA and also the women's european league.  They are all exceptional players and could do things with a golf ball and ball placement like I have never seen before.    Case in point, played with Jose Bird (who later fizzled out but was neck in neck with Woods in the 13-17 age bracket trading places as #1 amateur for year and then lost all of his confidence).  Jose and I would play very often.  I never forget the first time out and we were a bit behind the corner of the dogleg and he tells me he is going to hit a low draw around the corner and the ball will rise up at the end and he was going to put it a few feet below the hole for an uphill put for birdie.  I was like, sure.  Damn if he didn't do it over and over again.    I do agree with you, there is a HUGE difference between your local scratch golfer and the guys and women on tour.  What you see on TV is just the more easy stuff.  You should see what they are able to accomplish when faced with crazy lies, crazy angles, etc.  It is truly art watching them play."

It's not like there's been a sudden schedule change or anything, he knew that playing the BMW PGA would mean he couldn't play the Crowne Plaza Invitational when he signed up for it.   However, since I wrote that initial post, I've heard that the reason for the schedule change is that Reed has a family member who has terminal cancer and is expected to pass away within the next few days, meaning he wants to be close to home.

ProGolf,35rj89,NippleMilk97,3,Sat May 16 16:12:31 2015 UTC,"Ok, RETARD.  The effective tax rate for a person making over about 370,000 dollars is about 35%.  Thats all the way up, whether you make 400k or 400 million (when its income).  Golfers are self-employed contractors, meaning they pay an additional 15% in self-employment tax on their earnings (on the course), and their endorsements are normally funneled through a corp which pays them a salary or some other benefit to avoid SE tax.  Tiger's tax liability is certainly highest on his winnings, when we think about it before deductions.  However, I am sure that most of his expenses (such as the jet, the course in the back yard, etc) are counted against this income as opposed to his corporate income, since this is the higher tax rate.  He likely has nearly enough to reduce that to a small number, but I am sure he is giving the remainder away to avoid paying 50% on it... so if he gives away 10 million, he is really giving away only $5 million... but that is still a ton of money that he could have kept for himself, rather than given to a charity.  Making a donation lowers a person's overall taxable income.  As an independent contractor, when he donates his winnings, he receives that full amount off of his net income... saving him about 50% of the total donated in tax (thats his federal obligation, plus his SE tax).  There is definately a benefit to him donating his winnings (which are taxed at around 50%) versus his corporate earnings (which are taxed as a disbursement, about half of what his other earnings are).  His tax bill is certainly lower by donating to charity than it would be if he didn't, but he also ends up with less cash than he would if he chose to keep it and just pay the tax on it.  You seem to think that a charitable donation reduces tax dollar-for-dollar.  It doesn't.  For most people, it is more like a 25% benefit.  For someone like Tiger, who pays SE tax in addition to being in the highest bracket, its more like 50%... but he is still losing money by donating... and losing more than you will earn in your life, especially with that gig at Burger King.  People who flip burgers for a living don't have to know these things, so I don't feel bad for you.  But get a clue, fuck-stick.  Edit:  Fixed some punctuation and added some insults."

I kept wondering, ""Where is Rickie?"" and wondering if I'd read it wrong.   Suddenly, on the 16th hole with that eagle, he just leapt over so many guys and then TOOK OVER. I then assumed Garcia was going to choke, and the playoff surprised me as did Kevin Kisner being there as well.   Maybe one of the very best Sunday afternoon in BIG TIME golf in terms of competitiveness and excitement that I can remember in a long time. SO many guys in the hunt until the very end. Great, great stuff.   No wonder the ratings went through the roof."

From Rickie making his run to the end of the playoff she was glued to the tv and normally she couldn't be FORCED to watch that much golf. This just had everything! What a terrific tourney.   Also now she says that she likes Rickie so I think I'll be able to get her to watch more as long as he stays in the hunt. Soooo win-win.

ProGolf,35lxge,threerocks,-25,Mon May 11 17:21:37 2015 UTC,"Oh pleeeeease, is that the best you can come up with? One incident as a player was announced and wasn't even in the process of playing a shot. It was just a call out from the crowd. This sort of thing routinely happens at PGA events every week. It's hardly the same as shouting on a backswing is it? I'm afraid you've got to come up with something better than that  Also I really don't think American golf is any position what so ever to start handing out lectures about crowd behaviour at Ryder Cups (or even that of their players and wives come to think of it). Hell, Payne Stewart even conceded a hole because of the barracking of Colin Montgomerie (something that only happened to Montgomerie for a decade in the US). European wives in the past have had to remove their credentials as beered up American's spat on them, and that's before you go down Kiawah way and the abuse that was suffered there (something which has been used as motivation for European teams ever since incidentally - you'd be surprised just how deep Kiawah runs, and what an own goal it turned out to be).   You can go on trying to make excuses for the behaviour as much as you like, but I think most golf fans would prefer that America actually faced up to this instead of trying to deny it's existance or deflect with limp comparisons.   I think you should also realise that as these pictures get beamed around the world, the global audience doesn't see Floridans. They see Americans. I promise you.   I speak with plenty of American golf fans and administrators face to face or over the phone. And to a person they're embarrassed by this kind of behaviour and nearly always acknowledge it's more of an issue in the States then elsewhere in the world. A vast majority would like to see it addressed in my experience, and the usual distinction is made between 'golf fans' and 'sports fans'. It's only in cyberspace though that it seems to find its apologists  The integrity of American sport is increasingly reeling from a series of high profile incidents and famous individuals which we ought to call it for what it is - cheating. Golf has always prided itself on its decency, and whereas I don't have any problem with chanting U-S-A between shots, deliberately calling out as someone is in the process of trying to play a shot is what? Cheating? or an attempt to. We've seen it at places like Augusta too, which prompted Tom Watson to openly rebuke the patrons during play as they systematically did the level best to put off Ian Woosnam. Do you think Watson made this up?  I've feared a couple of times that American galleries could set off a behavioural arms race, and then what. Players won't play, and golf will lose its team matchplay events. Well done! I suspect that 50% could be addressed with tighter alcohol controls, but then alcohol = $$$$"

Yep, there are hecklers in America and they're dumb.  Just like there are hecklers everywhere and they are stupid too.  If you can't take some idiot stranger telling you to go home, then maybe you don't have the balls to win a close tournament.  Colin Montgomerie kind of proves my point there.

ProGolf,35jc5g,what-the-what-what,2,Thu May 14 13:04:21 2015 UTC,"Weaker fields or not, he still had the lowest unadjusted scoring average ever recorded in the PGA, which means he was playing pretty good golf."

ProGolf,35gqwb,Spfeifer,5,Sun May 10 04:51:44 2015 UTC,"I've been to a handful of PGA events, most recent was last year's PGA at Valhalla.  There's different ways to do it, no one particular way to enjoy the day.  I would make sure I have a list of tee times and know who's in what group... then study a course map, learn the holes.  That way when you're out wandering the grounds you can sorta keep track of where everyone is.  Me personally, at the beginning of the day I like to start at 18 and walk backwards... you get to see a lot of different golfers and the course that way.   If you get tired of walking, stop for a while and wait in an interesting spot and watch some groups play through.    Or you may have a specific player you really like, in that case you can follow them outside the ropes. With big name players though, it's gonna be packed.   The popular players are going to have HUGE crowds around them, and it will be hard to see them if you are trying to follow right along with them outside the ropes.  The best thing to do if you want to get a look at Rory's swing up close is camp out in a good spot a few holes ahead,  then wait till he comes to you.  Same thing with the finishing holes...  if you want to be able to see anything when the final group gets to the 18th... ya gotta get there early.  Check the list of prohibited items before you go, wear comfortable shoes.  Sometimes they don't allow backpacks but you can bring drawstring bags like this... I always bring one with a couple bottles of water and some snacks.  Have fun!"
ProGolf,35gqwb,skibblez_n_zits,2,Sun May 10 05:51:06 2015 UTC,"I personally would get there as early as possible and find an early group teeing off that you like at least one of the two golfers enough - and follow them through the course.   That way you'll see the entire course. Then, again if you get out early enough, you can camp out around  18 and watch the final pairs come through. That said, it will probably fill up quickly from folks who have been out there already this week so you may not be able to sit and stay there in a good seat without being persistent or lucky. That said, I'd want to see the whole course so that's why I'd not race out to the last hole in particular."
ProGolf,35gqwb,greebytime,2,Sun May 10 06:19:11 2015 UTC,"Just don't yell ""Mashed Potatoes""."
ProGolf,35gqwb,DetroitBreakdown,2,Sun May 10 15:43:54 2015 UTC,"I've been lucky enough to have multiple events near my house my entire life. I've attended PGA, LPGA, Nike Tour, and college tournaments. There's basically two ways you can do it. I prefer one, you may prefer the other: 1st way: CAMP - in other words, pick a spot and hang there, watch every group come through and just watch the best players in the world hit shots. Watch their pre-shot routine, setup, ball flight, demeanor, interaction with their caddies, the whole schmeil. I like to pick a spot where I can see multiple shots, for instance I'll sit at a tee where I can easily see the second shots and putts into the previous green, that way you're not spending 10 minutes doing nothing while waiting for the next tee shot. You can bring a chair for this, or just stand. You can do this at a green too and watch putts, but I find watching them just putt kind of boring, I normally get way more enjoyment and learn more from watching them hit full shots. 2) FOLLOW - A ton of people do this, basically what you'll do is pick a player or group of players and follow them the entire round. You'll see people do this with the top players, bubba, tiger, phil, etc ..... I've done this a little, but it's normally difficult to get prime viewing position, I like to be really close to the players when  they hit, like close enough to reach out and touch them. I find this to always be the most impressive to me.....but again that's a personal preference. As far as etiquette, be quiet, be very still when they are setting up and hitting, be respectful, don't clap for bad shots, don't say stupid shit like ""mashed potatoes"" or ""you da man"", basically don't be a douche......trust me I've seen many players glare at fans, or even berate them over the years for being stupid.......just be quiet and still and you'll be fine. Have fun!!! NINJA EDIT: I just happened to read the response from u/skibblez_n_zits ... I like what he said, but be careful with bringing snacks and water....this is not permitted at the PGA event in my town, actually a lot of stuff is prohibited now, including the bags that those folding chairs come in, umbrella sleeves, pocket knives, etc....it's almost the same rules as going on an airplane......so check the policies before showing up with stuff, cuz you'll be walking back to your car :)"

ProGolf,35gqwb,GrantNexus,1 point,Sun May 10 09:43:31 2015 UTC,The best view is sitting right behind the green. It's really hard to see the ball in the air any where else.  If you want to be close to the players camp out at a tee box but I thought the tee shots were very boring.   If you want to get very close to the players find a fairway that is commonly missed in the same spot so the golfer has to go behind the ropes. I was 2 feet away from Vijay Singh and Jason Day my last tournament and it's cool to hear the caddy conversations. this is also a good way to get hit by a golf ball
ProGolf,35gqwb,MarkStoops,1 point,Sun May 10 14:01:15 2015 UTC,"A little late, but also go to the range and watch players hit.  I was always amazed at how good they are at hitting a golf ball.  You really see it when they are striping it one after another."

ProGolf,35ipyt,RuckNaked,1 point,Mon May 11 04:04:26 2015 UTC,"Until he stops creating a dramatic spike in ratings either on TV or on websites, he won't be going anywhere.  I don't know why people don't just scroll past the articles about him. Click on the comments section on other websites. Articles about Tiger ALWAYS have more comments.  It's usually a mixed bag of comments about the actual content of the article and comments whining about the number of articles about Tiger. Either way, it's another click for the website so they will continue to print articles about Tigers relationship, triple bogey, bed sheet thread count, etc."
ProGolf,35ipyt,FarawayFairways,1 point,Sun May 10 22:15:31 2015 UTC,"I think part of the problem is that in order to get articles ranked for SEO purposes you have to put the name Tiger Woods into the first paragraph and quite probably use it in some h2 font in the title too. I should say though that the 'obsession' is very much an American thing. If he performs well, or particularly badly, the European media pick up on it, but otherwise he's treated like any other golfer.  We don't mind America obsessing on Tiger Woods though, and particularly for Ryder Cup purposes, as it clearly helps to undermine team building and unity when every press conference is dominated by just one players name, and when captains then start to lower the qualification threshold to allow him in the team, and when suggestions are made (apparently in all seriousness) that Tiger has to make the team in order to boost ratings. It's little wonder America keeps losing if these are their priorities.   Please subject Jordan Spieth and Rickie (over-rated) Fowler to the same treatment. Even better, do it to someone who we now have confirmed that fellow players dislike, like Bubba Watson, that'll work wonder for morale"

ProGolf,35ipyt,Shankopotomus,-8,Sun May 10 20:32:27 2015 UTC,I feel he ruined the game. I like watching him play well because it's exciting but he brought so many hackers onto the course within 1-2 years of him turning pro. I'm not trying to be an elitist but he really did a lot for this game but inspiring people to go out and play for their first time without even going to the range is one of them. We all pay the same price to play but it is frustrating having people on the course that don't have a clue about the game. We all gotta start somewhere though

ProGolf,35btae,FantasticBastard,-4,Fri May 8 23:35:51 2015 UTC,True but why not throw your putter every time you miss a birdie putt or something similar. Nobody threw their club into the water after they hit it into the water on the island green. You have more of a chance to lose strokes after doing that on a par 3 than on a par 5
ProGolf,35btae,CyclingVinnie,2,Sat May 9 03:14:13 2015 UTC,"18 is a par 4.   And to be fair, hitting in the water on 17 is far more commonplace and can happen even on well struck shots. Also, better keep that wedge around for the drop & 18. On 18, only way you are going in that water is if you screwed up, plus, last hole so who needs that driver anymore anyway.

ProGolf,354g56,GoingHome,2,Thu May 7 15:11:59 2015 UTC,They had this issue last year it has something to do with the codex pack they they are encoding with on their end. Nothing you can do can reliably solve it unless someone has found a work around. Some people think switching browsers will solve it but others have had no such luck. Best bet is pause and wait for the background audio on the page to catch up then mute the main stream. Shit solution but we have to deal. The PGA is terribly behind in coverage sources.

In the past when he would lose he would blame others in post interviews, break tee markers with his driver after poor tee shots, throw temper tantrums by slamming his wedge in the bunker on a chunked shot (google how sergio rakes a bunker), spit in the cup where others have to reach in later to get their ball... basically act like a child.  In short, he's a poor sport.    More recently he made a racist remark about Tiger and they pretty much hate each other... there's a long list of reasons why, which you can google.  It goes back to almost two decades ago when Sergio beat Tiger in some event and he celebrate like he won the Master's, Ryder Cup and Super Bowl at the same time... again, him being a poor sport.

ProGolf,352ahs,letgoandflow,2,Thu May 7 01:33:41 2015 UTC,Why couldn't he drop around the green after the second ball went in the water? It landed on the green side of the hazard and spun back in. Couldn't he have dropped it in the rough somewhere as long as it was no closer to the hole as the entry point?
ProGolf,352ahs,Yoshiman400,3,Wed May 6 16:40:09 2015 UTC,"I believe the pond is classified as just a regular (i.e. non-lateral) water hazard, in which you have to drop in the drop zone or as close to possible to where you played your previous shot. In comparison, I live near a couple of courses with island greens and drop zones on the island itself, surely designed to speed up play for the hacker crowd, whereas Sawgrass is intended as a professional course that keeps the drop zone off the island."
ProGolf,352ahs,thereisnoreasoning,3,Wed May 6 17:45:26 2015 UTC,It's a yellow hazard. When a hazard is yellow you must keep the point the ball last crossed the hazard in between your dropped ball and the hole while also having to have complete relief from the hazard. Or go to a drop zone if there is one. Or re-tee. If it was a red hazard then you could do what you said. Two club lengths no closer to the hole from where it last crossed the hazard line.

ProGolf,352ahs,FarawayFairways,2,Wed May 6 21:09:41 2015 UTC,"I'm always struck by the correlation between the European players who American's hate the most, and their Ryder Cup records. It isn't difficult to figure out. The supporting rationale is often cloaked in other reasons, but Poulter, Ballesteros, and Montgomerie have all been on the receiving end at various times, and all have  been seminal to successful cup teams. Sergio similarly at the K Club. Admittedly Poulter invites it, but then American galleries haven't learnt yet that the best way of getting to him, is to give him the silent treatment (he'd hate it!).   It'll be interesting to see how European galleries develop their relationship with Patrick Reed. At the moment he's regarded as being fun, and has generated a sense of affection (believe it or not) but then so far at least, he's been on a losing team. I think that makes a huge difference. Someone strutting about like a peacock and playing the gallery, doesn't generate quite the same level of dislike when they lose."
ProGolf,352ahs,HopperC,2,Thu May 7 08:55:30 2015 UTC,"This is a conversation which demands it's own thread!  I could discuss this for hours!    The reason behind US Ryder Cup records in recent years is not difficult to fathom.  As a result, we European's haven't really had the opportunity to develop any really focused resentment for any US player.  Mostly we develop remote love affairs with those we respect, as opposed to hating them.  There are some possible candidates emerging as you say (Reed, Watson) but none have really done anything so significant that would elevate them above ""polite scorn"" into proper resentment.  Even Tiger.  Maybe it comes down tot he fact that European players tend to have more personality in public.  US players are always very careful about aligning themselves with the established US mildly conservative and christian golf culture, careful an inoffensive.  Speith looks like the real deal from a talent perspective, but he already appears to be aligning himself with the same 'off the shelf' personality as every other golfer.  Contrast that we Rory McIlroy, Poulter, Jiminez, etc etc."

Pretty crazy.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_World_Golf_Ranking#Year_end_world_top_10_players  What's also interesting was during his prolific run there were a lot of players over an 11 points average.

What other sport only shows partial coverage for a few hours similar to Golf? Does Major League Baseball only show games starting in the 5th inning? Does the NFL only cover games starting in the 3rd quarter?   Heck, it took them until recent to start realizing how the internet is the wave of the future and they need to step their online presence up (online shot tracking, online streaming / LIVE@, and now ""PGATOUR Live"" launching in Summer, etc) just like all other sports have already done years and years prior.   So now one media person tries to get more fan engagement utilizing new technology and they get their credentials revoked, sigh.   I believe one additional reason they felt like they really needed to revoke her credentials because of their new ""Skratch TV"" partnership. It's a online streaming platform that will (as far as I know) feature certain players on the range. It was pretty mediocre at Doral, but could be promising."
ProGolf,34qdzy,the_vadernader,1 point,Mon May 4 23:19:24 2015 UTC,"I have never understood the partial coverage complaint. No other sport has guying starting at 7:30 am, and guys finishing the event at 7:30 PM. The cost for covering all of that would be crazy. Yeah, some things need to change, like the Masters Coverage, but Overall Im pretty happy with the PGA broadcast."
ProGolf,34qdzy,amosni,1 point,Tue May 5 16:17:26 2015 UTC,"7:30 - 7:30 is a bit of an exaggeration.   But you're right, it would be a lot of coverage to tackle.  However, Major League Baseball regularly has games that start at noon or 1pm and other games on the west coast that don't start until after 9pm and many games end past midnight. That's 13+ hours of coverage that they figure out how to do.  I'm not saying TGC needs to show all of the coverage. But it would be nice for at least the nicer events to get more coverage, which they have been working towards. It would be nice if they did 2 or 3 featured group streams online on thurs/fri, for example."

His caddie was out of line, but you always take your teammates side in a toe-to-toe altercation like that. His caddie was being a bitch and Jimenez was quite calm with everything. I'm giving big ups to Bradley and Jimenez and docking Bradley's caddie."
ProGolf,34mdxd,RealLiveRyan,6,Sun May 3 03:57:01 2015 UTC,"If you watch the full video, Bradley is being as bitchy as his caddie before the ""shut up"" business starts."
ProGolf,34mdxd,ADAWG1910,-1,Sun May 3 07:01:08 2015 UTC,"I gotta say, I love Keegan Bradley - he's all twitchy all the time, he grew up with nothing and made himself a pro golfer -- he's wound TIGHT and Jiminez is pretty much the antithesis of that in terms of demeanor. As far as this goes, Jiminez should have said what he wanted to say and then, after Keegan told him to Get The Fuck OUT, he should have gotten the fuck OUT."
ProGolf,34m7o3,Zemulon,9,Sat May 2 12:23:37 2015 UTC,"A couple of other problems:   Fields need to be limited. Most nonmajors and non-WGCs have a field between 120 and 156 players, and since match play is a one-on-one format, 128 is the only ""useful"" number that can be used for a normal tier event without trying to hand out byes, unless a group stage format were to be used. And even then, that means 64 matches would have to happen on the first day or set of days, depending on which format we're using! Way too many groups. But even then, if you did a group format with 128 players, it'd be a literal nightmare trying to narrow the field down. 32 groups of four would be a nightmare in a round-robin format (take this week's tournament and add another round on top of it), and so would 16 groups of eight (which would be seven matches before single-elimination begins!).  And you can't really do nine-hole matches either, not because they're too short, but because players would complain about not being given the same holes as another match. It's not like a regular round of stroke play where the front nine groups eventually play the back nine on the same day and vice versa. (Which is also partially why first round, 1st hole morning groups are second round, 10th hole afternoon groups in stroke play--it's the closest you'll get to allowing a fair compromise with respect to weather.)   TLDR: Logistical and fairness issues."
ProGolf,34m7o3,Yoshiman400,-1,Sat May 2 13:32:12 2015 UTC,"Why have you assumed that the format has to be based on singles/ individuals?  Has golf not heard of the ITPL? or even the IPL? These golbal franchise leagues are proving more popular and lucrative.   Tennis is probably the sport that golf most closely resembles in terms of its structures, season, prize money, traditions, core fan 'type', and participating countries (less so now). They've seized the initiative and have their global stars involved. Golf is dawdling in comparison  Golf will say that they can't fit in of course, but then lets give this some context. Tennis tournaments last anywhere between 7-14 days, and take a lot more out of a player than golf does.   The focus should be on team match play. Dead easy"
ProGolf,34m7o3,FarawayFairways,7,Sat May 2 22:06:40 2015 UTC,"Not being TV-friendly is the biggest problem, but one-sided matches are not even the biggest reason. Because one bad round can get someone eliminated, often times the biggest drawing-cards - Tiger, Phil, Rory - don't make it to the final match. Guys like Jason Day, Victor Dubuisson, Matt Kuchar, and Hunter Mahan (final matches last two years) are fun to watch, but they are not bringing in TV viewers. Compare this to stroke-play events, where there is usually somebody of interest within striking distance.  Match play is not very spectator-friendly either. Though the tournament lasts for more days, for the spectators in attendance it kinda stinks that there are only a few groups playing on Sunday.  Most of these issues are neutralized by the team format used in the Ryder Cup and Presidents Cup, which is why these events are so great. But individual match play tournaments are not sustainable over the course of a golf season, and are only successful as novelty events once or twice a year."

ProGolf,34kpda,castle-black,2,Sat May 2 02:10:36 2015 UTC,"There's a story emerging that Bradley's caddie was mocking Jiminez's accent, (personally I'd be very surprised if this were true) but it is supposed to have prompted Miguel to tell him to shut up, and Keegan to then involve himself. On the concession the shake of hands didn't look great, and Bradley (to his credit) was forced to instruct his caddie to leave the players, as he came back in looking for more.   Miguel was within his right to query the drop, (it doesn't matter if he was wrong about the detail) that's the job of the official to resolve. In querying it though, he appears to have earned the mocking from the caddie (well that's the current interpretation) one suspects this story will take a few twists yet, but it doesn't look great for Keegan Bradley and caddie, but the PGA perhaps needs to ask a little bit more of their officials on the scene too"
ProGolf,34kpda,FarawayFairways,2,Sat May 2 12:21:37 2015 UTC,"I don't think the accent story is right. In the video Keegan and his caddy both say something to the affect of ""you wanting to make another delay?"" which is what Miguel took exception too."

ProGolf,34efnv,ExactlyUnlikeTea,3,Thu Apr 30 16:46:59 2015 UTC,"I'd like him to define ""championship greens"". Most every great course that majors are played on has contour in their putting surfaces. The greens will play perfect as long as the USGA watches the Stimpmeter. Not firmness, no, after the US Am they'll make sure to keep that in check. But if these greens roll any more than an 11 it will get dicey."

ProGolf,34flph,Yoshiman400,5,Sun May 3 17:57:22 2015 UTC,"When the scores say that Rory beat Dufner 5 to 4 yesterday, does that mean McIlroy won five holes and lost four, and all the others were even?   If that's true, does getting an eagle or a double bogie even matter, or is everything hole by hole?? Sorry for the noobie question."
ProGolf,34flph,JustMe8,7,Thu Apr 30 19:50:16 2015 UTC,"Rory was 5 up with 4 holes to play, so he won because it was impossible for Dufner to make up the deficit.   Obviously scoring well helps, but if you shoot a triple and your opponent shoots a quadruple, you win. If they shoot a birdie, and you shoot a double, they win. Either situation is worth 1 hole."

I see golfers struggling every weekend at my local muni.  When the pros tee it up I want to see them show off the skills that set them apart from us mere mortals.  These goofy set ups are why there are fluke winners at the US Open more than any other major.  Below is a list of winners and runners up for the last ten years. Yes, Rory McIlroy and Tiger Woods won during that span.

ProGolf,34ca89,GrantNexus,10,Thu Apr 30 00:20:41 2015 UTC,"Pretty easy. Standard match play rules.  Each match played to a result (no ties). 16 groups of 4 players, each initially populated with one of the top 16 in the tournament. Other players (#17 to #64) are random drawn (ping pong ball blower) into each of of the 16 groups. Each guy in each group plays the other 3 players in his group. After those 3 matches, winner of each 4 man group proceeds to ""Final 16"".  If there's a tie within the group, winner is determined by who won the head-to-head match between the tied players. Then final 16 play one-and-done single elimination on Sat and Sun. Winner gets ~$1.6, second ~$980. Incidentally... this is directly based on the world cup soccer system of ""groups"", then single elimination playoffs. Hope that makes sense."

You instinctively feel that if someone hasn't been defeated after 18 holes, they deserve some acknowledgement for that. The result of the play off can then be held over to settle any eventual tie on points if needed. Reckon Kevin Na would agree anyway having been two up with two to play, but then Joost Liuten is a secret matchplay ninja, who could prove a real handful in a fourball like Ian Woosnam always was"
ProGolf,34ca89,FarawayFairways,2,Thu Apr 30 08:33:30 2015 UTC,"They could always readjust that next year depending on how it goes this year.

ProGolf,34ca89,Yoshiman400,2,Thu Apr 30 12:51:57 2015 UTC,"What kind of tie breakers would you use for golf for the group stage? I can't think of anything that seems fair, maybe total strokes, but that doesn't really work in match play because of concessions."
ProGolf,34ca89,jmac,3,Thu Apr 30 13:14:57 2015 UTC,"First tiebreaker: Head to head record  Second tiebreaker: Most holes won (all matches)  Third tiebreaker: Fewest holes lost (all matches)  Fourth tiebreaker: Most birdies or better (all matches, hole outs and concessions)  Fifth tiebreaker: Sudden death  EDIT: Another tiebreaker you might be able to use is widest margin of victory: a player whose biggest win was 5 & 4 trumps a player with a biggest win of 2 & 1. Similarly, 5 & 4 trumps 5 & 3 because you won the match one hole sooner, and 5 & 3 trumps 4 & 3 because the margin is wider over the same fifteen holes."
ProGolf,34ca89,Yoshiman400,2,Thu Apr 30 13:17:05 2015 UTC,"Head to head is the first sensible point of recourse. Most holes won/ lost descriminates in favour of matches that last longest. Birdies wouldn't work for the reasons you describe and is actually open to corruption if players start conceeding 30 footers to each other. Head to head, and if that was a tie, just ask the players affected to play sudden death holes"
ProGolf,34ca89,FarawayFairways,2,Thu Apr 30 14:12:17 2015 UTC,"In an eighteen hole match where draws are permitted, you can only win (or lose) a maximum of nine holes going the distance. Even then, you can theoretically win 10 & 8; as near-impossible as that is, I believe Tiger Woods has gone 9 & 8 once or twice.  Now what about a match that goes the distance? Well, those are the matches that can have the widest degree of variation, of course. You could have a slugfest where all but a few holes are won by someone, or you could have a really ""quiet"" match where all but a few holes are halved. On the other hand, if you win (lose) 4 & 3, you've already won (lost) four holes to begin with, which is either gonna help your holes won stat a lot, or hurt your holes lost stat a lot.  Besides, if you actually tried ""throwing"" a hole or two to try to boost your holes won stat, that can still work against you in a few ways. If you throw away a win and halve the hole instead, your opponent loses fewer holes. If you throw away a halve, your opponent wins more holes. And any way of giving your opponent more holes to play is still more opportunities for them to beat you.   I do see your point about conceding 30 footers. Though in theory, you're always conceding your opponent's shot first, so if you're conceding their 30 footer for birdie, that's still a birdie on their mark...but let's be honest, when you're talking about the best golfers in the world, who's really going to concede a pair of opposing 30 footers for birdie? (EDIT: Not to mention that when only one golfer advances out of the group stage, you can't keep conceding back and forth with your opponent all day to cooperatively advance.)"

ProGolf,34ca89,jmac,2,Thu Apr 30 12:43:15 2015 UTC,You can also lose a match 1 down by being 1 down on the 17th and failing to win the 18th to extend the match.

ProGolf,340z9w,what-the-what-what,4,Mon Apr 27 13:19:04 2015 UTC,"It's been a great year so far altogether, lots of big names winning (Spieth, Day, Walker, Pads, DJ, Sneds, Furyk, Rose) and a minimum of Some Random Guys winning. Closest we've had to a Some Guy winner was James Hahn and even he's kinda sorta known."
ProGolf,340z9w,SNESdrunk,2,Mon Apr 27 14:15:56 2015 UTC,I'm just trying to become a golf fan right now... any reason they don't set things up to get all of the big names in every tournament?
ProGolf,340z9w,Measure76,2,Tue Apr 28 01:44:47 2015 UTC,"To be honest, I think they do set things up to attract all the big names to every event, but it's not always possible for a number of reasons. Individual golfers choose where and when they play and they base their decisions on factors like potential winnings, number of world ranking points on offer, amount of travel involved, their own personal record on that specific course, the prestige of the event etc. So for example, one of Europe's most high profile golfers, Ian Poulter, has announced that he won't be playing the flagship European tour event next month because he personally doesn't like the course that it's played on - not much the organisers can do about that. So I'd say organisers try to attract as many top players as possible but they're aware that getting all the big names to play an event is tricky - unless it's a Major or a WGC.   Edit - missed something out there."
ProGolf,340z9w,EastofEgen,1 point,Tue Apr 28 10:56:11 2015 UTC,"They do.  Those tournaments are called the 'major' championships.  Masters, U.S. Open, British Open, and PGA Championship.  It should also be noted that the tournament with the strongest field is actually the Players Championship in 2 weeks.  Other than those 5 big events, you can't really bank on ALL of the top players attending any other event."
ProGolf,340z9w,Magnum_44,2,Wed Apr 29 19:38:49 2015 UTC,"But I guess what I'm asking is why say, the PGA, doesn't alter the rules and points format in such a way that missing a weekend would have devastating effects on a player's season.   Seems like having 3 big events each month that had all the top stars would change golf for the better.   I was pretty impressed reading about the Master's selection process, I'll go read about the Player's Championship now."
ProGolf,340z9w,Measure76,1 point,Wed Apr 29 19:52:45 2015 UTC,"You can't really dictate an independent contractors schedule. Travel, caddies, accommodations, etc. are all foot by the touring professional.  It's an investment on their part as well.  They have to find the tournaments that suit their game.  It would make no sense as a pro to keep going to an event that they miss the cut in year after year and spending thousands of dollars for nothing."
ProGolf,340z9w,Magnum_44,1 point,Wed Apr 29 19:59:12 2015 UTC,"Touring professionals are pretty mobile, if you penalise them too harshly then they'll probably just choose events or a tour that is more accommodating. If you come down hard on guys like McIlroy, Rose, Garcia, Stenson, Dubuisson, Kaymer etc. for missing PGA tour events then you'll just drive them back to the European Tour instead. Tours want as many top players as possible, driving them away is not a good idea."
ProGolf,340z9w,EastofEgen,1 point,Thu Apr 30 01:19:18 2015 UTC,The idea would be to encourage them to play every PGA event. I wouldn't want to see anything implemented that would drive players away.
ProGolf,340z9w,Measure76,1 point,Thu Apr 30 04:43:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah I get what you're saying, personally I just think that imposing very harsh penalties for missing events isn't a good idea. If golfers cannot succeed on a tour unless they play the vast majority of events then they might just cut their losses and stop playing on that tour entirely."
ProGolf,340z9w,EastofEgen,0,Thu Apr 30 08:57:34 2015 UTC,"Sorry to be 'that guy' but it isn't the 'British Open', it's 'The Open', or 'The Open Championship'.   But yeah, I agree, no regular tour event can expect all the big names to attend because there are so many different factors at play."

Faldo has always been in the latter camp, but then I don't see that him not wanting someone else to break his record is a crime to be honest. It's his perrogative. It looks like a non issue in truth that a jounralist with little else to contribute has decided to stir up. Best left uncommented really (so that stuffs me from taking my own advice)"
ProGolf,342ad2,FarawayFairways,7,Mon Apr 27 21:44:36 2015 UTC,"Nick Faldo's not a particularly popular guy but to be honest I think my reaction would be exactly the same. Spieth's a great talent and I'm sure Faldo appreciates that but would you really be rooting for someone to surpass your own achievements? Also, pretty much no one is going to match Jack for grace and integrity."

Lots of athletes would, but not everybody - and Jack has said publicly, like other major athletes, that records are there to be broken. Only the most insecure or egotistical athletes are horrified by the prospect of someone else taking them even slightly out of the limelight.  But you are right first and foremost - Faldo is an ass. Cheering when Spieth flew the green? What a douchenozzle."

ProGolf,342ad2,FarawayFairways,3,Thu Apr 30 16:32:02 2015 UTC,"I think for a bit of context too, it's probably worth remembering that Faldo wouldn't have been the most naturally gifted of players. We need to understand perhaps that his success came very much as a result of preparation, dedication, and practise. What he lacked in flair he made up for in application. These types of people often tend to be very self-centred and ultra competitive (you might argue that they actually need to be) as they have to compensate for a deficit elsewhere.   Jack holds any number of records, but you also sense he has a much better appreciation of his own place in the world of golf and as a human being. I think Jack was probably more alert as to how Faldo's comment would likely play out, and was trying to dilute it for him  Faldo has always had an acidic aloofness about him, but that also ensures he's sometimes good value for an opinion. Do you really want a whole load of anodyne commentators playing it safe and simply drawing their salaries year after year, or would you rather have someone who lends a technical insight and is prepared to throw the odd pebble in the water?"

They play roughly half the weeks in a year just like any other sport, except events are 4 days long with a 5th day for a pro-am and possibly a tuesday prep round. Then there's travel time.  There are typically 2 events per week to choose from over two continents; they're turning down events even when they play. Now this wrap-around nonsense. Wentworth hasn't exactly been the most well-received design either, no offense to Ernie.  Anyway, why would Ian travel across the Atlantic to play an event he's missed the cut at more often than not? Is he expected to take a net-loss for the week and lower his OWGR, making it more difficult to qualify for events he does have success at such as the WGC match play, all for the sake of some nationalist obligation? Ridiculous. It would be stupid on his part if he did play, which he's obviously realized.  Horses for courses. If I were a pro I'd play when and where I wanted, end of story."

Trump said he was going to build the best par 3 in the world on the ninth, well he's going to have legitimate claims"
ProGolf,33cn50,GnarlyBear,2,Tue Apr 21 19:07:30 2015 UTC,"Seems like a lot of unneeded change by 'Mr Trump' (definitely a drinking game there the amount of times it is said.   Taking out a famous dog leg and making it a straight hole? Pointless. Raised greens on a links course? Pointless and it isn't really a links course when you're reshaping land. Creating a 'signature' par 3 and trying to playoff the postage stamp name of another iconic venue? Pointless and stolen history.   Its good to see investment in golf and his purpose built Scottish course is supposedly tremendous but does a world famous, major hosting venue really need extensive changes since Trump put his name on it?"
ProGolf,33cn50,what-the-what-what,1 point,Wed Apr 22 14:37:12 2015 UTC,"I agree the 'Postage Stamp' thing was a bit clumsy, albeit I did smile given that the name of the sixth hole at Troon, is 'Turnberry'. Ultimately though Turnberry is a world class venue that should be carving out it's own identity and not needing to borrow from Troon.  Raised greens aren't exactly alien to links courses. Golf Digest rate Royal Dornoch Scotland's best, and the course is dominated by them. Indeed Tom Watson described the second shot at the second hole there, as the hardest in golf (it's a par 3!). My slight gripe with Dornoch is that they use a lot of greenside bunkers to deny the bump and run option, and so force the aerial route instead, albeit testing your iron play is legitimate of course  I don't have too much problem with losing the dog leg on 18. Most great closing holes have a straight line of procession, like an aisle in a cathedral. It's better for spectator purposes. In an ideal world I'd like to re-route the Wilson Burn and get it to snake across the fairway aka Carnoustie  The 9th hole is better for being a par 3 with the tee shot played across the sea rather than in land to one of the most quixotic fairways in golf. Mackenzie Ross got this hole wrong, Trump's architects are really putting it right  The 10th is a fantastic improvement as well for relocating the tee which makes the shot an almost carbon copy of the 1st at Machrihanish with all the same risk and reward scenarios plus an unforgiving penalty for biting off too much  I think it's an improvement to be honest, and I have some sympathy with the view that once you've worked out how to make something better, then why not do it. Don't forget that all of this has R&A approval and blessing etc they've wanted someone to invest in Turnberry for decades, it isn't just a vanity project of one man alone, the R&A sign off on it"

He was a great golfer and no one can deny his record, but the sheer arrogance and lack of class he exuded turned most people off him.  It's no wonder he lost the Ryder Cup as captain, as he didn't really command the respect of the team."

When Seve won at St Andrews there were no shortage of people willing Tom home, to complete what would have been a remarkable clean sweep of the Scottish venues. I'm not sure Tom ever fully recovered from losing at St Andrews? He was in the driving seat but overhit a club on the 17th.

Plus, Faldo isn't contracted with ESPN whereas Watson has been used as an extra voice for the Open once in a while, so I think ESPN will give Watson a bit more exposure anyway.  EDIT: Actually, I believe Faldo is brought into ESPN for the Masters, but A) that's the only event they've ever used him for, and B) that's an agreement with Augusta National, whereas the Open Championship is an agreement with the R&A."

Having said that, Nicklaus was paired with Watson for his last appearance, and there was no guarantee that it wouldn't have been Tom's last round at St Andrews either, as he needed a special wild card to get in this time.

There's lots of reasons why America keeps losing, and they operate in waves over different temporal horizons. Some stretch back decades, and some are engrained in the American sporting landscape, others are more pertinent to the zietgeist etc. There's no single cause  A vast majority of American's I speak with however are pretty oblivious to these (you grow up with them, so you don't naturally tend to question what looks so obvious to an outsiders view). The tendancy instead is to operate an excuse carousel blaming the last visible thing that becomes expendable by way of scapegoat, whilst rarely getting stuck into the appetite of the players and their half hearted preparation. There are some really basic things they could do to address some of them by way of paradigm shifts in the way they approach the match, and some things which they can't do anything about, but could seek to manage better.   Tom Watson, was incidentally the last American to successfully captain on European soil. The appreciation of Tom lies in his five Open wins, and particularly so in Scotland where he's continued to be a fine ambassador for the country. It owes nothing to the idea that he contributed to a Ryder Cup defeat. America started losing that specific match about June time when the first fault lines began appearing"

Same reason Bubba is playing in China. Last years Irish Open had a SoF of 115. This year it may get all the way up to 140 or 150! It won't even beat some of the weakest PGATour events like the Frys.com, although it may come close to tying the McGladrey's SoF!   (And no, before you say it, I'm not a Tiger fan...nor am I a McIlroy hater. I just think it's absurd to say he's the most powerful because of some weak European Tour event)"

He had some clutch shots in those two days (and come on, that birdie on 13 on Saturday was pretty impressive), and I can guarantee you a lot of the players that weekend were probably smiling a bit inside when they found out his scores and that he still had a bit of the magic. It's like Phil at the last two majors--he came into both of them with very little momentum and then finishes T2 out of nowhere in the middle of some very loaded fields, and his competitors were thrilled he had it going."

At the 3 other majors, I can literally watch Tiger, Rory, Phil or any other big name hole by hole. I could literally watch his every shot of any of the 3 other majors. They don't allow this at Augusta, the biggest event of the the entire year in golf. That was his point dude.."

ProGolf,32ghqf,Darnzee91,2,Tue Apr 14 19:39:28 2015 UTC,"Are you kidding me? When he posted those tweets, Tiger was -3 through the first 4 holes... AND IT WASN'T ON TV OR ANY STREAMING SERVICE ONLINE!!! Everyone who is a casual golf fan wants to watch that. More importantly, people who aren't golf fans would tune in to watch Tiger -3 through 4 holes. Give me a break."
ProGolf,32ghqf,clubchalupa,2,Tue Apr 14 22:34:17 2015 UTC,"Bill Simmons is the true casual (american) golf fan- only tune into the majors on the weekend if Tiger is on the leaderboard. But you have to admit he had a point, the TV coverage was horrible. You simply couldn't watch golf all day except for the online coverage. If who you wanted to see played in a morning or even early afternoon round and wasn't the featured group, you were out of luck.  Tiger was who he wanted to watch (as it was for a lot of other fans that hadn't seen him on a major leaderboard in months...years) and he couldn't because the coverage was horrible. He just has more followers than the other thousands of people that ragged on it.  I don't claim to know the TV rights and broadcasting angles, but I don't know why they don't show the masters on some network from the first group through the last (at least on the weekend). Just seems like bad business."

ProGolf,32dp5z,jmt970,5,Mon Apr 13 02:46:25 2015 UTC,"You're way off.  For one, Zach didn't drift off into obscurity.  He's been a mainstay on US national teams and as the announcers mentioned this past week is possibly only another major away from a hall of fame career.  So even if Spieth did follow Zach's trajectory it would be a solid career.  But Zach wasn't 21 when he won the Masters and he didn't tie the all time scoring record.  Nor has he ever been #2 in the world.  I would be shocked if Spieth didn't have at least 2-3 more majors by the time he's 25 with the talent he's shown.  Also, Immelmann definitely has to be at the bottom of the list for champions in the past decade."

Second, Jordan is 21 years old, #2 in the world, and already has 5 PGA tour wins. Zach Johnson is 39 years old and only has 11 wins. Just let that sink in... Spieth has almost 20 years to catch Zach Johnson, and he's already half way there. He's already got a major. He finished second in the Masters last year and has 8 top ten finishes already this year.  If you think this kid is going anywhere, you are delusional.

ProGolf,32dp5z,monetetravel,2,Sun Apr 12 23:06:58 2015 UTC,"Not to diminish Spieth's accomplishments, but it has not been 39 years since the last wire-to-wire victory at the Masters. Trevor Immelman did it in 2008, but the media would rather ignore that since he was tied for the lead with Justin Rose after the first round, and 39 years sounds impressive."
ProGolf,32dp5z,Shine_On_Your_Chevy,5,Mon Apr 13 00:48:10 2015 UTC,They haven't ignored it. I've heard several analysts say that he is the only 54 hole solo leader in the last 39 years.
ProGolf,32dp5z,Pappy091,2,Mon Apr 13 11:00:37 2015 UTC,Nice that both Rory and Phil acknowledged the great play of Jordan in their interviews.  Show's class.  Tiger did not.  He thought if he sunk a few more putts he could have won. But he did pop his wristbone back into place.

ProGolf,32cz8j,Twoto2,25,Sun Apr 12 19:23:40 2015 UTC,"All I ask is that you read my whole comment before commenting  No, and it's because of the time, and the person. Jordan is a GREAT golfer, but he's a young white guy playing what is now a young white man's game and there are other guys doing what he is doing. Plus it's Under Armour, and there is nothing really sexy about Under Armour atm.  Tiger on the other hand took a company we all knew, and most loved (Michael Jordan), and dominated when he came on the scene. Plus he was a black kid playing an old white man's game. If Tiger were 21 today it wouldn't be the same, he came at a time that created a perfect storm for him to become Tiger.  Jordan won't capture the imagination of all kids, minorities, casual fans, etc... Tiger was able to because there wasn't much competition on that front.   I hope Jordan wins a ton of Majors and he and Rory give us great battles for years to come. But I cannot imagine us getting another Tiger. I can't see another golfer being as marketable, dominat, charismatic, or as polarizing as Tiger in my lifetime.  I think Speith, like Rory will have an incredible career and lots a people will be wearing his shirts and hats and shoes. But the question was: Can Speith do for UA, that Tiger did for Nike... I don't think anyone can do what Tiger did for Nike, for any  company at all."
ProGolf,32cz8j,nevinem,4,Sun Apr 12 23:33:03 2015 UTC,"Well-put. Tiger was one of a kind, and simply put, there will never be another like him—both on the course and off the course."
ProGolf,32cz8j,gloomswarm,7,Sun Apr 12 23:54:59 2015 UTC,"Very well said. I agree with your points. Tiger came when there was still much upside to golf. Prize money pre and post Tiger is night and day. Tiger brought golf into the middle class homes. Jordan will definitely help UA with their golf line of clothes. But, using the analogy of stocks, golf is AAPL and Tiger is Steve Jobs."
ProGolf,32cz8j,aaa_dad,2,Mon Apr 13 01:07:42 2015 UTC,"I agree with what you say about getting golf in the non golfers homes on TV because of Tiger. But I highly disagree on UA not being very popular. I would say it's the most popular sports clothing today. Granted UA doesn't have any true golf equipment, just shoes, clothes, and hats. If Jordan continues to win events, especially majors within the next year, I could see UA start producing clubs. But honestly the weekend golfer has been on a steep decline the last decade. Tiger came along when disposable income was more plentiful, not so much today."
ProGolf,32cz8j,mreatsum,1 point,Mon Apr 13 03:27:43 2015 UTC,"I will admit, after typing it out, I was going to add a small caveat about Under Armour, but I thought I went on too long already lol.  I will agree with you, UA does have a buzz to it and makes a great product, I just don't know if they will be able to market their golf apparel with Jordan the same way Nike did with Tiger. Almost how it took ""PC"" (read Microsoft) what seems like forever to market as well as Apple did. I don't want to argue about the actual product but, I think you get my point about the advertising."
ProGolf,32cz8j,nevinem,1 point,Mon Apr 13 09:46:13 2015 UTC,Tiger transcended the game. Even now I feel like there's a LOT of people watching that only really care about watching Tiger to see what he's doing
ProGolf,32cz8j,RedditUsername123456,0,Mon Apr 13 09:48:47 2015 UTC,"I don't think any one could say that Spieth can do the same for golf that Tiger did but I think its incredibly possible, if not likely, that he he can do the same for Under Armour that Tiger did for Nike. Under Armour is a hot brand with young people in most of the major sports, football especially, and he even more so in the college game with all their uniform options and colors. Look what Fowler did playing fairly above average golf up until last year with Puma, if you go to any course in the country right now you will see Puma on almost all of the younger players. Spieth is obviously a much bigger talent than Fowler and can absolutely bring Under Armour up to the next level as he gets further into his career and they attract more players who may be more ""outlandish"" in their clothing like the use of neon green in Rory's and Casey's clothes this week. I think in time he can bring UA to where Tiger brought Nike, even introducing them to the club and equipment areas, regardless of if he can make the changes to golf that Tiger did."
ProGolf,32cz8j,rumspringahh,1 point,Mon Apr 13 13:47:02 2015 UTC,"I wonder if we can find a study that shows how much Nike sold just TW items, vs what UA golf has sold period, apparel only. I think it would give us a better understanding of how much growth happened to Nike golf after Tiger and then make an assumption of what that number would need to be like for Spieth to have the same impact in the years to come."
ProGolf,32cz8j,nevinem,7,Mon Apr 13 14:43:34 2015 UTC,No. They don't make equipment so that would be kind of hard to do with apparel only.

People wanted to crown McIlroy as the new Tiger (myslef included) but Spieth looks more like the new Tiger than Rory ever did. He is a lot more steady and doesn't need to be playing perfect to win.
ProGolf,32bovd,ashdrewness,14,Sun Apr 12 18:10:30 2015 UTC,"I think Rory is more like Phil. Unstoppable when playing his best but very streaky. Jordan is a steady player with a deadly putter, more like Tiger."

ProGolf,32bovd,SketchArtist,8,Sun Apr 12 12:06:08 2015 UTC,"Wow, that backstop just make it look like both Jordan and Justin's balls should funnel straight to the hole, but they just hang up."
ProGolf,32bovd,SketchArtist,8,Sun Apr 12 18:57:19 2015 UTC,If that bunker was  paved you could skate it.
ProGolf,32bovd,SketchArtist,3,Sun Apr 12 19:42:16 2015 UTC,If that bunker was a wave you could surf it.

ProGolf,32bovd,tmv4,8,Sun Apr 12 22:23:48 2015 UTC,Glad Tiger was able to shake off that wrist pain from the 10th hole so he could finish today. He more than earned that ovation this weekend. So happy he decided to play -- the tourney was better for it.
ProGolf,32bovd,sourdsmokin,7,Sun Apr 12 22:29:11 2015 UTC,"Damn, I didn't even think about this... Jordan got through the -19 curse, but now he faces the -20 curse!"

ProGolf,32bovd,SketchArtist,5,Sun Apr 12 19:03:21 2015 UTC,"I haven't seen anyone predict the final score. I think 271 will be enough to close the deal, but I really hope that Speith goes into the 60s and breaks the record."
ProGolf,32bovd,mreatsum,5,Sun Apr 12 13:42:56 2015 UTC,Hoping Phil can make a big push today. Lefties gotta stick together.
ProGolf,32bovd,whitecompass,4,Sun Apr 12 13:17:31 2015 UTC,"-16 will force a playoff. Wacky shit will happen, like a Spieth ace on 16 despite shooting a 74. Tiger and Rory will go low, but not low enough. Tiger misses out on playoff by one stroke, shoots 63. Rose wins in playoff over Mickelson."

ProGolf,32bulh,IngloriousBuckeye,2,Sun Apr 12 16:35:05 2015 UTC,"The one year contract with CBS is interesting, so the club can wield its total control over the broadcast, including arbitrary and capricious gestures like banning regular CBS commentator Gary McCord for having committed the egregious sin of calling the ""patrons"" a ""mob"" in passing many years ago. Speaking of which, there appeared to be quite a few knuckle-dragging louts in the gallery this week. Those badges must really be trading heavily on the secondary market."

ProGolf,329yw8,Twoto2,2,Sat Apr 11 22:58:38 2015 UTC,I was originally looking for a set of golf clubs.  The OP is referring to a set of balls because the cameraman is stood direct in line with the shot.

ProGolf,329yw8,Twoto2,11,Sun Apr 12 02:58:22 2015 UTC,I think pgatour instagram posted the picture the guy took. Apologies for screenshot. Sweet shot though.  http://i.imgur.com/V26pk49.jpg

ProGolf,329yw8,joetromboni,2,Sun Apr 12 01:43:51 2015 UTC,"I wonder if those camera guys are required to wear a cup, for insurance purposes?"
ProGolf,329yw8,mreatsum,2,Sun Apr 12 00:21:44 2015 UTC,Kinda surprised he didn't ask them to move it. It doesn't look like a very permanent camera setup. Particularly after his bunker shot in the playoff last week eheh.

ProGolf,329yw8,c-fox,1 point,Mon Apr 13 15:14:11 2015 UTC,Isn't that the ShotLink measurer? It's basically surveying equipment that measures shot positions and distances. It's tied to GPS so it likely can't be quickly moved.   The guy should have at least stepped away from the machine.

ProGolf,32asay,ExactlyUnlikeTea,7,Sun Apr 12 05:13:31 2015 UTC,PGA tour should track shanks as a stat. Willing to bet Webb Simpson leads.
ProGolf,32asay,thereisnoreasoning,3,Sun Apr 12 05:11:43 2015 UTC,"For a Tour winner, it blows my fucking mind how often Webb shanks shots."
ProGolf,32asay,hughtankman,2,Sun Apr 12 05:34:47 2015 UTC,Without that belly putter he wouldn't have a major.
ProGolf,32asay,ISISFieldAgent,3,Sun Apr 12 11:35:30 2015 UTC,Would Scott have a major without his long putter?
ProGolf,32asay,hughtankman,3,Sun Apr 12 16:08:05 2015 UTC,I don't believe he would.
ProGolf,32asay,ISISFieldAgent,1 point,Sun Apr 12 16:08:50 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I'm not a fan of the long putters, as I've always been a traditionalist when it comes to equipment, but a win is a win. I feel bad for guys like Stadler who are experimenting putting left handed because he can't putt with a 35""."
ProGolf,32asay,hughtankman,1 point,Sun Apr 12 16:10:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah they earned the wins under the rules that were in place but I'm very glad they are being banned in the next rule changes. I suspect Scott, Webb, and all those guys who can't putt conventionally will go right back to irrelevance. Scott still has a dynamite swing but his short game especially putting is poor. Even the long putter only brings him up around tour average without it he is abysmal."
ProGolf,32asay,ISISFieldAgent,1 point,Sun Apr 12 16:21:38 2015 UTC,"I think Scott could still do pretty well, he hasn't played terribly without the long putter"

ProGolf,32asay,Slam_Dunk_for,1 point,Sun Apr 12 16:00:43 2015 UTC,Yeah and that shot by tiger was the worst shot in the history of pro golf. Fucking announcers.  It was atrocious though.
ProGolf,32arzz,Twoto2,10,Sun Apr 12 03:22:23 2015 UTC,All he had to do was hit the exact same shot he hit off the tee.
ProGolf,32asj4,Twoto2,2,Sun Apr 12 03:28:00 2015 UTC,He was probably getting a bunch of tweets about it and responded.
ProGolf,32a14j,Twoto2,2,Sat Apr 11 23:09:07 2015 UTC,Foreshadowing?
ProGolf,32a14j,bumpin222,3,Sat Apr 11 23:30:49 2015 UTC,Except neither have a chance at winning this week.
ProGolf,32a14j,joetromboni,2,Sat Apr 11 23:54:40 2015 UTC,The commercial didn't specify that.
ProGolf,32a14j,gloomswarm,2,Sun Apr 12 02:15:27 2015 UTC,Would've been even crazier if Nike had scripted a blue shirt for Rory...looks like he's wearing yellow
ProGolf,32a14j,thekingofcatsandrats,-1,Sat Apr 11 23:39:00 2015 UTC,Rory is going to abuse Tiger.  Poor Tiger about to get his ass kicked by Rory again.
ProGolf,32a14j,ISISFieldAgent,3,Sun Apr 12 02:19:46 2015 UTC,Well let's see who has won 4 green Jackets and who fell apart with a huge lead on Sunday I'm 2011? I'm gonna take the guy with the jackets. Augusta owns Rory but Tiger has been making Augusta his bitch since 96.
ProGolf,32a14j,thekingofcatsandrats,2,Sun Apr 12 11:37:49 2015 UTC,"Lol.  Rory is just humiliating Tiger today as usual.  Rory is just crushing him.  Rory's won 4 majors since 2011 it's time to get a new line.  His last 3 majors:  win, win and a likely top 5."
ProGolf,32a14j,HitchmoMcStang,2,Sun Apr 12 22:00:24 2015 UTC,"I think the pairing will benefit both. Obviously they can't give each other tips, but they get along and know each other well so will be watching each other closely.  Tiger seems more comfortable than Rory at Augusta. As much as I'm a fan of the irishman, I think he should have done more prep work instead of taking time off. Less time shopping for private jets, more time making sure you can still afford one in 5 years!"
ProGolf,32a14j,TroyBarnesBrain,5,Sun Apr 12 02:46:15 2015 UTC,Don't bother using logic and reason with this guy.  Check his post history and see for yourself.
ProGolf,32a14j,thekingofcatsandrats,2,Sun Apr 12 04:06:09 2015 UTC,Logic?? You root for the biggest cheat in golf history.  He's a pathological liar.  He claimed to dislocated his wrist today.

ProGolf,32a14j,Bubbauk,2,Sun Apr 12 05:18:19 2015 UTC,"I'm so glad speith dropped a couple of shots at the end, going to make Sunday a lot more exciting"
ProGolf,32a14j,ExactlyUnlikeTea,2,Sun Apr 12 08:51:00 2015 UTC,"Personally I want him to win so glad isn't the word I'd use, but I expected a weaker round from him yesterday (my guess beforehand was a 72)"
ProGolf,32a14j,Bubbauk,1 point,Sun Apr 12 11:37:14 2015 UTC,"I want him to win too, I really like him but I want it to be an exciting Sunday."
ProGolf,32a14j,ISISFieldAgent,1 point,Sun Apr 12 11:41:41 2015 UTC,Yeah 4 is reachable especially for a rookie on Sunday with the lead. We'll see if he pulls a Rory.
ProGolf,32c47v,Twoto2,1 point,Sun Apr 12 14:55:19 2015 UTC,"When you say ""in exchange"" it sounds like it was some sort of agreed upon transaction."
ProGolf,32aci1,Twoto2,7,Sun Apr 12 00:56:04 2015 UTC,That will be Tiger's real lasting contribution to the game- the money.
ProGolf,32aci1,ExactlyUnlikeTea,6,Sun Apr 12 05:20:59 2015 UTC,"And fitness, level of competition, making the game a mainstream sport, etc. Tiger changed golf forever. He made the sport better."
ProGolf,32aci1,ISISFieldAgent,0,Sun Apr 12 11:42:02 2015 UTC,"He made the sport more popular, not necessarily better. The long ball era Tiger helped introduce isn't necessarily a positive."
ProGolf,32aci1,ExactlyUnlikeTea,3,Sun Apr 12 11:44:25 2015 UTC,The prov1 introduced the long ball era. Just happened to be in 2000 when Tiger was utterly dominant.
ProGolf,32aci1,CaveBacon,1 point,Sun Apr 12 15:32:50 2015 UTC,"The ProV1 was a factor, sure, but you can't say Tiger didn't help introduce that era."

ProGolf,329pml,Kash87,7,Sun Apr 12 16:28:11 2015 UTC,Probably the worst shot ever at the Masters
ProGolf,329pml,WildcatRob,2,Sat Apr 11 21:47:54 2015 UTC,Not even the worst shot of the day. See Harris English shank...
ProGolf,329pml,wardamntrees,2,Sun Apr 12 01:42:44 2015 UTC,Greg Norman would have issue with that.
ProGolf,329pml,joetromboni,1 point,Sun Apr 12 01:44:44 2015 UTC,There was a guy (a nobody) who shanked one on 12 tee so bad it almost went in the woods on the left of 13. He was like 25 yards back from the creek and 50-70 yards from the green. That's my nomination.

ProGolf,328dl6,Twoto2,12,Sat Apr 11 14:27:37 2015 UTC,"Maybe they can get along today. Tiger hasn't seemed as ""closed off"", if you will, this year. Maybe he tells Sergio ""nice tweet"" when they're on the first tee.   Doesn't really matter to me. Tiger probably needs that edge to play well. I just want to see the guy shut up the naysayers that think he's done. He made the cut, which was apparently some kind of measuring stick for his progress."
ProGolf,328dl6,Willie_Mays_Hayes,7,Sat Apr 11 14:47:23 2015 UTC,"I don't think there will be any issues. They won't be super friendly,  but there won't be any issues at all."
ProGolf,328dl6,Travkin2,7,Sat Apr 11 16:41:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Tiger never really got worked up about the last confrontation. He probably just knows Sergio will b Sergio. The Players was just Bethpage part 2. I'm sure Sergio still has a part 3 in him, but it probably won't happen at Augusta."

If the network covering the Masters does something they don't like, they'll drop'em in a heartbeat. They prefer exclusivity as much as possible, they feel you should be rewarded for attending vs just tuning in at home. Everyone toes the line they set.

I didn't want any conflicts with college football season since I get UGA season tix. There are eight other months of the year for kids to be born.

ProGolf,3283k4,worsttofirst,4,Sat Apr 11 12:58:01 2015 UTC,Ha. Spieth basically leads the tour at putts in the 15-20ft range. He'll just aim for the center of the green & play to his strengths.
ProGolf,3283k4,ashdrewness,5,Sat Apr 11 14:58:52 2015 UTC,"At this point, that's all he needs to do. The bridies will come, but it will take a really low number to catch him if he doesn't pull a Norman. Fairways and greens, man."
ProGolf,325eu1,Twoto2,8,Fri Apr 10 18:54:36 2015 UTC,The most incredible thing about this is that he had so many barely missed putts/chips this round - his score could have been much lower! Unbelievable.

Seriously they've got like 2 hours of sportscenter* including talking heads at Augusta but they don't actually show the tournament? It's completely antiquated stuff like the Master's coverage that helps drive down golf's popularity.
ProGolf,325eu1,jmac,8,Fri Apr 10 19:05:57 2015 UTC,Spieth was the marquee group on masters.com I watched the majority of his round.

ProGolf,325eu1,PresidentJonStewart,14,Fri Apr 10 23:00:37 2015 UTC,"Strongly disagree with you here. The Masters has probably the best coverage of any sporting event.   On top of the main video channel, there's coverage of every player going through Amen Corner and Holes 15 & 16, 4 featured groups throughout the day, plus an ""in depth analysis"" channel throughout the day. Not to mention highlights are posted almost immediately after the players finish their holes. What more could you want?"
ProGolf,325eu1,stone_solid,13,Fri Apr 10 19:35:33 2015 UTC,What more could you want?   For them to cover the entire course for the duration of the tournament.  The coverage now is the equivalent of showing only 3rd downs and player cams on 3 star players during the first half of the super bowl.  It's bullshit.
ProGolf,325eu1,greebytime,3,Fri Apr 10 20:53:50 2015 UTC,"They're getting there. I work with the broadcasters at the event. They made some MASSIVE improvements this year. It isn't like flipping a switch and you get everything. There was 10s of millions of dollars invested to get where we are now, and they will be investing 10 of millions more in the coming years."
ProGolf,325eu1,rex_llama,10,Sat Apr 11 00:59:56 2015 UTC,"All of that is only online until 12PM PST. I watched all of Spieth's round online but if I couldn't do that, and had to wait for TV, I would have missed the whole thing."
ProGolf,325eu1,greebytime,11,Fri Apr 10 19:42:23 2015 UTC,"I've posted this before, but I don't think some of you guys realize how good we have it now.  Just 15-20 years ago, Augusta National would only allow TV coverage of the leaders on the back 9. Even on Sunday.    I agree with /u/mapunk, the coverage really is pretty damn good.  I'm sure ESPN would love to throw a couple extra hours of live coverage on ESPN or ESPN2, but Augusta National is the one calling the shots."
ProGolf,325eu1,PresidentJonStewart,3,Fri Apr 10 20:01:57 2015 UTC,"I realize it, I've lived it. But it's just weird to have Jim Nantz and the entire CBS crew covering the entire tournament - but NOT SHOW most of that to anyone who isn't in front of the computer. Yes, it's better than it used to be, but CBS is paying for 100% coverage but not being able to show it all except online. It's just weird."
ProGolf,325eu1,mapunk,3,Fri Apr 10 20:04:30 2015 UTC,"IT's better than it used to be, but it used to be absolute shit and now it's just bad."

ProGolf,325eu1,mapunk,3,Fri Apr 10 20:36:28 2015 UTC,"BEFORE 12PM PST the only way to watch was streaming. If you wanted to watch on this thing called a 'television' you had to wait until 12PM PST. It's weird to invest all that resources by CBS and not utilize it on the format it was originally intended to.  My original post said ""only online until 12PM PST."" It should have said ""online ONLY until 12PM PST."" Sorry for the confusion."
ProGolf,325eu1,greebytime,2,Fri Apr 10 20:37:34 2015 UTC,"I see what you mean, but I'm sure the majority of golf fans have high speed internet, right? So what's the big deal? Showing video on the internet still requires all those resources you mentioned (and more), and online video allows for better interaction, more versatility, etc. I really see no problem with trying to be innovative by moving their video to the internet..."
ProGolf,325eu1,mapunk,3,Fri Apr 10 20:46:55 2015 UTC,"No, not everybody has both high speed internet and the ability to watch it live. Many folks record to watch later - can't do that with streaming. I'm not arguing against putting it available streaming but if you are doing so, air it on CBS or one of its affiliates. I get that the AGNC doesn't want or need all of our money, and that to some degree they think it's making it more special by not being able to see it all but they're just making it harder for more people to become fans. Obsessives like you and me will climb over walls to see whatever we can, but since they're ALREADY putting it online, put it on TV too.   I'm at home right now and it was so dumb for me to be watching the gorgeous Masters on my 15"" laptop screen when I have a 50"" HDTV. That's the big deal.   I'm not saying one or the other, I'm saying BOTH. It widens the audience, gets more people watching and caring. With literally no extra costs besides pre-empting some terrible shows CBS is probably losing money on anyway."
ProGolf,325eu1,greebytime,2,Fri Apr 10 20:58:06 2015 UTC,"Valid points, especially about DVR.  I know AT&T and DirecTV do have dedicated channels to the Masters feeds similar to masters.com and I think they show that video all day (although I'm not entirely sure). This still doesn't help regular cable customers though.  By the way, I'd highly suggest getting a device to stream from your computer to your TV. I have a $30 Chromecast and can stream anything on my monitor to my TV. It's amazing."
ProGolf,325eu1,socoamaretto,2,Fri Apr 10 21:09:29 2015 UTC,Yeah I think I'm getting a Chromecast. But I do have DirecTV and the channels were all blacked out until 12PM. Super weird and lame.
ProGolf,325eu1,greebytime,-1,Fri Apr 10 21:18:37 2015 UTC,"You should've just hooked your computer up to your TV then, I really don't see the issue."

ProGolf,325eu1,FarawayFairways,1 point,Sat Apr 11 00:33:38 2015 UTC,Exactly. You can even watch it crystal clear on your phone.
ProGolf,325eu1,mapunk,9,Sat Apr 11 00:26:37 2015 UTC,"BBC coverage of the Open. About 10 hours live golf everyday. No adverts allowed. No subscription other than the license fee (circa £120 per household a year) which covers the broadcasters entire output for every programme. American network coverage might be innovative, but it's borderline unwatchable given the barrage of adverts the viewer is subjected to. Last years USPGA was shocking. I honestly don't know how people can watch a montage of four shots followed by a cut for adverts. I'd just give up (whilst also making a note to boycott the products that were ruining my enjoyment)  Sadly the BBC has lost the rights after Troon 2016, and Sky take over. That means blocks of about 3 or 4 mins adverts every 20 mins. The BBC take CBS feed of the Masters for the final 2 days, and have to cut back for studio analysis when America dives away for adverts. Once you've been used to watching advert free golf, it does become difficult .  I should point out though, for all the free to view television in the UK that golf has traditionally enjoyed, there's little recent evidence of an upswing in participation"
ProGolf,325eu1,stone_solid,7,Fri Apr 10 20:00:49 2015 UTC,The Masters has always had very low amount of commercials compared to any other sport. Around 4min per hour IIR.

ProGolf,323y6l,SweetWalnut,5,Fri Apr 10 16:40:27 2015 UTC,Charlie Hoffman is 2 under and quietly having a great day himself. Might be the only guy who has a chance of keeping up with Jordan.
ProGolf,323y6l,nycgarbage,6,Fri Apr 10 17:03:22 2015 UTC,15 feet left for tiger's 3rd birdie in 4 holes
ProGolf,323y6l,gth829c,5,Fri Apr 10 17:08:44 2015 UTC,"Beautiful approach from Tiger on 11. Which, by the time my slow-typing ass finishes writing this comment, six others will have commented on by now."
ProGolf,323y6l,SketchArtist,3,Fri Apr 10 17:25:47 2015 UTC,"Although, maybe if I tried typing with something other than my ass, I'd be faster. replies to self"
ProGolf,323y6l,SketchArtist,5,Fri Apr 10 17:27:58 2015 UTC,"Very nice shot from the trees on 11 for Tiger, to about 13 feet below the hole."
ProGolf,323y6l,grc1435,5,Fri Apr 10 17:26:26 2015 UTC,Well that turned out to be a fantastic miss.  Great approach.
ProGolf,323y6l,RuckNaked,5,Fri Apr 10 17:26:55 2015 UTC,ANOTHER birdie for Spieth
ProGolf,323y6l,Codyyblake1,4,Fri Apr 10 17:28:35 2015 UTC,"Damn, if Tiger had been able to put up a 70 or 71 on Thursday like he normally does he'd be tied for 4th or 3rd"
ProGolf,323y6l,FreeEdgar_2013,3,Fri Apr 10 17:32:40 2015 UTC,If he doesn't hit that ball in the water + 3 putt on 1 it's a 71.
ProGolf,323y6l,grc1435,3,Fri Apr 10 17:37:04 2015 UTC,Still hard to believe that at 11 strokes back he's already T12
ProGolf,323y6l,Twoto2,4,Fri Apr 10 17:36:06 2015 UTC,"It occurs to me that after his round yesterday, Spieth said he wasn't even aware that the course record was 63. If that's the case, I'd be very surprised if he knew about Floyd's 36-hole mark, and that parring in will tie him the record. Which probably works in his favor, I'd say."
ProGolf,323y6l,SketchArtist,6,Fri Apr 10 17:33:57 2015 UTC,Damn Stenson just broke an iron over his leg after hitting it in the water on #15

ProGolf,323y6l,SketchArtist,2,Fri Apr 10 18:07:30 2015 UTC,Tournament is going to be over before the coverage begins on Friday.
ProGolf,323y6l,nycgarbage,5,Fri Apr 10 18:16:10 2015 UTC,"At -14, Spieth can play even par the rest of the way and wins or gets into a playoff in 36 of the last 40 Masters."
ProGolf,323y6l,direwolf71,5,Fri Apr 10 18:31:15 2015 UTC,"Gorgeous approach at 18 from Spieth, using the backstop. All-time major 36-hole record is a 7-foot putt away."
ProGolf,323y6l,SketchArtist,6,Fri Apr 10 18:46:10 2015 UTC,Dustin Johnson has 2 eagles today.....on the front 9
ProGolf,323y6l,Swoosh_312,4,Fri Apr 10 19:16:28 2015 UTC,Rickie with four birdies in the final six holes to make the cut at +1.  I think my reverse jinx helped a little.
ProGolf,323y6l,Zemulon,6,Fri Apr 10 19:55:43 2015 UTC,"I seriously think the pro tracer should be used more, if not on every shot. It adds much more perspective to the viewer and it's pretty cool to watch these guys ball flights."
ProGolf,323y6l,Bacon-Stripz,4,Fri Apr 10 20:36:16 2015 UTC,McIlroy currently outside the cut line..
ProGolf,323y6l,defenestrat0r,5,Fri Apr 10 20:45:37 2015 UTC,Dustin Johnson inches away on 15 setting up his 3rd eagle of the day
ProGolf,323y6l,Bacon-Stripz,5,Fri Apr 10 21:05:08 2015 UTC,Crap. Rory needs a new celeb girlfriend to break up with.
ProGolf,323y6l,sexibilia,7,Fri Apr 10 22:09:06 2015 UTC,"Heheh. Simmer down there, Jizzbot!"
ProGolf,323y6l,SketchArtist,5,Fri Apr 10 22:22:43 2015 UTC,"Meanwhile, during this extensive Butler Cabin Crenshaw interview, Rory and Phil both birdied the 17th. Mickelson birdied all the odd holes on his last nine today, pars so far on the others. Rory chipped in from 8 yards, and Phil hit a towering approach over the trees to within 7 feet."
ProGolf,323y6l,SketchArtist,6,Fri Apr 10 22:23:17 2015 UTC,"Tiger looks much better than yesterday, a lot more GIRs... another birdie opportunity on 10."
ProGolf,323y6l,Patrick_Surtain,3,Fri Apr 10 22:49:46 2015 UTC,"I feel like he will get better each round he is out there. Maybe not a great improvement in scoring, but less stressful rounds."
ProGolf,323y6l,HAWG,4,Fri Apr 10 17:08:23 2015 UTC,"""Right down the pipe with the drive on 2. Promising start.""  If Tiger eagles the 2nd I'll shit myself."
ProGolf,323y6l,GordonMaple,4,Fri Apr 10 17:11:25 2015 UTC,"5 stroke lead for Speith...  No offense to him, but it'd be nice to see him move backward to make things interesting.  Of course, with almost 50 holes left, he could still end up over par by the end of Sunday. So we'll just have to see."
ProGolf,323y6l,Rew615,4,Fri Apr 10 14:57:39 2015 UTC,I'd prefer to see someone else play lights out and catch him than see him fall back. I want to see some power golf.
ProGolf,323y6l,Codyyblake1,3,Fri Apr 10 15:20:41 2015 UTC,"I hope Spieth gets reeled into the pack, or Saturday and Sunday will get really boring very quickly"
ProGolf,323y6l,criscros88,5,Fri Apr 10 15:26:42 2015 UTC,This Masters.com website coverage is incredible. Tons of props to the team who put that website together.
ProGolf,323y6l,GordonMaple,3,Fri Apr 10 15:22:49 2015 UTC,Speith really smashes those short putts. Has no fear of a 5 footer coming back
ProGolf,323y6l,defenestrat0r,5,Fri Apr 10 16:21:14 2015 UTC,Both Sergio and Day having poor games so far. Sergio +3 for the day
ProGolf,323y6l,criscros88,4,Fri Apr 10 16:25:55 2015 UTC,Looking like a race for 2nd place this week. Spieth's game is pure artistry right now.
ProGolf,323y6l,NordicNacho,4,Fri Apr 10 16:43:56 2015 UTC,Here comes Tiger!! (Front 9 of his 2nd round)
ProGolf,323y6l,-Lolrax-,7,Fri Apr 10 16:45:40 2015 UTC,whistles 350yd bomb. that's like a reddit avg. drive tho.. golf claps

ProGolf,323y6l,grc1435,4,Fri Apr 10 16:50:21 2015 UTC,Hah... Spieth nearly holed his chip from off the green. Unreal.
ProGolf,323y6l,nycgarbage,4,Fri Apr 10 16:52:55 2015 UTC,Another par for Tiger. Amen corner coming up.
ProGolf,323y6l,Knightro2011,4,Fri Apr 10 16:54:18 2015 UTC,itll be interesting to see if tiger has a shot at the green from where his tee shot landed
ProGolf,323y6l,Jakesrevenge16,5,Fri Apr 10 17:13:26 2015 UTC,May not be the worst spot to be for Tiger. If he has a clear line he he has a good angle.
ProGolf,323y6l,HAWG,4,Fri Apr 10 17:23:00 2015 UTC,Spieth now or forever hold your peace! Birdie for lucky -13 on 13.
ProGolf,323y6l,SketchArtist,5,Fri Apr 10 17:23:32 2015 UTC,"Want to see tiger end up at -4 to -6 so he ends up in final 2 pairings, maybe*. Get that TV time Saturday"
ProGolf,323y6l,gth829c,3,Fri Apr 10 17:29:06 2015 UTC,Id probably cry tears of joy if he and speith were paired together when i head out there Sunday.
ProGolf,323y6l,HAWG,3,Fri Apr 10 17:40:58 2015 UTC,"Would have to get to at least -6 to get in the final pairing, Els in clubhouse at -5."
ProGolf,323y6l,grc1435,4,Fri Apr 10 17:41:53 2015 UTC,"Looks like that's might be it for Fowler, +5 going into the 12th. :(    I imagine he messed up a few Masters pools."
ProGolf,323y6l,Zemulon,4,Fri Apr 10 17:42:17 2015 UTC,"I find myself liking Charley Hoffman more lately, now that his hair no longer looks like that of an unkempt poodle.  WARNING: this comment has nothing really to do with actual golf. (OK, fine, he birdies 12 to get within 5 shots of Spieth. Happy?)"
ProGolf,323y6l,SketchArtist,3,Fri Apr 10 17:46:44 2015 UTC,Two birdies in his last three holes and he shoots another 64. That'd be like throwing back-to-back no-hitters in the golf world.
ProGolf,323y6l,Yoshiman400,4,Fri Apr 10 18:03:24 2015 UTC,Rory bogies 1
ProGolf,323y6l,FreeEdgar_2013,4,Fri Apr 10 18:15:33 2015 UTC,Did Day honestly miss a 1ft birdie on 13 like tracker said? Oh my.
ProGolf,323y6l,chief27,4,Fri Apr 10 18:15:34 2015 UTC,I wonder how many people are streaming the masters this year.
ProGolf,323y6l,reddogwpb,4,Fri Apr 10 18:16:58 2015 UTC,"Meanwhile, on the Golf Channel, John Feinstein just compared Jordan Spieth to being very much like... John McEnroe.  Yeah. I got nuthin'."
ProGolf,323y6l,SketchArtist,4,Fri Apr 10 18:17:30 2015 UTC,Goal from here for tiger is to leave a 6' birdie putt coming back up the hill
ProGolf,323y6l,gth829c,4,Fri Apr 10 18:28:22 2015 UTC,What are you doing Day....?!!?
ProGolf,323y6l,nycgarbage,4,Fri Apr 10 18:37:35 2015 UTC,Charley Hoffman birdies 14 and gets back to within 4 of Jordan Spieth
ProGolf,323y6l,Bacon-Stripz,4,Fri Apr 10 18:37:37 2015 UTC,"Absolutely incredible 2 days from Jordan, tournament is far from over but god damn is this amazing to watch a 21 year old play like this at the Masters"

ProGolf,323y6l,rezznor,3,Fri Apr 10 19:14:41 2015 UTC,Two eagles for Gretzkys son in law
ProGolf,323y6l,NordicNacho,4,Fri Apr 10 19:15:17 2015 UTC,"Anyone mention Kevin Na here yet today? He's looking pretty Spieth-y out there, 6 under on today's round thru 13."
ProGolf,323y6l,SketchArtist,4,Fri Apr 10 19:16:38 2015 UTC,I just love the way Rory swings. Absolutely perfect looking.
ProGolf,323y6l,mreatsum,5,Fri Apr 10 19:36:25 2015 UTC,This is so annoying. Spieth makes history and Tiger starting to look good. Except we see none of it on TV. Instead we get Rory and company being not on their games.
ProGolf,323y6l,sexibilia,3,Fri Apr 10 19:57:50 2015 UTC,"Call me weird, but I like watching tour players struggle a little bit.  It makes me feel a little better about how terrible I am.  I think the emotion is a little better when the birdies aren't as plentiful"
ProGolf,323y6l,Zemulon,4,Fri Apr 10 20:20:19 2015 UTC,"Rory seems to be in deer-in-headlights mode at this point.   On the positive front, though, Morgan Hoffman's pants today are nothing short of spectacular."
ProGolf,323y6l,SketchArtist,5,Fri Apr 10 20:35:03 2015 UTC,Am I the only one who really just does not like Rory? I don't know what it is but I've just never liked him.
ProGolf,323y6l,titleist2015,3,Fri Apr 10 20:33:00 2015 UTC,"Rory just told the cut line to GTFO, with a 2nd shot at 13 to within 3 feet for eagle."

ProGolf,323y6l,Bizaxta,4,Fri Apr 10 21:43:53 2015 UTC,The reception Ben Crenshaw is getting this whole tournament is awesome.

ProGolf,323y6l,boycot34,3,Fri Apr 10 17:25:24 2015 UTC,Ughhhh misses his birdie... par for tiger at 3 (most likely)
ProGolf,323y6l,Patrick_Surtain,3,Fri Apr 10 17:30:56 2015 UTC,"Don't think the scores will be nearly as low. Lowest today may be 2 under. Between the pin positions and the speed of the greens, red numbers are going to be tough to come by"

ProGolf,323y6l,Death_By_Snu_Snoo,3,Fri Apr 10 12:51:38 2015 UTC,Amen Corner should be going live in a few minutes. First group should be finishing up 10 any minute.
ProGolf,323y6l,HAWG,3,Fri Apr 10 13:02:19 2015 UTC,Anyone want to take a guess at what the cut line will be?
ProGolf,323y6l,Patrick_Surtain,3,Fri Apr 10 14:07:47 2015 UTC,Currently its at +1. I expect it to stay there.  Edit: it's moved to +2. Still think it will be at +1
ProGolf,323y6l,Knightro2011,3,Fri Apr 10 14:26:49 2015 UTC,"Have a friendly wager with a friend going where he picked Spieth seconds before I was going to pick him. Still, Rory definitely isnt a bad second choice I still have faith in him."
ProGolf,323y6l,jseledyn,3,Fri Apr 10 14:31:54 2015 UTC,Birdie for Tiger at 1
ProGolf,323y6l,Patrick_Surtain,3,Fri Apr 10 14:44:41 2015 UTC,"If he drops an eagle on 2, the field better watch out."
ProGolf,323y6l,mreatsum,3,Fri Apr 10 14:47:58 2015 UTC,"Based on his remaining distance to the pin, I'd say just a birdie. Don't know for sure though!"

ProGolf,323y6l,Jdog615,3,Fri Apr 10 14:48:31 2015 UTC,Anyone know how to get the shot tracker to work on mobile? Or am I just SOL because my screen is too narrow?
ProGolf,323y6l,Killgore-Trout,3,Fri Apr 10 14:55:47 2015 UTC,"Looks like 3 wood on 2. 2nd is so far downhill he still might reach. Cupcake pin placement today, too."
ProGolf,323y6l,gth829c,3,Fri Apr 10 14:50:49 2015 UTC,Spieth -1 thru first 3. He's been the best player on the planet for the better part of a month if he can go sub 70 today he could run away with it
ProGolf,323y6l,NordicNacho,3,Fri Apr 10 14:55:40 2015 UTC,Stupid tracker website. Said he made the putt. Not so. :(  Par on #2.
ProGolf,323y6l,milacekraise,3,Fri Apr 10 14:56:18 2015 UTC,DARN YOU TRACKER FOR MAKING ME REALLY EXCITED FOR NOTHING.
ProGolf,323y6l,Rew615,3,Fri Apr 10 15:10:38 2015 UTC,"For everyone thinking he made the put, he didn't unfortunately. Tracker on Masters.com messed it up. Two putt for par unfortunately."

ProGolf,323y6l,criscros88,3,Fri Apr 10 16:18:50 2015 UTC,unless the tracker is wrong again it looks like tiger made the birdie putt and spieth missed his

ProGolf,323y6l,Knightro2011,3,Fri Apr 10 17:07:42 2015 UTC,Chip by Spieth there was awesome. It's not fair how good he has been the last two days

ProGolf,323y6l,grc1435,7,Fri Apr 10 17:25:51 2015 UTC,He's such a conformist.
ProGolf,323y6l,SketchArtist,3,Fri Apr 10 17:29:03 2015 UTC,I think if you told Tiger that he would be -2 for the tournament heading to 13 this morning he would've certainly taken it.
ProGolf,323y6l,grc1435,3,Fri Apr 10 17:41:49 2015 UTC,Par for Spieth. What a scrub.

ProGolf,32426q,Knightro2011,1 point,Fri Apr 10 12:19:42 2015 UTC,These look terrible. I see a lot of missed greens and three putts.
ProGolf,32426q,Codyyblake1,1 point,Fri Apr 10 13:11:57 2015 UTC,Definitely going to be a low scoring day. Edit: Apparently Spieth doesn't give a fuck about difficult pin positions.

You saying he blows is just as delusional as someone who would say he's the best in the world right now (which no one is). 13th place in a major is hardly bad. Hell the last year he played the season he got 4th, 32nd, 6th, and 40th in the majors and won 5 tournaments. That's a career year for most players. I wouldn't bet on him doing that this year but even a big step down from that is a long way from him blowing now."

But then I thought back to my trip their two years ago for the Tuesday practice round, and I remembered being in awe of how...perfect everything was. These people at Augusta are like John Hammond when it comes to that club this week.  It's no surprise they've ponied up the dough to have some serious technology to show the place off to the world."
ProGolf,320xkp,caskar,2,Fri Apr 10 01:51:29 2015 UTC,"I am enjoying the Masters website very, very much. And, I am also enjoying the Masters app enormously. The video quality on both the website and the app is very good, and even on my small iPhone screen I can see a ball land in the fairway clearly. All day today there were four different viewing options... two different featured groups, Amen Corner, and the 15th & 16th holes (and on my laptop I had all four open at the same time.)  Another highlight of the website I found is at the ""Leader Board"" tab, you can click on the name of any player and then at the player's page click on the ""NEWS FEED"" tab at that player's page and there are shot-by-shot videos for that player on all of the holes he birdied that day (as well as videos from his play in previous years.) It's a terrific feature, and what I am enjoying most about it is that it gives you a very clear sense of the layout of the holes on the front nine which have always been something of a mystery to me as they are rarely televised."

If you're paying out of pocket for the Golf channel then ""losing AD revenue"" shouldn't really come into your consideration. Watching golf on a beautiful large screen television in high definition is arguably the best way to view any sport bar being at the actual venue.

I'd say he's certainly on par with them in career accomplishments. I just figured where Jack, Gary and Arnie were all playing against one another in their primes, so were Tiger and Phil. Not so much Faldo. For me a third guy would be someone more like Els but the damn bastard never won a Master's.   Maybe Vijay? But he only won one green jacket"

ProGolf,31v5il,mstrymxer,-4,Wed Apr 8 15:27:12 2015 UTC,he's playing in the Pro Am
ProGolf,31v5il,JackJ94,7,Wed Apr 8 15:44:57 2015 UTC,Caddying. So he will be wearing an augusta bib which means no one will see his shorts yet redditors will still get to throw a tantrum. Everyone wins!
ProGolf,31v5il,BenyLava,2,Wed Apr 8 18:16:44 2015 UTC,*caddying... but i am feeling the same way as you
ProGolf,31v5il,zebozebo,1 point,Wed Apr 8 15:46:42 2015 UTC,The masters doesn't hold a pro am. They have the Par 3 contest but he's caddying for McIlroy during it and will be required to wear the normal caddie white jumper.

ProGolf,31v17x,localadmin,4,Wed Apr 8 14:47:07 2015 UTC,My only complaint is that it feels like they show 1 minute worth of actual practice coverage for every 5 minutes of those 3 guys and their commentary
ProGolf,31v17x,Twoto2,5,Wed Apr 8 14:53:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's actually very true. I quite like the player interviews that they manage to get though. The one with Jimenez yesterday was great. Also, am I the only one that has only just found out about Jason Duffner's weight loss? When I saw him on the range earlier I genuinely didn't recognise him!"
ProGolf,31v17x,localadmin,4,Wed Apr 8 15:01:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah Dufner's looking good - must have taken the post-divorce ""lawyer up/delete facebook/hit the gym"" advice"
ProGolf,31v17x,Twoto2,5,Wed Apr 8 15:06:46 2015 UTC,I liked it better back in 2005 when masters.com just had a couple videos streaming the range uninterrupted all day.  It was cutting edge technology and it was glorious.  Though it is very nice that they show the actual tournament online now.  I usually watch it online until Saturday.
ProGolf,31v17x,william_fontaine,3,Wed Apr 8 22:40:39 2015 UTC,Agreed. I would much prefer to watch pros just hitting balls or practicing on the putting green with the commentary dubbed over.

ProGolf,31v17x,localadmin,7,Wed Apr 8 16:51:40 2015 UTC,Billy Payne just said they're working on expanding live streaming coverage...bout f'ing time!

ProGolf,31v17x,Golftalker,4,Wed Apr 8 17:07:19 2015 UTC,"Im not sure of the specifics, but I know if you win a major you are invited back as an Honorary invitee, which means you can play the par 3, practice and just hangout. Maybe there is something like this for Ams"

ProGolf,31xlll,Twoto2,3,Wed Apr 8 23:12:08 2015 UTC,"Year in year out without fail they always suck at lining up the featured groups. Yes, let's show Tiger's group for Thursday 2 hours after he's already teed off and at 4 o'clock, when, his every shot will already be shown on ESPN. Same with Phil/Rory. Because of this decision, we won't see Tiger's first 10 holes on Friday nor will we see Phil/Rory's first 10 on Thursday.   They should have set it up so Phil/Rory was featured early Thursday and Tiger was featured early Friday. As it is now, we won't see any additional coverage of those groups online as all of their shots will be shown on ESPN as it is anyway.   What we will see is probably ~14 holes from Tiger (5-18) on Thursday and on Friday only holes 11-13 and 15/16. Flip that for Phil/Rory. So maybe 19 out of 36 holes will be shown. Imagine if the World Series only showed games starting in the 4th inning until game 4, or if the NCAA decided to show the Final Four games starting with 2 minutes left in the first half. Golf coverage is so lackluster as it is - usually the majors make up for it (and have lately with great online coverage of the U.S. Open & PGA Championship), but it's a let-down to barely see 50% of the holes for the greats on Thursday/Friday."

It was David Eger.  I doubt you know who he is though.    Why was Tiger seeing Galea then?  Tiger has more $ than God and access to a jet that would get him to the most hospitals in the world within 2 hours.  Why use a scumbag like Galea?

He asked the guy to move and he did but I guess Bubba could still see the shadow and reacted in a similar fashion to what's shown in the videos. The crowd was loving it but I personally thought he sounded like a little bitch. Anyway, he hit a perfect shot just like all the clips above and that ability to hit great shots when he's all fired up is probably why he is two green jackets."
ProGolf,31mtab,banders928,5,Tue Apr 7 14:47:16 2015 UTC,It didn't say he was the least popular. It just said he was the least likely person you would help in a fight. That could easily mean they think he could handle himself etc
ProGolf,31mtab,emeka_50,-1,Mon Apr 6 21:52:56 2015 UTC,That's even worse!
ProGolf,31mtab,whitecompass,2,Mon Apr 6 22:30:53 2015 UTC,lol how so?
ProGolf,31mtab,salty_jay,7,Tue Apr 7 10:57:54 2015 UTC,That must seriously suck to know.  I guess if you were that douchey you wouldn't care hey
ProGolf,31mtab,Polarcatman,2,Mon Apr 6 15:44:53 2015 UTC,That doesn't come as a shock that Bubba Watson isn't well liked.

ProGolf,31mt1u,TheChicagoOutfit,3,Mon Apr 6 15:32:35 2015 UTC,I paid $7 all day at the Shell this past weekend.  $4 would be a treat.

ProGolf,31khfs,godsmith2,5,Sun Apr 5 23:24:16 2015 UTC,"Spieth would have been ranked #2 in the world if he won, I think it meant more to him then it seemed when he lost. Wagner won that tournament in 2008 to take him to The Masters and he didn't make it to the weekend. JB Holmes has been sneakily good this year with a handful of top tens, watch for him to be in serious contention at a major this year."
ProGolf,31khfs,Billingsworth12,3,Sun Apr 5 23:43:52 2015 UTC,"I sure hope Speith's dismal bunker shot on the playoff hole wasn't because of a camera, that's gotta be an entirely different type of disappointing for him."
ProGolf,31khfs,BroImTheShit,1 point,Mon Apr 6 00:34:33 2015 UTC,"He seemed to think it was the reason right after it happened. That was such a bad shot that it almost had to be. I know the pressure was huge and he was coming off of a bad shot, but he pulled the hell out of that. I couldn't believe it when I was watching. Whoever took that picture needs to be punched in the gut."
ProGolf,31khfs,Pappy091,1 point,Mon Apr 6 16:04:55 2015 UTC,I wouldn't even say he has been sneakily good. He has been at the top of the board as consistently as anyone this season.

Dubuisson is an interesting outsider. He'd have won last week were it not for one shockingly bad round that came from nowhere (78). Not a lot wrong otherwise. Can't see Rory winning"

ProGolf,31cdn5,polyology,-2,Sat Apr 4 12:05:39 2015 UTC,People related to him because of his skin color even though he never identified with them.  You're correct though.  Tiger is a shell of a person.

He blocks his tee shot into the woods and tries to play a heroic recovery but comes up short.  Now he's faced with a gentle pitch from a downhill lie over Rae's Creek.  There's no bump and run option.  He lays the sod over the first pitch and drops it into the creek.  Now he's hitting 5.  He's scared to hit anything with finesse so he plays it long but blades it a bit leaving a downhill, down grain pitch back towards the water.    As Tiger taps in for his 10, and goes to +10, don't you think his glutes might forget to fire again?    I promise you that if things go south for Tiger he won't know how to stop it and will WD."

ProGolf,30yzv9,thekingofcatsandrats,-6,Wed Apr 1 02:43:49 2015 UTC,Rory is the most talented player of all time.
ProGolf,30yzv9,OD_trice,8,Wed Apr 1 00:36:25 2015 UTC,Tiger comes to mind.
ProGolf,30yzv9,thekingofcatsandrats,-9,Wed Apr 1 01:14:24 2015 UTC,"Not talent wise.  Tiger's success was a combination of incredible talent, insane work ethic, a tremendous ""sense of the moment,"" and an unmatched intensity.  Look at Rory when he first came up.  It was pure, unbridled talent like no one else.  He also told Tiger he'd kick his ass when he was 9 years old and well, he's completely destroyed Tiger since he's been on tour."
ProGolf,30yzv9,OD_trice,6,Wed Apr 1 01:16:54 2015 UTC,Tiger is the most talented golfer I've ever seen. Literally a prodigy.
ProGolf,30yzv9,thekingofcatsandrats,-3,Wed Apr 1 02:20:28 2015 UTC,"Oh absolutely but Rory has completely dominated Tiger since coming on tour.  It's been about the most lopsided ""rivalry"" in golf history."
ProGolf,30yzv9,OD_trice,7,Wed Apr 1 02:22:33 2015 UTC,He won his first major when Tiger was 35+. Put Rory in the early 2000s when Tiger was dominant and Tiger would have done to him what he did to everyone else.
ProGolf,30yzv9,thekingofcatsandrats,-2,Wed Apr 1 02:27:27 2015 UTC,"Major winners (other than McIlroy) and age since Rory won at Congressional:  2011:  Clarke (43), Bradley (25)   2012:  Watson (32), Rose (31), Els (42)  2013:  Scott (32), Simpson (27), Mickelson (43), Dufner (36)  2014:  Watson (34), Kaymer (29)  That sure looks like it's easier to win in your mid-late 30s and 40s than your early 20s."
ProGolf,30yzv9,OD_trice,2,Wed Apr 1 02:39:55 2015 UTC,Not for Tiger. Early to late 20s were the most dominant stretch golf has ever seen.

ProGolf,30zq2g,robokitty771,3,Wed Apr 1 01:33:59 2015 UTC,"Some ""inside"" source(s) leaked to Rosaforte that Tiger shot a 66 playing worst ball (you play two balls then pick the worse and continue thusly).  Rosaforte likened it to a 62 in regular play.  I'd say it's more like a 59.   At the Medalist after an 82 in Phoenix and a gluteal deactivation at Torrey..."
ProGolf,30zq2g,thekingofcatsandrats,1 point,Wed Apr 1 01:37:00 2015 UTC,"Haha love Tiger but fat chance. Par 72, 6 under thats at least 12 birdies."
ProGolf,30zq2g,robokitty771,1 point,Wed Apr 1 01:46:26 2015 UTC,"It's actually way, way, way harder.  So you hit two tee shots then you pick the worse one.  Then you hit two approach shots then you hit the worse one.  Then you hit two putts (or chips) then you pick the worse one.  So if you make a 10 footer on the first putt, it doesn't matter because you have to do it again.  Crush a 350 yard drive down the middle?  Better be able to do it twice.    Edited to add:  If Tiger did this, and I'm no fan of his, I will admit he's the greatest, most talented ever.  A 66 in the format is the greatest round ever bar none.  If that's true he should win by 20+.  It could rain for the next week and he'd still torch Rory."
ProGolf,30zq2g,thekingofcatsandrats,1 point,Wed Apr 1 01:51:14 2015 UTC,You have valid points here. Playing worst ball is FAR more difficult no matter how many you play. (4 is the best) To shoot a 66 on that is simply incredible and probably not even close to the truth. Imagine making EVERY 15 footer for birdie TWICE. EVERY par save TWICE. I simply don't believe that nonsense and Tim should be ashamed of promoting this.
ProGolf,30zq2g,thegodofkhan,1 point,Wed Apr 1 01:57:53 2015 UTC,"Yea, the more I think about it, it's not like a 62 or a 59 it's even better.  It's off the charts.  It can't even be described.    Think about it this way:  I imagine Rory's average at the Medalist is above a 66 (probably 67-68) and he's by far the best player in the world.  To think that Tiger could somehow beat him playing worse ball is laughable."
ProGolf,30zq2g,thekingofcatsandrats,2,Wed Apr 1 02:02:48 2015 UTC,I think Tim's source was the same guy who leaked the story about Kim Jong-il having 18 holes in one the first time he ever played golf.

ProGolf,306gah,lafferty__daniel,16,Tue Mar 24 21:29:11 2015 UTC,"When people say that, they aren't talking about attracting golf aficionados. They are talking about what draws in casual fans.. And more casual fans benefits all players, the tour, and even die hard fans.   Superstars are the key to drawing more fans. People like you and I will watch regardless."
ProGolf,306gah,hsmith711,1 point,Tue Mar 24 22:28:21 2015 UTC,"Exactly right. It's the difference between being a fan of the game, or a fan of the franchise players who play it."
ProGolf,306gah,Shine_On_Your_Chevy,1 point,Wed Mar 25 10:32:10 2015 UTC,"I disagree. I think the problem is in the TV coverage. TV knew how to cover a superstar, a minority super-star, whose dad groomed him to ""break the sport"", who showed his emotion at every turn. They knew how to tell that story. And people wanted to hear that story.  Even if Rory starts to pull the same win streaks Tiger did, he'll never pull the same audience if the story is just about the game of golf. Because casual fans, like you said, aren't super interested in the actual playing of golf. Rory doesn't have an interesting story. Just another really good white guy who is going to say all the same cliches at the camera as everyone else. And TV can't sell that story to casual fans. And TV doesn't know what story to make him into that will be sold.  I would make an analogy to hockey -- the face of the game right now is Sidney Crosby. They have gone so far to make rule changes to the game that, arguably, were designed to help Crosby (and players like him) post better offensive stats. They don't know yet how to try and sell the story of Crosby or of hockey. But they're trying a lot of things. And it is pretty transparent to see it when you step back. Golf AFAIK isn't trying much of anything. The networks knew how to sell Tiger with promos and commercials, while the actual coverage is the same formula we see today (just with the different anchors/play-by-play/color commentary folks)."
ProGolf,306gah,jobelenus,1 point,Mon Mar 30 02:29:20 2015 UTC,"Definitely. I remember reading a quote in that book by Feinstein, ""A Good Walk Spoiled."" Something strange about golf in relation to other sports like basketball is that we want to see our heroes win. It's ok if some nobody leads Thursday-Friday, but come Sunday, we want our favorite star to take it down and make his legacy.  Not to mention it was so special back when Tiger was great, because we all expected him to go the distance and become the GOAT. I remember thinking to myself, I'm so lucky, I get to sit here and watch the greatest play. Well, not quite looking like he'll make it now. I think that's part of what brought the extra crowds in as well."
ProGolf,306gah,AaronRodgersMustache,7,Mon Mar 30 17:43:05 2015 UTC,"""Now if we could only improve the TV coverage""  You mean to tell me you don't like watching tiger change his shoes and load his clubs into the car for 20 straight minutes?"
ProGolf,306gah,PeteG1986,8,Tue Mar 24 21:42:08 2015 UTC,"Between those, the awkward zoom-in-on-one-guy's-face, Jonny Miller's arrogant criticism of guys near the top of leaderboards on the PGA tour, Peter Kostis' non-sensical advice, the refusal to show the majority of the field down the stretch on sundays, the Jim Nantz shout-outs to the 'member of the broadcast team' back home because his relative has the sniffles, Gary McCord's awkwardly unfunny attempts at humor... it's rough.

ProGolf,306gah,PeteG1986,2,Wed Mar 25 00:44:14 2015 UTC,"Your point? Because he made a lot of people a lot of money his withdrawal should take up coverage time instead of focusing on the leaders or the rest of the field?  And yes, I'm a huge tiger fan. But the coverage was absolute shit for the Phoenix Open and the Farmers. Instead of focusing on good golf they spent the majority of the time watching tiger shoot above par and then load his clubs into the car. They didn't take the cameras off of him until that Porsche was out of the parking lot. Coverage was a joke"
ProGolf,306gah,Codyyblake1,1 point,Wed Mar 25 17:33:07 2015 UTC,"I thought you were talking about him being in a lot of commercials, because a lot of golf commercials are big name players doing the things you listed."
ProGolf,306gah,werenotabankjerry,8,Wed Mar 25 17:42:32 2015 UTC,"It doesn't need a dominant force, it needs players in the top 20 with charisma and personality, which would require them to say something more exciting than ""I played pretty well today, missed a couple chances for birdie on the back nine but overall, I feel pretty good heading into the weekend."""
ProGolf,306gah,AaronRodgersMustache,2,Wed Mar 25 00:51:50 2015 UTC,"I also agree. The gentleman aspect of the sport.. kind of blands down the players. It's possible to be a gentleman and talk a bit of light hearted trash, a little bit of fire on the course, some personality/joking. Just don't do what Sabbatini did.   We're so starved for anyone different on the tour.. honestly I think those Golf boys videos are cringey to me, but we all eat it up because its something. It's different. The modern players have to... make their own brand, in a way (I don't mean literally, but they used to). Everyone these days is just known as being with a brand, oh that guys with Nike, oh he's the face of Mizuno, Titleist... Norman was the Shark, Nicklaus the Bear, Tiger's Tiger, Seve was the creative genius etc, etc.. it seems like all the players these days are just the same people, different swings, varying amounts of success."
ProGolf,306gah,_excuseme,6,Mon Mar 30 17:51:02 2015 UTC,I want protracer on every hole or at least available for replays on every hole. I'm tired of seeing guy hit a drive into a completely over exposed sky.
ProGolf,306gah,txtx,2,Wed Mar 25 04:05:34 2015 UTC,I think Protracer has the potential to draw the casual fan. As loyal fans we can read a guy's expression and finish to infer an outcome but the video game like feature is an attraction. Hard to do for non-tee shots though and I'm sure there is a cost associated with increased usage.
ProGolf,306gah,_excuseme,1 point,Wed Mar 25 04:56:48 2015 UTC,"I dvr just about every tournament so I can skip commercials and see the rounds I miss while at work, so I don't think I'd count as a casual fan.   But I don't understand why it isn't at least available on most holes (and you're right, I only care about it on tee shots) - I get that there are probably layout issues if a tee backs up to a green (the same as the holes where you end shooting back down the fairway towards the teeshot) and I think it's interesting to see the movement on guys shots.   But my real complaint is when they don't use it, but still force us to watch someone starting at an over exposed sky to see a ball that disappeared the instant it was hit.  I'd also just like to see MORE golf shots, they have cameras on all the holes and to see someone line up a putt for ages annoys me when I could be watching other approach shots or drives.    Another improvement would be to let us hear the caddie conversations more, if you're going to make me watch a conversation between to people for a few minutes, it would be great to hear what they are saying."
ProGolf,306gah,dfish5280,8,Wed Mar 25 14:02:42 2015 UTC,"the ""golf community"" isn't starved for a dominant force. The media is. unfortunately, we aren't the people espn and golf channel want to tune in every week, mainly because we're going to anyway. they want the ""next tiger"" to draw casual fans to the tv the way they did from basically 2000-2010."
ProGolf,306gah,what-the-what-what,3,Wed Mar 25 01:01:37 2015 UTC,ESPN is a joke when it comes to golf.  I wish Renton Laidlaw and David Feherty would do every single golf broadcast.

ProGolf,306gah,HAWG,1 point,Wed Mar 25 14:05:34 2015 UTC,"I dont think it needs a new star. It just needs the stars we have now to become more consistant. All of the big name guys now are hit or miss week to week it feels like. One week they are in contention the next they have faded away. We go weeks without any of them being a factor. Usually we get one of them in contention on Sunday, but we need 2-3 of them battling it out week to week. Doesnt have to be the same ones everyweek."

ProGolf,306a09,c-fox,2,Wed Mar 25 01:43:18 2015 UTC,Exactly.  So my point was 50/1 is generous.  I'd put him at 300/1.  His mental game (most important) is in shambles.
ProGolf,306a09,what-the-what-what,2,Wed Mar 25 13:29:54 2015 UTC,"I misunderstood you, however bookmakers set odds depending on how much money is wagered, or how much they think will be wagered.  They ""balance the book"".  Tiger will always attract a lot of money, and even though his realistic chances are probably less than other 100/1 players, they have to lower the odds because of the risk to ""the book"" should he win."

Spieth, Reed, McIlroy, Koepka, Horschel, Fowler, Bradley, Dufner, (a bunch of others I'm forgetting). Follow some of these guys for a while and you'll probably naturally find yourself pulling for a couple of them.   And yeah, keep cheering for Sticker. He's awesome and doesn't play much, so its nice to see him in action."

I listen to pga xm radio on the way to work and check out the golf channel on occasion when I get home.   The biggest impression you'll get is in person. Try and go to a tour event and just check it out. Walk around, watch them on the range, get an autograph. Seeing them and interacting in person is a good recipe for  genuine fandom."

I've always loved the way Bubba Watson plays the game, and Adam Scott has one of the most beautiful swings in golf. The more you watch and the more familiar you become with each golfer's style, you'll naturally gravitate towards certain players. Outside of that, its always fun to watch young guns like Spieth or Reed as they become more and more established on Tour."

When the NFL shows the divisional standings in Week 4, that is basically the same thing as the FedEx Cup standings. Just a ranking of how people have done throughout the year so far. Why are you so agitated that they keep showing it?"

ProGolf,2ywlor,Beaninton,6,Sat Mar 14 01:24:49 2015 UTC,This does not affect my opinion of him at all. I did way too many stupid things in college to even consider trying to judge someone for something they did during those years.

ProGolf,2ywlor,IKnowSoftware,1 point,Sat Mar 14 01:52:45 2015 UTC,"I get the feeling he was a cocky guy, but that doesn't mean he intentionally shaved strokes. Why would he? He was by far the best guy on the team.  I think what played out was just a combination of a very arrogant guy who was also the best player on the team. So that's likely why the other players didn't like him. Nothing I've seen is any proof that he intentionally shaved strokes. The article said they kept score in their heads, maybe he was just really bad at it."
ProGolf,2ywlor,Six_Pound_Burrito,2,Sat Mar 14 01:22:43 2015 UTC,"It's just weird, the guy is an oddball. His wife had his parents kicked out of a tournament because they had a falling out, maybe because of his hijinks in college."

ProGolf,2ywlor,GnarlyBear,1 point,Fri Mar 13 18:36:57 2015 UTC,"Well he said it was a mistake, he just said he didn't shave strokes intentionally; which are two very different things.

That's my feeling on this. This wasn't a sanctioned event. It was practice. He then went out and went 6-0 in match play. Sounds like his teammates felt threatened by how good he was.    The anonymous source and the rest of the team are a bunch of cowards. If you see someone shaving strokes and it upsets you that much, then call him out."
ProGolf,2ywlor,JackJ94,3,Fri Mar 13 19:26:31 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. Reed is clearly an asshole and doesn't fit into golf's (especially college golf, especially in the South) good ol' boys club.

ProGolf,2ywlor,warriorsbro,-3,Fri Mar 13 18:26:08 2015 UTC,"What America doesnt need is Phil Mickelson thinking he knows whats best for the PGA tour. All he is doing is alienating potential PGA sponsors by saying ""not everyone can be included"" when referencing fall series events not getting Ryder Cup points. All he is doing is trying to make it easier for him to get points even when hes not playing well. Ill take ten Patrick Reeds in the Ryder Cup over Phil Mickelson any time."
ProGolf,2ywlor,eyates618,-2,Fri Mar 13 19:11:11 2015 UTC,Would love to know what the fuck you're smoking. Golf is a game of honesty and integrity. Reed ruined his reputation completely throughout college. To be kicked out of one school and almost out of the second is in itself crazy. Yea he's a good player but I don't want a cheater representing the US in any ryder cup events. And to take Him over Phil might be the dumbest thing I've heard in this sub.
ProGolf,2ywlor,warriorsbro,2,Fri Mar 13 19:25:40 2015 UTC,When I say id take him im referencing ryder cup and presidents cup... not to like hang out with. Sure he ruined his reputation but hes not cheating in the pro ranks and if he does he will be outted and fast. So im willing to bet hes not stupid enough to do it as a pro. Patrick Reed is a superior matchplay golfer than Phil Mickelson. Its just true. Whether or not hes better in a regular and major tournament fashion is yet to be seen and my comment should have reflected that originally. Sorry I wasnt more clear.

I was hanging out inside taking care of a very sweet tall dark haired lady and a little boy who seemed to be around 10 when golf channel started to run a special on Daly and all that he has accomplished.. Very randomly.. but it was awesome as I knew he was outside trying to make the cut. At that time the kid points to the TV and says ""that's my dad- I remember him telling me about that tournament."" Immediately i realized the kid looked just like him except had dark hair, and the lady's crazy pant pattern made complete sense. He missed the cut that weekend but I rooted for him ever since and was glad to see him play well recently and even recognized his caddy as that lady last week.  TL;DR met Daly's son and gf at web.com tour, didn't realize it until his son pointed Daly out on TV"

Both times I've done laser work at the Travelers when his group's come up, my station partner and I have joked around about his Loudmouths (since our keypads alert us of each golfer's wardrobe for the round).  Rickie's actually toned it down a bit the last couple of years, but when he started out, he was that guy. I'd agree with Horschel and Poulter though, they have fun clothes. I wish Anthony Kim was still around so I could remark about his belt buckles. Those were legendary when he was still on the A list."

ProGolf,2yktdy,byingling,2,Tue Mar 10 23:37:12 2015 UTC,"This isn't really the first time Rory has 'behaved badly', either. I can remember other tosses, kicks, bag slaps, and oh yeah- walking off the course during a round!   In fact, after 5 years on tour, I think Rory has had at least as many questionable moments as Tiger had in his first 5 years. He's also not only given a pass on his off-course life (broken engagement, broken contracts), but been commended for much of it. I don't know the details behind any of that, and I am not saying Rory should  necessarily be getting more grief from the media- but the double standard is obvious. He is 'the golden boy'. But I don't see his actions as golden as his image."
ProGolf,2yktdy,polyology,2,Wed Mar 11 01:55:37 2015 UTC,He's also 25 years old with cameras following him and commentators breaking down his every action. God knows my mistakes at 25 were much more egregious. I'm prepared to let him be human.

ProGolf,2yi8nh,westmontblvd,3,Tue Mar 10 00:48:18 2015 UTC,People seem to forget he has won more tournaments with a short putter than a long putter.  Like a dozen or so professional wins (EU and US) before making the switch.
ProGolf,2yi8nh,jerkinbottoms,2,Tue Mar 10 04:06:24 2015 UTC,I think its become an urban myth that he sucked at putting before the broomstick. I've talked to people about this subject and they just look at you strange when you say he was a good putter before.

ProGolf,2yi8nh,2nds1st,2,Tue Mar 10 13:31:54 2015 UTC,"I just haven't seen him putt with any competence when in contention in a major, save for the Masters he won, and I'd suggest that it's no coincidence that he made that winning putt literally in the dark."
ProGolf,2yi8nh,Shine_On_Your_Chevy,2,Tue Mar 10 20:33:00 2015 UTC,"Long putters may be beneficial for some players, but overall they never provided a statistical advantage over short putters.  Opponents like to cite specific players whose careers improved after going to a long putter, such as Ernie, Couples, Scott, etc, but if we're using specific examples you have to examine the top putters on tour, who are virtually all using short putters.  Besides, the same career improvements could be seen for guys going to fat-grips, or different brands, or different styles such as a blade to a mallet. I think in the end its little more than a placebo effect.  Regardless of all that I'm glad to see them go. They look goofy, the anchor-point is against the spirit of the rules, and the constant cries of them being an unfair advantage are annoying. I'm glad to see this chapter closed."
ProGolf,2yi8nh,warriorsbro,2,Tue Mar 10 06:26:52 2015 UTC,Yeah putting is all mental and these guys just let it get in their heads. Basically ruined a few profilic players latter careers (Hogan & Sam Snead to name a few)  Funny side note I read CB MacDonald's book on vacation last week Scotland's Gift: Golf and the schenectady putter was of hot contention during the early 1900s because it wasn't heel shafted and people thought it was against the spirit of the game. This was because mallet or croquet style putters were already banned. Interesting to see how that's evolved and all the different putter head styles since.

ProGolf,2yi8nh,what-the-what-what,1 point,Tue Mar 10 22:29:15 2015 UTC,"Will be interesting to see if he goes back to the long putter once he has a couple of bad days.

ProGolf,2yi8nh,tomspotley,1 point,Tue Mar 10 01:49:59 2015 UTC,"Nah, I think Adam's overall game is too good right now.

Doral was also his first start in a few months and looked pretty good."
ProGolf,2yh4ev,josephrobles,11,Mon Mar 9 19:46:55 2015 UTC,"That's kind of the problem though. We need those dominant players to drive viewership and interest up. Sports would be more competitive and have arguably better competitions without dominant players like Tiger, Jack, Lebron, Jordan, Ronda Rousey, etc but there would definitely be lowered interest.   Superstars are fun to watch.   Hopefully someone can step up in Tiger's absence and get on a roll.  Speaking of Tiger, I know he's taken a break right now but has he said if he's going to play in the Masters or not?"
ProGolf,2yh4ev,bernie16wb,3,Mon Mar 9 20:45:12 2015 UTC,Yeah I guess for non die hard golf fans superstars are more fun to watch rather than a good 2-3 man finish. I never thought of it like that.
ProGolf,2yh4ev,bernie16wb,2,Mon Mar 9 22:10:40 2015 UTC,Yeah it's easier for casual fans to get into it when they're watching say Tiger just hitting amazing shot after amazing shot with huge galleries going nuts every time.   But I definitely agree that the tournaments when there's tight finishes that go down to the wire with multiple possible winners are fun to watch. For me at least.
ProGolf,2yh4ev,te3referee,2,Mon Mar 9 22:52:20 2015 UTC,"Yea it has a lot to do with the casual fan like in most sports. People want to be able to root for a team that wins a lot. In golf it's every man for himself. People have habits of picking ""favorites"" in sports and golf can be frustrating for a lot of casual fans when their favorite gets cut after Friday. Who do they root for then... and will they be inclined to watch their next tournament if they know it can happen again?"
ProGolf,2yh4ev,Josiah_Bartlet,2,Thu Mar 12 16:54:19 2015 UTC,"He hasn't said, but I think he will play The Masters. He said ideally he would be ready to play the Honda but that was only 2-3 weeks after his leave. Given his number one goal is to take Jack's record, I would be stunned if he doesn't play Augusta."
ProGolf,2yh4ev,HAWG,2,Tue Mar 10 04:04:34 2015 UTC,"He almost always plays so well there. It would be the perfect place for him to come back. I find it very hard to believe he isnt there, Id put money on him having visited there a few times for practice rounds already."
ProGolf,2yh4ev,Josiah_Bartlet,3,Tue Mar 10 15:27:19 2015 UTC,"Personally, I think the ""tour is no good without Tiger"" has become false and lazy. Now, let's be honest, it's better and more interesting with Tiger. It's silly to debate against that. But if you just pay a little attention, there are more stars or budding starts than ever. You have Rory, DJ's return, polarizing Patrick Reed, Bubba, up and down Phil, Spieth, Kuchar, Bubba, Adam Scott, Jason Day, Kaymer, Stenson, Furyk, Rose, Dubuisson, Walker, Horschel, Mahan, Zach, Keegan, Dufner, the comeback of Paul Casey, Strick is still around, Els hangs around.  No one who pays attention a little is surprised when any one of 25-30 guys win or are in contention. When has that been the case? Not to mention the Ryder Cup gets more attention every year (ok, two years).  Golf is in an incredible place."

ProGolf,2yh4ev,arcadium83,1 point,Tue Mar 10 05:55:36 2015 UTC,"I think golf would benefit from Tiger making 1 more good run. Tiger competing with all those guys you are naming, battling out on a consistant basis. That would pull up a few guys onto the next level of notoriety. If it doesnt happen golf will still be fine, but the tour may slip a bit when it comes to sponsor money etc."
ProGolf,2yh4ev,project-d,2,Tue Mar 10 15:40:28 2015 UTC,"I think the PGA has a strong set of players who can be considered as ""the stars"", like: Rory, Bubba, Adam Scott, Day, Furyk, etc. These are the guys who are exciting to watch week by week.  While we may not see a figure become an icon and be the marketing sensation that Tiger was for a long time, I think that the current set of stars are interesting enough to foster attention, but never to that same level as Tiger. For many, Tiger was a springboard into the sport, and I don't think there's anyone in the field (except to some degree Rory) who can produce a similar effect.  On another note, remember the Waste Management Open, and all the buzz and excitement during that tournament due to the draw of the Superbowl? I think that best showed the potential for how great a spectator sport golf can be."

ProGolf,2y8bvr,ashdrewness,1 point,Sat Mar 7 20:27:32 2015 UTC,"The tour gets tax exemptions because of all the charitable contributions they make; which is more than all other sports leagues/organizations combined. So I see no problems there.  You may feel you have an obligation to know about suspensions, but I don't & they're under no legal obligation to disclose that information. The NBA/NFL/MLB have collective bargaining agreements between the players union & the owners which states their disclosure policy. The PGA tour chooses not to disclose that info so nobody is forcing you to be a fan."

Typically if you're going to accuse someone of being in cahoots with the TOUR to hide a suspension, having a history of PED use above and beyond Lance Armstrong, and playing an illegal ball for most of your career, you better have some serious credibility --- or you're probably just a crazy dude ranting on a radio show.

I can think of many examples of normal looking guys that can drive over 300 yards with ease. Look at Bubba Watson, he's got spindly limbs and is one of the top distance drivers on tour.

When I was in high school, I was a standard bearer at the US Open (when it was at Oakmont) and got to follow Paddy in a practice round and the second round of the tournament. He was honestly the nicest pro athlete I ever met. Wanted to make conversation (even though we were supposed to stay out of the way), asked about my handicap and game, and was all around a cool dude.   Really glad to see him make it back to the top after what easily could have been the end."

ProGolf,2xothu,Avoid-The-Clap,2,Mon Mar 2 21:02:41 2015 UTC,"That's the way it works for the Wyndham, but that's the only tournament I've ever looked at volunteering for.  Another very cool job that gets you inside the ropes with a group is as a walking scorer -- these are the guys who provide the data for ShotLink and all of the PGA Tour's official stats.  The only catch -- and why I've never done it -- is that most tournaments require you to have prior experience doing it.  Usually you can get that experience at a LPGA, Web.com, or USGA championships.    Personally, I think the Standard Bearer is the way to go because you get to walk with the groups but you don't have to be fiddling with a tablet in between shots -- you can just focus on what's going on in the group and watch the best golfers in the world from right up close."

That being said, he is easily the nicest guy on Tour that I have ever met.  I first met him at the 2008 Ryder Cup in the lobby of the hotel they were staying in, and went up to him to shake his hand and say ""Good game.""  He was kind, gracious, and complimentary, even in defeat.  And during that round in 2013, he and his caddie were incredibly nice -- at one point he hit a ball into the water, and I was the last person to see a line on it.  Ended up spending about 5 minutes with Paddy, his caddie, and a rules official finding the proper spot for a drop.  After the round, we visited for several minutes, and you would have thought that I had cured cancer instead of just helping him track the flight of a ball.  Well done, Padraig!"

Barton Creek hosted a Nationwide event awhile back so I would think it would be a better venue. But I suppose we'll see. I live 10min from there so I'd definitely buy a week-long pass to the event.

ProGolf,2x8hp3,Shine_On_Your_Chevy,1 point,Fri Feb 27 02:25:04 2015 UTC,"I remember reading an article on Miller.  They said what he struggled with in his career comes out in his commentary.  ""10 footer up the hill, should be an easy putt"", means he would miss those a lot."
ProGolf,2x8hp3,Shine_On_Your_Chevy,0,Fri Feb 27 13:58:19 2015 UTC,"All of Miller's commentary consists of a constant drumbeat of insane paranoia (e.g., ""There's panic in the Furyk camp right now"" on the 16th tee while Furyk cruised to a 3-shot victory in the final round of the 2003 U.S. Open at Olympia Fields), punctuated by moments of stunning arrogance (e.g., ""I was pretty much the best wedge player in the game"" while describing himself in his mid-1970s prime). He actually claimed that he quit the pro game because his ""muscles got too big"" from chopping wood on his Utah ranch, but everybody knows he's a complete nutjob, thanks in no small part to him putting his mental illness on display on every NBC golf telecast. Good riddance.   Nicklaus has gone on record to say that Miller relentlessly talks about players choking because that's how Miller thinks himself. Nicklaus also had a nice takedown of Miller's 63 in the final round to win the 1973 U.S. Open at Oakmont, saying that Miller, being so far back at the start of the day, teed off early and took advantage of the good weather conditions. Miller, for his part, said of his own round, ""It was the greatest ball-striking round I've ever seen and I've been around a little bit."" 'Nuff said. What a shithead."
ProGolf,2x8hp3,Magnum_44,0,Fri Feb 27 14:36:54 2015 UTC,"I agree.  Miller's mind just races at a completely different level.  He talks about so much technical stuff in analyzing a players swing thoughts, mechanics, etc.  I doubt that 75% of the pro's out there are thinking that much with regards to their shot.  If they are, there is little doubt to why they would 'choke'.  I tend to think Tiger may be stuck in this mind-frame of over analyzing.  Creates a total mindfuck on the course.  The difference can be exemplified by when Nicklaus and Miller were playing a charity event.  Miller just couldn't wrap his head around a putt and analyzed the putt to a point where he just figured there's no way to do it.  Jack just mosey's on up and drains the putt for him without thinking.  Classic!! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUPPnVo0CII"
ProGolf,2x8hp3,warriorsbro,-1,Fri Feb 27 20:15:05 2015 UTC,"I'm a big fan of Miller's commentary, though not so much of Duval's. In this case I disagree with both, as I feel my full-swing definitely effects my pitches and chips (and vice-versa).  I once had an issue where I was leaning toward the ball at the top of the backswing. My head moved that direction about 3 inches, which resulted in repeated shanks. The shanks found their way into my chips and pitches as well. It was incredibly difficult to stop, but once I did in my full-swing, they disappeared from my short game. Three months of full-swings on the range with a camera and a bender stick, and literally zero short game practice; it is obvious to me that the swing and the pitch/chip goes hand-in-hand.  I also feel that golf skill correlates less with hand-eye coordination than most people think. Muscle memory and habitual movements are more important imo, and I think Tiger has 'erased' a portion of those things in an effort to once again redo his full swing.  Also, as much as people mention only chipping ""one way"", I could identify many pros by their chip and pitch motions. Yes they're more subtle, but the differences are there.  Anyway, I have no doubt that Tiger will rise again.   Lastly, fuck Golf Digest. Their ""hot list"" has become a complete joke, which I suppose fits their brand perfectly."

I'm not sure if you're aware but sites like Facebook, Twitter and Reddit are actually really good indicators of trends throughout society."
ProGolf,2x5kdf,glk3278,2,Fri Feb 27 04:43:40 2015 UTC,Think about the core demographics of social media and then think about the core demographics of golf fans. They don't really match up. Golf fans under age 40 are probably a minority.

From hitting driver off the 18th at Winged Foot, to changing equipment right before a Ryder Cup, to shooting himself out of countless tournaments. Off course he's also famous for racking up gambling debt, making bad investments, & associating himself with the wrong people (recent SEC investigation).

Lee is in the top 4 all time in points one, while having played in 8 fewer matches than Phil. So in this case, I thought Lee is well entitled to his opinions.

ProGolf,2wboae,babbleon5,5,Thu Feb 19 02:50:04 2015 UTC,I've said this same thing for years.  TW was the first player to match the new equipment with a modern ball.

It just so happens that everyone is so pumped up on this I-Hate-Tiger-For-Something-He-Did-5-Years-Ago-But-Apologized-For train that they forget about logic and just believe ""whenever he plays bad then he withdraws.""

So with him cutting ties prior to the end of their contract they were basically owed their management fee, in full. Which I am guessing is normally prorated.

ProGolf,2uo948,whubbard,1 point,Wed Feb 4 07:06:43 2015 UTC,Other leagues are governed by collective bargaining agreements. PGA players are all independent contractors. The cba's address this issue and the players all agree  to it. This case is saying that the caddies are forced to do simmering that benefits other entities without the caddies' consent or compensation.
ProGolf,2uo948,eye_patch_willy,1 point,Wed Feb 4 12:57:59 2015 UTC,"But isn't this really just a condition of employment?  For example, at Augusta you have to wear the white jumpers.

ProGolf,2uo948,Avoid-The-Clap,1 point,Thu Feb 5 01:48:19 2015 UTC,Caddies do not work for the Tour. They work for their player.
ProGolf,2uo948,eye_patch_willy,1 point,Thu Feb 5 01:49:31 2015 UTC,"True, but that's just an extension:  Tour Event says to player: Your caddie has to wear a bib if you want to have a caddie. Player says to caddie: You have to wear a bib if you want to be my caddie. Caddie wears bib.  And I don't think it's accurate to say that the caddies aren't compensated.  Where do they think the purse money comes from?  Event sponsors.  So if their player takes home some money, they get their 10%."
ProGolf,2uo948,Avoid-The-Clap,2,Thu Feb 5 01:52:30 2015 UTC,You're not wrong. The question is whether that mandate by the tour is legal or not. It's not an easy call. The toughest thing for the caddies is going to be showing how they were actually damaged and quantifying that damage. Courts don't create windfalls.

Their years are close enough to be comparable, but doing so reveals just how much better Tiger was.  edit: It also failed to mention their total wins for those seasons, Tiger (9) in 2000, and Rory (4) in 2014."
ProGolf,2uberp,warriorsbro,1 point,Sat Jan 31 22:46:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah but as the article suggests if Rory can avoid the sort of rapid and incredible derailing we saw in Woods, he could end up with more majors than Tiger, and I think he will be credibly regarded as greater than woods by many"
ProGolf,2uberp,JurgenTheNotSoGerman,2,Sun Feb 1 17:37:45 2015 UTC,"That's a lot of ""ifs"" for a guy who is only a quarter of the way to where Tiger currently sits, and that's only counting majors. What about regular wins?  Also, the context of the article is a comparison of their best individual years, not a career comparison.   Do you think Rory will have a year where he wins 3 majors, 7 starts in a row, and 9 wins overall? That is what it will take the reach the pinnacle Tiger reached (the year 2000). The cherry on-top is Tiger went on to win the first major of the next year too, making it 4 majors in a row.  I personally like Rory's character as a person more than Tiger, so I hope he'll make a contest of it. Its hard to imagine him surpassing Woods given that we've already seen Rory slump in his career before (something that didn't happen to Tiger until his mid-30's), and he's not currently matching Tiger's pace when Tiger was his age. Rory will have to get even better just to match.  Lastly, I really don't think Tiger is done winning. They said he was done before, then he came back and won 5 times in the year and zipped right back to #1. My surgeon friend says he was surprised Tiger is already playing again, and didn't think he'd be 100% until 10+ months after surgery.   Honestly I'm just glad there is somebody (Rory) to talk about like we used to talk about Tiger. The more the better."
ProGolf,2uberp,warriorsbro,3,Sun Feb 1 17:51:09 2015 UTC,"I don't think he will reach the absolute pinnacle of what Woods achieved in the short term, although it is certainly a possibility, he's currently on a streak of two majors in a row, and he won the most recent WGC. His most recent results on the European tour are 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1. He has the ability to go on that streak if everything goes perfectly.  But long-term, overall legacy wise, if he bests Woods in the major wins, he will go down for many to be greater, and I think thats fair, even if he doesn't exactly match Woods 2000 season at any point. He is currently exactly in line with where Nicklaus was in terms of major wins at his age. Sure there are lots of ifs, we wont know the answer for about 20 years. But its a strong possibility."

When Tiger first burst onto the seen, players from Azinger's generation were truly in awe of his capabilities, and were all admittedly very intimidated to compete against him.  That being said, the generation of players such as Azinger, Pavin, Leonard's, Janzen's, etc. are way behind Tiger.  Tiger used to be able to bomb the ball miles past these old guys.  The newer Tour players simply can outplay Tiger, and his 'mystique' or 'aura' does not intimidate the newer Tour generation."

It's also in ""Bloodsport"" that Tiger went to Galea 14(?) times and paid him close to $100k.  Tell me, why would a billionaire athlete get wrapped up with a dirtbag like Galea?  Galea was undereducated, under qualified and shady as all fuck.  Hell, he's not even allowed in the US now.    Tiger could see the best and brightest doctors in the world with a seconds notice.  Dr. James Andrews has an office that's less than an hour flight for Tiger's home.  Tiger could be at the Cleveland or Mayo Clinic and back within a day via his Gulfstream.  Hell, he could be at Columbia Presbyterian for a noon appointment and be at the Medalist in time for an afternoon 18.  So why Galea?    Galea was a master at disguising PEDs as other ""legitimate"" treatments.  Reputable doctors were less likely to perform these procedures on sports' biggest star.  He knew (thought) that Galea was discrete and could give him the advantage he so desperately sought.    It's also a fact that Tiger hasn't won a major since the tour started testing for PEDs.  Before an apologist says that he's won another tournaments and that proves he wasn't juicing, remember majors are MUCH different.  They're bigger (not necessarily longer), more challenging, more pressure backed and with little room for error.  They're physically and mentally taxing at a level that no other event in the world is.    I played in high school and college.  I qualified for match play at a US Am and let me tell you I was completely fucking worn out after 36 holes.  I was 22 years old and in great shape at the time but my brain was fried.  I can't even fathom a US Open or Masters.     If you choke at a major that will be with you FOREVER.  People (namely Tiger fans) still reference Rory's collapse at Augusta.  That was 4 years ago and since then he's won 4 majors.  People will forget about collapses at random events within a year.  Hell, Kaymer's recent collapse will be nothing but a light hearted ribbing by the end of the year.  But even if Rory wins 20 majors people will remember that collapse in 2011 and he won the US Open 2 months later by 8 shots!  Tiger, more than anyone on the planet, realizes that to win majors you need talent, insane focus and a bit of luck.  Tiger did everything he could to win and some of it was nefarious.   Add some beta blockers, some HGH and others then you take a super star and make him into a legend.    Imagine if you gave Rory beta blockers.  He'd have 7 majors and 20 wins."

Once the realization set in (before Canseco's disclosure), it was like....DUH??   I'm sure there are still people out there who think A-Rod and Armstrong are still clean.  Either that, or they just don't care. Because billions are thrown around by the Nike machine, doesn't mean PEDs should just be 'part' of the game.

He may never be Tiger but he's a once in a generation talent.  This kid is special.  Set your DVR or stay up late if you're in the States and watch him.  I DVRed his round yesterday.  He shot a very easy 64 with no stress and it could have been a 59.  Then he says he ""expects"" that now.  He doesn't expect it out of malice or arrogance.  He expects it because he's so good.

ProGolf,2u8ljx,DetroitBreakdown,1 point,Sat Jan 31 01:58:28 2015 UTC,It still wont stop broadcasters showing about 250 of his shots in a tournament. It's so boring - now for the par putt on 14 of that guy who's languishing in 122th place.
ProGolf,2u8ljx,NedNoodles,1 point,Sat Jan 31 02:04:06 2015 UTC,Tiger Woods at his best is very newsworthy. Tiger Woods at his worst is very newsworthy. People want to see Tiger play.
ProGolf,2u8ljx,Codyyblake1,0,Sat Jan 31 05:42:21 2015 UTC,"But why? Why the obsession? I can understand if he is at least competitive but when he's not it's exceptionally boring. He was a great player, was being the operative word."
ProGolf,2u8ljx,NedNoodles,2,Sat Jan 31 12:43:17 2015 UTC,"He was so dominant when he was on top, he showed emotion and excitement, and he's golf's first great black golfer. He is a player that's easy to get excited about."

That being said, could he not afford to hand out more than just 12? Or if only 12 why not $100 bills? He's made almost $300,000 in 3 events this 2014-2015 season, surely he can afford it..."

Because of my old pattern, I was so steep on it, that I have a new grind on my wedge and sometimes it’s hard to trust. This is a similar grind I used to use back in the early 2000s, but it’s a different grind. Some of my shots were into the grain with tight pins, and either I flop it or bump it, one of the two. I chose to bump it,"

ProGolf,2tygl0,ExactlyUnlikeTea,0,Wed Jan 28 16:26:39 2015 UTC,"It's important to note that Rory plays a much different schedule.    Tiger feasted on weak field events.  Even the Euro events Rory plays in are stacked with top 10 players.  They might not be as deep as PGA Tour events but at the look at the players in Dubai this week:  Rory (#1) Stenson (#2) Sergio (#6) Kaymer (#12) Victor D (#17) Gmac (#19).  That's pretty stout at the top.    Rory will never approach Tiger's PGA win total since he plays the deepest events on both tours.    Look at his PGA Tour schedule:  Honda (always a great field) WGCs (big time) Memorial  4 majors Quail Hollow (good field, dropped off a bit but should pick up since the PGA is coming there) Players FedEx Cup  On the Euro tour:  BMW (comparable to strong PGA event), Irish Open (weakest event) Desert Swing (comparable to midlevel PGA events) , Race to Dubai (comparable to upper/middle level events).    Rory's schedule is very tough especially given the travel.    If you guys think Rory was good in 2014 just watch this year.  The major rota is his wet dream."
ProGolf,2tygl0,myfeetsmelllike,-11,Sat Jan 31 06:27:58 2015 UTC,Tiger has dropped off after ped testing began. Rory gets tested regularly and competes against better fields. Tiger fans are desperate and scared

I think he has the right idea having a coach that is more focused on strength and mechanics rather than swing shaping per se but over the next several months I think there is going to be a LOT (and probably unfair) criticism of him if Tiger doesn't really perform...

That being said I think that if he is back to playing his best it will bring out the best in his competitors as well.

At one point Tiger was too dominant so anyone whoever drafted Tiger would basically win the thing. So they introduced the half tiger rule which basically means you get half his points, which back when he was dominating was still a lot if you look at some of his best seasons. So it started with that and it seems to have still stuck. Even though I think it should be full Tiger these guys are bent on tradition waiting for him to come out of his hibernation. 1/2 Mcilroy is something that has just been introduced this year that we are trying out."

ProGolf,2tq4sw,senor_louse,1 point,Mon Jan 26 18:10:54 2015 UTC,Oh wow that sucks for those guys.  I also like the Fults/Led team a lot.  Kuchar is the Peyton Manning of fantasy golf.
ProGolf,2tq4sw,senor_louse,2,Mon Jan 26 18:34:16 2015 UTC,Can you explain some of the rules for the competition. My friends and I love drafting and have been looking for a way to do it for golf.
ProGolf,2tq4sw,Ryder00,5,Mon Jan 26 15:24:43 2015 UTC,"Absolutely, so here is the basic payouts based on our total purse:   ""Because of the bigger pot & more teams here are the payouts for the 4 sections this year:  Per section: 1st place is now worth - $220 2nd place is now worth - $140 3rd place is now worth - $75  The overall points winner receives $200 & the 2nd overall winner gets $100  The first section will be 8 weeks with 9 tournaments The 2nd section will be 9 weeks with 9 tournaments including 2 double point majors (The Master's & the TPC) The 3rd section will be 8 weeks with 9 tournaments including 2 double point majors (The U.S Open & the British Open) The 4th section will be 9 weeks with 10 tournaments including 2 double point majors (The PGA Championship & The Tour Championship -  which is the final week - top 30 golfers)  Points are based on top 20 finishes and are like followed,   1st: 40 points 2nd: 25 points 3rd: 20 points 4th: 17 points  5th: 16 points  then goes down one point at a time until 20th place is 1 point.   Majors and a couple other big events are considered double points. Draft is snake style. There is one redraft after the 1st section where you can drop one player and pickup one player which is done by standings, last place gets first redraft choice. Other than that you are stuck with your team for the whole year.   I wanted to do something similar on /r/fantasypgagolf but couldn't figure out the logistics of everything and how we would draft and pay and so on."
ProGolf,2tq4sw,BTBishops,1 point,Mon Jan 26 15:45:15 2015 UTC,Thanks!   Might try to get something together for each of the majors. Have you ever tried to figure in things like putting fairways and driving?

He either didn't notice the damage or was sandbagging because he didn't want to miss the cut. In the former case this rule is utterly ludicrous. In the latter case it's completely opposite to the spirit of the rule and he should be DQ'd for abusing the rule, not breaking his club. In both cases he should simply have to play without a 4-iron and finish his round. In no case does this demonstrate honor or preserve the sanctity of the game."

Firstly, he genuinely thought he took a fair drop, or else he wouldn't have mentioned that he purposefully dropped a little bit ahead in his post-round interview. Secondly, the decision to not disqualify tiger was at he discretion of the rules officials.. Why the hell would tiger voluntarily disqualify himself if the officials told him to play on?!?!  He's not out there to be the white knight of golf rules, he's out there to win majors and perform well..all you tiger haters need to find something else to grill him on besides these weak sauce accusations of calling him a cheater!!"
ProGolf,2rj5vg,Sok543,3,Tue Jan 6 22:07:13 2015 UTC,"What I still am confused about is how the drop in 2013 is not legal. I thought that it can be dropped anywhere on the line no closer to the hole. Did he not maintain the line that it crossed? Also, as far as the 2005 drop goes, the rules state that a drop is appropriate if it is ""virtually known"" that the ball is in the hazard. It is definitely possible that Tiger or Stevie saw the ball disappear in the hazard. Author's word vs. Tiger's (who is not present to give his insight). If CBS releases proof, then that can strengthen author's argument. But until then, impossible to know for sure."
ProGolf,2rj5vg,beardedlemon,2,Tue Jan 6 23:53:55 2015 UTC,"Did he not maintain the line that it crossed?   No, given that it hit the flag and went off at a funny angle, he was not even close to the point that it last crossed."

ProGolf,2rj5vg,beardedlemon,2,Wed Jan 7 17:23:51 2015 UTC,"There are two different types of hazards, and Tiger hit into the one where you have to drop exactly where you hit from.  The other type is the one where you can drop backwards (anywhere on the line)."
ProGolf,2rj5vg,warriorsbro,5,Wed Jan 7 01:51:07 2015 UTC,"Former college golfer here. The options on a yellow hazard are: 1) play the ball as it lies (impossible when ball is underwater, obviously) 2) rehit from as close to where the ball last lied as possible 3) drop a ball behind the hazard keeping the place where the ball last crossed the margin of the hazard directly in line with the hole and the spot on which you drop, as far back as you want. Tiger chose 2) but used 3's procedure, an innocuous yet glaring break of the rules from the best player in the world. People around golf were bitter that he gets the special treatment that he does and think he should have disqualified himself. I'm impartial.  Edit: margin not main"

ProGolf,2rj5vg,beardedlemon,2,Wed Jan 7 02:05:07 2015 UTC,"I'm not totally sure, but I do know the option he went with was 27-1, which means he had to play as near as possible to where he originally hit from.  I remember thinking it had to do with whether the hazard was outlined in yellow vs red.   Now I'm thinking maybe his choices were limited since his ball went into the water going backwards, so he couldn't drop where it last crossed the line, because he'd be closer to the hole (on the green basically)."
ProGolf,2rj5vg,warriorsbro,2,Wed Jan 7 02:07:26 2015 UTC,Agreed. It was a mistake. Move on people.
ProGolf,2rj5vg,warriorsbro,3,Tue Jan 6 22:42:15 2015 UTC,"Nobody claims he deliberately cheated, but he did break the rules.  On-course staff knew and decided to let it go, which would have been fine until he spoke up at his post-round presser.  Then 33-7 was inappropriately applied in order to 'correct' the whole situation.   If anything, Tiger made a human mistake; Masters officials cheated."

ProGolf,2rj5vg,WalkOn30,2,Wed Jan 7 15:00:38 2015 UTC,"Had Weir stated in a presser ""I dropped a couple yards back"", he most certainly would have been caught.  Also, this concept that its unfair to be constantly on camera is only valid when someone is on camera at a time when others would not be. In this case Tiger was one of the leaders; Weir also would have been on camera.  The only difference is that 33-7 would not have been misused just to save him."
ProGolf,2rj5vg,warriorsbro,1 point,Wed Jan 7 15:51:35 2015 UTC,"I agree that anyone would have been on camera at the time and therefore he likely would have been assessed the penalty under those pretenses.  However, I believe the result would have been the same but with much less hype surrounding it.  A disqualification of a leader steals the from the drama of the event.  I agree with the ruling on that basis, especially if the drop was a honest mistake."

ProGolf,2rj5vg,tdawg422,7,Sat Jan 10 21:54:04 2015 UTC,Blogspam from someone who doesn't like Tiger Woods.  I wouldn't lend it much credence.
ProGolf,2rj5vg,beardedlemon,5,Tue Jan 6 20:33:09 2015 UTC,"This is a very bold article to write. Tiger's situation is not that similar to the other players that got DQ'd. I have always thought you can assume your ball went in the hazard even if you can't find it, or if no one saw it directly go into the hazard. In turn, you drop at the nearing point you ""thought"" the ball entered the hazard."
ProGolf,2rj5vg,beardedlemon,1 point,Tue Jan 6 19:38:18 2015 UTC,"The rules of golf say as long as it is ""virtually known"" that the ball went in, then a drop is legal. This is very possible."

ProGolf,2rbk13,BenyLava,4,Sun Jan 4 21:24:47 2015 UTC,"Spieth at #1? Seems unlikely. But Spieth, a Major champion in 2015? That seems a lot more possible (yet still bold)"
ProGolf,2rbk13,ExactlyUnlikeTea,6,Mon Jan 5 01:37:59 2015 UTC,"I don't think Phil would accept a playing-captain position at this point, given that these are likely some of his last truly competitive years on tour, and the commitment of being captain would detract from his practice & playing time. Jimenez has been voicing similar concerns.  Tiger is the safest prediction on the list, although I think he'll come around this year. 30% chance imo.  Rickie @ the Masters...hard to say. I guess he has as good a chance as anybody except maybe Bubba, Phil, or Rory. I give this one a <5% chance.  Spieth #1: nope. Sure he notched a couple silly season wins, but its nothing Jimmy Walker didn't do last year. The big dogs were at home enjoying the off-season. Imo Spieth is a FedEx threat, but #1 is rather safe. <5%  Sergio is a threat at Augusta and St.Andrews, no doubt. He missed the cut at Whistling Straits in 2010, and its hard to say how he'll do at Chambers Bay. I give this prediction a 5-10% chance, which is good for any one player."
ProGolf,2rbk13,warriorsbro,2,Mon Jan 5 00:05:22 2015 UTC,"I like these predictions. Spieth is the only American who has a chance to give Rory a run for his money in the long term. Fowler is super peaky and solid on the big stage so I can totally see him with a green jacket. Tiger won't do much and will get hurt (again). Maybe he'll win at Bay Hill or something. And the Phil thing seems obvious. Sergio I can see holing out for eagle on the 18th to win a major by happenstance. No way he sinks a big putt, it has to be something absolutely ridiculous."
ProGolf,2rbk13,whitecompass,1 point,Sun Jan 4 23:38:58 2015 UTC,"I like Rory for the Masters and Ricky to certainly win one major this year. You left out Phil winning the U.S. Open this year, I got a feeling about that one."

ProGolf,2r449w,topwaterpar,4,Fri Jan 2 17:05:01 2015 UTC,I think with what he is doing with Como... he looked way more free than he had the last few years with Sean Foley( I do enjoy Sean Foleys swing model). Tiger should find a really good short game coach thats where he is really losing shots these day IMO. I think Tiger wins a major... but if he does it will probably be at the PGA Championship just because I think it will take at least that long to work all of the rust out of his short game and fix his putting.

ProGolf,2pm3mq,hestern88,10,Thu Dec 18 03:04:24 2014 UTC,"There's a reason why bubba wins the Masters and these people win tractors. Bubbas length is predicated on accuracy, I don't think he has the wild abandon to just derail everything he has learned to be able to hit it even further."
ProGolf,2pm3mq,swervocow,5,Wed Dec 17 21:24:08 2014 UTC,I think with a longer shafted driver and a few swing tweaks he could definitely compete.
ProGolf,2pm3mq,swearstoomuch,2,Thu Dec 18 00:14:51 2014 UTC,"A lot of comments here neglect the fact that the long drive guys have two scientific advantages.  They have longer drivers (more lax restrictions on club length) which allows more angular velocity of the clubhead, and they have no need for their ball to perform around the green, so they use Top-Flite/Pinnacle type balls which go 10-15 yards further.  I think Bubba and Dustin and Rory could compete on the WLD tour, maybe not win though."
ProGolf,2pm3mq,lafferty__daniel,-1,Thu Dec 18 03:53:41 2014 UTC,I think you are 100% wrong.

ProGolf,2pm3mq,fermentednug,1 point,Thu Dec 18 17:35:48 2014 UTC,Yup  Only.  Rory cracks 125mph (faster than bubba substantially) The reason bubba can get good distance sometimes is he gets great spin numbers (1600-1700 rpm with a Ping G30 is incredible vs rory @ 2300 rpm)

I love watching him swing the club because I really don't think you could build a better swing for power. So watching him swing the club is like watching a thing of mechanical-kinetic beauty."

There were two guys out there that blew my mind with how long they were bombing it and with such crazy power.  Rory and Adam Scott.  And I walked a bunch of holes with Tiger where I was front row each shot.  Not as impressive, at that point in his career at least.  (He was much more impressive in other ways however, his presence was off the charts and intimidated the fuck out of his peers)."

ProGolf,2pcj5r,mart0747,1 point,Mon Dec 22 20:40:08 2014 UTC,"10 years ago it was Tiger. I loved watching someone dominate the pudgy pleated khaki club.   Now it's Rory. The golf world has changed a lot in the past 10 years, in large part due to Tiger's influence. Rory is starting to dominate in a similar way and it's great to watch.   Having a dominating player or two makes the major season more dramatic, in my opinion. It's cool to see the same guy on the leaderboard. There's more drama in watching Rory vs. Everyone else or Tiger vs. everyone else, or (I hope!!!) Rory vs. Tiger, than some person I vaguely remember vs. another person I vaguely remember.   Here's to hoping we see a Rory v Tiger showdown in 2015."

ProGolf,2ovk45,amosni,3,Wed Dec 10 20:31:51 2014 UTC,"Rory McIlroy is alleged to have erased data from up to eight cell phones and electronic devices that may have included valuable information pertaining to his lawsuit against Horizon Sports Management, lawyers for Horizon say.   The claim made by Horizon's lawyers states that devices belonging to three others relevant to the case, including McIlroy’s father, Gerry, were also wiped. The claims are based on a court application from Horizon Sports Management, among other companies involved in the case, seeking court permission for further discovery of documents and inspections of devices belonging to McIlroy and others.  An Irish Times report indicates that Horizon's lawyers are also after material from phones belonging to Donal Casey, who formerly worked for Horizon but is now chief executive of Rory McIlroy Inc.—the golfer's current management company—and Sean O'Flaherty, McIlroy's personal assistant. Of interest to the defendants are files including text messages, messages sent using What's App and material stored on the cloud.  Paul Sreenan, a lawyer for McIlroy's ex-management team, said his clients brought the application because McIlroy had not cooperated in responding to requests for more information in the case. Better disclosure is required in order for the defendants to prove their counter-claim of an outstanding $3 million McIlroy owes in off-course revenues, according to Sreenan.  McIlroy’s alleged actions are “incredible for a person in this position,” said Sreenan.  According to an Irish Independent report, Sreenan thinks his clients, if granted access to the devices, may be able to recover some of information that’s allegedly been deleted. McIlroy initially claimed he changed devices due to his impermanent lifestyle and to dodge calls from journalists. Sreenan’s clients believe McIlroy would not have done so without backing up important information elsewhere.  McIlroy's attorney, Michael Cush, said in court that there was ""nothing unusual"" about McIlroy's activity with his phones, and that the golfer prefers to have the latest model and often deletes data when switching.  Days after splitting from Horizon Sports Management in May of 2013, McIlroy sued the company over an “unconscionable” contract that he says cost him $6.8 million in commission fees. McIlroy alleges that Horizon is not entitled to certain fees to be paid in the future pertaining to his massive, nine-figure deal with Nike. The suit also claims that McIlroy had ""markedly inferior"" commercial terms compared to Graeme McDowell, another Horizon client, despite being assured their contracts were similar.  The lawsuit is scheduled to go to trial in January. McIlroy said in October he would take a break from golf to prepare for the case. Since then, he has played in the DP World Tour Championship, where he recorded a T2 finish, and the Australian Open, where he finished T15."

As a fan of boxing I would like to see them there, but I also don't care too much for the format of Olympic boxing with extra head gear and stuff.

ProGolf,2ocv0n,c-fox,12,Fri Dec 5 15:05:40 2014 UTC,Often forgotten but Jimmy Walker deserves mention.  27 Events played in 2014:   3 Wins 10 Top 10s 23 Cuts Made   T8 Masters  T6 Players  T9 US Open  T7 PGA Championship

Your neurology, mental state, body, and emotions are just too complicated to control all the time. He probably would have been better off taking what comes to him naturally instead of trying to reinvent the wheel every so often. This just wears down the tread on body and brain. Perhaps that's the core of his dilemma: he's not as naturally gifted as Jack was or as Ernie is and must approach his game like an engineer -- practicing like a man possessed -- in order to overcome some skill gaps."
ProGolf,2o5z48,veringer,4,Wed Dec 3 18:29:19 2014 UTC,"I agree, but would say his swing as an amateur and what won him the 97 Masters was his natural swing based on feel.  Guys like Ian Baker-Finch say never to mess with your swing which I believe.  If you look at all the short hitters, they never go through swing changes.  If they did, their games would have suffered and we would never have heard of them e.g. Jim Furyk, Corey Pavin, Fred Funk, Loren Roberts, etc.  And consider this thought experiment: If Bubba Watson started seeing a swing coach to work on hitting the ball more consistent and straighter, what do you think would happen to his scores and rest of his career?"

ProGolf,2mp5ap,Dizlor,4,Tue Nov 18 23:46:32 2014 UTC,"There's a lot of things I dislike about Tiger but that article was mean-spirited and its obvious.   Golf Digest is just flopping around on the ground as the market that once was print-media dries up, which is naturally going to be less graceful than what we're used to from the publication.   Their new TMZ style approach to professional golf is, if nothing else, a departure from their useless ""hot-lists"" that come out every 3-months, where every single manufacturer is represented equally...no payoffs happening there, right Golf Digest?  They have gone from the coffee-table, to the back of the toilet, and now finally to the dumpster...still wrapped in plastic so all those inserts don't fall out. Yes Golf Digest, I know my subscription is ending, but I also know you'll keep giving them to me for free even after that, just like you always do; gotta keep those circulation numbers up, right?

ProGolf,2mp5ap,babbleon5,1 point,Wed Nov 19 15:21:04 2014 UTC,"I didn't find the article that funny, but Tiger is overreacting and shining light on something that wouldn't have been talked about at all if he hadn't decided to make a stink about it.  Bad PR move.  I'm glad the vast majority of golf media seems to agree.    It doesn't help that he's taking on Dan Jenkins, who is a total bad ass and arguably the best golf sportswriter ever.  And (despite this article) still hilarious at 85 years old.  His twitter account is a must follow during majors."
ProGolf,2mp5ap,DoubleSuited,3,Wed Nov 19 00:03:43 2014 UTC,"I actually find it really interesting that, if down votes are any indication, this sub is vastly pro-Tiger on this issue.

To clarify, I also haven't found ANYONE who thought the article was good, or funny, or even a good idea; Tiger's reaction, though, was just bad, and it's what people are criticizing him for."
ProGolf,2mp5ap,DoubleSuited,1 point,Wed Nov 19 18:03:40 2014 UTC,"The article was neither funny nor creative.

ProGolf,2miwbu,Quantization,10,Mon Nov 17 03:09:00 2014 UTC,2004 was the best. you could even design your own courses. However there's a new PGA Tour game coming out next year based on the frostbite 3 engine (same engine as battlefield 4). Looks really good http://www.easports.com/pga-tour
ProGolf,2miwbu,rsmnemisis5,2,Mon Nov 17 03:46:37 2014 UTC,"The problem with 04 was that it was stupidly easy. I loved the game, but I could go -20 to -25 every round on some of the easier courses. They introduced a bunch of new mechanics in the later games to combat this and give the game a more realistic difficulty curve. I don't think they ever really got it right until the last one."

The article says T Watson blames the players unfairly.  First of all, I think Tom handled himself professionally having been caught off guard by the unprofessional Michelson. Secondly, US players were simply beat. If in a relay footrace you and your teammates are slower than the other team, it doesn't matter who goes first or last, you're just slower."

ProGolf,2kanmf,Sentri,1 point,Sun Oct 26 03:57:31 2014 UTC,"I'm guessing the demand is too small for the costs. I've worked in Europe helping arrange tournaments and at least here it seems that the ""common golfer"" is mostly interested in their own game, and maybe a couple of the biggest names. The people who are more interested tend to follow live scoring online or on mobile.  We televised a challenge tour tournament and it was a big undertaking requiring a lot of crew. It wasn't even live, only two ""highlights"" episodes showing only a couple specific holes. Televising a bigger tournament and doing it live must be a magnitude larger of an accomplishment."
ProGolf,2kanmf,Banjo777,1 point,Sun Oct 26 11:32:46 2014 UTC,"Ratings may be low but the viewership has high disposable income, which is why advertisers love golf. All those car ads, expensive watches etc."

They have to take the US feed sometimes, which is annoying as the American commentary is fairly inane and intrusive.    For the majors and other big events the coverage is usually 6 hours long, and a hell of a lot more shots are shown than on US tv.    The British Open is on BBC, which has no adds, and shows about 12 hours of live coverage, for all 4 days."
ProGolf,2kanmf,VanguardAssassin,1 point,Thu Nov 6 20:18:53 2014 UTC,I completely agree. I've always wondered the same thing.
ProGolf,2k0alq,SoyPelon,31,Wed Oct 22 16:55:03 2014 UTC,"Where to start... First off playing professional golf is not easy. My good rounds are mid 60s at my home course my bad rounds are 74-75. I am nowhere even close to professional quality. These guys are going to the hardest courses with a million people watching and shooting the same scores I am. But this isn't about me. To play professional golf it's a full time job. You're not going to do it working full time and practicing on the side. Next don't read a book, if you're serious go see your nearest TEACHING PROFESSIONAL, not some course pro. Realize that your journey from 15- scratch is 10000x easier than the journey from scratch to +7+8 which is where you'll need to be. You're going to need a sponsor. People don't realize how expensive it is to play professional golf. The few guys I know hanging around the mini tours are paying about $100,000 a year in travel fees, entry fees, equipment, courses,etc. Unless you're stupid loaded you're gonna have to find a backer but that's still at the very least a couple years away. Professional golf isn't fun. People see these guys making millions but that's maybe 1% of professional golfers which is 1% of scratch golfers. It's no longer the sport you love when you have to make an 8 footer to cash a check and for that to go towards your gas to the next even."
ProGolf,2k0alq,TheTrillFam,10,Wed Oct 22 17:20:07 2014 UTC,"Well said. It's a long, hard road. I played college golf and one of my teammates is currently playing the mini tours. Has been doing so for several years. He's good. Damn good. Beats me easily and I'm a zero handicap. He struggles out there. It's a hard life."
ProGolf,2k0alq,i_shoot_69,5,Wed Oct 22 17:52:21 2014 UTC,"I have heard the exact same thing that you mentioned about professional golf not being fun. I played in the Shell Houston Open Pro-Am with Johnson Wagner and I was asking his opinion on going pro. He said that he had a lot of fun on the Nationwide Tour, but the PGA is full of a bunch of pricks. Big egos and not many genuinely nice guys.   I enjoy golf too much to ruin it by becoming professional. It goes from being a hobby to being a job. I played as an amateur in a Hooters Tour tournament a few years ago. I had a blast. Nothing was better than being in a tournament with no expectations on my result. I won low amateur and beat out all of the college golfers in the field although I was actively working as an intern for an oil and gas company. Golf is a lot more fun when your income isn't relying on whether or not you get up and down from the bunker on 18. Removing the stress aspect of the game can shave tons of strokes off in a tournament. I saw tons of great golfers having a miserable time playing poorly because they new that their families wouldn't be getting a big payday from dad this week. It's tough.  If this is your dream, go for it. The most important advice I can give you is to play as many tournaments as possible right now. Get your experience playing under pressure and needing to come through in the clutch. You don't want to have a 5 foot putt on the 18th in Q-school to make the cut, and that is the first time you have experienced that kind of pressure. Hold off on declaring pro as long as possible. Amateur tournaments are full of some of the best talent out there (US Amateur, US Open, State Amateur, Pub Links, etc). These tournaments will be a hell of a lot cheaper for you to gain experience without paying thousands of dollars. Usually this is how you build up a resume of results that you would use when pursuing a financial sponsor. They want to see that you have performed well under pressure.   Good luck to you. If you are seriously determined and driven, you will compete no doubt. Get a personal trainer and nutritionist too. I think people underestimate how much strain that much golf can put on your body. You need to generate as much power as possible out of your body, all the while staying limber. Flexibility is your friend. Just look at Rory."

ProGolf,2k0alq,LocutusOfOrc,7,Wed Oct 22 17:20:51 2014 UTC,"sorry to burst your bubble, but you have absolutely no shot.  You're gonna have to compete with people that have done nothing but play golf for their entire life.  even if you had enough money to do nothing but practice 10h/day for the next 8 years, it would still be a long shot to even get close to tour level."

An attempt to replace something you think is missing in your life? Set yourself some realistic life goals, and you'll be happy when you you achieve them. Pursue the unobtainable, and you'll be dejected when you almost inevitably fail."
ProGolf,2k0alq,eire9,3,Wed Oct 22 23:20:52 2014 UTC,"If you're going to read any book, pick up Paper Tiger by Tom Coyne. It will at least provide you some perspective of the task at hand. He tried to do just this (though in a shorter time frame) and couldn't get through the Canadian Tour's Q School. He was also starting as a player who had been scratch already.   It's not impossible with a lot of time and a lot of money, but it's pretty close. One of my best friends spent a couple years on mini tours, had his PGA card for last season, and is now back to the Web.com tour. He's +6, purest game I've ever played with, but so is everyone out on tour. It's really fucking hard to get there and even harder to stay. Good luck though and I hope you succeed."

ProGolf,2k0alq,_excuseme,3,Thu Oct 23 00:51:11 2014 UTC,"This. The week before the Heritage I've been lucky enough to see (and once play with) a bunch of pga guys that are getting rounds in around hilton head and your quote couldn't be more accurate.   Everyone has seen the scratch guys go out and rip your home course, but watching these guys come in and just destroy a course from the tips is a sight.  We are used to watching pros play on courses in tournament conditions, slick greens, jungle-like rough, toughest pins, etc but seeing them crank 3-woods out of the sand and stop them on the green for eagles, holing out every chip, sinking 30 foot putts - and more importantly expecting to do all of those things all of the time is amazing."
ProGolf,2k0alq,what-the-what-what,3,Thu Oct 23 03:45:27 2014 UTC,"Play every amateur tournament you can find.  Outside of tournaments, play for money.  If you are not a long hitter, learn how to hit it EXACTLY where you are aiming.  Make EVERY putt inside three feet.  KNOW that you'll make EVERY putt inside of ten feet.  When you are inside 100 yards, EXPECT to get it up-n-in.  EXPECT every straightforward chip, pitch and bunker shot to find the bottom of the cup.  Don't put an age or time on your goals.  Try to shave AT LEAST one stroke off your handicapp each year.  Once you are scratch or better and won a few tough local amateur tournaments, that is just the beginning.  Because to go from there to PRO on ANY tour is REALLY hard and will definitely take you into your 40s.  All the best man and don't let anyone tell you you can't do it!"

ProGolf,2k0alq,VanguardAssassin,2,Thu Oct 23 00:08:02 2014 UTC,"first off where do you live and how much money do you have. and how much time do you have. time is not on your side and you can't buy time even with all the money in the world. and what are your stats now like how far can you hit your clubs.   practicing all day from sun up to sun down is not going to get you where you want to be. it can help get you close to scratch but your gonna need to go out and shoot low scores not hit the same 205yard 7iron with a 3yard draw 10times in a row. obviously your gonna need some practice to get to a point but banging balls all day isn't good for your physical health and your gonna hit a brick wall eventually where your not getting better on the course just becoming a range pro. playing everyday costs a lot of money also.   plus your gonna need to make putts that determine whether your gonna make the cut or pack up for the next week or the next month cause you can't swing the bills being on the road for the month. so if you have money I would put it towards a sports psych and a swing coach. your at an age where kids are coming out of college golf with a chip on their shoulder trying to do what your trying to do but they have advantage on you playing in college.   there is a lot of stuff that your gonna have to take in in a short period of time. guys on tour whether mini tour or pga have so much info being processed in such a short time that IMO it's hard to teach. when they get to there tee shot they figure out what the wind doing how will it effect my ball, what's my lie like am I on a downhill what's that gonna do to my ball flight how's that gonna work with the wind. that's just the start to. where can I bail out what's the break where I'm gonna land it on the green.   from what I know about guys that are on mini tours is that they are young, they hit it a mile, they WILL get up and down from anywhere. I don't mean they can they WILL probably 9/10 times and that there is hardly any flaws in their game. a lot of these guys are just a few good rounds away from winning on the PGA Tour. I don't want to discourage your dream but I just said what I barely know and I haven't even played on tour so I'm sure someone on tour could add a few more paragraphs."
ProGolf,2k0alq,jbomb671,2,Thu Oct 23 00:54:36 2014 UTC,"I recommend checking out the series that the Golf Channel had a few years ago called ""Pipe Dream."" It chronicles the journey of someone who used to be on the PGA tour on his road to making it back on tour. It also shows how another good player is trying to make it for the first time on tour. Both players suffer from physical and mental fatigue because they can't seem to post the scores that they ""know"" they can shoot.  Also, one of my cousins tried making it on tour. The first step is to get a professional instructor and later a sports psychologist. These two people alone may make or break your career. You'll also need to find a good caddie who gives you good distances, knows you, and knows your game better than you do.  You can do it, but it won't be easy by any means. Best of luck!  TL;DR Making the tour is tough. You have to be mentally and physically strong as a rock. Forming the right team is crucial."

ProGolf,2hychy,ashdrewness,16,Wed Oct 1 06:20:09 2014 UTC,I like Graeme McDowell a little more. Still can't stand Bubba.
ProGolf,2hychy,justsofie,7,Wed Oct 1 03:00:33 2014 UTC,"Just my personal observations...   Rory proved he deserves to be #1. Damn he is good... Reed got off my shit list. I think he needs to tone it down on tour but for the Ryder cup, he became our Ian Poulter. Him shushing the crowd after that putt on Sunday did it for me. Spieth started out hot then stumbled and never got back up. Maybe its just a maturity thing but he really seems to have a hard time forgetting about a bad shot and moving on. I like him a lot and i hope he gets past that.  I like Phil but part of me wonders if he tries to hard to be the nice guy. For the RC, I feel like playing with a little bit of grit and fire goes a long way but maybe that just isnt his style. I would love to see him as captain though.    Like i said, just my $0.02"
ProGolf,2hychy,p8ntballnxj,3,Wed Oct 1 13:06:33 2014 UTC,"I felt like Reid's action was too much when he shhh'ed the crowd...   Then I learned he was heckled about his putting on the 1st tee (in bad taste), that made his actions OK by me."
ProGolf,2hychy,stick3,2,Wed Oct 1 19:45:35 2014 UTC,That's why i was cool with the shhhh'ing. They where giving him some shit so he gave it right back. Loved it.
ProGolf,2hychy,p8ntballnxj,1 point,Wed Oct 1 20:33:29 2014 UTC,As a Europe supporter I was embaressed by the lack of class that heckler had on the first tee. Patrick deserved that little victory a few shots into the round
ProGolf,2hychy,kliba,2,Wed Oct 1 21:01:15 2014 UTC,"I am pretty much right there with you on all regards. Reed definitely changed my opinion, just which he would lose that choker necklace... Agree with Rory, Spieth, and Phil"
ProGolf,2hychy,FreeStateBro,4,Wed Oct 1 19:50:51 2014 UTC,"Was impressed with Patrick Reed. I hated him, and his damn necklace. But the guy can play, and is super clutch. I may not cheer for him in tourneys over some of my favorites, but it's coming around."
ProGolf,2hychy,Canuck1stan,4,Wed Oct 1 05:39:11 2014 UTC,Phil is still a whiner and not good at matchplay.
ProGolf,2hychy,ISISFieldAgent,3,Wed Oct 1 14:21:59 2014 UTC,"I was getting really annoyed with Ian Poulter.  The chest pounding move was obviously rehearsed and WAY over-used.  When you try to make every shot seem epic, it really cheapens it when you actually make an epic shot."
ProGolf,2hychy,JstAnthrReddtor,8,Wed Oct 1 17:07:09 2014 UTC,"I know he wasn't playing, but he is still technically a golfer... but it changed my views on Tom Watson. Previously I held him in such high esteem as one of the greatest and classiest guys in the sport and thought he could do no wrong, but last week has made me see him differently. He still showed absolute class in the manner in which he presented himself, but I sometimes felt a little embarrassed for him when he spoke. He just resembled an old man struggling to keep up with the pace of the whole event. It was a shame to see him like that."
ProGolf,2hychy,nobbythenosher,2,Wed Oct 1 09:24:26 2014 UTC,"As a european, not that it should make a difference, I agree with your comments regarding his resemblance of an old man struggling to keep up with the pace of things. However, I believe if there was more of a unity in the American squad that this may have lessoned the burden on him and he may not have been exposed as such.    it changed my views on Tom Watson. Previously I held him in such high esteem as one of the greatest and classiest guys in the sport and thought he could do no wrong, but last week has made me see him differently   I also feel this shouldn't change your views on him. Yes he may be a tad out of touch, but that's not his fault, it's only natural. A shame to see him like that yes, but you saw him for who he is, still a classy as fuck great. A genuine gentleman, who you should still hold in such high esteem, regardless of a poor result returned by players he fielded against an extremely strong and united european team driven by a charismatic captain that left no stone unturned.   Maybe Tom just didn't have the drive for it this time round? Maybe the fact he's been there done that, and remember, was the last US captain to get the tee-shirt on European factored into this. So you must remember that he's shown he's well capable to provide as captain for the US before, so I wouldn't let natural occurrences, and a poor team performance vs a great team performance factor into an opinion of the great Tom Watson.   On an opinion of his current managerial qualities, then yes by all means factor them in, but i'd still hold him personally in the same esteem as I would have a week ago."
ProGolf,2hychy,Madabok,1 point,Wed Oct 1 15:43:44 2014 UTC,"I am actually from the UK so I wasn't technically 'supporting' Tom Watson either, but like i said, he always has been one of my favourite men in the sport. I just felt it tarnished my personal views of him as a ""hero"". I don't agree that he didn't have the drive though, I just think his biggest mistake was saying that the only thing to have changed from his previous victory and the modern day Ryder Cup is the demands of the media. Totally false I'm afraid. The whole competition has changed and McGinley showed that there are so many more issues to tackle and get right in the preparation and run up to the start. I just think McGinley out-thought Watson. I hope for the US sake they find a winning formula and (dare i say it as a European) win one of these soon, because they'll start to lose interest in the entire thing if they don't."
ProGolf,2hychy,nobbythenosher,4,Thu Oct 2 09:15:51 2014 UTC,"Phil Mickleson. I was never a massive fan, but attempting to wind the European team up prior to the match was very juvenile. And throwing Watson under the bus afterwards is something that should never have been done in public. Yes, Watson wasn't a great captain, and yes, his management was embarrassingly out of date - but would McGinley have come in for such classless criticism if he'd lost? Hell no."

ProGolf,2hychy,pnoone44,1 point,Wed Oct 1 18:42:35 2014 UTC,"Patrick Reed for sure. I enjoyed the fire and intensity he brought to the table. Reminded a lot like how Poulter played on the last 2 days at Medinah. I had no problems with the Shhhh either. Think that type of behavior in the Ryder Cup is acceptable.   Justin Rose. That guy is stone cold killer. That shot from under the tree, in the rough, with the high grass in front of him to get on the green.. I mean come on. I honestly thought that was the turning point. I looked over at my fiance and just said ""it's not happening this year"".  In fact, I don't even think he even lost a match the entire time.  Graeme McDowell, not only because of his play, but he seemed to be the only one that understood and willing to embrace the quirky Frenchman known as Victor Dubuisson (who also impressed).   Bubba Watson, was a major letdown. For someone who wears his emotions on his sleeves, we saw little life out of Bubba. Really disappointed in his performance and thought he would have shown some energy (see Patrick Reed).  Jimmy Walker. The guy can play. Listen I know the guy led the Fed Ex points most of the year, but nothing really stood out to me prior to the Ryder Cup (except Pebble). I just was not sure how he would hold up in match play or in this format. Needless to say I was impressed."
ProGolf,2hychy,FreeStateBro,1 point,Wed Oct 1 19:49:43 2014 UTC,"This may be unpopular opinion on here, but my opinion of Phil Mickelson actually improved.

ProGolf,2hychy,skrupa15,2,Wed Oct 1 13:29:59 2014 UTC,"I tend to agree.  We almost never get real answers or honest opinions from these guys, so we have to settle for phony controversies manufactured by the media.  I hope the other players don't take away from that awkward press conference that there is never any upside to giving real, honest answers, even if they convey disagreement or disapproval.  That's life, and everyone should grow up."
ProGolf,2hychy,Shine_On_Your_Chevy,1 point,Wed Oct 1 14:02:32 2014 UTC,"I agree that he was right to have his say, I just think the manner and timing of it was pretty poor. When we lost in Valhalla, the European players didn't say anything about Faldo at the press conference, in fact they defended him in front of the media. This is despite the fact that the players didn't get a long with Faldo and didn't like him much as a captain or person. I just think the European ""team mentality"" is embedded within the players and they know that a team doesn't air its dirty laundry in public."

I think ""financially sound"" is an understatement for him, but I can't imagine money would be a greater incentive than fulfillment for him to come back at 29 with so much life ahead of him. But he would have an incredibly hard time getting his game back in shape. I can't imagine how frustrating it must be to watch others live out his dream, if he really does want to compete at a high level again. It's probably naive to think he's not very interested in that disability settlement, but I would love to see him back one day. Good find, thanks for sharing."
ProGolf,2gorak,NovaNation21,2,Wed Sep 17 21:35:59 2014 UTC,By the sounds of things he might have some kind of mental illness which is stopping him from coming back. Hopefully he gets over it and comes back. The tour certainly needs some more personality.

Maybe if he had looked at 3 or 4 side-by-side shot comparisons from different tournaments, it would have established a pattern. But, he didn't and it doesn't. This says nothing about the fact that the camera angles are different, which further undermines his analysis because he's comparing apples and oranges.

ProGolf,2gjuvf,CaddieBoy,1 point,Tue Sep 16 22:43:49 2014 UTC,Those swings will also lead to future injuries.  It will be hard for tiger to be explosive and stay healthy in his 40s.

Also the military training didn't help his knees at all.   But I would love to hear a valid argument how bubbas swing is going to cause injuries, thats as fluid as it gets. Look at Couples, yeah he has back issues, but it would be a laughable argument to say his golf swing caused it."
ProGolf,2gjuvf,CaddieBoy,1 point,Wed Sep 17 00:25:10 2014 UTC,I'm not making things up out of thin air.  Tiger had to change his swing before because his body couldn't handle the explosivemess of swing in his late teens/early 20s.
ProGolf,2gjuvf,dboti,1 point,Wed Sep 17 01:19:02 2014 UTC,"All golfers have back issues, some manage them better than others. The golf swing is a violent movement no matter how fluid you make it."
ProGolf,2gjuvf,MethodAdvanced,0,Wed Sep 17 21:59:32 2014 UTC,Well he knows he cant be a consistent winner without the explosiveness. Its hard to win when the younger guys are hitting wedges into holes your hitting 7 iron into.
ProGolf,2gjuvf,xjesz,1 point,Tue Sep 16 15:08:17 2014 UTC,But he can still have a really great swing with slightly less explosiveness which will give his golf game longevity.  If he wants to get the Major record than he can't rely on explosiveness.  It will just be injury after injury like we have seen.
ProGolf,2gjuvf,dboti,0,Tue Sep 16 15:18:44 2014 UTC,"Fun drinking game.  Everytime the words ""explosive"" or ""explosiveness"" are used in a Tiger Woods discussion...take a drink.  You'll be so hammered in a matter of minutes you'll think Tiger is in his prime again."

ProGolf,2geilw,Disorganizeddon,3,Tue Sep 16 12:32:52 2014 UTC,"Section 4. Playoff rewards of article  FedEx Cup:       The player with the most points after the Tour Championship wins the FedExCup itself and $10 million of a $35 million bonus fund. The runner-up gets $3 million, 3rd place $2 million, 4th place $1.5 million, 5th place $1 million, and so on down to $32,000 for 126th through 150th place. Beginning with the 2013 season, non-exempt players who finish 126th-150th in the FedEx Cup earn Category 29 (conditional) PGA Tour status. Previously, conditional status was earned through the money list.  In 2007, the money was placed into their tax-deferred retirement accounts, not given in cash. Players under 45 are not able to access any 2007 FedExCup bonuses (as opposed to prize money earned in the tournaments themselves) until turning 45. They can invest their bonus in any manner they choose, and once they turn 45, can choose to defer payment until they turn 60 or play in fewer than 15 PGA Tour events in a season. Once a player chooses to take payments from his fund, he will receive monthly checks for five years.    Because of possible legislation affecting deferred retirement plans, in the wake of business stories that speculated that Tiger Woods could amass a $1 billion retirement fund if he won the FedExCup six more times, the PGA Tour announced a change to the payout system effective in 2008. The top 10 finishers now receive the bulk of their FedExCup bonuses in cash up front; for example, the 2008 FedExCup champion received $9 million up front and $1 million in his tax-deferred retirement account. FedExCup bonuses to finishers below the top 10 are still paid solely into the players' retirement accounts.

ProGolf,2g77ct,cominaroundthecorner,9,Fri Sep 12 20:05:50 2014 UTC,I post under ncga (northern california golf association) and my black friend got his ncga card and he always claims that he has his ncga (niggas can golf anywhere) card. He even made a shirt with the ncga logo and the fine print says niggas can golf anywhere. Still makes me laugh. But yea... its funny because I feel as though (most of us) are so beyond the ignorance of racism that you should be able to laugh.
ProGolf,2g77ct,Codyyblake1,6,Fri Sep 12 15:08:18 2014 UTC,"Are there still courses that won't let black people play? I really feel like Tiger knocked the ""no blacks"" sentiment out of golf."
ProGolf,2g77ct,Titleistguy,3,Fri Sep 12 14:01:25 2014 UTC,"I was just going to ask, what course doesn't allow black people?"
ProGolf,2g77ct,The_Monsieur,2,Fri Sep 12 14:05:18 2014 UTC,"This ad is from 1996. Golf was very very white before Tiger...  An example, from the obituary of Hall Thompson  ""Two months before the 1990 P.G.A. Championship at Shoal Creek and six years after the club hosted the 1984 P.G.A., Mr. Thompson responded to a question from a reporter for The Birmingham Post-Herald about Shoal Creek’s membership, which included Jews and women, by saying, “We don’t discriminate in every other area except blacks.”"
ProGolf,2g77ct,Codyyblake1,3,Fri Sep 12 14:10:45 2014 UTC,That's crazy that this kind of discrimination was allowed in 1996. That's not even 20 years ago...
ProGolf,2g77ct,TedMcGriff,2,Fri Sep 12 14:40:40 2014 UTC,"It's not really about being ""allowed.""  Private clubs don't have to explicitly state a reason why they don't allow membership to an individual, and there's not any way to force their hand if they're not explicitly stating they don't allow membership to certain races.  Pretty easy to get away with discrimination in these cases, and it likely perpetuates without much resistance because most discriminated groups aren't going to have any interest in trying to join a club like that anyway.  There's just very little legal recourse to force a private membership organization to diversify their membership.   I would guess the vast majority of private clubs here in the south are still 100% white, either by design or just de facto."
