A ""teammate"" kept taking my kills for no reason and then t-baged me instead of healing me.

So even though he was using ""covert"" the guy knew exactly where he was.  No I'm not new I've played this quite a bit and I kill covert guys all the time.  Its actually quite fun cause they get false confidence like someone doesnt know they are there.  I always stray from my team a tad and never use covert and I never get stealth shived or suprise attacked very often from any covert users.  Its the biggest waste of points someone can use I cant believe high level use it at all.  Usually crappy ones"

thelastofusfactions,3e4p64,joncology,2,Tue Jul 21 23:52:26 2015 UTC,"np i gotcha on some tips:  1) NEVER RUN because you show up on radar 2) keep looking at the scoreboard at stick with the person on your team that's in first place. 3) constantly get boxes over approaching enemies (unless your team is engaging them) 4) Always have your eyes in directions your teammates aren't looking, odds are, the enemy is coming from that direction. 5) Find a starting weapon that you kind of like and MASTER IT. All weapons are balanced but are very different from each other. Pool all your parts into upgrading that weapon immediately. Don't put purchasable weapons in your custom loadout until you get descent in the game. 6) Invest in either first aid training 2/3, Reviver 2/3, or Crafter 2/3. These non combative perks assist your team and can change the tide of battle. You can achieve 1st place in a match without ever firing a shot.  Helpful?"

thelastofusfactions,3e48jm,LethalPuppy,2,Tue Jul 21 21:40:52 2015 UTC,"Play the story first. You gotta learn the mechanics of the game before you compete against real people, it's a lot easier that way."
thelastofusfactions,3e48jm,Thatsnowconeguy,2,Tue Jul 21 21:58:11 2015 UTC,"Have him do the campaign first, for sure. That's what I did and I'm so happy I did. You learn the controls and you know them like the back of your hand before even jumping into Factions. Not only that but sometimes in the lobby, people talk about the game and they could potentially spoil upcoming things for your friend that you only want him to experience for himself first-hand. I just got Remastered after having played the PS3 version since release day and although the controls aren't drastically different, after being used to the same thing for 2 years, it did take some getting used to but I just jumped right into Factions. I wish I would've just went through the campaign instead tbh and I had to switch the controls to the default PS3 controls but I might go through the campaign and get used to the new ones before going back into Factions. Not only that but having him play through the campaign first properly introduces him to both the Fireflies and the Hunters and then he can choose whichever side he wants to be on after having some information on them and knowing what they're about and it's cool knowing the history of the map you're playing on and how it incorporates to the main story. It's also fun to think that while Joel and Ellie are on their journey, other Fireflies and Hunters are fighting over turf and supplies."

If you see me doing some weird shots at your team, my teammate is behind you. I hate slow games like on Lakeside.

If a man goes down in the middle of a firefight and the opposing team has the other guys pinned down, I'll rush into the battlefield and pick him up. I've gotten away with more risky revives then I logically should have by doing this. It's always a reward when the player I revive has their wits about them and doesn't get downed instantly again.  I don't use CT anymore so I try to keep up aggressively, but I still tend to fallback during firefights if I'm not a medic. I've discovered I'm best with mid range weapons.

The problem is that I don't have the aim or the map control for that  so my success varies a ton. I'll have 15 down games and 2 down games, and sometime right after each other.

Using the frontier it's usually one shot, hit cover or duck - strafe out of inevitable bullets, second shot down. Since aiming slows every movement down I usually only aim when I know I'll shoot, but the only problem is sometimes my timing is off and I won't shoot at all. I have a bad habit of reloading often so the second upgrade is a godsend. I make sure to mark everyone, instantly if they're far or right before I'm going to shoot if they're close, and prioritize revives over kills, specifically for points. I'm usually the guy going around the team and flanking from the side or the back. Since I don't use covert I usually just walk around, which with agility is really nice and quick, usually go in when my team has their attention but sometimes I got to get in there and mix it up. And I always aim for the legs when facing an armored opponent, so I can imagine that's why some people rage quit as soon as I down them sometimes lol."

I'm not a great player and know it but enjoy the game.  I'll usually grab a box, try for a quick kill of an off guard enemy rushing to their second box.  Next I get to a second box then try to cut across the map to find the enemies who are just circling boxes.  If we start falling behind I usually switch to a loadout w/ burst pistol and reviver 2/3 and hang close behind my teammates. Lately I've been starting with a silenced burst or frontier rifle and collector 2 and scavenger 2, then, if things are going well and I've upgraded my weapon twice, switch to a loadout with sharp ears and hawkeye to make sure I and my team know where the enemy is. If I am doing really poorly I'll look at the scoreboard to see who is doing best on my team and shadow them to provide support and hopefully rely on their skill to help me get back into the groove. If that teammate has covert I'll hang a bit further back and keep an eye out for a flank, then rush in once they engage."

thelastofusfactions,3dwkza,BrendenOtt,2,Mon Jul 20 03:22:15 2015 UTC,Should probably post that clip and get some feedback first before you go and report someone.   PS3 or PS4?

thelastofusfactions,3dwkza,ExOTiC1234,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:30:53 2015 UTC,He wasnt cheating if it was on PS4. You either got outplayed or he was lagging.
thelastofusfactions,3dwkza,DC11GTR,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:33:53 2015 UTC,"Is it impossible to cheat on PS4? He was killing people at the start of matches from the opposite side of the map with a hunting rifle. It seemed like he was cheating to me. I played with him for multiple matches, and his internet wasn't that bad. And it's not like any of us were significantly better than others the whole time. It just seemed like he was using an exploit on this particular map. Simple as that."
thelastofusfactions,3dwkza,looklook876,3,Mon Jul 20 03:44:14 2015 UTC,The dam has spots on each starting spawns side where you can snipe across the entire map. I do all the time if I'm HR'ing it and I've seen people damn near squad wipe 15 seconds into a match doing it.
thelastofusfactions,3dwkza,ExOTiC1234,4,Mon Jul 20 03:59:35 2015 UTC,Well you can easily shoot people with a hunting rifle from across the dam
thelastofusfactions,3dwkza,Fanaticfive,0,Mon Jul 20 03:58:47 2015 UTC,"Sounds like he used a common spot to snipe across the map. If you spawn on the bottom side of rhe dam, theres a spot right in the middle where you can sholt through the dam. And then theres a ton of spots where you climb on a box and can hit people across the map. I'd like to see the video clip, no ones gonna witch hunt him because he obviously wasnt hacking."

We played with this guy for a few matches, and we had no problem until this match. Everyone seemed to have great connections. I've been playing video games for several years, but you all have to agree this looks weird. Sorry, it's such a short clip. I was trying to post quickly.

thelastofusfactions,3dwkza,DC11GTR,3,Mon Jul 20 04:08:25 2015 UTC,"Yes, that looks really weird! There is no weapon (except of the shiv and one hit board) that downs you with one shot without breaking your armour. The killcam turned in a really weird direction too. I have no explanation for this. Perhaps he was behind you and invisible caused by a lag or something like that"
thelastofusfactions,3dwkza,FaithNoPatton1,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:15:21 2015 UTC,I have had weird lag like that before. All the players on the field turned invisible to me and I was left wandering around the match with no one to engage with until it was sudden death. I've even had lag were I'd get killed by a delayed molotov throw. But I'm not sure his videos are lag.
thelastofusfactions,3dwkza,UnblockZippityzapp,2,Tue Jul 21 17:41:03 2015 UTC,So nobody thinks this is out of the norm at all?

thelastofusfactions,3duawq,kratosgow342,2,Sun Jul 19 15:26:10 2015 UTC,I think party mode is a lot more fun.  I like playing with and against high level players.  Ill play party mode solo a lot to be put on a team.  Sometimes it will be a lobby full of low level randoms I just quit and start a new search.  I lost my patience trying to babysit crappy players.  In party mode I can usually trust my teammate so I constantly am on the move and doing more risky things.  In no party mode with 3 crappy teammate I stay as far away as possible since they will not kill anyone and cause me to get swarmed.  Plus I have to play more cautious which is boring.
thelastofusfactions,3duawq,primer99,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:19:40 2015 UTC,"I have a question now, is the play DLC option for ps3 no parties or parties allowed? Because I have been playing that and I have to say I am really tired of carrying my team and still losing the match."

thelastofusfactions,3duawq,xYnazz,-4,Sun Jul 19 18:14:18 2015 UTC,No parties mode is atrocious and should have never been implemented in the game.
thelastofusfactions,3duawq,BodyshotWizard,5,Sun Jul 19 15:37:54 2015 UTC,"You don't make sense. Not everyone has people to play with. In fact, most don't. Team oriented game doesn't mean ""everyone plays with friends"", it simply means ""people are split into random teams that play vs each other"".  Unless this is some really weird joke"
thelastofusfactions,3duawq,BigDaddy0790,2,Sun Jul 19 18:07:45 2015 UTC,"You don't have to play with friends. You can go by yourself and even make new friends to play with. No parties playlist just encourages lone wolf behavior and it's where the most frustrating things happen (players don't revive, kill steal, sprinting everywhere, etc.)"
thelastofusfactions,3duawq,BodyshotWizard,2,Sun Jul 19 18:38:30 2015 UTC,"You don't make sense again. How does it encourage anything? It simply means that you are guaranteed to play against people who won't be in a coordinated team kicking your ass. Can you even imagine the number of ""OMG MATCHAMAKING IN THIS GAME SUCKS"" posts if playlists were mixed, and you had no way of knowing whether or not the team playing against you is coordinating?  Frustrating things you mention only mean that those players aren't very good. They'd do the exact same shit in the other playlist, maybe even with their friends."
thelastofusfactions,3duawq,BigDaddy0790,2,Sun Jul 19 18:51:26 2015 UTC,Furthermore if you go into parties on your own you could potentially meet a full party who communicate effectively. That is very difficult to face on your own. Sure you have 3 teammates but they usually won't be in game chat.

thelastofusfactions,3dqzi7,Felaktigt,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:35:58 2015 UTC,But with that logic Spanish comes before English.

thelastofusfactions,3dqzi7,Mateuz_TLOU,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:51:40 2015 UTC,If not it comes right after English anyways.

thelastofusfactions,3dn9k0,Grenade103,4,Fri Jul 17 17:33:20 2015 UTC,There is a huge difference between HR lvl 1 and 2 while tge difference between no upgrade and lvl 1 is quite small. You could as well not upgrade it at all if you don't bother upgrading twice if you ask me.
thelastofusfactions,3dn9k0,Whatchanged,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:41:44 2015 UTC,"tbh I think there's quite a gap between base and 1, and 1 and 2. like reload time increases with tier 1 upgrade which def makes a difference imo. and even more so to tier 2. idk I like the first upgrade a lot better than base, and the second upgrade a lot better than the first."
thelastofusfactions,3dn9k0,teveisboss,3,Sun Jul 19 04:45:14 2015 UTC,"Bow, Frontier, Semi Auto and most sidearms are the only things I upgrade once. Semi is just for the larger clip. Everything else is usually twice."

thelastofusfactions,3dn9k0,michiel13,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:31:09 2015 UTC,Fair enough!
thelastofusfactions,3dn9k0,BigDaddy0790,3,Sat Jul 18 11:01:03 2015 UTC,I upgrade every main weapon to the fullest level before buying armor/purchasables and pistol upgrades.
thelastofusfactions,3dn9k0,TheKray11,5,Fri Jul 17 20:33:49 2015 UTC,Semi doesn't even need ANY upgrades to be a top tier gun.
thelastofusfactions,3dn9k0,mysticsyphon,0,Fri Jul 17 17:32:29 2015 UTC,I feel the same way about the Variable Rifle.
thelastofusfactions,3dn9k0,soysantino,2,Fri Jul 17 19:17:19 2015 UTC,"VR benefits massively from upgrades. Double upgraded the thing shoots as fast if not faster than a full auto, with higher damage output. That's when the true wreckage begins!"
thelastofusfactions,3dn9k0,MajorXaero,3,Fri Jul 17 21:36:58 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure that when timed right it shoots way faster. And don't forget the accuracy!
thelastofusfactions,3dn9k0,BigDaddy0790,2,Fri Jul 17 23:24:10 2015 UTC,nooooo. Variable shoots as slow as a semi but with 4 shots at that upgrade.

thelastofusfactions,3dn9k0,jplr98,2,Sat Jul 18 03:13:30 2015 UTC,"Semi and Revolver.  The VR noticably benefits from a double-upgrade, but to be honest a lot of games I just don't earn enough parts to fully upgrade it. Fortunately, I find it works well enough with just the one upgrade."
thelastofusfactions,3dn9k0,MeowingForVengeance,2,Fri Jul 17 18:44:10 2015 UTC,Shorty and semi dont need any upgrades.   HR definitely needs 2 upgrades though. Dont know how you guys manage with 1 upgrade level.
thelastofusfactions,3dn9k0,ExOTiC1234,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:21:50 2015 UTC,Same. HR scope-in time is pretty brutal before the second upgrade.

If I were to run up to you with the lvl 0 shorty and I tried to get in my 2 shots before you got in 2 shots with any other weapon, the majority of the time,  I'm getting stopped."
thelastofusfactions,3dn9k0,ProfOakland,2,Sat Jul 18 03:16:49 2015 UTC,"SAR, no question. After the first upgrade I just buy ammo and armor."

Even though the second upgrade on paper seems great I never bother unless I'm swimming in parts, having my sidearm double upgraded and having armor take priority over slightly faster shots and arrow travel speed."

thelastofusfactions,3dm1rv,TheLastOfYou,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:02:52 2015 UTC,A few days back a guy shotgunned me in the chest and blew off my armor and downed me in one shot. Yesterday I punched a guy as he ran around me and shivved me. Later that same day I was down and an enemy hit me with a molly as I was being revived- we both survived. I'm thinking of making a video of all the weird glitches that I encounter while playing.
thelastofusfactions,3dm1rv,TheLastOfYou,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:23:41 2015 UTC,I assume you are talking about the Tactical Shotgun there? Because normal purchasable one can down through armor.
thelastofusfactions,3dm1rv,Mateuz_TLOU,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:21:59 2015 UTC,Since when can the purchaseable shotgun down through full armor when I'm at full health?
thelastofusfactions,3dm1rv,shockmistwave,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:27:52 2015 UTC,"I never used the thing so this isn't first-hand knowledge, but I definitely remember people saying it downs straight through armor up close if you hit enemy with the entire spread point-blank."
