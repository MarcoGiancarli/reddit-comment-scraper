You disassociate, which is exactly what reddit did.   This isn't about internet censorship or free speech, this is about really shitty people having a space they never actually owned taken from them, and then squealing about it publicly. Rather than realize that their behavior was the cause of this, they find anything under the sun to blame.   I'm calling bullshit on the idea you didn't know.
