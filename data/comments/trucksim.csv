They leave with a new-found appreciation for what we truck sim vets already know about the genre: we make it look way easier than it actually is.

trucksim,3djumk,Astec123,1 point,Fri Jul 17 10:22:20 2015 UTC,Honest question that I've sadly fallen foul of several times. Is it plugged in and powered on. I found once I was playing using mine and the power plug had worked it's way out while I was getting set up and I felt it was on after hearing it doing the usual power on tests but it was powered off when I sat down. I was getting anxious as I don't get to set the wheel up very often currently.
trucksim,3djumk,Ass-Packer,1 point,Fri Jul 17 10:53:23 2015 UTC,"I have that wheel, if it wont detect the wheel but it will detech everything else then it usually means that this is unplugged."

If you signal a waiting car at an intersection, signalling you are waiting for them, they will begin moving. Just like in real life though other cars ignore you if you're just honking to demand they get out of your way.

trucksim,3davoz,Riddy86,2,Tue Jul 14 21:12:59 2015 UTC,"I dunno, that's a tough call.   A height-adjustable desk is the first thing that comes to mind, but the price range runs the gamut. The low-end desks (you just know they're gonna be flimsy/cheap) are about the same price as the Wheel Stand Pro. If you go with one of these desks, you obviously want one with no bars or partitions running along the back or between the two outer legs, so that limits your options further.  I'm not even sure if the Wheel Stand Pro is the best choice for a recliner, since the center column that the wheel is mounted on will butt up against the front of the recliner. Recliners are comfortable as hell, but I'm not sure how ergonomic it would be with a Wheel Stand Pro.  I say go with a cheap height-adjustable desk, which can be pulled closer to you (and over the recliner) while in the sitting position, and then keep the pedals right at your feet. I'm sure you could pick one up from your local office supply store. If it doesn't work for you, return it.  Barring that, some DIY project may be in order. Hell, if you really want to slum it up, you could get away with two sawhorses and a 1x8 or 2x8 piece of lumber laid on top to act as the mount for the wheel/shifter.   EDIT: Also, G27 is the most bang for your buck in my opinion. I know Logitech recently announced new wheels this past E3, but they are not a full kit like the G27 is, which includes wheel, pedals, and shifter. The new models will be more expensive (they're new), have less buttons, and the shifter is not included as a standard package item.  EDIT2: Found a video of a guy doing a quick review of the Wheel Stand Pro. He uses it while sitting on his couch, which isn't far from a recliner. Seems to work fine for him. If anything, the video will give you a sense of scale and positioning. Might work well with a recliner that is in the fully upright position. Maybe just save up for a Wheel Stand Pro and get that eventually? Decisions, decisions."

It used to add Scandinavia, now after the DLC it enhances it up to Iceland and adds some pretty sceneries to your game.  Regarding the cities it often depends if you know them in real life or not.

trucksim,3d4szn,WolfofAnarchy,2,Mon Jul 13 15:04:01 2015 UTC,"I just did what the title of your post describes without issue today. I had installed ProMods a couple weeks ago and played through a couple jobs here and there, but then decided to disable it today. I didn't remove it. I just disabled it in the profile settings mod list. After clicking through a few warning messages, I was back in vanilla+DLC version of ETS2 without any issues or corruption with my profile, and with all the XP progress I had made while playing ProMods. Granted, if there was a critical problem I would've just rolled back to the backup I made prior to installing ProMods. In the future, I would recommend you do the same.  Your profile is stored under this location (on Win7 anyway):  C:\Users\<USERNAME>\Documents\Euro Truck Simulator 2\profiles\<ALPHANUMERIC_STRING_FOLDER_NAME>   Within that alphanumeric folder is all your profile info, keybindings, game settings, and any manual saves or auto saves. You may have multiples of these alphanumeric folders (I have two, my main profile, and the profile I created when I played around with the MP mod last year, which I haven't touched since).   You can backup an individual alphanumeric folder, or just backup the entire profiles folder (which would backup all profiles within). I just right-click and send it to a ZIP file with a date and a description like ""profiles_vanilla_backup_pre_ProMods_061115.zip"". That's the actual filename for my backup.  What most likely happened in your scenario is you had ProMods installed through several revisions or updates of either ProMods or the actual ETS2 official patches, and then decided to make some changes that likely caused profile corruption.   Get in the habit of making backups before making any major mod changes, and you should be covered from this sort of data loss. If you need any more help or have any questions, feel free to ask."

trucksim,3cwv18,sklopnicht,2,Sun Jul 12 07:21:29 2015 UTC,Nice! Which mod do you use to add more traffic to the game?

Try googling a guy called Supric, I think. He's made a file you can download that changes a bunch of behaviour. That's a good place to start :) I should warn you though, performance takes a big hit if you really up the traffic. And it's good for wide open roads with traffic lights, but on smaller roads without traffic lights you can get stuck!"

Some have said it's based off trailers already in the loading area and collision detection, and to keep an eye out for that.  There's probably a high amount of truth to that, but I was driving in to a town a couple patches back and noticed an overturned trailer in the middle of the road, that had collision on.  Being a new player I didn't think to pay attention to the cargo type, and ended up choosing that exact cargo for my next trip.  100% damage and a service call, life is suffering."

trucksim,3cffy8,mtb1443,3,Tue Jul 7 23:43:23 2015 UTC,Why does he detach the trailer. go to pay the toll then reattach?
trucksim,3cffy8,jamiemulcahy,9,Tue Jul 7 17:07:47 2015 UTC,He's using a mod that contains oversized cargo. When trying to get through the toll normally with the oversize trailer the barrier comes down before you are clear and you get stuck. Taking a run at speed means you can get through quicker and make it. I guess detaching the trailer makes backing out of the tool booth easier
trucksim,3cffy8,sudin,2,Tue Jul 7 17:40:23 2015 UTC,"It seems that if he has the trailer attached when he rolls up to pay, the load collides with the structure as he comes to a halt damaging the trailer to 100%, so he has to drive through at speed to make it."

If you click the play button on steam, it should give you the option of launching in either DirectX or OpenGL.  Another possible solution would be to turn off VSync. If you are getting 30-59 fps, then it will lock your framerate at 30 fps. The reason that might be causing it is possible higher density/higher quality textures with the new DLC."

Just throw them a bone every now and then. Don't monetize every single goddamn thing you can.  It ultimately becomes counter-productive.  Especially since SCS fans tend to evangelize the company far more than most game fans.  Plus, releasing new content for free keeps the player base interested and active.  It gives then a reason to dust off the game, even if it's been a few months since they last played.  Which in turn means they're more likely to pay attention to  future releases."

You seem to be suggesting that SCS should stop being nice to the vast majority of their fans just to punish the minority who are loudmouths and shit-stirrers.  Besides, frankly, even having people complaining about not enough free content downloads is basically advertising of its own.  The first question such a post would plant in people's minds is, ""Wait, SCS gives away content?""  I mean, SCS is operating in the same basic market where it's commonplace to charge extra for every new aircraft or every new train engine, much less fully-built towns.  Compared to many of the other sims on the market, SCS is a goddamn charity.  If the kiddies and assholes want to bitch online about how they want even MORE free stuff, that still gets word out about how generous SCS is with their patches and updates."

Some like EA are practically notorious for simply axing anything that people complain about.  (Example:  The first Mass Effect utilized in-engine ""elevator ride"" sequences to cover for lengthy loading waits, complete with cute content like companions chatting among themselves.  Some people complained that these rides were boring.  So for ME2, EA removed them entirely and replaced them with... generic loading screens.)

The game quality was what I expected, that's how it looks like on my rig. I assume you used a webcam to record yourselves, I recommend getting a DSLR to get better quality. I also noticed that you used some free-trial capture software, I recommend using OBS to record the game/screen and that way you won't have that watermark at the centre-top and can record longer videos. To be fair I have a feeling that she didn't get briefed about the game and how to control it beforehand, but I think that was intentional because that's the video you wanted to make, fair enough I guess. It would've been easier if she used a controller instead of KB&M when playing ETS2 and you can do the same as well if you do have a controller.  Do with this feedback as you see fit. Personally I didn't enjoy well that's not entirely true, I thought it was okay. If you do plan on uploading videos regularly then I do recommend that you take my feedback into account.  Well, I think this post is getting too long so I'll leave it as is, thanks for sharing."
trucksim,3btp5p,Finrow,2,Thu Jul 2 04:06:20 2015 UTC,"Hey thanks for watching! I'm not going to use my dslr like i do with all my other videos (although the 24mm f/1.8 would look sexy) because the video file would be huge. One video we recorded was around 20 GB for 45 min of footage, which is about the same amount of time we got here.  Secondly, my channel is mainly live action stuff, we were just kinda fooling around with the gameplay idea. To buy software for this isn't important to me. I couldn't care less about the watermark.  And yes to throw her in without instruction was the idea. I opened steam, told her click that one, then made her play it. To give her a controller would just make things worse. At least she's used a computer before (it might not seem that way though). So I take your comment with a grain of salt, I find the stuff I make funny and hope other people do too. But you can't please everyone I guess. It's too bad I can't entertain everyone but it's something I'm used to."

When it was new, it was in its own class. However, compared to Euro Truck 2 (a newer game by 5 years), it's bad. ALH doesn't have good AI, the handling of the vehicles are dodgy as hell, lots more things that ETS2 does better.  If you really want the American maps and trucks, go for it! I'm not saying you can't get the game, but if you're looking to kill time before American Truck Simulator comes out, maybe just download the demo of ALH or wait until ATS comes out.  e: Alternatively you can ""download"" Hard Truck: 18 Wheels of Steel, the original game that started the whole series.

trucksim,3bkksm,Thromordyn,13,Mon Jun 29 23:56:53 2015 UTC,"They've made the trailers more sensitive to damage (the first time I noticed it was when Scandinavia was released). It no longer takes a hit that ""registers"" the damage with a notification to ding a trailer. Rubbing a guard rail on one of those way-too-narrow on-ramps is what usually does it for me, though there's a type of worksite in Scandinavia that has gotten me a couple of times as well."
trucksim,3bkksm,ErikMTL,7,Tue Jun 30 04:45:47 2015 UTC,"Yup, this is pretty much it. If your trailer even slightly grazes a guard rail or a sign, you have a very high chance of taking damage.  It's worse if you use mods for more cargo. If you have an extra long load or wide load you're pretty much guaranteed to have a damage penalty.  Especially on those impossibly narrow on-ramps."
trucksim,3bkksm,Avengerr,9,Tue Jun 30 08:23:58 2015 UTC,"I hate those ramps.  You take it nice and wide to make the turn, and then the AI thinks that's the perfect time to cut between you and the barrier, causing a collision.  Edit: I think I'm going to engage my hazard lights any time I take one of those turns in order to prevent the AI trying to squeeze past me."
trucksim,3bkksm,thetoastmonster,3,Tue Jun 30 10:23:36 2015 UTC,Oh man I hate when the AI does that. I never thought to put the hazards on will have to try that out next time.

trucksim,3bkksm,rohboat,3,Tue Jun 30 20:59:51 2015 UTC,"I cannot agree that it is a bug, because it happens to me a LOT - I see cars merging into my trailer quite often.  (To the point where I've started quick save/quick load cycling to get rid of traffic!)  It could also be from nudging curbs or guard rails with the trailer."
trucksim,3bkksm,BlackwoodBear79,3,Tue Jun 30 00:07:51 2015 UTC,Last part is more often than not the likely cause of damage to the trailers.

trucksim,3bkksm,VT_HMQ,6,Tue Jun 30 00:46:07 2015 UTC,"I've sustained 1-2% trailer damage from simply knocking over street signs from cutting a corner too sharply. The trailer might get a scrape, at most, but the cargo inside wouldn't be damaged from something like that, so how could I be penalized? It doesn't make sense.  If you want my advice, don't obsess about it. Just drive and if you get into an accident or end up with 1-2% of unexplained trailer damage, just complete the job and move on. Even with the auto-save intervals at every 5 or 10 minutes, do you really feel it's necessary to reload and lose real-world time and in-game progress over a few percent damage? I used to reload to the most-recent auto-save whenever something bad happened, but after a while, I stopped. Drive the best you can, if following the rules and driving safely is your goal, and let the chips fall where they may.   If you get to the point where you're obsessing and becoming anxious about incurring zero damage so much that you're constantly saving/reloading, you should stop and take a step back and ask yourself if this is what you want your gaming experience to be."

trucksim,3biflm,David_Mudkips,3,Mon Jun 29 14:59:17 2015 UTC,"My understanding from browsing /r/trucking is that the farther back the trailer sits, the smoother the ride is.

trucksim,3biflm,SomeRandomMax,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:03:30 2015 UTC,"It was explained on here or on the scs forums, I can't find it atm but i think it has to do with pulling power and having the weight of the load not tipping the truck back which might cause the front wheels to lose contact with the ground."

trucksim,3biflm,SomeRandomMax,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:33:26 2015 UTC,Long wheelbase is more comfortable. That's really it. Plus its a style thing. It's basically the trucker version of apehangers.
trucksim,3biflm,wickedcold,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:56:30 2015 UTC,"Except notice that the truck in your picture only has two rear axles, and the SCS truck has a very non typical for America three rear axles.  So both the huge gap and the giant sleeper cab are weird European impressions of American trucking or just a desire to showcase oddball custom trucks instead of daily drivers."
trucksim,3biflm,PhantomPhun,1 point,Thu Jul 2 01:27:49 2015 UTC,"Don't know how I missed this but just saw your comment.

They don't have the same wheelbase as the truck in my picture though."

Also, not sure whats with the MASSIVE fucking gap between the cab and trailer in pic 2 and 3.      And pic 5... WTF is that? A limo or a Semi?    Sorry, not trying to be an ass, just that people will see these and not understand. I just want to say parts of these pics are not accurate to real life to avoid users like /u/david_mudkips from getting the wrong idea about the proportions on our trucks."
trucksim,3biflm,TidusJames,3,Mon Jun 29 22:11:30 2015 UTC,"They really aren't accurate of our basic trucks you would see on the highway, neverless they are all accurate of what can be found. 1 and 2 are realistic. Just not as well known. I think it may be more prevalent among Owner Operators and the custom rig scene. The massive gap on 2&3 is more than likely just a long wheel base. It's also a daycab which takes less room than a sleeper. Could also have a sliding 5th wheel for load distribution(if it where in real life). #5 is an extended or custom sleeper. You can fit a shower, toilet, bed, kitchen and who knows what else. The video I linked to for the trailer wheelbase goes into the guys custom sleeper."
trucksim,3biflm,FlipHorrorshow,2,Tue Jun 30 03:49:16 2015 UTC,Are the trucks official or modded? I have a feeling the massive gap is from the truck and not the trailer.

That version of the truck is without the sleeper, with the other version the gap is not nearly that big. I see those trucks everyday though with the huge gap inbetween.   And that truck is pretty rare, but they're definitely around.  Just curious, what parts are not accurate to real life?

Generally you want to set up to back straight in or to the left, because when you back to the right your own truck blocks the view.  We call that the ""blind side"" because it's not easy to see.

trucksim,3b4vej,jm001,3,Fri Jun 26 00:04:25 2015 UTC,"I don't personally use any graphics enhancement mods, but did you try a Google search? (Yeah, I'm a smartass.)  Brutal HD Environments and Lautus Graphics HD seem to be your only two real options, based on those search results.  To your other point, about compatibility: in my opinion, the problem with modding in ETS2 is that despite the thriving modding community, it has never been officially supported by SCS, so no standards have been established for modders to follow. This causes compatibility issues between many mods and official updates, and between mods themselves (interoperability due to lack of standards). If you've been playing for a while, you're probably well aware of the fact that the more complicated the mod, the more likely it will be broken by an official update, which means waiting for the modder to update their mod to be compatible. I personally run very few mods because of this. Actually, up until just recently when I decided to try ProMods, I only ran two mods for years. A truck skin and a truck interior mod. In the beginning (back when the game was launched), I tried loads of mods, but eventually got tired of playing mod-update-whack-a-mole.   Back then, mods were also hosted on sketchy-looking websites that were basically blogs, where mods were posted as blog entries on the website. You really had to work at finding mods because the search functionality was terrible. People used what they could, but it takes a real enterprising enthusiast to sit down and make a third-party hosting website with a functional interface and all that, like I've seen with some other games. Looking at the Google search results, it looks like things have improved a little bit on that front. These two websites seem decent enough, while they still have that blog-like feel, at least there are categories to filter by and tags now:   http://ets2mods.org/ http://ets2downloads.com/   I may be going off on a tangent here, but I recently started playing FarmingSim 2013 (got it during the Steam summer sale that just ended; still waiting to snipe FS2015 when it is deep-discounted), and I was blown away at the difference in modding support compared to ETS2. In FarmSim, there are free third-party mods actually being hosted on the official FarmingSim website, and they all work flawlessly because the developer, Giants Software, set standards for modders to follow (i.e. ""If you want your mod featured on our official website, you must meet XYZ requirement). There are actual modding teams with names and logos, like a crew, making mods for games made by Giants Software. Installation also couldn't be simpler. All mods are ZIP files that you just drop into the mods folder and start the game. Even the unofficial modding sites I found were pretty well organized. Compared to my experience with ETS2, I was really impressed. SCS could learn a thing or two from Giants, I think.  SCS is planning on adding Steam Workshop support to ETS2 (something I think they should've had from the get-go) and likely also to ATS, which has been a long time coming. An in-game mod browser is also in the works, mentioned in either a SCS blog post or their newsletter. I can't remember which. In any case, SCS may have dropped the ball and come late to the party when it comes to modding support, but it seems like they're getting their act together with the modding scene for their games.  Anyway, I've rambled long enough."
trucksim,3b4vej,VT_HMQ,1 point,Fri Jun 26 02:58:48 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your in-depth reply. I did, of course, Google before posting, but it was more the compatibility affair which I was worried about; I wanted something which I had heard from users was reliable and not going to cause material problems with each update/expansion.  Unfortunately that level of feedback across the board and impression of preference is hard to find on the actual mod sites which, as you have noted, are poorly organised. The sites you mentioned are better than many, as you say, but still not as good as I'd expect to be some of the largest repositories for such an active community - things like ratings and being able to sort by most popular would seem like such obvious inclusion, although I have of course read the justifications about the flaws of trying to introduce such a system at this late juncture to an existing site.  I don't have Farming Simulator 2013 (I have that year's Agricultural Simulator, though - not sure if it's comparable but I've been looking to try that soon too). I can only hope that the communities for other games I might want to mod are also a little less hard to navigate as ETS2 is one of the first games I've had the desire and the opportunity to mod so I am a relative novice at this.  Thanks again for your in-depth reply."

I really enjoyed this small train station mod - ""New Harder Station mod"" -http://forum.scssoft.com/viewtopic.php?f=32&t=9033  But the modder never updated the mod :(  Stopped with ProMods at v1.8, as game patch broke the mod."

trucksim,3b30yg,FlakeyBear,1 point,Fri Jul 3 19:58:04 2015 UTC,"I think that's a standard paint job. You would apply it and then adjust the colors to your liking before selecting purchase. It's done in the paint options at a repair shop. However, it's been a long time since I've had the paint job that looks like that, so I might be wrong and it's part of a DLC. If it is a DLC thing, I would think it would be part of the oversized loads DLC.   That wasn't much help, but I hope there's something of use in it.  =)"
trucksim,3b30yg,ohbarf,7,Thu Jun 25 16:42:29 2015 UTC,"That is unfortunately not a standard paint job, it was included with the High Power Cargo Pack DLC. The custom license plate can be made at the World of Trucks site (just create your own account and log in to it in game). :)"

trucksim,3atz30,i_hope_i_remember,11,Tue Jun 23 14:19:19 2015 UTC,"Living in Tasmania I was super excited to see this map, so I downloaded and started playing.  At first I wasn't all that excited about it as the jobs within the map itself were scarce and I kept on having to go back to Europe to complete them.  With that, I started to explore the map and found myself on the road to Queenstown.  This road is beautiful.  Having driven it myself numerous times in real life, the maker of this map has captured the true essence of the road.  Tight turns, with superb undulations, narrow and no run off.  As you can see by the pictures, there was a rockfall which closed the main highway.  Because of this, I had to take a detour which almost put me into Spin Tires territory, with rutted water logged crossings and two of the most nerve wracking bridges.  I am looking forward to continue on with this map and plan to just do statewide deliveries instead of heading back into Europe.  Here is a link to the map.  I suggest you use a truck with lots of power and 6x4 configuration, especially of you want to tackle the off-road detour.  Right hand drive is also more realistic.  I can't wait for more updates to this map as it will be a lot more fun."

trucksim,3aopqw,Evgenit,13,Mon Jun 22 06:48:45 2015 UTC,"World of Trucks is a site where players of SCS's ETS2 and upcoming games that support this feature can share screenshots and have a discussion about them. Users can create a license plate with a custom string and upload it to ETS2 and upcoming games for use in-game. Users can share their screenshots and profile to other social networking sites like Twitter, Pinterest, Google+ or Facebook. Users can either like, favorite or comment on a screenshot. If a user is lucky their screenshot will appear on editor's pick. Editor's pick is basically a dev choosing a screenshot they find interesting and posting it to the Editor's Pick gallery (Reddit's Front Page). There are also achievements to shoot for if one desires, one such achievement is getting your screenshot chosen for editor's pick. SCS hold special events on World of Trucks to give users a chance to own exclusive content.  Such exclusive content and events included:   Metallic Paint Jobs Pack for creating a user profile in World of Trucks. (Can be purchased from Steam. Corresponding SCS blog.) There was a competition held by SCS on the World of Trucks site that allowed users to win various goodies, details about the competition can be found in the following SCS blog post. Christmas Paint Jobs DLC for completing the achievement Polar Express 2014 which involves covering the distance from SCS Software's office to the North Pole in-game. (Can be purchased from Steam.

trucksim,3aer6l,lol_awesome,13,Fri Jun 19 19:33:09 2015 UTC,"Early access as a concept needs to die by irradiation like the cancer it is. It belongs in the same  pile of shitty anti-consumer industry practices as the following:   Pre-orders - For a standard version of a game, pre-ordering makes no sense. The only exception I personally make to pre-ordering a game is with collector's editions, or what my brother calls ""collects-dust editions"", because they are usually limited run products, and come with extra swag (statues/figures, art books, soundtracks, behind-the-scenes DVDs, trinkets, etc), so they arguably are worth the extra cost if you're a fan of the franchise and a collector of dust-gathering objects.  Pre-order bonuses - Exclusive items depending on who you pre-order from. Ever see those special in-game items available only from a particular retailer? They exist to incentivize the consumer to purchase from that particular merchant.  Day-one DLCs - See the infamous Mass Effect 3 debacle where an arguably story-critical character was only available via DLC, and it was a day-one DLC that was already on the game disc but had to be paid for to ""unlock."" DLC spam (i.e. low quality, high quantity) content - Usually vanity items like skins or whatever. Instead of just releasing the core game and then working on a proper expansion pack (remember those?) we get this slop. Season passes - Where you're paying for something in advance while not even knowing the quality or type of product you're going to get. A blatant cash-grab if I ever saw one. Crowdfunding - Think about it. No professional venture capitalist, angel investor, or major publisher was willing to fund the project, so a developer turns to the consumer masses hoping to bank on their loyalty to a franchise or genre, and ask consumers to essentially be the venture capitalist without any of the benefit of seeing a return on investment that a professional investor would see. Instead, you assume all the risks, and experience none of the benefits. There are few exceptions, but more often than not, crowdfunded games leave the consumers that support them disappointed, or even worse, empty-handed.   Early access lets developers cash in on half-baked products that could very well end up flopping hard, giving the consumer very little, if any, recourse. And even though Steam has introduced a refund policy recently, this policy states that it will provide a full refund as long as you have owned the game less than two weeks and played less than two hours. I for one would not want to use my two hours of what is effectively demo time (remember those from the old days?) on an unfinished product. How  could you possibly make an accurate assessment on what is effectively an alpha or beta build of an unfinished product with the intent on deciding whether to claim a refund or not?  More information about the pitfalls of early access here if anyone cares to read: http://www.motdmedia.com/latest-news_articles/steam-adds-refunds-early-access-remains-breeding-ground-fraud  Or listen to what TotalBiscuit has to say on the matter (video from January 2014): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyGbbIB5eaM  I'm not saying SCS is likely to be like one of those scumbag outfits that just end up abandoning the project or delivering a sub-par product, but as consumers, lets not encourage companies and developers to persist in anti-consumer practices like early access. Let them deliver a finished product first. Consumers will reward them with truckloads (no pun intended) of money if the finished product deserves it.  EDIT: TotalBiscuit on the topic of pre-orders, also worth a listen:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mf5Uj4XIT1Y"
trucksim,3aer6l,VT_HMQ,1 point,Fri Jun 19 21:59:47 2015 UTC,"I can agree that Early Access is bad in many cases, but let's not pretend it is only bad. Early Access has helped bring life to a lot of great games by great developers. Minecraft would probably never be what it is today if it wasn't for early access. In cases where Early Access is done well (Space Engineers, Prison Architect, etc.) it is not affecting the game or consumer negatively.  I disagree strongly that Early Access should just die. However, I can agree that it needs some work to be better for the consumers when developers decide to abandon projects and not update their games. There should be some sort of contract the developers have to agree with that forces them to update their game regularely and finish it, and that consumers have the right to a refund if the developer doesn't finish it."
trucksim,3aer6l,Duck_Rubber,1 point,Sat Jun 20 03:02:51 2015 UTC,"Allow me to make a few clarifications:  Firstly, let's be honest, ""early access"" is just another form of crowdfunding that occurs after a project has entered the development phase. It's a mix of pre-ordering and crowdfunding rolled into a hype-generating package. You're essentially paying for alpha/beta access to a game, where traditionally, for big developers, they have been free closed/open beta phases for their games (Blizzard is a prime example of closed/open beta phases that are at no cost to the consumer).  I am not denying the benefit of early access or crowdfunding for niche titles, or those titles that would otherwise never see the light of day because they are considered too experimental, too innovative, or too ambitious for the likes of mainstream publishers to risk investing into their development. As an example, you only have to look as far as the record breaking crowdfunding made by CIG with their Star Citizen project. Nearly a million backers are banking on the hope that this game will blow our collective minds. Describing its scope as ""ambitious"" would be an understatement. Together with Elite:Dangerous and the upcoming No Man's Sky (both of which have also been crowdfunded to some extent), gamers are experiencing a renaissance in the space combat sim genre, which has been languishing for years. I'm glad that these opportunities exist and that projects like Star Citizen are possible, which are unfettered by the demands publishers place on developers for the sake of satisfying shareholder's desires for low risk/high reward products and business models that stifle innovation (which give us the umpteenth installment of CoD or Madden every year).  What I have a problem with is this precedent that has been set (by runaway hits like Minecraft) where early access and crowdfunding is becoming the status quo across the industry for any developer, big or small, to use as a way to fund their projects.   Just look at the wildly successful crowdfunding that was just announced during this past week's E3 that is being used to jumpstart the development of a game called Shenmue III. This is an established franchise whose first title was released in 1999, whose license is owned by Sega, and whose lead developer/producer, Yu Suzuki, is a former Sega employee (his wiki page describes him as ""Sega's answer to Nintendo's Shigeru Miyamoto"") that has since gone independent and is licensing Shenmue from Sega in order to develop the next installment in the franchise. While on the one hand I'm happy for the fans of this series, on the other, this is not a struggling indie developer trying to be the next Minecraft-esque success story or trying to be something innovative and ambitious in scope like Star Citizen or No Man's Sky.  Minecraft, as you mentioned, was a huge hit. It is the fairytale success story of indie game development, of one man quitting his day job to work full-time (thanks to the power of early access funding) to develop a game that in the end paid off big time, as in a capital B for billions of dollars, for its creator. But it is most certainly an extreme outlier. For every Minecraft, there are hundreds, if not thousands, of absolute duds out there. Failed projects that are poorly executed, managed, or made with the sole intent of outright defrauding the consumer, and not by some single person or industry newcomer. This has been done by full-fledged development studios and industry veterans with an established pedigree and notoriety in the industry. See Double Fine's Broken Age and Spacebase DF-9 or Keiji Inafune's Mighty No. 9. All of them cautionary tales if I ever heard one.  Crowdfunding and early access are now being used in place of marketing and market research to test the waters to see if there is consumer interest in a project by basically asking the consumer to put money up front before a product is even in development. Quite literally voting with your dollar. Traditional methods of funding a project, via VC or professional investors or publishers who expect a return on their investment has been supplanted by what this article on crowdfunding describes as ""an effective means of getting cash without giving equity."" Whether this is good or bad is debatable. In my opinion, it sounds too much like a way for unscrupulous individuals or organizations to take consumers for a ride. I'm sure you've heard the expression that a fool and his money are soon parted?   To get back on topic, looking at the context in which OP is asking SCS for early access: You know as well as I do that the OP is asking out of his eagerness to play the game, not because SCS is a struggling indie developer in need of alternative forms of funding. It almost sounds a little selfish, as in ""Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! I want to play right now!"" because they can't wait until later this year or whenever SCS plans to release the game. SCS is an established development studio, and while their catalog of games can be considered to have niche appeal, I'd argue they've experienced great success with titles like ETS2. Do they really need early access as a means of funding their projects?  I would argue that they do not. So what purpose would early access serve them or the consumer in this particular case?  In another post in this thread, you said:   Early Access is not the problem, bad developers are.   I would argue that both, in combination with each other, is bad all around because it can and has been abused. It is precisely the lack of rules and regulations in the early access system that cause undue risk to the consumer, making it too much of a gamble, at least for me personally, to accept it as a standard form of doing business with developers.  That old phrase, caveat emptor, bears repeating, now more than ever."
trucksim,3aer6l,VT_HMQ,1 point,Sat Jun 20 20:43:52 2015 UTC,"I definitely agree with you on pretty much everything. ATS isn't the best example of a game that needs Early Access, but I would still support SCS if they decided to do it. I was mostly getting at just how aggresive you seemed towards the concept of early access in your first comment.  I agree that it is a very flawed system as it stands today, and it has been abused several times. And it definetely should be more regulated to protect the consumer. My point was mostly that when early access is done right, it is benefitial for both developer and consumer. The developer gets extra money to develop the game, and the consumer gets to give feedback on the game as it is being developed. If the developer communicates well with the consumers, it can help the game become better."

The bugs and incompletion aren't even the biggest problems, imo it's that the game peaks out too early- sales and popularity and media will all hype right after release, the game will reach its peak then go boom and crash into the sea, devs might be like fk it we're not getting sales and go in standby mode, all those new states beside california they wanted to release after launch will suddenly take months as devs might move back to ets2 which is still popular or something.  early access is just shit and bad for everybody in the long run.

trucksim,3aer6l,Duck_Rubber,0,Sat Jun 20 01:03:49 2015 UTC,"Early Access is shit in a lot of cases, yes, but it because devs do a shit job. Look at games like Space Engineers and Prison Architect, they are good games (that are worth the money today) that constantly gets updates. DayZ is shit because the devs are doing a bad job at a bad game with a bad engine. As long as a dev has proven to be good with updating the game and listening to the community, Early Access doesn't affect the game negatively in any way.  If ATS went into early access, I would support it 100% because SCS have proven themselves to be fantastic developers and I trust them with my purchase. I trust that they will bring regular updates and develop the game properly.  Early Access is not the problem, bad developers are."

trucksim,3a42ga,sprayed150,2,Wed Jun 17 12:00:02 2015 UTC,I was really hoping for workshop support
trucksim,3a42ga,RashestHippo,1 point,Wed Jun 17 15:10:06 2015 UTC,Looks like the specs are the same at ets2. I'm happy about that.
trucksim,3a42ga,russelln,5,Wed Jun 17 13:24:04 2015 UTC,"Specs aren't final, I just copied the ETS2 specs, but things can change."
trucksim,3a42ga,TimmyCZ,1 point,Wed Jun 17 15:40:35 2015 UTC,"Ah well, I'm sure my PC can handle it either way."
trucksim,3a93p4,slagathor_zimblebob,4,Thu Jun 18 05:09:06 2015 UTC,"I use the exact same control setup, even the horn. What exactly are you having trouble with? The analog controls will be under the 'Controls' section of the options menu, and the rest horn, brake, throttle, will be under the 'Keyboard' section. Assuming you've installed a program that allows the PS3 controller to work on your PC.  Scroll down the 'Controls' menu and you'll see 'Steering axis'. Simply click on it and then move the left analog stick left or right and it will instantly recognize it. Same goes with view. Scroll down until you see 'Look up-down axis' and 'Look left-right axis'. Click on one and move the right analog stick in the direction it says."
trucksim,3a93p4,Vucey,1 point,Thu Jun 18 05:20:14 2015 UTC,"I connect the controller via Bluetooth and it appears in the control menu for me to set up. But the only thing it lets me set controls to are the analogs. I'm not talking about mapping my controller to keyboard buttons, but is that my only option? It lets me set up my PS3 controller, I think."
trucksim,3a93p4,Vucey,3,Thu Jun 18 05:27:05 2015 UTC,"So going into 'Keyboard', clicking on 'Throttle' and pressing R2 doesn't work?"
trucksim,3a93p4,Vucey,2,Thu Jun 18 05:30:01 2015 UTC,I understand it now. I was only tampering with joystick settings. Now that I know what to do I am so excited to start legitimately playing this game. It looks so good. Thanks a ton.

trucksim,3a8d60,Refstag,8,Thu Jun 18 01:02:24 2015 UTC,"Basically, it's a hugely immersive experience that forces you to think like a truck driver. It's extremely fun if you enjoy simulators and constantly changing worlds (the roads in the U.K look nothing like the roads in Holland) and scenery. You will adapt your driving to different weather conditions and can enjoy built-in internet radio for those long drives. This is a game you can sink hundreds of hours into and still not see it all. You can choose different jobs (as soon as you have your own truck, which is a milestone in itself) which enable you to travel the world (well, Europe) and see all the sights. An enjoyable thing for me is driving by my home town, Newcastle, and seeing how much detail they've put into the game. These aren't randomly generated towns, and highways, each are scaled down versions of their real life counterparts. You will see landmarks that you know to exist in real life, and most likely be amazed at the level of detail that's been put into the game."
trucksim,3a8d60,toomuchcocacola,1 point,Thu Jun 18 01:13:08 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the visual! Definitely pushing me closer, the game has now made its way in my cart. Does all that you just said still apply without the DLC in the game? I've heard a lot of good things about the DLC and I want to make sure that I'm still getting a good experience without the new additions."
trucksim,3a8d60,HeilHilter,5,Thu Jun 18 01:23:00 2015 UTC,"you don't ""need"" the dlc but the latest scandanvia one is amazingly beautiful and highly detailed. and the roads are fantastic"
trucksim,3a8d60,Strykerius,2,Thu Jun 18 02:03:23 2015 UTC,This.  I think the road between Bergen and Oslo is fantastic.
trucksim,3a8d60,toomuchcocacola,2,Thu Jun 18 02:47:52 2015 UTC,"From what I remember, This is the map size for ETS2 http://www.overclockers.com/forums/attachment.php?attachmentid=148043&d=1407625878  It's huge, and you need not buy the DLC before buying the game to spend more than 2 hours or so in real life driving between two locations. The DLC obviously just adds more locations to go to. I don't even have the DLC, and I keep going on about how massive the game actually is! Also, if you're into modding, then there are some amazing mods that enable you to drive to Iceland, and from what I can remember places like Portugal(?) but I could be wrong as I don't have them. However, without any mods/DLC the game is still completely massive and very, very well filled with life and landmarks to see to keep you entertained."

trucksim,3a8d60,Levy_Wilson,2,Thu Jun 18 01:13:15 2015 UTC,Every minute in game is 3 real world seconds. So it's still a long drive.
trucksim,3a8d60,bman_7,2,Thu Jun 18 01:15:18 2015 UTC,"Except cities, where the time slows down in those."
trucksim,3a8d60,mcShadesz,1 point,Thu Jun 18 01:55:41 2015 UTC,"It's all dependent on how fast your truck is going isn't it? You speed up, the game time moves faster so you can cover more distance faster. You slow down in the cities and the game time almost stops. This is why time is so screwy in ET2 Multiplayer."
trucksim,3a8d60,Strykerius,2,Thu Jun 18 03:59:22 2015 UTC,"No, in singleplayer there's 2 (or 3*) time speeds. One for in cities, and one for outside of cities. As far as I can tell, in multiplayer the time is always the city speed.  No matter how fast you're going the speed won't change.  *UK might have a different non-city speed, as the map scale is different there"

trucksim,3a37cj,TidusJames,2,Tue Jun 16 21:37:57 2015 UTC,"You are probably remember incorrectly. as it has always been broken. which is why I am really hoping they make proper transmission simulation, especially with american trucks because most american trucks still have old school non-synchronized transmissions. Meaning that to change gears you push clutch move form gear to neutral and let out clutch, match rpms of next/previous gear, then push in clutch and move to next gear and let out. except when using splitter, you just flip from low to high while in gear with throttle pressed, then you let off throttle and it will automatically split gear. quite complex compared to how SCS has it in ets2 where you can basically shift like a car besides the weird thing where you can move gear shifter from position to another and then pressing clutch like a button"
trucksim,3a37cj,HeilHilter,1 point,Wed Jun 17 02:01:54 2015 UTC,"In real life are most European cabovers autos? I noticed while playing ETS2 that I rarely see manual gear levers, despite playing with the manual box enabled in options."

trucksim,3a2qa1,WolfGuy100,3,Tue Jun 16 19:39:04 2015 UTC,"You should be able to do this fairly easily.    Assuming you're using the Steam version of ETS2, you'd need to revert the game to an earlier version as Promods with Scandinavia (I believe) only works on 1.17 and earlier - you can do this by right-clicking the game in your Steam library, going to Properties -> Beta and installing one of the ""temporary"" versions, probably the 1.17 one. You'll also have to remove the Scandinavian DLC which I believe you should be able to do by going to Properties -> DLC and de-selecting it from that list. Finally you'll need to download the earlier version of Promods from here.   I'm not sure if doing any of this will affect any saves you currently have, so you might want to backup any files you want to keep in case reverting to the earlier version or removing Scandinavia corrupts anything. Also I'm not 100% sure if this will work for you but, to the best of my knowledge, this is how I would go about doing what you're trying to do :)"

trucksim,3a06l2,spindoc,1 point,Tue Jun 16 05:32:03 2015 UTC,I didn't know ATS and the Oculus would be releasing around the same time. If the engine is going to be similar as ETS2 then the would make porting the mods relatively hassle free.

trucksim,39x222,martinjohnfdsa,5,Mon Jun 15 14:31:06 2015 UTC,"Where you buy your truck doesn't matter, you'll put it in the garage (which you already chose). Lots of people answered this already, so I'm going to move on to other stuff:  1) Try to get people working for you as soon as you can afford them. Buy the cheapest truck (~90k?) for them, as the game doesn't take the truck into account (AI can pull 40000 tons with a dirt bike :) ).   2) When you hire them, you can edit what skills they train when they level up. Put it to Long Distance. Getting a driver to full long distance = major money.  3) Same with your character, as you level, put into long distance. The time you take finding your cargo, picking it up, and getting out of the city (and then going into the destination city, finding the drop off point, and dropping it off) is a killer on your money making. If you take a long distance run, you're making serious money as you fly down the highway. <-- well you don't make money as you go, but the pay off at the end will be huge.  Pick a truck you like. For me, I went for the big Volvo because it hauls butt. Some people take a smaller truck for more challenge.  You can turn off things like fatigue (so you don't need to sleep), but some consider that cheating. Lots of options to turn on or off, like rain, and breaking sensitivity... so many options! Tune to your liking.  The game auto saves, so if you really screw  up you can always load an auto save (need to check the ""show autosaves"" box on the load screen to see them).  Pick a load you can handle (if your truck is small, 40 tonnes may not be possible or you won't get there in time). Accept that the AI will crash into you and you'll get blamed. And from time to time you'll take damage for no reason. This is ETS2, things happen, just roll with it!"

I think all the DLCs are pretty good, as was previously mentioned Poland can be a pain, and some of the parking jobs in Scandinavia can be challenging depending on what you're driving/hauling. The Scandinavia DLC is the prettiest, IMO.  If you like the game I would just get the bundle deal with all of em, as it adds more content and interesting/challenging locations."
trucksim,39rcez,Borsuq,2,Sun Jun 14 01:59:44 2015 UTC,"I can recommend the Eastern Europe expansion simply because these days it tends to be cheap.

trucksim,39k51v,VT_HMQ,1 point,Fri Jun 12 12:03:33 2015 UTC,"There was a thread last week on this sub that asked if the new wheels would have PC support, and I replied that Logitech would be stupid not to support PC, but now that they've revealed them, this branded wheel nonsense is just awful for the consumer.   First, why two wheels? People that have both consoles now have to look elsewhere for a universal solution. PC users can go with either one, but the PS-branded wheel seems to be more feature-rich, so why would a PC-exclusive user ever go with the XBOX-branded wheel? Second, the branding is prominent on both wheels. I don't know how licensing for this sorta thing works, but either Logitech paid both Sony and Microsoft a handsome sum or those two paid Logitech to have prominent branding displayed on each respective wheel. I'm thinking the latter, which makes Logitech seem greedy by appearing to ""double-dip"" by going with two separate wheels so they can charge fees to prominently display the brand logo on two different wheels. Sneaky bastards. Either way, money changed hands. A non-licensed, Logitech-branded, universal solution across all three major platforms would have been the most consumer friendly option, but I guess that notion is just fantasy these days. Third, the new shifter not being included in the package, and being made a secondary purchase, is a blatant cash-grab. Also, it's just a shifter! No buttons or anything else like on the G27, which is better by a country mile over these new offerings for that reason alone.   Overall the PS-branded wheel seems to have more features and buttons, so by that merit alone, it would be the better choice between these two new wheels. Which then just makes the XBOX-branded wheel, with its inferior feature set, seem like a consolation prize for those poor Microsoft plebs that just happen to play the ""wrong"" console.  Some marketing or brand licensing fuckery is afoot, and in the end, it seems the consumer is getting the raw end of the deal. Thankfully, I'm not in the market for a wheel. My G27 suits me just fine and has years of use ahead of it, and in light of this new product reveal, the G27 would be the only wheel I would recommend to anyone in the market for one. It's more bang for your buck because it's a non-branded/licensed product, that is a universal platform solution that is a complete package (wheel, pedals, shifter). Well, except for XBOX, which still gets left out in the cold here.  Also, did you notice? Logitech couldn't be bothered to accurately portray the new wheels in the ""Mounts Securely"" section of the product page for both the G29 and G920. It's a picture of the G27 with the shifter prominently displayed. Hilarious."
trucksim,39k51v,fizzer82,2,Fri Jun 12 13:15:05 2015 UTC,It's not logitech's fault entirely on having two separate wheels.  The console manufacturer's have implemented proprietary protocols that require licensing and branding of peripherals to use.  Here is a good read on the subject: http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-11-05-whats-the-deal-with-ps4-and-xbox-one-steering-wheels
trucksim,39k51v,VT_HMQ,1 point,Sat Jun 13 14:03:24 2015 UTC,"Thanks for sharing that link. Quite an interesting read. I suspected something like this. It's like how a couple years ago the EU passed a law that mandated all cellphone chargers follow a single industry standard (USB or something, I can't remember off-hand), because each manufacturer was making their own proprietary plug, causing waste and added expense when consumers switched phones.  As for the game consoles, these manufacturers (Sony/Microsoft) choose to intentionally lockdown their devices in this way, creating a walled-garden, in order to strong-arm third-party peripheral manufacturers to do as they say or get shut out of that potential consumer market. What a sham.  I think it just goes to show that the PC remains and will likely always be the most open platform, with the most flexibility. Also, I think it is for this reason that any serious sim enthusiast of racing, flight, or anything else, will be using PC as their primary platform."
trucksim,39k51v,skittishgibbon,1 point,Sun Jun 14 19:01:03 2015 UTC,Hopefully the introduction of these will drop the G27 a good bit as I have been looking to get one for a long time now.
trucksim,39k51v,VT_HMQ,1 point,Fri Jun 12 14:55:18 2015 UTC,"It's possible, for a time. It really depends on when Logitech stops production of the G27. When they do you'll see the price rise as supply begins to dwindle. Just look at prices for the G25 and you'll get the idea.  I had the same experience recently when buying a new hard disk for a laptop. Just for kicks, I looked up the original one, a 128GB model that is over 4 years old, which was actually still available for purchase, but for the whopping price of $250. I went with a 1TB model that cost only $75 instead. Supply and demand is funny like that, especially with consumer electronics and PC parts.  Your best bet to get a G27 on the cheap is to watch out for the occasional deep-discount sale from a merchant. There was one a couple months ago for something like $150-175 or something around there. The various deal-hunter subreddits will make posts for these kinda sales when they happen.  EDIT: Looked up my old posts to give you some examples of what I'm talking about:  http://www.reddit.com/r/trucksim/comments/32zk6p/g25_or_g27/cqg7oco  http://www.reddit.com/r/trucksim/comments/31z8dy/xpost_from_rbuildapcsalesotherlogitech_g27_pc/"
trucksim,39k51v,skittishgibbon,1 point,Fri Jun 12 15:40:30 2015 UTC,I am thinking something like the first week of release we might see the best prices.

trucksim,39k51v,thecrazydemoman,1 point,Fri Jun 12 16:25:45 2015 UTC,Fanatec GT3   Once you add the shifter the price isn't much better. The T300 has no clutch so i don't see a ton of point in using it.

trucksim,392xhu,Holiace,8,Mon Jun 8 21:52:23 2015 UTC,"If they are going for realism then they will more than likely have to change the way manual transmissions work anyway in ATS compared to Euro truck.   Due to American trucks not having synchronized gears like European trucks. Thus why you can switch gears from first to second without having to wait and lower your RPMs to prevent the gears from grinding in Euro truck, where as american manual transmissions on tractors require an RPM match to get easily into gear.  Edit: I was told Europe's tractor-trailers are mostly synchronized Also: fixed spelling"

The rest were and are still fully synchronized.  Also, are most American trucks (new ones) still running unsynchronized gearboxes?"
trucksim,392xhu,PhantomPhun,4,Mon Jun 8 22:43:18 2015 UTC,Yes most are unsynchronized other than automatics which I'm not sure about. Most trucks on the road right now in america are standard 10/13 speed unsynchronized transmissions but companies are updating their fleets and most are converting over to automatics due to driver shortage and rumoured fuel economy benifits of the autos.   I will stick with the 18speed Eaton Fuller tho I feel much more in control than the new automatic freightliner I was allowed to drive in school. Not to mention being able to go down half a gear sure makes it easy with small hills.
trucksim,392xhu,DR_JDUBZ,3,Mon Jun 8 22:50:04 2015 UTC,"American trucks use unsynchronized gears, requiring you to match the RPM yourself when you change gears.  where as European have synchronized like most manual automobiles do. Slide from one gear to another and the transmission should already be in the correct speed for that gear."
trucksim,392xhu,Circlejerk_Level_900,3,Mon Jun 8 22:44:09 2015 UTC,Many american trucks come with slushboxes too. I drive nonsynchromesh and enjoy it more than any other transmission. The ONLY thing euro trucks have over american trucks is disc brakes.

If they scale it so that the game worlds are the same size, I imagine that only western states will ever be added, as it would take a while to make that large of areas, and most people won't want to drive around in the midwest on that scale; driving from eastern Colorado to the border of Ohio is the same distance as going from Paris to the Ukraine."

Here's the mod:   Here I showcase the lovely VNL which I've been using for a while and have fallen in love with.  For those interested, the VNL is one of these two:  Volvo VNL v0.5 by au44  Volov VNL 780 by kreichbaum  I currently have both those mods active, and am unsure which is the actual truck.

In addition, Humble Bundle has Pay-What-You-Want game bundles every week. Minimum amount is 1$, but part of it goes to charity, so you might want to consider paying more. You get to decide what fraction goes to the developer, the humble store and charity.  GoG doesn't have many simulator games, no ETS2 and Spintires. Instead they stock mostly older and indy games, and of course their own Witcher series. Their thing is the No DRM policy. None of the games they sell has DRM, - you can back up, uninstall and reinstall as many times and where ever you want. They have a sale going right now."

trucksim,38s6qf,random352486,-1,Sat Jun 6 10:48:10 2015 UTC,Stupid standard question: Did you try installing the drivers for the wheel from the manufacturers website?
trucksim,38mecf,The-Wandering-Hylotl,12,Fri Jun 5 03:51:44 2015 UTC,"pick your headquarters as luxembourg.  Lots of nearby cities in france, belgium, netherlands and germany. plus as the only garage in that country, it's nice and easy to get your first achievement (assuming steam)."
trucksim,38mecf,rhedgehog,8,Fri Jun 5 09:36:33 2015 UTC,"I like the controller over the keyboard for driving (wheel is best but I can't use mine atm).  You need to adjust the steering (from my experience) to be fairly sensitive but not maxed out. My button layout is:   Accelerate: RT Brake/Exhaust Brake: LT Blinkers: L/RB Highbeams: B Cruise Control Set: X Interact: A Disengage/hook up Trailer: Y Menu: Start Change Camera: Back Steering: Left Stick Camera rotation: Right Stick Horn: Right Stick (Click)  D-PAD:  Headlight Mode: Left Wipers: Right Emergency Lights (4 ways): Up  As for tips - Just general driving tips is that you're pulling a long trailer so in general you need to take turns wider, and pull ahead a bit longer before straightening on the corners. Also traffic does respond to signal/emergency blinkers so make sure to use them.  Since you're just starting out, you can do some quick jobs with different makes of truck to see which one you like the best. If you're new to the game it'd be wise to make your headquarters in a location that has many nearby cities, as for a while you might not have enough Long Distance levels to reach other places."
trucksim,38mecf,Avengerr,5,Fri Jun 5 05:16:17 2015 UTC,I'll just add that they also need to change the controller type to gamepad/joystick instead of wheel if they're using a gamepad/joystick.
trucksim,38mecf,Finrow,2,Fri Jun 5 06:15:16 2015 UTC,Is there anyway I can adjust the sensitivity? If I even breath on the stick I take a hard turn across multiple lanes of traffic
trucksim,38mecf,CepteonEutenburj,2,Fri Jun 5 15:36:31 2015 UTC,"Go into options and select Controls. You'll be wanting to adjust the steering sensitivity and steering non-linearity sliders.   Sensitivity refers to how fast the wheel will turn when you tilt the stick. Non-linearity refers to how fast the wheel will react to your inputs; a high non-linearity means the wheel will react slowly, allowing you to make more precise manoeuvres.   I have an Xbox 360 controller and I can post my slider settings when I get home so you can try it out; it's a mix of being able to quickly turn the wheel in cities for those tight turns and precise turns on the highways so that you don't oversteer.  Mind you, I adjusted these settings while driving a DAF Euro 6 with a 4x2 chassis, so using them with other trucks and chassis might yield different results!"

I believe (but I may be wrong) that the maximum bank loan will set you back around 4 grand a day. But you should be able to make that up yourself with jobs easily, with lots of money to spare for repairs. So don't stress about getting a bank loan.  As early as you can, get drivers. Buy them the cheapest truck in the game - the Iveco Stralis. It'll set you back around 70 grand, and is a terrible, terrible truck for YOU to drive - but not for AI. You see, AI don't struggle up hills with an underpowered truck, but you will - especially when you start adding mods with 70tonne trailers... but I digress. So for ALL of your drivers, buy them the cheapest truck, which will help your bank balance.

trucksim,38mg4g,mazdarati2,5,Fri Jun 5 09:53:11 2015 UTC,"You should wait until E3 later this month, which is when more information should become available from Logitech on the G29. From the few articles I skimmed by googling for ""logitech G29,"" it's mostly pure speculation, with the line ""According to their 'sources close to Logitech'"", which really just smacks of FUD. Nobody knows shit except for Logitech.  I find it incredibly dubious for a company like Logitech, that is in the business of making peripherals, to pigeon-hole themselves with the next iteration of their driving wheel line to not just the console market, but to just one specific brand of console (Playstation).  Think about it. USB is the standard interface for these peripherals, not some proprietary plug. Consoles these days are just branded PCs with a locked hardware spec. USB is the standard peripheral interface across all platforms. I find it highly unlikely that Logitech would handicap themselves from a business standpoint to only provide a new product their bringing to market to just one particular platform. If they do, then they're idiots, and I'm saying this as a consumer who exclusively buys Logitech for all my peripherals (mice, keyboards, joystick, wheel, webcam, you name it, etc).  I would take a wait-and-see approach to this one, and once we know more than rumors, make you decision on which product to purchase. You never know, they might announce a completely separate wheel for all other non-Sony Playstation platforms. Worst case scenario, you get yourself a G27, which is still by all accounts, a kickass wheel."

trucksim,38exjy,Dartvoider,1 point,Wed Jun 3 22:39:51 2015 UTC,"And here I thought it was just me. I use to be able to run the game with decent frames on 100% resolution, now I'm down to 50%, and when I turn my headlights on at night, or come up to a tunnel, it gets to be nearly unplayable. That's the biggest issue I have, since I never noticed any frame drops in the past when turning on my headlights. However, this could be attributed to upgrading to Windows 8 from 7, but I doubt it since Windows 8 is supposedly lower on resources.  I have an older gaming laptop from 2007 with pretty low specs compared to PC's these days, but I know from experience that I was able to play the game on low at 100% rendering at 1280x720 before at around 30-50 frames depending on where I am prior to 1.17."
trucksim,38exjy,LeLoyon,2,Thu Jun 4 02:56:07 2015 UTC,"Windows 8 increases performance actually, Windows 7 had some mad memory leaks. Anyway, I've got a great setup and in cities I drop to 23 fps...and before I used to run at 144 all the time with some dips to 80. The game just suddenly only uses 20% of your gpu for no reason and the thing is I'm not even sure SCS knows about it..."
trucksim,38exjy,TheCarWashChannel,1 point,Thu Jun 4 03:25:38 2015 UTC,"That's what I've heard, and that's one of the main reasons why I upgraded. I didn't think it would be an issue.

trucksim,38exjy,Dartvoider,1 point,Thu Jun 4 03:56:20 2015 UTC,"I suppose you're right. I play it for the realism myself. I mean, as much realism as the game currently provides because let's face it, there's still some things that could be added to improve that. Like, Jackknifing for example.   However, these framedrops can definitely ruin the feel of the game as it sits. Normally I can be quite tolerable of it, but it really depends on the game. I can play say, Guild Wars 2 with 15-50 frames for instance, but the choppiness in ETS2 just takes away from the experience. I know that we're probably a minority, maybe people just aren't having the performance issues that we currently have, but that doesn't mean they're nonexistent. They may as well be though, since nobody ever speaks up about it."

trucksim,38exjy,TheCarWashChannel,1 point,Thu Jun 4 04:09:28 2015 UTC,"Jackknifing:       Jackknifing means the folding of an articulated vehicle i.e. one towing a trailer, such that it resembles the acute angle of a folding pocket knife. If a vehicle towing a trailer skids, the trailer can push from behind until it spins around and faces backwards. This may be caused by equipment failure, improper braking, or adverse road conditions such as an icy road surface. In extreme circumstances, a driver may attempt to jackknife the vehicle deliberately in order to halt it following brake failure.

And this is with everything maxed out at 1080p, and with 100% scaling.  As far as I'm concerned, one let alone two 290Xs should easily be able to chew through this game, yet I can't maintain a good framerate. Lately, I've been more in the low 20s.

This is also designed to a purpose, which is driver comfort. Unlike on a sports car, you are not trying to minimize size or weight here, so you have much more flexibility to design it to be comfortable.  Don't get me wrong, I too would hate to drive this but not for comfort... To me it would just have dreadful visibility.

trucksim,37yf09,tgp1994,1 point,Mon Jun 1 02:33:37 2015 UTC,"Question for steering wheel users - does anyone have a wheel where +/- 45 degrees of turning get really jerky? Essentially at highway speeds, when you only need to make small, gradual, adjustments, the input shows up as very sensitive/jerky, with the game wheel jumping around 10 degrees at times. I have a Logitech NASCAR driving wheel, but has anyone seen this issue before?"
trucksim,37yf09,Astec123,2,Sun May 31 17:17:43 2015 UTC,I have a DFGT so 900degree turning but I find depending what I use that messing with the settings as detailed in this video get the experience I want depending on if I'm fooling around with the wheel or a joypad.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cFvA9c3U_0  I have to admit that I'm glad I have one with such a large range as you can be very precise when parking etc and it feels very real. Sadly it's a pain to set it up to play so it gets used rarely.
trucksim,37yf09,emersonlakeandlagoon,1 point,Sun May 31 17:24:28 2015 UTC,Yes!  Anything more than about 25 degrees of turn causes the truck's wheel to spin around in circles.  I have a lot more trouble parking in the game than I did in an actual truck.  It's very difficult to do turns within the cities.  I always have to stop and wait for the wheel to catch up the other way and back and forth.  I use a DFGT.  It would be awesome if the game's steering wheel matched the actual steering wheel.
trucksim,37yf09,tgp1994,1 point,Mon Jun 1 00:53:43 2015 UTC,"Have you tried adjusting the sensitivity slider? I've found that tends to help with steering ""lag""."
trucksim,37yf09,emersonlakeandlagoon,1 point,Mon Jun 1 02:04:33 2015 UTC,Yes. I have sensitivity all the way to the right and non linearity all the way left. I just tried then out again and changing those settings makes it undrivable. The twitchiness is just insane.

However, I have seen posts on this subreddit by folks that do drive trucks for a living and then also play ETS2. Maybe they really love trucking?  Remember, this is a simulator. A way for people who are not in any type of freight/transportation industry in real life to experience what it might be like.  Same goes for flight sims, racing sims, etc. Not everyone grows up to be a commercial airline pilot, fighter pilot, or a Formula 1 race car driver, right?  ETS2 in particular is actually a very relaxing game, compared to most all other games, which have a competitive element as their central theme. It's almost zen-like, in that you can just drive and enjoy the sights as you listen to music or your favorite podcast or audiobook. Hell, I've even played the game while on long conference calls for work."
trucksim,37x70v,Finrow,6,Sun May 31 03:41:33 2015 UTC,Wow the restaurant model looks really well made. Glad SCS decided to go all out on this DLC. If only they could do the same for the rest of the map.
trucksim,37x70v,FSJZ,2,Sun May 31 04:28:08 2015 UTC,"It's a real shame because IIRC the last update they did to the base map was adding in Venezia, Italy, Klagenfurt am Wörthersee, Austria and Graz, Austria.  It would liven up the areas which I believe are more frequented. Then again that's why we have map mods, but some of them may not be SCS quality."
trucksim,37x70v,SomeRandomMax,1 point,Sun May 31 04:51:15 2015 UTC,"If I were SCS, I would do smaller monthly additions n the main map, and to build anticipation for each addition, have the roads around the new addition be full of construction and occasionally (when there is a reasonable alternate route) detours. It would add so much realism to the game, not to mention adding new content."
trucksim,37x70v,SomeRandomMax,1 point,Mon Jun 1 04:58:53 2015 UTC,"That's actually not a bad idea, though I would see a problem with SCS having to add and remove the construction sites every update.

trucksim,37z00h,Astec123,3,Sun May 31 17:30:46 2015 UTC,Go into Windows controller settings in the control panel for the wheel.  Should look a little like this - http://www.filecluster.com/howto/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Game-Controller-Test.png  Test that both pedal are being detected as an analogue inputs. If they just appear as on/off buttons it means one of 2 things   The pedals are not analogue and will be either on or off with no range in between those values  The drivers are not working.    If it's the latter try un-installing the drivers and starting again. Failing that try to locate some working drivers for the wheel.
trucksim,37z00h,djfil007,2,Sun May 31 17:36:07 2015 UTC,"Found this manual with a google search for ""zheng dian racing wheel"" (as seen in your picture referenced).  It sounds like these pedals are mapped to Square and Cross when used with a PlayStation controller.  That means it's a digital button, not an analog axis.  It's either on or off, no real throttle/brake control.  Kinda sad if that's your situation, I feel for you.  The analog switch appears to be related to PlayStation support... back in the days when controllers had a button to enable/disable the analog sticks.  Haven't looked at it... but maybe there's adjustments you can make within ETS so that the acceleration is more gradual with the button press... but that still wouldn't be optimal."

Then run the input wizard and make sure no steering controls are bound to the keyboard. After I flipped a few trucks because the wheel went full lock after a few hundred degrees I used the above method and it works like a charm.
trucksim,37i73t,stikshift,1 point,Thu May 28 14:01:39 2015 UTC,"Is the wheel set to 900° or 180°? This might not work, but at least for the DFP, if you hit R2, R3, and select simultaneously, the wheel will unlock to 900°."
trucksim,37i3vj,sprayed150,4,Wed May 27 20:18:10 2015 UTC,That gets more into a general warehousing or shipping and receiving or logistics sim. Still would be amazingly awesome (Farming Simulator could probably do it if their maps were bigger)
trucksim,37i3vj,kamishizuka,5,Wed May 27 23:21:52 2015 UTC,"my whole thought is that OTR trucking is all logistics. max amount of stuff you can carry while being under your weight limits and all that.   it wouldnt have to be super complex. when you book a load it would say it takes up 15 units of space, your trailer hold 20, so you find another load thats 5 units and grab both going to the same town. simple as that"
trucksim,37i3vj,VT_HMQ,1 point,Wed May 27 23:40:07 2015 UTC,"To answer the question in your title, no, you're not the only one.   The company/employee/garage aspect of ETS2 seems like an afterthought because it wasn't ever fully fleshed out. It feels like something they tacked on at the end, as it's really not a fundamental aspect of the game (i.e. being a truck driving simulator). Sure, if you're just starting out, it gives you something to work towards after purchasing your first truck and switching from quick jobs to freight jobs. Once you do start expanding via garage purchases and hiring drivers, financial critical mass is reached in relatively short order, where the currency loses it's value (to almost zero) because you have so much of it, and nowhere to spend it, or even a need to spend it. I've been playing off and on since the game launched in 2012. I'm level 65 with nearly 150m banked, and there's nothing I can do with it. I've bought all the garages in the game, but there's really no point in stocking them with trucks/drivers. It's a bit unfortunate, because anyone that has spent even a moderate amount of time playing ETS2 sees the potential of this aspect of the game, as your OP demonstrates, but it remains untapped.  There are a lot of ideas out there, even concepts or mechanics taken from other games, that if added to ETS2 or a game like it, would take it from being just a basic truck sim to a full blown logistics and company management simulator. Here's a few I've had:   Managing your own trailers, and having to load/unload cargo, whether it be a forklift, or operating a crane, or even those huge container cranes at shipping docks. Having to pay consideration to weight distribution, capacity, carrying capacity, etc (as you described) would turn that into a mini-game of sorts. With the ability to load and potentially overload your cargo for the hope of more profit per trip, weigh stations become relevant and could add another simulation element to the game. I'm not sure how it would be implemented/enforced. The first idea that comes to mind is more fines, but those become meaningless after you get even a little extra cash. So you're overloaded, do they fine you? Revoke your license? What is the penalty for going over capacity? In a similar vein, I eventually disabled the police (speed cameras) via admin console because I just got tired of hearing the stupid sound effect, nevermind the fact that every speed camera warning sign is followed by a speed camera literally 2-3 truck lengths away, which most of the time isn't enough time to slow down to avoid the fine. It really feels like a lame ""gotcha."" Fines, overall, are meaningless in ETS2 once you've got the cash to cover that ""operating expense."" Precision fifth wheel coupling, even if it's a simulated top-down view that pops up on your screen when you approach the trailer. This would be a mini-game of sorts where you have to correctly line up the trailer's king pin with the fifth wheel before you can actually hit ""T"" to attach the trailer. It would be the exact same concept as manually parking a trailer which exists in the game today. You line up the object with the target, and once you move it within acceptable range the target turns green and you can interact with it.   You get the idea. It's like we all want a game with a combination of features from various games. ETS2 driving, with cargo loading level of detail like loading logs in Spintires, plus the management aspects of Farming Simulator, and so on. I'm not expecting ATS to make that pipe dream come true. It'll be another fun game to play, I'm sure, but it will be a truck driving sim, first and foremost, just with an updated graphics engine set in a new locale."

trucksim,37hnwt,djfil007,3,Wed May 27 18:33:00 2015 UTC,"Back when I was looking into it, in 2012, I dabbled with the free solutions first before putting down the cash for a TrackIR 5. There are a lot of games that support it. Aside from ETS2, I've used it in Star Citizen, Elite:Dangerous, and DCS AC-10 Warthog.  As far as the free solutions, the most common drawback/complaint is that it utilizes your webcam, and those devices usually don't update (i.e. scan) as fast, so the headtracking may seem sluggish. Configuring the software can be a bit confusing at first, but with enough testing and a little time you should be able to tweak it to work well enough in any game that supports head tracking.  That said, TrackIR 5 is pretty much the premier off-the-shelf solution for head tracking. My only complaint over the years is the TrackClip Pro (which is a separate purchase of about $30, so add that to your total cost) is a rather delicate piece of plastic. Well, delicate in the sense that it might take some damage if you're an idiot and drop your headset accidentally or it slips off the desk or whatever. I've had two such fumbles, and it's still working, but it broke in two joints on each fall. Mine is currently being held together with duct tape and a rubberband around the clip end, because that got a little loose over the years. It would have been fine if I didn't drop it, but accidents happen. I found myself wishing it was metal though.  Anyway, with all that said, for 180CAD, or even 150US, I would just go with a free headtracking solution and bide your time for the retail release of full VR headsets, either from Oculus or the HTC Vive (which Valve is involved with). These are coming out very soon, with I think Oculus slated for early 2016. If you start a budget now, for a little bit more cash, you can have a fully immersive VR headset. The Oculus Rift retail price hasn't been released yet, but the devkit is around $350. No word at all on the HTC Vive, but they do say it will be a bit higher.  I'm debating myself whether to be an early adopter of the first retail release or wait for the next revision. I'm not basing my purchase off devkit performance. I only care about retail models. As with all consumer electronics (I'm looking at you Apple), being an early adopter usually comes with its own set of problems/risks. I may get a first gen retail version if the reviews are good.   Time is on our side, either way, so long as you're patient."
trucksim,37hnwt,VT_HMQ,2,Thu May 28 00:00:25 2015 UTC,"thanks for the feedback.  thanks for the info about the trackir vs free (webcam) options.  will give the free option a chance, but the lag is something i'll be on the look out for.  i personally have almost no interest in a vr headset.  i don't really want something strapped on my head an inch or two from my eyes for extended periods of time.  i know a friend or two who will get them, so i'll have a chance to try them... but i am skeptical going in... time will tell."

And yeah, the whole fatigue thing is an unknown to me right now. What does it feel like to have a brick hanging off the front of your face? Ok, I'm exaggerating. I'm sure it won't be that heavy.

The dash is very nice and the truck's a beauty. I have to say though I don't really like the transmission retarder on it though. It doesn't have nearly as much power to slow you down as other trucks. As an example I typically only use 2 ticks of it to slow down for a corner in the Volvo but I'll need 4 or 5 in this truck to slow down the same amount.

The population will rise and housing will get more expensive.   I like living above Portland, if I ever want to get something expensive (that I didn't purchase online for a cheaper price than any of the stores near by) then I would go down to Portland and pick up it and not worry about tax.

trucksim,3781uk,sithyeti,2,Tue May 26 00:58:57 2015 UTC,"That's true, several times e-stopping on the shoulder with blinkers has been my only option... I bet the hardcore gamers with IBS would just have a bucket on hand at all times :P"
trucksim,3781uk,rizlah,2,Tue May 26 01:01:09 2015 UTC,"Bud, I have something very similar to ibs, but mine is due to injuries sustained a while back. I have to stop more than most to take care of business, but I always get the job done on time. Best job in the world if ya ask me. I couldn't sit behind a desk."
trucksim,3781uk,Pielikey,7,Tue May 26 03:50:40 2015 UTC,"It seems weird to me, I would have thought it's the last thing you'd want to do when you get home, unless it's playing something like GTA to satisfy any urges to mow down pedestrians.   Like I assume professional chefs order a lot of pizza so they don't have to cook, baristas mostly drink tea at home and probably all gynecologists are gay..."
trucksim,3781uk,thibit,3,Mon May 25 22:26:09 2015 UTC,Professional chefs cook real food.
trucksim,3781uk,Barleycorn,5,Mon May 25 22:49:52 2015 UTC,"I am a ""real"" trucker and do play this game a lot. :)"
trucksim,3781uk,emersonlakeandlagoon,2,Mon May 25 21:34:12 2015 UTC,"I drive semis local for a living and used to play. I played it tons before I got my cdl but I don't have a wheel and after driving the real thing I just can't play the game until I get a wheel, too weird with a controller."
trucksim,3781uk,tuck1395,2,Tue May 26 00:56:43 2015 UTC,42? (-hundred?)  a lot. i could name three at least and i'm not even actively playing the game any more.
trucksim,3781uk,BalooUriza,2,Mon May 25 19:48:51 2015 UTC,"I drive buses, although they're not huge (closer to passenger vans or short-buses than fullsize city buses)"
trucksim,3781uk,tuck1395,2,Mon May 25 21:55:30 2015 UTC,"I play it off and on and also drive a DOT (10k+ lb GWVR) van.  The amazing part of how realistic it is, is that I picked it up after a month of absence (due to transitioning to DOT vehicles full-time, amongst others) and found that I drove better in-game than before...  It certainly has been one of the reasons why I desire to move to tractor trailers. :)"
trucksim,3781uk,Janamil,2,Mon May 25 22:25:48 2015 UTC,I switch trailers around with a spotter truck.. nothing on the road though
trucksim,3781uk,Janamil,1 point,Mon May 25 22:26:42 2015 UTC,"I used to, and went back to school.  I went to Germany in high school so part of the appeal of ETS2 for me is driving over there."
trucksim,3781uk,nutbeat,1 point,Tue May 26 04:15:46 2015 UTC,"Well, I got my commercial license, but I haven't gotten a driving job yet because I'm not 21.    Stupid federal regulations.   DAMN THE DOT!"
trucksim,3781uk,HotelMagnum,3,Tue May 26 04:23:28 2015 UTC,"Bud, you'll be saying that last bit even after your 21."
trucksim,3781uk,Jollywog,1 point,Tue May 26 04:26:28 2015 UTC,"Can still do in-state jobs, and there's a lot of those around (at least in Oklahoma)."
trucksim,37ccng,Robviguurs,6,Tue May 26 16:16:16 2015 UTC,Never heard of him; elaborate please?
trucksim,377yn9,razw19,3,Mon May 25 16:54:20 2015 UTC,The driving... was bad :)  Thanks for the vid.
trucksim,377yn9,distantreach,3,Mon May 25 17:30:33 2015 UTC,"Like the other guy said, I wouldn't rate your driving 10/10 either, but keep the videos coming!"
trucksim,377yn9,Darkfizch,2,Mon May 25 17:36:11 2015 UTC,"Your ""commentary"" made it just worse. But it was quite funny watching bad drivers."
trucksim,376rc4,Alexcadrill,5,Mon May 25 09:52:05 2015 UTC,I found that with lift axles on the heavy loads they are impossible to steer without raising them.
trucksim,376rc4,stone1555,2,Mon May 25 14:12:20 2015 UTC,That is the point of lift axles though
trucksim,376rc4,Aleroniponi,1 point,Mon May 25 15:15:34 2015 UTC,"Yea, I understand that. Seem's like a physics issue."
trucksim,376rc4,stone1555,1 point,Mon May 25 15:33:07 2015 UTC,"Not trying to argue here, but your saying the issue is that a fulcrum with more weight on one side should be balanced?"
trucksim,376rc4,Aleroniponi,1 point,Mon May 25 17:00:26 2015 UTC,"All I'm saying is with a 6x4 and a heavy load now, the trucks wont turn with the drop axles down."
trucksim,376rc4,stone1555,1 point,Mon May 25 23:04:00 2015 UTC,I see
trucksim,376rc4,Aleroniponi,2,Tue May 26 00:45:15 2015 UTC,"It's a real issue for sure, my friend also has it. We have almost same mods installed but I was able to take those loads with no problems whatsoever. We discovered that the Realistic Physics Mod, that I had installed, somehow fixes this weird issue."
trucksim,376rc4,Little-Helper,2,Mon May 25 12:51:34 2015 UTC,I think I tried the Realistic Physics Mod before so I'll give it another go now to see if it works. Does that version of the mod you linked still work on 1.18?
trucksim,376rc4,Little-Helper,2,Mon May 25 13:16:36 2015 UTC,It does. :)
trucksim,376rc4,Little-Helper,2,Mon May 25 14:05:23 2015 UTC,"Tried it, doesn't seem to have any effect for me :("
trucksim,376rc4,joeyfjj,1 point,Mon May 25 14:23:55 2015 UTC,Dang it!
trucksim,376rc4,DigitalX19901,2,Mon May 25 14:40:42 2015 UTC,I'm noticing more understeer with vanilla 20t trailers when driving my MAN TGX 6x4. Appears the physics were updated.
trucksim,376rc4,Avengerr,1 point,Mon May 25 19:59:25 2015 UTC,Is the front of the truck lifting up? I had an old Kamaz with the Baobab tree and it would push the front of the truck upwards off the ground so I couldn't steer.
trucksim,376rc4,Bluecat16,1 point,Mon May 25 11:46:04 2015 UTC,I thought this might have been the problem but I've just had another look at it's not. This picture was taken with my foot down and the wheel all the way to left - the front is still on the ground but the truck isn't going left at all. Thanks for the suggestion though.
trucksim,376rc4,borrokalari,1 point,Mon May 25 13:15:13 2015 UTC,"I had this same problem with my Scania T with a taglift. Since it's the long chassis, it has a huge turn radius so the taglift helps it steer when it's loaded. However because the hitch is inbetween the lift axle and the first set of powered axles, I NEED the lift axle lowered when the truck takes a load or else the front wheels will lift off the ground."
trucksim,376rc4,fizzer82,1 point,Mon May 25 20:46:58 2015 UTC,"So it seems I've found a solution by changing my chassis to a 4x2. Surely there shouldn't be a problem with the 6x2, though? I'm not an expert on this sort of thing but I can't imagine having a 6x4 would make that much of a difference to the point where you can't even turn the truck."
trucksim,376rc4,XJadynX,1 point,Mon May 25 14:36:24 2015 UTC,"I noticed this sort of issue when using Ohaha's Volvo mod (great truck btw). I was originally using the 2 front axles and 2 read axles configuration and had this issue. When I switched to the single front and triple back, it fixed the issue.  The issue to me appears actually be to the fact that the back of the truck is hitting the load, and unable for turn anymore. Have you noticed this at all?"
trucksim,376rc4,XJadynX,1 point,Thu May 28 05:54:59 2015 UTC,I had the same problem with a 50t train and my Kenworth T800.
