medlabprofessionals,3e53mh,enhydralutriss,5,Wed Jul 22 00:52:35 2015 UTC,"I just started not that long ago in a rather somewhat large hospital.     My days tend to vary depending on what department I'm working in, but I usually start out on daily maintenance and QC, followed by standard running tests/answering the phone/random troubleshooting anything that pops up, and finally cleaning up and passing my department off to the next shift of techs. I love my job!  I get to be part of a vital (and often forgotten about) area of medicine in a more behind the scenes setting.  The pay can be pretty decent depending where you live and in some places what degree you have.  This job also allows for a bit of freedom in that my manager tends to let us do our work without constantly checking up on any of us. This job can be a bit stressful at times.  You will find many people outside of the lab tend to look down on you.  These people are not in the majority, but it can be a bit shitty when you have someone call in and demand lab results from a patient who has only just arrived in the lab, and then berate you for not having it.  This has only happened to me once, but I have been told it happens and used to be much more frequent, but either way I just let it roll off my shoulders. The Board of Certification exam given by the ASCP is usually the only exam you need to pass, however, some other states require an additional certificate (California is one I believe).  Once you pass the BOC you are then certified to work nationwide.  You do need to maintain your certification by getting a certain amount of Continuing Education Credits every three years. Currently I work about 40 hours a week.  Right now I work 7-3 M-F, but I may soon move to the 2-10 night shift.  The hours really depend on where you work and what position you get hired onto. Kind of answered in #3, but I would compare the stress level to that of being a cook in a restaurant, but far more rewarding/less exhausting.   I hope this help a little bit."
medlabprofessionals,3e53mh,Kamikaze_Model_Plane,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:15:52 2015 UTC,"Thanks so much for your reply, that really helped a lot. I have more questions for you! I hope you don't mind me asking them.  Have you had any experience in a reference lab? Do you like working in a big hospital verses other places you've had experience in?   Also, do you feel you're an introvert or extrovert? Is there a lot of talking involved with this profession? (Being an introvert myself, I'm more concerned about small talk.)  Thanks again for all your help, I really appreciate it."
medlabprofessionals,3e53mh,Kamikaze_Model_Plane,1 point,Wed Jul 22 14:16:33 2015 UTC,"I definitely prefer a larger hospital.  I worked in a small 15 bed one as part of my clinical rotation, and while I liked the more intimate environment I much prefer the workload that comes with a larger hospital.    I find myself to be more introverted at times but haven't had a problem adjusting to talking to people here.   Most small talk will be between coworkers and usually is easiest getting comfortable talking to them pretty quick.   Phone calls were something I had to acclimate to, but the more you work the easier they get once you realize most of them are mundane."
medlabprofessionals,3e53mh,Kamikaze_Model_Plane,1 point,Wed Jul 22 15:07:07 2015 UTC,"What's the difference between the workloads?   Yeah I am a bit afraid to do the phonecalls, but I think that's something I can adjust to after doing it a few times. What do you normally talk about when taking or making a phonecall? And are you in contact with the doctors/nurses a lot?"
medlabprofessionals,3e53mh,pg13wodehouse,1 point,Wed Jul 22 15:16:52 2015 UTC,At a larger hospital you usually get samples all day whereas at a smaller one you'll get you're morning draws then it tends to slow way down.  Usually it's just nurses with questions on tests or sample requirements.  Where I work I rarely talk to a doctor but you will more at a smaller one or a clinic.
medlabprofessionals,3e53mh,lablizard,1 point,Wed Jul 22 15:49:52 2015 UTC,"Day-in-the-life of Automated Chem:   Come in, say hello to the other techs. Some are cool, some pretend they didn't hear you and look down or away awkwardly. Run QC, often end up re-running QC, get everything set-up. From there I'm seated for 50% of the time resulting, and the other 50% is tracking down specimens to add or send somewhere, making simple 1:2 dilutions, removing clots and centrifuging stuff, cancelling hemolyzed specimens, and occasionally calling critical results to the emergency center. Sometimes I have to putz around with instruments because they're out of something, need to be calibrated, or need a part swapped out, etc. I get an hour lunch. On slow nights I go incognito on google chrome and browse r/smashbros.  I like my job but I'm not really passionate about it. The pros are that it's not stressful about 80% of the time once I get comfortable in a given area after a few weeks. It rarely gets overwhelming. Most of the machines have a back-up so worst comes to worst I leave day-shift with a broken instrument but patient results still get out fine. I'm a mildly nervous guy and found nursing school VERY stressful but I find MLS very doable. My regrets are that I didn't get to this point faster. I'm 27 and have been working since January--got hired right after the internship. I tried nursing school first and hated it. Extremely stressful for me. Touching sick, old, naked people is just a bummer.    Cons of the job: About 1/4-1/3 of the people in my area (thankfully most of them are on different shifts) are shitty in one way or another. Some of them are mean no matter what you do, some are dumb, some are lazy, etc. Same with any job. And the gossip is annoying. EVERYONE gossips at some point. They suck you in. It's like high school except instead of harassing each other openly people just talk when the person in question isn't around. Very annoying.    Use google.  I work nights. 40 hours/week. 10pm-6:30am. Sleep around 10am-6pm so my dad is a bit split up but I can hang out before work and unwind after so it's actually pretty okay. If I want to sleep in I can. It's very nice not having to wake up uber early to work when my body doesn't want to. Sure you sleep your day away sometimes but it's great to have that option! This will largely depend on the area you're in. Blood Bank is stressful when there's a trauma since you have to move super fast to get units. Otherwise it's not bad. Automated chemistry and microbiology are laidback provided your instruments are working which they are usually. Hematology varies and probably depends mostly on how comfortable/how much you like doing diffs. Go for chem and micro if you're concerned about stress. Being a generalist would probably suck the most since you have to know EVERYTHING. Even if you get pigenholed in one area and want to switch later, you can always review theory (you'll probably need about 1/4 of what you learned in school) but you'll mostly just pick it up through training and doing it.    A lot of people complain about pay but I feel like making 50k-ish per year in my state is reasonable. If you want more money go back to school or go into business.   EDIT: How old are you btw? If you're young enough, get a job in MLS then work part-time while living at home and going for a Master's (something SPECIFIC like PA, Pathologist's Assistant, etc--not some some bullshit that just sets you up for having to get a Ph.D) and move out in your late 20s. If you're a guy, date a girl 4-7 years younger than you and get married when you're in your early 30s and she's in her mid-20s."
medlabprofessionals,3e53mh,AnarchoPunx,1 point,Wed Jul 22 07:05:58 2015 UTC,Thank you for your reply. It really helped me out.   Do you think being passionate about it is something that I need to last a while in this career? Did you have a passion for it during schooling and it just gradually dwindled? Or was your view that way the whole time?  What kinds of things contribute to the 20% of the stress?  Do you know how difficult it is to get morning shifts? Did you choose to go with the night shift or was that the only option they gave you?  Can I ask what state you live in? 50k per year isn't bad at all!  I'm a 23 yo F. Do you think it would be wiser to start out as an MLT and continue on to being an MLS (so I can test the waters before committing to being an MLS)? Or just go directly into studying to be a MLS?   Thanks again for your help.
medlabprofessionals,3e53mh,noobwithboobs,1 point,Wed Jul 22 14:30:08 2015 UTC,"just go for the MLS. I have my Masters in Clinical Laboratory Science. I regret none of that work and I feel it sets you up to be more competitive for management positions, at least here in Illinois."
medlabprofessionals,3e53mh,voocat,-2,Wed Jul 22 15:33:05 2015 UTC,"If you are looking for a life on practically the lowest tier in the lab, with equally low pay, then be an mlt. If the lab is somewhere you see yourself in 20 years, become a med tech instead. Way better pay for doing practically the same job.   As far as stress level, the lab in my opinion is pretty low stress 80% of the time. Yes it's busy, but it's not like a patient is dying in front of you (this excludes blood bank, that can be intense)."
medlabprofessionals,3e53mh,praxeologue,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:29:25 2015 UTC,"Sorry for the stupid question, but I still haven't sorted out MLT versus Med Tech in the states.

I did it right after CSMLS with a week and a half of extra prep."
medlabprofessionals,3e53mh,Kamikaze_Model_Plane,1 point,Wed Jul 22 16:07:19 2015 UTC,"Not stupid at all, it was stupid of me to assume you were in the states. Here, an mlt is basically the equivalent of a lab tech but with a few more privileges (eg reading gram stains, UA reading) and a couple extra bucks an hour. A med tech makes almost double the money and does the more ""advanced"" lab duties (eg plate reading, blood bank testing, monitoring all the systems in Chem etc etc)."
medlabprofessionals,3e53mh,Kamikaze_Model_Plane,2,Wed Jul 22 04:38:54 2015 UTC,"This is regional in the states.  I'm a MLT right out of school and I read plates (I could do all those duties in blood bank or chemistry but do not work in those departments).  I know in other states/regions MLT's generally do not do highly complex testing, but in my area the only difference is pay and ability to be in management.  I'm still a proponent for going for a bachelors, I will do so in the future."

Also make sure whether that $25 figure includes any shift differential for evenings/nights. In any case:  ""I would love to be a part of your establishment, but I was expecting closer to $25/hr when I applied. Is there any way you can help me with this?""  Things I've heard my classmates say were like, ""I believe I'm worth more than your offer"" and ""I am also considering another hospital, but if the offer were $25/hr, it would greatly influence my decision.""  Whatever you say, just don't burn bridges. Be as polite and courteous as possible and thank them even if they don't budge and you don't accept the offer. Do let them know your reason for refusing the offer, citing that you thought the offer was too low. Also, don't lie. Don't tell them you've got someone offering you $30/hr if it's not true because it will come back to you. The MLS community is rather small and people do talk.  Good luck, mate."
medlabprofessionals,3e4zw5,P4u113,2,Wed Jul 22 01:59:08 2015 UTC,Just talk to them and let them know what's up. Don't  be afraid that you are going to hurt some feelings.  This is your career and your $$$.  If you don't ask then you're the only one shit out of luck.  Don't  be nice about it be assertive.

So you'll definitely have to get those done before applying. All programs have prerequisite courses you need to finish.  A quick google search shows the following requirements to get a CLS in CA: http://www.indeed.com/forum/job/medical-technologist/Requirements-get-CA-CLS-license/t202484  Edit: I think as long as you follow the CA requirements and take those certain courses, you should be able to apply for a CA license."

I found out while I was working that my program through Texas Tech would NOT qualify me to get my California license, even though when I interviewed for the CLS program they assured me it would.  The 1 year program HAD to be in california at their approved training program sites. I ended up getting accepted to an internal program for a specialized CLS degree at my work and became a CLS that way.

Also cupcake, I'm not sure if your information is correct, because a lot of people from the Philipinnes and out of state have applied to California and have been accepted, it's not california only unless it changed this year (texas tech does not count as a 1-year internship, so of course you wouldn't be accepted in Cali, that's not my original question, because Texas Tech knows that you will want to apply to another internship, they're just providing the coursework) My main question remains, regarding out of state internships (For example, lets say I did Texas Tech for 1 year, and at the end I applied to some 1-year hospital internship in some place in Alabama let's say)  Has anyone got CA from out of state; what was your experience?"

And it happened to land on just a bad day for me. First I showed up missing my badge and they sent me home to get it- harsh right? Then I got in a fight with the big rotating timer we mostly use for sed rates. You stick pins in the wheel at the time you want, and it rotates clockwise then alarms when the pin reaches 0, producing the most ear ringing and horrific sound you can imagine. Unfortunately the pins are a bit sticky and so I was struggling to pull it out as it's alarming and just rattling my bones, and a very naughty and loud word slips out just as the inspector walks through the door into the lab. She looked over at me in shock and all I could think to say was, ""I don't work here!!"" Then I fled.  That's my inspection story. XD"

It probably have to do with California's need to have their techs go through the year long program at a time when there aren't that many colleges offering them. Combine that with mass retirement. it's not that hard to get it. The problem though is they would offer you per diem, but not full time.

It's a HUGE lab, space and department wise. Somewhat a far location from Ft. Worth and Dallas. It's an open lab with glass windows so you don't feel enclosed.

medlabprofessionals,3d7x0g,DirtyharrY210,2,Tue Jul 14 05:17:07 2015 UTC,"I am a bio major with CS minor, and I've been working as a lab IT for couple years now. Some things a lab IT would encounter are   Main one - Results not crossing over from Instrument to LIS. Know how to troubleshoot that.  Know the LIS. Where to find different information. You would need to know the sequence of clinical events, from provider ordering to results posting. How orders are set-up, especially the rules that are established for each test. When there are CLIA or CLIS updates, know what rules will be affected and adjust them accordingly. This is a pain as different people have different ways of creating rules. Especially if they have been established long ago. Report writing. This goes back to point 2. If you know the LIS, you know which object to grab to get a report going.  Know basic CS. With the way LISs are heading, there probably won't be much coding involved at the lab. So be familiar with how codes look and how to use advance excel formulas. I don't know where I am seeing these, but I swear I see them all the time. Know the instruments and the tests they performed. When doing interface testing, you won't need to ask the tech to test for you. You can do it yourself. This get rid of a level of uncertainty. KNOW HOW TO READ HL7.  Know the network IT. They will be your best friends when you have network issues. Such as setting up new instruments or getting servers set up.  Depending on your lab, you might be able to focus on one section. If not, you'll need basic knowledge for all the sections of the lab... Know what's feasible. A lot of times, the LIS/ instrument vendor will say they can do this or that. But you need to stop and ask yourself if it's useful or feasible for your lab. After a presentation, lab supers will say the instrument have new software features that can do this or that. You need to remind them such feature already exist with the LIS, and it's been working great. Know SQL, vendors are moving towards having servers for their instruments.  With Lab IT, you will need to check your email like there's no tomorrow. You will get drowned in it. You will be CC'ed for a lot of emails regarding updates, LIS questions, new software updates, new hardware updates, new orderable updates, questions from other labs and so on... And you just hope the network doesn't go down when you're off...   So, that's about it, i'm sure there are a lot more things I do. i think and hope....  What LIS is your lab running?"
medlabprofessionals,3d7x0g,el_nibo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:11:45 2015 UTC,"Thanks so much for this, lots of useful things you've mentioned. We use SoftLab. The LIS team is small, and they take care of things for 5 different hospitals in my area, so knowing the instrumentation should help out a lot. I've been watching intro to CS videos online, do you know of any online resources that may be helpful?"
medlabprofessionals,3d7x0g,el_nibo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:58:09 2015 UTC,"I'm finding myself more troubleshooting now then knowing how to code. i would say i use my CS knowledge 10% of the time. For example, I have a problem with results not showing up in resulting queue. I go to the backend of the LIS and look at the transactions going on there. At this point, it's all command line. I just read through all the transactions to find the problem and talk to our LIS vendor to get it fixed. How to train for that? I don't really know.   I mean, back in college CS classes, I learned how to code to use a laser to calculate distance. I don't think that would be much help here. What was useful was learning the logic behind all computer languages. For example: If that then this else this.   During the interview, i said something along the lines of this that the managers seem to liked: I am able to interpret the directives given to me by different department supervisors and reflect them on to the LIS system. This requires a more than a pedestrian knowledge in regards to the different departments within the Lab, their analyzers, computer networking, as well as the LIS. i remember saying something about realizing any deficiencies within the LIS system can and will have a detrimental effect on the delivery of patient care.  Edit* well, doing all that without breaking other part of the system is a must too."

medlabprofessionals,3d5n1x,cutelabnerd,2,Mon Jul 13 20:28:37 2015 UTC,Took this image using a camera attached to a teaching microscope during my microbiology rotation. The TB technical specialist and one of the special pathogens director said they had never seen this before in real-life!
medlabprofessionals,3d5n1x,mundanevelocity,2,Mon Jul 13 21:08:39 2015 UTC,Thank you for sharing I had wondered what that meant.
medlabprofessionals,3d5n1x,beebeezing,2,Mon Jul 13 21:45:36 2015 UTC,I've seen cording shaped like a heart but not from a blood culture!
medlabprofessionals,3d5n1x,saraithegeek,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:46:50 2015 UTC,"Sick! Do you know how long it had to incubate to grow like that? We only hold our blood cultures for 5 days so we'd never find mycobacteria, if docs suspect that they have to order it and we send it out."
medlabprofessionals,3d5n1x,kamw83,2,Mon Jul 13 22:58:00 2015 UTC,5 days is long enough for some rapid growers to show up (m. abscesses and m. chelonae)
medlabprofessionals,3d5n1x,stphni,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:57:24 2015 UTC,Would they show up routinely in a standard set?  I know there are supplemental bottles to aid in recovery of mycobacteria but my facility doesn't use them.
medlabprofessionals,3d5n1x,saraithegeek,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:26:38 2015 UTC,I'm curious to know this as well. To my knowledge we have not ever isolated these kind of bugs from our blood culture bottles but it could be simply that they are not present in the population.  I worked for a while in an area with endemic TB but of course the TB bugs do not grow that fast.
medlabprofessionals,3d4g27,newtothelyte,4,Mon Jul 13 13:11:26 2015 UTC,"It's not MarketLab specific. We needed a new Leukoreduction pole, and it was almost 1000$ for a simple metal pole that had some hooks on it from our supplier. Absurd.  Edit: I could probably take a metal working class, buy the parts and equipment and then make a similar pole for less than 1000$. 😑"

We must occasionally get some things from Marketlab though since we have the catalogs.

I would personally choose micro because I find it more interesting and stimulating.  Does the micro job come with any training in molecular? That could be very helpful down the road"
medlabprofessionals,3d0l35,newtothelyte,5,Sun Jul 12 14:48:42 2015 UTC,"No molecular training but they did just get a MALDI-TOF. I like the thinking and investigation required for micro but I'm not sure it's what I want to end up doing long term. Everything smells so bad!! And Pseudomonas aeruginosa makes me hungry haha. I've heard that micro is harder to find positions in so on one hand, I feel lucky that I was offered a coveted position but on the other, I'm concerned it might be difficult to find a position wherever we go next."
medlabprofessionals,3d0l35,newtothelyte,5,Sun Jul 12 15:02:53 2015 UTC,"You should go for the generalist position, definitely. Micro is something that can be very limiting, especially without molecular training. In my hospital micro training takes about 7 months to complete because it's so in depth, and they hold on to their techs hard. It's something more for those who know they want to be in a micro long term.  Congrats on your job offers, btw."
medlabprofessionals,3d0l35,Destiny_Seeker,3,Sun Jul 12 15:20:36 2015 UTC,"Micro and Blood Bank are two disciplines that fight tooth and nail to keep their techs from what I can tell, some of the longest tenures I've heard of have been those two areas."

So I will probably stay work ingin micro for quite a few years and if I decide to pursue education it would be in the LIS direction instead..we just got our MALDI running too!  Congratulations on the offers! Sounds like generalist is the way to go for you. I love micro to death and everything smells awesome ;) jk. Not everything but I think even the fouler smelling bugs have their own personality and that makes it fun...at least to a micro nut!"
medlabprofessionals,3d0l35,hornplayerchris,4,Mon Jul 13 00:23:08 2015 UTC,"I was in a very similar boat: I took my first job knowing that I would move after a year (my wife was on an internship in that city), and I went with the Generalist job vs a few other offers I had for specialized areas. I definitely think that was a right decision for personal life reasons- the four ten hour shifts are awesome, and for professional reasons- I kept a bunch of different skills up and didn't waste a company's time by spending a long time training when I secretly knew that I was going to leave. Although I'm in a specialty now, I definitely would go with the 4-10s Generalist job."
medlabprofessionals,3d0l35,cutelabnerd,4,Sun Jul 12 19:32:30 2015 UTC,Definitely the generalist position! Your options down the line will be much more broad.
medlabprofessionals,3d0l35,ErroneousLogic,3,Sun Jul 12 21:29:21 2015 UTC,"First of all, congratulations, you are off to a good start.  I would say that you have brought up most of the relevant concerns about making this decision already.  It is now just a matter or weighing things like how much working a few more weekends or having an extra day off mean to you personally.  If you have an idea of when and where you are moving, I would say that should be a primary consideration.  If you expect to be moving sooner rather than later, whatever your shift rotations are, you won't have to deal with them for long.  If you have an idea of where you might move to, I'd look for current job openings and communicate with people in the area if possible.  If things don't look good, you are right in that a generalist position will be more likely to help you get a job, but you never know what will happen.  Finally, don't forget to consider what you want to do in the lab.  If you want to work in micro, start in micro; if you want to work in chemistry, take the generalist position.  Being pragmatic is good, but it doesn't have to govern every choice you make.  Set yourself up to succeed where and how you would like to as long as you do it in a responsible way."
medlabprofessionals,3d0l35,Destiny_Seeker,2,Sun Jul 12 15:09:36 2015 UTC,"Absolutely take the generalist position, unless you want to stay in Micro. In my experiences, the core lab and the micro lab are very separated from one another, but as a generalist you can take open positions in a variety of positions, and given you're still an MLT/MLS, if somewhere has a burning need for a Micro tech, they will train you anyway."

But at my current job, mlt pay tops out where the MLS pay begins. What I've noticed is that a lot of mlt's end up going back to school (usually online) for there mls after a few years. However, that can be extremely expensive. Also time consuming with a job plus kids. I'd recommend doing the 4 year right away. But again, look around at your job market and see how each are treated. Either way your job prospects look amazing in the next few years."

Some locations much prefer MLS. There are quite a few distance learning options for people that want to upgrade from MLT to MLS, you could always start with the MLT and then advance to MLS as you work and focus your career goals."

I found a great clinic job, but I was incredibly lucky - many of the local hospitals prefer MLSs, and it can be hard to find a day shift job as an MLT around here. Some places won't let MLTs become section leads, which you may or may not be interested in someday. And while I haven't experienced it, I know at some workplaces MLTs are treated a little differently or can only perform certain tasks. It's not just about pay - I'm actually pretty happy with my pay (although I'd be making more if I was an MLS), but I know there are fewer opportunities for me out there if my current job ends for some reason."

At my last summer job in college, people asked me if I'd be returning the following summer. When I told them I'd be graduating and working in a hospital, I was asked if I was going to be a doctor or a nurse. MLS truly is a hidden profession."

I'm sure they exist, but last year I went to a meeting that was held by the hospitals that we will do our internship at, and there were only 12 of us there. It was required for all juniors who were applying that semester and suggested for freshman/sophomores. I know at least 3 of us were sophomores at the time. In fact, I had no idea it was even a thing until I was searching my schools' list of majors and found it. Did some research and decided it was something I was interested in.

I thought that if an academic program was shut down they had to complete the education of all previously accepted students.  Either way, that's unfortunate. But genetics is a huge exploding field. The pace at which advancements are made is mind blowing. You might be better off there tbh."
medlabprofessionals,3cq1i1,newtothelyte,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:36:02 2015 UTC,"In the case of our environmental science major, that turned out to be true. They let them continue on until the last student graduated past the cutoff date for accepting new students under that major. When I transferred in as a junior from a community college they had the option for MLS on the website when you chose your major but the advisors gave us a depressed ""we're doing away with that program"" speech. I guess someone didn't tell IT.   I do agree genetics is rapidly expanding but right now my pay doesn't compare to an MLS. Hopefully that will change but my company is private and most things are profit driven only. The turnover rate is higher  due to the lower pay."
medlabprofessionals,3cq1i1,swimmingsoundwaves,2,Fri Jul 10 13:44:09 2015 UTC,"I agree with this statement. Also, not many people with MLS/MLT degrees are pursuing higher education or the possibility of becoming educators, so there's a shortage of staff for many of these programs.

medlabprofessionals,3cq1i1,higmage,8,Fri Jul 10 00:00:03 2015 UTC,"The job isn't one that can be replaced or pawned off to other departments. A huge chunk of the workforce is retiring and there aren't enough to replace them.   Wages are going to go up as we get more scarce, and if we get a ton of students everything will be fine. If we don't, then I see more and more hospitals employing satellite labs for everything instead of just rare or specialized tests."
medlabprofessionals,3cq1i1,Talkahuano,5,Thu Jul 9 23:19:40 2015 UTC,"I just got hired at a 150 bed hospital and half the lab staff is of retirement age. It took them 6 months to fill the position I accepted. They even negotiated higher salary. In 5 years that lab could be seriously short staffed.  Like /u/wfemec said, nobody knows what I do. My aunt thought I was a PA. My uncle thought I had EMT training. My mom thinks phlebotomy is a huge part of the job because I did it a lot as a student. So it's not surprising that so few go into this field."
medlabprofessionals,3cq1i1,anonymous_coward69,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:54:41 2015 UTC,Where and are they hiring?
medlabprofessionals,3cq1i1,Talkahuano,1 point,Fri Jul 10 11:31:28 2015 UTC,"Middle Tennessee area. This hospital is no longer hiring techs, but many in the area are. Nashville is becoming hospital city."
medlabprofessionals,3cq1i1,wfemec,5,Sat Jul 11 20:48:54 2015 UTC,"A lot of the difficulty in labs being fully staffed stems from retirements - I heard during my internship 2 years ago that the average MLS was 54.  At the hospital I was in through May, the chemistry department had maybe 30 techs, more like 20-25 I think, and 12 of them were old enough to retire.  While automation has allowed labs to operate with smaller staffs, it has not been able to fully compensate for the departures from the field, whether they are retirements, techs leaving for better jobs, or people going back to school."
medlabprofessionals,3cq1i1,DoorOnLeft,3,Thu Jul 9 22:37:24 2015 UTC,"This is more than a decade old, but it still holds today: http://labmed.ascpjournals.org/content/31/10/539.full.pdf   During my student clinical rotations, I met medical technologists with 10 to 20 years of professional experience who held more than 1 position in order to make ends meet. Changes brought about by health care reform and increasing automation, combined with salary levels that are not commensurate with the level of skill required to perform the job, made me anxious about my prospects.   The pay rate is a major factor keeping people out."

I don't know a single person making that outside upper management positions. Even supervisors are not clearing that reported average.  I agree, we aren't paid enough especially when you consider bench level scientists really only have a shelf life of 10 years unless they invest in preventative care of their wrists and back. I sure as hell deduct those from my taxes"
medlabprofessionals,3cq1i1,DoorOnLeft,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:44:35 2015 UTC,"They don't.  The official number is ~29/hr average: http://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes292011.htm which is dismal considering the average tech has decades of experience.  Techs do last longer than 10 years.

A lot of people leave because they wanted a different shift that we just couldn't offer in our current situation and so they went elsewhere for more money.  Some are going back to school so they can make even more, med school or PA school.    If the pay rate if affecting the people entering the field, then we're better off without them.  I think that people who truly care for the patient and have a passion for what they are doing can make a very happy and livable career as a MLS.  I don't think I would say the same for MLT."

I originally planned on med school but I didn't think it was for me, same with nursing, but I still wanted to work in healthcare. That being said, I don't think the problem is lack of knowledge or at least that's not the primary one. Every school I looked into is competitive and only allows a small percentage of applicants in each year, so the demand is certainly there for students. I think the problem is more that there just aren't enough schools/programs to meet the demand for new techs. My state (NV) doesn't have a single BS program, so all of our techs have to be imported from other places. We only have an MLT->MLS program which isn't going to have any net effect on the number of people in the workforce."

I don't expect our new employees to learn and remember everything.  Familiarity and the ability to work quickly comes with time. Also, speak up.  Ask questions. Talk with your trainers or supervisor.  Don't be afraid to ask coworkers questions. Additionally, take breaks. Allow your mind to rest. Get good sleep. Tired and stressed brains have a hard time forming memories."

I remember starting and being awestruck at how quickly everyone is able to go through slides and identify white cells, while I'm sitting in the training corner spending several seconds on each cell individually.  Now that I've gone through hundreds if not thousands of slides, I think my pace as naturally picked up.  The training is just to get you to the point where you can more or less function somewhat independently, getting most routine things done without needing to find the supervisor.  But I still ask others to look at difficult slides or just some of the oddball cells when necessary.  As for remembering details read what /u/bobthenerd has to say.  Resources are abundant, just be sure to know where they are.  And don't be afraid to speak up.

Between your lab notebook and figuring out your resources, you won't become the annoying tech who asks the same question over and over! And seriously, don't worry. There's a learning curve. I've been a tech for about 3 years now, and learning on the fly has become second nature. I'm a traveler now, and I'm expected to learn how to do pretty much everything within a couple of weeks, and I see it as a challenge now! Things get a lot easier, just keep working hard."

We have some canned comments but a lot of times I don't think that they accurately describe the situation. Recently I wrote a comment on a urine appearance noting that it was clear but grossly contaminated with sand (pt had been swimming). Lots of notes about hemolysis and other specimen conditions. Specimens which were relabeled by the floor get a big honking comment. If I see suspicious cells on a body fluid differential I'll comment that I suggest referring the specimen to the pathologist for cytology. I often also comment when I've deviated from normal procedure in some way, for example diluting a specimen, verifying by repeat analysis, or performing a urine micro unspun. If I need to run a specimen that's outside of its normal stability due to difficulty recollecting (i.e. a synovial fluid from our clinic 2 hours away) I'll put a big comment on that."

Since everyone on Night shift is required to work 10 hours/night plus every other weekend, the days are not straight 5 days in a row. However, We make a pattern for each employees that they go through monthly, and then make it for an entire year. The master schedule tells us who's going to be working what day if they don't swap or request off. If they do request off or swap, we just make micro adjustment for the monthly schedule."
medlabprofessionals,3cfwvn,swollennode,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:57:55 2015 UTC,"We recently started using scheduling software.  It is supposed to have a master template (pattern) for everyone's regular rotation.  We are supposed to request days off and swap shifts in this software.  People are supposed to be able to sign up for empty shifts on the software and it is supposed to deny any extra shifts or swaps that cause overtime.    The software does none of this properly.  We are so very short staffed and already working at absolute minimum staffing with required overtime.  So, the software spits out its bogus schedule and then the gal that has been making this thing by hand for years gets to redo it."
medlabprofessionals,3cfwvn,JigglyBatWings,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:12:32 2015 UTC,"Our facility uses schedule anywhere, and it has an app and you can check it online. You (the scheduler) fill in the master template and we submit swaps to the scheduler in a Microsoft SharePoint calendar. The scheduler then edits in the swaps, and if something is missing we shoot the scheduler an email, because we know we are responsible for the shifts posted on that calendar, no excuses, we can access them literally anywhere with internet."

People fall all along the bell curve, and you will not be making 62k as a recent grad. You'll fall in the 50k plus or minus a few grand category.  Are you planning on living in NYC? 50k in NYC is a comfortable wage (for someone who rents, is unmarried, has no children), but DEFINITELY expect to live with at least one roommate, and prepare to live in a small place. Living in Brooklyn or Queens will also cut down on the living expenses.

There are apartment brokers who will charge you one month's rent or 20% of your annual rent. It's possible to find an apartment without a broker, but it's so much harder.  Also NYC landlords like to go by the 40x annual rent rule. Your annual salary must be 40x the monthly rent.  For a reference, studios in Manhattan are from ~$1500 and up. Brooklyn and Queens, like I said, cheaper. But you can see how with a salary of 50k, your options become quite limited.  In addition, apartments go fast. If you tour an apartment on Monday morning, for example, you better be ready to sign for it on Monday morning. Because by Monday afternoon it will almost certainly be gone. By Tuesday morning, 100% guaranteed gone. That is, of course, if it's anywhere worth living. If it's a roach infested crack den, you might have a few days to think about it.

The adaptive test is designed to throw questions at you that you will miss roughly 50% of the time.  55% in the subject tests? Take a subject test of about 25 questions for each subject and go over the general topics of what you missed. You need about a 70-75% on these to be fairly certain of passing."
medlabprofessionals,3ca570,Talkahuano,2,Mon Jul 6 12:28:47 2015 UTC,"I just took it about two weeks ago and passed.  I graduated from my program in December 2013.  I did minimal studying, using LAB CE as my primary resource, and just read over my notes in the week before the test to refresh things.  I drug my butt a bit in the testing since I just couldn't afford the fee at the time.  I was getting 65-66% on the computer adaptive exam, and 70-80 on the single subject stuff (save for Micro... bleh!)  Don't worry too much, as long as you know your stuff and are confident in that knowledge you should do fine.  Everyone's tests are different, but I found a lot of my questions were based on troubleshooting.  You get X result, does this make sense.  You get X result, its obviously wrong, what do you do now?  That sort of thing."
medlabprofessionals,3ca570,BeurredeTortue,1 point,Mon Jul 6 12:52:08 2015 UTC,I was around the same percentage wise for the adaptive tests. I was always between 52 and 65% on those tests with my average difficulty varying between 6.2 and 6.9. I just took and passed the ASCP back in May on the first time.   When studying I did the specific subject quizzes in the areas I knew I would struggle in the most (blood bank). I did those quizzes everyday and then once or twice a week I would take an adaptive exam. The day of the exam I did a very brief review going through the LSU book on the drive to the testing center.  Good luck on the exam when you take it! I'm sure you will crush it :)
medlabprofessionals,3ca570,Zodnick11,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:08:03 2015 UTC,"I was in a similar boat as you getting barely past the practice tests. They are great prep for the random things that come up, but the actual exam is passable! Just don't panic if you see answers of bacteria or fungi you have never heard of. Usually 2 of the 4 answers will be familiar to you enough to eliminate as not fitting the result profile. For example the bacteria is gram positive, but you see two species you know are gram negative and two others you probably haven't heard of before. At least this method will reduce your odds of getting a wrong answer.  There will be plenty of I GOT THIS questions in there to help boost your confidence.

Try the local water company, police crime lab, city water treatment/shed for micro. Theres also food processing QA/QC jobs. Some vet clinics, zoos. These will probably pay similarly or a bit less, but if theres no positions near you I assume you're not in a major city so the cost of living isn't that high.

medlabprofessionals,3c84wh,emb45995,4,Sun Jul 5 20:18:04 2015 UTC,"My raise was more like $5/hr when I went MLT to MT, so you need to look for a better job market."
medlabprofessionals,3c84wh,sofie7885,2,Sun Jul 5 22:24:28 2015 UTC,"Get your BS MLS, sit the ASCP MT exam. Upgrade your certification, upgrade your worthiness to potential future employers.  Sadly, there are still a great deal of companies that will not hire MLTs at all. There are a lot of companies that differentiate job duties based on MLT vs MT. Having your BS MLS and your MT cert opens lots and lots of doors."

I've never encountered a MLT in CA, though I know they exist.   I've also read on other posts with people in other states that although MLT and MLS are equivalent, their lab really only hires MLS.  Like most aspects of this profession, the answer to your question relies heavily on the state or general job market that you are in."
medlabprofessionals,3c84wh,livin_the_life,10,Sun Jul 5 20:26:02 2015 UTC,"Also, I like math, so lets look at that $1.50 an hour (Its actually really significant).  $1.50/hr x 2080 working hours a year = $3,120 more a year.   Putting that into a 401k and avoiding taxes over a 35 year working career amounts to nearly $460,000 (Assuming a 7% average return). Using the 4% safe withdrawal rule, that's an extra $18,000 of income for your retirement. If you factor in a 3% rate of inflation, these become $160k and $6.6k in today's dollars, respectively. Granted, these are a lot of assumptions, but if done right, that $1.50 raise could mean nearly an extra $7k yearly increase in income during retirement."

None of the places I applied wanted to see a transcript or anything like that. I had my GPA on my resume, but other than that they had no indication what my grades were like. The biggest factors are the interview and references/recommendations. I ended up getting hired at a hospital that had taken a couple of my classmates as interns. When I applied, the manager asked my classmates a ton of questions about me. Work ethic, willingness to help out, etc. I was offered an interview the next business day after applying and had the job less than a week after the interview."

Same applies for online vs on-site programs. I did my M(ASCP) education as a post-bacc online and that wasn't the deciding factor as to how I compared to the regular MLS BS routes. Doing well in your clinicals and making a good impression is what counts. The certification will make you appealing to employers that that as a requirement (and even those that don't). Be willing to help out with what you've been trained to do if things get busy instead of just cracking a textbook or reading procedures during downtime. The sooner they see you as having potential to be part of the team the better. Show that you're taking in what people are showing you and applying that to what you do. Ask questions. That being said, if you do decide to pursue a higher degree you might want to have good grades so you don't end up retaking prerequisites for a better transcript."

The honors, research projects you participated in, and other specialized certifications you have completed help distinguish you from the group.

medlabprofessionals,3c4vee,Delysid52,6,Sat Jul 4 20:25:20 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't think that getting a micro position as a young generalist would be any more difficult than getting one as a fresh graduate as your micro experience level would be the same.  That said, you still have a year for something to pop up.  You should consider the current job market for your area as well."
medlabprofessionals,3c4vee,ErroneousLogic,3,Sat Jul 4 20:33:32 2015 UTC,"If you are a generalist here, you do all of the setup plus read gram stains and do blood cultures. So all you'd have to train is the read benches. I think you'd be more likely to get a micro job with that than less likely."
medlabprofessionals,3c4vee,llama726,2,Sun Jul 5 00:50:11 2015 UTC,"I think it would depend on your willingness to relocate. If you want to work in a specific city, or even county, you may not find a Micro job.   If you don't have too many ties and can look statewide, you'll likely be able to find a Micro position."
medlabprofessionals,3c4vee,livin_the_life,2,Sat Jul 4 22:22:17 2015 UTC,"Also something to consider; my lab only hires for micro from within.  It took me almost six years of nights and evening for someone in micro to retire, but I loved my lab and the generalist experience I gained isn't wasted."
medlabprofessionals,3c4vee,ThirstyLabRat,2,Sun Jul 5 00:50:46 2015 UTC,"My charge tech (supervisor for my shift) started as a generalist and made the transition just fine. He's been there a year and is already above some who have been there for 20 years. He doesn't know all the benches but he does great work with what he does know.   That being said, your hopes may change. When I was one year out from graduation I thought I'd only want to do molecular. Then during my rotations I thought I would only ever work in heme. The whole time I knew I NEVER wanted to work in micro. Then I went to my micro rotation and fell in love and they just happened to have a position open when I finished. So just go in with an open mind and see where your heart lies/the jobs are when you graduate."
medlabprofessionals,3c4vee,santogue,1 point,Sun Jul 5 03:15:43 2015 UTC,"It is highly unlikely that you will be hired into the lab for micro with no experience as a generalist.  You are better off cutting your teeth on an off shift in a lab as a generalist and hope that someone retires, quits, or a job opens in micro at another hospital. Do not wait around for a micro job to open up."
medlabprofessionals,3c4vee,Mirandacake,2,Sun Jul 5 03:21:55 2015 UTC,"Depends on the circumstances. I got hired as a new grad into micro at my clinical site doing micro rotations as part of a micro-only MLS program certifying as M(ASCP). The hospital I work at has 15-20 techs per department of which micro is one. Lots of retirees. I know of at least two techs that started in specimen processing, one as a generalist and the other an MLT.  That being said, the sooner OP is employed, probably the better. Getting work experience will put you in a better position to apply to any job, period. And it is not unexpected for new grads to switch workplaces early on."
medlabprofessionals,3c4vee,beebeezing,1 point,Mon Jul 6 00:20:46 2015 UTC,"My lab hires generalists for micro, even from outside (we just hired a guy who worked a stat lab. He's training in micro right now.) Everyone here is a generalist, most of them trained in 3 areas. If you're day shift and one of your areas is micro, you get trained entirely, setups and plate reading. I think it would just depend on how the lab works where you're hired."
medlabprofessionals,3c4vee,justjess1223,1 point,Sun Jul 5 07:22:08 2015 UTC,I would say apply to the hospital where you want to work.  Work as a generalist or in some other concentration until a micro spot opens up.  They will train you for a few weeks if you get hired for the micro position.  At least that's what they do at my hospital.
medlabprofessionals,3c4vee,Vivalaredsox,1 point,Sun Jul 5 15:38:40 2015 UTC,It's probably easier to get a job in micro as a working generalist than as a new graduate. Just guessing.

I had to wait almost 2 years for a day shift position to open up, but because I had Micro experience I got preference.  If Micro is what you love, you need to try and get in where you can."

It's a bit more of a commute than I'd like (1.5 hrs), but the hospital pays more than the hospitals on the area, and it's hard to find other hospitals that are hiring full time. I will be there 2 years this August."

From graduating in December '14 to my first day on the job, in March 2015, it was a little nerve racking to be honest. I had contacted a head hunting agency and they landed me a job up in San Angelo, Tx. I ended up taking a position in the RGV, thanks to a connection I had (Networking works wonders, omg). (I didn't want to move to San Angelo after visiting..).  If you're absolutely desperate, then contact a head hunting agency (Aureus Medical, Lighthouse, CompHealth), but really, only use those if you don't mind living out in the middle of nowhere. They will be down to pay for relocation expenses but that usually requires you to sign on with them for a year.   Otherwise, use your current contacts, professors might know of former students who are in managerial positions and may be looking to hire (you never know).  Make good with the people at your clinical rotation sites. talk, NETWORK. Be persistent is all i can really say."

medlabprofessionals,3c1qbl,xploeris,1 point,Sun Jul 5 11:52:06 2015 UTC,"Comp Health got back to me pretty much right away, the people there were nice, but they called me every day and were quite pushy (obviously). I didn't really like San Angelo because the neighboring cities had oil fields from which some of the workers resided in SA, leaving the renting properties to be utterly ridiculous. I would have had to work just to live there instead of the other way around. The town reminded me of Harlingen (RGV), and since that was where I was from, I didn't really want to move back there. I currently work in McAllen (I know, but it at least has a little more going on than Hrl).   From what I hear about the job market in the RGV, it shouldn't be too bad, it's kinda saturated from the CLS program at Pan Am/UTRGV, but certain hospitals will be currently hiring (Doctor's Hospital at Renaissance, McAllen Medical Center, Knapp Medical Center), So I'd recommend applying now rather than later (a new batch of MT students will be hired around November 2015 - January of next year)."

I have yet to see a place that doesn't send you and the source to get drawn for hiv and hepatitis (we also do liver enzymes per our policy) regardless if it was a ""little"" prick or a large exposure.  In all honesty I would bring up the fact the needlestick procedure was not started when you brought it up to your supervisor...I accidentally got glass in my hand and even though it was the tiniest little prick I had to go and get checked out and write an incident report on it."

If you get accidentally stuck, you need to go over to occ health and file an incident report. My superiors would be in trouble if they urged me not to file a report."

[Is there] there is anything in particular I should do to prepare myself?   Get certified before you try to get a job. What we need to know to work this job well is very specific to the field, and I can almost guarantee you that you don't know much of it at all.   What's a common day at work like?   Depends on what bench I'm working. The general flow for all of them though is QC and calibrations as soon as I walk in, morning draws right after, then whatever orders come down throughout the rest of the day.   I hear this field can be stressful, why is that?   Your work needs to be very exact and most people don't understand that. That statement is oversimplified to a huge extent, but I'll just leave it at that for now.   What kind of pay do you entry level positions like this usually pay?   Depends entirely on where you work.   Being from a state that doesn't require certification if I start working here is there a way for me to become certified? Or is school the only option.

My first ""tech"" job was as a non-registered tech (only had a chem degree) in a toxicology lab.  This was at a large facility that ran urine drug screens (pre-employment, DOT).  Since it wasn't medical related I did not have to be a certified tech.  All testing was batched, we were busy, but there was no pressure like hospital work.    Night shift loaded all the samples on large immuno based analyzers.  They would also perform maintenance and QC for the run.  Positives were given to day shift for chemical extraction.  This was basically a cookbook procedure for preparing samples for each drug to be tested by GC/MS.  Samples/QC was loaded on the GC/MS and allowed to run.    Evening shift removed samples, verified QC was satisfactory, then released results."

medlabprofessionals,3bo7ig,moby323,6,Wed Jul 1 05:10:23 2015 UTC,"This is actually the route that I took many years ago. They have since stopped allowing this in my state. Luckily started in time to grandfather in.   So, on to the tips! One thing that I made absolutely SURE of is that I had to fill in the gaps in my knowledge. When I went home at night, I was bringing home medical textbooks and studying. I didn't know the difference between creatinine and creatine. My bachelors in Biology have me a great starting point, but was sorely lacking on a lot of human anatomy, disease states etc. Read everything you can get your hands on!   The absolute BIGGEST pointer that I can offer you is ASK QUESTIONS!!! The only stupid question is the one you don't ask because you're afraid of looking stupid and a patient gets hurt because of it. Remember, you're taking care of human lives now, and that carries an awesome burden. With that burden is going to come some seriously awesome rewards though. I can safely say that there are a few people still walking around today because of me. Sadly, if you're doing your job right, people won't even know you exist and you may never receive the thanks, but YOU will know what you did.   Be extremely patient with both your trainers and yourself. Remember, you're a rookie and (please pardon my saying so) you don't know jack :) Remember that awesome burden I just mentioned? Someone now had to shoulder that burden AND teach you how not to screw up. It's REALLY hard and some people are better at it than others. Also remember, you WILL screw up. They say that the experience of a tech is directly proportional to the amount of equipment broken...and they are very much correct. You're gonna break things. It's going to happen, just be sorry about it and do what you can to make it right. Don't beat yourself up too badly, but make sure it doesn't happen again :)  As for the interview? Just be yourself. Answer questions directly, with confidence and try to get to know your interviewers too. You want to be sure that the place is a good fit for you as well. Be sure you're getting into the game for the right reasons. Personally? I got into it because the idea that I would go home at night and maybe, just maybe help out someone in the world and be a small force of good in the universe really appealed to me. I hope it does to you too.   Best of luck! Let us know how it goes please!"

medlabprofessionals,3bl4a7,fraufrau,11,Tue Jun 30 02:40:40 2015 UTC,http://wordsology.org/high-yield-notes-2/microbiology/  Flow charts in micro are your friend. I was in your position last year and nailed the micro on the ASCP exam.
medlabprofessionals,3bl4a7,LabGeekBro,7,Tue Jun 30 05:11:10 2015 UTC,"Well.... I don't want you to stress yourself out, but I do want to be real with you. The BOC will give you a list of biochemical reactions and tell you to figure out what organism it is; I never once saw a photo. It won't even give you as much detail as you would hope for; for example, it may not tell you how it gram stained because the lists of tests should already lead you to thinking of a gram+ or gram= without it having to be said.  My approach to micro was to always figure out the biochemical test that was specific to the organism. Before you even start worrying about what the biochemical test read, look at what tests were being run and get your brain primed with organisms that usually call for those tests. There's always an odd ball test or two in the mix which should set off alarm bells for you and help narrow it down before you've even began to interpret the results. For example, if I'm reading a list and I see GNR, Oxidase, Urease (blah blah blah, yawn) and then it mentions salt tolerance or TCBS agar, I'm instantly thinking of Vibrio. That one is easy right?   Okay, so if someone mentions a black butt (H2S) on a TSI slant, more than a few organisms might come to mind. You write those organisms down in a group and then figure out what differentiates them from each other; we know Proteus is Urease+ and Salmonella isn't. We also know that they aren't likely going to mention an ONPG reaction for Proteus, so at that point you just need to understand that Salmonella is ONPG- and Citrobacter is +.  Don't worry about all the other biochemical reactions, find the 1-3 tests that are unique to that organism and memorize it. Then be sure you understand the very basic way an infection is acquired by that organism. For example, for whatever reasons, I felt like the BOC/LabCe loved focusing on Brucella and slaughterhouses. Just like how they love talking about bird/bat shit and Histoplasmosis.  As for your trainers, I think it's odd they were using pyr instead of indole and catalase/coag.   I also feel like your micro teacher can make or break you as a student. If you didn't have a micro teacher that taught it in an organized manner, it absolutely can become overwhelming.   I highly recommend practicing using LabCe. It's 100% worth it."
medlabprofessionals,3bl4a7,femanonette,3,Tue Jun 30 04:51:17 2015 UTC,"I second this comment; the Micro questions on the BOC are pretty much as /u/femanonette said. Another user mentioned flowcharts. For me they really were the saving grace of my Micro class. You may not remember all the little details and reactions of every organism, but you will be able to remember a few flowcharts and their characteristic chemical reactions enough to id them.    As for the clinical rotation part, take it slow! Only study for the bench you're supposed to be on that week according to your schedule (urine, anaerobes, wounds, respiratory, misc, etc). Take note of the descriptions your trainer will give you when he/she wants you to id an organism (S. Viridans smells like butterscotch, S. aureus looks like a big yellow zit, Proteus 'swarms', etc) and take note of them right then and there on a piece of paper to study at the end of the day.    And at the end of it you'll need to be reminded of two things: 1) The BOC wont ever ask you to ID something on sight, only by their biochemical reactions and growth on certain medias 2) Unless you work day shift, evening and night Micro jobs are usually just set-up and gram stains, no benches. You did well on set-ups, right? You'll be fine."
medlabprofessionals,3bl4a7,P4u113,4,Tue Jun 30 20:35:57 2015 UTC,"The micro techs shouldn't  expect you to know everything right now. Your classes were a year ago so you're obviously out of practice. That being said, become a sponge now - ask questions when you're curious/don't know about something, ask to see interesting things that others are working up even if it's not your trainer, and find ways to remember things.   I would also second the flow chart idea. Maybe ask if you and your trainer can sit down and create flow charts for the most common organisms. During my rotation our first two days were all looking at cultures of common organisms and working through flow charts to get used to what we would be seeing and how to work them up. I'm at work for the night (got a job in micro right after graduation) but if I get a free moment towards the end of the night/tomorrow before work I can scan and send you my flow charts of that would help for you. I have two super simple ones that cover 80%+ of the organisms that you will see - one for GPC and one for GNB.   Also, start with the easy tests that give you a lot of info. These would be catalase, oxidase, pyr, Indole, and bile, plus the things you can tell from your plates such as hemolysis and carbohydrate utilization (lactose in Mac). Once you learn what these few tests are commonly used for you will be in good shape."

medlabprofessionals,3bl4a7,santogue,3,Sun Jul 5 02:36:15 2015 UTC,"First of all, try not to worry about it; just relax and study at a comfortable pace. As for the micro classes you took in college, don't bother reviewing that material (but it might be a good reference if you need to look something up quickly). Only study the stuff being presented to you right now. Does your instructor give you learning objectives? If so, that's a good place to start.   During my micro rotation I would condense my study notes into somewhat of an outline form, and this is what I would review for tests. If you do this, it really helps if you keep the material organized. For example, make a section just for gram positive cocci, one for gram negative rods, urine cultures, sputums, wounds, and a good table that lists each media and what that media inhibits and what it grows.  This seemed to work well for me. What I'm trying to say is just study in sections like just the GNR then just the GPR etc...  Oh, one last thing: make sure you know the basic biochemicals for the Enterobacteriaceae family. They like to give test question about that. Find a nice flow chart, and that will help greatly. For me, it didn't help to see a name of an organism and a list of + or - biochemical reactions next to it. I needed the flow chart.   Hope this kind of helped."
medlabprofessionals,3bl4a7,penguin_zombie8888,2,Tue Jun 30 03:10:25 2015 UTC,"My best advice is to consider the source of each culture. Know normal flora and common pathogens for different body systems. For instance, E. coli and Enterococcus faecalis are the most common pathogens associated with UTIs. Patient history can also be a good clue. Have they been hospitalized for a while? Do they have a catheter? Certain bacteria are more common in nosocomial infections, such as Staph saprophyticus for UTIs.   I second the idea of flow charts too. Memorizing biochemical reactions is hard. If you can group things together in your head it might be easier. Here's a link to some flowcharts a classmate of mine made. They're kinda hard to read on imgur, but if you PM me with an email address I'd be willing to send the individual files to you.  As far as passing the BOC, I can't recommend LabCE enough. My whole class used it and so far we have a 100% pass rate on the first try."
medlabprofessionals,3bl4a7,almondjoy12,2,Tue Jun 30 04:26:44 2015 UTC,"Not to nit pick but E faecalis is a less common cause of UTI than say Klebsiella, Proteus, and even S. saprophyticus."

medlabprofessionals,3bl4a7,almondjoy12,1 point,Wed Jul 1 03:04:46 2015 UTC,Depends on your patient population. Sapros are really rare at my hospital and we routinely get a few Enterococci to work up in UTI's..
medlabprofessionals,3bl4a7,beebeezing,2,Fri Jul 3 01:34:08 2015 UTC,You have to go broad and make educated guesses: You cannot learn every detail in micro. You just can't.   FLOW CHARTS as another user said are very helpful. Get the Jarreau book to help with getting the big picture.

I had a difficult time guessing what organisms were just based on colony morphology, pyr, and oxidase testing.   Then you're not paying any attention, because you also have (or should have) specimen source. Is it from a nasal swab? A foot? Urine? Child or adult? You also have differential media that may help, and they should have been set up as well. You may also have temperature and oxygen sensitivity to consider.  When you're in school, they teach you ""here are all the GPC. Here are all the GNB. Here are tests to run on all of them."" It's very theoretical. Try to approach this from a practical perspective. Someone has an infection in their [body part]. What kinds of infections would you expect to find there? How can you easily tell them apart?  Of course, if you didn't study enough in school, then you don't know what the organisms are because you don't know what (e.g.) a positive oxidase means. Which is why you go back and make or find flowcharts, and study them until they're committed to memory."

Look up medical groups like Dupage Medical Group, Cadence Health group, etc that are local to Illinois.

As long as the doctor doesn't call for the result, it doesn't seem to matter how long it takes.  So the same mistake makers that cause a delay in results seem like their mistakes don't matter.  No measuring of turn around time for specimens dropped off by courier. They are just tossed in a pile with no arrival time. The ""received"" time is the time that the specimen is ordered.  We just put up a 37.8 million dollar building, making all of our current double occupancy rooms into private rooms. Also built a new surgery department in the same building. The institution did not hire more environmental services employees. We just added an insane amount of trash and rooms for them to clean, you'd think we'd hire more people.   40-50 women work in the lab. We have a two stall bathroom. It is being remodeled. It is taking a week with no explanation or apology for the inconvenience. It should take a day if they actually had all the supplies and planned the project correctly instead of tearing out the stalls and not working on it for two days.   Needless to say, I have an interview at a different hospital next week."

Understaffed, super religious hospital where the management was there just to line their own pockets, doctors and nurses not willing to help you out AT ALL, people screaming at me almost every night, and coworkers who would come in drunk/high and ask you to run their drug tests under the table to see if they would pass! And I was on night shift in a 150 bed hospital with only one other tech and no phleb. It was amazing if I didn't come home crying after half of my shifts. Also, worst scheduling ever. Work ten days, get one off then work a couple more, no fluidity or cohesion. On the bright side though, every job I've taken as a traveler has been AWESOME compared to that job!"
medlabprofessionals,3b4btq,cutelabnerd,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:35:40 2015 UTC,"I worked for an oncology lab that literally just started building a lab from only having experience with point of care devices. I was told I would have a supervisor (that person was on paper and never in the office during my shift). I worked second shift, there was no on call phone number to report criticals, no ranges established to label a critical, no policies, no SOP's developed, and no supporting staff. I was the only one in that stupid building and when the machines went stupid, there was no assistance to help troubleshoot while maintaining the other 2 instruments' work flow.  I will never work at a lab without at least one other person in the lab to bounce an idea off of or assist when the instrument won't even register a sample being loaded.  It's definitely the team and supportive staff that make a lab, without it one failure can blow the whole operation for the day."

medlabprofessionals,3b4qak,morganlafitte,3,Fri Jun 26 23:06:42 2015 UTC,"It really depends on the turnover of the particular lab, which in many cases depends on the size of the lab. I started on the third shift at a large core lab, and was able to move to the afternoon after only three months. I have also seen fresh graduates start on the first and second shifts, though most started on third.  However, our turnover rate was much higher than most other labs. I have friends at smaller labs who couldn't get off of the third shift, period. Just too many old techs locked in, who aren't going to retire for years hence."
medlabprofessionals,3b4qak,telemaphone,3,Fri Jun 26 00:12:36 2015 UTC,There is a lot of turnover in my lab. So lots of openings. The biggest problem is filling in the off shifts so people can move. They won't even officially offer the job because HR says if you've been offered you have to move within a certain amount of time. I recently got passed over for a day shift job because the want me in blood bank full time and they are having a hard time filling Nights.

Tonight is my last night on night shift, and then I go back to evenings which is what I prefer.   I could have switched sooner or gotten a new job but I have really nice benefits and took too long to decide I wanted to change shifts almost a year ago, when the next opening came up I requested it before the person even left.   Smaller hospitals with a day shift primarily of older folks you could be waiting years to go to days. Where I work they offered it to me while I was training and 3 or 4 times since then, I just don't want to work days."

Honestly, second shift is not that bad, I feel like I have way more free time working this shift. I think it's perfectly realistic to start on 2nd shift, just know that you may have to swing to 3rd to cover vacations if you're the new guy/gal."
medlabprofessionals,3b4qak,saraithegeek,2,Fri Jun 26 19:52:33 2015 UTC,"I'm on second shift. My hospital is huge and we get a lot of outreach so it can actually be busier than days a lot of the time.

medlabprofessionals,3b4qak,sippyjuice,2,Sat Jun 27 15:25:17 2015 UTC,"It's hard to say how you ought to plan; I really do think it depends on the labs in your area. I had the good fortune of being hired on day shift at one of the hospitals where I did my rotations within a month of graduating, so it's definitely possible to land a job on your desired shift!  I don't know if you're a current MT student or are just considering it, but my best advice to you is to put yourself out there! Go and ask questions of labs or professors near you/where you want to be! Show them you're interested. Most people in the field will be glad to find someone who wants to talk with them about it given how few people outside of it know what we do.  During my rotations I asked as many questions as I could about the labs I was in, as well as what the surrounding market was like. I showed all of my instructors my work ethic and enthusiasm, and when I found a lab that I liked where I got along well with the techs and felt like I was a good fit, I expressed my interest in working there. They walked me through the hiring process and were able to lean on HR to fast-track my application. The timing worked out well - they were about to lose a few techs to maternity leave, transfers and retirement - but I don't think I would've had nearly as much 'luck' had I not taken some initiative."

I've had opportunities to move to first in the two years since then, but I honestly like this schedule better(and it gives a slight pay increase over days).   As for what you can find as a new grad: Where I work, the new positions that don't get taken by internal moves are usually third shift, occassionally second. I vaguely recall that pattern holding when I started job searching - most postings were third shift, some were second, very rare to see first.  There were also a lot of part-time openings, because most people take them to get a foot in the door for full-time work & few people want to transfer into one.

At the very least you can sell them back for what you paid for them, which you can't do with renting.

When I studied for the BOC I used my class notes instead. My lab also has the reference texts.  Have you tried to buy them used from bigwords.com and then selling them back using the buyback function on that site? I have done so for many classes (assuming its not a really obscure text) and it has a great search engine both for selling and buying. That way you might still be able to get some money back.   I know it sucks that new editions get put out yearly but sometimes it's worth asking the instructor if an older edition will suffice.

It's the 17th edition of the AABB technical manual, it's black and hardcover.

One girl who sat behind me would sit on the very edge of her chair to the point where no one could walk between us and I was smashed against my desk to give people any prayer of being able to walk through. When I finally asked if she could scoot her chair in a little bit she stopped talking to me.  I wish I could say this is an extreme but the laboratory will have similar people. There will be people who get mad if you don't load reagents their way or restock their way or prioritize testing their way. At the end of the day your way (as long as testing is done properly, SOPs are followed, etc) is what you make it. Working in a lab you will ruffle feathers and you will have your feathers ruffled. Just be the bigger person as much as you can and pick your battles. Good luck, the school portion is rough and when you get to the main lab you will again go through a series of handholding and having people watch you do all the procedures and scrutinize you and then you will do it again when you get trained :D but its ok, eventually you will be flying solo and that will rock."

For example, I'll run the CMP on a patient, then pass that specimen off to another tech to run immunoassays. Or, I'll run a CBC and either myself or another tech will make a slide and perform a manual diff.  There are times when you'll start a test that somebody else will take over.

That said, for the ones that do take that much work, you'll most likely be doing all of them on your own.  As with your HIV example, in a sentinel clinical lab, it's usually an immunoassay screen. You make sure your calibrations and controls are in, and know that you have the reagents and supplies to complete the test, then run it. That's about it. All the mixing of reagents and timing and incubation and all that are handled by the analyzer.  We know that passing work from tech to tech, or even having any tech doing manual work invites mistakes. That's part of why automation is so big in our industry. We can count on that analyzer to do the same thing the same way almost every time."

I still feel defeated when I miss a hard patient (and I've been doing phlebotomy for 10 years now). That feeling may never go away,  sorry.  A 6 month probationary is pretty common in health care.....give yourself that long and then if your still not feeling comfortable,  ask for some more training.  In regards to feedback on your skills,  I think it's hard to give feedback on phlebotomy. ..your success is determined by whether it not you get sufficient blood in the tubes. I've never met a prefectly successful phlebotomy, don't be so hard on yourself after 4 days."
medlabprofessionals,3b00pj,samiMPH,1 point,Wed Jun 24 22:42:14 2015 UTC,"That makes me feel better that I'm not alone when I feel awful after I miss a stick.   The only thing I'm worried about is that I feel like they are no longer training me and I'm just working on my own unless I specifically ask for help. I mean I'm getting better at easy/semi tricky sticks but the patients that are just really sick or old are troubling me and I don't feel like I'm learning from my misses. I guess I'm just scared of that saying, ""practice doesn't make perfect, perfect practice makes perfect"" and that I won't improve through just repetition but through corrections only.   Are there any tips or resources that you could recommend for me to help me improve hitting difficult veins?"
medlabprofessionals,3b00pj,arbivark,2,Wed Jun 24 23:24:58 2015 UTC,"You will improve through repetition. It's like learning how to hold a pencil and write when you're a kid. It takes precision, hand/eye coordination, fine motor skills, and focus. Learning how to write took a lot of practice and was not perfect at the beginning. Any fine motor skill you try to develop will take time and tedious practice (ask anyone who's learned to knit, tie flies, insert IVs, done heart surgery). orclev87, below, has good advice, too. Take your time and pay attention to how veins feel; you'll soon learn how decent veins act & feel. When I feel a vein that feels like a scantily filled long, skinny water balloon, it's my vein of choice."

It took me about 2 years before I had enough confidence in myself to go after the veins that no one else could get. But, some days if I miss one person that means I will miss the next 2 out of 5. If my head is just not in the game and I am rushing things, I start missing more and more. Just walk into the room like you are the best thing the world has to offer and you will do just fine. It is all about confidence and taking your time to find the best veins. Some times it takes me a half hour just to get blood from a patient. If you can't find a vein throw on a hot pack or two."

medlabprofessionals,3b00pj,xploeris,1 point,Wed Jul 1 23:38:58 2015 UTC,"Oh my gosh, I felt awful during my phlebotomy clinicals. When we learned to stick in class, we were only allowed to practice on each other with straight needles because our instructor had some big issues with butterflies, so once I was out in the real world I had no idea how to use the butterfly needles at all and it felt like my clinical instructors were annoyed and didn't want to teach me...  Once I got past that hurdle and I started getting the hang of it though, things got better.    I feel like I didn't feel 100% competent until I'd been working at my actual job as a phlebotomist for a few months though, tbh.  I knew what I was doing, but my clinicals were all in an outpatient setting, so all of those patients had pretty good veins for the most part.  Even now after drawing blood for years, I feel like we all have our good days and our bad days.  It really just takes practice.  Take your time with the harder patients, and don't feel like you have to find a vein right away, and don't stick until you've found something that you think will work.  You just have to get used to what some of the trickier veins feel like and how they behave. :)"
medlabprofessionals,3b00pj,cutelabnerd,1 point,Thu Jun 25 02:34:50 2015 UTC,"Yes, this is normal.  The #1 thing you need to be good at phlebotomy is LOTS of practice. If you have poor technique, or aren't familiar with the zillion ways you can attempt to locate a suitable vein, some coaching can help, but no one can teach your fingers to be sensitive or give you radar to know exactly how far in to insert the needle. And yes, it is hard when you're the weak link in the chain, slowing everyone down. If it makes you feel any better, the hospital was aware that this would happen when they agreed to take you on.  If you're trying to get blood from every patient you see, whether you're confident you can hit their vein or not, a 50-75% success rate is in the right ballpark for a student, I think.  My phlebotomy clinical rotation lasted about 3 1/2 weeks. This was intended to give students enough time to complete 100 successful draws. I got placed at a very busy clinic and did nearly 500. 100 isn't enough, IMO; I did about 200 before I felt like I really had my routine down and felt okay about sticking needles in innocent strangers who were also paying for competent medical care, and around 300-400 I felt like my ability to find veins was improving. The last two days of my rotation, I deliberately pushed myself to do the difficult patients in order to build my confidence; sometimes even the experts just have to poke and pray.   a lot of the time I get compliments from patients but when they are a hard stick I just feel defeated.   Yeah, that's exactly how it is. You're a hero one minute and a failure the next."

medlabprofessionals,3awhf0,penguin_zombie8888,5,Wed Jun 24 01:40:40 2015 UTC,"For ASCLS membership it's kind of like what you put into it is what you receive. I have been an ASCLS member for about a year and a half(just renewed my membership as an FYP). I like ASCLS because they are the voice of the lab and all the professionals in the lab. Starting at the end of July I will even be sitting on the Government Affairs Committee for the next year.   ASCLS is also good for networking opportunities. I have attended their Annual Meeting and the Legislative Symposium the past year and the experience was fantastic! Especially the Annual Meeting when you get to go see the Clinical Lab Expo and see the new up and coming instrumentation from the big name companies and the smaller companies out there. If you've ever thought about being a traveling Med Tech (like I have) recruiters will come to the Expo and you will be able to talk them about assignments, benefits, and what experience they want you to have before you can apply. As I said your ASCLS membership is what you make of it. I use mine to network and really get behind what ASCLS is trying to do for the lab (especially on the political side)"
medlabprofessionals,3awhf0,Zodnick11,3,Wed Jun 24 03:13:52 2015 UTC,"Very much agree. I joined as a student because my program comped memberships for all of us and I was fortunate enough to win a travel grant to attend the national meeting last year in Chicago. It was really excellent. ASCLS is a great community and they are an active voice for our profession in government. They take several people to Washington, DC every year to talk with our representatives about the laboratory and its role in medicine. They are even working on a partnership with American Medical Association and other groups.  Depending on where you live you likely have a state branch that will get together occasionally for state meetings. I am serving several roles in my state and I was appointed to the National Political Action Committee starting in July.  If you have the opportunity to come to a national meeting I highly recommend it, there is just something cool about being in a place with so many other med tech who you can socialize with, network with, drink with, and just have a good time with."

medlabprofessionals,3awkgf,beebeezing,2,Wed Jun 24 02:06:34 2015 UTC,"Until a month ago, I worked in a moderately large microbiology lab that, for about a year and a half, had been using the Biomerieux MALDI-TOF in routine work.  Volume-wise, our weekdays averaged 275 urine, 40 sputum/tracheal, 70 non-sterile, 50 sterile, and 5-25 positive blood cultures.     Statistically speaking, it made the biggest difference in identifying yeast; our TAT from isolation to identification dropped in half, but our bacterial identification time also improved significantly.      On the bacterial side of things, it is/was quite useful in identifying Actinomyces, Aerococcus (we had to independently validate urinae), S. saprophyticus in urines, and a decent number of the alpha Streps, among other things.  The most notable areas of difficulty were beta Streps other than B (it couldn't separate C and G and occasionally struggled with A), the infamous non-lactose fermenting E. coli/Shigella differentiation, a few other split species-level ID's for enterics, and it was almost too specific on Coryneforms, so we only worried about jeikeium and left the rest as Corynebacterium after a Gram stain and catalase.  Overall, I thought it was a big help, it sped up ID's in general and was a very nice tool to fall back on when seemingly straightforward things went awry.  It brought to light some ID issues we were unaware of, primarily in the Pseudomonas family and the coag-positive non-aureus Staphs where we were misidentifying organisms based on limited testing.     In terms of workflow, we settled on having the person who set up our sensitivity testing take care of daily QC and the first few runs, and then had pairs of workbenches set up slides together throughout the day.  The only exception was that the mycologist handled all yeast; they need formic acid in addition to the standard matrix, but we didn't use much formic acid and it expired 2 weeks after opening so we would only have one vial open at a time.  The person responsible for the culture would then take care of reviewing and releasing the identification.     A few other notes: we had to have ours remotely calibrated every other week, but according to our reps, we were a bit of an oddball lab on that front.  You HAVE to keep spot tests and Gram stains as part of the work-up, with my best example of why being a case where the MALDI-TOF generated an ID of 92+ (over 90 is considered acceptable) of Listeria grayii in a urine culture on a female of child-bearing age, when in reality it was Aerococcus viridans by full biochemicals (and Gram stain).  There were several other instances in which a satisfactory yet clearly incorrect ID was generated.  On the other hand, it could ID things like Burkholderia gladioli and other bizarre organisms that we had to look up information on to verify the ID.     I'd be happy to try to answer any other questions you may have or clarify things!"
medlabprofessionals,3awkgf,wfemec,1 point,Thu Jun 25 22:51:21 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the detailed information! I'm going to bombard you with some questions, hopefully it's not too much.  For the most part I'm going to focus on urines because that is also our highest volume culture and is what I'm concerned about in terms of workflow (how many techs do you have on a day per bench?). I can see how this is a great method for identifying the more bugs that may require additional isolation and longer periods of growth, more extensive testing to identify, as well as for bloods and sterile sites to get the most rapid results out to the physician. However, for the standard urine workups, I wonder if it is actually cost-effective and efficient to be using the MALDI when the majority of UTI's are EC that can be identified with lactose fermentation/beta hemolysis/indole.   Maybe it depends on the patient population as well, since as a tertiary care hospital that serves off-sites we get a mix of the community EC's that are pretty sensitive to the resistant ones- what I'm getting at is that, physicians already treat empirically, and the sensitivity is what they're really looking for down the line. As bacteria gets more resistant the profiles will only get less predictable. Our sensitivities take a day to come out together with most of our ID's. I would say less than ten percent of urine cultures come up with exceptions that need additional testing like API. In that case, using the MALDI as backup would cut ID time down by a day at least.   So it seems like it would be more time consuming for the tech to be setting up both sensitivity and spotting a target for every single positive urine culture, as opposed to using it as the backup. We don't have nearly as many cultures for the other benches, so it would be less of a concern. Additionally, the potential for mislabeling or swapping a spot target is much greater when dealing with that many cultures. It seems like setting up that target, running the MALDI, having the ID and sensi interface and checking that everything looks ok will take up to twice the amount of time per culture than it did before, all so the physician can know the organism sooner but still have to wait for the sensitivity to come out the next day?  Correct me if I’m wrong at any point, and I don’t mean to come across as resistant to new technology- in fact, I’m really excited about using it and just saved a bunch of work on a recent poor growing bug! But I want to think about how to best adapt the technology to a workflow that is already taxing for the tech and complicated by the implementation of a new and bug-riddled EHR.  Don’t even get me started on getting the MALDI to interface with the system for our sensitivities and our LIS… We plan to implement MALDI bench by bench, so any advice would be great since I want to be actively involved in developing the workflow once we come around to urines.   Each bench is supposed to have its own target and then the person setting up the sensitivities will also run the MALDI once the bench is ready. It usually takes the urine tech much longer than the other benches to finish doing setups, so I am wondering if, instead of spotting everything to a target AND setting it up for sensis, only the less common organisms get sent in, as well as anything that doesn’t work out on our old ID system. Our EC’s work out well for the most part, even the non-lactose fermenting ones (and this would circumvent the issue of MALDI not differentiating EC and Shigella). So things like straightforward LACF/beta/indole EC, LACF/nonbeta/indole probable EC, and non-LACF oxidase neg indole positives should not get MALDI. As well as obvious swarming Proteus and Pseudo Aerug. But we should run MALDI for things like Staph- to quickly differentiate saprophyticus and other CNS which we don’t do sensis on, Enterococcus to differentiate the faecium/faecalis and intrinsically VANR Enterococci, and Aerococcus urinae (the biggest reduction in time, only we don’t have the MALDI validated for GPOS or yeast yet…). We use PathoDex for our beta streps so I guess using the MALDI would only cut down on a day of isolation if it is heavily mixed on day 1. Our experienced techs call presumptive C albicans based on the wet prep and feet on colonies.  ALso, you mentioned that you have to keep gram stains as part of the workup. Does that mean for every one of your urines you need to perform a gram? Or is it for the non-gram negatives? What kind of plates do you culture your urines on?   I definitely need to learn a lot more about how MALDI makes determinations on how good a match the peaks are to the organisms in the database. It seems like it is using one measure to make a determination as opposed to using the combination of multiple different biochemical tests and calculating off of that instead."
medlabprofessionals,3awkgf,wfemec,1 point,Fri Jun 26 01:46:20 2015 UTC,"For urines, we had one tech for new urine cultures and one for old; a separate tech was responsible for setting up all the automated sensitivity testing.  They were plated to both a BAP and a MAC, which was advantageous in that one plate could be sent for sensitivity testing and another could be used for the ID work-up (anecdotally, we found that most Gram negatives seemed to ID better off of the BAP, but it wasn't a huge or proven difference).  Gram stains were just for the non-Gram negatives.  We did not use the MALDI to ID presumptive E. coli, we went with our existing protocol of indole/LF/inoculating to a Chromagar for those (if we were suspicious of K. oxytoca due to morphology, we would do the MALDI, but it was usually E. coli).  It seems like you are thinking to use it for urines very similarly to the way we did - just for the more unusual things and for the Gram positives where the ID drives treatment.  We really liked it for the CNS vs. saprophyticus differentiation, for ID'ing Group B (we realized that previously we were missing some morphologically unusual ones there, such as the flat/non-hemolytic/dry ones and the very rare alpha ones), and for Aerococci.  It did lead to some issues of too much information being available, such as one time when someone sent a presumptive Lactobacillus that came out as Bifidobacterium and lead to some pondering over what to call it.  In general though, it was very nice to be able to say ""I'm not sure what this is, but I have 2 colonies so I can try to MALDI it and then subculture it if that fails"".     According to the rep we had, the resistance patterns shouldn't affect the ID much, as they look at specific proteins that should not change with resistance changes.  For example, S. aureus would ID regardless of it's oxacillin status, including non-MecA oxacillin-resistant strains.  However, some clinicians would assume that an ID of S. aureus without a sensitivity report implied it was oxacillin-sensitive (or the an Enterococci was not VRE) so we had to do some education on that front.     In terms of how we brought it online, we started with bloods/steriles as the ID's there are much more important to patient outcomes and because their workload allowed it to be worked in more easily.  Yeast were brought online across the board very early on as well once we realized how good it was at ID'ing them.  I think wounds was next, followed by respiratories, and then urines.     The interfacing was a big job and required a lot of work, but I was not involved in it so I can't speak to it much.  I do know that we were somewhat lucky in that we had Vitek for sensitivities and ID's so they had built the appropriate interface for that (Myla).      In terms of the identification being based off of one measure, that is true to an extent, but it would not try to ID organisms if it did not have enough peaks (i.e. individual proteins) or if the peaks were not strong enough.  We kept some spot tests to go along with all MALDI ID's (except for yeast) which allowed us to question unusual results and pursue them further.  Also, as more data is generated and organisms change, the database is updated so the ID's get better without the instrument changing.  While it wasn't perfect and definitely caused some stress for those validating it and responsible for handling issues as they arose, I felt that it was definitely an improvement and a beneficial tool to have."

medlabprofessionals,3antd6,penguin_zombie8888,3,Mon Jun 22 01:06:03 2015 UTC,"Nights: I like nights, but I couldn't adjust to the sleep schedule. There are fewer people around, which can be a blessing and a curse. You have more responsibility and independence.  Night shift often does maintenance because it is slower. You get to see (and deal with) all the weird stuff because there isn't anyone else to ask.  The shift differential is nice, and socially it isn't too bad because you sleep while everyone else is at work and have evenings free to spend time with friends. You also have the option to stay up and get things done after work like grocery shopping and dentist appointments.   Evenings: I don't like evenings. Socially it is awful. You're at work when everyone is out getting dinner and drinks after work. If your significant other works a normal shift you'll never see them because you'll be asleep when they leave in the morning, and gone when they get home from work. The work itself isn't too bad, usually evening shift has younger techs, and it isn't as busy as day shift.   Days: It is the easiest to have a normal social life if you work days. It usually has the oldest techs. There are lots of people on day shift - all your managers and lead techs. It is nice if you have a question or a problem, but you can't read a book or anything when it is slow. You have more visibility on day shift which is nice if you want to be considered for other positions (lead tech, tech specialist, POC coordinator).    This might have been my specific location, but day shift seemed to be more segregated (chemistry people only did chem, blood bankers only did blood bank, no one helped out the phlebotomists and processors) and it kinda sucked.  The off-shifts were more cohesive and less cliquey."
medlabprofessionals,3antd6,curryramen,7,Mon Jun 22 14:20:09 2015 UTC,"Here's my thing for night shift, we are a little weird because the rest of the lab does 8 hour shifts but we do 10 hour shifts to get some more over lap for certain housekeeping duties.  Pros; we make more money, working night.  This is due to bargaining power (if you know how to talk it up) but for most people due to the dif.  Here we make $3.50/hr for normal dif, then on weekend it's an extra $3/hr.  We learn a lot more, though we have ""lead techs"" and ""supervisors"" on our shift there are 5 people who are on nights, so there is a lot more personal responsibility.  We interact a lot more with the floor staff and have to help guide practice and answer questions about product usage, either that or wake up the resident.  We also do some more special testing for coag that the one time we called the resident to talk to the doc with questions the resident calls us to ask the question we passed on to them.  So we try not to call the resident unless it's a break in protocol that we need to get approved.  It lets us learn a lot having to be able to answer those questions. All the night shift people I work with are between 25-29, so we also get along very well.  Though not on a day shift we are still able to live somewhat normal lives because we don't go to work until 10 PM, so I can still have time to hang out before work or go out to events.  Since we work 10's we get 3 days off in a row frequently.  Sometimes it's two, rarely it's 1.   This is really just specific to where I work but 10's are nice (though I'd do 12's if I could) cause you can take 8 days of vacation and only use 20 hrs of PTO.  Last real pro is sometimes it's so slow you can do any home or school work while at work. Actual last pro, traffic here sucks all times that are not night shift.  Cons; because there are fewer of us we have to work a lot of weekends, about every other weekend but we do it more of a month on, month off thing.  That kinda sucks if you want to drink on a friday night but have to go to work, you can hang for a bit but have to be gone by 930.  Depends on your friends if this works or not.  Also scheduling gets annoying with weekend activities being popular as you get older.  Nights off where you don't have plans or things to keep you busy kinda suck in this town, I mostly stay up and watch netflix/ work on the house, but if the girlfriend is on day shift I can't work on the house.  Last thing is night shift may not be the busy all the time, but when there's two techs and several bleeders/traumas/critical babies it can get very busy really easily, and there are whole nights where you just run around.  My fitness tracker logged 5 miles one night, and all our stuff is just in 1 room.  Just a heads up about evening shift, it sucks for your social life.  No one wants to hang out when you get off (In my area there's usually nothing to do around midnight).  It's nice to be able to do things in the afternoon before work and be awake for normal phone calls during business hours, but the lack of a social life sucks."
medlabprofessionals,3antd6,Cut_the_dick_cheese,2,Mon Jun 22 03:19:36 2015 UTC,"I agree with some of what you said here and I'll add on to some points.  Working 10 hours a night has its advantages and disadvantages. In the core lab, everyone (except one person), have a schedule in which they all get 6 days off in a row. Downside to that is that the younger people get the schedule in which they have to work 3 fridays, and only get 1 friday off during their 6 days off, and they have to work 6 days in a row before they get their 6 days off. The senior staff have the privilege of working the maximum of 5 days in a row, get 6 days off in a row, AND only working 2 fridays a month. After a while, you just get used to it. The problem is that in the core lab, Wednesdays are usually overstaffed so we'll have 1 to 2 floaters (this may be good and bad), Thursdays and Fridays are running in a minimum, so that it's harder to get time off.  Your social life is really up to you to handle. After a work night, I stay up late until noon before I go to sleep. I use that time to hang out with people from evening shifts, go to class, or do some errands. Despite working night shift, I've been able to go to the gym every day, mountain biking every weekend, wash cars, and go for a drive. I don't know if its healthy, but during my days off, I switch my sleeping schedule back to sleeping at night and operating during the day.  The good thing about night shift is that, depending on the days, you might be the only one who can do micro. Then, it's really up to you to make a judgement call, phone in the resident, the directors, and discuss a lot of stuff with them. The other good thing is that in the core lab, and micro, it's pretty predictable as far as workload goes. Some nights, it's crazy when the couriers are late, or if we have an instrument down, or if the LIS goes down. However, most nights, it's so predictable that you basically have a routine. Currently, micro nights are so chill that it's manageable by only one tech.  As far as learning goes, core lab and micro is really limited to what we can do outside of general testing. We don't do special coags, special heme, immunology, bacteriology, etc. We just do general heme, general chem, and accessioning micro. However, since you're usually running on limited staff, you're able to make more judgement calls without having to call upon lead techs and supervisors.  I agree somewhat about evening shift. When I was a student, I worked evening shift a lot. However, I had no social life because I liked to sleep in. Basically, I wake up just in time to go to work, then go home. I didn't really go out with that many people when I was a student. However, that was also because Richmond is a big city and I lived far away from most of my friends. Evening shift people in the core lab here tells a different story. We'd go out during the day before they go to work, and after I get off work. Some days, when I'm not working, they'd go out to a bar right down the street from the lab and I'd join them.  Without posting too much information, I can say that some nights are going to be better than other nights just based on the people who will be working that night.  The cool thing about working nights is that if you work a double shift, they will pay you night shift differential for those over time hours. So, if you work a full evening and a full night, 6 of those hours will be overtime, but they'll pay you 16 hours worth of night shift differential."
medlabprofessionals,3antd6,swollennode,2,Mon Jun 22 16:05:19 2015 UTC,"Days are pretty busy, high workload usually during the morning rush for us (we're a pretty big hospital with lots of clinics). On certain benches it tests your ability to work under high pressure (usually hematology, since we have a cancer clinic). But for me it usually does end up slowing down, and you  find time to do calibration/QC, daily/weekly/monthly maintenance, etc. There are more staff, more seniors, and you can always go to them for advice. For blood bank it depends on the luck of the draw. Some days are slower than others. Other days people leave their benches in other departments to help out. Usually day shift people will try to top up bulk/individual reagents and calibrate everything so that evening shift is ready to go.  Evenings slow down drastically, and that's when you might do some more non-major maintenance. It could also be left to nights, depending on where you work. Since there are less staff, you're usually always on your feet doing something, although the workload is not as high/stressful as day shifts. It's important to keep an eye on your incomplete list during off shift since you'll likely be moving around so much. Teamwork can be pretty important. If someone's busy reading a positive Betke you don't want to nag them about their hematology incomplete list. (Some people might still do it because in the end it is their ""responsibility"" but that's not how I roll) I personally like the workload and constant movement on evenings, but as others said, it's really bad for your social life.   I've only done one night shift yet and all I can say is it is very hard to adjust for.   As a side note, I generally find more wrong draws on off shifts (usually towards the end of evening shifts) so keep an eye out for that (MCV deltas within a close time frame)"
medlabprofessionals,3antd6,twgy,2,Mon Jun 22 17:05:08 2015 UTC,"Days is staffed appropriately at my hospital, people only work on one thing at a time, they can think about their work and focus. Evenings is the worst shift at my hospital. You get a diff ($3 / hr evenings, $2 more for weekends, Friday after 4 PM is considered weekend). It is short staffed and they've made it clear that appropriate staffing is not a priority and it is causing me to be very burnt out. Nights is a little better, I think. Evenings at my hospital sucks from the standpoint of inheriting absolute chaos. An average of three techs will report to you about their individual benches and you have to cover all three of them, so all their instrument issues and everything fall in your lap and they're gone by 30 minutes into your shift. Everyone on 12 hour lab cycles (a good number of inpatients) is collected again at 4 PM, so those samples start to flood in, and most of our outpatient clinic drops begin around that time, which usually include 50+ samples per department. You have to hunt down everything that is missing. Eventually, you get on top of it and get it under control. But basically, day shift hates us because they think we are lazy / have it easy. Night shift hates us because we might leave one diff pending when we go home.  For the most part, no one actually hates us, it just feels that way.  Nights is hard to adjust to the sleep schedule, but you can still have a social life - you just have to do it on nights you don't work. Evenings, though, you can't have a social life. I go to work when everyone else I know gets off work, and I get home when they've all gone to bed. It can lead to some serious isolation.  EDIT: The workflow of days is: inherit morning run but also a huge number of staff, have lots of maintenance and paperwork to do, but have several people in your department and able to take a lunch and at least one 15 minute break. Evenings inherits absolute chaos and short staffing, you may get a lunch most nights, but rarely not. And nights inherits a polished and quiet ship and leaves after morning run plunges the lab into chaos."

medlabprofessionals,3anoti,RollingInTheD,21,Mon Jun 22 00:22:34 2015 UTC,Please put the label on straight and on the side that's ALREADY covered so I can see the blood in the tube for volume and hemolysis. It's a drag having to tediously peel labels and reprint them all night in a busy stat lab.
medlabprofessionals,3anoti,pg13wodehouse,3,Mon Jun 22 02:53:56 2015 UTC,"To add on to this, don't cover the bottle label with the patient sticker. We use those in micro when a bottle goes positive."
medlabprofessionals,3anoti,AnarchoPunx,2,Mon Jun 22 16:42:41 2015 UTC,Haha tell me about it. I make a point of applying labels the same place every time: over the label section and so you can clearly see the levels in the tube. Then when I get a collect I have to process from a nurse or doctor who has hurriedly slapped the label diagonal and it's covering the whole tube... just great haha
medlabprofessionals,3anoti,pg13wodehouse,6,Mon Jun 22 03:16:42 2015 UTC,"slapped the label diagonal and it's covering the whole tube   Every. Night. I get that hemolysis and short samples happen, especially in the ER. I don't hold that against anyone at all since drawing blood can be very tough and I suck at it--but ANYONE can put a label on correctly in 2 seconds. It's ridiculous."
medlabprofessionals,3anoti,AllyGambit,6,Mon Jun 22 03:46:20 2015 UTC,Coag if you get a sodium citrate that is wallpapered with too many labels you can bet your bottom dollar that the sample is going to be short

medlabprofessionals,3anoti,twgy,12,Wed Jun 24 15:41:38 2015 UTC,"If you're collecting blood and have trouble finding a vein, I find that (while having the patient keep a clenched fist), gently bending their elbow in reduces some of the tension from muscles in the area and that can help you find a good vein. Then once you have found a vein, return the arm to the level you will collect at, and gently rotate the wrist left and right while repalpating: that can also help plump up the vein, making it more accessible while the wrist is rotated at different positions."
medlabprofessionals,3anoti,ChainsawMLT,4,Mon Jun 22 00:28:30 2015 UTC,Make sure the baby microtubes are mixed well. Sometimes you can invert and the blood doesn't actually roll against the wall. We get a lot of clotted baby tubes to the point where the first thing we do when we receive one is check for clots. And then we're told that we put the clot in.
medlabprofessionals,3anoti,Solataire,2,Mon Jun 22 17:12:05 2015 UTC,"If you're collecting the blood then make sure you're also collecting enough. If you anticipate a very difficult bleed use smaller SST's: using a small syringe with a slow pull I find usually works for those spidery veins on the century old grandma. As for patients with, er, copious adipose deposits, tight tournequet and bend the elbow in slightly to begin with to help find a vein, and palpate with a bit more pressure to try and find deeper veins (Good thing about those bleeds is usually they don't notice if you have to poke around slightly).  But there are definitely some tests that if you don't have enough blood you will need to recollect - sodium citrate tubes definitely, lithium heparin tubes: in general I collect as much as I can unless the patient is uncooperative e.g. young kid squirming or looking feint."
medlabprofessionals,3anoti,orclev87,2,Mon Jun 22 05:54:49 2015 UTC,"Don't be afraid to use a discard tube.  You'd be surprised how many times this will prevent your other tubes from becoming hemolyzed.  Also, don't use a syringe or a butterfly.  I would guess-timate that most of the clotted/hemolyzed/bad samples I have received over the years are because people don't want to to a straight stick.  Butterflies are for people who suck at phlebotomy."
medlabprofessionals,3anoti,orclev87,2,Mon Jun 22 11:18:55 2015 UTC,I stopped using butterflies as soon as I finished training  Edit: mobile reddit fails me. I hate butterflies: I like being able to control the needle. Syringes I like for harder bleeds because I can apply less pulling pressure and keep the vein from collapsing. I once assisted a doctor with a paediatric bleed and watched her massacre this poor kids arm. 6 or 7 attempts with the same needle
medlabprofessionals,3anoti,Solataire,1 point,Mon Jun 22 11:29:21 2015 UTC,What about morbidly obese people?  I used to use 25 gauge needles to get into the small surface veins. Easier than trying to find the bigger ones beneath their flesh sometimes.
medlabprofessionals,3anoti,internettrashcat,2,Mon Jun 22 14:24:45 2015 UTC,"I only have 21 and 23 gauge needles where I work sadly. Most of the time i can find a deep vein on them, I just usually spend a good 5 - 10 mins looking up and down both arms and back of hands. Taking the extra time I've found usually helps. Heat packs help a bit too"

The VA seemed to be much more lax about having experience than my university hospital.    They didn't let me do any tests, I mainly took specimens to the department they needed to be in and centrifuged them if needed.  They were always happy to teach me about the tests and go through interesting difs with me on the teaching scope.  I learned a lot through this experience and honestly loved the VA and if I had a chance I would absolutely work there.

medlabprofessionals,3ah2s6,higmage,14,Sat Jun 20 02:59:17 2015 UTC,Hopefully you atleast explained it to the nurse and ways to prevent hemolysis. It's odd nurses don't learn proper phlebotomy since they do it so often but it's better for the patient that techs inform them how to do it properly.
medlabprofessionals,3ah2s6,dacrocyte,9,Sat Jun 20 03:05:34 2015 UTC,I work at a college with a nursing program and those students never get to practice Phlebotomy.  As the Phlebotomy program manager this blows my mind since I know those kids will be expected to know how anyway.  I have managed to get the program to set least let the students have a one day seminar with me before they graduate. It's nuts.
medlabprofessionals,3ah2s6,AuntieChiChi,2,Sat Jun 20 03:18:44 2015 UTC,"Hm. When I was in the Army we used to practice needle sticks on each other or we'd get the infantry guys to ""volunteer"". Needless to say, we got pretty good at the whole phlebotomy thing. Too bad nurses can't or won't do it while in school. Safety concerns I guess :P"
medlabprofessionals,3ah2s6,anonymous_coward69,6,Sat Jun 20 04:14:45 2015 UTC,"Bah. My first draw ever was on a classmate, theirs was on me - and there were no fake arms or oranges or any of that bullshit to start with, just a few dry runs with the cap on.  Was a bit terrifying but we all got through it and most of us found veins on the first try.  And then we had to do it again. And again. You think the school is going to pay for fresh blood for lab periods when students are carrying around gallons of it for free?  The other week, my girlfriend went in for outpatient surgery under anesthesia, and I got to watch the preop nurse try to get the IV in and hit nearly everything in her hand except the lumen of the goddamn vein. (She must have nicked it, though, cause she ended up causing a pretty good hematoma. Nicked a bunch of little nerves, too, judging from my girlfriend's twitching and fighting back tears.) Her technique was clumsy and barbaric. Do they just not bother to fix veins at all? I was this close to speaking up when my vagus nerve finally sucker punched me. I'm told the anesthesiologist finally did the IV placement himself (and did a great job).  I seriously can't believe nurses don't get more phlebotomy training."
medlabprofessionals,3ah2s6,xploeris,13,Sat Jun 20 05:09:55 2015 UTC,"I recently did a pre-employment health screen... the nurse coughed into her hand, put on a glove, cleaned the site for venipuncture, then ripped the finger off her glove and palpated the cleaned area. Then she didn't anchor the vein and used only 2 fingers to hold the needle, and then complained that my veins are just terrible.  ... I'm calling them to let them know their nurse has no concept of aseptic technique."

Question you might be able to answer: at one point you mention in a reply that haemolysis occurs as a result of inproper collection rather than time between collection and testing - which I agree with. But through my experience as a phlebotomist, I've thought that the longer a sample goes unspun (where it requires centrifugation), the more likely that sample is going to come out haemolysed? As I work with a centrifuge I spin samples within 15 - 30 mins of collection, and I know things like glucose tests require that the sample does not sit unspun for any longer than that, but when comparing a sample I've collected fresh and spun within 30 mins and a sample a doctor may have collected earlier in the morning or even the night before and allowed to stand unspun, there is generally a level of haemolysis.  If you know anything about what might cause this can you comment? I'm pretty curious. I'm hoping I'll be able to work in a laboratory setting soon and am generally curious."

Anything even over an hour would be considered unusual and that is in all the hospital settings I've worked in.  Samples do get lost in the tube system, get delayed, etc.. and every time they were still fine."

If there's a glucose it has to be recollected. Maybe they're just crap at collecting and that's why most of their samples are haemolysed when I spin them in the morning"

So if the patient is one of those types, it takes us about 5-10 mins to tag it up and send. If they're B or AB, it usually takes us 30 mins to thaw and tag it up. If we don't have a type on file, we'll usually call to tell them we need a type on the patient and see if they have time to wait for that to be done then thaw. I've not really experienced too much flak about it, nothing that communication doesn't resolve. Worst comes to worst, we can give out up to 4 A plasma regardless of the patient's type in emergency situations then switch over to AB or type specific, but we never withhold product if it is an emergency. We also don't have TATs published on our website anymore except for XMs and emergency release."
medlabprofessionals,3aeptp,tomatoesandchicken,1 point,Fri Jun 19 15:35:51 2015 UTC,"Has your facility ever timed the length of time from when the order is received to the time it is issued? Our thaw bath is set at 37C and takes 25mins to thaw a normal 300ml unit. Bigger volume units occasionally require a few more mins to thaw.   Between researching the patient, getting units in the thaw bath, 25 mins to thaw, then getting units out and tagged literally just took me exactly 35 minutes to complete.  That's if nothing else went wrong.   Does your facility use a different method for thawing the plasma or is 30 mins just a rough estimate? My lab director wants us to research turnaround times in an effort to provide the nursing staff with an exact number. This is despite our repeated attempts to convey that it will never be this best case scenario. If anything else is going on, we only staff one person in BB and they have to prioritize, it is going to take a little longer.  Sorry for the rant. It's become a huge frustration."
medlabprofessionals,3aeptp,tomatoesandchicken,2,Fri Jun 19 16:08:25 2015 UTC,"30 mins in an estimate, depends on the size of unit and how busy we are. It's rarely less than 30. We have 2 waterbaths and 1 waterless thawer,  both take about the same time. Depending on how your LIS is set up, you could look up to see when units were requested by the floor and when they were actually issued to get your data. I'd stress to them that it's a minimum 25-30 to thaw and that the rest depends on the staffing in the BB, and give a time range like 30-60 mins. It's almost impossible to say it with always take X amount of time,  every time.  Do you keep a thawed inventory?

Because hospitals are generally not for profit, any surplus funding has to go straight back into the hospital for things like facility improvements and training, rather than back to employees or investors."

medlabprofessionals,3a8yhq,hoangtudude,1 point,Thu Jun 18 19:12:04 2015 UTC,"There are quite a lot of checks before blood is actually issued to the floor. If you really messed up usually the LIS can flag you. Barcodes and computers are beautiful.  I haven't participated in a MTP yet, but from what I read and hear from others, usually the adrenaline carries you through it.   That being said, I don't know anyone that's messed up. Usually there are enough procedures, technologies and training that make techs feel safe and confident to work in BB. You probably know more than what you think you know.  But truthfully, you cannot go to work with that kind of mindset in any department. Are you implying that patient well-being cannot be compromised in other departments if you mess up once? Because that's not true. It's probably less likely, but again you cannot approach your work with that kind of attitude, that you have to pay more attention in one department than the other. That's just setting yourself up for failure/mistakes, one way or another."

medlabprofessionals,3a8yhq,psychicbagel,1 point,Thu Jun 18 09:42:09 2015 UTC,"In the uk you wouldn't come anywhere near jail time unless you actively and maliciously transfused an incompatible unit to a patient. Also it's hard to make mistakes in blood bank unless you are doing it wrong, most problems come from the nurses not checking for the correct patient etc.  In my opinion blood bank is the most rewarding place to work. You get satisfaction knowing you are directly saving a life, you get an intense adrenaline rush when you get major traumas, and it's also pretty damn interesting when you get patients with strange antibodies etc."
medlabprofessionals,3a8yhq,jsp132,1 point,Thu Jun 18 18:14:11 2015 UTC,"Well, I'm a generalist with shifts also in blood bank during the third shift.  For the hospital lab I work with, we have three notices before we are brought into the office for counseling.  Then there are more severe cases which fall into the FDA reportable offenses.  Those can be a varying offense from giving a wrong unit tag unit to a patient or not irradiating/ Leukoreducing a unit for a patient.  There are many more i'm sure but we have double checks for techs to make sure not many mistakes fall through.  It's a high stress job, one case in point someone came in for a MTP with a little e antibody.  e antibody has a prevalence of being compatible <2 percent of the time.  Long story short, the tech didn't crossmatch and read the results properly so there was a big hub bub due to the results.  If you like stress but thinking at the same time instead of the monotony it maybe for you.    Good luck"
medlabprofessionals,3a8yhq,Baton_Rouge,1 point,Thu Jun 18 05:02:55 2015 UTC,"We get our blood from another hospital. It's ABO/Rh tested there, then again when we receive it. Cross matches are done at least an immediate spin on those with negative antibody screen, through Coombs if there is an antibody (the unit will have been antigen tested first in this case). The LIS is going to flag ABO incompatibility if you tried. Upon issuing a second person checks tags/paperwork. Patient wristbands are scanned... Nurses will almost always call and ask why it's an O if the patient is another type. It would be very hard to screw up ABO which would be the worst transfusion reaction."
medlabprofessionals,3a75y8,newtothelyte,14,Wed Jun 17 19:29:47 2015 UTC,The two examples you mentioned seemed more like people being dicks than being sticklers for following procedures.  Yelling at the courier for not uncapping tubes? What a dick. Writing someone up for wearing a hoodie in a walk in cooler? What a dick.   I agree with a lot of these posts saying this job requires following strict rules and procedures to ensure accuracy and reliability. But you can still be a decent human being in the process.  Glad you've come across good people so you're not completely jaded with the field.   I'm leaving the only lab I've ever known to take a traveling tech job.

medlabprofessionals,3a75y8,digitalsea88,18,Thu Jun 18 00:26:09 2015 UTC,I imagine it's because the lab is a much more serious work environment than any of the others you mentioned. If anything I wish more people were careful and pedantic at my lab. Tired of careless people not worried about contamination and crap.   As for being pedantic about how things are done or given to them; it's because lab work is very standardized and by the protocol. Therefore it's very habitual as well.

They're not med techs trained to handle specimens more than just handing over the tubes. In my lab, the courier's job when they get to the lab is to hand over a big bag of specimen and sign it over to the techs. It's the tech's responsibility to sort and accession the specimens."

However, according to you:   Be a nurse if you want to be able to be flippant about care and have zero quality control.   In the context of the situation, the quality control that you're referring to isn't about running QC materials to ensure lab results are correct. The quality control you're referring to is quality assurance that the work you do followed the procedure. Trust me when I say that the lab isn't the only department in a hospital with a quality assurance plan to ensure the best outcome of the patient. Every department has one from nursing to surgery."

The lab can also be a high-stress work environment, and so many times what should be a polite request gets reduced to a snip because during stressful times people are not as good at thinking before they speak. Management can also have something to do with it - bad management allowing techs to get away with mistreating coworkers can make bad attitudes just snowball (just like in any other field!).  I've worked with people like the ones you've mentioned, and it sucks. Sometimes the lab can just be a perfect storm for people to act like dicks... but like you said, there are also a lot of great people. You take the good with the bad, I guess."

I send my manager up with a phlebotomist and they draw a third tube, manager brings it to the lab herself and supervises my third type in a lovely ""chain of custody"" type way. Yep, still Apos.

However,  MTs are more favored over MLTs if everything else is equal. The transition to MTs is as evident as the transition from any BS degree without a certification to only ascp certification holders."
medlabprofessionals,3a3epa,swollennode,2,Wed Jun 17 00:02:44 2015 UTC,"NJ MT lurker here. NJ has no shortage of BS techs so many places will prefer a BS to an AS. That said, there are still a few MLT job openings here and there in less desirable locations/off hours. Listings that list MLT and MLS will prefer MLS. A few years down the line, MLTs may be largely obsolete here in NJ.  A few examples:   Atlanticare: https://www.atlanticare.apply2jobs.com/ProfExt/index.cfm?fuseaction=mExternal.showJob&RID=10305&CurrentPage=3 In Camden: https://www.healthcaresource.com/lourdesnet/index.cfm?fuseaction=search.jobDetails&template=dsp_job_details.cfm&cJobId=100836&emid=3640   NY and PA still take MLTs. Or you can always move out of state.  Careerwise, there's a glut of 4-year MTs here in NJ (which also lowers the salary). And the Rutgers program produces 35-40 per year. There's also a lot of people who work an additional per-diem/part time job/2 jobs that takes up a lot of spots. There's also a ton of hospital consolidation, so most labs aren't growing, only replacing/have hire freezes. So expect fierce competition."
medlabprofessionals,3a3448,sodapopinski83,2,Tue Jun 16 21:15:34 2015 UTC,"I'm actually interested in the reverse scenario. Are there medical lab scientists that go on to research? Is there any additional education needed and what is the pay like working in research? Etc.. I really like techniques such as ELISA, electrophoresis, Blotting, PCR Etc and know the clinical lab does that but am interested in the lab research role as well"
medlabprofessionals,3a3448,MLS_K,1 point,Wed Jun 17 02:19:27 2015 UTC,"I did research for ten years before getting my med lab license.  All I needed was a biology degree.  The pay was significantly lower in research, but that's here in California.  It's quite possible that in other states the pay is comparable; maybe some others will chime in.  I like both research and the med lab... it's just cool to work in a lab and not be at a computer all day.  In research I liked the flexible hours, the sense of discovery, and the many seminars where we could learn about others' research.  In the clinical lab I like the fact that we turn out results every day and feel productive-- with research, the cutting-edge project you work on for months can end up not working well, but in the med lab you're doing proven procedures over and over again, and the quality control is much better."
medlabprofessionals,3a3448,oiboyz,2,Wed Jun 17 03:45:59 2015 UTC,"The low pay is a big driver for the switch. Also, the productivity. I like science a lot, but the institutional politics of big time research alongside the egos and ambition of a lot of the researchers have pushed me to the point where I'd be more interested in doing a days bench work, then being able to leave and not think about it. Have you enjoyed the transition?"
medlabprofessionals,3a3448,beebeezing,3,Wed Jun 17 13:08:32 2015 UTC,"I graduated with a BS in Biology and up until that point had experience mostly from internships and part time work in academic and industry research. Tissue culture, western blots, immunoassays, etc. I really didn't like the long term nature of the projects and the feeling that I wasn't having a direct, daily effect on anything. And I could see in my superiors how consumed they were by either the culture (academia) or the projects themselves (both academia and industry). I wanted a job that I could work at the bench, feel like I made a difference, and go home and do something else.   Right after graduating I did a post-bacc in MLS for Microbiology and got my M(ASCP). I was hired at my rotation site shortly after I finished the program and I have been working as a micro tech for a year.  It has been challenging and I certainly have to deal with a lot more of ""customer service"" type issues but I like the stability of following protocols instead of wondering ""why is X not working out? is it because of twenty different variables? how valid is this? Is this even a topic worth pursuing?"" etc. etc. There's still plenty of troubleshooting involved but there's a precedence for most things so I don't feel like I'm digging around in the dark.   Also, at least in my area there are plenty of other bio grads out there who had plans for post-grad or med/dent/etc school that are competing for the research positions. Especially since they depend on getting published. So the pay for research associates is much, much lower than starting salary for a new grad MT. Not to mention as a researcher you are competing with those that have MS, PhD's etc from a variety of fields, and practically everyone knows how to do good research. It's competitive.  TLDR Transitioning to clinical lab has been the best thing I have done so far. If I move on for a master's it would probably be for med informatics or public health/epidemiology."

I'd like to start off doing higher level bench work, more interested in molecular than anything, and maybe working my way up to management. Caveat: I may be using the incorrect terminology/jargon for the MLS field.

medlabprofessionals,3a3448,AeonCatalyst,1 point,Thu Jun 18 04:12:51 2015 UTC,"Here is the wage and vacancy information for 2013 for medical lab professionals. ASCP just sent emails asking for participation in the 2015 one.  http://labmed.ascpjournals.org/content/44/4/e97.full.pdf+html http://labmed.ascpjournals.org/content/44/1/e1.full.pdf+html You might be able to find information relevant to your area and wage expectations there. There is a shift differential if you work 2nd or 3rd, a whole other monster about the pros and cons of that one. I work 1st shift with a 40hr week and I pick up overtime when I can, we rotate every 5th weekend, 56k a year.  I think having publications isn't critical to acceptance in any program or employment but it is an addition to your resume. Having that laboratory background was an advantage for me in the sense that I was seeking employment as a ""new grad"" out of a less traditional program as opposed to the MLS bachelors, I only took the Micro part and am not a generalist. That's not as much of a concern at a large hospital with departments but will limit the number I can potentially work at. Also, knowing the basics of the other disciplines would help me a lot and I missed that not being a generalist.   So to start have you decided whether you want to go generalist or a specialist certificate? Your requirements to sit for the BOC will vary depending on what route you want to take and your experience (I think it would have to be clinical laboratory experience, for those who were 'grandfathered' in when MLS programs were more scarce).  http://www.ascp.org/Board-of-Certification/GetCertified  From there, you might be able to better research your options in terms of getting the appropriate coursework and clinical experience. You can go through a BS for MLS. Or a post-bacc for MLS, or a specific area. Or a one-year at a hospital. Or more options, it all depends. Are you willing to relocate? Would you be open to online education? (I took my post-bacc online during the last year I worked at a CRO and then left in time to do my rotation at a clinical site where an instructor I knew worked.) Oftentimes the hard part is getting into a clinical for the experience if you are not affiliated with any program that a hospital is already working with.   Depending on the healthcare facility/reference lab that you work at, structure, and workflow, your work will vary. There was another thread discussing workflow in reddit and you will see that there is a lot of variety. I don't really know what you mean by higher vs lower level bench work. In the hospital I work at there is a processing department and then Micro, Heme, BB, Chem/Special Chem, etc. But in Micro itself we have a separate processing section and all techs rotate through, so it's not like some techs are stuck doing the planting all the time. Once you start working there is a very long training period; regardless of how much you know during your schooling.   In terms of structure, we have techs, senior techs, senior tech ii's, a lab manager, and beyond that level is physician-run. There's not a lot of mobility. And to be honest, I wouldn't want to have to do what my manager is responsible for. I guess it depends on the personality and the system you work for."

I'd say the possibility of it being nocardia is slim because it's typically a slow grower, plus the gram stain should look beaded. Even though nocardia is actually gram positive it stains weakly. As far as your lab's 10 seconds for decolorizer, I agree it's probably too long. You can usually flood the slide then immediately rinse for it to do it's job. If you guys had access to the plates, giving a presumptive ID would be much easier, but since you guys send them out, I don't think I can offer much more advice."

medlabprofessionals,3a1l2m,sofo07,7,Tue Jun 16 14:49:30 2015 UTC,"A Health Affairs study comparing patient-satisfaction scores with HCAHPS surveys of almost 100,000 nurses showed that a better nurse work environment was associated with higher scores on every patient-satisfaction survey question. And University of Pennsylvania professor Linda Aiken found that higher staffing of registered nurses has been linked to fewer patient deaths and improved quality of health. Failure-to-rescue rates drop. Patients are less likely to die or to get readmitted to the hospital. Their hospital stay is shorter and their likelihood of being the victim of a fatigue-related error is lower. When hospitals improve nurse working conditions, rather than tricking patients into believing they’re getting better care, the quality of care really does get better.   It's amazing to me how simple the solution is, and how complicated management makes it.  Time and again, research proves that happy employees make great employees who will go above and beyond for their job. This is especially important in health care!"
medlabprofessionals,3a1l2m,Talkahuano,4,Tue Jun 16 15:07:38 2015 UTC,Making lab employees happy is never going to be a priority.

It truly is confounding to me that so many hospitals focus on the trickle-down effect of ""happy patient at all costs"" benefiting everything in the hospital; yet they never realize the fizzy bubble-over effect has much more positive yields.    Happy staff want to come to work, and that spills over into the patient interaction.  It comes across as genuine healthCARE and not scripted healthDONTcare.  Another problem is that if you have unhappy staff, any new ones you bring in likely catch that virus of malcontent and it squashes their morale before you can ever get their enthusiasm spread around."
medlabprofessionals,3a1l2m,shirrok,3,Thu Jun 18 02:39:30 2015 UTC,"We have a few lab assistants that transferred over from dietary and you'd be shocked at how much they have to bend and break doctors orders in order to ""satisfy the patient"". According to our HR department, the top 3 factors that play into patient satisfaction are cost, nursing staff, and food. Diabetic patients are given cake at will, cardiac and high blood pressure patients order fries and deli sandwiches all the time and if they don't get it, they complain like little bitches.   Even in the lab we face these issues. We have an outpatient drawing room at our lab and we've had patients whine and complain that they have to walk downstairs to admissions to get registered (which every single patient has to do). Of course the lab managers are spineless and cave in and make special exceptions. Shit pisses me off so much"

If it was a manual test, we would just replace the tube's original cap to keep it sealed (or if the cap was damaged, we'd take one from the robot). My current lab is very similar: either use the original cap or use a fresh cap from the robot's supply."

medlabprofessionals,39hmpr,saraithegeek,2,Sun Jun 14 04:16:09 2015 UTC,My point is that men experience sexism in female dominated workplaces much like women experience sexism in male dominated workplaces.   That the fact that men encounter sexism means women shouldn't ever talk about the sexism they experience?   I'm actually really disappointed that this sentence came out of a redditor I respect so much. Nothing in my post indicates I think women should not voice their concern regarding sexism in the workplace. You are ascribing motivations to me that are unwarranted and frankly offensive. I am simply trying to share my experience (and the experience of many other men in a hospital setting) so that we can better understand each other.
medlabprofessionals,39hmpr,praxeologue,4,Sun Jun 14 04:21:45 2015 UTC,"Ok, here's the problem. Let me attempt to word this in a way that doesn't come off as personal because it's not personal. At all. Believe that.  Women are constantly told to stop whining. If we complain about street harassment we are told we should treat being groped on public transit as a compliment. If we complain about the fact that a sizeable proportion of us will be raped in our lifetime, we are met with a chorus of ""false rape accusations r real!"" If we try to complain about the alarming domestic violence statistics and the fact that it is a crime that overwhelmingly is perpetrated against women, at least one man will rush into the discussion to remind us that men can be victims of domestic violence too so let's all talk about that instead. Many if not most discussions of women's issues outside of dedicated safe spaces are hijacked by men and turned into discussions We are surrounded by people yelling ""not all men!"" every time we try to speak up and yes, we know that not all men are abusers/rapists/harassers but the fact remains that most abusers/rapists/harassers/etc ARE men. That's not hyperbole or a guess, that's backed by a ton of crime statistics. Women are disproportionately the victims of rape, domestic abuse, and sexual harassment and men are disproportionately the perpetrators. I don't think a lot of men experience this or are aware of it at all, because it's not directed at them. It's outside the realm of their experience, even if they consider themselves feminist/humanist.  It may not have been your intention (in fact, given that I also respect you significantly I am quite sure it wasn't), but you need to understand that to me, and most other women who have experienced significant gender discrimination in the workplace, when you said   Nearly every man who has worked in a clinical setting has a similar story, too.   and nothing else, you are going to trigger this response in us. It looks like, to someone used to being told to stop complaining (hey, notice how many of the commenters here accuse the author of the article of ""whining""?) that your comment is just another, ""men get harassed too, you don't see us crying about it"" post. Even if that wasn't your intention.  If you want to talk about discrimination in the lab, let's talk. But it has to go beyond, ""yeah, well me too!"" Because that's not expressing empathy or really contributing to the conversation. And it sounds like you have experiences you should be contributing. It sucks when anyone is discriminated against, please know I believe that firmly. But the discrimination against women specifically in science is one that needs to be discussed because it is systemic, entrenched, and is seriously holding us back scientifically. The comments this man made were egregious, can you imagine a very prominent female scientist saying she doesn't want to work with men because they just fall in love with her and cry? Of course not, that would not happen. I had hoped in this thread we could have a discussion about this systemic sexism against female scientists, but clearly that was a pipe dream. So you can see how I might be a little disappointed with the direction things actually took."

Techs and phlebs work together and we techs do not supervise or manage them except in very specific circumstances. I can overrule them on things, but I can count on one hand the number of times I have.  As far as departments, we are all generalists. Day shift techs are assigned to a department, one tech in each and they rotate daily. Evening and graveyard shifts work all departments at once, often by themselves.

medlabprofessionals,3999d6,overground55,11,Wed Jun 10 04:23:56 2015 UTC,"Mmm...  When you think about ""doing chemistry"", you probably imagine memorizing element groups (halogens, metaloids, etc) and valences and balancing reactions, and then going in the lab and causing reactions and doing syntheses. You won't be doing any of that in the clinical lab - or rather, you'll be causing reactions and doing syntheses as part of testing, but they'll be planned out in advance and all you'll have to do is follow the recipe.  But what is important is understanding a lot of the high level concepts. Stuff like:   osmosis acids and bases, pH (pay a lot of attention here, very important) ions molarity and normality how molecular bonds work proteins (what they're made of, how they're structured) how enzymes work   Basically they want to be able to tell you stuff like ""transaminases require pyridoxal phosphate as a coenzyme"" without you going ""what's an amine? what's a coenzyme?""  Most of the mathy stuff is going to center around concentrations and dilutions, not reaction balancing. ""If you need 50 ml of a 5% KOH solution and your stock solution is 92% concentration, what ratio of KOH to water will you need?"" and that kind of thing."

medlabprofessionals,3999d6,nubcakefactoryy,2,Tue Jun 16 21:45:49 2015 UTC,"For medical chemistry, it's mostly knowing how the machines work, so it's not as technical as a physical or organic chemistry class. HOWEVER, it's important to know compounds and how they react for subjects like toxicology, where a lot of the science is based on metabolite and how they can be detected in a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) or other methodologies. For me, those basic chemistry classes were much tougher than the higher level ones. So don't get all worked-up about later. You need those basics so when they talk about advanced topics and application of all those theories you learned, you'll actually comprehend what's going on."
medlabprofessionals,3999d6,NotSureMyself,2,Wed Jun 10 04:57:13 2015 UTC,"I don't want to frighten you but there is a shit load of chemistry.   We have to know the chemical reactions which take place in all of the things in most of what we measure.  The various ways things are measured has it's own chemistry things to know.  The biggest money maker in the lab is the chemistry department, and though the actual job requires only the basic concept of whats going on, the test for certification and the class requires a lot more.  Micro also has a lot of chemistry because the old biochemical ways of identification rely on understanding why you observe various color changes and how a bug uses a certain substance. urine analysis is mostly chemical reactions, a little bit of scope work.  Immuno has a shit load of chemistry if you include the molecular portion and PCR reactions.    I don't think it's as complicated as orgo and electron transfer stuff and various conformations and impurities, but it's chemical reactions and the mechanisms/concepts that we need to understand to do our jobs.  Except blood bank. blood bank is mostly agglutination, which is archaic.  (blood bank has a lot of genetics and molecular bio involved, but most people don't need to know or care about that stuff)"

Getting phlebotomy training and working as a lab assistant is never going to hurt you both in applications and eventually as a tech. But I wouldn't jump to do it unless you're sure you need it or have some time you need to fill."

It was the only MLS program I could try for without having to move out of the Denver area. I didn't get in, and ended up starting an MS Biology program after getting a job in the wastewater treatment industry. About half of the applicants were rejected during my semester of applying. They were really picky about having taken specific courses during undergrad. One of them was a class only offered at MSU called ""Pathogenic Microbiology"". It's a lab/lecture combo class. They told me straight up during the interview that my ""Medical Microbiology"" class I took at UC Denver was not good enough. I couldn't tell you though how heavily they weighted real lab work experience. I had 1 year lab work experience at the time. Good luck."

Good luck finding agreement between colleagues, let alone consistency throughout the profession.

But even then, different authorities on Latin will disagree on certain pronunciations, so I think the best thing you can do is go with your lab's convention for pronunciation, and then spell things correctly for the benefit of anyone not familiar with that convention.  Probably one of the most vivid lessons I ever learned about the lab as a student was doing micro. We did all of our unknown work-ups with biochemicals and recorded our results with pen and paper, and turned them in at the end of the second day for our grade. One time while our subcultures were incubating overnight, our instructor switched each of our work-ups with someone else's, and we had to run with it without being able to the ask the other person, ""What the hell does this mean?"" It really illustrated the importance of being legible and coherent in case someone has to follow behind you and they can't get in touch with you.

I know most states have an analog of the CDC in their state that works closely with them. At the Minnesota Department of Health, a lot of them do have Masters but, they also work off of the bench most of the time. They also employ many epidemiologist, which you need a Masters for that. The problem with those kinds of jobs is that they don't pay as well as you think they would and a lot of people want to work there, who don't want to work in academia. Therefore you have a lot of over qualified people. At least that is what I experienced when I went there for several weeks on my internship at the MDH."

Looks like they have a micro opening in Atlanta, you may want to try applying for it.   Also epidemiology has a subreddit too, people who do that might tell you more about it. /r/epidemiology"
medlabprofessionals,38rdc6,Msmarmot,3,Sat Jun 6 04:01:01 2015 UTC,"Yes. I miss the theory of it all though. It gets repetitive. It hasn't even been a month and it's shocking the amount of knowledge I've lost. No one is going to consistently quiz the hell out of you once you're done and you start losing it all right and left. You can sign up for traveling techs for domestic travel. Outside of that, I can only think of the Peace Corps. It seems to be. No idea. I didn't go for that. I landed exactly what I wanted. It's also going to depend on demand in your area and how seniority is handled at places in your area. If you're looking for a 9-5 though, I'd start looking at urological and oncology specialists. Make sure you only apply for shifts you're honestly willing to work. Lots of places keep you in a position once you accept it for a specific set of time before you can move on. I worked almost every weekend and some days after my rotations. It wasn't that hard honestly. I thought it would be a lot worse, but that was easily an overestimation. I did a lot of my studying while at my rotations though, so time management may be why I ended up feeling that way. Your pin should be fine given that your lab coat will likely cover it. The strictness has more to do with keeping you body covered. It's a bit of all of that. However, I can tell you that you could never pay me enough money to work at the site I did my rotations in. DRAMA that puts high schoolers to shame. So if something isn't quite the right fit, look elsewhere. I did not have to do overnight shifts. Every now and then I'd have a week of 2nd shift, but it was 95% 1st shift."
medlabprofessionals,38rdc6,femanonette,3,Sat Jun 6 04:23:13 2015 UTC,"I do enjoy it Not sure about abroad opportunities In general, yes. At my lab I would say 3:1 females to males. However, in supervisor or lead tech positions, I see more males. It depends on your area. As a new tech, I was lucky enough to get 1st shift at a very large reference lab in my city. It took some time (about 4 months) to find this position but it's possible. I had financial aid from my university since I was receiving a bachelors in Clinical Laboratory. But some of my other classmates worked on the weekends at their other job. In my reference lab, we usually wear scrubs or business casual clothes so it's not that strict as long everything is covered by your PPE. This the same for other hospitals I've had rotations at. Wearing your pin would be fine. My coworkers are around the same age as me (mid-20s to early 30s) so they're pretty easy to hang out with. At the hospital where I did my MLS internship, there were a lot of older techs near retirement age but they were very sweet and kind. In general, I just try to be courteous and professional with everyone so I can avoid all the drama and nonsense. I only had to do 2 overnight shifts during my entire program and each shift was about 6 hours so it wasn't too bad."
medlabprofessionals,38rdc6,lis_sing,3,Sat Jun 6 07:39:45 2015 UTC,Doctor's Without Borders does take MTs. There's also the military route.
medlabprofessionals,38rdc6,anonymous_coward69,2,Sat Jun 6 14:17:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah for the most part.  Might could get in with some TB or HIV work in Africa. Otherwise you'd probably just be drawing blood, not doing any testing.  Mostly. Like nursing there's more dudes every year. My class of 8 was half guys. The class after mine only had one.  Not that hard. But the pay will likely be lower. Also try clinics, freestanding ERs and reference labs.  My university paid me to go.  The uniforms are color coded so patients can identify the service you work for. No one cares what pins you attach to them unless it's offensive.  Everyone is doing it for the money, be realistic. It's a job. At the end of the day we all have bills to pay.  We didn't where I went to school. There's a school where I work, the students have the option of 2nd or 3rd shift. When you start your program just ask them, the entire year is planned out. I doubt they'd really expect you to do much more than see what morning run is like."
medlabprofessionals,38rdc6,RiverboatCarter,2,Sat Jun 6 06:24:52 2015 UTC,"1.) Yep! Some nights are better than others. Last night it seems like it was my crowning achieving was to draw blood from a thirty something 300 pound baby who cried through the whole thing. Hrmph. But normally I do love it, haha.  2.) Yep, check out Mercy Ships, MSF, or ASCP global outreach. One of my profs is with ASCP outreach and he travels to Africa to help set up and evaluate laboratories. You could also check with the red cross if you're interested in blood banking specifically.  3.) So I've heard, we have an almost even split at my current lab.  4.) Hard. Well, it depends on where you live, I guess. I live in a small town and no doctor's offices have labs here so that's out. I'm probably going to be on evening shift for a couple more years before I can go to days. It's not experience, it's simply order of hire. Usually people start on nights or evenings then move to days when a position becomes available and they're next in line for it. Then the lab lists their old position, and the cycle repeats.  5.) I've worked full time through my MLT-MLS bridge program.  6.) Well that's going to depend a lot on where you work. I can wear anything I want under my lab coat. Sometimes I wear sundresses with tights or even my gym clothes if I was in a hurry to get to work. Most times I just wear cords and a thin long sleeve shirt. When it's been ages since I did laundry, then I wear scrubs. My boss also doesn't care about my facial piercing... score!  7.) Well, mostly cool. We have this new traveler that is apparently scared of me? He avoids me like the plague. But my graveyard tech told me he's just weird, apparently the very first thing he said to her was that he is LDS and had 3 wives. Not all at once, he was careful to clarify. But yeah, we're not really serious ever and nobody cares as long as we get the work done. I just posted a pic a few days ago of me at work...  8.) I have never worked an overnight shift. I think it would be very bad for my health, I have pretty severe insomnia and I know I wouldn't get any sleep during the daytime. As far as clinicals, AFAIK you will only work day shift where they have adequate staffing to supervise you. What job you get after that is a little less for sure, be prepared to at least work an evening shift like me, 2:30-midnight. Hey, at least there's evening differential!"

Also Doctors Without Borders looks for MLS/MLTs. Yes Here in New York they're pretty coveted and they get passed on through word of mouth. Gotta know people who know people. I don't think they're a great option for someone just out of school though. It's a ridiculous amount of responsibility for someone with so little experience. You gotta do your own troubleshooting, calibrations, reagent and supplies ordering, maintain periodic maintenance, make sure everything is documented correctly for inspection, etc etc.  My experience with clinicals is totally atypical, so I won't even bother sharing it.  I think it varies from institution, but my lab is business casual... REALLY casual. So they wouldn't care at all, so long as you weren't wearing jeans. I like my co-workers. Half of them are under 30 and the other half are over 50. The young group is a blast and we hang out all the time.  The old group is decidedly less energetic, but still fun to talk to and joke around with. Again, my clinicals experience was definitely not the standard experience, so I'll save you some reading."

medlabprofessionals,38p7b0,myfryfroisallfrizzy,12,Fri Jun 5 18:11:32 2015 UTC,"I don't think you will ever get a consistent answer. Canadian Blood Services will label donor units with weak-D as RhPos, but AFAIK, the hospitals will call them a RhPos with a comment saying Dw or Du. As a donor, they are labelled RhPos, but as a recipient, they should be RhNeg. They should still receive neg blood because depending on what style of weak-D they have, they could still mount an anti-D against certain epitopes of the D antigen. For example, if they are genetic weak-D, it's simply a reduced amount of surface proteins. If there is a C trans, the D is suppressed by the  C. If it's a partial D/Mosaic D, there's an alteration in the D epitope that could cause the patient to produce an antibody to the regular epitope that the donor would have. I think TM errs on the side of caution and just transfuses RhNeg. Ditto for the Rhogam, as it is still possible for the mother to form an anti-D, so it's important to make sure she gets her dose to prevent that.  ""Policies for typing pregnant women for weak D (Du) vary according to country and the protocols for administering Rh immune globulin. For example, in the USA the Standards of the American Association of Blood Banks (AABB) specifies that pregnant women who appear to be Rh negative should be tested for weak D; if Rh positive or weak D, they are considered to be Rh positive and are not candidates for Rh immune globulin.  In contrast, the Standards of the Canadian Society for Transfusion Medicine (CSTM) do not require weak D typing for pregnant women. If Rh negative or weak D such women are candidates for Rh immune globulin. Although extremely rare, weak D persons of the mosaic type can theoretically produce anti-D."" Source"
medlabprofessionals,38p7b0,LastProvidence,5,Fri Jun 5 19:29:25 2015 UTC,"At my facility, we call any anti-D IS reaction less than 2+ as Rh Neg. We will comment that the patient is weak D.  They are treated like any other Rh Neg patient and receive Rh Neg RBCs. Now as far as RhIg... I think we would still give it if indicated. The reason is that the patient may develop Anti-D due to having a partial D antigen. We do not perform weak D testing routinely, but we will use it to confirm Rh Neg babies when the mom is Rh Neg.  Also worth mentioning... Not all Anti-D reagents will behave the same. Some are designed to pickup more D variants than others and at different strengths.  I did a study comparing 2 different reagents and found that one gave a completely negative result when the other picked it up."
medlabprofessionals,38p7b0,cupcakes_n_ponies,3,Fri Jun 5 18:34:52 2015 UTC,"Does your facility have any instrumentation in blood bank? It sounds as though you perform all testing manually. I've never heard of anyone treating the anti-D like that, but I suppose as long as they receive the Rh neg blood there shouldn't be any repercussions. Was that a decision made by your medical director?"
medlabprofessionals,38p7b0,cupcakes_n_ponies,2,Fri Jun 5 19:05:46 2015 UTC,"You're right, we're doing only manual tube testing.  The decision was probably made by the technical manager over all our blood banks. I have no idea how long it has been in place, though."
medlabprofessionals,38p7b0,X_linked,3,Fri Jun 5 19:35:36 2015 UTC,We treat weak D mothers as Rh negative for pregnancy. They receive Rh immune globulin. We also consider sending out for genotyping. There is a ton of research on this in the last few years. AABB covered it last fall in one of their lectures. Start looking there for answers.
medlabprofessionals,38p7b0,lambdabar,2,Fri Jun 5 21:57:23 2015 UTC,"That is similar to our policy. We actually (as bad as this sounds) discovered that our policy requires that all weak D pos mothers receive a KB stain to be left for supervisor and path review. No one has been following this and no one was aware of it. When asked, the pathologists said they didn't want to have to review them. They're confident in our ability to count pink cells.   We're looking to revise the policy and we're looking to see what other facilities were doing. I was unaware of the AABB lecture. I'll look into that. Thank you!"
medlabprofessionals,38p7b0,lambdabar,2,Fri Jun 5 22:17:00 2015 UTC,"Our lab does the same testing: do weak D on patients with no history (OB, newborns...). We technically would call them Rh pos with a note about being weak D. We say no, they're not rhogam candidates. However, the doctor can still have it if requested.   Honestly, this is an area where I'd like to see my facility change the policy. I would only give them Rh neg blood anyway. And, I'd be concerned about the possibility of a Partial D, in which case giving rhogam would make sense. Why not just error on the side of caution?"
medlabprofessionals,38p7b0,cornerdius,1 point,Fri Jun 5 22:31:57 2015 UTC,"It is our policy to give Rh negative blood as well.   So you feel as though they should all be considered rhogam candidates? Our policy says they will be called Rh positive but still administer one prophylactic dose. No fetal cell screen, but perform the KB stain."
medlabprofessionals,38p7b0,cornerdius,2,Fri Jun 5 23:29:25 2015 UTC,"Right. I've only seen one case and watched how the senior tech handled it, and heard of a couple other cases from years ago. They basically didn't want to have an argument with the Dr while trying to explain the results (after a few attempts), so if they wanted the antenatal rhogam it was given. If it does no harm, and has the benefit of protecting a Partial D patient, why don't we do that from the start? Like many, our facility can't distinguish a weak from a partial d. And no, we wouldn't do the fetal screen."
medlabprofessionals,38p7b0,saraithegeek,2,Sat Jun 6 00:15:07 2015 UTC,"Not a blood banker but I have read some books. What I read is there are about 76 known different weak d genotypes, 11 known partial d and 10 Del. The 76 weak d's are categorized into types. Type 1, 2, 3 weak d do not promote alloimmunization. Only certain types like type 4.2, DAR, type 11, 15, 21, and 57.   To determine weak d status, a lab should perform a genotype of weak d patients, including pregnant women. Weak d types 1,2,3 should be managed as rhD pos others should be treated with rhogam and only given rh neg rbc for transfusion purposes."
medlabprofessionals,38p7b0,saraithegeek,3,Sat Jun 6 00:00:24 2015 UTC,"While this makes sense, I feel as though my lab director and blood bank supervisor would decide that this isn't a very cost efficient option. The number of weak d positive patients is rare enough, and of those, even fewer require transfusion.   In my opinion, any potential issues could be avoided by simply transfusing Rh negative blood unless there is something I'm unaware of. This also seems like a more cost efficient solution. Again, please correct me if I'm wrong. I'm not very well versed in the topic."
medlabprofessionals,38p7b0,tomatoesandchicken,2,Sat Jun 6 00:35:04 2015 UTC,"I would say you are correct, from my experience as a generalist, donor units/patients that are weak d positive are treated as rh pos. but there is a lack of standardization. The proposed idea of genotyping will be more prevalent as technology becomes more accessible/inexpensive. I am completely blind to how the payment system works, I work in a system that if the insurance doesn't cover the cost, the patient does. So we get paid... Either way u are right, two percent or so of the Caucasian population test are weak d positive, so it might not be a priority investment."
medlabprofessionals,38p7b0,saraithegeek,2,Sat Jun 6 02:02:13 2015 UTC,"To determine weak d status, a lab should perform a genotype of weak d patients, including pregnant women.   Or just treat them as Rh negative. Meaningful use and all..."

The hospital where I was interning was a teaching hospital. The UA room has 2 doors, one is locked and the room has no windows.  So usually the old professor takes medical students through the lab, let them look at slides and whatnot and ask them questions. Now this particular day the old guy walked in UA room first to set up his slides. As soon as he walked in, I smelled his gas grenade, but I didn't say anything. Next came the students; I told them that there are trichomonas on the microscope if they want to take a look. They went through, OOOH and AHHH this is so cool.  One girl came in late. She went in, asked them ""Hey what are you guys looking at?"" They all said come look, trichomonas.  She exclaimed, wide eyed ""So that's what trichomonas smells like?""  I tried to run out of the room before busting my ass laughing. She smelled the old doctor's farts and thought that's what trichomonas smells like.

We call it ""microbiology by committee"" in our lab, and I've seen some parasites go through 4 or 5 techs before we finally agree on a result. Waffly responses, like ""to be confirmed"", ""presumptive"", or ""suggestive of"" are also useful, if you have the capability to freetext results. But really in the end, you go with your gut.

That doesn't really prove that there are actually people with only GEDs working as med techs because employers themselves likely have stricter requirements not to mention certifying bodies. I work in a non-licensure state and my hospital requires a BS degree and certification with ASCP to call yourself a Medical Technologist. ASCP requires that BS among other things, and other certifying agencies have the same requirements. Good luck getting a job anywhere uncertified."

medlabprofessionals,38k5oa,nubcakefactoryy,2,Thu Jun 4 19:30:51 2015 UTC,"It depends. Where I live (KY) some MLTs are making as much as MLSs and doing less work, others are doing the same amount of work and making half as much. It just depends on how much your hospital values that extra education."
medlabprofessionals,38k5oa,saraithegeek,4,Thu Jun 4 21:04:55 2015 UTC,"Seems like it's been $4-5/hr different everywhere I've worked. Honestly the bigger advantage to MLS isn't pay, it's opportunity. Not every lab hires MLTs (mine doesn't, I'm just a special snowflake), some of them restrict the testing they can do, etc. Not to mention most upward movement in terms of careers is going to require that BS, into management or service rep or whatever."

There is infection control.   Multiple different roles in industry that are highly niched but need a lab background.   Why did people spend 1 to 2 years learning to do a job they didn't actually want to do at all?

Many nursing homes and assisted living facilities run labs on their patients regularly. I was thinking of running a mobile laboratory where I go to each individual facility and run their labs for them in the facility! I would just need small tabletop analyzers.   I could provide the facility with instantaneous results. No need for courier, no need for outside facilities, and hopefully at a cheaper cost to them."

Now I also get the excuse to take time off the bench and go do audits and visit with the floor.  I am still hourly, which is good, and am not required to attend any off shift meetings or interviews.

I cannot have a family because life is so bad at work. All in the lab dungeon which is where we all exist. Just another day toiling in the dungeons and waiting for the sweet release of death.  I feel better.  There is no career ladder (except the documented career ladder at my job, ). LIS needs a balance of both. New assay development needs a balance of both and multiple industry organizations in my city hire for it. Infection control is only more for nurses because our doom-and-gloom asses can't get away from shooting our profession in the knee every chance we get on every forum. Imagine this: We actually try to be part of the healthcare team.  The dirty truth is, most of you all don't want to. You're lazy, you're not driven, and you hide behind the ""introvert"" tag to post this woe-is-us crap every week. Which is why no one will work with you. Which is why you're relegated to just ""doing your jobs,"" because no one wants to dare to try to do anything more than their jobs, because this field somehow is a magnet for people who only want to do the bare minimum and somehow think they should be rewarded at a level above what other professions make for it.

There are hospitals that hire strictly IT, but there can be a disconnect since the technological aspect is understood, but not the medical knowledge.  I would recommend working on the bench before seeking out an LIS position. You need that familiarity with the LIS you are working with as a general user before becoming an administrator."
medlabprofessionals,38cork,convolute,3,Wed Jun 3 14:05:41 2015 UTC,"Every hospital I've worked in has required that the LIS coordinator also be MT/MLS certified. I'd start by learning all that you can about your current system and make friends with your LIS manager. Express an interest to your director and offer to learn/help out.  edit to add: If I have learned anything in this field (at least in the US), we are all busy and we all have so many responsibilities.  Ask for more work and you shall receive.  I guarantee that whoever does your LIS has a full plate and would love to share with someone genuinely interested in that path."

For 2 years out of school, no kids, dual income we've been living comfortably.  I've also been able to work up the career ladder at work, so it's really not too bad.  We are often compared to nurses and how they make more, but I believe they are over paid more than we are under paid.  Considering a nurse can make as much as the NP who is putting in the orders there is a serious education to pay lack of gap there.  I do know the east coast likes to under pay even though there is an increased cost of living, and that is stupid, but we do not have a strong union."

I have spoken with the CLS there, and they tell me I can expect $25 to start. In fact, other hospitals nearby, I hear, such as Children's Mercy, pay even higher in some occasions. They have reached 26-27 bucks an hour rather easily with shift differential, and have seen hard evidence of a friend of mine reaching upwards of 70K a year by just putting in a fair amount of overtime. Even looking at Quest in Lenexa's starting salary's, which being a reference lab would be expected to be lower, are listed as at least 19 dollars an hour. How is this possibly a good anomaly, your 19 dollars and hour up to 22? I feel like I am living in two worlds.

medlabprofessionals,38aa0e,Cut_the_dick_cheese,1 point,Wed Jun 3 07:35:41 2015 UTC,"I should add evening dif is $3 and night is $3.50.  Weekend dif is $6 for nights and I think $4.50 for evenings.    One problem we have with setting our rates is the hospital only allows us to be compared to similar jobs in the region, not nationwide.  So since all the states in VA are starting around $20 they have no incentive to pay higher than that because if you work in the region it's what you will get.  We have a problem bringing in experience from outside the region for this reason.  When we were looking for a supervisor it's hard to draw someone to this region based on wage.   There are labs which pay more, but that is our flow/tox/cyto/stem cell, but those are day time positions with no dif, and also retain their workers a lot more than our general lab staff, so there's less opportunity to move up in a short time."

There is a candy vending machine in the cafeteria that dispenses a handful of candy for 25 cents. My LA and I always joke one of these weekends we are going to march down there once an hour and get a handful of candy with our weekend differential.   That said base pay is very fair and both of us do get the evening differential for most of our shift so it's actually an extra $2.25 with weekend+evening. But yeah, giving us 25 cents an hour feels like the people that leave a couple of pennies as a tip to a bad waiter... it just sends a message, you know?"
medlabprofessionals,38aa0e,tardy4datardis,2,Thu Jun 4 20:32:20 2015 UTC,"i think its completely unfair to you.

Third gets 5+ I live in New England and work in two different facilities and both do a hourly diff for the weekends. I have in the past heard of some hospitals that'll give like an extra 30-50$ flat rate for working fri night, sat nite, sunday.  as like the diff on top of their normal hourly rate.  That also seems fair."
medlabprofessionals,38aa0e,saraithegeek,1 point,Thu Jun 4 23:15:40 2015 UTC,"Well to be clear it IS an hourly diff- $0.25 an hour.

I do not believe this includes any fees to actually transfuse the unit as this would be billed by the unit the patient is in, not the lab. Our blood center charges us something like $500 for the unit itself. No idea about platelets, we don't stock them and only bring them in by special order. The hospital has to eat the taxi charge for the nearly two hour drive to get them up here if they can't wait for a regular courier run, too. Seems like people only want platelets on the weekends. :(  I end up talking to a lot of people out in the community and within the hospital who distrust the blood center for this exact reason. It looks bad for them because they're donating the blood for free and then the blood center is charging what seems like an exorbitant sum for it, and the hospital is too. I try to give them an idea of what is involved in transfusion a unit of blood- usually by the time I'm listing off all the infectious diseases it has to be tested for they start to understand. Our blood center is operating at a loss and while we may turn a small profit in the hospital blood bank, it's only to subsidize the rest of the hospital. A unit of blood is expensive, but everything is expensive in medicine and it's not a problem that is unique to the blood bank. AFAIK most of the cost of producing a unit of blood is in labor, and as I tell these folks, bitches got to get paid! I'm the bitches. I need to be paid. Hee hee."
medlabprofessionals,388fun,saraithegeek,2,Tue Jun 2 19:21:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah. Of that ~200$ cost, only about 10-20$ is profit.

medlabprofessionals,387yt4,smartassassination,5,Tue Jun 2 14:28:51 2015 UTC,"Wasn't worth it in my opinion.  Starting wage will be about $75-85k, which won't go too far with the insane COL in SF. As long as you don't dream of a life in SF, you can make the same in Sacramento, and easily have 1/2 the COL. And SF is an easy 1.25hr trip away for weekend stays. This is what I did, and I pay $850/month for a 2 bedroom apt that would cost me $2000+ in SF.  Side note on other locales:   Southern CA will pay a bit lower, about $60-65k starting, you can be by the ocean and the COL is a happy medium between SF and Sac COL."

I would say it would depend entirely on your background and previous experience, as well as what specific job you are looking for. Sometimes, its really hard to break into the hospital scene. This is especially true with Kaiser, as they pay the most and typically don't hire people full time without having previously employed them as part time/per diem employees."
medlabprofessionals,387yt4,saraithegeek,1 point,Thu Jun 4 04:04:58 2015 UTC,"A friend of mine and her husband were thinking about moving to SF a while back. He's in the tech industry so it made sense. However they priced it out and she told me that the rent for a house equivalent to the one they owned here was something obscene like 15,000 a month. I thought it was a typo at first. Apartments and condos are a little ""cheaper"" but still absolutely insane compared to anywhere else in the country. If you feel like jacking up your blood pressure, take a look at these listings. Then there's the issue of California licensure which is murky at best.  Since you obviously don't mind a bit of gray and rain if you're willing to live in San Francisco, why not consider Seattle or Portland? There are kind of upsides and downsides to both cities but overall they're both very good places to live. You'll benefit from the higher west coast wages but with a more sane cost of living than SF and they both have really cool urban vibes. Personally I prefer Portland for the mass transit, slightly better weather, and more progressive politics, but Seattle is right on the ocean and feels a lot more sophisticated."

medlabprofessionals,37w092,psychicbagel,3,Sun May 31 02:09:30 2015 UTC,"It sounds like a question on pre analytical variables but put in the context of a specific test. Think about fill levels, wrong blood in tube, haemolysis, clots etc."
medlabprofessionals,37w092,cornerdius,3,Sun May 31 17:33:00 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't think to hard on it, I do reference coag and we separate our plasma off, freeze it at -70, then when ready to test we thaw it in a 37 C bath for about 4 minutes. I don't think there is a chromogenic method for factor 11 at the moment.. So hemolysis shouldn't be an issue. The important thing as said is to fill the tube and make sure you don't in activate factors by incubating too long at 37, don't leave the sample at room temp too long.   Also fun fact to differentiate between liver failure and factor deficiency, monitor factor 7. It's usually the first to go in liver failure."
medlabprofessionals,37w092,femanonette,1 point,Mon Jun 1 11:48:09 2015 UTC,"I could be oversimplifying here, but isn't it because too much jostling of the specimen will induce early platelet aggregation? Since XI is directly related to platelet aggregation, it'd be hard to test for its activity if the specimen has begun aggregation before the actual instrument initiated the process.  This is why hospitals around my area walk citrate tubes to the lab instead of putting them in the pneumatic system. Jostling can induce aggregation and hemolyzation, thereby ruining the specimen by prematurely activating the platelets.  I'd imagine this would affect the sample by the instrument rejecting it due to the detection of clots."
medlabprofessionals,37uew4,anonymous_coward69,4,Sat May 30 14:06:47 2015 UTC,"I've worked both, Seattle to rural Washington to Portland.  Rural you have to work independently, you might be the only tech on you shift or one other person, fewer lab assistants too. Be comfortable drawing blood, you will get called t do it. If its slow you can do what you want if you work eves or night shift (TV, internet, study). My rural hospital payed well and had great benefits, so no complaints there, plus cost of living was lower.  City you will have lots of coworkers, so work well in a team. Pay can vary, because lots more competition for your job, but the hospital might have a union to demand higher wages. Factor in commuting and housing costs to where you work/live.   The most important thing I think to where you work is having co-workers you get along with and having a lab director that stands up for the lab."
medlabprofessionals,37uew4,sofie7885,2,Sat May 30 15:04:05 2015 UTC,"Yep, you nailed it on rural. I work by myself most of my shift which can be scary when you don't have a ton of experience. But my coworkers are just a phone call away. It's quiet enough after 9 or so that I get a lot of homework done then.  Day shift is very busy, we're understaffed and have a surprisingly large volume for the size of the lab.   My lab doesn't pay great- there's a hospital about 45 minutes away that pays so much more that for a lot of people it's financially worth it to commute even after gas and such. I have no interest in commuting but we've lost a lot of potential hires because of it. There's a new rumor that that hospital might buy us and I hope it happens because we'd all get a great pay raise and this other hospital is always winning ""best place to work"" awards and stuff. In any case, the cost of living is low enough here that my husband and I have been able to buy a house when I've been working full time less than a year, as an MLT no less so I really don't have much room to complain about the pay! Plus outside of the NW a lot of MLS are actually making less than my starting salary so I do feel lucky."
medlabprofessionals,37uew4,saraithegeek,1 point,Sat May 30 20:04:45 2015 UTC,"Some cities are overstaffed, whereas others aren't. Also depends on the demographics of the city as to what you'll get. There's usually no patient contact at a larger hospital (you wont leave the lab).  Better pay is better in a desperate rural clinic (nobody to compete for your job), or in a unionized hospital.   Job security depends, it's less likely that a large hospital would go under (unlike a smaller rural clinic), but there could be mergers/outsourcing to other hospitals/labs.  What are you looking for pay-wise? You'll make enough to get by, but not to get ahead."

Family, mortgage, cars, etc.. My internship was 9 months, 42.5 hours a week unpaid, 3 hours of commuting daily (I commuted because it was much cheaper to pay gas and parking than to find somewhere closer to the hospital), hours of homework, and I worked 30 hours a week at another job. I worked  5 hour shifts 2 night a week, and 10 hour shifts both weekend days.  In short it sucked. I think it's one of the main barriers to getting people into this profession. I had two days off in 9 months (xmas day and new years day). I actually can't wait to start only working full time, it will be like a vacation.

I donated plasma about twice a week. That was almost enough to cover groceries.  3.  I got rid of ALL non-essentials, cable, (chromecast and a Netflix subscription is a great way to go - I never switched back) lowered my internet speed, looked for cheaper electricity.  No one got more than a card from me for birthdays etc.  I tried to make food ahead once a week so I could grab and go but make sure I was eating cheap.  The /r/frugal and /r/eatcheapandhealthy subreddits can offer a lot of good advice.  4. I kept a thousand dollar emergency fund and stopped paying off any debt I had and stopped 401k contributions for that time.  5.  If I needed something like say, my dishwasher needed to be replaced at one point, I used craigslist. I also sold things.  The safety of that one kinda depends on your area.   Best wishes!

OP, if you don't have 3 semesters of physics, including ""Instruction in Principles of Light and Electricity"" you won't get a California license until you have 4 years of experience under your belt. Here's more about it, unless things have changed dramatically since 2010:  http://www.ascp.org/Board-of-Certification/State-Licensure/California-Licensure/  In California, you can't release results without licensure, ASCP can't help you there, state regulations. Best you'll be able to pull is an MLT position (and pay) for the next four years if you don't meet the requirements.  Another edit: Ok, they've fixed the physics thing - that's just a requirement for CLS education in California, but once you have your bachelors, you're good. But you will absolutely need 52 weeks of internship / experience, exceeding the other 49 states requirements of 30 weeks."
medlabprofessionals,37kvfw,tsui_s,3,Thu May 28 22:25:23 2015 UTC,I think you are right. California license is really ridiculous. The professional license needs to be more uniformed. I do not see why if you graduate from a NAACLS accredited school and ASCP certified you  still cannot get your license.
medlabprofessionals,37i00y,flugob,4,Wed May 27 19:53:56 2015 UTC,"Nope! You don't need anything extra.  A lot of hospitals actually expect you to be able to stick, even if you were never really trained in school (like me). It's just kinda a part of the job. If you don't have to do it now I wouldn't worry about it too much, most likely if you get a different job where it is required they will train you at least a little bit.   Do you need patient contact hours for any particular reason? Because if not you're definitely selling yourself short! Try to find a PRN MLS position!"

Their new hospital has an awesome group of people and the ref lab is super laid back.   Providence has basically announced that nobody is getting raises that even meet cost of living/inflation, and the raises are given is limited how much they can give out per dept. It's kinda like hunger games where everyone has to fight for increases to pay for increased food and housing costs. They're already the lowest in the market next to Adventist."
medlabprofessionals,37ekcb,masgrada,1 point,Fri Jun 5 04:11:55 2015 UTC,With kaiser the trick is: apply for everything. Every single job. Get unionized in six months. Then switch. You only have to put up with the crap job for six or so months before you can switch.   It's better to get in there and then switch because you're unionized. They have to offer internal jobs first before they offer it externally. Then you nail the good ref lab or west side lab job. It's basically how you get in line the quickest.

medlabprofessionals,37dx6o,Vpicone,1 point,Thu May 28 20:31:02 2015 UTC,"There are people who work during the program, although I wouldn't recommend it. If you manage your time well, you definitely could if it's a necessity. The Masters project starts about half way through the program, so I'm just starting it now. After 6 semesters (including summers) everyone takes their cert. Then you have one final semester to finish work on your thesis and defend it.   The Masters program really just involves more discussion, presentations, and research/management related courses. The professors are extremely compassionate and totally care about all of the students. Personally, I love living on campus and walking to classes/lab. The course material is heavy, but the testing is fair. I think in the Masters program it's one of those ""you get out what you put into it."" If you really take advantage of all the opportunities you have with a thesis, I think it stands to reason that you can shape your career in the direction you want. I'm working with the molecular team at UTMB starting to formulate my thesis and absolutely love it."

On topic: I took molecular biology in my undergrad, so thankfully I didn't have to take it again."
medlabprofessionals,37d2rq,sasamiel,3,Tue May 26 19:12:53 2015 UTC,"DFW has a lot of fairly large hospitals and only one med tech school in Fort Worth. So as long as you don't have some horrible background pricking people with dirty needles for funsies you should more or less be able to take your pick.   Fort Worth is the more conservative of the two, with Dallas being more liberal. Just to avoid some horrible commute I'd suggest finding where you want to live, then finding a job nearer to that. If you're into it, Dallas has a decent light rail system with stops at 3 major medical centers. Fort Worth has a commuter train to Dallas but within the city it's bus service only and it's not super great. I've heard parkland memorial isn't so good but I wouldn't put much stock in that. Baylor seems to be merged with Scott and white, where I went to school. Unless their benefits turned shitty they'd probably be a good place to start.   I'm pretty sure there's a large Baylor hospital in both cities too."

medlabprofessionals,379gg5,BromeoandRatchiette,3,Mon May 25 23:25:40 2015 UTC,"Welcome! Working in the medical laboratory field can involve many different things. I hope the answers you get here keep your interest. :)   What is your title?   I am a licensed generalist in California working as a ""Clinical Laboratory Scientist I"" in a genetics laboratory -- specifically in microarrays.   What setting do you work in and how many hours do you typically work in one week?   I work 40 hours a week (four 10-hr days). I start at 9am and most of my day is on the bench either doing automated or manual sample processing. We have a separate department for DNA isolation, so my work is downstream of that. When I'm not on the bench, I'm analyzing data and reporting findings.   Hourly or salary?   I am on salary.    Do you get raises every once in a while or are you hired at the pay you will be getting for the next few years?   This is my first year working at this company, but it is my understanding that everyone gets a raise every year, but the amount varies from person-to-person. Last Christmas we got a bonus that was based on how long we had been at the company.    What is the difference in starting pay between technicians and technologists?   Licensed technicians in California are pretty rare. There's a lot of push by the state to use technologists (CLS), so the few places that do have technicians don't pay very well. You're typically seeing ~$20/hr for a technician position whereas a technologist may be closer to $34/hr or more.   Outside of California, the situation is vastly different. Cali licensing has WAY more requirements compared to other states, so CLS's here benefit from the manufactured scarcity. Ten+ years ago it wasn't like that, so technicians vs technologists didn't see a difference in pay.   You'll also see that the cost of living in certain parts of Cali is quite high. However, my CLS coworkers & I live comfortable and well-traveled lives, so I think it's pretty good."
medlabprofessionals,379gg5,NotSureMyself,2,Tue May 26 00:07:05 2015 UTC,"You ask a lot about pay so my initial advice to you is to tour a clinical laboratory and see it in person if you haven't already. My title is Medical Technologist, my ASCP cert is Medical Laboratory Scientist. I work 40 hours a week, I graduated in December and was able to negotiate for a decent starting hourly due to my experience working in an animal hospital for several years prior to this field but not every new grad is so lucky. If you value job security I would say go MLS (bachelors or masters) over MLT as some states are changing legislation and greatly limiting what MLTs are allowed to do. Finally when you say ""the laboratory"" what aspects do you mean? It is a big place with a lot of areas you can work in. I'm a generalist currently working in blood bank, hematology, chemistry, urinalysis, and coagulation. I do some micro but mostly rapid tests and gram stains. I love what I do and I worked very hard to be able to do it. I hope this is a field that speaks to you because we need more good people :)"

I work 72 hrs a pay period (2 weeks) with alternating weekends- so one week I work 3 days (W-F) and one week I work 5 days (W-Su). I am paid hourly with an off shift differential. I get step raises every year or so and I will get a decent raise when I finish my BS next year. The difference between MLT and MLS for starting salary is about $4/hr, but that's kind of academic since my hospital only hires MLS, just made an exception for me on the guarantee I'd go back to school. I don't recommend just doing MLT, it's not that much work to do a bridge program and wage isn't the only consideration- a lot of places restrict MLTs/won't hire them.

But if you're looking at it from a personality fit standpoint then that's the best way to do it. You're not going to be rich, and many places won't afford an average home if you're on a single income.   It starts at high teens for both mlt and MLS. You're looking at low mid 20/hr and 30ish late career. There are regions of the country that do make more, most notably California. However California's relative cost of living exceeds that pay difference.   Also, we get 'raises' that are 2-3% which doesn't even cover cost-of-living increases."

I had five years of nothing but glowing reviews and a great reputation with this organization and it's all gone within a couple of months, much of it at the hands of people I trusted and felt were friends and all this was supported by management.  Saying you suffer from PTSD from it is no exaggeration. The sad thing is that I began to turn into what they thought I was: incompetent. I started making mistakes that I NEVER could have imagined myself making. I became scared to do almost anything because I was screwing up, or that thought I was, and then they got on a new band wagon because I was asking too many questions and wasn't ""catching on."" I was asking questions because every damned one of them wanted things done differently!  One thing that helped me was that there were two long term travelers there who were watching all this from ""the outside"" and they both approached me separately to tell me they saw what was happening, said it was wrong and gave my confidence a much needed boost by telling me I was/am a good tech.

But at the same time, I feel content with the level and amount of social interaction I've had already, and know that I need it to be mentally healthy, even if I technically may not ""want"" to talk to others.  I'm only saying something because I feel like these kinds of posts are discouraging to quiet people like me, who may not have been given a chance yet to experience how they feel in a professional work environment, and are still trying to gauge their best career options.  I am an INFJ."

A nurse doesn't do my job and doesn't understand. Had a situation yesterday where both my chemistry analyzers were being dicks at the same time, told the nurse on the third call it'd be 11 minutes if they stopped calling, 20-30 if they kept calling because I'm trying to correct the issue with the analyzer so the test can be run.

medlabprofessionals,36rs16,Lifebox02,4,Sun May 24 04:01:31 2015 UTC,"Introverted is not the same as being shy or socially awkward - it just means that you prefer to spend more time alone than interacting with others. I am fairly outgoing at work when talking to coworkers and have no problems communicating with people, but I don't want a job where talking to people, especially strangers, is the majority of the job, such as for doctors or nurses."

That's just my preference. I can hold a conversation pretty well with most people. When other people are talking about something funny around me, I laugh along. If they are sharing experience, I add mine. Being introverted doesn't mean we are weird or can't social. We just recharge ourselves via quiet means. :)"
medlabprofessionals,36rs16,yourbuttstinks,4,Fri May 22 14:01:26 2015 UTC,"INTJ. I took it quite a while ago.  But to be clear, introvert does NOT equal shy or anti-social or even socially awkward. It just means that you expend energy in social situations. This is a very common misconception.  If you met me on the street, I'd be perfectly pleasant and you might even think I was quite outgoing and social. Because I am! It's just tiring to do over the long term."

medlabprofessionals,36aetq,Aquarius52,2,Sun May 17 19:18:22 2015 UTC,What is wrong with us as professionals that we aren't a little angrier about this?
medlabprofessionals,36aetq,llama726,6,Mon May 18 01:18:24 2015 UTC,Probably the same thing that makes it so we don't fight harder for more pay and respect.
medlabprofessionals,36aetq,xploeris,5,Mon May 18 01:31:30 2015 UTC,"Well, I'm certainly angry but partially because this reads like a smear piece.   Compounds that are mixed with samples deteriorate over time, so they must be properly stored and used by expiration dates. This, too, was an issue noted in inspection reports. A lab may try to save money by using them past their expiration dates, which could compromise accuracy of tests.  Instruments get dirty if not routinely cleaned. Tubing wears inside machines. So do pumps that push testing compounds onto patient samples. Air bubbles fill lines that need to be flushed.  ""Why do you have to change the oil in your car?"" said Smith, from Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago. ""Nothing is forever.""   This sounds horrible for sure, and yet zero mention of the endless QC we do solely for the purpose of making sure all this inevitable stuff doesn't impact patient results.  We DO have a problem. I've talked about my own struggles with management in my lab over tube labeling. I'm not going to stand here and say I've never made a mistake, either. But this article is heavily biased and sensational."
medlabprofessionals,36aetq,saraithegeek,2,Mon May 18 03:32:32 2015 UTC,"Agreed, I like the guy's approach of send the author an email and let her know more about what we do and how her article is insult to injury for a profession that is struggling enough as it is and she's taking on all the wrong issues that aren't facing us as a group"
medlabprofessionals,36aetq,AllyGambit,2,Mon May 18 14:38:58 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure ""biased"" goes far enough.  When I was on clinicals, instruments were routinely cleaned. Tubing was rinsed, soaked, and swapped out. Probes were inspected and wiped down. Many instruments do line purges either as a routine part of operation or as part of a periodic maintenance or start-up routine.  And, as you point out, if something was wrong with the machine - with the pumps, say - QC would show that.  And every QC and reagent bottle was dated, every run or maintenance procedure was documented, and every remedial action described.  I don't doubt that if you look long enough and ask enough techs for their best ""worst lab"" horror stories, you can find some bad techs and sloppy labs, and you might even find ones that CAP or some other inspector missed. But that's not the state of the industry as far as I can tell, so let's call this article what it really is: dishonest."
medlabprofessionals,36aetq,xploeris,6,Tue May 19 03:42:05 2015 UTC,"I don't see what's wrong with the sentinel report. It's not uncommon for inspectors to give labs a few hours to get their ""sunday"" best on before they arrive.   Outside of a few gold standard labs, most labs use barely functioning equipment with a post-retirement skeleton staff that's never taken any CE."
medlabprofessionals,36aetq,DoorOnLeft,6,Sun May 17 20:53:13 2015 UTC,"Outside of a few gold standard labs, most labs use barely functioning equipment with a post-retirement skeleton staff that's never taken any CE.   Aw, harsh. My instruments work most of the time!"
medlabprofessionals,36aetq,saraithegeek,7,Mon May 18 00:46:33 2015 UTC,"The problems with the article are numerous, but most erroneous are her attempts to incite fears by using buzzwords and bias. For example, she cited that the accrediting agency gave out very few indictments. She put this information forward as negative - that the accrediting agency isn't doing its job by not punishing labs. However, few punishments given could be because there aren't many labs failing to meet standards. The primary errors that led to wrong results are pre-analytical specimen collection and labelling - most of the time being the nurses and phlebotomists, not medical technologists."

medlabprofessionals,364jx7,mundanevelocity,1 point,Sun May 17 00:56:18 2015 UTC,"Look at hospitals around you. Apply for anything you are qualified for Even if it is patient transport, it is exposure. Two weeks after filling out an online application call or email the lab director (or whoever oversees that job title) with a short message prepared. Think a couple of sentences. If all else fails try volunteering.   Be on the watch for interview days. The large hospital systems sometimes do system-wide interview days where you show up with your resume."
medlabprofessionals,364jx7,ygoloibyrtsimehc,8,Sun May 17 02:01:52 2015 UTC,A BS in biology is very useless in the job market (according to the posts in /r/biology - maybe 1/8 posts are of success in the appropriate threads).

Though the report is depressing:   30% will leave the field within 5 years 50% get no additional training there is no career ladder    Studies of the PHL workforce have drawn attention to several concerns about staff training and projected turnover, both of which highlight challenges to maintaining a sufficient number of highly skilled and competent workers. A 2011 national PHL workforce characterization survey found that approximately one third of PHL directors nationally expected 16%–25% of their workforce to retire, resign, or be released in the subsequent 5 years, while 12% anticipated losing 26%–50% of their workforce during that time period (6,7). Approximately 30% of the individual scientific staff respondents expected to continue working in a PHL for <5 years (6). These findings largely reflect workforce demographics, because more than half of scientific laboratory staff were aged >45 years (6). Important recruitment and retention challenges for the PHL workforce also have been identified, including the lack of established progressive job series (commonly termed ""career ladders"" in the PHL community) for PHL scientists (6–8) and the lack of adequate opportunities for training and professional development (6,7). Indeed, approximately 50% of laboratories reported no, minimal, or only partial capacity to provide continuing education and training to their workers (6,7). Lack of adequate training poses challenges because PHL scientists and managers require a range of scientific, leadership, and managerial development courses, ideally based on core competencies, to function effectively in their positions (9–11)."

Plus they do all the maintenance while I do a lot of somewhat mindless running of tubes. I work in a reference lab so hospitals may be different but everywhere is different. And of course it depends whether your work is automated enough to allow for listening to things.

So I had a cold, about my 30th of the year (stress) and was all alone and feeling especially spiteful. So at every opportunity I had to cough or sneeze I would cough or sneeze on their office supplies. I also repeated this over a small supply of disposable pipettes and on glass tubes.   About a week later cunty comes to work sporting a raw nose and lamenting about spending the entire weekend fighting off a cold.   I also filled a methanol squirty bottle with di water to have a water fight with one of my assistants, forgot I filled the bottle with di water then about 3 weeks later I hear another tech screaming about washing a smear off a slide because the methanol bottle was full of water. that tech was also a cunt.

Some of the other MSDS sheets I found were for crystal forms, and I'm guessing those would be worse because their concentration is higher?

At first I was turned off because I was thinking it was just A,B,O blood banking stuff, but after realizing that it is more than that and also about autoimmune disorders and antigen/antibody interactions, I became very interested. I am assuming there is ELIZA testing that I would be performing and the job would called blood bank specialist or immunohemotologist?   This is what I would do if it were my choice.  FYI there isn't really any enzyme immunoassays being used in blood bank. It's mostly agglutination reactions- testing patient plasma against red cells of a known phenotype OR testing patient cells against commercially available reagent antisera. Blood bank is a nice combination of hands on, intellectually challenging, and I also really love the humanitarian aspect of it. The work we do in blood bank more directly affects a patients' life than any other department. There is some automation now though it is far from universal and really it's just automating the dead easy parts- basically abo grouping and antibody screening which leaves techs to spend time on the more interesting stuff- and that's if you have automation. My lab doesn't, even our blood center doesn't automate.  If it's something you think you might be interested in, I'd suggest checking out Blood Bank Guy. He's a pathologist who specializes in transfusion medicine but the content is good for techs too and I really like his podcasts.

medlabprofessionals,35bg17,Soleira,1 point,Sat May 9 01:40:33 2015 UTC,"MLS/CLS is technically a generalist working in all areas of the clinical laboratory with a bachelors degree. When you finish school, you will have to take a certification test with ASCP for MLS as a generalist, that license is good in all states to my knowledge. Some states require an additional state license which is essentially paperwork and money, and they look to see you've passed the ASCP MLS exam. Someone who has a MLS and is working in the blood banking department would be a ""blood banker"".  An SBB is another licensing exam offered by ASCP, the specialist in blood banking exam. It's regarded as a masters level of education by most employers. You really just need to be certified as a MLS and have enough experience (at least 3 years) to sit for the exam, or go through an SBB program (additonal classes and training)."

I know the status of all my instruments and every sample. Everyone who works here is really on top of everything because there is no anonymity.   Make sure that there are enough people to cover for vacations and sick days! No one has been denied PTO in the 2 years I've been here, but we've all had to work some overtime to make sure everyone gets their vacation! If you have good coworkers and management hopefully it won't be an issue."
medlabprofessionals,359hgo,Kailey20,1 point,Fri May 8 16:14:27 2015 UTC,Im considering a rural hospital. Is the pay lower? Is there less work?
medlabprofessionals,359hgo,Sibby123,2,Fri May 8 06:27:59 2015 UTC,"Much less work. There have been nights with 0 patients in the hospital. A ""busy"" day would be about 10 patients. The pay is actually higher for me than anywhere else I was offered ($27/hr base rate), but I'm also in what many would consider an undesirable location (northern MN) which I feel affects the pay."
medlabprofessionals,359hgo,Kailey20,2,Fri May 8 07:13:26 2015 UTC,That sounds awesome. How did you go about getting a rural job? Did you go through a recruiter? Theres a quest factory near me and a low paying hospital and both seem unappealing.
medlabprofessionals,359hgo,Sibby123,1 point,Fri May 8 08:17:47 2015 UTC,I moved here before applying for the job. It just worked out that there was an opening in the lab I'm currently in after about a year of living out here (I had a crazy commute somewhere else for that year).
medlabprofessionals,359hgo,saraithegeek,2,Fri May 8 19:28:38 2015 UTC,"A ""busy"" day would be about 10 patients.   Whoa! I work at a 25 bed hospital as well and a busy day for us is like 300 patients.  It's amazing the differences in critical access hospitals. Do you not serve outpatients??"
medlabprofessionals,359hgo,Sibby123,1 point,Fri May 8 16:40:48 2015 UTC,"Nope! The clinic has their own lab. They're owned by someone else who's tried to buy us out about 3 times, so maybe that'll eventually change."
medlabprofessionals,359hgo,saraithegeek,2,Fri May 8 19:26:35 2015 UTC,"Wow, interesting. Seems a little odd to have all that instrumentation and not really be using it. What's your test menu like?"
medlabprofessionals,359hgo,Sibby123,1 point,Fri May 8 19:36:54 2015 UTC,"We do all our micro in-house (I was surprised by that), blood bank is done manually, CBC/Diffs, ESR, UA, our chemistry is fairly basic. We do Trop, CK, TSH, CMP/BMP, a few drug levels...thinking about it, it's not really lacking. We don't do stuff like cholesterol or Lymes. But like I said, the people who own the clinic have been looking to buy out the hospital/lab for years, so that might change eventually."
medlabprofessionals,359hgo,saraithegeek,2,Fri May 8 19:51:29 2015 UTC,"At my hospital we have a pretty extensive micro department as well- I guess a lot of CAHs will refer micro or only do urine cultures. We don't do mycology or virology (beyond kit tests) and we refer a couple of bugs for serotyping (mostly foodborne pathogens like E. coli O157:H7) but otherwise yeah, we do it all. I'm hoping we'll investigate bringing aptima CT/NG in house as we have good volume on that but it seems right now there is no benchtop solution for that.   Blood bank still 100% manual but we do have gel. We do the normal stuff plus antibody ID and antigen typing for the rh antigens, K, and Fya as needed. I'm sorta meh about gel mostly because our reference lab doesn't use it so a lot of the stuff that we pick up but can't identify, they don't even see.  Chemistry we don't send much out. We do routine chemistries, trop/ck/myo, lipid panels, hormones including TSH, testo, FT4/FT3, and cortisol, the only common drug we don't do is tacro, vitamins D/B12/folate, A1Cs, CEA etc. Oh and we do HIV/HCV/HBsAg/HBsAb by CMIA.  In heme we're still doing ESRs by hand, I think mostly because my boss worries that if we automate it'll encourage docs to order them, haha. We just do PT/PTT/Fbg/dimer, no mixing studies or anything strange. I'd like to see a platelet function assay brought in house since we cannot transport them to the ref lab within the time limit so we're still doing ivy bleed times (ugh).  So yeah, our test menu is nuts for a CAH and it's a strange mix of automated and manual. But it keeps us busy, anyway."
medlabprofessionals,359hgo,Zodnick11,2,Fri May 8 20:09:15 2015 UTC,"Most rural hospitals will have a higher base pay than hospitals in the city, because they want/need to lure people out of the cities to work in the smaller locations. Most people don't see rural areas as a desirable place to work so they don't look out that way.   One of my classmates actually accepted a job in a rural area near my city and she's starting out making $25/hr with a $2000 sign on bonus. She's on call on the weekend and if she gets called in its time and a half. She does have to stay on with them for at least 2 years to get that sign on bonus."

medlabprofessionals,359hgo,saraithegeek,2,Fri May 8 14:28:03 2015 UTC,"I interviewed for a 15 bed ""hospital."" They have 2 techs on days, one at night. They do phlebotomy after the single phlebotomist goes home.  They know all the staff because there's only 75 of them, so they're like a big work family. There's maybe 60 tests a day. Only hematology and chemistry, anything beyond the basics is a sendout. One of their night techs is using the 2-3 hour breaks between patients to study for PA school. The techs are encouraged to knit, read, or watch TV in their downtime.  Because it is part of a large hospital group, the pay was the same as the large hospitals."

If you interview with people from HR, they probably talk about salary. But you have to bring it up if they still don't mention it at the end of the interview. They are selling you a job opportunity and you are selling yourself, it has to be a fair trade."
medlabprofessionals,3580g4,yourbuttstinks,2,Fri May 8 01:02:16 2015 UTC,That's the only time you can negotiate (if you choose to).   You can negotiate at any time. I typically negotiate as soon as I get the job offer because they've already decided they want to hire me based on my qualifications. I feel like waiting until the offer comes is a bit better because it gives the hiring person more time to talk to the wages people and see if they can get me the amount I'm asking for.
medlabprofessionals,3580g4,NotSureMyself,3,Sat May 9 14:18:52 2015 UTC,I disagree. Most interviews aren't even with the people who set your salary- that would be HR. The time to negotiate is when you have a job offer.
medlabprofessionals,3580g4,saraithegeek,1 point,Fri May 8 01:29:01 2015 UTC,"I just had an interview with a section manager (I was transferring within the same lab). HR never got in touch with me. I asked the manager about the pay rate, she found a piece of paper from the cabinet and told me about the pay and diff.   What if they offer you the job right there? You are gonna have to bring it up.   To me, knowing how much they are willing to pay me at the interview helps keep a realistic expectation. If they are paying me five bucks lower I expect, I would wanna skip considering when I get out of the door."
medlabprofessionals,3580g4,yourbuttstinks,2,Fri May 8 01:57:49 2015 UTC,"I have never been offered a job during the job interview. Obviously if they offer you a job right then and there, yes, it's something you are going to have to discuss. But otherwise, I feel it's much more appropriate to save that discussion for after the interview."
medlabprofessionals,3580g4,saraithegeek,1 point,Fri May 8 02:28:13 2015 UTC,"Hope you don't mind me asking, what's so inappropriate about asking the pay rate at the interview? Interview is for employer and potential employees to discuss a chance of working together. They ask tons of questions about what the applicants can offer the company, with questions as stupid as ""why do you think we should consider you over other candidates?"" Asking about the rate is applicant's way to learn about what the company can offer, other than getting to work for them (boohoo!)."
medlabprofessionals,3580g4,yourbuttstinks,2,Fri May 8 03:05:40 2015 UTC,"Well, for starters as I mentioned before the people interviewing you may have no control over your salary anyway- usually that's handled by HR. So it might be pointless.  Secondly, and this is my personal opinion, I think it's tacky and unprofessional. No one is going to argue that the reason that we all go to work every day isn't to make money. It's obvious. I love my job but I wouldn't be showing up if they weren't paying me. Equally, how much money a job pays does often factor into whether you take the job or not. But doing so at the interview before they've even offered you a job feels premature and rather like counting your chickens before they've hatched.  I don't quite see what harm it does to wait, whereas if you bring it up in the interview and the interviewer feels like I do, that it's tacky before you have a job offer, you're potentially making yourself look bad. It's a fine line to dance but it's not like a job offer is a binding contract. If anything, them offering the job shows they want you and gives you more chips to negotiate with."
medlabprofessionals,3580g4,saraithegeek,1 point,Fri May 8 03:19:11 2015 UTC,"Maybe I'm just more realistic. I still don't get why it would be unprofessional. By scared to look bad or whatever, it makes you look so... ""inequal."" Like they are above you, or you are begging for a job, or at their mercy. If you don't wanna negotiate there is fine too, but they know how much they are gonna offer to pay you. You are interviewing them too, so it's to me better to gather all the information for you too. I walk  away if the price is too low. I don't waste time hoping for a good price.   It would be silly to think that the employer would think much higher of the applicant just because he or she didn't ask about the pay. They fully expect that question.   That's just me. :)"

People of class may have money, they may use money, but they don't talk about it except in the abstract. Same deal with that ridiculous thing where someone makes an offer by writing a number on a piece of paper laid face down. It's not because they're afraid of spies; it's because actually saying numbers out loud like two traders haggling in a marketplace would be gauche.  Same deal with ""if you have to ask how much it costs, you can't afford it."" It's not just to say that whatever-it-is is so expensive it would give you massive sticker shock; it's to say that if you're poor enough that you have to think about money, such luxuries are not meant for you.  Of course, this is all very convenient for employers: you want to negotiate with them, yet the etiquette of the situation makes it awkward and difficult, which gives them power."

Interestingly, while I don't feel that the interview is a good time to talk about salary I do think almost any other time is appropriate. I vocally denounce policies which try to prevent employees from talking about their pay. It's supposed to be rude to discuss your pay, but the truth is if a coworker is making more than me, I'm not going to care unless they don't deserve it. Obviously someone with decades of experience should make more, but if I found out a new male hire with the same experience as me is making more, you'd better believe hell is about to be raised.  Incidentally, is the whole piece of paper face down thing something you've actually encountered? I sort of thought that was a movie thing although to be honest I would think it was awesome if someone actually did that to me in a job interview."

medlabprofessionals,3580g4,Codykb1,2,Fri May 8 04:22:18 2015 UTC,"Common themes in my interviews:   Pre-read your resume and get familiar with your experience. Instrumentation, reagent kits, previous employment especially if it's in a research setting. In my experience, they typically start an interview asking about your previous experiences Prepare for a wide variety of behavioural questions. You can look up a lot of typical ones online. Think about the duties an MLT have, and how ""soft skills"" apply to our jobs. Teamwork/conflict resolution, proactive vs reactive, customer satisfaction (ie. physicians/RNs). Some atypical questions specific to the field might be why you want to be an MLT, what you like/don't like about certain departments, etc. This is where I'll address arrogance vs confidence - everyone has dislikes, everyone has weaknesses. Don't try to convince them otherwise. Dress well, chill out on the scents, bring extra copies of your resume in case HR didn't print extras I was asked a lot of theory in my interviews, and did practical exams. Up to you if you want to study the theoretical stuff. If they do, they will usually ask more about applied things (QC/cal, troubleshooting an abnormal high/low, sources of error) Accept your weakness as a new student but also use it as a strength (eager beaver, practice good habits, well versed with technology and computers [hopefully]) Prepare questions in the end. What do they like or not like about their job? Instruments? etc.   It's easy to say don't be nervous, but interviewers know that the people they interview are nervous. THey often give wiggle room for that. They are not looking for 100% right answers, but rather that you can reason your way to an answer that's decently close to being correct. If you're a new grad you are not expected to be able to answer everything perfectly but they expect you to try your best."
medlabprofessionals,3580g4,twgy,1 point,Fri May 8 01:03:39 2015 UTC,"Recurring common pointers for interviews keep coming up because they're important:   Do your research about the hospital or company that you're applying to.  Your interviewer may ask you generally, ""...so what do you know about [lab X]?""  If you don't know much at all, they may wonder why you're even applying for a position there.  I assume it'd be a good idea of the test menu offered, the various departments, the community that the lab serves, what markets they're trying to grow into, etc.   Dress for success!  Look professional.  I don't think most laboratorians are looking for someone with excellent fashion sense.  You're aiming to look like a clean-cut, hardworking, team-player.  Don't overwhelm them with bling, perfume, or body-odor. Topics to avoid:  Salary and benefits are important, but try to avoid these items when talking with people who will be your technical supervisors.  Good times to bring this topic up would be: If your interviewer brings it up first, if you're interviewing with someone from human-resources who deals with salary/benefits, or if they like you and you're being brought back for a second interview  to hash out details. Confidence shouldn't become arrogance unless it's accompanied by a bunch of other negative personality issues like excessive pride, smugness, attempting to project superiority over someone else, etc.  As long as you are pairing confidence with friendliness and earnestness, I don't think you'll run into issues.   Just remember that your work until this point made you impressive enough on paper that they asked you for an interview!  By the interview phase, a good chunk of the time they just want to see if you'll fit in with the rest of the team. Good luck!"

medlabprofessionals,3580g4,llama726,1 point,Fri May 8 15:28:31 2015 UTC,"Bring some good questions, take the time to prep for each individual interview (do your research).  If you are interviewing for a specific department, brush up on your knowledge.  For instance, in a recent interview for a Micro position I was asked what I would do if a bacteria acted unusual for what it was supposed to be, I brought up lactose-fermenting Salmonella as an example and explained that I would consult my co-workers and do further tests to confirm the ID.  Pay should be discussed after or during the actual offer for employment.  As a student you probably have little to no negotiation powers in this.  You can get an idea (usually) from sites like Glassdoor.com or sites like it.  It will probably be on the low end of the spectrum.  Also thank them in writing (email or snail mail) within about 24-48 hours after the interview."

medlabprofessionals,357qys,saraithegeek,2,Thu May 7 20:50:47 2015 UTC,"Agreed.  Marketability is huge.  I've analyzed our HR payscale, and at 5 years, there is a decent bump in starting pay built in.  So, I know that--no matter what you can do--if you have X years, you'll be in column X on the payscale.  No matter what you can do, HR will offer the amount in that column.  How you sell yourself when I interview you lets me know in detail how your X years of experience make you superior to someone else's years.  That determines how badly I want to hire you, and whether or not I need to let HR know that we need to go higher if possible.

Remember, though, that you cannot expect too much of an increase when you move from a job that pays well to a an area that does not pay well.  Chances are you are being paid more now than a lot of the senior CLSs at the hospital you are thinking of moving to.

medlabprofessionals,354u72,SirAzrael,1 point,Thu May 7 23:12:12 2015 UTC,"If your interview is anything like mine was, they'll have a copy of your transcript, and will probably ask you about your past grades. Explain to them what happened, and if your grades since starting again are better, they'll notice that. I just recently got accepted into a program, and my GPA is somewhere around a 3.05. If you're good with interviews, that will also be a huge help. I originally wasn't accepted into the program, and was placed at the top of the alternate list, and when the lady who did the interview called to tell me, she said the only reason I hadn't been accepted was because I didn't do super well in the interview"
medlabprofessionals,354u72,nubcakefactoryy,2,Fri May 8 02:53:51 2015 UTC,"It depends on the standards of the program. Mine really wanted a 3.2 GPA.

I have since brought up my GPA, but they did let me into the upper division. Just depends on what they want. It doesn't hurt to try applying, and it also doesn't hurt to speak with the program director and ask them to be realistic with you, that's what I did.

medlabprofessionals,354u72,xenuxpwns,2,Thu May 7 23:13:15 2015 UTC,"Like everyone else said, you definitely still have a good chance. I would retake as many courses as you can and replace your original grades to boost your gpa.   What programs are you looking to apply for? If they're in California, be advised that it is very competitive. If you're looking at other states, you have a pretty good chance of getting in just based off of grades.  Make sure you get clinical lab experience before you apply. Either get a job at a clinical lab or get volunteer experience at the clinical lab on your campus. Most applicants without clinical experience have a slim chance of getting in. To put it into perspective, if the committee has to make a decision between you with say, a 3.1 gpa and clinical experience and someone else with a 3.4 gpa and no clinical experience, you would have a pretty good chance of getting in because you have clinical lab experience over the other person. Be aware that most programs don't care much about research lab experience so that won't yield much of an advantage.  Just my two cents after not getting in the first time I applied. I got in after my second time applying because I increased my gpa a bit and because I had about 7-8 months of clinical lab experience at the time of application. Going to start training in August.  Good luck!"

medlabprofessionals,354u72,xenuxpwns,2,Thu May 7 11:00:19 2015 UTC,Thank you!  It is very hard. I couldn't work a full-time job (and couldn't find a part-time job) as a Master's student so I called up literally every single clinical lab in the Southern Ca area to convince someone to take me on as a volunteer but no one would take me because of liability. I finally convinced the head CLS at the clinical lab on campus to take me as a volunteer after a while. This is why I suggested you volunteer at the lab on your campus. Be persistent but polite and sincerely explain to them why you want to volunteer with them.  Hope this helps.

medlabprofessionals,354u72,gingerlovingcat,1 point,Mon May 11 05:31:02 2015 UTC,"Sorry if this is such an off topic question, I was wondering if you were able to get research or internship experience during your undergrad in CSUN? Im still debating whether i should go to a UC or CSU. Research isn't really my priority but im just curious :)"
medlabprofessionals,354u72,xenuxpwns,2,Sun May 24 04:43:18 2015 UTC,"The great thing about CSU's, but especially CSUN, is that you have incredible amounts of opportunity to gain research experience. Internships are hard to come by anywhere nowadays so I wasn't able to find an internship.   Labs on campus are great about taking undergrads. Before I had any inkling I'd be doing a Master's, I did a semester of pretty basic research in Dr. Oppenheimer's lab. He takes TONS of undergrads so much of the research in his lab can be monotonous and simple but just about every other lab (excluding Dr. Malone's) are great about assigning undergrads their own projects that are comparable to Master's level work. We also have two mentoring programs designed specifically for minorities and underprivileged students that want to pursue a career in research and go on to get a PhD.   When it comes to the UC's it is much more difficult to secure a position in a research lab. One of our undergrad labbies transferred to UCLA last year. As we've been catching up every so often, he's said that depending on your major option, you may be required to do a semester of research in a lab or take some extra classes IIRC. Those that chose to do research in lieu of taking extra classes must choose a lab off of a list of labs that are willing to work with undergrads and then of course you must meet with and gain the approval of the PI in charge in order to do the research.   A couple of my professors have also stated multiple times that they've been told by various companies that they're much more inclined to hire students graduated from CSUN than UCLA because CSU's but especially CSUN require students to take lab components to almost all courses whereas at UC's most courses required of Bio majors do not have lab components. This basically means undergrads coming out of CSUN have some working laboratory knowledge and are able to pick things up quicker in that type of setting because they've been exposed to it so much. This has also been verified by my friend who transferred to UCLA. He said that was one of the two jarring differences he saw between CSUN and UCLA and that it's been pretty odd learning about things but not practicing them in a lab setting like he did for almost every science class at CSUN. I have heard UC's and CSU's explained in the following way as well: Go to a UC if you want to go to med school/pharmacy school/dental school but go to a CSU if you want to get a job or go to grad school. UC's focus almost completely on the theoretical whereas CSU's split evenly between the theoretical and the practical.  Finally, I will say that another leg-up CSUN has over UC's is that CSUN actually has a Med Tech major option so you can actually major in Med Tech and take all the prereqs plus a couple of non-prereq but preferred courses all in one go. We do not have a training year component though. There has been talk about starting one up for a few years but since CSULA snatched up Quest in West Hills and one of the other programs is now working with Northridge Hospital, I personally don't see it happening. I personally majoring in Biotechnology, not Med Tech, mostly because I didn't know what a Med Tech was and neither did the pre-health counselor Dr. Richardson when I asked her. I don't regret the decision though. I ended up taking immunology as an undergrad purely because I was interested in it and then took the other courses as a grad student. I had a pretty good experience here as an undergrad so I may be biased though my grad student experience hasn't been as good.  Anyway. This ended up being a much longer reply than I intended but I hope I answered your question. Let me know if you have any more questions."
medlabprofessionals,354u72,hervana,1 point,Sun May 24 06:10:10 2015 UTC,"I've spent a whole lot of time researching and comparing curriculum offerings between certain UC and CSU schools, and I agree that CSU's offer more extensive laboratory work, at least in the context of microbiology. In CSU schools like cal poly pomona, SLO, CSUN, SDSU, SJSU, CSULB, most if not all their microbio classes have 3-hour laboratory components once or twice per week. While UC's like SD, Irvine , and Davis only offer three types of labs: Biochemistry, General Microbio, and DNA labs. Anyway, I'm not interested on doing research or going to a medschool so a UC sounds like a waste of money for me.  Thank you for this long, thought out response. I appreciate it! :)"
medlabprofessionals,354u72,xenuxpwns,1 point,Wed May 27 04:55:22 2015 UTC,Check your local hospitals. I volunteered in histology. I didn't do much other than file slides and such but the schools I applied to were happy to see that I was trying to have some experience in that environment.  My 2 years of research at a neuroscience  lab didn't hurt either. I got that job through my school and it started as a volunteer position.
medlabprofessionals,354u72,hervana,1 point,Thu May 7 19:05:37 2015 UTC,Thanks for the input; I really appreciate it!! Im currently entering sophomore at my university as a microbiology major here in California. I'm very lab oriented and I've always wanted to work in a clinical lab setting so MLS / CLS is perfect for me.
medlabprofessionals,354u72,SirAzrael,1 point,Thu May 7 22:21:47 2015 UTC,I'd highly suggest finding a lab at your university to volunteer at! Good luck :)
medlabprofessionals,354u72,hervana,1 point,Thu May 7 22:25:23 2015 UTC,"If you know somebody, or even know somebody who knows somebody that works in a lab somewhere, that's a pretty effective way of getting your foot in the door. My dad is retired AF, and he worked at the base hospital and knew a couple people who worked in the lab. He talked to them and they helped me get set up as a volunteer over the summers when I was home from college"
medlabprofessionals,354u72,gingerlovingcat,1 point,Fri May 8 03:00:03 2015 UTC,Why do you say they don't care about research experience? I got in to both mls schools I applied to and they were very impressed with my research experience.  It was in a neuroscience lab at my university.
medlabprofessionals,354u72,hervana,2,Thu May 7 19:07:11 2015 UTC,"Because the first time around, I only had research experience and received only one interview. After getting clinical lab experience, I had a bunch more. I was also told by one program coordinator that I needed clinical lab experience to be more competitive. This time around during one of my interviews, I was even told point-blank that being a Master's student would not give me an advantage by a program director. Maybe my story is different because I only applied to schools in California?"
medlabprofessionals,354u72,gingerlovingcat,1 point,Thu May 7 22:51:01 2015 UTC,"That explains it. California is different. I've heard it's much harder there, and only there. Not sure why CA is different than every other state in the US."
medlabprofessionals,354u72,xenuxpwns,1 point,Thu May 7 23:14:17 2015 UTC,I think there are two reasons for it. The first is that there are way more applicants because most people want to stay in Ca or move here. The second is that there are stricter requirements to work in Ca as a CLS which translates to stricter training programs.
medlabprofessionals,354u72,hervana,1 point,Fri May 8 02:43:17 2015 UTC,"Probably depends on the school? It's very competitive here in California so I think they want the applicants to have some sort of experiences specifically in a clinical lab setting. Obviously, if the research experience  involved similar to that, it's definitely going to help you."
medlabprofessionals,354u72,oiboyz,1 point,Thu May 7 22:28:35 2015 UTC,"Ohh yes I've heard about California. It's totally different there than it is in other states, isn't it? a whole different test too right?"
medlabprofessionals,354u72,hervana,1 point,Thu May 7 23:13:18 2015 UTC,"The board exam is the same ASCP that other states have, but yeah, I hear it's much harder to get an internship."
medlabprofessionals,354u72,oiboyz,1 point,Wed May 20 02:34:22 2015 UTC,really. I was told it was a completely different exam.
medlabprofessionals,354u72,hervana,1 point,Wed May 20 02:37:05 2015 UTC,I understand that California used to have its own exam but then it adopted ASCP.
medlabprofessionals,354u72,gingerlovingcat,1 point,Thu May 21 23:18:00 2015 UTC,I guess not everyone knows yet! I was in an intro to MLS class last fall semester and everyone who came to talk mentioned how CA was totally different in that respect.
medlabprofessionals,354u72,almondjoy12,1 point,Fri May 22 02:30:21 2015 UTC,"I'm in Kentucky. I'm not gonna lie, I do want to move to California after I finish school. Isn't there a separate certification for CA, though? Do I have any chance of graduating in Kentucky and getting a job there? And yeah, lab experience is my number one goal at this point. I'm hoping to get in as a volunteer at a hospital or something here.  Thanks, and congrats!"
medlabprofessionals,354u72,CylonBunny,1 point,Thu May 7 23:16:14 2015 UTC,"Thank you and you're welcome!  You would have to double check but CA has stricter requirements for working here so that means the programs in CA fulfill those requirements. If you want to work in CA, you must have trained at a program that is as stringent as CA programs. As far as I know (you should double-check) there are a handful of programs that are as stringent as CA programs.  Other than that, I think you may have to work for a few years and then retake your certification exam or maybe CA state exam if the program you trained at was not as stringent as CA programs. Again, make sure you double-check this info."
medlabprofessionals,354u72,masgrada,1 point,Fri May 8 03:10:28 2015 UTC,"When I was applying for mine, I was trying to recover my grades after having short-term memory loss due to a medication I had been taking. My grades were the worst they've ever been. My program required at least a C in any of the required pre-reqs. I was switching from pre-pharmacy, so a lot of the pre-reqs were the same, only pharmacy required more advanced versions. I had a C- in one semester of my A&P class, but since it was a more advanced version, the program director let it slide and I got accepted. My program just requires that you maintain a 3.0 semester gpa once you start the professional phase. I've been averaging about a 3.8 since starting mine. The past doesn't have to define you, as long as you're passionate about what you're doing and work hard to reflect that. I think you should apply."
medlabprofessionals,354u72,mattpCO,2,Thu May 7 10:38:49 2015 UTC,"My university requires a C in all classes for them to count toward your degree, so no problem there. I think (and I think I've got a couple professors who will write letters of recommendation verifying this) that my enthusiasm will help a lot."
medlabprofessionals,354u72,SirAzrael,1 point,Thu May 7 23:18:19 2015 UTC,"My program also looked at the whole picture, I only had a 2.7 GPA.   You may also want to ask why the program is so lenient on grades though. I started class with 33 students and only 20 of us made it to the end. MLS school is hard."
medlabprofessionals,354u72,mattpCO,1 point,Thu May 7 16:21:05 2015 UTC,"I did exactly what you're doing, ComSci>MLS. If comp sci was too hard, MLS is no easier. From your potential majors, sounds like you're a real glutton for punishment."
medlabprofessionals,354u72,SirAzrael,2,Thu May 7 19:13:26 2015 UTC,"The thing is, I didn't find CS difficult, I just got burnt out on it. I spent my entire childhood just doing computers and I finally admitted to myself that I hated it. Med tech is definitely a tough program, but I'm way more enthusiastic about it than I ever was about programming. :D  edit: holy grammar, batman"
medlabprofessionals,354u72,mattpCO,1 point,Thu May 7 23:02:29 2015 UTC,"As others have stated, programs will look at your whole picture. Do not discount yourself and always be positive. I graduated in 2011 and it took me three years to be placed into a program-an online one, but I will sit for the same exam, and have the same certification when I am done with my program at Allen College based out of Iowa. I applied to 20-30 hospital and uni programs, from coast to coast. I was accepted into Baptist health (think that was name) based out of Arkansas but deferred due to personal issues (huge mistake at that time). allencollege.edu is a good place to start-online programs do require the motivation and much of the teaching to be taken on by the student. You must be dedicated, good at time management, and able to use various resources to learn concepts. There are no recorded lectures with my program, and we have to make it to Iowa 5-6 times during the year for on campus events. If this is the career you want, make it very evident and write your cover letter/personal statement tailored to each institution. Hope this helps-PM me if you have questions."

medlabprofessionals,3537tj,livin_the_life,2,Thu May 7 06:05:43 2015 UTC,"It's gonna cost me around 40-45k for my degree so financial aid is mostly covering it(Thank you Minnesota!). At my CC currently its about 6.5k a year which includes tuition and textbooks going there for 3 years since I took some general classes required for the MLT degree first or else the workload wouldve been huge(1 semester required 20 credits). After this I'm going to transfer to a state school via articulation and depending on the school itll be 9-12k a year( just tuition and books.) So there's a brief example of my gameplan and costs.

Edit: sticker price for undergrad was $60k/year but most folks don't end up paying that. My total was around $70K. My uni was mostly preparing students for the professional tracks like med/dent/law/grad school but I found a great mentor and support system while taking a micro class at a nearby college in junior year.

medlabprofessionals,3537tj,xe2bls,1 point,Fri May 29 11:20:27 2015 UTC,"I took the Microbiology certificate, not the full generalist MLS certificate. So it took 19 credits at a bit lower than $552 since they increased the price yearly.  http://smhs.gwu.edu/medical-laboratory-sciences/programs/certificate/curriculum/microbiology  I knew that I wanted to work in Micro specifically so that kind of binds me to large hospitals with Micro departments unless I cross train for a generalist cert but I am loving what I do. Most of the techs I work with are MT's but I didn't feel I was at a disadvantage. Next step would probably be Health Informatics rather than horizontally in the lab.  I think the most cost effective way if one already has a BS in some related science field to transition to MLS might be doing the on-site NAACLS accredited programs that put you through a year or two of both didactic and practical training. Some cost around 3k. If I were as passionate about the other disciplines I would have taken that route."
