A company bought out the company I was working for, and I was the only one that stuck through the buyout/merger timeframe from the developer team.  So a few months later, when I decided to go independent, they had to hire me as a consultant just to keep things running.  I also took on more work from a local dev shop that needed more devs for the amount of work they had.  4-5 months of steady work, plus doing work for my old company.  Now I've been doing contract work for about a year.  Helpful tips: * Start an LLC.  Lets people know you're serious.  Gives you some legal separation. * Set up separate business checking/savings accounts * Make good connections with recruiters.  These will be some of your most important contacts, so treat them as such.  Larger recruiting firms (TekSystems, etc) are going to have ins with larger companies.  Smaller, local firms will have more connections to smaller firms in your area.  Make connections with both! * Do not be the stereotypical ""not my problem"" consultant.  Focus on doing a really good job (unit tested code, good architecture, etc).  If you can do that, people will want you back, and when your contracts are up, you'll have to choose from several opportunities.  And the recruiters will be giving you their best clients, because they know you'll do a good job for them. * Get involved in local user groups, tech communities, etc.  Its how you will make connections."

Honestly, with my new company, they seem much better at getting rid of unnecessary or inefficient people.

Performance was much easier for them to quantify, whereas here things are more operationally focused, and the IT dept is seen purely as a cost center. Any structure that exists here is implemented by me because there's no one else working on development - Unit tests, automation etc. Hell, most days when I release a test build, no one tests it when I request. Logs show the only IP to connect is mine.   It's been a real eye opener, because in my previous experience, everything I did was a potential money maker, and my value as an asset to the company was measured differently because the things I did were directly related to making sales. Now, they are, but in different ways -- if the system is working (point of sale) sales can happen, but I no longer create the product.  I left there because I felt like I'd hit a glass ceiling.

For example, abort the Create event if the file size is zero bytes. Then once the file is done being written it should fire the Changed event -- which you then use to copy the thing.  I know this is an overly simplified explanation to what is likely a complicated problem. Add on top of that the FileSystemWatcher being super chatty makes for no fun."

csharp,3e3b4g,agileone,6,Tue Jul 21 19:36:22 2015 UTC,"I haven't done a whole lot with the FileSystemWatcher myself, but any time I am throwing a Thread.Sleep in a loop, I tend to ask myself if there is a better way (and I've found there usually is).  So I threw together a quick console app to play around and tested by copying a 7GB file on my local file system.  Quick note - network shares may or may not behave like this - I don't have a network share handy at the moment to verify but I vaguely remember reading about limitations depending on the server and file share types.    The code below uses the change event that the FileSystemWatcher throws when files change in the watched folder (you can wire up the created event also just to be sure).  I fired it up in the debugger and started copying a large file to the temp folder.  Right off, the FS watcher object fires a created event and a changed event almost simultaneously, which if you picked those up and started copying would certainly lead to a bad copy.  However, after the file copy dialog got to 100% I saw another change event fire that you might be able to leverage for determining that a file copy operation has completed.  This behavior seemed pretty consistent, even when I added a few NotifyFilters to see if it was a particular change type causing the event and saw the same results filtering on Attribute changes and LastWrite changes both independently.  You might try others to see if you can narrow it down, although  using this behavior to log a file name during the first change event (add to list, etc), and then confirming it's ready for processing when you get the second event (which indicates that the file operation is finished and it's ready to copy) seems like it might actually work.  Again, I'm not an expert on the object but this would definitely be my preferred approach over blocking a thread operation.  https://gist.github.com/rbibbey/512e30362453675c8fdd  EDIT: Looks like /u/AfroPhysics beat me to the punch on this one. :)"

Alternatively, you could use the database diagram feature of SSMS (assuming you're using MS SQL), EF's design tool (similar if not almost exactly the same as SSMS db diagrams), or Visio if you have that handy.  There are pros and cons to each depending on the complexity of your schema - I'd say Visio is probably going be a bit more flexible managing and manipulating a very large schema visually, whereas the other options are somewhat lighter on the UI features but offer a more direct path to exporting the diagrams as scripts (database diagrams are immediately ""committed"" and generate the underlying schema, EF not as immediately/requires another step to export, at least last time I did it, etc).  I haven't really found a great solution to designing views, functions, procedures, and other db entities other than by hand (at least not a solution that I've preferred), although I will say Visual Studio has come a long way in recent years... And that of course is all on the database side.  For generating POCOs/DTOs, Entity has been generally good to me for that purpose, but there are other ORMs available (nHibernate, etc) that can generate classes from schema objects - and again there are pros and cons to each.  It takes a little bit of fiddling with these tools to figure out what works best for you in your environment, and which of them offer the right, or best, feature set to meet your needs."

In my case, I am targeting desktop only and don't care about getting on the store (the app will be open source and free), but I think I'm still limited to something like WPF on this project.

But in the long term, WinRT is going to replace Win32 completely, so you won't need to. That fact, IMHO, is what makes WinRT so much better than WPF: Microsoft can't afford to have features unavailable for WinRT apps. ""Just P/Invoke it from Win32"" is not an option in the long-term, so WinRT will eventually get all features Windows has. And that means any language with a WinRT projection can access all of Windows' features without having to write a native wrapper for every little thing."
csharp,3e2auh,SneakyFloorMop,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:17:31 2015 UTC,If I remember correctly the DataSource property will only trigger a refresh of the DataSource if you assign a different DataSource. Since you seem to have a globally declared array specificArmyItems and only assign the same reference to lbArmyUnits.DataSource it will never register that the DataSource changed. You should either create a new Array each time and assign that or set the DataSource to null before reassigning it.  PS: Please don't cast nilly willy ToString() and then compare with stringified values. switch works fine with Integer values to compare to. What you are doing there is also known as the Stringly-Typed Anti-Pattern.

csharp,3dycu7,tweq,4,Mon Jul 20 16:11:32 2015 UTC,"Hmm. I don't seem to recall any other way to refer to the class member of the current instance in scope other than implicit (without the this) or explicit with this.  If I had to guess what you're misreading is the idea that this actually is the fully qualified name, in that it can remove ambiguity between locally declared variables or parameters in a method that share the same name as a class member.  Consider:  class MyClass {     private int value = 5;      public void DoSomething(int value)     {         Console.WriteLine(value); //implicit name, will use the method parameter         Console.WriteLine(this.value); //fully qualified name     } }  var myClass = new MyClass(); myClass.DoSomething(1);  //outputs: //1 //5   That is to say, in the above example, value is the shorthand, and this.value is the fully qualified name.  Reading from the MSDN Documentation on this:   The following are common uses of this:     To qualify members hidden by similar names   So this is how you use fully qualified members, not how you shorthand reference members.  EDIT: Perhaps it will help if you show us where you read that: ""The 'This' keyword states it is short hand for the fully qualified name of the current instance of the class I'm writing."" I personally have not heard it written in exactly this way. (In that it implies that there is an unambiguous fully qualified method for accessing the equivalent of ""this"")"

Now as I read that, its saying that 'this' is only a short hand; a help. I believe, when I did not understand it and read other sources, that -as you say- there is no other way to reference a future instance of a class.  I may have mis read it and maybe you can see what is meant better than I, but it certainly threw me off for am afternoon.  Edit: as you say, implicitly calling Label1 works well, thus the 'this' keyword is a qualified name for the label1 belonging to the form when writing code within the forms class.  It seems my own thoughts were right and the author is either ambigious or ive not understood what he meant right, however I have understood the concept of 'this' keyword right."

This isn't correct. Label is a class name, and the rest of the fully qualified name is either namespaces or containing classes (which act like namespaces). There are no objects involved.

Sweet! a link.   packer2.net.zip  The .NET version of my JavaScript compressor/obfuscator requires the Microsoft .NET Framework version 1.1. It was ported from the original version by Jesse Hansen.

The logging mechanism really depends on the rest of the project. Email, log file, database, Windows log... plenty of options. Obviously, it's important to write error-free, bulletproof code. But even then, there are unforeseen circumstances. What happens if the network cuts out? What if the disk runs out of space? What if your long running service is shut down in the middle? Error handling differs from validation in that regard. Validation is ensuring the program has acceptable input. Error handling covers everything else. One thing, though.

You should not be releasing a product that crashes or fails all the time, it will really quickly piss off the users and give your company a bad reputation.  However I think that startups operate a bit differently, and quick code is valued over quality. Once that code becomes established, it will be revisited often to harden it after all the random edge cases are discovered."

I wanted to make something quick and easy for myself to help move files that were scanned to my computer. Initially I thought to myself, this won't take long, I can do it in a few lines. But when I realized other people could benefit from it in the office, I offered it and realized I can't trust the end user. The biggest issue with making things is, although you as the creator know the limitations, and the parameters of your code - other people will ALWAYS find new and interesting ways to step outside your parameters and constraints. So in short, this program I've been building, more time has been spent making sure it doesn't break due to an error than the actual time it took to make the functions for mapping and moving files.   Tl;dr can't trust the end user so bulletproof your code. More time spent dealing with exceptions and possible errors."

However, let's say you write a class that takes a file path, and returns an array of strings with the file contents. You're going to use this class over and over. Many things could go wrong. File not found errors will be returned by the file system calls. What is the appropriate return value? Null? Empty array? Neither of these communicates what happened. What if one of your programs using this class doesn't pass in a valid string? Or null?  In these cases, you shouldn't make up some bogus default. You should clearly indicate that someone stepped out of bounds. Throw an exception. Then users of this class will get back an accurate response.   Even in my personal programming, if a method expects a non null object, I'll put a null check and throw an exception, because if I write my utility classes right and test them, I'll probably never look at that code again. If I write code that uses that utility class, it needs to barf loud and hard if I hand it garbage. I never want to have to step into that class while debugging."

I guess if you just really like the math, and the challenge with getting your engine code to work the same way on 3000 GPU/Chip/MB combinations, then go for it. You can make a 3d engine from the ground up in C#. It's not the best tool to use, but it can work.  My suggestion, is focus on your game. Build the game logic, the back end, the art.

If you want to make a game use a game engine, they do it better.  If you want to learn all the glorious aspects of 3d games, then use C++(i get you want this to be C# only but hey :I ) and make some cool stuff, heck even javascript and WebGL is a neat alternative.

The challenge, IMO, is to minimise the overhead of leveraging a Microservice design in order to achieve similar, if not better performance than traditional designs, and enjoy the added flexibility.

However, we did mix all of them in one set for a purpose - many people think that JSOn as a format, is ""the fastest"" - which is absolutely not true. I'd say that JSON.Net is the most predictable ""solid"" solution that is out there. Other JSONS just suck when payloads become complex.  And of course ""PROTOBUF serializer is the fastest"" is not true either. Protobuf does not understand polymorphism (even with Marc Gravells DynamicType extensions) and reference cycles (IsReference=True is not a standard ProtoBuf feature that would be cross-platform transparently).
