This is why the corporate mass media should not write about marijuana. Growers have been dealing with spider mites, slugs and mold forever -- to the Pueblo Chieftain this stuff is ""new"". Or are they just interested because of the multi-million dollar aspect?  But this issue illustrates why legalization laws should include the right of people to grow their own marijuana.  We know what corporate America will do with marijuana -- we only have to look at the tobacco industry to learn this.  Marijuana will be industrially farmed using as many chemicals, fertilizers and pesticides as the corporate bean counters determine will generate them the maximum profit from their crop. (And if laboratory GMO alterations show a greater profit, or control of the seed industry, then just like in corn or soybeans, it will be done.)  We should expect that corporate marijuana will have all of the same characteristics as tobacco. The plant will be homogenized, the weed saturated with chemicals to ensure even burning, added artificial flavorings to give different tastes, and all of the other things that are done with tobacco.  Some people might like that; others might object but to be too lazy to grow their own. But others will actually want marijuana that is organic and is as natural as they can get. And that latter group will need the right to grow their own marijuana.  The greed and self-interest of capitalism breeds corruption. We can expect that marijuana corporations will seek to eliminate competition just like they do in all industries (by buying up competitors, forming cartels, using the government to eliminate competitors, etc.).  As such, marijuana corporations will seek to eliminate people's right to grow their own weed. They'll do this in many ways -- citing ""safety"" or purity concerns, saying that children will have access, whatever. We see this today in the trucking industry, for example. Large trucking companies actually lobby the government for more safety regulations. Why? Because it eliminates their mom-and-pop competitors who cannot afford the new regulations.  We'd be stupid to think that marijuana corporations will not evolve along the same lines and will use the same tactics as any other for-profit corporation in a capitalist society. Giving people their full rights to marijuana -- just like beer enthusiasts can brew their own beer or tobacco smokers can grow their own tobacco -- is a key."

Imagine saying this stuff about food? That farmers are evil and only people who grow their own vegetables know what's up. It's preposterous.   As such, marijuana corporations will seek to eliminate people's right to grow their own weed.   Conspiracy theory nonsense. Budweiser isn't trying to prevent people from brewing their own beer, and 'big tomato' isn't trying to prevent you from growing your own tomatoes.

Im hearing you want to be educated, or you just wanna say, that you know you don't know,?.  If it's the former; I think of it like this.  Plants breathe co2, and exhale o2, that means that they are the other half of our duality to our intake of o2 and output of co2. So, me being a denser carbon body, I take it the ""lighter"" density of a plant to balance myself out.  The sun gives every life on earth energy. Plants take this light, turn it into vitaminerals. I consume plants for that raw energy. Animals eat plants for the same reason, when we eat animals we are getting already used energy, to top it off... It's dead.. Absent of ""life"", and probably burned or fried not to mention aged a few weeks.  Most are familar with the symbolism of the human body being a car or a machine. So we treat our bodies like we do our bikes or cars, which breakdown.  Think of our bodies as a spaceship. A much more complex unit than a bike or car. What do we add to spaceships...

But aside from the omnivore/carnivorous aspects, regarding lab rats and scientific research, to be morally consistent one would have to shun huge swaths of medicine and discoveries made by modern science. Do you or people you know do that?  This leads one to ask things like: Is it ""more morally correct"" to eat a chicken that was raised happily on a traditional/non-factory farm and killed as humanely as possible, or to use makeup or some cosmetic/non-essential product that was tested on rabbits and other animals?  Considering that people routinely swat biting mosquitoes and kill bugs and bacteria, let alone the fact that humans rely on medicines tested on lab rats and animals (including humans), I would contend that no one can be morally pure in our relationship to animals.

I don't think more studies will suggest cannabis in it's pure form has an overall negative impact on health, but if they did I would surely reconsider my use."

Marijuana,3dynei,throwweedmyway,16,Mon Jul 20 16:33:37 2015 UTC,"Well, it sounds like you want to stop, or at least take a break.  You can try tapering down if you have some self control. Smoking a joint every night, well, smoke half a joint for a few nights, then on your third or forth night, smoke 1/3 or so. Try to just take a couple hits to calm yourself down a couple nights, then just take one nice toke before bed. Then stop. Get some TylenolPM or melatonin to help you sleep. Watch some movies/netflix/read whatever to keep you busy when you stop, you will get bored, appetite may not be what it was and it may be difficult to sleep. Take vitamin C as THC will deplete your body's supply and it will help w/ cravings. Drink lots of water and STAY BUSY!   Stop for 2-4 weeks to begin to flush yourself out.. if you feel like you want to continue smoking then go ahead and start toking a bit in the evenings again..  you should have much less tolerance after a break.. then just practice moderation, skip some days or just smoke on the weekends. It's all up to you, there are much worse habits to have."
Marijuana,3dynei,phusion,12,Mon Jul 20 17:16:03 2015 UTC,"I'd stop for a while, or only smoke with other people. I had the same feelings you did after years of smoking regularly, especially by myself - it stopped being fun, and felt more like a crutch. Wanting it when you're sober and then regretting it high is the psychological addiction talking.  I don't even have any in the house anymore, but I'll gladly smoke with friends. It makes it more fun and enjoyable when it's a sometimes thing, because it actually feels different and good again. I went from feeling meh when sober to fine when high, and back to feeling fine when sober and great when high."

Marijuana,3dynei,The_Tree_Of_Woe,6,Mon Jul 20 18:56:00 2015 UTC,"Sounds like you could use a break.  I have smoked at about the same rate for the last 3 years as well, with some midday use on weekends while chilling or doing boring stuff like mowing the lawn or laundry.  So far I haven't regretted it for any reason other than I'd lose my job if my employer ever found out.  Since you seem to be regretting it, and quitting outright usually sucks, I would suggest changing up what you're smoking.  I remember one month I got ahold of some weaker sativa compared to my heavy indica and I was more active and didn't get nearly as high from smoking the same amount, yet it satisfied my urge to smoke.  I believe if you can get some milder stuff l, it will help wean you down a bit and reduce paranoia and feeling guilty."

Marijuana,3dynei,GingerBreadManz,2,Tue Jul 21 01:37:27 2015 UTC,"I would quit but do it slowly.  I recommend making some coconut oil infused with cannabis.  Take a teaspoon of the oil every night instead of smoking.  The 2nd night take half a teaspoon and just continue halving your dose throughout the week until you barely need anymore.    Trust me, it's the only way to bypass the night sweats, sleeplessness, nightmares, and anxiety.    The only other way it would be painless would be if it's an emergency and you know you have no choice but to quit.  If you can create that sense of urgency in your mind then you'll quit easily."

It got really expensive lately, no more shwag. And that kind of drove home exactly why I don't like supporting this prohibitionist's market.  I haven't smoked for a few weeks and Im not feeling too weird. I'd say just stop having it around for a while if you can. It was weird the first couple of nights, but its pretty normal now.  And like some other folks are saying on here, try going over to r/leaves.    And also: if you live in a state that says it's cool, go ahead and try growing it if you want to smoke again ever. Seems to me, that if you have to care for and nurture and put work into something you may get a better more satisfying perspective on it.

Marijuana,3dynei,fuckcancer,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:58:05 2015 UTC,"I get bored fast if I don't smoke but when I do smoke it   This right here.  That's what to expect.  This is the warning sign that you're building up a ""dependence""/an ""addiction.""  The thing is though, I wouldn't view it as bad any more detrimental than a caffeine addiction.  But that was the major symptom of marijuana withdrawal that I noticed when I stopped smoking every day.  An unnaturally extreme boredom.  The most bored you could ever possibly be.    That's not nearly as bad as something like withdrawing from a couple months of benzo abuse though.  Coming off of weed isn't exactly a picnic, but it's by far one of the easiest withdrawals to deal with.  Now should you quit?  If you want to.  It's probably not doing you any favors, but it's not really that bad in the long run if you enjoy it, but if you're feeling remorseful and want to stop, than yeah go for it.  Just be prepared to ride the boredness dragon.  You'll also probably get some wicked crazy dreams too.  I did anyway.  Good luck whatever you do, but I really don't think you have anything to feel guilty about if you've only been having 1 joint at night to unwind.  That's equivalent to having a beer at night to unwind in my book as far as harm goes, which is to say not that harmful.  Probably more like having six if you wanted my personal feelings on how inebriated it makes you, but that's up to debate as the effects aren't exactly equal.  It seems more like you're worried about the artificial negative view that society has on people using cannabis than you actually having a problem, but if that's enough to make you want to quit, who am I to judge?  If I had to make a recommendation, I'd say go for it.  Quit for like half a year or something cold turkey.  Ride that boredness dragon out and see if your life gets better.  Take particular notice of how you're life changes at the two month mark, that's a good amount of time to be reasonably sure that you're pretty much back at base.  If your life does get better, great! No reason to go back.  If your life is pretty much the same, which I'd suspect it would be, smoke if you like, or continue not smoking.  It's whatever."

Marijuana,3dvvm0,802-420,5,Mon Jul 20 00:14:51 2015 UTC,"I agree with you, but I find it misleading in context. I'm not sure about the other information they've presented to you but there are many things as or more dangerous than driving stoned including being tired, on prescription meds, on over the counter meds like benadryl, texting, and of course drinking. The context of the handout might lead you to believe that there is a crisis with stoned drivers causing dangerous highways, but that is not the case. I would rather see a program that teaches you to be aware of limitations to your driving ability in any circumstance rather than focusing on marijuana."

I've never blown down and then thought to myself ""I'm going to to go fight this guy"" who was a complete jackass to me earlier, or ""yeah, it's totally ok to wander around this sketchy neighborhood"" looking for a shortcut home at 3 am. The idea that weed will affect your inhibitions and self control in any way, like booze or otherwise, is ludicrous. Anyone who does stupid or violent shit while stoned was that way before they smoked. Worst thing I may do while high is eat the whole bag of chips, after which the fiancÃ©e yells at me.

Marijuana,3dvvm0,Hornashit,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:32:21 2015 UTC,"Well if anything thing the only relevant point from the pamphlet is the second point about it having an effect on your coordination.  I know this won't be a popular opinion here, but you really shouldn't be driving when your high or stoned as balls.  I guess for the rest of the class when they bring up things like it being bad for your health or how it could be a gateway drugs, just keep asking how any of that is relevant to drivers education?"
Marijuana,3dvvm0,Caleb323,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:49:36 2015 UTC,Is is not bad for your health and it most definitely is NOT a gateway drug
Marijuana,3dvvm0,Hornashit,2,Mon Jul 20 03:55:11 2015 UTC,"It can be bad for your health... Weed isn't some miracle drug that has no side effects. And I agree, weed isn't a gateway drug..if anything alcohol is more of a gateway drug than weed"
Marijuana,3dvvm0,bomber991,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:50:43 2015 UTC,How can it be bad for health?
Marijuana,3dvvm0,Hornashit,3,Mon Jul 20 16:38:29 2015 UTC,Inhaling smoke can't be something that is good for your health.
Marijuana,3dvvm0,Jake634,3,Mon Jul 20 23:34:56 2015 UTC,That's just an assumption though. It has been proven that it can't cause lung cancer and it even slightly improves lung capacity. It doesn't do anything bad. It is a natural plant with no additives. It's not like a cigarette which is leaves dried over an entire year until it turns brown and a bunch of unnatural chemicals.
Marijuana,3dvvm0,Hornashit,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:55:14 2015 UTC,"I'm not gonna say that inhaling smoke isn't bad for you, but the ""reasonable"" ""balanced"" supporters of marijuana who preach that smoking it is not good for you and that one should use other methods, never seem to produce any evidence. It seems to be assumed because the precedent has been set with tobacco smoking, but I have yet to see any proof of the logic ""inhaling burning plant matter is bad for you mmk."" The evidence could certainly be out there, but shit man, nobody has seen it!"
Marijuana,3dvvm0,kpanik,0,Tue Jul 21 03:53:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah. At most it may put tar in your lungs, but I think it is completely harmless. No cancer, no breathing problems, nothing. Makes no difference on your life. Toke on."
