Bell peppers are pretty nutritious (just google bell pepper nutrition). If I were you, I'd just add some green vegetables as well.   Maybe saute some spinach and throw it into the mix?

fitmeals,3duf02,LordLightning,6,Sun Jul 19 18:01:27 2015 UTC,Asking the tough questions
fitmeals,3duf02,clutron,4,Sun Jul 19 18:37:34 2015 UTC,"We made these cookies a bunch of times and the flavor really depends on the type of protein powder you use. Everything else (toppings, nuts, etc) is just extra. Protein powder forms the base of the flavor. Our experience of using salted caramel flavor was that we didn't really taste the salted caramel so much. We've had good experience with banana flavored whey."
fitmeals,3duf02,Coolbeans224,2,Sun Jul 19 19:39:35 2015 UTC,"I've made these with vanilla protein powder. And the truth is, nothing like chocolate chip cookies. They're not bad though so if you don't go in expecting them to be like chips ahoy you won't be too disappointed."
fitmeals,3duf02,CSkip,12,Sun Jul 19 21:24:21 2015 UTC,"I used Kim's great recipe as a base but tweaked a few things. First, I doubled everything in her recipe, used  salted caramel protein powder, and in addition to chocolate chips I added chopped hazelnuts. Nuts provide a great contrast to the soft texture of the cookies so highly recommend it!  Ingredients (doubled from Kim's recipe):   2 scoop protein powder (56g) 1 c canned white beans (chickpeas, garbanzo, navy…) (260g) 1/2 c canned pumpkin (120g) 6 T egg substitute (92g) 1 t vanilla 1 t baking powder - Topping of choice (nuts, chocolate chips, anything!) - sweetener of choice (3-6 packets)   Directions:    Blend the chickpeas, pumpkin and egg Stir the remaining ingredients  Portion out the batter, and bake at 350F for 8-10 minutes.    Here is a video with commentary and instructions on how to make the cookies.   The macros for 1/2 batch (realistically I don't think it's possible to eat the whole batch alone in one sitting-- the cookies are very filling):  338cal; 10.5F, 38C, 30P"

fitmeals,3duf02,pajamakitten,3,Sun Jul 19 20:40:53 2015 UTC,egg whites/beaters
fitmeals,3duf02,r0cky,0,Sun Jul 19 21:51:15 2015 UTC,"Made it with a few modifications based on what I had around (no sweetener, no egg substitute):  1c chickpeas 1/2c pumpkin  1 egg + 3 egg whites (too much!!!) 4 Tbsp PB2 (to firm it up because it was super wet from eggs) 2 scoops Optimum Nutrition double chocolate 1 tsp vanilla 1 tsp baking powder 60 g sugar 25g walnuts (all I had) 60 g chocolate chips   Baked for 15 minutes. Good but a bit weird, texture wise, because I had a fairly wet batter. I'd say the bottoms steamed more than caramelized and crisped. Still, I've eaten 5 and they're tasty! The PB2 adds a nice nutty flavor to the whole cookie.  Modified macros for 1/3 batch (4 cookies)- 10 fat / 52 carbs / 27 protein / 380 calories   That real sugar really makes a difference! Next time I might add more protein powder instead of extra sugar, maybe that would've also solved my liquid problem. I bet the recipe would've been better if I'd had all of the things you listed.   Thanks for posting this! You made my morning!   (also, I just hit 185 for the first time today so between your recipe and that I'm feeling good!)"

Instead of making it in a quiche I just saute onions, peppers, and garlic then add some ham and spinach. Beat a couple eggs together and scramble it up, hot sauce over the works at the end.

fitmeals,3dpgj4,Khower,6,Sat Jul 18 05:36:40 2015 UTC,"Recent animal research provides compelling evidence that high-GI carbohydrate is associated with increased risk of obesity. In one study, male rats were split into high- and low-GI groups over 18 weeks while mean body weight was maintained. Rats fed the high-GI diet were 71% fatter and had 8% less lean body mass than the low-GI group."
fitmeals,3dpgj4,tatch,2,Sat Jul 18 07:44:03 2015 UTC,"""A fundamental assumption regarding low-GI foods is that they produce a low glycemic response as a result of a slower rate of digestion of carbohydrate in the intestinal lumen, and that this subsequently slows the absorption of glucose into the circulation (1, 2, 4–7). The plasma glucose concentration, however, is a function of both the rate of appearance of glucose (Raglucose) into the systemic circulation and the rate of disappearance of glucose (Rdglucose) from the systemic circulation. Some properties of foods that may influence Raglucose (ie, glucose absorption from the intestines into the portal and peripheral circulation) include the intrinsic properties of the carbohydrate (eg, gelatinization and amylose-to-amylopectin ratio) and the fiber and fat contents of the food (8–10). The Rdglucose (ie, glucose uptake from the blood by tissue) is primarily influenced by insulin secretion and action on tissue (11). Although glucose is the primary macronutrient that stimulates insulin release, protein may augment insulin release when ingested with carbohydrate (12–14). The rate at which the carbohydrate in a food is absorbed into the blood as glucose can only be inferred by directly measuring the plasma glucose kinetics (ie, Raglucose) and not from the GI. For example, a food can have a low GI as the result of having either a relatively low Raglucose or a relatively high Rdglucose. To our knowledge, no studies comparing the GI of foods have actually measured plasma glucose kinetics. Thus, direct data regarding the underlying factors responsible for differences in the GI of foods seem absent from the literature. Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to describe the underlying glucose kinetics responsible for the different glycemic responses of popular low- and high-GI breakfast cereals (2).""

fitmeals,3dpgj4,tatch,2,Sat Jul 18 10:18:25 2015 UTC,"There is a model of hunger that used glycemic index as satiety. Foods with higher glycemic index is easier to digest and spikes your insulin levels. The insulin spikes and dips a lot compared to lower glycemic foods that keep your insulin levels steady. The dip makes you hungry again can cause many people to overeat. In some people, particularly extremely obese people, the excess in insulin causes the insulin to bind to leptin receptors (the feeling full hormone receptors) in the brain and prevents leptin from binding. Leptin binds at a higher affinity than insulin, but due to the sheer number of insulin to leptin ratio, insulin begins to bind to leptin receptors. Essentially what happens on top of getting hungry sooner, they feel less satisfied and full. I think this is called metabolic syndrome, but I would need to review my notes to be sure. This is part of the reason why many people have trouble with food and tend to over eat.  It's an unpopular model that has been growing in popularity recently. Another reason white bread isn't great is, as another user said, it doesn't have many nutrients compares to wheat, and no fiber.  Edit: clarified the biological processes at play."
fitmeals,3dpgj4,pethebi,1 point,Sat Jul 18 10:21:59 2015 UTC,First of all I like the diEabetes you threw in there but personally I think it's more about how you feel than losing or gaining fat. It's not a surprise to say that a lower GI carb source will fill you up longer and have a steadier feel than the crash associated with high GI carb sources. Any thoughts?
fitmeals,3dpgj4,Lorf30,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:43:09 2015 UTC,"i personally think the difference is going to be so minimal you wouldn't even notice a difference if your calories are on point. nutrient argument is valid. worrying about insulin responses to white bread isn't. When I did my first bodybuilding show the other competitors were bragging about how ""clean"" they ate, Meanwhile I tested the IIFYM model to it's fullest extent. was I healthy? no that's not what I was testing. I ate skittles, milkshakes, sugar cereal every single morning, I ate now n laters, lots of tortilla chips and all the while lost weight, I beat the kids who were bragging about eating clean. Do I advocate for eating junkfood 24/7... no. Because it isn't healthy, but I would argue that calories are far more important than worrying about eating a few slices of white bread. If I can place at my first bodybuilding on mostly ""junk food"". I think the average joe will be fine acheiving their goals on a balanced diet of micro and macro nutrient dense foods. There are variables to this argument such as metabolic rate and caloric consumption at the time, I would say the higher your calories the less impact it will make. Somebody cutting on 3000+ calories(I wish) is far better suited to be able to eat junk than someone with a slow metabolism trying to cut than the other, not from a body composition standpoint but from a health standpoint"
fitmeals,3dpgj4,Khower,-1,Sat Jul 18 16:02:17 2015 UTC,"Wrong.  It is good to be cognizant of glycemic index.  It wasn't created out of thin air to help people with diabetes, it's a very real thing, especially later on in life when metabolism slows down and the body can't bounce back like it did when you were 20.  High, sustained spikes of insulin in your blood promote fat storage, and are more work for your pancreas.  This is not something that only applies to diabetics."

Enriched flour is considered bad because instead of using the whole kernal of wheat, where the protein and nutrients are, they use the easy to gather husks of the wheat and ""enrich"" the flour to put the nutrients (not the protein though) that they didn't get from the kernal.  If you look at the ingredients on the back and you read enriched flour, even if it says enriched wheat flour, it is not as ""good"" for you as 100% whole wheat bread.

I have a Vegetti that I just got recently, and I also have a julienne peeler that I've had for a few years.  I generally only use these on zucchini, so I can't speak to how they work with other veggies.  The julienne peeler is awesome. Just run it down the veggie. This one works well and lets you not use the center of the zucchini which is very seedy  and not as firm as the rest. I do tend to nick my knuckles with it sometimes; it's very sharp.  The Vegetti uses most of the veggie (except for the very center, about 1/2 inch wide), but you're usually left with about 1-2 inches at the end of whatever veggie you're putting in. It has thin and thick options. You have to twist the veggie, and I find it's easy to do a full twist, then pull it out and put it back in again, so you don't end up with super long noodles. It takes a few minutes longer to clean this one and you really need a toothbrush to get into the blades."

fitmeals,3dme3w,galactica216,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:14:37 2015 UTC,I use a mandolin which is very useful in general in my kitchen. It the prospect of veggie noodles sounds good to you then go for it
fitmeals,3dme3w,idamayer,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:21:39 2015 UTC,"I want to start making veggie noodles, and I'm between a mandolin or a spiralizer. The mandolin seems like less of uni-tasker, but I'd welcome some enlightenment on the subject..."
fitmeals,3dme3w,thefourbees,3,Fri Jul 17 18:10:48 2015 UTC,"Sure! So I think the question is how often do you cook and what sorts of things do you make. I agree the mandolin is substantially more versatile. The trade off is that I suspect a spiralizer makes slightly better noodles. The mandolin makes noodles that are shorter, thinner and flatter. They look like this. I believe a spiralizer will make longer and possibly thicker noodles. Also I think it makes curvy noodles, which you can wind up on your fork and look slightly more spaghetti-ish.  Now on to the good things. A mandolin allows you to break down a vegetable lightning fast. If you like cooking it will make your cuts thin, uniform and professional looking. It's flat and takes up little space in your kitchen, easy to clean.  In summary, it makes a lot more than noodles... if you are the sort of person who will make anything besides noodles.  If you're not that into cooking or not sure you'd make a lot of meals besides veggie noodles get the spiralizer. There's nothing a mandolin does that you couldn't do with a good chef's knife and there's no reason to optimize for a task you don't do. But if you like cooking I'd get the mandolin because it just does so much more.   Overall, given the choice again I would still get the mandolin hands down. If you do get a mandolin get a cut resistant glove for it. This thing is sharp and it will take the end of your finger off without a bit of hesitation if you give it the chance."
fitmeals,3dme3w,idamayer,3,Fri Jul 17 18:29:56 2015 UTC,"Thanks, this is exactly what I expected. I'll try the mandolin first, and get a spirializer later if I don't like the noodles. Its space cost (tiny apartment) I'm worried about more than the financial cost. Also, I have a Kevlar glove already that I picked up at a restaurant supply store for $3. I heard the guards for mandolins are garbage and the gloves are the way to go. Thanks for the advice!"
fitmeals,3dme3w,thefourbees,2,Fri Jul 17 20:43:15 2015 UTC,Cool! Send me a picture of your veggie noodle dish after you get one.
fitmeals,3dme3w,idamayer,2,Fri Jul 17 21:33:55 2015 UTC,"I just realized my mandolin has a julienne blade! I haven't tried it yet.   I mainly use my mandolin for cabbage. I shred a whole head on the super thin blade, then I've got a bag full of cabbage I can easily toss into any dish for some crunch/bulk/fiber."

fitmeals,3dme3w,cuddlewench,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:42:12 2015 UTC,"I bought one of the handheld ones on Amazon recently but didn't care for it. The noodles were too frail and didn't hold up well.   I then bought an Inspiralizer and love it. Makes perfect noodles, is easy to store and clean and had a few blade options which are ready to switch out. It's better than that Paderno one that's supposed to be top of the line.  I stir fry and toss with an Asian peanut sauce I've made and it's yummy! Carrots are next on my list to try."
fitmeals,3dme3w,domin007,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:32:13 2015 UTC,"I have something like this but a different brand and a mandolin slicer.    Mandolin:  You get a ton of use out of it, whether it be for dicing up onions super quickly or shredding carrots.  You can make pretty decent zucchini noodles or whatever using it and it takes a lot less time than using the handheld.    Handheld:  I like it for filling a specific niche.  I got mine for 5 dollars and it makes slightly more spagetti-like noodles as well as pretty good shoestring fries.  It's also just kind of fun to turn your veggies around in it.    Overall, I'd maybe hold out for a mandolin before getting a spiralizer unless you already have one, but they're fun to have."
fitmeals,3dmihz,mishley,3,Fri Jul 17 13:59:25 2015 UTC,"I've never had what you're describing, but based on my knowledge of Thai cooking I would guess that they stir fry the garlic for 10-15 seconds then add the green beans for three to five minutes until they are cooked through. The higher the heat the better, you could also not stir as much to get a more blackened bean. The shallots would be fried separately, like this.   The sauce is likely something along the lines of 1-2 tbsp of the chili jam probably Nam Prik Pao, 1-3 tsp of tamarind paste, 1 oz palm sugar simple syrup. The amounts are a shot in the dark, you'll have to play around to figure out how you like it. Mix together then toss on the beans in the last minute of cooking. Sprinkle with the fried shallots to serve."

fitmeals,3d7027,mordiepants,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:09:50 2015 UTC,diced white/purple cabbage is quite good in a curry. it's crunchy and filling but not too noticeable
fitmeals,3d7027,tka11486,-1,Sun Jul 19 11:46:26 2015 UTC,"My family eats curry with rice all the time and I just sub in a sliced avocado. It adds that extra volume/depth to the curry...works really well with spicy chicken curry type dishes.   Or you could try a hack which supposedly cuts the calories in your rice by 50% - by using coconut oil and cooling for a long period, it converts the starch.

fitmeals,3d7ytk,Nano_Slug,7,Tue Jul 14 05:36:18 2015 UTC,"First of all, know that your tastes will change if you make a habit of eating vegetables regularly. You may need to force yourself at first, but one day you'll find yourself craving a big salad, and then you're golden.   There's a lot of variety to be had in the veggie department. Don't be afraid to try things you've never thought to try before, and don't be discouraged if you don't like it at first. Try eating a new veggie a few times, prepared a few different ways. If you really can't stomach it, try it again in a few months. Good crowd-pleasing vegetables include sugar snap peas (raw or cooked), cucumbers (raw, plain), romaine lettuce (scoop dips with it or add some dressing), and bell peppers (plain or with dip).   No matter what veggies you eat, it might help if you start by eating them some other way than plain. Hummus or yogurt dips are a great option. If your macros allow for it, try sautéing your food up with some bacon or butter. Add herbs and spices. Almost anything is good oven-roasted with a little salt, pepper, garlic, and olive oil. And try different shit. Avocados, mushrooms, tomatoes? Those are love-or-hate foods. Don't let that scare you off--find out which camp you're in. I promise you, once you get the hang of it, veggies are not only the healthiest food group you can eat, but one of the goddamn tastiest."
fitmeals,3d7ytk,theflamingnips,1 point,Tue Jul 14 06:25:16 2015 UTC,"I forgot about cucumbers, I do like those somewhat. I eat those plain. Lettuce is good too with dressing."

fitmeals,3d7ytk,Thisguy419,2,Tue Jul 14 15:38:59 2015 UTC,"I am going to suggest spinach instead of lettuce.  Spinach is not as watery as lettuce, therefor I enjoy the taste better.  Adding peppers, onions and peas are also good with light dressing.  Another way to eat your carrots and broccoli is to steam them.  I prefer steamed broccoli over raw.  I also am going to suggest cauliflower.  I enjoy the texture of this over broccoli because the top part does not break apart so easily become grainy.  I think just buying small amounts of different vegetables to try them will be a good way to find some that you like and will be able to incorporate them into some meals."

Now I eat it all the time and actually like it.   Good luck."
fitmeals,3d7ytk,omgimsue,3,Wed Jul 15 02:37:17 2015 UTC,redneck salads   Haha first time I've ever heard that.
fitmeals,3d7ytk,MuffinPuff,2,Thu Jul 16 09:34:07 2015 UTC,"I think most younger people in the US have a learning curve to overcome for veggies, so you're definitely not alone :P I actually started piling fresh veggies onto my subway sandwiches when I was younger. Only 1 at a time though; lettuce and tomato as a base, then cucumbers for a month. Maybe add spinach the next month. Throw on some olives in 2 weeks. Try out the peppers and onions, and so on.  A quick way to jump into cooked veggies would be stir frys and chinese food in general. I didn't care for broccoli until beef & broccoli smothered in brown sauce graced my lips. Also, cold pasta salads. Finely chopped red onion, broccoli, kale, carrot and the like, with cheddar is really delicious with a side of grilled chicken. If you're trying salads, only start with the veg you do like, then add one new veggie per week. Maybe lettuce, tomato, cukes first, then adding spinach or arugula, then purple cabbage or even a slaw mix with cashews. Strong cheeses, like blue cheese and smoked cheese help A LOT, and you only need a little bit.  It's really about finding ways to work with the natural flavors of veggies. OH! Also try fresh herbs; cilantro is my <3, followed closely by fresh green onion/scallions.  How do you feel about peppers? Nothing beats sauteed peppers and onions on a sausage sandwich (however, this is /not/ healthy... just delicious).  Edit: Forgot about zucchinis. If you try zucchini, make sure you start with small zucchinis, since the larger/older ones can get bitter. And don't even attempt eggplant until you've mastered other veggies first. I've been trying to like eggplant for 10 years now, and I still haven't been able to make it work. I do love most other veggies though, except endives. Endives are fucking devil spawn.  If you wanna try brussel sprouts, I recommend cutting them in half first, blanching them for a few minutes, then sauteing them in bacon drippings. Omfg, so good."
fitmeals,3d7ytk,matttrick,2,Wed Jul 15 13:59:25 2015 UTC,I find that people who hate vegetables often have sodium/sugar/carb based diets. Start pounding water. Never add salt to your food other than a pinch during cooking. Remove processed food. Try vegetables in a month and see how you feel. They really mostly taste fantastic.
fitmeals,3d7ytk,matttrick,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:57:12 2015 UTC,"Yep that's definitely me. I eat frozen food for literally like 90% of my meals, and the other shit I eat is like Ramen and other foods loaded with salt. Plus I add a lot of salt to my food too.

fitmeals,3d7ytk,HorchataBorracha,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:23:51 2015 UTC,"As a fellow salt lover who never really liked veggies, one trick that got me introduced to vegetables was to make hamburger helper, then toward the end, stir in vegetables.  But what kind?  What shape? For that, I hit up my grocery store freezer section.  There's bags and bags of frozen vegetables! They are all cut to size, washed, ready to eat basically.   So my hamburger helper gets equally weighted with a mix of corn, edamame (that's soy beans), peas/carrots, mushrooms, and spinach.  I like my salt, and this is where the hamburger helper shines.  It's loaded with salt.  So naturally the salty liquid helps salt the vegetables and make the entire dish hearty and palatable.  In my teenage years I also had a junk food diet.  Frozen burgers, hot pockets, pizza rolls, Mt Dew, Doritos, cans of Chef Boyardee, chicken patties on white bread, etc.  I was about 130 pounds.  When I moved out in my late teens I started cooking and eating ""real"" food and my body changed drastically, for the better.  Stronger, more energy, weighed closer to what my ideal weight should have been, etc.  These days I feel like I'm dying if I don't get enough ""clean"" food that includes vegetables.  Like, if I go to KFC and eat chicken strips and mac and cheese, I feel like I want to sleep for two days.  But if I eat a stir-fry and a side salad, I'm good to go. I believe a plant-based diet is superior to anything else, but I'll probably never get there.  Meat and junkfood are too addicting."
fitmeals,3d7ytk,callmeslade,2,Mon Jul 20 19:20:54 2015 UTC,"roasting, straight up you can throw broccoli, sweet potatoes, cauliflower, carrots, pretty much anything that's a little fibrous and not too watery. I cut up whatever I have on hand and throw it in a bowl with a little olive oil, some lemon juice and garlic. Then you can lay it out on a baking sheet and pop it into a 400 degree oven, in like 10-20 min they're amazing. I think steaming vegetable like broccoli, green beans, edamame, snap peas or whatever and putting a little sauce or a bit of lemon juice can be great. I make a low cal/carb avocado based pesto that is great on veggies and chicken. squash is great if you sautee it up with garlic and chili flakes, cucumber can be used in place of chips for dip or to bulk up a boring salad. I love cucumber salad, with rice wine vinegar, toasted sesame seeds and a teeny bit of stevia/sugar/honey. It's delicious and super refreshing as a side dish, especially with classically asian flavors."

Just try every new veg under the sun in different cooking methods. Roast. Steam. Grill. Blend. Broil. Braise. Cook it with different flavors (mustard braised Brussels sprouts? Amazing). You'll go through a bunch of ""no's"" before finding some ""yes'"" but once you figure out that you like fire roasted bell peppers, roasted cauliflower, boiled peas, and braised Brussel sprouts - you won't think of yourself hating vegs in general - just that you don't like arugula, kohlrabi, and celery.

Carbs can be calorie dense and sometimes I will cut them while cutting to make sure my protein and fat intake stay higher, but carbs are a GREAT source of energy.   I may be a little off on this so I would always urge you to look up better info than what a stranger on the internet gives you.... But it is easily broken down into glycogen which is stored for energy. Assuming that you are exercising along with watching what you eat that energy is important to aiding recovery on top of being used during the actual exercise.   Each macro has a purpose. Each person should adjust their diet based on their level of activity and overall goals in the end."

Half milk half water  Put enough oats to form about 50g carbs, enough egg whites + protein to get about 40g (or change to what suits you). Have this shake a few times a day. Switch it up with some banana whey and caramel ice cream topping or whatever else you can come up with.

fitmeals,3d40dq,tones81,2,Mon Jul 13 11:02:13 2015 UTC,"I love the idea of connecting gym to gym-fuel.    It means that you fuel your workouts without boosting your calories on non-workout days.    I like carbs before a workout and protein+fats for after the workout.   You can eat them all before or you can save the protein+fats for after.  Experiment with this.  Definitely eat the carbs before.  If your workout is light, a piece of fruit and a hard-boiled egg are just about perfect.    The fruit is a complex-carb providing some energy that will help you perform, so eat it before the workout.    The egg is half-protein half-fat that will help you recover from your workout and provide some longer-lasting energy to take you to your next meal.    If your workout is heavier, add to this.  A second fruit before, and some string cheese or an ounce of nuts as the protein+fats.    If you're trying to lose weight, I suggest eating about half of your exercise calories and leave the other half for some additional weight loss."

fitmeals,3d0vx5,Garfoid,2,Sun Jul 12 16:39:29 2015 UTC,"But due to agriculture in the USA being heavily government subsidised, at least with beef, you're basically paying twice aren't you? Once through tax and the once at the super market. Although it may appear cheaper in a roundabout sort of way we're all probably paying about the same.   Sometimes bookers has a deal on at about £12 a Kilo of Sirloin or something, but the trouble is they only sell it in 7 - 8kg cuts so you're still paying £84 in one hit! Buggers they are"

fitmeals,3d01qe,8edroomEyes,2,Sun Jul 12 16:07:09 2015 UTC,"Definitely don't skip dinner. But, here's an alternative that's a bit healthier and super sweet tooth satisfying. It's my go to when I really just need something sweet.   1/2 cup coconut oil melted 1/2 cup cocoa powder 1/2 cup almond or peanut butter 1/4 cup raw honey or maple syrup 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract  You just mix it all together. You can use a blender if you want or just stir it until smooth. This recipe should make about 10 treats. Line a muffin tin, parchment cups work best. Then you pour the mixture in to fill the liner about 1/2 inch full. Then you freeze them for 10 minutes or refrigerate for 30 minutes.  You'll have to keep them in an airtight container in the fridge. They melt when you leave them out.   Treats for 10 nights. :)"
fitmeals,3d01qe,defeatedbycables,2,Sun Jul 12 17:48:49 2015 UTC,"If you're really craving something sweet, go to the store and buy a few bars of extra dark chocolate (80% and above, the higher the better). Keep them in the freezer for storage and when you crave something sweet, melt 1-2 squares in the microwave. You can dip fruit (bananas and strawberries are the best to me), crackers, etc. It's super easy and not too terribly high in sugar - just the natural sugars from the fruit and the few grams of sugar in the chocolate, but the darker you like it, the less sugar there is. The Lindt 85% dark bar only has 5g of sugar for 4 squares. If you could stand it (which most people can't - I've never tried it but I have a feeling it would be way too bitter for me), their 99% dark bar only has 1g of sugar for 4 squares.   All in all, the chocolate alone will run you about 100 calories and 2.5g of sugar if you melt 2 squares, and then just add the calories/sugar from whatever you choose to dip. It's not too terrible as long as you save the calories and go easy on the sugar that day otherwise.  Alternatively, I like to go with some vanilla Greek yogurt, just a few pieces of plain dark chocolate, a piece of fruit, or some dry sweet cereal (my favorite is Honey Graham O's). Try to keep the cereal to a minimum though. Just be careful not to go overboard on the sugar. I use MFP to track how many grams of sugar I eat a day and adjust accordingly.   General advice: MFP is a godsend. It will help you track your calories, your nutrients, and your macros, which are all important in weight loss. Try to avoid processed or pre-packaged foods - fill your body with natural foods as much as possible. Lots of vegetables (roasted vegetables are fantastic), fruits (keep an eye on sugar, again), nuts (these can be tricky since they're very calorie dense, but still a good snack choice), chicken/fish more than red meat, whole grains, etc. Focus more on protein, good fats, cut down on carbs. Your eating habits are whatever make you comfortable. I tend to eat very little throughout the day, but I eat large dinners and snack a lot at night, though not too close to bed. That's just what works for me because I tend to be hungrier at night. What matters most is tracking your calories, nutrients (sugar intake, carb intake, etc.), and macros, but if nothing else just keep an eye on your calories and the weight will come off.  EDIT: I also want to add, there are healthy recipes for almost ANY food you like. You shouldn't have to cut very much out of your diet. For example, I love sesame chicken, but the sesame chicken from restaurants is usually packed with sodium, sugar, oil, etc. So I found a recipe online that's pretty low calorie and full of better ingredients ingredients (chicken breast, olive oil, etc.). Instead of buying frozen breakfast burritos full of junk, you can make your own! My point being that there isn't a lot you have to give up when you're trying to be healthy. You just have to adjust recipes and try new ways of making things."
fitmeals,3d01qe,simple_mech,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:58:47 2015 UTC,"I second the dark chocolate option. I often do dark unsweetened chocolate + PB or Greek yogurt + PB and a flaked square of dark chocolate to top it off if I need to up my protein late at night. Satisfying. Alternatively, once you get used to less sweet snacks you could try Greek yogurt + cocoa powder + chopped strawberries (mix thoroughly)"

fitmeals,3csmq9,hoverage,0,Fri Jul 10 18:04:08 2015 UTC,"http://www.pcrm.org/health/health-topics/bacon-cancer-link  Not terrible... Unless you want to increase your risk of diabetes, heart disease and cancer. According to studies, no amount of bacon is good to eat. It's simply not part of any balanced diet.  It seems to hurt for you to know this (judging that my original post is now at -10 points), but it's true. Please don't eat bacon if you want to keep yourself healthy and fit.   Bacon is high in fat, cholesterol, and sodium. It can increase your risk of diabetes, heart disease, and various types of cancer.  According to the American Institute for Cancer Research, just 1.7 ounces of processed meats consumed daily—less than two strips of bacon—can increase a person’s risk for colorectal cancer by 21 percent. No amount of processed meat is considered safe for consumption. Every year, about 143,000 Americans are diagnosed with colorectal cancer and approximately 53,000 die of it.  Studies also show a strong link between other types of cancer and processed meats.   Especially the part about ""less than two strips"". This recipe has six."

I'm not going to say that sounds horrible, it might actually be decent on salmon, but whatever it is, it's definitely nothing like Hollandaise. About the only thing in common it has with Hollandaise is that it's kinda yellow.   I googled ""greek yogurt hollandaise"" and this recipie looks more promising    1 Cup Greek Yogurt 2 tsp Lemon Juice 3 egg yolks 1/2 tsp salt 1/2 tsp disjon mustard 1 pinch fresh ground pepper (comment suggests lemon pepper).     Beat yogurt, egg and lemon juice well together and heat over pan while stirring, it will thin out, then thicken up again. Add other ingredients.   This recipie basically substitutes the butter for greek yogurt, but it would retain, I think, the same basic lemon-creamy-egg flavor of Hollandaise. The reviews are very good."

fitmeals,3cnmob,ibrokedown,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:42:50 2015 UTC,"Sweet potatoe soup is awesome. Sweat an onion, a 3 coves of garlic or so, and a tablespoon of grated ginger. Cube 2lb of sweet potatoes. Add 1 liter (4 cups) of chicken stock and a bit of salt and pepper. Boil until fork tender. Get your immersion blender and puree your sweet potatoe. Add coconu milk until you get your desired consitency (if I had to guess half or three quarters of a cup). Spice it up with a Tbsp of curry powder, a bit of cayenne, coriander. Add a splach of lime juice for some acidity and depth of flavor, adjust your seasoning and garnih with chopped cilantro if that is your cup of tea. Chopped crispy bacon and toasted baguette or chiabatta goes extremely well with the soup."

Trying to post more often to share some of my recipes – looking forward to comments and feedback! first breakfast post and second breakfast post  Tonight for dinner, I made a simple chicken taco (soft taco I guess? Wrap? Idk call it what you will).  Anyway – pretty easy.  I cut up some pepper and onions, sauté in a frying pan for a few minutes on medium heat.  I had pre-grilled some chicken breast over the weekend, so I just cut that up and added it to the mixture about 5 minutes in.  I used a Mexican flavored seasoning to add some additional flavor.  I made enough for two, REALLY big wraps – barely could close it, but I was trying to avoid eating a third wrap.  It’s a fair amount of food, easily could be two meals but I wanted to make sure I ate all the protein.  I added just a sprinkle of cheese, just to get the melty-ness going, but it wasn’t much at all.  Macro’s included in the pictures – feedback welcome!"

Higher cal I go for complete cookies or clif builder bars. It would be cheapest to make your own, it is very simple and there are plenty non-baking options. Honey, organic peanut butter, and whey makes a great base for any bar, add in things you would like for flavor or nutrient value such as flax, wheat germs, choc chips, coconut, almond, etc. Spread on sheet pan and put in fridge for an hour or two, then cut to bars.

fitmeals,3chf12,useintoxicants,5,Tue Jul 7 22:55:06 2015 UTC,While this looks amazing... How does the crust hold up? I imagine it wouldn't taste like regular pizza right?  Sorry if it's a stupid question.. :)
fitmeals,3chf12,useintoxicants,15,Wed Jul 8 00:01:30 2015 UTC,"This is not a stupid question at all and I was very surprised at how great this turned out. Cooking the meaty/cheesy crust at such a high temperature allows it to crisp quite a bit. It's not bread so the texture is a little bit different, though not as different as I imagined. Also, bread and turkey are (in my book) about the same level of tasteless so it works remarkably well for a ""pizza"" crust. A great way to help me hit ~200g protein/day without going bonkers on fat and carbs.   edit: The crust holds up really well to being eaten one-handed pizza style. I pre-dried my tomato slices with a paper towel to help prevent sogginess. My mentality was, ""If I go into this expecting something less like pizza and more like chicken parmesan, I might be less disappointed"" and the truth is that it's somewhere between the two but way more successful (and pizza-y) than I thought it would be."

I would use fresh garlic for a better taste. If you want more flavor without buying a lot of spices you can buy a small thing of Italian seasoning to amp up the flavor of the sauce.   Heat the oil up in a sauce pan (low-med heat), add the garlic and spices. Once you can smell the spices (about 2 minutes) add the crushed tomatoes and tomato paste. Let cook for about 30 minutes. If you let it sit over night before you use it the flavor will be much better.  This sauce is super yummy with ground chicken and spaghettini squash and for homemade pizzas."

fitmeals,3chlt2,jasonw86,-1,Tue Jul 7 23:43:17 2015 UTC,"Hi again r/fitmeals!  My last breakfast post was pretty well received so I thought I’d share this week’s breakfast as well.  I didn’t have a lot of time this week due to the July 4th holiday and traveling, so this breakfast was pretty quickly thrown together.    Ingredients:  5 Egg whites  ¼ cup spinach (I buy the chopped frozen stuff – it’s just easy for when you’re in a rush)  Hatfield ham steak (I’ve found this brand in a few grocery stores – macros look good, and they’re usually on sale 2 for $6).    I love grilled ham steak, so it sat on the BBQ a bit just to add some flavor.  As for the eggs and spinach – I will first microwave the spinach to defrost and separate it into 4 solo cups (they’re not just for beer pong!).  Then, I add 5 egg whites (I buy the cartons of egg whites – 1 cup is about 5 egg whites) into the cup and lightly mix them all together.  This helps the spinach and eggs mix together well.  Then I pour them into a pan and scramble them together – or you can make an omelet – pretty straight forward.  Add some salt/pepper and this week, a little garlic powder, and they taste great.    One thing I also had for breakfast, but didn’t add in the title images, is Shakeology.  Shakeology is a shake (some use it as a meal replacement shake) sold by Beach Body (full disclosure – I’m a Beach Body coach ) however I didn’t want to seem like I was promoting the product on this subreddit.  I am happy to talk more about Shakeology and what I perceive as the benefits of it, feel free to comment or PM me directly.  If you are curious what this meal looks like with Shakeology, check the macros out here.    For those curious, each week I make 4 breakfasts for the week (I work from home on Friday’s and make a fresh breakfast then).  I am a HUGE fan of egg whites as they add great protein into my diet, which is my overall goal, so that makes a repeat in this week’s breakfast.  A few asked me last week how I keep the eggs good during the week – simple, let them cool off before you cover them and put them in the fridge.  After I make my breakfasts, I let them cool down entirely before covering – this keeps condensation from building up inside the container that turns the eggs rubbery when you warm them later (this is just a theory, but its been going strong for me for 18 months – might just be BRO-science though).  I'm 5'9, 160-165lbs and about 12-14% body fat according to the little hand-held device in the gym. Wanted to start sharing my meals with everyone to hopefully provide some good suggestions to folks in need, but also get some feedback!"

It's not free, but if you feel like you need help with planning out your day, it's completely worth it. You can customize how much of carbs/fats/protein you would like in your diet. And if you want help figuring out that ratio, [IIFYM](www.iifym.com/) can help you with their calculators.   IIFYM tends to be a bit more forgiving in terms of going out to eat, etc., but Eat This Much is great for day-to-day planning. You can even plan for a cheat day for 1 day/week eating out.   Know that this will not work out for you perfectly. You will have to knead and rejigger. But cook primarily at home with veggies at every meal, and you'll be well on your way.

This is a little something I wanted to try, as I'm always trying to come up with new and different healthy protein snacks. We also found a dark chocolate that used natural sweetener instead of sugar, AND sugar free rice krispies, called ""puffed rice"". So basically I had no excuse not to make them.  You'll need:   100g rice krispies 80g bar sugar free dark chocolate 1 tbsp peanut butter 1 1/2 tbsp coconut oil  milk or water as needed 4 scoops whey protei   Step 1  Melt down your dark chocolate in a large plastic bowl. I did this by holding the bowl over some boiling water.  Step 2  add in your protein, coconut oil and peanut butter, mix until it is all blended together. It will go kinds of grainy at this stage but don't worry..  Step 3  Now add in your milk or water, SLOWLY. this is just to make the mix sticky, you want it to be pretty thick and not runny, so the rice krispies can stick. Once you have the right consistency, add in the rice krispies and mix it all until they've all been coated. Then just press the whole mix into a pan lined with some baking paper, then leave to set over night and you're done!

And it's also about finding the balance between those needs and definite weight loss.  And, finally, once you're at your desired weight, you want to be able to maintain that new weight forever.    My advice is to think about that new desired weight and how you plan to eat forever -- and start your ""forever"" eating now.  Dieting is not about the perfect diet food.  Managing your weight forever is about eating right.  My guess is that your forever weight -- probably around 150-155 -- is somewhere between 1750-1900 calories a day.  Eat consistently under that -- and consistently over your minimums (1200 or 1500) -- and you'll reach your goal and be able to shift into your ""forever"" lifestyle without too much drama or trauma."

fitmeals,3c49od,amuricanbrit,3,Sun Jul 5 06:53:24 2015 UTC,"Calories don't need to be evenly spaced throughout the day for you to lose weight; 2000 calories spaced between 6 meals will cause you to lose the same amount of weight as 2000 calories in 1 meal, as far as I know.   It is largely your personal preference, I've always enjoyed large meals so I have 2 meals a day and fast for about 18 hours.  The important thing is that your daily calories are under your maintenance."
fitmeals,3c49od,Schwma,2,Sun Jul 5 20:29:52 2015 UTC,"You'll find it easier to manage if you spread out the meals.  I make a budget: Breakfast, Snack, Lunch, Snack Dinner, Snack.

Personally I do an intermittent fasting routine, where I eat my first meal around noon and then stop eating around 8-9 p.m.  As a result I tend to eat a big lunch, a couple small snacks in the afternoon, then a big dinner.  Personally I prefer larger meals, but some people do better by snacking in small amounts through the day or eating many small meals.  There is no ""wrong"" way - experiment and figure out what works best for you."
fitmeals,3c49od,Spacemilk,0,Mon Jul 6 18:10:39 2015 UTC,"I think even spaced helps your metabolism stay strong. It's like starting a fire and then letting it die out and then having to restart it again each time. If you eat smaller meals throughout the day you keep your metabolism more active and your blood sugar more level. You may find if you do IF, you spike your blood sugar after eating and may not feel well. You may also be so hungry that you eat things that aren't as healthy."

Then change the weight up or down by 10 pounds and calculate that result.  You'll see the BMR number change a little with your weight.  You don't need to update the calories you're eating, but your weight loss will slow down if you don't, and you'll eventually hit a plateau where that amount of calories is the exact amount you need to maintain your current weight.  Assuming you're not on some fasting diet, of course."

fitmeals,3c49od,BrutusStoleMyCar,1 point,Sun Jul 5 13:48:21 2015 UTC,"Yes that's correct, as long as 2400 is your TDEE.  From a purely thermodynamic perspective, you must follow the laws of the universe - as long as your energy expended (TDEE) is greater than your energy intake (TDEE-500 cals).  However, if you keep track of your macros (carbs/fat/protein) you may find it's much easier to maintain that caloric deficit if you are getting a good balance.  Look into IIFYM.  Also, you have to ensure you are getting 1900 calories a day.  If you are trying to estimate your intake, you may find that you won't lose weight.  People are notoriously bad at guessing portion sizes."
fitmeals,3c49od,Spacemilk,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:12:43 2015 UTC,Yep. Just keep your protein intake high to prevent muscle loss (if that's a priority).
fitmeals,3c49od,Gabe_b,0,Sat Jul 4 20:21:01 2015 UTC,"Yes, try not to go faster by doing less than that very often though, as eating too much of a deficit can cause your body to slow down your metabolism (starvation mode) and lower your maintenance number. Activity (exercise) can be used to force it back up, or a cheat day (no more than once a week) that allows you to have maybe 2100 calories may also stoke the fires a bit."
fitmeals,3c49od,Tweezle120,1 point,Sun Jul 5 17:27:29 2015 UTC,Not sure why you're downvoted. I am living proof that this happened. Basically eat lower than your TDEE but not lower than your BMR. I ruined my metabolism by eating less than my BMR and even less than 1200 to try to jump start my loss but instead I should have eaten more than 1200. So yes be careful not to go too low for a prolonged period of time. Something that works for some is calorie cycling (higher/lower) but never less than BMR. You have to exercise for it to really be effective or you end up having to eat too low to lose.
fitmeals,3c49od,gladiolas,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:35:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah, without excising you can eat too little and stall out the weight loss; I lost a bit initially then totally plateaued as my body adjusted. If you are excising routinely then eating lower is ""easier"" because the activity will keep your metabolism up.  I can agree that most of the equation is Calories In < Calories Out, but that second half can be adjusted quite a bit by your body; evolution brought us up with losing weight being bad after all; our bodies are programmed to try to hold on to it."
fitmeals,3c49od,Tweezle120,2,Mon Jul 6 21:25:36 2015 UTC,"How did you deal with it when you plateaued? I'm in the process of doing a metabolism reset by adding in some calories each day/week to try to get up to my maintenance and then I guess I will cut down to lose again. But I'm just in the early-ish stages of it. Did you have to do something like that? How did you deal with it? I'm nervous I'm going to just gain (supposedly you gain at first while resetting, then you lose it as you up your calories, up down up down etc.) because I've already gained 2lbs just going from 1100 calories to 1300!"

It was about time for my annual physical and they ended up finding TSH levels of 4.3 with lowish level of serum T3/T4 (forget which one) which isn't quite hypothyroidism, but does mean my thyroid and metabolism tend to be slower than ideal. They call it ""sub-clinical hypothyroidism"" but not all Doctors take that idea seriously. My PCP didn't, but since Since I was trying to conceive, and hypothyroidism can block fertility my fertility doctor prescribed the Levothyroxine to get me into an ideal metabolic range.

Many people have volunteered their time and have put together great informative posts there. It might take you a few minutes, but it'll be enlightening.  Without knowing your situation, or anything about your diet, it's hard to say what will work or what isn't working for you.  For most beginners, a life change is enough to lose weight. Eat more protein, good fats, fiber. Eat whole wheat instead of White wheat. Eat veggies and fruits. Don't drink sodas or sweetened tea. Eat less sweets like cakes and cookies. It's likely that these wholesome foods will fill you up more and give you less calories than the less healthy options. Don't eat out and if you do, google what you're eating (restaurants don't care about your health or weight). Pretty easy, right? And you haven't had to run a mile.   Start reading labels and measuring your food. How many calories is a glass of milk? Well, you'll have to measure the amount of milk that you're drinking. Maybe a glass of milk for you is only 100 calories, but maybe it's 350. It depends on how much you're pouring in. After two or three weeks, you'll be an expert and you'll be able to eyeball it better.  What are your goals? What's your weight? What's your fitness level? What does your diet look like?

Of course, if you only ate carbs, eventually you'd get pretty sick as you need fat and protein to live.  Some people may find low carb diets easier to maintain; if that's the case then it's a great way to go.  Others find a higher carb intake easier to maintain while loosing weight; again, if that is the case then it's a great way to go.  In strict terms of weight loss, all you need is a caloric deficit.  In terms of general health and well-being, the quality of the food providing the calories becomes incredibly important.  Obviously, it's far more complicated than this, but that's the gist of it."

fitmeals,3c1t9p,omeganemesis28,9,Fri Jul 3 23:46:25 2015 UTC,"Sounds to me like you might have the heat too high. Lower the heat, and either cut it thinner or cook longer."
fitmeals,3c1t9p,thebigslide,10,Sat Jul 4 00:37:17 2015 UTC,"I've trained many, many cooks and I agree this post has identified the issue.  But, OP, don't cut it thinner.  Cook whole quarters if possible.  The more you cut chicken, the more it's prone to drying out and going rubbery suddenly.  The more intact the piece of chicken, the more forgiving it is.  Blot the chicken dry before cooking.  Sear it in the cast iron pan on one side and then flip it and stick the whole works in the oven at 375F (bone in) or 400F (boneless) until cooked.  While learning the timing, use a thermometer and poke it with your finger to learn what cooked chicken feels like.  It stiffens up ""just so"" when it's done.  Take it out when it's just under done and let it sit in the cast iron pan on the stovetop (off), covered loosely, for half an hour without touching it.  The hotter outside will finish cooking the inside while it rests.  What's happening, OP, is the chicken is continuing to cook after you mean it to finish, and too much continuous heat on the outside layer of meat is making it porous enough to wick out all the moisture.  You can also reverse-sear chicken for yet better results, but the timing of the final sear is tricky and if you don't know what that means, you should research it independently before trying or you will end up eating/throwing out raw chicken."
fitmeals,3c1t9p,macdos,7,Sat Jul 4 16:17:09 2015 UTC,Do you cook your chicken solely in the pan?  My personal favorite way to cook chicken breasts is sear the two sides in a little oil and then toss the pan in the oven at 350 with a meat thermometer set to 160.  Always comes out super juicy and stays that way for days.
fitmeals,3c1t9p,fitwithmindy,6,Sat Jul 4 04:18:46 2015 UTC,Here are two ways I prepare chicken in bulk: 1. Poaching: you boil the water along with seasoning in the water. You throw in the chicken when the water boils. You let everything simmer for 15 min then you turn off the stove and let chicken cool in the hot water until everything is lukewarm. (You wait about 40 min) then you get the most flavorful and moist chicken.    Baking: the trick is to leave a layer of broth or alcohol at the bottom so the chicken doesn't get dry. You basically just bake the chicken with seasoning and a bit of liquid for 45 min at 375F.    I don't have issues with chicken going nasty for the next few days :-)
fitmeals,3c1t9p,cmdraardvark,4,Sat Jul 4 07:42:35 2015 UTC,"Huh, I never considered boiling. I may do that next time, thanks!"
fitmeals,3c1t9p,thebigslide,6,Sat Jul 4 07:45:20 2015 UTC,"Just to point out poaching isn't boiling, when you poach you want it on a medium to low heat such that the water is simmering (read as small bubbles in the pan but not too frequently)"
fitmeals,3c1t9p,cmdraardvark,1 point,Sat Jul 4 11:06:23 2015 UTC,That's actually covered braising.  Poaching should be lower temp than a simmer.
fitmeals,3c1t9p,thebigslide,1 point,Sat Jul 4 16:20:33 2015 UTC,Lower temperature you may need but braising requires the meat to be seared prior to the liquid being added.

fitmeals,3c1t9p,KlfJoat,4,Sat Jul 4 11:29:46 2015 UTC,"You're way overcooking it.    Get a thermometer. Cooking is primarily about heat control and it sounds like you got none. You can get a relatively cheap but good and fast digital at a restaurant supply store.  Check your chicken often until you learn what to look for. You want 160 degrees for chicken, measured in the thickest part of the meat. This means that the tip of the thermometer probe should probably go into the side  Pull it at 160° regardless of what the outside looks like. ""Pretty"" is, to me, a secondary characteristic to ""done"".    I find it a lot easier, though not as quick, to bake a whole mess of them in an oven at once. Get the broiler pan that likely came with your oven. Slap the prepared chicken on the pan. Put it in the oven. Then, turn the oven on to 350°. It cooks faster when you start from a cold oven. Sounds silly, but it works; try it for yourself. I start checking on the temp at 30 minutes, but your mileage may vary."

They have more connective tissue, which takes longer to break down meaning it can be tough if not cooked properly, but when it does it imparts lovely mouth feel, taste and texture - that kind of meaty fillingness that you get from stew. Breast meat, however, if cooked for a long time is apt to go dry even if stewed (unless it dissolves almost entirely). The bones add a lot of flavour to the stock it's cooked in. Also thighs tend to be cheaper (in the UK at least) because the meat doesn't look as pretty.   Here's an article on the nutritional differences."

I'd imagine something like sour cream or salsa would work just as well, given that you're essentially eating a burrito without a tortilla wrap at that point.  Lately when I've been doing chicken and rice I've been doing a little less chicken, and I'll fry up some vegetables (onions and peppers usually) to go with it. Then I fry an egg on top and leave the yolk runny. I have my rice and chicken pre-cooked, though, so I have no idea how much extra time this would add to your meals.

As you lose, gain or maintain weight depending on your goals, you'll see the effect of different amounts of calories. This can be tricky if you're new to weight lifting while cutting weight; newbies will gain muscles even when eating at a caloric deficit, which means you'll lose and gain weight at the same time which can muddle the results.

I love them too - it's just so much easier to meal-prep with something like this, critics be damned.  I make it healthier a couple ways:  I cut calories by using Kroger's Carbmaster milk (60 cal and 11g protein) and ""butter alternatives"" (Land o' Lakes light, 50cal per tbsp.).  I add more meat than the recipe calls for and use 93% lean ground turkey.  I only buy the flavors with ~100-120 cals per serving unprepared.  As a result, I usually get 2-3 servings per box, and typically they run me 400-600cals with a very good macro balance.  I also like doing Tuna Helper and using the 7 oz tuna cans from Costco to increase protein substantially.  Today I had Cheesy Tuna Helper for lunch using the substitutions I've listed thus far; 1 box made 2 servings and each serving was 590 cals (15.5g fat/55.5g carbs/57.5g protein buuuut 1900mg sodium yikes!).

fitmeals,3bt0c6,sh3zzz,7,Wed Jul 1 22:51:44 2015 UTC,"Another vote for Chocolate Covered Katie. I'm a baker too, so I feel your pain. :-) Sugar in baked goods can often be reduced by 1/3, maybe 1/2 in some recipes. To make up for it, swap white sugar for brown, it gives more depth of flavor. Up to half the butter/oil can be subbed with applesauce or another puree (i.e. pumpkin) - might make the final product slightly more cakey than the original. Flour swap possibilities are numerous, depending on your goals... whole grain, gluten free, paleo, on and on. Flax eggs work really well in most baked goods (if real eggs are a concern). Any specific questions?"

fitmeals,3bpia8,kriegers-clone,1 point,Wed Jul 1 13:38:10 2015 UTC,"Well I make scrambled eggs just about every morning for breakfast. It takes me about 10-15 minutes to make. I cook it in one pan and use one plate and fork plus a knife to cut cheese/breakfast meat, so the clean up isn't that bad. Especially because I usually just soak the pan and wash it when I get home.  Heat olive oil in pan on med-low heat. Slice up breakfast meat (pork roll, chicken or pork sausage, bacon will get cooked separate in the cast iron and takes a bit longer). While this is cooking I usually make my lunch for the day which usually consists of putting left overs into a tupperwear container.   After a few minutes of cooking the breakfast meat I add in a big handful of spinach and kale. I let that cook down until it's wilted. I then crack 2-3 eggs on top of it and scramble the eggs right in the pan, once the eggs are almost done I add in some cheese of whatever I decided to by (right now it's this great havarti herb cheese). Put it on a plate, cover in Cholula, and enjoy while reading a book. About 20 minutes for breakfast (which I know isn't that quick). But it fills me up until I eat lunch at 12 and helps give me those gains because there's probably about 30+ grams of protein and fat in there. It's delicious and filling. I change out the breakfast meat, cheese, and veggies to spice it up. Sometimes I'll do tomatos, salsa. Other times I'll add onions, brocolli, etc. The possibilities are endless!"

If so, I'd highly suggest this: www.baconmethod.com   Start the method, grab a few eggs out of the fridge, go shower or whatever it is you were going to do, stab holes in a potato or two. Put the potato(es) in the microwave for however long is appropriate. I do 11:30 for two medium-large potatoes.   When your bacon timer goes off, pull the pan out of the oven, take the bacon (but not the grease) out of the pan. Crack your eggs into the pan, plate your potato(es), cut them open and spoon Greek yogurt into them, take your (now fully-cooked) fried eggs out of the pan, sit down, shovel into your face.  This may be slightly more work than you're up for. If that's the case, just make a big bowl of oatmeal with chia seeds, almond butter, and berries. You can make a huge pot at the beginning of the week and just reheat it if you like."

fitmeals,3bln9d,EgoKiller_,8,Tue Jun 30 05:42:37 2015 UTC,"Try r/loseit or for weightloss and diet tips, also r/progresspics for motivation.  I recommend tracking your daily calorie, fat and cholesterol intake using myfitnesspal, a popular app/website. For me this is the first diet that really works because I have control of everything. If I want to eat a bacon and cheese burger - fine - but that's my full cholesterol intake and much of my calorie allowance for the day. This means green smoothies, salad, yogurt, veggies and lean meat for the rest of the day.  For filling and low fat, low cal meals check out r/1200isplenty and just make your own meal plan. another good sub is r/mealprepsunday for recipes you can prepare for the whole week in advance.  My personal routine is:   Home-blended smoothie for breakfast (weekly changing recipes) ~ 200 kcal Cantine lunch ~ 500 to 700 kcal Dinner prepared for the whole week on sunday (currently lentil curry) ~ 300 kcal Snacks: Miso soup, Apple, Nuts ~ 200 - 400 kcal   I'm staying under 1400 kcal.

Its one of the major reasons human could develop such large brains - once they mastered fire the nutrition from cooked foods provided way more nutrients than raw ones. It does not make sense to eat an egg raw when it is better to eat it cooked.      Salmonella is on the shell of the egg, it can be fresh or old.

fitmeals,3biicu,dondo09,1 point,Mon Jun 29 14:36:13 2015 UTC,"Is this the garden of life stuff?  If so, it is not bad at all. The flavor is decent (I had chocolate), but it is a bit gritty because it is hard to blend completely. If you can stomach or eat whey, it blends better and often tastes better. I used it as an additive in shakes/oatmeal/pancakes and stuff to get some added protein and flavor.  Not sure why you want to replace a whole meal, but I would say replace the meal you find the least necessary. It is expensive and not that calorically dense. So to get 600 or so calories, you will need 3 scoops or so. And you are going to be losing out on a lot of nutrients you get from actual foods, like fiber. My recommendation is to add it to a shake or to treat it as a snack."
fitmeals,3biicu,alowe13,0,Wed Jul 1 16:09:27 2015 UTC,"I've never tried it, but in my experience the ""meal replacement"" part of supplements is not a great concept. Despite the advertised product providing ""the nutrition of a well-balanced, healthy raw meal in one delicious serving,"" it shouldn't entirely replace one of your meals throughout the day.   The healthiest way to be fit is to simply eat the right foods in their natural, un-powdered states. I'm sure this would work fine as a supplement, and you'll poop out any excess protein, etc.   My suggestion would be grabbing a bunch of delicious fruit and some kale or other greens, toss them in a blender with some Superfood supplement and call that a meal replacement. Just drinking powder and some mixer liquid is not sufficient for your nutrition."

I usually assemble ingredients for 2 -4 different bars, spend an afternoon making them, and then after cutting them up I wrap them all up in saran wrap and put 2/3 in the freezer so they stay good and I can keep pulling them out. There's nutritional info for each bar, and many of them are really high protein with enough carbs and fat to keep you full without eating a lot."

fitmeals,3bh0ky,pinchpicnic,1 point,Mon Jun 29 14:20:52 2015 UTC,"Eggs on top of anything.  For me, the go-to cheap recipe is just to cook like a month's worth of rice, split it up into separate gallon-sized ziploc bags with about 6 servings each to a bag. Keep one in the fridge, the others in the freezer, and whenever you're hungry just throw some onions/mushrooms/peppers/vegetable-of-choice on the skillet, microwave the rice for a couple minutes, and fry an egg. So easy, and there's only one pan and a bowl to clean at the end of it. Use a non-stick pan and the whole operation is done, from cooking to eating to cleaning, in like 15-20 minutes.  Alternatively, for dinner lately I've been doing half an avocado with sauteed mushrooms and a fried egg, salt to taste. Probably really high in calories because of the avocado, but fuck if it doesn't taste amazing.  EDIT: I didn't read OP :'(  For a college student, if you can do a hotplate I'd say do the above. If you just have access to a minifridge and microwave, try steaming some veggies and putting some soy sauce on it. Put a tiny bit of water in a bowl, throw in some broccoli or green beans and microwave until desired softness is reached (usually just a couple minutes). You can use some hearty vegetables and make this really filling."

MFP says it clocks in at 195 calories and it's super filling.   2) toss noodles into pam'ed pan with 2 wedges of low fat laughing cow Swiss cheese and 1 tbs of low fat Italian shredded cheese. Stir until melted. Throw in a cup of microwaved stirfry veggies and add your favorite hot sauce to level of desired spiciness. I like franks. Calories: 172"

fitmeals,3b30ak,avocator,1 point,Thu Jun 25 19:18:11 2015 UTC,Recipe?
fitmeals,3b30ak,eltoro423,2,Thu Jun 25 21:17:47 2015 UTC,"Pretty easy.  Take 1/2 gallon of milk- whole or low fat, but I always use whole, and bring it up slowly to 185 (f) for 30 minutes.  Make sure you use an accurate thermometer.  Let it cool to 110f.  A scum will form- poke a tiny hole in it, and pour in about 2 tablespoons of old greek yogurt (for the cultures- make sure whatever you use adds no thickeners, so fage is pretty good) mixed in about 1 tbl of milk (to make it pourable) and do not stir.  Place it covered by a tea towel in your oven, next to the turned on light, overnight.  It should smell yogurtey by that time- if not, throw it out and try again.  Line a colander with about 2 layers of cheesecloth, and place it over a pot (to catch they whey).  Peel off the scum (which is incredibly satisfying) and dump the yogurt into the colander.  Let it drain for 12-24 hours in the fridge, also covered by the tea towel, occasionally emptying the bottom pot if there isn't a lot of room for liquid to accumulate.  Put into storage containers and enjoy.  If you want to keep it going, save a little yogurt to make a new batch whenever you finish this one."
fitmeals,3b30ak,DTru1222,1 point,Thu Jun 25 22:00:22 2015 UTC,"Just going to add to this:  You can absolutely do this with as much milk as you want. We generally do 1-2 gallon batches. We just increase the amount of starter (though it's pretty forgiving).   You want it to be over 185F for at least 30 minutes (it alters the proteins or something), but you don't HAVE to do this. It makes the yogurt turn out better but it's not essential.   If you want to skip the straining, you can add powdered milk to help it thicken up. I haven't done a ton of research into it, but I think a lot of the times when you see a much higher protein/sugar content in some brands vs. others, you're seeing the effect of added powdered milk."

fitmeals,3b2mgf,up_syndrome,4,Thu Jun 25 15:21:47 2015 UTC,"Mince meat recipes are stupidly high. I say stupidly because I'm on 1200 calories a day and one portion of keema (Indian curried mince) comes up to about 300 calories when I try to keep it low calorie!  If you cook it properly with oil (I use low fat butter) and you could easily make it about 500 calories a portion and increase the calories depending on what you eat it with. Obviously goes great with cheese, jacket potato, veg, anything really. It's so a versatile."

fitmeals,3b2mgf,Urban_Empress,3,Sat Jun 27 01:01:49 2015 UTC,"I thought about my jambalaya instantly - I've not made it for quite some time, before I started to think about eating more healthily. There's chicken and shrimp and sausage in there, and a bunch of rice. Clearly it has to be heavy in calories, right? I just added up the calories that go in to it - it's nearly 600 calories per portion (594 by the numbers I have) - not much higher than the 500 you were thinking of. Is that an interesting figure for you?  It makes 8 portions, and they fridge and freeze well, so it's a week of lunches, or a week of dinner if you have some salad with it."
fitmeals,3b2mgf,LambastingFrog,1 point,Thu Jun 25 15:45:19 2015 UTC,"That actually sounds really nice so I may have a look into jambalaya. I can actually eat quite a bit so might just eat multiple portions of food.  I've found a nice turkey bolognese recipe I might try and will also do the grilled chicken, beans and rice and see how that goes for a bit. Plus a lot of snacks too, I guess I'll do that in the meantime."
fitmeals,3b2mgf,LambastingFrog,9,Thu Jun 25 15:59:54 2015 UTC,"In that case ... recipe is as follows:  Allocate yourself 3 hours to do this the first time. I've got it down to 2.5, now I have a some practice, and have leraned how to cut things up faster. You're also going to need a large pot, to avoid overflow. I've split into 2 medium-sized pots before without it failing, and half batches by simply halfing everything works.  You're going to need most of a batch of a creole spice powder mix. Mix all of these together, and store in an airtight container in the dark, for up to 6 months.   2 ½ tablespoons smoked (hot) paprika 2 tablespoons sea salt 2 tablespoons garlic powder 1 tablespoon black pepper 1 tablespoon onion powder 1 tablespoon cayenne (red) pepper 1 tablespoon dried oregano leaves 1 tablespoon dried thyme leaves   I use about two-thirds of a batch per batch of jambalaya. More if I want it hotter. The spiciness doesn't build up on you, because with the exception of the red pepper, there's no chillis in there so any heat you don't like is washed away with water. I'd advise starting with half a batch in your jambalaya until you figure out whether you have more or less tolerance than me - just in case. It's easier to add spice than to take it away, after all.  For the jambalaya:   Creole Spice Powder. I use about three quarters of a batch of the spice powder for a jambalaya. ¼ cup olive oil 1 pound medium shrimp, peeled and de-veined. I get pre-cooked ones, because I'm lazy. 8 pieces of chicken (4 drumsticks, 4 thighs) 1½ pounds Andouille sausage, cut into bite-sized chunks. Over in England I use some other relatively dense preserved pork type sausage - smoked ideally. 2 cups chopped onion - I use red onion. 1 cup chopped celery 1 cup chopped green (bell) pepper 2 tablespoons of minced garlic. (Can you be bothered mincing garlic? Me neither. Chop a whole head of the stuff up. That'll be fine) 3 bay leaves ¼ teaspoon cayenne (red) pepper 1½ tablespoons chopped thyme leaves 2 cups chopped tomatoes (which is roughly 1 can. A little under a pound) 5 cups of water (2 UK pints. 2.5 American pints). 2 cups of rice (I like sushi rice for this. With the same instructions it retains a bit of bite, which I like) 1 cup chopped green onions ½ cups chopped flat-leaf parsley   Procedure  Chop everything.  Season shrimp with Creole seasoning. If you have raw shrimp, sauté them in the pot with a couple of tablespoons of oil until they're nearly cooked through, then remove and set them aside until later. If they were purchased cooked, simply season and set them aside at room temperature, covered. If you put them back in the fridge, they won't take on the spice.  Put the rest of the oil into the pot and get to a medium heat. Season the chicken pieces well and brown them on both sides, then remove and set aside until later.  Put sausage into the pan and brown that. If, like me, you have some gammon and some sausage then get the gammon nearly done first before you put the sausage in. When this is done, add in the onion, celery, bell pepper, garlic, bay leaves, the hint of red pepper and the thyme, and cook until the vegetables have wilted and reduced in volume to about a half to a third of their original volume. Add the tomatoes and the water, and the chicken pieces, some salt and pepper. Cover and simmer for 20 minutes. At this stage, we're cooking the chicken a little more, but more importantly, with the bones in the chicken we're also making chicken stock in situ.  Add rice to pot, stir well and return to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover pot, and cook for 15 minutes. Add shrimp, green onions and parsley to pot, mixing carefully, and continue to cook, covered, for another 10 minutes. Remove from heat and let sit 10 minutes. It will still look a little wet before this ""remove from heat"" step, and the rice will absorb the water during this period of just sitting and cooling, although with this mass of hot wet food it doesn't really cool much. Now dig through and find all the chicken pieces and scrape the chicken off the bone - it should just fall off. Stir the chicken meat back into the mix.  For reference, this is bsaed on Chef Emeril's jambalaya. The recipe was given to me by an ex who got it from a friend that went to school in New Orleans. It's a creole jambalaya, not a cajun one. You can tell because it has tomatoes, and a bunch of different spices, and is close to Spanish and French styles of cooking. The cajun stuff has no tomatos, lots more pepper, and my cajun friend won't even call this recipe jambalaya."

I was also eating 6 eggs, 6 days a week. My strength numbers shot up but I now look like the Michelin man. Now thinking about a cut. Let me know if you have any questions about it."
fitmeals,3b2mgf,The-GentIeman,2,Thu Jun 25 22:38:36 2015 UTC,"You could make a hearty chili. Ground beef or chicken, veggies, throw in some brown rice or barley for carbs. Top it with a dollop of plain greek yogurt and some avocado.  Also, lasagna or baked pasta. Cheese and ground beef add a lot of bulk.  Some type of chicken curry (with coconut milk), and eat it over white or brown rice.  Edit: I can provide recipes later if requested, but I pull most of them off of google anyway, so try that first :)  2nd Edit: Just thought of some more. Enchiladas (beef, chicken, bean & sweet potato, whatever). Again, plenty of cheese, and throw on some greek yogurt after it's cooked.  And look into casseroles in general. I find they are usually less work than most other things, as they just require throwing everything into a 9x13 glass dish and baking. And it will feed you 4-6 times. Just look for something with plenty of calories (meat, cheese, cream, good carbs like brown rice or quinoa)."

fitmeals,3ay4ac,Leobanimator,16,Wed Jun 24 12:59:02 2015 UTC,"You Will need:   5 scoops whey protein powder 360g porridge oats 250ml coconut milk or cream 200g peanut butter Raisins, or your choice of dried fruit or nuts would be great too!   Step 1  Pour your coconut milk into a food processor. You'll wan to use all of the creamy part that forms on top and then about half of the water underneath! if your coconut milk is just all milk then go for 250 ml of it. Then add in your peanut butter and protein too and whiz it for about 30 secs, until it's all blended together.  Step 2  Pour the mix into a large mixing bowl. At this point you can whatever extra ingredients you like, I went for some raisins, but I think nuts or other kinds of dried fruit would also be great!  Step 3  Add the oats into the mix, not all at once, try about 1/4 at a time. Make sure you are mixing them in thoroughly! It will be quite hard to mix after they are all in but that's OK, just be strong and keep going.  Step 4 Line a high sided baking tray with some greaseproof paper, coat with a little coconut oil and spoon in your mixture. Then just press it down until it is all flat, press down quite hard, this will mean that you will eventually get nice solid bars!  Step 5  Leave in the fridge overnight to solidify, then cut into your desired size and store in a Tupperware in the fridge so that they don't dry out! if cut into 14 slices, each slice will give about 15g pure protein :).

You'd probably be better off dialing out the coconut milk/cream for another liquid, but I can't see this technique working very well without so much saturated fat (solid at room temperature) unless you used a sugary binder (but then you're just changing the macronutrient and not reducing calories) or some kind of ""weird"" binder like gelatin or one of those modern cooking powder things you order from molecular gastronomy websites."

fitmeals,3auco3,therealyulie,12,Tue Jun 23 18:18:40 2015 UTC,I assure you they are.  I tried cooking them with the pan covered. I have a hard time cooking the whites all the way through before either the bottoms burn or the yolk becomes solid. Covering the pan allows steam to help cook the top side of the egg. That is what causes the yolks to look like that

As the whites start cooking, use your spatula to 'cut' around each yolk and spread the whites around. The whites stick to the yolk like a rubber casing, you have to penetrate the outside and then drag the whites of the yolk.   Then, push the uncooked whites around the pan so they contact the surface. You're basically scrambling the whites and slow-cooking the yolk.   The egg whites will be evenly cooked but not rubbery, and you can control the done-ness of the yolk by messing with the time and temperature.   Just make sure you use a good non-stick pan and some oil/fat! Otherwise most of your egg whites will stick with the pan and never make it to your plate."

fitmeals,3auco3,lawnpuppies,2,Wed Jun 24 02:21:31 2015 UTC,"This is over complicated and not really sunny-side up, neither is putting a lid on top and steaming it either. You don't need a non-stick pan, and I actually prefer to use a steel pan because it's going to conduct the heat better and more evenly. It really is about heat control. Set it low and don't be afraid to adjust the heat or to move the pan off and on if it's too hot and it will come out perfect every time. 10-15 minutes is a bit of an exaggeration though."
fitmeals,3auco3,Endur,1 point,Wed Jun 24 06:25:00 2015 UTC,"It's really not that complicated (and obviously it's not sunny side up). It takes like two seconds to stir the whites around.

fitmeals,3ava3t,kingwithoutakingdom,10,Tue Jun 23 20:17:59 2015 UTC,"Expanding on this, protein powder isn't a magical muscle building supplement. There is no difference between the protein you get from protein powder and the protein you get from chicken/eggs/yoghurt etc.  So no, if you are hitting your goals of protein intake each day from whole foods then you do not have to take protein powder too."
fitmeals,3ava3t,pythagean,5,Tue Jun 23 21:43:09 2015 UTC,"Short answer is no.   Here is the reason: Protein powders are derived from real foods. Whey and casein is processed from milk. Pea, Rice, hemp and other protein powders are also derived from whole foods. They simply filtered out most of the carbs and fat from the whole foods. Protein powders also have other added chemicals and binding ingredients. Whole foods are a lot healthier protein sources as compared to most protein powders.   Protein powders are not magic pills and they are used for meeting your macro goals. They are useful if you can't get enough protein from your food intake, but if you can. You should definitely save money and not take them.   If you need detailed video on protein and protein powders, you can check out my video here.  Hopefully this helps!"
fitmeals,3ava3t,fitwithmindy,2,Wed Jun 24 10:32:06 2015 UTC,"Do you hit every day?   Depending on my meals I fluctuate. Some days I hit my protein goals (also 1g per bodyweight) when I have say fish for lunch and chicken for dinner. But some days I fall short if I'm having pasta for dinner or a light lunch. I take protein powder on my days I know I will fall short. Also helps that I don't go to the gym until 5:30 so I have a good idea of where I'm at for the day.  So tl;dr I always keep some as a backup or really if I'm just craving a shake post workout. Also, when bulking it is something quick to have a work!"

It has a huge database of foods that you can add quickly and easily.  You can also scan barcodes to add foods, or you can create your own recipes and use those as meal input.  I have not and will not pay for the premium version of this app - the free version works just fine.  But quick question:  You seem like you are at a healthy weight for your height.  What are your goals?  If your goal is to appear more muscular and lean, you may be better off lifting weights and gaining some muscle before you begin to diet.  Being more muscular also makes it a lot easier to lose the fat.  There is a LOT of info on this over in the /r/Fitness FAQ & wiki.  If you feel you have a bit of a gut, or that your shoulders appear rounded, check that you have good posture because it may be as simple as changing the way you stand. /r/Posture is good for this."

fitmeals,3avj5v,Spacemilk,1 point,Tue Jun 23 21:58:30 2015 UTC,"Oh you use MFP, good!  Ok so what I do is I use their recipe creation function to set up meals I'm going to cook.  Then I play with and tweak the ingredients until it makes something that fits my macros.  For example: chicken noodle soup.  I'll play with the quantity and ratio of the chicken to the veggies to the noodles until I get it right.  Fat kinda comes in on its own - I know I can always sauté things in butter or add oil if I need more fat.  The other trick is to have a short list of go-to items when you are short on certain macros.  For example: cheese is great on days when I'm long in carbs but low on protein and fat.  Fruit and veggies are perfect for carbs and fiber.  Yogurt is good for protein and carbs.  And so on.  Pick stuff that has variable serving sizes so you can tailor it to your needs."

fitmeals,3atneq,fine_day_today,2,Tue Jun 23 13:25:22 2015 UTC,"If you are getting all of your nutrients, it doesn't matter where the protein comes. However, I'd look into the way your chickens are raised: they may be full of hormones and antibiotics which can potentially cause problems (I think). Think about it this way: if all your protein came from tuna, you'd be worried about mercury levels. Chicken: atb and growth hormones. Soy: oestrogen. So, it seems that even though the protein is just protein, what we put in the meat during growth/processing is potentially harmful. Therefore, I think it is better to vary the protein you eat. Don't forget about plant based and dairy!  That's just my opinion, I don't have any scientific proof for all of this but it makes sense to me."
fitmeals,3atneq,halffast,3,Wed Jun 24 12:16:19 2015 UTC,"Don't know if you live at home, but if so maybe they're miffed that you're eating all the chicken and instead blaming it on 'ruining your digestive system.'  At 500g you're going through over a pound of chicken a day which can add up ($) over time.  I also eat a ton of chicken for lunch/dinner and haven't noticed any ill effects.  I try to mix it up at least once or twice a week with tuna, turkey, hamburger meat or fish."

I mean, without the duck confit you're going to have people yelling at you, but when you take away the white beans, the actual vegetable element, you've really lost rights to the Cassoulet demesne, even if that was vaguely the area you started in when you got to cooking.  Surely lentille de Puy avec une saucisse végétarienne is sufficiently Francoid for a title. It would look impressive on a menu, and having a bag of delicious puy lentils at my disposal, I might just make it before the summer gets too hot to have the oven on, but this really does seem too far gone to call cassoulet and I'm usually so permissive about these things.

If you mix plain Greek yogurt with some berries and let it sit over night, you'll have a delicious breakfast with no added sugar. (I also like to add granola or nuts).   My go to breakfast is ""healthy"" muffins. Yea, I know they have a lot of carbs, but at least I'm eating something. I try to find recipes which swap in Greek yogurt, applesauce, almond milk, etc for some of the more fattening ingredients. I also whole whole wheat flour, oats, wheat bran, oat bran, etc instead of all purpose. Zucchini muffins are also a great option! You can sneak protein powder in too without tasting it.

Blog link: http://www.ambitiouskitchen.com/2013/08/7-healthy-muffin-recipes-under-200-calories/  For me, a muffin is enough. (I pack fruit to eat about two hours later).

fitmeals,3armvc,Money_Bags97,2,Tue Jun 23 16:23:19 2015 UTC,Try a breakfast skillet. Typically you top them with an egg or two but you can certainly omit that. Add steak or a breakfast sausage for protein. Red meat is great for breakfast and if its leaner you will get a proper dosage of fat which you want in the morning. Fat helps jump start the brain and is a very sustainable energy source for the body.  One of my go to's: 100g of Sweet Potato (can substitute other potatoes) a few brussels sprouts 1/2 a gala apple 2 chicken sausage links or 4oz of steak I like to throw 2 sunny side up eggs on if you wanna make it for yourself.  Cook the sausages separately. Everything else toss in some olive oil and roast for about 25 min at 450.

fitmeals,3anopd,toothbrushdance,17,Mon Jun 22 03:48:37 2015 UTC,"white rice comes from the same plant as brown rice, but its just the inside part of the rice. the brown rice has bran and germ layers left on the grain of rice, and thats where all the vitamins, minerals, and fiber is. Most white rice these days is fortified with at least some of the vitamins of brown rice, but you are still missing out the fiber."
fitmeals,3anopd,tka11486,3,Mon Jun 22 04:32:25 2015 UTC,"Yes and because the grain stays intact with the fiber, the carbs in the brown rice change to sugar in your body at a slower rate."

fitmeals,3anopd,mybusinessquestion,28,Mon Jun 22 03:40:49 2015 UTC,"No. I'm sorry, but this is categorically wrong: White rice's carbs come in the form of starches, which are complex carbs. Simple carbs are glucose, fructose, and sucrose.  Brown rice is less processed, as /u/notobvioustrees said, but this has nothing to do with simple vs. complex carbs. White rice has simply had the bran and germ removed, thus removing some (insoluble) fiber and a host of important nutrients, but the process doesn't magically refine the starches into simple carbs."

It has a mild, nutty flavor, and is chewier and more nutritious than white rice, but goes rancid more quickly because the bran and germ—which are removed to make white rice—contain fats that can spoil.  Any rice, including long-grain, short-grain, or glutinous rice, may be eaten as brown rice. Although widely believed to be superior nutritionally to white rice, the nutritive value of brown rice has recently been challenged due to concerns over arsenic levels.

Brown rice is more nutritious than white rice as it contains more fiber and vitamins. It also contains more arsenic. Sure, it may have a lower glycemic index, but if you eat any sort of protein with your carb, glycemic index is completely irrelevant. White rice is generally going to be enriched and likely contain MORE vitamins than brown after it's all said and done. So basically eat whatever the hell you want. I personally think white rice tastes better so I eat that. I guess if you're eating just plain white rice with nothing on an empty stomach, then sure, I guess brown rice is better."

fitmeals,3al8kj,MinorityShack,3,Sun Jun 21 15:27:06 2015 UTC,"I think a lot of the science about saturated fats being bad is still unclear.  Some studies have focused on changes in cholesterol levels, which isn't a very specific marker for risk of heart disease (i.e. not taking into account different types of LDL, effects on HDL, etc).  Also, lumping all saturated fats together (which is still being done in many contexts) isn't appropriate as the biological effects between different specific saturated fats seem to be different. I'm not sure if there is much data on coconut oil specifically showing benefits, though."

fitmeals,3aexpy,fitwithmindy,8,Fri Jun 19 16:00:16 2015 UTC,"It is almost summer and I really like ice cream in the summer. Most ice creams are high in fat and sugar. I find it hard to fit one pint of ice cream into my macros and calories on a daily basis. I also not a big fan of protein powders in my ice  ream. I finally came up with this simple 5 min ice cream recipe that tastes honestly like Ben&Jerry's chunky monkey.   You can also use the suggested modifications to make other flavored ice cream as well.   Total Calorie and Macro information for the chocolate ice cream (this makes a little over one pint ice cream):  294 calories, 51C, 3F, 20P   Recipe:  Ingredients:   200g frozen banana (you can use other frozen fruits if you don't want to use banana, for example, frozen strawberry for strawberry ice cream) 150g 0.8% to 4.3% fat cottage cheese (the higher the fat, the creamier the ice cream will be, the calorie here is for 2%) 1 tsbp coco powder (for vanilla: use vanilla extra or vanilla bean)  Liquid stevia or other sweeteners.  Optional    chopped up nuts mint sliced fruits    Equipment:  You will need a blender, but if you don't have one, you can use a food processor.   Instructions:   Pour the frozen banana and cottage cheese into a blender.  Make sure that you don't add any liquid and turn the blender on dessert setting or low setting. Use a stirrer or spoon to slowly stir the mixture while the blender is on low setting until the mixture is smooth. This takes about 1-3 min depends on the quality of your blender.  Once the mixture is smooth, you can put in 1 tbsp of coco powder and a few drops of stevia for chocolate ice cream or 1 tsp vanilla and a few drops of stevia for vanilla ice cream.  Turn the blender on medium low setting and use the stirrer to blend everything together. This takes about 1 min.  Taste the mixture to make sure it doesn't need more flavoring. If so, add in more and repeat step five. Once you are happy with the flavoring, pour the final product into a bowl and time to enjoy :-)     Optional step: You can put in some chopped nuts, sliced fruits or mint for extra flavoring or texture.    Hope you guys enjoy this recipe."

I spread some mayo on them because I love mayo and why the hell not? :) Approx macros: 470 kcal, 33g protein, 45g carbs and 17g fat.  Sometime after lunch I hit the gym. On the ride home I drink my gainer (not pictured). Approx macros: 345 kcal, 23g protein, 57g carbs, 2g fat.  Protein-shake  After getting home, showering and whatnot I throw some milk, blueberry flavored whey, frozen blueberries, peanut butter and ice in a blender and let it rip. I'm sure you can make this in almost any flavor. Approx macros: 372 kcal, 41g protein, 20g carbs, 14g fat.  Dinner  I bought a whole salmon and basically put salt, pepper, some cilantro and a whole bunch of lemons inside. Wrapped it in foil and put in the oven for about 40 mins @ 200C. Roasted fennel is just olive oil, salt and pepper. Approx macros: 398 kcal, 34g protein, 2g carbs, 28g fat. Total macros: 2081 kcal, 163g protein, 141g carbs and 95g fat    I didn't have macros set in stone but rather I wanted a high protein diet that didn't draw a huge amount of energy from carbs. The carbs that I do ingest are ingested before and after working out."
fitmeals,3ac3be,sje118,19,Thu Jun 18 22:02:16 2015 UTC,I like what I see except the mayo. I would switch in some ripe avocado in place of that. Still get the creaminess and a lot more healthy. Otherwise it all looks delicious.
fitmeals,3ac3be,illymays,1 point,Thu Jun 18 22:27:53 2015 UTC,"Great post. Quick question though: what's your reference or standard method of counting calories for salmon? I have trouble accurately tracking the calories for salmon, because I've found a bunch of inconsistencies online regarding the amount of calories per ounce. I've seen anywhere from 40-60 calories per ounce. For example, one site says 160 calories for 4 ounces while another says 200 calories for 4 ounces. Just wondering if you could shed some light on this. Thanks"
fitmeals,3ac3be,cannabibun,2,Fri Jun 19 02:48:56 2015 UTC,"/u/simple_mech provided a good answer and I can't really say I have much to add, I bought packaged fresh salmon and simply went with the nutritional values printed on it."
fitmeals,3ac3be,cannabibun,2,Fri Jun 19 12:17:24 2015 UTC,"Looks yummy, the only problems i see are: a) too much fat, keep it around ~60g for optimal results and try to avoid the bad fats (mayo)      b) if you're just starting the diet, you need place to further reduce carbohydrates to lose fat, so reduce your fats, bump up your carbs, and every time your weight loss slows just remove some of the carbs      I'm currently on around 2k calories cut too, and I cut out the carbs completely, doing keto. 10% bf now and still dropping steadily."
fitmeals,3ac3be,cannabibun,1 point,Fri Jun 19 14:14:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah, if you cut out all the carbs, you have much place to add fats when you're at 2000 calories. But you should keep your fats low until you completely cut out the carbs (I get less than 20g daily, most of which is fiber so it doesn't count towards total carb count)."
fitmeals,3ac3be,simple_mech,1 point,Fri Jun 19 14:50:44 2015 UTC,"Great input, thanks! Did you do keto from the start or have you progressively dropped carbs? Like how big should each step of dropped carbs be?"
fitmeals,3ac3be,illymays,2,Fri Jun 19 14:57:15 2015 UTC,"I did it over the course of 2 weeks, but looking back now, I'd start keto straight away. I had terrible carb cravings when cutting them out gradually (maybe I did too big steps, but im not sure, went from 200/100/<20). Keto isn't for everyone though, I'm very carb sensitive and as I mentioned I get bad cravings on low-carb diets though (that's why the low-carb diets use carb refeeds), no such thing on keto. Plus all the fat-rich foods will leave you with very little food volume, so there's not much to work with if you like having many small meals - I use the Intermittent Fasting protocol where I fast for 20 hours and then eat all my intake in a 4 hour window (I guess other variations like 6/18, or 8/16 would work too).       And there's also the problem of virtually EVERYTHING having carbs in it these days, to keep watch over that I try to eat mostly whole foods. I'm basing my daily diet around ~0.5kg of meat and 100g of brazil nuts/almonds, then I just fill out the rest with different fat rich foods, still keeping close watch over their nutrition values (I like to use cheddar cheese, sausages, goat cheese, SOME veggies - peppers, broccoli, cauliflower, cucumbers)."
fitmeals,3ac3be,simple_mech,1 point,Fri Jun 19 15:10:51 2015 UTC,"My idea is to do this for 6-8 weeks, based on that and the responses I've gotten here I think the reasonable thing to do would be drop some fat in order to eat more carbs for the initial 2 weeks and then working my way down again. I'm sure I could do keto but not for 8 weeks :) I'll cross that bridge when I come to it.    I usually have no problem with cravings but I feel as intermittent fasting isn't my jam. My goto solution for cravings is usually a small serving of cottage cheese which, most of the time, is enough to suppress hunger until my next meal or bedtime."
fitmeals,3ac3be,illymays,1 point,Fri Jun 19 15:34:35 2015 UTC,It depends on the kind of salmon.
fitmeals,3ac3be,simple_mech,1 point,Fri Jun 19 16:17:52 2015 UTC,"Are you referring to the region in which it is caught or the type of cut i.e. filet versus steak? I recently bought about a pound of salmon from my local grocery store, and the one advertised/on sale in the fish market area didn't designate where it was from i.e. Alaskan. It just said it was a salmon filet."

fitmeals,3ac3be,robmox,1 point,Fri Jun 19 04:07:19 2015 UTC,"That's what I've been doing as well. It just sucks when some sites list 200-225 calories for only 4 ounces of salmon, which is pretty high for such a small amount of food."
fitmeals,3ac3be,timinator1000,3,Fri Jun 19 04:13:16 2015 UTC,"Why? 4oz should be about 25g of protein and let's say 10g of fat. That amounts to approximately 200 calories. It's because salmon has high fats, almost as high as red meats, but it's some of the best fats you can eat. It'll keep you more full though which is great. You have to stop thinking of ""full"" in terms of high volume. Foods high in fats will keep you full."

Yes this barbecue sauce is extremely sweet (possibly cloyingly so) and delicious.  However if you delve into its actual nutritional information you'll notice its quite high in in carbohydrates.  This is because it is a BBQ sauce where the main ingredient is high fructose corn syrup.  Look for a vinegar based BBQ sauce in stores that will often be cheaper, less sugar, and more delicious.  Just a little rant :)"

fitmeals,3ac3be,RandyRanch,1 point,Fri Jun 19 12:32:28 2015 UTC,"Why would you cut out fat? I agree that the mayo isn't exactly a great source of fat, but there's nothing wrong with having some occasionally. And the same goes for the peanut butter. PB is pretty good as far as fats go.  From the items in the pictures it looks like the op trying to go with a lower carbohydrate meal plan. Which means they will have to make up the calories with fat/protein."
fitmeals,3aa2az,Leobanimator,18,Thu Jun 18 12:38:14 2015 UTC,"Just something I wanted to try the other day! great way to get a lot of nutrients all at once!  What you'll need:   1 tin of chickpeas handful of diced coriander 1 large grated carrot 1 egg 150g grated broccoli 3 medium white mushrooms handful of oats or breadcrumbs   Step 1  Grate up your broccoli and carrot, place in a large mixing bowl together. don't grate up the broccoli too much, you don't want all the moisture escaping into the mix!  Step 2  Drain your tin of chickpeas and place into a food processor to blend, try not to get any of the moisture from the tin in there, it will be hard to make the burgers if they are too wet! Add the mushrooms too, then blend them until you get a paste-like mixture  Step 3  Take your chickpea paste and put it into the bowl with the broccoli and carrot, add your coriander and oats or breadcrumbs. Then crack an egg into the mix and stir up until all the ingredients are mixed in together. Step 4  Line a baking tray with a little bit of coconut oil ( or whichever oil you use!) then form your burgers. To do this I squeezed them quite tight, into balls, then placed them onto the baking tray and pressed them down into burger shape, easy.  Step 5  I cooked them on about 200c for about 20 -25 minutes, turning half way through. But keep an eye! they are done when the outside starts to brown.

fitmeals,3ad7v1,MrsRevShamwow,1 point,Fri Jun 19 14:13:32 2015 UTC,"Does anyone want to take a stab at healthy-ing up this Nutella-stuff choc chip cookie recipe?   I tried it a few days ago, but I think I made too many changes (swapped most of the butter for yogurt, used honey instead of sugar, lessened the amount of chocolate chips) and the recipe kind of bombed, it was way too liquid (of course).   What would you do to make this recipe healthier?"
fitmeals,3ad7v1,BuffBakerBabe,5,Fri Jun 19 13:21:36 2015 UTC,"Swap white flour for whole wheat or ground oat flour and some whey protein powder. 86 the honey and use granulated stevia or erythritol instead: the honey is what made your batter too runny. Replace the milk chocolate chips with additional dark chocolate chips or cocoa nibs. Use only half the jar of Nutella, and supplement with an equivalent amount of peanut butter, plus unsweetened cocoa powder. I'm on mobile but I will amend this comment in a moment with exact proportions to enhance your recipe.    Edit:      Alright, first things first: this recipe calls for browned butter, which is an amazing thing that's difficult to replace. I suggest that you cut the amount of butter in half, and instead use two tablespoons of hazelnut, almond, or walnut oil to compensate for what you're taking out.    Instead of using 2.25 cups of all-purpose flour, use 1 cup of ground oat, buckwheat, or spelt flour, 1/2 cup of white flour, 1/4 cup of unsweetened cocoa powder, and 1/4 cup of whey protein powder. If you have almond flour on hand, you can even reduce the amount of oat/spelt/buckwheat flour you're using to 3/4 cup and supplement it with 1/4 cup almond flour. If you don't have access to any of these specialty flours, you can make your own oat flour by grinding rolled oats in a food processor. Alternatively, use whole wheat flour for all of the substitutions. Note: these cookies may brown more quickly due to the addition of the protein powder. Watch them closely as they bake in the oven. You may need to bake them for 10 minutes at 350 degrees, then an additional 5 minutes at 250 degrees.   This recipe calls for 1.5 cups of white and brown sugar. Cut that down to 1/4 cup of brown sugar, 1/4 cup of white sugar, and replace the rest (about 1 cup) with granulated stevia, sucralose, or erythritol, plus 1 tablespoon of molasses (if you don't have molasses just add an additional tablespoon of brown sugar). If you do this, also increase the amount of baking soda to 2 teaspoons, and throw in 1 teaspoon of baking powder as well.    Don't mess with the eggs. One egg plus a yolk isn't anything to fret about.   The Greek yogurt is throwing me for a loop. I'm torn between telling you to double the amount or omit it entirely. I think that you should just get rid of the yogurt because it will reduce the amount of liquid in your batter and make the end product more ""cookie-like.""    Nutella is one of the most unhealthy substances you can put in your body. Instead of using a whole jar, which is equivalent to 13 ounces or a little more than a cup and a half, use 1/2 cup of Nutella, 1/2 cup of creamy peanut butter, 1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder, and increase the amount of vanilla extract to 2 teaspoons.   The whole recipe calls for 1.75 cups of assorted chocolate chips. Get rid of the milk and semi-sweet chips, and use 1 cup of dark chocolate chips instead. Even better, if you can find sugar-free chocolate chips (I use Lily's baking chips), you can increase the amount of chips in the recipe to 2 whole cups.   Anything else that I haven't mentioned doesn't need to be changed. Just watch the cookies very carefully as you're baking them. If you go ahead and try these edits for yourself, please update with your results! The new cookies will be higher in protein, lower in carbs, and lower in calories. Hopefully this helps.     Double Edit: I'm going to reformat the recipe for you.     3/4 cup all-purpose flour 3/4 ground oat flour 1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder 1/2 cup whey protein powder (chocolate flavored is best) 1 stick (1/2 cup) butter, browned 2 tbsp hazelnut, almond, or walnut oil 1 large egg plus 1 egg yolk 1/2 cup Nutella 1/2 cup creamy peanut butter 1/4 cup dark brown sugar 1/4 cup granulated sugar 1 cup granulated stevia, erythritol, or sucralose 2 teaspoons baking soda 1 tsp baking powder 1 tbsp molasses 2 teaspoons vanilla extract 1 cup dark chocolate chips or 2 cups sugar-free chocolate chips Coarse sea salt   Following the original recipe's procedure, but watch very closely as the cookies bake. You may remove the cookies from the oven even if they appear to be underdone, as they will continue to cook and set up as they cool."

fitmeals,3ad1lq,aninoacid,1 point,Fri Jun 19 04:04:21 2015 UTC,"It did. It was little finicky because the avocado will brown with time, so don't have any leftovers, but that can be combatted with lemon and/or lime juice. Otherwise it was fine. If the goal is to eat healthier, then get used it being this way. Otherwise if you need to ween him off the 'real' thing you can start by using a low fat mayo and yogurt mixture of increasing ratios yogurt to mayo over time."

Cut the spaghetti squash in half lengthwise and place cut side down in a baking pan.  Fill bottom of the pan with water, this will help steam the squash faster. I pour water until 1/2"" of the squash is submerged.  Bake for 40-50 minutes depending on the size of squash. Squash is done when it easily flakes apart with a fork.  Remove from water bath, scrape cooked squash out of outer shell and set aside. In a bowl, whisk together soy sauce, fish sauce, rice vinegar, sugar, pepper, ground ginger, and red pepper flakes. Set aside. Heat oil in a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Cook shredded carrot, water chestnuts, and garlic about 3 minutes. Add napa cabbage, scallions, cooked spaghetti squash ""noodles"", and sauce mixture. Cook another 2-3 minutes until cabbage is wilted and all ingredients are thoroughly combined.  Garnish with more chopped scallions and serve immediately."

fitmeals,3aatyr,Flampt,2,Thu Jun 18 16:29:39 2015 UTC,"The lettuce and arugula might be a nice variation to salads. Try changing up your salad if you're getting bored with them. My newest flair has been rice vinegar, sesame oil, and a splash of teriyaki sauce with some sesame seeds, along with whatever else was going in there anyway.  Radishes are going to be pretty good with hummus, or guac as  snack.  Kale is always a nice bonus to smoothies, if that's your thing, or try out some kale chips for another solid snacking option.  That cabbage is clutch for a lot of Asian cuisine, like gyoza or other cabbage/meat filled treats. You can also just use one of those cabbage leaves in lieu of a tortilla, and make some grilled chicken wraps."
fitmeals,3aatyr,blottomotto,2,Thu Jun 18 17:14:01 2015 UTC,"You could do a napa cabbage coleslaw, use the red and green lettuce as wraps for chicken, tacos, etc. The kales and arugula could make some tasty salads especially with the radishes. And while not healthy in large quantitie, radish with butter and a touch of salt is divine and use you can use radish greens for a little side salad."
fitmeals,3aatyr,brown_paper_bag,2,Thu Jun 18 17:49:57 2015 UTC,"I like to make Palak Paneer when I have a ton of leafy greens, or work them into a stir fry.  Cooking them down is great because you don't have to shovel cup after cup of raw greens into your mouth.  If you're into smoothies you can put them in there too.  The early shares are always so boring but then later in the season it's tomatoes and squash and turnips!"
fitmeals,3aatyr,OneOnTheLeft,2,Thu Jun 18 18:05:38 2015 UTC,"Think salad as a main dish, instead of a side dish. You've got lots of greens, shred the radishes, add some other veggies you like, a protein, a cheese, a fruit and a nut. Pick a dressing that blends with it all and you've got a great dinner for a hot summer evening.  I just saw a recipe (maybe on slow cooking?) using napa cabbage leaves for cabbage rolls - basically steam the leaves until they're soft enough to bend, then wrap around a meat filling and bake in a tomato sauce.  Napa cabbage and both kales are also great for stir fries."

Fill a pot with water and boil the noodles according to the box instructions.  Heat a saucepan with the coconut oil in it on medium high.

fitmeals,3a4too,LordFlatFoot,4,Wed Jun 17 06:03:20 2015 UTC,It is actually beneficial if you can workout fasted. Because it helps the secretion of growth hormone and you really don't want to not eat for almost 12 hours after working out. Because post workout is more important for muscle building. (this is the perfect time for increase insulin sensitivity).   I would suggest you workout right before sunset and then eat 800 to 1000 calorie meal after your workout.   Then you eat again before sunrise (600 to 800) as a big breakfast for the whole day.   Hopefully this helps!

fitmeals,3a6l4e,mhm33,1 point,Sat Jun 20 12:58:05 2015 UTC,I'd have to get my SO to try it if anything. I don't drink coffee to begin with so the concept of adding butter to it just seems not worth it. Throwing some peanut butter into my oatmeal works the same for me.

fitmeals,3a1k7x,MartinFriis,15,Tue Jun 16 14:42:26 2015 UTC,"I don't really have a recipe for my spices mixes, but some that I like:   One is good for both ""Mexican"" and ""Asian"" foods (I apologize to use those labels): a lot of ground coriander seed, about half of that ground cumin seed, a little paprika, and as much of a hot pepper as you like (in the U.S., cayenne powder is most common as a hot spice, and paprika powder is made from not-hot bell peppers/capsicum and can different flavors such as smokey or sweet). I like to liberally sprinkle this in chicken breasts before cooking. I usually then chop the chicken and eat in salad or with flatbreads or in spring rolls.   There is a mix of spices from Morocco called ""Ras El Hanout"" that is a little like the above, with the addition of cinnamon and cloves. It is delicious for pilafs, lentils and stews as well. It is also really great sprinkled on popcorn! You can find plenty of recipes online for it, or in your shop.   Also, a fantastic mix which your shop probably carries is called Za'atar, a mix of savory green spices: thyme, oregano, etc and sesame. It is delicious sprinkled on toast or over rice and grains.   Oh! For sweet things, my new favorite spices are a mix of ground cardamom and what we call mace - mace is made from the ground husk of nutmeg, and tastes similar but not so strong and more lemony. It's very delicate and aromatic.   Bon appetit!"

fitmeals,3a1k7x,impossibly,1 point,Tue Jun 16 20:52:12 2015 UTC,"My advice is, go and get a cheap electric coffee grinder. They're around 10-15€. It's easily my most used tool in the kitchen and helps tremendously to make your own spice mixes. Go and buy spices in bulk preferably as seeds, especially indian stores sell spices pretty cheap compared do grocery stores. If you want to get serious about spices, this is the way to go. I prepare every mix individually before I start cooking. It takes me 2-3 minutes to make my spice mix for each dish and the flavour is much much better than anything you can get prepacked in powder form.  Fish doesn't need a lot of spices as it has a wonderful flavour itself. Fresh dill and pepper are the only thing I use. In some mediterranian countries it's heavily frowned upon to use something other than salt. The turks will call you barbaric if you even use lemon as it will overpower the fish taste.  With beef and chicken you can go wild if you like. Go and check out if they have a do-it-yourself garam masala set. There are little prepackaged packets with whole seeds, barks, cloves etc. in the right ratio. You just have to grind them yourself which is pretty easy with the electric coffee grinder. The flavour is crazy intense. With Garam Masala you have a great base to mix your own spice mixes like tandoori mix for chicken. Cumin seeds always go well with any sort of meat, especially beef. Coriander seeds always goes well with cumin, but be careful it turns your dish quite bitter if you use too much. Nutmeg and Fenugreek go great with potato dishes.   The only mix I make in bulk is my mix for fries:  Kosher Salt  red bellpepper powder  a little bit sugar  nutmeg  Cumin seeds  coriander seeds  fenugreek seeds"

fitmeals,3a1k7x,notaneggspert,1 point,Wed Jun 17 00:35:10 2015 UTC,"A middle eastern market will also have sumac - a very versatile, red citrusy lemony spice, but much less tart than actual citrus fruits.  It's one of the components of za'tar, really good, and quite cheap.  I'm surprised I never see it outside of middle eastern cooking.  Just sumac plus garlic and salt over roasted chicken and potatoes or rice is pretty awesome.  Either cover the chicken before cooking, or make a sauce with mayo or yogurt. Once you get a taste for it, you can add it most places you'd use citrus, and there's a ton of recipes online."

You can sauté the ham with mirepoix, garlic, and herbs to serve as the base for a soup, ideally split pea soup.     Alternatively, you can chop the meats and sauté them along with some oil, onions and garlic, then mix it with a buttload of scrambled eggs and a green veggie to make a frittata. Just let the cooked goods cool down before mixing them with the eggs, and bake your frittata in an oven-safe dish.      The great thing about frittatas is that you can portion it into single servings, freeze them, and have one for breakfast with some whole wheat toast."

Unless there's an actual healthy alternative (and there isn't, otherwise we wouldn't be having this discussion), don't compromise.

The buffalo was amazing in a wrap, I just added some avocado, lettuce, and cheese. But my all time favourite is probably the teriyaki, I add a LOT of garlic (like half a bulb) to it and it's amazing."
fitmeals,39xkaw,Griever114,3,Mon Jun 15 20:59:29 2015 UTC,"I work as a medic too, and one of my favorite things to make for work is chicken/salsa in a slow cooker.  I usually put 5-6 skinless/boneless thighs, a medium container of salsa, and a bunch of veggies(broccoli, carrots, onions) in the slow cooker on high for 4 hours.  Once time is done, shred the chicken with forks like pulled pork, and you have a meat and veggie dish that can go with just about anything.  I've done it with rice as a side dish, used it as a filling for tortilla wraps, mixed with eggs..."

fitmeals,39xkaw,ForteFZ,4,Mon Jun 15 20:15:39 2015 UTC,"This is sort of a general question, but how do you make sure the chicken tastes good after keeping them in the fridge?  If I keep the chicken in the fridge for close to even a day after I heat them up they end up tasting like shit.  It should be noted I don't do anything special with them. I season them up, put in the oven and put them onto my plate and into my tupperware for lunch the next day."
fitmeals,39xkaw,powowls,9,Mon Jun 15 19:27:01 2015 UTC,"Not sure why you're having that kind of problem, chicken usually reheats just fine, even up to a week later.  If you're cooking chicken for the purpose of reheating it later, consider intentionally under-cooking it a tiny bit. The act of reheating it will finish it off, if you do it correctly. That might help with flavor and texture."
fitmeals,39xkaw,ChuckFinleyFL,3,Mon Jun 15 19:38:53 2015 UTC,"Yup, undercook just a little (but not raw at all), and over season. These marinades were all really strong, that way if they lost a little flavour it didn't matter."

This might be a bit nitpicky, and it probably wont matter, but try letting your food cool before you close it up and put it in the fridge! if you cover it up too soon, moisture builds up and that can lead the food to go bad quicker.

I did 12 breasts.  Next day  Recipe 12 boneless skinless chicken breasts Dijon mustard (2tbl) Balsamic vinegar (¼ cup) Garlic (1tbl) Green onions chopped (lots) Then grilled. About 10min total half on high half of the time medium, but will depend on the size the chicken. Most left under cooked for better reheating  Sunday was venison burgers korean style.

Basic premise of this is to take the days you have time to make a meal, to make massive portions that are easy to reheat but also that are delicious to reheat.

fitmeals,39yvsa,toothbrushdance,2,Mon Jun 15 23:50:29 2015 UTC,"This has been my weekday breakfast for the last couple of months. I mix 2/3 Cup of rolled oats with milk and protein powder.

Would I be conceivably be able to make five at once and eat one each day over the course of five days as long as they stayed sealed and in the fridge? I'm starting a new job soon and would like to prep overnight oats for the entire work week if possible."
fitmeals,39yvsa,illymays,1 point,Fri Jun 19 04:13:56 2015 UTC,"I have actually thought about doing this, although I've never actually tried it.  Don't take my word for it, but I can't imagine that there would be any adverse effects to making a weeks worth at once. They will be in the fridge the whole time so the milk should be fine, as long as they are sealed I think it should be fine.   One quick note if you are putting pineapple in, always wait to do that in the morning. Otherwise the juices will curdle the milk overnight (learnt that one the hard way)"
fitmeals,39yvsa,pythagean,1 point,Fri Jun 19 06:13:17 2015 UTC,I've done 5 at once and it was fine. I don't add dairy though. (almond milk)
fitmeals,39yvsa,streatbeat,1 point,Mon Jun 22 19:20:11 2015 UTC,do you do equal parts milk/protein and oats? so like 2/3 cup of the protein milk combo?
fitmeals,39yvsa,toothbrushdance,2,Tue Jun 16 00:36:33 2015 UTC,"Depending on what else is in it, I find that 2/3 Cup of Rolled Oats will soak up around 1/2 Cup of Milk overnight.

fitmeals,39yvsa,pythagean,1 point,Tue Jun 16 00:43:47 2015 UTC,I like this idea a lot! It seems very convenient especially since I have a 7:00am class next Fall.

I typically save my protein mix for post workouts but I'll definitely experiment before I go back to school. Thanks a ton!

My local grocery store (HEB) has a 2% lactose free milk, which contains 12 grams of protein per serving.   Also, kefir is naturally ~99% lactose free. The cultures actually process the lactose for you, so it's great."
fitmeals,39yvsa,Blumpkin_Queen,1 point,Tue Jun 16 02:57:30 2015 UTC,I've had the brand Lactaid before and even that messed up my stomach pretty good so I feel like other brands will do the same. I switched to almond milk and that gives me 0 issues but issue is it's 1g of protein per serving. I just use it as a replacement for water in oatmeal sometimes or protein shakes since it basically has very little of each macronutrient per serving
fitmeals,39yvsa,Blumpkin_Queen,1 point,Tue Jun 16 05:03:06 2015 UTC,Maybe it's not lactose intolerance then - possibly an allergy ?

I mix in whatever I have on hand - chutney, salsa, hummus, hot sauce, little bit of cheese, leftovers (meats, roasted veggies etc), herbs, spring onions etc. I keep a few different cooked light breakfast meats (turkey bacon, maple turkey sausage, apple chicken sausage etc) in zip lock bags in the freezer too so I can pick and choose what I feel like. Ive even thrown a little canned tuna and sesame oil ontop of eggs and it was delicious.

I think the menu varies from location to location but what's awesome is that the menu gives calories, fat, protein, carbs and a few other things for every item and combination. And then it's printed on your receipt too, making it real easy to take home and enter. I typically get the roasted chicken plate when I'm cutting. Tastes amazing and it's 291 before sides. Throw in a couple low cal sides and it runs around 350 calories for the whole meal. I wish more restaurants would include nutrition info like modmarket."

fitmeals,39wknc,tonylowe,3,Mon Jun 15 14:14:12 2015 UTC,"This is going to sound dumb, but I used to love getting a request for chef's choice. It might (depending on the type of restaurant) be worth while to tell your server you are a vegetarian and interested in a low calorie meal and to have the chef surprise you. You're going to have to be very adventurous, but if you don't like something on the plate, you either have room for dessert or get to eat more of the rest (someone else mentioned restaurant portions are ridiculous... and they are)."
fitmeals,39wknc,geoghae,4,Mon Jun 15 14:51:27 2015 UTC,My chef would hate you if you tried this unless the restaurant was really dead.  Best thing you can do is ask you server what items on the menu are or can be made vegetarian.

fitmeals,39wknc,Nightrabbit,3,Mon Jun 15 17:05:48 2015 UTC,"I'm a vegetarian/vegan who has traveled Monday-Thursday almost every week for the past 5 years.  Your options will vary greatly based on where you're traveling and where your teammates want to go.  Unfortunately, vegetarian options at many restaurants are limited to pasta with cream sauce, salads, or side dishes, but it is possible to eat healthy while traveling.  Here are some tips from my experience:    Do not be reluctant to customize your order.  Read the whole menu to get an idea of what they might have available and tell them what you want.  Portabello mushrooms instead of chicken with your fajitas, more veggies than noodles in your pasta, etc.  Vegetarian protein options are very limited.  Consider bringing something from home (tofu, tempeh, veggie burgers) and store in the fridge at the office or in your hotel room.  Add to your restaurant meals as needed.  You can also bring protein powder or bars.  Find a good grocery store where you're going and pick up some groceries for the week.  Research restaurants beforehand to get an idea of places that will have good choices."
fitmeals,39wknc,LessCodeMoreLife,2,Mon Jun 15 18:13:34 2015 UTC,"As you said, vegetarian options are often really carb heavy and highly caloric, so when I go out for meals, I try to stay away from pasta, free bread, and anything fried and look for dishes built around veg friendly protein, like beans, eggs, mushrooms or lentils. If there aren't things like that, then I'll at least try to reduce carbs/calories by altering things like getting a lettuce or other wrap instead of a hamburger bun. Otherwise, you could also eat something filling, healthy and higher protein first and then get your veggies in with that salad. Hope that helps!"
fitmeals,39wknc,cubazueleno,2,Mon Jun 15 15:34:23 2015 UTC,"Second this. Also vegetarian dishes can be very cheese-heavy because that's the ""easy"" protein. Mediterranean places would be good bets because they always have chick peas/hummus/etc. Most grills now have veggie burgers.  And I second the ""breakfast all day"" option. Also depends on where you're going... if you're in a more metropolitan area, you'll have a lot more options than smaller towns with one Applebee's and a raft of pizza/hamburger spots."

This is partially due to the fact that most restaurants serve far more food than I need. It's also due to the fact that my schedule means that I tend to eat later (8pm-ish). To counteract this, I either try to eat a larger lunch (and save some for an afternoon snack and then that means a light dinner) or just make sure I have some sort of healthy snack available for late afternoon. I understand the need to be social, but I haven't been on a project in years where the whole team would go out together every night (M, T, and Wed). Typically, you should be able to get a night to yourself so take advantage of that if you can grab some stuff from the grocery and fit in an extra workout or go to be early.   Good luck on your new gig!"

fitmeals,39ybx0,LesBeHonest1,1 point,Mon Jun 15 23:20:10 2015 UTC,"Line a crockpot with onion slices, basically so the chicken doesn't touch the edges because it makes it easier for cleaning. You can skip this step if you don't have an onion. Add the chicken breasts and a bunch of good salsa. Cook on high for like 6+ hours or high for like 4 hours. Shred and let it sit in there for 15 minutes to soak all that good shit up.   Now you can use that chicken in numerous ways. Tacos or burritos work well. I've served it over rice and added green peas and sweet corn. The possibilities are endless!"
fitmeals,39ybx0,gingersams,1 point,Tue Jun 16 14:22:41 2015 UTC,"I'll add a jar of spicy salsa, a package of taco seasoning (My favorites are a habanero salsa and chipotle taco mix) then toss a package of chicken in there. When it's cooked shred it, and eat it with veggies, in a corn tortilla, over rice... whatever. It's so flavorful."

It would work with broccoli and brown rice but I usually do red peppers, onions, and white rice.

fitmeals,39t9k5,itsreaditpeople,5,Sun Jun 14 15:39:30 2015 UTC,"I modified this recipe over the last few months and figured I'd share what I came up with:    2 lbs cooked chicken (I put the frozen chicken in at 350 degrees for one hour) 2 cans of black beans, rinsed (~28 oz) 2 cans of kidney beans, rinsed (~28 oz) 2 cans diced tomatoes(~28 oz) 1 can tomato sauce (14 oz) 1 red bell pepper 1 medium yellow onion 6 cloves garlic 1/4 cup chili powder 1 TBS cumin dash of cayenne pepper 2 tsp salt   I take the tomatoes, bell pepper, onion, garlic, chili powder, cumin, salt, and cayenne pepper and blend it thoroughly.   Put the cooked chicken and the rest of the ingredients in a crock pot and cook on low for 8 hours.   Alternatively, put everything in a pot except for the cooked chicken, and bring to a boil over medium heat then let simmer for 15 minutes. When done, add chicken back in.

fitmeals,39k7j6,Gaminic,4,Fri Jun 12 11:30:25 2015 UTC,"Where are you from? Quark is distinctly different from Ricotta. EDIT: stupidly read the question.  You should be able to find Quark in places with a high Scandinavian, German and Slavic populations. If you have a hard time finding it there or there's no one near you that does it look for Paneer (Indian - high in carbs. Good protein) or fromage frais (French - Lower in carbs)."
fitmeals,39k7j6,fdoom,4,Fri Jun 12 20:14:07 2015 UTC,"Quark is kind of yoghurt-ish, but with a very neutral taste. Unlike yoghurt it contains close to no carbs/sugar and is nearly all protein. You can use it in many of the same ways. Depending on the recipe (sweet food, eg with oats and berries), low fat yoghurt may be an option.  For salty meals, cottage cheese can be a replacement."

I've used Pyrex in the past before and never stuck to them before and now I know why - the 3 compartments make a HUGE difference.   They help the food keep for longer especially when storing in the freezer and thawing because there's no cross contamination. Love em, it's like a healthy and guilt free TV dinner ;)"

I can dump everything together in the big tray after heating or remove something that should remain cold.  Can't do that in some of the other ones posted.    Additionally, they secure very well and I've had them upside down or sideways in the gym bag with no worries.  Kids have already lost one of the small trays though.. so.  Don't allow that to happen."
fitmeals,39hb78,LtChachee,2,Fri Jun 12 04:37:32 2015 UTC,When containers say microwave safe it means they won't melt. The question of whether heating plastic releases toxins into your food debatable but there is enough evidence that its probably worth migrating to pyrex.

I posted BBQ Karate a bit ago and got a lot of comments and questions both here and in Meal Prep Sunday so I decided to hold a FREE meal prep crash course for anyone interested in getting into the meal prep game.   It won't get into the weeds on nutrition but it will give you up on all the fundamental concepts, equipment, and workflow ideas you need to create a meal prep routine that meets your goals. And hey, the price is right..."
fitmeals,39jm66,SpeakEzay,3,Fri Jun 12 04:38:30 2015 UTC,I put some cling wrap on top and about a tablespoon of water per cup of rice and it comes back nice and fluffy.
fitmeals,39jm66,explosivelemons,2,Fri Jun 12 08:57:13 2015 UTC,"If you're going to be making a lot of rice, a fuzzy logic rice maker is a worthwhile investment. The keep warm function can keep rice good for one or two days."
fitmeals,39jm66,idamayer,1 point,Fri Jun 12 07:14:57 2015 UTC,The keep warm function can keep rice good for one or two days.   I know rice isn't necessarily known for bacteria proliferation the way meat is but...is this safe?  Does the owner's manual say anything about this?
fitmeals,39jm66,Spacemilk,0,Fri Jun 12 18:46:04 2015 UTC,The rice cooker will switch to Regular Keep Warm automatically 24 hours after cooking completion.   http://platinumricecooker.com/index_page.php It's certainly designed to keep rice for longer than one day. a 2 second google search will find you a multitude of anecdotes of people keeping rice for multiple days.
fitmeals,39jm66,idamayer,2,Fri Jun 12 20:05:35 2015 UTC,I had a similar problem and actually gave up (don't really like rice) then switched to quinoa with less dry issues.
fitmeals,39jm66,TheCrispyDud,2,Fri Jun 12 07:45:00 2015 UTC,I would just make a batch with more water than usual. Like 1/4-1/2 cup more of water and see if that helps. My dad used to do that because he would make large batches and store it in the fridge for later. I've done it before with brown rice and its comes out nicely for lunch the next day.
fitmeals,39jm66,sady_smash,1 point,Fri Jun 12 08:07:44 2015 UTC,"Ahhh I had this problem for so long.... But the key ingredient is to add olive oil to the rice before you add any water to the pan. Add enough to coat all the rice so they are nice and shiny, use a spoon to spread the wealth of the oil. I personally add juice of one fresh lime as well. Cook the rice and watch this rice not clump or get hard days after cooking :). Ps- add cilantro and salt once you've finished if you desire the white rice from chipotle. Happy eating."
fitmeals,39jm66,Rdwoods,1 point,Sat Jun 13 13:41:06 2015 UTC,"I make rice all the time. You should definitely get a rice cooker if you make it weekly. While the rice is still hot, wrap it in saran wrap to keep the moisture in. I like to use a scale under it so each bundle is around 100g. Let it cool for a few hours or overnight and then put it in the freezer. Microwave 2-3m in the saran wrap and it'll be ready to eat again."

fitmeals,39ji5g,brown_paper_bag,3,Fri Jun 12 16:40:56 2015 UTC,"I took a quick look because I love au gratin and just assumed it was never going to happen unless I was bulking. I found this alternative way of doing them that involves poaching the potatoes in milk and garlic but not using all that milk in the final product. Worth a try, possibly?"
fitmeals,39ji5g,iDareToDream,1 point,Fri Jun 12 17:23:50 2015 UTC,"So I am trying to add more fiber into my diet, because I have been struggling with getting good bowel movements. Right now I get about 10-12 grams of fiber a day through green smoothies and granola. I want to get to 20-25 grams of fiber a day. I tried doing oatmeal, but I get tired of it really fast. Anyone have any good recipes for adding more fiber to my diet?  I do not have allergies, but I am not the biggest fan of things like almonds and other assorted nuts. As of now I am trying to bulk and increase my caloric intake, so calories aren't really an issue for me right now."
fitmeals,39ji5g,NUFITIONAL,2,Fri Jun 12 16:04:12 2015 UTC,"Physllium ( I think that is how you spell it ) husk and China seeds are composed primarily of dietary fiber. It stunning how much fiber they have per serving. You can put them in a shake or oatmeal,  even and omelet!  Homemade bread, a more natural laxative brownie, the possibilities are endless. They're tasteless to a reasonable extent and their marginally cheap."
fitmeals,39ji5g,brown_paper_bag,1 point,Fri Jun 12 18:27:46 2015 UTC,Have you looked into something like Metamucil or VegeGreens/Greens+ to add to your smoothies for an easy add?  A cup of raspberries or blackberries have 8 grams of fibre and a whole avocado has 13g.  Lentils have 15g of fiber per 1/4 cup.
fitmeals,39ji5g,Temptress75519,1 point,Fri Jun 12 17:19:54 2015 UTC,"Tried Cauliflower rice? Chop up a head in a food processor and toss it in a ziploc bag in the fridge. Add anything to it and sautee it. I like a couple cloves of garlic and sometimes a few dashes of Parmesan cheese. If you want a good source in a side it's really good. You would be surprised how much it reduces. I have been using 1/3 a head per serving and it isn't a ton of food, but it's filling. Per 1/4 head (which reduces to like 1/2 cup sauteed) there are 4g of fiber. I eat 4 oz of chicken with 1/2 a head. It's like mashed potatoes. I'm making myself hungry lol"

fitmeals,39ji5g,NUFITIONAL,3,Fri Jun 12 18:12:02 2015 UTC,"The night before, put about a half cup of oats into a container, the easiestcwoukd be s straight up glass jar. Put in a quarter cup of milk, dollop of yohgurt, and whatever toppings strike you fancy. Close up the jar and just grab it out of the fridge in the morning. Takes about 1 - 2 minutes to make and its delicious!"
fitmeals,39ji5g,krankie,2,Fri Jun 12 18:24:18 2015 UTC,"I've been doing this method to get away from the pre-packed sugar-laden oatmeal and it works great.  www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqsURjVBW0I  I use screw-on zip loc containers, 16oz.  I make them 10 at a time and keep them in the cupboard.  The ingredients are dry so they will last forever basically.  When it comes time to eat, just heat up water the in the microwave, dump it in, screw it shut, and leave it for 10 minutes.  By time it is cooled, the oatmeal is ready to eat.  I keep them stowed away in a drawer at work.  I can't remember if he adds chia seeds, but I do.  Chia seeds are healthy and provide additional fiber."

fitmeals,39dlww,tipping,5,Thu Jun 11 01:27:27 2015 UTC,"That looked so weird and fun, I had to try it. I'm not even vegan, I'm just curious.  I had a can of chickpeas in my pantry, but I wasn't sure what to do with that ""chickpea water"", as I don't really like meringue. Then I though about doing a sort of hummus mousse. And it works, woooh!   It took a little bit longer to get the whipped-egg-whites consistency than with regular egg whites (but not 15mn as shown on the video), and then I folded them into the hummus just like I would have done for a chocolate mousse.   Now I have bowl of light and fluffy hummus in the fridge. I don't know how long it will stay that way, I hope it'll still be okay in an hour for dinner.  Edit: It's less smooth after an hour, some bigger bubbles appeared. If I had to do it again, I would make hummus, keep the bean water, and I would whip it and mix the two at the last minute."

Lactaid is a pretty big brand of lactose free milk. I just don't like how most brands of lactose free milk end up tasting much sweeter than regular milk.  If you have an HEB of Central Market  they sell Mootopia.  It's lactose free and reduced sugar. So it tastes like normal milk.

fitmeals,3999p2,Hector_the_Collector,3,Wed Jun 10 13:37:17 2015 UTC,"I eat this every single day after the gym with some variations.  my go to:   1.5 Cups Fat free Greek Yogurt .75 Cups rolled oats 1-2 tbsp Crunchy peanut butter 1 tbsp Chia seeds sliced banana Fresh berries   Macros are approximate, usually: 55g P, 100g C, 25g F ~ 800 calories  The beauty is you can alter the necessary components to meet your macros. Need more fat? Add more peanut butter.  Another favorite of mine i will eat for dessert is:   1.5 Cups Fat free Greek Yogurt 1 tbsp Chia Seeds 1 Scoop Chocolate protein powder Fresh fruit if desired (i think this tastes killer with raspberries)   If you leave it in the refrigerator for an hour or so and let the chia seeds gel a little bit and then take it out and stir it all up you basically get a chocolate protein pudding. Its incredibly tasty and its something like 60g of protein at 400 calories. Yeah i love yogurt...."

fitmeals,39atz7,GetThee2ANunnery,17,Wed Jun 10 14:23:03 2015 UTC,"Hey, congrats on taking the first step! My suggestion to you would be to first make the food you enjoy (you could even do skinny versions of them). Most of the time, they'll be better for you. Also, this will help you get comfortable in the kitchen.   As for food recommendations, I always like having the following on hand:  Eggs  Spinach  Deli turkey  Cucumbers  Greek yogurt  Fresh and frozen fruit  Chick peas / beans  Quinoa / rice / noodles  Milk  Little bottles of lime and lemon juice  Tortillas   Frozen boneless, skinless chicken breasts  I find the above gives me a lot of variety and I'm able to make many of the things I like with those ingredients. For example: green smoothies, turkey wraps, bean burritos, salad, eggs and breakfast yogurt among other things.  In terms of cooking, a full and varied spice cabinet goes a long, long way.  Hope that was helpful!"

I've got like 50% of that list in my fridge/pantry, so I think I have some good basic building blocks! My kitchen scares me. Thanks a lot for the help!!"
fitmeals,39atz7,cuddlewench,3,Wed Jun 10 16:45:08 2015 UTC,"Chinese can be quite healthy! As I said, first start off with making just regular takeout rice. Because you're making it yourself, you can control how much oil/sodium/veggies are in it. I'd recommend going heavy on the veggies, but just use the ones you like (no sense in adding something in that'll just make you want to eat the final dish less, give up and order takeout, right?).  Also, I don't rely on recipes for simple lunches. This makes it much quicker and also takes the pressure off because I'm not expecting any one particular end result. So slap a tortilla down, add as much deli turkey slices as you like, a slice of cheese and whatever condiments you prefer (mayo, mustard, sriracha, ketchup, all of the above). I also like to throw cucumber into all my sandwiches, some spinach or lettuce, maybe some onion if I've got it lying around. Delicious, quick and no measurements! :)  And since you asked, there are certainly ""healthier"" versions of cookies around. I've had good success with using both Allrecipes.com and Pinterest for food recipes. Allrecipes has a great userbase and wealth of reviews to consult. Pinterest keeps things interesting and I discover new food blogs."

Sorry.  Ok, so you've gotten some great suggestions on what kind of healthy foods to eat and I don't have anything to add in that respect. BUT I wanted to address your goal.   You currently weigh 90 lbs at 27.7% body fat and your goal is to be 18%, that is a fantastic goal body fat percentage and would put you in a great ""healthy/fit"" range. I am, however, afraid that you plan on losing weight right off the bat, that's scary. If you drop from 27.7% body fat to 18% without first gaining muscle, you will be a skeletal 81 lbs. Again I apologize if I'm overstepping my bounds but that is beyond borderline anorexia.   Another point I wanted to address is that you said you you're not looking to get bulky, you just want to tone. I'm afraid at your weight it is very likely that you have little to no muscle to ""tone"". By the way when muscle tone shows, that is the outcome of first gaining muscle, then losing body fat to show the muscle tone. At 90lbs and nearly 30% bf, you have no muscle to show. I would highly suggest putting that ""bulky"" mentality aside and doing some serious eating (more than you're used to) as well as lifting weights. Head over to /r/progresspics to see that women don't get bulky from lifting heavy. Head over to /r/fitness to learn about some beginner lifting routines.  Ok I'm done ranting. And sorry if you were aware of these things already.   Edit: for reference this woman is 5'2"" 107lbs, with a bit of muscle tone.

fitmeals,39atz7,Engineer14,1 point,Thu Jun 11 02:36:15 2015 UTC,"No no, I appreciate your comment! I'll address some of your main points, for clarity. :)  I've always been this level of skinny- my parents had extremely fast metabolisms until they had kids (mom was a size 0 before me, dad was a basketball player) and got sedentary jobs. My weight varies between 85 and 95 depending on my ""time of the month."" My sister is barely heavier than me (still all the same sizes as me), and she exercises a lot.  That being said, I trained for (and completed!!!) a triathlon my freshman year of college (four years ago) for my wellness credit, and definitely put on solid muscle mass - didn't quite break 100 pounds, but I toned up a LOT. I also took in several thousand calories a day because I was working out so much. It was actually the most I ever weighed! Even now that I'm going to the gym regularly, I can already see my food intake increasing. It's just a matter of making sure that food is healthy and promoting muscle growth.  I've got my personal trainer for a year, meeting once a week, so I've got a long-term and progressive workout plan. If you have any suggestions for ""serious eating"" that have worked for you, I'd definitely be interested! Thanks for commenting; I appreciate your time! :)"
fitmeals,39atz7,Engineer14,6,Thu Jun 11 02:57:52 2015 UTC,"I also grew up hydrating on soda and eating fast food regularly, but it didn't really affect me weight wise--I see you're in the same boat given that you're only 90lbs.  It's a strange awakening when you realize how out-of-shape you are despite not being overweight.  I couldn't stop drinking soda cold turkey.  One thing that helped me transition away from soda was Mio.  I'm not sure if they have them where you're from, but they're water sweeteners that have little to no calories; some are even ""energy enhancers"" as well.  I find they taste really good and make drinking water much more inviting.  I would highly recommend them as a way of getting away from the soda.    I also recommend chocolate milk.

I used this recipe for the cauliflower.  1 head cauliflower 2 tablespoons heavy cream 1 tablespoon butter 2 ounces white cheddar A lot of pepper, a fair bit of salt, and some garlic powder   Cut up the cauliflower.  Put the cream and butter in a large bowl, then put in the cauliflower.  Microwave on high for 6 minutes.  Stir, covering the cauliflower with the butter and cream.   Microwave on high another 6 minutes.  Meanwhile, shred the cheese.  Once cauliflower is done, put in food processor with the cheese, salt, pepper, and garlic powder.  Process until smooth.  Microwave to get warm again before serving if not eating literally immediately (it cools down surprisingly quickly).  This recipe made enough for four servings of cauliflower as in the picture.  For the shrimp, I melted a tablespoon of butter and sauteed 1.5 ounces of onion and a clove or two of garlic.  I covered 10 shrimp (extra jumbo, 16/20) with cajun seasoning, then added them to the butter.  I cooked the shrimp about 1.5 minutes on each side, then topped the cauliflower.

They were frozen, which is the best way to ever buy anything like this unless you literally live on the beach.  I just left them in the fridge for a couple hours and they were thawed.  You don't really need to be that afraid.  Being frozen will kill any parasites, and just make sure to cook them long enough to kill any bacteria or anything.  They don't take long; these were really huge shrimp, and I still only cooked them like 2 minutes on each side or so.  (And if you overcook them a little bit, they're still really good.)"

For shorter people/women/those of healthy weight who still want to cut, maybe it's not low calorie for them. I dunno. In reality there might not be a good way to set this generically, but the tag didn't seem wrong to me.  Maybe if someone bothers to tag a post [low calorie], they should include the calorie content.

I am thinking about lowering the protein powder to 45g to thin it out a bit, but this will depend on how thin it makes the pancake. I found that thinner variations of this batter will produce more crepe-like pancakes. The 'pancakes' are not fluffy, but dense, sorta like a large flat biscuit. Personally I like it as there is zero egg taste/texture. I use liquid egg whites for consistency and convenience.  You can also leave out the vanilla and put in 2 good pinches of salt for a more savory flatbread. It is hearty enough to work as a protein bun."

There is no way in hell eating three cups of cheese and three eggs instead of 1.5 cups of flour (the amount in a normal pizza crust) is in any way shape or form healthier. Keto shmeeto, that's a massive amount of saturated fat and bad cholesterol you just consumed.   This doesn't belong in /r/fitmeals"
fitmeals,393pgh,Chocolate_fly,10,Tue Jun 9 08:54:21 2015 UTC,Why would anyone eat the entire thing?
fitmeals,393pgh,PokeKim989,-7,Tue Jun 9 09:49:30 2015 UTC,"I assume he eats half in one meal. So this pizza provides two meals. So that's a massive amount of saturated fat and bad cholesterol per meal, assuming two meals.    The daily recommended cholesterol/day is <300mg. I calculated this pizza has 1,258mg cholesterol (egg=558mg, cheese=306mg, meat=394)."
fitmeals,393pgh,Chocolate_fly,20,Tue Jun 9 10:02:21 2015 UTC,"By your own post, you're showing how absurd some of that information is. Three eggs are too much cholesterol for a day by themselves!  Dietary fat and cholesterol are not bad for you. If you're eating at a deficit, you're not storing any of that fat in the first place, you're burning it.  Would I eat this daily? No. The sheer calories were too much, and I'd rather not skip lunch just because dinner is going to be big. (Or at least, I'd rather not do that often.) But the basic macros you follow on keto are: 1. Very few carbs (<20g is a common choice), 2. Enough protein to maintain muscle, 3. The rest is fat. Significantly more protein than required is converted to sugar and can knock someone out of ketosis.  76 grams of fat (for the entire crust) is not even a little bad. That's like 700 calories from fat. Most keto plans recommend around 5% of your intake being carbs, 30% being protein, and 65% or being fat.  700 isn't even half.   If you're against keto, then I disagree, but that's your prerogative. That's what the diet is, though.   Anyway, the sausage topping had more fat than the entire crust did by itself."

Sure, it's keto friendly and if it helps you get down to a manageable weight then that's great.  However, this is certainly not something a person striving for good fitness would use to fuel their routines on a regular basis.    Honestly, the only veggies in this thing is ""about an ounce of onion and a half cup peppers.""  The lack of nutrients in this recipe alone should disqualify it as a fitmeal regardless of macros."

None of these things are striking as ""healthy"" given your definition which suggests that ""nutrients"" and veggies be present, but all are and likely will continue to be upvoted (which, by the way, makes no sense because ""nutrients"" include proteins and fats which this recipe includes).  The point of Fitmeals is to provide recipes for ""healthy"" alternatives to other, more popular and traditional recipes. While there are things that every body needs in order to ensure optimal functioning, there are also specializations in diets that many people are trying to fulfill including paleogenic, ketogenic, and high protein requirements.   If your goal is to cut out carbohydrates then you should take a look at this recipe because given your nutritional goals this can be a part of a healthy and balanced diet, meeting a ketogenic individual's nutritional needs. If your goal is to cut out fat, then given the ketogenic nature of this recipe (as stated in the title) this probably isn't for you."

None of that is ideal, but that's a lot of improvement in major indicators of health from 10 weeks on a high-fat diet.  Keto goes against a lot of mainstream health recommendations, so I understand the skepticism. This certainly isn't something that anyone on a conventional diet should eat, but it does belong in this sub, if for no other reason than to show that there are other ways to eat fit.

fitmeals,393pgh,EzDuz_it,11,Fri Jun 12 04:47:34 2015 UTC,"I found this recipe last year, when I was doing keto for the first time.  I fell off the bandwagon before ever making it, sadly. I know I found it on some forum, but I can't remember where.  This recipe was created just going by the Myfitnesspal recipe that I had made.  I like this recipe a lot compared to some because it's just so much simpler than many keto pizza crust recipes.  (And it's infinitely better than the coconut flour crust recipes I've tried; no offense to anyone who likes those.)  It is a bit high calorie, though.  Heh.   Crust  3 cups mozzarella cheese  3 eggs  1/4 tsp salt  Tsp garlic powder  Tsp basil  1/4 cup or so parmesan cheese (completely guessing on this part, I just threw some in)   Mix everything together really well, then smear out into a pizza-ish shape on something very nonstick.  Bake for 25 minutes or so at 350 degrees, or until it's starting to get brown.  Take it out of the oven, let it cool for 5 or 10 minutes, then flip it over.  Bake another 5 or 6 minutes.  Toppings 1 can diced tomatoes, blended and reduced. 1 cup mozzarella 20 slices turkey pepperoni 1 lb sausage, cooked and drained A scattering of onions and peppers (Didn't count, assuming about an ounce of onion and a half cup peppers)   Top and bake another 10 minutes or so.  Nutrition: Entire crust : 1170 cal, 12 carbs, 76 fat, 90 protein, 0 fiber  Entire Pizza (as made): 2984 cal, 46 carbs, 202 fat, 214 protein, 6 fiber  (A lot of those calories came from the sausage.  I should not have used a whole pound of sausage.  Without the sausage, the whole pizza would have about 1000 less calories.)"

Just 1 cup of soy flour has around 20 g of net carbs, which is the daily limit for most ketoers. It does look like it has great macros in other regards, but on keto you need to save your carbs for vegetables and the like with a high density of vitamins and micronutrients."

It is still very keto friendly and depending on the person your carb intake on Keto can be anywhere between 20-40 net carbs. If you were going to eat a whole 1500-1800 calorie pizza by yourself in one sitting, then yeah you're right.

I outgrew my allergy a few years back but I still remember some brands of stuff that has good macro content.   With 4.5g of fat is original Silk soy milk. You could mix it into anything or drink it plain. While it doesn't have much, it's still some.   https://silk.com/products/original-soymilk  Daiya brand cheese. Each product that I looked at has about 7-9g of fat per serving. Again you could stick it on your meal for the day or something. They also have a bunch of other products, but I looked at cheese since you can incorporate that into so many meals.   http://us.daiyafoods.com/our-products  With 19g of fat per serving is Lindt lindor(?) dark chocolate. While I do not enjoy dark chocolate at all (pretty sure that it's a childhood thing), it does have a good fat content.    http://www.lindtusa.com/shop/chocolates/dark-chocolate/70-cocoa-excellence-bar  Other brands also make ""peanut butter"" cups with dark chocolate and soynut butter. I cannot find the brand that I usually tell people, nor can I think of it. They do make peanut butter cups with dark chocolate, but I have a peanut allergy so I've never looked into that or had them.   Then lastly with 16g of fat, is sunbutter. It is a peanut free, peanut butter substitute. It is made from soybeans! Since I do have a peanut allergy, this has been my go to thing. My favorite brand is sunbutter and it has about the same macros and whatnot as peanut butter. It is a fantastic brand and all of their stuff is dairy free, peanut free, tree nut free, gluten free, egg free and sesame free. Not too bad!   http://sunbutter.com/products/  If you would like anymore suggestions, feel free to PM me! I would love to help! :) Also, I posted US links since that is where I am from. For a lot of these, many brands have the same variations of products. It's just a matter of shopping around but this is a good starting point. :)"

I cut at around 2k and bulk at around 3k (and that's a very small caloric surplus, I don't gain much fat at this caloric intake). As for losing gains when cutting, the things that helped me with that is Intermittent Fasting (look it up, 20/4 cycle works best for me), and taking a lot of BCAAs when cutting (I actually take quite a bit when bulking too)."

When I get to around 10% bf in the next few weeks I'm going to carefully bump the calories up and count them.

fitmeals,39082h,schlansky,1 point,Mon Jun 8 18:24:17 2015 UTC,"I know its a lot. I did actually aim for 3000 calories but when I ended up with the plan, it was 3300 calories and it was 4 am in the night, so just didn't want to change it then. I moved to the United States about 4 months ago, had been working out before that for 3-4 months and gained about 10 pounds then but lost 15-20 pounds after coming because of having a difficulty in adjusting with the food and now want to gain ~25 pounds. Currently I am ~130 lbs, less than 60 kgs for the first time since 12th grade in 2009 :(. It would be difficult to eat these much calories in the beginning but hopefully, if I set a bigger target, I would actually end up eating about 3000-3100 calories by cutting some portions a bit which is what I need at the moment."
fitmeals,39082h,jthm4,2,Tue Jun 9 08:47:51 2015 UTC,"If you eat 3300kcal at 130lbs you will gain a lot of fat. And I mean a lot. Your TDEE is probably at around 2000kcal, so you would gain around 2 lbs of fat per week and some muscle. That would be 16lbs of fat in 2 months. No matter how lean you are now, you do not want to gain that much fat. 200-300kcal above maintenance would be far more reasonable. So I would recommend recalculating and rethinking!"
fitmeals,39082h,TALQVIST,1 point,Mon Jun 8 21:36:45 2015 UTC,"You've got a good strategy here. Stick with your plan and consistently weigh yourself weekly. If you feel like you're gaining too fast then trim down some of your portions. It's quite rare for a calculator to be correct, there are just too many variables to consider. Be consistent and make small adjustments when you need to. Enjoy your gains, you're gonna make a ton :)"

fitmeals,39082h,ibrokedown,2,Mon Jun 8 14:50:53 2015 UTC,"I'd suggest switching your protein sources a bit, as of now you're getting the majority of it from protein shakes (which isnt bad, but switching that to meat or other protein source would be more beneficial). Also there are no benefits (or very little) from drinking your protein shake pre/post workout (i suggest drinking it as soon as you wake up, along with a carb source), you need to get a fast acting carb source post workout instead (the bananas would work)."
fitmeals,39082h,cannabibun,0,Mon Jun 8 19:25:05 2015 UTC,"This is terrible advice. There is definitely an increase in muscle protein synthesis when protein is taken after a workout, and arguably a more powerful response when taken with a carb. A carb alone won't do much besides replenish glycogen stores."
fitmeals,39082h,ibrokedown,2,Mon Jun 8 15:06:35 2015 UTC,"This is pure bro science, there is no definite research to back up your claim. Protein synthesis is a long process, the 'anabolic window' you're talking about is more like 6 hours or even more. As opposed to fast acting carbs, because you want to start the glycogen replenishment as soon as possible."
fitmeals,39082h,cannabibun,2,Mon Jun 8 21:55:09 2015 UTC,"This is pure bro science, there is no definite research to back up your claim. Protein synthesis is a long process, the 'anabolic window' you're talking about is more like 6 hours or even more.   I'm not sure what you think my claim is, I said nothing about an anabolic window (there is in fact plenty of research backing up the concept of it, especially in trained athletes and those who train fasted, and more beyond this one review, but that misses the point I was making), and my point had nothing to do with it.   What I was saying was that a pre-workout protein is ineffective, unless you are going to workout an hour or two later (and then you're better off having a full meal with carbs). If OP is going to work out in the morning, he is better off training fasted or with a light shake (some fruit, or BCAAs, or coconut oil in coffee, whatever) to keep from getting hungry during the lift, but light enough that he won't get overly full, gassy, and nauseous during the workout. That will have a much bigger effect on a workout than being fasted.   Another point against your advice of a carbohydrate only post-workout: carbohydrate + protein increases glycogen recovery more strongly than carbohydrate alone. I'm not sure who told you to not take protein post-workout, but you should stop listening to them.    Protein increased MPS post-exercise in rats A review that discusses the MPS response to post-exercise protein (which is well-established) and the link to later hypertrophy  A branded supplement versus generic protein + carb supplement show the same increases in FFM and other measures compared to each other, with resistance exercise alone as the baseline  Protein and carb shake post workout with added leucine increases MPS more than carb + fat shake alone Whey protein + carb stimulates MPS more than carb alone"
fitmeals,39082h,ibrokedown,1 point,Mon Jun 8 23:12:21 2015 UTC,"The post workout protein research you linked was a) conducted on rats b) conducted on cyclists And that's okay, it might somewhat apply to bodybuilding as well. BUT what I'm talking about here, with my advice of drinking protein shake straight away after waking up, is stopping the muscle breakdown as soon as possible (since you'll be fasting whole night) which would be far more beneficial for bulking than drinking the shake after workout - you'll be eating plenty of protein from other sources around the workout anyway. Also the protein + carb shake post workout was more about the leucine content, which I agree with, so take your BCAA with carbs after workout (I actually drink the BCAA during workout, even)."
fitmeals,39082h,cannabibun,0,Mon Jun 8 23:52:41 2015 UTC,"The post workout protein research you linked was a) conducted on rats   Muscle protein synthesis is highly conserved across mammals, and while you never can say the effect is quantitatively the same across all species (unless you show it), it's a strong indicator, especially in this field.    b) conducted on cyclists And that's okay, it might somewhat apply to bodybuilding as well.   One was, others were done on weight training subjects. It does apply to bodybuilding as well, it's not as different as you think.    BUT what I'm talking about here, with my advice of drinking protein shake straight away after waking up, is stopping the muscle breakdown as soon as possible (since you'll be fasting whole night)   You're missing the point. Any of my suggestions would do the same (except perhaps the coconut oil + coffee) with less volume which means less stomach discomfort when working out afterwards. If you're really worried about catabolism while you sleep (you shouldn't be), take a protein shake or eat a protein-heavy meal before bed. I usually take either casein+whey (whey alone leaves me hungry after 30 minutes or so, especially at night) or eat a steak before bed, as both slow digestion and keep you feeling full overnight.    Also the protein + carb shake post workout was more about the leucine content, which I agree with, so take your BCAA with carbs after workout (I actually drink the BCAA during workout, even).   Only the one in which I specifically said was about the added leucine. I believe I posted another one which just compared WPI+CHO to CHO and water. You can get your leucine from BCAAs or whey, but I prefer whey (and casein) after a workout because it's more filling. Honey is a great carb at any time. Another issue is that digestion will route more blood (and therefore oxygen) to the gut, which should be feeding the muscles."
fitmeals,39082h,ibrokedown,0,Tue Jun 9 00:45:08 2015 UTC,"Rats have a vastly different diet, I think introducing that much protein into their diet could make the change alone. This would have to be tested over a longer period of time (they basically extracted their muscles right after the experiment..).   You're missing the point. Any of my suggestions would do the same (except perhaps the coconut oil + coffee) with less volume which means less stomach discomfort when working out afterwards.     That's exactly why I take the whey right after waking up, because it's filling. That + some long digesting carbs (oatmeal in my case) seemed to be the perfect breakfast combo for me. And I agree with the casein before sleeping, but I assumed OP has only whey at hand.       If you're really worried about catabolism while you sleep (you shouldn't be)   Here I disagree, it has been proven that frequent protein ingestion (every 3 hours as opposed to 6 or more, cba to find the source, but I'm pretty sure I heard it from Dr. Jim Stoppani) during the day helped with the catabolism, so you think that a 10 hour break wouldn't do the same?       You can get your leucine from BCAAs or whey, but I prefer whey (and casein) after a workout because it's more filling. Honey is a great carb at any time.      The most popular whey protein have like 2g of leucine (checked ON, since I think it's the most used), the research showed the best results at 5g, so you'd be drinking two scoops after workout. Honey is mostly fructose, and probably not as handy as a fruit or fructose in powder (unless you wanna carry around a jar and spoon with yourself to the locker room :D)."
fitmeals,39082h,folderol,0,Tue Jun 9 01:03:03 2015 UTC,"Rats have a vastly different diet, I think introducing that much protein into their diet could make the change alone.    I can guarantee you these things are accounted for, it's not like they were fed 25 g whey protein. Plus, the general layout of the diet is similar to typical humans (18-23% protein).    This would have to be tested over a longer period of time (they basically extracted their muscles right after the experiment..).   No it wouldn't, they are specifically looking at post-exercise meal-induced muscle protein synthesis, which is an acute effect of exercise and nutrient intake.    That's exactly why I take the whey right after waking up, because it's filling. That + some long digesting carbs (oatmeal in my case) seemed to be the perfect breakfast combo for me. And I agree with the casein before sleeping, but I assumed OP has only whey at hand.   I will say personal preference will always win out here: if your GI tract is upset, you'll miss out on more gains than if you're comfortable. I lift almost immediately after I wake up (about 30 minutes after I get out of bed in the morning), and whey is way too much food for me.    Here I disagree, it has been proven that frequent protein ingestion (every 3 hours as opposed to 6 or more, cba to find the source, but I'm pretty sure I heard it from Dr. Jim Stoppani) during the day helped with the catabolism, so you think that a 10 hour break wouldn't do the same?   While I'm not a fan of Intermittent Fasting, the results I've seen have generally been good (but not always). I don't think the sleep period is enough to waste your muscles away, especially if you have a small meal beforehand. This is because not only is your body rebuilding during this period, but because your metabolic rate drops by about 15%, and the hormones and peptides that regulate your GI tract act differently at night - generally you won't have a big ghrelin/ghrp release cascade (signalling stomach emptying and hunger) in the middle of restful sleep. This, though, is dependent on the person, I think - I've experienced times where I would wake up hungry in the middle of the night (usually fixed with some casein and steak before bed), and I've also had bouts where I wouldn't be hungry until about 30 minutes after my lift (when you feel your stomach fully empty right after a lift and give your body what it needs, it's an amazing feeling).    The most popular whey protein have like 2g of leucine (checked ON, since I think it's the most used), the research showed the best results at 5g, so you'd be drinking two scoops after workout.   2 scoops is pretty standard for post-workout.    Honey is mostly fructose, and probably not as handy as a fruit or fructose in powder (unless you wanna carry around a jar and spoon with yourself to the locker room :D).   I go early enough to come back home to eat, shower, and get to work, luckily I have flexible hours. I go with honey because of the taste, but because it is a blend of sugars in a matrix, it leads to less discomfort when eating, blunts glucose response compared to sucrose, and leads to a more sustained increase in blood glucose (can't find the study ATM, but it compared honey with different single-sugar compounds), but with a lower spike. This prevents, for me at least, a sugar crash later on when I should be most productive at work, so it's more a personal preference for me than anything. It's a hell of a lot better tasting than waxy maize or straight sugar, that's for sure."

Measurements like cups are pretty common, but I wouldn't classify needing to own a scale as a beginner meal plan.  Add some variety to your meals. You've got a shit ton of egg white in there. Throw in some beef, some salmon. And you need to vary your fats, you have zero oil in your meal plan. It is a nice thing to throw a tbsp in with some veggies. Your veggies are probably fine, you could use a little more variety... but you've got a decent amount in there. Also some of your macros seem off, chicken breast has nowhere near that amount of fat."

I just keep it like this so that I have an estimate of things and I don't end up eating 100 gms of something when I am supposed to eat 50 gms of it. I would have added some other meats but I have been a vegetarian all my life and started eating chicken last week, so I am just taking things a bit slowly at the moment :). As per the oil is concerned, I would use them in the veggies.
